chapter 1

robert langdon awoke slowly.

a telephone was ringing in the darkness — a tinny, unfamiliar ring. he fumbled for the bedside
lamp and turned it on. squinting at his surroundings he saw a plush renaissance bedroom with
louis xvi furniture, hand-frescoed walls, and a colossal mahogany four-poster bed.

where the hell am i?

the jacquard bathrobe hanging on his bedpost bore the monogram: hotel ritz paris.

slowly, the fog began to lift.

langdon picked up the receiver. "hello?"

"monsieur langdon?" a man's voice said. "i hope i have not awoken you?"

dazed, langdon looked at the bedside clock. it was 12:32 a.m. he had been asleep only an hour,
but he felt like the dead.

"this is the concierge, monsieur. i apologize for this intrusion, but you have a visitor. he insists it
is urgent."

langdon still felt fuzzy. a visitor? his eyes focused now on a crumpled flyer on his bedside table.

the american university of paris

proudly presents

an evening with robert langdon

professor of religious symbology,

harvard university



langdon groaned. tonight's lecture — a slide show about pagan symbolism hidden in the stones of
chartres cathedral — had probably ruffled some conservative feathers in the audience. most likely,



some religious scholar had trailed him home to pick a fight.

"i'm sorry," langdon said, "but i'm very tired and — "

"mais, monsieur, " the concierge pressed, lowering his voice to an urgent whisper. "your guest is
an important man."

langdon had little doubt. his books on religious paintings and cult symbology had made him a
reluctant celebrity in the art world, and last year langdon's visibility had increased a hundredfold
after his involvement in a widely publicized incident at the vatican. since then, the stream of self-
important historians and art buffs arriving at his door had seemed never-ending.

"if you would be so kind," langdon said, doing his best to remain polite, "could you take the man's
name and number, and tell him i'll try to call him before i leave paris on tuesday? thank you." he
hung up before the concierge could protest.

sitting up now, langdon frowned at his bedside guest relations handbook, whose cover boasted:
sleep like a baby in the city of lights. slumber at the paris ritz. he
turned and gazed tiredly into the full-length mirror across the room. the man staring back at him
was a stranger — tousled and weary.

you need a vacation, robert.

the past year had taken a heavy toll on him, but he didn't appreciate seeing proof in the mirror. his
usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. a dark stubble was shrouding his strong
jaw and dimpled chin. around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way
deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair. although his female colleagues insisted the gray only
accentuated his bookish appeal, langdon knew better.

//"boston magazine could see me now.

last month, much to langdon's embarrassment, boston magazine had listed him as one of that
city's top ten most intriguing people — a dubious honor that made him the brunt of endless ribbing
by his harvard colleagues. tonight, three thousand miles from home, the accolade had resurfaced
to haunt him at the lecture he had given.

"ladies and gentlemen..." the hostess had announced to a full house at the american university of
paris's pavilion dauphine, "our guest tonight needs no introduction. he is the author of numerous
books: the symbology of secret sects, the an of the illuminati, the lost language of ideograms,
and when i say he wrote the book on religious iconology, i mean that quite literally. many of you
use his textbooks in class."

the students in the crowd nodded enthusiastically.



"i had planned to introduce him tonight by sharing his impressive curriculum vitae. however..."
she glanced playfully at langdon, who was seated onstage. "an audience member has just handed
me a far more, shall we say... intriguing introduction."

she held up a copy of boston magazine.

langdon cringed. where the hell did she get that?

the hostess began reading choice excerpts from the inane article, and langdon felt himself sinking
lower and lower in his chair. thirty seconds later, the crowd was grinning, and the woman showed
no signs of letting up. "and mr. langdon's refusal to speak publicly about his unusual role in last
year's vatican conclave certainly wins him points on our intrigue-o-meter." the hostess goaded the
crowd. "would you like to hear more?"

the crowd applauded.

somebody stop her, langdon pleaded as she dove into the article again.

"although professor langdon might not be considered hunk-handsome like some of our younger
awardees, this forty-something academic has more than his share of scholarly allure. his
captivating presence is punctuated by an unusually low, baritone speaking voice, which his female
students describe as 'chocolate for the ears.' "

the hall erupted in laughter.

langdon forced an awkward smile. he knew what came next — some ridiculous line about
"harrison ford in harris tweed" — and because this evening he had figured it was finally safe again
to wear his harris tweed and burberry turtleneck, he decided to take action.

"thank you, monique," langdon said, standing prematurely and edging her away from the
podium. "boston magazine clearly has a gift for fiction." he turned to the audience with an
embarrassed sigh. "and if i find which one of you provided that article, i'll have the consulate
deport you."

the crowd laughed.

"well, folks, as you all know, i'm here tonight to talk about the power of symbols..."



the ringing of langdon's hotel phone once again broke the silence.



groaning in disbelief, he picked up. "yes?"

as expected, it was the concierge. "mr. langdon, again my apologies. i am calling to inform you
that your guest is now en route to your room. i thought i should alert you."

langdon was wide awake now. "you sent someone to my room?"

"i apologize, monsieur, but a man like this... i cannot presume the authority to stop him."

"who exactly is he?"

but the concierge was gone.

almost immediately, a heavy fist pounded on langdon's door.

uncertain, langdon slid off the bed, feeling his toes sink deep into the savonniere carpet. he
donned the hotel bathrobe and moved toward the door. "who is it?"

"mr. langdon? i need to speak with you." the man's english was accented — a sharp, authoritative
bark. "my name is lieutenant jerome collet. direction centrale police judiciaire."

langdon paused. the judicial police? the dcpj was the rough equivalent of the u.s. fbi.

leaving the security chain in place, langdon opened the door a few inches. the face staring back
at him was thin and washed out. the man was exceptionally lean, dressed in an official-looking
blue uniform.

"may i come in?" the agent asked.

langdon hesitated, feeling uncertain as the stranger's sallow eyes studied him. "what is this all
about?"

"my capitaine requires your expertise in a private matter."

"now?" langdon managed. "it's after midnight."

"am i correct that you were scheduled to meet with the curator of the louvre this evening?"

langdon felt a sudden surge of uneasiness. he and the revered curator jacques sauniere had been
slated to meet for drinks after langdon's lecture tonight, but sauniere had never shown up. "yes.
how did you know that?"

"we found your name in his daily planner."



"i trust nothing is wrong?"

the agent gave a dire sigh and slid a polaroid snapshot through the narrow opening in the door.

when langdon saw the photo, his entire body went rigid.

"this photo was taken less than an hour ago. inside the louvre."

as langdon stared at the bizarre image, his initial revulsion and shock gave way to a sudden
upwelling of anger. "who would do this!"

"we had hoped that you might help us answer that very question, considering your knowledge in
symbology and your plans to meet with him."

langdon stared at the picture, his horror now laced with fear. the image was gruesome and
profoundly strange, bringing with it an unsettling sense of deja vu. a little over a year ago,
langdon had received a photograph of a corpse and a similar request for help. twenty-four hours
later, he had almost lost his life inside vatican city. this photo was entirely different, and yet
something about the scenario felt disquietingly familiar.

the agent checked his watch. "my capitaine is waiting, sir."

langdon barely heard him. his eyes were still riveted on the picture. "this symbol here, and the
way his body is so oddly..."

"positioned?" the agent offered.

langdon nodded, feeling a chill as he looked up. "i can't imagine who would do this to someone."

the agent looked grim. "you don't understand, mr. langdon. what you see in this photograph..."
he paused. "monsieur sauniere did that to himself."



chapter 2

one mile away, the hulking albino named silas limped through the front gate of the luxurious
brownstone residence on rue la bruyere. the spiked cilice belt that he wore around his thigh cut
into his flesh, and yet his soul sang with satisfaction of service to the lord.

pain is good.



his red eyes scanned the lobby as he entered the residence. empty. he climbed the stairs quietly,
not wanting to awaken any of his fellow numeraries. his bedroom door was open; locks were
forbidden here. he entered, closing the door behind him.

the room was spartan — hardwood floors, a pine dresser, a canvas mat in the corner that served as
his bed. he was a visitor here this week, and yet for many years he had been blessed with a similar
sanctuary in new york city.

the lord has provided me shelter and purpose in my life.

tonight, at last, silas felt he had begun to repay his debt. hurrying to the dresser, he found the cell
phone hidden in his bottom drawer and placed a call.

"yes?" a male voice answered.

"teacher, i have returned."

"speak," the voice commanded, sounding pleased to hear from him.

"all four are gone. the three senechaux... and the grand master himself."

there was a momentary pause, as if for prayer. "then i assume you have the information?"

"all four concurred. independently."

"and you believed them?"

"their agreement was too great for coincidence."

an excited breath. "excellent. i had feared the brotherhood's reputation for secrecy might prevail."

"the prospect of death is strong motivation."

"so, my pupil, tell me what i must know."

silas knew the information he had gleaned from his victims would come as a shock. "teacher, all
four confirmed the existence of the clef de voiite... the legendary keystone. "

he heard a quick intake of breath over the phone and could feel the teacher's excitement. "the
keystone. exactly as we suspected."

according to lore, the brotherhood had created a map of stone — a clef de voiite... or keystone — an
engraved tablet that revealed the final resting place of the brotherhood's greatest secret...



information so powerful that its protection was the reason for the brotherhood's very existence.

"when we possess the keystone," the teacher said, "we will be only one step away."

"we are closer than you think. the keystone is here in paris."

"paris? incredible. it is almost too easy."

silas relayed the earlier events of the evening... how all four of his victims, moments before death,
had desperately tried to buy back their godless lives by telling their secret. each had told silas the
exact same thing — that the keystone was ingeniously hidden at a precise location inside one of
paris's ancient churches — the eglise de saint- sulpice.

"inside a house of the lord," the teacher exclaimed. "how they mock us!"

"as they have for centuries."

the teacher fell silent, as if letting the triumph of this moment settle over him. finally, he spoke.
"you have done a great service to god. we have waited centuries for this. you must retrieve the
stone for me. immediately. tonight. you understand the stakes."

silas knew the stakes were incalculable, and yet what the teacher was now commanding seemed
impossible. "but the church, it is a fortress. especially at night. how will i enter?"

with the confident tone of a man of enormous influence, the teacher explained what was to be
done.



when silas hung up the phone, his skin tingled with anticipation.

one hour, he told himself, grateful that the teacher had given him time to carry out the necessary
penance before entering a house of god. / must purge my soul of today's sins. the sins committed
today had been holy in purpose. acts of war against the enemies of god had been committed for
centuries. forgiveness was assured.

even so, silas knew, absolution required sacrifice.

pulling his shades, he stripped naked and knelt in the center of his room. looking down, he
examined the spiked cilice belt clamped around his thigh. all true followers of the way wore this
device — a leather strap, studded with sharp metal barbs that cut into the flesh as a perpetual
reminder of christ's suffering. the pain caused by the device also helped counteract the desires of
the flesh.



although silas already had worn his cilice today longer than the requisite two hours, he knew
today was no ordinary day. grasping the buckle, he cinched it one notch tighter, wincing as the
barbs dug deeper into his flesh. exhaling slowly, he savored the cleansing ritual of his pain.

pain is good, silas whispered, repeating the sacred mantra of father josemaria escriva — the
teacher of all teachers. although escriva had died in 1975, his wisdom lived on, his words still
whispered by thousands of faithful servants around the globe as they knelt on the floor and
performed the sacred practice known as "corporal mortification."

silas turned his attention now to a heavy knotted rope coiled neatly on the floor beside him. the
discipline. the knots were caked with dried blood. eager for the purifying effects of his own
agony, silas said a quick prayer. then, gripping one end of the rope, he closed his eyes and swung
it hard over his shoulder, feeling the knots slap against his back. he whipped it over his shoulder
again, slashing at his flesh. again and again, he lashed.

castigo corpus meum.

finally, he felt the blood begin to flow.



chapter 3

the crisp april air whipped through the open window of the citroen zx as it skimmed south past
the opera house and crossed place vendome. in the passenger seat, robert langdon felt the city
tear past him as he tried to clear his thoughts. his quick shower and shave had left him looking
reasonably presentable but had done little to ease his anxiety. the frightening image of the
curator's body remained locked in his mind.

jacques sauniere is dead.

langdon could not help but feel a deep sense of loss at the curator's death. despite sauniere's
reputation for being reclusive, his recognition for dedication to the arts made him an easy man to
revere. his books on the secret codes hidden in the paintings of poussin and teniers were some of
langdon's favorite classroom texts. tonight's meeting had been one langdon was very much
looking forward to, and he was disappointed when the curator had not shown.

again the image of the curator's body flashed in his mind. jacques sauniere did that to himself?
langdon turned and looked out the window, forcing the picture from his mind.

outside, the city was just now winding down — street vendors wheeling carts of candied amandes,
waiters carrying bags of garbage to the curb, a pair of late night lovers cuddling to stay warm in a



breeze scented with jasmine blossom. the citroen navigated the chaos with authority, its dissonant
two-tone siren parting the traffic like a knife.

"he capitaine was pleased to discover you were still in paris tonight," the agent said, speaking for
the first time since they'd left the hotel. "a fortunate coincidence."

langdon was feeling anything but fortunate, and coincidence was a concept he did not entirely
trust. as someone who had spent his life exploring the hidden interconnectivity of disparate
emblems and ideologies, langdon viewed the world as a web of profoundly intertwined histories
and events. the connections may be invisible, he often preached to his symbology classes at
harvard, but they are always there, buried just beneath the surface.

"i assume," langdon said, "that the american university of paris told you where i was staying?"

the driver shook his head. "interpol."

interpol, langdon thought. of course. he had forgotten that the seemingly innocuous request of all
european hotels to see a passport at check-in was more than a quaint formality — it was the law. on
any given night, all across europe, interpol officials could pinpoint exactly who was sleeping
where. finding langdon at the ritz had probably taken all of five seconds.

as the citroen accelerated southward across the city, the illuminated profile of the eiffel tower
appeared, shooting skyward in the distance to the right. seeing it, langdon thought of vittoria,
recalling their playful promise a year ago that every six months they would meet again at a
different romantic spot on the globe. the eiffel tower, langdon suspected, would have made their
list. sadly, he last kissed vittoria in a noisy airport in rome more than a year ago.

"did you mount her?" the agent asked, looking over.

langdon glanced up, certain he had misunderstood. "i beg your pardon?"

"she is lovely, no?" the agent motioned through the windshield toward the eiffel tower. "have
you mounted her?"

langdon rolled his eyes. "no, i haven't climbed the tower."

"she is the symbol of france. i think she is perfect."

langdon nodded absently. symbologists often remarked that france — a country renowned for
machismo, womanizing, and diminutive insecure leaders like napoleon and pepin the
short — could not have chosen a more apt national emblem than a thousand-foot phallus.

when they reached the intersection at rue de rivoli, the traffic light was red, but the citroen didn't



slow. the agent gunned the sedan across the junction and sped onto a wooded section of rue
castiglione, which served as the northern entrance to the famed tuileries gardens — paris's own
version of central park. most tourists mistranslated jardins des tuileries as relating to the
thousands of tulips that bloomed here, but tuileries was actually a literal reference to something far
less romantic. this park had once been an enormous, polluted excavation pit from which parisian
contractors mined clay to manufacture the city's famous red roofing tiles — or tuiles.

as they entered the deserted park, the agent reached under the dash and turned off the blaring siren.
langdon exhaled, savoring the sudden quiet. outside the car, the pale wash of halogen headlights
skimmed over the crushed gravel parkway, the rugged whir of the tires intoning a hypnotic rhythm.
langdon had always considered the tuileries to be sacred ground. these were the gardens in which
claude monet had experimented with form and color, and literally inspired the birth of the
impressionist movement. tonight, however, this place held a strange aura of foreboding.

the citroen swerved left now, angling west down the park's central boulevard. curling around a
circular pond, the driver cut across a desolate avenue out into a wide quadrangle beyond. langdon
could now see the end of the tuileries gardens, marked by a giant stone archway.

arc du carrousel.

despite the orgiastic rituals once held at the arc du carrousel, art aficionados revered this place for
another reason entirely. from the esplanade at the end of the tuileries, four of the finest art
museums in the world could be seen... one at each point of the compass.

out the right-hand window, south across the seine and quai voltaire, langdon could see the
dramatically lit facade of the old train station — now the esteemed musee d'orsay. glancing left, he
could make out the top of the ultramodern pompidou center, which housed the museum of modern
art. behind him to the west, langdon knew the ancient obelisk of ramses rose above the trees,
marking the musee du jeu de paume.

but it was straight ahead, to the east, through the archway, that langdon could now see the
monolithic renaissance palace that had become the most famous art museum in the world.

musee du louvre.

langdon felt a familiar tinge of wonder as his eyes made a futile attempt to absorb the entire mass
of the edifice. across a staggeringly expansive plaza, the imposing facade of the louvre rose like a
citadel against the paris sky. shaped like an enormous horseshoe, the louvre was the longest
building in europe, stretching farther than three eiffel towers laid end to end. not even the million
square feet of open plaza between the museum wings could challenge the majesty of the facade's
breadth. langdon had once walked the louvre's entire perimeter, an astonishing three-mile
journey.



despite the estimated five days it would take a visitor to properly appreciate the 65,300 pieces of
art in this building, most tourists chose an abbreviated experience langdon referred to as "louvre
lite" — a full sprint through the museum to see the three most famous objects: the mona lisa,
venus de milo, and winged victory. art buchwald had once boasted he'd seen all three
masterpieces in five minutes and fifty-six seconds.

the driver pulled out a handheld walkie-talkie and spoke in rapid-fire french. "monsieur langdon
est arrive. deux minutes. "

an indecipherable confirmation came crackling back.

the agent stowed the device, turning now to langdon. "you will meet the capitaine at the main
entrance."

the driver ignored the signs prohibiting auto traffic on the plaza, revved the engine, and gunned
the citroen up over the curb. the louvre's main entrance was visible now, rising boldly in the
distance, encircled by seven triangular pools from which spouted illuminated fountains.

la pyramide.

the new entrance to the paris louvre had become almost as famous as the museum itself. the
controversial, neomodern glass pyramid designed by chinese-born american architect i. m. pei
still evoked scorn from traditionalists who felt it destroyed the dignity of the renaissance
courtyard. goethe had described architecture as frozen music, and pei's critics described this
pyramid as fingernails on a chalkboard. progressive admirers, though, hailed pei's seventy-one-foot-
tall transparent pyramid as a dazzling synergy of ancient structure and modern method — a
symbolic link between the old and new — helping usher the louvre into the next millennium.

"do you like our pyramid?" the agent asked.

langdon frowned. the french, it seemed, loved to ask americans this. it was a loaded question, of
course. admitting you liked the pyramid made you a tasteless american, and expressing dislike
was an insult to the french.

"mitterrand was a bold man," langdon replied, splitting the difference. the late french president
who had commissioned the pyramid was said to have suffered from a "pharaoh complex."
singlehandedly responsible for filling paris with egyptian obelisks, art, and artifacts.

francois mitterrand had an affinity for egyptian culture that was so all-consuming that the french
still referred to him as the sphinx.

"what is the captain's name?" langdon asked, changing topics.



"bezu fache," the driver said, approaching the pyramid's main entrance. "we call him le taureau. "

langdon glanced over at him, wondering if every frenchman had a mysterious animal epithet.
"you call your captain the bull?"

the man arched his eyebrows. "your french is better than you admit, monsieur langdon."

my french stinks, langdon thought, but my zodiac iconography is pretty good. taurus was always
the bull. astrology was a symbolic constant all over the world.

the agent pulled the car to a stop and pointed between two fountains to a large door in the side of
the pyramid. "there is the entrance. good luck, monsieur."

"you're not coming?"

"my orders are to leave you here. i have other business to attend to."

langdon heaved a sigh and climbed out. it's your circus.

the agent revved his engine and sped off.

as langdon stood alone and watched the departing taillights, he realized he could easily
reconsider, exit the courtyard, grab a taxi, and head home to bed. something told him it was
probably a lousy idea.

as he moved toward the mist of the fountains, langdon had the uneasy sense he was crossing an
imaginary threshold into another world. the dreamlike quality of the evening was settling around
him again. twenty minutes ago he had been asleep in his hotel room. now he was standing in front
of a transparent pyramid built by the sphinx, waiting for a policeman they called the bull.

i'm trapped in a salvador dali painting, he thought.

langdon strode to the main entrance — an enormous revolving door. the foyer beyond was dimly
lit and deserted.

do i knock?

langdon wondered if any of harvard's revered egyptologists had ever knocked on the front door of
a pyramid and expected an answer. he raised his hand to bang on the glass, but out of the darkness
below, a figure appeared, striding up the curving staircase. the man was stocky and dark, almost
neanderthal, dressed in a dark double-breasted suit that strained to cover his wide shoulders. he
advanced with unmistakable authority on squat, powerful legs. he was speaking on his cell phone
but finished the call as he arrived. he motioned for langdon to enter.



"i am bezu fache," he announced as langdon pushed through the revolving door. "captain of the
central directorate judicial police." his tone was fitting — a guttural rumble... like a gathering
storm.

langdon held out his hand to shake. "robert langdon."

fache's enormous palm wrapped around langdon's with crushing force.

"i saw the photo," langdon said. "your agent said jacques sauniere himself did — "

"mr. langdon," fache's ebony eyes locked on. "what you see in the photo is only the beginning of
what sauniere did."



chapter 4

captain bezu fache carried himself like an angry ox, with his wide shoulders thrown back and his
chin tucked hard into his chest. his dark hair was slicked back with oil, accentuating an arrow-like
widow's peak that divided his jutting brow and preceded him like the prow of a battleship. as he
advanced, his dark eyes seemed to scorch the earth before him, radiating a fiery clarity that forecast
his reputation for unblinking severity in all matters.

langdon followed the captain down the famous marble staircase into the sunken atrium beneath the
glass pyramid. as they descended, they passed between two armed judicial police guards with
machine guns. the message was clear: nobody goes in or out tonight without the blessing of
captain fache.

descending below ground level, langdon fought a rising trepidation. fache's presence was
anything but welcoming, and the louvre itself had an almost sepulchral aura at this hour. the
staircase, like the aisle of a dark movie theater, was illuminated by subtle tread-lighting embedded
in each step. langdon could hear his own footsteps reverberating off the glass overhead. as he
glanced up, he could see the faint illuminated wisps of mist from the fountains fading away outside
the transparent roof.

"do you approve?" fache asked, nodding upward with his broad chin.

langdon sighed, too tired to play games. "yes, your pyramid is magnificent."

fache grunted. "a scar on the face of paris."

strike one. langdon sensed his host was a hard man to please. he wondered if fache had any idea



that this pyramid, at president mitterrand's explicit demand, had been constructed of exactly 666
panes of glass — a bizarre request that had always been a hot topic among conspiracy buffs who
claimed 666 was the number of satan.

langdon decided not to bring it up.

as they dropped farther into the subterranean foyer, the yawning space slowly emerged from the
shadows. built fifty-seven feet beneath ground level, the louvre's newly constructed 70,000-square-
foot lobby spread out like an endless grotto. constructed in warm ocher marble to be compatible
with the honey-colored stone of the louvre facade above, the subterranean hall was usually vibrant
with sunlight and tourists. tonight, however, the lobby was barren and dark, giving the entire space
a cold and crypt-like atmosphere.

"and the museum's regular security staff?" langdon asked.

"en quarantaine, " fache replied, sounding as if langdon were questioning the integrity of fache's
team. "obviously, someone gained entry tonight who should not have. all louvre night wardens
are in the sully wing being questioned. my own agents have taken over museum security for the
evening."

langdon nodded, moving quickly to keep pace with fache.

"how well did you know jacques sauniere?" the captain asked.

"actually, not at all. we'd never met."

fache looked surprised. "your first meeting was to be tonight?"

"yes. we'd planned to meet at the american university reception following my lecture, but he
never showed up."

fache scribbled some notes in a little book. as they walked, langdon caught a glimpse of the
louvre's lesser-known pyramid — la pyramide inversee — a huge inverted skylight that hung from
the ceiling like a stalactite in an adjoining section of the entresol. fache guided langdon up a short
set of stairs to the mouth of an arched tunnel, over which a sign read: denon. the denon wing
was the most famous of the louvre's three main sections.

"who requested tonight's meeting?" fache asked suddenly. "you or he?"

the question seemed odd. "mr. sauniere did," langdon replied as they entered the tunnel. "his
secretary contacted me a few weeks ago via e-mail. she said the curator had heard i would be
lecturing in paris this month and wanted to discuss something with me while i was here."



"discuss what?"

"i don't know. art, i imagine. we share similar interests."

fache looked skeptical. "you have no idea what your meeting was about?"

langdon did not. he'd been curious at the time but had not felt comfortable demanding specifics.
the venerated jacques sauniere had a renowned penchant for privacy and granted very few
meetings; langdon was grateful simply for the opportunity to meet him.

"mr. langdon, can you at least guess what our murder victim might have wanted to discuss with
you on the night he was killed? it might be helpful."

the pointedness of the question made langdon uncomfortable. "i really can't imagine. i didn't ask.
i felt honored to have been contacted at all. i'm an admirer of mr. sauniere's work. i use his texts
often in my classes."

fache made note of that fact in his book.

the two men were now halfway up the denon wing's entry tunnel, and langdon could see the
twin ascending escalators at the far end, both motionless.

"so you shared interests with him?" fache asked.

"yes. in fact, i've spent much of the last year writing the draft for a book that deals with mr.
sauniere's primary area of expertise. i was looking forward to picking his brain."

fache glanced up. "pardon?"

the idiom apparently didn't translate. "i was looking forward to learning his thoughts on the topic."

"i see. and what is the topic?"

langdon hesitated, uncertain exactly how to put it. "essentially, the manuscript is about the
iconography of goddess worship — the concept of female sanctity and the art and symbols
associated with it."

fache ran a meaty hand across his hair. "and sauniere was knowledgeable about this?"

"nobody more so."

"i see."



langdon sensed fache did not see at all. jacques sauniere was considered the premiere goddess
iconographer on earth. not only did sauniere have a personal passion for relics relating to fertility,
goddess cults, wicca, and the sacred feminine, but during his twenty-year tenure as curator,
sauniere had helped the louvre amass the largest collection of goddess art on earth — labrys axes
from the priestesses' oldest greek shrine in delphi, gold caducei wands, hundreds of tjet ankhs
resembling small standing angels, sistrum rattles used in ancient egypt to dispel evil spirits, and an
astonishing array of statues depicting horus being nursed by the goddess isis.

"perhaps jacques sauniere knew of your manuscript?" fache offered. "and he called the meeting
to offer his help on your book."

langdon shook his head. "actually, nobody yet knows about my manuscript. it's still in draft form,
and i haven't shown it to anyone except my editor."

fache fell silent.

langdon did not add the reason he hadn't yet shown the manuscript to anyone else. the three-
hundred-page draft — tentatively titled symbols of the lost sacred feminine — proposed some very
unconventional interpretations of established religious iconography which would certainly be
controversial.

now, as langdon approached the stationary escalators, he paused, realizing fache was no longer
beside him. turning, langdon saw fache standing several yards back at a service elevator.

"we'll take the elevator," fache said as the lift doors opened. "as i'm sure you're aware, the gallery
is quite a distance on foot. "

although langdon knew the elevator would expedite the long, two-story climb to the denon wing,
he remained motionless.

"is something wrong?" fache was holding the door, looking impatient.

langdon exhaled, turning a longing glance back up the open-air escalator. nothing's wrong at all,
he lied to himself, trudging back toward the elevator. as a boy, langdon had fallen down an
abandoned well shaft and almost died treading water in the narrow space for hours before being
rescued. since then, he'd suffered a haunting phobia of enclosed spaces — elevators, subways,
squash courts. the elevator is a perfectly safe machine, langdon continually told himself, never
believing it. it's a tiny metal box hanging in an enclosed shaft! holding his breath, he stepped into
the lift, feeling the familiar tingle of adrenaline as the doors slid shut. two floors. ten seconds.

"you and mr. sauniere," fache said as the lift began to move, "you never spoke at all? never
corresponded? never sent each other anything in the mail?"



another odd question. langdon shook his head. "no. never." fache cocked his head, as if making
a mental note of that fact. saying nothing, he stared dead ahead at the chrome doors.

as they ascended, langdon tried to focus on anything other than the four walls around him. in the
reflection of the shiny elevator door, he saw the captain's tie clip — a silver crucifix with thirteen
embedded pieces of black onyx. langdon found it vaguely surprising. the symbol was known as a
crux gemmata — a cross bearing thirteen gems — a christian ideogram for christ and his twelve
apostles. somehow langdon had not expected the captain of the french police to broadcast his
religion so openly. then again, this was france; christianity was not a religion here so much as a
birthright.

"it's a crux gemmata" fache said suddenly.

startled, langdon glanced up to find fache's eyes on him in the reflection.

the elevator jolted to a stop, and the doors opened.

langdon stepped quickly out into the hallway, eager for the wide-open space afforded by the
famous high ceilings of the louvre galleries. the world into which he stepped, however, was
nothing like he expected.

surprised, langdon stopped short.

fache glanced over. "i gather, mr. langdon, you have never seen the louvre after hours?"

/ guess not, langdon thought, trying to get his bearings.

usually impeccably illuminated, the louvre galleries were startlingly dark tonight. instead of the
customary flat-white light flowing down from above, a muted red glow seemed to emanate upward
from the baseboards — intermittent patches of red light spilling out onto the tile floors.

as langdon gazed down the murky corridor, he realized he should have anticipated this scene.
virtually all major galleries employed red service lighting at night — strategically placed, low-level,
noninvasive lights that enabled staff members to navigate hallways and yet kept the paintings in
relative darkness to slow the fading effects of overexposure to light. tonight, the museum
possessed an almost oppressive quality. long shadows encroached everywhere, and the usually
soaring vaulted ceilings appeared as a low, black void.

"this way," fache said, turning sharply right and setting out through a series of interconnected
galleries.

langdon followed, his vision slowly adjusting to the dark. all around, large-format oils began to
materialize like photos developing before him in an enormous darkroom... their eyes following as



he moved through the rooms. he could taste the familiar tang of museum air — an arid, deionized
essence that carried a faint hint of carbon — the product of industrial, coal-filter dehumidifiers that
ran around the clock to counteract the corrosive carbon dioxide exhaled by visitors.

mounted high on the walls, the visible security cameras sent a clear message to visitors: we see
you. do not touch anything.

"any of them real?" langdon asked, motioning to the cameras.

fache shook his head. "of course not."

langdon was not surprised. video surveillance in museums this size was cost-prohibitive and
ineffective. with acres of galleries to watch over, the louvre would require several hundred
technicians simply to monitor the feeds. most large museums now used "containment security."
forget keeping thieves out. keep them in. containment was activated after hours, and if an intruder
removed a piece of artwork, compartmentalized exits would seal around that gallery, and the thief
would find himself behind bars even before the police arrived.

the sound of voices echoed down the marble corridor up ahead. the noise seemed to be coming
from a large recessed alcove that lay ahead on the right. a bright light spilled out into the hallway.

"office of the curator," the captain said.

as he and fache drew nearer the alcove, langdon peered down a short hallway, into sauniere's
luxurious study — warm wood, old master paintings, and an enormous antique desk on which stood
a two-foot-tall model of a knight in full armor. a handful of police agents bustled about the room,
talking on phones and taking notes. one of them was seated at sauniere's desk, typing into a
laptop. apparently, the curator's private office had become dcpj's makeshift command post for the
evening.

"messieurs, " fache called out, and the men turned. "ne nous derangez pas sous aucun pretexte.
entendu?"

everyone inside the office nodded their understanding.

langdon had hung enough ne pas deranger signs on hotel room doors to catch the gist of the
captain's orders. fache and langdon were not to be disturbed under any circumstances.

leaving the small congregation of agents behind, fache led langdon farther down the darkened
hallway. thirty yards ahead loomed the gateway to the louvre's most popular section — la grande
galerie — a seemingly endless corridor that housed the louvre's most valuable italian masterpieces.
langdon had already discerned that this was where sauniere's body lay; the grand gallery's
famous parquet floor had been unmistakable in the polaroid.



as they approached, langdon saw the entrance was blocked by an enormous steel grate that looked
like something used by medieval castles to keep out marauding armies.

"containment security, " fache said, as they neared the grate.

even in the darkness, the barricade looked like it could have restrained a tank. arriving outside,
langdon peered through the bars into the dimly lit caverns of the grand gallery.

"after you, mr. langdon," fache said.

langdon turned. after me, where ?

fache motioned toward the floor at the base of the grate.

langdon looked down. in the darkness, he hadn't noticed. the barricade was raised about two feet,
providing an awkward clearance underneath.

"this area is still off limits to louvre security," fache said. "my team from police technique et
scientifique has just finished their investigation." he motioned to the opening. "please slide under."

langdon stared at the narrow crawl space at his feet and then up at the massive iron grate. he's
kidding, right? the barricade looked like a guillotine waiting to crush intruders.

fache grumbled something in french and checked his watch. then he dropped to his knees and
slithered his bulky frame underneath the grate. on the other side, he stood up and looked back
through the bars at langdon.

langdon sighed. placing his palms flat on the polished parquet, he lay on his stomach and pulled
himself forward. as he slid underneath, the nape of his harris tweed snagged on the bottom of the
grate, and he cracked the back of his head on the iron.

very suave, robert, he thought, fumbling and then finally pulling himself through. as he stood up,
langdon was beginning to suspect it was going to be a very long night.



chapter 5

murray hill place — the new opus dei world headquarters and conference center — is located at
243 lexington avenue in new york city. with a price tag of just over $47 million, the 133,000-
square-foot tower is clad in red brick and indiana limestone. designed by may & pinska, the
building contains over one hundred bedrooms, six dining rooms, libraries, living rooms, meeting



rooms, and offices. the second, eighth, and sixteenth floors contain chapels, ornamented with mill-
work and marble. the seventeenth floor is entirely residential. men enter the building through the
main doors on lexington avenue. women enter through a side street and are "acoustically and
visually separated" from the men at all times within the building.

earlier this evening, within the sanctuary of his penthouse apartment, bishop manuel aringarosa
had packed a small travel bag and dressed in a traditional black cassock. normally, he would have
wrapped a purple cincture around his waist, but tonight he would be traveling among the public,
and he preferred not to draw attention to his high office. only those with a keen eye would notice
his 14-karat gold bishop's ring with purple amethyst, large diamonds, and hand-tooled mitre-
crozier applique. throwing the travel bag over his shoulder, he said a silent prayer and left his
apartment, descending to the lobby where his driver was waiting to take him to the airport.

now, sitting aboard a commercial airliner bound for rome, aringarosa gazed out the window at
the dark atlantic. the sun had already set, but aringarosa knew his own star was on the rise.
tonight the battle will be won, he thought, amazed that only months ago he had felt powerless
against the hands that threatened to destroy his empire.

as president-general of opus dei, bishop aringarosa had spent the last decade of his life spreading
the message of "god's work" — literally, opus dei. the congregation, founded in 1928 by the
spanish priest josemaria escriva, promoted a return to conservative catholic values and
encouraged its members to make sweeping sacrifices in their own lives in order to do the work of
god.

opus dei's traditionalist philosophy initially had taken root in spain before franco's regime, but
with the 1934 publication of josemaria escriva's spiritual book the way — 999 points of meditation
for doing god's work in one's own life — escriva's message exploded across the world. now, with
over four million copies of the way in circulation in forty-two languages, opus dei was a global
force. its residence halls, teaching centers, and even universities could be found in almost every
major metropolis on earth. opus dei was the fastest-growing and most financially secure catholic
organization in the world. unfortunately, aringarosa had learned, in an age of religious cynicism,
cults, and televangelists, opus dei's escalating wealth and power was a magnet for suspicion.

"many call opus dei a brainwashing cult," reporters often challenged. "others call you an
ultraconservative christian secret society. which are you?"

"opus dei is neither," the bishop would patiently reply. "we are a catholic church. we are a
congregation of catholics who have chosen as our priority to follow catholic doctrine as rigorously
as we can in our own daily lives."

"does god's work necessarily include vows of chastity, tithing, and atonement for sins through
self-flagellation and the cilice?"



"you are describing only a small portion of the opus dei population," aringarosa said. "there are
many levels of involvement. thousands of opus dei members are married, have families, and do
god's work in their own communities. others choose lives of asceticism within our cloistered
residence halls. these choices are personal, but everyone in opus dei shares the goal of bettering
the world by doing the work of god. surely this is an admirable quest."

reason seldom worked, though. the media always gravitated toward scandal, and opus dei, like
most large organizations, had within its membership a few misguided souls who cast a shadow
over the entire group.

two months ago, an opus dei group at a midwestern university had been caught drugging new
recruits with mescaline in an effort to induce a euphoric state that neophytes would perceive as a
religious experience. another university student had used his barbed cilice belt more often than the
recommended two hours a day and had given himself a near lethal infection. in boston not long
ago, a disillusioned young investment banker had signed over his entire life savings to opus dei
before attempting suicide.

misguided sheep, aringarosa thought, his heart going out to them.

of course the ultimate embarrassment had been the widely publicized trial of fbi spy robert
hanssen, who, in addition to being a prominent member of opus dei, had turned out to be a sexual
deviant, his trial uncovering evidence that he had rigged hidden video cameras in his own bedroom
so his friends could watch him having sex with his wife. "hardly the pastime of a devout catholic,"
the judge had noted.

sadly, all of these events had helped spawn the new watch group known as the opus dei
awareness network (odan). the group's popular website — www.odan.org — relayed frightening
stories from former opus dei members who warned of the dangers of joining. the media was now
referring to opus dei as "god's mafia" and "the cult of christ."

we fear what we do not understand, aringarosa thought, wondering if these critics had any idea
how many lives opus dei had enriched. the group enjoyed the full endorsement and blessing of
the vatican. opus dei is a personal prelature of the pope himself.

recently, however, opus dei had found itself threatened by a force infinitely more powerful than
the media... an unexpected foe from which aringarosa could not possibly hide. five months ago,
the kaleidoscope of power had been shaken, and aringarosa was still reeling from the blow.

"they know not the war they have begun," aringarosa whispered to himself, staring out the plane's
window at the darkness of the ocean below. for an instant, his eyes refocused, lingering on the
reflection of his awkward face — dark and oblong, dominated by a flat, crooked nose that had been
shattered by a fist in spain when he was a young missionary. the physical flaw barely registered
now. aringarosa's was a world of the soul, not of the flesh.



as the jet passed over the coast of portugal, the cell phone in aringarosa's cassock began vibrating
in silent ring mode. despite airline regulations prohibiting the use of cell phones during flights,
aringarosa knew this was a call he could not miss. only one man possessed this number, the man
who had mailed aringarosa the phone.

excited, the bishop answered quietly. "yes?"

"silas has located the keystone," the caller said. "it is in paris. within the church of saint-sulpice."

bishop aringarosa smiled. "then we are close."

"we can obtain it immediately. but we need your influence."

"of course. tell me what to do."

when aringarosa switched off the phone, his heart was pounding. he gazed once again into the
void of night, feeling dwarfed by the events he had put into motion.



five hundred miles away, the albino named silas stood over a small basin of water and dabbed the
blood from his back, watching the patterns of red spinning in the water. purge me with hyssop and
i shall be clean, he prayed, quoting psalms. wash me, and i shall be whiter than snow.

silas was feeling an aroused anticipation that he had not felt since his previous life. it both
surprised and electrified him. for the last decade, he had been following the way, cleansing
himself of sins... rebuilding his life... erasing the violence in his past. tonight, however, it had all
come rushing back. the hatred he had fought so hard to bury had been summoned. he had been
startled how quickly his past had resurfaced. and with it, of course, had come his skills. rusty but
serviceable.

jesus' message is one of peace... of nonviolence... of love. this was the message silas had been
taught from the beginning, and the message he held in his heart. and yet this was the message the
enemies of christ now threatened to destroy. those who threaten god with force will be met with
force. immovable and steadfast.

for two millennia, christian soldiers had defended their faith against those who tried to displace it.
tonight, silas had been called to battle.

drying his wounds, he donned his ankle-length, hooded robe. it was plain, made of dark wool,
accentuating the whiteness of his skin and hair. tightening the rope-tie around his waist, he raised
the hood over his head and allowed his red eyes to admire his reflection in the mirror. the wheels
are in motion.



chapter 6

having squeezed beneath the security gate, robert langdon now stood just inside the entrance to
the grand gallery. he was staring into the mouth of a long, deep canyon. on either side of the
gallery, stark walls rose thirty feet, evaporating into the darkness above. the reddish glow of the
service lighting sifted upward, casting an unnatural smolder across a staggering collection of da
vincis, titians, and caravaggios that hung suspended from ceiling cables. still lifes, religious
scenes, and landscapes accompanied portraits of nobility and politicians.

although the grand gallery housed the louvre's most famous italian art, many visitors felt the
wing's most stunning offering was actually its famous parquet floor. laid out in a dazzling
geometric design of diagonal oak slats, the floor produced an ephemeral optical illusion — a multi-
dimensional network that gave visitors the sense they were floating through the gallery on a surface
that changed with every step.

as langdon's gaze began to trace the inlay, his eyes stopped short on an unexpected object lying
on the floor just a few yards to his left, surrounded by police tape. he spun toward fache. "is that...
a caravaggio on the floor?"

fache nodded without even looking.

the painting, langdon guessed, was worth upward of two million dollars, and yet it was lying on
the floor like a discarded poster. "what the devil is it doing on the floor!"

fache glowered, clearly unmoved. "this is a crime scene, mr. langdon. we have touched nothing.
that canvas was pulled from the wall by the curator. it was how he activated the security system."

langdon looked back at the gate, trying to picture what had happened.

"the curator was attacked in his office, fled into the grand gallery, and activated the security gate
by pulling that painting from the wall. the gate fell immediately, sealing off all access. this is the
only door in or out of this gallery."

langdon felt confused. "so the curator actually captured his attacker inside the grand gallery?"

fache shook his head. "the security gate separated sauniere from his attacker. the killer was
locked out there in the hallway and shot sauniere through this gate." fache pointed toward an
orange tag hanging from one of the bars on the gate under which they had just passed. "the pts
team found flashback residue from a gun. he fired through the bars. sauniere died in here alone."



langdon pictured the photograph of sauniere's body. they said he did that to himself. langdon
looked out at the enormous corridor before them. "so where is his body?"

fache straightened his cruciform tie clip and began to walk. "as you probably know, the grand
gallery is quite long."

the exact length, if langdon recalled correctly, was around fifteen hundred feet, the length of three
washington monuments laid end to end. equally breathtaking was the corridor's width, which
easily could have accommodated a pair of side-by-side passenger trains. the center of the hallway
was dotted by the occasional statue or colossal porcelain urn, which served as a tasteful divider and
kept the flow of traffic moving down one wall and up the other.

fache was silent now, striding briskly up the right side of the corridor with his gaze dead ahead.
langdon felt almost disrespectful to be racing past so many masterpieces without pausing for so
much as a glance.

not that i could see anything in this lighting, he thought.

the muted crimson lighting unfortunately conjured memories of langdon' s last experience in
noninvasive lighting in the vatican secret archives. this was tonight's second unsettling parallel
with his near-death in rome. he flashed on vittoria again. she had been absent from his dreams
for months. langdon could not believe rome had been only a year ago; it felt like decades.
another life. his last correspondence from vittoria had been in december — a postcard saying she
was headed to the java sea to continue her research in entanglement physics... something about
using satellites to track manta ray migrations. langdon had never harbored delusions that a woman
like vittoria vetra could have been happy living with him on a college campus, but their encounter
in rome had unlocked in him a longing he never imagined he could feel. his lifelong affinity for
bachelorhood and the simple freedoms it allowed had been shaken somehow... replaced by an
unexpected emptiness that seemed to have grown over the past year.

they continued walking briskly, yet langdon still saw no corpse. "jacques sauniere went this
far?"

"mr. sauniere suffered a bullet wound to his stomach. he died very slowly. perhaps over fifteen or
twenty minutes. he was obviously a man of great personal strength."

langdon turned, appalled. "security took fifteen minutes to get here?"

"of course not. louvre security responded immediately to the alarm and found the grand gallery
sealed. through the gate, they could hear someone moving around at the far end of the corridor,
but they could not see who it was. they shouted, but they got no answer. assuming it could only
be a criminal, they followed protocol and called in the judicial police. we took up positions within
fifteen minutes. when we arrived, we raised the barricade enough to slip underneath, and i sent a



dozen armed agents inside. they swept the length of the gallery to corner the intruder."

"and?"

"they found no one inside. except..." he pointed farther down the hall. "him."

langdon lifted his gaze and followed fache's outstretched finger. at first he thought fache was
pointing to a large marble statue in the middle of the hallway. as they continued, though, langdon
began to see past the statue. thirty yards down the hall, a single spotlight on a portable pole stand
shone down on the floor, creating a stark island of white light in the dark crimson gallery. in the
center of the light, like an insect under a microscope, the corpse of the curator lay naked on the
parquet floor.

"you saw the photograph," fache said, "so this should be of no surprise."

langdon felt a deep chill as they approached the body. before him was one of the strangest images
he had ever seen.



the pallid corpse of jacques sauniere lay on the parquet floor exactly as it appeared in the
photograph. as langdon stood over the body and squinted in the harsh light, he reminded himself
to his amazement that sauniere had spent his last minutes of life arranging his own body in this
strange fashion.

sauniere looked remarkably fit for a man of his years... and all of his musculature was in plain
view. he had stripped off every shred of clothing, placed it neatly on the floor, and laid down on
his back in the center of the wide corridor, perfectly aligned with the long axis of the room. his
arms and legs were sprawled outward in a wide spread eagle, like those of a child making a snow
angel... or, perhaps more appropriately, like a man being drawn and quartered by some invisible
force.

just below sauniere's breastbone, a bloody smear marked the spot where the bullet had pierced his
flesh. the wound had bled surprisingly little, leaving only a small pool of blackened blood.

sauniere's left index finger was also bloody, apparently having been dipped into the wound to
create the most unsettling aspect of his own macabre deathbed; using his own blood as ink, and
employing his own naked abdomen as a canvas, sauniere had drawn a simple symbol on his
flesh — five straight lines that intersected to form a five-pointed star.

the pentacle.

the bloody star, centered on sauniere's navel, gave his corpse a distinctly ghoulish aura. the photo



langdon had seen was chilling enough, but now, witnessing the scene in person, langdon felt a
deepening uneasiness.

he did this to himself.

"mr. langdon?" fache's dark eyes settled on him again.

"it's a pentacle," langdon offered, his voice feeling hollow in the huge space. "one of the oldest
symbols on earth. used over four thousand years before christ."

"and what does it mean?"

langdon always hesitated when he got this question. telling someone what a symbol "meant" was
like telling them how a song should make them feel — it was different for all people. a white ku
klux klan headpiece conjured images of hatred and racism in the united states, and yet the same
costume carried a meaning of religious faith in spain.

"symbols carry different meanings in different settings," langdon said. "primarily, the pentacle is
a pagan religious symbol."

fache nodded. "devil worship."

"no," langdon corrected, immediately realizing his choice of vocabulary should have been clearer.

nowadays, the term pagan had become almost synonymous with devil worship — a gross
misconception. the word's roots actually reached back to the latin paganus, meaning country-
dwellers. "pagans" were literally unindoctrinated country-folk who clung to the old, rural religions
of nature worship. in fact, so strong was the church's fear of those who lived in the rural villes that
the once innocuous word for "villager" — villain — came to mean a wicked soul.

"the pentacle," langdon clarified, "is a pre-christian symbol that relates to nature worship. the
ancients envisioned their world in two halves — masculine and feminine. their gods and goddesses
worked to keep a balance of power. yin and yang. when male and female were balanced, there
was harmony in the world. when they were unbalanced, there was chaos." langdon motioned to
sauniere's stomach. "this pentacle is representative of the female half of all things — a concept
religious historians call the 'sacred feminine' or the 'divine goddess.' sauniere, of all people, would
know this."

"sauniere drew a goddess symbol on his stomach?"

langdon had to admit, it seemed odd. "in its most specific interpretation, the pentacle symbolizes
venus — the goddess of female sexual love and beauty."



fache eyed the naked man, and grunted.

"early religion was based on the divine order of nature. the goddess venus and the planet venus
were one and the same. the goddess had a place in the nighttime sky and was known by many
names — venus, the eastern star, ishtar, astarte — all of them powerful female concepts with ties to
nature and mother earth. "

fache looked more troubled now, as if he somehow preferred the idea of devil worship.

langdon decided not to share the pentacle's most astonishing property — the graphic origin of its
ties to venus. as a young astronomy student, langdon had been stunned to learn the planet venus
traced a perfect pentacle across the ecliptic sky every four years. so astonished were the ancients to
observe this phenomenon, that venus and her pentacle became symbols of perfection, beauty, and
the cyclic qualities of sexual love. as a tribute to the magic of venus, the greeks used her four-
year cycle to organize their olympiads. nowadays, few people realized that the four-year schedule
of modern olympic games still followed the cycles of venus. even fewer people knew that the
five-pointed star had almost become the official olympic seal but was modified at the last
moment — its five points exchanged for five intersecting rings to better reflect the games' spirit of
inclusion and harmony.

"mr. langdon," fache said abruptly. "obviously, the pentacle must also relate to the devil. your
american horror movies make that point clearly."

langdon frowned. thank you, hollywood. the five-pointed star was now a virtual cliche in satanic
serial killer movies, usually scrawled on the wall of some satanist's apartment along with other
alleged demonic symbology. langdon was always frustrated when he saw the symbol in this
context; the pentacle's true origins were actually quite godly.

"i assure you," langdon said, "despite what you see in the movies, the pentacle's demonic
interpretation is historically inaccurate. the original feminine meaning is correct, but the
symbolism of the pentacle has been distorted over the millennia. in this case, through bloodshed."

"i'm not sure i follow."

langdon glanced at fache's crucifix, uncertain how to phrase his next point. "the church, sir.
symbols are very resilient, but the pentacle was altered by the early roman catholic church. as
part of the vatican's campaign to eradicate pagan religions and convert the masses to christianity,
the church launched a smear campaign against the pagan gods and goddesses, recasting their
divine symbols as evil. "

"goon."

"this is very common in times of turmoil," langdon continued. "a newly emerging power will



take over the existing symbols and degrade them over time in an attempt to erase their meaning. in
the battle between the pagan symbols and christian symbols, the pagans lost; poseidon's trident
became the devil's pitchfork, the wise crone's pointed hat became the symbol of a witch, and
venus's pentacle became a sign of the devil." langdon paused. "unfortunately, the united states
military has also perverted the pentacle; it's now our foremost symbol of war. we paint it on all our
fighter jets and hang it on the shoulders of all our generals." so much for the goddess of love and
beauty.

"interesting." fache nodded toward the spread-eagle corpse. "and the positioning of the body?
what do you make of that?"

langdon shrugged. "the position simply reinforces the reference to the pentacle and sacred
feminine."

fache's expression clouded. "i beg your pardon?"

"replication. repeating a symbol is the simplest way to strengthen its meaning. jacques sauniere
positioned himself in the shape of a five-pointed star." if one pentacle is good, two is better.

fache's eyes followed the five points of sauniere's arms, legs, and head as he again ran a hand
across his slick hair. "interesting analysis." he paused. "and the nudity?" he grumbled as he spoke
the word, sounding repulsed by the sight of an aging male body. "why did he remove his
clothing?"

damned good question, langdon thought. he'd been wondering the same thing ever since he first
saw the polaroid. his best guess was that a naked human form was yet another endorsement of
venus — the goddess of human sexuality. although modern culture had erased much of venus's
association with the male/female physical union, a sharp etymological eye could still spot a vestige
of venus's original meaning in the word "venereal." langdon decided not to go there.

"mr. fache, i obviously can't tell you why mr. sauniere drew that symbol on himself or placed
himself in this way, but i can tell you that a man like jacques sauniere would consider the pentacle
a sign of the female deity. the correlation between this symbol and the sacred feminine is widely
known by art historians and symbologists."

"fine. and the use of his own blood as ink?"

"obviously he had nothing else to write with."

fache was silent a moment. "actually, i believe he used blood such that the police would follow
certain forensic procedures."

"i'm sorry?"



"look at his left hand."

langdon's eyes traced the length of the curator's pale arm to his left hand but saw nothing.
uncertain, he circled the corpse and crouched down, now noting with surprise that the curator was
clutching a large, felt-tipped marker.

"sauniere was holding it when we found him," fache said, leaving langdon and moving several
yards to a portable table covered with investigation tools, cables, and assorted electronic gear. "as
i told you," he said, rummaging around the table, "we have touched nothing. are you familiar with
this kind of pen?"

langdon knelt down farther to see the pen's label.

stylo de lumiere noire.

he glanced up in surprise.

the black-light pen or watermark stylus was a specialized felt-tipped marker originally designed
by museums, restorers, and forgery police to place invisible marks on items. the stylus wrote in a
noncorrosive, alcohol-based fluorescent ink that was visible only under black light. nowadays,
museum maintenance staffs carried these markers on their daily rounds to place invisible "tick
marks" on the frames of paintings that needed restoration.

as langdon stood up, fache walked over to the spotlight and turned it off. the gallery plunged
into sudden darkness.

momentarily blinded, langdon felt a rising uncertainty. fache's silhouette appeared, illuminated in
bright purple. he approached carrying a portable light source, which shrouded him in a violet haze.

"as you may know," fache said, his eyes luminescing in the violet glow, "police use black-light
illumination to search crime scenes for blood and other forensic evidence. so you can imagine our
surprise..." abruptly, he pointed the light down at the corpse.

langdon looked down and jumped back in shock.

his heart pounded as he took in the bizarre sight now glowing before him on the parquet floor.
scrawled in luminescent handwriting, the curator's final words glowed purple beside his corpse. as
langdon stared at the shimmering text, he felt the fog that had surrounded this entire night growing
thicker.

langdon read the message again and looked up at fache. "what the hell does this mean!"

fache's eyes shone white. "that, monsieur, is precisely the question you are here to answer."



not far away, inside sauniere's office, lieutenant collet had returned to the louvre and was
huddled over an audio console set up on the curator's enormous desk. with the exception of the
eerie, robot-like doll of a medieval knight that seemed to be staring at him from the corner of
sauniere's desk, collet was comfortable. he adjusted his akg headphones and checked the input
levels on the hard-disk recording system. all systems were go. the microphones were functioning
flawlessly, and the audio feed was crystal clear.

he moment de verite, he mused.

smiling, he closed his eyes and settled in to enjoy the rest of the conversation now being taped
inside the grand gallery.



chapter 7

the modest dwelling within the church of saint-sulpice was located on the second floor of the
church itself, to the left of the choir balcony. a two-room suite with a stone floor and minimal
furnishings, it had been home to sister sandrine bieil for over a decade. the nearby convent was
her formal residence, if anyone asked, but she preferred the quiet of the church and had made
herself quite comfortable upstairs with a bed, phone, and hot plate.

as the church's conservatrice d'affaires, sister sandrine was responsible for overseeing all
nonreligious aspects of church operations — general maintenance, hiring support staff and guides,
securing the building after hours, and ordering supplies like communion wine and wafers.

tonight, asleep in her small bed, she awoke to the shrill of her telephone. tiredly, she lifted the
receiver.

"soeur sandrine. eglise saint-sulpice. "

"hello, sister," the man said in french.

sister sandrine sat up. what time is it? although she recognized her boss's voice, in fifteen years
she had never been awoken by him. the abbe was a deeply pious man who went home to bed
immediately after mass.

"i apologize if i have awoken you, sister," the abbe said, his own voice sounding groggy and on
edge. "i have a favor to ask of you. i just received a call from an influential american bishop.



perhaps you know him? manuel aringarosa?"

"the head of opus dei?" of course i know of him. who in the church doesn't? aringarosa's
conservative prelature had grown powerful in recent years. their ascension to grace was jump-
started in 1982 when pope john paul ii unexpectedly elevated them to a "personal prelature of the
pope," officially sanctioning all of their practices. suspiciously, opus dei's elevation occurred the
same year the wealthy sect allegedly had transferred almost one billion dollars into the vatican's
institute for religious works — commonly known as the vatican bank — bailing it out of an
embarrassing bankruptcy. in a second maneuver that raised eyebrows, the pope placed the founder
of opus dei on the "fast track" for sainthood, accelerating an often century-long waiting period for
canonization to a mere twenty years. sister sandrine could not help but feel that opus dei's good
standing in rome was suspect, but one did not argue with the holy see.

"bishop aringarosa called to ask me a favor," the abbe told her, his voice nervous. "one of his
numeraries is in paris tonight...."

as sister sandrine listened to the odd request, she felt a deepening confusion. "i'm sorry, you say
this visiting opus dei numerary cannot wait until morning?"

"i'm afraid not. his plane leaves very early. he has always dreamed of seeing saint-sulpice."

"but the church is far more interesting by day. the sun's rays through the oculus, the graduated
shadows on the gnomon, this is what makes saint-sulpice unique."

"sister, i agree, and yet i would consider it a personal favor if you could let him in tonight. he can
be there at... say one o'clock? that's in twenty minutes."

sister sandrine frowned. "of course. it would be my pleasure."

the abbe thanked her and hung up.

puzzled, sister sandrine remained a moment in the warmth of her bed, trying to shake off the
cobwebs of sleep. her sixty-year-old body did not awake as fast as it used to, although tonight's
phone call had certainly roused her senses. opus dei had always made her uneasy. beyond the
prelature's adherence to the arcane ritual of corporal mortification, their views on women were
medieval at best. she had been shocked to learn that female numeraries were forced to clean the
men's residence halls for no pay while the men were at mass; women slept on hardwood floors,
while the men had straw mats; and women were forced to endure additional requirements of
corporal mortification... all as added penance for original sin. it seemed eve's bite from the apple
of knowledge was a debt women were doomed to pay for eternity. sadly, while most of the
catholic church was gradually moving in the right direction with respect to women's rights, opus
dei threatened to reverse the progress. even so, sister sandrine had her orders.



swinging her legs off the bed, she stood slowly, chilled by the cold stone on the soles of her bare
feet. as the chill rose through her flesh, she felt an unexpected apprehension.

women's intuition?

a follower of god, sister sandrine had learned to find peace in the calming voices of her own soul.
tonight, however, those voices were as silent as the empty church around her.



chapter 8

langdon couldn't tear his eyes from the glowing purple text scrawled across the parquet floor.
jacques sauniere's final communication seemed as unlikely a departing message as any langdon
could imagine.



the message read:



13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5

o, draconian devil !

oh, lame saint!



although langdon had not the slightest idea what it meant, he did understand fache's instinct that
the pentacle had something to do with devil worship.

o, draconian devil!

sauniere had left a literal reference to the devil. equally as bizarre was the series of numbers. "part
of it looks like a numeric cipher. "

"yes," fache said. "our cryptographers are already working on it. we believe these numbers may
be the key to who killed him. maybe a telephone exchange or some kind of social identification.
do the numbers have any symbolic meaning to you?"

langdon looked again at the digits, sensing it would take him hours to extract any symbolic
meaning. if sauniere had even intended any. to langdon, the numbers looked totally random. he
was accustomed to symbolic progressions that made some semblance of sense, but everything
here — the pentacle, the text, the numbers — seemed disparate at the most fundamental level.

"you alleged earlier," fache said, "that sauniere's actions here were all in an effort to send some
sort of message... goddess worship or something in that vein? how does this message fit in?"



langdon knew the question was rhetorical. this bizarre communique obviously did not fit
langdon's scenario of goddess worship at all.

o, draconian devil? oh, lame saint?

fache said, "this text appears to be an accusation of some sort. wouldn't you agree?"

langdon tried to imagine the curator's final minutes trapped alone in the grand gallery, knowing
he was about to die. it seemed logical. "an accusation against his murderer makes sense, i
suppose."

"my job, of course, is to put a name to that person. let me ask you this, mr. langdon. to your eye,
beyond the numbers, what about this message is most strange?"

most strange? a dying man had barricaded himself in the gallery, drawn a pentacle on himself, and
scrawled a mysterious accusation on the floor. what about the scenario wasn't strange?

"the word 'draconian'?" he ventured, offering the first thing that came to mind. langdon was
fairly certain that a reference to draco — the ruthless seventh-century b.c. politician — was an
unlikely dying thought. " 'draconian devil' seems an odd choice of vocabulary."

"draconian?" fache's tone came with a tinge of impatience now. "sauniere's choice of vocabulary
hardly seems the primary issue here."

langdon wasn't sure what issue fache had in mind, but he was starting to suspect that draco and
fache would have gotten along well.

"sauniere was a frenchman," fache said flatly. "he lived in paris. and yet he chose to write this
message..."

"in english," langdon said, now realizing the captain's meaning.

fache nodded. "precisement. any idea why?"

langdon knew sauniere spoke impeccable english, and yet the reason he had chosen english as
the language in which to write his final words escaped langdon. he shrugged.

fache motioned back to the pentacle on sauniere's abdomen. "nothing to do with devil worship?
are you still certain?"

langdon was certain of nothing anymore. "the symbology and text don't seem to coincide. i'm
sorry i can't be of more help."



"perhaps this will clarify." fache backed away from the body and raised the black light again,
letting the beam spread out in a wider angle. "and now?"

to langdon's amazement, a rudimentary circle glowed around the curator's body. sauniere had
apparently lay down and swung the pen around himself in several long arcs, essentially inscribing
himself inside a circle.

in a flash, the meaning became clear.

"the vitruvian man, " langdon gasped. sauniere had created a life-sized replica of leonardo da
vinci's most famous sketch.

considered the most anatomically correct drawing of its day, da vinci's the vitruvian man had
become a modern-day icon of culture, appearing on posters, mouse pads, and t-shirts around the
world. the celebrated sketch consisted of a perfect circle in which was inscribed a nude male... his
arms and legs outstretched in a naked spread eagle.

da vinci. langdon felt a shiver of amazement. the clarity of sauniere's intentions could not be
denied. in his final moments of life, the curator had stripped off his clothing and arranged his body
in a clear image of leonardo da vinci's vitruvian man.

the circle had been the missing critical element. a feminine symbol of protection, the circle
around the naked man's body completed da vinci's intended message — male and female harmony.
the question now, though, was why sauniere would imitate a famous drawing.

"mr. langdon," fache said, "certainly a man like yourself is aware that leonardo da vinci had a
tendency toward the darker arts."

langdon was surprised by fache's knowledge of da vinci, and it certainly went a long way toward
explaining the captain's suspicions about devil worship. da vinci had always been an awkward
subject for historians, especially in the christian tradition. despite the visionary's genius, he was a
flamboyant homosexual and worshipper of nature's divine order, both of which placed him in a
perpetual state of sin against god. moreover, the artist's eerie eccentricities projected an admittedly
demonic aura: da vinci exhumed corpses to study human anatomy; he kept mysterious journals in
illegible reverse handwriting; he believed he possessed the alchemic power to turn lead into gold
and even cheat god by creating an elixir to postpone death; and his inventions included horrific,
never-before-imagined weapons of war and torture.

misunderstanding breeds distrust, langdon thought.

even da vinci's enormous output of breathtaking christian art only furthered the artist's reputation
for spiritual hypocrisy. accepting hundreds of lucrative vatican commissions, da vinci painted
christian themes not as an expression of his own beliefs but rather as a commercial venture — a



means of funding a lavish lifestyle. unfortunately, da vinci was a prankster who often amused
himself by quietly gnawing at the hand that fed him. he incorporated in many of his christian
paintings hidden symbolism that was anything but christian — tributes to his own beliefs and a
subtle thumbing of his nose at the church. langdon had even given a lecture once at the national
gallery in london entitled: "the secret life of leonardo: pagan symbolism in christian art."

"i understand your concerns," langdon now said, "but da vinci never really practiced any dark
arts. he was an exceptionally spiritual man, albeit one in constant conflict with the church." as
langdon said this, an odd thought popped into his mind. he glanced down at the message on the
floor again. o, draconian devil! oh, lame saint!

"yes?" fache said.

langdon weighed his words carefully. "i was just thinking that sauniere shared a lot of spiritual
ideologies with da vinci, including a concern over the church's elimination of the sacred feminine
from modern religion. maybe, by imitating a famous da vinci drawing, sauniere was simply
echoing some of their shared frustrations with the modern church's demonization of the goddess."

fache's eyes hardened. "you think sauniere is calling the church a lame saint and a draconian
devil?"

langdon had to admit it seemed far-fetched, and yet the pentacle seemed to endorse the idea on
some level. "all i am saying is that mr. sauniere dedicated his life to studying the history of the
goddess, and nothing has done more to erase that history than the catholic church. it seems
reasonable that sauniere might have chosen to express his disappointment in his final good-bye."

"disappointment?" fache demanded, sounding hostile now. "this message sounds more enraged
than disappointed, wouldn't you say?"

langdon was reaching the end of his patience. "captain, you asked for my instincts as to what
sauniere is trying to say here, and that's what i'm giving you."

"that this is an indictment of the church?" fache's jaw tightened as he spoke through clenched
teeth. "mr. langdon, i have seen a lot of death in my work, and let me tell you something. when a
man is murdered by another man, i do not believe his final thoughts are to write an obscure
spiritual statement that no one will understand. i believe he is thinking of one thing only." fache's
whispery voice sliced the air. "la vengeance. i believe sauniere wrote this note to tell us who
killed him." langdon stared. "but that makes no sense whatsoever."

"no?"

"no," he fired back, tired and frustrated. "you told me sauniere was attacked in his office by
someone he had apparently invited in."



"yes."

"so it seems reasonable to conclude that the curator knew his attacker."

fache nodded. "go on."

"so if sauniere knew the person who killed him, what kind of indictment is this?" he pointed at the
floor. "numeric codes? lame saints? draconian devils? pentacles on his stomach? it's all too
cryptic."

fache frowned as if the idea had never occurred to him. "you have a point."

"considering the circumstances," langdon said, "i would assume that if sauniere wanted to tell
you who killed him, he would have written down somebody's name. "

as langdon spoke those words, a smug smile crossed fache's lips for the first time all night.
"precisement, " fache said. "precisement. "



i am witnessing the work of a master, mused lieutenant collet as he tweaked his audio gear and
listened to fache's voice coming through the headphones. the agent superieur knew it was
moments like these that had lifted the captain to the pinnacle of french law enforcement.

fache will do what no one else dares.

the delicate art of cajoler was a lost skill in modern law enforcement, one that required
exceptional poise under pressure. few men possessed the necessary sangfroid for this kind of
operation, but fache seemed born for it. his restraint and patience bordered on the robotic.

fache's sole emotion this evening seemed to be one of intense resolve, as if this arrest were
somehow personal to him. fache's briefing of his agents an hour ago had been unusually succinct
and assured. / know who murdered jacques sauniere, fache had said. you know what to do. no
mistakes tonight.

and so far, no mistakes had been made.

collet was not yet privy to the evidence that had cemented fache's certainty of their suspect's guilt,
but he knew better than to question the instincts of the bull. fache's intuition seemed almost
supernatural at times. god whispers in his ear, one agent had insisted after a particularly
impressive display of fache's sixth sense. collet had to admit, if there was a god, bezu fache
would be on his a-list. the captain attended mass and confession with zealous regularity — far
more than the requisite holiday attendance fulfilled by other officials in the name of good public



relations. when the pope visited paris a few years back, fache had used all his muscle to obtain the
honor of an audience. a photo of fache with the pope now hung in his office. the papal bull, the
agents secretly called it.

collet found it ironic that one of fache's rare popular public stances in recent years had been his
outspoken reaction to the catholic pedophilia scandal. these priests should be hanged twice! fache
had declared. once for their crimes against children. and once for shaming the good name of the
catholic church. collet had the odd sense it was the latter that angered fache more.

turning now to his laptop computer, collet attended to the other half of his responsibilities here
tonight — the gps tracking system. the image onscreen revealed a detailed floor plan of the denon
wing, a structural schematic uploaded from the louvre security office. letting his eyes trace the
maze of galleries and hallways, collet found what he was looking for.

deep in the heart of the grand gallery blinked a tiny red dot.

la marque.

fache was keeping his prey on a very tight leash tonight. wisely so. robert langdon had proven
himself one cool customer.



chapter 9

to ensure his conversation with mr. langdon would not be interrupted, bezu fache had turned off
his cellular phone. unfortunately, it was an expensive model equipped with a two-way radio
feature, which, contrary to his orders, was now being used by one of his agents to page him.

"capitaine?" the phone crackled like a walkie-talkie.

fache felt his teeth clench in rage. he could imagine nothing important enough that collet would
interrupt this surveillance cachee — especially at this critical juncture.

he gave langdon a calm look of apology. "one moment please." he pulled the phone from his belt
and pressed the radio transmission button. "oui?"

"capitaine, un agent du departement de cryptographic est arrive. "

fache's anger stalled momentarily. a cryptographer? despite the lousy timing, this was probably
good news. fache, after finding sauniere's cryptic text on the floor, had uploaded photographs of
the entire crime scene to the cryptography department in hopes someone there could tell him what



the hell sauniere was trying to say. if a code breaker had now arrived, it most likely meant
someone had decrypted sauniere's message.

"i'm busy at the moment," fache radioed back, leaving no doubt in his tone that a line had been
crossed. "ask the cryptographer to wait at the command post. i'll speak to him when i'm done."

"her, " the voice corrected. "it's agent neveu."

fache was becoming less amused with this call every passing moment. sophie neveu was one of
dcpj's biggest mistakes. a young parisian dechiffreuse who had studied cryptography in england
at the royal holloway, sophie neveu had been foisted on fache two years ago as part of the
ministry's attempt to incorporate more women into the police force. the ministry's ongoing foray
into political correctness, fache argued, was weakening the department. women not only lacked
the physicality necessary for police work, but their mere presence posed a dangerous distraction to
the men in the field. as fache had feared, sophie neveu was proving far more distracting than
most.

at thirty-two years old, she had a dogged determination that bordered on obstinate. her eager
espousal of britain's new cryptologic methodology continually exasperated the veteran french
cryptographers above her. and by far the most troubling to fache was the inescapable universal
truth that in an office of middle-aged men, an attractive young woman always drew eyes away
from the work at hand.

the man on the radio said, "agent neveu insisted on speaking to you immediately, captain. i tried
to stop her, but she's on her way into the gallery. "

fache recoiled in disbelief. "unacceptable! i made it very clear — "



for a moment, robert langdon thought bezu fache was suffering a stroke. the captain was mid-
sentence when his jaw stopped moving and his eyes bulged. his blistering gaze seemed fixated on
something over langdon's shoulder. before langdon could turn to see what it was, he heard a
woman's voice chime out behind him.

"excusez-moi, messieurs. "

langdon turned to see a young woman approaching. she was moving down the corridor toward
them with long, fluid strides... a haunting certainty to her gait. dressed casually in a knee-length,
cream-colored irish sweater over black leggings, she was attractive and looked to be about thirty.
her thick burgundy hair fell unstyled to her shoulders, framing the warmth of her face. unlike the
waifish, cookie-cutter blondes that adorned harvard dorm room walls, this woman was healthy
with an unembellished beauty and genuineness that radiated a striking personal confidence.



to langdon's surprise, the woman walked directly up to him and extended a polite hand.
"monsieur langdon, i am agent neveu from dcpj's cryptology department." her words curved
richly around her muted anglo-franco accent. "it is a pleasure to meet you."

langdon took her soft palm in his and felt himself momentarily fixed in her strong gaze. her eyes
were olive-green — incisive and clear.

fache drew a seething inhalation, clearly preparing to launch into a reprimand.

"captain," she said, turning quickly and beating him to the punch, "please excuse the interruption,
but—"

"ce n 'est pas le moment!" fache sputtered.

"i tried to phone you." sophie continued in english, as if out of courtesy to langdon. "but your
cell phone was turned off. "

"i turned it off for a reason," fache hissed. "i am speaking to mr. langdon."

"i've deciphered the numeric code," she said flatly.

langdon felt a pulse of excitement. she broke the code ?

fache looked uncertain how to respond.

"before i explain," sophie said, "i have an urgent message for mr. langdon."

fache's expression turned to one of deepening concern. "for mr. langdon?"

she nodded, turning back to langdon. "you need to contact the u.s. embassy, mr. langdon. they
have a message for you from the states."

langdon reacted with surprise, his excitement over the code giving way to a sudden ripple of
concern. a message from the states? he tried to imagine who could be trying to reach him. only a
few of his colleagues knew he was in paris.

fache's broad jaw had tightened with the news. "the u.s. embassy?" he demanded, sounding
suspicious. "how would they know to find mr. langdon here?"

sophie shrugged. "apparently they called mr. langdon's hotel, and the concierge told them mr.
langdon had been collected by a dcpj agent."

fache looked troubled. "and the embassy contacted dcpj cryptography?"



"no, sir," sophie said, her voice firm. "when i called the dcpj switchboard in an attempt to
contact you, they had a message waiting for mr. langdon and asked me to pass it along if i got
through to you."

fache's brow furrowed in apparent confusion. he opened his mouth to speak, but sophie had
already turned back to langdon.

"mr. langdon," she declared, pulling a small slip of paper from her pocket, "this is the number for
your embassy's messaging service. they asked that you phone in as soon as possible." she handed
him the paper with an intent gaze. "while i explain the code to captain fache, you need to make
this call."

langdon studied the slip. it had a paris phone number and extension on it. "thank you," he said,
feeling worried now. "where do i find a phone?"

sophie began to pull a cell phone from her sweater pocket, but fache waved her off. he now
looked like mount vesuvius about to erupt. without taking his eyes off sophie, he produced his
own cell phone and held it out. "this line is secure, mr. langdon. you may use it."

langdon felt mystified by fache's anger with the young woman. feeling uneasy, he accepted the
captain's phone. fache immediately marched sophie several steps away and began chastising her in
hushed tones. disliking the captain more and more, langdon turned away from the odd
confrontation and switched on the cell phone. checking the slip of paper sophie had given him,
langdon dialed the number.

the line began to ring.

one ring... two rings... three rings...

finally the call connected.

langdon expected to hear an embassy operator, but he found himself instead listening to an
answering machine. oddly, the voice on the tape was familiar. it was that of sophie neveu.

"bonjour, vous etes bien chez sophie neveu, " the woman's voice said. "je suis absenle pour le
moment, mais..."

confused, langdon turned back toward sophie. "i'm sorry, ms. neveu? i think you may have
given me — "

"no, that's the right number," sophie interjected quickly, as if anticipating langdon's confusion.
"the embassy has an automated message system. you have to dial an access code to pick up your



messages.

langdon stared. "but — "

"it's the three-digit code on the paper i gave you."

langdon opened his mouth to explain the bizarre error, but sophie flashed him a silencing glare
that lasted only an instant. her green eyes sent a crystal-clear message.

don 't ask questions. just do it.

bewildered, langdon punched in the extension on the slip of paper: 454.

sophie's outgoing message immediately cut off, and langdon heard an electronic voice announce
in french: "you have one new message." apparently, 454 was sophie's remote access code for
picking up her messages while away from home.

i'm picking up this woman's messages?

langdon could hear the tape rewinding now. finally, it stopped, and the machine engaged.
langdon listened as the message began to play. again, the voice on the line was sophie's.

"mr. langdon," the message began in a fearful whisper. "do not react to this message. just listen
calmly. you are in danger right now. follow my directions very closely."



chapter 10

silas sat behind the wheel of the black audi the teacher had arranged for him and gazed out at the
great church of saint-sulpice. lit from beneath by banks of floodlights, the church's two bell
towers rose like stalwart sentinels above the building's long body. on either flank, a shadowy row
of sleek buttresses jutted out like the ribs of a beautiful beast.

the heathens used a house of god to conceal their keystone. again the brotherhood had confirmed
their legendary reputation for illusion and deceit. silas was looking forward to finding the keystone
and giving it to the teacher so they could recover what the brotherhood had long ago stolen from
the faithful.

how powerful that will make opus dei.

parking the audi on the deserted place saint-sulpice, silas exhaled, telling himself to clear his
mind for the task at hand. his broad back still ached from the corporal mortification he had



endured earlier today, and yet the pain was inconsequential compared with the anguish of his life
before opus dei had saved him.

still, the memories haunted his soul.

release your hatred, silas commanded himself. forgive those who trespassed against you.

looking up at the stone towers of saint-sulpice, silas fought that familiar undertow... that force
that often dragged his mind back in time, locking him once again in the prison that had been his
world as a young man. the memories of purgatory came as they always did, like a tempest to his
senses... the reek of rotting cabbage, the stench of death, human urine and feces. the cries of
hopelessness against the howling wind of the pyrenees and the soft sobs of forgotten men.

andorra, he thought, feeling his muscles tighten.

incredibly, it was in that barren and forsaken suzerain between spain and france, shivering in his
stone cell, wanting only to die, that silas had been saved.

he had not realized it at the time.

the light came long after the thunder.

his name was not silas then, although he didn't recall the name his parents had given him. he had
left home when he was seven. his drunken father, a burly dockworker, enraged by the arrival of an
albino son, beat his mother regularly, blaming her for the boy's embarrassing condition. when the
boy tried to defend her, he too was badly beaten.

one night, there was a horrific fight, and his mother never got up. the boy stood over his lifeless
mother and felt an unbearable up-welling of guilt for permitting it to happen.

this is my fault!

as if some kind of demon were controlling his body, the boy walked to the kitchen and grasped a
butcher knife. hypnotically, he moved to the bedroom where his father lay on the bed in a drunken
stupor. without a word, the boy stabbed him in the back. his father cried out in pain and tried to
roll over, but his son stabbed him again, over and over until the apartment fell quiet.

the boy fled home but found the streets of marseilles equally unfriendly. his strange appearance
made him an outcast among the other young runaways, and he was forced to live alone in the
basement of a dilapidated factory, eating stolen fruit and raw fish from the dock. his only
companions were tattered magazines he found in the trash, and he taught himself to read them.
over time, he grew strong. when he was twelve, another drifter — a girl twice his age — mocked
him on the streets and attempted to steal his food. the girl found herself pummeled to within



inches of her life. when the authorities pulled the boy off her, they gave him an ultimatum — leave
marseilles or go to juvenile prison.

the boy moved down the coast to toulon. over time, the looks of pity on the streets turned to
looks of fear. the boy had grown to a powerful young man. when people passed by, he could hear
them whispering to one another. a ghost, they would say, their eyes wide with fright as they stared
at his white skin. a ghost with the eyes of a devil!

and he felt like a ghost... transparent... floating from seaport to seaport.

people seemed to look right through him.

at eighteen, in a port town, while attempting to steal a case of cured ham from a cargo ship, he was
caught by a pair of crewmen. the two sailors who began to beat him smelled of beer, just as his
father had. the memories of fear and hatred surfaced like a monster from the deep. the young man
broke the first sailor's neck with his bare hands, and only the arrival of the police saved the second
sailor from a similar fate.

two months later, in shackles, he arrived at a prison in andorra.

you are as white as a ghost, the inmates ridiculed as the guards marched him in, naked and cold.
mira el espectro! perhaps the ghost will pass right through these walls!

over the course of twelve years, his flesh and soul withered until he knew he had become
transparent.

/ am a ghost.

i am weightless.

yo soy un espectro... palido coma unafantasma... caminando este mundo a solas.

one night the ghost awoke to the screams of other inmates. he didn't know what invisible force
was shaking the floor on which he slept, nor what mighty hand was trembling the mortar of his
stone cell, but as he jumped to his feet, a large boulder toppled onto the very spot where he had
been sleeping. looking up to see where the stone had come from, he saw a hole in the trembling
wall, and beyond it, a vision he had not seen in over ten years. the moon.

even while the earth still shook, the ghost found himself scrambling through a narrow tunnel,
staggering out into an expansive vista, and tumbling down a barren mountainside into the woods.
he ran all night, always downward, delirious with hunger and exhaustion.

skirting the edges of consciousness, he found himself at dawn in a clearing where train tracks cut a



swath across the forest. following the rails, he moved on as if dreaming. seeing an empty freight
car, he crawled in for shelter and rest. when he awoke the train was moving. how long? how far?
a pain was growing in his gut. am i dying ? he slept again. this time he awoke to someone yelling,
beating him, throwing him out of the freight car. bloody, he wandered the outskirts of a small
village looking in vain for food. finally, his body too weak to take another step, he lay down by the
side of the road and slipped into unconsciousness.

the light came slowly, and the ghost wondered how long he had been dead. a day? three days? it
didn't matter. his bed was soft like a cloud, and the air around him smelled sweet with candles.
jesus was there, staring down at him. / am here, jesus said. the stone has been rolled aside, and
you are born again.

he slept and awoke. fog shrouded his thoughts. he had never believed in heaven, and yet jesus
was watching over him. food appeared beside his bed, and the ghost ate it, almost able to feel the
flesh materializing on his bones. he slept again. when he awoke, jesus was still smiling down,
speaking. you are saved, my son. blessed are those who follow my path.

again, he slept.

it was a scream of anguish that startled the ghost from his slumber. his body leapt out of bed,
staggered down a hallway toward the sounds of shouting. he entered into a kitchen and saw a large
man beating a smaller man. without knowing why, the ghost grabbed the large man and hurled him
backward against a wall. the man fled, leaving the ghost standing over the body of a young man in
priest's robes. the priest had a badly shattered nose. lifting the bloody priest, the ghost carried him
to a couch.

"thank you, my friend," the priest said in awkward french. "the offertory money is tempting for
thieves. you speak french in your sleep. do you also speak spanish?"

the ghost shook his head.

"what is your name?" he continued in broken french.

the ghost could not remember the name his parents had given him. all he heard were the taunting
gibes of the prison guards.

the priest smiled. "no hay problema. my name is manuel aringarosa. i am a missionary from
madrid. i was sent here to build a church for the obra de dios."

"where am i?" his voice sounded hollow.

"oviedo. in the north of spain."



"how did i get here?"

"someone left you on my doorstep. you were ill. i fed you. you've been here many days."

the ghost studied his young caretaker. years had passed since anyone had shown any kindness.
"thank you, father."

the priest touched his bloody lip. "it is i who am thankful, my friend."

when the ghost awoke in the morning, his world felt clearer. he gazed up at the crucifix on the
wall above his bed. although it no longer spoke to him, he felt a comforting aura in its presence.
sitting up, he was surprised to find a newspaper clipping on his bedside table. the article was in
french, a week old. when he read the story, he filled with fear. it told of an earthquake in the
mountains that had destroyed a prison and freed many dangerous criminals.

his heart began pounding. the priest knows who i am! the emotion he felt was one he had not felt
for some time. shame. guilt. it was accompanied by the fear of being caught. he jumped from his
bed. where do i run ?

"the book of acts," a voice said from the door.

the ghost turned, frightened.

the young priest was smiling as he entered. his nose was awkwardly bandaged, and he was
holding out an old bible. "i found one in french for you. the chapter is marked."

uncertain, the ghost took the bible and looked at the chapter the priest had marked.

acts 16.

the verses told of a prisoner named silas who lay naked and beaten in his cell, singing hymns to
god. when the ghost reached verse 26, he gasped in shock.

" ...and suddenly, there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken,
and all the doors fell open. "

his eyes shot up at the priest.

the priest smiled warmly. "from now on, my friend, if you have no other name, i shall call you
silas."

the ghost nodded blankly. silas. he had been given flesh. my name is silas.



"it's time for breakfast," the priest said. "you will need your strength if you are to help me build
this church."



twenty thousand feet above the mediterranean, alitalia flight 1618 bounced in turbulence, causing
passengers to shift nervously. bishop aringarosa barely noticed. his thoughts were with the future
of opus dei. eager to know how plans in paris were progressing, he wished he could phone silas.
but he could not. the teacher had seen to that.

"it is for your own safety," the teacher had explained, speaking in english with a french accent. "i
am familiar enough with electronic communications to know they can be intercepted. the results
could be disastrous for you. "

aringarosa knew he was right. the teacher seemed an exceptionally careful man. he had not
revealed his own identity to aringarosa, and yet he had proven himself a man well worth obeying.
after all, he had somehow obtained very secret information. the names of the brotherhood' s four
top members! this had been one of the coups that convinced the bishop the teacher was truly
capable of delivering the astonishing prize he claimed he could unearth.

"bishop," the teacher had told him, "i have made all the arrangements. for my plan to succeed,
you must allow silas to answer only to me for several days. the two of you will not speak. i will
communicate with him through secure channels."

"you will treat him with respect?"

"a man of faith deserves the highest."

"excellent. then i understand. silas and i shall not speak until this is over."

"i do this to protect your identity, silas's identity, and my investment."

"your investment?"

"bishop, if your own eagerness to keep abreast of progress puts you in jail, then you will be unable
to pay me my fee."

the bishop smiled. "a fine point. our desires are in accord. godspeed."

twenty million euro, the bishop thought, now gazing out the plane's window. the sum was
approximately the same number of u.s. dollars. a pittance for something so powerful.

he felt a renewed confidence that the teacher and silas would not fail. money and faith were



powerful motivators.



chapter 11

"une plaisanterie numerique?" bezu fache was livid, glaring at sophie neveu in disbelief. a
numeric joke? "your professional assessment of sauniere's code is that it is some kind of
mathematical prank?"

fache was in utter incomprehension of this woman's gall. not only had she just barged in on fache
without permission, but she was now trying to convince him that sauniere, in his final moments of
life, had been inspired to leave a mathematical gag?

"this code," sophie explained in rapid french, "is simplistic to the point of absurdity. jacques
sauniere must have known we would see through it immediately." she pulled a scrap of paper from
her sweater pocket and handed it to fache. "here is the decryption."

fache looked at the card.

1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21



"this is it?" he snapped. "all you did was put the numbers in increasing order!"

sophie actually had the nerve to give a satisfied smile. "exactly."

fache's tone lowered to a guttural rumble. "agent neveu, i have no idea where the hell you're
going with this, but i suggest you get there fast." he shot an anxious glance at langdon, who stood
nearby with the phone pressed to his ear, apparently still listening to his phone message from the
u.s. embassy. from langdon's ashen expression, fache sensed the news was bad.

"captain," sophie said, her tone dangerously defiant, "the sequence of numbers you have in your
hand happens to be one of the most famous mathematical progressions in history."

fache was not aware there even existed a mathematical progression that qualified as famous, and
he certainly didn't appreciate sophie's off-handed tone.

"this is the fibonacci sequence," she declared, nodding toward the piece of paper in fache's hand.
"a progression in which each term is equal to the sum of the two preceding terms."

fache studied the numbers. each term was indeed the sum of the two previous, and yet fache
could not imagine what the relevance of all this was to sauniere's death.



"mathematician leonardo fibonacci created this succession of numbers in the thirteenth-century.
obviously there can be no coincidence that all of the numbers sauniere wrote on the floor belong
to fibonacci's famous sequence."

fache stared at the young woman for several moments. "fine, if there is no coincidence, would you
tell me why jacques sauniere chose to do this. what is he saying? what does this mean?"

she shrugged. "absolutely nothing. that's the point. it's a simplistic cryptographic joke. like
taking the words of a famous poem and shuffling them at random to see if anyone recognizes what
all the words have in common."

fache took a menacing step forward, placing his face only inches from sophie's. "i certainly hope
you have a much more satisfying explanation than that. "

sophie's soft features grew surprisingly stern as she leaned in. "captain, considering what you have
at stake here tonight, i thought you might appreciate knowing that jacques sauniere might be
playing games with you. apparently not. i'll inform the director of cryptography you no longer
need our services."

with that, she turned on her heel, and marched off the way she had come.

stunned, fache watched her disappear into the darkness. is she out of her mind? sophie neveu had
just redefined le suicide professionnel.

fache turned to langdon, who was still on the phone, looking more concerned than before,
listening intently to his phone message. the u.s. embassy. bezu fache despised many things... but
few drew more wrath than the u.s. embassy.

fache and the ambassador locked horns regularly over shared affairs of state — their most common
battleground being law enforcement for visiting americans. almost daily, dcpj arrested american
exchange students in possession of drugs, u.s. businessmen for soliciting underage prostitutes,
american tourists for shoplifting or destruction of property. legally, the u.s. embassy could
intervene and extradite guilty citizens back to the united states, where they received nothing more
than a slap on the wrist.

and the embassy invariably did just that.

l 'emasculation de la police judiciaire, fache called it. paris match had run a cartoon recently
depicting fache as a police dog, trying to bite an american criminal, but unable to reach because it
was chained to the u.s. embassy.

not tonight, fache told himself. there is far too much at stake.



by the time robert langdon hung up the phone, he looked ill.

"is everything all right?" fache asked.

weakly, langdon shook his head.

bad news from home, fache sensed, noticing langdon was sweating slightly as fache took back
his cell phone.

"an accident," langdon stammered, looking at fache with a strange expression. "a friend..." he
hesitated. "i'll need to fly home first thing in the morning."

fache had no doubt the shock on langdon's face was genuine, and yet he sensed another emotion
there too, as if a distant fear were suddenly simmering in the american's eyes. "i'm sorry to hear
that," fache said, watching langdon closely. "would you like to sit down?" he motioned toward
one of the viewing benches in the gallery.

langdon nodded absently and took a few steps toward the bench. he paused, looking more
confused with every moment. "actually, i think i'd like to use the rest room."

fache frowned inwardly at the delay. "the rest room. of course. let's take a break for a few
minutes." he motioned back down the long hallway in the direction they had come from. "the rest
rooms are back toward the curator's office."

langdon hesitated, pointing in the other direction toward the far end of the grand gallery corridor.
"i believe there's a much closer rest room at the end."

fache realized langdon was right. they were two thirds of the way down, and the grand gallery
dead-ended at a pair of rest rooms. "shall i accompany you?"

langdon shook his head, already moving deeper into the gallery. "not necessary. i think i'd like a
few minutes alone."

fache was not wild about the idea of langdon wandering alone down the remaining length of
corridor, but he took comfort in knowing the grand gallery was a dead end whose only exit was at
the other end — the gate under which they had entered. although french fire regulations required
several emergency stairwells for a space this large, those stairwells had been sealed automatically
when sauniere tripped the security system. granted, that system had now been reset, unlocking the
stairwells, but it didn't matter — the external doors, if opened, would set off fire alarms and were
guarded outside by dcpj agents. langdon could not possibly leave without fache knowing about
it.



"i need to return to mr. sauniere's office for a moment," fache said. "please come find me directly,
mr. langdon. there is more we need to discuss."

langdon gave a quiet wave as he disappeared into the darkness.

turning, fache marched angrily in the opposite direction. arriving at the gate, he slid under, exited
the grand gallery, marched down the hall, and stormed into the command center at sauniere's
office.

"who gave the approval to let sophie neveu into this building!" fache bellowed.

collet was the first to answer. "she told the guards outside she'd broken the code."

fache looked around. "is she gone?"

"she's not with you?"



"she left." fache glanced out at the darkened hallway. apparently sophie had been in no mood to
stop by and chat with the other officers on her way out.

for a moment, fache considered radioing the guards in the entresol and telling them to stop sophie
and drag her back up here before she could leave the premises. he thought better of it. that was
only his pride talking... wanting the last word. he'd had enough distractions tonight.

deal with agent neveu later, he told himself, already looking forward to firing her.

pushing sophie from his mind, fache stared for a moment at the miniature knight standing on
sauniere's desk. then he turned back to collet. "do you have him?"

collet gave a curt nod and spun the laptop toward fache. the red dot was clearly visible on the
floor plan overlay, blinking methodically in a room marked toilettes publiques.

"good," fache said, lighting a cigarette and stalking into the hall. i've got a phone call to make. be
damned sure the rest room is the only place langdon goes."



chapter 12

robert langdon felt light-headed as he trudged toward the end of the grand gallery. sophie's
phone message played over and over in his mind. at the end of the corridor, illuminated signs
bearing the international stick-figure symbols for rest rooms guided him through a maze-like series
of dividers displaying italian drawings and hiding the rest rooms from sight.



finding the men's room door, langdon entered and turned on the lights.

the room was empty.

walking to the sink, he splashed cold water on his face and tried to wake up. harsh fluorescent
lights glared off the stark tile, and the room smelled of ammonia. as he toweled off, the rest room's
door creaked open behind him. he spun.

sophie neveu entered, her green eyes flashing fear. "thank god you came. we don't have much
time."

langdon stood beside the sinks, staring in bewilderment at dcpj cryptographer sophie neveu.
only minutes ago, langdon had listened to her phone message, thinking the newly arrived
cryptographer must be insane. and yet, the more he listened, the more he sensed sophie neveu
was speaking in earnest. do not react to this message. just listen calmly. you are in danger right
now. follow my directions very closely. filled with uncertainty, langdon had decided to do exactly
as sophie advised. he told fache that the phone message was regarding an injured friend back
home. then he had asked to use the rest room at the end of the grand gallery.

sophie stood before him now, still catching her breath after doubling back to the rest room. in the
fluorescent lights, langdon was surprised to see that her strong air actually radiated from
unexpectedly soft features. only her gaze was sharp, and the juxtaposition conjured images of a
multilayered renoir portrait... veiled but distinct, with a boldness that somehow retained its shroud
of mystery.

"i wanted to warn you, mr. langdon..." sophie began, still catching her breath, "that you are sous
surveillance cachee. under a guarded observation." as she spoke, her accented english resonated
off the tile walls, giving her voice a hollow quality.

"but... why?" langdon demanded. sophie had already given him an explanation on the phone, but
he wanted to hear it from her lips.

"because," she said, stepping toward him, "fache's primary suspect in this murder is you. "

langdon was braced for the words, and yet they still sounded utterly ridiculous. according to

sophie, langdon had been called to the louvre tonight not as a symbologist but rather as a suspect

and was currently the unwitting target of one of dcpj's favorite interrogation

methods — surveillance cachee — a deft deception in which the police calmly invited a suspect to a

crime scene and interviewed him in hopes he would get nervous and mistakenly incriminate

himself.

"look in your jacket's left pocket," sophie said. "you'll find proof they are watching you."



langdon felt his apprehension rising. look in my pocket? it sounded like some kind of cheap
magic trick.

"just look."

bewildered, langdon reached his hand into his tweed jacket's left pocket — one he never used.
feeling around inside, he found nothing. what the devil did you expect? he began wondering if
sophie might just be insane after all. then his fingers brushed something unexpected. small and
hard. pinching the tiny object between his fingers, langdon pulled it out and stared in
astonishment. it was a metallic, button-shaped disk, about the size of a watch battery. he had never
seen it before. "what the...?"

"gps tracking dot," sophie said. "continuously transmits its location to a global positioning
system satellite that dcpj can monitor. we use them to monitor people's locations. it's accurate
within two feet anywhere on the globe. they have you on an electronic leash. the agent who
picked you up at the hotel slipped it inside your pocket before you left your room."

langdon flashed back to the hotel room... his quick shower, getting dressed, the dcpj agent
politely holding out langdon' s tweed coat as they left the room. it's cool outside, mr. langdon, the
agent had said. spring in paris is not all your song boasts. langdon had thanked him and donned
the jacket.

sophie's olive gaze was keen. "i didn't tell you about the tracking dot earlier because i didn't want
you checking your pocket in front of fache. he can't know you've found it."

langdon had no idea how to respond.

"they tagged you with gps because they thought you might run." she paused. "in fact, they hoped
you would run; it would make their case stronger."

"why would i run!" langdon demanded. "i'm innocent!"

"fache feels otherwise."

angrily, langdon stalked toward the trash receptacle to dispose of the tracking dot.

"no!" sophie grabbed his arm and stopped him. "leave it in your pocket. if you throw it out, the
signal will stop moving, and they'll know you found the dot. the only reason fache left you alone
is because he can monitor where you are. if he thinks you've discovered what he's doing..." sophie
did not finish the thought. instead, she pried the metallic disk from langdon' s hand and slid it back
into the pocket of his tweed coat. "the dot stays with you. at least for the moment."



langdon felt lost. "how the hell could fache actually believe i killed jacques sauniere!"

"he has some fairly persuasive reasons to suspect you." sophie's expression was grim. "there is a
piece of evidence here that you have not yet seen. fache has kept it carefully hidden from you."

langdon could only stare.

"do you recall the three lines of text that sauniere wrote on the floor?"

langdon nodded. the numbers and words were imprinted on langdon's mind.

sophie's voice dropped to a whisper now. "unfortunately, what you saw was not the entire
message. there was a fourth line that fache photographed and then wiped clean before you
arrived. "

although langdon knew the soluble ink of a watermark stylus could easily be wiped away, he
could not imagine why fache would erase evidence.

"the last line of the message," sophie said, "was something fache did not want you to know
about." she paused. "at least not until he was done with you."

sophie produced a computer printout of a photo from her sweater pocket and began unfolding it.
"fache uploaded images of the crime scene to the cryptology department earlier tonight in hopes
we could figure out what sauniere's message was trying to say. this is a photo of the complete
message." she handed the page to langdon.

bewildered, langdon looked at the image. the close-up photo revealed the glowing message on
the parquet floor. the final line hit langdon like a kick in the gut.

13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5

o, draconian devil !

oh, lame saint!

p.s. find robert langdon



chapter 13

for several seconds, langdon stared in wonder at the photograph of sauniere's postscript. p.s.
find robert langdon. he felt as if the floor were tilting beneath his feet. sauniere left a postscript
with my name on it? in his wildest dreams, langdon could not fathom why.



"now do you understand," sophie said, her eyes urgent, "why fache ordered you here tonight, and
why you are his primary suspect?"

the only thing langdon understood at the moment was why fache had looked so smug when
langdon suggested sauniere would have accused his killer by name.

find robert langdon.

"why would sauniere write this?" langdon demanded, his confusion now giving way to anger.
"why would i want to kill jacques sauniere?"

"fache has yet to uncover a motive, but he has been recording his entire conversation with you
tonight in hopes you might reveal one."

langdon opened his mouth, but still no words came.

"he's fitted with a miniature microphone," sophie explained. "it's connected to a transmitter in his
pocket that radios the signal back to the command post."

"this is impossible," langdon stammered. "i have an alibi. i went directly back to my hotel after
my lecture. you can ask the hotel desk."

"fache already did. his report shows you retrieving your room key from the concierge at about ten-
thirty. unfortunately, the time of the murder was closer to eleven. you easily could have left your
hotel room unseen."

"this is insanity! fache has no evidence!"

sophie's eyes widened as if to say: no evidence? "mr. langdon, your name is written on the floor
beside the body, and sauniere's date book says you were with him at approximately the time of the
murder." she paused. "fache has more than enough evidence to take you into custody for
questioning."

langdon suddenly sensed that he needed a lawyer. "i didn't do this."

sophie sighed. "this is not american television, mr. langdon. in france, the laws protect the
police, not criminals. unfortunately, in this case, there is also the media consideration. jacques
sauniere was a very prominent and well-loved figure in paris, and his murder will be news in the
morning. fache will be under immediate pressure to make a statement, and he looks a lot better
having a suspect in custody already. whether or not you are guilty, you most certainly will be held
by dcpj until they can figure out what really happened."

langdon felt like a caged animal. "why are you telling me all this?"



"because, mr. langdon, i believe you are innocent." sophie looked away for a moment and then
back into his eyes. "and also because it is partially my fault that you're in trouble."

"i'm sorry? it's your fault sauniere is trying to frame me?"

"sauniere wasn't trying to frame you. it was a mistake. that message on the floor was meant for
me."

langdon needed a minute to process that one. "i beg your pardon?"

"that message wasn't for the police. he wrote it for me. i think he was forced to do everything in
such a hurry that he just didn't realize how it would look to the police." she paused. "the numbered
code is meaningless. sauniere wrote it to make sure the investigation included cryptographers,
ensuring that / would know as soon as possible what had happened to him."

langdon felt himself losing touch fast. whether or not sophie neveu had lost her mind was at this
point up for grabs, but at least langdon now understood why she was trying to help him. p.s. find
robert langdon. she apparently believed the curator had left her a cryptic postscript telling her to
find langdon. "but why do you think his message was for you?"

"the vitruvian man, " she said flatly. "that particular sketch has always been my favorite da vinci
work. tonight he used it to catch my attention."

"hold on. you're saying the curator knew your favorite piece of art?" she nodded. "i'm sorry. this
is all coming out of order. jacques sauniere and i..."

sophie's voice caught, and langdon heard a sudden melancholy there, a painful past, simmering
just below the surface. sophie and jacques sauniere apparently had some kind of special
relationship. langdon studied the beautiful young woman before him, well aware that aging men in
france often took young mistresses. even so, sophie neveu as a "kept woman" somehow didn't
seem to fit.

"we had a falling-out ten years ago," sophie said, her voice a whisper now. "we've barely spoken
since. tonight, when crypto got the call that he had been murdered, and i saw the images of his
body and text on the floor, i realized he was trying to send me a message."

"because of the vitruvian man?"

"yes. and the letters p.s."

"postscript?"



she shook her head. "p.s. are my initials."

"but your name is sophie neveu."

she looked away. "p.s. is the nickname he called me when i lived with him." she blushed. "it
stood for princesse sophie "

langdon had no response.

"silly, i know," she said. "but it was years ago. when i was a little girl."

"you knew him when you were a little girl?"

"quite well," she said, her eyes welling now with emotion. "jacques sauniere was my
grandfather."



chapter 14

"where's langdon?" fache demanded, exhaling the last of a cigarette as he paced back into the
command post.

"still in the men's room, sir." lieutenant collet had been expecting the question.

fache grumbled, "taking his time, i see."

the captain eyed the gps dot over collet's shoulder, and collet could almost hear the wheels
turning. fache was fighting the urge to go check on langdon. ideally, the subject of an observation
was allowed the most time and freedom possible, lulling him into a false sense of security.
langdon needed to return of his own volition. still, it had been almost ten minutes.

too long.

"any chance langdon is onto us?" fache asked.

collet shook his head. "we're still seeing small movements inside the men's room, so the gps dot
is obviously still on him. perhaps he feels ill? if he had found the dot, he would have removed it
and tried to run. "

fache checked his watch. "fine."

still fache seemed preoccupied. all evening, collet had sensed an atypical intensity in his captain.



usually detached and cool under pressure, fache tonight seemed emotionally engaged, as if this
were somehow a personal matter for him.

not surprising, collet thought. fache needs this arrest desperately. recently the board of
ministers and the media had become more openly critical of fache's aggressive tactics, his clashes
with powerful foreign embassies, and his gross overbudgeting on new technologies. tonight, a
high-tech, high-profile arrest of an american would go a long way to silence fache's critics,
helping him secure the job a few more years until he could retire with the lucrative pension. god
knows he needs the pension, collet thought. fache's zeal for technology had hurt him both
professionally and personally. fache was rumored to have invested his entire savings in the
technology craze a few years back and lost his shirt. and fache is a man who wears only the finest
shirts.

tonight, there was still plenty of time. sophie neveu's odd interruption, though unfortunate, had
been only a minor wrinkle. she was gone now, and fache still had cards to play. he had yet to
inform langdon that his name had been scrawled on the floor by the victim. p.s. find robert
langdon. the american's reaction to that little bit of evidence would be telling indeed.

"captain?" one of the dcpj agents now called from across the office. "i think you better take this
call." he was holding out a telephone receiver, looking concerned.

"who is it?" fache said.

the agent frowned. "it's the director of our cryptology department."

"and?"

"it's about sophie neveu, sir. something is not quite right."



chapter 15

it was time.

silas felt strong as he stepped from the black audi, the nighttime breeze rustling his loose-fitting
robe. the winds of change are in the air. he knew the task before him would require more finesse
than force, and he left his handgun in the car. the thirteen-round heckler koch usp 40 had been
provided by the teacher.

a weapon of death has no place in a house of god.



the plaza before the great church was deserted at this hour, the only visible souls on the far side of
place saint-sulpice a couple of teenage hookers showing their wares to the late night tourist traffic.
their nubile bodies sent a familiar longing to silas's loins. his thigh flexed instinctively, causing
the barbed cilice belt to cut painfully into his flesh.

the lust evaporated instantly. for ten years now, silas had faithfully denied himself all sexual
indulgence, even self-administered. it was the way. he knew he had sacrificed much to follow
opus dei, but he had received much more in return. a vow of celibacy and the relinquishment of
all personal assets hardly seemed a sacrifice. considering the poverty from which he had come and
the sexual horrors he had endured in prison, celibacy was a welcome change.

now, having returned to france for the first time since being arrested and shipped to prison in
andorra, silas could feel his homeland testing him, dragging violent memories from his redeemed
soul. you have been reborn, he reminded himself. his service to god today had required the sin of
murder, and it was a sacrifice silas knew he would have to hold silently in his heart for all eternity.

the measure of your faith is the measure of the pain you can endure, the teacher had told him.
silas was no stranger to pain and felt eager to prove himself to the teacher, the one who had
assured him his actions were ordained by a higher power.

"hago la obra de dios, " silas whispered, moving now toward the church entrance.

pausing in the shadow of the massive doorway, he took a deep breath. it was not until this instant
that he truly realized what he was about to do, and what awaited him inside.

the keystone. it will lead us to our final goal.

he raised his ghost-white fist and banged three times on the door.

moments later, the bolts of the enormous wooden portal began to move.



chapter 16

sophie wondered how long it would take fache to figure out she had not left the building. seeing
that langdon was clearly overwhelmed, sophie questioned whether she had done the right thing by
cornering him here in the men's room.

what else was i supposed to do ?

she pictured her grandfather's body, naked and spread-eagle on the floor. there was a time when
he had meant the world to her, yet tonight, sophie was surprised to feel almost no sadness for the



man. jacques sauniere was a stranger to her now. their relationship had evaporated in a single
instant one march night when she was twenty-two. ten years ago. sophie had come home a few
days early from graduate university in england and mistakenly witnessed her grandfather engaged
in something sophie was obviously not supposed to see. it was an image she barely could believe
to this day.

if i hadn't seen it with my own eyes...

too ashamed and stunned to endure her grandfather's pained attempts to explain, sophie
immediately moved out on her own, taking money she had saved, and getting a small flat with
some roommates. she vowed never to speak to anyone about what she had seen. her grandfather
tried desperately to reach her, sending cards and letters, begging sophie to meet him so he could
explain. explain how! ? sophie never responded except once — to forbid him ever to call her or try
to meet her in public. she was afraid his explanation would be more terrifying than the incident
itself.

incredibly, sauniere had never given up on her, and sophie now possessed a decade's worth of
correspondence unopened in a dresser drawer. to her grandfather's credit, he had never once
disobeyed her request and phoned her.

until this afternoon.

"sophie?" his voice had sounded startlingly old on her answering machine. "i have abided by your
wishes for so long... and it pains me to call, but i must speak to you. something terrible has
happened."

standing in the kitchen of her paris flat, sophie felt a chill to hear him again after all these years.
his gentle voice brought back a flood of fond childhood memories.

"sophie, please listen." he was speaking english to her, as he always did when she was a little girl.
practice french at school. practice english at home. "you cannot be mad forever. have you not
read the letters that i've sent all these years? do you not yet understand?" he paused. "we must
speak at once. please grant your grandfather this one wish. call me at the louvre. right away. i
believe you and i are in grave danger." sophie stared at the answering machine. danger? what
was he talking about?

"princess..." her grandfather's voice cracked with an emotion sophie could not place. "i know i've
kept things from you, and i know it has cost me your love. but it was for your own safety. now
you must know the truth. please, i must tell you the truth about your family."

sophie suddenly could hear her own heart. my family? sophie's parents had died when she was
only four. their car went off a bridge into fast-moving water. her grandmother and younger
brother had also been in the car, and sophie's entire family had been erased in an instant. she had a



box of newspaper clippings to confirm it.

his words had sent an unexpected surge of longing through her bones. my family! in that fleeting
instant, sophie saw images from the dream that had awoken her countless times when she was a
little girl: my family is alive! they are coming home! but, as in her dream, the pictures evaporated
into oblivion.

your family is dead, sophie. they are not coming home.

"sophie..." her grandfather said on the machine. "i have been waiting for years to tell you. waiting
for the right moment, but now time has run out. call me at the louvre. as soon as you get this. i'll
wait here all night. i fear we both may be in danger. there's so much you need to know."

the message ended.

in the silence, sophie stood trembling for what felt like minutes. as she considered her
grandfather's message, only one possibility made sense, and his true intent dawned.

it was bait.

obviously, her grandfather wanted desperately to see her. he was trying anything. her disgust for
the man deepened. sophie wondered if maybe he had fallen terminally ill and had decided to
attempt any ploy he could think of to get sophie to visit him one last time. if so, he had chosen
wisely.

my family.

now, standing in the darkness of the louvre men's room, sophie could hear the echoes of this
afternoon's phone message. sophie, we both may be in danger. call me.

she had not called him. nor had she planned to. now, however, her skepticism had been deeply
challenged. her grandfather lay murdered inside his own museum. and he had written a code on
the floor.

a code for her. of this, she was certain.

despite not understanding the meaning of his message, sophie was certain its cryptic nature was
additional proof that the words were intended for her. sophie's passion and aptitude for
cryptography were a product of growing up with jacques sauniere — a fanatic himself for codes,
word games, and puzzles. how many sundays did we spend doing the cryptograms and crosswords
in the newspaper?

at the age of twelve, sophie could finish the he monde crossword without any help, and her



grandfather graduated her to crosswords in english, mathematical puzzles, and substitution ciphers.
sophie devoured them all. eventually she turned her passion into a profession by becoming a
codebreaker for the judicial police.

tonight, the cryptographer in sophie was forced to respect the efficiency with which her
grandfather had used a simple code to unite two total strangers — sophie neveu and robert
langdon.

the question was why?

unfortunately, from the bewildered look in langdon's eyes, sophie sensed the american had no
more idea than she did why her grandfather had thrown them together.

she pressed again. "you and my grandfather had planned to meet tonight. what about?"

langdon looked truly perplexed. "his secretary set the meeting and didn't offer any specific reason,
and i didn't ask. i assumed he'd heard i would be lecturing on the pagan iconography of french
cathedrals, was interested in the topic, and thought it would be fun to meet for drinks after the
talk."

sophie didn't buy it. the connection was flimsy. her grandfather knew more about pagan
iconography than anyone else on earth. moreover, he an exceptionally private man, not someone
prone to chatting with random american professors unless there were an important reason.

sophie took a deep breath and probed further. "my grandfather called me this afternoon and told
me he and i were in grave danger. does that mean anything to you?"

langdon's blue eyes now clouded with concern. "no, but considering what just happened..."

sophie nodded. considering tonight's events, she would be a fool not to be frightened. feeling
drained, she walked to the small plate-glass window at the far end of the bathroom and gazed out in
silence through the mesh of alarm tape embedded in the glass. they were high up — forty feet at
least.

sighing, she raised her eyes and gazed out at paris's dazzling landscape. on her left, across the
seine, the illuminated eiffel tower. straight ahead, the arc de triomphe. and to the right, high
atop the sloping rise of montmartre, the graceful arabesque dome of sacre-coeur, its polished
stone glowing white like a resplendent sanctuary.

here at the westernmost tip of the denon wing, the north-south thoroughfare of place du carrousel
ran almost flush with the building with only a narrow sidewalk separating it from the louvre's
outer wall. far below, the usual caravan of the city's nighttime delivery trucks sat idling, waiting
for the signals to change, their running lights seeming to twinkle mockingly up at sophie.



"i don't know what to say," langdon said, coming up behind her. "your grandfather is obviously
trying to tell us something. i'm sorry i'm so little help."

sophie turned from the window, sensing a sincere regret in langdon's deep voice. even with all the
trouble around him, he obviously wanted to help her. the teacher in him, she thought, having read
dcpj's workup on their suspect. this was an academic who clearly despised not understanding.

we have that in common, she thought.

as a codebreaker, sophie made her living extracting meaning from seemingly senseless data.
tonight, her best guess was that robert langdon, whether he knew it or not, possessed information
that she desperately needed. princesse sophie, find robert langdon. how much clearer could her
grandfather's message be? sophie needed more time with langdon. time to think. time to sort out
this mystery together. unfortunately, time was running out.

gazing up at langdon, sophie made the only play she could think of. "bezu fache will be taking
you into custody at any minute. i can get you out of this museum. but we need to act now."

langdon's eyes went wide. "you want me to run?"

"it's the smartest thing you could do. if you let fache take you into custody now, you'll spend
weeks in a french jail while dcpj and the u.s. embassy fight over which courts try your case. but
if we get you out of here, and make it to your embassy, then your government will protect your
rights while you and i prove you had nothing to do with this murder. "

langdon looked not even vaguely convinced. "forget it! fache has armed guards on every single
exit! even if we escape without being shot, running away only makes me look guilty. you need to
tell fache that the message on the floor was for you, and that my name is not there as an
accusation. "

"i will do that," sophie said, speaking hurriedly, "but after you're safely inside the u.s. embassy.
it's only about a mile from here, and my car is parked just outside the museum. dealing with fache
from here is too much of a gamble. don't you see? fache has made it his mission tonight to prove
you are guilty. the only reason he postponed your arrest was to run this observance in hopes you
did something that made his case stronger."

"exactly. like running!"

the cell phone in sophie's sweater pocket suddenly began ringing. fache probably. she reached in
her sweater and turned off the phone.

"mr. langdon," she said hurriedly, "i need to ask you one last question." and your entire future
may depend on it. "the writing on the floor is obviously not proof of your guilt, and yet fache told



our team he is certain you are his man. can you think of any other reason he might be convinced
you're guilty?"

langdon was silent for several seconds. "none whatsoever."

sophie sighed. which means fache is lying. why, sophie could not begin to imagine, but that was
hardly the issue at this point. the fact remained that bezu fache was determined to put robert
langdon behind bars tonight, at any cost. sophie needed langdon for herself, and it was this
dilemma that left sophie only one logical conclusion.

/ need to get langdon to the u.s. embassy.

turning toward the window, sophie gazed through the alarm mesh embedded in the plate glass,
down the dizzying forty feet to the pavement below. a leap from this height would leave langdon
with a couple of broken legs. at best.

nonetheless, sophie made her decision.

robert langdon was about to escape the louvre, whether he wanted to or not.



chapter 17

"what do you mean she's not answering?" fache looked incredulous. "you're calling her cell
phone, right? i know she's carrying it."

collet had been trying to reach sophie now for several minutes. "maybe her batteries are dead. or
her ringer's off."

fache had looked distressed ever since talking to the director of cryptology on the phone. after
hanging up, he had marched over to collet and demanded he get agent neveu on the line. now
collet had failed, and fache was pacing like a caged lion.

"why did crypto call?" collet now ventured.

fache turned. "to tell us they found no references to draconian devils and lame saints."

"that's all?"



"no, also to tell us that they had just identified the numerics as fibonacci numbers, but they
suspected the series was meaningless."



collet was confused. "but they already sent agent neveu to tell us that."

fache shook his head. "they didn't send neveu."

"what?"

"according to the director, at my orders he paged his entire team to look at the images i'd wired
him. when agent neveu arrived, she took one look at the photos of sauniere and the code and left
the office without a word. the director said he didn't question her behavior because she was
understandably upset by the photos."

"upset? she's never seen a picture of a dead body?"

fache was silent a moment. "i was not aware of this, and it seems neither was the director until a
coworker informed him, but apparently sophie neveu is jacques sauniere's granddaughter."

collet was speechless.

"the director said she never once mentioned sauniere to him, and he assumed it was because she
probably didn't want preferential treatment for having a famous grandfather."

no wonder she was upset by the pictures. collet could barely conceive of the unfortunate
coincidence that called in a young woman to decipher a code written by a dead family member.
still, her actions made no sense. "but she obviously recognized the numbers as fibonacci numbers
because she came here and told us. i don't understand why she would leave the office without
telling anyone she had figured it out."

collet could think of only one scenario to explain the troubling developments: sauniere had written
a numeric code on the floor in hopes fache would involve cryptographers in the investigation, and
therefore involve his own granddaughter. as for the rest of the message, was sauniere
communicating in some way with his granddaughter? if so, what did the message tell her? and
how did langdon fit in?

before collet could ponder it any further, the silence of the deserted museum was shattered by an
alarm. the bell sounded like it was coming from inside the grand gallery.

"alarme! " one of the agents yelled, eyeing his feed from the louvre security center. "grande
galerie! toilettes messieurs! "

fache wheeled to collet. "where's langdon?"

"still in the men's room!" collet pointed to the blinking red dot on his laptop schematic. "he must
have broken the window ! " collet knew langdon wouldn't get far. although paris fire codes



required windows above fifteen meters in public buildings be breakable in case of fire, exiting a
louvre second-story window without the help of a hook and ladder would be suicide. furthermore,
there were no trees or grass on the western end of the denon wing to cushion a fall. directly
beneath that rest room window, the two-lane place du carrousel ran within a few feet of the outer
wall. "my god," collet exclaimed, eyeing the screen. "langdon's moving to the window ledge!"

but fache was already in motion. yanking his manurhin mr-93 revolver from his shoulder
holster, the captain dashed out of the office.

collet watched the screen in bewilderment as the blinking dot arrived at the window ledge and then
did something utterly unexpected. the dot moved outside the perimeter of the building.

what's going on? he wondered. is langdon out on a ledge or —

"jesuf" collet jumped to his feet as the dot shot farther outside the wall. the signal seemed to
shudder for a moment, and then the blinking dot came to an abrupt stop about ten yards outside the
perimeter of the building.

fumbling with the controls, collet called up a paris street map and recalibrated the gps. zooming
in, he could now see the exact location of the signal.

it was no longer moving.

it lay at a dead stop in the middle of place du carrousel.

langdon had jumped.



chapter 18

fache sprinted down the grand gallery as collet's radio blared over the distant sound of the alarm.

"he jumped!" collet was yelling. "i'm showing the signal out on place du carrousel! outside the
bathroom window! and it's not moving at all! jesus, i think langdon has just committed suicide!"

fache heard the words, but they made no sense. he kept running. the hallway seemed never-
ending. as he sprinted past sauniere's body, he set his sights on the partitions at the far end of the
denon wing. the alarm was getting louder now.

"wait!" collet's voice blared again over the radio. "he's moving! my god, he's alive. langdon's
moving ! "



fache kept running, cursing the length of the hallway with every step.

"langdon's moving faster!" collet was still yelling on the radio. "he's running down carrousel.
wait... he's picking up speed. he's moving too fast!"

arriving at the partitions, fache snaked his way through them, saw the rest room door, and ran for
it.

the walkie-talkie was barely audible now over the alarm. "he must be in a car! i think he's in a
car! i can't — "

collet's words were swallowed by the alarm as fache finally burst into the men's room with his gun
drawn. wincing against the piercing shrill, he scanned the area.

the stalls were empty. the bathroom deserted. fache's eyes moved immediately to the shattered
window at the far end of the room. he ran to the opening and looked over the edge. langdon was
nowhere to be seen. fache could not imagine anyone risking a stunt like this. certainly if he had
dropped that far, he would be badly injured.

the alarm cut off finally, and collet's voice became audible again over the walkie-talkie.

"...moving south... faster... crossing the seine on pont du carrousel!"

fache turned to his left. the only vehicle on pont du carrousel was an enormous twin-bed trailor
delivery truck moving southward away from the louvre. the truck's open-air bed was covered
with a vinyl tarp, roughly resembling a giant hammock. fache felt a shiver of apprehension. that
truck, only moments ago, had probably been stopped at a red light directly beneath the rest room
window.

an insane risk, fache told himself. langdon had no way of knowing what the truck was carrying
beneath that tarp. what if the truck were carrying steel? or cement? or even garbage? a forty-foot
leap? it was madness.

"the dot is turning!" collet called. "he's turning right on pont des saints-peres!"

sure enough, the trailor truck that had crossed the bridge was slowing down and making a right
turn onto pont des saints-peres. so be it, fache thought. amazed, he watched the truck disappear
around the corner. collet was already radioing the agents outside, pulling them off the louvre
perimeter and sending them to their patrol cars in pursuit, all the while broadcasting the truck's
changing location like some kind of bizarre play-by-play.

it's over, fache knew. his men would have the truck surrounded within minutes. langdon was not
going anywhere.



stowing his weapon, fache exited the rest room and radioed collet. "bring my car around. i want
to be there when we make the arrest."

as fache jogged back down the length of the grand gallery, he wondered if langdon had even
survived the fall.

not that it mattered.

langdon ran. guilty as charged.



only fifteen yards from the rest room, langdon and sophie stood in the darkness of the grand
gallery, their backs pressed to one of the large partitions that hid the bathrooms from the gallery.
they had barely managed to hide themselves before fache had darted past them, gun drawn, and
disappeared into the bathroom.

the last sixty seconds had been a blur.

langdon had been standing inside the men's room refusing to run from a crime he didn't commit,
when sophie began eyeing the plate-glass window and examining the alarm mesh running through
it. then she peered downward into the street, as if measuring the drop.

"with a little aim, you can get out of here," she said.

aim? uneasy, he peered out the rest room window.

up the street, an enormous twin-bed eighteen- wheeler was headed for the stoplight beneath the
window. stretched across the truck's massive cargo bay was a blue vinyl tarp, loosely covering the
truck's load. langdon hoped sophie was not thinking what she seemed to be thinking.

"sophie, there's no way i'm jump — "

"take out the tracking dot."

bewildered, langdon fumbled in his pocket until he found the tiny metallic disk. sophie took it
from him and strode immediately to the sink. she grabbed a thick bar of soap, placed the tracking
dot on top of it, and used her thumb to push the disk down hard into the bar. as the disk sank into
the soft surface, she pinched the hole closed, firmly embedding the device in the bar.

handing the bar to langdon, sophie retrieved a heavy, cylindrical trash can from under the sinks.
before langdon could protest, sophie ran at the window, holding the can before her like a



battering ram. driving the bottom of the trash can into the center of the window, she shattered the
glass.

alarms erupted overhead at earsplitting decibel levels.

"give me the soap!" sophie yelled, barely audible over the alarm.

langdon thrust the bar into her hand.

palming the soap, she peered out the shattered window at the eighteen-wheeler idling below. the
target was plenty big — an expansive, stationary tarp — and it was less than ten feet from the side of
the building. as the traffic lights prepared to change, sophie took a deep breath and lobbed the bar
of soap out into the night.

the soap plummeted downward toward the truck, landing on the edge of the tarp, and sliding
downward into the cargo bay just as the traffic light turned green.

"congratulations," sophie said, dragging him toward the door. "you just escaped from the
louvre."

fleeing the men's room, they moved into the shadows just as fache rushed past.



now, with the fire alarm silenced, langdon could hear the sounds of dcpj sirens tearing away
from the louvre. a police exodus. fache had hurried off as well, leaving the grand gallery
deserted.

"there's an emergency stairwell about fifty meters back into the grand gallery," sophie said.
"now that the guards are leaving the perimeter, we can get out of here."

langdon decided not to say another word all evening. sophie neveu was clearly a hell of a lot
smarter than he was.



chapter 19

the church of saint-sulpice, it is said, has the most eccentric history of any building in paris. built
over the ruins of an ancient temple to the egyptian goddess isis, the church possesses an
architectural footprint matching that of notre dame to within inches. the sanctuary has played
host to the baptisms of the marquis de sade and baudelaire, as well as the marriage of victor
hugo. the attached seminary has a well-documented history of unorthodoxy and was once the



clandestine meeting hall for numerous secret societies.

tonight, the cavernous nave of saint-sulpice was as silent as a tomb, the only hint of life the faint
smell of incense from mass earlier that evening. silas sensed an uneasiness in sister sandrine's
demeanor as she led him into the sanctuary. he was not surprised by this. silas was accustomed to
people being uncomfortable with his appearance.

"you're an american," she said.

"french by birth," silas responded. "i had my calling in spain, and i now study in the united
states."

sister sandrine nodded. she was a small woman with quiet eyes. "and you have never seen saint-
sulpice?"

"i realize this is almost a sin in itself."

"she is more beautiful by day."

"i am certain. nonetheless, i am grateful that you would provide me this opportunity tonight."

"the abbe requested it. you obviously have powerful friends."

you have no idea, silas thought.

as he followed sister sandrine down the main aisle, silas was surprised by the austerity of the
sanctuary. unlike notre dame with its colorful frescoes, gilded altar-work, and warm wood, saint-
sulpice was stark and cold, conveying an almost barren quality reminiscent of the ascetic
cathedrals of spain. the lack of decor made the interior look even more expansive, and as silas
gazed up into the soaring ribbed vault of the ceiling, he imagined he was standing beneath the hull
of an enormous overturned ship.

a fitting image, he thought. the brotherhood's ship was about to be capsized forever. feeling eager
to get to work, silas wished sister sandrine would leave him. she was a small woman whom silas
could incapacitate easily, but he had vowed not to use force unless absolutely necessary. she is a
woman of the cloth, and it is not her fault the brotherhood chose her church as a hiding place for
their keystone. she should not be punished for the sins of others.

"i am embarrassed, sister, that you were awoken on my behalf."

"not at all. you are in paris a short time. you should not miss saint-sulpice. are your interests in
the church more architectural or historical?"



"actually, sister, my interests are spiritual."

she gave a pleasant laugh. "that goes without saying. i simply wondered where to begin your
tour."

silas felt his eyes focus on the altar. "a tour is unnecessary. you have been more than kind. i can
show myself around. "

"it is no trouble," she said. "after all, i am awake."

silas stopped walking. they had reached the front pew now, and the altar was only fifteen yards
away. he turned his massive body fully toward the small woman, and he could sense her recoil as
she gazed up into his red eyes. "if it does not seem too rude, sister, i am not accustomed to simply
walking into a house of god and taking a tour. would you mind if i took some time alone to pray
before i look around?"

sister sandrine hesitated. "oh, of course. i shall wait in the rear of the church for you."

silas put a soft but heavy hand on her shoulder and peered down. "sister, i feel guilty already for
having awoken you. to ask you to stay awake is too much. please, you should return to bed. i can
enjoy your sanctuary and then let myself out."

she looked uneasy. "are you sure you won't feel abandoned?"

"not at all. prayer is a solitary joy."

"as you wish."

silas took his hand from her shoulder. "sleep well, sister. may the peace of the lord be with you."

"and also with you." sister sandrine headed for the stairs. "please be sure the door closes tightly
on your way out."

"i will be sure of it." silas watched her climb out of sight. then he turned and knelt in the front
pew, feeling the cilice cut into his leg.

dear god, i offer up to you this work i do today....



crouching in the shadows of the choir balcony high above the altar, sister sandrine peered silently
through the balustrade at the cloaked monk kneeling alone. the sudden dread in her soul made it
hard to stay still. for a fleeting instant, she wondered if this mysterious visitor could be the enemy



they had warned her about, and if tonight she would have to carry out the orders she had been
holding all these years. she decided to stay there in the darkness and watch his every move.



chapter 20

emerging from the shadows, langdon and sophie moved stealthily up the deserted grand gallery
corridor toward the emergency exit stairwell.

as he moved, langdon felt like he was trying to assemble a jigsaw puzzle in the dark. the newest
aspect of this mystery was a deeply troubling one: the captain of the judicial police is trying to
frame me for murder

"do you think," he whispered, "that maybe fache wrote that message on the floor?"

sophie didn't even turn. "impossible."

langdon wasn't so sure. "he seems pretty intent on making me look guilty. maybe he thought
writing my name on the floor would help his case?"

"the fibonacci sequence? the p.s.? all the da vinci and goddess symbolism? that had to be my
grandfather."

langdon knew she was right. the symbolism of the clues meshed too perfectly — the pentacle, the
vitruvian man, da vinci, the goddess, and even the fibonacci sequence. a coherent symbolic set,
as iconographers would call it. all inextricably tied.

"and his phone call to me this afternoon," sophie added. "he said he had to tell me something. i'm
certain his message at the louvre was his final effort to tell me something important, something he
thought you could help me understand. "

langdon frowned. o, draconian devil! oh, lame saint. ! he wished he could comprehend the
message, both for sophie's well-being and for his own. things had definitely gotten worse since he
first laid eyes on the cryptic words. his fake leap out the bathroom window was not going to help
langdon's popularity with fache one bit. somehow he doubted the captain of the french police
would see the humor in chasing down and arresting a bar of soap.

"the doorway isn't much farther," sophie said.

"do you think there's a possibility that the numbers in your grandfather's message hold the key to
understanding the other lines?" langdon had once worked on a series of baconian manuscripts that
contained epigraphical ciphers in which certain lines of code were clues as to how to decipher the



other lines.

"i've been thinking about the numbers all night. sums, quotients, products. i don't see anything.
mathematically, they're arranged at random. cryptographic gibberish."

"and yet they're all part of the fibonacci sequence. that can't be coincidence."

"it's not. using fibonacci numbers was my grandfather's way of waving another flag at me — like
writing the message in english, or arranging himself like my favorite piece of art, or drawing a
pentacle on himself. all of it was to catch my attention."

"the pentacle has meaning to you?"

"yes. i didn't get a chance to tell you, but the pentacle was a special symbol between my
grandfather and me when i was growing up. we used to play tarot cards for fun, and my indicator
card always turned out to be from the suit of pentacles. i'm sure he stacked the deck, but pentacles
got to be our little joke."

langdon felt a chill. they played tarot? the medieval italian card game was so replete with
hidden heretical symbolism that langdon had dedicated an entire chapter in his new manuscript to
the tarot. the game's twenty-two cards bore names like the female pope, the empress, and the
star. originally, tarot had been devised as a secret means to pass along ideologies banned by the
church. now, tarot's mystical qualities were passed on by modern fortune-tellers.

the tarot indicator suit for feminine divinity is pentacles, langdon thought, realizing that if
sauniere had been stacking his granddaughter's deck for fun, pentacles was an apropos inside joke.

they arrived at the emergency stairwell, and sophie carefully pulled open the door. no alarm
sounded. only the doors to the outside were wired. sophie led langdon down a tight set of
switchback stairs toward the ground level, picking up speed as they went.

"your grandfather," langdon said, hurrying behind her, "when he told you about the pentacle, did
he mention goddess worship or any resentment of the catholic church?"

sophie shook her head. "i was more interested in the mathematics of it — the divine proportion,
phi, fibonacci sequences, that sort of thing."

langdon was surprised. "your grandfather taught you about the number phi?"

"of course. the divine proportion." her expression turned sheepish. "in fact, he used to joke that i
was half divine... you know, because of the letters in my name."

langdon considered it a moment and then groaned.



s-o-phi-e.

still descending, langdon refocused on phi. he was starting to realize that sauniere's clues were
even more consistent than he had first imagined.

da vinci... fibonacci numbers... the pentacle.

incredibly, all of these things were connected by a single concept so fundamental to art history that
langdon often spent several class periods on the topic.

phi.

he felt himself suddenly reeling back to harvard, standing in front of his "symbolism in art" class,
writing his favorite number on the chalkboard.

1.618

langdon turned to face his sea of eager students. "who can tell me what this number is?"

a long-legged math major in back raised his hand. "that's the number phi." he pronounced it fee.

"nice job, stettner," langdon said. "everyone, meet phi."

"not to be confused with pi," stettner added, grinning. "as we mathematicians like to say: phi is
one h of a lot cooler than pi ! "

langdon laughed, but nobody else seemed to get the joke.

stettner slumped.

"this number phi," langdon continued, "one-point-six-one-eight, is a very important number in
art. who can tell me why?"

stettner tried to redeem himself. "because it's so pretty?"

everyone laughed.

"actually," langdon said, "stettner's right again. phi is generally considered the most beautiful
number in the universe."

the laughter abruptly stopped, and stettner gloated.



as langdon loaded his slide projector, he explained that the number phi was derived from the
fibonacci sequence — a progression famous not only because the sum of adjacent terms equaled the
next term, but because the quotients of adjacent terms possessed the astonishing property of
approaching the number 1.618 — phi!

despite phi's seemingly mystical mathematical origins, langdon explained, the truly mind-
boggling aspect of phi was its role as a fundamental building block in nature. plants, animals, and
even human beings all possessed dimensional properties that adhered with eerie exactitude to the
ratio of phi to 1.

"phi's ubiquity in nature," langdon said, killing the lights, "clearly exceeds coincidence, and so
the ancients assumed the number phi must have been preordained by the creator of the universe.
early scientists heralded one-point-six-one-eight as the divine proportion. "

"hold on," said a young woman in the front row. "i'm a bio major and i've never seen this divine
proportion in nature."

"no?" langdon grinned. "ever study the relationship between females and males in a honeybee
community?"

"sure. the female bees always outnumber the male bees."

"correct. and did you know that if you divide the number of female bees by the number of male
bees in any beehive in the world, you always get the same number?"

"you do?"

"yup. phi."

the girl gaped. "no way!"

"way!" langdon fired back, smiling as he projected a slide of a spiral seashell. "recognize this?"

"it's a nautilus," the bio major said. "a cephalopod mollusk that pumps gas into its chambered shell
to adjust its buoyancy."

"correct. and can you guess what the ratio is of each spiral's diameter to the next?"

the girl looked uncertain as she eyed the concentric arcs of the nautilus spiral.

langdon nodded. "phi. the divine proportion. one-point-six-one-eight to one."

the girl looked amazed.



langdon advanced to the next slide — a close-up of a sunflower's seed head. "sunflower seeds grow
in opposing spirals. can you guess the ratio of each rotation's diameter to the next?"

"phi?" everyone said.

"bingo." langdon began racing through slides now — spiraled pinecone petals, leaf arrangement on
plant stalks, insect segmentation — all displaying astonishing obedience to the divine proportion.

"this is amazing!" someone cried out.

"yeah," someone else said, "but what does it have to do with art?"

"aha!" langdon said. "glad you asked." he pulled up another slide — a pale yellow parchment
displaying leonardo da vinci's famous male nude — the vitruvian man — named for marcus
vitruvius, the brilliant roman architect who praised the divine proportion in his text de
architectura.

"nobody understood better than da vinci the divine structure of the human body. da vinci
actually exhumed corpses to measure the exact proportions of human bone structure. he was the
first to show that the human body is literally made of building blocks whose proportional ratios
always equal phi."

everyone in class gave him a dubious look.

"don't believe me?" langdon challenged. "next time you're in the shower, take a tape measure."

a couple of football players snickered.

"not just you insecure jocks," langdon prompted. "all of you. guys and girls. try it. measure the
distance from the tip of your head to the floor. then divide that by the distance from your belly
button to the floor. guess what number you get."

"not phi!" one of the jocks blurted out in disbelief.

"yes, phi," langdon replied. "one-point-six-one-eight. want another example? measure the
distance from your shoulder to your fingertips, and then divide it by the distance from your elbow
to your fingertips. phi again. another? hip to floor divided by knee to floor. phi again. finger
joints. toes. spinal divisions. phi. phi. phi. my friends, each of you is a walking tribute to the
divine proportion. "

even in the darkness, langdon could see they were all astounded. he felt a familiar warmth inside.
this is why he taught. "my friends, as you can see, the chaos of the world has an underlying order.
when the ancients discovered phi, they were certain they had stumbled across god's building



block for the world, and they worshipped nature because of that. and one can understand why.
god's hand is evident in nature, and even to this day there exist pagan, mother earth-revering
religions. many of us celebrate nature the way the pagans did, and don't even know it. may day is
a perfect example, the celebration of spring... the earth coming back to life to produce her bounty.
the mysterious magic inherent in the divine proportion was written at the beginning of time. man
is simply playing by nature's rules, and because art is man's attempt to imitate the beauty of the
creator's hand, you can imagine we might be seeing a lot of instances of the divine proportion in
art this semester."

over the next half hour, langdon showed them slides of artwork by michelangelo, albrecht diirer,
da vinci, and many others, demonstrating each artist's intentional and rigorous adherence to the
divine proportion in the layout of his compositions. langdon unveiled phi in the architectural
dimensions of the greek parthenon, the pyramids of egypt, and even the united nations building
in new york. phi appeared in the organizational structures of mozart's sonatas, beethoven's fifth
symphony, as well as the works of bartok, debussy, and schubert. the number phi, langdon told
them, was even used by stradivarius to calculate the exact placement of the f-holes in the
construction of his famous violins.

"in closing," langdon said, walking to the chalkboard, "we return to symbols" he drew five
intersecting lines that formed a five-pointed star. "this symbol is one of the most powerful images
you will see this term. formally known as a pentagram — or pentacle, as the ancients called it — this
symbol is considered both divine and magical by many cultures. can anyone tell me why that
might be?"

stettner, the math major, raised his hand. "because if you draw a pentagram, the lines
automatically divide themselves into segments according to the divine proportion."

langdon gave the kid a proud nod. "nice job. yes, the ratios of line segments in a pentacle all
equal phi, making this symbol the ultimate expression of the divine proportion. for this reason,
the five-pointed star has always been the symbol for beauty and perfection associated with the
goddess and the sacred feminine."

the girls in class beamed.

"one note, folks. we've only touched on da vinci today, but we'll be seeing a lot more of him this
semester. leonardo was a well-documented devotee of the ancient ways of the goddess.
tomorrow, i'll show you his fresco the last supper, which is one of the most astonishing tributes
to the sacred feminine you will ever see."



"you're kidding, right?" somebody said. "i thought the last supper was about jesus!'
langdon winked. "there are symbols hidden in places you would never imagine."



"come on," sophie whispered. "what's wrong? we're almost there. hurry!"

langdon glanced up, feeling himself return from faraway thoughts. he realized he was standing at
a dead stop on the stairs, paralyzed by sudden revelation.

o, draconian devil! oh, lame saint!

sophie was looking back at him.

it can 't be that simple, langdon thought.

but he knew of course that it was.

there in the bowels of the louvre... with images of phi and da vinci swirling through his mind,
robert langdon suddenly and unexpectedly deciphered sauniere's code.

"o, draconian devil!" he said. "oh, lame saint! it's the simplest kind of code!"



sophie was stopped on the stairs below him, staring up in confusion. a code? she had been
pondering the words all night and had not seen a code. especially a simple one.

"you said it yourself." langdon's voice reverberated with excitement. "fibonacci numbers only
have meaning in their proper order. otherwise they're mathematical gibberish. "

sophie had no idea what he was talking about. the fibonacci numbers? she was certain they had
been intended as nothing more than a means to get the cryptography department involved tonight.
they have another purpose? she plunged her hand into her pocket and pulled out the printout,
studying her grandfather's message again.

13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5

o, draconian devil !

oh, lame saint!



what about the numbers ?

"the scrambled fibonacci sequence is a clue," langdon said, taking the printout. "the numbers are
a hint as to how to decipher the rest of the message. he wrote the sequence out of order to tell us to
apply the same concept to the text. o, draconian devil? oh, lame saint? those lines mean nothing.



they are simply letters written out of order."

sophie needed only an instant to process langdon's implication, and it seemed laughably simple.
"you think this message is... une anagramme?" she stared at him. "like a word jumble from a
newspaper?"

langdon could see the skepticism on sophie's face and certainly understood. few people realized
that anagrams, despite being a trite modern amusement, had a rich history of sacred symbolism.

the mystical teachings of the kabbala drew heavily on anagrams — rearranging the letters of
hebrew words to derive new meanings. french kings throughout the renaissance were so
convinced that anagrams held magic power that they appointed royal anagrammatists to help them
make better decisions by analyzing words in important documents. the romans actually referred
to the study of anagrams as ars magna — "the great art."

langdon looked up at sophie, locking eyes with her now. "your grandfather's meaning was right
in front of us all along, and he left us more than enough clues to see it. "

without another word, langdon pulled a pen from his jacket pocket and rearranged the letters in
each line.

o, draconian devil! oh, lame saint!

was a perfect anagram of...

leonardo da vinci! the mona lisa!



chapter 21

the mona lisa.

for an instant, standing in the exit stairwell, sophie forgot all about trying to leave the louvre.

her shock over the anagram was matched only by her embarrassment at not having deciphered the
message herself. sophie's expertise in complex cryptanalysis had caused her to overlook simplistic
word games, and yet she knew she should have seen it. after all, she was no stranger to
anagrams — especially in english.

when she was young, often her grandfather would use anagram games to hone her english
spelling. once he had written the english word "planets" and told sophie that an astonishing sixty-
two other english words of varying lengths could be formed using those same letters. sophie had



spent three days with an english dictionary until she found them all.

"i can't imagine," langdon said, staring at the printout, "how your grandfather created such an
intricate anagram in the minutes before he died."

sophie knew the explanation, and the realization made her feel even worse. / should have seen this!
she now recalled that her grandfather — a wordplay aficionado and art lover — had entertained
himself as a young man by creating anagrams of famous works of art. in fact, one of his anagrams
had gotten him in trouble once when sophie was a little girl. while being interviewed by an
american art magazine, sauniere had expressed his distaste for the modernist cubist movement by
noting that picasso's masterpiece les demoiselles d 'avignon was a perfect anagram of vile
meaningless doodles. picasso fans were not amused.

"my grandfather probably created this mona lisa anagram long ago," sophie said, glancing up at
langdon. and tonight he was forced to use it as a makeshift code. her grandfather's voice had
called out from beyond with chilling precision.

leonardo da vinci!

the mona lisa!

why his final words to her referenced the famous painting, sophie had no idea, but she could think
of only one possibility. a disturbing one.

those were not his final words....

was she supposed to visit the mona lisa? had her grandfather left her a message there? the idea
seemed perfectly plausible. after all, the famous painting hung in the salle des etats — a private
viewing chamber accessible only from the grand gallery. in fact, sophie now realized, the doors
that opened into the chamber were situated only twenty meters from where her grandfather had
been found dead.

he easily could have visited the mona lisa before he died.

sophie gazed back up the emergency stairwell and felt torn. she knew she should usher langdon
from the museum immediately, and yet instinct urged her to the contrary. as sophie recalled her
first childhood visit to the denon wing, she realized that if her grandfather had a secret to tell her,
few places on earth made a more apt rendezvous than da vinci's mona lisa.



"she's just a little bit farther," her grandfather had whispered, clutching sophie's tiny hand as he led
her through the deserted museum after hours.



sophie was six years old. she felt small and insignificant as she gazed up at the enormous ceilings
and down at the dizzying floor. the empty museum frightened her, although she was not about to
let her grandfather know that. she set her jaw firmly and let go of his hand.

"up ahead is the salle des etats," her grandfather said as they approached the louvre's most
famous room. despite her grandfather's obvious excitement, sophie wanted to go home. she had
seen pictures of the mona lisa in books and didn't like it at all. she couldn't understand why
everyone made such a fuss.

"c'est ennuyeux, " sophie grumbled.

"boring," he corrected. "french at school. english at home."

"le louvre, c'est pas chez moil" she challenged.

he gave her a tired laugh. "right you are. then let's speak english just for fun."

sophie pouted and kept walking. as they entered the salle des etats, her eyes scanned the narrow
room and settled on the obvious spot of honor — the center of the right-hand wall, where a lone
portrait hung behind a protective plexiglas wall. her grandfather paused in the doorway and
motioned toward the painting.

"go ahead, sophie. not many people get a chance to visit her alone."

swallowing her apprehension, sophie moved slowly across the room. after everything she'd heard
about the mona lisa, she felt as if she were approaching royalty. arriving in front of the protective
plexiglas, sophie held her breath and looked up, taking it in all at once.

sophie was not sure what she had expected to feel, but it most certainly was not this. no jolt of
amazement. no instant of wonder. the famous face looked as it did in books. she stood in silence
for what felt like forever, waiting for something to happen.

"so what do you think?" her grandfather whispered, arriving behind her. "beautiful, yes?"

"she's too little."

sauniere smiled. "you're little and you're beautiful."

/ am not beautiful, she thought. sophie hated her red hair and freckles, and she was bigger than all
the boys in her class. she looked back at the mona lisa and shook her head. "she's even worse
than in the books. her face is... brumeux. "



"foggy," her grandfather tutored.

"foggy," sophie repeated, knowing the conversation would not continue until she repeated her new
vocabulary word.

"that's called the sfumato style of painting," he told her, "and it's very hard to do. leonardo da
vinci was better at it than anyone."

sophie still didn't like the painting. "she looks like she knows something... like when kids at school
have a secret. "

her grandfather laughed. "that's part of why she is so famous. people like to guess why she is
smiling."

"do you know why she's smiling?"

"maybe." her grandfather winked. "someday i'll tell you all about it."

sophie stamped her foot. "i told you i don't like secrets!"

"princess," he smiled. "life is filled with secrets. you can't learn them all at once."



"i'm going back up," sophie declared, her voice hollow in the stairwell.

"to the mona lisa?" langdon recoiled. "now?"

sophie considered the risk. "i'm not a murder suspect. i'll take my chances. i need to understand
what my grandfather was trying to tell me."

"what about the embassy?"

sophie felt guilty turning langdon into a fugitive only to abandon him, but she saw no other
option. she pointed down the stairs to a metal door. "go through that door, and follow the
illuminated exit signs. my grandfather used to bring me down here. the signs will lead you to a
security turnstile. it's monodirectional and opens out." she handed langdon her car keys. "mine is
the red smartcar in the employee lot. directly outside this bulkhead. do you know how to get to
the embassy?"

langdon nodded, eyeing the keys in his hand.

"listen," sophie said, her voice softening. "i think my grandfather may have left me a message at



the mona lisa — some kind of clue as to who killed him. or why i'm in danger." or what happened
to my family. "i have to go see."

"but if he wanted to tell you why you were in danger, why wouldn't he simply write it on the floor
where he died? why this complicated word game?"

"whatever my grandfather was trying to tell me, i don't think he wanted anyone else to hear it. not
even the police." clearly, her grandfather had done everything in his power to send a confidential
transmission directly to her. he had written it in code, included her secret initials, and told her to
find robert langdon — a wise command, considering the american symbologist had deciphered his
code. "as strange as it may sound," sophie said, "i think he wants me to get to the mona lisa
before anyone else does."

"i'llcome."

"no! we don't know how long the grand gallery will stay empty. you have to go."

langdon seemed hesitant, as if his own academic curiosity were threatening to override sound
judgment and drag him back into fache's hands.

"go. now." sophie gave him a grateful smile. "i'll see you at the embassy, mr. langdon."

langdon looked displeased. "i'll meet you there on one condition," he replied, his voice stern.

she paused, startled. "what's that?"

"that you stop calling me mr. langdon."

sophie detected the faint hint of a lopsided grin growing across langdon's face, and she felt herself
smile back. "good luck, robert."



when langdon reached the landing at the bottom of the stairs, the unmistakable smell of linseed
oil and plaster dust assaulted his nostrils. ahead, an illuminated sortie/exit displayed an arrow
pointing down a long corridor.

langdon stepped into the hallway.

to the right gaped a murky restoration studio out of which peered an army of statues in various
states of repair. to the left, langdon saw a suite of studios that resembled harvard art
classrooms — rows of easels, paintings, palettes, framing tools — an art assembly line.



as he moved down the hallway, langdon wondered if at any moment he might awake with a start
in his bed in cambridge. the entire evening had felt like a bizarre dream. i'm about to dash out of
the louvre... a fugitive.

sauniere's clever anagrammatic message was still on his mind, and langdon wondered what
sophie would find at the mona lisa... if anything. she had seemed certain her grandfather meant
for her to visit the famous painting one more time. as plausible an interpretation as this seemed,
langdon felt haunted now by a troubling paradox.

p.s. find robert langdon.

sauniere had written langdon's name on the floor, commanding sophie to find him. but why?
merely so langdon could help her break an anagram?

it seemed quite unlikely.

after all, sauniere had no reason to think langdon was especially skilled at anagrams. we've never
even met. more important, sophie had stated flat out that she should have broken the anagram on
her own. it had been sophie who spotted the fibonacci sequence, and, no doubt, sophie who, if
given a little more time, would have deciphered the message with no help from langdon.

sophie was supposed to break that anagram on her own. langdon was suddenly feeling more
certain about this, and yet the conclusion left an obvious gaping lapse in the logic of sauniere's
actions.

why me? langdon wondered, heading down the hall. why was sauniere's dying wish that his
estranged granddaughter find me? what is it that sauniere thinks i know?

with an unexpected jolt, langdon stopped short. eyes wide, he dug in his pocket and yanked out
the computer printout. he stared at the last line of sauniere's message.

p.s. find robert langdon.

he fixated on two letters.

p.s.

in that instant, langdon felt sauniere's puzzling mix of symbolism fall into stark focus. like a peal
of thunder, a career's worth of symbology and history came crashing down around him. everything
jacques sauniere had done tonight suddenly made perfect sense.

langdon's thoughts raced as he tried to assemble the implications of what this all meant. wheeling,
he stared back in the direction from which he had come.



is there time ?

he knew it didn't matter.

without hesitation, langdon broke into a sprint back toward the stairs.



chapter 22

kneeling in the first pew, silas pretended to pray as he scanned the layout of the sanctuary. saint-
sulpice, like most churches, had been built in the shape of a giant roman cross. its long central
section — the nave — led directly to the main altar, where it was transversely intersected by a shorter
section, known as the transept. the intersection of nave and transept occurred directly beneath the
main cupola and was considered the heart of the church... her most sacred and mystical point.

not tonight, silas thought. saint-sulpice hides her secrets elsewhere.

turning his head to the right, he gazed into the south transept, toward the open area of floor beyond
the end of the pews, to the object his victims had described.

there it is.

embedded in the gray granite floor, a thin polished strip of brass glistened in the stone... a golden
line slanting across the church's floor. the line bore graduated markings, like a ruler. it was a
gnomon, silas had been told, a pagan astronomical device like a sundial. tourists, scientists,
historians, and pagans from around the world came to saint-sulpice to gaze upon this famous line.

the rose line.

slowly, silas let his eyes trace the path of the brass strip as it made its way across the floor from
his right to left, slanting in front of him at an awkward angle, entirely at odds with the symmetry of
the church. slicing across the main altar itself, the line looked to silas like a slash wound across a
beautiful face. the strip cleaved the communion rail in two and then crossed the entire width of the
church, finally reaching the corner of the north transept, where it arrived at the base of a most
unexpected structure.

a colossal egyptian obelisk.

here, the glistening rose line took a ninety-degree vertical turn and continued directly up the face
of the obelisk itself, ascending thirty-three feet to the very tip of the pyramidical apex, where it
finally ceased.



the rose line, silas thought. the brotherhood hid the keystone at the rose line.

earlier tonight, when silas told the teacher that the priory keystone was hidden inside saint-
sulpice, the teacher had sounded doubtful. but when silas added that the brothers had all given
him a precise location, with relation to a brass line running through saint-sulpice, the teacher had
gasped with revelation. "you speak of the rose line!"

the teacher quickly told silas of saint-sulpice's famed architectural oddity — a strip of brass that
segmented the sanctuary on a perfect north-south axis. it was an ancient sundial of sorts, a vestige
of the pagan temple that had once stood on this very spot. the sun's rays, shining through the
oculus on the south wall, moved farther down the line every day, indicating the passage of time,
from solstice to solstice.

the north-south stripe had been known as the rose line. for centuries, the symbol of the rose had
been associated with maps and guiding souls in the proper direction. the compass rose — drawn
on almost every map — indicated north, east, south, and west. originally known as the wind
rose, it denoted the directions of the thirty-two winds, blowing from the directions of eight major
winds, eight half-winds, and sixteen quarter-winds. when diagrammed inside a circle, these thirty-
two points of the compass perfectly resembled a traditional thirty-two petal rose bloom. to this
day, the fundamental navigational tool was still known as a compass rose, its northernmost
direction still marked by an arrowhead... or, more commonly, the symbol of the fleur-de-lis.

on a globe, a rose line — also called a meridian or longitude — was any imaginary line drawn from
the north pole to the south pole. there were, of course, an infinite number of rose lines because
every point on the globe could have a longitude drawn through it connecting north and south poles.
the question for early navigators was which of these lines would be called the rose line — the zero
longitude — the line from which all other longitudes on earth would be measured.

today that line was in greenwich, england.

but it had not always been.

long before the establishment of greenwich as the prime meridian, the zero longitude of the entire
world had passed directly through paris, and through the church of saint-sulpice. the brass
marker in saint-sulpice was a memorial to the world's first prime meridian, and although
greenwich had stripped paris of the honor in 1888, the original rose line was still visible today.

"and so the legend is true," the teacher had told silas. "the priory keystone has been said to lie
'beneath the sign of the rose.' "

now, still on his knees in a pew, silas glanced around the church and listened to make sure no one
was there. for a moment, he thought he heard a rustling in the choir balcony. he turned and gazed



up for several seconds. nothing.

/ am alone.

standing now, he faced the altar and genuflected three times. then he turned left and followed the
brass line due north toward the obelisk.



at that moment, at leonardo da vinci international airport in rome, the jolt of tires hitting the
runway startled bishop aringarosa from his slumber.

/ drifted off, he thought, impressed he was relaxed enough to sleep.

"benvenuto a roma, " the intercom announced.

sitting up, aringarosa straightened his black cassock and allowed himself a rare smile. this was
one trip he had been happy to make. / have been on the defensive for too long. tonight, however,
the rules had changed. only five months ago, aringarosa had feared for the future of the faith.
now, as if by the will of god, the solution had presented itself.

divine intervention.

if all went as planned tonight in paris, aringarosa would soon be in possession of something that
would make him the most powerful man in christendom.



chapter 23

sophie arrived breathless outside the large wooden doors of the salle des etats — the room that
housed the mona lisa. before entering, she gazed reluctantly farther down the hall, twenty yards or
so, to the spot where her grandfather's body still lay under the spotlight.

the remorse that gripped her was powerful and sudden, a deep sadness laced with guilt. the man
had reached out to her so many times over the past ten years, and yet sophie had remained
immovable — leaving his letters and packages unopened in a bottom drawer and denying his efforts
to see her. he lied to me! kept appalling secrets! what was i supposed to do ? and so she had
blocked him out. completely.

now her grandfather was dead, and he was talking to her from the grave.

the mona lisa.



she reached for the huge wooden doors, and pushed. the entryway yawned open. sophie stood on
the threshold a moment, scanning the large rectangular chamber beyond. it too was bathed in a soft
red light. the salle des etats was one of this museum's rare culs-de-sac — a dead end and the only
room off the middle of the grand gallery. this door, the chamber's sole point of entry, faced a
dominating fifteen-foot botticelli on the far wall. beneath it, centered on the parquet floor, an
immense octagonal viewing divan served as a welcome respite for thousands of visitors to rest their
legs while they admired the louvre's most valuable asset.

even before sophie entered, though, she knew she was missing something. a black light. she
gazed down the hall at her grandfather under the lights in the distance, surrounded by electronic
gear. if he had written anything in here, he almost certainly would have written it with the
watermark stylus.

taking a deep breath, sophie hurried down to the well-lit crime scene. unable to look at her
grandfather, she focused solely on the pts tools. finding a small ultraviolet penlight, she slipped it
in the pocket of her sweater and hurried back up the hallway toward the open doors of the salle des
etats.

sophie turned the corner and stepped over the threshold. her entrance, however, was met by an
unexpected sound of muffled footsteps racing toward her from inside the chamber. there 's
someone in here! a ghostly figure emerged suddenly from out of the reddish haze. sophie jumped
back.

"there you are!" langdon's hoarse whisper cut the air as his silhouette slid to a stop in front of her.

her relief was only momentary. "robert, i told you to get out of here! if fache — "

"where were you?"

"i had to get the black light," she whispered, holding it up. "if my grandfather left me a message — "

"sophie, listen." langdon caught his breath as his blue eyes held her firmly. "the letters p.s.... do
they mean anything else to you? anything at all?"

afraid their voices might echo down the hall, sophie pulled him into the salle des etats and closed
the enormous twin doors silently, sealing them inside. "i told you, the initials mean princess
sophie."

"i know, but did you ever see them anywhere else? did your grandfather ever use p.s. in any other
way? as a monogram, or maybe on stationery or a personal item?"

the question startled her. how would robert know that? sophie had indeed seen the initials p.s.



once before, in a kind of monogram. it was the day before her ninth birthday. she was secretly
combing the house, searching for hidden birthday presents. even then, she could not bear secrets
kept from her. what did grand-pere get for me this year? she dug through cupboards and drawers.
did he get me the doll i wanted? where would he hide it?

finding nothing in the entire house, sophie mustered the courage to sneak into her grandfather's
bedroom. the room was off-limits to her, but her grandfather was downstairs asleep on the couch.

i'll just take a fast peek!

tiptoeing across the creaky wood floor to his closet, sophie peered on the shelves behind his
clothing. nothing. next she looked under the bed. still nothing. moving to his bureau, she opened
the drawers and one by one began pawing carefully through them. there must be something for me
here! as she reached the bottom drawer, she still had not found any hint of a doll. dejected, she
opened the final drawer and pulled aside some black clothes she had never seen him wear. she was
about to close the drawer when her eyes caught a glint of gold in the back of the drawer. it looked
like a pocket watch chain, but she knew he didn't wear one. her heart raced as she realized what it
must be.

a necklace!

sophie carefully pulled the chain from the drawer. to her surprise, on the end was a brilliant gold
key. heavy and shimmering. spellbound, she held it up. it looked like no key she had ever seen.
most keys were flat with jagged teeth, but this one had a triangular column with little pockmarks
all over it. its large golden head was in the shape of a cross, but not a normal cross. this was an
even-armed one, like a plus sign. embossed in the middle of the cross was a strange symbol — two
letters intertwined with some kind of flowery design.

"p.s.," she whispered, scowling as she read the letters. whatever could this be?

"sophie?" her grandfather spoke from the doorway.

startled, she spun, dropping the key on the floor with a loud clang. she stared down at the key,
afraid to look up at her grandfather's face. "i... was looking for my birthday present," she said,
hanging her head, knowing she had betrayed his trust.

for what seemed like an eternity, her grandfather stood silently in the doorway. finally, he let out a
long troubled breath. "pick up the key, sophie."

sophie retrieved the key.

her grandfather walked in. "sophie, you need to respect other people's privacy." gently, he knelt
down and took the key from her. "this key is very special. if you had lost it..."



her grandfather's quiet voice made sophie feel even worse. "i'm sorry, grand-pere. i really am."
she paused. "i thought it was a necklace for my birthday."

he gazed at her for several seconds. "i'll say this once more, sophie, because it's important. you
need to learn to respect other people's privacy."

"yes, grand-pere. "

"we'll talk about this some other time. right now, the garden needs to be weeded."

sophie hurried outside to do her chores.

the next morning, sophie received no birthday present from her grandfather. she hadn't expected
one, not after what she had done. but he didn't even wish her happy birthday all day. sadly, she
trudged up to bed that night. as she climbed in, though, she found a note card lying on her pillow.
on the card was written a simple riddle. even before she solved the riddle, she was smiling. / know
what this is! her grandfather had done this for her last christmas morning.

a treasure hunt!

eagerly, she pored over the riddle until she solved it. the solution pointed her to another part of the
house, where she found another card and another riddle. she solved this one too, racing on to the
next card. running wildly, she darted back and forth across the house, from clue to clue, until at
last she found a clue that directed her back to her own bedroom. sophie dashed up the stairs,
rushed into her room, and stopped in her tracks. there in the middle of the room sat a shining red
bicycle with a ribbon tied to the handlebars. sophie shrieked with delight.

"i know you asked for a doll," her grandfather said, smiling in the corner. "i thought you might like
this even better."

the next day, her grandfather taught her to ride, running beside her down the walkway. when
sophie steered out over the thick lawn and lost her balance, they both went tumbling onto the
grass, rolling and laughing.

"grand-pere, " sophie said, hugging him. "i'm really sorry about the key."

"i know, sweetie. you're forgiven. i can't possibly stay mad at you. grandfathers and
granddaughters always forgive each other. "

sophie knew she shouldn't ask, but she couldn't help it. "what does it open? i never saw a key like
that. it was very pretty."

her grandfather was silent a long moment, and sophie could see he was uncertain how to answer.



grand-pere never lies. "it opens a box," he finally said. "where i keep many secrets."

sophie pouted. "i hate secrets!"

"i know, but these are important secrets. and someday, you'll learn to appreciate them as much as i
do."

"i saw letters on the key, and a flower."

"yes, that's my favorite flower. it's called a fleur-de-lis. we have them in the garden. the white
ones. in english we call that kind of flower a lily."

"i know those! they're my favorite too!"

"then i'll make a deal with you." her grandfather's eyebrows raised the way they always did when
he was about to give her a challenge. "if you can keep my key a secret, and never talk about it ever
again, to me or anybody, then someday i will give it to you."

sophie couldn't believe her ears. "you will?"

"i promise. when the time comes, the key will be yours. it has your name on it."

sophie scowled. "no it doesn't. it said p.s. my name isn't p.s.!"

her grandfather lowered his voice and looked around as if to make sure no one was listening.
"okay, sophie, if you must know, p.s. is a code. it's your secret initials."

her eyes went wide. "i have secret initials?"

"of course. granddaughters always have secret initials that only their grandfathers know."

"ps.?"

he tickled her. "princesse sophie. "

she giggled. "i'm not a princess!"

he winked. "you are to me."

from that day on, they never again spoke of the key. and she became his princess sophie.



inside the salle des etats, sophie stood in silence and endured the sharp pang of loss.

"the initials," langdon whispered, eyeing her strangely. "have you seen them?"

sophie sensed her grandfather's voice whispering in the corridors of the museum. never speak of
this key, sophie. to me or to anyone. she knew she had failed him in forgiveness, and she
wondered if she could break his trust again. p.s. find robert langdon. her grandfather wanted
langdon to help. sophie nodded. "yes, i saw the initials p.s. once. when i was very young."

"where?"

sophie hesitated. "on something very important to him."

langdon locked eyes with her. "sophie, this is crucial. can you tell me if the initials appeared with
a symbol? a fleur-de-lis?"

sophie felt herself staggering backward in amazement. "but... how could you possibly know that!"

langdon exhaled and lowered his voice. "i'm fairly certain your grandfather was a member of a
secret society. a very old covert brotherhood."

sophie felt a knot tighten in her stomach. she was certain of it too. for ten years she had tried to
forget the incident that had confirmed that horrifying fact for her. she had witnessed something
unthinkable. unforgivable.

"the fleur-de-lis," langdon said, "combined with the initials p.s., that is the brotherhood's official
device. their coat of arms. their logo."

"how do you know this?" sophie was praying langdon was not going to tell her that he himself
was a member.

"i've written about this group," he said, his voice tremulous with excitement. "researching the
symbols of secret societies is a specialty of mine. they call themselves the prieure de sion — the
priory of sion. they're based here in france and attract powerful members from all over europe. in
fact, they are one of the oldest surviving secret societies on earth. "

sophie had never heard of them.

langdon was talking in rapid bursts now. "the priory's membership has included some of history's
most cultured individuals: men like botticelli, sir isaac newton, victor hugo." he paused, his
voice brimming now with academic zeal. "and, leonardo da vinci."

sophie stared. "da vinci was in a secret society?"



"da vinci presided over the priory between 1510 and 1519 as the brotherhood's grand master,
which might help explain your grandfather's passion for leonardo's work. the two men share a
historical fraternal bond. and it all fits perfectly with their fascination for goddess iconology,
paganism, feminine deities, and contempt for the church. the priory has a well-documented
history of reverence for the sacred feminine."

"you're telling me this group is a pagan goddess worship cult?"

"more like the pagan goddess worship cult. but more important, they are known as the guardians
of an ancient secret. one that made them immeasurably powerful."

despite the total conviction in langdon's eyes, sophie's gut reaction was one of stark disbelief. a
secret pagan cult? once headed by leonardo da vinci? it all sounded utterly absurd. and yet, even
as she dismissed it, she felt her mind reeling back ten years — to the night she had mistakenly
surprised her grandfather and witnessed what she still could not accept. could that explain — ?

"the identities of living priory members are kept extremely secret," langdon said, "but the p.s.
and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child are proof. it could only have been related to the priory."

sophie realized now that langdon knew far more about her grandfather than she had previously
imagined. this american obviously had volumes to share with her, but this was not the place. "i
can't afford to let them catch you, robert. there's a lot we need to discuss. you need to go!"



langdon heard only the faint murmur of her voice. he wasn't going anywhere. he was lost in
another place now. a place where ancient secrets rose to the surface. a place where forgotten
histories emerged from the shadows.

slowly, as if moving underwater, langdon turned his head and gazed through the reddish haze
toward the mona lisa.

the fleur-de-lis... the flower of lisa... the mona lisa.

it was all intertwined, a silent symphony echoing the deepest secrets of the priory of sion and
leonardo da vinci.



a few miles away, on the riverbank beyond les invalides, the bewildered driver of a twin-bed
trailor truck stood at gunpoint and watched as the captain of the judicial police let out a guttural
roar of rage and heaved a bar of soap out into the turgid waters of the seine.



chapter 24

silas gazed upward at the saint-sulpice obelisk, taking in the length of the massive marble shaft.
his sinews felt taut with exhilaration. he glanced around the church one more time to make sure he
was alone. then he knelt at the base of the structure, not out of reverence, but out of necessity.

the keystone is hidden beneath the rose line.

at the base of the sulpice obelisk.

all the brothers had concurred.

on his knees now, silas ran his hands across the stone floor. he saw no cracks or markings to
indicate a movable tile, so he began rapping softly with his knuckles on the floor. following the
brass line closer to the obelisk, he knocked on each tile adjacent to the brass line. finally, one of
them echoed strangely.

there's a hollow area beneath the floor!

silas smiled. his victims had spoken the truth.

standing, he searched the sanctuary for something with which to break the floor tile.



high above silas, in the balcony, sister sandrine stifled a gasp. her darkest fears had just been
confirmed. this visitor was not who he seemed. the mysterious opus dei monk had come to saint-
sulpice for another purpose.

a secret purpose.

you are not the only one with secrets, she thought.

sister sandrine bieil was more than the keeper of this church. she was a sentry. and tonight, the
ancient wheels had been set in motion. the arrival of this stranger at the base of the obelisk was a
signal from the brotherhood.

it was a silent call of distress.



chapter 25

the u.s. embassy in paris is a compact complex on avenue gabriel, just north of the champs-
elysees. the three-acre compound is considered u.s. soil, meaning all those who stand on it are
subject to the same laws and protections as they would encounter standing in the united states.

the embassy's night operator was reading time magazine's international edition when the sound of
her phone interrupted.

"u.s. embassy," she answered.

"good evening." the caller spoke english accented with french. "i need some assistance." despite
the politeness of the man's words, his tone sounded gruff and official. "i was told you had a phone
message for me on your automated system. the name is langdon. unfortunately, i have forgotten
my three-digit access code. if you could help me, i would be most grateful."

the operator paused, confused. "i'm sorry, sir. your message must be quite old. that system was
removed two years ago for security precautions. moreover, all the access codes were five-digit.
who told you we had a message for you?"

"you have no automated phone system?"

"no, sir. any message for you would be handwritten in our services department. what was your
name again?"

but the man had hung up.



bezu fache felt dumbstruck as he paced the banks of the seine. he was certain he had seen
langdon dial a local number, enter a three-digit code, and then listen to a recording. but if langdon
didn't phone the embassy, then who the hell did he call?

it was at that moment, eyeing his cellular phone, that fache realized the answers were in the palm
of his hand. langdon used my phone to place that call.

keying into the cell phone's menu, fache pulled up the list of recently dialed numbers and found
the call langdon had placed.

a paris exchange, followed by the three-digit code 454.

redialing the phone number, fache waited as the line began ringing.



finally a woman's voice answered. "bonjour, vous etes bien chez sophie neveu, " the recording
announced. "je suis absente pour le moment, mais..."

fache's blood was boiling as he typed the numbers 4... 5... 4.



chapter 26

despite her monumental reputation, the mona lisa was a mere thirty-one inches by twenty-one
inches — smaller even than the posters of her sold in the louvre gift shop. she hung on the
northwest wall of the salle des etats behind a two-inch-thick pane of protective plexiglas. painted
on a poplar wood panel, her ethereal, mist-filled atmosphere was attributed to da vinci's mastery
of the sfumato style, in which forms appear to evaporate into one another.

since taking up residence in the louvre, the mona lisa — or la jaconde as they call her in
france — had been stolen twice, most recently in 1911, when she disappeared from the louvre's
"satte impenetrable" — le salon carre. parisians wept in the streets and wrote newspaper articles
begging the thieves for the painting's return. two years later, the mona lisa was discovered hidden
in the false bottom of a trunk in a florence hotel room.

langdon, now having made it clear to sophie that he had no intention of leaving, moved with her
across the salle des etats. the mona lisa was still twenty yards ahead when sophie turned on the
black light, and the bluish crescent of penlight fanned out on the floor in front of them. she swung
the beam back and forth across the floor like a minesweeper, searching for any hint of luminescent
ink.

walking beside her, langdon was already feeling the tingle of anticipation that accompanied his
face-to-face reunions with great works of art. he strained to see beyond the cocoon of purplish
light emanating from the black light in sophie's hand. to the left, the room's octagonal viewing
divan emerged, looking like a dark island on the empty sea of parquet.

langdon could now begin to see the panel of dark glass on the wall. behind it, he knew, in the
confines of her own private cell, hung the most celebrated painting in the world.

the mona lisa 's status as the most famous piece of art in the world, langdon knew, had nothing to
do with her enigmatic smile. nor was it due to the mysterious interpretations attributed her by
many art historians and conspiracy buffs. quite simply, the mona lisa was famous because
leonardo da vinci claimed she was his finest accomplishment. he carried the painting with him
whenever he traveled and, if asked why, would reply that he found it hard to part with his most
sublime expression of female beauty.



even so, many art historians suspected da vinci's reverence for the mona lisa had nothing to do
with its artistic mastery. in actuality, the painting was a surprisingly ordinary sfumato portrait. da
vinci's veneration for this work, many claimed, stemmed from something far deeper: a hidden
message in the layers of paint. the mona lisa was, in fact, one of the world's most documented
inside jokes. the painting's well-documented collage of double entendres and playful allusions had
been revealed in most art history tomes, and yet, incredibly, the public at large still considered her
smile a great mystery.

no mystery at all, langdon thought, moving forward and watching as the faint outline of the
painting began to take shape. no mystery at all.

most recently langdon had shared the mona lisa 's secret with a rather unlikely group — a dozen
inmates at the essex county penitentiary. langdon's jail seminar was part of a harvard outreach
program attempting to bring education into the prison system — culture for convicts, as langdon's
colleagues liked to call it.

standing at an overhead projector in a darkened penitentiary library, langdon had shared the mona
lisa's secret with the prisoners attending class, men whom he found surprisingly engaged — rough,
but sharp. "you may notice," langdon told them, walking up to the projected image of the mona
lisa on the library wall, "that the background behind her face is uneven." langdon motioned to the
glaring discrepancy. "da vinci painted the horizon line on the left significantly lower than the
right."

"he screwed it up?" one of the inmates asked.

langdon chuckled. "no. da vinci didn't do that too often. actually, this is a little trick da vinci
played. by lowering the countryside on the left, da vinci made mona lisa look much larger from
the left side than from the right side. a little da vinci inside joke. historically, the concepts of
male and female have assigned sides — left is female, and right is male. because da vinci was a big
fan of feminine principles, he made mona lisa look more majestic from the left than the right."

"i heard he was a fag," said a small man with a goatee.

langdon winced. "historians don't generally put it quite that way, but yes, da vinci was a
homosexual."

"is that why he was into that whole feminine thing?"

"actually, da vinci was in tune with the balance between male and female. he believed that a
human soul could not be enlightened unless it had both male and female elements."

"you mean like chicks with dicks?" someone called.



this elicited a hearty round of laughs. langdon considered offering an etymological sidebar about
the word hermaphrodite and its ties to hermes and aphrodite, but something told him it would be
lost on this crowd.

"hey, mr. langford," a muscle-bound man said. "is it true that the mona lisa is a picture of da
vinci in drag? i heard that was true."

"it's quite possible," langdon said. "da vinci was a prankster, and computerized analysis of the
mona lisa and da vinci's self-portraits confirm some startling points of congruency in their faces.
whatever da vinci was up to," langdon said, "his mona lisa is neither male nor female. it carries
a subtle message of androgyny. it is a fusing of both."

"you sure that's not just some harvard bullshit way of saying mona lisa is one ugly chick."

now langdon laughed. "you may be right. but actually da vinci left a big clue that the painting
was supposed to be androgynous. has anyone here ever heard of an egyptian god named anion?"

"hell yes!" the big guy said. "god of masculine fertility!"

langdon was stunned.

"it says so on every box of amon condoms." the muscular man gave a wide grin. "it's got a guy
with a ram's head on the front and says he's the egyptian god of fertility."

langdon was not familiar with the brand name, but he was glad to hear the prophylactic
manufacturers had gotten their hieroglyphs right. "well done. amon is indeed represented as a man
with a ram's head, and his promiscuity and curved horns are related to our modern sexual slang
'horny.' "

"no shit!"

"no shit," langdon said. "and do you know who amon's counterpart was? the egyptian goddess
of fertility?"

the question met with several seconds of silence.

"it was isis," langdon told them, grabbing a grease pen. "so we have the male god, amon." he
wrote it down. "and the female goddess, isis, whose ancient pictogram was once called l'isa."

langdon finished writing and stepped back from the projector.

amon l'isa



"ring any bells?" he asked.

"mona lisa... holy crap," somebody gasped.

langdon nodded. "gentlemen, not only does the face of mona lisa look androgynous, but her
name is an anagram of the divine union of male and female. and that, my friends, is da vinci's
little secret, and the reason for mona lisa's knowing smile."



"my grandfather was here," sophie said, dropping suddenly to her knees, now only ten feet from
the mona lisa. she pointed the black light tentatively to a spot on the parquet floor.

at first langdon saw nothing. then, as he knelt beside her, he saw a tiny droplet of dried liquid
that was luminescing. ink? suddenly he recalled what black lights were actually used for. blood.
his senses tingled. sophie was right. jacques sauniere had indeed paid a visit to the mona lisa
before he died.

"he wouldn't have come here without a reason," sophie whispered, standing up. "i know he left a
message for me here." quickly striding the final few steps to the mona lisa, she illuminated the
floor directly in front of the painting. she waved the light back and forth across the bare parquet.

"there's nothing here!"

at that moment, langdon saw a faint purple glimmer on the protective glass before the mona lisa.
reaching down, he took sophie's wrist and slowly moved the light up to the painting itself.

they both froze.

on the glass, six words glowed in purple, scrawled directly across the mona lisa's face.



chapter 27

seated at sauniere's desk, lieutenant collet pressed the phone to his ear in disbelief. did i hear
fache correctly? "a bar of soap? but how could langdon have known about the gps dot?"

"sophie neveu," fache replied. "she told him."

"what! why?"



"damned good question, but i just heard a recording that confirms she tipped him off."

collet was speechless. what was neveu thinking? fache had proof that sophie had interfered with
a dcpj sting operation? sophie neveu was not only going to be fired, she was also going to jail.
"but, captain... then where is langdon now?"

"have any fire alarms gone off there?"

"no, sir."

"and no one has come out under the grand gallery gate?"

"no. we've got a louvre security officer on the gate. just as you requested."

"okay, langdon must still be inside the grand gallery."

"inside? but what is he doing?"

"is the louvre security guard armed?"

"yes, sir. he's a senior warden."

"send him in," fache commanded. "i can't get my men back to the perimeter for a few minutes,
and i don't want langdon breaking for an exit." fache paused. "and you'd better tell the guard
agent neveu is probably in there with him."

"agent neveu left, i thought."

"did you actually see her leave?"

"no, sir, but—"

"well, nobody on the perimeter saw her leave either. they only saw her go in."

collet was flabbergasted by sophie neveu's bravado. she's still inside the building?

"handle it," fache ordered. "i want langdon and neveu at gunpoint by the time i get back."



as the trailor truck drove off, captain fache rounded up his men. robert langdon had proven an
elusive quarry tonight, and with agent neveu now helping him, he might be far harder to corner
than expected.



fache decided not to take any chances.

hedging his bets, he ordered half of his men back to the louvre perimeter. the other half he sent to
guard the only location in paris where robert langdon could find safe harbor.



chapter 28

inside the salle des etats, langdon stared in astonishment at the six words glowing on the
plexiglas. the text seemed to hover in space, casting a jagged shadow across mona lisa's
mysterious smile.

"the priory," langdon whispered. "this proves your grandfather was a member!"

sophie looked at him in confusion. "you understand this?"

"it's flawless," langdon said, nodding as his thoughts churned. "it's a proclamation of one of the
priory's most fundamental philosophies!"

sophie looked baffled in the glow of the message scrawled across the mona lisa's face.

so dark the con of man



"sophie," langdon said, "the priory's tradition of perpetuating goddess worship is based on a belief
that powerful men in the early christian church 'conned' the world by propagating lies that
devalued the female and tipped the scales in favor of the masculine."

sophie remained silent, staring at the words.

"the priory believes that constantine and his male successors successfully converted the world
from matriarchal paganism to patriarchal christianity by waging a campaign of propaganda that
demonized the sacred feminine, obliterating the goddess from modern religion forever."

sophie's expression remained uncertain. "my grandfather sent me to this spot to find this. he must
be trying to tell me more than that. "

langdon understood her meaning. she thinks this is another code. whether a hidden meaning
existed here or not, langdon could not immediately say. his mind was still grappling with the bold
clarity of sauniere's outward message.



so dark the con of man, he thought. so dark indeed.

nobody could deny the enormous good the modern church did in today's troubled world, and yet
the church had a deceitful and violent history. their brutal crusade to "reeducate" the pagan and
feminine-worshipping religions spanned three centuries, employing methods as inspired as they
were horrific.

the catholic inquisition published the book that arguably could be called the most blood-soaked
publication in human history. malleus maleficarum — or the witches' hammer — indoctrinated the
world to "the dangers of freethinking women" and instructed the clergy how to locate, torture, and
destroy them. those deemed "witches" by the church included all female scholars, priestesses,
gypsies, mystics, nature lovers, herb gatherers, and any women "suspiciously attuned to the natural
world. " midwives also were killed for their heretical practice of using medical knowledge to ease
the pain of childbirth — a suffering, the church claimed, that was god's rightful punishment for
eve's partaking of the apple of knowledge, thus giving birth to the idea of original sin. during
three hundred years of witch hunts, the church burned at the stake an astounding five million
women.

the propaganda and bloodshed had worked.

today's world was living proof.

women, once celebrated as an essential half of spiritual enlightenment, had been banished from the
temples of the world. there were no female orthodox rabbis, catholic priests, nor islamic clerics.
the once hallowed act of hieros gamos — the natural sexual union between man and woman
through which each became spiritually whole — had been recast as a shameful act. holy men who
had once required sexual union with their female counterparts to commune with god now feared
their natural sexual urges as the work of the devil, collaborating with his favorite accomplice...
woman.

not even the feminine association with the left-hand side could escape the church's defamation. in
france and italy, the words for "left" — gauche and sinistra — came to have deeply negative
overtones, while their right-hand counterparts rang of ng/z?eousness, dexterity, and correctness. to
this day, radical thought was considered left wing, irrational thought was left brain, and anything
evil, sinister.

the days of the goddess were over. the pendulum had swung. mother earth had become a man's
world, and the gods of destruction and war were taking their toll. the male ego had spent two
millennia running unchecked by its female counterpart. the priory of sion believed that it was this
obliteration of the sacred feminine in modern life that had caused what the hopi native americans
called koyanisquatsi — "life out of balance" — an unstable situation marked by testosterone-fueled
wars, a plethora of misogynistic societies, and a growing disrespect for mother earth.



"robert!" sophie said, her whisper yanking him back. "someone's coming!"

he heard the approaching footsteps out in the hallway.

"over here!" sophie extinguished the black light and seemed to evaporate before langdon's eyes.

for an instant he felt totally blind. over where! as his vision cleared he saw sophie's silhouette
racing toward the center of the room and ducking out of sight behind the octagonal viewing bench.
he was about to dash after her when a booming voice stopped him cold.

"arretez!" a man commanded from the doorway.

the louvre security agent advanced through the entrance to the salle des etats, his pistol
outstretched, taking deadly aim at langdon's chest.

langdon felt his arms raise instinctively for the ceiling.

"couchez-vous!" the guard commanded. "lie down!"

langdon was face first on the floor in a matter of seconds. the guard hurried over and kicked his
legs apart, spreading langdon out.

"mauvaise idee, monsieur langdon, " he said, pressing the gun hard into langdon's back.
"mauvaise idee. "

face down on the parquet floor with his arms and legs spread wide, langdon found little humor in
the irony of his position. the vitruvian man, he thought. face down.



chapter 29

inside saint-sulpice, silas carried the heavy iron votive candle holder from the altar back toward
the obelisk. the shaft would do nicely as a battering ram. eyeing the gray marble panel that
covered the apparent hollow in the floor, he realized he could not possibly shatter the covering
without making considerable noise.

iron on marble. it would echo off the vaulted ceilings.

would the nun hear him? she should be asleep by now. even so, it was a chance silas preferred
not to take. looking around for a cloth to wrap around the tip of the iron pole, he saw nothing
except the altar's linen mantle, which he refused to defile. my cloak, he thought. knowing he was
alone in the great church, silas untied his cloak and slipped it off his body. as he removed it, he



felt a sting as the wool fibers stuck to the fresh wounds on his back.

naked now, except for his loin swaddle, silas wrapped his cloak over the end of the iron rod. then,
aiming at the center of the floor tile, he drove the tip into it. a muffled thud. the stone did not
break. he drove the pole into it again. again a dull thud, but this time accompanied by a crack. on
the third swing, the covering finally shattered, and stone shards fell into a hollow area beneath the
floor.

a compartment!

quickly pulling the remaining pieces from the opening, silas gazed into the void. his blood
pounded as he knelt down before it. raising his pale bare arm, he reached inside.

at first he felt nothing. the floor of the compartment was bare, smooth stone. then, feeling deeper,
reaching his arm in under the rose line, he touched something! a thick stone tablet. getting his
fingers around the edge, he gripped it and gently lifted the tablet out. as he stood and examined his
find, he realized he was holding a rough-hewn stone slab with engraved words. he felt for an
instant like a modern-day moses.

as silas read the words on the tablet, he felt surprise. he had expected the keystone to be a map, or
a complex series of directions, perhaps even encoded. the keystone, however, bore the simplest of
inscriptions.

job 38:11

a bible verse ? silas was stunned with the devilish simplicity. the secret location of that which
they sought was revealed in a bible verse? the brotherhood stopped at nothing to mock the
righteous!

job. chapter thirty-eight. verse eleven.

although silas did not recall the exact contents of verse eleven by heart, he knew the book of job
told the story of a man whose faith in god survived repeated tests. appropriate, he thought, barely
able to contain his excitement.

looking over his shoulder, he gazed down the shimmering rose line and couldn't help but smile.
there atop the main altar, propped open on a gilded book stand, sat an enormous leather-bound
bible.



up in the balcony, sister sandrine was shaking. moments ago, she had been about to flee and carry
out her orders, when the man below suddenly removed his cloak. when she saw his alabaster-white



flesh, she was overcome with a horrified bewilderment. his broad, pale back was soaked with
blood-red slashes. even from here she could see the wounds were fresh.

this man has been mercilessly whipped!

she also saw the bloody cilice around his thigh, the wound beneath it dripping. what kind of god
would want a body punished this way? the rituals of opus dei, sister sandrine knew, were not
something she would ever understand. but that was hardly her concern at this instant. opus dei is
searching for the keystone. how they knew of it, sister sandrine could not imagine, although she
knew she did not have time to think.

the bloody monk was now quietly donning his cloak again, clutching his prize as he moved toward
the altar, toward the bible.

in breathless silence, sister sandrine left the balcony and raced down the hall to her quarters.
getting on her hands and knees, she reached beneath her wooden bed frame and retrieved the
sealed envelope she had hidden there years ago.

tearing it open, she found four paris phone numbers.

trembling, she began to dial.



downstairs, silas laid the stone tablet on the altar and turned his eager hands to the leather bible.
his long white fingers were sweating now as he turned the pages. flipping through the old
testament, he found the book of job. he located chapter thirty-eight. as he ran his finger down the
column of text, he anticipated the words he was about to read.

they will lead the way!

finding verse number eleven, silas read the text. it was only seven words. confused, he read it
again, sensing something had gone terribly wrong. the verse simply read:

hitherto shalt thou come, but no further.



chapter 30

security warden claude grouard simmered with rage as he stood over his prostrate captive in front
of the mona lisa. this bastard killed jacques sauniere! sauniere had been like a well-loved father
to grouard and his security team.



grouard wanted nothing more than to pull the trigger and bury a bullet in robert langdon's back.
as senior warden, grouard was one of the few guards who actually carried a loaded weapon. he
reminded himself, however, that killing langdon would be a generous fate compared to the misery
about to be communicated by bezu fache and the french prison system.

grouard yanked his walkie-talkie off his belt and attempted to radio for backup. all he heard was
static. the additional electronic security in this chamber always wrought havoc with the guards'
communications. / have to move to the doorway. still aiming his weapon at langdon, grouard
began backing slowly toward the entrance. on his third step, he spied something that made him
stop short.

what the hell is that!

an inexplicable mirage was materializing near the center of the room. a silhouette. there was
someone else in the room? a woman was moving through the darkness, walking briskly toward the
far left wall. in front of her, a purplish beam of light swung back and forth across the floor, as if
she were searching for something with a colored flashlight.

"qui est la ? " grouard demanded, feeling his adrenaline spike for a second time in the last thirty
seconds. he suddenly didn't know where to aim his gun or what direction to move.

"pts," the woman replied calmly, still scanning the floor with her light.

police technique et scientifique. grouard was sweating now. / thought all the agents were gone!
he now recognized the purple light as ultraviolet, consistent with a pts team, and yet he could not
understand why dcpj would be looking for evidence in here.

"votre nom!" grouard yelled, instinct telling him something was amiss. "repondez!"

"c'est mot," the voice responded in calm french. "sophie neveu. "

somewhere in the distant recesses of grouard's mind, the name registered. sophie neveu? that
was the name of sauniere's granddaughter, wasn't it? she used to come in here as a little kid, but
that was years ago. this couldn't possibly be her! and even if it were sophie neveu, that was
hardly a reason to trust her; grouard had heard the rumors of the painful falling-out between
sauniere and his granddaughter.

"you know me," the woman called. "and robert langdon did not kill my grandfather. believe
me."

warden grouard was not about to take that on faith. / need backup! trying his walkie-talkie again,
he got only static. the entrance was still a good twenty yards behind him, and grouard began



backing up slowly, choosing to leave his gun trained on the man on the floor. as grouard inched
backward, he could see the woman across the room raising her uv light and scrutinizing a large
painting that hung on the far side of the salle des etats, directly opposite the mona lisa.

grouard gasped, realizing which painting it was.

what in the name of god is she doing?



across the room, sophie neveu felt a cold sweat breaking across her forehead. langdon was still
spread-eagle on the floor. hold on, robert. almost there. knowing the guard would never actually
shoot either of them, sophie now turned her attention back to the matter at hand, scanning the
entire area around one masterpiece in particular — another da vinci. but the uv light revealed
nothing out of the ordinary. not on the floor, on the walls, or even on the canvas itself.

there must be something here!

sophie felt totally certain she had deciphered her grandfather's intentions correctly.

what else could he possibly intend?

the masterpiece she was examining was a five-foot-tall canvas. the bizarre scene da vinci had
painted included an awkwardly posed virgin mary sitting with baby jesus, john the baptist, and
the angel uriel on a perilous outcropping of rocks. when sophie was a little girl, no trip to the
mona lisa had been complete without her grandfather dragging her across the room to see this
second painting.

grand-pere, i'm here! but i don 't see it!

behind her, sophie could hear the guard trying to radio again for help.

think!

she pictured the message scrawled on the protective glass of the mona lisa. so dark the con of
man. the painting before her had no protective glass on which to write a message, and sophie
knew her grandfather would never have defaced this masterpiece by writing on the painting itself.
she paused. at least not on the front. her eyes shot upward, climbing the long cables that dangled
from the ceiling to support the canvas.

could that be it? grabbing the left side of the carved wood frame, she pulled it toward her. the
painting was large and the backing flexed as she swung it away from the wall. sophie slipped her
head and shoulders in behind the painting and raised the black light to inspect the back.



it took only seconds to realize her instinct had been wrong. the back of the painting was pale and
blank. there was no purple text here, only the mottled brown backside of aging canvas and —

wait.

sophie's eyes locked on an incongruous glint of lustrous metal lodged near the bottom edge of the
frame's wooden armature. the object was small, partially wedged in the slit where the canvas met
the frame. a shimmering gold chain dangled off it.

to sophie's utter amazement, the chain was affixed to a familiar gold key. the broad, sculpted
head was in the shape of a cross and bore an engraved seal she had not seen since she was nine
years old. a fleur-de-lis with the initials p.s. in that instant, sophie felt the ghost of her grandfather
whispering in her ear. when the time comes, the key will be yours. a tightness gripped her throat as
she realized that her grandfather, even in death, had kept his promise. this key opens a box, his
voice was saying, where i keep many secrets.

sophie now realized that the entire purpose of tonight's word game had been this key. her
grandfather had it with him when he was killed. not wanting it to fall into the hands of the police,
he hid it behind this painting. then he devised an ingenious treasure hunt to ensure only sophie
would find it.

"au secours!" the guard's voice yelled.

sophie snatched the key from behind the painting and slipped it deep in her pocket along with the
uv penlight. peering out from behind the canvas, she could see the guard was still trying
desperately to raise someone on the walkie-talkie. he was backing toward the entrance, still aiming
the gun firmly at langdon.

"au secours!" he shouted again into his radio.

static.

he can 't transmit, sophie realized, recalling that tourists with cell phones often got frustrated in
here when they tried to call home to brag about seeing the mona lisa. the extra surveillance
wiring in the walls made it virtually impossible to get a carrier unless you stepped out into the hall.
the guard was backing quickly toward the exit now, and sophie knew she had to act immediately.

gazing up at the large painting behind which she was partially ensconced, sophie realized that
leonardo da vinci, for the second time tonight, was there to help.



another few meters, grouard told himself, keeping his gun leveled.



"arretez! ouje la detruis!" the woman's voice echoed across the room.

grouard glanced over and stopped in his tracks. "mon dieu, non!"

through the reddish haze, he could see that the woman had actually lifted the large painting off its
cables and propped it on the floor in front of her. at five feet tall, the canvas almost entirely hid her
body. grouard's first thought was to wonder why the painting's trip wires hadn't set off alarms, but
of course the artwork cable sensors had yet to be reset tonight. what is she doing!

when he saw it, his blood went cold.

the canvas started to bulge in the middle, the fragile outlines of the virgin mary, baby jesus, and
john the baptist beginning to distort.

"non!" grouard screamed, frozen in horror as he watched the priceless da vinci stretching. the
woman was pushing her knee into the center of the canvas from behind! "non!"

grouard wheeled and aimed his gun at her but instantly realized it was an empty threat. the canvas
was only fabric, but it was utterly impenetrable — a six-million-dollar piece of body armor.

/ can 't put a bullet through a da vinci!

"set down your gun and radio," the woman said in calm french, "or i'll put my knee through this
painting. i think you know how my grandfather would feel about that."

grouard felt dizzy. "please... no. that's madonna of the rocks!" he dropped his gun and radio,
raising his hands over his head.

"thank you," the woman said. "now do exactly as i tell you, and everything will work out fine."



moments later, langdon's pulse was still thundering as he ran beside sophie down the emergency
stairwell toward the ground level. neither of them had said a word since leaving the trembling
louvre guard lying in the salle des etats. the guard's pistol was now clutched tightly in langdon's
hands, and he couldn't wait to get rid of it. the weapon felt heavy and dangerously foreign.

taking the stairs two at a time, langdon wondered if sophie had any idea how valuable a painting
she had almost ruined. her choice in art seemed eerily pertinent to tonight's adventure. the da
vinci she had grabbed, much like the mona lisa, was notorious among art historians for its
plethora of hidden pagan symbolism.



"you chose a valuable hostage," he said as they ran.

"madonna of the rocks, " she replied. "but i didn't choose it, my grandfather did. he left me a little
something behind the painting."

langdon shot her a startled look. "what!? but how did you know which painting? why madonna
of the rocks?"

"so dark the con of man." she flashed a triumphant smile. "i missed the first two anagrams,
robert. i wasn't about to miss the third."



chapter 31

"they're dead!" sister sandrine stammered into the telephone in her saint-sulpice residence. she
was leaving a message on an answering machine. "please pick up! they're all dead!"

the first three phone numbers on the list had produced terrifying results — a hysterical widow, a
detective working late at a murder scene, and a somber priest consoling a bereaved family. all
three contacts were dead. and now, as she called the fourth and final number — the number she was
not supposed to call unless the first three could not be reached — she got an answering machine.
the outgoing message offered no name but simply asked the caller to leave a message.

"the floor panel has been broken!" she pleaded as she left the message. "the other three are dead!"

sister sandrine did not know the identities of the four men she protected, but the private phone
numbers stashed beneath her bed were for use on only one condition.

if that floor panel is ever broken, the faceless messenger had told her, it means the upper echelon
has been breached. one of us has been mortally threatened and been forced to tell a desperate lie.
call the numbers. warn the others. do not fail us in this.

it was a silent alarm. foolproof in its simplicity. the plan had amazed her when she first heard it. if
the identity of one brother was compromised, he could tell a lie that would start in motion a
mechanism to warn the others. tonight, however, it seemed that more than one had been
compromised.

"please answer," she whispered in fear. "where are you?"

"hang up the phone," a deep voice said from the doorway.

turning in terror, she saw the massive monk. he was clutching the heavy iron candle stand.



shaking, she set the phone back in the cradle.

"they are dead," the monk said. "all four of them. and they have played me for a fool. tell me
where the keystone is."



"i don't know!" sister sandrine said truthfully. "that secret is guarded by others." others who are
dead!

the man advanced, his white fists gripping the iron stand. "you are a sister of the church, and yet
you serve them?"

"jesus had but one true message," sister sandrine said defiantly. "i cannot see that message in
opus dei."

a sudden explosion of rage erupted behind the monk's eyes. he lunged, lashing out with the candle
stand like a club. as sister sandrine fell, her last feeling was an overwhelming sense of
foreboding.

all four are dead.

the precious truth is lost forever.



chapter 32

the security alarm on the west end of the denon wing sent the pigeons in the nearby tuileries
gardens scattering as langdon and sophie dashed out of the bulkhead into the paris night. as they
ran across the plaza to sophie's car, langdon could hear police sirens wailing in the distance.



"that's it there," sophie called, pointing to a red snub-nosed two-seater parked on the plaza.

she's kidding, right? the vehicle was easily the smallest car langdon had ever seen.

"smartcar," she said. "a hundred kilometers to the liter."

langdon had barely thrown himself into the passenger seat before sophie gunned the smartcar up
and over a curb onto a gravel divider. he gripped the dash as the car shot out across a sidewalk and
bounced back down over into the small rotary at carrousel du louvre.

for an instant, sophie seemed to consider taking the shortcut across the rotary by plowing straight
ahead, through the median's perimeter hedge, and bisecting the large circle of grass in the center.



"no!" langdon shouted, knowing the hedges around carrousel du louvre were there to hide the
perilous chasm in the center — la pyramide inversee — the upside-down pyramid skylight he had
seen earlier from inside the museum. it was large enough to swallow their smart-car in a single
gulp. fortunately, sophie decided on the more conventional route, jamming the wheel hard to the
right, circling properly until she exited, cut left, and swung into the northbound lane, accelerating
toward rue de rivoli.

the two-tone police sirens blared louder behind them, and langdon could see the lights now in his
side view mirror. the smartcar engine whined in protest as sophie urged it faster away from the
louvre. fifty yards ahead, the traffic light at rivoli turned red. sophie cursed under her breath and
kept racing toward it. langdon felt his muscles tighten.

"sophie?"

slowing only slightly as they reached the intersection, sophie flicked her headlights and stole a
quick glance both ways before flooring the accelerator again and carving a sharp left turn through
the empty intersection onto rivoli. accelerating west for a quarter of a mile, sophie banked to the
right around a wide rotary. soon they were shooting out the other side onto the wide avenue of
champs-ely sees.

as they straightened out, langdon turned in his seat, craning his neck to look out the rear window
toward the louvre. the police did not seem to be chasing them. the sea of blue lights was
assembling at the museum.

his heartbeat finally slowing, langdon turned back around. "that was interesting."

sophie didn't seem to hear. her eyes remained fixed ahead down the long thoroughfare of champs-
elysees, the two-mile stretch of posh storefronts that was often called the fifth avenue of paris.
the embassy was only about a mile away, and langdon settled into his seat. so dark the con of
man. sophie's quick thinking had been impressive. madonna of the rocks.

sophie had said her grandfather left her something behind the painting. a final message? langdon
could not help but marvel over sauniere's brilliant hiding place; madonna of the rocks was yet
another fitting link in the evening's chain of interconnected symbolism. sauniere, it seemed, at
every turn, was reinforcing his fondness for the dark and mischievous side of leonardo da vinci.

da vinci's original commission for madonna of the rocks had come from an organization known
as the confraternity of the immaculate conception, which needed a painting for the centerpiece of
an altar triptych in their church of san francesco in milan. the nuns gave leonardo specific
dimensions, and the desired theme for the painting — the virgin mary, baby john the baptist, uriel,
and baby jesus sheltering in a cave. although da vinci did as they requested, when he delivered
the work, the group reacted with horror. he had filled the painting with explosive and disturbing
details.



the painting showed a blue-robed virgin mary sitting with her arm around an infant child,
presumably baby jesus. opposite mary sat uriel, also with an infant, presumably baby john the
baptist. oddly, though, rather than the usual jesus-blessing-john scenario, it was baby john who
was blessing jesus... and jesus was submitting to his authority! more troubling still, mary was
holding one hand high above the head of infant john and making a decidedly threatening
gesture — her fingers looking like eagle's talons, gripping an invisible head. finally, the most
obvious and frightening image: just below mary's curled fingers, uriel was making a cutting
gesture with his hand — as if slicing the neck of the invisible head gripped by mary's claw-like
hand.

langdon's students were always amused to learn that da vinci eventually mollified the
confraternity by painting them a second, "watered-down" version of madonna of the rocks in
which everyone was arranged in a more orthodox manner. the second version now hung in
london's national gallery under the name virgin of the rocks, although langdon still preferred
the louvre's more intriguing original.

as sophie gunned the car up champs-elysees, langdon said, "the painting. what was behind it?"

her eyes remained on the road. "i'll show you once we're safely inside the embassy."

"you'll show it to me?" langdon was surprised. "he left you a physical object?"

sophie gave a curt nod. "embossed with a fleur-de-lis and the initials p.s."

langdon couldn't believe his ears.



we're going to make it, sophie thought as she swung the smartcar's wheel to the right, cutting
sharply past the luxurious hotel de crillon into paris's tree-lined diplomatic neighborhood. the
embassy was less than a mile away now. she was finally feeling like she could breathe normally
again.

even as she drove, sophie's mind remained locked on the key in her pocket, her memories of
seeing it many years ago, the gold head shaped as an equal-armed cross, the triangular shaft, the
indentations, the embossed flowery seal, and the letters p.s.

although the key barely had entered sophie's thoughts through the years, her work in the
intelligence community had taught her plenty about security, and now the key's peculiar tooling no
longer looked so mystifying. a laser-tooled varying matrix. impossible to duplicate. rather than
teeth that moved tumblers, this key's complex series of laser-burned pockmarks was examined by
an electric eye. if the eye determined that the hexagonal pockmarks were correctly spaced,



arranged, and rotated, then the lock would open.

sophie could not begin to imagine what a key like this opened, but she sensed robert would be
able to tell her. after all, he had described the key's embossed seal without ever seeing it. the
cruciform on top implied the key belonged to some kind of christian organization, and yet sophie
knew of no churches that used laser-tooled varying matrix keys.

besides, my grandfather was no christian....

sophie had witnessed proof of that ten years ago. ironically, it had been another key — a far more
normal one — that had revealed his true nature to her.

the afternoon had been warm when she landed at charles de gaulle airport and hailed a taxi
home. grand-pere will be so surprised to see me, she thought. returning from graduate school in
britain for spring break a few days early, sophie couldn't wait to see him and tell him all about the
encryption methods she was studying.

when she arrived at their paris home, however, her grandfather was not there. disappointed, she
knew he had not been expecting her and was probably working at the louvre. but it's saturday
afternoon, she realized. he seldom worked on weekends. on weekends, he usually —

grinning, sophie ran out to the garage. sure enough, his car was gone. it was the weekend. jacques
sauniere despised city driving and owned a car for one destination only — his vacation chateau in
normandy, north of paris. sophie, after months in the congestion of london, was eager for the
smells of nature and to start her vacation right away. it was still early evening, and she decided to
leave immediately and surprise him. borrowing a friend's car, sophie drove north, winding into the
deserted moon-swept hills near creully. she arrived just after ten o'clock, turning down the long
private driveway toward her grandfather's retreat. the access road was over a mile long, and she
was halfway down it before she could start to see the house through the trees — a mammoth, old
stone chateau nestled in the woods on the side of a hill.

sophie had half expected to find her grandfather asleep at this hour and was excited to see the
house twinkling with lights. her delight turned to surprise, however, when she arrived to find the
driveway filled with parked cars — mercedeses, bmws, audis, and a rolls-royce.

sophie stared a moment and then burst out laughing. my grand-pere, the famous recluse! jacques
sauniere, it seemed, was far less reclusive than he liked to pretend. clearly he was hosting a party
while sophie was away at school, and from the looks of the automobiles, some of paris's most
influential people were in attendance.

eager to surprise him, she hurried to the front door. when she got there, though, she found it
locked. she knocked. nobody answered. puzzled, she walked around and tried the back door. it too
was locked. no answer.



confused, she stood a moment and listened. the only sound she heard was the cool normandy air
letting out a low moan as it swirled through the valley.

no music.

no voices.

nothing.

in the silence of the woods, sophie hurried to the side of the house and clambered up on a
woodpile, pressing her face to the living room window. what she saw inside made no sense at all.

"nobody's here!"

the entire first floor looked deserted.

where are all the people ?

heart racing, sophie ran to the woodshed and got the spare key her grandfather kept hidden under
the kindling box. she ran to the front door and let herself in. as she stepped into the deserted foyer,
the control panel for the security system started blinking red — a warning that the entrant had ten
seconds to type the proper code before the security alarms went off.

he has the alarm on during a party?

sophie quickly typed the code and deactivated the system.

entering, she found the entire house uninhabited. upstairs too. as she descended again to the
deserted living room, she stood a moment in the silence, wondering what could possibly be
happening.

it was then that sophie heard it.

muffled voices. and they seemed to be coming from underneath her. sophie could not imagine.
crouching, she put her ear to the floor and listened. yes, the sound was definitely coming from
below. the voices seemed to be singing, or... chanting? she was frightened. almost more eerie
than the sound itself was the realization that this house did not even have a basement.

at least none i've ever seen.

turning now and scanning the living room, sophie's eyes fell to the only object in the entire house
that seemed out of place — her grandfather's favorite antique, a sprawling aubusson tapestry. it
usually hung on the east wall beside the fireplace, but tonight it had been pulled aside on its brass



rod, exposing the wall behind it.

walking toward the bare wooden wall, sophie sensed the chanting getting louder. hesitant, she
leaned her ear against the wood. the voices were clearer now. people were definitely chanting...
intoning words sophie could not discern.

the space behind this wall is hollow!

feeling around the edge of the panels, sophie found a recessed fingerhold. it was discreetly
crafted. a sliding door. heart pounding, she placed her finger in the slot and pulled it. with
noiseless precision, the heavy wall slid sideways. from out of the darkness beyond, the voices
echoed up.

sophie slipped through the door and found herself on a rough-hewn stone staircase that spiraled
downward. she'd been coming to this house since she was a child and yet had no idea this staircase
even existed!

as she descended, the air grew cooler. the voices clearer. she heard men and women now. her
line of sight was limited by the spiral of the staircase, but the last step was now rounding into view.
beyond it, she could see a small patch of the basement floor — stone, illuminated by the flickering
orange blaze of firelight.

holding her breath, sophie inched down another few steps and crouched down to look. it took her
several seconds to process what she was seeing.

the room was a grotto — a coarse chamber that appeared to have been hollowed from the granite of
the hillside. the only light came from torches on the walls. in the glow of the flames, thirty or so
people stood in a circle in the center of the room.

i'm dreaming, sophie told herself. a dream. what else could this be?

everyone in the room was wearing a mask. the women were dressed in white gossamer gowns and
golden shoes. their masks were white, and in their hands they carried golden orbs. the men wore
long black tunics, and their masks were black. they looked like pieces in a giant chess set.
everyone in the circle rocked back and forth and chanted in reverence to something on the floor
before them... something sophie could not see.

the chanting grew steady again. accelerating. thundering now. faster. the participants took a
step inward and knelt. in that instant, sophie could finally see what they all were witnessing. even
as she staggered back in horror, she felt the image searing itself into her memory forever.
overtaken by nausea, sophie spun, clutching at the stone walls as she clambered back up the stairs.
pulling the door closed, she fled the deserted house, and drove in a tearful stupor back to paris.



that night, with her life shattered by disillusionment and betrayal, she packed her belongings and
left her home. on the dining room table, she left a note.

i was there. don't try to find me.



beside the note, she laid the old spare key from the chateau's woodshed.



"sophie! langdon's voice intruded. "stop! stop!"

emerging from the memory, sophie slammed on the brakes, skidding to a halt. "what? what
happened? ! "

langdon pointed down the long street before them.

when she saw it, sophie's blood went cold. a hundred yards ahead, the intersection was blocked
by a couple of dcpj police cars, parked askew, their purpose obvious. they've sealed off avenue
gabriel!

langdon gave a grim sigh. "i take it the embassy is off-limits this evening?"

down the street, the two dcpj officers who stood beside their cars were now staring in their
direction, apparently curious about the headlights that had halted so abruptly up the street from
them.

okay, sophie, turn around very slowly.

putting the smartcar in reverse, she performed a composed three-point turn and reversed her
direction. as she drove away, she heard the sound of squealing tires behind them. sirens blared to
life.

cursing, sophie slammed down the accelerator.



chapter 33

sophie's smartcar tore through the diplomatic quarter, weaving past embassies and consulates,
finally racing out a side street and taking a right turn back onto the massive thoroughfare of
champs-elysees.



langdon sat white-knuckled in the passenger seat, twisted backward, scanning behind them for any
signs of the police. he suddenly wished he had not decided to run. you didn't, he reminded himself.
sophie had made the decision for him when she threw the gps dot out the bathroom window.
now, as they sped away from the embassy, serpentining through sparse traffic on champs-elysees,
langdon felt his options deteriorating. although sophie seemed to have lost the police, at least for
the moment, langdon doubted their luck would hold for long.

behind the wheel sophie was fishing in her sweater pocket. she removed a small metal object and
held it out for him. "robert, you'd better have a look at this. this is what my grandfather left me
behind madonna of the rocks. "

feeling a shiver of anticipation, langdon took the object and examined it. it was heavy and shaped
like a cruciform. his first instinct was that he was holding a funeral pieu — a miniature version of a
memorial spike designed to be stuck into the ground at a gravesite. but then he noted the shaft
protruding from the cruciform was prismatic and triangular. the shaft was also pockmarked with
hundreds of tiny hexagons that appeared to be finely tooled and scattered at random.

"it's a laser-cut key," sophie told him. "those hexagons are read by an electric eye."

a key? langdon had never seen anything like it.

"look at the other side," she said, changing lanes and sailing through an intersection.

when langdon turned the key, he felt his jaw drop. there, intricately embossed on the center of
the cross, was a stylized fleur-de-lis with the initials p.s.! "sophie," he said, "this is the seal i told
you about! the official device of the priory of sion."

she nodded. "as i told you, i saw the key a long time ago. he told me never to speak of it again."

langdon's eyes were still riveted on the embossed key. its high-tech tooling and age-old
symbolism exuded an eerie fusion of ancient and modern worlds.

"he told me the key opened a box where he kept many secrets."

langdon felt a chill to imagine what kind of secrets a man like jacques sauniere might keep. what
an ancient brotherhood was doing with a futuristic key, langdon had no idea. the priory existed
for the sole purpose of protecting a secret. a secret of incredible power. could this key have
something to do with it? the thought was overwhelming. "do you know what it opens?"

sophie looked disappointed. "i was hoping you knew."

langdon remained silent as he turned the cruciform in his hand, examining it.



"it looks christian," sophie pressed.

langdon was not so sure about that. the head of this key was not the traditional long-stemmed
christian cross but rather was a square cross — with four arms of equal length — which predated
christianity by fifteen hundred years. this kind of cross carried none of the christian connotations
of crucifixion associated with the longer- stemmed latin cross, originated by romans as a torture
device. langdon was always surprised how few christians who gazed upon "the crucifix" realized
their symbol's violent history was reflected in its very name: "cross" and "crucifix" came from the
latin verb cruciare — to torture.

"sophie," he said, "all i can tell you is that equal-armed crosses like this one are considered
peaceful crosses. their square configurations make them impractical for use in crucifixion, and
their balanced vertical and horizontal elements convey a natural union of male and female, making
them symbolically consistent with priory philosophy. "

she gave him a weary look. "you have no idea, do you?"

langdon frowned. "not a clue."

"okay, we have to get off the road." sophie checked her rearview mirror. "we need a safe place to
figure out what that key opens."

langdon thought longingly of his comfortable room at the ritz. obviously, that was not an option.
"how about my hosts at the american university of paris?"

"too obvious. fache will check with them."

"you must know people. you live here."

"fache will run my phone and e-mail records, talk to my coworkers. my contacts are
compromised, and finding a hotel is no good because they all require identification. "

langdon wondered again if he might have been better off taking his chances letting fache arrest
him at the louvre. "let's call the embassy. i can explain the situation and have the embassy send
someone to meet us somewhere."

"meet us?" sophie turned and stared at him as if he were crazy. "robert, you're dreaming. your
embassy has no jurisdiction except on their own property. sending someone to retrieve us would be
considered aiding a fugitive of the french government. it won't happen. if you walk into your
embassy and request temporary asylum, that's one thing, but asking them to take action against
french law enforcement in the field?" she shook her head. "call your embassy right now, and they
are going to tell you to avoid further damage and turn yourself over to fache. then they'll promise
to pursue diplomatic channels to get you a fair trial. " she gazed up the line of elegant storefronts on



champs-ely sees. "how much cash do you have?"

langdon checked his wallet. "a hundred dollars. a few euro. why?"

"credit cards?"

"of course."

as sophie accelerated, langdon sensed she was formulating a plan. dead ahead, at the end of
champs-elysees, stood the arc de triomphe — napoleon's 164-foot-tall tribute to his own military
potency — encircled by france's largest rotary, a nine-lane behemoth.

sophie's eyes were on the rearview mirror again as they approached the rotary. "we lost them for
the time being," she said, "but we won't last another five minutes if we stay in this car."

so steal a different one, langdon mused, now that we're criminals. "what are you going to do?"

sophie gunned the smartcar into the rotary. "trust me."

langdon made no response. trust had not gotten him very far this evening. pulling back the sleeve
of his jacket, he checked his watch — a vintage, collector's-edition mickey mouse wristwatch that
had been a gift from his parents on his tenth birthday. although its juvenile dial often drew odd
looks, langdon had never owned any other watch; disney animations had been his first
introduction to the magic of form and color, and mickey now served as langdon's daily reminder
to stay young at heart. at the moment, however, mickey's arms were skewed at an awkward angle,
indicating an equally awkward hour.

2:51a.m.

"interesting watch," sophie said, glancing at his wrist and maneuvering the smartcar around the
wide, counterclockwise rotary.

"long story," he said, pulling his sleeve back down.

"i imagine it would have to be." she gave him a quick smile and exited the rotary, heading due
north, away from the city center. barely making two green lights, she reached the third intersection
and took a hard right onto boulevard malesherbes. they'd left the rich, tree-lined streets of the
diplomatic neighborhood and plunged into a darker industrial neighborhood. sophie took a quick
left, and a moment later, langdon realized where they were.

gare saint-lazare.

ahead of them, the glass-roofed train terminal resembled the awkward offspring of an airplane



hangar and a greenhouse. european train stations never slept. even at this hour, a half-dozen taxis
idled near the main entrance. vendors manned carts of sandwiches and mineral water while grungy
kids in backpacks emerged from the station rubbing their eyes, looking around as if trying to
remember what city they were in now. up ahead on the street, a couple of city policemen stood on
the curb giving directions to some confused tourists.

sophie pulled her smartcar in behind the line of taxis and parked in a red zone despite plenty of
legal parking across the street. before langdon could ask what was going on, she was out of the
car. she hurried to the window of the taxi in front of them and began speaking to the driver.

as langdon got out of the smartcar, he saw sophie hand the taxi driver a big wad of cash. the
taxi driver nodded and then, to langdon's bewilderment, sped off without them.

"what happened?" langdon demanded, joining sophie on the curb as the taxi disappeared.

sophie was already heading for the train station entrance. "come on. we're buying two tickets on
the next train out of paris."

langdon hurried along beside her. what had begun as a one-mile dash to the u.s. embassy had
now become a full-fledged evacuation from paris. langdon was liking this idea less and less.



chapter 34

the driver who collected bishop aringarosa from leonardo da vinci international airport pulled
up in a small, unimpressive black fiat sedan. aringarosa recalled a day when all vatican transports
were big luxury cars that sported grille-plate medallions and flags emblazoned with the seal of the
holy see. those days are gone. vatican cars were now less ostentatious and almost always
unmarked. the vatican claimed this was to cut costs to better serve their dioceses, but aringarosa
suspected it was more of a security measure. the world had gone mad, and in many parts of
europe, advertising your love of jesus christ was like painting a bull's-eye on the roof of your car.

bundling his black cassock around himself, aringarosa climbed into the back seat and settled in for
the long drive to castel gandolfo. it would be the same ride he had taken five months ago.

last year's trip to rome, he sighed. the longest night of my life.

five months ago, the vatican had phoned to request aringarosa's immediate presence in rome.
they offered no explanation. your tickets are at the airport. the holy see worked hard to retain a
veil of mystery, even for its highest clergy.

the mysterious summons, aringarosa suspected, was probably a photo opportunity for the pope



and other vatican officials to piggyback on opus dei's recent public success — the completion of
their world headquarters in new york city. architectural digest had called opus dei's building
"a shining beacon of catholicism sublimely integrated with the modern landscape," and lately the
vatican seemed to be drawn to anything and everything that included the word "modern."

aringarosa had no choice but to accept the invitation, albeit reluctantly. not a fan of the current
papal administration, aringarosa, like most conservative clergy, had watched with grave concern
as the new pope settled into his first year in office. an unprecedented liberal, his holiness had
secured the papacy through one of the most controversial and unusual conclaves in vatican history.
now, rather than being humbled by his unexpected rise to power, the holy father had wasted no
time flexing all the muscle associated with the highest office in christendom. drawing on an
unsettling tide of liberal support within the college of cardinals, the pope was now declaring his
papal mission to be "rejuvenation of vatican doctrine and updating catholicism into the third
millennium."

the translation, aringarosa feared, was that the man was actually arrogant enough to think he
could rewrite god's laws and win back the hearts of those who felt the demands of true catholicism
had become too inconvenient in a modern world.

aringarosa had been using all of his political sway — substantial considering the size of the opus
dei constituency and their bankroll — to persuade the pope and his advisers that softening the
church's laws was not only faithless and cowardly, but political suicide. he reminded them that
previous tempering of church law — the vatican ii fiasco — had left a devastating legacy: church
attendance was now lower than ever, donations were drying up, and there were not even enough
catholic priests to preside over their churches.

people need structure and direction from the church, aringarosa insisted, not coddling and
indulgence!

on that night, months ago, as the fiat had left the airport, aringarosa was surprised to find himself
heading not toward vatican city but rather eastward up a sinuous mountain road. "where are we
going?" he had demanded of his driver.

"alban hills," the man replied. "your meeting is at castel gandolfo."

the pope 's summer residence ? aringarosa had never been, nor had he ever desired to see it. in
addition to being the pope's summer vacation home, the sixteenth-century citadel housed the
specula vaticana — the vatican observatory — one of the most advanced astronomical
observatories in europe. aringarosa had never been comfortable with the vatican's historical need
to dabble in science. what was the rationale for fusing science and faith? unbiased science could
not possibly be performed by a man who possessed faith in god. nor did faith have any need for
physical confirmation of its beliefs.



nonetheless, there it is, he thought as castel gandolfo came into view, rising against a star-filled
november sky. from the access road, gandolfo resembled a great stone monster pondering a
suicidal leap. perched at the very edge of a cliff, the castle leaned out over the cradle of italian
civilization — the valley where the curiazi and orazi clans fought long before the founding of
rome.

even in silhouette, gandolfo was a sight to behold — an impressive example of tiered, defensive
architecture, echoing the potency of this dramatic cliffside setting. sadly, aringarosa now saw, the
vatican had ruined the building by constructing two huge aluminum telescope domes atop the roof,
leaving this once dignified edifice looking like a proud warrior wearing a couple of party hats.

when aringarosa got out of the car, a young jesuit priest hurried out and greeted him. "bishop,
welcome. i am father mangano. an astronomer here."

good for you. aringarosa grumbled his hello and followed his host into the castle's foyer — a wide-
open space whose decor was a graceless blend of renaissance art and astronomy images.
following his escort up the wide travertine marble staircase, aringarosa saw signs for conference
centers, science lecture halls, and tourist information services. it amazed him to think the vatican
was failing at every turn to provide coherent, stringent guidelines for spiritual growth and yet
somehow still found time to give astrophysics lectures to tourists.

"tell me," aringarosa said to the young priest, "when did the tail start wagging the dog?"

the priest gave him an odd look. "sir?"

aringarosa waved it off, deciding not to launch into that particular offensive again this evening.
the vatican has gone mad. like a lazy parent who found it easier to acquiesce to the whims of a
spoiled child than to stand firm and teach values, the church just kept softening at every turn,
trying to reinvent itself to accommodate a culture gone astray.

the top floor's corridor was wide, lushly appointed, and led in only one direction — toward a huge
set of oak doors with a brass sign.

biblioteca astronomica

aringarosa had heard of this place — the vatican's astronomy library — rumored to contain more
than twenty-five thousand volumes, including rare works of copernicus, galileo, kepler, newton,
and secchi. allegedly, it was also the place in which the pope's highest officers held private
meetings... those meetings they preferred not to hold within the walls of vatican city.

approaching the door, bishop aringarosa would never have imagined the shocking news he was
about to receive inside, or the deadly chain of events it would put into motion. it was not until an
hour later, as he staggered from the meeting, that the devastating implications settled in. six months



from now! he had thought. god help us!



now, seated in the fiat, bishop aringarosa realized his fists were clenched just thinking about that
first meeting. he released his grip and forced a slow inhalation, relaxing his muscles.

everything will be fine, he told himself as the fiat wound higher into the mountains. still, he
wished his cell phone would ring. why hasn't the teacher called me? silas should have the
keystone by now.

trying to ease his nerves, the bishop meditated on the purple amethyst in his ring. feeling the
textures of the mitre-crozier applique and the facets of the diamonds, he reminded himself that this
ring was a symbol of power far less than that which he would soon attain.



chapter 35

the inside of gare saint-lazare looked like every other train station in europe, a gaping indoor-
outdoor cavern dotted with the usual suspects — homeless men holding cardboard signs, collections
of bleary-eyed college kids sleeping on backpacks and zoning out to their portable mp3 players,
and clusters of blue-clad baggage porters smoking cigarettes.

sophie raised her eyes to the enormous departure board overhead. the black and white tabs
reshuffled, ruffling downward as the information refreshed. when the update was finished,
langdon eyed the offerings. the topmost listing read: lyon — rapide — 3:06

"i wish it left sooner," sophie said, "but lyon will have to do." sooner? langdon checked his
watch 2:59 a.m. the train left in seven minutes and they didn't even have tickets yet.

sophie guided langdon toward the ticket window and said, "buy us two tickets with your credit
card."

"i thought credit card usage could be traced by — "

"exactly."

langdon decided to stop trying to keep ahead of sophie neveu. using his visa card, he purchased
two coach tickets to lyon and handed them to sophie.

sophie guided him out toward the tracks, where a familiar tone chimed overhead and a p.a.
announcer gave the final boarding call for lyon. sixteen separate tracks spread out before them. in



the distance to the right, at quay three, the train to lyon was belching and wheezing in preparation
for departure, but sophie already had her arm through langdon's and was guiding him in the exact
opposite direction. they hurried through a side lobby, past an all-night cafe, and finally out a side
door onto a quiet street on the west side of the station.

a lone taxi sat idling by the doorway.

the driver saw sophie and flicked his lights.

sophie jumped in the back seat. langdon got in after her.

as the taxi pulled away from station, sophie took out their newly purchased train tickets and tore
them up.

langdon sighed. seventy dollars well spent.

it was not until their taxi had settled into a monotonous northbound hum on rue de clichy that
langdon felt they'd actually escaped. out the window to his right, he could see montmartre and the
beautiful dome of sacre-coeur. the image was interrupted by the flash of police lights sailing past
them in the opposite direction.

langdon and sophie ducked down as the sirens faded.

sophie had told the cab driver simply to head out of the city, and from her firmly set jaw, langdon
sensed she was trying to figure out their next move.

langdon examined the cruciform key again, holding it to the window, bringing it close to his eyes
in an effort to find any markings on it that might indicate where the key had been made. in the
intermittent glow of passing streetlights, he saw no markings except the priory seal.

"it doesn't make sense," he finally said.

"which part?"

"that your grandfather would go to so much trouble to give you a key that you wouldn't know
what to do with."

"i agree."

"are you sure he didn't write anything else on the back of the painting?"

"i searched the whole area. this is all there was. this key, wedged behind the painting. i saw the
priory seal, stuck the key in my pocket, then we left."



langdon frowned, peering now at the blunt end of the triangular shaft. nothing. squinting, he
brought the key close to his eyes and examined the rim of the head. nothing there either. "i think
this key was cleaned recently."

"why?"

"it smells like rubbing alcohol."

she turned. "i'm sorry?"

"it smells like somebody polished it with a cleaner." langdon held the key to his nose and sniffed.
"it's stronger on the other side." he flipped it over. "yes, it's alcohol-based, like it's been buffed
with a cleaner or — " langdon stopped.

"what?"

he angled the key to the light and looked at the smooth surface on the broad arm of the cross. it
seemed to shimmer in places... like it was wet. "how well did you look at the back of this key
before you put it in your pocket?"

"what? not well. i was in a hurry."

langdon turned to her. "do you still have the black light?"

sophie reached in her pocket and produced the uv penlight. langdon took it and switched it on,
shining the beam on the back of the key.

the back luminesced instantly. there was writing there. in penmanship that was hurried but
legible.



well," langdon said, smiling. "i guess we know what the alcohol smell was."



sophie stared in amazement at the purple writing on the back of the key.

24 rue haxo

an address! my grandfather wrote down an address!
"where is this?" langdon asked.



sophie had no idea. facing front again, she leaned forward and excitedly asked the driver,
"connaissez-vous la rue haxo?"

the driver thought a moment and then nodded. he told sophie it was out near the tennis stadium
on the western outskirts of paris. she asked him to take them there immediately.

"fastest route is through bois de boulogne," the driver told her in french. "is that okay?"

sophie frowned. she could think of far less scandalous routes, but tonight she was not going to be
picky. "oui." we can shock the visiting american.

sophie looked back at the key and wondered what they would possibly find at 24 rue haxo. a
church? some kind of priory headquarters?

her mind filled again with images of the secret ritual she had witnessed in the basement grotto ten
years ago, and she heaved a long sigh. "robert, i have a lot of things to tell you." she paused,
locking eyes with him as the taxi raced westward. "but first i want you to tell me everything you
know about this priory of sion."



chapter 36

outside the salle des etats, bezu fache was fuming as louvre warden grouard explained how
sophie and langdon had disarmed him. why didn't you just shoot the blessed painting!

"captain?" lieutenant collet loped toward them from the direction of the command post. "captain,
i just heard. they located agent neveu's car."

"did she make the embassy?"

"no. train station. bought two tickets. train just left."

fache waved off warden grouard and led collet to a nearby alcove, addressing him in hushed
tones. "what was the destination?"

"lyon."

"probably a decoy." fache exhaled, formulating a plan. "okay, alert the next station, have the train
stopped and searched, just in case. leave her car where it is and put plainclothes on watch in case
they try to come back to it. send men to search the streets around the station in case they fled on
foot. are buses running from the station?"



"not at this hour, sir. only the taxi queue."

"good. question the drivers. see if they saw anything. then contact the taxi company dispatcher
with descriptions. i'm calling interpol."

collet looked surprised. "you're putting this on the wire?"

fache regretted the potential embarrassment, but he saw no other choice.

close the net fast, and close it tight.

the first hour was critical. fugitives were predictable the first hour after escape. they always
needed the same thing. travel. lodging. cash. the holy trinity. interpol had the power to make
all three disappear in the blink of an eye. by broadcast-faxing photos of langdon and sophie to
paris travel authorities, hotels, and banks, interpol would leave no options — no way to leave the
city, no place to hide, and no way to withdraw cash without being recognized. usually, fugitives
panicked on the street and did something stupid. stole a car. robbed a store. used a bank card in
desperation. whatever mistake they committed, they quickly made their whereabouts known to
local authorities.

"only langdon, right?" collet said. "you're not flagging sophie neveu. she's our own agent."

"of course i'm flagging her!" fache snapped. "what good is flagging langdon if she can do all his
dirty work? i plan to run neveu's employment file — friends, family, personal contacts — anyone she
might turn to for help. i don't know what she thinks she's doing out there, but it's going to cost her
one hell of a lot more than her job!"

"do you want me on the phones or in the field?"

"field. get over to the train station and coordinate the team. you've got the reins, but don't make a
move without talking to me."

"yes, sir." collet ran out.

fache felt rigid as he stood in the alcove. outside the window, the glass pyramid shone, its
reflection rippling in the windswept pools. they slipped through my fingers. he told himself to
relax.

even a trained field agent would be lucky to withstand the pressure that interpol was about to
apply.

a female cryptologist and a schoolteacher?



they wouldn't last till dawn.



chapter 37

the heavily forested park known as the bois de boulogne was called many things, but the parisian
cognoscenti knew it as "the garden of earthly delights." the epithet, despite sounding flattering,
was quite to the contrary. anyone who had seen the lurid bosch painting of the same name
understood the jab; the painting, like the forest, was dark and twisted, a purgatory for freaks and
fetishists. at night, the forest's winding lanes were lined with hundreds of glistening bodies for
hire, earthly delights to satisfy one's deepest unspoken desires — male, female, and everything in
between.

as langdon gathered his thoughts to tell sophie about the priory of sion, their taxi passed through
the wooded entrance to the park and began heading west on the cobblestone crossfare. langdon
was having trouble concentrating as a scattering of the park's nocturnal residents were already
emerging from the shadows and flaunting their wares in the glare of the headlights. ahead, two
topless teenage girls shot smoldering gazes into the taxi. beyond them, a well-oiled black man in a
g-string turned and flexed his buttocks. beside him, a gorgeous blond woman lifted her miniskirt
to reveal that she was not, in fact, a woman.

heaven help me! langdon turned his gaze back inside the cab and took a deep breath.

"tell me about the priory of sion," sophie said.

langdon nodded, unable to imagine a less congruous a backdrop for the legend he was about to
tell. he wondered where to begin. the brotherhood's history spanned more than a millennium... an
astonishing chronicle of secrets, blackmail, betrayal, and even brutal torture at the hands of an
angry pope.

"the priory of sion," he began, "was founded in jerusalem in 1099 by a french king named
godefroi de bouillon, immediately after he had conquered the city."

sophie nodded, her eyes riveted on him.

"king godefroi was allegedly the possessor of a powerful secret — a secret that had been in his
family since the time of christ. fearing his secret might be lost when he died, he founded a secret
brotherhood — the priory of sion — and charged them with protecting his secret by quietly passing it
on from generation to generation. during their years in jerusalem, the priory learned of a stash of
hidden documents buried beneath the ruins of herod's temple, which had been built atop the earlier
ruins of solomon's temple. these documents, they believed, corroborated godefroi's powerful
secret and were so explosive in nature that the church would stop at nothing to get them." sophie



looked uncertain.

"the priory vowed that no matter how long it took, these documents must be recovered from the
rubble beneath the temple and protected forever, so the truth would never die. in order to retrieve
the documents from within the ruins, the priory created a military arm — a group of nine knights
called the order of the poor knights of christ and the temple of solomon." langdon paused.
"more commonly known as the knights templar."

sophie glanced up with a surprised look of recognition. langdon had lectured often enough on the
knights templar to know that almost everyone on earth had heard of them, at least abstractedly.
for academics, the templars' history was a precarious world where fact, lore, and misinformation
had become so intertwined that extracting a pristine truth was almost impossible. nowadays,
langdon hesitated even to mention the knights templar while lecturing because it invariably led to
a barrage of convoluted inquiries into assorted conspiracy theories.

sophie already looked troubled. "you're saying the knights templar were founded by the priory of
sion to retrieve a collection of secret documents? i thought the templars were created to protect
the holy land."

"a common misconception. the idea of protection of pilgrims was the guise under which the
templars ran their mission. their true goal in the holy land was to retrieve the documents from
beneath the ruins of the temple."

"and did they find them?"

langdon grinned. "nobody knows for sure, but the one thing on which all academics agree is this:
the knights discovered something down there in the ruins... something that made them wealthy
and powerful beyond anyone's wildest imagination."

langdon quickly gave sophie the standard academic sketch of the accepted knights templar
history, explaining how the knights were in the holy land during the second crusade and told
king baldwin ii that they were there to protect christian pilgrims on the roadways. although
unpaid and sworn to poverty, the knights told the king they required basic shelter and requested his
permission to take up residence in the stables under the ruins of the temple. king baldwin granted
the soldiers' request, and the knights took up their meager residence inside the devastated shrine.

the odd choice of lodging, langdon explained, had been anything but random. the knights
believed the documents the priory sought were buried deep under the ruins — beneath the holy of
holies, a sacred chamber where god himself was believed to reside. literally, the very center of
the jewish faith. for almost a decade, the nine knights lived in the ruins, excavating in total
secrecy through solid rock.

sophie looked over. "and you said they discovered something?"



"they certainly did," langdon said, explaining how it had taken nine years, but the knights had
finally found what they had been searching for. they took the treasure from the temple and
traveled to europe, where their influence seemed to solidify overnight.

nobody was certain whether the knights had blackmailed the vatican or whether the church
simply tried to buy the knights' silence, but pope innocent ii immediately issued an unprecedented
papal bull that afforded the knights templar limitless power and declared them "a law unto
themselves" — an autonomous army independent of all interference from kings and prelates, both
religious and political.

with their new carte blanche from the vatican, the knights templar expanded at a staggering rate,
both in numbers and political force, amassing vast estates in over a dozen countries. they began
extending credit to bankrupt royals and charging interest in return, thereby establishing modern
banking and broadening their wealth and influence still further.

by the 1300s, the vatican sanction had helped the knights amass so much power that pope
clement v decided that something had to be done. working in concert with france's king philippe
iv, the pope devised an ingeniously planned sting operation to quash the templars and seize their
treasure, thus taking control of the secrets held over the vatican. in a military maneuver worthy of
the cia, pope clement issued secret sealed orders to be opened simultaneously by his soldiers all
across europe on friday, october 13 of 1307.

at dawn on the thirteenth, the documents were unsealed and their appalling contents revealed.
clement's letter claimed that god had visited him in a vision and warned him that the knights
templar were heretics guilty of devil worship, homosexuality, defiling the cross, sodomy, and
other blasphemous behavior. pope clement had been asked by god to cleanse the earth by
rounding up all the knights and torturing them until they confessed their crimes against god.
clement's machiavellian operation came off with clockwork precision. on that day, countless
knights were captured, tortured mercilessly, and finally burned at the stake as heretics. echoes of
the tragedy still resonated in modern culture; to this day, friday the thirteenth was considered
unlucky.

sophie looked confused. "the knights templar were obliterated? i thought fraternities of templars
still exist today?"

"they do, under a variety of names. despite clement's false charges and best efforts to eradicate
them, the knights had powerful allies, and some managed to escape the vatican purges. the
templars' potent treasure trove of documents, which had apparently been their source of power,
was clement's true objective, but it slipped through his fingers. the documents had long since been
entrusted to the templars' shadowy architects, the priory of sion, whose veil of secrecy had kept
them safely out of range of the vatican's onslaught. as the vatican closed in, the priory smuggled
their documents from a paris preceptory by night onto templar ships in la rochelle."



"where did the documents go?"

langdon shrugged. "that mystery's answer is known only to the priory of sion. because the
documents remain the source of constant investigation and speculation even today, they are
believed to have been moved and rehidden several times. current speculation places the documents
somewhere in the united kingdom."

sophie looked uneasy.

"for a thousand years," langdon continued, "legends of this secret have been passed on. the entire
collection of documents, its power, and the secret it reveals have become known by a single
name — sangreal. hundreds of books have been written about it, and few mysteries have caused as
much interest among historians as the sangreal."

"the sangreal? does the word have anything to do with the french word sang or spanish
sangre — meaning 'blood'?"

langdon nodded. blood was the backbone of the sangreal, and yet not in the way sophie probably
imagined. "the legend is complicated, but the important thing to remember is that the priory
guards the proof, and is purportedly awaiting the right moment in history to reveal the truth."

"what truth? what secret could possibly be that powerful?"

langdon took a deep breath and gazed out at the underbelly of paris leering in the shadows.
"sophie, the word sangreal is an ancient word. it has evolved over the years into another term... a
more modern name." he paused. "when i tell you its modern name, you'll realize you already
know a lot about it. in fact, almost everyone on earth has heard the story of the sangreal."

sophie looked skeptical. "i've never heard of it."

"sure you have." langdon smiled. "you're just used to hearing it called by the name 'holy grail.' "



chapter 38

sophie scrutinized langdon in the back of the taxi. he's joking. "the holy grail?"

langdon nodded, his expression serious. "holy grail is the literal meaning of sangreal. the phrase
derives from the french sangraal, which evolved to sangreal, and was eventually split into two
words, san great. "



holy grail. sophie was surprised she had not spotted the linguistic ties immediately. even so,
langdon's claim still made no sense to her. "i thought the holy grail was a cup. you just told me
the sangreal is a collection of documents that reveals some dark secret."

"yes, but the sangreal documents are only half of the holy grail treasure. they are buried with the
grail itself... and reveal its true meaning. the documents gave the knights templar so much power
because the pages revealed the true nature of the grail."

the true nature of the grail? sophie felt even more lost now. the holy grail, she had thought, was
the cup that jesus drank from at the last supper and with which joseph of arimathea later caught
his blood at the crucifixion. "the holy grail is the cup of christ," she said. "how much simpler
could it be?"

"sophie," langdon whispered, leaning toward her now, "according to the priory of sion, the holy
grail is not a cup at all. they claim the grail legend — that of a chalice — is actually an ingeniously
conceived allegory. that is, that the grail story uses the chalice as a metaphor for something else,
something far more powerful." he paused. "something that fits perfectly with everything your
grandfather has been trying to tell us tonight, including all his symbologic references to the sacred
feminine."

still unsure, sophie sensed in langdon's patient smile that he empathized with her confusion, and
yet his eyes remained earnest. "but if the holy grail is not a cup," she asked, "what is it?"

langdon had known this question was coming, and yet he still felt uncertain exactly how to tell
her. if he did not present the answer in the proper historical background, sophie would be left with
a vacant air of bewilderment — the exact expression langdon had seen on his own editor's face a
few months ago after langdon handed him a draft of the manuscript he was working on.

"this manuscript claims what?" his editor had choked, setting down his wineglass and staring
across his half-eaten power lunch. "you can't be serious."

"serious enough to have spent a year researching it."

prominent new york editor jonas faukman tugged nervously at his goatee. faukman no doubt had
heard some wild book ideas in his illustrious career, but this one seemed to have left the man
flabbergasted.

"robert," faukman finally said, "don't get me wrong. i love your work, and we've had a great run
together. but if i agree to publish an idea like this, i'll have people picketing outside my office for
months. besides, it will kill your reputation. you're a harvard historian, for god's sake, not a pop
schlockmeister looking for a quick buck. where could you possibly find enough credible evidence
to support a theory like this?"



with a quiet smile langdon pulled a piece of paper from the pocket of his tweed coat and handed it
to faukman. the page listed a bibliography of over fifty titles — books by well-known historians,
some contemporary, some centuries old — many of them academic bestsellers. all the book titles
suggested the same premise langdon had just proposed. as faukman read down the list, he looked
like a man who had just discovered the earth was actually flat. "i know some of these authors.
they're... real historians!"

langdon grinned. "as you can see, jonas, this is not only my theory. it's been around for a long
time. i'm simply building on it. no book has yet explored the legend of the holy grail from a
symbologic angle. the iconographic evidence i'm finding to support the theory is, well,
staggeringly persuasive."

faukman was still staring at the list. "my god, one of these books was written by sir leigh
teabing — a british royal historian."

"teabing has spent much of his life studying the holy grail. i've met with him. he was actually a
big part of my inspiration. he's a believer, jonas, along with all of the others on that list."

"you're telling me all of these historians actually believe..." faukman swallowed, apparently
unable to say the words.

langdon grinned again. "the holy grail is arguably the most sought-after treasure in human
history. the grail has spawned legends, wars, and lifelong quests. does it make sense that it is
merely a cup? if so, then certainly other relics should generate similar or greater interest — the
crown of thorns, the true cross of the crucifixion, the titulus — and yet, they do not. throughout
history, the holy grail has been the most special." langdon grinned. "now you know why."

faukman was still shaking his head. "but with all these books written about it, why isn't this theory
more widely known?"

"these books can't possibly compete with centuries of established history, especially when that
history is endorsed by the ultimate bestseller of all time."

faukman's eyes went wide. "don't tell me harry potter is actually about the holy grail."

"i was referring to the bible."

faukman cringed. "i knew that."



"laissez-le!" sophie's shouts cut the air inside the taxi. "put it down!"



langdon jumped as sophie leaned forward over the seat and yelled at the taxi driver. langdon
could see the driver was clutching his radio mouthpiece and speaking into it.

sophie turned now and plunged her hand into the pocket of langdon's tweed jacket. before
langdon knew what had happened, she had yanked out the pistol, swung it around, and was
pressing it to the back of the driver's head. the driver instantly dropped his radio, raising his one
free hand overhead.

"sophie!" langdon choked. "what the hell—"

"arretez! " sophie commanded the driver.

trembling, the driver obeyed, stopping the car and putting it in park.

it was then that langdon heard the metallic voice of the taxi company's dispatcher coming from the
dashboard, "...qui s'appette agent sophie neveu..." the radio crackled. "et un americain, robert
langdon..."

langdon's muscles turned rigid. they found us already?

"descendez, " sophie demanded.

the trembling driver kept his arms over his head as he got out of his taxi and took several steps
backward.

sophie had rolled down her window and now aimed the gun outside at the bewildered cabbie.
"robert," she said quietly, "take the wheel. you're driving."

langdon was not about to argue with a woman wielding a gun. he climbed out of the car and
jumped back in behind the wheel. the driver was yelling curses, his arms still raised over his head.

"robert," sophie said from the back seat, "i trust you've seen enough of our magic forest?"

he nodded. plenty.

"good. drive us out of here."

langdon looked down at the car's controls and hesitated. shit. he groped for the stick shift and
clutch. "sophie? maybe you — "

"go!" she yelled.

outside, several hookers were walking over to see what was going on. one woman was placing a



call on her cell phone. langdon depressed the clutch and jostled the stick into what he hoped was
first gear. he touched the accelerator, testing the gas.

langdon popped the clutch. the tires howled as the taxi leapt forward, fishtailing wildly and
sending the gathering crowd diving for cover. the woman with the cell phone leapt into the woods,
only narrowly avoiding being run down.

"doucement!" sophie said, as the car lurched down the road. "what are you doing?"

"i tried to warn you," he shouted over the sound of gnashing gears. "i drive an automatic!"



chapter 39

although the spartan room in the brownstone on rue la bruyere had witnessed a lot of suffering,
silas doubted anything could match the anguish now gripping his pale body. / was deceived.
everything is lost.

silas had been tricked. the brothers had lied, choosing death instead of revealing their true secret.
silas did not have the strength to call the teacher. not only had silas killed the only four people
who knew where the keystone was hidden, he had killed a nun inside saint-sulpice. she was
working against god! she scorned the work of opus dei!

a crime of impulse, the woman's death complicated matters greatly. bishop aringarosa had placed
the phone call that got silas into saint-sulpice; what would the abbe think when he discovered the
nun was dead? although silas had placed her back in her bed, the wound on her head was obvious.
silas had attempted to replace the broken tiles in the floor, but that damage too was obvious. they
would know someone had been there.

silas had planned to hide within opus dei when his task here was complete. bishop aringarosa
will protect me. silas could imagine no more blissful existence than a life of meditation and prayer
deep within the walls of opus dei's headquarters in new york city. he would never again set foot
outside. everything he needed was within that sanctuary. nobody will miss me. unfortunately,
silas knew, a prominent man like bishop aringarosa could not disappear so easily.

/ have endangered the bishop. silas gazed blankly at the floor and pondered taking his own life.
after all, it had been aringarosa who gave silas life in the first place... in that small rectory in
spain, educating him, giving him purpose.

"my friend," aringarosa had told him, "you were born an albino. do not let others shame you for
this. do you not understand how special this makes you? were you not aware that noah himself
was an albino?"



"noah of the ark?" silas had never heard this.

aringarosa was smiling. "indeed, noah of the ark. an albino. like you, he had skin white like an
angel. consider this. noah saved all of life on the planet. you are destined for great things, silas.
the lord has freed you for a reason. you have your calling. the lord needs your help to do his
work."

over time, silas learned to see himself in a new light. / am pure. white. beautiful. like an angel.

at the moment, though, in his room at the residence hall, it was his father's disappointed voice that
whispered to him from the past.

tu es un desastre. un spectre.

kneeling on the wooden floor, silas prayed for forgiveness. then, stripping off his robe, he
reached again for the discipline.



chapter 40

struggling with the gear shift, langdon managed to maneuver the hijacked taxi to the far side of
the bois de boulogne while stalling only twice. unfortunately, the inherent humor in the situation
was overshadowed by the taxi dispatcher repeatedly hailing their cab over the radio.

"voiture cinq-six-trois. oil etes-vous? repondez!"

when langdon reached the exit of the park, he swallowed his machismo and jammed on the
brakes. "you'd better drive."

sophie looked relieved as she jumped behind the wheel. within seconds she had the car humming
smoothly westward along allee de longchamp, leaving the garden of earthly delights behind.

"which way is rue haxo?" langdon asked, watching sophie edge the speedometer over a hundred
kilometers an hour.

sophie's eyes remained focused on the road. "the cab driver said it's adjacent to the roland garros
tennis stadium. i know that area."

langdon pulled the heavy key from his pocket again, feeling the weight in his palm. he sensed it
was an object of enormous consequence. quite possibly the key to his own freedom.



earlier, while telling sophie about the knights templar, langdon had realized that this key, in
addition to having the priory seal embossed on it, possessed a more subtle tie to the priory of sion.
the equal-armed cruciform was symbolic of balance and harmony but also of the knights templar.
everyone had seen the paintings of knights templar wearing white tunics emblazoned with red
equal-armed crosses. granted, the arms of the templar cross were slightly flared at the ends, but
they were still of equal length.

a square cross. just like the one on this key.

langdon felt his imagination starting to run wild as he fantasized about what they might find. the
holy grail. he almost laughed out loud at the absurdity of it. the grail was believed to be
somewhere in england, buried in a hidden chamber beneath one of the many templar churches,
where it had been hidden since at least 1500.

the era of grand master da vinci.

the priory, in order to keep their powerful documents safe, had been forced to move them many
times in the early centuries. historians now suspected as many as six different grail relocations
since its arrival in europe from jerusalem. the last grail "sighting" had been in 1447 when
numerous eyewitnesses described a fire that had broken out and almost engulfed the documents
before they were carried to safety in four huge chests that each required six men to carry. after
that, nobody claimed to see the grail ever again. all that remained were occasional whisperings
that it was hidden in great britain, the land of king arthur and the knights of the round table.

wherever it was, two important facts remained:

leonardo knew where the grail resided during his lifetime.

that hiding place had probably not changed to this day.

for this reason, grail enthusiasts still pored over da vinci's art and diaries in hopes of unearthing a
hidden clue as to the grail's current location. some claimed the mountainous backdrop in madonna
of the rocks matched the topography of a series of cave-ridden hills in scotland. others insisted
that the suspicious placement of disciples in the last supper was some kind of code. still others
claimed that x rays of the mona lisa revealed she originally had been painted wearing a lapis
lazuli pendant of isis — a detail da vinci purportedly later decided to paint over. langdon had
never seen any evidence of the pendant, nor could he imagine how it could possibly reveal the
holy grail, and yet grail aficionados still discussed it ad nauseum on internet bulletin boards and
worldwide- web chat rooms.

everyone loves a conspiracy.

and the conspiracies kept coming. most recently, of course, had been the earthshaking discovery



that da vinci's famed adoration of the magi was hiding a dark secret beneath its layers of paint.
italian art diagnostician maurizio seracini had unveiled the unsettling truth, which the new york
times magazine carried prominently in a story titled "the leonardo cover-up."

seracini had revealed beyond any doubt that while the adoration's gray-green sketched
underdrawing was indeed da vinci's work, the painting itself was not. the truth was that some
anonymous painter had filled in da vinci's sketch like a paint-by-numbers years after da vinci's
death. far more troubling, however, was what lay beneath the impostor's paint. photographs taken
with infrared reflectography and x ray suggested that this rogue painter, while filling in da vinci's
sketched study, had made suspicious departures from the underdrawing... as if to subvert da
vinci's true intention. whatever the true nature of the underdrawing, it had yet to be made public.
even so, embarrassed officials at florence's uffizi gallery immediately banished the painting to a
warehouse across the street. visitors at the gallery's leonardo room now found a misleading and
unapologetic plaque where the adoration once hung.

this work is undergoing

diagnostic tests in preparation

for restoration.



in the bizarre underworld of modern grail seekers, leonardo da vinci remained the quest's great
enigma. his artwork seemed bursting to tell a secret, and yet whatever it was remained hidden,
perhaps beneath a layer of paint, perhaps enciphered in plain view, or perhaps nowhere at all.
maybe da vinci's plethora of tantalizing clues was nothing but an empty promise left behind to
frustrate the curious and bring a smirk to the face of his knowing mona lisa.

"is it possible," sophie asked, drawing langdon back, "that the key you're holding unlocks the
hiding place of the holy grail?"

langdon's laugh sounded forced, even to him. "i really can't imagine. besides, the grail is believed
to be hidden in the united kingdom somewhere, not france." he gave her the quick history.

"but the grail seems the only rational conclusion," she insisted. "we have an extremely secure key,
stamped with the priory of sion seal, delivered to us by a member of the priory of sion — a
brotherhood which, you just told me, are guardians of the holy grail."

langdon knew her contention was logical, and yet intuitively he could not possibly accept it.
rumors existed that the priory had vowed someday to bring the grail back to france to a final
resting place, but certainly no historical evidence existed to suggest that this indeed had happened.
even if the priory had managed to bring the grail back to france, the address 24 rue haxo near a
tennis stadium hardly sounded like a noble final resting place. "sophie, i really don't see how this
key could have anything to do with the grail."



"because the grail is supposed to be in england?"

"not only that. the location of the holy grail is one of the best kept secrets in history. priory
members wait decades proving themselves trustworthy before being elevated to the highest
echelons of the fraternity and learning where the grail is. that secret is protected by an intricate
system of compartmentalized knowledge, and although the priory brotherhood is very large, only
four members at any given time know where the grail is hidden — the grand master and his three
senechaux. the probability of your grandfather being one of those four top people is very slim."

my grandfather was one of them, sophie thought, pressing down on the accelerator. she had an
image stamped in her memory that confirmed her grandfather's status within the brotherhood
beyond any doubt.

"and even if your grandfather were in the upper echelon, he would never be allowed to reveal
anything to anyone outside the brotherhood. it is inconceivable that he would bring you into the
inner circle."

i've already been there, sophie thought, picturing the ritual in the basement. she wondered if this
were the moment to tell langdon what she had witnessed that night in the normandy chateau. for
ten years now, simple shame had kept her from telling a soul. just thinking about it, she shuddered.
sirens howled somewhere in the distance, and she felt a thickening shroud of fatigue settling over
her.

"there!" langdon said, feeling excited to see the huge complex of the roland garros tennis
stadium looming ahead.

sophie snaked her way toward the stadium. after several passes, they located the intersection of
rue haxo and turned onto it, driving in the direction of the lower numbers. the road became more
industrial, lined with businesses.

we need number twenty-four, langdon told himself, realizing he was secretly scanning the horizon
for the spires of a church. don't be ridiculous. a forgotten templar church in this neighborhood?

"there it is," sophie exclaimed, pointing.

langdon's eyes followed to the structure ahead.

what in the world?

the building was modern. a squat citadel with a giant, neon equal-armed cross emblazoned atop
its facade. beneath the cross were the words:

depository bank of zurich



langdon was thankful not to have shared his templar church hopes with sophie. a career hazard
of symbologists was a tendency to extract hidden meaning from situations that had none. in this
case, langdon had entirely forgotten that the peaceful, equal-armed cross had been adopted as the
perfect symbol for the flag of neutral switzerland.

at least the mystery was solved.

sophie and langdon were holding the key to a swiss bank deposit box.



chapter 41

outside castel gandolfo, an updraft of mountain air gushed over the top of the cliff and across the
high bluff, sending a chill through bishop aringarosa as he stepped from the fiat. / should have
worn more than this cassock, he thought, fighting the reflex to shiver. the last thing he needed to
appear tonight was weak or fearful.

the castle was dark save the windows at the very top of the building, which glowed ominously.
the library, aringarosa thought. they are awake and waiting. he ducked his head against the wind
and continued on without so much as a glance toward the observatory domes.

the priest who greeted him at the door looked sleepy. he was the same priest who had greeted
aringarosa five months ago, albeit tonight he did so with much less hospitality. "we were worried
about you, bishop," the priest said, checking his watch and looking more perturbed than worried.

"my apologies. airlines are so unreliable these days."

the priest mumbled something inaudible and then said, "they are waiting upstairs. i will escort
you up."

the library was a vast square room with dark wood from floor to ceiling. on all sides, towering
bookcases burgeoned with volumes. the floor was amber marble with black basalt trim, a
handsome reminder that this building had once been a palace.

"welcome, bishop," a man's voice said from across the room.

aringarosa tried to see who had spoken, but the lights were ridiculously low — much lower than
they had been on his first visit, when everything was ablaze. the night of stark awakening.
tonight, these men sat in the shadows, as if they were somehow ashamed of what was about to
transpire.



aringarosa entered slowly, regally even. he could see the shapes of three men at a long table on
the far side of the room. the silhouette of the man in the middle was immediately
recognizable — the obese secretariat vaticana, overlord of all legal matters within vatican city.
the other two were high-ranking italian cardinals.

aringarosa crossed the library toward them. "my humble apologies for the hour. we're on different
time zones. you must be tired."

"not at all," the secretariat said, his hands folded on his enormous belly. "we are grateful you have
come so far. the least we can do is be awake to meet you. can we offer you some coffee or
refreshments?"

"i'd prefer we don't pretend this is a social visit. i have another plane to catch. shall we get to
business?"

"of course," the secretariat said. "you have acted more quickly than we imagined."

"have i?"

"you still have a month."

"you made your concerns known five months ago," aringarosa said. "why should i wait?"

"indeed. we are very pleased with your expediency."

aringarosa's eyes traveled the length of the long table to a large black briefcase. "is that what i
requested?"

"it is." the secretariat sounded uneasy. "although, i must admit, we are concerned with the
request. it seems quite..."

"dangerous," one of the cardinals finished. "are you certain we cannot wire it to you somewhere?
the sum is exorbitant."

freedom is expensive. "i have no concerns for my own safety. god is with me."

the men actually looked doubtful.

"the funds are exactly as i requested?"

the secretariat nodded. "large-denomination bearer bonds drawn on the vatican bank. negotiable
as cash anywhere in the world."



aringarosa walked to the end of the table and opened the briefcase. inside were two thick stacks of
bonds, each embossed with the vatican seal and the title portatore, making the bonds
redeemable to whoever was holding them.

the secretariat looked tense. "i must say, bishop, all of us would feel less apprehensive if these
funds were in cash. "

i could not lift that much cash, aringarosa thought, closing the case. "bonds are negotiable as cash.
you said so yourself. "

the cardinals exchanged uneasy looks, and finally one said, "yes, but these bonds are traceable
directly to the vatican bank."

aringarosa smiled inwardly. that was precisely the reason the teacher suggested aringarosa get
the money in vatican bank bonds. it served as insurance. we are all in this together now. "this is
a perfectly legal transaction," aringarosa defended. "opus dei is a personal prelature of vatican
city, and his holiness can disperse monies however he sees fit. no law has been broken here."

"true, and yet..." the secretariat leaned forward and his chair creaked under the burden. "we have
no knowledge of what you intend to do with these funds, and if it is in any way illegal..."

"considering what you are asking of me," aringarosa countered, "what i do with this money is not
your concern. "

there was a long silence.

they know i'm right, aringarosa thought. "now, i imagine you have something for me to sign?"

they all jumped, eagerly pushing the paper toward him, as if they wished he would simply leave.

aringarosa eyed the sheet before him. it bore the papal seal. "this is identical to the copy you sent
me?"

"exactly."

aringarosa was surprised how little emotion he felt as he signed the document. the three men
present, however, seemed to sigh in relief.

"thank you, bishop," the secretariat said. "your service to the church will never be forgotten."

aringarosa picked up the briefcase, sensing promise and authority in its weight. the four men
looked at one another for a moment as if there were something more to say, but apparently there
was not. aringarosa turned and headed for the door.



"bishop?" one of the cardinals called out as aringarosa reached the threshold.

aringarosa paused, turning. "yes?"

"where will you go from here?"

aringarosa sensed the query was more spiritual than geographical, and yet he had no intention of
discussing morality at this hour. "paris," he said, and walked out the door.



chapter 42

the depository bank of zurich was a twenty-four-hour geldschrank bank offering the full modern
array of anonymous services in the tradition of the swiss numbered account. maintaining offices in
zurich, kuala lumpur, new york, and paris, the bank had expanded its services in recent years to
offer anonymous computer source code escrow services and faceless digitized backup.

the bread and butter of its operation was by far its oldest and simplest offering — the anonyme
lager — blind drop services, otherwise known as anonymous safe-deposit boxes. clients wishing to
store anything from stock certificates to valuable paintings could deposit their belongings
anonymously, through a series of high-tech veils of privacy, withdrawing items at any time, also in
total anonymity.

as sophie pulled the taxi to a stop in front of their destination, langdon gazed out at the building's
uncompromising architecture and sensed the depository bank of zurich was a firm with little sense
of humor. the building was a windowless rectangle that seemed to be forged entirely of dull steel.
resembling an enormous metal brick, the edifice sat back from the road with a fifteen-foot-tall,
neon, equilateral cross glowing over its facade.

switzerland's reputation for secrecy in banking had become one of the country's most lucrative
exports. facilities like this had become controversial in the art community because they provided a
perfect place for art thieves to hide stolen goods, for years if necessary, until the heat was off.
because deposits were protected from police inspection by privacy laws and were attached to
numbered accounts rather than people's names, thieves could rest easily knowing their stolen goods
were safe and could never be traced to them.

sophie stopped the taxi at an imposing gate that blocked the bank's driveway — a cement-lined
ramp that descended beneath the building. a video camera overhead was aimed directly at them,
and langdon had the feeling that this camera, unlike those at the louvre, was authentic.

sophie rolled down the window and surveyed the electronic podium on the driver's side. an lcd



screen provided directions in seven languages. topping the list was english.

insert key.

sophie took the gold laser-pocked key from her pocket and turned her attention back to the
podium. below the screen was a triangular hole.

"something tells me it will fit," langdon said.

sophie aligned the key's triangular shaft with the hole and inserted it, sliding it in until the entire
shaft had disappeared. this key apparently required no turning. instantly, the gate began to swing
open. sophie took her foot off the brake and coasted down to a second gate and podium. behind
her, the first gate closed, trapping them like a ship in a lock.

langdon disliked the constricted sensation. let's hope this second gate works too.

this second podium bore familiar directions.

insert key.



when sophie inserted the key, the second gate immediately opened. moments later they were
winding down the ramp into the belly of the structure.

the private garage was small and dim, with spaces for about a dozen cars. at the far end, langdon
spied the building's main entrance. a red carpet stretched across the cement floor, welcoming
visitors to a huge door that appeared to be forged of solid metal.

talk about mixed messages, langdon thought. welcome and keep out.

sophie pulled the taxi into a parking space near the entrance and killed the engine. "you'd better
leave the gun here."

with pleasure, langdon thought, sliding the pistol under the seat.

sophie and langdon got out and walked up the red carpet toward the slab of steel. the door had no
handle, but on the wall beside it was another triangular keyhole. no directions were posted this
time.

"keeps out the slow learners," langdon said.

sophie laughed, looking nervous. "here we go." she stuck the key in the hole, and the door swung



inward with a low hum. exchanging glances, sophie and langdon entered. the door shut with a
thud behind them.

the foyer of the depository bank of zurich employed as imposing a decor as any langdon had
ever seen. where most banks were content with the usual polished marble and granite, this one had
opted for wall-to-wall metal and rivets.

who's their decorator? langdon wondered. allied steel?

sophie looked equally intimidated as her eyes scanned the lobby.

the gray metal was everywhere — the floor, walls, counters, doors, even the lobby chairs appeared
to be fashioned of molded iron. nonetheless, the effect was impressive. the message was clear:
you are walking into a vault.

a large man behind the counter glanced up as they entered. he turned off the small television he
was watching and greeted them with a pleasant smile. despite his enormous muscles and visible
sidearm, his diction chimed with the polished courtesy of a swiss bellhop.

"bonsoir, " he said. "how may i help you?"

the dual-language greeting was the newest hospitality trick of the european host. it presumed
nothing and opened the door for the guest to reply in whichever language was more comfortable.

sophie replied with neither. she simply laid the gold key on the counter in front of the man.

the man glanced down and immediately stood straighter. "of course. your elevator is at the end of
the hall. i will alert someone that you are on your way."

sophie nodded and took her key back. "which floor?"

the man gave her an odd look. "your key instructs the elevator which floor."

she smiled. "ah, yes."



the guard watched as the two newcomers made their way to the elevators, inserted their key,
boarded the lift, and disappeared. as soon as the door had closed, he grabbed the phone. he was
not calling to alert anyone of their arrival; there was no need for that. a vault greeter already had
been alerted automatically when the client's key was inserted outside in the entry gate.

instead, the guard was calling the bank's night manager. as the line rang, the guard switched the



television back on and stared at it. the news story he had been watching was just ending. it didn't
matter. he got another look at the two faces on the television.

the manager answered. "oui?"

"we have a situation down here."

"what's happening?" the manager demanded.

"the french police are tracking two fugitives tonight."

"so?"

"both of them just walked into our bank."

the manager cursed quietly. "okay. i'll contact monsieur vernet immediately."

the guard then hung up and placed a second call. this one to interpol.



langdon was surprised to feel the elevator dropping rather than climbing. he had no idea how
many floors they had descended beneath the depository bank of zurich before the door finally
opened. he didn't care. he was happy to be out of the elevator.

displaying impressive alacrity, a host was already standing there to greet them. he was elderly and
pleasant, wearing a neatly pressed flannel suit that made him look oddly out of place — an old-
world banker in a high-tech world.

"bonsoir, " the man said. "good evening. would you be so kind as to follow me, s'il vous plait?"
without waiting for a response, he spun on his heel and strode briskly down a narrow metal
corridor.

langdon walked with sophie down a series of corridors, past several large rooms filled with
blinking mainframe computers.

"void, " their host said, arriving at a steel door and opening it for them. "here you are."

langdon and sophie stepped into another world. the small room before them looked like a lavish
sitting room at a fine hotel. gone were the metal and rivets, replaced with oriental carpets, dark oak
furniture, and cushioned chairs. on the broad desk in the middle of the room, two crystal glasses
sat beside an opened bottle of perrier, its bubbles still fizzing. a pewter pot of coffee steamed
beside it.



clockwork, langdon thought. leave it to the swiss.

the man gave a perceptive smile. "i sense this is your first visit to us?"

sophie hesitated and then nodded.

"understood. keys are often passed on as inheritance, and our first-time users are invariably
uncertain of the protocol." he motioned to the table of drinks. "this room is yours as long as you
care to use it."

"you say keys are sometimes inherited?" sophie asked.

"indeed. your key is like a swiss numbered account, which are often willed through generations.
on our gold accounts, the shortest safety-deposit box lease is fifty years. paid in advance. so we
see plenty of family turnover. "

langdon stared. "did you say fifty years?"

"at a minimum," their host replied. "of course, you can purchase much longer leases, but barring
further arrangements, if there is no activity on an account for fifty years, the contents of that safe-
deposit box are automatically destroyed. shall i run through the process of accessing your box?"

sophie nodded. "please."

their host swept an arm across the luxurious salon. "this is your private viewing room. once i
leave the room, you may spend all the time you need in here to review and modify the contents of
your safe-deposit box, which arrives... over here." he walked them to the far wall where a wide
conveyor belt entered the room in a graceful curve, vaguely resembling a baggage claim carousel.
"you insert your key in that slot there...." the man pointed to a large electronic podium facing the
conveyor belt. the podium had a familiar triangular hole. "once the computer confirms the
markings on your key, you enter your account number, and your safe-deposit box will be retrieved
robotically from the vault below for your inspection. when you are finished with your box, you
place it back on the conveyor belt, insert your key again, and the process is reversed. because
everything is automated, your privacy is guaranteed, even from the staff of this bank. if you need
anything at all, simply press the call button on the table in the center of the room."

sophie was about to ask a question when a telephone rang. the man looked puzzled and
embarrassed. "excuse me, please." he walked over to the phone, which was sitting on the table
beside the coffee and perrier.



"oui?" he answered.

his brow furrowed as he listened to the caller. "oui... oui... d' accord. " he hung up, and gave them



an uneasy smile. "i'm sorry, i must leave you now. make yourselves at home." he moved quickly
toward the door.

"excuse me," sophie called. "could you clarify something before you go? you mentioned that we
enter an account number?"

the man paused at the door, looking pale. "but of course. like most swiss banks, our safe-deposit
boxes are attached to a number, not a name. you have a key and a personal account number known
only to you. your key is only half of your identification. your personal account number is the other
half. otherwise, if you lost your key, anyone could use it."

sophie hesitated. "and if my benefactor gave me no account number?"

the banker's heart pounded. then you obviously have no business here! he gave them a calm
smile. "i will ask someone to help you. he will be in shortly."

leaving, the banker closed the door behind him and twisted a heavy lock, sealing them inside.



across town, collet was standing in the gare du nord train terminal when his phone rang.

it was fache. "interpol got a tip," he said. "forget the train. langdon and neveu just walked into
the paris branch of the depository bank of zurich. i want your men over there right away."

"any leads yet on what sauniere was trying to tell agent neveu and robert langdon?"

fache's tone was cold. "if you arrest them, lieutenant collet, then i can ask them personally."

collet took the hint. "twenty-four rue haxo. right away, captain." he hung up and radioed his
men.



chapter 43

andre vernet — president of the paris branch of the depository bank of zurich — lived in a lavish
flat above the bank. despite his plush accommodations, he had always dreamed of owning a
riverside apartment on l'lle saint-louis, where he could rub shoulders with the true cognoscenti,
rather than here, where he simply met the filthy rich.

when i retire, vernet told himself, / will fill my cellar with rare bordeaux, adorn my salon with a



fragonard and perhaps a boucher, and spend my days hunting for antique furniture and rare
books in the quartier latin.

tonight, vernet had been awake only six and a half minutes. even so, as he hurried through the
bank's underground corridor, he looked as if his personal tailor and hairdresser had polished him to
a fine sheen. impeccably dressed in a silk suit, vernet sprayed some breath spray in his mouth and
tightened his tie as he walked. no stranger to being awoken to attend to his international clients
arriving from different time zones, vernet modeled his sleep habits after the maasai warriors — the
african tribe famous for their ability to rise from the deepest sleep to a state of total battle
readiness in a matter of seconds.

battle ready, vernet thought, fearing the comparison might be uncharacteristically apt tonight. the
arrival of a gold key client always required an extra flurry of attention, but the arrival of a gold key
client who was wanted by the judicial police would be an extremely delicate matter. the bank had
enough battles with law enforcement over the privacy rights of their clients without proof that
some of them were criminals.

five minutes, vernet told himself. / need these people out of my bank before the police arrive.

if he moved quickly, this impending disaster could be deftly sidestepped. vernet could tell the
police that the fugitives in question had indeed walked into his bank as reported, but because they
were not clients and had no account number, they were turned away. he wished the damned
watchman had not called interpol. discretion was apparently not part of the vocabulary of a 15-
euro-per-hour watchman.

stopping at the doorway, he took a deep breath and loosened his muscles. then, forcing a balmy
smile, he unlocked the door and swirled into the room like a warm breeze.

"good evening," he said, his eyes finding his clients. "i am andre vernet. how can i be of serv — "
the rest of the sentence lodged somewhere beneath his adam's apple. the woman before him was
as unexpected a visitor as vernet had ever had.



"i'm sorry, do we know each other?" sophie asked. she did not recognize the banker, but he for a
moment looked as if he'd seen a ghost.

"no...," the bank president fumbled. "i don't... believe so. our services are anonymous." he
exhaled and forced a calm smile. "my assistant tells me you have a gold key but no account
number? might i ask how you came by this key?"

"my grandfather gave it to me," sophie replied, watching the man closely. his uneasiness seemed
more evident now.



"really? your grandfather gave you the key but failed to give you the account number?"

"i don't think he had time," sophie said. "he was murdered tonight."

her words sent the man staggering backward. "jacques sauniere is dead?" he demanded, his eyes
filling with horror. "but... how?!"

now it was sophie who reeled, numb with shock. "you knew my grandfather?"

banker andre vernet looked equally astounded, steadying himself by leaning on an end table.
"jacques and i were dear friends. when did this happen?"

"earlier this evening. inside the louvre."

vernet walked to a deep leather chair and sank into it. "i need to ask you both a very important
question." he glanced up at langdon and then back to sophie. "did either of you have anything to
do with his death?"

"no!" sophie declared. "absolutely not."

vernet's face was grim, and he paused, pondering. "your pictures are being circulated by interpol.
this is how i recognized you. you're wanted for a murder."

sophie slumped. fache ran an interpol broadcast already? it seemed the captain was more
motivated than sophie had anticipated. she quickly told vernet who langdon was and what had
happened inside the louvre tonight.

vernet looked amazed. "and as your grandfather was dying, he left you a message telling you to
find mr. langdon?"

"yes. and this key." sophie laid the gold key on the coffee table in front of vernet, placing the
priory seal face down.

vernet glanced at the key but made no move to touch it. "he left you only this key? nothing else?
no slip of paper?"

sophie knew she had been in a hurry inside the louvre, but she was certain she had seen nothing
else behind madonna of the rocks. "no. just the key."

vernet gave a helpless sigh. "i'm afraid every key is electronically paired with a ten-digit account
number that functions as a password. without that number, your key is worthless."

ten digits. sophie reluctantly calculated the cryptographic odds. over ten billion possible choices.



even if she could bring in dcpj's most powerful parallel processing computers, she still would
need weeks to break the code. "certainly, monsieur, considering the circumstances, you can help
us."

"i'm sorry. i truly can do nothing. clients select their own account numbers via a secure terminal,
meaning account numbers are known only to the client and computer. this is one way we ensure
anonymity. and the safety of our employees."

sophie understood. convenience stores did the same thing. employees do not have keys
to the safe. this bank obviously did not want to risk someone stealing a key and then holding
an employee hostage for the account number.

sophie sat down beside langdon, glanced down at the key and then up at vernet. "do you have
any idea what my grandfather is storing in your bank?"

"none whatsoever. that is the definition of a geldschrank bank."

"monsieur vernet," she pressed, "our time tonight is short. i am going to be very direct if i may."
she reached out to the gold key and flipped it over, watching the man's eyes as she revealed the
priory of sion seal. "does the symbol on this key mean anything to you?"

vernet glanced down at the fleur-de-lis seal and made no reaction. "no, but many of our clients
emboss corporate logos or initials onto their keys."

sophie sighed, still watching him carefully. "this seal is the symbol of a secret society known as
the priory of sion."

vernet again showed no reaction. "i know nothing of this. your grandfather was a friend, but we
spoke mostly of business." the man adjusted his tie, looking nervous now.

"monsieur vernet," sophie pressed, her tone firm. "my grandfather called me tonight and told me
he and i were in grave danger. he said he had to give me something. he gave me a key to your
bank. now he is dead. anything you can tell us would be helpful."

vernet broke a sweat. "we need to get out of the building. i'm afraid the police will arrive shortly.
my watchman felt obliged to call interpol."

sophie had feared as much. she took one last shot. "my grandfather said he needed to tell me the
truth about my family. does that mean anything to you?"

"mademoiselle, your family died in a car accident when you were young. i'm sorry. i know your
grandfather loved you very much. he mentioned to me several times how much it pained him that
you two had fallen out of touch."



sophie was uncertain how to respond.

langdon asked, "do the contents of this account have anything to do with the sangreal?"

vernet gave him an odd look. "i have no idea what that is." just then, vernet's cell phone rang, and
he snatched it off his belt. "oui?" he listened a moment, his expression one of surprise and
growing concern. "la police? si rapidement?" he cursed, gave some quick directions in french,
and said he would be up to the lobby in a minute.

hanging up the phone, he turned back to sophie. "the police have responded far more quickly than
usual. they are arriving as we speak."

sophie had no intention of leaving empty-handed. "tell them we came and went already. if they
want to search the bank, demand a search warrant. that will take them time."

"listen," vernet said, "jacques was a friend, and my bank does not need this kind of press, so for
those two reasons, i have no intention of allowing this arrest to be made on my premises. give me
a minute and i will see what i can do to help you leave the bank undetected. beyond that, i cannot
get involved." he stood up and hurried for the door. "stay here. i'll make arrangements and be right
back."

"but the safe-deposit box," sophie declared. "we can't just leave."

"there's nothing i can do," vernet said, hurrying out the door. "i'm sorry."

sophie stared after him a moment, wondering if maybe the account number was buried in one of
the countless letters and packages her grandfather had sent her over the years and which she had
left unopened.

langdon stood suddenly, and sophie sensed an unexpected glimmer of contentment in his eyes.

"robert? you're smiling."

"your grandfather was a genius."

"i'm sorry?"

"ten digits?"

sophie had no idea what he was talking about.

"the account number," he said, a familiar lopsided grin now craning his face. "i'm pretty sure he



left it for us after all. "

"where?"

langdon produced the printout of the crime scene photo and spread it out on the coffee table.
sophie needed only to read the first line to know langdon was correct.

13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5

o, draconian devil !

oh, lame saint!

p.s. find robert langdon



chapter 44

"ten digits," sophie said, her cryptologic senses tingling as she studied the printout.

13-3-2-21-1-1-8-5

grand-pere wrote his account number on the louvre floor!

when sophie had first seen the scrambled fibonacci sequence on the parquet, she had assumed its
sole purpose was to encourage dcpj to call in their cryptographers and get sophie involved. later,
she realized the numbers were also a clue as to how to decipher the other lines — a sequence out of
order... a numeric anagram. now, utterly amazed, she saw the numbers had a more important
meaning still. they were almost certainly the final key to opening her grandfather's mysterious safe-
deposit box.

"he was the master of double-entendres," sophie said, turning to langdon. "he loved anything
with multiple layers of meaning. codes within codes."

langdon was already moving toward the electronic podium near the conveyor belt. sophie grabbed
the computer printout and followed.

the podium had a keypad similar to that of a bank atm terminal. the screen displayed the bank's
cruciform logo. beside the keypad was a triangular hole. sophie wasted no time inserting the shaft
of her key into the hole.

the screen refreshed instantly.

account number:



the cursor blinked. waiting.

ten digits. sophie read the numbers off the printout, and langdon typed them in.

account number: 1332211185



when he had typed the last digit, the screen refreshed again. a message in several languages
appeared. english was on top.

caution:

before you strike the enter key, please check the accuracy of your

account number.

for your own security, if the computer does not recognize your
account number, this system will automatically shut down.



"fonction terminer, " sophie said, frowning. "looks like we only get one try." standard atm
machines allowed users three attempts to type a pin before confiscating their bank card. this was
obviously no ordinary cash machine.

"the number looks right," langdon confirmed, carefully checking what they had typed and
comparing it to the printout. he motioned to the enter key. "fire away."

sophie extended her index finger toward the keypad, but hesitated, an odd thought now hitting her.

"go ahead," langdon urged. "vernet will be back soon."

"no." she pulled her hand away. "this isn't the right account number."

"of course it is! ten digits. what else would it be?"

"it's too random."

too random? langdon could not have disagreed more. every bank advised its customers to choose
pins at random so nobody could guess them. certainly clients here would be advised to choose
their account numbers at random.



sophie deleted everything she had just typed in and looked up at langdon, her gaze self-assured.
"it's far too coincidental that this supposedly random account number could be rearranged to form
the fibonacci sequence. "

langdon realized she had a point. earlier, sophie had rearranged this account number into the
fibonacci sequence. what were the odds of being able to do that?

sophie was at the keypad again, entering a different number, as if from memory. "moreover, with
my grandfather's love of symbolism and codes, it seems to follow that he would have chosen an
account number that had meaning to him, something he could easily remember." she finished
typing the entry and gave a sly smile. "something that appeared random... but was not. " langdon
looked at the screen.

account number: 1123581321



it took him an instant, but when langdon spotted it, he knew she was right.

the fibonacci sequence.

1-1-2-3-5-8-13-21

when the fibonacci sequence was melded into a single ten-digit number, it became virtually
unrecognizable. easy to remember, and yet seemingly random. a brilliant ten-digit code that
sauniere would never forget. furthermore, it perfectly explained why the scrambled numbers on
the louvre floor could be rearranged to form the famous progression.

sophie reached down and pressed the enter key.

nothing happened.

at least nothing they could detect.



at that moment, beneath them, in the bank's cavernous subterranean vault, a robotic claw sprang to
life. sliding on a double-axis transport system attached to the ceiling, the claw headed off in search
of the proper coordinates. on the cement floor below, hundreds of identical plastic crates lay
aligned on an enormous grid... like rows of small coffins in an underground crypt.

whirring to a stop over the correct spot on the floor, the claw dropped down, an electric eye
confirming the bar code on the box. then, with computer precision, the claw grasped the heavy
handle and hoisted the crate vertically. new gears engaged, and the claw transported the box to the



far side of the vault, coming to a stop over a stationary conveyor belt.
gently now, the retrieval arm set down the crate and retracted.
once the arm was clear, the conveyor belt whirred to life....



upstairs, sophie and langdon exhaled in relief to see the conveyor belt move. standing beside the
belt, they felt like weary travelers at baggage claim awaiting a mysterious piece of luggage whose
contents were unknown.

the conveyor belt entered the room on their right through a narrow slit beneath a retractable door.
the metal door slid up, and a huge plastic box appeared, emerging from the depths on the inclined
conveyor belt. the box was black, heavy molded plastic, and far larger than she imagined. it
looked like an air-freight pet transport crate without any airholes.

the box coasted to a stop directly in front of them.

langdon and sophie stood there, silent, staring at the mysterious container.

like everything else about this bank, this crate was industrial — metal clasps, a bar code sticker on
top, and molded heavy-duty handle. sophie thought it looked like a giant toolbox.

wasting no time, sophie unhooked the two buckles facing her. then she glanced over at langdon.
together, they raised the heavy lid and let it fall back.

stepping forward, they peered down into the crate.

at first glance, sophie thought the crate was empty. then she saw something. sitting at the bottom
of the crate. a lone item.

the polished wooden box was about the size of a shoebox and had ornate hinges. the wood was a
lustrous deep purple with a strong grain. rosewood, sophie realized. her grandfather's favorite.
the lid bore a beautiful inlaid design of a rose. she and langdon exchanged puzzled looks. sophie
leaned in and grabbed the box, lifting it out.

my god, it's heavy!

she carried it gingerly to a large receiving table and set it down. langdon stood beside her, both of
them staring at the small treasure chest her grandfather apparently had sent them to retrieve.

langdon stared in wonderment at the lid's hand-carved inlay — a five-petal rose. he had seen this



type of rose many times. "the five-petal rose," he whispered, "is a priory symbol for the holy
grail."

sophie turned and looked at him. langdon could see what she was thinking, and he was thinking it
too. the dimensions of the box, the apparent weight of its contents, and a priory symbol for the
grail all seemed to imply one unfathomable conclusion. the cup of christ is in this wooden box.
langdon again told himself it was impossible.

"it's a perfect size," sophie whispered, "to hold... a chalice."

it can 't be a chalice.

sophie pulled the box toward her across the table, preparing to open it. as she moved it, though,
something unexpected happened. the box let out an odd gurgling sound.

langdon did a double take. there's liquid inside?

sophie looked equally confused. "did you just hear...?"

langdon nodded, lost. "liquid."

reaching forward, sophie slowly unhooked the clasp and raised the lid.

the object inside was unlike anything langdon had ever seen. one thing was immediately clear to
both of them, however. this was definitely not the cup of christ.



chapter 45

"the police are blocking the street," andre vernet said, walking into the waiting room. "getting
you out will be difficult." as he closed the door behind him, vernet saw the heavy-duty plastic
case on the conveyor belt and halted in his tracks. my god! they accessed sauniere's account?

sophie and langdon were at the table, huddling over what looked to be a large wooden jewelry
box. sophie immediately closed the lid and looked up. "we had the account number after all," she
said.

vernet was speechless. this changed everything. he respectfully diverted his eyes from the box
and tried to figure out his next move. / have to get them out of the bank! but with the police already
having set up a roadblock, vernet could imagine only one way to do that. "mademoiselle neveu, if
i can get you safely out of the bank, will you be taking the item with you or returning it to the vault
before you leave?"



sophie glanced at langdon and then back to vernet. "we need to take it."

vernet nodded. "very well. then whatever the item is, i suggest you wrap it in your jacket as we
move through the hallways. i would prefer nobody else see it."

as langdon shed his jacket, vernet hurried over to the conveyor belt, closed the now empty crate,
and typed a series of simple commands. the conveyor belt began moving again, carrying the
plastic container back down to the vault. pulling the gold key from the podium, he handed it to
sophie.

"this way please. hurry."

when they reached the rear loading dock, vernet could see the flash of police lights filtering
through the underground garage. he frowned. they were probably blocking the ramp. am i really
going to try to pull this off? he was sweating now.

vernet motioned to one of the bank's small armored trucks. transport siir was another service
offered by the depository bank of zurich.

"get in the cargo hold," he said, heaving open the massive rear door and motioning to the
glistening steel compartment. "i'll be right back."

as sophie and langdon climbed in, vernet hurried across the loading dock to the dock overseer's
office, let himself in, collected the keys for the truck, and found a driver's uniform jacket and cap.
shedding his own suit coat and tie, he began to put on the driver's jacket. reconsidering, he donned
a shoulder holster beneath the uniform. on his way out, he grabbed a driver's pistol from the rack,
put in a clip, and stuffed it in the holster, buttoning his uniform over it. returning to the truck,
vernet pulled the driver's cap down low and peered in at sophie and langdon, who were standing
inside the empty steel box.

"you'll want this on," vernet said, reaching inside and flicking a wall switch to illuminate the lone
courtesy bulb on the hold's ceiling. "and you'd better sit down. not a sound on our way out the
gate."

sophie and langdon sat down on the metal floor. langdon cradled the treasure wadded in his
tweed jacket. swinging the heavy doors closed, vernet locked them inside. then he got in behind
the wheel and revved the engine.

as the armored truck lumbered toward the top of the ramp, vernet could feel the sweat already
collecting beneath his driver's cap. he could see there were far more police lights in front than he
had imagined. as the truck powered up the ramp, the interior gate swung inward to let him pass.
vernet advanced and waited while the gate behind him closed before pulling forward and tripping



the next sensor. the second gate opened, and the exit beckoned.

except for the police car blocking the top of the ramp.

vernet dabbed his brow and pulled forward.

a lanky officer stepped out and waved him to a stop a few meters from the roadblock. four patrol
cars were parked out front.

vernet stopped. pulling his driver's cap down farther, he effected as rough a facade as his cultured
upbringing would allow. not budging from behind the wheel, he opened the door and gazed down
at the agent, whose face was stern and sallow.

"qu'est-ce qui se passe?" vernet asked, his tone rough.

"je suis jerome collet, " the agent said. "lieutenant police judiciaire. " he motioned to the truck's
cargo hold. "qu'est-ce qu'ily a la dedans?"

"hell if i know," vernet replied in crude french. "i'm only a driver."

collet looked unimpressed. "we're looking for two criminals."

vernet laughed. "then you came to the right spot. some of these bastards i drive for have so much
money they must be criminals."

the agent held up a passport picture of robert langdon. "was this man in your bank tonight?"

vernet shrugged. "no clue. i'm a dock rat. they don't let us anywhere near the clients. you need to
go in and ask the front desk."

"your bank is demanding a search warrant before we can enter."

vernet put on a disgusted look. "administrators. don't get me started."

"open your truck, please." collet motioned toward the cargo hold.

vernet stared at the agent and forced an obnoxious laugh. "open the truck? you think i have keys?
you think they trust us? you should see the crap wages i get paid."

the agent's head tilted to one side, his skepticism evident. "you're telling me you don't have keys
to your own truck?"

vernet shook his head. "not the cargo area. ignition only. these trucks get sealed by overseers on



the loading dock. then the truck sits in dock while someone drives the cargo keys to the drop-off.
once we get the call that the cargo keys are with the recipient, then i get the okay to drive. not a
second before. i never know what the hell i'm lugging."

"when was this truck sealed?"

"must have been hours ago. i'm driving all the way up to st. thurial tonight. cargo keys are
already up there."

the agent made no response, his eyes probing as if trying to read vernet's mind.

a drop of sweat was preparing to slide down vernet's nose. "you mind?" he said, wiping his nose
with his sleeve and motioning to the police car blocking his way. "i'm on a tight schedule."

"do all the drivers wear rolexes?" the agent asked, pointing to vernet's wrist.

vernet glanced down and saw the glistening band of his absurdly expensive watch peeking out
from beneath the sleeve of his jacket. merde. "this piece of shit? bought it for twenty euro from a
taiwanese street vendor in st. germain des pres. i'll sell it to you for forty."

the agent paused and finally stepped aside. "no thanks. have a safe trip."

vernet did not breathe again until the truck was a good fifty meters down the street. and now he
had another problem. his cargo. where do i take them?



chapter 46

silas lay prone on the canvas mat in his room, allowing the lash wounds on his back to clot in the
air. tonight's second session with the discipline had left him dizzy and weak. he had yet to
remove the cilice belt, and he could feel the blood trickling down his inner thigh. still, he could not
justify removing the strap.

/ have failed the church.

far worse, i have failed the bishop.

tonight was supposed to be bishop aringarosa's salvation. five months ago, the bishop had
returned from a meeting at the vatican observatory, where he had learned something that left him
deeply changed. depressed for weeks, aringarosa had finally shared the news with silas.

"but this is impossible!" silas had cried out. "i cannot accept it!"



"it is true," aringarosa said. "unthinkable, but true. in only six months."

the bishop's words terrified silas. he prayed for deliverance, and even in those dark days, his trust
in god and the way never wavered. it was only a month later that the clouds parted miraculously
and the light of possibility shone through.

divine intervention, aringarosa had called it.

the bishop had seemed hopeful for the first time. "silas," he whispered, "god has bestowed upon
us an opportunity to protect the way. our battle, like all battles, will take sacrifice. will you be a
soldier of god?"

silas fell to his knees before bishop aringarosa — the man who had given him a new life — and he
said, "i am a lamb of god. shepherd me as your heart commands."

when aringarosa described the opportunity that had presented itself, silas knew it could only be
the hand of god at work. miraculous fate! aringarosa put silas in contact with the man who had
proposed the plan — a man who called himself the teacher. although the teacher and silas never
met face-to-face, each time they spoke by phone, silas was awed, both by the profundity of the
teacher's faith and by the scope of his power. the teacher seemed to be a man who knew all, a
man with eyes and ears in all places. how the teacher gathered his information, silas did not
know, but aringarosa had placed enormous trust in the teacher, and he had told silas to do the
same. "do as the teacher commands you," the bishop told silas. "and we will be victorious."

victorious. silas now gazed at the bare floor and feared victory had eluded them. the teacher had
been tricked. the keystone was a devious dead end. and with the deception, all hope had vanished.

silas wished he could call bishop aringarosa and warn him, but the teacher had removed all their
lines of direct communication tonight. for our safety.

finally, overcoming enormous trepidation, silas crawled to his feet and found his robe, which lay
on the floor. he dug his cell phone from the pocket. hanging his head in shame, he dialed.

"teacher," he whispered, "all is lost." silas truthfully told the man how he had been tricked.

"you lose your faith too quickly," the teacher replied. "i have just received news. most
unexpected and welcome. the secret lives. jacques sauniere transferred information before he
died. i will call you soon. our work tonight is not yet done."



chapter 47



riding inside the dimly lit cargo hold of the armored truck was like being transported inside a cell
for solitary confinement. langdon fought the all too familiar anxiety that haunted him in confined
spaces. vernet said he would take us a safe distance out of the city. where? how far?

langdon's legs had gotten stiff from sitting cross-legged on the metal floor, and he shifted his
position, wincing to feel the blood pouring back into his lower body. in his arms, he still clutched
the bizarre treasure they had extricated from the bank.

"i think we're on the highway now," sophie whispered.

langdon sensed the same thing. the truck, after an unnerving pause atop the bank ramp, had
moved on, snaking left and right for a minute or two, and was now accelerating to what felt like top
speed. beneath them, the bulletproof tires hummed on smooth pavement. forcing his attention to
the rosewood box in his arms, langdon laid the precious bundle on the floor, unwrapped his jacket,
and extracted the box, pulling it toward him. sophie shifted her position so they were sitting side
by side. langdon suddenly felt like they were two kids huddled over a christmas present.

in contrast to the warm colors of the rosewood box, the inlaid rose had been crafted of a pale wood,
probably ash, which shone clearly in the dim light. the rose. entire armies and religions had been
built on this symbol, as had secret societies. the rosicrucians. the knights of the rosy cross.

"go ahead," sophie said. "open it."

langdon took a deep breath. reaching for the lid, he stole one more admiring glance at the
intricate woodwork and then, unhooking the clasp, he opened the lid, revealing the object within.

langdon had harbored several fantasies about what they might find inside this box, but clearly he
had been wrong on every account. nestled snugly inside the box's heavily padded interior of
crimson silk lay an object langdon could not even begin to comprehend.

crafted of polished white marble, it was a stone cylinder approximately the dimensions of a tennis
ball can. more complicated than a simple column of stone, however, the cylinder appeared to have
been assembled in many pieces. six doughnut- sized disks of marble had been stacked and affixed
to one another within a delicate brass framework. it looked like some kind of tubular, multiwheeled
kaleidoscope. each end of the cylinder was affixed with an end cap, also marble, making it
impossible to see inside. having heard liquid within, langdon assumed the cylinder was hollow.

as mystifying as the construction of the cylinder was, however, it was the engravings around the
tube's circumference that drew langdon's primary focus. each of the six disks had been carefully
carved with the same unlikely series of letters — the entire alphabet. the lettered cylinder reminded
langdon of one of his childhood toys — a rod threaded with lettered tumblers that could be rotated
to spell different words.



"amazing, isn't it?" sophie whispered.

langdon glanced up. "i don't know. what the hell is it?"

now there was a glint in sophie's eye. "my grandfather used to craft these as a hobby. they were
invented by leonardo da vinci. "

even in the diffuse light, sophie could see langdon' s surprise.

"da vinci?" he muttered, looking again at the canister.

"yes. it's called a cryptex. according to my grandfather, the blueprints come from one of da
vinci's secret diaries."

"what is it for?"

considering tonight's events, sophie knew the answer might have some interesting implications.
"it's a vault," she said. "for storing secret information."

langdon's eyes widened further.

sophie explained that creating models of da vinci's inventions was one of her grandfather's best-
loved hobbies. a talented craftsman who spent hours in his wood and metal shop, jacques sauniere
enjoyed imitating master craftsmen — faberge, assorted cloisonne artisans, and the less artistic, but
far more practical, leonardo da vinci.

even a cursory glance through da vinci's journals revealed why the luminary was as notorious for
his lack of follow-through as he was famous for his brilliance. da vinci had drawn up blueprints
for hundreds of inventions he had never built. one of jacques sauniere's favorite pastimes was
bringing da vinci's more obscure brainstorms to life — timepieces, water pumps, cryptexes, and
even a fully articulated model of a medieval french knight, which now stood proudly on the desk
in his office. designed by da vinci in 1495 as an outgrowth of his earliest anatomy and
kinesiology studies, the internal mechanism of the robot knight possessed accurate joints and
tendons, and was designed to sit up, wave its arms, and move its head via a flexible neck while
opening and closing an anatomically correct jaw. this armor-clad knight, sophie had always
believed, was the most beautiful object her grandfather had ever built... that was, until she had seen
the cryptex in this rosewood box.

"he made me one of these when i was little," sophie said. "but i've never seen one so ornate and
large."

langdon's eyes had never left the box. "i've never heard of a cryptex."



sophie was not surprised. most of leonardo's unbuilt inventions had never been studied or even
named. the term cryptex possibly had been her grandfather's creation, an apt title for this device
that used the science of cryptology to protect information written on the contained scroll or codex.

da vinci had been a cryptology pioneer, sophie knew, although he was seldom given credit.
sophie's university instructors, while presenting computer encryption methods for securing data,
praised modern cryptologists like zimmerman and schneier but failed to mention that it was
leonardo who had invented one of the first rudimentary forms of public key encryption centuries
ago. sophie's grandfather, of course, had been the one to tell her all about that.

as their armored truck roared down the highway, sophie explained to langdon that the cryptex
had been da vinci's solution to the dilemma of sending secure messages over long distances. in an
era without telephones or e-mail, anyone wanting to convey private information to someone far
away had no option but to write it down and then trust a messenger to carry the letter.
unfortunately, if a messenger suspected the letter might contain valuable information, he could
make far more money selling the information to adversaries than he could delivering the letter
properly.

many great minds in history had invented cryptologic solutions to the challenge of data protection:
julius caesar devised a code-writing scheme called the caesar box; mary, queen of scots created
a transposition cipher and sent secret communiques from prison; and the brilliant arab scientist
abu yusuf ismail al-kindi protected his secrets with an ingeniously conceived polyalphabetic
substitution cipher.

da vinci, however, eschewed mathematics and cryptology for a mechanical solution. the cryptex.
a portable container that could safeguard letters, maps, diagrams, anything at all. once information
was sealed inside the cryptex, only the individual with the proper password could access it.

"we require a password," sophie said, pointing out the lettered dials. "a cryptex works much like a
bicycle's combination lock. if you align the dials in the proper position, the lock slides open. this
cryptex has five lettered dials. when you rotate them to their proper sequence, the tumblers inside
align, and the entire cylinder slides apart."

"and inside?"

"once the cylinder slides apart, you have access to a hollow central compartment, which can hold a
scroll of paper on which is the information you want to keep private."

langdon looked incredulous. "and you say your grandfather built these for you when you were
younger?"

"some smaller ones, yes. a couple times for my birthday, he gave me a cryptex and told me a
riddle. the answer to the riddle was the password to the cryptex, and once i figured it out, i could



open it up and find my birthday card."

"a lot of work for a card."

"no, the cards always contained another riddle or clue. my grandfather loved creating elaborate
treasure hunts around our house, a string of clues that eventually led to my real gift. each treasure
hunt was a test of character and merit, to ensure i earned my rewards. and the tests were never
simple."

langdon eyed the device again, still looking skeptical. "but why not just pry it apart? or smash it?
the metal looks delicate, and marble is a soft rock. "

sophie smiled. "because da vinci is too smart for that. he designed the cryptex so that if you try
to force it open in any way, the information self-destructs. watch." sophie reached into the box and
carefully lifted out the cylinder. "any information to be inserted is first written on a papyrus
scroll."

"not vellum?"

sophie shook her head. "papyrus. i know sheep's vellum was more durable and more common in
those days, but it had to be papyrus. the thinner the better."

"okay."

"before the papyrus was inserted into the cryptex's compartment, it was rolled around a delicate
glass vial." she tipped the cryptex, and the liquid inside gurgled. "a vial of liquid."

"liquid what?"

sophie smiled. "vinegar."

langdon hesitated a moment and then began nodding. "brilliant."

vinegar and papyrus, sophie thought. if someone attempted to force open the cryptex, the glass
vial would break, and the vinegar would quickly dissolve the papyrus. by the time anyone
extracted the secret message, it would be a glob of meaningless pulp.

"as you can see," sophie told him, "the only way to access the information inside is to know the
proper five-letter password. and with five dials, each with twenty-six letters, that's twenty-six to
the fifth power." she quickly estimated the permutations. "approximately twelve million
possibilities."

"if you say so," langdon said, looking like he had approximately twelve million questions running



through his head. "what information do you think is inside?"

"whatever it is, my grandfather obviously wanted very badly to keep it secret." she paused, closing
the box lid and eyeing the five-petal rose inlaid on it. something was bothering her. "did you say
earlier that the rose is a symbol for the grail?"

"exactly. in priory symbolism, the rose and the grail are synonymous."

sophie furrowed her brow. "that's strange, because my grandfather always told me the rose meant
secrecy. he used to hang a rose on his office door at home when he was having a confidential
phone call and didn't want me to disturb him. he encouraged me to do the same." sweetie, her
grandfather said, rather than lock each other out, we can each hang a rose — lafleur des
secrets — on our door when we need privacy. this way we learn to respect and trust each other.
hanging a rose is an ancient roman custom.

"sub rosa, " langdon said. "the romans hung a rose over meetings to indicate the meeting was
confidential. attendees understood that whatever was said under the rose — or sub rosa — had to
remain a secret."

langdon quickly explained that the rose's overtone of secrecy was not the only reason the priory
used it as a symbol for the grail. rosa rugosa, one of the oldest species of rose, had five petals and
pentagonal symmetry, just like the guiding star of venus, giving the rose strong iconographic ties
to womanhood. in addition, the rose had close ties to the concept of "true direction" and
navigating one's way. the compass rose helped travelers navigate, as did rose lines, the
longitudinal lines on maps. for this reason, the rose was a symbol that spoke of the grail on many
levels — secrecy, womanhood, and guidance — the feminine chalice and guiding star that led to
secret truth.

as langdon finished his explanation, his expression seemed to tighten suddenly.

"robert? are you okay?"

his eyes were riveted to the rosewood box. "sub... rosa, " he choked, a fearful bewilderment
sweeping across his face. "it can't be."

"what?"

langdon slowly raised his eyes. "under the sign of the rose," he whispered. "this cryptex... i
think i know what it is."



chapter 48



langdon could scarcely believe his own supposition, and yet, considering who had given this stone
cylinder to them, how he had given it to them, and now, the inlaid rose on the container, langdon
could formulate only one conclusion.

/ am holding the priory keystone.

the legend was specific.

the keystone is an encoded stone that lies beneath the sign of the rose.

"robert?" sophie was watching him. "what's going on?"

langdon needed a moment to gather his thoughts. "did your grandfather ever speak to you of
something called la clef de voiite?"

"the key to the vault?" sophie translated.

"no, that's the literal translation. clef de voiite is a common architectural term. voiite refers not to a
bank vault, but to a vault in an archway. like a vaulted ceiling."

"but vaulted ceilings don't have keys."

"actually they do. every stone archway requires a central, wedge-shaped stone at the top which
locks the pieces together and carries all the weight. this stone is, in an architectural sense, the key
to the vault. in english we call it a keystone. " langdon watched her eyes for any spark of
recognition.

sophie shrugged, glancing down at the cryptex. "but this obviously is not a keystone."

langdon didn't know where to begin. keystones as a masonry technique for building stone
archways had been one of the best-kept secrets of the early masonic brotherhood. the royal arch
degree. architecture. keystones. it was all interconnected. the secret knowledge of how to use a
wedged keystone to build a vaulted archway was part of the wisdom that had made the masons
such wealthy craftsmen, and it was a secret they guarded carefully. keystones had always had a
tradition of secrecy. and yet, the stone cylinder in the rosewood box was obviously something
quite different. the priory keystone — if this was indeed what they were holding — was not at all
what langdon had imagined.

"the priory keystone is not my specialty," langdon admitted. "my interest in the holy grail is
primarily symbologic, so i tend to ignore the plethora of lore regarding how to actually find it."

sophie's eyebrows arched. "find the holy grail?"



langdon gave an uneasy nod, speaking his next words carefully. "sophie, according to priory lore,
the keystone is an encoded map... a map that reveals the hiding place of the holy grail."

sophie's face went blank. "and you think this is it?"

langdon didn't know what to say. even to him it sounded unbelievable, and yet the keystone was
the only logical conclusion he could muster. an encrypted stone, hidden beneath the sign of the
rose.

the idea that the cryptex had been designed by leonardo da vinci — former grand master of the
priory of sion — shone as another tantalizing indicator that this was indeed the priory keystone. a
former grand master's blueprint... brought to life centuries later by another priory member. the
bond was too palpable to dismiss.

for the last decade, historians had been searching for the keystone in french churches. grail
seekers, familiar with the priory's history of cryptic double-talk, had concluded la clef de voute was
a literal keystone — an architectural wedge — an engraved, encrypted stone, inserted into a vaulted
archway in a church. beneath the sign of the rose. in architecture, there was no shortage of roses.
rose windows. rosette reliefs. and, of course, an abundance of cinquefoils — the five-petaled
decorative flowers often found at the top of archways, directly over the keystone. the hiding place
seemed diabolically simple. the map to the holy grail was incorporated high in an archway of
some forgotten church, mocking the blind churchgoers who wandered beneath it.

"this cryptex can't bo, the keystone," sophie argued. "it's not old enough. i'm certain my
grandfather made this. it can't be part of any ancient grail legend."

"actually," langdon replied, feeling a tingle of excitement ripple through him, "the keystone is
believed to have been created by the priory sometime in the past couple of decades."

sophie's eyes flashed disbelief. "but if this cryptex reveals the hiding place of the holy grail, why
would my grandfather give it to me ? i have no idea how to open it or what to do with it. i don't
even know what the holy grail is!"

langdon realized to his surprise that she was right. he had not yet had a chance to explain to
sophie the true nature of the holy grail. that story would have to wait. at the moment, they were
focused on the keystone.

if that is indeed what this is....

against the hum of the bulletproof wheels beneath them, langdon quickly explained to sophie
everything he had heard about the keystone. allegedly, for centuries, the priory's biggest
secret — the location of the holy grail — was never written down. for security's sake, it was



verbally transferred to each new rising senechal at a clandestine ceremony. however, at some point
during the last century, whisperings began to surface that the priory policy had changed. perhaps it
was on account of new electronic eavesdropping capabilities, but the priory vowed never again
even to speak the location of the sacred hiding place.

"but then how could they pass on the secret?" sophie asked.

"that's where the keystone comes in," langdon explained. "when one of the top four members
died, the remaining three would choose from the lower echelons the next candidate to ascend as
senechal. rather than telling the new senechal where the grail was hidden, they gave him a test
through which he could prove he was worthy."

sophie looked unsettled by this, and langdon suddenly recalled her mentioning how her
grandfather used to make treasure hunts for her — preuves de merite. admittedly, the keystone was
a similar concept. then again, tests like this were extremely common in secret societies. the best
known was the masons', wherein members ascended to higher degrees by proving they could keep
a secret and by performing rituals and various tests of merit over many years. the tasks became
progressively harder until they culminated in a successful candidate's induction as thirty-second-
degree mason.

"so the keystone is apreuve de merite, " sophie said. "if a rising priory senechal can open it, he
proves himself worthy of the information it holds."

langdon nodded. "i forgot you'd had experience with this sort of thing."

"not only with my grandfather. in cryptology, that's called a 'self-authorizing language.' that is, if
you're smart enough to read it, you're permitted to know what is being said. "

langdon hesitated a moment. "sophie, you realize that if this is indeed the keystone, your
grandfather's access to it implies he was exceptionally powerful within the priory of sion. he
would have to have been one of the highest four members."

sophie sighed. "he was powerful in a secret society. i'm certain of it. i can only assume it was the
priory. "

langdon did a double take. "you knew he was in a secret society?"

"i saw some things i wasn't supposed to see ten years ago. we haven't spoken since." she paused.
"my grandfather was not only a ranking top member of the group... i believe he was the top
member."

langdon could not believe what she had just said. "grand master? but... there's no way you could
know that!"



"i'd rather not talk about it." sophie looked away, her expression as determined as it was pained.

langdon sat in stunned silence. jacques sauniere? grand master? despite the astonishing
repercussions if it were true, langdon had the eerie sensation it almost made perfect sense. after
all, previous priory grand masters had also been distinguished public figures with artistic souls.
proof of that fact had been uncovered years ago in paris's bibliotheque nationale in papers that
became known as les dossiers secrets.

every priory historian and grail buff had read the dossiers. cataloged under number 4° lm 1 249,
the dossiers secrets had been authenticated by many specialists and incontrovertibly confirmed
what historians had suspected for a long time: priory grand masters included leonardo da vinci,
botticelli, sir isaac newton, victor hugo, and, more recently, jean cocteau, the famous parisian
artist.

why not jacques sauniere ?

langdon's incredulity intensified with the realization that he had been slated to meet sauniere
tonight. the priory grand master called a meeting with me. why? to make artistic small talk? it
suddenly seemed unlikely. after all, if langdon's instincts were correct, the grand master of the
priory of sion had just transferred the brotherhood's legendary keystone to his granddaughter and
simultaneously commanded her to find robert langdon.

inconceivable!

langdon's imagination could conjure no set of circumstances that would explain sauniere's
behavior. even if sauniere feared his own death, there were three senechaux who also possessed
the secret and therefore guaranteed the priory's security. why would sauniere take such an
enormous risk giving his granddaughter the keystone, especially when the two of them didn't get
along? and why involve langdon... a total stranger?

apiece of this puzzle is missing, langdon thought.

the answers were apparently going to have to wait. the sound of the slowing engine caused them
both to look up. gravel crunched beneath the tires. why is he pulling over already? langdon
wondered. vernet had told them he would take them well outside the city to safety. the truck
decelerated to a crawl and made its way over unexpectedly rough terrain. sophie shot langdon an
uneasy look, hastily closing the cryptex box and latching it. langdon slipped his jacket back on.

when the truck came to a stop, the engine remained idling as the locks on the rear doors began to
turn. when the doors swung open, langdon was surprised to see they were parked in a wooded
area, well off the road. vernet stepped into view, a strained look in his eye. in his hand, he held a
pistol.



'i'm sorry about this," he said. "i really have no choice.



chapter 49

andre vernet looked awkward with a pistol, but his eyes shone with a determination that langdon
sensed would be unwise to test.

"i'm afraid i must insist," vernet said, training the weapon on the two of them in the back of the
idling truck. "set the box down."

sophie clutched the box to her chest. "you said you and my grandfather were friends."

"i have a duty to protect your grandfather's assets," vernet replied. "and that is exactly what i am
doing. now set the box on the floor."

"my grandfather entrusted this to me!" sophie declared.

"do it," vernet commanded, raising the gun.

sophie set the box at her feet.

langdon watched the gun barrel swing now in his direction.

"mr. langdon," vernet said, "you will bring the box over to me. and be aware that i'm asking you
because you i would not hesitate to shoot."

langdon stared at the banker in disbelief. "why are you doing this?"

"why do you imagine?" vernet snapped, his accented english terse now. "to protect my client's

assets."

"we are your clients now," sophie said.

vernet's visage turned ice-cold, an eerie transformation. "mademoiselle neveu, i don't know how
you got that key and account number tonight, but it seems obvious that foul play was involved.
had i known the extent of your crimes, i would never have helped you leave the bank."

"i told you," sophie said, "we had nothing to do with my grandfather's death!"

vernet looked at langdon. "and yet the radio claims you are wanted not only for the murder of



jacques sauniere but for those of three other men as well?"

"what!" langdon was thunderstruck. three more murders? the coincidental number hit him
harder than the fact that he was the prime suspect. it seemed too unlikely to be a coincidence. the
three senechaux? langdon's eyes dropped to the rosewood box. if the senechaux were murdered,
sauniere had no options. he had to transfer the keystone to someone.

"the police can sort that out when i turn you in," vernet said. "i have gotten my bank involved too
far already."

sophie glared at vernet. "you obviously have no intention of turning us in. you would have driven
us back to the bank. and instead you bring us out here and hold us at gunpoint?"

"your grandfather hired me for one reason — to keep his possessions both safe and private.
whatever this box contains, i have no intention of letting it become a piece of cataloged evidence
in a police investigation. mr. langdon, bring me the box. "

sophie shook her head. "don't do it."

a gunshot roared, and a bullet tore into the wall above him. the reverberation shook the back of
the truck as a spent shell clinked onto the cargo floor.

shit! langdon froze.

vernet spoke more confidently now. "mr. langdon, pick up the box."

langdon lifted the box.

"now bring it over to me." vernet was taking dead aim, standing on the ground behind the rear
bumper, his gun outstretched into the cargo hold now.

box in hand, langdon moved across the hold toward the open door.

i've got to do something! langdon thought. i'm about to hand over the priory keystone! as
langdon moved toward the doorway, his position of higher ground became more pronounced, and
he began wondering if he could somehow use it to his advantage. vernet's gun, though raised, was
at langdon's knee level. a well-placed kick perhaps? unfortunately, as langdon neared, vernet
seemed to sense the dangerous dynamic developing, and he took several steps back, repositioning
himself six feet away. well out of reach.

vernet commanded, "place the box beside the door."

seeing no options, langdon knelt down and set the rosewood box at the edge of the cargo hold,



directly in front of the open doors.

"now stand up."

langdon began to stand up but paused, spying the small, spent pistol shell on the floor beside the
truck's precision-crafted doorsill.

"stand up, and step away from the box."

langdon paused a moment longer, eyeing the metal threshold. then he stood. as he did, he
discreetly brushed the shell over the edge onto the narrow ledge that was the door's lower sill. fully
upright now, langdon stepped backward.

"return to the back wall and turn around."

langdon obeyed.



vernet could feel his own heart pounding. aiming the gun with his right hand, he reached now
with his left for the wooden box. he discovered that it was far too heavy. / need two hands.
turning his eyes back to his captives, he calculated the risk. both were a good fifteen feet away, at
the far end of the cargo hold, facing away from him. vernet made up his mind. quickly, he laid
down the gun on the bumper, lifted the box with two hands, and set it on the ground, immediately
grabbing the gun again and aiming it back into the hold. neither of his prisoners had moved.

perfect. now all that remained was to close and lock the door. leaving the box on the ground for
the moment, he grabbed the metal door and began to heave it closed. as the door swung past him,
vernet reached up to grab the single bolt that needed to be slid into place. the door closed with a
thud, and vernet quickly grabbed the bolt, pulling it to the left. the bolt slid a few inches and
crunched to an unexpected halt, not lining up with its sleeve. what's going on? vernet pulled
again, but the bolt wouldn't lock. the mechanism was not properly aligned. the door isn't fully
closed! feeling a surge of panic, vernet shoved hard against the outside of the door, but it refused
to budge. something is blocking it! vernet turned to throw full shoulder into the door, but this time
the door exploded outward, striking vernet in the face and sending him reeling backward onto the
ground, his nose shattering in pain. the gun flew as vernet reached for his face and felt the warm
blood running from his nose.

robert langdon hit the ground somewhere nearby, and vernet tried to get up, but he couldn't see.
his vision blurred and he fell backward again. sophie neveu was shouting. moments later, vernet
felt a cloud of dirt and exhaust billowing over him. he heard the crunching of tires on gravel and
sat up just in time to see the truck's wide wheelbase fail to navigate a turn. there was a crash as the
front bumper clipped a tree. the engine roared, and the tree bent. finally, it was the bumper that



gave, tearing half off. the armored car lurched away, its front bumper dragging. when the truck
reached the paved access road, a shower of sparks lit up the night, trailing the truck as it sped away.

vernet turned his eyes back to the ground where the truck had been parked. even in the faint
moonlight he could see there was nothing there.

the wooden box was gone.



chapter 50

the unmarked fiat sedan departing castel gandolfo snaked downward through the alban hills
into the valley below. in the back seat, bishop aringarosa smiled, feeling the weight of the bearer
bonds in the briefcase on his lap and wondering how long it would be before he and the teacher
could make the exchange.

twenty million euro.

the sum would buy aringarosa power far more valuable than that.

as his car sped back toward rome, aringarosa again found himself wondering why the teacher
had not yet contacted him. pulling his cell phone from his cassock pocket, he checked the carrier
signal. extremely faint.

"cell service is intermittent up here," the driver said, glancing at him in the rearview mirror. "in
about five minutes, we'll be out of the mountains, and service improves."

"thank you." aringarosa felt a sudden surge of concern. no service in the mountains? maybe the
teacher had been trying to reach him all this time. maybe something had gone terribly wrong.

quickly, aringarosa checked the phone's voice mail. nothing. then again, he realized, the teacher
never would have left a recorded message; he was a man who took enormous care with his
communications. nobody understood better than the teacher the perils of speaking openly in this
modern world. electronic eavesdropping had played a major role in how he had gathered his
astonishing array of secret knowledge.

for this reason, he takes extra precautions.

unfortunately, the teacher's protocols for caution included a refusal to give aringarosa any kind of
contact number. / alone will initiate contact, the teacher had informed him. so keep your phone
close. now that aringarosa realized his phone might not have been working properly, he feared
what the teacher might think if he had been repeatedly phoning with no answer.



he '11 think something is wrong.

or that i failed to get the bonds.

the bishop broke a light sweat.

or worse... that i took the money and ran!



chapter 51

even at a modest sixty kilometers an hour, the dangling front bumper of the armored truck grated
against the deserted suburban road with a grinding roar, spraying sparks up onto the hood.

we've got to get off the road, langdon thought.

he could barely even see where they were headed. the truck's lone working headlight had been
knocked off-center and was casting a skewed sidelong beam into the woods beside the country
highway. apparently the armor in this "armored truck" referred only to the cargo hold and not the
front end.

sophie sat in the passenger seat, staring blankly at the rosewood box on her lap.

"are you okay?" langdon asked.

sophie looked shaken. "do you believe him?"

"about the three additional murders? absolutely. it answers a lot of questions — the issue of your
grandfather's desperation to pass on the keystone, as well as the intensity with which fache is
hunting me."

"no, i meant about vernet trying to protect his bank."

langdon glanced over. "as opposed to?"

"taking the keystone for himself."

langdon had not even considered it. "how would he even know what this box contains?"

"his bank stored it. he knew my grandfather. maybe he knew things. he might have decided he



wanted the grail for himself."

langdon shook his head. vernet hardly seemed the type. "in my experience, there are only two
reasons people seek the grail. either they are naive and believe they are searching for the long-lost
cup of christ..."

"or?"

"or they know the truth and are threatened by it. many groups throughout history have sought to
destroy the grail."

the silence between them accentuated the sound of the scraping bumper. they had driven a few
kilometers now, and as langdon watched the cascade of sparks coming off the front of the truck,
he wondered if it was dangerous. either way, if they passed another car, it would certainly draw
attention. langdon made up his mind.

"i'm going to see if i can bend this bumper back."

pulling onto the shoulder, he brought the truck to a stop.

silence at last.

as langdon walked toward the front of the truck, he felt surprisingly alert. staring into the barrel
of yet another gun tonight had given him a second wind. he took a deep breath of nighttime air and
tried to get his wits about him. accompanying the gravity of being a hunted man, langdon was
starting to feel the ponderous weight of responsibility, the prospect that he and sophie might
actually be holding an encrypted set of directions to one of the most enduring mysteries of all time.

as if this burden were not great enough, langdon now realized that any possibility of finding a
way to return the keystone to the priory had just evaporated. news of the three additional murders
had dire implications. the priory has been infiltrated. they are compromised. the brotherhood
was obviously being watched, or there was a mole within the ranks. it seemed to explain why
sauniere might have transferred the keystone to sophie and langdon — people outside the
brotherhood, people he knew were not compromised. we can 't very well give the keystone back to
the brotherhood. even if langdon had any idea how to find a priory member, chances were good
that whoever stepped forward to take the keystone could be the enemy himself. for the moment, at
least, it seemed the keystone was in sophie and langdon's hands, whether they wanted it or not.

the truck's front end looked worse than langdon had imagined. the left headlight was gone, and
the right one looked like an eyeball dangling from its socket. langdon straightened it, and it
dislodged again. the only good news was that the front bumper had been torn almost clean off.
langdon gave it a hard kick and sensed he might be able to break it off entirely.



as he repeatedly kicked the twisted metal, langdon recalled his earlier conversation with sophie.
my grandfather left me a phone message, sophie had told him. he said he needed to tell me the
truth about my family. at the time it had meant nothing, but now, knowing the priory of sion was
involved, langdon felt a startling new possibility emerge.

the bumper broke off suddenly with a crash. langdon paused to catch his breath. at least the truck
would no longer look like a fourth of july sparkler. he grabbed the bumper and began dragging it
out of sight into the woods, wondering where they should go next. they had no idea how to open
the cryptex, or why sauniere had given it to them. unfortunately, their survival tonight seemed to
depend on getting answers to those very questions.

we need help, langdon decided. professional help.

in the world of the holy grail and the priory of sion, that meant only one man. the challenge, of
course, would be selling the idea to sophie.



inside the armored car, while sophie waited for langdon to return, she could feel the weight of the
rosewood box on her lap and resented it. why did my grandfather give this to me ? she had not the
slightest idea what to do with it.

think, sophie! use your head. grand-pere is trying to tell you something!

opening the box, she eyed the cryptex's dials. a proof of merit. she could feel her grandfather's
hand at work. the keystone is a map that can be followed only by the worthy. it sounded like her
grandfather to the core.

lifting the cryptex out of the box, sophie ran her fingers over the dials. five letters. she rotated the
dials one by one. the mechanism moved smoothly. she aligned the disks such that her chosen
letters lined up between the cryptex's two brass alignment arrows on either end of the cylinder. the
dials now spelled a five-letter word that sophie knew was absurdly obvious.

g-r-a-i-l.

gently, she held the two ends of the cylinder and pulled, applying pressure slowly. the cryptex
didn't budge. she heard the vinegar inside gurgle and stopped pulling. then she tried again.

v-i-n-c-i

again, no movement.
v-o-u-t-e



nothing. the cryptex remained locked solid.

frowning, she replaced it in the rosewood box and closed the lid. looking outside at langdon,
sophie felt grateful he was with her tonight. p.s. find robert langdon. her grandfather's rationale
for including him was now clear. sophie was not equipped to understand her grandfather's
intentions, and so he had assigned robert langdon as her guide. a tutor to oversee her education.
unfortunately for langdon, he had turned out to be far more than a tutor tonight. he had become
the target of bezu fache... and some unseen force intent on possessing the holy grail.

whatever the grail turns out to be.

sophie wondered if finding out was worth her life.



as the armored truck accelerated again, langdon was pleased how much more smoothly it drove.
"do you know how to get to versailles?"

sophie eyed him. "sightseeing?"

"no, i have a plan. there's a religious historian i know who lives near versailles. i can't remember
exactly where, but we can look it up. i've been to his estate a few times. his name is leigh
teabing. he's a former british royal historian."

"and he lives in paris?"

"teabing's life passion is the grail. when whisperings of the priory keystone surfaced about fifteen
years ago, he moved to france to search churches in hopes of finding it. he's written some books
on the keystone and the grail. he may be able to help us figure out how to open it and what to do
with it."

sophie's eyes were wary. "can you trust him?"

"trust him to what? not steal the information?"

"and not to turn us in."

"i don't intend to tell him we're wanted by the police. i'm hoping he'll take us in until we can sort
all this out."

"robert, has it occurred to you that every television in france is probably getting ready to
broadcast our pictures? bezu fache always uses the media to his advantage. he'll make it
impossible for us to move around without being recognized."



terrific, langdon thought. my french tv debut will be on "paris 's most wanted. " at least jonas
faukman would be pleased; every time langdon made the news, his book sales jumped.

"is this man a good enough friend?" sophie asked.

langdon doubted teabing was someone who watched television, especially at this hour, but still
the question deserved consideration. instinct told langdon that teabing would be totally
trustworthy. an ideal safe harbor. considering the circumstances, teabing would probably trip
over himself to help them as much as possible. not only did he owe langdon a favor, but teabing
was a grail researcher, and sophie claimed her grandfather was the actual grand master of the
priory of sion. if teabing heard that, he would salivate at the thought of helping them figure this
out.

"teabing could be a powerful ally," langdon said. depending on how much you want to tell him.

"fache probably will be offering a monetary reward."

langdon laughed. "believe me, money is the last thing this guy needs." leigh teabing was
wealthy in the way small countries were wealthy. a descendant of britain's first duke of
lancaster, teabing had gotten his money the old-fashioned way — he'd inherited it. his estate
outside of paris was a seventeenth-century palace with two private lakes.

langdon had first met teabing several years ago through the british broadcasting corporation.
teabing had approached the bbc with a proposal for a historical documentary in which he would
expose the explosive history of the holy grail to a mainstream television audience. the bbc
producers loved teabing's hot premise, his research, and his credentials, but they had concerns that
the concept was so shocking and hard to swallow that the network might end up tarnishing its
reputation for quality journalism. at teabing's suggestion, the bbc solved its credibility fears by
soliciting three cameos from respected historians from around the world, all of whom corroborated
the stunning nature of the holy grail secret with their own research.

langdon had been among those chosen.

the bbc had flown langdon to teabing's paris estate for the filming. he sat before cameras in
teabing's opulent drawing room and shared his story, admitting his initial skepticism on hearing of
the alternate holy grail story, then describing how years of research had persuaded him that the
story was true. finally, langdon offered some of his own research — a series of symbologic
connections that strongly supported the seemingly controversial claims.

when the program aired in britain, despite its ensemble cast and well-documented evidence, the
premise rubbed so hard against the grain of popular christian thought that it instantly confronted a
firestorm of hostility. it never aired in the states, but the repercussions echoed across the atlantic.



shortly afterward, langdon received a postcard from an old friend — the catholic bishop of
philadelphia. the card simply read: et tu, robert?

"robert," sophie asked, "you're certain we can trust this man?"

"absolutely. we're colleagues, he doesn't need money, and i happen to know he despises the
french authorities. the french government taxes him at absurd rates because he bought a historic
landmark. he'll be in no hurry to cooperate with fache."

sophie stared out at the dark roadway. "if we go to him, how much do you want to tell him?"

langdon looked unconcerned. "believe me, leigh teabing knows more about the priory of sion
and the holy grail than anyone on earth. "

sophie eyed him. "more than my grandfather?"

"i meant more than anyone outside the brotherhood."

"how do you know teabing isn't a member of the brotherhood?"

"teabing has spent his life trying to broadcast the truth about the holy grail. the priory's oath is to
keep its true nature hidden. "

"sounds to me like a conflict of interest."

langdon understood her concerns. sauniere had given the cryptex directly to sophie, and although
she didn't know what it contained or what she was supposed to do with it, she was hesitant to
involve a total stranger. considering the information potentially enclosed, the instinct was probably
a good one. "we don't need to tell teabing about the keystone immediately. or at all, even. his
house will give us a place to hide and think, and maybe when we talk to him about the grail, you'll
start to have an idea why your grandfather gave this to you. "

"us, " sophie reminded.

langdon felt a humble pride and wondered yet again why sauniere had included him.

"do you know more or less where mr. teabing lives?" sophie asked.

"his estate is called chateau villette."

sophie turned with an incredulous look. "the chateau villette?"

"that's the one."



"nice friends."

"you know the estate?"

"i've passed it. it's in the castle district. twenty minutes from here."

langdon frowned. "that far?"

"yes, which will give you enough time to tell me what the holy grail really is."

langdon paused. "i'll tell you at teabing's. he and i specialize in different areas of the legend, so
between the two of us, you'll get the full story." langdon smiled. "besides, the grail has been
teabing's life, and hearing the story of the holy grail from leigh teabing will be like hearing the
theory of relativity from einstein himself."

"let's hope leigh doesn't mind late-night visitors."

"for the record, it's sir leigh." langdon had made that mistake only once. "teabing is quite a
character. he was knighted by the queen several years back after composing an extensive history
on the house of york."

sophie looked over. "you're kidding, right? we're going to visit a knight?"

langdon gave an awkward smile. "we're on a grail quest, sophie. who better to help us than a
knight?"



chapter 52

the sprawling 185-acre estate of chateau villette was located twenty-five minutes northwest of
paris in the environs of versailles. designed by francois mansart in 1668 for the count of aufflay,
it was one of paris's most significant historical chateaux. complete with two rectangular lakes and
gardens designed by le notre, chateau villette was more of a modest castle than a mansion. the
estate fondly had become known as la petite versailles.

langdon brought the armored truck to a shuddering stop at the foot of the mile-long driveway.
beyond the imposing security gate, sir leigh teabing's residence rose on a meadow in the
distance. the sign on the gate was in english: private property. no trespassing.

as if to proclaim his home a british isle unto itself, teabing had not only posted his signs in
english, but he had installed his gate's intercom entry system on the right-hand side of the



truck — the passenger's side everywhere in europe except england.

sophie gave the misplaced intercom an odd look. "and if someone arrives without a passenger?"

"don't ask." langdon had already been through that with teabing. "he prefers things the way they
are at home."

sophie rolled down her window. "robert, you'd better do the talking."

langdon shifted his position, leaning out across sophie to press the intercom button. as he did, an
alluring whiff of sophie's perfume filled his nostrils, and he realized how close they were. he
waited there, awkwardly prone, while a telephone began ringing over the small speaker.

finally, the intercom crackled and an irritated french accent spoke. "chateau villette. who is
calling?"

"this is robert langdon," langdon called out, sprawled across sophie's lap. "i'm a friend of sir
leigh teabing. i need his help."

"my master is sleeping. as was i. what is your business with him?"

"it is a private matter. one of great interest to him."

"then i'm sure he will be pleased to receive you in the morning."

langdon shifted his weight. "it's quite important."

"as is sir leigh's sleep. if you are a friend, then you are aware he is in poor health."

sir leigh teabing had suffered from polio as a child and now wore leg braces and walked with
crutches, but langdon had found him such a lively and colorful man on his last visit that it hardly
seemed an infirmity. "if you would, please tell him i have uncovered new information about the
grail. information that cannot wait until morning."

there was a long pause.

langdon and sophie waited, the truck idling loudly.

a full minute passed.

finally, someone spoke. "my good man, i daresay you are still on harvard standard time." the
voice was crisp and light.



langdon grinned, recognizing the thick british accent. "leigh, my apologies for waking you at this
obscene hour."

"my manservant tells me that not only are you in paris, but you speak of the grail."

"i thought that might get you out of bed."

"and so it has."

"any chance you'd open the gate for an old friend?"

"those who seek the truth are more than friends. they are brothers."

langdon rolled his eyes at sophie, well accustomed to teabing's predilection for dramatic antics.

"indeed i will open the gate," teabing proclaimed, "but first i must confirm your heart is true. a
test of your honor. you will answer three questions."

langdon groaned, whispering at sophie. "bear with me here. as i mentioned, he's something of a
character."

"your first question," teabing declared, his tone herculean. "shall i serve you coffee, or tea?"

langdon knew teabing's feelings about the american phenomenon of coffee. "tea," he replied.
"earl grey."

"excellent. your second question. milk or sugar?"

langdon hesitated.

"milk, " sophie whispered in his ear. "i think the british take milk."

"milk," langdon said.

silence.

"sugar?"

teabing made no reply.

wait! langdon now recalled the bitter beverage he had been served on his last visit and realized
this question was a trick. "lemon!" he declared. "earl grey with lemon"



"indeed." teabing sounded deeply amused now. "and finally, i must make the most grave of
inquiries." teabing paused and then spoke in a solemn tone. "in which year did a harvard sculler
last outrow an oxford man at henley?"

langdon had no idea, but he could imagine only one reason the question had been asked. "surely
such a travesty has never occurred. "

the gate clicked open. "your heart is true, my friend. you may pass."



chapter 53

"monsieur vernet!" the night manager of the depository bank of zurich felt relieved to hear the
bank president's voice on the phone. "where did you go, sir? the police are here, everyone is
waiting for you!"

"i have a little problem," the bank president said, sounding distressed. "i need your help right

away."

you have more than a little problem, the manager thought. the police had entirely surrounded the
bank and were threatening to have the dcpj captain himself show up with the warrant the bank
had demanded. "how can i help you, sir?"

"armored truck number three. i need to find it."

puzzled, the manager checked his delivery schedule. "it's here. downstairs at the loading dock."

"actually, no. the truck was stolen by the two individuals the police are tracking."

"what? how did they drive out?"

"i can't go into the specifics on the phone, but we have a situation here that could potentially be
extremely unfortunate for the bank. "

"what do you need me to do, sir?"

"i'd like you to activate the truck's emergency transponder."

the night manager's eyes moved to the lojack control box across the room. like many armored
cars, each of the bank's trucks had been equipped with a radio-controlled homing device, which
could be activated remotely from the bank. the manager had only used the emergency system
once, after a hijacking, and it had worked flawlessly — locating the truck and transmitting the



coordinates to the authorities automatically. tonight, however, the manager had the impression the
president was hoping for a bit more prudence. "sir, you are aware that if i activate the lojack
system, the transponder will simultaneously inform the authorities that we have a problem."

vernet was silent for several seconds. "yes, i know. do it anyway. truck number three. i'll hold. i
need the exact location of that truck the instant you have it."

"right away, sir."



thirty seconds later, forty kilometers away, hidden in the undercarriage of the armored truck, a tiny
transponder blinked to life.



chapter 54

as langdon and sophie drove the armored truck up the winding, poplar-lined driveway toward the
house, sophie could already feel her muscles relaxing. it was a relief to be off the road, and she
could think of few safer places to get their feet under them than this private, gated estate owned by
a good-natured foreigner.

they turned into the sweeping circular driveway, and chateau villette came into view on their
right. three stories tall and at least sixty meters long, the edifice had gray stone facing illuminated
by outside spotlights. the coarse facade stood in stark juxtaposition to the immaculately
landscaped gardens and glassy pond.

the inside lights were just now coming on.

rather than driving to the front door, langdon pulled into a parking area nestled in the evergreens.
"no reason to risk being spotted from the road," he said. "or having leigh wonder why we arrived
in a wrecked armored truck."

sophie nodded. "what do we do with the cryptex? we probably shouldn't leave it out here, but if
leigh sees it, he'll certainly want to know what it is."

"not to worry," langdon said, removing his jacket as he stepped out of the car. he wrapped the
tweed coat around the box and held the bundle in his arms like a baby.

sophie looked dubious. "subtle."



"teabing never answers his own door; he prefers to make an entrance. i'll find somewhere inside to
stash this before he joins us." langdon paused. "actually, i should probably warn you before you
meet him. sir leigh has a sense of humor that people often find a bit... strange."

sophie doubted anything tonight would strike her as strange anymore.

the pathway to the main entrance was hand-laid cobblestone. it curved to a door of carved oak and
cherry with a brass knocker the size of a grapefruit. before sophie could grasp the knocker, the
door swung open from within.

a prim and elegant butler stood before them, making final adjustments on the white tie and tuxedo
he had apparently just donned. he looked to be about fifty, with refined features and an austere
expression that left little doubt he was unamused by their presence here.

"sir leigh will be down presently," he declared, his accent thick french. "he is dressing. he
prefers not to greet visitors while wearing only a nightshirt. may i take your coat?" he scowled at
the bunched-up tweed in langdon' s arms.

"thank you, i'm fine."

"of course you are. right this way, please."

the butler guided them through a lush marble foyer into an exquisitely adorned drawing room,
softly lit by tassel-draped victorian lamps. the air inside smelled antediluvian, regal somehow,
with traces of pipe tobacco, tea leaves, cooking sherry, and the earthen aroma of stone architecture.
against the far wall, flanked between two glistening suits of chain mail armor, was a rough-hewn
fireplace large enough to roast an ox. walking to the hearth, the butler knelt and touched a match to
a pre-laid arrangement of oak logs and kindling. a fire quickly crackled to life.

the man stood, straightening his jacket. "his master requests that you make yourselves at home."
with that, he departed, leaving langdon and sophie alone.

sophie wondered which of the fireside antiques she was supposed to sit on — the renaissance
velvet divan, the rustic eagle-claw rocker, or the pair of stone pews that looked like they'd been
lifted from some byzantine temple.

langdon unwrapped the cryptex from his coat, walked to the velvet divan, and slid the wooden box
deep underneath it, well out of sight. then, shaking out his jacket, he put it back on, smoothed the
lapels, and smiled at sophie as he sat down directly over the stashed treasure.

the divan it is, sophie thought, taking a seat beside him.

as she stared into the growing fire, enjoying the warmth, sophie had the sensation that her



grandfather would have loved this room. the dark wood paneling was bedecked with old master
paintings, one of which sophie recognized as a poussin, her grandfather's second-favorite painter.
on the mantel above the fireplace, an alabaster bust of isis watched over the room.

beneath the egyptian goddess, inside the fireplace, two stone gargoyles served as andirons, their
mouths gaping to reveal their menacing hollow throats. gargoyles had always terrified sophie as a
child; that was, until her grandfather cured her of the fear by taking her atop notre dame cathedral
in a rainstorm. "princess, look at these silly creatures," he had told her, pointing to the gargoyle
rainspouts with their mouths gushing water. "do you hear that funny sound in their throats?"
sophie nodded, having to smile at the burping sound of the water gurgling through their throats.
"they're gargling, " her grandfather told her. "gargariser! and that's where they get the silly name
'gargoyles.' " sophie had never again been afraid.

the fond memory caused sophie a pang of sadness as the harsh reality of the murder gripped her
again. grand-pere is gone. she pictured the cryptex under the divan and wondered if leigh
teabing would have any idea how to open it. or if we even should ask him. sophie's grandfather's
final words had instructed her to find robert langdon. he had said nothing about involving anyone
else. we needed somewhere to hide, sophie said, deciding to trust robert's judgment.

"sir robert!" a voice bellowed somewhere behind them. "i see you travel with a maiden."

langdon stood up. sophie jumped to her feet as well. the voice had come from the top of a curled
staircase that snaked up to the shadows of the second floor. at the top of the stairs, a form moved
in the shadows, only his silhouette visible.

"good evening," langdon called up. "sir leigh, may i present sophie neveu."

"an honor." teabing moved into the light.

"thank you for having us," sophie said, now seeing the man wore metal leg braces and used
crutches. he was coming down one stair at a time. "i realize it's quite late."

"it is so late, my dear, it's early." he laughed. "vous n'etes pas americaine?"

sophie shook her head. "parisienne. "

"your english is superb."

"thank you. i studied at the royal holloway."

"so then, that explains it." teabing hobbled lower through the shadows. "perhaps robert told you i
schooled just down the road at oxford." teabing fixed langdon with a devilish smile. "of course, i
also applied to harvard as my safety school."



their host arrived at the bottom of the stairs, appearing to sophie no more like a knight than sir
elton john. portly and ruby-faced, sir leigh teabing had bushy red hair and jovial hazel eyes that
seemed to twinkle as he spoke. he wore pleated pants and a roomy silk shirt under a paisley vest.
despite the aluminum braces on his legs, he carried himself with a resilient, vertical dignity that
seemed more a by-product of noble ancestry than any kind of conscious effort.

teabing arrived and extended a hand to langdon. "robert, you've lost weight."

langdon grinned. "and you've found some."

teabing laughed heartily, patting his rotund belly. "touche. my only carnal pleasures these days
seem to be culinary. " turning now to sophie, he gently took her hand, bowing his head slightly,
breathing lightly on her fingers, and diverting his eyes. "m'lady."

sophie glanced at langdon, uncertain whether she'd stepped back in time or into a nuthouse.

the butler who had answered the door now entered carrying a tea service, which he arranged on a
table in front of the fireplace.

"this is remy legaludec," teabing said, "my manservant."

the slender butler gave a stiff nod and disappeared yet again.

"remy is lyonais, " teabing whispered, as if it were an unfortunate disease. "but he does sauces
quite nicely."

langdon looked amused. "i would have thought you'd import an english staff?"

"good heavens, no! i would not wish a british chef on anyone except the french tax collectors."
he glanced over at sophie. "pardonnez-moi, mademoiselle neveu. please be assured that my
distaste for the french extends only to politics and the soccer pitch. your government steals my
money, and your football squad recently humiliated us."

sophie offered an easy smile.

teabing eyed her a moment and then looked at langdon. "something has happened. you both look
shaken. "

langdon nodded. "we've had an interesting night, leigh."

"no doubt. you arrive on my doorstep unannounced in the middle of the night speaking of the
grail. tell me, is this indeed about the grail, or did you simply say that because you know it is the
lone topic for which i would rouse myself in the middle of the night?"



a little of both, sophie thought, picturing the cryptex hidden beneath the couch.

"leigh," langdon said, "we'd like to talk to you about the priory of sion."

teabing's bushy eyebrows arched with intrigue. "the keepers. so this is indeed about the grail.
you say you come with information? something new, robert?"

"perhaps. we're not quite sure. we might have a better idea if we could get some information from
you first."

teabing wagged his finger. "ever the wily american. a game of quid pro quo. very well. i am at
your service. what is it i can tell you?"

langdon sighed. "i was hoping you would be kind enough to explain to ms. neveu the true nature
of the holy grail."

teabing looked stunned. "she doesn't know?"

langdon shook his head.

the smile that grew on teabing's face was almost obscene. "robert, you've brought me a virgin?"

langdon winced, glancing at sophie. "virgin is the term grail enthusiasts use to describe anyone
who has never heard the true grail story."

teabing turned eagerly to sophie. "how much do you know, my dear?"

sophie quickly outlined what langdon had explained earlier — the priory of sion, the knights
templar, the sangreal documents, and the holy grail, which many claimed was not a cup... but
rather something far more powerful.



"that's all?" teabing fired langdon a scandalous look. "robert, i thought you were a gentleman.
you've robbed her of the climax!"

"i know, i thought perhaps you and i could..." langdon apparently decided the unseemly metaphor
had gone far enough.

teabing already had sophie locked in his twinkling gaze. "you are a grail virgin, my dear. and
trust me, you will never forget your first time."



chapter 55

seated on the divan beside langdon, sophie drank her tea and ate a scone, feeling the welcome
effects of caffeine and food. sir leigh teabing was beaming as he awkwardly paced before the
open fire, his leg braces clicking on the stone hearth.

"the holy grail," teabing said, his voice sermonic. "most people ask me only where it is. i fear
that is a question i may never answer." he turned and looked directly at sophie. "however... the far
more relevant question is this: what is the holy grail?"

sophie sensed a rising air of academic anticipation now in both of her male companions.

"to fully understand the grail," teabing continued, "we must first understand the bible. how well
do you know the new testament?"

sophie shrugged. "not at all, really. i was raised by a man who worshipped leonardo da vinci."

teabing looked both startled and pleased. "an enlightened soul. superb! then you must be aware
that leonardo was one of the keepers of the secret of the holy grail. and he hid clues in his art."

"robert told me as much, yes."

"and da vinci's views on the new testament?"

"i have no idea."

teabing's eyes turned mirthful as he motioned to the bookshelf across the room. "robert, would
you mind? on the bottom shelf. la storia di leonardo. "

langdon went across the room, found a large art book, and brought it back, setting it down on the
table between them. twisting the book to face sophie, teabing flipped open the heavy cover and
pointed inside the rear cover to a series of quotations. "from da vinci's notebook on polemics and
speculation," teabing said, indicating one quote in particular. "i think you'll find this relevant to
our discussion."



sophie read the words.



many have made a trade of delusions

and false miracles, deceiving the stupid multitude.

—leonardo da vinci



"here's another," teabing said, pointing to a different quote.



blinding ignorance does mislead us.

01 wretched mortals, open your eyes!

—leonardo da vinci



sophie felt a little chill. "da vinci is talking about the bible?"

teabing nodded. "leonardo's feelings about the bible relate directly to the holy grail. in fact, da
vinci painted the true grail, which i will show you momentarily, but first we must speak of the
bible." teabing smiled. "and everything you need to know about the bible can be summed up by
the great canon doctor martyn percy." teabing cleared his throat and declared, "the bible did not
arrive by fax from heaven."

"i beg your pardon?"

"the bible is a product of man, my dear. not of god. the bible did not fall magically from the
clouds. man created it as a historical record of tumultuous times, and it has evolved through
countless translations, additions, and revisions. history has never had a definitive version of the
book."

"okay."

"jesus christ was a historical figure of staggering influence, perhaps the most enigmatic and
inspirational leader the world has ever seen. as the prophesied messiah, jesus toppled kings,
inspired millions, and founded new philosophies. as a descendant of the lines of king solomon
and king david, jesus possessed a rightful claim to the throne of the king of the jews.
understandably, his life was recorded by thousands of followers across the land." teabing paused
to sip his tea and then placed the cup back on the mantel. "more than eighty gospels were
considered for the new testament, and yet only a relative few were chosen for
inclusion — matthew, mark, luke, and john among them.

"who chose which gospels to include?" sophie asked.

"aha!" teabing burst in with enthusiasm. "the fundamental irony of christianity! the bible, as we
know it today, was collated by the pagan roman emperor constantine the great."

"i thought constantine was a christian," sophie said.

"hardly," teabing scoffed. "he was a lifelong pagan who was baptized on his deathbed, too weak
to protest. in constantine's day, rome's official religion was sun worship — the cult of sol invictus,
or the invincible sun — and constantine was its head priest. unfortunately for him, a growing
religious turmoil was gripping rome. three centuries after the crucifixion of jesus christ, christ's



followers had multiplied exponentially. christians and pagans began warring, and the conflict grew
to such proportions that it threatened to rend rome in two. constantine decided something had to
be done. in 325 a.d., he decided to unify rome under a single religion. christianity."

sophie was surprised. "why would a pagan emperor choose christianity as the official religion?"

teabing chuckled. "constantine was a very good businessman. he could see that christianity was
on the rise, and he simply backed the winning horse. historians still marvel at the brilliance with
which constantine converted the sun-worshipping pagans to christianity. by fusing pagan
symbols, dates, and rituals into the growing christian tradition, he created a kind of hybrid religion
that was acceptable to both parties."

"transmogrification," langdon said. "the vestiges of pagan religion in christian symbology are
undeniable. egyptian sun disks became the halos of catholic saints. pictograms of isis nursing her
miraculously conceived son horus became the blueprint for our modern images of the virgin mary
nursing baby jesus. and virtually all the elements of the catholic ritual — the miter, the altar, the
doxology, and communion, the act of "god-eating" — were taken directly from earlier pagan
mystery religions."

teabing groaned. "don't get a symbologist started on christian icons. nothing in christianity is
original. the pre-christian god mithras — called the son of god and the light of the world — was
born on december 25, died, was buried in a rock tomb, and then resurrected in three days. by the
way, december 25 is also the birthday of osiris, adonis, and dionysus. the newborn krishna was
presented with gold, frankincense, and myrrh. even christianity's weekly holy day was stolen from
the pagans."

"what do you mean?"

"originally," langdon said, "christianity honored the jewish sabbath of saturday, but constantine
shifted it to coincide with the pagan's veneration day of the sun." he paused, grinning. "to this
day, most churchgoers attend services on sunday morning with no idea that they are there on
account of the pagan sun god's weekly tribute — sunday."

sophie's head was spinning. "and all of this relates to the grail?"

"indeed," teabing said. "stay with me. during this fusion of religions, constantine needed to
strengthen the new christian tradition, and held a famous ecumenical gathering known as the
council of nicaea."

sophie had heard of it only insofar as its being the birthplace of the nicene creed.

"at this gathering," teabing said, "many aspects of christianity were debated and voted upon — the
date of easter, the role of the bishops, the administration of sacraments, and, of course, the divinity



of jesus."

"i don't follow. his divinity?"

"my dear," teabing declared, "until that moment in history, jesus was viewed by his followers as
a mortal prophet... a great and powerful man, but a man nonetheless. a mortal."

"not the son of god?"

"right," teabing said. "jesus' establishment as 'the son of god' was officially proposed and voted
on by the council of nicaea. "

"hold on. you're saying jesus' divinity was the result of a vote?"

"a relatively close vote at that," teabing added. "nonetheless, establishing christ's divinity was
critical to the further unification of the roman empire and to the new vatican power base. by
officially endorsing jesus as the son of god, constantine turned jesus into a deity who existed
beyond the scope of the human world, an entity whose power was unchallengeable. this not only
precluded further pagan challenges to christianity, but now the followers of christ were able to
redeem themselves only via the established sacred channel — the roman catholic church. "

sophie glanced at langdon, and he gave her a soft nod of concurrence.

"it was all about power," teabing continued. "christ as messiah was critical to the functioning of
church and state. many scholars claim that the early church literally stole jesus from his original
followers, hijacking his human message, shrouding it in an impenetrable cloak of divinity, and
using it to expand their own power. i've written several books on the topic."

"and i assume devout christians send you hate mail on a daily basis?"

"why would they?" teabing countered. "the vast majority of educated christians know the history
of their faith. jesus was indeed a great and powerful man. constantine's underhanded political
maneuvers don't diminish the majesty of christ's life. nobody is saying christ was a fraud, or
denying that he walked the earth and inspired millions to better lives. all we are saying is that
constantine took advantage of christ's substantial influence and importance. and in doing so, he
shaped the face of christianity as we know it today."

sophie glanced at the art book before her, eager to move on and see the da vinci painting of the
holy grail.

"the twist is this," teabing said, talking faster now. "because constantine upgraded jesus' status
almost four centuries after jesus' death, thousands of documents already existed chronicling his
life as a mortal man. to rewrite the history books, constantine knew he would need a bold stroke.



from this sprang the most profound moment in christian history." teabing paused, eyeing sophie.
"constantine commissioned and financed a new bible, which omitted those gospels that spoke of
christ's human traits and embellished those gospels that made him godlike. the earlier gospels
were outlawed, gathered up, and burned."

"an interesting note," langdon added. "anyone who chose the forbidden gospels over
constantine's version was deemed a heretic. the word heretic derives from that moment in history.
the latin word haereticus means 'choice.' those who 'chose' the original history of christ were the
world's first heretics. "

"fortunately for historians," teabing said, "some of the gospels that constantine attempted to
eradicate managed to survive. the dead sea scrolls were found in the 1950s hidden in a cave near
qumran in the judean desert. and, of course, the coptic scrolls in 1945 at nag hammadi. in
addition to telling the true grail story, these documents speak of christ's ministry in very human
terms. of course, the vatican, in keeping with their tradition of misinformation, tried very hard to
suppress the release of these scrolls. and why wouldn't they? the scrolls highlight glaring
historical discrepancies and fabrications, clearly confirming that the modern bible was compiled
and edited by men who possessed a political agenda — to promote the divinity of the man jesus
christ and use his influence to solidify their own power base."

"and yet," langdon countered, "it's important to remember that the modern church's desire to
suppress these documents comes from a sincere belief in their established view of christ. the
vatican is made up of deeply pious men who truly believe these contrary documents could only be
false testimony. "

teabing chuckled as he eased himself into a chair opposite sophie. "as you can see, our professor
has a far softer heart for rome than i do. nonetheless, he is correct about the modern clergy
believing these opposing documents are false testimony. that's understandable. constantine's bible
has been their truth for ages. nobody is more indoctrinated than the indoctrinator. "

"what he means," langdon said, "is that we worship the gods of our fathers."

"what i mean," teabing countered, "is that almost everything our fathers taught us about christ is
false. as are the stories about the holy grail."

sophie looked again at the da vinci quote before her. blinding ignorance does mislead us. 01
wretched mortals, open your eyes!

teabing reached for the book and flipped toward the center. "and finally, before i show you da
vinci's paintings of the holy grail, i'd like you to take a quick look at this." he opened the book to
a colorful graphic that spanned both full pages. "i assume you recognize this fresco?"

he's kidding, right? sophie was staring at the most famous fresco of all time — the last



supper — da vinci's legendary painting from the wall of santa maria delle grazie near milan. the
decaying fresco portrayed jesus and his disciples at the moment that jesus announced one of them
would betray him. "i know the fresco, yes."

"then perhaps you would indulge me this little game? close your eyes if you would."

uncertain, sophie closed her eyes.

"where is jesus sitting?" teabing asked.

"in the center."

"good. and what food are he and his disciples breaking and eating?"

"bread." obviously.

"superb. and what drink?"

"wine. they drank wine."

"great. and one final question. how many wineglasses are on the table?"

sophie paused, realizing it was the trick question. and after dinner, jesus took the cup of wine,
sharing it with his disciples. "one cup," she said. "the chalice." the cup of christ. the holy
grail. "jesus passed a single chalice of wine, just as modern christians do at communion."

teabing sighed. "open your eyes."

she did. teabing was grinning smugly. sophie looked down at the painting, seeing to her
astonishment that everyone at the table had a glass of wine, including christ. thirteen cups.
moreover, the cups were tiny, stemless, and made of glass. there was no chalice in the painting.
no holy grail.

teabing's eyes twinkled. "a bit strange, don't you think, considering that both the bible and our
standard grail legend celebrate this moment as the definitive arrival of the holy grail. oddly, da
vinci appears to have forgotten to paint the cup of christ. "

"surely art scholars must have noted that."

"you will be shocked to learn what anomalies da vinci included here that most scholars either do
not see or simply choose to ignore. this fresco, in fact, is the entire key to the holy grail mystery.
da vinci lays it all out in the open in the last supper"



sophie scanned the work eagerly. "does this fresco tell us what the grail really is?"

"not what it is," teabing whispered. "but rather who it is. the holy grail is not a thing. it is, in
fact... a. person"



chapter 56

sophie stared at teabing a long moment and then turned to langdon. "the holy grail is a person?"

langdon nodded. "a woman, in fact." from the blank look on sophie's face, langdon could tell
they had already lost her. he recalled having a similar reaction the first time he heard the
statement. it was not until he understood the symbology behind the grail that the feminine
connection became clear.

teabing apparently had a similar thought. "robert, perhaps this is the moment for the symbologist
to clarify?" he went to a nearby end table, found a piece of paper, and laid it in front of langdon.

langdon pulled a pen from his pocket. "sophie, are you familiar with the modern icons for male
and female?" he drew the common male symbol c? and female symbol ¥.

"of course," she said.

"these," he said quietly, "are not the original symbols for male and female. many people
incorrectly assume the male symbol is derived from a shield and spear, while the female symbol
represents a mirror reflecting beauty. in fact, the symbols originated as ancient astronomical
symbols for the planet-god mars and planet-goddess venus. the original symbols are far simpler."
langdon drew another icon on the paper.




"this symbol is the original icon for male, " he told her. "a rudimentary phallus."

"quite to the point," sophie said.

"as it were," teabing added.

langdon went on. "this icon is formally known as the blade, and it represents aggression and
manhood. in fact, this exact phallus symbol is still used today on modern military uniforms to
denote rank."



"indeed." teabing grinned. "the more penises you have, the higher your rank. boys will be boys."

langdon winced. "moving on, the female symbol, as you might imagine, is the exact opposite." he
drew another symbol on the page. "this is called the chalice. "




sophie glanced up, looking surprised.

langdon could see she had made the connection. "the chalice," he said, "resembles a cup or
vessel, and more important, it resembles the shape of a woman's womb. this symbol
communicates femininity, womanhood, and fertility." langdon looked directly at her now.
"sophie, legend tells us the holy grail is a chalice — a cup. but the grail's description as a chalice
is actually an allegory to protect the true nature of the holy grail. that is to say, the legend uses
the chalice as a metaphor for something far more important."

"a woman," sophie said.

"exactly." langdon smiled. "the grail is literally the ancient symbol for womanhood, and the
holy grail represents the sacred feminine and the goddess, which of course has now been lost,
virtually eliminated by the church. the power of the female and her ability to produce life was
once very sacred, but it posed a threat to the rise of the predominantly male church, and so the
sacred feminine was demonized and called unclean. it was man, not god, who created the concept
of 'original sin,' whereby eve tasted of the apple and caused the downfall of the human race.
woman, once the sacred giver of life, was now the enemy."

"i should add," teabing chimed, "that this concept of woman as life-bringer was the foundation of
ancient religion. childbirth was mystical and powerful. sadly, christian philosophy decided to
embezzle the female's creative power by ignoring biological truth and making man the creator.
genesis tells us that eve was created from adam's rib. woman became an offshoot of man. and a
sinful one at that. genesis was the beginning of the end for the goddess."

"the grail," langdon said, "is symbolic of the lost goddess. when christianity came along, the old
pagan religions did not die easily. legends of chivalric quests for the lost grail were in fact stories
of forbidden quests to find the lost sacred feminine. knights who claimed to be "searching for the
chalice" were speaking in code as a way to protect themselves from a church that had subjugated
women, banished the goddess, burned nonbelievers, and forbidden the pagan reverence for the
sacred feminine."

sophie shook her head. "i'm sorry, when you said the holy grail was a person, i thought you
meant it was an actual person."



"it is," langdon said.

"and not just any person," teabing blurted, clambering excitedly to his feet. "a woman who
carried with her a secret so powerful that, if revealed, it threatened to devastate the very foundation
of christianity!"

sophie looked overwhelmed. "is this woman well known in history?"

"quite." teabing collected his crutches and motioned down the hall. "and if we adjourn to the
study, my friends, it would be my honor to show you da vinci's painting of her."



two rooms away, in the kitchen, manservant remy legaludec stood in silence before a television.
the news station was broadcasting photos of a man and woman... the same two individuals to
whom remy had just served tea.



chapter 57

standing at the roadblock outside the depository bank of zurich, lieutenant collet wondered what
was taking fache so long to come up with the search warrant. the bankers were obviously hiding
something. they claimed langdon and neveu had arrived earlier and were turned away from the
bank because they did not have proper account identification.

so why won't they let us inside for a look?

finally, collet's cellular phone rang. it was the command post at the louvre. "do we have a search
warrant yet?" collet demanded.

"forget about the bank, lieutenant," the agent told him. "we just got a tip. we have the exact
location where langdon and neveu are hiding."

collet sat down hard on the hood of his car. "you're kidding."

"i have an address in the suburbs. somewhere near versailles."

"does captain fache know?"

"not yet. he's busy on an important call."



"i'm on my way. have him call as soon as he's free." collet took down the address and jumped in
his car. as he peeled away from the bank, collet realized he had forgotten to ask who had tipped
dcpj off to langdon's location. not that it mattered. collet had been blessed with a chance to
redeem his skepticism and earlier blunders. he was about to make the most high-profile arrest of
his career.

collet radioed the five cars accompanying him. "no sirens, men. langdon can't know we're
coming."



forty kilometers away, a black audi pulled off a rural road and parked in the shadows on the edge
of a field. silas got out and peered through the rungs of the wrought-iron fence that encircled the
vast compound before him. he gazed up the long moonlit slope to the chateau in the distance.

the downstairs lights were all ablaze. odd for this hour, silas thought, smiling. the information
the teacher had given him was obviously accurate. / will not leave this house without the keystone,
he vowed. / will not fail the bishop and the teacher.

checking the thirteen-round clip in his heckler koch, silas pushed it through the bars and let it fall
onto the mossy ground inside the compound. then, gripping the top of the fence, he heaved
himself up and over, dropping to the ground on the other side. ignoring the slash of pain from his
cilice, silas retrieved his gun and began the long trek up the grassy slope.



chapter 58

teabing's "study" was like no study sophie had ever seen. six or seven times larger than even the
most luxurious of office spaces, the knight's cabinet de travail resembled an ungainly hybrid of
science laboratory, archival library, and indoor flea market. lit by three overhead chandeliers, the
boundless tile floor was dotted with clustered islands of worktables buried beneath books, artwork,
artifacts, and a surprising amount of electronic gear — computers, projectors, microscopes, copy
machines, and flatbed scanners.

"i converted the ballroom," teabing said, looking sheepish as he shuffled into the room. "i have
little occasion to dance. "

sophie felt as if the entire night had become some kind of twilight zone where nothing was as she
expected. "this is all for your work?"

"learning the truth has become my life's love," teabing said. "and the sangreal is my favorite
mistress."



the holy grail is a woman, sophie thought, her mind a collage of interrelated ideas that seemed to
make no sense. "you said you have a picture of this woman who you claim is the holy grail."

"yes, but it is not i who claim she is the grail. christ himself made that claim."

"which one is the painting?" sophie asked, scanning the walls.

"hmmm..." teabing made a show of seeming to have forgotten. "the holy grail. the sangreal.
the chalice." he wheeled suddenly and pointed to the far wall. on it hung an eight-foot-long print
of the last supper, the same exact image sophie had just been looking at. "there she is!"

sophie was certain she had missed something. "that's the same painting you just showed me."

he winked. "i know, but the enlargement is so much more exciting. don't you think?"

sophie turned to langdon for help. "i'm lost."

langdon smiled. "as it turns out, the holy grail does indeed make an appearance in the last
supper. leonardo included her prominently."

"hold on," sophie said. "you told me the holy grail is a woman. the last supper is a painting of
thirteen men."

"is it?" teabing arched his eyebrows. "take a closer look."

uncertain, sophie made her way closer to the painting, scanning the thirteen figures — jesus christ
in the middle, six disciples on his left, and six on his right. "they're all men," she confirmed.



"oh?" teabing said. "how about the one seated in the place of honor, at the right hand of the
lord?"

sophie examined the figure to jesus' immediate right, focusing in. as she studied the person's face
and body, a wave of astonishment rose within her. the individual had flowing red hair, delicate
folded hands, and the hint of a bosom. it was, without a doubt... female.

"that's a woman!" sophie exclaimed.

teabing was laughing. "surprise, surprise. believe me, it's no mistake. leonardo was skilled at
painting the difference between the sexes."

sophie could not take her eyes from the woman beside christ. the last supper is supposed to be
thirteen men. who is this woman? although sophie had seen this classic image many times, she



had not once noticed this glaring discrepancy.

"everyone misses it," teabing said. "our preconceived notions of this scene are so powerful that
our mind blocks out the incongruity and overrides our eyes."

"it's known as skitoma, " langdon added. "the brain does it sometimes with powerful symbols."

"another reason you might have missed the woman," teabing said, "is that many of the
photographs in art books were taken before 1954, when the details were still hidden beneath layers
of grime and several restorative repaintings done by clumsy hands in the eighteenth century. now,
at last, the fresco has been cleaned down to da vinci's original layer of paint." he motioned to the
photograph. "etvoilaf"

sophie moved closer to the image. the woman to jesus' right was young and pious-looking, with a
demure face, beautiful red hair, and hands folded quietly. this is the woman who singlehandedly
could crumble the church?

"who is she?" sophie asked.

"that, my dear," teabing replied, "is mary magdalene."

sophie turned. "the prostitute?"

teabing drew a short breath, as if the word had injured him personally. "magdalene was no such
thing. that unfortunate misconception is the legacy of a smear campaign launched by the early
church. the church needed to defame mary magdalene in order to cover up her dangerous
secret — her role as the holy grail."

"herro/e?"

"as i mentioned," teabing clarified, "the early church needed to convince the world that the
mortal prophet jesus was a divine being. therefore, any gospels that described earthly aspects of
jesus' life had to be omitted from the bible. unfortunately for the early editors, one particularly
troubling earthly theme kept recurring in the gospels. mary magdalene." he paused. "more
specifically, her marriage to jesus christ."

"i beg your pardon?" sophie's eyes moved to langdon and then back to teabing.

"it's a matter of historical record," teabing said, "and da vinci was certainly aware of that fact.
the last supper practically shouts at the viewer that jesus and magdalene were a pair. "

sophie glanced back to the fresco.



"notice that jesus and magdalene are clothed as mirror images of one another." teabing pointed to
the two individuals in the center of the fresco.

sophie was mesmerized. sure enough, their clothes were inverse colors. jesus wore a red robe and
blue cloak; mary magdalene wore a blue robe and red cloak. yin and yang.

"venturing into the more bizarre," teabing said, "note that jesus and his bride appear to be joined
at the hip and are leaning away from one another as if to create this clearly delineated negative
space between them."

even before teabing traced the contour for her, sophie saw it — the indisputable v shape at the
focal point of the painting. it was the same symbol langdon had drawn earlier for the grail, the
chalice, and the female womb.

"finally," teabing said, "if you view jesus and magdalene as compositional elements rather than
as people, you will see another obvious shape leap out at you." he paused. "a letter of the
alphabet."

sophie saw it at once. to say the letter leapt out at her was an understatement. the letter was
suddenly all sophie could see. glaring in the center of the painting was the unquestionable outline
of an enormous, flawlessly formed letter m.

"a bit too perfect for coincidence, wouldn't you say?" teabing asked.

sophie was amazed. "why is it there?"

teabing shrugged. "conspiracy theorists will tell you it stands for matrimonio or mary magdalene.
to be honest, nobody is certain. the only certainty is that the hidden m is no mistake. countless
grail-related works contain the hidden letter m — whether as watermarks, underpaintings, or
compositional allusions. the most blatant m, of course, is emblazoned on the altar at our lady of
paris in london, which was designed by a former grand master of the priory of sion, jean
cocteau."

sophie weighed the information. "i'll admit, the hidden m's are intriguing, although i assume
nobody is claiming they are proof of jesus' marriage to magdalene."

"no, no," teabing said, going to a nearby table of books. "as i said earlier, the marriage of jesus
and mary magdalene is part of the historical record. " he began pawing through his book
collection. "moreover, jesus as a married man makes infinitely more sense than our standard
biblical view of jesus as a bachelor. "

"why?" sophie asked.



"because jesus was a jew," langdon said, taking over while teabing searched for his book, "and
the social decorum during that time virtually forbid a jewish man to be unmarried. according to
jewish custom, celibacy was condemned, and the obligation for a jewish father was to find a
suitable wife for his son. if jesus were not married, at least one of the bible's gospels would have
mentioned it and offered some explanation for his unnatural state of bachelorhood."

teabing located a huge book and pulled it toward him across the table. the leather-bound edition
was poster-sized, like a huge atlas. the cover read: the gnostic gospels. teabing heaved it open,
and langdon and sophie joined him. sophie could see it contained photographs of what appeared
to be magnified passages of ancient documents — tattered papyrus with handwritten text. she did
not recognize the ancient language, but the facing pages bore typed translations.

"these are photocopies of the nag hammadi and dead sea scrolls, which i mentioned earlier,"
teabing said. "the earliest christian records. troublingly, they do not match up with the gospels in
the bible." flipping toward the middle of the book, teabing pointed to a passage. "the gospel of
philip is always a good place to start." sophie read the passage:

and the companion of the saviour is mary magdalene. christ loved her more than
all the disciples and used to kiss her often on her mouth. the rest of the disciples
were offended by it and expressed disapproval. they said to him, "why do you love
her more than all of us?"

the words surprised sophie, and yet they hardly seemed conclusive. "it says nothing of marriage."

"au contraire. " teabing smiled, pointing to the first line. "as any aramaic scholar will tell you,
the word companion, in those days, literally meant spouse. "

langdon concurred with a nod.

sophie read the first line again. and the companion of the saviour is mary magdalene.

teabing flipped through the book and pointed out several other passages that, to sophie's surprise,
clearly suggested magdalene and jesus had a romantic relationship. as she read the passages,
sophie recalled an angry priest who had banged on her grandfather's door when she was a
schoolgirl.

"is this the home of jacques sauniere?" the priest had demanded, glaring down at young sophie
when she pulled open the door. "i want to talk to him about this editorial he wrote." the priest held
up a newspaper.

sophie summoned her grandfather, and the two men disappeared into his study and closed the
door. my grandfather wrote something in the paper? sophie immediately ran to the kitchen and
flipped through that morning's paper. she found her grandfather's name on an article on the second



page. she read it. sophie didn't understand all of what was said, but it sounded like the french
government, under pressure from priests, had agreed to ban an american movie called the last
temptation of christ, which was about jesus having sex with a lady called mary magdalene. her
grandfather's article said the church was arrogant and wrong to ban it.

no wonder the priest is mad, sophie thought.

"it's pornography! sacrilege!" the priest yelled, emerging from the study and storming to the front
door. "how can you possibly endorse that! this american martin scorsese is a blasphemer, and
the church will permit him no pulpit in france ! " the priest slammed the door on his way out.

when her grandfather came into the kitchen, he saw sophie with the paper and frowned. "you're
quick."

sophie said, "you think jesus christ had a girlfriend?"

"no, dear, i said the church should not be allowed to tell us what notions we can and can't
entertain. "

"did jesus have a girlfriend?"

her grandfather was silent for several moments. "would it be so bad if he did?"

sophie considered it and then shrugged. "i wouldn't mind."



sir leigh teabing was still talking. "i shan't bore you with the countless references to jesus and
magdalene's union. that has been explored ad nauseum by modern historians. i would, however,
like to point out the following." he motioned to another passage. "this is from the gospel of mary
magdalene."

sophie had not known a gospel existed in magdalene's words. she read the text:

and peter said, "did the saviour really speak with a woman without our knowledge ?
are we to turn about and all listen to her? did he prefer her to us?"

and levi answered, "peter, you have always been hot-tempered. now i see you
contending against the woman like an adversary. if the saviour made her worthy,
who are you indeed to reject her? surely the saviour knows her very well. that is
why he loved her more than us. "

"the woman they are speaking of," teabing explained, "is mary magdalene. peter is jealous of



her."

"because jesus preferred mary?"

"not only that. the stakes were far greater than mere affection. at this point in the gospels, jesus
suspects he will soon be captured and crucified. so he gives mary magdalene instructions on how
to carry on his church after he is gone. as a result, peter expresses his discontent over playing
second fiddle to a woman. i daresay peter was something of a sexist."

sophie was trying to keep up. "this is saint peter. the rock on which jesus built his church."

"the same, except for one catch. according to these unaltered gospels, it was not peter to whom
christ gave directions with which to establish the christian church. it was mary magdalene. "

sophie looked at him. "you're saying the christian church was to be carried on by a woman?"

"that was the plan. jesus was the original feminist. he intended for the future of his church to be
in the hands of mary magdalene."

"and peter had a problem with that," langdon said, pointing to the last supper. "that's peter
there. you can see that da vinci was well aware of how peter felt about mary magdalene."

again, sophie was speechless. in the painting, peter was leaning menacingly toward mary
magdalene and slicing his blade-like hand across her neck. the same threatening gesture as in
madonna of the rocks!

"and here too," langdon said, pointing now to the crowd of disciples near peter. "a bit ominous,
no?"

sophie squinted and saw a hand emerging from the crowd of disciples. "is that hand wielding a
dagger?"

"yes. stranger still, if you count the arms, you'll see that this hand belongs to... no one at all. it's
disembodied. anonymous."

sophie was starting to feel overwhelmed. "i'm sorry, i still don't understand how all of this makes
mary magdalene the holy grail."

"aha!" teabing exclaimed again. "therein lies the rub!" he turned once more to the table and
pulled out a large chart, spreading it out for her. it was an elaborate genealogy. "few people realize
that mary magdalene, in addition to being christ's right hand, was a powerful woman already."

sophie could now see the title of the family tree.



the tribe of benjamin

"mary magdalene is here," teabing said, pointing near the top of the genealogy.

sophie was surprised. "she was of the house of benjamin?"

"indeed," teabing said. "mary magdalene was of royal descent."

"but i was under the impression magdalene was poor."

teabing shook his head. "magdalene was recast as a whore in order to erase evidence of her
powerful family ties."

sophie found herself again glancing at langdon, who again nodded. she turned back to teabing.
"but why would the early church care if magdalene had royal blood?"

the briton smiled. "my dear child, it was not mary magdalene's royal blood that concerned the
church so much as it was her consorting with christ, who also had royal blood. as you know, the
book of matthew tells us that jesus was of the house of david. a descendant of king
solomon — king of the jews. by marrying into the powerful house of benjamin, jesus fused two
royal bloodlines, creating a potent political union with the potential of making a legitimate claim to
the throne and restoring the line of kings as it was under solomon."

sophie sensed he was at last coming to his point.

teabing looked excited now. "the legend of the holy grail is a legend about royal blood. when
grail legend speaks of 'the chalice that held the blood of christ'... it speaks, in fact, of mary
magdalene — the female womb that carried jesus' royal bloodline."

the words seemed to echo across the ballroom and back before they fully registered in sophie's
mind. mary magdalene carried the royal bloodline of jesus christ? "but how could christ have a
bloodline unless...?" she paused and looked at langdon.

langdon smiled softly. "unless they had a child."

sophie stood transfixed.

"behold," teabing proclaimed, "the greatest cover-up in human history. not only was jesus christ
married, but he was a father. my dear, mary magdalene was the holy vessel. she was the chalice
that bore the royal bloodline of jesus christ. she was the womb that bore the lineage, and the vine
from which the sacred fruit sprang forth!"



sophie felt the hairs stand up on her arms. "but how could a secret that big be kept quiet all of
these years?"

"heavens!" teabing said. "it has been anything but quiet! the royal bloodline of jesus christ is the
source of the most enduring legend of all time — the holy grail. magdalene's story has been
shouted from the rooftops for centuries in all kinds of metaphors and languages. her story is
everywhere once you open your eyes."

"and the sangreal documents?" sophie said. "they allegedly contain proof that jesus had a royal
bloodline?"

"they do."

"so the entire holy grail legend is all about royal blood?"

"quite literally," teabing said. "the word sangreal derives from san great — or holy grail. but in
its most ancient form, the word sangreal was divided in a different spot." teabing wrote on a piece
of scrap paper and handed it to her.

she read what he had written.

sang real

instantly, sophie recognized the translation. sang real literally meant royal blood.



chapter 59

the male receptionist in the lobby of the opus dei headquarters on lexington avenue in new
york city was surprised to hear bishop aringarosa's voice on the line. "good evening, sir."

"have i had any messages?" the bishop demanded, sounding unusually anxious.

"yes, sir. i'm very glad you called in. i couldn't reach you in your apartment. you had an urgent
phone message about half an hour ago."



"yes?" he sounded relieved by the news. "did the caller leave a name?"
"no, sir, just a number." the operator relayed the number.



"prefix thirty-three? that's france, am i right?"

"yes, sir. paris. the caller said it was critical you contact him immediately."

"thank you. i have been waiting for that call." aringarosa quickly severed the connection.

as the receptionist hung up the receiver, he wondered why aringarosa's phone connection sounded
so crackly. the bishop's daily schedule showed him in new york this weekend, and yet he
sounded a world away. the receptionist shrugged it off. bishop aringarosa had been acting very
strangely the last few months.



my cellular phone must not have been receiving, aringarosa thought as the fiat approached the
exit for rome's ciampino charter airport. the teacher was trying to reach me. despite
aringarosa's concern at having missed the call, he felt encouraged that the teacher felt confident
enough to call opus dei headquarters directly.

things must have gone well in paris tonight.

as aringarosa began dialing the number, he felt excited to know he would soon be in paris. i'll be
on the ground before dawn. aringarosa had a chartered turbo prop awaiting him here for the short
flight to france. commercial carriers were not an option at this hour, especially considering the
contents of his briefcase.

the line began to ring.

a female voice answered. "direction centrale police judidaire. "

aringarosa felt himself hesitate. this was unexpected. "ah, yes... i was asked to call this number?"

"qui etes-vous?" the woman said. "your name?"

aringarosa was uncertain if he should reveal it. the french judicial police ?

"your name, monsieur?" the woman pressed.

"bishop manuel aringarosa."

"un moment. " there was a click on the line.

after a long wait, another man came on, his tone gruff and concerned. "bishop, i am glad i finally
reached you. you and i have much to discuss."



chapter 60

sangreal... sang real... san great.. . royal blood... holy grail.

it was all intertwined.

the holy grail is mary magdalene... the mother of the royal bloodline of jesus christ. sophie felt
a new wave of disorientation as she stood in the silence of the ballroom and stared at robert
langdon. the more pieces langdon and teabing laid on the table tonight, the more unpredictable
this puzzle became.

"as you can see, my dear," teabing said, hobbling toward a bookshelf, "leonardo is not the only
one who has been trying to tell the world the truth about the holy grail. the royal bloodline of
jesus christ has been chronicled in exhaustive detail by scores of historians." he ran a finger down
a row of several dozen books.

sophie tilted her head and scanned the list of titles:

the templar revelation:

secret guardians of the true identity of christ

the woman with the alabaster jar:

mary magdalene and the holy grail

the goddess in the gospels
reclaiming the sacred feminine



"here is perhaps the best-known tome," teabing said, pulling a tattered hardcover from the stack
and handing it to her. the cover read:

holy blood, holy grail

the acclaimed international bestseller



sophie glanced up. "an international bestseller? i've never heard of it."

"you were young. this caused quite a stir back in the nineteen eighties. to my taste, the authors
made some dubious leaps of faith in their analysis, but their fundamental premise is sound, and to
their credit, they finally brought the idea of christ's bloodline into the mainstream."



"what was the church's reaction to the book?"

"outrage, of course. but that was to be expected. after all, this was a secret the vatican had tried to
bury in the fourth century. that's part of what the crusades were about. gathering and destroying
information. the threat mary magdalene posed to the men of the early church was potentially
ruinous. not only was she the woman to whom jesus had assigned the task of founding the church,
but she also had physical proof that the church's newly proclaimed deity had spawned a mortal
bloodline. the church, in order to defend itself against the magdalene's power, perpetuated her
image as a whore and buried evidence of christ's marriage to her, thereby defusing any potential
claims that christ had a surviving bloodline and was a mortal prophet."

sophie glanced at langdon, who nodded. "sophie, the historical evidence supporting this is
substantial."

"i admit," teabing said, "the assertions are dire, but you must understand the church's powerful
motivations to conduct such a cover-up. they could never have survived public knowledge of a
bloodline. a child of jesus would undermine the critical notion of christ's divinity and therefore
the christian church, which declared itself the sole vessel through which humanity could access
the divine and gain entrance to the kingdom of heaven."

"the five-petal rose," sophie said, pointing suddenly to the spine of one of teabing's books. the
same exact design inlaid on the rosewood box.

teabing glanced at langdon and grinned. "she has a good eye." he turned back to sophie. "that is
the priory symbol for the grail. mary magdalene. because her name was forbidden by the church,
mary magdalene became secretly known by many pseudonyms — the chalice, the holy grail, and
the rose." he paused. "the rose has ties to the five-pointed pentacle of venus and the guiding
compass rose. by the way, the word rose is identical in english, french, german, and many other
languages."

"rose," langdon added, "is also an anagram of eros, the greek god of sexual love."

sophie gave him a surprised look as teabing plowed on.

"the rose has always been the premiere symbol of female sexuality. in primitive goddess cults,
the five petals represented the five stations of female life — birth, menstruation, motherhood,
menopause, and death. and in modern times, the flowering rose's ties to womanhood are
considered more visual." he glanced at robert. "perhaps the symbologist could explain?"

robert hesitated. a moment too long.

"oh, heavens!" teabing huffed. "you americans are such prudes." he looked back at sophie.



"what robert is fumbling with is the fact that the blossoming flower resembles the female
genitalia, the sublime blossom from which all mankind enters the world. and if you've ever seen
any paintings by georgia o'keeffe, you'll know exactly what i mean. "

"the point here," langdon said, motioning back to the bookshelf, "is that all of these books
substantiate the same historical claim."

"that jesus was a father." sophie was still uncertain.

"yes," teabing said. "and that mary magdalene was the womb that carried his royal lineage. the
priory of sion, to this day, still worships mary magdalene as the goddess, the holy grail, the
rose, and the divine mother."

sophie again flashed on the ritual in the basement.

"according to the priory," teabing continued, "mary magdalene was pregnant at the time of the
crucifixion. for the safety of christ's unborn child, she had no choice but to flee the holy land.
with the help of jesus' trusted uncle, joseph of arimathea, mary magdalene secretly traveled to
france, then known as gaul. there she found safe refuge in the jewish community. it was here in
france that she gave birth to a daughter. her name was sarah."

sophie glanced up. "they actually know the child's name?"

"far more than that. magdalene's and sarah's lives were scrutinously chronicled by their jewish
protectors. remember that magdalene's child belonged to the lineage of jewish kings — david and
solomon. for this reason, the jews in france considered magdalene sacred royalty and revered her
as the progenitor of the royal line of kings. countless scholars of that era chronicled mary
magdalene's days in france, including the birth of sarah and the subsequent family tree."

sophie was startled. "there exists a family tree of jesus christ?"

"indeed. and it is purportedly one of the cornerstones of the sangreal documents. a complete
genealogy of the early descendants of christ."

"but what good is a documented genealogy of christ's bloodline?" sophie asked. "it's not proof.
historians could not possibly confirm its authenticity."

teabing chuckled. "no more so than they can confirm the authenticity of the bible. "

"meaning?"

"meaning that history is always written by the winners. when two cultures clash, the loser is
obliterated, and the winner writes the history books — books which glorify their own cause and



disparage the conquered foe. as napoleon once said, 'what is history, but a fable agreed upon?' "
he smiled. "by its very nature, history is always a one-sided account."

sophie had never thought of it that way.

"the sangreal documents simply tell the other side of the christ story. in the end, which side of the
story you believe becomes a matter of faith and personal exploration, but at least the information
has survived. the sangreal documents include tens of thousands of pages of information.
eyewitness accounts of the sangreal treasure describe it as being carried in four enormous trunks.
in those trunks are reputed to be the purist documents — thousands of pages of unaltered, pre-
constantine documents, written by the early followers of jesus, revering him as a wholly human
teacher and prophet. also rumored to be part of the treasure is the legendary "q" document — a
manuscript that even the vatican admits they believe exists. allegedly, it is a book of jesus'
teachings, possibly written in his own hand."

"writings by christ himself?"

"of course," teabing said. "why wouldn't jesus have kept a chronicle of his ministry? most
people did in those days. another explosive document believed to be in the treasure is a manuscript
called the magdalene diaries — mary magdalene's personal account of her relationship with
christ, his crucifixion, and her time in france."

sophie was silent for a long moment. "and these four chests of documents were the treasure that
the knights templar found under solomon's temple?"

"exactly. the documents that made the knights so powerful. the documents that have been the
object of countless grail quests throughout history."

"but you said the holy grail was mary magdalene. if people are searching for documents, why
would you call it a search for the holy grail?"

teabing eyed her, his expression softening. "because the hiding place of the holy grail includes a
sarcophagus."

outside, the wind howled in the trees.

teabing spoke more quietly now. "the quest for the holy grail is literally the quest to kneel before
the bones of mary magdalene. a journey to pray at the feet of the outcast one, the lost sacred
feminine."

sophie felt an unexpected wonder. "the hiding place of the holy grail is actually... a tomb?"

teabing's hazel eyes got misty. "it is. a tomb containing the body of mary magdalene and the



documents that tell the true story of her life. at its heart, the quest for the holy grail has always
been a quest for the magdalene — the wronged queen, entombed with proof of her family's rightful
claim to power. "

sophie waited a moment as teabing gathered himself. so much about her grandfather was still not
making sense. "members of the priory," she finally said, "all these years have answered the charge
of protecting the sangreal documents and the tomb of mary magdalene?"

"yes, but the brotherhood had another, more important duty as well — to protect the bloodline itself.
christ's lineage was in perpetual danger. the early church feared that if the lineage were permitted
to grow, the secret of jesus and magdalene would eventually surface and challenge the
fundamental catholic doctrine — that of a divine messiah who did not consort with women or
engage in sexual union." he paused. "nonetheless, christ's line grew quietly under cover in france
until making a bold move in the fifth century, when it intermarried with french royal blood and
created a lineage known as the merovingian bloodline. "

this news surprised sophie. merovingian was a term learned by every student in france. "the
merovingians founded paris."

"yes. that's one of the reasons the grail legend is so rich in france. many of the vatican's grail
quests here were in fact stealth missions to erase members of the royal bloodline. have you heard
of king dagobert?"

sophie vaguely recalled the name from a grisly tale in history class. "dagobert was a merovingian
king, wasn't he? stabbed in the eye while sleeping?"

"exactly. assassinated by the vatican in collusion with pepin d'heristal. late seventh century.
with dagobert's murder, the merovingian bloodline was almost exterminated. fortunately,
dagobert's son, sigisbert, secretly escaped the attack and carried on the lineage, which later
included godefroi de bouillon — founder of the priory of sion."

"the same man," langdon said, "who ordered the knights templar to recover the sangreal
documents from beneath solomon's temple and thus provide the merovingians proof of their
hereditary ties to jesus christ."

teabing nodded, heaving a ponderous sigh. "the modern priory of sion has a momentous duty.
theirs is a threefold charge. the brotherhood must protect the sangreal documents. they must
protect the tomb of mary magdalene. and, of course, they must nurture and protect the bloodline
of christ — those few members of the royal merovingian bloodline who have survived into modern
times."

the words hung in the huge space, and sophie felt an odd vibration, as if her bones were
reverberating with some new kind of truth. descendants of jesus who survived into modern times.



her grandfather's voice again was whispering in her ear. princess, i must tell you the truth about
your family.

a chill raked her flesh.

royal blood.

she could not imagine.

princess sophie.

"sir leigh?" the manservant's words crackled through the intercom on the wall, and sophie
jumped. "if you could join me in the kitchen a moment?"

teabing scowled at the ill-timed intrusion. he went over to the intercom and pressed the button.
"remy, as you know, i am busy with my guests. if we need anything else from the kitchen tonight,
we will help ourselves. thank you and good night."

"a word with you before i retire, sir. if you would."

teabing grunted and pressed the button. "make it quick, remy."

"it is a household matter, sir, hardly fare for guests to endure."

teabing looked incredulous. "and it cannot wait until morning?"

"no, sir. my question won't take a minute."

teabing rolled his eyes and looked at langdon and sophie. "sometimes i wonder who is serving
whom?" he pressed the button again. "i'll be right there, remy. can i bring you anything when i
come?"

"only freedom from oppression, sir."

"remy, you realize your steak au poivre is the only reason you still work for me."

"so you tell me, sir. so you tell me."



chapter 61

princess sophie.



sophie felt hollow as she listened to the clicking of teabing's crutches fade down the hallway.
numb, she turned and faced langdon in the deserted ballroom. he was already shaking his head as
if reading her mind.

"no, sophie," he whispered, his eyes reassuring. "the same thought crossed my mind when i
realized your grandfather was in the priory, and you said he wanted to tell you a secret about your
family. but it's impossible." langdon paused. "sauniere is not a merovingian name."

sophie wasn't sure whether to feel relieved or disappointed. earlier, langdon had asked an unusual
passing question about sophie's mother's maiden name. chauvel. the question now made sense.
"and chauvel?" she asked, anxious.

again he shook his head. "i'm sorry. i know that would have answered some questions for you.
only two direct lines of merovingians remain. their family names are plantard and saint-clair.
both families live in hiding, probably protected by the priory."

sophie repeated the names silently in her mind and then shook her head. there was no one in her
family named plantard or saint-clair. a weary undertow was pulling at her now. she realized she
was no closer than she had been at the louvre to understanding what truth her grandfather had
wanted to reveal to her. sophie wished her grandfather had never mentioned her family this
afternoon. he had torn open old wounds that felt as painful now as ever. they are dead, sophie.
they are not coming back. she thought of her mother singing her to sleep at night, of her father
giving her rides on his shoulders, and of her grandmother and younger brother smiling at her with
their fervent green eyes. all that was stolen. and all she had left was her grandfather.

and now he is gone too. i am alone.

sophie turned quietly back to the last supper and gazed at mary magdalene's long red hair and
quiet eyes. there was something in the woman's expression that echoed the loss of a loved one.
sophie could feel it too.

"robert?" she said softly.

he stepped closer.

"i know leigh said the grail story is all around us, but tonight is the first time i've ever heard any
of this."

langdon looked as if he wanted to put a comforting hand on her shoulder, but he refrained.
"you've heard her story before, sophie. everyone has. we just don't realize it when we hear it."

"i don't understand."



"the grail story is everywhere, but it is hidden. when the church outlawed speaking of the
shunned mary magdalene, her story and importance had to be passed on through more discreet
channels... channels that supported metaphor and symbolism."

"of course. the arts."

langdon motioned to the last supper. "a perfect example. some of today's most enduring art,
literature, and music secretly tell the history of mary magdalene and jesus."

langdon quickly told her about works by da vinci, botticelli, poussin, bernini, mozart, and
victor hugo that all whispered of the quest to restore the banished sacred feminine. enduring
legends like sir gawain and the green knight, king arthur, and sleeping beauty were grail
allegories. victor hugo's hunchback of notre dame and mozart's magic flute were filled with
masonic symbolism and grail secrets.

"once you open your eyes to the holy grail," langdon said, "you see her everywhere. paintings.
music. books. even in cartoons, theme parks, and popular movies."

langdon held up his mickey mouse watch and told her that walt disney had made it his quiet
life's work to pass on the grail story to future generations. throughout his entire life, disney had
been hailed as "the modern-day leonardo da vinci." both men were generations ahead of their
times, uniquely gifted artists, members of secret societies, and, most notably, avid pranksters. like
leonardo, walt disney loved infusing hidden messages and symbolism in his art. for the trained
symbologist, watching an early disney movie was like being barraged by an avalanche of allusion
and metaphor.

most of disney's hidden messages dealt with religion, pagan myth, and stories of the subjugated
goddess. it was no mistake that disney retold tales like cinderella, sleeping beauty, and snow
white — all of which dealt with the incarceration of the sacred feminine. nor did one need a
background in symbolism to understand that snow white — a princess who fell from grace after
partaking of a poisoned apple — was a clear allusion to the downfall of eve in the garden of eden.
or that sleeping beauty's princess aurora — code-named "rose" and hidden deep in the forest to
protect her from the clutches of the evil witch — was the grail story for children.

despite its corporate image, disney still had a savvy, playful element among its employees, and
their artists still amused themselves by inserting hidden symbolism in disney products. langdon
would never forget one of his students bringing in a dvd of the lion king and pausing the film to
reveal a freeze-frame in which the word sex was clearly visible, spelled out by floating dust
particles over simba's head. although langdon suspected this was more of a cartoonist's
sophomoric prank than any kind of enlightened allusion to pagan human sexuality, he had learned
not to underestimate disney's grasp of symbolism. the little mermaid was a spellbinding tapestry
of spiritual symbols so specifically goddess-related that they could not be coincidence.



when langdon had first seen the little mermaid, he had actually gasped aloud when he noticed
that the painting in ariel's underwater home was none other than seventeenth-century artist
georges de la tour's the penitent magdalene — a famous homage to the banished mary
magdalene — fitting decor considering the movie turned out to be a ninety-minute collage of blatant
symbolic references to the lost sanctity of isis, eve, pisces the fish goddess, and, repeatedly, mary
magdalene. the little mermaid's name, ariel, possessed powerful ties to the sacred feminine and,
in the book of isaiah, was synonymous with "the holy city besieged." of course, the little
mermaid's flowing red hair was certainly no coincidence either.

the clicking of teabing's crutches approached in the hallway, his pace unusually brisk. when their
host entered the study, his expression was stern.

"you'd better explain yourself, robert," he said coldly. "you have not been honest with me."



chapter 62

"i'm being framed, leigh," langdon said, trying to stay calm. you know me. i wouldn't kill anyone.

teabing's tone did not soften. "robert, you're on television, for christ's sake. did you know you
were wanted by the authorities?"

"yes."

"then you abused my trust. i'm astonished you would put me at risk by coming here and asking me
to ramble on about the grail so you could hide out in my home."

"i didn't kill anyone."

"jacques sauniere is dead, and the police say you did it." teabing looked saddened. "such a
contributor to the arts..."

"sir?" the manservant had appeared now, standing behind teabing in the study doorway, his arms
crossed. "shall i show them out?"

"allow me." teabing hobbled across the study, unlocked a set of wide glass doors, and swung
them open onto a side lawn. "please find your car, and leave."

sophie did not move. "we have information about the clef de voute. the priory keystone. "

teabing stared at her for several seconds and scoffed derisively. "a desperate ploy. robert knows



how i've sought it. "

"she's telling the truth," langdon said. "that's why we came to you tonight. to talk to you about
the keystone. "

the manservant intervened now. "leave, or i shall call the authorities."

"leigh," langdon whispered, "we know where it is."

teabing's balance seemed to falter a bit.

remy now marched stiffly across the room. "leave at once! or i will forcibly — "

"remy!" teabing spun, snapping at his servant. "excuse us for a moment."

the servant's jaw dropped. "sir? i must protest. these people are — "

"i'll handle this." teabing pointed to the hallway.

after a moment of stunned silence, remy skulked out like a banished dog.

in the cool night breeze coming through the open doors, teabing turned back to sophie and
langdon, his expression still wary. "this better be good. what do you know of the keystone?"



in the thick brush outside teabing's study, silas clutched his pistol and gazed through the glass
doors. only moments ago, he had circled the house and seen langdon and the woman talking in
the large study. before he could move in, a man on crutches entered, yelled at langdon, threw
open the doors, and demanded his guests leave. then the woman mentioned the keystone, and
everything changed. shouts turned to whispers. moods softened. and the glass doors were quickly
closed.

now, as he huddled in the shadows, silas peered through the glass. the keystone is somewhere
inside the house. silas could feel it.

staying in the shadows, he inched closer to the glass, eager to hear what was being said. he would
give them five minutes. if they did not reveal where they had placed the keystone, silas would
have to enter and persuade them with force.



inside the study, langdon could sense their host's bewilderment.



"grand master?" teabing choked, eyeing sophie. "jacques sauniere?"

sophie nodded, seeing the shock in his eyes.

"but you could not possibly know that!"

"jacques sauniere was my grandfather."

teabing staggered back on his crutches, shooting a glance at langdon, who nodded. teabing
turned back to sophie. "miss neveu, i am speechless. if this is true, then i am truly sorry for your
loss. i should admit, for my research, i have kept lists of men in paris whom i thought might be
good candidates for involvement in the priory. jacques sauniere was on that list along with many
others. but grand master, you say? it's hard to fathom." teabing was silent a moment and then
shook his head. "but it still makes no sense. even if your grandfather were the priory grand master
and created the keystone himself, he would never tell you how to find it. the keystone reveals the
pathway to the brotherhood's ultimate treasure. granddaughter or not, you are not eligible to
receive such knowledge."

"mr. sauniere was dying when he passed on the information," langdon said. "he had limited
options."

"he didn't need options," teabing argued. "there exist three senechaux who also know the secret.
that is the beauty of their system. one will rise to grand master and they will induct a new
senechal and share the secret of the keystone."

"i guess you didn't see the entire news broadcast," sophie said. "in addition to my grandfather,
three other prominent parisians were murdered today. all in similar ways. all looked like they had
been interrogated."

teabing's jaw fell. "and you think they were..."

"the senechaux, " langdon said.

"but how? a murderer could not possibly learn the identities of all four top members of the priory
of sion! look at me, i have been researching them for decades, and i can't even name one priory
member. it seems inconceivable that all three senechaux and the grand master could be discovered
and killed in one day. "

"i doubt the information was gathered in a single day," sophie said. "it sounds like a well-planned
decapiter. it's a technique we use to fight organized crime syndicates. if dcpj wants to move on a
certain group, they will silently listen and watch for months, identify all the main players, and then
move in and take them all at the same moment. decapitation. with no leadership, the group falls
into chaos and divulges other information. it's possible someone patiently watched the priory and



then attacked, hoping the top people would reveal the location of the keystone."

teabing looked unconvinced. "but the brothers would never talk. they are sworn to secrecy. even
in the face of death."

"exactly," langdon said. "meaning, if they never divulged the secret, and they were killed..."

teabing gasped. "then the location of the keystone would be lost forever!"

"and with it," langdon said, "the location of the holy grail."

teabing's body seemed to sway with the weight of langdon's words. then, as if too tired to stand
another moment, he flopped in a chair and stared out the window.

sophie walked over, her voice soft. "considering my grandfather's predicament, it seems possible
that in total desperation he tried to pass the secret on to someone outside the brotherhood. someone
he thought he could trust. someone in his family."

teabing was pale. "but someone capable of such an attack... of discovering so much about the
brotherhood..." he paused, radiating a new fear. "it could only be one force. this kind of
infiltration could only have come from the priory's oldest enemy."

langdon glanced up. "the church."

"who else? rome has been seeking the grail for centuries."

sophie was skeptical. "you think the church killed my grandfather?"

teabing replied, "it would not be the first time in history the church has killed to protect itself. the
documents that accompany the holy grail are explosive, and the church has wanted to destroy
them for years."

langdon was having trouble buying teabing's premise that the church would blatantly murder
people to obtain these documents. having met the new pope and many of the cardinals, langdon
knew they were deeply spiritual men who would never condone assassination. regardless of the
stakes.

sophie seemed to be having similar thoughts. "isn't it possible that these priory members were
murdered by someone outside the church? someone who didn't understand what the grail really
is? the cup of christ, after all, would be quite an enticing treasure. certainly treasure hunters have
killed for less."

"in my experience," teabing said, "men go to far greater lengths to avoid what they fear than to



obtain what they desire. i sense a desperation in this assault on the priory."

"leigh," langdon said, "the argument is paradoxical. why would members of the catholic clergy
murder priory members in an effort to find and destroy documents they believe are false testimony
anyway?"

teabing chuckled. "the ivory towers of harvard have made you soft, robert. yes, the clergy in
rome are blessed with potent faith, and because of this, their beliefs can weather any storm,
including documents that contradict everything they hold dear. but what about the rest of the
world? what about those who are not blessed with absolute certainty? what about those who look
at the cruelty in the world and say, where is god today? those who look at church scandals and
ask, who are these men who claim to speak the truth about christ and yet lie to cover up the sexual
abuse of children by their own priests?" teabing paused. "what happens to those people, robert, if
persuasive scientific evidence comes out that the church's version of the christ story is inaccurate,
and that the greatest story ever told is, in fact, the greatest story ever sold"

langdon did not respond.

"i'll tell you what happens if the documents get out," teabing said. "the vatican faces a crisis of
faith unprecedented in its two-millennia history."

after a long silence, sophie said, "but if it is the church who is responsible for this attack, why
would they act now? after all these years? the priory keeps the sangreal documents hidden. they
pose no immediate threat to the church."

teabing heaved an ominous sigh and glanced at langdon. "robert, i assume you are familiar with
the priory's final charge?"

langdon felt his breath catch at the thought. "i am."

"miss neveu," teabing said, "the church and the priory have had a tacit understanding for years.
that is, the church does not attack the priory, and the priory keeps the sangreal documents
hidden." he paused. "however, part of the priory history has always included a plan to unveil the
secret. with the arrival of a specific date in history, the brotherhood plans to break the silence and
carry out its ultimate triumph by unveiling the sangreal documents to the world and shouting the
true story of jesus christ from the mountaintops."

sophie stared at teabing in silence. finally, she too sat down. "and you think that date is
approaching? and the church knows it?"

"a speculation," teabing said, "but it would certainly provide the church motivation for an all-out
attack to find the documents before it was too late. "



langdon had the uneasy feeling that teabing was making good sense. "do you think the church
would actually be capable of uncovering hard evidence of the priory's date?"

"why not — if we're assuming the church was able to uncover the identities of the priory members,
then certainly they could have learned of their plans. and even if they don't have the exact date,
their superstitions may be getting the best of them."

"superstitions?" sophie asked.

"in terms of prophecy," teabing said, "we are currently in an epoch of enormous change. the
millennium has recently passed, and with it has ended the two-thousand-year-long astrological age
of pisces — the fish, which is also the sign of jesus. as any astrological symbologist will tell you,
the piscean ideal believes that man must be told what to do by higher powers because man is
incapable of thinking for himself. hence it has been a time of fervent religion. now, however, we
are entering the age of aquarius — the water bearer — whose ideals claim that man will learn the
truth and be able to think for himself. the ideological shift is enormous, and it is occurring right
now."

langdon felt a shiver. astrological prophecy never held much interest or credibility for him, but he
knew there were those in the church who followed it very closely. "the church calls this
transitional period the end of days."

sophie looked skeptical. "as in the end of the world? the apocalypse?"

"no." langdon replied. "that's a common misconception. many religions speak of the end of
days. it refers not to the end of the world, but rather the end of our current age — pisces, which
began at the time of christ's birth, spanned two thousand years, and waned with the passing of the
millennium. now that we've passed into the age of aquarius, the end of days has arrived."

"many grail historians," teabing added, "believe that //"the priory is indeed planning to release
this truth, this point in history would be a symbolically apt time. most priory academics, myself
included, anticipated the brotherhood's release would coincide precisely with the millennium.
obviously, it did not. admittedly, the roman calendar does not mesh perfectly with astrological
markers, so there is some gray area in the prediction. whether the church now has inside
information that an exact date is looming, or whether they are just getting nervous on account of
astrological prophecy, i don't know. anyway, it's immaterial. either scenario explains how the
church might be motivated to launch a preemptive attack against the priory." teabing frowned.
"and believe me, if the church finds the holy grail, they will destroy it. the documents and the
relics of the blessed mary magdalene as well." his eyes grew heavy. "then, my dear, with the
sangreal documents gone, all evidence will be lost. the church will have won their age-old war to
rewrite history. the past will be erased forever."

slowly, sophie pulled the cruciform key from her sweater pocket and held it out to teabing.



teabing took the key and studied it. "my goodness. the priory seal. where did you get this?"

"my grandfather gave it to me tonight before he died."

teabing ran his fingers across the cruciform. "a key to a church?"

she drew a deep breath. "this key provides access to the keystone."

teabing's head snapped up, his face wild with disbelief. "impossible! what church did i miss? i've
searched every church in france!"

"it's not in a church," sophie said. "it's in a swiss depository bank."

teabing's look of excitement waned. "the keystone is in a bank?"

"a vault," langdon offered.

"a bank vault?" teabing shook his head violently. "that's impossible. the keystone is supposed to
be hidden beneath the sign of the rose."

"it is," langdon said. "it was stored in a rosewood box inlaid with a five-petal rose."

teabing looked thunderstruck. "you've seen the keystone?"

sophie nodded. "we visited the bank."

teabing came over to them, his eyes wild with fear. "my friends, we must do something. the
keystone is in danger! we have a duty to protect it. what if there are other keys? perhaps stolen
from the murdered senechaux? if the church can gain access to the bank as you have — "

"then they will be too late," sophie said. "we removed the keystone."

"what! you removed the keystone from its hiding place?"

"don't worry," langdon said. "the keystone is well hidden."

"extremely well hidden, i hope ! "

"actually," langdon said, unable to hide his grin, "that depends on how often you dust under your
couch."



the wind outside chateau villette had picked up, and silas's robe danced in the breeze as he
crouched near the window. although he had been unable to hear much of the conversation, the
word keystone had sifted through the glass on numerous occasions.

it is inside.

the teacher's words were fresh in his mind. enter chateau villette. take the keystone. hun no
one.

now, langdon and the others had adjourned suddenly to another room, extinguishing the study
lights as they went. feeling like a panther stalking prey, silas crept to the glass doors. finding
them unlocked, he slipped inside and closed the doors silently behind him. he could hear muffled
voices from another room. silas pulled the pistol from his pocket, turned off the safety, and inched
down the hallway.



chapter 63

lieutenant collet stood alone at the foot of leigh teabing's driveway and gazed up at the massive
house. isolated. dark. good ground cover. collet watched his half-dozen agents spreading silently
out along the length of the fence. they could be over it and have the house surrounded in a matter
of minutes. langdon could not have chosen a more ideal spot for collet's men to make a surprise
assault.

collet was about to call fache himself when at last his phone rang.

fache sounded not nearly as pleased with the developments as collet would have imagined. "why
didn't someone tell me we had a lead on langdon?"

"you were on a phone call and — "

"where exactly are you, lieutenant collet?"

collet gave him the address. "the estate belongs to a british national named teabing. langdon
drove a fair distance to get here, and the vehicle is inside the security gate, with no signs of forced
entry, so chances are good that langdon knows the occupant."

"i'm coming out," fache said. "don't make a move. i'll handle this personally."

collet's jaw dropped. "but captain, you're twenty minutes away! we should act immediately. i
have him staked out. i'm with eight men total. four of us have field rifles and the others have



sidearms."

"wait for me."

"captain, what if langdon has a hostage in there? what if he sees us and decides to leave on foot?
we need to move now! my men are in position and ready to go."

"lieutenant collet, you will wait for me to arrive before taking action. that is an order." fache
hung up.

stunned, lieutenant collet switched off his phone. why the hell is fache asking me to wait? collet
knew the answer. fache, though famous for his instinct, was notorious for his pride. fache wants
credit for the arrest. after putting the american's face all over the television, fache wanted to be
sure his own face got equal time. collet's job was simply to hold down the fort until the boss
showed up to save the day.

as he stood there, collet flashed on a second possible explanation for this delay. damage control.
in law enforcement, hesitating to arrest a fugitive only occurred when uncertainty had arisen
regarding the suspect's guilt. is fache having second thoughts that langdon is the right man ? the
thought was frightening. captain fache had gone out on a limb tonight to arrest robert
langdon — surveillance cachee, interpol, and now television. not even the great bezu fache would
survive the political fallout if he had mistakenly splashed a prominent american's face all over
french television, claiming he was a murderer. if fache now realized he'd made a mistake, then it
made perfect sense that he would tell collet not to make a move. the last thing fache needed was
for collet to storm an innocent brit's private estate and take langdon at gunpoint.

moreover, collet realized, if langdon were innocent, it explained one of this case's strangest
paradoxes: why had sophie neveu, the granddaughter of the victim, helped the alleged killer
escape? unless sophie knew langdon was falsely charged. fache had posited all kinds of
explanations tonight to explain sophie's odd behavior, including that sophie, as sauniere's sole
heir, had persuaded her secret lover robert langdon to kill off sauniere for the inheritance money.
sauniere, if he had suspected this, might have left the police the message p.s. find robert
langdon. collet was fairly certain something else was going on here. sophie neveu seemed far too
solid of character to be mixed up in something that sordid.

"lieutenant?" one of the field agents came running over. "we found a car."

collet followed the agent about fifty yards past the driveway. the agent pointed to a wide shoulder
on the opposite side of the road. there, parked in the brush, almost out of sight, was a black audi.
it had rental plates. collet felt the hood. still warm. hot even.

"that must be how langdon got here," collet said. "call the rental company. find out if it's
stolen."



"yes, sir."

another agent waved collet back over in the direction of the fence. "lieutenant, have a look at
this." he handed collet a pair of night vision binoculars. "the grove of trees near the top of the
driveway."

collet aimed the binoculars up the hill and adjusted the image intensifier dials. slowly, the
greenish shapes came into focus. he located the curve of the driveway and slowly followed it up,
reaching the grove of trees. all he could do was stare. there, shrouded in the greenery, was an
armored truck. a truck identical to the one collet had permitted to leave the depository bank of
zurich earlier tonight. he prayed this was some kind of bizarre coincidence, but he knew it could
not be.

"it seems obvious," the agent said, "that this truck is how langdon and neveu got away from the
bank."

collet was speechless. he thought of the armored truck driver he had stopped at the roadblock. the
rolex. his impatience to leave. / never checked the cargo hold.

incredulous, collet realized that someone in the bank had actually lied to dcpj about langdon and
sophie's whereabouts and then helped them escape. but who? and why? collet wondered if maybe
this were the reason fache had told him not to take action yet. maybe fache realized there were
more people involved tonight than just langdon and sophie. and if langdon and neveu arrived in
the armored truck, then who drove the audi?



hundreds of miles to the south, a chartered beechcraft baron 58 raced northward over the
tyrrhenian sea. despite calm skies, bishop aringarosa clutched an airsickness bag, certain he
could be ill at any moment. his conversation with paris had not at all been what he had imagined.

alone in the small cabin, aringarosa twisted the gold ring on his finger and tried to ease his
overwhelming sense of fear and desperation. everything in paris has gone terribly wrong. closing
his eyes, aringarosa said a prayer that bezu fache would have the means to fix it.



chapter 64

teabing sat on the divan, cradling the wooden box on his lap and admiring the lid's intricate inlaid
rose. tonight has become the strangest and most magical night of my life.



"lift the lid," sophie whispered, standing over him, beside langdon.

teabing smiled. do not rush me. having spent over a decade searching for this keystone, he
wanted to savor every millisecond of this moment. he ran a palm across the wooden lid, feeling the
texture of the inlaid flower.

"the rose," he whispered. the rose is magdalene is the holy grail. the rose is the compass that
guides the way. teabing felt foolish. for years he had traveled to cathedrals and churches all over
france, paying for special access, examining hundreds of archways beneath rose windows,
searching for an encrypted keystone. la clef de voute — a stone key beneath the sign of the rose.

teabing slowly unlatched the lid and raised it.

as his eyes finally gazed upon the contents, he knew in an instant it could only be the keystone. he
was staring at a stone cylinder, crafted of interconnecting lettered dials. the device seemed
surprisingly familiar to him.

"designed from da vinci's diaries," sophie said. "my grandfather made them as a hobby."

of course, teabing realized. he had seen the sketches and blueprints. the key to finding the holy
grail lies inside this stone. teabing lifted the heavy cryptex from the box, holding it gently.
although he had no idea how to open the cylinder, he sensed his own destiny lay inside. in
moments of failure, teabing had questioned whether his life's quest would ever be rewarded. now
those doubts were gone forever. he could hear the ancient words... the foundation of the grail
legend:

vous ne trouvezpas le saint-graal, c'est le saint-graal qui vous trouve.

you do not find the grail, the grail finds you.

and tonight, incredibly, the key to finding the holy grail had walked right through his front door.



while sophie and teabing sat with the cryptex and talked about the vinegar, the dials, and what the
password might be, langdon carried the rosewood box across the room to a well-lit table to get a
better look at it. something teabing had just said was now running through langdon's mind.

the key to the grail is hidden beneath the sign of the rose.

langdon held the wooden box up to the light and examined the inlaid symbol of the rose.
although his familiarity with art did not include woodworking or inlaid furniture, he had just
recalled the famous tiled ceiling of the spanish monastery outside of madrid, where, three



centuries after its construction, the ceiling tiles began to fall out, revealing sacred texts scrawled by
monks on the plaster beneath.

langdon looked again at the rose.

beneath the rose.

sub rosa.

secret.

a bump in the hallway behind him made langdon turn. he saw nothing but shadows. teabing's
manservant most likely had passed through. langdon turned back to the box. he ran his finger over
the smooth edge of the inlay, wondering if he could pry the rose out, but the craftsmanship was
perfect. he doubted even a razor blade could fit in between the inlaid rose and the carefully carved
depression into which it was seated.

opening the box, he examined the inside of the lid. it was smooth. as he shifted its position,
though, the light caught what appeared to be a small hole on the underside of the lid, positioned in
the exact center. langdon closed the lid and examined the inlaid symbol from the top. no hole.

it doesn 't pass through.

setting the box on the table, he looked around the room and spied a stack of papers with a paper
clip on it. borrowing the clip, he returned to the box, opened it, and studied the hole again.
carefully, he unbent the paper clip and inserted one end into the hole. he gave a gentle push. it
took almost no effort. he heard something clatter quietly onto the table. langdon closed the lid to
look. it was a small piece of wood, like a puzzle piece. the wooden rose had popped out of the lid
and fallen onto the desk.

speechless, langdon stared at the bare spot on the lid where the rose had been. there, engraved in
the wood, written in an immaculate hand, were four lines of text in a language he had never seen.

the characters look vaguely semitic, langdon thought to himself, and yet i don 't recognize the
language!

a sudden movement behind him caught his attention. out of nowhere, a crushing blow to the head
knocked langdon to his knees.

as he fell, he thought for a moment he saw a pale ghost hovering over him, clutching a gun. then
everything went black.



chapter 65

sophie neveu, despite working in law enforcement, had never found herself at gunpoint until
tonight. almost inconceivably, the gun into which she was now staring was clutched in the pale
hand of an enormous albino with long white hair. he looked at her with red eyes that radiated a
frightening, disembodied quality. dressed in a wool robe with a rope tie, he resembled a medieval
cleric. sophie could not imagine who he was, and yet she was feeling a sudden newfound respect
for teabing's suspicions that the church was behind this.

"you know what i have come for," the monk said, his voice hollow.

sophie and teabing were seated on the divan, arms raised as their attacker had commanded.
langdon lay groaning on the floor. the monk's eyes fell immediately to the keystone on teabing's
lap.

teabing's tone was defiant. "you will not be able to open it."

"my teacher is very wise," the monk replied, inching closer, the gun shifting between teabing and
sophie.

sophie wondered where teabing's manservant was. didn't he hear robert fall?

"who is your teacher?" teabing asked. "perhaps we can make a financial arrangement."

"the grail is priceless." he moved closer.



"you're bleeding," teabing noted calmly, nodding to the monk's right ankle where a trickle of
blood had run down his leg. "and you're limping."

"as do you," the monk replied, motioning to the metal crutches propped beside teabing. "now,
hand me the keystone."

"you know of the keystone?" teabing said, sounding surprised.

"never mind what i know. stand up slowly, and give it to me."

"standing is difficult for me."

"precisely. i would prefer nobody attempt any quick moves."

teabing slipped his right hand through one of his crutches and grasped the keystone in his left.
lurching to his feet, he stood erect, palming the heavy cylinder in his left hand, and leaning



unsteadily on his crutch with his right.

the monk closed to within a few feet, keeping the gun aimed directly at teabing's head. sophie
watched, feeling helpless as the monk reached out to take the cylinder.

"you will not succeed," teabing said. "only the worthy can unlock this stone."



god alone judges the worthy, silas thought.

"it's quite heavy," the man on crutches said, his arm wavering now. "if you don't take it soon, i'm
afraid i shall drop it!" he swayed perilously.

silas stepped quickly forward to take the stone, and as he did, the man on crutches lost his balance.
the crutch slid out from under him, and he began to topple sideways to his right. no! silas lunged
to save the stone, lowering his weapon in the process. but the keystone was moving away from
him now. as the man fell to his right, his left hand swung backward, and the cylinder tumbled from
his palm onto the couch. at the same instant, the metal crutch that had been sliding out from under
the man seemed to accelerate, cutting a wide arc through the air toward silas's leg.

splinters of pain tore up silas's body as the crutch made perfect contact with his cilice, crushing the
barbs into his already raw flesh. buckling, silas crumpled to his knees, causing the belt to cut
deeper still. the pistol discharged with a deafening roar, the bullet burying itself harmlessly in the
floorboards as silas fell. before he could raise the gun and fire again, the woman's foot caught him
square beneath the jaw.



at the bottom of the driveway, collet heard the gunshot. the muffled pop sent panic through his
veins. with fache on the way, collet had already relinquished any hopes of claiming personal
credit for finding langdon tonight. but collet would be damned if fache's ego landed him in front
of a ministerial review board for negligent police procedure.

a weapon was discharged inside a private home! and you waited at the bottom of the driveway?

collet knew the opportunity for a stealth approach had long since passed. he also knew if he stood
idly by for another second, his entire career would be history by morning. eyeing the estate's iron
gate, he made his decision.

"tie on, and pull it down."



in the distant recesses of his groggy mind, robert langdon had heard the gunshot. he'd also heard
a scream of pain. his own? a jackhammer was boring a hole into the back of his cranium.
somewhere nearby, people were talking.

"where the devil were you?" teabing was yelling.

the manservant hurried in. "what happened? oh my god! who is that? i'll call the police!"

"bloody hell! don't call the police. make yourself useful and get us something with which to
restrain this monster."

"and some ice!" sophie called after him.

langdon drifted out again. more voices. movement. now he was seated on the divan. sophie was
holding an ice pack to his head. his skull ached. as langdon's vision finally began to clear, he
found himself staring at a body on the floor. am i hallucinating? the massive body of an albino
monk lay bound and gagged with duct tape. his chin was split open, and the robe over his right
thigh was soaked with blood. he too appeared to be just now coming to.

langdon turned to sophie. "who is that? what... happened?"

teabing hobbled over. "you were rescued by a knight brandishing an excalibur made by acme
orthopedic."

huh? langdon tried to sit up.

sophie's touch was shaken but tender. "just give yourself a minute, robert."

"i fear," teabing said, "that i've just demonstrated for your lady friend the unfortunate benefit of
my condition. it seems everyone underestimates you."

from his seat on the divan, langdon gazed down at the monk and tried to imagine what had
happened.

"he was wearing a cilice, " teabing explained.

"a what?"

teabing pointed to a bloody strip of barbed leather that lay on the floor. "a discipline belt. he
wore it on his thigh. i took careful aim."

langdon rubbed his head. he knew of discipline belts. "but how... did you know?"



teabing grinned. "christianity is my field of study, robert, and there are certain sects who wear
their hearts on their sleeves." he pointed his crutch at the blood soaking through the monk's cloak.
"as it were."

"opus dei," langdon whispered, recalling recent media coverage of several prominent boston
businessmen who were members of opus dei. apprehensive coworkers had falsely and publicly
accused the men of wearing discipline belts beneath their three-piece suits. in fact, the three men
did no such thing. like many members of opus dei, these businessmen were at the
"supernumerary" stage and practiced no corporal mortification at all. they were devout catholics,
caring fathers to their children, and deeply dedicated members of the community. not surprisingly,
the media spotlighted their spiritual commitment only briefly before moving on to the shock value
of the sect's more stringent "numerary" members... members like the monk now lying on the floor
before langdon.

teabing was looking closely at the bloody belt. "but why would opus dei be trying to find the
holy grail?"

langdon was too groggy to consider it.

"robert," sophie said, walking to the wooden box. "what's this?" she was holding the small rose
inlay he had removed from the lid.

"it covered an engraving on the box. i think the text might tell us how to open the keystone."

before sophie and teabing could respond, a sea of blue police lights and sirens erupted at the
bottom of the hill and began snaking up the half-mile driveway.

teabing frowned. "my friends, it seems we have a decision to make. and we'd better make it fast."



chapter 66

collet and his agents burst through the front door of sir leigh teabing's estate with their guns
drawn. fanning out, they began searching all the rooms on the first level. they found a bullet hole
in the drawing room floor, signs of a struggle, a small amount of blood, a strange, barbed leather
belt, and a partially used roll of duct tape. the entire level seemed deserted.

just as collet was about to divide his men to search the basement and grounds behind the house, he
heard voices on the level above them.

"they're upstairs!"



rushing up the wide staircase, collet and his men moved room by room through the huge home,
securing darkened bedrooms and hallways as they closed in on the sounds of voices. the sound
seemed to be coming from the last bedroom on an exceptionally long hallway. the agents inched
down the corridor, sealing off alternate exits.

as they neared the final bedroom, collet could see the door was wide open. the voices had
stopped suddenly, and had been replaced by an odd rumbling, like an engine.

sidearm raised, collet gave the signal. reaching silently around the door frame, he found the light
switch and flicked it on. spinning into the room with men pouring in after him, collet shouted and
aimed his weapon at... nothing.

an empty guest bedroom. pristine.

the rumbling sounds of an automobile engine poured from a black electronic panel on the wall
beside the bed. collet had seen these elsewhere in the house. some kind of intercom system. he
raced over. the panel had about a dozen labeled buttons:

study... kitchen... laundry... cellar...



so where the hell do i hear a car?

master bedroom... sun room... barn... library.



barn! collet was downstairs in seconds, running toward the back door, grabbing one of his agents
on the way. the men crossed the rear lawn and arrived breathless at the front of a weathered gray
barn. even before they entered, collet could hear the fading sounds of a car engine. he drew his
weapon, rushed in, and flicked on the lights.

the right side of the barn was a rudimentary workshop — lawn-mowers, automotive tools,
gardening supplies. a familiar intercom panel hung on the wall nearby. one of its buttons was
flipped down, transmitting.

guest bedroom ii.



collet wheeled, anger brimming. they lured us upstairs with the intercom! searching the other side
of the barn, he found a long line of horse stalls. no horses. apparently the owner preferred a
different kind of horsepower; the stalls had been converted into an impressive automotive parking
facility. the collection was astonishing — a black ferrari, a pristine rolls-royce, an antique astin
martin sports coupe, a vintage porsche 356.



the last stall was empty.

collet ran over and saw oil stains on the stall floor. they can't get off the compound. the driveway
and gate were barricaded with two patrol cars to prevent this very situation.

"sir?" the agent pointed down the length of the stalls.

the barn's rear slider was wide open, giving way to a dark, muddy slope of rugged fields that
stretched out into the night behind the barn. collet ran to the door, trying to see out into the
darkness. all he could make out was the faint shadow of a forest in the distance. no headlights.
this wooded valley was probably crisscrossed by dozens of unmapped fire roads and hunting
trails, but collet was confident his quarry would never make the woods. "get some men spread out
down there. they're probably already stuck somewhere nearby. these fancy sports cars can't
handle terrain."

"urn, sir?" the agent pointed to a nearby pegboard on which hung several sets of keys. the labels
above the keys bore familiar names.

daimler... rolls-royce... astin martin... porsche...



the last peg was empty.

when collet read the label above the empty peg, he knew he was in trouble.



chapter 67

the range rover was java black pearl, four-wheel drive, standard transmission, with high-
strength polypropylene lamps, rear light cluster fittings, and the steering wheel on the right.

langdon was pleased he was not driving.

teabing's manservant remy, on orders from his master, was doing an impressive job of
maneuvering the vehicle across the moonlit fields behind chateau villette. with no headlights, he
had crossed an open knoll and was now descending a long slope, moving farther away from the
estate. he seemed to be heading toward a jagged silhouette of wooded land in the distance.

langdon, cradling the keystone, turned in the passenger seat and eyed teabing and sophie in the
back seat.



"how's your head, robert?" sophie asked, sounding concerned.

langdon forced a pained smile. "better, thanks." it was killing him.

beside her, teabing glanced over his shoulder at the bound and gagged monk lying in the cramped
luggage area behind the back seat. teabing had the monk's gun on his lap and looked like an old
photo of a british safari chap posing over his kill.

"so glad you popped in this evening, robert," teabing said, grinning as if he were having fun for
the first time in years.

"sorry to get you involved in this, leigh."

"oh, please, i've waited my entire life to be involved." teabing looked past langdon out the
windshield at the shadow of a long hedgerow. he tapped remy on the shoulder from behind.
"remember, no brake lights. use the emergency brake if you need it. i want to get into the woods a
bit. no reason to risk them seeing us from the house."

remy coasted to a crawl and guided the range rover through an opening in the hedge. as the
vehicle lurched onto an overgrown pathway, almost immediately the trees overhead blotted out the
moonlight.

/ can 't see a thing, langdon thought, straining to distinguish any shapes at all in front of them. it
was pitch black. branches rubbed against the left side of the vehicle, and remy corrected in the
other direction. keeping the wheel more or less straight now, he inched ahead about thirty yards.

"you're doing beautifully, remy," teabing said. "that should be far enough. robert, if you could
press that little blue button just below the vent there. see it?"

langdon found the button and pressed it.

a muted yellow glow fanned out across the path in front of them, revealing thick underbrush on
either side of the pathway. fog lights, langdon realized. they gave off just enough light to keep
them on the path, and yet they were deep enough into the woods now that the lights would not give
them away.

"well, remy," teabing chimed happily. "the lights are on. our lives are in your hands."

"where are we going?" sophie asked.

"this trail continues about three kilometers into the forest," teabing said. "cutting across the estate
and then arching north. provided we don't hit any standing water or fallen trees, we shall emerge
unscathed on the shoulder of highway five."



unscathed. langdon's head begged to differ. he turned his eyes down to his own lap, where the
keystone was safely stowed in its wooden box. the inlaid rose on the lid was back in place, and
although his head felt muddled, langdon was eager to remove the inlay again and examine the
engraving beneath more closely. he unlatched the lid and began to raise it when teabing laid a
hand on his shoulder from behind.

"patience, robert," teabing said. "it's bumpy and dark. god save us if we break anything. if you
didn't recognize the language in the light, you won't do any better in the dark. let's focus on getting
away in one piece, shall we? there will be time for that very soon."

langdon knew teabing was right. with a nod, he relatched the box.

the monk in back was moaning now, struggling against his trusses. suddenly, he began kicking
wildly.

teabing spun around and aimed the pistol over the seat. "i can't imagine your complaint, sir. you
trespassed in my home and planted a nasty welt on the skull of a dear friend. i would be well
within my rights to shoot you right now and leave you to rot in the woods."

the monk fell silent.

"are you sure we should have brought him?" langdon asked.

"bloody well positive!" teabing exclaimed. "you're wanted for murder, robert. this scoundrel is
your ticket to freedom. the police apparently want you badly enough to have tailed you to my
home."

"my fault," sophie said. "the armored car probably had a transmitter."

"not the point," teabing said. "i'm not surprised the police found you, but i am surprised that this
opus dei character found you. from all you've told me, i can't imagine how this man could have
tailed you to my home unless he had a contact either within the judicial police or within the zurich
depository."

langdon considered it. bezu fache certainly seemed intent on finding a scapegoat for tonight's
murders. and vernet had turned on them rather suddenly, although considering langdon was
being charged with four murders, the banker's change of heart seemed understandable.

"this monk is not working alone, robert," teabing said, "and until you learn who is behind all this,
you both are in danger. the good news, my friend, is that you are now in the position of power.
this monster behind me holds that information, and whoever is pulling his strings has got to be
quite nervous right now."



remy was picking up speed, getting comfortable with the trail. they splashed through some water,
climbed a small rise, and began descending again.

"robert, could you be so kind as to hand me that phone?" teabing pointed to the car phone on the
dash. langdon handed it back, and teabing dialed a number. he waited for a very long time before
someone answered. "richard? did i wake you? of course, i did. silly question. i'm sorry. i have a
small problem. i'm feeling a bit off. remy and i need to pop up to the isles for my treatments.
well, right away, actually. sorry for the short notice. can you have elizabeth ready in about twenty
minutes? i know, do the best you can. see you shortly." he hung up.

"elizabeth?" langdon said.

"my plane. she cost me a queen's ransom."

langdon turned full around and looked at him.

"what?" teabing demanded. "you two can't expect to stay in france with the entire judicial police
after you. london will be much safer."

sophie had turned to teabing as well. "you think we should leave the country?"

"my friends, i am far more influential in the civilized world than here in france. furthermore, the
grail is believed to be in great britain. if we unlock the keystone, i am certain we will discover a
map that indicates we have moved in the proper direction."

"you're running a big risk," sophie said, "by helping us. you won't make any friends with the
french police."

teabing gave a wave of disgust. "i am finished with france. i moved here to find the keystone.
that work is now done. i shan't care if i ever again see chateau villette."

sophie sounded uncertain. "how will we get through airport security?"

teabing chuckled. "i fly from le bourget — an executive airfield not far from here. french doctors
make me nervous, so every fortnight, i fly north to take my treatments in england. i pay for certain
special privileges at both ends. once we're airborne, you can make a decision as to whether or not
you'd like someone from the u.s. embassy to meet us."

langdon suddenly didn't want anything to do with the embassy. all he could think of was the
keystone, the inscription, and whether it would all lead to the grail. he wondered if teabing was
right about britain. admittedly most modern legends placed the grail somewhere in the united
kingdom. even king arthur's mythical, grail-rich isle of avalon was now believed to be none
other than glastonbury, england. wherever the grail lay, langdon never imagined he would



actually be looking for it. the sangreal documents. the true history of jesus christ. the tomb of
mary magdalene. he suddenly felt as if he were living in some kind of limbo tonight... a bubble
where the real world could not reach him.

"sir?" remy said. "are you truly thinking of returning to england for good?"

"remy, you needn't worry," teabing assured. "just because i am returning to the queen's realm
does not mean i intend to subject my palate to bangers and mash for the rest of my days. i expect
you will join me there permanently. i'm planning to buy a splendid villa in devonshire, and we'll
have all your things shipped up immediately. an adventure, remy. i say, an adventure!"

langdon had to smile. as teabing railed on about his plans for a triumphant return to britain,
langdon felt himself caught up in the man's infectious enthusiasm.

gazing absently out the window, langdon watched the woods passing by, ghostly pale in the
yellow blush of the fog lights. the side mirror was tipped inward, brushed askew by branches, and
langdon saw the reflection of sophie sitting quietly in the back seat. he watched her for a long
while and felt an unexpected upwelling of contentment. despite his troubles tonight, langdon was
thankful to have landed in such good company.

after several minutes, as if suddenly sensing his eyes on her, sophie leaned forward and put her
hands on his shoulders, giving him a quick rub. "you okay?"

"yeah," langdon said. "somehow."

sophie sat back in her seat, and langdon saw a quiet smile cross her lips. he realized that he too
was now grinning.



wedged in the back of the range rover, silas could barely breathe. his arms were wrenched
backward and heavily lashed to his ankles with kitchen twine and duct tape. every bump in the
road sent pain shooting through his twisted shoulders. at least his captors had removed the cilice.
unable to inhale through the strip of tape over his mouth, he could only breathe through his
nostrils, which were slowly clogging up due to the dusty rear cargo area into which he had been
crammed. he began coughing.

"i think he's choking," the french driver said, sounding concerned.

the british man who had struck silas with his crutch now turned and peered over the seat,
frowning coldly at silas. "fortunately for you, we british judge man's civility not by his
compassion for his friends, but by his compassion for his enemies." the brit reached down and
grabbed the duct tape on silas's mouth. in one fast motion, he tore it off.



silas felt as if his lips had just caught fire, but the air pouring into his lungs was sent from god.

"whom do you work for?" the british man demanded.

"i do the work of god," silas spat back through the pain in his jaw where the woman had kicked
him.

"you belong to opus dei," the man said. it was not a question.

"you know nothing of who i am."

"why does opus dei want the keystone?"

silas had no intention of answering. the keystone was the link to the holy grail, and the holy
grail was the key to protecting the faith.

/ do the work of god. the way is in peril.

now, in the range rover, struggling against his bonds, silas feared he had failed the teacher and
the bishop forever. he had no way even to contact them and tell them the terrible turn of events.
my captors have the keystone! they will reach the grail before we do! in the stifling darkness,
silas prayed. he let the pain of his body fuel his supplications.

a miracle, lord. i need a miracle. silas had no way of knowing that hours from now, he would get
one.



"robert?" sophie was still watching him. "a funny look just crossed your face."

langdon glanced back at her, realizing his jaw was firmly set and his heart was racing. an
incredible notion had just occurred to him. could it really be that simple an explanation? "i need to
use your cell phone, sophie."

"now?"

"i think i just figured something out."

"what?"

"i'll tell you in a minute. i need your phone."

sophie looked wary. "i doubt fache is tracing, but keep it under a minute just in case." she gave



him her phone.

"how do i dial the states?"

"you need to reverse the charges. my service doesn't cover transatlantic."

langdon dialed zero, knowing that the next sixty seconds might answer a question that had been
puzzling him all night.



chapter 68

new york editor jonas faukman had just climbed into bed for the night when the telephone rang.
a little late for callers, he grumbled, picking up the receiver.

an operator's voice asked him, "will you accept charges for a collect call from robert langdon?"

puzzled, jonas turned on the light. "uh... sure, okay."

the line clicked. "jonas?"

"robert? you wake me up and you charge me for it?"

"jonas, forgive me," langdon said. "i'll keep this very short. i really need to know. the manuscript
i gave you. have you — "

"robert, i'm sorry, i know i said i'd send the edits out to you this week, but i'm swamped. next
monday. i promise."

"i'm not worried about the edits. i need to know if you sent any copies out for blurbs without
telling me?"

faukman hesitated. langdon's newest manuscript — an exploration of the history of goddess
worship — included several sections about mary magdalene that were going to raise some
eyebrows. although the material was well documented and had been covered by others, faukman
had no intention of printing advance reading copies of langdon's book without at least a few
endorsements from serious historians and art luminaries. jonas had chosen ten big names in the art
world and sent them all sections of the manuscript along with a polite letter asking if they would be
willing to write a short endorsement for the jacket. in faukman's experience, most people jumped
at the opportunity to see their name in print.



"jonas?" langdon pressed. "you sent out my manuscript, didn't you?"

faukman frowned, sensing langdon was not happy about it. "the manuscript was clean, robert,
and i wanted to surprise you with some terrific blurbs."

a pause. "did you send one to the curator of the paris louvre?"

"what do you think? your manuscript referenced his louvre collection several times, his books are
in your bibliography, and the guy has some serious clout for foreign sales. sauniere was a no-
brainer. "

the silence on the other end lasted a long time. "when did you send it?"

"about a month ago. i also mentioned you would be in paris soon and suggested you two chat. did
he ever call you to meet?" faukman paused, rubbing his eyes. "hold on, aren't you supposed to be
in paris this week?"

"lam in paris."

faukman sat upright. "you called me collect from paris?"

"take it out of my royalties, jonas. did you ever hear back from sauniere? did he like the
manuscript?"

"i don't know. i haven't yet heard from him."

"well, don't hold your breath. i've got to run, but this explains a lot thanks."

"robert—"

but langdon was gone.

faukman hung up the phone, shaking his head in disbelief authors, he thought. even the sane ones
are nuts.



inside the range rover, leigh teabing let out a guffaw. "robert, you're saying you wrote a
manuscript that delves into a secret society, and your editor sent a copy to that secret society?"

langdon slumped. "evidently."

"a cruel coincidence, my friend."



coincidence has nothing to do with it, langdon knew. asking jacques sauniere to endorse a
manuscript on goddess worship was as obvious as asking tiger woods to endorse a book on golf.
moreover, it was virtually guaranteed that any book on goddess worship would have to mention the
priory of sion.

"here's the million-dollar question," teabing said, still chuckling. "was your position on the priory
favorable or unfavorable?"

langdon could hear teabing's true meaning loud and clear. many historians questioned why the
priory was still keeping the sangreal documents hidden. some felt the information should have
been shared with the world long ago. "i took no position on the priory's actions."

"you mean lack thereof."

langdon shrugged. teabing was apparently on the side of making the documents public. "i simply
provided history on the brotherhood and described them as a modern goddess worship society,
keepers of the grail, and guardians of ancient documents."

sophie looked at him. "did you mention the keystone?"

langdon winced. he had. numerous times. "i talked about the supposed keystone as an example of
the lengths to which the priory would go to protect the sangreal documents."

sophie looked amazed. "i guess that explains p.s. find robert langdon. "

langdon sensed it was actually something else in the manuscript that had piqued sauniere's
interest, but that topic was something he would discuss with sophie when they were alone.

"so," sophie said, "you lied to captain fache."

"what?" langdon demanded.

"you told him you had never corresponded with my grandfather."

"i didn't! my editor sent him a manuscript."

"think about it, robert. if captain fache didn't find the envelope in which your editor sent the
manuscript, he would have to conclude that you sent it." she paused. "or worse, that you hand-
delivered it and lied about it. "



when the range rover arrived at le bourget airfield, remy drove to a small hangar at the far end



of the airstrip. as they approached, a tousled man in wrinkled khakis hurried from the hangar,
waved, and slid open the enormous corrugated metal door to reveal a sleek white jet within.

langdon stared at the glistening fuselage. "that's elizabeth?"

teabing grinned. "beats the bloody chunnel."

the man in khakis hurried toward them, squinting into the headlights. "almost ready, sir," he
called in a british accent. "my apologies for the delay, but you took me by surprise and — " he
stopped short as the group unloaded. he looked at sophie and langdon, and then teabing.

teabing said, "my associates and i have urgent business in london. we've no time to waste. please
prepare to depart immediately." as he spoke, teabing took the pistol out of the vehicle and handed
it to langdon.

the pilot's eyes bulged at the sight of the weapon. he walked over to teabing and whispered, "sir,
my humble apologies, but my diplomatic flight allowance provides only for you and your
manservant. i cannot take your guests."

"richard," teabing said, smiling warmly, "two thousand pounds sterling and that loaded gun say
you can take my guests." he motioned to the range rover. "and the unfortunate fellow in the
back."



chapter 69

the hawker 731's twin garrett tfe-731 engines thundered, powering the plane skyward with gut-
wrenching force. outside the window, le bourget airfield dropped away with startling speed.

i'm fleeing the country, sophie thought, her body forced back into the leather seat. until this
moment, she had believed her game of cat and mouse with fache would be somehow justifiable to
the ministry of defense. / was attempting to protect an innocent man. i was trying to fulfill my
grandfather's dying wishes. that window of opportunity, sophie knew, had just closed. she was
leaving the country, without documentation, accompanying a wanted man, and transporting a
bound hostage. if a "line of reason" had ever existed, she had just crossed it. at almost the speed of
sound.

sophie was seated with langdon and teabing near the front of the cabin — the fan jet executive
elite design, according to the gold medallion on the door. their plush swivel chairs were bolted to
tracks on the floor and could be repositioned and locked around a rectangular hardwood table. a
mini-boardroom. the dignified surroundings, however, did little to camouflage the less than



dignified state of affairs in the rear of the plane where, in a separate seating area near the rest room,
teabing's manservant remy sat with the pistol in hand, begrudgingly carrying out teabing's orders
to stand guard over the bloody monk who lay trussed at his feet like a piece of luggage.

"before we turn our attention to the keystone," teabing said, "i was wondering if you would permit
me a few words." he sounded apprehensive, like a father about to give the birds-and-the-bees
lecture to his children. "my friends, i realize i am but a guest on this journey, and i am honored as
such. and yet, as someone who has spent his life in search of the grail, i feel it is my duty to warn
you that you are about to step onto a path from which there is no return, regardless of the dangers
involved." he turned to sophie. "miss neveu, your grandfather gave you this cryptex in hopes you
would keep the secret of the holy grail alive."

"yes."

"understandably, you feel obliged to follow the trail wherever it leads."

sophie nodded, although she felt a second motivation still burning within her. the truth about my
family. despite langdon's assurances that the keystone had nothing to do with her past, sophie still
sensed something deeply personal entwined within this mystery, as if this cryptex, forged by her
grandfather's own hands, were trying to speak to her and offer some kind of resolution to the
emptiness that had haunted her all these years.

"your grandfather and three others died tonight," teabing continued, "and they did so to keep this
keystone away from the church. opus dei came within inches tonight of possessing it. you
understand, i hope, that this puts you in a position of exceptional responsibility. you have been
handed a torch. a two-thousand-year-old flame that cannot be allowed to go out. this torch cannot
fall into the wrong hands." he paused, glancing at the rosewood box. "i realize you have been
given no choice in this matter, miss neveu, but considering what is at stake here, you must either
fully embrace this responsibility... or you must pass that responsibility to someone else."

"my grandfather gave the cryptex to me. i'm sure he thought i could handle the responsibility."

teabing looked encouraged but unconvinced. "good. a strong will is necessary. and yet, i am
curious if you understand that successfully unlocking the keystone will bring with it a far greater
trial."

"how so?"

"my dear, imagine that you are suddenly holding a map that reveals the location of the holy grail.
in that moment, you will be in possession of a truth capable of altering history forever. you will be
the keeper of a truth that man has sought for centuries. you will be faced with the responsibility of
revealing that truth to the world. the individual who does so will be revered by many and despised
by many. the question is whether you will have the necessary strength to carry out that task."



sophie paused. "i'm not sure that is my decision to make."

teabing's eyebrows arched. "no? if not the possessor of the keystone, then who?"

"the brotherhood who has successfully protected the secret for so long."

"the priory?" teabing looked skeptical. "but how? the brotherhood was shattered tonight.
decapitated, as you so aptly put it. whether they were infiltrated by some kind of eavesdropping or
by a spy within their ranks, we will never know, but the fact remains that someone got to them and
uncovered the identities of their four top members. i would not trust anyone who stepped forward
from the brotherhood at this point."

"so what do you suggest?" langdon asked.

"robert, you know as well as i do that the priory has not protected the truth all these years to have
it gather dust until eternity. they have been waiting for the right moment in history to share their
secret. a time when the world is ready to handle the truth."

"and you believe that moment has arrived?" langdon asked.

"absolutely. it could not be more obvious. all the historical signs are in place, and if the priory did
not intend to make their secret known very soon, why has the church now attacked?"

sophie argued, "the monk has not yet told us his purpose."

"the monk's purpose is the church's purpose," teabing replied, "to destroy the documents that
reveal the great deception. the church came closer tonight than they have ever come, and the
priory has put its trust in you, miss neveu. the task of saving the holy grail clearly includes
carrying out the priory's final wishes of sharing the truth with the world. "

langdon intervened. "leigh, asking sophie to make that decision is quite a load to drop on
someone who only an hour ago learned the sangreal documents exist."

teabing sighed. "i apologize if i am pressing, miss neveu. clearly i have always believed these
documents should be made public, but in the end the decision belongs to you. i simply feel it is
important that you begin to think about what happens should we succeed in opening the keystone."

"gentlemen," sophie said, her voice firm. "to quote your words, 'you do not find the grail, the
grail finds you.' i am going to trust that the grail has found me for a reason, and when the time
comes, i will know what to do."

both of them looked startled.



"so then," she said, motioning to the rosewood box. "let's move on.



chapter 70

standing in the drawing room of chateau villette, lieutenant collet watched the dying fire and felt
despondent. captain fache had arrived moments earlier and was now in the next room, yelling into
the phone, trying to coordinate the failed attempt to locate the missing range rover.

it could be anywhere by now, collet thought.

having disobeyed fache's direct orders and lost langdon for a second time, collet was grateful
that pts had located a bullet hole in the floor, which at least corroborated collet's claims that a
shot had been fired. still, fache's mood was sour, and collet sensed there would be dire
repercussions when the dust settled.

unfortunately, the clues they were turning up here seemed to shed no light at all on what was going
on or who was involved. the black audi outside had been rented in a false name with false credit
card numbers, and the prints in the car matched nothing in the interpol database.

another agent hurried into the living room, his eyes urgent. "where's captain fache?"

collet barely looked up from the burning embers. "he's on the phone."

"i'm off the phone," fache snapped, stalking into the room. "what have you got?"

the second agent said, "sir, central just heard from andre vernet at the depository bank of
zurich. he wants to talk to you privately. he is changing his story."



"oh?" fache said.

now collet looked up.

"vernet is admitting that langdon and neveu spent time inside his bank tonight."

"we figured that out," fache said. "why did vernet lie about it?"

"he said he'll talk only to you, but he's agreed to cooperate fully."

"in exchange for what?"



"for our keeping his bank's name out of the news and also for helping him recover some stolen
property. it sounds like langdon and neveu stole something from sauniere's account."

"what?" collet blurted. "how?"

fache never flinched, his eyes riveted on the second agent. "what did they steal?"

"vernet didn't elaborate, but he sounds like he's willing to do anything to get it back."

collet tried to imagine how this could happen. maybe langdon and neveu had held a bank
employee at gunpoint? maybe they forced vernet to open sauniere's account and facilitate an
escape in the armored truck. as feasible as it was, collet was having trouble believing sophie
neveu could be involved in anything like that.

from the kitchen, another agent yelled to fache. "captain? i'm going through mr. teabing's speed
dial numbers, and i'm on the phone with le bourget airfield. i've got some bad news."



thirty seconds later, fache was packing up and preparing to leave chateau villette. he had just
learned that teabing kept a private jet nearby at le bourget airfield and that the plane had taken
off about a half hour ago.

the bourget representative on the phone had claimed not to know who was on the plane or where
it was headed. the takeoff had been unscheduled, and no flight plan had been logged. highly
illegal, even for a small airfield. fache was certain that by applying the right pressure, he could get
the answers he was looking for.

"lieutenant collet," fache barked, heading for the door. "i have no choice but to leave you in
charge of the pts investigation here. try to do something right for a change."



chapter 71

as the hawker leveled off, with its nose aimed for england, langdon carefully lifted the rosewood
box from his lap, where he had been protecting it during takeoff. now, as he set the box on the
table, he could sense sophie and teabing leaning forward with anticipation.

unlatching the lid and opening the box, langdon turned his attention not to the lettered dials of the
cryptex, but rather to the tiny hole on the underside of the box lid. using the tip of a pen, he
carefully removed the inlaid rose on top and revealed the text beneath it. sub rosa, he mused,
hoping a fresh look at the text would bring clarity. focusing all his energies, langdon studied the



strange text.








t&%&v7c0dm&



after several seconds, he began to feel the initial frustration resurfacing. "leigh, i just can't seem to
place it. "

from where sophie was seated across the table, she could not yet see the text, but langdon's
inability to immediately identify the language surprised her. my grandfather spoke a language so
obscure that even a symbologist can't identify it? she quickly realized she should not find this
surprising. this would not be the first secret jacques sauniere had kept from his granddaughter.



opposite sophie, leigh teabing felt ready to burst. eager for his chance to see the text, he
quivered with excitement, leaning in, trying to see around langdon, who was still hunched over the
box.

"i don't know," langdon whispered intently. "my first guess is a semitic, but now i'm not so sure.
most primary semitics include nekkudot. this has none."

"probably ancient," teabing offered.

"nekkudot?" sophie inquired.

teabing never took his eyes from the box. "most modern semitic alphabets have no vowels and
use nekkudot — tiny dots and dashes written either below or within the consonants — to indicate
what vowel sound accompanies them. historically speaking, nekkudot are a relatively modern
addition to language."



langdon was still hovering over the script. "a sephardic transliteration, perhaps...?"

teabing could bear it no longer. "perhaps if i just..." reaching over, he edged the box away from
langdon and pulled it toward himself. no doubt langdon had a solid familiarity with the standard
ancients — greek, latin, the romances — but from the fleeting glance teabing had of this language,
he thought it looked more specialized, possibly a rashi script or a sta'm with crowns.

taking a deep breath, teabing feasted his eyes upon the engraving. he said nothing for a very long
time. with each passing second, teabing felt his confidence deflating. "i'm astonished," he said.
"this language looks like nothing i've ever seen!"

langdon slumped.

"might i see it?" sophie asked.

teabing pretended not to hear her. "robert, you said earlier that you thought you'd seen something
like this before?"

langdon looked vexed. "i thought so. i'm not sure. the script looks familiar somehow."

"leigh?" sophie repeated, clearly not appreciating being left out of the discussion. "might i have a
look at the box my grandfather made?"

"of course, dear," teabing said, pushing it over to her. he hadn't meant to sound belittling, and yet
sophie neveu was light-years out of her league. if a british royal historian and a harvard
symbologist could not even identify the language —

"aah," sophie said, seconds after examining the box. "i should have guessed."

teabing and langdon turned in unison, staring at her.

"guessed what?" teabing demanded.

sophie shrugged. "guessed that this would be the language my grandfather would have used."

"you're saying you can read this text?" teabing exclaimed.

"quite easily," sophie chimed, obviously enjoying herself now. "my grandfather taught me this
language when i was only six years old. i'm fluent." she leaned across the table and fixed teabing
with an admonishing glare. "and frankly, sir, considering your allegiance to the crown, i'm a little
surprised you didn't recognize it."

in a flash, langdon knew.



no wonder the script looks so damned familiar!

several years ago, langdon had attended an event at harvard's fogg museum. harvard dropout
bill gates had returned to his alma mater to lend to the museum one of his priceless
acquisitions — eighteen sheets of paper he had recently purchased at auction from the armand
hammar estate.

his winning bid — a cool $30.8 million.

the author of the pages — leonardo da vinci.

the eighteen folios — now known as leonardo's codex leicester after their famous owner, the earl
of leicester — were all that remained of one of leonardo's most fascinating notebooks: essays and
drawings outlining da vinci's progressive theories on astronomy, geology, archaeology, and
hydrology.

langdon would never forget his reaction after waiting in line and finally viewing the priceless
parchment. utter letdown. the pages were unintelligible. despite being beautifully preserved and
written in an impeccably neat penmanship — crimson ink on cream paper — the codex looked like
gibberish. at first langdon thought he could not read them because da vinci wrote his notebooks
in an archaic italian. but after studying them more closely, he realized he could not identify a
single italian word, or even one letter.

"try this, sir," whispered the female docent at the display case. she motioned to a hand mirror
affixed to the display on a chain. langdon picked it up and examined the text in the mirror's
surface.

instantly it was clear.

langdon had been so eager to peruse some of the great thinker's ideas that he had forgotten one of
the man's numerous artistic talents was an ability to write in a mirrored script that was virtually
illegible to anyone other than himself. historians still debated whether da vinci wrote this way
simply to amuse himself or to keep people from peering over his shoulder and stealing his ideas,
but the point was moot. da vinci did as he pleased.



sophie smiled inwardly to see that robert understood her meaning. "i can read the first few
words," she said. "it's english."

teabing was still sputtering. "what's going on?"

"reverse text," langdon said. "we need a mirror."



"no we don't," sophie said. "i bet this veneer is thin enough." she lifted the rosewood box up to a
canister light on the wall and began examining the underside of the lid. her grandfather couldn't
actually write in reverse, so he always cheated by writing normally and then flipping the paper over
and tracing the reversed impression. sophie's guess was that he had wood-burned normal text into
a block of wood and then run the back of the block through a sander until the wood was paper thin
and the wood-burning could be seen through the wood. then he'd simply flipped the piece over,
and laid it in.

as sophie moved the lid closer to the light, she saw she was right. the bright beam sifted through
the thin layer of wood, and the script appeared in reverse on the underside of the lid.

instantly legible.

"english," teabing croaked, hanging his head in shame. "my native tongue."



at the rear of the plane, remy legaludec strained to hear beyond the rumbling engines, but the
conversation up front was inaudible. remy did not like the way the night was progressing. not at
all. he looked down at the bound monk at his feet. the man lay perfectly still now, as if in a trance
of acceptance, or perhaps, in silent prayer for deliverance.



chapter 72

fifteen thousand feet in the air, robert langdon felt the physical world fade away as all of his
thoughts converged on sauniere's mirror-image poem, which was illuminated through the lid of the
box.



^^3ftkv3wta



w&ssii




sophie quickly found some paper and copied it down longhand. when she was done, the three of
them took turns reading the text. it was like some kind of archaeological crossword... a riddle that
promised to reveal how to open the cryptex. langdon read the verse slowly.



an ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll... and helps us keep her scatter' d family whole,
headstone praised by templars is the key... and atbash will reveal the truth to thee.



a



before langdon could even ponder what ancient password the verse was trying to reveal, he felt
something far more fundamental resonate within him — the meter of the poem. iambic pentameter.

langdon had come across this meter often over the years while researching secret societies across
europe, including just last year in the vatican secret archives. for centuries, iambic pentameter
had been a preferred poetic meter of outspoken literati across the globe, from the ancient greek
writer archilochus to shakespeare, milton, chaucer, and voltaire — bold souls who chose to write
their social commentaries in a meter that many of the day believed had mystical properties. the
roots of iambic pentameter were deeply pagan.

iambs. two syllables with opposite emphasis. stressed and unstressed. yin yang. a balanced pair.
arranged in strings of five. pentameter. five for the pentacle of venus and the sacred feminine.

"it's pentameter!" teabing blurted, turning to langdon. "and the verse is in english! la lingua
pural"

langdon nodded. the priory, like many european secret societies at odds with the church, had
considered english the only european pure language for centuries. unlike french, spanish, and
italian, which were rooted in latin — the tongue of the vatican — english was linguistically
removed from rome's propaganda machine, and therefore became a sacred, secret tongue for those
brotherhoods educated enough to learn it.



"this poem," teabing gushed, "references not only the grail, but the knights templar and the
scattered family of mary magdalene! what more could we ask for?"

"the password," sophie said, looking again at the poem. "it sounds like we need some kind of
ancient word of wisdom?"

"abracadabra?" teabing ventured, his eyes twinkling.

a word of five letters, langdon thought, pondering the staggering number of ancient words that
might be considered words of wisdom — selections from mystic chants, astrological prophecies,
secret society inductions, wicca incantations, egyptian magic spells, pagan mantras — the list was
endless.

"the password," sophie said, "appears to have something to do with the templars." she read the
text aloud. " 'a headstone praised by templars is the key.' "

"leigh," langdon said, "you're the templar specialist. any ideas?"

teabing was silent for several seconds and then sighed. "well, a headstone is obviously a grave
marker of some sort. it's possible the poem is referencing a gravestone the templars praised at the
tomb of magdalene, but that doesn't help us much because we have no idea where her tomb is."

"the last line," sophie said, "says that atbash will reveal the truth. i've heard that word. atbash."

"i'm not surprised," langdon replied. "you probably heard it in cryptology 101. the atbash
cipher is one of the oldest codes known to man."

of course! sophie thought. the famous hebrew encoding system.

the atbash cipher had indeed been part of sophie's early cryptology training. the cipher dated
back to 500 b.c. and was now used as a classroom example of a basic rotational substitution
scheme. a common form of jewish cryptogram, the atbash cipher was a simple substitution code
based on the twenty-two-letter hebrew alphabet. in atbash, the first letter was substituted by the
last letter, the second letter by the next to last letter, and so on.

"atbash is sublimely appropriate," teabing said. "text encrypted with atbash is found throughout
the kabbala, the dead sea scrolls, and even the old testament. jewish scholars and mystics are
still finding hidden meanings using atbash. the priory certainly would include the atbash cipher
as part of their teachings."

"the only problem," langdon said, "is that we don't have anything on which to apply the cipher."



teabing sighed. "there must be a code word on the headstone. we must find this headstone
praised by templars."

sophie sensed from the grim look on langdon's face that finding the templar headstone would be
no small feat.

atbash is the key, sophie thought. but we don 't have a door.

it was three minutes later that teabing heaved a frustrated sigh and shook his head. "my friends,
i'm stymied. let me ponder this while i get us some nibblies and check on remy and our guest."
he stood up and headed for the back of the plane.

sophie felt tired as she watched him go.

outside the window, the blackness of the predawn was absolute. sophie felt as if she were being
hurtled through space with no idea where she would land. having grown up solving her
grandfather's riddles, she had the uneasy sense right now that this poem before them contained
information they still had not seen.

there is more there, she told herself. ingeniously hidden... but present nonetheless.

also plaguing her thoughts was a fear that what they eventually found inside this cryptex would
not be as simple as "a map to the holy grail." despite teabing's and langdon's confidence that the
truth lay just within the marble cylinder, sophie had solved enough of her grandfather's treasure
hunts to know that jacques sauniere did not give up his secrets easily.



chapter 73

bourget airfield's night shift air traffic controller had been dozing before a blank radar screen
when the captain of the judicial police practically broke down his door.

"teabing's jet," bezu fache blared, marching into the small tower, "where did it go?"

the controller's initial response was a babbling, lame attempt to protect the privacy of their british
client — one of the airfield's most respected customers. it failed miserably.

"okay," fache said, "i am placing you under arrest for permitting a private plane to take off
without registering a flight plan. " fache motioned to another officer, who approached with
handcuffs, and the traffic controller felt a surge of terror. he thought of the newspaper articles
debating whether the nation's police captain was a hero or a menace. that question had just been
answered.



"wait!" the controller heard himself whimper at the sight of the handcuffs. "i can tell you this
much. sir leigh teabing makes frequent trips to london for medical treatments. he has a hangar
at biggin hill executive airport in kent. on the outskirts of london."

fache waved off the man with the cuffs. "is biggin hill his destination tonight?"

"i don't know," the controller said honestly. "the plane left on its usual tack, and his last radar
contact suggested the united kingdom. biggin hill is an extremely likely guess."

"did he have others onboard?"

"i swear, sir, there is no way for me to know that. our clients can drive directly to their hangars,
and load as they please. who is onboard is the responsibility of the customs officials at the
receiving airport."

fache checked his watch and gazed out at the scattering of jets parked in front of the terminal. "if
they're going to biggin hill, how long until they land?"

the controller fumbled through his records. "it's a short flight. his plane could be on the ground
by... around six-thirty. fifteen minutes from now."

fache frowned and turned to one of his men. "get a transport up here. i'm going to london. and
get me the kent local police. not british mi5. 1 want this quiet. kent local. tell them i want
teabing's plane to be permitted to land. then i want it surrounded on the tarmac. nobody deplanes
until i get there."



chapter 74

"you're quiet," langdon said, gazing across the hawker's cabin at sophie.

"just tired," she replied. "and the poem. i don't know."

langdon was feeling the same way. the hum of the engines and the gentle rocking of the plane
were hypnotic, and his head still throbbed where he'd been hit by the monk. teabing was still in the
back of the plane, and langdon decided to take advantage of the moment alone with sophie to tell
her something that had been on his mind. "i think i know part of the reason why your grandfather
conspired to put us together. i think there's something he wanted me to explain to you."

"the history of the holy grail and mary magdalene isn't enough?"



langdon felt uncertain how to proceed. "the rift between you. the reason you haven't spoken to
him in ten years. i think maybe he was hoping i could somehow make that right by explaining what
drove you apart."

sophie squirmed in her seat. "i haven't told you what drove us apart."

langdon eyed her carefully. "you witnessed a sex rite. didn't you?"

sophie recoiled. "how do you know that?"

"sophie, you told me you witnessed something that convinced you your grandfather was in a secret
society. and whatever you saw upset you enough that you haven't spoken to him since. i know a
fair amount about secret societies. it doesn't take the brains of da vinci to guess what you saw."

sophie stared.

"was it in the spring?" langdon asked. "sometime around the equinox? mid-march?"

sophie looked out the window. "i was on spring break from university. i came home a few days
early."

"you want to tell me about it?"

"i'd rather not." she turned suddenly back to langdon, her eyes welling with emotion. "i don't
know what i saw."

"were both men and women present?"

after a beat, she nodded.

"dressed in white and black?"

she wiped her eyes and then nodded, seeming to open up a little. "the women were in white
gossamer gowns... with golden shoes. they held golden orbs. the men wore black tunics and black
shoes."

langdon strained to hide his emotion, and yet he could not believe what he was hearing. sophie
neveu had unwittingly witnessed a two-thousand-year-old sacred ceremony. "masks?" he asked,
keeping his voice calm. "androgynous masks?"

"yes. everyone. identical masks. white on the women. black on the men."

langdon had read descriptions of this ceremony and understood its mystic roots. "it's called hieros



gamos," he said softly. "it dates back more than two thousand years. egyptian priests and
priestesses performed it regularly to celebrate the reproductive power of the female," he paused,
leaning toward her. "and if you witnessed hieros gamos without being properly prepared to
understand its meaning, i imagine it would be pretty shocking."

sophie said nothing.

"hieros gamos is greek," he continued. "it means sacred marriage. "

"the ritual i saw was no marriage."

"marriage as in union, sophie."

"you mean as in sex."

"no."

"no?" she said, her olive eyes testing him.

langdon backpedaled. "well... yes, in a manner of speaking, but not as we understand it today."
he explained that although what she saw probably looked like a sex ritual, hieros gamos had
nothing to do with eroticism. it was a spiritual act. historically, intercourse was the act through
which male and female experienced god. the ancients believed that the male was spiritually
incomplete until he had carnal knowledge of the sacred feminine. physical union with the female
remained the sole means through which man could become spiritually complete and ultimately
achieve gnosis — knowledge of the divine. since the days of isis, sex rites had been considered
man's only bridge from earth to heaven. "by communing with woman," langdon said, "man could
achieve a climactic instant when his mind went totally blank and he could see god. "

sophie looked skeptical. "orgasm as prayer?"

langdon gave a noncommittal shrug, although sophie was essentially correct. physiologically
speaking, the male climax was accompanied by a split second entirely devoid of thought. a brief
mental vacuum. a moment of clarity during which god could be glimpsed. meditation gurus
achieved similar states of thoughtlessness without sex and often described nirvana as a never-
ending spiritual orgasm.

"sophie," langdon said quietly, "it's important to remember that the ancients' view of sex was
entirely opposite from ours today. sex begot new life — the ultimate miracle — and miracles could
be performed only by a god. the ability of the woman to produce life from her womb made her
sacred. a god. intercourse was the revered union of the two halves of the human spirit — male and
female — through which the male could find spiritual wholeness and communion with god. what
you saw was not about sex, it was about spirituality. the hieros gamos ritual is not a perversion.



it's a deeply sacrosanct ceremony."

his words seemed to strike a nerve. sophie had been remarkably poised all evening, but now, for
the first time, langdon saw the aura of composure beginning to crack. tears materialized in her
eyes again, and she dabbed them away with her sleeve.

he gave her a moment. admittedly, the concept of sex as a pathway to god was mind-boggling at
first. langdon's jewish students always looked flabbergasted when he first told them that the early
jewish tradition involved ritualistic sex. in the temple, no less. early jews believed that the holy
of holies in solomon's temple housed not only god but also his powerful female equal, shekinah.
men seeking spiritual wholeness came to the temple to visit priestesses — or hierodules — with
whom they made love and experienced the divine through physical union. the jewish
tetragrammaton yhwh — the sacred name of god — in fact derived from jehovah, an androgynous
physical union between the masculine jah and the pre-hebraic name for eve, havah.

"for the early church," langdon explained in a soft voice, "mankind's use of sex to commune
directly with god posed a serious threat to the catholic power base. it left the church out of the
loop, undermining their self -proclaimed status as the sole conduit to god. for obvious reasons,
they worked hard to demonize sex and recast it as a disgusting and sinful act. other major religions
did the same."

sophie was silent, but langdon sensed she was starting to understand her grandfather better.
ironically, langdon had made this same point in a class lecture earlier this semester. "is it
surprising we feel conflicted about sex?" he asked his students. "our ancient heritage and our very
physiologies tell us sex is natural — a cherished route to spiritual fulfillment — and yet modern
religion decries it as shameful, teaching us to fear our sexual desire as the hand of the devil."

langdon decided not to shock his students with the fact that more than a dozen secret societies
around the world — many of them quite influential — still practiced sex rites and kept the ancient
traditions alive. tom cruise's character in the film eyes wide shut discovered this the hard way
when he sneaked into a private gathering of ultraelite manhattanites only to find himself witnessing
hieros gamos. sadly, the filmmakers had gotten most of the specifics wrong, but the basic gist was
there — a secret society communing to celebrate the magic of sexual union.

"professor langdon?" a male student in back raised his hand, sounding hopeful. "are you saying
that instead of going to chapel, we should have more sex?"

langdon chuckled, not about to take the bait. from what he'd heard about harvard parties, these
kids were having more than enough sex. "gentlemen," he said, knowing he was on tender ground,
"might i offer a suggestion for all of you. without being so bold as to condone premarital sex, and
without being so naive as to think you're all chaste angels, i will give you this bit of advice about
your sex lives."



all the men in the audience leaned forward, listening intently.

"the next time you find yourself with a woman, look in your heart and see if you cannot approach
sex as a mystical, spiritual act. challenge yourself to find that spark of divinity that man can only
achieve through union with the sacred feminine."

the women smiled knowingly, nodding.

the men exchanged dubious giggles and off-color jokes.

langdon sighed. college men were still boys.



sophie's forehead felt cold as she pressed it against the plane's window and stared blankly into the
void, trying to process what langdon had just told her. she felt a new regret well within her. ten
years. she pictured the stacks of unopened letters her grandfather had sent her. / will tell robert
everything. without turning from the window, sophie began to speak. quietly. fearfully.

as she began to recount what had happened that night, she felt herself drifting back... alighting in
the woods outside her grandfather's normandy chateau... searching the deserted house in
confusion... hearing the voices below her... and then finding the hidden door. she inched down the
stone staircase, one step at a time, into that basement grotto. she could taste the earthy air. cool
and light. it was march. in the shadows of her hiding place on the staircase, she watched as the
strangers swayed and chanted by flickering orange candles.

i'm dreaming, sophie told herself. this is a dream. what else could this be?

the women and men were staggered, black, white, black, white. the women's beautiful gossamer
gowns billowed as they raised in their right hands golden orbs and called out in unison, '7 was with
you in the beginning, in the dawn of all that is holy, i bore you from the womb before the start of
day."

the women lowered their orbs, and everyone rocked back and forth as if in a trance. they were
revering something in the center of the circle.

what are they looking at?

the voices accelerated now. louder. faster.

"the woman whom you behold is love!" the women called, raising their orbs again.

the men responded, "she has her dwelling in eternity! "



the chanting grew steady again. accelerating. thundering now. faster. the participants stepped
inward and knelt.

in that instant, sophie could finally see what they were all watching.

on a low, ornate altar in the center of the circle lay a man. he was naked, positioned on his back,
and wearing a black mask. sophie instantly recognized his body and the birthmark on his shoulder.
she almost cried out. grand-pere! this image alone would have shocked sophie beyond belief,
and yet there was more.

straddling her grandfather was a naked woman wearing a white mask, her luxuriant silver hair
flowing out behind it. her body was plump, far from perfect, and she was gyrating in rhythm to the
chanting — making love to sophie's grandfather.

sophie wanted to turn and run, but she couldn't. the stone walls of the grotto imprisoned her as the
chanting rose to a fever pitch. the circle of participants seemed almost to be singing now, the noise
rising in crescendo to a frenzy. with a sudden roar, the entire room seemed to erupt in climax.
sophie could not breathe. she suddenly realized she was quietly sobbing. she turned and staggered
silently up the stairs, out of the house, and drove trembling back to paris.



chapter 75

the chartered turboprop was just passing over the twinkling lights of monaco when aringarosa
hung up on fache for the second time. he reached for the airsickness bag again but felt too drained
even to be sick.

just let it be over!

fache's newest update seemed unfathomable, and yet almost nothing tonight made sense anymore.
what is going on ? everything had spiraled wildly out of control. what have i gotten silas into ?
what have i gotten myself into!

on shaky legs, aringarosa walked to the cockpit. "i need to change destinations."

the pilot glanced over his shoulder and laughed. "you're joking, right?"

"no. i have to get to london immediately."

"father, this is a charter flight, not a taxi."



"i will pay you extra, of course. how much? london is only one hour farther north and requires
almost no change of direction, so — "

"it's not a question of money, father, there are other issues."

"ten thousand euro. right now."

the pilot turned, his eyes wide with shock. "how much? what kind of priest carries that kind of
cash?"

aringarosa walked back to his black briefcase, opened it, and removed one of the bearer bonds. he
handed it to the pilot.

"what is this?" the pilot demanded.

"a ten-thousand-euro bearer bond drawn on the vatican bank."

the pilot looked dubious.

"it's the same as cash."

"only cash is cash," the pilot said, handing the bond back.

aringarosa felt weak as he steadied himself against the cockpit door. "this is a matter of life or
death. you must help me. i need to get to london."

the pilot eyed the bishop's gold ring. "real diamonds?"

aringarosa looked at the ring. "i could not possibly part with this."

the pilot shrugged, turning and focusing back out the windshield.

aringarosa felt a deepening sadness. he looked at the ring. everything it represented was about to
be lost to the bishop anyway. after a long moment, he slid the ring from his finger and placed it
gently on the instrument panel.

aringarosa slunk out of the cockpit and sat back down. fifteen seconds later, he could feel the pilot
banking a few more degrees to the north.

even so, aringarosa's moment of glory was in shambles.

it had all begun as a holy cause. a brilliantly crafted scheme. now, like a house of cards, it was
collapsing in on itself... and the end was nowhere in sight.



chapter 76

langdon could see sophie was still shaken from recounting her experience of hieros gamos. for
his part, langdon was amazed to have heard it. not only had sophie witnessed the full-blown
ritual, but her own grandfather had been the celebrant... the grand master of the priory of sion. it
was heady company. da vinci, botticelli, isaac newton, victor hugo, jean cocteau... jacques
sauniere.

"i don't know what else i can tell you," langdon said softly.

sophie's eyes were a deep green now, tearful. "he raised me like his own daughter."

langdon now recognized the emotion that had been growing in her eyes as they spoke. it was
remorse. distant and deep. sophie neveu had shunned her grandfather and was now seeing him in
an entirely different light.

outside, the dawn was coming fast, its crimson aura gathering off the starboard. the earth was still
black beneath them.

"victuals, my dears?" teabing rejoined them with a flourish, presenting several cans of coke and a
box of old crackers. he apologized profusely for the limited fare as he doled out the goods. "our
friend the monk isn't talking yet," he chimed, "but give him time." he bit into a cracker and eyed
the poem. "so, my lovely, any headway?" he looked at sophie. "what is your grandfather trying to
tell us here? where the devil is this headstone? this headstone praised by templars."

sophie shook her head and remained silent.

while teabing again dug into the verse, langdon popped a coke and turned to the window, his
thoughts awash with images of secret rituals and unbroken codes. a headstone praised by templars
is the key. he took a long sip from the can. a headstone praised by templars. the cola was warm.

the dissolving veil of night seemed to evaporate quickly, and as langdon watched the
transformation, he saw a shimmering ocean stretch out beneath them. the english channel. it
wouldn't be long now.

langdon willed the light of day to bring with it a second kind of illumination, but the lighter it
became outside, the further he felt from the truth. he heard the rhythms of iambic pentameter and
chanting, hieros gamos and sacred rites, resonating with the rumble of the jet.

a headstone praised by templars.



the plane was over land again when a flash of enlightenment struck him. langdon set down his
empty can of coke hard. "you won't believe this," he said, turning to the others. "the templar
headstone — i figured it out."

teabing's eyes turned to saucers. "you know where the headstone is?"

langdon smiled. "not where it is. what it is."

sophie leaned in to hear.

"i think the headstone references a literal stone head, " langdon explained, savoring the familiar
excitement of academic breakthrough. "not a grave marker."

"a stone head?" teabing demanded.

sophie looked equally confused.

"leigh," langdon said, turning, "during the inquisition, the church accused the knights templar
of all kinds of heresies, right?"

"correct. they fabricated all kinds of charges. sodomy, urination on the cross, devil worship, quite
a list."

"and on that list was the worship of false idols, right? specifically, the church accused the
templars of secretly performing rituals in which they prayed to a carved stone head... the pagan
god— "

"baphomet!" teabing blurted. "my heavens, robert, you're right! a headstone praised by
templars!"

langdon quickly explained to sophie that baphomet was a pagan fertility god associated with the
creative force of reproduction. baphomet's head was represented as that of a ram or goat, a
common symbol of procreation and fecundity. the templars honored baphomet by encircling a
stone replica of his head and chanting prayers.

"baphomet," teabing tittered. "the ceremony honored the creative magic of sexual union, but
pope clement convinced everyone that baphomet's head was in fact that of the devil. the pope
used the head of baphomet as the linchpin in his case against the templars."

langdon concurred. the modern belief in a homed devil known as satan could be traced back to
baphomet and the church's attempts to recast the horned fertility god as a symbol of evil. the
church had obviously succeeded, although not entirely. traditional american thanksgiving tables



still bore pagan, horned fertility symbols. the cornucopia or "horn of plenty" was a tribute to
baphomet's fertility and dated back to zeus being suckled by a goat whose horn broke off and
magically filled with fruit. baphomet also appeared in group photographs when some joker raised
two fingers behind a friend's head in the v-symbol of horns; certainly few of the pranksters
realized their mocking gesture was in fact advertising their victim's robust sperm count.

"yes, yes," teabing was saying excitedly. "baphomet must be what the poem is referring to. a
headstone praised by templars."

"okay," sophie said, "but if baphomet is the headstone praised by templars, then we have a new
dilemma." she pointed to the dials on the cryptex. "baphomet has eight letters. we only have room
for five. "

teabing grinned broadly. "my dear, this is where the atbash cipher comes into play"



chapter 77

langdon was impressed. teabing had just finished writing out the entire twenty-two-letter hebrew
alphabet — alef-beit — from memory. granted, he'd used roman equivalents rather than hebrew
characters, but even so, he was now reading through them with flawless pronunciation.

abgdhvzchtyklmnsoptzqrshth

"alef, beit, gimel, dalet, hei, vav, zayin, chet, tet, yud, kaf, lamed, mem, nun, samech, ayin,
pei, tzadik, kuf, reish, shin, and tav. " teabing dramatically mopped his brow and plowed on. "in
formal hebrew spelling, the vowel sounds are not written. therefore, when we write the word
baphomet using the hebrew alphabet, it will lose its three vowels in translation, leaving us — "

"five letters," sophie blurted.

teabing nodded and began writing again. "okay, here is the proper spelling of baphomet in
hebrew letters. i'll sketch in the missing vowels for clarity's sake.

bapvometh



"remember, of course," he added, "that hebrew is normally written in the opposite direction, but
we can just as easily use atbash this way. next, all we have to do is create our substitution scheme
by rewriting the entire alphabet in reverse order opposite the original alphabet."

"there's an easier way," sophie said, taking the pen from teabing. "it works for all reflectional



substitution ciphers, including the atbash. a little trick i learned at the royal holloway." sophie
wrote the first half of the alphabet from left to right, and then, beneath it, wrote the second half,
right to left. "cryptanalysts call it the fold-over. half as complicated. twice as clean."

teabing eyed her handiwork and chuckled. "right you are. glad to see those boys at the holloway
are doing their job."

looking at sophie's substitution matrix, langdon felt a rising thrill that he imagined must have
rivaled the thrill felt by early scholars when they first used the atbash cipher to decrypt the now
famous mystery of sheshach. for years, religious scholars had been baffled by biblical references
to a city called sheshach. the city did not appear on any map nor in any other documents, and yet
it was mentioned repeatedly in the book of jeremiah — the king of sheshach, the city of sheshach,
the people of sheshach. finally, a scholar applied the atbash cipher to the word, and his results
were mind-numbing. the cipher revealed that sheshach was in fact a code word for another very
well-known city. the decryption process was simple.

sheshach, in hebrew, was spelled: sh-sh-k.

sh-sh-k, when placed in the substitution matrix, became b-b-l.

b-b-l, in hebrew, spelled babel.

the mysterious city of sheshach was revealed as the city of babel, and a frenzy of biblical
examination ensued. within weeks, several more atbash code words were uncovered in the old
testament, unveiling myriad hidden meanings that scholars had no idea were there.

"we're getting close," langdon whispered, unable to control his excitement.

"inches, robert," teabing said. he glanced over at sophie and smiled. "you ready?"

she nodded.

"okay, baphomet in hebrew without the vowels reads: b-p-v-m-th. now we simply apply your
atbash substitution matrix to translate the letters into our five-letter password."



langdon's heart pounded. b-p-v-m-th. the sun was pouring through the windows now. he looked
at sophie's substitution matrix and slowly began to make the conversion. b is sh... p is v...



teabing was grinning like a schoolboy at christmas. "and the atbash cipher reveals..." he
stopped short. "good god!" his face went white.

langdon's head snapped up.

"what's wrong?" sophie demanded.

"you won't believe this." teabing glanced at sophie. "especially you."

"what do you mean?" she said.

"this is... ingenious," he whispered. "utterly ingenious!" teabing wrote again on the paper.
"drumroll, please. here is your password." he showed them what he had written.

sh-v-p-y-a

sophie scowled. "what is it?"

langdon didn't recognize it either.

teabing's voice seemed to tremble with awe. "this, my friend, is actually an ancient word of
wisdom."

langdon read the letters again. an ancient word of wisdom frees this scroll. an instant later he got
it. he had newer seen this coming. "an ancient word of wisdom!"

teabing was laughing. "quite literally!"

sophie looked at the word and then at the dial. immediately she realized langdon and teabing had
failed to see a serious glitch. "hold on! this can't be the password," she argued. "the cryptex
doesn't have an sh on the dial. it uses a traditional roman alphabet. "

"read the word," langdon urged. "keep in mind two things. in hebrew, the symbol for the sound
sh can also be pronounced as s, depending on the accent. just as the letter p can be pronounced f."

svfya? she thought, puzzled.

"genius!" teabing added. "the letter vav is often a placeholder for the vowel sound o!"

sophie again looked at the letters, attempting to sound them out.

"s...o...f...y...a."



she heard the sound of her voice, and could not believe what she had just said. "sophia? this
spells sophia?"

langdon was nodding enthusiastically. "yes! sophia literally means wisdom in greek. the root of
your name, sophie, is literally a 'word of wisdom.' "

sophie suddenly missed her grandfather immensely. he encrypted the priory keystone with my
name. a knot caught in her throat. it all seemed so perfect. but as she turned her gaze to the five
lettered dials on the cryptex, she realized a problem still existed. "but wait... the word sophia has
six letters."

teabing's smile never faded. "look at the poem again. your grandfather wrote, 'an ancient word
of wisdom.' "

"yes?"

teabing winked. "in ancient greek, wisdom is spelled s-o-f-i-a."



chapter 78

sophie felt a wild excitement as she cradled the cryptex and began dialing in the letters. an ancient
word of wisdom frees this scroll. langdon and teabing seemed to have stopped breathing as they
looked on.

s... o...f...

"carefully," teabing urged. "ever so carefully."

...i... a.

sophie aligned the final dial. "okay," she whispered, glancing up at the others. "i'm going to pull it
apart."

"remember the vinegar," langdon whispered with fearful exhilaration. "be careful."

sophie knew that if this cryptex were like those she had opened in her youth, all she would need to
do is grip the cylinder at both ends, just beyond the dials, and pull, applying slow, steady pressure
in opposite directions. if the dials were properly aligned with the password, then one of the ends
would slide off, much like a lens cap, and she could reach inside and remove the rolled papyrus
document, which would be wrapped around the vial of vinegar. however, if the password they had



entered were incorrect, sophie's outward force on the ends would be transferred to a hinged lever
inside, which would pivot downward into the cavity and apply pressure to the glass vial, eventually
shattering it if she pulled too hard.

pull gently, she told herself.

teabing and langdon both leaned in as sophie wrapped her palms around the ends of the cylinder.
in the excitement of deciphering the code word, sophie had almost forgotten what they expected to
find inside. this is the priory keystone. according to teabing, it contained a map to the holy grail,
unveiling the tomb of mary magdalene and the sangreal treasure... the ultimate treasure trove of
secret truth.

now gripping the stone tube, sophie double-checked that all of the letters were properly aligned
with the indicator. then, slowly, she pulled. nothing happened. she applied a little more force.
suddenly, the stone slid apart like a well-crafted telescope. the heavy end piece detached in her
hand. langdon and teabing almost jumped to their feet. sophie's heart rate climbed as she set the
end cap on the table and tipped the cylinder to peer inside.

a scroll!

peering down the hollow of the rolled paper, sophie could see it had been wrapped around a
cylindrical object — the vial of vinegar, she assumed. strangely, though, the paper around the
vinegar was not the customary delicate papyrus but rather, vellum. that's odd, she thought, vinegar
can 't dissolve a lambskin vellum. she looked again down the hollow of the scroll and realized the
object in the center was not a vial of vinegar after all. it was something else entirely.

"what's wrong?" teabing asked. "pull out the scroll."

frowning, sophie grabbed the rolled vellum and the object around which it was wrapped, pulling
them both out of the container.

"that's not papyrus," teabing said. "it's too heavy."

"i know. it's padding."

"for what? the vial of vinegar?"

"no." sophie unrolled the scroll and revealed what was wrapped inside. "for this. "

when langdon saw the object inside the sheet of vellum, his heart sank.

"god help us," teabing said, slumping. "your grandfather was a pitiless architect."



langdon stared in amazement. / see sauniere has no intention of making this easy.

on the table sat a second cryptex. smaller. made of black onyx. it had been nested within the first.
sauniere's passion for dualism. two cryptexes. everything in pairs. double entendres. male female.
black nested within white. langdon felt the web of symbolism stretching onward. white gives birth
to black.

every man sprang from woman.

white — female.

black — male.

reaching over, langdon lifted the smaller cryptex. it looked identical to the first, except half the
size and black. he heard the familiar gurgle. apparently, the vial of vinegar they had heard earlier
was inside this smaller cryptex.

"well, robert," teabing said, sliding the page of vellum over to him.

"you'll be pleased to hear that at least we're flying in the right direction."

langdon examined the thick vellum sheet. written in ornate penmanship was another four-line
verse. again, in iambic pentameter. the verse was cryptic, but langdon needed to read only as far
as the first line to realize that teabing's plan to come to britain was going to pay off.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.



the remainder of the poem clearly implied that the password for opening the second cryptex could
be found by visiting this knight's tomb, somewhere in the city.

langdon turned excitedly to teabing. "do you have any idea what knight this poem is referring
t0? „

teabing grinned. "not the foggiest. but i know in precisely which crypt we should look."



at that moment, fifteen miles ahead of them, six kent police cars streaked down rain-soaked
streets toward biggin hill executive airport.



chapter 79

lieutenant collet helped himself to a perrier from teabing's refrigerator and strode back out
through the drawing room. rather than accompanying fache to london where the action was, he
was now baby-sitting the pts team that had spread out through chateau villette.

so far, the evidence they had uncovered was unhelpful: a single bullet buried in the floor; a paper
with several symbols scrawled on it along with the words blade and chalice; and a bloody spiked
belt that pts had told collet was associated with the conservative catholic group opus dei, which
had caused a stir recently when a news program exposed their aggressive recruiting practices in
paris.

collet sighed. good luck making sense of this unlikely melange.

moving down a lavish hallway, collet entered the vast ballroom study, where the chief pts
examiner was busy dusting for fingerprints. he was a corpulent man in suspenders.

"anything?" collet asked, entering.

the examiner shook his head. "nothing new. multiple sets matching those in the rest of the house."

"how about the prints on the cilice belt?"

"interpol is still working. i uploaded everything we found."

collet motioned to two sealed evidence bags on the desk. "and this?"

the man shrugged. "force of habit. i bag anything peculiar."

collet walked over. peculiar?

"this brit's a strange one," the examiner said. "have a look at this." he sifted through the evidence
bags and selected one, handing it to collet.

the photo showed the main entrance of a gothic cathedral — the traditional, recessed archway,
narrowing through multiple, ribbed layers to a small doorway.

collet studied the photo and turned. "this is peculiar?"

"turn it over."

on the back, collet found notations scrawled in english, describing a cathedral's long hollow nave
as a secret pagan tribute to a woman's womb. this was strange. the notation describing the



cathedral's doorway, however, was what startled him. "hold on! he thinks a cathedral's entrance
represents a woman's..."

the examiner nodded. "complete with receding labial ridges and a nice little cinquefoil clitoris
above the doorway." he sighed. "kind of makes you want to go back to church."

collet picked up the second evidence bag. through the plastic, he could see a large glossy
photograph of what appeared to be an old document. the heading at the top read:

les dossiers secrets — number 4° im 1 249

"what's this?" collet asked.

"no idea. he's got copies of it all over the place, so i bagged it."

collet studied the document.

prieure de sion ? collet wondered.

"lieutenant?" another agent stuck his head in. "the switchboard has an urgent call for captain
fache, but they can't reach him. will you take it?"

collet returned to the kitchen and took the call.

it was andre vernet.

the banker's refined accent did little to mask the tension in his voice. "i thought captain fache said
he would call me, but i have not yet heard from him."

"the captain is quite busy," collet replied. "may i help you?"

"i was assured i would be kept abreast of your progress tonight."

for a moment, collet thought he recognized the timbre of the man's voice, but he couldn't quite
place it. "monsieur vernet, i am currently in charge of the paris investigation. my name is
lieutenant collet."

there was a long pause on the line. "lieutenant, i have another call coming in. please excuse me. i
will call you later." he hung up.

for several seconds, collet held the receiver. then it dawned on him. / knew i recognized that
voice! the revelation made him gasp.

the armored car driver.

with the fake rolex.

collet now understood why the banker had hung up so quickly. vernet had remembered the name
lieutenant collet — the officer he blatantly lied to earlier tonight.



collet pondered the implications of this bizarre development. vernet is involved. instinctively, he
knew he should call fache. emotionally, he knew this lucky break was going to be his moment to
shine.

he immediately called interpol and requested every shred of information they could find on the
depository bank of zurich and its president, andre vernet.



chapter 80

"seat belts, please," teabing's pilot announced as the hawker 731 descended into a gloomy
morning drizzle. "we'll be landing in five minutes."

teabing felt a joyous sense of homecoming when he saw the misty hills of kent spreading wide
beneath the descending plane. england was less than an hour from paris, and yet a world away.
this morning, the damp, spring green of his homeland looked particularly welcoming. my time in
france is over. i am returning to england victorious. the keystone has been found. the question
remained, of course, as to where the keystone would ultimately lead. somewhere in the united
kingdom. where exactly, teabing had no idea, but he was already tasting the glory.

as langdon and sophie looked on, teabing got up and went to the far side of the cabin, then slid
aside a wall panel to reveal a discreetly hidden wall safe. he dialed in the combination, opened the
safe, and extracted two passports. "documentation for rimy and myself." he then removed a thick
stack of fifty-pound notes. "and documentation for you two."

sophie looked leery. "a bribe?"

"creative diplomacy. executive airfields make certain allowances. a british customs official will
greet us at my hangar and ask to board the plane. rather than permitting him to come on, i'll tell
him i'm traveling with a french celebrity who prefers that nobody knows she is in england — press
considerations, you know — and i'll offer the official this generous tip as gratitude for his
discretion."

langdon looked amazed. "and the official will accept?"

"not from anyone, they won't, but these people all know me. i'm not an arms dealer, for heaven's
sake. i was knighted." teabing smiled. "membership has its privileges."

remy approached up the aisle now, the heckler koch pistol cradled in his hand. "sir, my agenda?"

teabing glanced at his servant. "i'm going to have you stay onboard with our guest until we return.



we can't very well drag him all over london with us."

sophie looked wary. "leigh, i was serious about the french police finding your plane before we
return. "

teabing laughed. "yes, imagine their surprise if they board and find remy."

sophie looked surprised by his cavalier attitude. "leigh, you transported a bound hostage across
international borders. this is serious."

"so are my lawyers." he scowled toward the monk in the rear of the plane. "that animal broke into
my home and almost killed me. that is a fact, and remy will corroborate."

"but you tied him up and flew him to london!" langdon said.

teabing held up his right hand and feigned a courtroom oath. "your honor, forgive an eccentric old
knight his foolish prejudice for the british court system. i realize i should have called the french
authorities, but i'm a snob and do not trust those laissez-faire french to prosecute properly. this
man almost murdered me. yes, i made a rash decision forcing my manservant to help me bring him
to england, but i was under great stress. mea culpa. mea culpa."

langdon looked incredulous. "coming from you, leigh, that just might fly."

"sir?" the pilot called back. "the tower just radioed. they've got some kind of maintenance
problem out near your hangar, and they're asking me to bring the plane directly to the terminal
instead."

teabing had been flying to biggin hill for over a decade, and this was a first. "did they mention
what the problem is?"

"the controller was vague. something about a gas leak at the pumping station? they asked me to
park in front of the terminal and keep everyone onboard until further notice. safety precaution.
we're not supposed to deplane until we get the all clear from airport authorities."

teabing was skeptical. must be one hell of a gas leak. the pumping station was a good half mile
from his hangar.

remy also looked concerned. "sir, this sounds highly irregular."

teabing turned to sophie and langdon. "my friends, i have an unpleasant suspicion that we are
about to be met by a welcoming committee."

langdon gave a bleak sigh. "i guess fache still thinks i'm his man."



"either that," sophie said, "or he is too deep into this to admit his error.

teabing was not listening. regardless of fache's mind-set, action needed to be taken fast. don't
lose sight of the ultimate goal. the grail. we're so dose. below them, the landing gear descended
with a clunk.

"leigh," langdon said, sounding deeply remorseful, "i should turn myself in and sort this out
legally. leave you all out of it. "

"oh, heavens, robert!" teabing waved it off. "do you really think they're going to let the rest of us
go? i just transported you illegally. miss neveu assisted in your escape from the louvre, and we
have a man tied up in the back of the plane. really now! we're all in this together."

"maybe a different airport?" sophie said.

teabing shook his head. "if we pull up now, by the time we get clearance anywhere else, our
welcoming party will include army tanks."

sophie slumped.

teabing sensed that if they were to have any chance of postponing confrontation with the british
authorities long enough to find the grail, bold action had to be taken. "give me a minute," he said,
hobbling toward the cockpit.

"what are you doing?" langdon asked.

"sales meeting," teabing said, wondering how much it would cost him to persuade his pilot to
perform one highly irregular maneuver.



chapter 81

the hawker is on final approach.

simon edwards — executive services officer at biggin hill airport — paced the control tower,
squinting nervously at the rain-drenched runway. he never appreciated being awoken early on a
saturday morning, but it was particularly distasteful that he had been called in to oversee the arrest
of one of his most lucrative clients. sir leigh teabing paid biggin hill not only for a private
hangar but a "per landing fee" for his frequent arrivals and departures. usually, the airfield had
advance warning of his schedule and was able to follow a strict protocol for his arrival. teabing
liked things just so. the custom-built jaguar stretch limousine that he kept in his hangar was to be



fully gassed, polished, and the day's london times laid out on the back seat. a customs official
was to be waiting for the plane at the hangar to expedite the mandatory documentation and luggage
check. occasionally, customs agents accepted large tips from teabing in exchange for turning a
blind eye to the transport of harmless organics — mostly luxury foods — french escargots, a
particularly ripe unprocessed roquefort, certain fruits. many customs laws were absurd, anyway,
and if biggin hill didn't accommodate its clients, certainly competing airfields would. teabing was
provided with what he wanted here at biggin hill, and the employees reaped the benefits.

edwards's nerves felt frayed now as he watched the jet coming in. he wondered if teabing's
penchant for spreading the wealth had gotten him in trouble somehow; the french authorities
seemed very intent on containing him. edwards had not yet been told what the charges were, but
they were obviously serious. at the french authorities' request, kent police had ordered the biggin
hill air traffic controller to radio the hawker's pilot and order him directly to the terminal rather
than to the client's hangar. the pilot had agreed, apparently believing the far-fetched story of a gas
leak.

though the british police did not generally carry weapons, the gravity of the situation had brought
out an armed response team. now, eight policemen with handguns stood just inside the terminal
building, awaiting the moment when the plane's engines powered down. the instant this happened,
a runway attendant would place safety wedges under the tires so the plane could no longer move.
then the police would step into view and hold the occupants at bay until the french police arrived
to handle the situation.

the hawker was low in the sky now, skimming the treetops to their right. simon edwards went
downstairs to watch the landing from tarmac level. the kent police were poised, just out of sight,
and the maintenance man waited with his wedges. out on the runway, the hawker's nose tipped up,
and the tires touched down in a puff of smoke. the plane settled in for deceleration, streaking from
right to left in front of the terminal, its white hull glistening in the wet weather. but rather than
braking and turning into the terminal, the jet coasted calmly past the access lane and continued on
toward teabing's hangar in the distance.

all the police spun and stared at edwards. "i thought you said the pilot agreed to come to the
terminal ! "

edwards was bewildered. "he did!"

seconds later, edwards found himself wedged in a police car racing across the tarmac toward the
distant hangar. the convoy of police was still a good five hundred yards away as teabing's hawker
taxied calmly into the private hangar and disappeared. when the cars finally arrived and skidded to
a stop outside the gaping hangar door, the police poured out, guns drawn.

edwards jumped out too.



the noise was deafening.

the hawker's engines were still roaring as the jet finished its usual rotation inside the hangar,
positioning itself nose-out in preparation for later departure. as the plane completed its 180-degree
turn and rolled toward the front of the hangar, edwards could see the pilot's face, which
understandably looked surprised and fearful to see the barricade of police cars.

the pilot brought the plane to a final stop, and powered down the engines. the police streamed in,
taking up positions around the jet. edwards joined the kent chief inspector, who moved warily
toward the hatch. after several seconds, the fuselage door popped open.

leigh teabing appeared in the doorway as the plane's electronic stairs smoothly dropped down. as
he gazed out at the sea of weapons aimed at him, he propped himself on his crutches and scratched
his head. "simon, did i win the policemen's lottery while i was away?" he sounded more
bewildered than concerned.

simon edwards stepped forward, swallowing the frog in his throat. "good morning, sir. i apologize
for the confusion. we've had a gas leak and your pilot said he was coming to the terminal."

"yes, yes, well, i told him to come here instead. i'm late for an appointment. i pay for this hangar,
and this rubbish about avoiding a gas leak sounded overcautious."

"i'm afraid your arrival has taken us a bit off guard, sir."

"i know. i'm off my schedule, i am. between you and me, the new medication gives me the tinkles.
thought i'd come over for a tune-up."

the policemen all exchanged looks. edwards winced. "very good, sir."

"sir," the kent chief inspector said, stepping forward. "i need to ask you to stay onboard for
another half hour or so."

teabing looked unamused as he hobbled down the stairs. "i'm afraid that is impossible. i have a
medical appointment." he reached the tarmac. "i cannot afford to miss it."

the chief inspector repositioned himself to block teabing's progress away from the plane. "i am
here at the orders of the french judicial police. they claim you are transporting fugitives from the
law on this plane."

teabing stared at the chief inspector a long moment, and then burst out laughing. "is this one of
those hidden camera programs? jolly good!"

the chief inspector never flinched. "this is serious, sir. the french police claim you also may have



a hostage onboard."

teabing's manservant remy appeared in the doorway at the top of the stairs. "i feel like a hostage
working for sir leigh, but he assures me i am free to go." remy checked his watch. "master, we
really are running late." he nodded toward the jaguar stretch limousine in the far corner of the
hangar. the enormous automobile was ebony with smoked glass and whitewall tires. "i'll bring the
car." remy started down the stairs.

"i'm afraid we cannot let you leave," the chief inspector said. "please return to your aircraft. both
of you. representatives from the french police will be landing shortly."

teabing looked now toward simon edwards. "simon, for heaven's sake, this is ridiculous! we
don't have anyone else on board. just the usual — remy, our pilot, and myself. perhaps you could
act as an intermediary? go have a look onboard, and verify that the plane is empty."

edwards knew he was trapped. "yes, sir. i can have a look."

"the devil you will!" the kent chief inspector declared, apparently knowing enough about
executive airfields to suspect simon edwards might well lie about the plane's occupants in an effort
to keep teabing's business at biggin hill. "i will look myself."

teabing shook his head. "no you won't, inspector. this is private property and until you have a
search warrant, you will stay off my plane. i am offering you a reasonable option here. mr.
edwards can perform the inspection."

"no deal."

teabing's demeanor turned frosty. "inspector, i'm afraid i don't have time to indulge in your games.
i'm late, and i'm leaving. if it is that important to you to stop me, you'll just have to shoot me."
with that, teabing and remy walked around the chief inspector and headed across the hangar
toward the parked limousine.



the kent chief inspector felt only distaste for leigh teabing as the man hobbled around him in
defiance. men of privilege always felt like they were above the law.

they are not. the chief inspector turned and aimed at teabing's back. "stop! i will fire!"

"go ahead," teabing said without breaking stride or glancing back. "my lawyers will fricassee
your testicles for breakfast. and if you dare board my plane without a warrant, your spleen will
follow."



no stranger to power plays, the chief inspector was unimpressed. technically, teabing was correct
and the police needed a warrant to board his jet, but because the flight had originated in france,
and because the powerful bezu fache had given his authority, the kent chief inspector felt certain
his career would be far better served by finding out what it was on this plane that teabing seemed
so intent on hiding.

"stop them," the inspector ordered. "i'm searching the plane."

his men raced over, guns leveled, and physically blocked teabing and his servant from reaching
the limousine.

now teabing turned. "inspector, this is your last warning. do not even think of boarding that
plane. you will regret it."

ignoring the threat, the chief inspector gripped his sidearm and marched up the plane's gangway.
arriving at the hatch, he peered inside. after a moment, he stepped into the cabin. what the devil?

with the exception of the frightened-looking pilot in the cockpit, the aircraft was empty. entirely
devoid of human life. quickly checking the bathroom, the chairs, and the luggage areas, the
inspector found no traces of anyone hiding... much less multiple individuals.

what the hell was bezu fache thinking? it seemed leigh teabing had been telling the truth.

the kent chief inspector stood alone in the deserted cabin and swallowed hard. shit. his face
flushed, he stepped back onto the gangway, gazing across the hangar at leigh teabing and his
servant, who were now under gunpoint near the limousine. "let them go," the inspector ordered.
"we received a bad tip."

teabing's eyes were menacing even across the hangar. "you can expect a call from my lawyers.
and for future reference, the french police cannot be trusted. "

with that, teabing's manservant opened the door at the rear of the stretch limousine and helped his
crippled master into the back seat. then the servant walked the length of the car, climbed in behind
the wheel, and gunned the engine. policemen scattered as the jaguar peeled out of the hangar.



"well played, my good man," teabing chimed from the rear seat as the limousine accelerated out
of the airport. he turned his eyes now to the dimly lit front recesses of the spacious interior.
"everyone comfy?"

langdon gave a weak nod. he and sophie were still crouched on the floor beside the bound and
gagged albino.



moments earlier, as the hawker taxied into the deserted hangar, remy had popped the hatch as the
plane jolted to a stop halfway through its turn. with the police closing in fast, langdon and sophie
dragged the monk down the gangway to ground level and out of sight behind the limousine. then
the jet engines had roared again, rotating the plane and completing its turn as the police cars came
skidding into the hangar.

now, as the limousine raced toward kent, langdon and sophie clambered toward the rear of the
limo's long interior, leaving the monk bound on the floor. they settled onto the long seat facing
teabing. the brit gave them both a roguish smile and opened the cabinet on the limo's bar. "could
i offer you a drink? some nibblies? crisps? nuts? seltzer?"

sophie and langdon both shook their heads.

teabing grinned and closed the bar. "so then, about this knight's tomb..."



chapter 82

"fleet street?" langdon asked, eyeing teabing in the back of the limo. there's a crypt on fleet
street? so far, leigh was being playfully cagey about where he thought they would find the
"knight's tomb," which, according to the poem, would provide the password for opening the
smaller cryptex.

teabing grinned and turned to sophie. "miss neveu, give the harvard boy one more shot at the
verse, will you?"

sophie fished in her pocket and pulled out the black cryptex, which was wrapped in the vellum.
everyone had decided to leave the rosewood box and larger cryptex behind in the plane's
strongbox, carrying with them only what they needed, the far more portable and discreet black
cryptex. sophie unwrapped the vellum and handed the sheet to langdon.

although langdon had read the poem several times onboard the jet, he had been unable to extract
any specific location. now, as he read the words again, he processed them slowly and carefully,
hoping the pentametric rhythms would reveal a clearer meaning now that he was on the ground.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.

his labor's fruit a holy wrath incurred.

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.

it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb.



the language seemed simple enough. there was a knight buried in london. a knight who labored
at something that angered the church. a knight whose tomb was missing an orb that should be
present. the poem's final reference — rosy flesh and seeded womb — was a clear allusion to mary
magdalene, the rose who bore the seed of jesus.

despite the apparent straightforwardness of the verse, langdon still had no idea who this knight
was or where he was buried. moreover, once they located the tomb, it sounded as if they would be
searching for something that was absent. the orb that ought be on his tomb ?

"no thoughts?" teabing clucked in disappointment, although langdon sensed the royal historian
was enjoying being one up. "miss neveu?"

she shook her head.

"what would you two do without me?" teabing said. "very well, i will walk you through it. it's
quite simple really. the first line is the key. would you read it please?"

langdon read aloud. " 'in london lies a knight a pope interred.' "

"precisely. a knight a pope interred." he eyed langdon. "what does that mean to you?"

langdon shrugged. "a knight buried by a pope? a knight whose funeral was presided over by a
pope?"

teabing laughed loudly. "oh, that's rich. always the optimist, robert. look at the second line.
this knight obviously did something that incurred the holy wrath of the church. think again.
consider the dynamic between the church and the knights templar. a knight a pope interred?"

"a knight a pope killed?" sophie asked.

teabing smiled and patted her knee. "well done, my dear. a knight a pope buried. or killed."

langdon thought of the notorious templar round-up in 1307 — unlucky friday the

thirteenth — when pope clement killed and interred hundreds of knights templar. "but there must

be endless graves of 'knights killed by popes.' "

"aha, not so! "teabing said. "many of them were burned at the stake and tossed unceremoniously
into the tiber river. but this poem refers to a tomb. a tomb in london. and there are few knights
buried in london. " he paused, eyeing langdon as if waiting for light to dawn. finally he huffed.
"robert, for heaven's sake! the church built in london by the priory's military arm — the knights
templar themselves ! "

"the temple church?" langdon drew a startled breath. "it has a crypt?"



"ten of the most frightening tombs you will ever see."

langdon had never actually visited the temple church, although he'd come across numerous
references in his priory research. once the epicenter of all templar/priory activities in the united
kingdom, the temple church had been so named in honor of solomon's temple, from which the
knights templar had extracted their own title, as well as the sangreal documents that gave them all
their influence in rome. tales abounded of knights performing strange, secretive rituals within the
temple church's unusual sanctuary. "the temple church is on fleet street?"

"actually, it's just off fleet street on inner temple lane." teabing looked mischievous. "i wanted
to see you sweat a little more before i gave it away."

"thanks."

"neither of you has ever been there?"

sophie and langdon shook their heads.

"i'm not surprised," teabing said. "the church is hidden now behind much larger buildings. few
people even know it's there. eerie old place. the architecture is pagan to the core."

sophie looked surprised. "pagan?"

"pantheonically pagan!" teabing exclaimed. "the church is round. the templars ignored the
traditional christian cruciform layout and built a perfectly circular church in honor of the sun." his
eyebrows did a devilish dance. "a not so subtle howdy-do to the boys in rome. they might as well
have resurrected stonehenge in downtown london."

sophie eyed teabing. "what about the rest of the poem?"

the historian's mirthful air faded. "i'm not sure. it's puzzling. we will need to examine each of the
ten tombs carefully. with luck, one of them will have a conspicuously absent orb."

langdon realized how close they really were. if the missing orb revealed the password, they would
be able to open the second cryptex. he had a hard time imagining what they might find inside.

langdon eyed the poem again. it was like some kind of primordial crossword puzzle. a five-letter
word that speaks of the grail? on the plane, they had already tried all the obvious
passwords— grail, graal, greal, venus, maria, jesus, sarah— but the cylinder had
not budged. far too obvious. apparently there existed some other five-letter reference to the rose's
seeded womb. the fact that the word was eluding a specialist like leigh teabing signified to
langdon that it was no ordinary grail reference.



"sir leigh?" remy called over his shoulder. he was watching them in the rearview mirror through
the open divider. "you said fleet street is near blackfriars bridge?"

"yes, take victoria embankment."

"i'm sorry. i'm not sure where that is. we usually go only to the hospital."

teabing rolled his eyes at langdon and sophie and grumbled, "i swear, sometimes it's like baby-
sitting a child. one moment please. help yourself to a drink and savory snacks." he left them,
clambering awkwardly toward the open divider to talk to remy.

sophie turned to langdon now, her voice quiet. "robert, nobody knows you and i are in england."

langdon realized she was right. the kent police would tell fache the plane was empty, and fache
would have to assume they were still in france. we are invisible. leigh's little stunt had just bought
them a lot of time.

"fache will not give up easily," sophie said. "he has too much riding on this arrest now."

langdon had been trying not to think about fache. sophie had promised she would do everything
in her power to exonerate langdon once this was over, but langdon was starting to fear it might
not matter. fache could easily be pan of this plot. although langdon could not imagine the
judicial police tangled up in the holy grail, he sensed too much coincidence tonight to disregard
fache as a possible accomplice. fache is religions, and he is intent on pinning these murders on
me. then again, sophie had argued that fache might simply be overzealous to make the arrest.
after all, the evidence against langdon was substantial. in addition to langdon's name scrawled on
the louvre floor and in sauniere's date book, langdon now appeared to have lied about his
manuscript and then run away. at sophie 's suggestion.

"robert, i'm sorry you're so deeply involved," sophie said, placing her hand on his knee. "but i'm
very glad you're here."

the comment sounded more pragmatic than romantic, and yet langdon felt an unexpected flicker
of attraction between them. he gave her a tired smile. "i'm a lot more fun when i've slept."

sophie was silent for several seconds. "my grandfather asked me to trust you. i'm glad i listened to
him for once."

"your grandfather didn't even know me."

"even so, i can't help but think you've done everything he would have wanted. you helped me find
the keystone, explained the sangreal, told me about the ritual in the basement." she paused.
"somehow i feel closer to my grandfather tonight than i have in years. i know he would be happy



about that."

in the distance, now, the skyline of london began to materialize through the dawn drizzle. once
dominated by big ben and tower bridge, the horizon now bowed to the millennium eye — a
colossal, ultramodern ferris wheel that climbed five hundred feet and afforded breathtaking views
of the city. langdon had attempted to board it once, but the "viewing capsules" reminded him of
sealed sarcophagi, and he opted to keep his feet on the ground and enjoy the view from the airy
banks of the thames.

langdon felt a squeeze on his knee, pulling him back, and sophie's green eyes were on him. he
realized she had been speaking to him. "what do you think we should do with the sangreal
documents if we ever find them?" she whispered.

"what i think is immaterial," langdon said. "your grandfather gave the cryptex to you, and you
should do with it what your instinct tells you he would want done."

"i'm asking for your opinion. you obviously wrote something in that manuscript that made my
grandfather trust your judgment. he scheduled a private meeting with you. that's rare."

"maybe he wanted to tell me i have it all wrong."

"why would he tell me to find you unless he liked your ideas? in your manuscript, did you support
the idea that the sangreal documents should be revealed or stay buried?"

"neither. i made no judgment either way. the manuscript deals with the symbology of the sacred
feminine — tracing her iconography throughout history. i certainly didn't presume to know where
the grail is hidden or whether it should ever be revealed. "

"and yet you're writing a book about it, so you obviously feel the information should be shared."

"there's an enormous difference between hypothetically discussing an alternate history of christ,
and..." he paused.

"and what?"

"and presenting to the world thousands of ancient documents as scientific evidence that the new
testament is false testimony."

"but you told me the new testament is based on fabrications."

langdon smiled. "sophie, every faith in the world is based on fabrication. that is the definition of
faith — acceptance of that which we imagine to be true, that which we cannot prove. every religion
describes god through metaphor, allegory, and exaggeration, from the early egyptians through



modern sunday school. metaphors are a way to help our minds process the unprocessible. the
problems arise when we begin to believe literally in our own metaphors."

"so you are in favor of the sangreal documents staying buried forever?"

"i'm a historian. i'm opposed to the destruction of documents, and i would love to see religious
scholars have more information to ponder the exceptional life of jesus christ."

"you're arguing both sides of my question."

"am i? the bible represents a fundamental guidepost for millions of people on the planet, in much
the same way the koran, torah, and pali canon offer guidance to people of other religions. if you
and i could dig up documentation that contradicted the holy stories of islamic belief, judaic belief,
buddhist belief, pagan belief, should we do that? should we wave a flag and tell the buddhists that
we have proof the buddha did not come from a lotus blossom? or that jesus was not born of a
literal virgin birth? those who truly understand their faiths understand the stories are
metaphorical."

sophie looked skeptical. "my friends who are devout christians definitely believe that christ
literally walked on water, literally turned water into wine, and was born of a literal virgin birth."

"my point exactly," langdon said. "religious allegory has become apart of the fabric of reality.
and living in that reality helps millions of people cope and be better people."

"but it appears their reality is false."

langdon chuckled. "no more false than that of a mathematical cryptographer who believes in the
imaginary number 'v because it helps her break codes."

sophie frowned. "that's not fair."

a moment passed.

"what was your question again?" langdon asked.

"i can't remember."

he smiled. "works every time."



chapter 83



langdon's mickey mouse wristwatch read almost seven-thirty when he emerged from the jaguar
limousine onto inner temple lane with sophie and teabing. the threesome wound through a
maze of buildings to a small courtyard outside the temple church. the rough-hewn stone
shimmered in the rain, and doves cooed in the architecture overhead.

london's ancient temple church was constructed entirely of caen stone. a dramatic, circular
edifice with a daunting facade, a central turret, and a protruding nave off one side, the church
looked more like a military stronghold than a place of worship. consecrated on the tenth of
february in 1 185 by heraclius, patriarch of jerusalem, the temple church survived eight centuries
of political turmoil, the great fire of london, and the first world war, only to be heavily damaged
by luftwaffe incendiary bombs in 1940. after the war, it was restored to its original, stark
grandeur.

the simplicity of the circle, langdon thought, admiring the building for the first time. the
architecture was coarse and simple, more reminiscent of rome's rugged castel sant'angelo than
the refined pantheon. the boxy annex jutting out to the right was an unfortunate eyesore, although
it did little to shroud the original pagan shape of the primary structure.

"it's early on a saturday," teabing said, hobbling toward the entrance, "so i'm assuming we won't
have services to deal with."

the church's entryway was a recessed stone niche inside which stood a large wooden door. to the
left of the door, looking entirely out of place, hung a bulletin board covered with concert schedules
and religious service announcements.

teabing frowned as he read the board. "they don't open to sightseers for another couple of hours."
he moved to the door and tried it. the door didn't budge. putting his ear to the wood, he listened.
after a moment, he pulled back, a scheming look on his face as he pointed to the bulletin board.
"robert, check the service schedule, will you? who is presiding this week?"



inside the church, an altar boy was almost finished vacuuming the communion kneelers when he
heard a knocking on the sanctuary door. he ignored it. father harvey knowles had his own keys
and was not due for another couple of hours. the knocking was probably a curious tourist or
indigent. the altar boy kept vacuuming, but the knocking continued. can't you read? the sign on
the door clearly stated that the church did not open until nine-thirty on saturday. the altar boy
remained with his chores.

suddenly, the knocking turned to a forceful banging, as if someone were hitting the door with a
metal rod. the young man switched off his vacuum cleaner and marched angrily toward the door.
unlatching it from within, he swung it open. three people stood in the entryway. tourists, he
grumbled. "we open at nine-thirty."



the heavyset man, apparently the leader, stepped forward using metal crutches. "i am sir leigh
teabing," he said, his accent a highbrow, saxonesque british. "as you are no doubt aware, i am
escorting mr. and mrs. christopher wren the fourth." he stepped aside, flourishing his arm toward
the attractive couple behind them. the woman was soft-featured, with lush burgundy hair. the man
was tall, dark-haired, and looked vaguely familiar.

the altar boy had no idea how to respond. sir christopher wren was the temple church's most
famous benefactor. he had made possible all the restorations following damage caused by the
great fire. he had also been dead since the early eighteenth century. "urn... an honor to meet
you?"

the man on crutches frowned. "good thing you're not in sales, young man, you're not very
convincing. where is father knowles?"

"it's saturday. he's not due in until later."

the crippled man's scowl deepened. "there's gratitude. he assured us he would be here, but it
looks like we'll do it without him. it won't take long."

the altar boy remained blocking the doorway. "i'm sorry, what won't take long?"

the visitor's eyes sharpened now, and he leaned forward whispering as if to save everyone some
embarrassment. "young man, apparently you are new here. every year sir christopher wren's
descendants bring a pinch of the old man's ashes to scatter in the temple sanctuary. it is part of his
last will and testament. nobody is particularly happy about making the trip, but what can we do?"

the altar boy had been here a couple of years but had never heard of this custom. "it would be
better if you waited until nine-thirty. the church isn't open yet, and i'm not finished hoovering."

the man on crutches glared angrily. "young man, the only reason there's anything left of this
building for you to hoover is on account of the gentleman in that woman's pocket."

"i'm sorry?"

"mrs. wren," the man on crutches said, "would you be so kind as to show this impertinent young
man the reliquary of ashes?"

the woman hesitated a moment and then, as if awaking from a trance, reached in her sweater
pocket and pulled out a small cylinder wrapped in protective fabric.

"there, you see?" the man on crutches snapped. "now, you can either grant his dying wish and let
us sprinkle his ashes in the sanctuary, or i tell father knowles how we've been treated."



the altar boy hesitated, well acquainted with father knowles' deep observance of church
tradition... and, more importantly, with his foul temper when anything cast this time-honored
shrine in anything but favorable light. maybe father knowles had simply forgotten these family
members were coming. if so, then there was far more risk in turning them away than in letting
them in. after all, they said it would only take a minute. what harm could it do ?

when the altar boy stepped aside to let the three people pass, he could have sworn mr. and mrs.
wren looked just as bewildered by all of this as he was. uncertain, the boy returned to his chores,
watching them out of the corner of his eye.



langdon had to smile as the threesome moved deeper into the church.

"leigh," he whispered, "you lie entirely too well."

teabing's eyes twinkled. "oxford theatre club. they still talk of my julius caesar. i'm certain
nobody has ever performed the first scene of act three with more dedication."

langdon glanced over. "i thought caesar was dead in that scene."

teabing smirked. "yes, but my toga tore open when i fell, and i had to lie on stage for half an hour
with my todger hanging out. even so, i never moved a muscle. i was brilliant, i tell you."

langdon cringed. sorry i missed it.

as the group moved through the rectangular annex toward the archway leading into the main
church, langdon was surprised by the barren austerity. although the altar layout resembled that of
a linear christian chapel, the furnishings were stark and cold, bearing none of the traditional
ornamentation. "bleak," he whispered.

teabing chuckled. "church of england. anglicans drink their religion straight. nothing to distract
from their misery."

sophie motioned through the vast opening that gave way to the circular section of the church. "it
looks like a fortress in there," she whispered.

langdon agreed. even from here, the walls looked unusually robust.

"the knights templar were warriors," teabing reminded, the sound of his aluminum crutches
echoing in this reverberant space. "a religio-military society. their churches were their
strongholds and their banks."



"banks?" sophie asked, glancing at leigh.

"heavens, yes. the templars invented the concept of modern banking. for european nobility,
traveling with gold was perilous, so the templars allowed nobles to deposit gold in their nearest
temple church and then draw it from any other temple church across europe. all they needed
was proper documentation." he winked. "and a small commission. they were the original atms."
teabing pointed toward a stained-glass window where the breaking sun was refracting through a
white-clad knight riding a rose-colored horse. "alanus marcel," teabing said, "master of the
temple in the early twelve hundreds. he and his successors actually held the parliamentary chair
of primus baro angiae."

langdon was surprised. "first baron of the realm?"

teabing nodded. "the master of the temple, some claim, held more influence than the king
himself. " as they arrived outside the circular chamber, teabing shot a glance over his shoulder at
the altar boy, who was vacuuming in the distance. "you know," teabing whispered to sophie, "the
holy grail is said to once have been stored in this church overnight while the templars moved it
from one hiding place to another. can you imagine the four chests of sangreal documents sitting
right here with mary magdalene's sarcophagus? it gives me gooseflesh."

langdon was feeling gooseflesh too as they stepped into the circular chamber. his eye traced the
curvature of the chamber's pale stone perimeter, taking in the carvings of gargoyles, demons,
monsters, and pained human faces, all staring inward. beneath the carvings, a single stone pew
curled around the entire circumference of the room.

"theater in the round," langdon whispered.

teabing raised a crutch, pointing toward the far left of the room and then to the far right. langdon
had already seen them.

ten stone knights.

five on the left. five on the right.

lying prone on the floor, the carved, life-sized figures rested in peaceful poses. the knights were
depicted wearing full armor, shields, and swords, and the tombs gave langdon the uneasy
sensation that someone had snuck in and poured plaster over the knights while they were sleeping.
all of the figures were deeply weathered, and yet each was clearly unique — different armory
pieces, distinct leg and arm positions, facial features, and markings on their shields.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.

langdon felt shaky as he inched deeper into the circular room.



this had to be the place.



chapter 84

in a rubbish-strewn alley very close to temple church, remy legaludec pulled the jaguar
limousine to a stop behind a row of industrial waste bins. killing the engine, he checked the area.
deserted. he got out of the car, walked toward the rear, and climbed back into the limousine's main
cabin where the monk was.

sensing remy's presence, the monk in the back emerged from a prayer-like trance, his red eyes
looking more curious than fearful. all evening remy had been impressed with this trussed man's
ability to stay calm. after some initial struggles in the range rover, the monk seemed to have
accepted his plight and given over his fate to a higher power.

loosening his bow tie, remy unbuttoned his high, starched, wing-tipped collar and felt as if he
could breathe for the first time in years. he went to the limousine's wet bar, where he poured
himself a smirnoff vodka. he drank it in a single swallow and followed it with a second.

soon i will be a man of leisure.

searching the bar, remy found a standard service wine-opener and flicked open the sharp blade.
the knife was usually employed to slice the lead foil from corks on fine bottles of wine, but it
would serve a far more dramatic purpose this morning. remy turned and faced silas, holding up
the glimmering blade.

now those red eyes flashed fear.

remy smiled and moved toward the back of the limousine. the monk recoiled, struggling against
his bonds.

"be still," remy whispered, raising the blade.

silas could not believe that god had forsaken him. even the physical pain of being bound silas had
turned into a spiritual exercise, asking the throb of his blood-starved muscles to remind him of the
pain christ endured. / have been praying all night for liberation. now, as the knife descended,
silas clenched his eyes shut.

a slash of pain tore through his shoulder blades. he cried out, unable to believe he was going to
die here in the back of this limousine, unable to defend himself. / was doing god's work. the
teacher said he would protect me.



silas felt the biting warmth spreading across his back and shoulders and could picture his own
blood, spilling out over his flesh. a piercing pain cut through his thighs now, and he felt the onset
of that familiar undertow of disorientation — the body's defense mechanism against the pain.

as the biting heat tore through all of his muscles now, silas clenched his eyes tighter, determined
that the final image of his life would not be of his own killer. instead he pictured a younger bishop
aringarosa, standing before the small church in spain... the church that he and silas had built with
their own hands. the beginning of my life.

silas felt as if his body were on fire.

"take a drink," the tuxedoed man whispered, his accent french. "it will help with your
circulation."

silas's eyes flew open in surprise. a blurry image was leaning over him, offering a glass of liquid.
a mound of shredded duct tape lay on the floor beside the bloodless knife.

"drink this," he repeated. "the pain you feel is the blood rushing into your muscles."

silas felt the fiery throb transforming now to a prickling sting. the vodka tasted terrible, but he
drank it, feeling grateful. fate had dealt silas a healthy share of bad luck tonight, but god had
solved it all with one miraculous twist.

god has not forsaken me.

silas knew what bishop aringarosa would call it.

divine intervention.

"i had wanted to free you earlier," the servant apologized, "but it was impossible. with the police
arriving at chateau villette, and then at biggin hill airport, this was the first possible moment. you
understand, don't you, silas?"

silas recoiled, startled. "you know my name?"

the servant smiled.

silas sat up now, rubbing his stiff muscles, his emotions a torrent of incredulity, appreciation, and
confusion. "are you... the teacher?"

remy shook his head, laughing at the proposition. "i wish i had that kind of power. no, i am not
the teacher. like you, i serve him. but the teacher speaks highly of you. my name is remy."



silas was amazed. "i don't understand. if you work for the teacher, why did langdon bring the
keystone to your home?"

"not my home. the home of the world's foremost grail historian, sir leigh teabing."

"but you live there. the odds..."

remy smiled, seeming to have no trouble with the apparent coincidence of langdon's chosen
refuge. "it was all utterly predictable. robert langdon was in possession of the keystone, and he
needed help. what more logical place to run than to the home of leigh teabing? that i happen to
live there is why the teacher approached me in the first place." he paused. "how do you think the
teacher knows so much about the grail?"

now it dawned, and silas was stunned. the teacher had recruited a servant who had access to all
of sir leigh teabing's research. it was brilliant.

"there is much i have to tell you," remy said, handing silas the loaded heckler koch pistol. then
he reached through the open partition and retrieved a small, palm-sized revolver from the glove
box. "but first, you and i have a job to do."



captain fache descended from his transport plane at biggin hill and listened in disbelief to the
kent chief inspector's account of what had happened in teabing's hangar.

"i searched the plane myself," the inspector insisted, "and there was no one inside." his tone turned
haughty. "and i should add that if sir leigh teabing presses charges against me, i will — "

"did you interrogate the pilot?"

"of course not. he is french, and our jurisdiction requires — "

"take me to the plane."

arriving at the hangar, fache needed only sixty seconds to locate an anomalous smear of blood on
the pavement near where the limousine had been parked. fache walked up to the plane and rapped
loudly on the fuselage.

"this is the captain of the french judicial police. open the door!"

the terrified pilot opened the hatch and lowered the stairs.

fache ascended. three minutes later, with the help of his sidearm, he had a full confession,



including a description of the bound albino monk. in addition, he learned that the pilot saw
langdon and sophie leave something behind in teabing's safe, a wooden box of some sort.
although the pilot denied knowing what was in the box, he admitted it had been the focus of
langdon's full attention during the flight to london.

"open the safe," fache demanded.

the pilot looked terrified. "i don't know the combination!"

"that's too bad. i was going to offer to let you keep your pilot's license."

the pilot wrung his hands. "i know some men in maintenance here. maybe they could drill it?"

"you have half an hour."

the pilot leapt for his radio.

fache strode to the back of the plane and poured himself a hard drink. it was early, but he had not
yet slept, so this hardly counted as drinking before noon. sitting in a plush bucket seat, he closed
his eyes, trying to sort out what was going on. the kent police's blunder could cost me dearly.
everyone was now on the lookout for a black jaguar limousine.

fache's phone rang, and he wished for a moment's peace. "alio?"

"i'm en route to london." it was bishop aringarosa. "i'll be arriving in an hour."

fache sat up. "i thought you were going to paris."

"i am deeply concerned. i have changed my plans."

"you should not have."

"do you have silas?"

"no. his captors eluded the local police before i landed."

aringarosa's anger rang sharply. "you assured me you would stop that plane!"

fache lowered his voice. "bishop, considering your situation, i recommend you not test my
patience today. i will find silas and the others as soon as possible. where are you landing?"

"one moment." aringarosa covered the receiver and then came back. "the pilot is trying to get
clearance at heathrow. i'm his only passenger, but our redirect was unscheduled."



"tell him to come to biggin hill executive airport in kent. i'll get him clearance. if i'm not here
when you land, i'll have a car waiting for you. "

"thank you."

"as i expressed when we first spoke, bishop, you would do well to remember that you are not the
only man on the verge of losing everything."



chapter 85

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.

each of the carved knights within the temple church lay on his back with his head resting on a
rectangular stone pillow. sophie felt a chill. the poem's reference to an "orb" conjured images of
the night in her grandfather's basement.

hieros gamos. the orbs.

sophie wondered if the ritual had been performed in this very sanctuary. the circular room seemed
custom-built for such a pagan rite. a stone pew encircled a bare expanse of floor in the middle. a
theater in the round, as robert had called it. she imagined this chamber at night, filled with
masked people, chanting by torchlight, all witnessing a "sacred communion" in the center of the
room.

forcing the image from her mind, she advanced with langdon and teabing toward the first group
of knights. despite teabing's insistence that their investigation should be conducted meticulously,
sophie felt eager and pushed ahead of them, making a cursory walk-through of the five knights on
the left.

scrutinizing these first tombs, sophie noted the similarities and differences between them. every
knight was on his back, but three of the knights had their legs extended straight out while two had
their legs crossed. the oddity seemed to have no relevance to the missing orb. examining their
clothing, sophie noted that two of the knights wore tunics over their armor, while the other three
wore ankle-length robes. again, utterly unhelpful. sophie turned her attention to the only other
obvious difference — their hand positions. two knights clutched swords, two prayed, and one had
his arms at his side. after a long moment looking at the hands, sophie shrugged, having seen no
hint anywhere of a conspicuously absent orb.

feeling the weight of the cryptex in her sweater pocket, she glanced back at langdon and teabing.
the men were moving slowly, still only at the third knight, apparently having no luck either. in no



mood to wait, she turned away from them toward the second group of knights.

as she crossed the open space, she quietly recited the poem she had read so many times now that it
was committed to memory.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.

his labor's fruit a holy wrath incurred.

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.

it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb.



when sophie arrived at the second group of knights, she found that this second group was similar
to the first. all lay with varied body positions, wearing armor and swords.

that was, all except the tenth and final tomb.

hurrying over to it, she stared down.

no pillow. no armor. no tunic. no sword.

"robert? leigh?" she called, her voice echoing around the chamber. "there's something missing
over here."

both men looked up and immediately began to cross the room toward her.

"an orb?" teabing called excitedly. his crutches clicked out a rapid staccato as he hurried across
the room. "are we missing an orb?"

"not exactly," sophie said, frowning at the tenth tomb. "we seem to be missing an entire knight."

arriving beside her both men gazed down in confusion at the tenth tomb. rather than a knight
lying in the open air, this tomb was a sealed stone casket. the casket was trapezoidal, tapered at the
feet, widening toward the top, with a peaked lid.

"why isn't this knight shown?" langdon asked.

"fascinating," teabing said, stroking his chin. "i had forgotten about this oddity. it's been years
since i was here."

"this coffin," sophie said, "looks like it was carved at the same time and by the same sculptor as
the other nine tombs. so why is this knight in a casket rather than in the open?"

teabing shook his head. "one of this church's mysteries. to the best of my knowledge, nobody has



ever found any explanation for it. "

"hello?" the altar boy said, arriving with a perturbed look on his face. "forgive me if this seems
rude, but you told me you wanted to spread ashes, and yet you seem to be sightseeing."

teabing scowled at the boy and turned to langdon. "mr. wren, apparently your family's
philanthropy does not buy you the time it used to, so perhaps we should take out the ashes and get
on with it." teabing turned to sophie. "mrs. wren?"

sophie played along, pulling the vellum- wrapped cryptex from her pocket.

"now then," teabing snapped at the boy, "if you would give us some privacy?"

the altar boy did not move. he was eyeing langdon closely now. "you look familiar."

teabing huffed. "perhaps that is because mr. wren comes here every year!"

or perhaps, sophie now feared, because he saw langdon on television at the vatican last year.

"i have never met mr. wren," the altar boy declared.

"you're mistaken," langdon said politely. "i believe you and i met in passing last year. father
knowles failed to formally introduce us, but i recognized your face as we came in. now, i realize
this is an intrusion, but if you could afford me a few more minutes, i have traveled a great distance
to scatter ashes amongst these tombs." langdon spoke his lines with teabing-esque belie vability.

the altar boy's expression turned even more skeptical. "these are not tombs. "

"i'm sorry?" langdon said.

"of course they are tombs," teabing declared. "what are you talking about?"

the altar boy shook his head. "tombs contain bodies. these are effigies. stone tributes to real
men. there are no bodies beneath these figures."

"this is a crypt!" teabing said.

"only in outdated history books. this was believed to be a crypt but was revealed as nothing of the
sort during the 1950 renovation." he turned back to langdon. "and i imagine mr. wren would
know that. considering it was his family that uncovered that fact. "

an uneasy silence fell.



it was broken by the sound of a door slamming out in the annex.

"that must be father knowles," teabing said. "perhaps you should go see?"

the altar boy looked doubtful but stalked back toward the annex, leaving langdon, sophie, and
teabing to eye one another gloomily.

"leigh," langdon whispered. "no bodies? what is he talking about?"

teabing looked distraught. "i don't know. i always thought... certainly, this must be the place. i
can't imagine he knows what he is talking about. it makes no sense ! "

"can i see the poem again?" langdon said.

sophie pulled the cryptex from her pocket and carefully handed it to him.

langdon unwrapped the vellum, holding the cryptex in his hand while he examined the poem.
"yes, the poem definitely references a tomb. not an effigy."

"could the poem be wrong?" teabing asked. "could jacques sauniere have made the same mistake
i just did?"

langdon considered it and shook his head. "leigh, you said it yourself. this church was built by
templars, the military arm of the priory. something tells me the grand master of the priory would
have a pretty good idea if there were knights buried here."

teabing looked flabbergasted. "but this place is perfect." he wheeled back toward the knights.
"we must be missing something!"



entering the annex, the altar boy was surprised to find it deserted. "father knowles?" / know i
heard the door, he thought, moving forward until he could see the entryway.

a thin man in a tuxedo stood near the doorway, scratching his head and looking lost. the altar boy
gave an irritated huff, realizing he had forgotten to relock the door when he let the others in. now
some pathetic sod had wandered in off the street, looking for directions to some wedding from the
looks of it. "i'm sorry," he called out, passing a large pillar, "we're closed."

a flurry of cloth ruffled behind him, and before the altar boy could turn, his head snapped
backward, a powerful hand clamping hard over his mouth from behind, muffling his scream. the
hand over the boy's mouth was snow-white, and he smelled alcohol.



the prim man in the tuxedo calmly produced a very small revolver, which he aimed directly at the
boy's forehead.

the altar boy felt his groin grow hot and realized he had wet himself.

"listen carefully," the tuxedoed man whispered. "you will exit this church silently, and you will
run. you will not stop. is that clear?"

the boy nodded as best he could with the hand over his mouth.

"if you call the police..." the tuxedoed man pressed the gun to his skin. "i will find you."

the next thing the boy knew, he was sprinting across the outside courtyard with no plans of
stopping until his legs gave out.



chapter 86

like a ghost, silas drifted silently behind his target. sophie neveu sensed him too late. before she
could turn, silas pressed the gun barrel into her spine and wrapped a powerful arm across her chest,
pulling her back against his hulking body. she yelled in surprise. teabing and langdon both turned
now, their expressions astonished and fearful.

"what...?" teabing choked out. "what did you do to remy!"

"your only concern," silas said calmly, "is that i leave here with the keystone." this recovery
mission, as remy had described it, was to be clean and simple: enter the church, take the keystone,
and walk out; no killing, no struggle.

holding sophie firm, silas dropped his hand from her chest, down to her waist, slipping it inside
her deep sweater pockets, searching. he could smell the soft fragrance of her hair through his own
alcohol-laced breath. "where is it?" he whispered. the keystone was in her sweater pocket earlier.
so where is it now?

"it's over here," langdon's deep voice resonated from across the room.

silas turned to see langdon holding the black cryptex before him, waving it back and forth like a
matador tempting a dumb animal.

"set it down," silas demanded.

"let sophie and leigh leave the church," langdon replied. "you and i can settle this."



silas pushed sophie away from him and aimed the gun at langdon, moving toward him.

"not a step closer," langdon said. "not until they leave the building."

"you are in no position to make demands."

"i disagree." langdon raised the cryptex high over his head. "i will not hesitate to smash this on the
floor and break the vial inside."

although silas sneered outwardly at the threat, he felt a flash of fear. this was unexpected. he
aimed the gun at langdon's head and kept his voice as steady as his hand. "you would never break
the keystone. you want to find the grail as much as i do."



you're wrong. you want it much more. you've proven you're willing to kill for it."



forty feet away, peering out from the annex pews near the archway, remy legaludec felt a rising
alarm. the maneuver had not gone as planned, and even from here, he could see silas was
uncertain how to handle the situation. at the teacher's orders, remy had forbidden silas to fire his
gun.

"let them go," langdon again demanded, holding the cryptex high over his head and staring into
silas's gun.

the monk's red eyes filled with anger and frustration, and remy tightened with fear that silas
might actually shoot langdon while he was holding the cryptex. the cryptex cannot fall!

the cryptex was to be remy's ticket to freedom and wealth. a little over a year ago, he was simply
a fifty-five-year-old manservant living within the walls of chateau villette, catering to the whims
of the insufferable cripple sir leigh teabing. then he was approached with an extraordinary
proposition. remy's association with sir leigh teabing — the preeminent grail historian on
earth — was going to bring remy everything he had ever dreamed of in life. since then, every
moment he had spent inside chateau villette had been leading him to this very instant.

/ am so close, remy told himself, gazing into the sanctuary of the temple church and the keystone
in robert langdon's hand. if langdon dropped it, all would be lost.

am i willing to show my face? it was something the teacher had strictly forbidden. remy was the
only one who knew the teacher's identity.

"are you certain you want silas to carry out this task?" remy had asked the teacher less than half



an hour ago, upon getting orders to steal the keystone. "i myself am capable."

the teacher was resolute. "silas served us well with the four priory members. he will recover the
keystone. you must remain anonymous. if others see you, they will need to be eliminated, and there
has been enough killing already. do not reveal your face."

my face will change, remy thought. with what you've promised to pay me, i will become an
entirely new man. surgery could even change his fingerprints, the teacher had told him. soon he
would be free — another unrecognizable, beautiful face soaking up the sun on the beach.
"understood," remy said. "i will assist silas from the shadows."

"for your own knowledge, remy," the teacher had told him, "the tomb in question is not in the
temple church. so have no fear. they are looking in the wrong place."

remy was stunned. "and you know where the tomb is?"

"of course. later, i will tell you. for the moment, you must act quickly. if the others figure out the
true location of the tomb and leave the church before you take the cryptex, we could lose the grail
forever."

remy didn't give a damn about the grail, except that the teacher refused to pay him until it was
found. remy felt giddy every time he thought of the money he soon would have. one third of
twenty million euro. plenty to disappear forever. remy had pictured the beach towns on the cote
d'azur, where he planned to live out his days basking in the sun and letting others serve him for a
change.

now, however, here in the temple church, with langdon threatening to break the keystone,
remy's future was at risk. unable to bear the thought of coming this close only to lose it all, remy
made the decision to take bold action. the gun in his hand was a concealable, small-caliber, j-
frame medusa, but it would be plenty deadly at close range.

stepping from the shadows, remy marched into the circular chamber and aimed the gun directly at
teabing's head. "old man, i've been waiting a long time to do this."



sir leigh teabing's heart practically stalled to see remy aiming a gun at him. what is he doing!
teabing recognized the tiny medusa revolver as his own, the one he kept locked in the limousine
glove box for safety.

"remy?" teabing sputtered in shock. "what is going on?"

langdon and sophie looked equally dumbstruck.



remy circled behind teabing and rammed the pistol barrel into his back, high and on the left,
directly behind his heart.

teabing felt his muscles seize with terror. "remy, i don't — "

"i'll make it simple," remy snapped, eyeing langdon over teabing's shoulder. "set down the
keystone, or i pull the trigger."

langdon seemed momentarily paralyzed. "the keystone is worthless to you," he stammered. "you
cannot possibly open it."

"arrogant fools," remy sneered. "have you not noticed that i have been listening tonight as you
discussed these poems? everything i heard, i have shared with others. others who know more than
you. you are not even looking in the right place. the tomb you seek is in another location
entirely!"

teabing felt panicked. what is he saying!

"why do you want the grail?" langdon demanded. "to destroy it? before the end of days?"

remy called to the monk. "silas, take the keystone from mr. langdon."

as the monk advanced, langdon stepped back, raising the keystone high, looking fully prepared to
hurl it at the floor.

"i would rather break it," langdon said, "than see it in the wrong hands."

teabing now felt a wave of horror. he could see his life's work evaporating before his eyes. all his
dreams about to be shattered.

"robert, no!" teabing exclaimed. "don't! that's the grail you're holding! remy would never shoot
me. we've known each other for ten — "

remy aimed at the ceiling and fired the medusa. the blast was enormous for such a small weapon,
the gunshot echoing like thunder inside the stone chamber.

everyone froze.

"i am not playing games," remy said. "the next one is in his back. hand the keystone to silas."

langdon reluctantly held out the cryptex. silas stepped forward and took it, his red eyes gleaming
with the self-satisfaction of vengeance. slipping the keystone in the pocket of his robe, silas
backed off, still holding langdon and sophie at gunpoint.



teabing felt remy's arm clamp hard around his neck as the servant began backing out of the
building, dragging teabing with him, the gun still pressed in his back.

"let him go," langdon demanded.

"we're taking mr. teabing for a drive," remy said, still backing up. "if you call the police, he will
die. if you do anything to interfere, he will die. is that clear?"

"take me," langdon demanded, his voice cracking with emotion. "let leigh go."

remy laughed. "i don't think so. he and i have such a nice history. besides, he still might prove
useful."

silas was backing up now, keeping langdon and sophie at gunpoint as remy pulled leigh toward
the exit, his crutches dragging behind him.

sophie's voice was unwavering. "who are you working for?"

the question brought a smirk to the departing remy's face. "you would be surprised,
mademoiselle neveu."



chapter 87

the fireplace in chateau villette's drawing room was cold, but collet paced before it nonetheless
as he read the faxes from interpol.

not at all what he expected.

andre vernet, according to official records, was a model citizen. no police record — not even a
parking ticket. educated at prep school and the sorbonne, he had a cum laude degree in
international finance. interpol said vernet's name appeared in the newspapers from time to time,
but always in a positive light. apparently the man had helped design the security parameters that
kept the depository bank of zurich a leader in the ultramodern world of electronic security.
vernet's credit card records showed a penchant for art books, expensive wine, and classical
cd's — mostly brahms — which he apparently enjoyed on an exceptionally high-end stereo system
he had purchased several years ago.

zero, collet sighed.



the only red flag tonight from interpol had been a set of fingerprints that apparently belonged to
teabing's servant. the chief pts examiner was reading the report in a comfortable chair across the
room.

collet looked over. "anything?"

the examiner shrugged. "prints belong to remy legaludec. wanted for petty crime. nothing
serious. looks like he got kicked out of university for rewiring phone jacks to get free service...
later did some petty theft. breaking and entering. skipped out on a hospital bill once for an
emergency tracheotomy." he glanced up, chuckling. "peanut allergy."

collet nodded, recalling a police investigation into a restaurant that had failed to notate on its menu
that the chili recipe contained peanut oil. an unsuspecting patron had died of anaphylactic shock at
the table after a single bite.

"legaludec is probably a live-in here to avoid getting picked up." the examiner looked amused.
"his lucky night."

collet sighed. "all right, you better forward this info to captain fache."

the examiner headed off just as another pts agent burst into the living room. "lieutenant! we
found something in the barn. "

from the anxious look on the agent's face, collet could only guess. "a body."

"no, sir. something more..." he hesitated. "unexpected."

rubbing his eyes, collet followed the agent out to the barn. as they entered the musty, cavernous
space, the agent motioned toward the center of the room, where a wooden ladder now ascended
high into the rafters, propped against the ledge of a hayloft suspended high above them.

"that ladder wasn't there earlier," collet said.

"no, sir. i set that up. we were dusting for prints near the rolls when i saw the ladder lying on the
floor. i wouldn't have given it a second thought except the rungs were worn and muddy. this
ladder gets regular use. the height of the hayloft matched the ladder, so i raised it and climbed up
to have a look."

collet's eyes climbed the ladder's steep incline to the soaring hayloft. someone goes up there
regularly? from down here, the loft appeared to be a deserted platform, and yet admittedly most of
it was invisible from this line of sight.

a senior pts agent appeared at the top of the ladder, looking down. "you'll definitely want to see



this, lieutenant," he said, waving collet up with a latex-gloved hand.

nodding tiredly, collet walked over to the base of the old ladder and grasped the bottom rungs.
the ladder was an antique tapered design and narrowed as collet ascended. as he neared the top,
collet almost lost his footing on a thin rung. the barn below him spun. alert now, he moved on,
finally reaching the top. the agent above him reached out, offering his wrist. collet grabbed it and
made the awkward transition onto the platform.

"it's over there," the pts agent said, pointing deep into the immaculately clean loft. "only one set
of prints up here. we'll have an id shortly."

collet squinted through the dim light toward the far wall. what the hell? nestled against the far
wall sat an elaborate computer workstation — two tower cpus, a flat-screen video monitor with
speakers, an array of hard drives, and a multichannel audio console that appeared to have its own
filtered power supply.

why in the world would anyone work all the way up here? collet moved toward the gear. "have
you examined the system?"

"it's a listening post."

collet spun. "surveillance?"

the agent nodded. "very advanced surveillance." he motioned to a long project table strewn with
electronic parts, manuals, tools, wires, soldering irons, and other electronic components. "someone
clearly knows what he's doing. a lot of this gear is as sophisticated as our own equipment.
miniature microphones, photoelectric recharging cells, high-capacity ram chips. he's even got
some of those new nano drives."

collet was impressed.

"here's a complete system," the agent said, handing collet an assembly not much larger than a
pocket calculator. dangling off the contraption was a foot-long wire with a stamp-sized piece of
wafer-thin foil stuck on the end. "the base is a high-capacity hard disk audio recording system
with rechargeable battery. that strip of foil at the end of the wire is a combination microphone and
photoelectric recharging cell."

collet knew them well. these foil-like, photocell microphones had been an enormous breakthrough
a few years back. now, a hard disk recorder could be affixed behind a lamp, for example, with its
foil microphone molded into the contour of the base and dyed to match. as long as the microphone
was positioned such that it received a few hours of sunlight per day, the photo cells would keep
recharging the system. bugs like this one could listen indefinitely.



"reception method?" collet asked.

the agent signaled to an insulated wire that ran out of the back of the computer, up the wall,
through a hole in the barn roof. "simple radio wave. small antenna on the roof."

collet knew these recording systems were generally placed in offices, were voice-activated to save
hard disk space, and recorded snippets of conversation during the day, transmitting compressed
audio files at night to avoid detection. after transmitting, the hard drive erased itself and prepared
to do it all over again the next day.

collet's gaze moved now to a shelf on which were stacked several hundred audio cassettes, all
labeled with dates and numbers. someone has been very busy. he turned back to the agent. "do
you have any idea what target is being bugged?"

"well, lieutenant," the agent said, walking to the computer and launching a piece of software. "it's
the strangest thing...."



chapter 88

langdon felt utterly spent as he and sophie hurdled a turnstile at the temple tube station and
dashed deep into the grimy labyrinth of tunnels and platforms. the guilt ripped through him.

/ involved leigh, and now he's in enormous danger.

remy's involvement had been a shock, and yet it made sense. whoever was pursuing the grail had
recruited someone on the inside. they went to teabing'sfor the same reason i did. throughout
history, those who held knowledge of the grail had always been magnets for thieves and scholars
alike. the fact that teabing had been a target all along should have made langdon feel less guilty
about involving him. it did not. we need to find leigh and help him. immediately.

langdon followed sophie to the westbound district and circle line platform, where she hurried to
a pay phone to call the police, despite remy's warning to the contrary. langdon sat on a grungy
bench nearby, feeling remorseful.

"the best way to help leigh," sophie reiterated as she dialed, "is to involve the london authorities
immediately. trust me."

langdon had not initially agreed with this idea, but as they had hatched their plan, sophie's logic
began to make sense. teabing was safe at the moment. even if remy and the others knew where
the knight's tomb was located, they still might need teabing's help deciphering the orb reference.
what worried langdon was what would happen after the grail map had been found. leigh will



become a huge liability.

if langdon were to have any chance of helping leigh, or of ever seeing the keystone again, it was
essential that he find the tomb first. unfortunately, remy has a big head start.

slowing remy down had become sophie's task.

finding the right tomb had become langdon's.

sophie would make remy and silas fugitives of the london police, forcing them into hiding or,
better yet, catching them. langdon's plan was less certain — to take the tube to nearby king's
college, which was renowned for its electronic theological database. the ultimate research tool,
langdon had heard. instant answers to any religious historical question. he wondered what the
database would have to say about "a knight a pope interred."

he stood up and paced, wishing the train would hurry.



at the pay phone, sophie's call finally connected to the london police.

"snow hill division," the dispatcher said. "how may i direct your call?"

"i'm reporting a kidnapping." sophie knew to be concise.

"name please?"

sophie paused. "agent sophie neveu with the french judicial police."

the title had the desired effect. "right away, ma'am. let me get a detective on the line for you."

as the call went through, sophie began wondering if the police would even believe her description
of teabing's captors. a man in a tuxedo. how much easier to identify could a suspect be? even if
remy changed clothes, he was partnered with an albino monk. impossible to miss. moreover, they
had a hostage and could not take public transportation. she wondered how many jaguar stretch
limos there could be in london.

sophie's connection to the detective seemed to be taking forever. come on! she could hear the line
clicking and buzzing, as if she was being transferred.

fifteen seconds passed.

finally a man came on the line. "agent neveu?"



stunned, sophie registered the gruff tone immediately.

"agent neveu," bezu fache demanded. "where the hell are you?"

sophie was speechless. captain fache had apparently requested the london police dispatcher alert
him if sophie called in.

"listen," fache said, speaking to her in terse french. "i made a terrible mistake tonight. robert
langdon is innocent. all charges against him have been dropped. even so, both of you are in
danger. you need to come in."

sophie's jaw fell slack. she had no idea how to respond. fache was not a man who apologized for
anything.

"you did not tell me," fache continued, "that jacques sauniere was your grandfather. i fully intend
to overlook your insubordination last night on account of the emotional stress you must be under.
at the moment, however, you and langdon need to go to the nearest london police headquarters
for refuge."

he knows i'm in london? what else does fache know? sophie heard what sounded like drilling or
machinery in the background. she also heard an odd clicking on the line. "are you tracing this call,
captain?"

fache's voice was firm now. "you and i need to cooperate, agent neveu. we both have a lot to
lose here. this is damage control. i made errors in judgment last night, and if those errors result in
the deaths of an american professor and a dcpj cryptologist, my career will be over. i've been
trying to pull you back into safety for the last several hours."

a warm wind was now pushing through the station as a train approached with a low rumble.
sophie had every intention of being on it. langdon apparently had the same idea; he was gathering
himself together and moving toward her now.

"the man you want is remy legaludec," sophie said. "he is teabing's servant. he just kidnapped
teabing inside the temple church and — "

"agent neveu!" fache bellowed as the train thundered into the station. "this is not something to
discuss on an open line. you and langdon will come in now. for your own well-being! that is a
direct order!"

sophie hung up and dashed with langdon onto the train.



chapter 89

the immaculate cabin of teabing's hawker was now covered with steel shavings and smelled of
compressed air and propane. bezu fache had sent everyone away and sat alone with his drink and
the heavy wooden box found in teabing's safe.

running his finger across the inlaid rose, he lifted the ornate lid. inside he found a stone cylinder
with lettered dials. the five dials were arranged to spell sofia. fache stared at the word a long
moment and then lifted the cylinder from its padded resting place and examined every inch. then,
pulling slowly on the ends, fache slid off one of the end caps. the cylinder was empty.

fache set it back in the box and gazed absently out the jet's window at the hangar, pondering his
brief conversation with sophie, as well as the information he'd received from pts in chateau
villette. the sound of his phone shook him from his daydream.

it was the dcpj switchboard. the dispatcher was apologetic. the president of the depository bank
of zurich had been calling repeatedly, and although he had been told several times that the captain
was in london on business, he just kept calling. begrudgingly fache told the operator to forward
the call.

"monsieur vernet," fache said, before the man could even speak, "i am sorry i did not call you
earlier. i have been busy. as promised, the name of your bank has not appeared in the media. so
what precisely is your concern?"

vernet's voice was anxious as he told fache how langdon and sophie had extracted a small
wooden box from the bank and then persuaded vernet to help them escape. "then when i heard on
the radio that they were criminals," vernet said, "i pulled over and demanded the box back, but
they attacked me and stole the truck. "

"you are concerned for a wooden box," fache said, eyeing the rose inlay on the cover and again
gently opening the lid to reveal the white cylinder. "can you tell me what was in the box?"

"the contents are immaterial," vernet fired back. "i am concerned with the reputation of my bank.
we have never had a robbery. ever. it will ruin us if i cannot recover this property on behalf of my
client."

"you said agent neveu and robert langdon had a password and a key. what makes you say they
stole the box?"

"they murdered people tonight. including sophie neveu's grandfather. the key and password
were obviously ill-gotten."



"mr. vernet, my men have done some checking into your background and your interests. you are
obviously a man of great culture and refinement. i would imagine you are a man of honor, as well.
as am i. that said, i give you my word as commanding officer of the police judiciaire that your
box, along with your bank's reputation, are in the safest of hands."



chapter 90

high in the hayloft at chateau villette, collet stared at the computer monitor in amazement. "this
system is eavesdropping on all these locations?"

"yes," the agent said. "it looks like data has been collected for over a year now."

collet read the list again, speechless.

colbert sostaque— chairman of the conseil constitutionnel

jean chaffee— curator, musee du jeu de paume

edouard desrochers— senior archivist, mitterrand library

jacques sauniere— curator, musee du louvre

michel breton— head of das (french intelligence)
the agent pointed to the screen. "number four is of obvious concern."

collet nodded blankly. he had noticed it immediately. jacques sauniere was being bugged. he
looked at the rest of the list again. how could anyone possibly manage to bug these prominent
people? "have you heard any of the audio files?"

"a few. here's one of the most recent." the agent clicked a few computer keys. the speakers
crackled to life. "capitaine, un agent du departement de cryptographic est arrive. "

collet could not believe his ears. "that's me! that's my voice!" he recalled sitting at sauniere's
desk and radioing fache in the grand gallery to alert him of sophie neveu's arrival.

the agent nodded. "a lot of our louvre investigation tonight would have been audible if someone
had been interested."

"have you sent anyone in to sweep for the bug?"



"no need. i know exactly where it is." the agent went to a pile of old notes and blueprints on the
worktable. he selected a page and handed it to collet. "look familiar?"

collet was amazed. he was holding a photocopy of an ancient schematic diagram, which depicted
a rudimentary machine. he was unable to read the handwritten italian labels, and yet he knew what
he was looking at. a model for a fully articulated medieval french knight.

the knight sitting on sauniere's desk!

collet's eyes moved to the margins, where someone had scribbled notes on the photocopy in red
felt-tipped marker. the notes were in french and appeared to be ideas outlining how best to insert a
listening device into the knight.



chapter 91

silas sat in the passenger seat of the parked jaguar limousine near the temple church. his hands
felt damp on the keystone as he waited for remy to finish tying and gagging teabing in back with
the rope they had found in the trunk.

finally, remy climbed out of the rear of the limo, walked around, and slid into the driver's seat
beside silas.

"secure?" silas asked.

remy chuckled, shaking off the rain and glancing over his shoulder through the open partition at
the crumpled form of leigh teabing, who was barely visible in the shadows in the rear. "he's not
going anywhere."

silas could hear teabing's muffled cries and realized remy had used some of the old duct tape to
gag him.

"ferme ta gueule!" remy shouted over his shoulder at teabing. reaching to a control panel on the
elaborate dash, remy pressed a button. an opaque partition raised behind them, sealing off the
back. teabing disappeared, and his voice was silenced. remy glanced at silas. "i've been listening
to his miserable whimpering long enough."



minutes later, as the jaguar stretch limo powered through the streets, silas's cell phone rang. the
teacher. he answered excitedly. "hello?"



"silas," the teacher's familiar french accent said, "i am relieved to hear your voice. this means
you are safe."

silas was equally comforted to hear the teacher. it had been hours, and the operation had veered
wildly off course. now, at last, it seemed to be back on track. "i have the keystone."

"this is superb news," the teacher told him. "is remy with you?"

silas was surprised to hear the teacher use remy's name. "yes. remy freed me."

"as i ordered him to do. i am only sorry you had to endure captivity for so long."

"physical discomfort has no meaning. the important thing is that the keystone is ours."

"yes. i need it delivered to me at once. time is of the essence."

silas was eager to meet the teacher face-to-face at last. "yes, sir, i would be honored."

"silas, i would like remy to bring it to me."

remy? silas was crestfallen. after everything silas had done for the teacher, he had believed he
would be the one to hand over the prize. the teacher favors remy?

"i sense your disappointment," the teacher said, "which tells me you do not understand my
meaning." he lowered his voice to a whisper. "you must believe that i would much prefer to
receive the keystone from you — a man of god rather than a criminal — but remy must be dealt
with. he disobeyed my orders and made a grave mistake that has put our entire mission at risk. "

silas felt a chill and glanced over at remy. kidnapping teabing had not been part of the plan, and
deciding what to do with him posed a new problem.

"you and i are men of god," the teacher whispered. "we cannot be deterred from our goal." there
was an ominous pause on the line. "for this reason alone, i will ask remy to bring me the
keystone. do you understand?"

silas sensed anger in the teacher's voice and was surprised the man was not more understanding.
showing his face could not be avoided, silas thought. remy did what he had to do. he saved the
keystone. "i understand," silas managed.

"good. for your own safety, you need to get off the street immediately. the police will be looking
for the limousine soon, and i do not want you caught. opus dei has a residence in london, no?"

"of course."



"and you are welcome there?"

"as a brother."

"then go there and stay out of sight. i will call you the moment i am in possession of the keystone
and have attended to my current problem. "

"you are in london?"

"do as i say, and everything will be fine."

"yes, sir."

the teacher heaved a sigh, as if what he now had to do was profoundly regrettable. "it's time i
speak to remy."

silas handed remy the phone, sensing it might be the last call remy legaludec ever took.



as remy took the phone, he knew this poor, twisted monk had no idea what fate awaited him now
that he had served his purpose.

the teacher used you, silas.

and your bishop is a pawn.

remy still marveled at the teacher's powers of persuasion. bishop aringarosa had trusted
everything. he had been blinded by his own desperation. aringarosa was far too eager to believe.
although remy did not particularly like the teacher, he felt pride at having gained the man's trust
and helped him so substantially. / have earned my payday.

"listen carefully," the teacher said. "take silas to the opus dei residence hall and drop him off a
few streets away. then drive to st. james's park. it is adjacent to parliament and big ben. you can
park the limousine on horse guards parade. we'll talk there."

with that, the connection went dead.



chapter 92



king's college, established by king george iv in 1829, houses its department of theology and
religious studies adjacent to parliament on property granted by the crown. king's college
religion department boasts not only 150 years' experience in teaching and research, but the 1982
establishment of the research institute in systematic theology, which possesses one of the most
complete and electronically advanced religious research libraries in the world.

langdon still felt shaky as he and sophie came in from the rain and entered the library. the
primary research room was as teabing had described it — a dramatic octagonal chamber dominated
by an enormous round table around which king arthur and his knights might have been
comfortable were it not for the presence of twelve flat-screen computer workstations. on the far
side of the room, a reference librarian was just pouring a pot of tea and settling in for her day of
work.

"lovely morning," she said in a cheerful british accent, leaving the tea and walking over. "may i
help you?"

"thank you, yes," langdon replied. "my name is — "

"robert langdon." she gave a pleasant smile. "i know who you are."

for an instant, he feared fache had put him on english television as well, but the librarian's smile
suggested otherwise. langdon still had not gotten used to these moments of unexpected celebrity.
then again, if anyone on earth were going to recognize his face, it would be a librarian in a
religious studies reference facility.

"pamela gettum," the librarian said, offering her hand. she had a genial, erudite face and a
pleasingly fluid voice. the horn-rimmed glasses hanging around her neck were thick.

"a pleasure," langdon said. "this is my friend sophie neveu."

the two women greeted one another, and gettum turned immediately back to langdon. "i didn't
know you were coming."

"neither did we. if it's not too much trouble, we could really use your help finding some
information."

gettum shifted, looking uncertain. "normally our services are by petition and appointment only,
unless of course you're the guest of someone at the college?"

langdon shook his head. "i'm afraid we've come unannounced. a friend of mine speaks very
highly of you. sir leigh teabing?" langdon felt a pang of gloom as he said the name. "the british
royal historian."



gettum brightened now, laughing. "heavens, yes. what a character. fanatical! every time he
comes in, it's always the same search strings. grail. grail. grail. i swear that man will die before he
gives up on that quest." she winked. "time and money afford one such lovely luxuries, wouldn't
you say? a regular don quixote, that one."

"is there any chance you can help us?" sophie asked. "it's quite important."

gettum glanced around the deserted library and then winked at them both. "well, i can't very well
claim i'm too busy, now can i? as long as you sign in, i can't imagine anyone being too upset.
what did you have in mind?"

"we're trying to find a tomb in london."

gettum looked dubious. "we've got about twenty thousand of them. can you be a little more
specific?"

"it's the tomb of a knight. we don't have a name."

"a knight. that tightens the net substantially. much less common."

"we don't have much information about the knight we're looking for," sophie said, "but this is
what we know." she produced a slip of paper on which she had written only the first two lines of
the poem.

hesitant to show the entire poem to an outsider, langdon and sophie had decided to share just the
first two lines, those that identified the knight. compartmentalized cryptography, sophie had called
it. when an intelligence agency intercepted a code containing sensitive data, cryptographers each
worked on a discrete section of the code. this way, when they broke it, no single cryptographer
possessed the entire deciphered message.

in this case, the precaution was probably excessive; even if this librarian saw the entire poem,
identified the knight's tomb, and knew what orb was missing, the information was useless without
the cryptex.



gettum sensed an urgency in the eyes of this famed american scholar, almost as if his finding this
tomb quickly were a matter of critical importance. the green-eyed woman accompanying him also
seemed anxious.

puzzled, gettum put on her glasses and examined the paper they had just handed her.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.



his labor's fruit a holy wrath incurred.

she glanced at her guests. "what is this? some kind of harvard scavenger hunt?"

langdon's laugh sounded forced. "yeah, something like that."

gettum paused, feeling she was not getting the whole story. nonetheless, she felt intrigued and
found herself pondering the verse carefully. "according to this rhyme, a knight did something that
incurred displeasure with god, and yet a pope was kind enough to bury him in london."

langdon nodded. "does it ring any bells?"

gettum moved toward one of the workstations. "not offhand, but let's see what we can pull up in
the database."

over the past two decades, king's college research institute in systematic theology had used
optical character recognition software in unison with linguistic translation devices to digitize and
catalog an enormous collection of texts — encyclopedias of religion, religious biographies, sacred
scriptures in dozens of languages, histories, vatican letters, diaries of clerics, anything at all that
qualified as writings on human spirituality. because the massive collection was now in the form of
bits and bytes rather than physical pages, the data was infinitely more accessible.

settling into one of the workstations, gettum eyed the slip of paper and began typing. "to begin,
we'll run a straight boolean with a few obvious keywords and see what happens."

"thank you."

gettum typed in a few words:

london, knight, pope

as she clicked the search button, she could feel the hum of the massive mainframe downstairs
scanning data at a rate of 500 mb/sec. "i'm asking the system to show us any documents whose
complete text contains all three of these keywords. we'll get more hits than we want, but it's a good
place to start. "

the screen was already showing the first of the hits now.

painting the pope. the collected portraits of sir joshua reynolds. london university press.



gettum shook her head. "obviously not what you're looking for." she scrolled to the next hit.
the london writings of alexander pope by g. wilson knight.

again she shook her head.

as the system churned on, the hits came up more quickly than usual. dozens of texts appeared,
many of them referencing the eighteenth-century british writer alexander pope, whose
counterreligious, mock-epic poetry apparently contained plenty of references to knights and
london.

gettum shot a quick glance to the numeric field at the bottom of the screen. this computer, by
calculating the current number of hits and multiplying by the percentage of the database left to
search, provided a rough guess of how much information would be found. this particular search
looked like it was going to return an obscenely large amount of data.

estimated number of total hits: 2,692



"we need to refine the parameters further," gettum said, stopping the search. "is this all the
information you have regarding the tomb? there's nothing else to go on?"

langdon glanced at sophie neveu, looking uncertain.

this is no scavenger hunt, gettum sensed. she had heard the whisperings of robert langdon's
experience in rome last year. this american had been granted access to the most secure library on
earth — the vatican secret archives. she wondered what kinds of secrets langdon might have
learned inside and if his current desperate hunt for a mysterious london tomb might relate to
information he had gained within the vatican. gettum had been a librarian long enough to know
the most common reason people came to london to look for knights. the grail.

gettum smiled and adjusted her glasses. "you are friends with leigh teabing, you are in england,
and you are looking for a knight." she folded her hands. "i can only assume you are on a grail
quest."

langdon and sophie exchanged startled looks.

gettum laughed. "my friends, this library is a base camp for grail seekers. leigh teabing among
them. i wish i had a shilling for every time i'd run searches for the rose, mary magdalene,
sangreal, merovingian, priory of sion, et cetera, et cetera. everyone loves a conspiracy." she took
off her glasses and eyed them. "i need more information."



in the silence, gettum sensed her guests' desire for discretion was quickly being outweighed by
their eagerness for a fast result.

"here," sophie neveu blurted. "this is everything we know." borrowing a pen from langdon, she
wrote two more lines on the slip of paper and handed it to gettum.

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb.



gettum gave an inward smile. the grail indeed, she thought, noting the references to the rose and
her seeded womb. "i can help you," she said, looking up from the slip of paper. "might i ask where
this verse came from? and why you are seeking an orb?"

"you might ask," langdon said, with a friendly smile, "but it's a long story and we have very little
time."

"sounds like a polite way of saying 'mind your own business.' "

"we would be forever in your debt, pamela," langdon said, "if you could find out who this knight
is and where he is buried."

"very well," gettum said, typing again. "i'll play along. if this is a grail-related issue, we should
cross-reference against grail keywords. i'll add a proximity parameter and remove the title
weighting. that will limit our hits only to those instances of textual keywords that occur near a
grail-related word."

search for: knight, london, pope, tomb
within 100 word proximity of: grail, rose, sangreal, chalice



"how long will this take?" sophie asked.

"a few hundred terabytes with multiple cross-referencing fields?" gettum's eyes glimmered as she
clicked the search key. "a mere fifteen minutes."

langdon and sophie said nothing, but gettum sensed this sounded like an eternity to them.

"tea?" gettum asked, standing and walking toward the pot she had made earlier. "leigh always
loves my tea. "



chapter 93

london's opus dei centre is a modest brick building at 5 orme court, overlooking the north walk
at kensington gardens. silas had never been here, but he felt a rising sense of refuge and asylum as
he approached the building on foot. despite the rain, remy had dropped him off a short distance
away in order to keep the limousine off the main streets. silas didn't mind the walk. the rain was
cleansing.

at remy's suggestion, silas had wiped down his gun and disposed of it through a sewer grate. he
was glad to get rid of it. he felt lighter. his legs still ached from being bound all that time, but
silas had endured far greater pain. he wondered, though, about teabing, whom remy had left
bound in the back of the limousine. the briton certainly had to be feeling the pain by now.

"what will you do with him?" silas had asked remy as they drove over here.

remy had shrugged. "that is a decision for the teacher." there was an odd finality in his tone.

now, as silas approached the opus dei building, the rain began to fall harder, soaking his heavy
robe, stinging the wounds of the day before. he was ready to leave behind the sins of the last
twenty-four hours and purge his soul. his work was done.

moving across a small courtyard to the front door, silas was not surprised to find the door
unlocked. he opened it and stepped into the minimalist foyer. a muted electronic chime sounded
upstairs as silas stepped onto the carpet. the bell was a common feature in these halls where the
residents spent most of the day in their rooms in prayer. silas could hear movement above on the
creaky wood floors.

a man in a cloak came downstairs. "may i help you?" he had kind eyes that seemed not even to
register silas's startling physical appearance.

"thank you. my name is silas. i am an opus dei numerary."

"american?"

silas nodded. "i am in town only for the day. might i rest here?"

"you need not even ask. there are two empty rooms on the third floor. shall i bring you some tea
and bread?"

"thank you." silas was famished.

silas went upstairs to a modest room with a window, where he took off his wet robe and knelt
down to pray in his undergarments. he heard his host come up and lay a tray outside his door. silas



finished his prayers, ate his food, and lay down to sleep.



three stories below, a phone was ringing. the opus dei numerary who had welcomed silas
answered the line.

"this is the london police," the caller said. "we are trying to find an albino monk. we've had a tip-
off that he might be there. have you seen him?"

the numerary was startled. "yes, he is here. is something wrong?"

"he is there now?"

"yes, upstairs praying. what is going on?"

"leave him precisely where he is," the officer commanded. "don't say a word to anyone. i'm
sending officers over right away. "



chapter 94

st. james's park is a sea of green in the middle of london, a public park bordering the palaces of
westminster, buckingham, and st. james's. once enclosed by king henry viii and stocked with
deer for the hunt, st. james's park is now open to the public. on sunny afternoons, londoners
picnic beneath the willows and feed the pond's resident pelicans, whose ancestors were a gift to
charles ii from the russian ambassador.

the teacher saw no pelicans today. the stormy weather had brought instead seagulls from the
ocean. the lawns were covered with them — hundreds of white bodies all facing the same direction,
patiently riding out the damp wind. despite the morning fog, the park afforded splendid views of
the houses of parliament and big ben. gazing across the sloping lawns, past the duck pond and
the delicate silhouettes of the weeping willows, the teacher could see the spires of the building that
housed the knight's tomb — the real reason he had told remy to come to this spot.

as the teacher approached the front passenger door of the parked limousine, remy leaned across
and opened the door. the teacher paused outside, taking a pull from the flask of cognac he was
carrying. then, dabbing his mouth, he slid in beside remy and closed the door.

remy held up the keystone like a trophy. "it was almost lost."

"you have done well," the teacher said.



"we have done well," remy replied, laying the keystone in the teacher's eager hands.

the teacher admired it a long moment, smiling. "and the gun? you wiped it down?"

"back in the glove box where i found it."

"excellent." the teacher took another drink of cognac and handed the flask to remy. "let's toast
our success. the end is near."



remy accepted the bottle gratefully. the cognac tasted salty, but remy didn't care. he and the
teacher were truly partners now. he could feel himself ascending to a higher station in life. / will
never be a servant again. as remy gazed down the embankment at the duck pond below, chateau
villette seemed miles away.

taking another swig from the flask, remy could feel the cognac warming his blood. the warmth in
remy's throat, however, mutated quickly to an uncomfortable heat. loosening his bow tie, remy
tasted an unpleasant grittiness and handed the flask back to the teacher. "i've probably had
enough," he managed, weakly.

taking the flask, the teacher said, "remy, as you are aware, you are the only one who knows my
face. i placed enormous trust in you."

"yes," he said, feeling feverish as he loosened his tie further. "and your identity shall go with me
to the grave."

the teacher was silent a long moment. "i believe you." pocketing the flask and the keystone, the
teacher reached for the glove box and pulled out the tiny medusa revolver. for an instant, remy
felt a surge of fear, but the teacher simply slipped it in his trousers pocket.

what is he doing? remy felt himself sweating suddenly.

"i know i promised you freedom," the teacher said, his voice now sounding regretful. "but
considering your circumstances, this is the best i can do."

the swelling in remy's throat came on like an earthquake, and he lurched against the steering
column, grabbing his throat and tasting vomit in his narrowing esophagus. he let out a muted croak
of a scream, not even loud enough to be heard outside the car. the saltiness in the cognac now
registered.

i'm being murdered!



incredulous, remy turned to see the teacher sitting calmly beside him, staring straight ahead out
the windshield. remy's eyesight blurred, and he gasped for breath. i made everything possible for
him! how could he do this! whether the teacher had intended to kill remy all along or whether it
had been remy's actions in the temple church that had made the teacher lose faith, remy would
never know. terror and rage coursed through him now. remy tried to lunge for the teacher, but
his stiffening body could barely move. / trusted you with everything!

remy tried to lift his clenched fists to blow the horn, but instead he slipped sideways, rolling onto
the seat, lying on his side beside the teacher, clutching at his throat. the rain fell harder now.
remy could no longer see, but he could sense his oxygen-deprived brain straining to cling to his
last faint shreds of lucidity. as his world slowly went black, remy legaludec could have sworn he
heard the sounds of the soft riviera surf.



the teacher stepped from the limousine, pleased to see that nobody was looking in his direction. /
had no choice, he told himself, surprised how little remorse he felt for what he had just done. remy
sealed his own fate. the teacher had feared all along that remy might need to be eliminated when
the mission was complete, but by brazenly showing himself in the temple church, remy had
accelerated the necessity dramatically. robert langdon's unexpected visit to chateau villette had
brought the teacher both a fortuitous windfall and an intricate dilemma. langdon had delivered the
keystone directly to the heart of the operation, which was a pleasant surprise, and yet he had
brought the police on his tail. remy's prints were all over chateau villette, as well as in the barn's
listening post, where remy had carried out the surveillance. the teacher was grateful he had taken
so much care in preventing any ties between remy's activities and his own. nobody could
implicate the teacher unless remy talked, and that was no longer a concern.

one more loose end to tie up here, the teacher thought, moving now toward the rear door of the
limousine. the police will have no idea what happened... and no living witness left to tell them.
glancing around to ensure nobody was watching, he pulled open the door and climbed into the
spacious rear compartment.



minutes later, the teacher was crossing st. james's park. only two people now remain. langdon
and neveu. they were more complicated. but manageable. at the moment, however, the teacher
had the cryptex to attend to.

gazing triumphantly across the park, he could see his destination. in london lies a knight a pope
interred. as soon as the teacher had heard the poem, he had known the answer. even so, that the
others had not figured it out was not surprising. / have an unfair advantage. having listened to
sauniere's conversations for months now, the teacher had heard the grand master mention this



famous knight on occasion, expressing esteem almost matching that he held for da vinci. the
poem's reference to the knight was brutally simple once one saw it — a credit to sauniere's wit — and
yet how this tomb would reveal the final password was still a mystery.

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.

the teacher vaguely recalled photos of the famous tomb and, in particular, its most distinguishing
feature. a magnificent orb. the huge sphere mounted atop the tomb was almost as large as the
tomb itself. the presence of the orb seemed both encouraging and troubling to the teacher. on one
hand, it felt like a signpost, and yet, according to the poem, the missing piece of the puzzle was an
orb that ought to be on his tomb... not one that was already there. he was counting on his closer
inspection of the tomb to unveil the answer.

the rain was getting heavier now, and he tucked the cryptex deep in his right-hand pocket to
protect it from the dampness. he kept the tiny medusa revolver in his left, out of sight. within
minutes, he was stepping into the quiet sanctuary of london's grandest nine-hundred-year-old
building.



just as the teacher was stepping out of the rain, bishop aringarosa was stepping into it. on the
rainy tarmac at biggin hill executive airport, aringarosa emerged from his cramped plane,
bundling his cassock against the cold damp. he had hoped to be greeted by captain fache. instead
a young british police officer approached with an umbrella.

"bishop aringarosa? captain fache had to leave. he asked me to look after you. he suggested i
take you to scotland yard. he thought it would be safest."

safest? aringarosa looked down at the heavy briefcase of vatican bonds clutched in his hand. he
had almost forgotten. "yes, thank you."

aringarosa climbed into the police car, wondering where silas could be. minutes later, the police
scanner crackled with the answer.

5 orme court.

aringarosa recognized the address instantly.

the opus dei centre in london.

he spun to the driver. "take me there at once!"



chapter 95

langdon's eyes had not left the computer screen since the search began.

five minutes. only two hits. both irrelevant.

he was starting to get worried.

pamela gettum was in the adjoining room, preparing hot drinks. langdon and sophie had inquired
unwisely if there might be some coffee brewing alongside the tea gettum had offered, and from the
sound of the microwave beeps in the next room, langdon suspected their request was about to be
rewarded with instant nescafe.

finally, the computer pinged happily.

"sounds like you got another," gettum called from the next room. "what's the title?"

langdon eyed the screen.

grail allegory in medieval literature: a treatise on sir gawain and the green knight.

"allegory of the green knight," he called back.

"no good," gettum said. "not many mythological green giants buried in london."

langdon and sophie sat patiently in front of the screen and waited through two more dubious
returns. when the computer pinged again, though, the offering was unexpected.

die opern von richard wagner



"the operas of wagner?" sophie asked.

gettum peeked back in the doorway, holding a packet of instant coffee. "that seems like a strange
match. was wagner a knight?"

"no," langdon said, feeling a sudden intrigue. "but he was a well-known freemason." along with
mozart, beethoven, shakespeare, gershwin, houdini, and disney. volumes had been written about
the ties between the masons and the knights templar, the priory of sion, and the holy grail. "i
want to look at this one. how do i see the full text?"



"you don't want the full text," gettum called. "click on the hypertext title. the computer will
display your keyword hits along with mono prelogs and triple postlogs for context."

langdon had no idea what she had just said, but he clicked anyway.

a new window popped up.

. . .mythological knight named parsifal who. . .

...metaphorical grail quest that arguably...

...the london philharmonic in 1855...

rebecca pope's opera anthology "diva's...

...wagner's tomb in bayreuth, germany...



"wrong pope," langdon said, disappointed. even so, he was amazed by the system's ease of use.
the keywords with context were enough to remind him that wagner's opera parsifal was a tribute
to mary magdalene and the bloodline of jesus christ, told through the story of a young knight on a
quest for truth.

"just be patient," gettum urged. "it's a numbers game. let the machine run."

over the next few minutes, the computer returned several more grail references, including a text
about troubadours — france's famous wandering minstrels. langdon knew it was no coincidence
that the word minstrel and minister shared an etymological root. the troubadours were the
traveling servants or "ministers" of the church of mary magdalene, using music to disseminate the
story of the sacred feminine among the common folk. to this day, the troubadours sang songs
extolling the virtues of "our lady" — a mysterious and beautiful woman to whom they pledged
themselves forever.

eagerly, he checked the hypertext but found nothing.

the computer pinged again.

knights, knaves, popes, and pentacles: the history of the holy grail

through tarot



"not surprising," langdon said to sophie. "some of our keywords have the same names as
individual cards." he reached for the mouse to click on a hyperlink. "i'm not sure if your
grandfather ever mentioned it when you played tarot with him, sophie, but this game is a 'flash-
card catechism' into the story of the lost bride and her subjugation by the evil church."

sophie eyed him, looking incredulous. "i had no idea."



"that's the point. by teaching through a metaphorical game, the followers of the grail disguised
their message from the watchful eye of the church." langdon often wondered how many modern
card players had any clue that their four suits — spades, hearts, clubs, diamonds — were grail-related
symbols that came directly from tarot's four suits of swords, cups, scepters, and pentacles.

spades were swords — the blade. male.

hearts were cups — the chalice. feminine.

clubs were scepters — the royal line. the flowering staff.

diamonds were pentacles — the goddess. the sacred feminine.



four minutes later, as langdon began feeling fearful they would not find what they had come for,
the computer produced another hit.

the gravity of genius: biography of a modern knight.



"gravity of genius?" langdon called out to gettum. "bio of a modern knight?"

gettum stuck her head around the corner. "how modern? please don't tell me it's your sir rudy
giuliani. personally, i found that one a bit off the mark."

langdon had his own qualms about the newly knighted sir mick jagger, but this hardly seemed the
moment to debate the politics of modern british knighthood. "let's have a look." langdon
summoned up the hypertext keywords.

... honorable knight, sir isaac newton...

... in london in 1727 and. . .

. . . his tomb in westminster abbey. . .

... alexander pope, friend and colleague...



"i guess 'modern' is a relative term," sophie called to gettum. "it's an old book. about sir isaac
newton."

gettum shook her head in the doorway. "no good. newton was buried in westminster abbey, the
seat of english protestantism. there's no way a catholic pope was present. cream and sugar?"

sophie nodded.



gettum waited. "robert?"

langdon's heart was hammering. he pulled his eyes from the screen and stood up. "sir isaac
newton is our knight."

sophie remained seated. "what are you talking about?"

"newton is buried in london," langdon said. "his labors produced new sciences that incurred the
wrath of the church. and he was a grand master of the priory of sion. what more could we
want?"

"what more?" sophie pointed to the poem. "how about a knight a pope interred? you heard ms.
gettum. newton was not buried by a catholic pope."

langdon reached for the mouse. "who said anything about a catholic pope?" he clicked on the
"pope" hyperlink, and the complete sentence appeared.

sir isaac newton's burial, attended by kings and nobles, was presided

over by alexander pope, friend and colleague, who gave a stirring

eulogy before sprinkling dirt on the tomb.



langdon looked at sophie. "we had the correct pope on our second hit. alexander." he paused.
"a.pope."

in london lies a knight a. pope interred.

sophie stood up, looking stunned.

jacques sauniere, the master of double-entendres, had proven once again that he was a
frighteningly clever man.



chapter 96

silas awoke with a start.

he had no idea what had awoken him or how long he had been asleep. was i dreaming? sitting up
now on his straw mat, he listened to the quiet breathing of the opus dei residence hall, the stillness
textured only by the soft murmurs of someone praying aloud in a room below him. these were



familiar sounds and should have comforted him.

and yet he felt a sudden and unexpected wariness.

standing, wearing only his undergarments, silas walked to the window. was i followed? the
courtyard below was deserted, exactly as he had seen it when he entered. he listened. silence. so
why am i uneasy? long ago silas had learned to trust his intuition. intuition had kept him alive as a
child on the streets of marseilles long before prison... long before he was born again by the hand of
bishop aringarosa. peering out the window, he now saw the faint outline of a car through the
hedge. on the car's roof was a police siren. a floorboard creaked in the hallway. a door latch
moved.

silas reacted on instinct, surging across the room and sliding to a stop just behind the door as it
crashed open. the first police officer stormed through, swinging his gun left then right at what
appeared an empty room. before he realized where silas was, silas had thrown his shoulder into
the door, crushing a second officer as he came through. as the first officer wheeled to shoot, silas
dove for his legs. the gun went off, the bullet sailing above silas's head, just as he connected with
the officer's shins, driving his legs out from under him, and sending the man down, his head hitting
the floor. the second officer staggered to his feet in the doorway, and silas drove a knee into his
groin, then went clambering over the writhing body into the hall.

almost naked, silas hurled his pale body down the staircase. he knew he had been betrayed, but by
whom? when he reached the foyer, more officers were surging through the front door. silas turned
the other way and dashed deeper into the residence hall. the women 's entrance. every opus dei
building has one. winding down narrow hallways, silas snaked through a kitchen, past terrified
workers, who left to avoid the naked albino as he knocked over bowls and silverware, bursting into
a dark hallway near the boiler room. he now saw the door he sought, an exit light gleaming at the
end.

running full speed through the door out into the rain, silas leapt off the low landing, not seeing the
officer coming the other way until it was too late. the two men collided, silas's broad, naked
shoulder grinding into the man's sternum with crushing force. he drove the officer backward onto
the pavement, landing hard on top of him. the officer's gun clattered away. silas could hear men
running down the hall shouting. rolling, he grabbed the loose gun just as the officers emerged. a
shot rang out on the stairs, and silas felt a searing pain below his ribs. filled with rage, he opened
fire at all three officers, their blood spraying.

a dark shadow loomed behind, coming out of nowhere. the angry hands that grabbed at his bare
shoulders felt as if they were infused with the power of the devil himself. the man roared in his
ear. silas, no!

silas spun and fired. their eyes met. silas was already screaming in horror as bishop aringarosa
fell.



chapter 97

more than three thousand people are entombed or enshrined within westminster abbey. the
colossal stone interior burgeons with the remains of kings, statesmen, scientists, poets, and
musicians. their tombs, packed into every last niche and alcove, range in grandeur from the most
regal of mausoleums — that of queen elizabeth i, whose canopied sarcophagus inhabits its own
private, apsidal chapel — down to the most modest etched floor tiles whose inscriptions have worn
away with centuries of foot traffic, leaving it to one's imagination whose relics might lie below the
tile in the undercroft.

designed in the style of the great cathedrals of amiens, chartres, and canterbury, westminster
abbey is considered neither cathedral nor parish church. it bears the classification of royal
peculiar, subject only to the sovereign. since hosting the coronation of william the conqueror on
christmas day in 1066, the dazzling sanctuary has witnessed an endless procession of royal
ceremonies and affairs of state — from the canonization of edward the confessor, to the marriage of
prince andrew and sarah ferguson, to the funerals of henry v, queen elizabeth i, and lady
diana.

even so, robert langdon currently felt no interest in any of the abbey's ancient history, save one
event — the funeral of the british knight sir isaac newton.

in london lies a knight a pope interred.

hurrying through the grand portico on the north transept, langdon and sophie were met by guards
who politely ushered them through the abbey's newest addition — a large walk-through metal
detector — now present in most historic buildings in london. they both passed through without
setting off the alarm and continued to the abbey entrance.

stepping across the threshold into westminster abbey, langdon felt the outside world evaporate
with a sudden hush. no rumble of traffic. no hiss of rain. just a deafening silence, which seemed to
reverberate back and forth as if the building were whispering to itself.

langdon's and sophie's eyes, like those of almost every visitor, shifted immediately skyward,
where the abbey's great abyss seemed to explode overhead. gray stone columns ascended like
redwoods into the shadows, arching gracefully over dizzying expanses, and then shooting back
down to the stone floor. before them, the wide alley of the north transept stretched out like a deep
canyon, flanked by sheer cliffs of stained glass. on sunny days, the abbey floor was a prismatic
patchwork of light. today, the rain and darkness gave this massive hollow a wraithlike aura... more
like that of the crypt it truly was.



"it's practically empty," sophie whispered.

langdon felt disappointed. he had hoped for a lot more people. a more public place. their earlier
experience in the deserted temple church was not one langdon wanted to repeat. he had been
anticipating a certain feeling of security in the popular tourist destination, but langdon's
recollections of bustling throngs in a well-lit abbey had been formed during the peak summer
tourist season. today was a rainy april morning. rather than crowds and shimmering stained
glass, all langdon saw was acres of desolate floor and shadowy, empty alcoves.

"we passed through metal detectors," sophie reminded, apparently sensing langdon's
apprehension. "if anyone is in here, they can't be armed."

langdon nodded but still felt circumspect. he had wanted to bring the london police with them,
but sophie's fears of who might be involved put a damper on any contact with the authorities. we
need to recover the cryptex, sophie had insisted. it is the key to everything.

she was right, of course.

the key to getting leigh back alive.

the key to finding the holy grail.

the key to learning who is behind this.

unfortunately, their only chance to recover the keystone seemed to be here and now... at the tomb
of isaac newton. whoever held the cryptex would have to pay a visit to the tomb to decipher the
final clue, and if they had not already come and gone, sophie and langdon intended to intercept
them.

striding toward the left wall to get out of the open, they moved into an obscure side aisle behind a
row of pilasters. langdon couldn't shake the image of leigh teabing being held captive, probably
tied up in the back of his own limousine. whoever had ordered the top priory members killed
would not hesitate to eliminate others who stood in the way. it seemed a cruel irony that
teabing — a modern british knight — was a hostage in the search for his own countryman, sir isaac
newton.

"which way is it?" sophie asked, looking around.

the tomb. langdon had no idea. "we should find a docent and ask."

langdon knew better than to wander aimlessly in here. westminster abbey was a tangled warren
of mausoleums, perimeter chambers, and walk-in burial niches. like the louvre's grand gallery, it
had a lone point of entry — the door through which they had just passed — easy to find your way in,



but impossible to find your way out. a literal tourist trap, one of langdon's befuddled colleagues
had called it. keeping architectural tradition, the abbey was laid out in the shape of a giant crucifix.
unlike most churches, however, it had its entrance on the side, rather than the standard rear of the
church via the narthex at the bottom of the nave. moreover, the abbey had a series of sprawling
cloisters attached. one false step through the wrong archway, and a visitor was lost in a labyrinth
of outdoor passageways surrounded by high walls.

"docents wear crimson robes," langdon said, approaching the center of the church. peering
obliquely across the towering gilded altar to the far end of the south transept, langdon saw several
people crawling on their hands and knees. this prostrate pilgrimage was a common occurrence in
poets' corner, although it was far less holy than it appeared. tourists doing grave rubbings.

"i don't see any docents," sophie said. "maybe we can find the tomb on our own?"

without a word, langdon led her another few steps to the center of the abbey and pointed to the
right.

sophie drew a startled breath as she looked down the length of the abbey's nave, the full magnitude
of the building now visible. "aah," she said. "let's find a docent."



at that moment, a hundred yards down the nave, out of sight behind the choir screen, the stately
tomb of sir isaac newton had a lone visitor. the teacher had been scrutinizing the monument for
ten minutes now.

newton's tomb consisted of a massive black-marble sarcophagus on which reclined the sculpted
form of sir isaac newton, wearing classical costume, and leaning proudly against a stack of his
own books — divinity, chronology, opticks, and philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica.
at newton's feet stood two winged boys holding a scroll. behind newton's recumbent body rose
an austere pyramid. although the pyramid itself seemed an oddity, it was the giant shape mounted
halfway up the pyramid that most intrigued the teacher.

an orb.

the teacher pondered sauniere's beguiling riddle. you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb. the
massive orb protruding from the face of the pyramid was carved in basso-relievo and depicted all
kinds of heavenly bodies — constellations, signs of the zodiac, comets, stars, and planets. above it,
the image of the goddess of astronomy beneath a field of stars.

countless orbs.

the teacher had been convinced that once he found the tomb, discerning the missing orb would be



easy. now he was not so sure. he was gazing at a complicated map of the heavens. was there a
missing planet? had some astronomical orb been omitted from a constellation? he had no idea.
even so, the teacher could not help but suspect that the solution would be ingeniously clean and
simple — "a knight a pope interred." what orb am i looking for? certainly, an advanced knowledge
of astrophysics was not a prerequisite for finding the holy grail, was it?

it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb.

the teacher's concentration was broken by several approaching tourists. he slipped the cryptex
back in his pocket and watched warily as the visitors went to a nearby table, left a donation in the
cup, and restocked on the complimentary grave-rubbing supplies set out by the abbey. armed with
fresh charcoal pencils and large sheets of heavy paper, they headed off toward the front of the
abbey, probably to the popular poets' corner to pay their respects to chaucer, tennyson, and
dickens by rubbing furiously on their graves.

alone again, he stepped closer to the tomb, scanning it from bottom to top. he began with the
clawed feet beneath the sarcophagus, moved upward past newton, past his books on science, past
the two boys with their mathematical scroll, up the face of the pyramid to the giant orb with its
constellations, and finally up to the niche's star-filled canopy.

what orb ought to be here... and yet is missing? he touched the cryptex in his pocket as if he could
somehow divine the answer from sauniere's crafted marble. only five letters separate me from the
grail.

pacing now near the corner of the choir screen, he took a deep breath and glanced up the long nave
toward the main altar in the distance. his gaze dropped from the gilded altar down to the bright
crimson robe of an abbey docent who was being waved over by two very familiar individuals.

langdon and neveu.

calmly, the teacher moved two steps back behind the choir screen. that was fast. he had
anticipated langdon and sophie would eventually decipher the poem's meaning and come to
newton's tomb, but this was sooner than he had imagined. taking a deep breath, the teacher
considered his options. he had grown accustomed to dealing with surprises.

/ am holding the cryptex.

reaching down to his pocket, he touched the second object that gave him his confidence: the
medusa revolver. as expected, the abbey's metal detectors had blared as the teacher passed
through with the concealed gun. also as expected, the guards had backed off at once when the
teacher glared indignantly and flashed his identification card. official rank always commanded the
proper respect.



although initially the teacher had hoped to solve the cryptex alone and avoid any further
complications, he now sensed that the arrival of langdon and neveu was actually a welcome
development. considering the lack of success he was having with the "orb" reference, he might be
able to use their expertise. after all, if langdon had deciphered the poem to find the tomb, there
was a reasonable chance he also knew something about the orb. and if langdon knew the
password, then it was just a matter of applying the right pressure.

not here, of course.

somewhere private.

the teacher recalled a small announcement sign he had seen on his way into the abbey.
immediately he knew the perfect place to lure them.

the only question now... what to use as bait.



chapter 98

langdon and sophie moved slowly down the north aisle, keeping to the shadows behind the ample
pillars that separated it from the open nave. despite having traveled more than halfway down the
nave, they still had no clear view of newton's tomb. the sarcophagus was recessed in a niche,
obscured from this oblique angle.

"at least there's nobody over there," sophie whispered.

langdon nodded, relieved. the entire section of the nave near newton's tomb was deserted. "i'll go
over," he whispered. "you should stay hidden just in case someone — "

sophie had already stepped from the shadows and was headed across the open floor.

" — is watching," langdon sighed, hurrying to join her.

crossing the massive nave on a diagonal, langdon and sophie remained silent as the elaborate
sepulchre revealed itself in tantalizing increments... a black-marble sarcophagus... a reclining statue
of newton... two winged boys... a huge pyramid... and... an enormous orb.

"did you know about that?" sophie said, sounding startled.

langdon shook his head, also surprised.

"those look like constellations carved on it," sophie said.



as they approached the niche, langdon felt a slow sinking sensation. newton's tomb was covered
with orbs — stars, comets, planets. you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb? it could turn out to
be like trying to find a missing blade of grass on a golf course.

"astronomical bodies," sophie said, looking concerned. "and a lot of them."

langdon frowned. the only link between the planets and the grail that langdon could imagine
was the pentacle of venus, and he had already tried the password "venus" en route to the temple
church.

sophie moved directly to the sarcophagus, but langdon hung back a few feet, keeping an eye on
the abbey around them.

"divinity, " sophie said, tilting her head and reading the titles of the books on which newton was
leaning. "chronology. opticks. philosophiae naturalis principia mathematica?" she turned to
him. "ring any bells?"

langdon stepped closer, considering it. "principia mathematica, as i remember, has something to
do with the gravitation pull of planets... which admittedly are orbs, but it seems a little far-fetched."

"how about the signs of the zodiac?" sophie asked, pointing to the constellations on the orb. "you
were talking about pisces and aquarius earlier, weren't you?"

the end of days, langdon thought. "the end of pisces and the beginning of aquarius was
allegedly the historical marker at which the priory planned to release the sangreal documents to the
world." but the millennium came and went without incident, leaving historians uncertain when the
truth was coming.

"it seems possible," sophie said, "that the priory's plans to reveal the truth might be related to the
last line of the poem."

it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb. langdon felt a shiver of potential. he had not considered
the line that way before.

"you told me earlier," she said, "that the timing of the priory's plans to unveil the truth about 'the
rose' and her fertile womb was linked directly to the position of planets — orbs."

langdon nodded, feeling the first faint wisps of possibility materializing. even so, his intuition told
him astronomy was not the key. the grand master's previous solutions had all possessed an
eloquent, symbolic significance — the mona lisa, madonna of the rocks, sofia. this eloquence
was definitely lacking in the concept of planetary orbs and the zodiac. thus far, jacques sauniere
had proven himself a meticulous code writer, and langdon had to believe that his final



password — those five letters that unlocked the priory's ultimate secret — would prove to be not only
symbolically fitting but also crystal clear. if this solution were anything like the others, it would be
painfully obvious once it dawned.

"look!" sophie gasped, jarring his thoughts as she grabbed his arm. from the fear in her touch
langdon sensed someone must be approaching, but when he turned to her, she was staring aghast
at the top of the black marble sarcophagus. "someone was here," she whispered, pointing to a spot
on the sarcophagus near newton's outstretched right foot.

langdon did not understand her concern. a careless tourist had left a charcoal, grave-rubbing
pencil on the sarcophagus lid near newton's foot. it's nothing. langdon reached out to pick it up,
but as he leaned toward the sarcophagus, the light shifted on the polished black-marble slab, and
langdon froze. suddenly, he saw why sophie was afraid.

scrawled on the sarcophagus lid, at newton's feet, shimmered a barely visible charcoal-pencil
message:

i have teabing.

go through chapter house,

out south exit, to public garden.



langdon read the words twice, his heart pounding wildly.

sophie turned and scanned the nave.

despite the pall of trepidation that settled over him upon seeing the words, langdon told himself
this was good news. leigh is still alive. there was another implication here too. "they don't know
the password either," he whispered.

sophie nodded. otherwise why make their presence known?

"they may want to trade leigh for the password."

"or it's a trap."

langdon shook his head. "i don't think so. the garden is outside the abbey walls. a very public
place." langdon had once visited the abbey's famous college garden — a small fruit orchard and
herb garden — left over from the days when monks grew natural pharmacological remedies here.
boasting the oldest living fruit trees in great britain, college garden was a popular spot for
tourists to visit without having to enter the abbey. "i think sending us outside is a show of faith. so
we feel safe."



sophie looked dubious. "you mean outside, where there are no metal detectors?"

langdon scowled. she had a point.

gazing back at the orb-filled tomb, langdon wished he had some idea about the cryptex
password... something with which to negotiate. / got leigh involved in this, and i'll do whatever it
takes if there is a chance to help him.

"the note says to go through the chapter house to the south exit," sophie said. "maybe from the
exit we would have a view of the garden? that way we could assess the situation before we walked
out there and exposed ourselves to any danger?"

the idea was a good one. langdon vaguely recalled the chapter house as a huge octagonal hall
where the original british parliament convened in the days before the modern parliament building
existed. it had been years since he had been there, but he remembered it being out through the
cloister somewhere. taking several steps back from the tomb, langdon peered around the choir
screen to his right, across the nave to the side opposite that which they had descended.

a gaping vaulted passageway stood nearby, with a large sign.

this way to:

cloisters

deanery

college hall

museum

pyx chamber

st. faith's chapel

chapter house



langdon and sophie were jogging as they passed beneath the sign, moving too quickly to notice
the small announcement apologizing that certain areas were closed for renovations.

they emerged immediately into a high-walled, open-roof courtyard through which morning rain
was falling. above them, the wind howled across the opening with a low drone, like someone
blowing over the mouth of a bottle. entering the narrow, low-hanging walkways that bordered the
courtyard perimeter, langdon felt the familiar uneasiness he always felt in enclosed spaces. these
walkways were called cloisters, and langdon noted with uneasiness that these particular cloisters
lived up to their latin ties to the word claustrophobic.

focusing his mind straight ahead toward the end of the tunnel, langdon followed the signs for the
chapter house. the rain was spitting now, and the walkway was cold and damp with gusts of rain
that blew through the lone pillared wall that was the cloister's only source of light. another couple



scurried past them the other way, hurrying to get out of the worsening weather. the cloisters
looked deserted now, admittedly the abbey's least enticing section in the wind and rain.

forty yards down the east cloister, an archway materialized on their left, giving way to another
hallway. although this was the entrance they were looking for, the opening was cordoned off by a
swag and an official-looking sign.

closed for renovation

pyx chamber

st. faith's chapel

chapter house



the long, deserted corridor beyond the swag was littered with scaffolding and drop cloths.
immediately beyond the swag, langdon could see the entrances to the pyx chamber and st. faith's
chapel on the right and left. the entrance to the chapter house, however, was much farther away,
at the far end of the long hallway. even from here, langdon could see that its heavy wooden door
was wide open, and the spacious octagonal interior was bathed in a grayish natural light from the
room's enormous windows that looked out on college garden. go through chapter house, out
south exit, to public garden.

"we just left the east cloister," langdon said, "so the south exit to the garden must be through there
and to the right."

sophie was already stepping over the swag and moving forward.

as they hurried down the dark corridor, the sounds of the wind and rain from the open cloister
faded behind them. the chapter house was a kind of satellite structure — a freestanding annex at
the end of the long hallway to ensure the privacy of the parliament proceedings housed there.

"it looks huge," sophie whispered as they approached.

langdon had forgotten just how large this room was. even from outside the entrance, he could
gaze across the vast expanse of floor to the breathtaking windows on the far side of the octagon,
which rose five stories to a vaulted ceiling. they would certainly have a clear view of the garden
from in here.

crossing the threshold, both langdon and sophie found themselves having to squint. after the
gloomy cloisters, the chapter house felt like a solarium. they were a good ten feet into the room,
searching the south wall, when they realized the door they had been promised was not there.

they were standing in an enormous dead end.



the creaking of a heavy door behind them made them turn, just as the door closed with a
resounding thud and the latch fell into place.

the lone man who had been standing behind the door looked calm as he aimed a small revolver at
them. he was portly and was propped on a pair of aluminum crutches.

for a moment langdon thought he must be dreaming.

it was leigh teabing.



chapter 99

sir leigh teabing felt rueful as he gazed out over the barrel of his medusa revolver at robert
langdon and sophie neveu. "my friends," he said, "since the moment you walked into my home
last night, i have done everything in my power to keep you out of harm's way. but your persistence
has now put me in a difficult position."

he could see the expressions of shock and betrayal on sophie's and langdon's faces, and yet he
was confident that soon they would both understand the chain of events that had guided the three of
them to this unlikely crossroads.

there is so much i have to tell you both... so much you do not yet understand.

"please believe," teabing said, "i never had any intention of your being involved. you came to my
home. you came searching for me. "

"leigh?" langdon finally managed. "what the hell are you doing? we thought you were in trouble.
we came here to help you!"

"as i trusted you would," he said. "we have much to discuss."

langdon and sophie seemed unable to tear their stunned gazes from the revolver aimed at them.

"it is simply to ensure your full attention," teabing said. "if i had wanted to harm you, you would
be dead by now. when you walked into my home last night, i risked everything to spare your lives.
i am a man of honor, and i vowed in my deepest conscience only to sacrifice those who had
betrayed the sangreal."

"what are you talking about?" langdon said. "betrayed the sangreal?"

"i discovered a terrible truth," teabing said, sighing. "i learned why the sangreal documents were



never revealed to the world. i learned that the priory had decided not to release the truth after all.
that's why the millennium passed without any revelation, why nothing happened as we entered the
end of days."

langdon drew a breath, about to protest.

"the priory," teabing continued, "was given a sacred charge to share the truth. to release the
sangreal documents when the end of days arrived. for centuries, men like da vinci, botticelli,
and newton risked everything to protect the documents and carry out that charge. and now, at the
ultimate moment of truth, jacques sauniere changed his mind. the man honored with the greatest
responsibility in christian history eschewed his duty. he decided the time was not right." teabing
turned to sophie. "he failed the grail. he failed the priory. and he failed the memory of all the
generations that had worked to make that moment possible."

"you?" sophie declared, glancing up now, her green eyes boring into him with rage and
realization. "you are the one responsible for my grandfather's murder?"

teabing scoffed. "your grandfather and his senechaux were traitors to the grail."

sophie felt a fury rising from deep within. he's lying!

teabing's voice was relentless. "your grandfather sold out to the church. it is obvious they
pressured him to keep the truth quiet."

sophie shook her head. "the church had no influence on my grandfather!"

teabing laughed coldly. "my dear, the church has two thousand years of experience pressuring
those who threaten to unveil its lies. since the days of constantine, the church has successfully
hidden the truth about mary magdalene and jesus. we should not be surprised that now, once
again, they have found a way to keep the world in the dark. the church may no longer employ
crusaders to slaughter non-believers, but their influence is no less persuasive. no less insidious."
he paused, as if to punctuate his next point. "miss neveu, for some time now your grandfather has
wanted to tell you the truth about your family."

sophie was stunned. "how could you know that?"

"my methods are immaterial. the important thing for you to grasp right now is this." he took a
deep breath. "the deaths of your mother, father, grandmother, and brother were not accidental."

the words sent sophie's emotions reeling. she opened her mouth to speak but was unable.

langdon shook his head. "what are you saying?"



"robert, it explains everything. all the pieces fit. history repeats itself. the church has a
precedent of murder when it comes to silencing the sangreal. with the end of days imminent,
killing the grand master's loved ones sent a very clear message. be quiet, or you and sophie are
next."

"it was a car accident," sophie stammered, feeling the childhood pain welling inside her. "an
accident!"

"bedtime stories to protect your innocence," teabing said. "consider that only two family
members went untouched — the priory's grand master and his lone granddaughter — the perfect pair
to provide the church with control over the brotherhood. i can only imagine the terror the church
wielded over your grandfather these past years, threatening to kill you if he dared release the
sangreal secret, threatening to finish the job they started unless sauniere influenced the priory to
reconsider its ancient vow."

"leigh," langdon argued, now visibly riled, "certainly you have no proof that the church had
anything to do with those deaths, or that it influenced the priory's decision to remain silent."

"proof?" teabing fired back. "you want proof the priory was influenced? the new millennium has
arrived, and yet the world remains ignorant! is that not proof enough?"

in the echoes of teabing's words, sophie heard another voice speaking. sophie, i must tell you the
truth about your family. she realized she was trembling. could this possibly be that truth her
grandfather had wanted to tell her? that her family had been murdered? what did she truly know
about the crash that took her family? only sketchy details. even the stories in the newspaper had
been vague. an accident? bedtime stories? sophie flashed suddenly on her grandfather's
overprotectiveness, how he never liked to leave her alone when she was young. even when sophie
was grown and away at university, she had the sense her grandfather was watching over. she
wondered if there had been priory members in the shadows throughout her entire life, looking after
her.

"you suspected he was being manipulated," langdon said, glaring with disbelief at teabing. "so
you murdered him?"

"i did not pull the trigger," teabing said. "sauniere was dead years ago, when the church stole his
family from him. he was compromised. now he is free of that pain, released from the shame
caused by his inability to carry out his sacred duty. consider the alternative. something had to be
done. shall the world be ignorant forever? shall the church be allowed to cement its lies into our
history books for all eternity? shall the church be permitted to influence indefinitely with murder
and extortion? no, something needed to be done! and now we are poised to carry out sauniere's
legacy and right a terrible wrong." he paused. "the three of us. together."

sophie felt only incredulity. "how could you possibly believe that we would help you?"



"because, my dear, you are the reason the priory failed to release the documents. your
grandfather's love for you prevented him from challenging the church. his fear of reprisal against
his only remaining family crippled him. he never had a chance to explain the truth because you
rejected him, tying his hands, making him wait. now you owe the world the truth. you owe it to
the memory of your grandfather."



robert langdon had given up trying to get his bearings. despite the torrent of questions running
through his mind, he knew only one thing mattered now — getting sophie out of here alive. all the
guilt langdon had mistakenly felt earlier for involving teabing had now been transferred to
sophie.

/ took her to chateau villette. i am responsible.

langdon could not fathom that leigh teabing would be capable of killing them in cold blood here
in the chapter house, and yet teabing certainly had been involved in killing others during his
misguided quest. langdon had the uneasy feeling that gunshots in this secluded, thick-walled
chamber would go unheard, especially in this rain. and leigh just admitted his guilt to us.

langdon glanced at sophie, who looked shaken. the church murdered sophie 's family to silence
the priory? langdon felt certain the modern church did not murder people. there had to be some
other explanation.

"let sophie leave," langdon declared, staring at leigh. "you and i should discuss this alone."

teabing gave an unnatural laugh. "i'm afraid that is one show of faith i cannot afford. i can,
however, offer you this. " he propped himself fully on his crutches, gracelessly keeping the gun
aimed at sophie, and removed the keystone from his pocket. he swayed a bit as he held it out for
langdon. "a token of trust, robert."

robert felt wary and didn't move. leigh is giving the keystone back to us?

"take it," teabing said, thrusting it awkwardly toward langdon.

langdon could imagine only one reason teabing would give it back. "you opened it already. you
removed the map."

teabing was shaking his head. "robert, if i had solved the keystone, i would have disappeared to
find the grail myself and kept you uninvolved. no, i do not know the answer. and i can admit that
freely. a true knight learns humility in the face of the grail. he learns to obey the signs placed
before him. when i saw you enter the abbey, i understood. you were here for a reason. to help. i
am not looking for singular glory here. i serve a far greater master than my own pride. the truth.



mankind deserves to know that truth. the grail found us all, and now she is begging to be
revealed. we must work together."

despite teabing's pleas for cooperation and trust, his gun remained trained on sophie as langdon
stepped forward and accepted the cold marble cylinder. the vinegar inside gurgled as langdon
grasped it and stepped backward. the dials were still in random order, and the cryptex remained
locked.

langdon eyed teabing. "how do you know i won't smash it right now?"

teabing's laugh was an eerie chortle. "i should have realized your threat to break it in the temple
church was an empty one. robert langdon would never break the keystone. you are an historian,
robert. you are holding the key to two thousand years of history — the lost key to the sangreal.
you can feel the souls of all the knights burned at the stake to protect her secret. would you have
them die in vain? no, you will vindicate them. you will join the ranks of the great men you
admire — da vinci, botticelli, newton — each of whom would have been honored to be in your
shoes right now. the contents of the keystone are crying out to us. longing to be set free. the time
has come. destiny has led us to this moment."

"i cannot help you, leigh. i have no idea how to open this. i only saw newton's tomb for a
moment. and even if i knew the password..." langdon paused, realizing he had said too much.

"you would not tell me?" teabing sighed. "i am disappointed and surprised, robert, that you do
not appreciate the extent to which you are in my debt. my task would have been far simpler had
remy and i eliminated you both when you walked into chateau villette. instead i risked
everything to take the nobler course."

"this is noble?" langdon demanded, eyeing the gun.

"sauniere's fault," teabing said. "he and his senechaux lied to silas. otherwise, i would have
obtained the keystone without complication. how was i to imagine the grand master would go to
such ends to deceive me and bequeath the keystone to an estranged granddaughter?" teabing
looked at sophie with disdain. "someone so unqualified to hold this knowledge that she required a
symbologist baby-sitter." teabing glanced back at langdon. "fortunately, robert, your
involvement turned out to be my saving grace. rather than the keystone remaining locked in the
depository bank forever, you extracted it and walked into my home."

where else would i run? langdon thought. the community of grail historians is small, and
teabing and i have a history together.

teabing now looked smug. "when i learned sauniere left you a dying message, i had a pretty good
idea you were holding valuable priory information. whether it was the keystone itself, or
information on where to find it, i was not sure. but with the police on your heels, i had a sneaking



suspicion you might arrive on my doorstep."

langdon glared. "and if we had not?"

"i was formulating a plan to extend you a helping hand. one way or another, the keystone was
coming to chateau villette. the fact that you delivered it into my waiting hands only serves as
proof that my cause is just."

"what!" langdon was appalled.

"silas was supposed to break in and steal the keystone from you in chateau villette — thus
removing you from the equation without hurting you, and exonerating me from any suspicion of
complicity. however, when i saw the intricacy of sauniere's codes, i decided to include you both in
my quest a bit longer. i could have silas steal the keystone later, once i knew enough to carry on
alone."

"the temple church," sophie said, her tone awash with betrayal.



light begins to dawn, teabing thought. the temple church was the perfect location to steal the
keystone from robert and sophie, and its apparent relevance to the poem made it a plausible
decoy. remy's orders had been clear — stay out of sight while silas recovers the keystone.
unfortunately, langdon's threat to smash the keystone on the chapel floor had caused remy to
panic. if only remy had not revealed himself, teabing thought ruefully, recalling his own mock
kidnapping. remy was the sole link to me, and he showed his face!

fortunately, silas remained unaware of teabing's true identity and was easily fooled into taking
him from the church and then watching naively as remy pretended to tie their hostage in the back
of the limousine. with the soundproof divider raised, teabing was able to phone silas in the front
seat, use the fake french accent of the teacher, and direct silas to go straight to opus dei. a
simple anonymous tip to the police was all it would take to remove silas from the picture.

one loose end tied up.

the other loose end was harder. remy.

teabing struggled deeply with the decision, but in the end remy had proven himself a liability.
every grail quest requires sacrifice. the cleanest solution had been staring teabing in the face
from the limousine's wet bar — a flask, some cognac, and a can of peanuts. the powder at the
bottom of the can would be more than enough to trigger remy's deadly allergy. when remy
parked the limo on horse guards parade, teabing climbed out of the back, walked to the side
passenger door, and sat in the front next to remy. minutes later, teabing got out of the car,



climbed into the rear again, cleaned up the evidence, and finally emerged to carry out the final
phase of his mission.

westminster abbey had been a short walk, and although teabing's leg braces, crutches, and gun
had set off the metal detector, the rent-a-cops never knew what to do. do we ask him to remove his
braces and crawl through? do we frisk his deformed body? teabing presented the flustered guards
a far easier solution — an embossed card identifying him as knight of the realm. the poor fellows
practically tripped over one another ushering him in.

now, eyeing the bewildered langdon and neveu, teabing resisted the urge to reveal how he had
brilliantly implicated opus dei in the plot that would soon bring about the demise of the entire
church. that would have to wait. right now there was work to do.

"mes amis, " teabing declared in flawless french, "vous ne trouvezpas le saint-graal, c'est le
saint-graal qui vous trouve. " he smiled. "our paths together could not be more clear. the grail
has found us."

silence.

he spoke to them in a whisper now. "listen. can you hear it? the grail is speaking to us across the
centuries. she is begging to be saved from the priory's folly. i implore you both to recognize this
opportunity. there could not possibly be three more capable people assembled at this moment to
break the final code and open the cryptex." teabing paused, his eyes alight. "we need to swear an
oath together. a pledge of faith to one another. a knight's allegiance to uncover the truth and make
it known."

sophie stared deep into teabing's eyes and spoke in a steely tone. "i will never swear an oath with
my grandfather's murderer. except an oath that i will see you go to prison."

teabing's heart turned grave, then resolute. "i am sorry you feel that way, mademoiselle." he
turned and aimed the gun at langdon. "and you, robert? are you with me, or against me?"



chapter 100

bishop manuel aringarosa's body had endured many kinds of pain, and yet the searing heat of the
bullet wound in his chest felt profoundly foreign to him. deep and grave. not a wound of the
flesh... but closer to the soul.

he opened his eyes, trying to see, but the rain on his face blurred his vision. where am i? he could
feel powerful arms holding him, carrying his limp body like a rag doll, his black cassock flapping.



lifting a weary arm, he mopped his eyes and saw the man holding him was silas. the great albino
was struggling down a misty sidewalk, shouting for a hospital, his voice a heartrending wail of
agony. his red eyes were focused dead ahead, tears streaming down his pale, blood- spattered face.

"my son," aringarosa whispered, "you're hurt."

silas glanced down, his visage contorted in anguish. "i am so very sorry, father." he seemed
almost too pained to speak.

"no, silas," aringarosa replied. "it is i who am sorry. this is my fault." the teacher promised me
there would be no killing, and i told you to obey him fully. "i was too eager. too fearful. you and i
were deceived." the teacher was never going to deliver us the holy grail.

cradled in the arms of the man he had taken in all those years ago, bishop aringarosa felt himself
reel back in time. to spain. to his modest beginnings, building a small catholic church in oviedo
with silas. and later, to new york city, where he had proclaimed the glory of god with the
towering opus dei center on lexington avenue.

five months ago, aringarosa had received devastating news. his life's work was in jeopardy. he
recalled, with vivid detail, the meeting inside castel gandolfo that had changed his life... the news
that had set this entire calamity into motion.

aringarosa had entered gandolfo's astronomy library with his head held high, fully expecting to
be lauded by throngs of welcoming hands, all eager to pat him on the back for his superior work
representing catholicism in america.

but only three people were present.

the vatican secretariat. obese. dour.

two high-ranking italian cardinals. sanctimonious. smug.

"secretariat?" aringarosa said, puzzled.

the rotund overseer of legal affairs shook aringarosa's hand and motioned to the chair opposite
him. "please, make yourself comfortable."

aringarosa sat, sensing something was wrong.

"i am not skilled in small talk, bishop," the secretariat said, "so let me be direct about the reason
for your visit."

"please. speak openly." aringarosa glanced at the two cardinals, who seemed to be measuring him



with self-righteous anticipation.

"as you are well aware," the secretariat said, "his holiness and others in rome have been
concerned lately with the political fallout from opus dei's more controversial practices."

aringarosa felt himself bristle instantly. he already had been through this on numerous occasions
with the new pontiff, who, to aringarosa's great dismay, had turned out to be a distressingly fervent
voice for liberal change in the church.

"i want to assure you," the secretariat added quickly, "that his holiness does not seek to change
anything about the way you run your ministry. "

/ should hope not! "then why am i here?"

the enormous man sighed. "bishop, i am not sure how to say this delicately, so i will state it
directly. two days ago, the secretariat council voted unanimously to revoke the vatican's sanction
of opus dei."

aringarosa was certain he had heard incorrectly. "i beg your pardon?"

"plainly stated, six months from today, opus dei will no longer be considered a prelature of the
vatican. you will be a church unto yourself. the holy see will be disassociating itself from you.
his holiness agrees and we are already drawing up the legal papers."

"but... that is impossible!"

"on the contrary, it is quite possible. and necessary. his holiness has become uneasy with your
aggressive recruiting policies and your practices of corporal mortification." he paused. "also your
policies regarding women. quite frankly, opus dei has become a liability and an embarrassment."

bishop aringarosa was stupefied. "an embarrassment?"

"certainly you cannot be surprised it has come to this."

"opus dei is the only catholic organization whose numbers are growing! we now have over
eleven hundred priests ! "

"true. a troubling issue for us all."

aringarosa shot to his feet. "ask his holiness if opus dei was an embarrassment in 1982 when we
helped the vatican bank!"

"the vatican will always be grateful for that," the secretariat said, his tone appeasing, "and yet



there are those who still believe your financial munificence in 1982 is the only reason you were
granted prelature status in the first place."

"that is not true!" the insinuation offended aringarosa deeply.

"whatever the case, we plan to act in good faith. we are drawing up severance terms that will
include a reimbursement of those monies. it will be paid in five installments."

"you are buying me off?" aringarosa demanded. "paying me to go quietly? when opus dei is the
only remaining voice of reason!"

one of the cardinals glanced up. "i'm sorry, did you say reason?"

aringarosa leaned across the table, sharpening his tone to a point. "do you really wonder why
catholics are leaving the church? look around you, cardinal. people have lost respect. the rigors
of faith are gone. the doctrine has become a buffet line. abstinence, confession, communion,
baptism, mass — take your pick — choose whatever combination pleases you and ignore the rest.
what kind of spiritual guidance is the church offering?"

"third-century laws," the second cardinal said, "cannot be applied to the modern followers of
christ. the rules are not workable in today's society."

"well, they seem to be working for opus dei!"

"bishop aringarosa," the secretariat said, his voice conclusive. "out of respect for your
organization's relationship with the previous pope, his holiness will be giving opus dei six
months to voluntarily break away from the vatican. i suggest you cite your differences of opinion
with the holy see and establish yourself as your own christian organization."

"i refuse!" aringarosa declared. "and i'll tell him that in person!"

"i'm afraid his holiness no longer cares to meet with you."

aringarosa stood up. "he would not dare abolish a personal prelature established by a previous
pope!"

"i'm sorry." the secretariat's eyes did not flinch. "the lord giveth and the lord taketh away."

aringarosa had staggered from that meeting in bewilderment and panic. returning to new york,
he stared out at the skyline in disillusionment for days, overwhelmed with sadness for the future of
christianity.

it was several weeks later that he received the phone call that changed all that. the caller sounded



french and identified himself as the teacher — a title common in the prelature. he said he knew of
the vatican's plans to pull support from opus dei.

how could he know that? aringarosa wondered. he had hoped only a handful of vatican power
brokers knew of opus dei's impending annulment. apparently the word was out. when it came to
containing gossip, no walls in the world were as porous as those surrounding vatican city.

"i have ears everywhere, bishop," the teacher whispered, "and with these ears i have gained
certain knowledge. with your help, i can uncover the hiding place of a sacred relic that will bring
you enormous power... enough power to make the vatican bow before you. enough power to save
the faith." he paused. "not just for opus dei. but for all of us."

the lord taketh away... and the lord giveth. aringarosa felt a glorious ray of hope. "tell me your
plan."



bishop aringarosa was unconscious when the doors of st. mary's hospital hissed open. silas
lurched into the entryway delirious with exhaustion. dropping to his knees on the tile floor, he
cried out for help. everyone in the reception area gaped in wonderment at the half-naked albino
offering forth a bleeding clergyman.

the doctor who helped silas heave the delirious bishop onto a gurney looked gloomy as he felt
aringarosa's pulse. "he's lost a lot of blood. i am not hopeful."

aringarosa's eyes flickered, and he returned for a moment, his gaze locating silas. "my child..."

silas's soul thundered with remorse and rage. "father, if it takes my lifetime, i will find the one
who deceived us, and i will kill him."

aringarosa shook his head, looking sad as they prepared to wheel him away. "silas... if you have
learned nothing from me, please... learn this." he took silas's hand and gave it a firm squeeze.
"forgiveness is god's greatest gift."

"but father..."

aringarosa closed his eyes. "silas, you must pray."



chapter 101

robert langdon stood beneath the lofty cupola of the deserted chapter house and stared into the



barrel of leigh teabing's gun.

robert, are you with me, or against me? the royal historian's words echoed in the silence of
langdon's mind.

there was no viable response, langdon knew. answer yes, and he would be selling out sophie.
answer no, and teabing would have no choice but to kill them both.

langdon's years in the classroom had not imbued him with any skills relevant to handling
confrontations at gunpoint, but the classroom had taught him something about answering
paradoxical questions. when a question has no correct answer, there is only one honest response.

the gray area between yes and no.

silence.

staring at the cryptex in his hands, langdon chose simply to walk away.

without ever lifting his eyes, he stepped backward, out into the room's vast empty spaces. neutral
ground. he hoped his focus on the cryptex signaled teabing that collaboration might be an option,
and that his silence signaled sophie he had not abandoned her.

all the while buying time to think.

the act of thinking, langdon suspected, was exactly what teabing wanted him to do. that's why
he handed me the cryptex. so i could feel the weight of my decision. the british historian hoped the
touch of the grand master's cryptex would make langdon fully grasp the magnitude of its
contents, coaxing his academic curiosity to overwhelm all else, forcing him to realize that failure to
unlock the keystone would mean the loss of history itself.

with sophie at gunpoint across the room, langdon feared that discovering the cryptex's elusive
password would be his only remaining hope of bartering her release. if i can free the map, teabing
will negotiate. forcing his mind to this critical task, langdon moved slowly toward the far
windows... allowing his mind to fill with the numerous astronomical images on newton's tomb.

you seek the orb that ought be on his tomb.
it speaks of rosy flesh and seeded womb.



turning his back to the others, he walked toward the towering windows, searching for any
inspiration in their stained-glass mosaics. there was none.

place yourself in sauniere's mind, he urged, gazing outward now into college garden. what would



he believe is the orb that ought be on newton's tomb? images of stars, comets, and planets
twinkled in the falling rain, but langdon ignored them. sauniere was not a man of science. he was
a man of humanity, of art, of history. the sacred feminine... the chalice... the rose... the banished
mary magdalene... the decline of the goddess... the holy grail.

legend had always portrayed the grail as a cruel mistress, dancing in the shadows just out of sight,
whispering in your ear, luring you one more step and then evaporating into the mist.

gazing out at the rustling trees of college garden, langdon sensed her playful presence. the signs
were everywhere. like a taunting silhouette emerging from the fog, the branches of britain's oldest
apple tree burgeoned with five-petaled blossoms, all glistening like venus. the goddess was in the
garden now. she was dancing in the rain, singing songs of the ages, peeking out from behind the
bud-filled branches as if to remind langdon that the fruit of knowledge was growing just beyond
his reach.



across the room, sir leigh teabing watched with confidence as langdon gazed out the window as
if under a spell.

exactly as i hoped, teabing thought. he will come around.

for some time now, teabing had suspected langdon might hold the key to the grail. it was no
coincidence that teabing launched his plan into action on the same night langdon was scheduled
to meet jacques sauniere. listening in on the curator, teabing was certain the man's eagerness to
meet privately with langdon could mean only one thing. langdon' s mysterious manuscript has
touched a nerve with the priory.

langdon has stumbled onto a truth, and sauniere fears its release. teabing felt certain the grand
master was summoning langdon to silence him.

the truth has been silenced long enough!

teabing knew he had to act quickly. silas's attack would accomplish two goals. it would prevent
sauniere from persuading langdon to keep quiet, and it would ensure that once the keystone was
in teabing's hands, langdon would be in paris for recruitment should teabing need him.

arranging the fatal meeting between sauniere and silas had been almost too easy. / had inside
information about sauniere 's deepest fears. yesterday afternoon, silas had phoned the curator and
posed as a distraught priest. "monsieur sauniere, forgive me, i must speak to you at once. i should
never breach the sanctity of the confessional, but in this case, i feel i must. i just took confession
from a man who claimed to have murdered members of your family. "



sauniere's response was startled but wary. "my family died in an accident. the police report was
conclusive."

"yes, a car accident," silas said, baiting the hook. "the man i spoke to said he forced their car off
the road into a river. "

sauniere fell silent.

"monsieur sauniere, i would never have phoned you directly except this man made a comment
which makes me now fear for your safety." he paused. "the man also mentioned your
granddaughter, sophie."

the mention of sophie's name had been the catalyst. the curator leapt into action. he ordered silas
to come see him immediately in the safest location sauniere knew — his louvre office. then he
phoned sophie to warn her she might be in danger. drinks with robert langdon were instantly
abandoned.

now, with langdon separated from sophie on the far side of the room, teabing sensed he had
successfully alienated the two companions from one another. sophie neveu remained defiant, but
langdon clearly saw the larger picture. he was trying to figure out the password. he understands
the importance of finding the grail and releasing her from bondage.

"he won't open it for you," sophie said coldly. "even if he can."

teabing was glancing at langdon as he held the gun on sophie. he was fairly certain now he was
going to have to use the weapon. although the idea troubled him, he knew he would not hesitate if
it came to that. / have given her every opportunity to do the right thing. the grail is bigger than
any one of us.

at that moment, langdon turned from the window. "the tomb..." he said suddenly, facing them
with a faint glimmer of hope in his eyes. "i know where to look on newton's tomb. yes, i think i
can find the password!"

teabing's heart soared. "where, robert? tell me!"

sophie sounded horrified. "robert, no! you're not going to help him, are you?"

langdon approached with a resolute stride, holding the cryptex before him. "no," he said, his eyes
hardening as he turned to leigh. "not until he lets you go."

teabing's optimism darkened. "we are so close, robert. don't you dare start playing games with
me!"



"no games," langdon said. "let her go. then i'll take you to newton's tomb. we'll open the
cryptex together."

"i'm not going anywhere," sophie declared, her eyes narrowing with rage. "that cryptex was given
to me by my grandfather. it is not yours to open."

langdon wheeled, looking fearful. "sophie, please! you're in danger. i'm trying to help you!"

"how? by unveiling the secret my grandfather died trying to protect? he trusted you, robert. /
trusted you!"

langdon's blue eyes showed panic now, and teabing could not help but smile to see the two of
them working against one another. langdon's attempts to be gallant were more pathetic than
anything. on the verge of unveiling one of history's greatest secrets, and he troubles himself with a
woman who has proven herself unworthy of the quest.

"sophie," langdon pleaded. "please... you must leave."

she shook her head. "not unless you either hand me the cryptex or smash it on the floor."

"what?" langdon gasped.

"robert, my grandfather would prefer his secret lost forever than see it in the hands of his
murderer." sophie's eyes looked as if they would well with tears, but they did not. she stared
directly back at teabing. "shoot me if you have to. i am not leaving my grandfather's legacy in
your hands."

very well. teabing aimed the weapon.

"no!" langdon shouted, raising his arm and suspending the cryptex precariously over the hard
stone floor. "leigh, if you even think about it, i will drop this."

teabing laughed. "that bluff worked on remy. not on me. i know you better than that."

"do you, leigh?"

yes i do. your poker face needs work, my friend. it took me several seconds, but i can see now that
you are lying. you have no idea where on newton 's tomb the answer lies. "truly, robert? you
know where on the tomb to look?"



"ida"

the falter in langdon's eyes was fleeting but leigh caught it. there was a lie there. a desperate,



pathetic ploy to save sophie. teabing felt a profound disappointment in robert langdon.

/ am a lone knight, surrounded by unworthy souls. and i will have to decipher the keystone on my
own.

langdon and neveu were nothing but a threat to teabing now... and to the grail. as painful as the
solution was going to be, he knew he could carry it out with a clean conscience. the only challenge
would be to persuade langdon to set down the keystone so teabing could safely end this charade.

"a show of faith," teabing said, lowering the gun from sophie. "set down the keystone, and we'll
talk."



langdon knew his lie had failed.

he could see the dark resolve in teabing's face and knew the moment was upon them. when i set
this down, he will kill us both. even without looking at sophie, he could hear her heart beseeching
him in silent desperation. robert, this man is not worthy of the grail. please do not place it in his
hands. no matter what the cost.

langdon had already made his decision several minutes ago, while standing alone at the window
overlooking college garden.

protect sophie.

protect the grail.

langdon had almost shouted out in desperation. but i cannot see how!

the stark moments of disillusionment had brought with them a clarity unlike any he had ever felt.
the truth is right before your eyes, robert. he knew not from where the epiphany came. the grail
is not mocking you, she is calling out to a worthy soul.

now, bowing down like a subject several yards in front of leigh teabing, langdon lowered the
cryptex to within inches of the stone floor.

"yes, robert," teabing whispered, aiming the gun at him. "set it down."

langdon's eyes moved heavenward, up into the gaping void of the chapter house cupola.
crouching lower, langdon lowered his gaze to teabing's gun, aimed directly at him.

"i'm sorry, leigh."



in one fluid motion, langdon leapt up, swinging his arm skyward, launching the cryptex straight
up toward the dome above.



leigh teabing did not feel his finger pull the trigger, but the medusa discharged with a thundering
crash. langdon's crouched form was now vertical, almost airborne, and the bullet exploded in the
floor near langdon's feet. half of teabing's brain attempted to adjust his aim and fire again in rage,
but the more powerful half dragged his eyes upward into the cupola.

the keystone!

time seemed to freeze, morphing into a slow-motion dream as teabing's entire world became the
airborne keystone. he watched it rise to the apex of its climb... hovering for a moment in the void...
and then tumbling downward, end over end, back toward the stone floor.

all of teabing's hopes and dreams were plummeting toward earth. it cannot strike the floor! i can
reach it! teabing's body reacted on instinct. he released the gun and heaved himself forward,
dropping his crutches as he reached out with his soft, manicured hands. stretching his arms and
fingers, he snatched the keystone from midair.

falling forward with the keystone victoriously clutched in his hand, teabing knew he was falling
too fast. with nothing to break his fall, his outstretched arms hit first, and the cryptex collided hard
with the floor.

there was a sickening crunch of glass within.

for a full second, teabing did not breathe. lying there outstretched on the cold floor, staring the
length of his outstretched arms at the marble cylinder in his bare palms, he implored the glass vial
inside to hold. then the acrid tang of vinegar cut the air, and teabing felt the cool liquid flowing
out through the dials onto his palm.

wild panic gripped him. no! the vinegar was streaming now, and teabing pictured the papyrus
dissolving within. robert, you fool! the secret is lost!

teabing felt himself sobbing uncontrollably. the grail is gone. everything destroyed. shuddering
in disbelief over langdon's actions, teabing tried to force the cylinder apart, longing to catch a
fleeting glimpse of history before it dissolved forever. to his shock, as he pulled the ends of the
keystone, the cylinder separated.

he gasped and peered inside. it was empty except for shards of wet glass. no dissolving papyrus.
teabing rolled over and looked up at langdon. sophie stood beside him, aiming the gun down at
teabing.



bewildered, teabing looked back at the keystone and saw it. the dials were no longer at random.
they spelled a five-letter word: apple.



"the orb from which eve partook," langdon said coolly, "incurring the holy wrath of god.
original sin. the symbol of the fall of the sacred feminine."

teabing felt the truth come crashing down on him in excruciating austerity. the orb that ought be
on newton's tomb could be none other than the rosy apple that fell from heaven, struck newton on
the head, and inspired his life's work. his labor's fruit! the rosy flesh with a seeded womb!

"robert," teabing stammered, overwhelmed. "you opened it. where... is the map?"

without blinking, langdon reached into the breast pocket of his tweed coat and carefully extracted
a delicate rolled papyrus. only a few yards from where teabing lay, langdon unrolled the scroll
and looked at it. after a long moment, a knowing smile crossed langdon's face.

he knows! teabing's heart craved that knowledge. his life's dream was right in front of him. "tell
me!" teabing demanded. "please! oh god, please! it's not too late!"

as the sound of heavy footsteps thundered down the hall toward the chapter house, langdon
quietly rolled the papyrus and slipped it back in his pocket.



"no!" teabing cried out, trying in vain to stand.

when the doors burst open, bezu fache entered like a bull into a ring, his feral eyes scanning,
finding his target — leigh teabing — helpless on the floor. exhaling in relief, fache holstered his
manurhin sidearm and turned to sophie. "agent neveu, i am relieved you and mr. langdon are
safe. you should have come in when i asked."

the british police entered on fache's heels, seizing the anguished prisoner and placing him in
handcuffs.

sophie seemed stunned to see fache. "how did you find us?"

fache pointed to teabing. "he made the mistake of showing his id when he entered the abbey.
the guards heard a police broadcast about our search for him."

"it's in langdon's pocket!" teabing was screaming like a madman. "the map to the holy grail!"

as they hoisted teabing and carried him out, he threw back his head and howled. "robert! tell me



where it's hidden!"

as teabing passed, langdon looked him in the eye. "only the worthy find the grail, leigh. you
taught me that. "



chapter 102

the mist had settled low on kensington gardens as silas limped into a quiet hollow out of sight.
kneeling on the wet grass, he could feel a warm stream of blood flowing from the bullet wound
below his ribs. still, he stared straight ahead.

the fog made it look like heaven here.

raising his bloody hands to pray, he watched the raindrops caress his fingers, turning them white
again. as the droplets fell harder across his back and shoulders, he could feel his body disappearing
bit by bit into the mist.

/ am a ghost.

a breeze rustled past him, carrying the damp, earthy scent of new life. with every living cell in his
broken body, silas prayed. he prayed for forgiveness. he prayed for mercy. and, above all, he
prayed for his mentor... bishop aringarosa... that the lord would not take him before his time. he
has so much work left to do.

the fog was swirling around him now, and silas felt so light that he was sure the wisps would
carry him away. closing his eyes, he said a final prayer.

from somewhere in the mist, the voice of manuel aringarosa whispered to him.

our lord is a good and merciful god.

silas's pain at last began to fade, and he knew the bishop was right.



chapter 103

it was late afternoon when the london sun broke through and the city began to dry. bezu fache
felt weary as he emerged from the interrogation room and hailed a cab. sir leigh teabing had
vociferously proclaimed his innocence, and yet from his incoherent rantings about the holy grail,



secret documents, and mysterious brotherhoods, fache suspected the wily historian was setting the
stage for his lawyers to plead an insanity defense.

sure, fache thought. insane. teabing had displayed ingenious precision in formulating a plan that
protected his innocence at every turn. he had exploited both the vatican and opus dei, two groups
that turned out to be completely innocent. his dirty work had been carried out unknowingly by a
fanatical monk and a desperate bishop. more clever still, teabing had situated his electronic
listening post in the one place a man with polio could not possibly reach. the actual surveillance
had been carried out by his manservant, remy — the lone person privy to teabing's true
identity — now conveniently dead of an allergic reaction.

hardly the handiwork of someone lacking mental faculties, fache thought.

the information coming from collet out of chateau villette suggested that teabing's cunning ran
so deep that fache himself might even learn from it. to successfully hide bugs in some of paris's
most powerful offices, the british historian had turned to the greeks. trojan horses. some of
teabing's intended targets received lavish gifts of artwork, others unwittingly bid at auctions in
which teabing had placed specific lots. in sauniere's case, the curator had received a dinner
invitation to chateau villette to discuss the possibility of teabing's funding a new da vinci wing
at the louvre. sauniere's invitation had contained an innocuous postscript expressing fascination
with a robotic knight that sauniere was rumored to have built. bring him to dinner, teabing had
suggested. sauniere apparently had done just that and left the knight unattended long enough for
remy legaludec to make one inconspicuous addition.

now, sitting in the back of the cab, fache closed his eyes. one more thing to attend to before i
return to paris.



the st. mary's hospital recovery room was sunny.

"you've impressed us all," the nurse said, smiling down at him. "nothing short of miraculous."

bishop aringarosa gave a weak smile. "i have always been blessed."

the nurse finished puttering, leaving the bishop alone. the sunlight felt welcome and warm on his
face. last night had been the darkest night of his life.

despondently, he thought of silas, whose body had been found in the park.

please forgive me, my son.

aringarosa had longed for silas to be part of his glorious plan. last night, however, aringarosa had



received a call from bezu fache, questioning the bishop about his apparent connection to a nun
who had been murdered in saint-sulpice. aringarosa realized the evening had taken a horrifying
turn. news of the four additional murders transformed his horror to anguish. silas, what have you
done! unable to reach the teacher, the bishop knew he had been cut loose. used. the only way to
stop the horrific chain of events he had helped put in motion was to confess everything to fache,
and from that moment on, aringarosa and fache had been racing to catch up with silas before the
teacher persuaded him to kill again.

feeling bone weary, aringarosa closed his eyes and listened to the television coverage of the arrest
of a prominent british knight, sir leigh teabing. the teacher laid bare for all to see. teabing had
caught wind of the vatican's plans to disassociate itself from opus dei. he had chosen aringarosa
as the perfect pawn in his plan. after all, who more likely to leap blindly after the holy grail than
a man like myself with everything to lose? the grail would have brought enormous power to
anyone who possessed it.

leigh teabing had protected his identity shrewdly — feigning a french accent and a pious heart,
and demanding as payment the one thing he did not need — money. aringarosa had been far too
eager to be suspicious. the price tag of twenty million euro was paltry when compared with the
prize of obtaining the grail, and with the vatican's separation payment to opus dei, the finances
had worked nicely. the blind see what they want to see. teabing's ultimate insult, of course, had
been to demand payment in vatican bonds, such that if anything went wrong, the investigation
would lead to rome.

"i am glad to see you're well, my lord."

aringarosa recognized the gruff voice in the doorway, but the face was unexpected — stern,
powerful features, slicked-back hair, and a broad neck that strained against his dark suit. "captain
fache?" aringarosa asked. the compassion and concern the captain had shown for aringarosa's
plight last night had conjured images of a far gentler physique.

the captain approached the bed and hoisted a familiar, heavy black briefcase onto a chair. "i
believe this belongs to you."

aringarosa looked at the briefcase filled with bonds and immediately looked away, feeling only
shame. "yes... thank you." he paused while working his fingers across the seam of his bedsheet,
then continued. "captain, i have been giving this deep thought, and i need to ask a favor of you."

"of course."

"the families of those in paris who silas..." he paused, swallowing the emotion. "i realize no sum
could possibly serve as sufficient restitution, and yet, if you could be kind enough to divide the
contents of this briefcase among them... the families of the deceased."



fache's dark eyes studied him a long moment. "a virtuous gesture, my lord. i will see to it your
wishes are carried out. "

a heavy silence fell between them.

on the television, a lean french police officer was giving a press conference in front of a sprawling
mansion. fache saw who it was and turned his attention to the screen.

"lieutenant collet," a bbc reporter said, her voice accusing. "last night, your captain publicly
charged two innocent people with murder. will robert langdon and sophie neveu be seeking
accountability from your department? will this cost captain fache his job?"

lieutenant collet's smile was tired but calm. "it is my experience that captain bezu fache seldom
makes mistakes. i have not yet spoken to him on this matter, but knowing how he operates, i
suspect his public manhunt for agent neveu and mr. langdon was part of a ruse to lure out the
real killer. "

the reporters exchanged surprised looks.

collet continued. "whether or not mr. langdon and agent neveu were willing participants in the
sting, i do not know. captain fache tends to keep his more creative methods to himself. all i can
confirm at this point is that the captain has successfully arrested the man responsible, and that mr.
langdon and agent neveu are both innocent and safe."

fache had a faint smile on his lips as he turned back to aringarosa. "a good man, that collet."

several moments passed. finally, fache ran his hand over his forehead, slicking back his hair as he
gazed down at aringarosa. "my lord, before i return to paris, there is one final matter i'd like to
discuss — your impromptu flight to london. you bribed a pilot to change course. in doing so, you
broke a number of international laws."

aringarosa slumped. "i was desperate."

"yes. as was the pilot when my men interrogated him." fache reached in his pocket and produced
a purple amethyst ring with a familiar hand-tooled mitre-crozier applique.

aringarosa felt tears welling as he accepted the ring and slipped it back on his finger. "you've been
so kind." he held out his hand and clasped fache's. "thank you."

fache waved off the gesture, walking to the window and gazing out at the city, his thoughts
obviously far away. when he turned, there was an uncertainty about him. "my lord, where do you
go from here?"



aringarosa had been asked the exact same question as he left castel gandolfo the night before. "i
suspect my path is as uncertain as yours."

"yes." fache paused. "i suspect i will be retiring early."

aringarosa smiled. "a little faith can do wonders, captain. a little faith. "



chapter 104

rosslyn chapel — often called the cathedral of codes — stands seven miles south of edinburgh,
scotland, on the site of an ancient mithraic temple. built by the knights templar in 1446, the
chapel is engraved with a mind-boggling array of symbols from the jewish, christian, egyptian,
masonic, and pagan traditions.

the chapel's geographic coordinates fall precisely on the north-south meridian that runs through
glastonbury. this longitudinal rose line is the traditional marker of king arthur's isle of avalon
and is considered the central pillar of britain's sacred geometry. it is from this hallowed rose line
that rosslyn — originally spelled roslin — takes its name.

rosslyn's rugged spires were casting long evening shadows as robert langdon and sophie neveu
pulled their rental car into the grassy parking area at the foot of the bluff on which the chapel stood.
their short flight from london to edinburgh had been restful, although neither of them had slept
for the anticipation of what lay ahead. gazing up at the stark edifice framed against a cloud-swept
sky, langdon felt like alice falling headlong into the rabbit hole. this must be a dream. and yet he
knew the text of sauniere's final message could not have been more specific.

the holy grail 'neath ancient roslin waits.



langdon had fantasized that sauniere's "grail map" would be a diagram — a drawing with an x-
marks-the-spot — and yet the priory's final secret had been unveiled in the same way sauniere had
spoken to them from the beginning. simple verse. four explicit lines that pointed without a doubt
to this very spot. in addition to identifying rosslyn by name, the verse made reference to several of
the chapel's renowned architectural features.

despite the clarity of sauniere's final revelation, langdon had been left feeling more off balance
than enlightened. to him, rosslyn chapel seemed far too obvious a location. for centuries, this
stone chapel had echoed with whispers of the holy grail's presence. the whispers had turned to
shouts in recent decades when ground-penetrating radar revealed the presence of an astonishing
structure beneath the chapel — a massive subterranean chamber. not only did this deep vault dwarf
the chapel atop it, but it appeared to have no entrance or exit. archaeologists petitioned to begin



blasting through the bedrock to reach the mysterious chamber, but the rosslyn trust expressly
forbade any excavation of the sacred site. of course, this only fueled the fires of speculation. what
was the rosslyn trust trying to hide?

rosslyn had now become a pilgrimage site for mystery seekers. some claimed they were drawn
here by the powerful magnetic field that emanated inexplicably from these coordinates, some
claimed they came to search the hillside for a hidden entrance to the vault, but most admitted they
had come simply to wander the grounds and absorb the lore of the holy grail.

although langdon had never been to rosslyn before now, he always chuckled when he heard the
chapel described as the current home of the holy grail. admittedly, rosslyn once might have been
home to the grail, long ago... but certainly no longer. far too much attention had been drawn to
rosslyn in past decades, and sooner or later someone would find a way to break into the vault.

true grail academics agreed that rosslyn was a decoy — one of the devious dead ends the priory
crafted so convincingly. tonight, however, with the priory's keystone offering a verse that pointed
directly to this spot, langdon no longer felt so smug. a perplexing question had been running
through his mind all day:

why would sauniere go to such effort to guide us to so obvious a location?

there seemed only one logical answer.

there is something about rosslyn we have yet to understand.

"robert?" sophie was standing outside the car, looking back at him. "are you corning?" she was
holding the rosewood box, which captain fache had returned to them. inside, both cryptexes had
been reassembled and nested as they had been found. the papyrus verse was locked safely at its
core — minus the shattered vial of vinegar.

making their way up the long gravel path, langdon and sophie passed the famous west wall of the
chapel. casual visitors assumed this oddly protruding wall was a section of the chapel that had not
been finished. the truth, langdon recalled, was far more intriguing.

the west wall of solomon's temple.

the knights templar had designed rosslyn chapel as an exact architectural blueprint of
solomon's temple in jerusalem — complete with a west wall, a narrow rectangular sanctuary, and a
subterranean vault like the holy of holies, in which the original nine knights had first unearthed
their priceless treasure. langdon had to admit, there existed an intriguing symmetry in the idea of
the templars building a modern grail repository that echoed the grail's original hiding place.

rosslyn chapel's entrance was more modest than langdon expected. the small wooden door had



two iron hinges and a simple, oak sign.

roslin

this ancient spelling, langdon explained to sophie, derived from the rose line meridian on which
the chapel sat; or, as grail academics preferred to believe, from the "line of rose" — the ancestral
lineage of mary magdalene.

the chapel would be closing soon, and as langdon pulled open the door, a warm puff of air
escaped, as if the ancient edifice were heaving a weary sigh at the end of a long day. her entry
arches burgeoned with carved cinquefoils.

roses. the womb of the goddess.

entering with sophie, langdon felt his eyes reaching across the famous sanctuary and taking it all
in. although he had read accounts of rosslyn's arrestingly intricate stonework, seeing it in person
was an overwhelming encounter.

symbology heaven, one of langdon's colleagues had called it.

every surface in the chapel had been carved with symbols — christian cruciforms, jewish stars,
masonic seals, templar crosses, cornucopias, pyramids, astrological signs, plants, vegetables,
pentacles, and roses. the knights templar had been master stonemasons, erecting templar
churches all over europe, but rosslyn was considered their most sublime labor of love and
veneration. the master masons had left no stone uncarved. rosslyn chapel was a shrine to all
faiths... to all traditions... and, above all, to nature and the goddess.

the sanctuary was empty except for a handful of visitors listening to a young man giving the day's
last tour. he was leading them in a single-file line along a well-known route on the floor — an
invisible pathway linking six key architectural points within the sanctuary. generations of visitors
had walked these straight lines, connecting the points, and their countless footsteps had engraved
an enormous symbol on the floor.






the star of david, langdon thought. no coincidence there. also known as solomon's seal, this
hexagram had once been the secret symbol of the stargazing priests and was later adopted by the
israelite kings — david and solomon.

the docent had seen langdon and sophie enter, and although it was closing time, offered a
pleasant smile and motioned for them to feel free to look around.



langdon nodded his thanks and began to move deeper into the sanctuary. sophie, however, stood
riveted in the entryway, a puzzled look on her face.

"what is it?" langdon asked.

sophie stared out at the chapel. "i think... i've been here."

langdon was surprised. "but you said you hadn't even heard of rosslyn."

"i hadn't..." she scanned the sanctuary, looking uncertain. "my grandfather must have brought me
here when i was very young. i don't know. it feels familiar." as her eyes scanned the room, she
began nodding with more certainty. "yes." she pointed to the front of the sanctuary. "those two
pillars... i've seen them."

langdon looked at the pair of intricately sculpted columns at the far end of the sanctuary. their
white lacework carvings seemed to smolder with a ruddy glow as the last of the day's sunlight
streamed in through the west window. the pillars — positioned where the altar would normally
stand — were an oddly matched pair. the pillar on the left was carved with simple, vertical lines,
while the pillar on the right was embellished with an ornate, flowering spiral.

sophie was already moving toward them. langdon hurried after her, and as they reached the
pillars, sophie was nodding with incredulity. "yes, i'm positive i have seen these!"

"i don't doubt you've seen them," langdon said, "but it wasn't necessarily here. "

she turned. "what do you mean?"

"these two pillars are the most duplicated architectural structures in history. replicas exist all over
the world."

"replicas of rosslyn?" she looked skeptical.

"no. of the pillars. do you remember earlier that i mentioned rosslyn itself is a copy of solomon's
temple? those two pillars are exact replicas of the two pillars that stood at the head of solomon's
temple." langdon pointed to the pillar on the left. "that's called boaz — or the mason's pillar. the
other is called jachin — or the apprentice pillar." he paused. "in fact, virtually every masonic
temple in the world has two pillars like these."

langdon had already explained to her about the templars' powerful historic ties to the modern
masonic secret societies, whose primary degrees — apprentice freemason, fellowcraft freemason,
and master mason — harked back to early templar days. sophie's grandfather's final verse made
direct reference to the master masons who adorned rosslyn with their carved artistic offerings. it
also noted rosslyn's central ceiling, which was covered with carvings of stars and planets.



"i've never been in a masonic temple," sophie said, still eyeing the pillars. "i am almost positive i
saw these here. " she turned back into the chapel, as if looking for something else to jog her
memory.

the rest of the visitors were now leaving, and the young docent made his way across the chapel to
them with a pleasant smile. he was a handsome young man in his late twenties, with a scottish
brogue and strawberry blond hair. "i'm about to close up for the day. may i help you find
anything?"

how about the holy grail? langdon wanted to say.

"the code," sophie blurted, in sudden revelation. "there's a code here!"

the docent looked pleased by her enthusiasm. "yes there is, ma'am."

"it's on the ceiling," she said, turning to the right-hand wall. "somewhere over... there."

he smiled. "not your first visit to rosslyn, i see."

the code, langdon thought. he had forgotten that little bit of lore. among rosslyn's numerous
mysteries was a vaulted archway from which hundreds of stone blocks protruded, jutting down to
form a bizarre multifaceted surface. each block was carved with a symbol, seemingly at random,
creating a cipher of unfathomable proportion. some people believed the code revealed the entrance
to the vault beneath the chapel.

others believed it told the true grail legend. not that it mattered — cryptographers had been trying
for centuries to decipher its meaning. to this day the rosslyn trust offered a generous reward to
anyone who could unveil the secret meaning, but the code remained a mystery. "i'd be happy to
show..."



the docent's voice trailed off.

my first code, sophie thought, moving alone, in a trance, toward the encoded archway. having
handed the rosewood box to langdon, she could feel herself momentarily forgetting all about the
holy grail, the priory of sion, and all the mysteries of the past day. when she arrived beneath the
encoded ceiling and saw the symbols above her, the memories came flooding back. she was
recalling her first visit here, and strangely, the memories conjured an unexpected sadness.

she was a little girl... a year or so after her family's death. her grandfather had brought her to
scotland on a short vacation. they had come to see rosslyn chapel before going back to paris. it



was late evening, and the chapel was closed. but they were still inside.

"can we go home, grand-pere?" sophie begged, feeling tired.

"soon, dear, very soon." his voice was melancholy. "i have one last thing i need to do here. how
about if you wait in the car?"

"you're doing another big person thing?"

he nodded. "i'll be fast. i promise."

"can i do the archway code again? that was fun."

"i don't know. i have to step outside. you won't be frightened in here alone?"

"of course not!" she said with a huff. "it's not even dark yet!"

he smiled. "very well then. " he led her over to the elaborate archway he had shown her earlier.

sophie immediately plopped down on the stone floor, lying on her back and staring up at the
collage of puzzle pieces overhead. "i'm going to break this code before you get back!"

"it's a race then." he bent over, kissed her forehead, and walked to the nearby side door. "i'll be
right outside. i'll leave the door open. if you need me, just call." he exited into the soft evening
light.

sophie lay there on the floor, gazing up at the code. her eyes felt sleepy. after a few minutes, the
symbols got fuzzy. and then they disappeared.

when sophie awoke, the floor felt cold.

"grand-pere?"

there was no answer. standing up, she brushed herself off. the side door was still open. the
evening was getting darker. she walked outside and could see her grandfather standing on the
porch of a nearby stone house directly behind the church. her grandfather was talking quietly to a
person barely visible inside the screened door.

"grand-pere ? " she called.

her grandfather turned and waved, motioning for her to wait just a moment. then, slowly, he said
some final words to the person inside and blew a kiss toward the screened door. he came to her
with tearful eyes.



"why are you crying, grand-pere?"

he picked her up and held her close. "oh, sophie, you and i have said good-bye to a lot of people
this year. it's hard."

sophie thought of the accident, of saying good-bye to her mother and father, her grandmother and
baby brother. "were you saying goodbye to another person?"

"to a dear friend whom i love very much," he replied, his voice heavy with emotion. "and i fear i
will not see her again for a very long time."



standing with the docent, langdon had been scanning the chapel walls and feeling a rising
wariness that a dead end might be looming. sophie had wandered off to look at the code and left
langdon holding the rosewood box, which contained a grail map that now appeared to be no help
at all. although sauniere's poem clearly indicated rosslyn, langdon was not sure what to do now
that they had arrived. the poem made reference to a "blade and chalice," which langdon saw
nowhere.

the holy grail 'neath ancient roslin waits.
the blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates.



again langdon sensed there remained some facet of this mystery yet to reveal itself.

"i hate to pry," the docent said, eyeing the rosewood box in langdon's hands. "but this box... might
i ask where you got it?"

langdon gave a weary laugh. "that's an exceptionally long story."

the young man hesitated, his eyes on the box again. "it's the strangest thing — my grandmother has
a box exactly like that — a jewelry box. identical polished rosewood, same inlaid rose, even the
hinges look the same."

langdon knew the young man must be mistaken. if ever a box had been one of a kind, it was this
one — the box custom-made for the priory keystone. "the two boxes may be similar but — "

the side door closed loudly, drawing both of their gazes. sophie had exited without a word and
was now wandering down the bluff toward a fieldstone house nearby. langdon stared after her.
where is she going? she had been acting strangely ever since they entered the building. he turned
to the docent. "do you know what that house is?"



he nodded, also looking puzzled that sophie was going down there. "that's the chapel rectory. the
chapel curator lives there. she also happens to be the head of the rosslyn trust." he paused. "and
my grandmother."

"your grandmother heads the rosslyn trust?"

the young man nodded. "i live with her in the rectory and help keep up the chapel and give tours."
he shrugged. "i've lived here my whole life. my grandmother raised me in that house."

concerned for sophie, langdon moved across the chapel toward the door to call out to her. he was
only halfway there when he stopped short. something the young man said just registered.

my grandmother raised me.

langdon looked out at sophie on the bluff, then down at the rosewood box in his hand. impossible.
slowly, langdon turned back to the young man. "you said your grandmother has a box like this
one?"

"almost identical."

"where did she get it?"

"my grandfather made it for her. he died when i was a baby, but my grandmother still talks about
him. she says he was a genius with his hands. he made all kinds of things."

langdon glimpsed an unimaginable web of connections emerging. "you said your grandmother
raised you. do you mind my asking what happened to your parents?"

the young man looked surprised. "they died when i was young." he paused. "the same day as my
grandfather."

langdon's heart pounded. "in a car accident?"

the docent recoiled, a look of bewilderment in his olive-green eyes. "yes. in a car accident. my
entire family died that day. i lost my grandfather, my parents, and..." he hesitated, glancing down
at the floor. "and your sister," langdon said.



out on the bluff, the fieldstone house was exactly as sophie remembered it. night was falling now,
and the house exuded a warm and inviting aura. the smell of bread wafted through the opened
screened door, and a golden light shone in the windows. as sophie approached, she could hear the
quiet sounds of sobbing from within.



through the screened door, sophie saw an elderly woman in the hallway. her back was to the
door, but sophie could see she was crying. the woman had long, luxuriant, silver hair that
conjured an unexpected wisp of memory. feeling herself drawn closer, sophie stepped onto the
porch stairs. the woman was clutching a framed photograph of a man and touching her fingertips
to his face with loving sadness.

it was a face sophie knew well.

grand-pere.

the woman had obviously heard the sad news of his death last night.

a board squeaked beneath sophie's feet, and the woman turned slowly, her sad eyes finding
sophie's. sophie wanted to run, but she stood transfixed. the woman's fervent gaze never wavered
as she set down the photo and approached the screened door. an eternity seemed to pass as the two
women stared at one another through the thin mesh. then, like the slowly gathering swell of an
ocean wave, the woman's visage transformed from one of uncertainty... to disbelief... to hope... and
finally, to cresting joy.

throwing open the door, she came out, reaching with soft hands, cradling sophie's thunderstruck
face. "oh, dear child... look at you!"

although sophie did not recognize her, she knew who this woman was. she tried to speak but
found she could not even breathe.

"sophie," the woman sobbed, kissing her forehead.

sophie's words were a choked whisper. "but... grand-pere said you were..."

"i know." the woman placed her tender hands on sophie's shoulders and gazed at her with familiar
eyes. "your grandfather and i were forced to say so many things. we did what we thought was
right. i'm so sorry. it was for your own safety, princess."

sophie heard her final word, and immediately thought of her grandfather, who had called her
princess for so many years. the sound of his voice seemed to echo now in the ancient stones of
rosslyn, settling through the earth and reverberating in the unknown hollows below.

the woman threw her arms around sophie, the tears flowing faster. "your grandfather wanted so
badly to tell you everything. but things were difficult between you two. he tried so hard. there's
so much to explain. so very much to explain." she kissed sophie's forehead once again, then
whispered in her ear. "no more secrets, princess. it's time you learn the truth about our family."



sophie and her grandmother were seated on the porch stairs in a tearful hug when the young docent
dashed across the lawn, his eyes shining with hope and disbelief.

"sophie?"

through her tears, sophie nodded, standing. she did not know the young man's face, but as they
embraced, she could feel the power of the blood coursing through his veins... the blood she now
understood they shared.



when langdon walked across the lawn to join them, sophie could not imagine that only yesterday
she had felt so alone in the world. and now, somehow, in this foreign place, in the company of
three people she barely knew, she felt at last that she was home.



chapter 105

night had fallen over rosslyn.

robert langdon stood alone on the porch of the fieldstone house enjoying the sounds of laughter
and reunion drifting through the screened door behind him. the mug of potent brazilian coffee in
his hand had granted him a hazy reprieve from his mounting exhaustion, and yet he sensed the
reprieve would be fleeting. the fatigue in his body went to the core.

"you slipped out quietly," a voice behind him said.

he turned. sophie's grandmother emerged, her silver hair shimmering in the night. her name, for
the last twenty-eight years at least, was marie chauvel.

langdon gave a tired smile. "i thought i'd give your family some time together." through the
window, he could see sophie talking with her brother.

marie came over and stood beside him. "mr. langdon, when i first heard of jacques's murder, i
was terrified for sophie's safety. seeing her standing in my doorway tonight was the greatest relief
of my life. i cannot thank you enough."

langdon had no idea how to respond. although he had offered to give sophie and her grandmother
time to talk in private, marie had asked him to stay and listen. my husband obviously trusted you,
mr. langdon, so i do as well.



and so langdon had remained, standing beside sophie and listening in mute astonishment while
marie told the story of sophie's late parents. incredibly, both had been from merovingian
families — direct descendants of mary magdalene and jesus christ. sophie's parents and ancestors,
for protection, had changed their family names of plantard and saint-clair. their children
represented the most direct surviving royal bloodline and therefore were carefully guarded by the
priory. when sophie's parents were killed in a car accident whose cause could not be determined,
the priory feared the identity of the royal line had been discovered.

"your grandfather and i," marie had explained in a voice choked with pain, "had to make a grave
decision the instant we received the phone call. your parents' car had just been found in the river."
she dabbed at the tears in her eyes. "all six of us — including you two grandchildren — were
supposed to be traveling together in that car that very night. fortunately we changed our plans at
the last moment, and your parents were alone. hearing of the accident, jacques and i had no way to
know what had really happened... or if this was truly an accident. " marie looked at sophie. "we
knew we had to protect our grandchildren, and we did what we thought was best. jacques reported
to the police that your brother and i had been in the car... our two bodies apparently washed off in
the current. then your brother and i went underground with the priory. jacques, being a man of
prominence, did not have the luxury of disappearing. it only made sense that sophie, being the
eldest, would stay in paris to be taught and raised by jacques, close to the heart and protection of
the priory." her voice fell to a whisper. "separating the family was the hardest thing we ever had to
do. jacques and i saw each other only very infrequently, and always in the most secret of settings...
under the protection of the priory. there are certain ceremonies to which the brotherhood always
stays faithful."

langdon had sensed the story went far deeper, but he also sensed it was not for him to hear. so he
had stepped outside. now, gazing up at the spires of rosslyn, langdon could not escape the hollow
gnaw of rosslyn's unsolved mystery. is the grail really here at rosslyn? and if so, where are the
blade and chalice that sauniere mentioned in his poem?

"i'll take that," marie said, motioning to langdon's hand.

"oh, thank you." langdon held out his empty coffee cup.

she stared at him. "i was referring to your other hand, mr. langdon."

langdon looked down and realized he was holding sauniere's papyrus. he had taken it from the
cryptex once again in hopes of seeing something he had missed earlier. "of course, i'm sorry."

marie looked amused as she took the paper. "i know of a man at a bank in paris who is probably
very eager to see the return of this rosewood box. andre vernet was a dear friend of jacques, and
jacques trusted him explicitly. andre would have done anything to honor jacques's requests for the
care of this box."



including shooting me, langdon recalled, deciding not to mention that he had probably broken the
poor man's nose. thinking of paris, langdon flashed on the three senechaux who had been killed
the night before. "and the priory? what happens now?"

"the wheels are already in motion, mr. langdon. the brotherhood has endured for centuries, and it
will endure this. there are always those waiting to move up and rebuild."

all evening langdon had suspected that sophie's grandmother was closely tied to the operations of
the priory. after all, the priory had always had women members. four grand masters had been
women. the senechaux were traditionally men — the guardians — and yet women held far more
honored status within the priory and could ascend to the highest post from virtually any rank.

langdon thought of leigh teabing and westminster abbey. it seemed a lifetime ago. "was the
church pressuring your husband not to release the sangreal documents at the end of days?"

"heavens no. the end of days is a legend of paranoid minds. there is nothing in the priory
doctrine that identifies a date at which the grail should be unveiled. in fact the priory has always
maintained that the grail should never be unveiled."

"never?" langdon was stunned.

"it is the mystery and wonderment that serve our souls, not the grail itself. the beauty of the grail
lies in her ethereal nature." marie chauvel gazed up at rosslyn now. "for some, the grail is a
chalice that will bring them everlasting life. for others, it is the quest for lost documents and secret
history. and for most, i suspect the holy grail is simply a grand idea... a glorious unattainable
treasure that somehow, even in today's world of chaos, inspires us."

"but if the sangreal documents remain hidden, the story of mary magdalene will be lost forever,"
langdon said.

"will it? look around you. her story is being told in art, music, and books. more so every day. the
pendulum is swinging. we are starting to sense the dangers of our history... and of our destructive
paths. we are beginning to sense the need to restore the sacred feminine." she paused. "you
mentioned you are writing a manuscript about the symbols of the sacred feminine, are you not?"

"i am."

she smiled. "finish it, mr. langdon. sing her song. the world needs modern troubadours."

langdon fell silent, feeling the weight of her message upon him. across the open spaces, a new
moon was rising above the tree line.



turning his eyes toward rosslyn, langdon felt a boyish craving to know her secrets. don't ask, he
told himself. this is not the moment. he glanced at the papyrus in marie's hand, and then back at
rosslyn.

"ask the question, mr. langdon," marie said, looking amused. "you have earned the right."

langdon felt himself flush.

"you want to know if the grail is here at rosslyn."

"can you tell me?"

she sighed in mock exasperation. "why is it that men simply cannot let the grail rest?" she
laughed, obviously enjoying herself. "why do you think it's here?"

langdon motioned to the papyrus in her hand. "your husband's poem speaks specifically of
rosslyn, except it also mentions a blade and chalice watching over the grail. i didn't see any
symbols of the blade and chalice up there."

"the blade and chalice?" marie asked. "what exactly do they look like?"

langdon sensed she was toying with him, but he played along, quickly describing the symbols.

a look of vague recollection crossed her face. "ah, yes, of course. the blade represents all that is
masculine. i believe it is drawn like this, no?" using her index finger, she traced a shape on her
palm.



a



"yes," langdon said. marie had drawn the less common "closed" form of the blade, although
langdon had seen the symbol portrayed both ways.

"and the inverse," she said, drawing again on her palm, "is the chalice, which represents the
feminine."

v

"correct," langdon said.

"and you are saying that in all the hundreds of symbols we have here in rosslyn chapel, these two



shapes appear nowhere?"

"i didn't see them."

"and if i show them to you, will you get some sleep?"

before langdon could answer, marie chauvel had stepped off the porch and was heading toward
the chapel. langdon hurried after her. entering the ancient building, marie turned on the lights and
pointed to the center of the sanctuary floor. "there you are, mr. langdon. the blade and chalice."

langdon stared at the scuffed stone floor. it was blank. "there's nothing here...."

marie sighed and began to walk along the famous path worn into the chapel floor, the same path
langdon had seen the visitors walking earlier this evening. as his eyes adjusted to see the giant
symbol, he still felt lost. "but that's the star of dav— "

langdon stopped short, mute with amazement as it dawned on him.



«



the blade and chalice.

fused as one.

the star of david... the perfect union of male and female... solomon's seal... marking the holy of
holies, where the male and female deities — yahweh and shekinah — were thought to dwell.

langdon needed a minute to find his words. "the verse does point here to rosslyn. completely.
perfectly."

marie smiled. "apparently."

the implications chilled him. "so the holy grail is in the vault beneath us?"

she laughed. "only in spirit. one of the priory's most ancient charges was one day to return the
grail to her homeland of france where she could rest for eternity. for centuries, she was dragged
across the countryside to keep her safe. most undignified. jacques's charge when he became grand
master was to restore her honor by returning her to france and building her a resting place fit for a
queen."

"and he succeeded?"



now her face grew serious. "mr. langdon, considering what you've done for me tonight, and as
curator of the rosslyn trust, i can tell you for certain that the grail is no longer here."

langdon decided to press. "but the keystone is supposed to point to the place where the holy grail
is hidden now. why does it point to rosslyn?"

"maybe you're misreading its meaning. remember, the grail can be deceptive. as could my late
husband."

"but how much clearer could he be?" he asked. "we are standing over an underground vault
marked by the blade and chalice, underneath a ceiling of stars, surrounded by the art of master
masons. everything speaks of rosslyn."

"very well, let me see this mysterious verse." she unrolled the papyrus and read the poem aloud in
a deliberate tone.

the holy grail 'neath ancient roslin waits.

the blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates.

adorned in masters' loving art, she lies.

she rests at last beneath the starry skies.



when she finished, she was still for several seconds, until a knowing smile crossed her lips. "aah,
jacques."

langdon watched her expectantly. "you understand this?"

"as you have witnessed on the chapel floor, mr. langdon, there are many ways to see simple
things."

langdon strained to understand. everything about jacques sauniere seemed to have double
meanings, and yet langdon could see no further.

marie gave a tired yawn. "mr. langdon, i will make a confession to you. i have never officially
been privy to the present location of the grail. but, of course, i was married to a person of
enormous influence... and my women's intuition is strong." langdon started to speak but marie
continued. "i am sorry that after all your hard work, you will be leaving rosslyn without any real
answers. and yet, something tells me you will eventually find what you seek. one day it will dawn
on you." she smiled. "and when it does, i trust that you, of all people, can keep a secret."

there was a sound of someone arriving in the doorway. "both of you disappeared," sophie said,
entering.



"i was just leaving," her grandmother replied, walking over to sophie at the door. "good night,
princess." she kissed sophie's forehead. "don't keep mr. langdon out too late."

langdon and sophie watched her grandmother walk back toward the fieldstone house. when
sophie turned to him, her eyes were awash in deep emotion. "not exactly the ending i expected."

that makes two of us, he thought. langdon could see she was overwhelmed. the news she had
received tonight had changed everything in her life. "are you okay? it's a lot to take in."

she smiled quietly. "i have a family. that's where i'm going to start. who we are and where we
came from will take some time."

langdon remained silent.

"beyond tonight, will you stay with us?" sophie asked. "at least for a few days?"

langdon sighed, wanting nothing more. "you need some time here with your family, sophie. i'm
going back to paris in the morning."

she looked disappointed but seemed to know it was the right thing to do. neither of them spoke for
a long time. finally sophie reached over and, taking his hand, led him out of the chapel. they
walked to a small rise on the bluff. from here, the scottish countryside spread out before them,
suffused in a pale moonlight that sifted through the departing clouds. they stood in silence,
holding hands, both of them fighting the descending shroud of exhaustion.

the stars were just now appearing, but to the east, a single point of light glowed brighter than any
other. langdon smiled when he saw it. it was venus. the ancient goddess shining down with her
steady and patient light.

the night was growing cooler, a crisp breeze rolling up from the lowlands. after a while, langdon
looked over at sophie. her eyes were closed, her lips relaxed in a contented smile. langdon could
feel his own eyes growing heavy. reluctantly, he squeezed her hand. "sophie?"

slowly, she opened her eyes and turned to him. her face was beautiful in the moonlight. she gave
him a sleepy smile. "hi."

langdon felt an unexpected sadness to realize he would be returning to paris without her. "i may
be gone before you wake up." he paused, a knot growing in his throat. "i'm sorry, i'm not very
good at — "

sophie reached out and placed her soft hand on the side of his face. then, leaning forward, she
kissed him tenderly on the cheek. "when can i see you again?"



langdon reeled momentarily, lost in her eyes. "when?" he paused, curious if she had any idea
how much he had been wondering the same thing. "well, actually, next month i'm lecturing at a
conference in florence. i'll be there a week without much to do."

"is that an invitation?"

"we'd be living in luxury. they're giving me a room at the brunelleschi. "

sophie smiled playfully. "you presume a lot, mr. langdon."

he cringed at how it had sounded. "what i meant — "

"i would love nothing more than to meet you in florence, robert. but on one condition." her tone
turned serious. "no museums, no churches, no tombs, no art, no relics."

"in florence? for a week? there's nothing else to do."

sophie leaned forward and kissed him again, now on the lips. their bodies came together, softly at
first, and then completely. when she pulled away, her eyes were full of promise.

"right," langdon managed. "it's a date."



epilogue

robert langdon awoke with a start. he had been dreaming. the bathrobe beside his bed bore the
monogram hotel ritz paris. he saw a dim light filtering through the blinds. is it dusk or
dawn ? he wondered.

langdon's body felt warm and deeply contented. he had slept the better part of the last two days.
sitting up slowly in bed, he now realized what had awoken him... the strangest thought. for days
he had been trying to sort through a barrage of information, but now langdon found himself fixed
on something he'd not considered before.

could it be?

he remained motionless a long moment.

getting out of bed, he walked to the marble shower. stepping inside, he let the powerful jets
message his shoulders. still, the thought enthralled him.

impossible.



twenty minutes later, langdon stepped out of the hotel ritz into place vendome. night was
falling. the days of sleep had left him disoriented... and yet his mind felt oddly lucid. he had
promised himself he would stop in the hotel lobby for a cafe au lait to clear his thoughts, but
instead his legs carried him directly out the front door into the gathering paris night.

walking east on rue des petits champs, langdon felt a growing excitement. he turned south onto
rue richelieu, where the air grew sweet with the scent of blossoming jasmine from the stately
gardens of the palais royal.

he continued south until he saw what he was looking for — the famous royal arcade — a glistening
expanse of polished black marble. moving onto it, langdon scanned the surface beneath his feet.
within seconds, he found what he knew was there — several bronze medallions embedded in the
ground in a perfectly straight line. each disk was five inches in diameter and embossed with the
letters n and s.

nord. sud.

he turned due south, letting his eye trace the extended line formed by the medallions. he began
moving again, following the trail, watching the pavement as he walked. as he cut across the corner
of the comedie-francaise, another bronze medallion passed beneath his feet. yes!

the streets of paris, langdon had learned years ago, were adorned with 135 of these bronze
markers, embedded in sidewalks, courtyards, and streets, on a north-south axis across the city. he
had once followed the line from sacre-coeur, north across the seine, and finally to the ancient
paris observatory. there he discovered the significance of the sacred path it traced.

the earth's original prime meridian.

the first zero longitude of the world.

paris 's ancient rose line.

now, as langdon hurried across rue de rivoli, he could feel his destination within reach. less
than a block away.

the holy grail 'neath ancient roslin waits.



the revelations were coming now in waves. sauniere's ancient spelling of roslin... the blade and
chalice... the tomb adorned with masters' art.

is that why sauniere needed to talk with me ? had i unknowingly guessed the truth ?



he broke into a jog, feeling the rose line beneath his feet, guiding him, pulling him toward his
destination. as he entered the long tunnel of passage richelieu, the hairs on his neck began to
bristle with anticipation. he knew that at the end of this tunnel stood the most mysterious of
parisian monuments — conceived and commissioned in the 1980s by the sphinx himself, francois
mitterrand, a man rumored to move in secret circles, a man whose final legacy to paris was a place
langdon had visited only days before.

another lifetime.

with a final surge of energy, langdon burst from the passageway into the familiar courtyard and
came to a stop. breathless, he raised his eyes, slowly, disbelieving, to the glistening structure in
front of him.

the louvre pyramid.

gleaming in the darkness.

he admired it only a moment. he was more interested in what lay to his right. turning, he felt his
feet again tracing the invisible path of the ancient rose line, carrying him across the courtyard to
the carrousel du louvre — the enormous circle of grass surrounded by a perimeter of neatly
trimmed hedges — once the site of paris's primeval nature-worshipping festivals... joyous rites to
celebrate fertility and the goddess.

langdon felt as if he were crossing into another world as he stepped over the bushes to the grassy
area within. this hallowed ground was now marked by one of the city's most unusual monuments.
there in the center, plunging into the earth like a crystal chasm, gaped the giant inverted pyramid
of glass that he had seen a few nights ago when he entered the louvre's subterranean entresol.

la pyramide inversee.

tremulous, langdon walked to the edge and peered down into the louvre's sprawling underground
complex, aglow with amber light. his eye was trained not just on the massive inverted pyramid,
but on what lay directly beneath it. there, on the floor of the chamber below, stood the tiniest of
structures... a structure langdon had mentioned in his manuscript.

langdon felt himself awaken fully now to the thrill of unthinkable possibility. raising his eyes
again to the louvre, he sensed the huge wings of the museum enveloping him... hallways that
burgeoned with the world's finest art.

da vinci... botticelli...

adorned in masters' loving art, she lies.



alive with wonder, he stared once again downward through the glass at the tiny structure below.

/ must go down there!

stepping out of the circle, he hurried across the courtyard back toward the towering pyramid
entrance of the louvre. the day's last visitors were trickling out of the museum.

pushing through the revolving door, langdon descended the curved staircase into the pyramid. he
could feel the air grow cooler. when he reached the bottom, he entered the long tunnel that
stretched beneath the louvre's courtyard, back toward la pyramide inversee.

at the end of the tunnel, he emerged into a large chamber. directly before him, hanging down from
above, gleamed the inverted pyramid — a breathtaking v-shaped contour of glass.

the chalice.

langdon's eyes traced its narrowing form downward to its tip, suspended only six feet above the
floor. there, directly beneath it, stood the tiny structure.

a miniature pyramid. only three feet tall. the only structure in this colossal complex that had been
built on a small scale.

langdon's manuscript, while discussing the louvre's elaborate collection of goddess art, had made
passing note of this modest pyramid. "the miniature structure itself protrudes up through the floor
as though it were the tip of an iceberg — the apex, of an enormous, pyramidical vault, submerged
below like a hidden chamber. "

illuminated in the soft lights of the deserted entresol, the two pyramids pointed at one another, their
bodies perfectly aligned, their tips almost touching.

the chalice above. the blade below.

the blade and chalice guarding o'er her gates.

langdon heard marie chauvel's words. one day it will dawn on you.

he was standing beneath the ancient rose line, surrounded by the work of masters. what better
place for sauniere to keep watch? now at last, he sensed he understood the true meaning of the
grand master's verse. raising his eyes to heaven, he gazed upward through the glass to a glorious,
star-filled night.



she rests at last beneath the starry skies.



like the murmurs of spirits in the darkness, forgotten words echoed. the quest for the holy grail
is the quest to kneel before the bones of mary magdalene. a journey to pray at the feet of the
outcast one.

with a sudden upwelling of reverence, robert langdon fell to his knees.

for a moment, he thought he heard a woman's voice... the wisdom of the ages... whispering up
from the chasms of the earth.
