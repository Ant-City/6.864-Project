to itself. the train? pulled off on a spur in the warming grass, it was old, yes, and welded tight
with rust, but it looked like a titanic magnet that had collected to itself, from locomotive boneyards
across three continents, drive shafts, flywheels, smoke stacks, and hand-me-down
second-rate nightmares. it did not cut a black and mortuary silhouette. it asked permission but
to lie dead in autumn strewings, so much tired steam and iron gunpowder blowing away.
'jim! will!'
here came miss foley, their seventh-grade schoolteacher, along the midway, all smiles.
'boys,' she said, 'what's wrong? you look as if you lost something.'
'well,' said will, 'last night, did you hear that calliope - '
'calliope? no - '
'then why're you out here so early, miss foley?' asked jim.
'i love carnivals.' said miss foley, a little woman lost somewhere in her grey fifties, beaming
around. 'i'll buy hot dogs and you eat while i look for my fool nephew.you seen him?'
'nephew?'

through that mirror maze and - '
'no,' said will.
'no what?' asked miss foley.
'no mirror maze.' will swallowed. he stared at fathoms of reflections.you could never strike
bottom there. it was like winter standing tall, waiting to kill you with a glance. 'miss foley,' he
said at last, and wondered to hear his mouth say it, 'don't go in there.'
'why not?'
jim peered, fascinated, into will's face. 'yeah, tell us. why not?'
'people get lost,' said will, lamely.
'all the more reason. robert might be wandering, loose, and not find his way out if i don't
grab his ear - '

'swimming!' miss foley laughed. 'what a lovely mind you have, willy. well, yes, but i'm an old
fish.so…'
'miss foley!'
miss foley waved, poised, took a step, and vanished into the mirror ocean. they watched as
she settled, wandered, sank deep, deep, and was finally dissolved, grey among silver.
jim grabbed will. 'what was all that?'
'gosh, jim, it's the mirrors! they're the only things i don't like. i mean, they're the only things
like last night.'
'boy, boy, you been out in the sun,' snorted jim. 'that maze there is…' his voice trailed off.

but jim said nothing.after a long time he clapped his hand to the back of his neck. 'it really
does!' he cried in soft amaze.
'what does?'
'hair! iread it all my life. in scary stories, it stands on end! mine's doing it - now!'
'gosh, jim.so's mine!'
they stood entranced with the delicious cold bumps on their necks and the suddenly
stiffened small hairs quilled up over their scalps.
there was a flourish of light and shadow.
bumping through the mirror maze they saw two, four, a dozen miss foleys.
they didn't know which one was real, so they waved to all of them.
but none of the miss foleys saw or waved back.blind she walked.blind, she tacked her nails
to cold glass.
'miss foley!'
her eyes, flexed wide as from blasts of photographic powder, were skinned white like a
statue's. deep under the glass, she spoke.she murmured.she whimpered. now she cried. now
she shouted. now she yelled.she knocked glass with her head, her elbows, tilted drunken as a
light-blind moth,raised her hands in claw

jim and will saw their own faces, pale, their own eyes, wide, in the mirrors as they plunged.
'miss foley, here!' jim cracked his brow.
'this way!' but will found only cold glass.
a hand flew from empty space.an old woman's hand, sinking for the last time. it seized
anything to save itself. the anything was will.she pulled him under.
'will!'
'jim! jim!'
and jim held him and he held her and pulled her free of the silently rushing mirrors coming in
from the desolate seas.
they stepped into sunlight.
miss foley, one hand to her bruised cheek, bleated, muttered, then laughed quickly, then
gasped, and w

we must save her!'
'miss foley, boy, you're hurting.' will firmly removed her fists from clenching the flesh of his
arm. 'there's no one in there.'
'i saw her! please! look! save her!'
will jumped to the maze entrance and stopped. the ticket taker gave him an idle glance of
contempt. will backed away to miss foley.
'i swear, no one went in ahead or after you, ma'am. it's my fault, i joked about the water, you

doing here?’ i said. ‘why,’ i think she said, ‘i'm real.you're not!’ she laughed, way under water.
she ran off in the maze. we must find her! before - '
miss foley, will's arm around her, took a last trembling breath and grew strangely quiet.
jim was staring deep into those cold mirrors, looking for sharks that could not be seen.
'miss foley,' he said, 'what did she look like?'
miss foley's voice was pale but calm.
'the fact is…she looked like myself, many, many years ago.
'i'll go home now.' she said.
'miss foley, we'll - '
'no.stay. i'm just fine. have fun, boys.enjoy.'
and she walked slowly away, alone, down the midway.

unseen wonder: 'oh, will, oh, willy, will, oh, willy…'
'jim, you nut. i'm taking you home!'
'what? what? what?'
they were in cold air. the sky was darker than plums now, with a few clouds burning late
sun-fire above. the sun-fire flamed on jim's feverish cheeks, his open lips, his wide and terribly
rich green shining eyes.
'jim, what'd you see in there? the same as miss foley?'
'what, what?
'i'm gonna, bust your nose! come on!' he hustled, pulled, shoved, half carried this fever, this
elation, unstruggling friend.
'can't tell you, will, wouldn't believe, can't tell you, in there, oh, in there, in there…'
'shut up!' will socked his arm. 'scare heck outa me, just like she scared us.bugs! it's almost

they ran by the barber shop. will saw but did not see a sign in the window. he read but did
not read. he remembered, he forgot. he plunged on.
'hey! he's turned on culpepper street! quick!'
they rounded a corner.
'he's gone!'
the street lay long and empty in the lamplight.
leaves blew on the hopscotch-chalked sidewalks.
'will, miss foley lives on this street.'
'sure, fourth house, but - '
jim strolled, casually whistling, hands in pockets, will with him.at miss foley's house they
glanced up.
in one of the softly lit front windows, someone stood looking out.
a boy, no more and no less than twelve years old.
'will!' cried jim, softly. 'that boy - '

'nephew, heck! keep your head away. maybe he can read lips. walk slow. to the corner and

 both stopped to enjoy the swift pound of each other's heart.
'keep moving.' they moved. jim held will's arm tight, leading him. 'you did see mr cooger's
eyes huh? when he held us up fit to crack our heads together? you did see the boy, just off
the ride? he looked right up near me, hid in the tree, and boy! it was like opening the door of a
furnace! i'll never forget those eyes! and there they are now, in the window. turn around. now,
let's walk back easy and nice and slow…we got to warn miss foley what's hiding in her house,
don't we?'
'jim, look, you don't give a darn about miss foley or what's in her house!'
jim said nothing. walking arm in arm with will he just looked over at his friend and blinked
once, let the lids come down over his shiny green eyes and go up.
and again will had the feeling about jim that he had always had about an old almost
forgotten dog.some time every year that dog, good for many months, just ran on out into the
world and didn't come back for days and finally d

 returned, the dog would live in innocence again, tread patterns of grace, for months,
then vanish, and the whole thing start over. now, walking here he thought he heard jim
whimper under his breath. he could feel the bristles stiffen all over jim. he felt jim's ears
flatten, saw him sniff the new dark. jim smelled smells that no one knew, heard ticks from
clocks that told another time.even his tongue was strange now, moving along his lower, and
now his upper lip as they stopped in front of miss foley's house again.
the front window was empty.
'going to walk up and ring the bell,' said jim.
'what, meet him face to face?!'
'my aunt's eyebrows, will we got to check, don't we? shake his paw, stare him in his good
eye or some such,and if it is him - '
'we don't warn, miss foley right in front of him, do we?'
'we'll phone her later, dumb. up we go!'

jim rang the bell.
'what if he answers?' will demanded. 'boy, i'm so scared i could sprinkle dust. jim, why aren't
you scared, why?'
jim examined both of his untrembled hands. i'll be darned,' he gasped. 'you're right! i’m not!'
the door swung wide.
miss foley beamed out at them.
'jim! will! how nice.'
'miss foley,' blurted will. 'you okay?
jim glared at him. miss foley laughed.
'why shouldn't i be?'
will flushed. 'all those darn carnival mirrors - '
'nonsense, i've forgotten all about it. well, boys, are you coming in?
she held the door wide.
will shuffled a foot and stopped.
beyond miss foley, a beaded curtain hung like a dark blue thunder shower across the parlour
entry.
where the coloured rain touched the floor, a pair of dusty small shoes poked out. just
beyond the downpour the evil boy loitered.
evil? will blinked. why evil? because. 'because' was reason
 
 ___________________________
 
 enough.a boy, yes, and evil.
'robert?' miss foley turned, calling through the dark blue always-falling beads of rain.she
took will's hand and gently pulled him inside. 'come meet two of my students.'
the rain poured aside.a fresh candy-pink hand broke through, all by itself, as if testing the
weather in the hall.
good grief, thought will, he'll look me in the eye! see the merry-go-round and himself on it
moving back, back. i know it's printed on my eyeball like i been struck by lightning!
'miss foley!' said will.
now a pink face stuck out through the dim frozen necklaces of storm.
'we got to tell you a terrible thing.'
jim struck will's elbow, hard, to shut him.
now the body came out through the dark watery flow of beads. the rain shushed behind the
small boy.
miss foley leaned toward him, expectant. jim gripped his elbow, fiercely. he stammered,
flushed, then spat it out:
'mr crosetti!'
quite suddenly, clearly he saw the sign in the barber's window. the sign seen but not seen

'mr crosetti!' he repeated, and added swiftly. 'he's…dead!'
'what…the barber?'
'the barber?' echoed jim.
'see this haircut?' will turned, trembling, his hand to his head. 'he did it.and we just walked
by there and the sign was up and people told us - '
'what a shame.' miss foley was reaching out to fetch the strange boy forward: 'i'm so sorry.
boys, this is robert, my nephew from wisconsin.'
jim stuck out his hand. robert the nephew examined it, curiously. 'what are you looking at?'
he asked.
'you look familiar,' said jim.
jim! will yelled to himself.
'like an uncle of mine,' said jim, all sweet and calm.
the nephew flicked his eyes to will, who looked only at the floor, afraid the boy would see his
eyeballs whirl with the remembered carousel. crazily, he wanted to hum

yet this was only a boy standing in a hall with two other boys and a women…
and all the while jim gazed steadily, back, feathers unruffled, taking his own pictures of
robert.
'have you boys had supper?', asked miss foley. 'we're just sitting down - '
'we got to go!'
everyone looked at will as if amazed he didn't want to stick here forever.
'jim - ' he stammered. 'your mom's home alone - '
'oh, sure,' jim said,reluctantly.
'i know what.' the nephew paused for their attention. when their faces turned, mr cooger

through the toy-charm eyes, whetting the doll's mouth with a pekingese tongue. 'join us later

'dessert?'
'i'm taking aunt willa to the carnival.' the boy stroked miss foley's arm until she laughed
nervously.
'carnival?' cried will, and lowered his voice. 'miss foley, you said - '
'i said i was foolish and scared myself,' said miss foley. 'it's saturday night the best night for
tent shows and showing my nephew the sights.'

in warm flesh. he stuck out his hand.
'tomorrow, then. meet you by the side-shows.'

snapshotting two incoherent boys, and them fumbling down the steps in october dark,
while the merry-go-round started again in will's head,rushing while the leaves in the trees
above cracked and fried with wind.aside, will spluttered, 'jim, you shook hands with him! mr

he say? miss foley, that nephew's no nephew? that boy's no boy? wouldn't she laugh? she
would. for the nephew was a nephew, the boy was a boy, or seemed such.
he turned to the window. jim, across the way, stood facing the same dilemma, in his room.
both struggled. it was too early to raise the windows and stage-whisper to each other.parents
below were busy growing crystal-radio peach-fuzz in their ears, alert.
the boys threw themselves on their separate beds in their separate houses, probed

secret hissings, giggles,riots and rebel charges.

or eight notes of 'way down upon the swanee river,' he scrambled out knowing it was
moon-trail time on the creek leading to the river caves. if jim heard will out leaping about like a
scalded airedale on the timbers and the tune remotely suggested 'marching through georgia,'
it meant plums, peaches, or apples were ripe enough to get sick on out beyond town.
so this night will held his breath waiting for some tune to call him forth.
what kind of tune would jim play to represent the carnival, miss foley, mr cooger, and/or the
evil nephew?
ten-fifteen. ten-thirty.
no music.
will did not like jim sitting in his room thinking what? of the mirror maze? what had he seen
there? and, seeing, what did he plan?
will stirred,restively.
especially he did not like to think of jim with no father between him and the tent shows and
all that lay dark in the meadows.and a mother who wanted him around so very much, he just
had to get away, get out, breathe free night air, know free night waters running toward b

but the driveway was empty.
a salamander flicking the hedge, there went jim.
will was out the window, down the trellis, and over the hedge, before he thought: i’m alone. if
i lose jim, it's the first time i'll be out alone at night, too.and where am i going? wherever jim
goes.
lord, let me keep up!
jim skimmed like a dark owl after a mouse. will loped like a weaponless hunter after the owl.
they sailed their shadows over october lawns.
and when they stopped…
there was miss foley's house.

jim glanced back.
will became a bush behind a bush, a shadow among shadows, with two starlight rounds of
glass, his eyes, holding the image of jim calling up in a whisper toward the second-floor
windows.
'hey there…hey…'
good grief, thought will, he wants to be slit and stuffed with broken mirror maze glass.
'hey!' called jim, softly. 'you…!'
a shadow uprose on a dim-lit shade, above.a small shadow. the nephew had brought miss

robert kicked. two trash cans at the curb fell thundering.
a bedroom light, above, flicked on.
'police!' robert threw one last spray of glitter at their feet, shut up his fresh-peach smile like
locking an explosion away in a box, and shot away down the street.
'wait!' jim jumped. 'we won't hurt you!'
will tripped him, jim fell.
the window upstairs opened. miss foley leaned out. jim, on his knees, held a woman's wrist
watch. will blinked at a necklace in his hands.
'who's there!' she cried. 'jim? will? what's that you got?!
but jim was running. will stopped only long enough to see the window empty itself with a
wail as miss foley pulled in to see her room. when he heard her full scream, he knew she had
discovered the burglary.
running, will knew he was doing just what the nephew wanted. he should turn back, pick up
the jewels, tell miss foley what happened.

and then they heard voices from the police station. in one of the rooms to the right of the

is mad - and, god willing, won't recollect! and they won't dare bother miss foley until morning.
so, grinding their teeth way out in the meadows, they've sent the dust witch to search…

 from rainspouts, and spoke in strange
subterranean tongues beneath the windows where jim and will knew fitful dreams, slipping
out of one, trying another for size, but finding all cut from the same dark, mouldered cloth.
in the rustling drumbeat, a second thing occurred:
from the sodden carnival grounds, the carousel suddenly spasmed to life. its calliope fluted
up malodorous steams of music.
perhaps only one person in town heard and guessed that the carousel was working again.
the door to miss foley's house opened and shut; her footsteps hurried away along the
street.
then the rain fell hard as lightning did a crippled dance down the now-totally-revealed, now-
vanishing-forever land.
in jim's house, in will's house, as the rain nuzzled the breakfast windows, there was a lot of
quiet talk, some shouting, and more quiet talk again.
at nine-fifteen, jim shuffled out into the sunday weather, wearing his raincoat, cap, and
rubbers.
he stood gazing at his roof where the giant snail track was was

will's door to make it open. it did. will emerged. his father's voice followed: 'want me to come
along?' will shook his head, firmly.
the boys walked solemnly, the sky washing them toward the police station where they
would talk, to miss foley's where they would apologize again, but right now they only walked,
hands in pockets, thinking of yesterday's fearful puzzles.at last jim broke the silence:
'last night, after we washed off the roof, and i finally got to sleep, i dreamed a funeral. it
came right down main street, like a visit.'
'or…a parade?'
'that's it! a thousand people, all dressed in black coats, black hats, black shoes, and a coffin
forty feet long!'
'criminentry!'
'right! what forty feet long needs to be buried? i thoug

 lay back against the tree, her hands in her lap, trembling, very thin, very white, very
lost, very small.
'can i go now?' he said.
she nodded.
and he walked away.
at the edge of the lot, jim stomped his feet in disbelief, almost hysterical with outrage and
declamation.
‘it can't be!'
'it is,' said will. 'the eyes. that's how you tell. like it was with mr cooger and the evil boy -
there’s one way to be sure. come on!'
and he took jim through the town and they stopped at last in front of miss foley's house
and looked at the unlit windows in the morning gloom and walked up the steps and rang the
bell, once, twice, three times.
silence.
very slowly, the front door moved whining back on its hinges.
'miss foley?' jim called, softly.
somewhere off in the house, shadows of rain moved on far windowpanes.
'miss foley…?'
they stood in the hall by the bead-rain in the entry door, listening to the great attic beams
ashift and astir in the downpour.
'miss foley!' louder.

'she's gone out to shop,' said. jim.
'no.' said will. 'we know where she is.'
'miss foley, i know you're here!' shouted jim suddenly, savagely, dashing upstairs. 'come on
out, you!'

steps, they both heard the music blowing through the front door with the smell of fresh rain

jim opened the door wider and stood in the music, as one stands in the rain.

will nodded. '

en all the time. like to the
lightning-rod man, him inside-out and crazy. maybe the carnival likes accidents, gets a kick out
of them. or maybe they did something to her on purpose. maybe they wanted to know more
about us, our names, where we live, or wanted her to help them hurt us. who knows what?
maybe she got suspicious or scared. then they just gave her more than she ever wanted or
asked for.'
'i don't understand - '
but now, in the doorway, in the cold rain, there was time to think of miss foley afraid of mirror
mazes, miss foley alone not so long ago at the carnival, and maybe screaming when they did
what they finally did to her, around and around, around and around, too many years, more
years than she had ever dreamed of shucked away,rubbing her raw, leaving her naked small,
alone, and bewildered because unknown-even-to-herself, around and around, until all the
years were gone and the carousel rocked to a halt like a roulette wheel, and nothing gained
and all lost and nowhere for her

 to go, no way to tell the strangeness, and nothing to do but
weep under a tree, alone, in the autumn rain…
will thought this. jim thought it, and said:
'oh, the poor…the poor…'
'we got to help her, jim. who else would believe? if she tells anyone, ‘i'm miss foley!’ ‘get
away!’ they'd say, ‘miss foley's left town, disappeared!’ ‘go on, little girl!’ oh, jim, i bet she'd
pounded a dozen doors this morning wanting help, scared people with her screaming and
yelling, then ran off, gave up, and hid under that tree.police are probably looking for her now,
but so what? it's just a wild girl crying and they'll lock her away and she'll go crazy. that
carnival, boy, do they know how to punish so you can't hit back. they just shake you up and
change you so no one ever knows you again and let you

'fact is,' said mr dark, 'we found the names of the boys ten minutes ago. just want to
double-check.'
'so?' said will's father, disbelieving.
'jim,' said mr dark. 'will.'
jim writhed in the dark. will sank his head deep in his shoulder blades, eyes tight.
will's father's face was a pond into which the two dark stone names sank without a ripple.
'first names? jim? will? lots of jims and wills, couple hundred, town like this.'
will, crouched and squirming, thought, who told? miss foley? but she was gone, her house
empty and full of rain shadows. only one other person…
the little girl who looked like miss foley weeping under the tree? the little girl who
frightened us so bad? he wondered. in the last half hour the parade, going by, found her, and
her crying for hours, afraid, and ready to do anything, say anything, if only with music, horses
plunging, world racing, they would grow her old again, grow her around again, lift her, shut up
her crying, stop up the awful thing and

no lions for them to be tossed to, only the maze where time lost itself backward and forward in
waterfall mirrors, only the out of order carousel, the dead supper hour, mr cooger, and the
boy with the eyes that had seen all the glistery tripes of the world shaped like hung-anddripping
sins and all the sins tenterhooked and running red and verminous, this boy with the
eyes of a man who has lived forever, seen too much, might like, to die but doesn't know how…
the boys stopped for breath.
miss foley, the carnival again, the carousel run wild, the ancient cooger mummy gasping
moonlight, exhaling silver dust, dead, then resurrected in a chair where green lightning struck
his skeleton alight, all of it a storm minus rain, minus thunder, and parade, the cigar store
basement, the hiding, and at last them here, finished, done with the telling.
for a long moment, will's father sat staring blindly into the centre of the table. then, his lips
moved.

you want to go back the way you were! the carnival nods and listens.yes, they promise, if you
behave as they say, in a short while they'll give you back your twoscore and ten or whatever.
on the promise alone of being returned to normal old age, that train travels with the world, its

the carnival, giving it coke for its ovens.’
will murmured something.
‘what?’
‘mss foley,’ mourned will. ‘oh, poor miss foley, they got her now, just like you say. once she
got what she wanted it scared her, she didn't like it, oh, she was crying so hard, dad, so hard;
now i bet they promise her someday she can be fifty again if she'll mind. i wonder what they're
doing with her,right now, oh, dad, oh, jim!’

charles halloway placed forth a map of the town and drew in the location of the carnival
with a blunt pencil.
‘do we keep hiding out? no. with miss foley, and so many others involved, we just can't.
well, then, how do we attack so we won't be picked off first thing? what kind of weapons - ‘
‘silver bullets.’ cried will suddenly.
‘heck, no!’ snorted jim. ‘they're not vampires!’
‘if we were catholic, we could borrow church holy water and - ‘
