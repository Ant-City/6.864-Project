would not look at the
dog. however, he continued to watch through the
hedge for her regular coming, and thus his sentiments
towards her were deepened without any corresponding
effect being produced upon herself. oak had nothing
finished and ready to say as yet, and not being able
to frame love phrases which end where they begin;
passionate tales --
     -- full of sound and fury
   -- signifying nothing --
he said no word at all.
by making inquiries he found that the girl's name
was bathsheba everdene, and that the cow would go
dry in about seven days. he dreaded the eight day.
at last the eighth day came. the cow had ceased
to give milk for that year, and bathsheba everdene
came up the hill no more. gabriel had reached a
pitch of existence he never could have anticipated a
short time before. he liked saying `bathsheba' as a
private enjoyment instead of whistling; turned over his
taste to black hair, though he had sworn by brown ever
since he was a boy, isolated himself till the spa

mer... , well, there's no use in my waiting,
for that was all i came about: so i'll take myself off
home-along, mrs. hurst."
when gabriel had gone about two hundred yards along the
down, he heard a "hoi-hoi!" uttered behind
him, in a piping note of more treble quality than that
in which the exclamation usually embodies itself when
shouted across a field. he looked round, and saw a girl
racing after him, waving a white handkerchief.
oak stood still -- and the runner drew nearer. it was
bathsheba everdene. gabriel's colour deepened: hers
was already deep, not, as it appeared, from emotion,
but from running.
"farmer oak -- i -- " she said, pausing for want of
breath pulling up in front of him with a slanted face
and putting her hand to her side.
"i have just called to see you," said gabriel, pending
her further speech.
"yes-i know that!" she said panting like a robin,
her face red and moist from her exertions, like a peony
petal before the sun dries off the dew. "i didn't know

holes and dripping with water, the ash stem of his sheep-
crook charred six inches shorter, advansed with the
humility stern adversity had thrust upon him up to
the slight female form in the saddle. he lifted his
hat with respect, and not without gallantry: stepping
close to her hanging feet he said in a hesitating voice, --
"do you happen to want a shepherd, ma'am?"
she lifted the wool veil tied round her face, and
looked all astonishment. gabriel and his cold-hearted
darling, bathsheba everdene, were face to face.
bathsheba did not speak, and he mechanically
repeated in an abashed and sad voice, --
"do you want a shepherd, ma'am?"

bathsheba withdrew into the shade. she scarcely
knew whether most to be amused at the singularity of
the meeting, or to be concerned at its awkwardness.
there was room for a little pity, also for a very little
exultation:  the former at his position, the latter at her
own. embarrassed she w

the homestead -- a visitor -- half-confidences


by daylight, the bower of oak's new-found mistress,
bathsheba everdene, presented itself as a hoary build-
ing, of the early stage of classic renaissance as regards
its architecture, and of 'a proportion which told at a
glance that, as is so frequently the case, it had once
been the memorial hall upon a small estate around it,
now altogether effaced as a distinct property, and merged
in the vast tract of a non-resident landlord, which com-
prised several such modest demesnes.

a good boy to run and tell me, cain, and you shall
smell a large plum pudding some day as a treat. but,
before we go, cainy, bring the tarpot, and we'll mark
this lot and have done with 'em."
oak took from his illimitable pockets a marking iron,
dipped it into the pot, and imprintcd on the buttocks
of the infant sheep the initials of her he delighted to
muse on -- "b. e.." which signified to all the region
round that henceforth the lambs belonged to farmer
bathsheba everdene, and to no one else.
"now, cainy, shoulder your two, and off good
morning, mr. boldwood." the shepherd lifted the
sixteen large legs and four small bodies he had himself
brought, and vanished with them in the direction of
the lambing field hard by -- their frames being now in a
sleek and hopeful state, pleasantly contrasting with their
death's-door plight of half an hour before.
boldwood followed him a little way up the field,
hesitated, and turned back. he followed him again

 by not making the most of good spirits when they
have them as by lacking good spirits when they are
indispensable. gabriel lately, for the first time since
his prostration by misfortune, had been independent in
thought and vigorous in action to a marked extent --
conditions which, powerless without an opportunity as
an opportunity without them is barren, would have
given him a sure lift upwards when the favourable-con-
junction should have occurred. but this incurable
loitering beside bathsheba everdene stole his time
ruinously. the spring tides were going by without
floating him off, and the neap might soon come which
could not.
it was the first day of june, and the sheep-shearing
season culminated, the landscape, even to the leanest
pasture, being all health and colour. every green was
young, every pore was open, and every stalk was swollen
with racing currents of juice. god was palpably present
in the country, and the devil had gone with the world
to town. flossy catkins of the la

particulars of a twilight walk


we now see the element of folly distinctly mingling
with the many varying particulars which made up the
character of bathsheba everdene. it was almost foreign
to her intrinsic nature. introduced as lymph on the
dart of eros, it eventually permeated and coloured
her whole constitution. bathsheba, though she had too
much understanding to be entirely governed by her
womanliness, had too much womanliness to use her
understanding to the best advantage. perhaps in no
minor point does woman astonish her helpmate more
than in the strange power she possesses of believing
cajoleries that she knows to be false -- except, indeed,

"but about fanny?"
"bathsheba is a woman well to do." continued bold-
wood, in nervous anxiety, and, troy, she will make a
good wife; and, indeed, she is worth your hastening
on your marriage with her! "
"but she has a will-not to say a temper, and i shall
be a mere slave to her. i could do anything with poor
fanny robin."
"troy." said boldwood, imploringly," i'll do anything
for you, only don't desert her; pray don't desert her,
troy."
"which, poor fanny?"
"no; bathsheba everdene. love her best! love
her tenderly! how shall i get you to see how advan-
tageous it will be to you to secure her at once?"
"i don't wish to secure her in any new way."
boldwood's arm moved spasmodically towards troy's
person again. he repressed the instinct, and his form
drooped as with pain.
troy went on --
"i shall soon purchase my discharge, and then --  -- "
"but i wish you to hasten on this marriage! it will
be better for you both. you love each other, and you
must let me help y
