[CHARACTER] - 
more than half of the books in the new testament have
been attributed to [CHARACTER], the great missionary who directs
the spread of christianity after the death of jesus. in these books,
paul uses his keen mind and robust intellect to develop christianity's
first sophisticated theology. in the period immediately following
jesus's death, he is an active persecutor of jesus's followers, but
he later converts and becomes the most active proponent of christ's
disciples.
