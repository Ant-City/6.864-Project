d myself standing up straighter and with more 
confidence than i have in weeks. my smile, while 
somewhat insane, is not forced. and when president 
snow silences the audience and says, "what do you 
think about us throwing them a wedding right here in 
the capitol?" i pull off girl-almost-catatonic-with-joy
