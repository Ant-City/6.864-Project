Egeus - 
                Hermia's
father, who brings a complaint against his daughter to Theseus:
Egeus has given Demetrius permission to marry Hermia, but Hermia,
in love with Lysander, refuses to marry Demetrius. Egeus's severe insistence
that Hermia either respect his wishes or be held accountable to
Athenian law places him squarely outside the whimsical dream realm
of the forest.
