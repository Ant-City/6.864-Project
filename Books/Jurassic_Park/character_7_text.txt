"these're blackfoot tipis, built around four poles," grant said. "sioux tipis are
built around three. but this used to be blackfoot territory, so we thought . . ."
"uh-huh," morris said. "very fitting." he squinted at the desolate landscape and shook his
head. "how long you been out here?"
"about sixty cases," grant said. when morris looked surprised, he explained, "we measure
time in beer. we start in june with a hundred cases. we've gone through about sixty so far."
"sixty-three, to be exact," ellie sattler said, as they reached the trailer. grant was amused to
see morris gaping at her. ellie was wearing cut-off jeans and a workshirt tied at her midriff. she
was twenty-four and darkly tanned. her blond hair was pulled back.
"ellie keeps us going," grant said, introducing her. "she's very good at what she does."
"what does she do?" morris asked.
"paleobotany," ellie said. "and i also do the standard field preps." she opened the door and
they went inside.

the voice said.
on the video monitor, they saw the crew on the decks, casting off the lines. arnold turned back
to the main console bank. he saw the land cruisers moving through fields of steam.
"where are they now?" hammond said.
"it looks like the south fields," arnold said. the southern end of the island had more volcanic
activity than the north. "that means they should be almost to the stegos. i'm sure they'll stop and
see what harding is doing."
stegosaur
as the land cruiser came to a stop, ellie sattler stared through the plumes of steam at the
stegosaurus. it was standing quietly, not moving. a jeep with a red stripe was parked alongside it.
"i have to admit, that's a funny-looking animal," malcolm said.
the stegosaurus was twenty feet long, with a huge bulky body and vertical armor plates along
its back. the tail had dangerous-looking three-foot spikes. but the neck tapered to an absurdly
small head with a stupid gaze, like a very dumb horse.
as they watched, a man walked around from behind

nsive technology. the fact is, it can only
be supported as entertainment." hammond shrugged. "that's just the way it is."
"but if there are attempts to close down-"
"face the damn facts, henry," hammond said irritably. "this isn't america. this isn't even
costa rica. this is my island. i own it. and nothing is going to stop me from opening jurassic
park to all the children of the world." he chuckled. "or, at least, to the rich ones. and i tell you,
they'll love it."
in the back seat of the jeep, ellie sattler stared out the window. they had been driving through
rain-drenched jungle for the last twenty minutes, and had seen nothing since the apatosaurs
crossed the road.
"we're near the jungle river now," harding said, as he drove. "it's off there somewhere to our
left."
abruptly he slammed on the brakes again, the car skidded to a stop in front of a flock of small
green animals. "well, you're getting quite a show tonight," he said. "those are compys."

sattler."
"went into the park?"
"we think so. meanwhile, malcolm needshelp. i've called harding."
'shouldn't you call the doctor?"
"there's no doctor on the island. harding's the best we have." "but
surely you can call for a doctor-" she said.
"no." muldoon shook his head. "phone lines are down. we can't call out." he shifted the
package in his arm.
"what's that?" she said.
"nothing. just go to malcolm's room, and help harding, if you will." and
muldoon was gone.
she sat on her bed, shocked. ellie sattler was not a woman disposed to unnecessary panic,
and she had known grant to get out of dangerous situations before. once he'd been lost in the
badlands for four days when a cliff gave way beneath him and his truck fell a hundred feet into a
ravine. grant's right leg was broken. he had no water. but he walked back on a broken leg.
on the other hand, the kids . . .
she shook her head, pushing the thought away. the kids were probably with grant. and if
grant was out in the park, well . . . what bett

 began to spread apart, fanning out in the hallway to surround tim and lex. their heads
began to duck rhythmically.
they were going to attack. 
tim did the only thing he could do. using the card, he opened the nearest door off the hallway
and pushed lex through. as the door began to close slowly behind them, the raptors hissed and
charged.
lodge
ian malcolm drew each breath as if it might be his last. he watched the raptors with dull eyes.
harding took his blood pressure, frowned, took it again. ellie sattler was wrapped in a blanket,
shivering and cold. muldoon sat on the floor, propped against the wall. hammond was staring
upward, not speaking. they all listened to the radio.
"what happened to tim?" hammond said. "still no word?"
"i don't know."
malcolm said, "ugly, aren't they. truly ugly."
hammond shook his head. "who could have imagined it would turn out this way."
ellie said, "apparently malcolm did."
"i didn't imagine it," malcolm said. "i calculated it."
hammond sighed. "no more of this, ple

nics had forced a
smaller shift.
"no," malcolm said. "not . . . paradigm . . . beyond "beyond paradigm?" harding said.
"don't care about . . . what . . . anymore .
harding sighed. despite all efforts, malcolm was rapidly slipping into a terminal delirium. his
fever was higher, and they were almost out of his antibiotics.
"what don't you care about?"
"anything," malcolm said. "because . . . everything looks different . . . on the other side."
and he smiled.

"you're crazy," gennaro said to ellie sattler, watching as she squeezed backward into the rabbit
hole, stretching her arms forward. "you're crazy to do that!"
she smiled. "probably," she said. she reached forward with her outstretched hands, and
pushed backward against the sides of the hole. and suddenly she was gone.
the hole gaped black.
gennaro began to sweat. he turned to muldoon, who was standing by the jeep. "i'm not doing
this," he said.
"yes, you are."
"i can't do this. i can't."
"they're waiting for you," muldoon said. "you have t
