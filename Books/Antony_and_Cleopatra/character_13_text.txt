scene x. another part of the plain.

[enter canidius, marching with his land army one way; and
taurus, the lieutenant of caesar, with his army, the other way.
after their going in, is heard the noise of a sea-fight.]

[alarum. enter enobarbus.]

enobarbus.
naught, naught, all naught! i can behold no longer:
the antoniad, the egyptian admiral,
with all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
to see't mine eyes are blasted.

[enter scarus.]

scarus.
gods and goddesses,
all the whole synod of them!

enobarbus.
what's thy passion?

scarus.
the greater cantle of the world is lost
with very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
kingdoms and provinces.

enobarbus.
how appears the fight?

scarus.
on our side like the token'd pestilence,
where death is sure. yon ribaudred nag of egypt,--
whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
when vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
both as the same, or rather ours the eld

that i beheld:
mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
endure a further view.

scarus.
she once being loof'd,
the noble ruin of her magic, antony,
claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
i never saw an action of such shame;
experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
did violate so itself.

enobarbus.
alack, alack!

[enter canidius.]

canidius.
our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
and sinks most lamentably. had our general
been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
o, he has given example for our flig

enobarbus.
ay, are you thereabouts?
why, then, good night indeed.

canidius.
toward peloponnesus are they fled.

scarus.
'tis easy to't; and there i will attend
what further comes.

canidius.
to caesar will i render
my legions and my horse; six kings already
show me the way of yielding.

enobarbus.
i'll yet follow
the wounded chance of antony, though my reason
sits in the wind against me.

antony.
hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;--
it is asham'd to bear me.--friends, come hither:
i am so

i fight against thee!--no: i will go seek

agrippa.
retire, we have engag'd ourselves too far:
caesar himself has work, and our oppression
exceeds what we expected.

[alarum. enter antony, and scarus wounded.]

scarus.
o my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
had we done so at first, we had driven them home
with clouts about their heads.

antony.
thou bleed'st apace.

scarus.
i had a wound here that was like a t,
but now 'tis made an h.

antony.
they do retire.

scarus.
we'll beat'em into bench-holes: i have yet
room for six scotches more.

[enter eros.]

eros.
they are beaten, sir; and our advantage serves
for a fair victory.

scarus.
let us score their backs

'tis sport to maul a runner.

antony.
i will reward thee
once for thy sprightly comfort, and tenfold
for thy good valour. come thee on.

scarus.
i'll halt after.

[alarum. enter antony, marching; scarus and forces.]

antony.
we have beat him to his camp. run one before
and let the queen know of our gests.--to-morrow,
before the sun shall see us, we'll spill the blood
that has to-day escap'd. i thank you all;
for doughty-handed are you, and have fought
not as you serv'd the cause, but as't had been
each man's like mine; you have shown all hectors.
enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
wash the congealment from your wounds

to this great fairy i'll commend thy acts,
make her thanks bless thee. o thou day o' the world,
chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all;
through proof of harness to my heart, and there
ride on the pants triumphing.

cleopatra.
lord of lords!
o infinite virtue, com'st thou smiling from
the world's great snare uncaught?

antony.
mine nightingale,
we have beat them to their beds. what, girl! though grey

hark! the drums
do merrily wake the sleepers. let us bear him
to the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
is fully out.

come on, then;
he may recover yet.

their preparation is to-day by sea;
we please them not by land.

scarus.
for both, my lord.

antony.
i would they'd fight i' the fire or i' the air;
we'd fight there too. but this it is; our foot
upon the hills adjoining to the city
shall stay with us:--order for sea is given;
they have put forth the haven:--forward now,
where their appointment we may best discover,
and look on their endeavour.

but being charg'd, we will be still by land,
which, as i take't, we shall; for his best force
is forth to man his galleys. to the vales,
and hold our best advantage.

scarus.
swallows have built
in cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
say they know not,--they cannot tell;--look grimly,
and dare not speak their knowledge. antony
is valiant and dejected; and, by starts,
his fretted fortunes give him hope and fear
of what he has and has not.

hast sold me to this novice; and my heart

for when i am reveng'd upon my charm,
i have done all.--bid them all fly; begone.

[exit scarus.]

o sun, thy uprise shall i see no more:
fortune and antony part here; even here
do we shake hands.--all come to this!--the hearts
that spaniel'd me at heels, to whom i gave
their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
on blossoming caesar; and this pine is bark'd
that overtopp'd them all. betray'd i am:
o this false soul of egypt! this grave charm,
whose eye beck'd forth my wars and call'd them home;
whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
