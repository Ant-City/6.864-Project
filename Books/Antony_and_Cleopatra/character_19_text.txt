guard.
here is a rural fellow
that will not be denied your highness' presence:
he brings you figs.

cleopatra.
let him come in.

what poor an instrument
may do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
my resolution's plac'd, and i have nothing
of woman in me: now from head to foot
i am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
no planet is of mine.

hast thou the pretty worm of nilus there
that kills and pains not?

clown.
truly, i have him. but i would not be the party that should
desire you to touch him, for his biting is immortal; those that
do die of it do seldom or never recover.

cleopatra.
remember'st thou any that have died on't?

clown.
very many, men and women too. i heard of one of them no longer
than yesterday:

a very honest woman, but something given to lie;
as a woman should not do but in the way of honesty: how she died
of the biting of it, what pain she felt,--truly she makes a very
good report o' the worm; but he that will believe all that they
say shall never be saved by half that they do: but this is most
falliable, the worm's an odd worm.

cleopatra.
get thee hence; farewell.

clown.
i wish you all joy of the worm.

cleopatra.
farewell.

clown.
you must think this, look you, that the worm will do his kind.

cleopatra.
ay, ay; farewell.

clown.
look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the keeping of
wise people; for indeed there is no goodness in the worm.

cleopatra.
take thou no care; it shall be heeded.

clown.
very good. give it nothing, i pray you, for it is not worth the
feeding.

cleopatra.
will it eat me?

you must not think i am so simple but i know the devil himself
will not eat a woman: i

know that a woman is a dish for the gods,

well, get thee gone; farewell.

yes, forsooth. i wish you joy o' the worm.
