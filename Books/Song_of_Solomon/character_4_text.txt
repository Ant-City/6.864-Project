father are a prime example of this. did she caress his corpse, as macon dead

both and neither. when we consequently try to fit the actions of milkman
dead into a pattern, we arrive at the same ambiguous conclusions. should
all of his former trespasses be forgiven just because he learns to fly? was
he right in emotionally abusing and neglecting hagar? wrong in telling
macon about corinthiansâ€™s affair with porter? as joseph t. skerrett, jr., has
pointed out, stories of various kinds are key to the structuring of the novel,
and the presentation of everybodyâ€™s versions of events about themselves
and othersâ€”frequently contradictoryâ€”reflects the essence of the africanamerican
storytelling tradition.6

which he can take disobedience. he can dismiss his sisters as inconsequential,
dead replicas of his mother, and he can dismiss his mother as a mere shadow
of a woman. however, he may use his difference from the women, his maleness,
to direct his straying from the straight and narrow path macon sets
down to govern his actions toward pilate.
milkmanâ€™s underdeveloped moral sense also accounts in part for his
unkind treatment of hagar. his rent collecting for macon has instilled more
of a sense of power than one of responsibility toward other human beings.
hagar, just another thrilling convenience, can be dismissed with impunity
when milkman tires of her. yet it is milkmanâ€™s rather than hagarâ€™s perspective
that morrison follows through most of the relationship. she forces us
to wait and wait through it, to consider hagar expendable even if we do not
consider milkman innocent. she urges us to accept the possibility that s

he does not care that guitarâ€™s actions are psychologically warpingâ€”until he
becomes the prey in guitarâ€™s predatory hunt. before this, he neither applauds

into his lifestyle or into his limited moral vision. he is content to exist with
any ugliness in the world as long as it does not directly injure himâ€”even
when he has had a hand in creating the ugliness, as with hagar.
actions contrary to those expected in the traditional hero are apparent
in milkmanâ€™s conspiring, with guitar, to steal from pilateâ€™s house what
they believe is a bag of gold. the robbery is a violation comparable to rape.

a potentially violent scene develops in the dead house, milkman responds
to it by threatening more violence to macon in retaliation for macon slapping

the stranger, is in marked contrast to milkmanâ€™s self-centered attitude. her
actions are also a contrast to milkmanâ€™s treatment of hagar.
pilate and rebaâ€™s caring for hagar, though sometimes extreme in its
tolerance, nevertheless indicates that they are basically self-sacrificing where
family is concerned. they are both appalled when hagar maintains that there
have been days when she was hungry, because they are committed to taking
care of all of her physical needs. once they realize that she refers to a different
kind of hunger, their anxiety subsides. their treatment of hagar, which milkman

materialistic ways.
pilate also provides him with the opportunity for reevaluating his relationship

altruistic soul. here, the love of money has no meaning. middle-class dress and
fancy whatnots are just as alien as milkman is initially in danville, pennsylvania,
and shalimar, virginia. pilate, reba, and hagar have allowed the world to
pass them by, at least the world in which most people find themselves trapped.
in their voluntary retreat, however, they have managed to salvage more valuable
thingsâ€”a leisurely appreciation of life, joy in each otherâ€™s company, a love
of music, and the simple, credulous wonder in things as they are, with which
most adults have lost contact. most important, pilate has a security in, and a

palms of his hands was so delicious he couldnâ€™t imagine that the lovemaking
to follow would be anything but anticlimacticâ€ (285). it so far exceeds his
expectations that he offers to give her a bath in return, an action far removed
from anything he has done for hagar and, in its sharing, anything he has
done for any of the women in his life.
having been tested verbally, physically, emotionally, and sexually, milkman
is better prepared, more sensitized to recognize that his family history
is more important than any gold he could seek. his tests have taught him
that human beings are not to be dismissed or ill treated with impunity. as a
part of the tie that binds him to all living beings, especially people of african

milkmanâ€™s growth on his journey is measurable. he changes from a selfcentered,
middle-class bore to a man genuinely able to share in a physical
relationship as well as in societal and communal interchanges. he realizes
how wrongheaded he has been about his father and mother and how he has
used all the women in his life, especially hagar. he had put his whims and
desires before those of his sisters and had discounted their needs to be more
than the older siblings of macon deadâ€™s chosen offspring. he had judged
his mother harshly and had ignorantly tried to chastise his father. he had
violated pilateâ€™s home by stealing from her and continued that violation by
journeying hundred of miles to find gold he believed she had hidden. yet in

reflections upon hagar spur his recognition of his family in the song sung
by the children. in his remorse over hagar, he begins to feel a sense of family

ruthâ€™s primary function in the novel is to give birth to milkman, not
to establish a relationship with himâ€”certainly not beyond the long period
of nursing. she is important to his story only as long as her body serves his
needs (or as long as she can nurse him without discovery); once those needs
are served, he casts her aside emotionally, as he will later similarly discard
hagar. ruth has very little reality for milkman, and she is not drawn so that
our sympathies are overly aroused in favor of different treatment. yet here is
a woman who lives somewhat of a martyred life, or certainly a cloistered one,
for maconâ€™s rejection of her after milkmanâ€™s death essentially turns her into a
nun. she has given her all on the altar of her male offspring, whose future, set
beside hers, is judged to be significantly more worthy of consideration. not

and corinthians content themselves for most of their lives with existing in

lena and corinthians exist as shadows whose substance can be measured
only by its fading from them into their brotherâ€™s future.
of all the female sacrifices made for milkmanâ€™s growth and development,
hagarâ€™s is the most pathetic and pilateâ€™s the most tragic. milkman
essentially destroys pilateâ€™s family, for once hagar and pilate are dead, reba is
lost; unable to care for herself, she will probably be institutionalized. still, the
women make no effort to stop the destruction of their family, which begins
with hagar. their leniency and desire to give hagar whatever she wants combines
with milkmanâ€™s selfishness to ensure her downfall. while her desires

he tires of the toy, he dispassionately tosses it aside. his proclivity for white
women and for black women of his own social standing relegates hagar to a
small niche in milkmanâ€™s life; â€œshe became a quasi-secret but permanent fixtureâ€
(97â€“98). the relationship of the two families to each other also dictates
the quasi-secret status. certainly ruth would be appalled to know that milkman
is sleeping with his first cousinâ€™s daughter, and macon would be livid
not only about this son having gone into pilateâ€™s house but having become
hagarâ€™s lover. by contrast, reba and pilate simply accept life as it is. though

are his maidsâ€”convenient and exploitable. when she centers her whole life
upon milkman, placing â€œduty squarely in the middle of their relationshipâ€
(98), he tries â€œto think of a way out.â€

the pouring of kerosene on an already burning mind. his hypocrisy disguised

which he does by sending hagar a dismissal letter:
he went back to his fatherâ€™s office, got some cash out of the safe,
and wrote hagar a nice letter which ended: â€œalso, i want to thank
you. thank you for all you have meant to me. for making me happy
all these years. i am signing this letter with love, of course, but more
than that, with gratitude.â€ (99)
guaranteed to gall any self-respecting woman, the letter reeks of distance
and emotional coldness; milkman can send it to hagar only because he does
not value or respect her. in the absence of any sense of family or communal
commitment, milkman dismisses hagar as easily as

macon dead has put milkman in training to be callous, and reba and
pilate have unconsciously assured hagarâ€™s victimization:

up her life as they had. she needed what most colored girls needed:

her â€œgraveyard loveâ€ (â€œanaconda love,â€ morrison calls it) for milkman
literally becomes that. as sacrificial victim, her fate is sealed. as
victimizer, milkman has other choices. certainly macon has taught him
to value money above people, but he and guitar, who is concerned about
people, have been friends for more than twenty years by the time milkman
dismisses hagar. guitarâ€™s concern and the antimaterialistic philosophy he
has spouted off to milkman for years have at least ensured his exposure to
something other than his fatherâ€™s sentiments. while hagar has little choice
in the path she follows, milkman does not wish to make the choice that
would suggest responsibility and caring. he continues carefree and unattached,
finding and taking sexual favors wherever he pleases. his immaturity
contains an inherent viciousness antithetical to hagarâ€™s desire f

or a
more committed relationship.
hagarâ€™s sacrifice is complete when she makes milkmanâ€™s will superior
to her own. as milkman lies in guitarâ€™s apartment, unmoving as hagar
approaches with the knife, she knows at last that she can no longer evoke
any emotion from him, not even the fear that has driven her to pursue him
month after month, and certainly not the pity she deserves. yet the insensitive
milkman can only see her failure to kill him as a triumph of masculinity over
femininity, of his incredible sexual powers over the susceptible hagar. his
final words to her are striking in their utter callousness:
â€œif you keep your hands just that way,â€ he said, â€œa

right smack in your cunt. why donâ€™t you do that? then all your
problems will be over.â€ he patted her cheek and turned away
from her wide, dark, pleading, hollow eyes. (130)
it is ironic that guitar, the executioner, is more sympathetic to hagar than
milkman. when he takes the nearly comatose woman from his apartment
after her attempt on milkmanâ€™s life, he maintains that hagar has been
â€œpitiful. really pitifulâ€ and asserts that â€œit had to be something moreâ€ that
milkman has done to her, because â€œthat girlâ€™s hurtâ€”and the hurt came from 
28 trudier harris

that his friend is â€œmeddlingâ€ and â€œcriticizingâ€ him unfairly.
by the time milkman pauses in those dark woods to think about hagar,
many emotional light years and hundreds of miles away, she is already bringing
her ritual

 of death to an end. he concedes that â€œif a stranger could try to kill
him, surely hagar, who knew him and whom heâ€™d thrown away like a wad of
chewing gum after the flavor was goneâ€”she had a right to try to kill him tooâ€
(276â€“77). the accurate image of having thrown her away like chewing gum
comes too late to help hagar, but it serves its purpose in pushing milkman
toward maturity. the pattern is set in a way that milkman thrives in direct
proportion to hagarâ€™s demise. as he learns more about his relationship to her
and the rest of his family, her physical essence decreases in value. for each
stage on the journey that brings enlightenment to milkman, that enlightenment
comes directly from hagarâ€™s lifeline. when he discoversâ€”in shalimar,
virginia, sitting in front of solomonâ€™s general storeâ€”that the children are
singing about his great-grandfather, he moves into a realm of self-awareness
that makes it impossible for him to treat anyone else

 as he has treated hagar.
almost in keeping with that progression, hagar dies. another victim on his
search for self, she has helped milkman in substantial ways by being an outlet
for his negative emotions and a symbol around which he gathers his reflections.
once he truly understands and accepts that people cannot be ill treated
with impunity, then she is no longer needed. her purpose served, she dies
before milkman can return to act out any of his newfound knowledge about
how to deal with his family and with people in general.

 of her assistance, and whose
giving leads to her own death, hagar presents her body as one of the bridges
over which milkman walks into his own humanity and manhood. her physical
sacrifice is the culmination of pilateâ€™s prophetic prediction on the occasion
when ruth has come to her house to ensure that hagar would not attempt
to kill milkman again. as hagar and ruth stood arguing about their value to
milkman, pilate has said: â€œand he wouldnâ€™t give a pile of swan shit for either
one of you . . . he ainâ€™t a house, heâ€™s a man, and whatever he need, donâ€™t none
of you got itâ€ (137, 138). more specifically related to hagarâ€™s death, pilate
comments to ruth: â€œainâ€™t nothin goin to kill him but his own ignorance, and
wonâ€™t no woman ever kill him. whatâ€™s likelier is that itâ€™ll be a woman save his
lifeâ€ (140). her comment needs some

modification, for it is not a woman, but
several who save milkmanâ€™s life.28 hagar is one of them; she dies in order that
he might growâ€”and perhaps, too, because there is no realistic place for her.
even if milkman returns to the north, enlightened, with a proposal of marriage
to hagar, chances are they would not be able to execute that desire. also,
the extent of milkmanâ€™s transgressions warrants a more striking lesson than 
song of solomon 29
a mere forgiving and making up. hagarâ€™s death points out the emotionally
destructive binge milkman has been on all his life. morrison does not spare
him from having to confront the trauma resulting from that crime.
hagar, another body milkman has left in his â€œflyingâ€ pursuit of his greatgrandfather,
is like ryna or one of the twenty-one children solomon left on
his flight to africa. like ryna, the desertion leads to insanity and death. but,
also like ryna, who lives on in the tales of rynaâ€™s gulch, hagar will live on in

as an indication that he must take responsibility for â€œthe life he had takenâ€
(332). victims in the examples of their fates, both hagar and ryna enable
milkman to transcend the possibility for future victimization.29
these pathetic women and the losses do not measure up, in the final
balance, to the loss of pilateâ€™s life in milkmanâ€™s quest for identity, family, and
value beyond gold. teacher, nurturer, surrogate mother, keeper of the blues
tradition, pilate has always placed value on altruistic human relationships.
in all of these roles, she gives voice to the value of human connectedness. in

the intricate ties to african and black american history that unite all generations
of those scattered in the diaspora. in her voice is the blending of secular

 tower of selflessness should fall,
even for an enlightened milkman, is difficult to acquiesce to. yet it is consistent
with pilateâ€™s prediction about who would save milkmanâ€™s life, and it is
consistent with the traditional demise of the helper/guide once the initiate
has learned all the helper has to teach. milkman has definitely learned the
value of family and of human relationships, and he has learned that escape
from a situation does not lessen responsibility for it: he is as guilty for hagarâ€™s
death as solomon has been for rynaâ€™s insanity and for whatever happened to
his twenty-one sons. he can now effectively take his teacherâ€™s place, become
the guru rather than the seeker after knowledge held by the guru.
such a refined interpretation, however, does not alter the evaluation that
pilate joins the other women in milkmanâ€™s life in being made a victim to
his health, to his growth into a positive sense of self. milkmanâ€™s inability to

destruction wrought upon her. that he should kill pilate in his effort to shoot

the one who loves family enough to die for it.

to further complicate his involvement with the family, he and hagar

and such a utopian vision in its
totality is clearly in opposition to an urban, late capitalistic society. but morrison
does not unequivocally valorize the agrarian social mode as an obvious
alternative or answer to a dead world. it, too, has its imperfections ironically
because pilateâ€™s utopian vision of love, generosity, and a â€œconcern for
and about human relationshipsâ€ are not adequately sustaining features in a
pragmatic society conditioned for acquisition and consumption. thus, while
hagar has been showered with love and concern all her life, she has actually
become damaged by such excessive and concentrated affection in that she has
no inner strength to withstand either a capitalist society or her unrequited
relationship with milkman.

amilyâ€™s history.
we have once again come full circle in the novel. from the beginning, all
images and scenes of flight have ended either in death, disillusion, or desertion.
robert smith, driven to madness and to an â€œartificialâ€ flight, had wished 
song of solomon: reality and mythos within the community 55
to free himself from the death and distortion of the seven days. milkmanâ€™s
failed flight for gold violates the principle of responsibility to others, and is
especially destructive to hagar, who later dies alone and inconsolate. and
solomonâ€™s flight, while freeing him to return to his homeland, results in
the abandonment of family and friends. these types of absolute freedoms
through flight are problematic because they involve the denial of personal
and social bonds.
but within these negative images of flight lies a significant contradiction.
the flights of smith, milkman, and solomon are not, like icarusâ€™, the
result of hubris and the desire for an impossible kind of freedom.

personal identity and independence, for a freedom that transcends his own
blighted world. however, pilateâ€™s interposition furthers the mythic contradiction
because she rightly blames milkman for hagarâ€™s death; like solomon, he
had flown off and left a body.
in the cellar-cave, milkman begins to comprehend this contradiction,
and by doing so, he experiences a true metamorphosis and eventual reemergence
into his community. he makes the connection between his desertion
of hagar to solomonâ€™s desertion of ryna and the twenty-one children, as he
wonders to himself, â€œwho looked after those twenty children? jesus christ,

healerâ€ (150) and as a person who values humanâ€”and familyâ€”connections
above all else, pilate becomes the site in the text of redemptive folk values.
in its representation of pilate, song of solomon deliberately carries out
an antishaming agenda as it invokes but also interrogates degrading stereotypes
of the black underclass woman. yet it also insists that pilateâ€™s grand
daughter, hagarâ€”who is â€œprissyâ€ and hates â€œdirt and disorganizationâ€â€”is
â€œembarrassedâ€ by her mother and grandmother (150, 151). returning to its
concern with the issues of class and shame and the color-caste hierarchy in
the construction of african-american identities, the narrative describes how
milkman, although he is initially attracted to hagar, ultimately adopts his
familyâ€™s middle-class values, viewing hagar as someone who is not of â€œhis
own setâ€ (91). despite milkmanâ€™s prolonged

affair with hagar, people do not
consider her a â€œreal or legitimate girl friendâ€”not someone he might marry,â€
and indeed milkman treats her as an object of shame: as a â€œquasi-secret but
permanent fixture in his lifeâ€ (91, 98). the same hagar who hates dirt and
disorganization is ultimately dismissed by milkman, who â€œwouldnâ€™t give a
pile of swan shitâ€ for her (137).
when milkman sends hagar a letter ending their relationship, the â€œflatout
coldnessâ€ of the â€œthank youâ€ in his letter stuns hagar, who is sent â€œspinning

hagar sees milkman with his arms around the shoulders of a light-skinned
womanâ€”a woman with silky copper-colored hair and gray eyesâ€”she experiences

â€œlike a restless ghost, finding peace nowhere and in nothingâ€ as she ruminates
on her loss: â€œthe mouth milkman was not kissing, the feet that were not running
toward him, the eye that no longer beheld him, the hands that were not
touching himâ€ (127). then her lethargy dissipates and she feels intense rage

feeling that milkman is her â€œhome in this worldâ€ but unable to win his love,
hagar settles instead â€œfor his fear,â€ and so she begins stalking him, intent on
killing him (137, 128). because she trembles when she is in milkmanâ€™s presence,
her â€œknife thrusts and hammer swings and ice-pick jabsâ€ are â€œclumsy,â€
and thus she is an â€œinept killerâ€ (129). milkmanâ€™s contemptuous remark during

â€œyou think because he doesnâ€™t love you that you are worthless,â€ guitar
says to hagar. â€œif he throws you out, then you are garbage. . . . he canâ€™t value
you more than you value yourself â€ (305â€“06). while guitar finds hagar a
â€œ[p]retty little black-skinned womanâ€ (306), hagar, recalling the bluest eyeâ€™s
pecola, sees herself as black and ugly. viewing herself through the shaming
eyes of milkman, hagar, who is languishing in bed, determines to â€œfixâ€ herself

panties, the no color hose, the playtex garter belt and the joyce con brios,â€
and she rubs â€œmango tango on her cheeksâ€ and puts â€œjungle redâ€ on her lips
and â€œbaby clear sky lightâ€ on her eyelids. but when hagar presents herself

and disorganization, recognizes her social distance from milkman as she
perceives herself as a sad spectacle: as the dirty black underclass woman.
having internalized hegemonic beauty standards, which link skin color and
hair texture to class status and construct dark-skinned women as the racially

when the shame-haunted hagar dies, her death is as much an expression

her lovesickness.

who is weighed down by â€œshitâ€â€”that is, the vanity of false class prideâ€”is
also capable of treating others like â€œshitâ€ as he attempts to defend against the
â€œshitâ€ of inherited racial and family shame. indeed, lena accuses milkman of
â€œpeeingâ€ on his mother and sisters all of his lifeâ€”that is, treating them in a
contemptuous wayâ€”and he has similarly shown contempt for hagar, a person
he sees as worth less than â€œa pile of swan shitâ€ (214â€“15, 137). although
guitar offers milkman potentially liberating advice when he insists, â€œcanâ€™t
nobody fly with all that shit,â€ the narrative also registers uneasiness about
guitar, who comes to embody black middle-class fears about the potentially
destructive shame-rage of the violent black underclass male.

the lovers in the biblical text speaks to milkmanâ€™s relationship with hagar,
just as morrisonâ€™s meditation on american cultureâ€™s reification of color makes
the womanâ€™s assertion, â€œi am very dark, but comelyâ€ (song sol. 1.5), resonate
in a culturally fresh way. at the same time, the verse also points to the way
that skin color can signify in the african-american community. but in song

milkmanâ€™s encounter with the prostitute sweet neatly objectifies his
transformation, since her occupation would normally position her as a commodity,
her sexuality bought, not shared; she is the kind of woman men routinely
treat with no consideration. and yet milkman interacts with her in a
way that directly addresses the catalogue of shortcomings lena had pointed
out to him at the end of part i and serves almost as reparation for the thoughtless
way he had used his cousin hagar:
he soaped and rubbed her until her skin squeaked and glistened like
onyx. she put salve on his face. he washed her hair. she sprinkled
talcum on his feet. he straddled her behind and massaged her back.
she put witch hazel on his swollen neck. he made up the bed. she
gave him gumbo to eat. he washed the dishes. she washed his

of philosophical reduction. like sula, pilate figures a part of the artistâ€™s relation
to the community. both are eccentric and, though nominally a part of
their communities, are also apart from them. although one of the characters
best loved by readers of morrisonâ€™s fiction, pilate herself, while respected and
sometimes feared, is not beloved by the community. when hagar comes in
late to get her hair done, neither beautician wants to do her hair, but as marcelline
rationalizes, itâ€™s best not to turn hagar down because pilate â€œwouldnâ€™t

potions, can defeat apparently physically stronger men, and can also make
fools of the police.
in addition to her spiritual powers, she also has an expressive formâ€”the

because she maintains that one is responsible for oneâ€™s dead, milkman will
now possess a box of hagarâ€™s hair, a sign that in addition to being the heir

still standing in guitarâ€™s apartment after her failure to kill milkman. and
while milkman moves slowly away from his fatherâ€™s and guitarâ€™s teachings,
hagar loses her hold on the alternative formation represented by pilateâ€™s
house. indirectly, one might argue, hagarâ€™s death may be traced to macon
dead inasmuch as she becomes crazy as a result of loving maconâ€™s son, who
is raised to reproduce maconâ€™s middle-class values. (milkman in name is, of
course, quite literally another macon dead.) milkmanâ€™s rejection of hagar
precisely because she does not fit his middle-class design causes her to desire
to be like the women milkman desiresâ€”light-complexioned and possessing
all the totemic markers of middle-class feminine beauty. so at the very time

loses all the signs of middle-class gentility (his cutty sark, florsheim shoes,

inappropriate to label macon as the sole or final author of hagarâ€™s desire, for
he merely embodies the larger metaphysical system that informs men that
they have priority over women and that tells african americans that white is
good and black is bad.
if all he learned was that his great-grandfather reputedly could fly, then
milkmanâ€™s joy at the novelâ€™s ending would be trivial. song of solomon, morrisonâ€™s

is pilateâ€™s flying, the ability to transcend self and self-love. and surely pilateâ€™s
claim serves as an intratextual critique pointing out the inauthenticity of
guitarâ€™s claim (one echoed by porter and robert smith) that the seven daysâ€™
killing is done for love. what weighed milkman down for so much of song of
solomon is male ego (much as hagar is destroyed by her desire to be the desire
of male ego), forged in the structures of a patriarchal society.
the novelâ€™s conclusion is noteworthy for its ambiguity that has occasioned
a variety of critical response.20 does milkman actually fly? does he
live or die following his struggle with guitar? finally, i believe, it does not
matter whether milkman survives. he has achieved the very connection to an
african-american community that guitar all along has criticized his friend

18. milkmanâ€™s belief in ghosts is another sign that he has moved beyond his
fatherâ€™s middle-class values, values that derive from the white ruling class. morrison
tells a pointed story on this matter: â€œonce a woman asked me â€˜do you believe
in ghosts?â€™ i said, â€˜yes. do you believe in germs?â€™ itâ€™s part of our cultural heritageâ€
(watkins 50).
19. gerry brennerâ€™s claim that the milkman who returns to pilate â€œassigns

the word â€œitâ€ in the line â€œwhat difference did it make?â€ (336). letâ€™s look at what

been slight, as evidenced by his careless attitude toward members of his family.
for example, he breaks his long-term relationship with hagar by sending
her a terse note and some money. he steals from his aunt pilate. he has been
the recipient of a privileged childhood, without having to give much in return.

powerful communal saving force that will later rescue denver, and perhaps

some critics, though, believe that milkmanâ€™s gender makes that growth
problematic and criticize song of solomonâ€™s apparently careless treatment of
women.11 while women certainly do not fare well in morrisonâ€™s text, i would
argue that milkmanâ€™s increasing valuation of pilate and the responsibility he
comes to feel for hagarâ€™s death somewhat answer such claims. as milkman
points out, â€œyou canâ€™t do the past over,â€ and, in the end, he can offer those
he has wronged only his regret (song 76). it also seems important to note
that rather than reducing the women in this novel at milkmanâ€™s expense, the
way that morrison reworks faulknerâ€™s theme of isolation with milkmanâ€™s
sisters, first corinthians and magdalene called lena, significantly empowers
these female characters. at the end of chapter nine, milkman

the negativity associated with the women in the text. he refers to elements such as
ruthâ€™s exclusion from the text, hagarâ€™s tragic death, and sweetâ€™s function as a sexual
reward for milkman, and concludes that â€œsomething in the internal binary logic of

just as the title provides a typological frame for the novel, morrisonâ€™s
choice of biblical names for her individual characters resonates with typological
significance. on the surface, none of these characters appears to have
much in common with their types. some critics believe that the purpose of
the biblical names is simply to provide a contrasting image to highlight characteristics
that are the exact opposite of the qualities of their namesakes. certainly,
characters like ruth, hagar, first corinthians, and pilate seem to have
little in common with their biblical namesakes. however, to ignore the typological
significance of these names and the biblical narratives that these types
evoke is to lose whole layers of meaning that can enrich our reading of the
novel. to borrow from the metaphor that alter uses to describe the artistry of
the author of genesis, morrison mobilizes a biblical subtext to create â€œpostcubistâ€
portraits of her characters that juxtapose or superimpos

like david, he becomes the guardian of the ark of memory that pilate has
struggled, with her bag of bones, to preserve. davidâ€™s ark is lost in wars and
confusion but, since milkmanâ€™s flight is a flight backward to origins, the â€œarkâ€
entrusted to him by pilate will only grow in meaning and memory. ruth, like
her biblical type, becomes an unlikely mother of revival and restoration.
morrisonâ€™s hagar in some ways evokes her biblical type more explicitly
than the novelâ€™s ruth. the biblical hagar, like pilateâ€™s haunted and rejected
daughter, is used sexually and then abandoned. she is the egyptian handmaid
of abrahamâ€™s wife sarah. the barren sarah, believing that, at seventy-six, she
is too old ever to provide an heir to her eighty-six-year-old husband, gives

missing ishmael. in his letter to the galatians, paul reads this story as an
allegory. hagarâ€™s son ishmael, the son of a slave, represents the people of the
old covenant, excluded from the new christian covenant with god and thus
spiritually enslaved, while isaac, although born second, is the son of a free
woman and represents the â€œchildren of promiseâ€ who, through christ, are the
rightful heirs of the new jerusalem (gal. 4.22â€“31). hagar and her absent son
ishmael are types of the novelâ€™s hagar and the excluded african american
people of the united states.

 is a relatively minor character and just as, for people
who know the bible, ishmaelâ€™s absence haunts the song of solomon, for those
that know the koran, the missing links of hagarâ€™s story haunt the bible.
the koranâ€™s hagar is a central character and her son ishmael plays a pivotal
role, much like the one isaac plays in the bible. it is ishmael, not isaac,
who escapes sacrifice at the hand of his father through divine intervention,
and he then goes on to found the ancestral line that produces the prophet
mohammed. the matriarch hagarâ€™s triumph in the face of adversity is commemorated
every year by thousands of devote moslems who are obliged,
once in a lifetime, to complete the hajj pilgrimage, a journey that ret

hagarâ€™s wanderings in the wilderness. by robbing her hagar of ishmael,
morrison draws attention to the obliteration of most of hagarâ€™s story from
the christian bible and to the way the forces of slavery robbed the african
american people of their islamic heritage. but just as traces of this tradition
survive in solomonâ€™s song, hagar, the courageous matriarch of the koran,

one of the most intriguing biblical names in the novel is that of milkmanâ€™s
sister, first corinthians. corinthians, throughout most of the novel,
seems to be part of the â€œdeadâ€ world of her father. she is educated, but her
education does not provide her with a way forward and she seems doomed to
spend the rest of her life in the tomb of the o

human, [he] isnâ€™t complete until he realizes the impact that women have made
on his life. itâ€™s really a balance between classical male and female force that produces,
perhaps a kind of complete personâ€ (morrison, qtd. in ruas 107). on the
other hand, when milkman flies, he leaves hagarâ€™s broken body behind. his is
an individual rather than a collective liberation. morrison is acutely aware of
the contradictions implicit in her appropriation of the flight metaphor:
i used it not only in the african sense of whirling dervishes and
getting out of oneâ€™s skin, but also in the majestic sense of a man
who goes too far, whose adventures take him far away . . . black

novel the man whose name is changed to macon dead is murdered, and his
descendants transfixed in a spiritual death. names in song of solomon are
deeply implicated in issues of narrativity: this is a story about naming, and
its characters frequently bear names which denote their narrative function,
for example pilate, who acts as a guide to the protagonist milkman dead, or
sweet, the woman he wins after completing his ordeal in shalimar. certain
names allude to other stories: hagar, ruth, rebecca, and first corinthians
have obvious biblical associations in keeping with the novelâ€™s title. the midwife,
circe, a pivotal figure in the puzzles of naming and narrative around
which the novel is structured, is the only character to bear a name from
greek mythology. yet while she so obviously signifies a homeric intertext
and the patrilineal literary history that is its legacy, circe simultaneously
subverts this tradition, sending the protagonist on a journey that resembles

of the old man in the cave hardly seems justified, and his wrangle with his
sister sets the tone for his future relationships with women. pilate spends the
next night alone in the cave, and then sets out on her journeys. the process
has been her initiation,14 and she will develop into a doublet of circe, a griot
or wise woman of the african folk tradition.
pilate travels throughout the south collecting rocks and lovers along
the way, until she settles with her daughter reba and granddaughter hagar
outside the michigan town where her brother has established himself. in
contrast to his sisterâ€™s life on the margins of society, macon becomes an entrepreneur
who marries respectably and has three children: two daughters, first
corinthians and lena, and a son, milkman. spiritually annihilated by the
trauma of his fatherâ€™s murder, macon dead the second is undone by his compensating
lust for money and property. his family life is sterile and repressive,
and he continues to ignore his sister.

e seven days, and so at first does milkman, who sees the
gold as freedom from the overpowering unhappiness of his family. his quest,
however, will evolve into a search for personal and cultural identity, an identity
that individuates him from the father who bullies his wife and daughters,
neglects and repudiates his only sister, and turns an old woman and her family
out of her home. given his fatherâ€™s misogyny, milkmanâ€™s treatment of women
is hardly surprising. he callously dumps his cousin hagar, after a long-term
relationship, with a thank-you note and a gift, he interferes in his sisterâ€™s love
affair, and he robs his aunt. milkmanâ€™s quest for knowledge and identity, then,
is a gradual movement toward a more decent relationship with women, and a
value system more in line with that of pilate rather than his father. the figure
at the threshold of his development is the uncanny circe.
circe is first named by macon when he starts to recount his history to
milkman. the narration is in

baggage: â€œthese women walked as if they were going somewhere, but they
carried nothing in their handsâ€ (259). yet the chapter which begins with a
description of women quickly turns to the archetypal myth in which a youth
proves his masculinity by hunting with the men. while this tale is completed
within the compass of chapter 11, the remainder of the novel contests this
apparently heroic resolution. the mythic subtext is interleaved with the narratives
of hagar and guitar. as milkman is putting the pieces of his story
together, the jilted hagar dies of a broken heart. unlike him she has not successfully
completed her coming of age.26 instead she corresponds to ryna,
the woman whom milkmanâ€™s great-grandfather left behind when he flew
away, and whose story offered by susan byrd serves to devalue solomonâ€™s
flight. it is during his visit with susan that milkman finally loses his watch;
