i have told it!  ah, be kind to me, be merciful to a poor boy who
means thee well; for an thou betray me i am lost!”

i laughed the only really refreshing laugh i had had for some time;
and shouted:

“merlin has wrought a spell!  _merlin_, forsooth!  that cheap old
humbug, that maundering old ass?  bosh, pure bosh, the silliest bosh
in the world!  why, it does seem to me that of all the childish,
idiotic, chuckle-headed, chicken-livered superstitions that ev
--oh, damn merlin!”

but clarence had slumped to his knees before i had half finished,
and he was like to go out of his mind with fright.

“oh, beware!  these are awful words!  any moment these walls
may crumble upon us if you say such things.  oh call them back
before it is too late!”

now this strange exhibition gave me a good idea and set me to
thinking.  if everybody about here was so honestly and sincerely
afraid of merlin’s pretended magic as clarence was, certainly
a superior man like me ought to be shrewd enough to

you see, it was the eclipse.  it came into my mind in the nick
of time, how columbus, or cortez, or one of those people, played
an eclipse as a saving trump once, on some savages, and i saw my
chance.  i could play it myself, now, and it wouldn’t be any
plagiarism, either, because i should get it in nearly a thousand
years ahead of those parties.

clarence came in, subdued, distressed, and said:

“i hasted the message to our liege the king, and straightway he
had me to his presence.  he was frighted even to the marrow,
and was minded to give order for your instant enlargement, and
that you be clothed in fine raiment and lodged as befitted one so
great; but then came merlin and spoiled all; for he persuaded
the king that you are mad, and know not whereof you speak; and
said your threat is but foolishness and idle vaporing.  they

 king, by his silence, still stands to the terms.”  then
i lifted up my hands--stood just so a moment--then i said, with
the most awful solemnity: “let the enchantment dissolve and
pass harmless away!”

there was no response, for a moment, in that deep darkness and
that graveyard hush.  but when the silver rim of the sun pushed
itself out, a moment or two later, the assemblage broke loose with
a vast shout and came pouring down like a deluge to smother me
with blessings and gratitude; and clarence was not the last of
the wash, to be sure.

merlin’s tower

inasmuch as i was now the second personage in the kingdom, as far
as political power and authority were concerned, much was made
of me.  my raiment was of silks and velvets and cloth of gold,
and by consequence was very showy, also uncomfortable.  but habit
would soon reconcile me to my clothes; i was aware of that.  i was
given the choicest suite of apartments in the castle, after
the king’s.  they were aglow with lou

but it was too far away.  two years.  i would have given a good
deal for license to hurry it up and use it now when there was
a big market for it.  it seemed a great pity to have it wasted so,
and come lagging along at a time when a body wouldn’t have any
use for it, as like as not.  if it had been booked for only a month
away, i could have sold it short; but, as matters stood, i couldn’t
seem to cipher out any way to make it do me any good, so i gave up
trying.  next, clarence found that old merlin was making himself
busy on the sly among those people.  he was spreading a report that
i was a humbug, and that the reason i didn’t accommodate the people
with a miracle was because i couldn’t.  i saw that i must do
something.  i presently thought out a plan.

by my authority as executive i threw merlin into prison--the same
cell i had occupied myself.  then i gave public notice by herald
and trumpet that i should be busy with affairs of state for
a fortnight, but about

 the end of that time i would take a moment’s
leisure and blow up merlin’s stone tower by fires from heaven;
in the meantime, whoso listened to evil reports about me, let him
beware.  furthermore, i would perform but this one miracle at
this time, and no more; if it failed to satisfy and any murmured,
i would turn the murmurers into horses, and make them useful.
quiet ensued.

i took clarence into my confidence, to a certain degree, and we
went to work privately.  i told him that this was a sort of miracle
that required a trifle of preparation, and that it would be sudden
death to ever talk about these preparations to anybody.  that made
his mouth safe enough.  clandestinely we made a few bushels of
first-rate blasting powder, and i superintended my armorers while
they constructed a lightning-rod and some wires.  this old stone
tower was very massive--and rather ruinous, too, for it

thunder-showers had been tolerably frequent of late, and i was
not much afraid of a failure; still, i shouldn’t have cared for
a delay of a day or two; i should have explained that i was busy
with affairs of state yet, and the people must wait.

of course, we had a blazing sunny day--almost the first one without
a cloud for three weeks; things always happen so.  i kept secluded,
and watched the weather.  clarence dropped in from time to time
and said the public excitement was growing and growing all the
time, and the whole country filling up with human masses as far
as one could see from the battlements.  at last the wind sprang up
and a cloud appeared--in the right quarter, too, and just at
nightfall.  for a little while i watched that distant cloud spread
and blacken, then i judged it was time for me to appear.  i ordered
the torch-baskets to be lit, and merlin liberated and sent to me.

i had scattered some branch schools secretly about the kingdom,
and they were doing very well.  i meant to work this racket more
and more, as time wore on, if nothing occurred to frighten me.
one of my deepest secrets was my west point--my military academy.
i kept that most jealously out of sight; and i did the same with my
naval academy which i had established at a remote seaport.  both
were prospering to my satisfaction.

clarence was twenty-two now, and was my head executive, my right
hand.  he was a darling; he was equal to anything; there wasn’t
anything he couldn’t turn his hand to.  of late i had been training
him for journalism, for the time seemed about right for a start
in the newspaper line; nothing big, but just a small weekly for
experimental circulation in my civilization-nurseries.  he took
to it like a duck; there was an editor concealed in him, sure.
already he had doubled himself in one way; he talked

in raptures over this preposterous opportunity for adventure.
every knight of the table jumped for the chance, and begged for it;

who had not asked for it at all.

but he--he could not contain his.  his mouth gushed delight and
gratitude in a steady discharge--delight in my good fortune,
gratitude to the king for this splendid mark of his favor for me.
he could keep neither his legs nor his body still, but pirouetted
about the place in an airy ecstasy of happiness.

on my side, i could have cursed the kindness that conferred upon
me this benefaction, but i kept my vexation under the surface
for policy’s sake, and did what i could to

whole party.  and think of the simple ways of this court: this
wandering wench hadn’t any more trouble to get access to the king
in his palace than she would have had to get into the poorhouse
in my day and country.  in fact, he was glad to see her, glad
to hear her tale; with that adventure of hers to offer, she was
as welcome as a corpse is to a coroner.

just as i was ending-up these reflections, clarence came back.
i remarked upon the barren result of my efforts with the girl;
hadn’t got hold of a single point that could help me to find
the castle.  the youth looked a little surprised, or puzzled,
or something, and intimated that he had been wondering to himself
what i had wanted to ask the girl all those questions for.

“why, great guns,” i said, “don’t i want to find the castle?  and
how else would i go about it?”

so i did not talk blood and insurrection to that man there who sat
munching black bread with that abused and mistaught herd of human
sheep, but took him aside and talked matter of another sort to him.
after i had finished, i got him to lend me a little ink from his
veins; and with this and a sliver i wrote on a piece of bark--

and gave it to him, and said:

“take it to the palace at camelot and give it into the hands of
amyas le poulet, whom i call clarence, and he will understand.”

“he is a priest, then,” said the man, and some of the enthusiasm
went out of his face.

“how--a priest?  didn’t i tell you that no chattel of the church,
no bond-slave of pope or bishop can enter my man-factory?  didn’t
i tell you that _you_ couldn’t enter unless your religion, whatever
it might be, was your own free property?”

“marry, it is so, and for that i was glad; wherefore it liked me not,

“i?  i would give blood out of my heart to know that art.  why,

“no you won’t, you won’t be anybody’s slave.  take your family
and go along.  your lord the bishop will confiscate your small
property, but no matter.  clarence will fix you all right.”

i paid three pennies for my breakfast, and a most extravagant
price it was, too, seeing that one could have breakfasted a dozen
persons for that money; but i was feeling good by this time, and
i had always been a kind of spendthrift anyway; and then these
people had wanted to give me the food for nothing, scant as
their provision was, and so it was a grateful pleasure to emphasize
my appreciation and sincere thankfulness with a

divergence from similarity of sense.  but no matter, you know
the name of the place now.  call up camelot.”

he did it, and had clarence sent for.  it was good to hear my boy’s
voice again.  it was like being home.  after some affectionate
interchanges, and some account of my late illness, i said:

“what is new?”

“the king and queen and many of the court do start even in this
hour, to go to your valley to pay pious homage to the waters ye
have restored, and cleanse themselves of sin, and see the place

barrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a man
being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.  it was
the sight of a newsboy--and i couldn’t get at him!  still, i had
one comfort--here was proof that clarence was still alive and

full of cheer.

he did so.  we waited five nerve-straining minutes--ten minutes
--how long it did seem!--and then came a click that was as familiar
to me as a human voice; for clarence had been my own pupil.

“now, my lad, vacate!  they would have known _my_ touch, maybe,
and so your call was surest; but i’m all right now.”

position and progress by hearing, not sight.  a chorus of encouraging
shouts burst out for him, and one brave voice flung out a heartening
word for me--said:

it was an even bet that clarence had procured that favor for me
--and furnished the language, too.  when that formidable lance-point
was within a yard and a half of my breast i twitched my horse aside
without an effort, and the big knight swept by, scoring a blank.
i got plenty of applause that time.  we turned, braced up, and
down we came again.  another blank for the knight, a roar of
applause for me.  this same thing was repeated once more; and
it fetched such a whirlwind of applause that sir sagramor lost his

as well confess, though i do feel ashamed when i think of it:
i was beginning to have a base hankering to be its first president
myself.  yes, there was more or less human nature in me; i found
that out.

clarence was with me as concerned the revolution, but in a modified
way.  his idea was a republic, without privileged orders, but with
a hereditary royal family at the head of it instead of an elective
chief magistrate.  he believed that no nation that had ever known
the joy of worshiping a royal family could ever be robbed of it
and not fade away and die of melancholy.  i urged that kings were
dangerous.  he said, then have cats.  he was sure that a royal
family of cats would answer every purpose.  they

just like that.  i found no life stirring in the somber streets.
i groped my way with a heavy heart.  the vast castle loomed black
upon the hilltop, not a spark visible about it.  the drawbridge
was down, the great gate stood wide, i entered without challenge,
my own heels making the only sound i heard--and it was sepulchral
enough, in those huge vacant courts.

i found clarence alone in his quarters, drowned in melancholy;
and in place of the electric light, he had reinstituted the ancient
rag-lamp, and sat there in a grisly twilight with all curtains
drawn tight.  he sprang up and rushed for me eagerly, saying:

“oh, it’s worth a billion milrays to look upon a live person again!”

he knew me as easily as if i hadn’t been disguised at all.  which
frightened me; one may easily believe that.

“quick, now, tell me the meaning of this fearful disaster,” i said.

well-educated, clean-minded young british boys.  at dawn i sent
an order to the factories and to all our great works to stop
operations and remove all life to a safe distance, as everything
was going to be blown up by secret mines, “_and no telling at what
moment--therefore, vacate at once_.”  these people knew me, and
had confidence in my word.  they would clear out without waiting
to part their hair, and i could take my own time about dating the

i was ready for the enemy now.  let the approaching big day come
along--it would find us on deck.

the big day arrived on time.  at dawn the sentry on watch in the
corral came into the cave and reported a moving black mass under
the horizon, and a faint sound which he thought to be military
music.  breakfast was just ready; we sat down and ate it.

this over, i made the boys a little speech, and then sent out
a detail to man the battery, with clarence in command of it.

the sun rose presently and sent its unobstructed splendors over
the land, and we saw a prodigious host moving slowly toward us,
with the steady drift and aligned front of a wave of the sea.
nearer and nearer it came, and more and more sublimely imposing
became its aspect; yes, all england was there, apparently.  soon
we could see the innumerable banners fluttering, and then the sun
struck the sea of armor and set it all aflash.  yes, it was a fine
sight; i hadn’t ever seen a

ce.  he laughed the sarcastic laugh he was born with, and said:

“somehow it seems impossible for you to ever fully realize what
these nobilities are.  now let us save a little time and trouble.
consider me the commander of the knights yonder.  now, then,
you are the flag of truce; approach and deliver me your message,
and i will give you your answer.”

i humored the idea.  i came forward under an imaginary guard of
the enemy’s soldiers, produced my paper, and read it through.
for answer, clarence struck the paper out of my hand, pursed up
a scornful lip and said with lofty disdain:

“dismember me this animal, and return him in a basket to the
base-born knave who sent him; other answer have i none!”

how empty is theory in presence of fact!  and this was just fact,
and nothing else.  it was the thing that would have happened,
there was no getting around that.  i tore up the paper and granted
my mistimed sentimentalities a permanent rest.

then, to business.  i tested the electric sign

read all along, and it unmistakably furnished me this
fact: an armed host was taking up its quarters in the ditch.  yes,
these people were arranging a little surprise party for us.  we
could expect entertainment about dawn, possibly earlier.

i groped my way back to the corral now; i had seen enough.  i went
to the platform and signaled to turn the current on to the two
inner fences.  then i went into the cave, and found everything
satisfactory there--nobody awake but the working-watch.  i woke
clarence and told him the great ditch was filling up with men,
and that i believed all the knights were coming for us in a body.
it was my notion that as soon as dawn approached we could expect
the ditch’s ambuscaded thousands to swarm up over the embankment
and make an assault, and be followed immediately by the rest
of their army.

clarence said:

“they will be wanting to send a scout or two in the dark to make
preliminary observations.  why not take the lightning off the
outer fences, and give the

“no, you are a good heart.  i want to go and--”

“be a reception committee?  i will go, too.”

we crossed the corral and lay down together between the two inside
fences.  even the dim light of the cave had disordered our eyesight
somewhat, but the focus straightway began to regulate itself and
soon it was adjusted for present circumstances.  we had had to feel
our way before, but we could make out to see the fence posts now.
we started a whispered conversation, but suddenly clarence broke
off and said:

“what is that?”

“what is what?”

“that thing yonder.”

“what thing--where?”

“there beyond you a little piece--dark something--a dull shape
of some kind--against the second fence.”

i gazed and he gazed.  i said:

“could it be a man, clarence?”

“no, i think not.  if you notice, it looks a lit--why, it _is_
a man!--leaning on the fence.”

“i certainly believe it is; let us go and see.”

we crept along on our hands and knees until we were pret

dead men were lying outside the second fence--not plainly visible,
but still visible; and we counted fifteen of those pathetic
statues--dead knights standing with their hands on the upper wire.

one thing seemed to be sufficiently demonstrated: our current
was so tremendous that it killed before the victim could cry out.
pretty soon we detected a muffled and heavy sound, and next moment
we guessed what it was.  it was a surprise in force coming! i whispered
clarence to go and wake the army, and notify it to wait in silence
in the cave for further orders.  he was soon back, and we stood
by the inner fence and watched the silent lightning do its awful
work upon that swarming host.  one could make out but little of
detail; but he could note that a black mass was piling itself up
beyond the second fence.  that swelling bulk was dead men!  our
camp was enclosed with a solid wall of the dead--a bulwark,
a breastwork, of corpses, you may say.  one terrible thing a

such strange and awful dreams, sandy!  dreams that were as real
as reality--delirium, of course, but _so_ real!  why, i thought

of these dreams, i thought that clarence and i and a handful of
my cadets fought and exterminated the whole chivalry of england!
but even that was not the strangest.  i seemed to be a creature
out of a remote unborn age, centuries hence, and even _that_ was
as real as the rest!  yes, i seemed to have flown back out of that
age into this of ours, and then forward to it again, and was set
down, a stranger and forlorn in that strange england, with an
abyss of thirteen centuries yawning between me and you! between
me and my home and my fri
