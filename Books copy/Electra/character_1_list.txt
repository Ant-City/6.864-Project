Orestes - 
      Orestes is the son of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon, and therefore, he is the rightful king of Argos. Saved as a young child by Electra and smuggled away to Phocia after Agamemnon's murder, he has now returned to Mycenae to avenge his father's death, as instructed by the oracle of Apollo. He is advised and accompanied by his tutor and keeper, the Old Man, and his silent friend, Pylades. Still a youth, Orestes is somewhat naive and inexperienced. He acts because he has been so instructed by Apollo's oracle, and not as motivated by intense or deep emotion.
