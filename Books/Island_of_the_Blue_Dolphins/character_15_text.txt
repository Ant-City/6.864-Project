at he brought good news.
'speak!' everyone said in a chorus.
'i have been running for more than a league,' he said. ‘i cannot talk.'
'you are talking,' someone said.
'speak, nanko, speak,' cried many voices.
nanko was having fun with us. he threw out his chest and took a deep breath. he looked around at the circle of faces as if he 
did not understand why everyone was staring at him.
'the ship,' he said at last, saying the words slowly, ‘does not belong to our enemies, the aleuts. there are white men on this
ship and they have come from that place where kimki went when he left our island.'
'has kimki returned?' an old man broke in.
'no, but it is he who saw the white men and told them to come here.'
'what do they look like !' ulape asked.
'are there boys on the ship?' asked ramo, who had come back with his mouth full of something.
everyone seemed to be talking at once.
nanko made his face stern, which was hard for him to do because his mouth had been cut in the battle with the aleuts and

er since it had always seemed to smile. he held up his hand for silence. 'the ship has come for one reason,' he said. 'to
take us away from ghalas-at.'
'to what place?’ i asked.
it was good news that the ship did not belong to the aleuts. but where would the white men take us !
'i do not know to what place,' he said. 'kimki knows and he has asked the white men to take us there.'
saying no more, nanko turned back and we followed him. we were fearful of where we were going, yet we were happy, too.

we took nothing with us when we thought we would have to see, so there was much excitement as we packed our baskets.
nanko strode up and down outside the houses, urging us to hurry.
'the wind grows strong,' he shouted. ‘the ship will leave you.'
i filled two baskets with the things i wished to take. three fine needles of whalebone, an awl for making holes

 with one of
our baskets, but before long he ran hack to say that he had forgotten his fishing spear. nanko was standing on the cliff
motioning us to hurry, so i refused to let him go back for it.
the ship was anchored outside the cove and nanko said that it could not come closer to the shore because of the high waves.
they were beating against the rocks with the sound of thunder. the shore as far as i could see was rimmed with foam.
two boats were pulled up on the beach. beside them stood four white men and as we came down the trail, one of the men
beckoned us to walk faster. he spoke to us in a language which we could not understand.
the men of our tribe, except nanko and chief matasaip, were already on the ship. my brother ramo was there too, nanko
said. he had run on ahead after i had told him that he could not go back to the village for his spear. nanko said that he had
jumped into the first boat that left the cove. 
matasaip divided the women into two groups. then the boats were pushed in

to the water, and while they bobbed about we
scrambled into them as best we could.
the cove was partly sheltered from the wind, but as soon as we went through the passage between the rocks and into the sea,
great waves struck us. there was much confusion. spray hew, the white men shouted at each other. the boat pitched so
wildly that in one breath you could see the ship and in the next breath it had gone. yet we came to it at last and somehow
were able to climb on to the deck.
the ship was large, many times the size of our biggest canoes. it had two tall masts and between them stood a young man
with blue eyes and a black beard. he was the chieftain of the white men, for he began to shout orders which they quickly
obeyed. sails rose on the tall masts and two of the men b

 calling his name. still there was no answer. no one had seen him.
at last i found nanko.
i was overcome with fear. ‘where is my brother?' i cried.
he repeated what he had told me on the beach, but as he spoke ulape who stood beside him pointed towards the island. i
looked out across the deck and the sea. there, running along the cliff, the fishing spear held over his head, was ramo.
the sails had filled and the ship was now moving slowly away. everyone was looking towards the cliff, even the white men. i
ran to one of them and pointed, but he shook his head and turned from me. the ship began to move faster. against my will, i
screamed.
chief matasaip grasped my arm.
'we cannot wait for ramo,' he said. 'if we' do, the ship will be driven on the rocks.'
'we must!' i shouted. 'we must!'
'the ship will come back for him on another day, matasaip said. 'he will be safe. there is food for him to eat and water to 
drink and places to sleep.
'no,' i cried.
matasaip's face was like stone. he was not l

ns were already hunting, soaring high over the
clear water, diving straight down, if they sighted a fish, to strike the sea with a great splash that i could hear.
i also watched the otter hunting in the kelp. these shy little animals had come back soon after the aleuts had left and now
there seemed to be as many of them as before. the early morning sun shone like gold on their glossy pelts.
yet as i lay there on the high rock, looking at the stars, i thought about the ship which belonged to the white men. and at
dawn, as light spread across the sea, my first glance was towards the little harbour of coral cove. every morning i would
look for the ship there, thinking that it might have come in the night. and each morning i would see nothing except the birds
flying over the sea.
when there were people in ghalas-at i was always up before the sun and busy with many things. but now that there was little
to do i did not leave the rock until the sun was high. i would eat and then go to the spring and t

sometimes out of the south.
it was during these days that the ship might return and now i spent most of my time on the rock, looking out from the high
headland into the east, towards the country where my people had gone, across the sea that was never-ending.
once while i watched i saw a small object which i took to be the ship, but a stream of water rose from it and i knew that it
was a whale spouting. during those summer days i saw nothing else.
the first storm of winter ended my hopes. if the white men's ship were coming for me it would have come during the time of
good weather. now i would have to wait until winter was gone, maybe longer.
the thought of being alone on the island while so many suns rose from the sea and went slowly back into the sea filled my
heart with loneliness. i had not felt so lonely before because i was sure that the ship would return as matasaip had said it
would. now my hopes were dead. now i was really alone. i could not eat much, nor could i sleep without dreaming

ar to live here another day.
i looked out at the blue water stretching away and all the fear i had felt during the time of the voyage came back to me. on 
the morning i first sighted the island and it had seemed like a great fish sunning itself, i thought that someday i would make
the canoe over and go out once more to look for the country that lay beyond the ocean. now i knew that i would never go
again.
the island of the blue dolphins was my home; i had no other. it would be my home until the white men returned in their
ship. but even if they came soon, before next summer, i could not live without a roof or a place to store my food. 1 would
have to build a house. but where ?
that night i slept on the rock and the next day i began the search. the morning was clear, but to the north banks of clouds
hung low. before long they would move in across the island and behind them many other storms were waiting. i had no time
to waste.
i needed a place that was sheltered from the wind, not too far from

 now as i crawled under the fence i did not feel
the same.
i called out, 'dog, dog,' for i had no other name for him.
i ran towards the house, calling it. he was inside. he was just getting to his feet, stretching himself and yawning. he looked
first at the fish i carried and then at me and moved his tail. that night i stayed in the house. before i fell asleep i thought of a
name for him, for i could not call him dog. the name i thought of was rontu, which means in our language fox eyes.

the white men's ship did not return that spring or in the summer. but every day, whether i was on the headland or gathering
shellfish on the rocks or working on my canoe, i watched for it. i also watched for the red ship of the aleuts.
i was not sure what i would do if the aleuts came. i could hide in the cave which i had stored with food and water, for it was
surrounded by thick brush and the mouth of the ravine could only be reached from the sea. the aleuts had not used the spring 
and did not know about i

y hair. after the aleuts had killed our men at coral cove, all the women of our tribe had singed their hair
short as a sign of mourning. i had singed mine, too, with a faggot, but now it had grown long again and came to my waist. i
parted it and let it fall down my back, except when i wore a wreath. then i made braids and fastened them with long whalebone
pins.
i also made a wreath for rontu's neck, which he did not like. together we would walk along the cliff looking at the sea, and
though the white men's ship did not return that spring, it was a happy time. the air smelled of flowers and birds sang
everywhere.

another summer had come and still i had not speared the giant devilfish that lived near the cave.
every day during the spring, rontu and i went to look for him. i would put the canoe in the water and paddle slowly through
the cave, from one opening to the other, often several times. i saw many devilfish there where the black water is streaked with
light, but not the giant one.

e and climbed the cliff with the ten cormorant skins slung over my back. at the top of the cliff i stood
for a while gazing at the sea. there were some small clouds on the water. one of them, the smallest, did not look like the
others, and as i watched, i saw that it was a ship.
the sun made bright scales on the water, but i could see clearly. there were two sails and it was a ship coming towards the
island. for a long time i could not tell the colour of the sails. i wondered if it could be the white men, though now i thought
about them little and seldom looked for them.
i left the cormorants hanging on the fence and went to the rock on the headland. i could see no better from the rock because
the sun was low and the whole ocean was covered with light. then as i stood there i remembered that the white men's ship
would come from the east. this one had come from a different direction - from the north.
i still was not sure that it belonged to the aleuts, but i decided to pack the things that i wou

nd by now were aware that summer was a time of danger would lead the herd away. they went far off to the kelp
beds of tall rock where they stayed until the first storms of winter.
often rontu and i would go out to the rock and live there for several days catching fish for won-a- me and the others i had
come to know.
one summer the otter did not leave, the summer that rontu died, and i knew then that none of the otter who remembered the
hunters were left. nor did i think of them often nor of the white men who had said they would come back, but did not come.
until that summer, i had kept count of all the moons since the time my brother and i were alone upon the island. for each one
that came and went i cut a mark in a pole beside the door of my house. 'there were many marks, from the roof to the floor.
but after that summer i did not cut them any more. the passing of the moons now had come to mean little, and i only made
marks to count the four seasons of the year. the last year i did not count t

of grey clouds, one on top of the other.
at this moment, in the deep shadows cast by the clouds, i saw something else. forgetting that i was carrying a load of
seaweed, i threw up my arms. the seaweed fell to the ground.
a sail, a ship, was there on the sea, half-way between the horizon and the shore!
by the time i had reached the headland it was much closer, moving quickly on the strong wind. i could see that it did not have
the red, beaked prow of the aleuts. nor did it look like the white men's ship, which i clearly remembered.
why had it come to the island of the blue dolphins?
i crouched on the headland and wondered, my heart beating fast, if the men who sailed it had come to catch otter. if they were
hunters, i must hide be- fore they saw me. they would soon find my fire and the canoe i was making, yet i could go to the
cave and probably be safe from them. but if they had been sent by my people to take me away, then i should not hide.
the ship moved slowly between the black rocks

h meant that i was still unmarried. i was no longer
a girl, yet i made it anyway, using the blue clay and some white clay for the dots.
i went back to the house then and built a fire and cooked food for rontu-aru and me. i was not hungry and he ate my food 
and his too.
'we are going away,' i said to him, 'away from our island.'
but he only put his head to one side, as his father often had done, and when i said no more, he trotted out to a sunny place
and. lay down and fell asleep.
now that the white men had come back, i could not think of what i would do when i went across the sea, or make a picture in
my mind of the white men and what they did there, or see my people who had been gone so long. nor, thinking of the past, of
the many summers and winters and springs that had gone, could i see each of them. they were all one, a tight feeling in my
breast and nothing more.
the morning was full of sun. the wind smelled of the sea and the things that lived in it. i saw the men long before they saw

ures before we left, though the two men spoke among themselves. they liked my necklace, the cape,
and the cormorant skirt that shone in the sun. but when we got to the beach, where their camp was, the first thing the man
who spoke the most did was to tell the other men to make me a dress. 
i knew this was what he said because one of them stood in front of me and held up a string from my neck to my feet and
across my shoulders.
the dress was blue. it was made of two trousers, just like those the white men were wearing. the trousers were cut up into
pieces and then one of the men sat down on a rock and put them together again with white suing. he had a long nose, which
looked like the needle he used. he sat all afternoon on the rock and the needle went back and forth, in and out, hashing in the
sun.
from time to time he would hold up the dress and nod his head as if he were pleased. i nodded as if i were pleased, too, but i
was not. i wanted to wear my cormorant skirt and my otter cape, which wer

they pointed to my otter cape, but i still shook my head.
i asked them then about the ship that had taken my people away many years before, making the signs of the ship and pointing
to the east, but they did not understand. not until i came to mission santa barbara and met father gonzales did i learn from
him that this ship had sunk in a great storm soon after it reached his country and that on the whole ocean thereabouts there
was no other. for this reason the white men had not come back for me.
on the tenth day we sailed. it was a morning of blue skies and no wind. we went straight towards the sun.
for a long time i stood and looked back at the island of the blue dolphins. the last thing i saw of it was the high headland. i
thought of rontu lying there beneath the stones of many colours, and of won-a-nee, wherever she was, and the little red fox
that would scratch in vain at my fence, and my canoe hidden in the cave, and of all the happy days.

out of the sea and swam before the ship. they swam for many leagues in the morning through the bright water,
weaving their foam patterns. the little birds were chirping in their cage and rontu-aru sat beside me.
author's note
the island called in this book the island of the blue dolphins was first settled by indians in about 2000 b.c., but it was not
discovered by white men until i602.
in that year the spanish explorer sebasti~n vizcaino set out from mexico in search of a port where treasure galleons from the
philippines could find shelter in case of distress. sailing north along the california coast, he sighted the island, sent a small
boat ashore and named it la isla de san nicolas, in honour of the patron saint of sailors, travellers, and merchants.
as the centuries passed, california changed from spanish to mexican hands, the americans arrived, but only occasi
