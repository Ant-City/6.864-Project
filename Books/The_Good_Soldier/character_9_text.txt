ting it. for every man there comes
at last a time of life when the woman who then sets her seal upon his
imagination has set her seal for good. he will travel over no more
horizons; he will never again set the knapsack over his shoulders; he
will retire from those scenes. he will have gone out of the business.
that at any rate was the case with edward and the poor girl. it was
quite literally the case. it was quite literally the case that his
passions--for the mistress of the grand duke, for mrs basil, for little
mrs maidan, for florence, for whom you will--these passions were merely
preliminary canters compared to his final race with death for her. i
am certain of that. i am not going to be so american as to say that all
true love demands some sacrifice. it doesn't. but i think that love will
be truer and more permanent in which self-sacrifice has been exacted.
and, in the case of the other women, edward just cut in and cut them
out as he did with the polo-ball from under the nose of count

elevation that accompanies tragedy; there is about it no nemesis, no
destiny. here were two noble people--for i am convinced that both edward
and leonora had noble natures--here, then, were two noble natures,
drifting down life, like fireships afloat on a lagoon and causing
miseries, heart-aches, agony of the mind and death. and they themselves
steadily deteriorated. and why? for what purpose? to point what lesson?
it is all a darkness.

there is not even any villain in the story--for even major basil, the
husband of the lady who next, and really, comforted the unfortunate
edward--even major basil was not a villain in this piece. he was a
slack, loose, shiftless sort of fellow--but he did not do anything to
edward. whilst they were in the same station in burma he borrowed a
good deal of money--though, really, since major basil had no
particular vices, it was difficult to know why he wanted it. he
collected--different types of horses' bits from the earliest times to
the present day--but, sinc

up to a place called simla, where, as i understand, it is cool in
the summer and very social--when they went up to simla for their healths
it was she who had him prancing around, as we should say in the united
states, on a thousand-dollar horse with the gladdest of glad rags all
over him. she herself used to go into "retreat". i believe that was very
good for her health and it was also very inexpensive.

it was probably also very good for edward's health, because he pranced
about mostly with mrs basil, who was a nice woman and very, very kind to
him. i suppose she was his mistress, but i never heard it from edward,
of course. i seem to gather that they carried it on in a high romantic
fashion, very proper to both of them--or, at any rate, for edward; she
seems to have been a tender and gentle soul who did what he wanted. i do
not mean to say that she was without character; that was her job, to
do what edward wanted. so i figured it out, that for those five years,
edward wanted long passages

of deep affection kept up in long, long
talks and that every now and then they "fell," which would give edward
an opportunity for remorse and an excuse to lend the major another
fifty. i don't think that mrs basil considered it to be "falling"; she
just pitied him and loved him.

you see, leonora and edward had to talk about something during all these
years. you cannot be absolutely dumb when you live with a person unless
you are an inhabitant of the north of england or the state of maine. so
leonora imagined the cheerful device of letting him see the accounts of
his estate and discussing them with him. he did not discuss them much;
he was trying to behave prettily. but it was old mr mumford--the farmer

who did not pay his rent--that threw edward into mrs basil's arms. mrs
basil came upon edward in the dusk, in the burmese garden, with all
sorts of flowers and things. and he was cutting up that crop--with his
sword, not a walking-stick. he was also carrying on and cursing in a way
you would not believe.

she ascertained that an old gentleman called mumford had been ejected
from his farm and had been given a little cottage rent-free, where
he lived on ten shillings a week from a farmers' benevolent society,
supplemented by seven that was being allowed

trustees. edward had just discovered that fact from the estate accounts.
leonora had left them in his dressing-room and he had begun to read
them before taking off his marching-kit. that was how he came to have a
sword. leonora considered that she had been unusually generous to old mr
mumford in allowing him to inhabit a cottage, rent-free, and in giving
him seven shillings a week. anyhow, mrs basil had never seen a man in
such a state as edward was. she had been passionately in love with
him for quite a time, and he had been longing for her sympathy and
admiration with a passion as deep. that was how they came to speak about
it, in the burmese garden, under the pale sky, with sheaves of severed
vegetation, misty and odorous, in the night around their feet. i think
they behaved themselves with decorum for quite a time after that, though
mrs basil spent so many hours over the accounts of th

e ashburnham estate
that she got the name of every field by heart. edward had a huge map of
his lands in his harness-room and major basil did not seem to mind. i
believe that people do not mind much in lonely stations. it might
have lasted for ever if the major had not been made what is called a
brevet-colonel during the shuffling of troops that went on just before
the south african war. he was sent off somewhere else and, of course,
mrs basil could not stay with edward. edward ought, i suppose, to have
gone to the transvaal. it would have done him a great deal of good to
get killed. but leonora would not let him; she had heard awful stories
of the extravagance of the hussar regiment in war-time--how they left
hundred-bottle cases of champagne, at five guineas a bottle, on the
veldt and so on. besides, she preferred to see how edward was spending
his five hundred a year. i don't mean to say that edward had any
grievance in that. he w

 a disagreeable, alarming and
disturbing thing. the ship gets stopped and there are all sorts of
shouts. and edward would not promise not to do it again, though,
fortunately, they struck a streak of cooler weather when they were
in the persian gulf. leonora had got it into her head that edward was
trying to commit suicide, so i guess it was pretty awful for her when
he would not give the promise. leonora ought never to have been on that
troopship; but she got there somehow, as an economy.

major basil discovered his wife's relation with edward just before
he was sent to his other station. i don't know whether that was a
blackmailer's adroitness or just a trick of destiny. he may have known
of it all the time or he may not. at any rate, he got hold of, just
about then, some letters and things. it cost edward three hundred pounds
immediately. i do not know how it was arranged; i cannot imagine how
even a blackmailer can make his demands. i suppose there is some sort of
way of saving your face.

closing the letters
to edward with furious oaths, then accepting his explanations that the
letters were perfectly innocent if the wrong construction were not put
upon them. then the major would say: "i say, old chap, i'm deuced hard
up. couldn't you lend me three hundred or so?" i fancy that was how it
was. and, year by year, after that there would come a letter from the
major, saying that he was deuced hard up and couldn't edward lend him
three hundred or so? edward was pretty hard hit when mrs basil had to go
away. he really had been very fond of her, and he remained faithful to
her memory for quite a long time. and mrs basil had loved him very much
and continued to cherish a hope of reunion with him. three days ago
there came a quite proper but very lamentable letter from her to
leonora, asking to be given particulars as to edward's death. she had
read the advertisement of it in an indian paper. i think she must have
been a very nice woman....

and then the ashburnhams were moved somewher

, after
five or six years it had penetrated to her mind that it was painful to
edward to have to look on at the accounts of his estate and have no hand
in the management of it. she was trying to do him a kindness. and, up in
chitral, poor dear little maisie maidan came along....

that was the most unsettling to edward of all his affairs. it made him
suspect that he was inconstant. the affair with the dolciquita he had
sized up as a short attack of madness like hydrophobia. his relations
with mrs basil had not seemed to him to imply moral turpitude of a
gross kind. the husband had been complaisant; they had really loved each
other; his wife was very cruel to him and had long ceased to be a wife
to him. he thought that mrs basil had been his soul-mate, separated from
him by an unkind fate--something sentimental of that sort.

but he discovered that, whilst he was still writing long weekly letters
to mrs basil, he was beginning to be furiously impatient if he missed
seeing maisie maidan during

an was going to remain behind and die. and
then, that had come out.

the punkah swished in the darkened room; leonora lay exhausted and
motionless in her cane lounge; neither of them stirred. they were both
at that time very ill in indefinite ways.

and then leonora said:

"yes. i promised it to charlie maidan this afternoon. i have offered to
pay her ex's myself."

edward just saved himself from saying: "good god!" you see, he had not
the least idea of what leonora knew--about maisie, about mrs basil, even
about la dolciquita. it was a pretty enigmatic situation for him. it
struck him that leonora must be intending to manage his loves as she
managed his money affairs and it made her more hateful to him--and more
worthy of respect.

leonora, at any rate, had managed his money to some purpose. she had
spoken to him, a week before, for the first time in several years--about
money. she had made twenty-two thousand pounds out of the branshaw
land and seven by the letting of branshaw furnished. b

im as a principle, for ever. her spiritual advisers, i believe,
forbade that. but she stipulated that he must, in some way, perhaps
symbolical, come back to her. she was not very clear as to what she
meant; probably she did not know herself. or perhaps she did.

there were moments when he seemed to be coming back to her; there were
moments when she was within a hair of yielding to her physical passion
for him. in just the same way, at moments, she almost yielded to the
temptation to denounce mrs basil to her husband or maisie maidan
to hers. she desired then to cause the horrors and pains of public
scandals. for, watching edward more intently and with more straining of
ears than that which a cat bestows upon a bird overhead, she was aware
of the progress of his passion for each of these ladies. she was aware
of it from the way in which his eyes returned to doors and gateways; she
knew from his tranquillities when he had received satisfactions.

at times she imagined herself to see more than

ted. she
imagined that edward was carrying on intrigues with other women--with
two at once; with three. for whole periods she imagined him to be a
monster of libertinage and she could not see that he could have anything
against her. she left him his liberty; she was starving herself to build
up his fortunes; she allowed herself none of the joys of femininity--no
dresses, no jewels--hardly even friendships, for fear they should cost
money.

and yet, oddly, she could not but be aware that both mrs basil and
maisie maidan were nice women. the curious, discounting eye which one
woman can turn on another did not prevent her seeing that mrs basil was
very good to edward and mrs maidan very good for him. that seemed her to
be a monstrous and incomprehensible working of fate's. incomprehensible!
why, she asked herself again and again, did none of the good deeds that
she did for her husband ever come through to him, or appear to him as
good deeds? by what trick of mania could not he let her be as goo

him as mrs basil was? mrs basil was not so extraordinarily dissimilar to
herself. she was, it was true, tall, dark, with soft mournful voice and
a great kindness of manner for every created thing, from punkah men to
flowers on the trees. but she was not so well read as leonora, at any
rate in learned books. leonora could not stand novels. but, even with
all her differences, mrs basil did not appear to leonora to differ so
very much from herself. she was truthful, honest and, for the rest, just
a woman. and leonora had a vague sort of idea that, to a man, all women
are the same after three weeks of close intercourse. she thought that
the kindness should no longer appeal, the soft and mournful voice no
longer thrill, the tall darkness no longer give a man the illusion
that he was going into the depths of an unexplored wood. she could not
understand how edward could go on and

on maundering over mrs basil. she
could not see why he should continue to write her long letters after
their separation. after that, indeed, she had a very bad time.

she had at that period what i will call the "monstrous" theory of
edward. she was always imagining him ogling at every woman that he came
across. she did not, that year, go into "retreat" at simla because she
was afraid that he would corrupt her maid in her absence. she imagined
him carrying on intrigues with native women or eurasians. at dances she
was in a

fever of watchfulness.

she persuaded herself that this was because she had a dread of scandals.
edward might get himself mixed up with a marriageable daughter of some
man who would make a row or some husband who would matter. but, really,
she acknowledged afterwards to herself, she was hoping that, mrs basil
being out of the way, the time might have come when edward should return
to her. all that period she passed in an agony of jealousy and fear--the
fear that edward might really become promiscuous in his habits.

so that, in an odd way, she was glad when maisie maidan came along--and
she realized that she had not, before, been afraid of husbands and
of scandals, since, then, she did her best to keep maisie's husband
unsuspicious. she wished to appear so trustful of edward that maidan
could not po

aking eyes at edward. but she had seen so many women make eyes at
edward--hundreds and hundreds of women, in railway trains, in hotels,
aboard liners, at street corners. and she had arrived at thinking that
edward took little stock in women that made eyes at him. she had formed
what was, at that time, a fairly correct estimate of the methods of,
the reasons for, edward's loves. she was certain that hitherto they had
consisted of the short passion for the dolciquita, the real sort of
love for mrs basil, and what she deemed the pretty courtship of maisie
maidan. besides she despised florence so haughtily that she could not
imagine edward's being attracted by her. and she and maisie were a
sort of bulwark round him. she wanted, besides, to keep her eyes on
florence--for florence knew that she had boxed maisie's ears. and
leonora desperately desired that her union with edward should appear to
be flawless. but all that went....

with the answering gaze of edward into florence's blue and uplifted

 
 ___________________________
 
she was aware that florence had
become edward's mistress. she waited outside florence's door and met
edward as he came away. she said nothing and he only grunted. but i
guess he had a bad time.

yes, the mental deterioration that florence worked in leonora was
extraordinary; it smashed up her whole life and all her chances. it
made her, in the first place, hopeless--for she could not see how, after
that, edward could return to her--after a vulgar intrigue with a vulgar
woman. his affair with mrs basil, which was now all that she had to
bring, in her heart, against him, she could not find it in her to call
an intrigue. it was a love affair--a pure enough thing in its way. but
this seemed to her to be a horror--a wantonness, all the more detestable
to her, because she so detested florence. and florence talked....

that was what was terrible, because florence forced leonora herself to
abandon her high reserve--florence and the situation. it appears that
florence was in two minds whether to conf

s a sentimentalist.

and the moment that she heard that, leonora determined that the girl
should not go five thousand miles away and that she should not continue
to love edward. the way she worked it was this:

she continued to tell the girl that she must belong to edward; she was
going to get a divorce; she was going to get a dissolution of marriage
from rome. but she considered it to be her duty to warn the girl of the
sort of monster that edward was. she told the girl of la dolciquita, of
mrs basil, of maisie maidan, of florence. she spoke of the agonies
that she had endured during her life with the man, who was violent,
overbearing, vain, drunken, arrogant, and monstrously a prey to his
sexual necessities. and, at hearing of the miseries her aunt had
suffered--for leonora once more had the aspect of an aunt to the
girl--with the swift cruelty of youth and, with the swift solidarity
that attaches woman to woman, the girl made her resolves. her aunt said
incessantly: "you must save edward'

 of a time. having discovered what he wanted--that
the girl should go five thousand miles away and love him steadfastly
as people do in sentimental novels, she was determined to smash that
aspiration. and she repeated to edward in every possible tone that the
girl did not love him; that the girl detested him for his brutality, his
overbearingness, his drinking habits. she pointed out that edward in the
girl's eyes, was already pledged three or four deep. he was pledged to
leonora herself, to mrs basil, and to the memories of maisie maidan and
to florence. edward never said anything.

did the girl love edward, or didn't she? i don't know. at that time i
daresay she didn't though she certainly had done so before leonora had
got to work upon his reputation. she certainly had loved him for what
i call the public side of his record--for his good soldiering, for his
saving lives at sea, for the excellent landlord that he was and the good
sportsman. but it is quite possible that all those things ca

deeply and tenderly.

it is nothing to the point that she let him have it good and strong as
soon as she discovered that he had been unfaithful to leonora and that
his public services had cost more than leonora thought they ought to
have cost. nancy would be bound to let him have it good and strong then.
she would owe that to feminine public opinion; she would be driven to it
by the instinct for self-preservation, since she might well imagine
that if edward had been unfaithful to leonora, to mrs basil and to the
memories of the other two, he might be unfaithful to herself. and,
no doubt, she had her share of the sex instinct that makes women be
intolerably cruel to the beloved person. anyhow, i don't know whether,
at this point, nancy rufford loved edward ashburnham. i don't know
whether she even loved him when, on getting, at aden, the news of his
suicide she went mad. because that may just as well have been for the
sake of leonora as for the sake of edward. or it may have been for the
sake
