Sensible particular - 
 Sensible particulars are the objects that we experience
all around us--trees, flowers, chairs--any physical objects. They
are "sensible" because we can sense them with our sight, smell,
hearing, taste, and touch; they are "particular," because they are particular
items that undergo change over time, rather than universal, unchanging
ideas. According to Plato's metaphysical picture, the visible realm
is made up of sensible particulars. According to his epistemological picture,
sensible particulars cannot be objects of knowledge but only of
opinion.
