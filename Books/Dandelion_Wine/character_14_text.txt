or searching out the smell of the goldfuzzed bees that hung around our back porch grape 
arbor. bees do have a smell, you know, and if they don't they should, for their feet are 
dusted with spices from a million flowers. 

and then i wanted to call back what the ravine was like, especially on those nights 
when walking home late across town, after seeing lon chaney's delicious fright the 
phantom of the opera, my brother skip would run ahead and hide under the ravine-creek 
bridge like the lonely one and leap out and grab me, shrieking, so i ran, fell, and ran 
again, gibbering all the way home. that was great stuff. 

along the way i came upon and collided, through word-association, with old and true 
friendships. i borrowed my friend john huff from my childhood in arizona and shipped 
him east to green town so that i could say good-bye to him properly. 

along the way, i sat me down to breakfasts, lunches, and dinners with the long dead 
and much loved. for i was a boy who did indeed love

waukegan/green town/byzantium. green town did exist, then? yes, and again, yes. 
was there a real boy named john huff? 

there was. and that was truly his name. but he didn't go away from me, i went away 
from him. but, happy ending, he is still alive, forty-two years later, and remembers our 
love. 

was there a lonely one? 

there was, and that was his name. and he moved around at night in my home town 
when i was six years old and he frightened everyone and was never captured. 

most importantly, did the big house itself, with grandpa and grandma and the 
boarders and uncles and aunts in it exist? i have already answered that. 

is the ravine real and deep and dark at night? it was, it is. i took my daughters there 
a few years back, fearful that the ravine might have gone shallow with time. i am

e, light, and activity. here and there, back off from where they were 
walking, faint squares of light glowed where people were still up. but most of the houses, 
darkened, were sleeping already, and there were a few lightless places where the 
occupants of a dwelling sat talking low night talk on their front porches. you heard a 
porch swing squeaking as you walked by. 

"i wish your father was home," said mother. her large hand squeezed around his small 
one. "just wait'll i get that boy. the lonely one's around again. killing people. no one's 
safe anymore. you never know when the lonely one'll turn up or where. so help me, 
when doug gets home i'll spank him within an inch of his life." 

now they had walked another block and were standing by the holy black silhouette of 
the german baptist church at the corner of chapel street and glen rock. in back of the 
church, a hundred yards away, the ravine began. he could smell it. it had a dark-sewer, 
rotten-foliage, thick-green odor. it was a wid

y, no more to comment succinctly on politics. death was his little sister one 
morning when he awoke at the age of seven, looked into her crib, and saw her staring up 
at him with a blind, blue, fixed and frozen stare until the men came with a small wicker 
basket to take her away. death was when he stood by her high chair four weeks later 
and suddenly realized she'd never be in it again, laughing and crying and making him 
jealous of her because she was born. that was death. and death was the lonely one, 
unseen, walking and standing behind trees, waiting in the country to come in, once or 
twice a year, to this town, to these streets, to these many places where there was little 
light, to kill one, two, three women in the past three years. that was death . . . 

but this was more than death. this summer night deep down under the stars was all 
things you would ever feel or see or hear in your life, drowning you all at once.

they looked and saw the vapors rise and drift in long swathes of cool smoke. 

"no," said charlie. "you know who lives here? only one guy. a guy who gives you 
goose-pimples just to think of him." charlie dropped his voice very low. "the lonely

lavinia nebbs locked her front door and, leaving her lemonade glass half empty on the 
porch, said, "it's a fine night for the movie." 

they walked down the street. 

"where you going, girls?" cried miss fern and miss roberta from their porch over the 
way. 

lavinia called back through the soft ocean of darkness: "to the elite theater to see 
charlie chaplin!"

"won't catch us out on no night like this," wailed miss fern. "not with the lonely one 
strangling women. lock ourselves up in our closet with a gun." 

"oh, bosh!" lavinia heard the old women's door bang and lock, and she drifted on, 
feeling the warm breath of summer night shimmering off the oven-baked sidewalks. it 
was like walking on a hard crust of freshly warmed bread. the heat pulsed under your 
dress, along your legs, with a stealthy and not unpleasant sense of invasion. 

"lavinia, you don't believe all that about the lonely one, do you?"

"hattie mcdollis was a silly girl, walked off with a traveling man, i bet." 

"but the others, all of them, strangled, their tongues sticking out their mouths, they 
say." 

they stood upon the edge of the ravine that cut the town half in two. behind them 
were the lit houses and music, ahead was deepness, moistness, fireflies and dark. 

"maybe we shouldn't go to the show tonight," said francine. "the lonely one might 
follow and kill us. i don't like that ravine. look at it, will you!" 

lavinia looked and the ravine was a dynamo that never stopped running, night or day; 
there was a great moving hum, a bumbling and murmuring of creature, insect, or plant 
life. it smelled like a greenhouse, of secret vapors and ancient, washed shales and 
quicksands. and always the black dynamo humming, with sparkles like great electricity 
where fireflies moved on the air.

"bosh!" said lavinia nebbs. 

"it'll be you alone on the path, listening to your shoes, not me. you all alone on the 
way back to your house. lavinia, don't you get lonely living in that house?" 

"old maids love to live alone." lavinia pointed at the hot shadowy path leading down 
into the dark. "let's take the short cut."

pressed tightly back into them behind the bronze knobs and knockers. baseball bats and 
balls lay upon the unfootprinted lawns. a half-drawn, white-chalk game of hopscotch lay 
on the broiled, steamed sidewalk. it was as if someone had predicted freezing weather a 
moment ago.

"lonely one won't kill three ladies," said lavinia. "there's safety in numbers. and 
besides, it's too soon. the killings always come a month separated." 

a shadow fell across their terrified faces. a figure loomed behind a tree. as if someone 
had struck an organ a terrible blow with his fist, the three women gave off a scream, in 
three different shrill notes. 

"got you!" roared a voice. the man plunged at them. he came into the light, laughing. 
he leaned against a tree, pointing at the ladies weakly,

"frank dillon!"

riddle you with bullets!" 

"what a thing to do!" 

francine began to cry hysterically. 

frank dillon stopped smiling. "say, i'm sorry." 

"go away!" said lavinia. "haven't you heard about elizabeth ramsell— found dead in

"it was just a man," said lavinia, turning in a slow circle to look at the town. 

"so is frank dillon a man, but maybe he's the lonely one." 

francine hadn't come out with them, they noticed, and turning, they found her 
arriving. "i made him give me a description-the druggist. i made him tell what the man 
looked like. a stranger," she said, "in a dark suit. sort of pale and thin."

late night air, stirring, restirring the smells of vanilla, raspberry, peppermint and lysol.

"we shouldn't have stopped for these sodas. the police warned-" 

"oh, bosh the police," laughed lavinia. "i'm not afraid of anything. the lonely one is

wait. wasn't the film wonderful?" 

"closing up, ladies." the druggist switched off the lights in the cool white-tiled silence.

the wind blew the odor of cut grass between them. the moon was sinking in a sky that

"i'll be going on." 

"sometimes—" 

"sometimes what?" 

"sometimes i think people want to die. you've acted odd all evening." 

"i'm just not afraid," said lavinia. "and i'm curious, i suppose. and i'm using my 
head. logically, the lonely one can't be around. the police and all." 

"the police are home with their covers up over their ears." 

"let's just say i'm enjoying myself, precariously, but safely. if there was any real 
chance of anything happening to me, i'd stay here with you, you can be sure of that." 

"maybe part of you doesn't want to live anymore."

"but you live across the ravine ..."

yes, she thought, but i won't walk through the ravine with any man, not even an

"don't take it so hard, charlie." 

"well, what're we going to talk about now? it's no use talking the lonely one if he 
ain't even alive! it's not scary anymore!" 

"don't know about you, charlie," said tom. "i'm going back to summer's ice house 
and sit in the door and pretend he's alive and get cold all up and down my spine." 

"that's cheating." 

"you got to take your chills where you can find them, charlie." 

douglas did not listen to tom and charlie. he looked at lavinia nebbs's house and

tom and charlie, in turn, ignored douglas. 

"for that matter," said tom. "i don't really think the lonely one is dead." 

"you were here this morning when the ambulance came to bring that man out on the 
stretcher, weren't you?"

escaping, old lavinia nebbs up and stabbed him with a handy pair of sewing scissors. i

tom waited, smiling.
