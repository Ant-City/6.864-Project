warded me.
“everybody who goes home to lunch hold up your hands,” said miss caroline,
breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia.
the town children did so, and she looked us over.
“everybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk.”
molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic
light. miss caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch
containers, nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. she
stopped at walter cunningham’s desk. “where’s yours?” she asked.
walter cunningham’s face told everybody in the first grade he had hookworms.
his absence of shoes told us how he got them. people caught hookworms going
barefooted in barnyards and hog wallows. if walter had owned any shoes he
would have worn them the first day of school and then discarded them until mid-
winter. he did have on a clean shirt and neatly mended overalls.
“did you forget your lunch this morning?” asked miss caroline.

urned around and saw most of the town people and the entire bus delegation
looking at me. miss caroline and i had conferred twice already, and they were
looking at me in the innocent assurance that familiarity breeds understanding.
i rose graciously on walter’s behalf: “ah—miss caroline?”
“what is it, jean louise?”
“miss caroline, he’s a cunningham.”
i sat back down.
“what, jean louise?”
i thought i had made things sufficiently clear. it was clear enough to the rest of
us: walter cunningham was sitting there lying his head off. he didn’t forget his
lunch, he didn’t have any. he had none today nor would he have any tomorrow or
the next day. he had probably never seen three quarters together at the same time
in his life.
i tried again: “walter’s one of the cunninghams, miss caroline.”
“i beg your pardon, jean louise?”
“that’s okay, ma’am, you’ll get to know all the county folks after a while. the
cunninghams never took anything they can’t pay back—no church

 from this room i’ll burn up everybody in it. miss caroline, the
sixth grade cannot concentrate on the pyramids for all this racket!”
my sojourn in the corner was a short one. saved by the bell, miss caroline
watched the class file out for lunch. as i was the last to leave, i saw her sink
down into her chair and bury her head in her arms. had her conduct been more
friendly toward me, i would have felt sorry for her. she was a pretty little thing.

chapter 3

catching walter cunningham in the schoolyard gave me some pleasure, but when
i was rubbing his nose in the dirt jem came by and told me to stop. “you’re

bigger’n he is,” he said.
“he’s as old as you, nearly,” i said. “he made me start off on the wrong foot.”
“let him go, scout. why?”
“he didn’t have any lunch,” i said, and explained my involvement in walter’s
dietary affairs.
walter had picked himself up and was standing quietly listening to jem and me.
his fists were half cocked, as if ex

pecting an onslaught from both of us. i stomped
at him to chase him away, but jem put out his hand and stopped me. he examined
walter with an air of speculation. “your daddy mr. walter cunningham from old
sarum?” he asked, and walter nodded.
walter looked as if he had been raised on fish food: his eyes, as blue as dill
harris’s, were red-rimmed and watery. there was no color in his face except at
the tip of his nose, which was moistly pink. he fingered the straps of his overalls,
nervously picking at the metal hooks.
jem suddenly grinned at him. “come on home to dinner with us, walter,” he said.
“we’d be glad to have you.”
walter’s face brightened, then darkened.
jem sai

ould tell
what i was gonna do. can’t anybody tell what i’m gonna do lest they know me,
can they, scout?”
jem’s question was an appeal. i reassured him: “can’t anybody tell what you’re
gonna do lest they live in the house with you, and even i can’t tell sometimes.”
we were walking past our tree. in its knot-hole rested a ball of gray twine.
“don’t take it, jem,” i said. “this is somebody’s hidin‘ place.”
“i don’t think so, scout.”
“yes it is. somebody like walter cunningham comes down here every recess and
hides his things—and we come along and take ‘em away from him. listen, let’s
leave it and wait a couple of days. if it ain’t gone then, we’ll take it, okay?”
“okay, you might be right,” said jem. “it must be some little kid’s place—hides
his things from the bigger folks. you know it’s only when school’s in that we’ve
found things.”
“yeah,” i said, “but we never go by here in the summertime.”
we went home. next morning the tw

veralls and denim shirts buttoned up to the collars. i thought they must be cold-
natured, as their sleeves were unrolled and buttoned at the cuffs. some wore hats
pulled firmly down over their ears. they were sullen-looking, sleepy-eyed men
who seemed unused to late hours. i sought once more for a familiar face, and at
the center of the semi-circle i found one.
“hey, mr. cunningham.”
the man did not hear me, it seemed.
“hey, mr. cunningham. how’s your entailment gettin‘ along?”
mr. walter cunningham’s legal affairs were well known to me; atticus had once
described them at length. the big man blinked and hooked his thumbs in his
overall straps. he seemed uncomfortable; he cleared his throat and looked away.
my friendly overture had fallen flat.
mr. cunningham wore no hat, and the top half of his forehead was white in
contrast to his sunscorched face, which led me to believe that he wore one most
days. he shifted his feet, clad in heavy work shoes.
“don’t you remember me, mr. cunningha

ngham was part of a mob last night, but he was still a man.
every mob in every little southern town is always made up of people you know—
doesn’t say much for them, does it?”
“i’ll say not,” said jem.
“so it took an eight-year-old child to bring ‘em to their senses, didn’t it?” said
atticus. “that proves something—that a gang of wild animals can be stopped,
simply because they’re still human. hmp, maybe we need a police force of
children… you children last night made walter cunningham stand in my shoes
for a minute. that was enough.”
well, i hoped jem would understand folks a little better when he was older; i
wouldn’t. “first day walter comes back to school’ll be his last,” i affirmed.
“you will not touch him,” atticus said flatly. “i don’t want either of you bearing a
grudge about this thing, no matter what happens.”

“you see, don’t you,” said aunt alexandra, “what comes of things like this.
don’t say i haven’t told you.”
atticus said he

 on the jury a man who wanted to
kill you the night before? how could you take such a risk, atticus, how could
you?”
“when you analyze it, there was little risk. there’s no difference between one
man who’s going to convict and another man who’s going to convict, is there?
there’s a faint difference between a man who’s going to convict and a man who’s

a little disturbed in his mind, isn’t there? he was the only uncertainty on the
whole list.”
“what kin was that man to mr. walter cunningham?” i asked.
atticus rose, stretched and yawned. it was not even our bedtime, but we knew he
wanted a chance to read his newspaper. he picked it up, folded it, and tapped my
head. “let’s see now,” he droned to himself. “i’ve got it. double first cousin.”
“how can that be?”
“two sisters married two brothers. that’s all i’ll tell you—you figure it out.”
i tortured myself and decided that if i married jem and dill had a sister whom he
married our children would be double

 a threat, never a promise. surprised, i turned to her. “why not, aunty?
they’re good folks.”
she looked at me over her sewing glasses. “jean louise, there is no doubt in my
mind that they’re good folks. but they’re not our kind of folks.”
jem says, “she means they’re yappy, scout.”
“what’s a yap?”
“aw, tacky. they like fiddlin‘ and things like that.”
“well i do too—”

“don’t be silly, jean louise,” said aunt alexandra. “the thing is, you can scrub
walter cunningham till he shines, you can put him in shoes and a new suit, but
he’ll never be like jem. besides, there’s a drinking streak in that family a mile
wide. finch women aren’t interested in that sort of people.”
“aun-ty,” said jem, “she ain’t nine yet.”
“she may as well learn it now.”
aunt alexandra had spoken. i was reminded vividly of the last time she had put
her foot down. i never knew why. it was when i was absorbed with plans to visit
calpurnia’s house—i was curious, int

e.”
“what if he was kin to us, aunty?”
“the fact is that he is not kin to us, but if he were, my answer would be the same.”
“aunty,” jem spoke up, “atticus says you can choose your friends but you sho‘
can’t choose your family, an’ they’re still kin to you no matter whether you
acknowledge ‘em or not, and it makes you look right silly when you don’t.”
“that’s your father all over again,” said aunt alexandra, “and i still say that jean
louise will not invite walter cunningham to this house. if he were her double
first cousin once removed he would still not be received in this house unless he
comes to see atticus on business. now that is that.”
she had said indeed not, but this time she would give her reasons: “but i want to
play with walter, aunty, why can’t i?”
she took off her glasses and stared at me. “i’ll tell you why,” she said. “because—
he—is—trash, that’s why you can’t play with him. i’ll not have you around him,

ything.
“it’s real nice, jem.”
“under my arms, too,” he said. “goin‘ out for football next year. scout, don’t let
aunty aggravate you.”
it seemed only yesterday that he was telling me not to aggravate aunty.
“you know she’s not used to girls,” said jem, “leastways, not girls like you. she’s
trying to make you a lady. can’t you take up sewin‘ or somethin’?”
“hell no. she doesn’t like me, that’s all there is to it, and i don’t care. it was her
callin‘ walter cunningham trash that got me goin’, jem, not what she said about
being a problem to atticus. we got that all straight one time, i asked him if i was
a problem and he said not much of one, at most one that he could always figure
out, and not to worry my head a second about botherin‘ him. naw, it was walter—

that boy’s not trash, jem. he ain’t like the ewells.”
jem kicked off his shoes and swung his feet to the bed. he propped himself
against a pillow and switched on the reading light. “you
