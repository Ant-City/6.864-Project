[CHARACTER] - 
                gene's
classmate and best friend. [CHARACTER] is honest, handsome, self-confident,
disarming, extremely likable, and the best athlete in the school;
in short, he seems perfect in almost every way. he has a talent
for engaging others with his spontaneity and sheer joy of living,
and, while he frequently gets into trouble, he has the ability to
talk his way out of almost any predicament. according to gene, he
is rare among human beings in that he never perceives anyone as
an enemy, and never strives to defeat others. [CHARACTER]'s behaviors
also suggest that he relishes pure achievement rather than competition.
his fatal flaw is that he assumes that everyone is like him--that everyone
shares his enthusiastic and good-natured spirit.
