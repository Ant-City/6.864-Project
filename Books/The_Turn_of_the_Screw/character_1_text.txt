nd kept them there,
from the first, with the best people he could find to look after them,
parting even with his own servants to wait on them and going down
himself, whenever he might, to see how they were doing. the awkward
thing was that they had practically no other relations and that his
own affairs took up all his time. he had put them in possession of bly,
which was healthy and secure, and had placed at the head of their little
establishment--but below stairs only--an excellent woman, mrs. grose,
whom he was sure his visitor would like and who had formerly been maid
to his mother. she was now housekeeper and was also acting for the time
as superintendent to the little girl, of whom, without children of her
own, she was, by good luck, extremely fond. there were plenty of people
to help, but of course the young lady who should go down as governess
would be in supreme authority. she would also have, in holidays, to look
after the small boy, who had been for a term at school--young as he w

to be sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were
about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. there had
been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the
misfortune to lose. she had done for them quite beautifully--she was a
most respectable person--till her death, the great awkwardness of which
had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little miles.
mrs. grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as
she could for flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a
dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise
thoroughly respectable.

so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.
â€œand what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?â€

our friendâ€™s answer was prompt. â€œthat will come out. i donâ€™t
anticipate.â€

been the mistress or a distinguished visitor. i had received in harley
street a narrower notion of the place, and that, as i recalled it, made
me think the proprietor still more of a gentleman, suggested that what i
was to enjoy might be something beyond his promise.

i had no drop again till the next day, for i was carried triumphantly
through the following hours by my introduction to the younger of my
pupils. the little girl who accompanied mrs. grose appeared to me on the
spot a creature so charming as to make it a great fortune to have to
do with her. she was the most beautiful child i had ever seen, and i
afterward wondered that my employer had not told me more of her. i slept
little that night--i was too much excited; and this astonished me, too,
i recollect, remained with me, adding to my sense of the liberality with
which i was treated. the large, impressive room, one of the best in
the house, the great state bed, as i almost felt it,

myself from head to foot, all struck me--like the extraordinary charm of
my small charge--as so many things thrown in. it was thrown in as
well, from the first moment, that i should get on with mrs. grose in
a relation over which, on my way, in the coach, i fear i had rather
brooded. the only thing indeed that in this early outlook might have
made me shrink again was the clear circumstance of her being so glad
to see me. i perceived within half an hour that she was so glad--stout,
simple, plain, clean, wholesome woman--as to be positively on her guard
against showing it too much. i wondered even then a little why she
should wish not to show it, and that, with reflection, with suspicion,

be the making of a happy and useful life. it had been agreed between us
downstairs that after this first occasion i should have her as a matter
of course at night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that
end, in my room. what i had undertaken was the whole care of her, and
she had remained, just this last time, with mrs. grose only as an effect
of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural
timidity. in spite of this timidity--which the child herself, in the
oddest way in the world, had been perfectly frank and brave about,
allowing it, without a sign of uncomfortable consciousness, with the
deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of raphaelâ€™s holy infants, to be
discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us--i feel quite sure
she would presently like me. it was part of what i already liked mr

beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with
placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.

â€œyes; if i do--?â€

â€œyou will be carried away by the little gentleman!â€

â€œwell, that, i think, is what i came for--to be carried away. iâ€™m
afraid, however,â€ i remember feeling the impulse to add, â€œiâ€™m rather
easily carried away. i was carried away in london!â€

i can still see mrs. groseâ€™s broad face as she took this in. â€œin harley

â€œin harley street.â€

â€œwell, miss, youâ€™re not the first--and you wonâ€™t be the last.â€

other pupil, at any rate, as i understand, comes back tomorrow?â€

â€œnot tomorrow--friday, miss. he arrives, as you did, by the coach, under
care of the guard, and is to be met by the same carriage.â€

friendly thing would be therefore that on the arrival of the public
conveyance i should be in waiting for him with his little sister; an
idea in which mrs. grose concurred so heartily that i somehow took
her manner as a kind of comforting pledge--never falsified, thank
heaven!--that we should on every question be quite at one. oh, she was
glad i was there!

what i felt the next day was, i suppose, nothing that could be fairly
called a reaction from the cheer of my arrival; it was probably at the
most only a slight oppression produced by a fuller measure of the
scale, as i walked round them, gazed up at them, took them in, of my new

big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of

the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a

this came home to me when, two days later, i drove over with flora to
meet, as mrs. grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for
an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply
disconcerted me. the first day had been, on the whole, as i have
expressed, reassuring; but i was to see it wind up in keen apprehension.
the postbag, that evening--it came late--contained a letter for me,
which, however, in the hand of my employer, i found to be composed but
of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal
still unbroken. â€œthis, i recognize, 
 
 ___________________________
 
 please; deal with him; but mind
you donâ€™t report. not a word. iâ€™m off!â€ i broke the seal with a great
effort--so great a one that i was a long time coming to it; took the
unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before
going to bed. i had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me
a second sleepless night. with no counsel to take, the next day, i
was full of distress; and it finally got so the better of me that i
determined to open myself at least to mrs. grose.

â€œwhat does it mean? the childâ€™s dismissed his school.â€

she gave me a look that i remarked at the moment; then, visibly, with a
quick blankness, seemed to try to take it back. â€œbut arenâ€™t they all--?â€

â€œsent home--yes. but only for the holidays. miles may never go back at
all.â€

consciously, under my attention, she reddened. â€œthey wonâ€™t take him?â€

â€œthey absolutely decline.â€

at this she raised her eyes, which she had turned from me; i saw them
fill with good tears.

ly. â€œsuch things are not for me,
miss.â€

my counselor couldnâ€™t read! i winced at my mistake, which i attenuated
as i could, and opened my letter again to repeat it to her; then,
faltering in the act and folding it up once more, i put it back in my
pocket. â€œis he really bad?â€

the tears were still in her eyes. â€œdo the gentlemen say so?â€

â€œthey go into no particulars. they simply express their regret that it
should be impossible to keep him. that can have only one meaning.â€
 mrs. grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what
this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some
coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, i went
on: â€œthat heâ€™s an injury to the others.â€

at this, with one of the quick turns of simple folk, she suddenly flamed
up. â€œmaster miles! him an injury?â€

there was such a flood of good faith in it that, though i had not yet
seen the child, my very fears made me jump to the absurdity of the idea.

i found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot,
sarcastically. â€œto his poor little innocent mates!â€

â€œitâ€™s too dreadful,â€ cried mrs. grose, â€œto say such cruel things! why,
heâ€™s scarce ten years old.â€

â€œyes, yes; it would be incredible.â€

she was evidently grateful for such a profession. â€œsee him, miss, first.
then believe it!â€ i felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was
the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen
almost to pain. mrs. grose was aware, i could judge, of what she had
produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. â€œyou might as
well believe it of the little

she expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from
disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish
light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had
conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should
follow me. i needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of
mrs. groseâ€™s comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her
with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.

nonetheless, the rest of the day i watched for further occasion to
approach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, i began to fancy
she rather sought to avoid me. i overtook her, i remember, on the
staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom i detained her,
holding her there with a hand on her arm. â€œi take what you said to me at
noon as a declaration that youâ€™ve n

but the next day, as the hour for my drive approached, i cropped up in
another place. â€œwhat was the lady who was here before?â€

â€œthe last governess? she was also young and pretty--almost as young and
almost as pretty, miss, even as you.â€

â€œah, then, i hope her youth and her beauty helped her!â€ i recollect
throwing off. â€œhe seems to like us young and pretty!â€

â€œoh, he did,â€ mrs. grose assented: â€œit was the way he liked everyone!â€
 she had no sooner spoken indeed than she caught herself up. â€œi mean
thatâ€™s his way--the masterâ€™s.â€

i was struck. â€œbut of whom did you speak first?â€

she looked blank, but she colored. â€œwhy, of him.â€

â€œof the master?â€

â€œof who else?â€

there was so obviously no one else that the next moment i had lost my
impression of her having accidentally said more than she meant; and i
merely asked what i wanted to know. â€œdid she se

â€œthat wasnâ€™t right? she never told me.â€

i had a scruple, but i overcame it. â€œwas she careful--particular?â€

mrs. grose appeared to try to be conscientious. â€œabout some
things--yes.â€

â€œbut not about all?â€

again she considered. â€œwell, miss--sheâ€™s gone. i wonâ€™t tell tales.â€

â€œi quite understand your feeling,â€ i hastened to reply; but i thought
it, after an instant, not opposed to this concession to pursue: â€œdid she
die here?â€

â€œno--she went off.â€

i donâ€™t know what there was in this brevity of mrs. groseâ€™s that struck
me as ambiguous. â€œwent off to die?â€ mrs. grose looked straig

to which the time she had put in had certainly given her a right. we
had then a young woman--a nursemaid who had stayed on and who was a good
girl and clever; and she took the children altogether for the interval.
but our young lady never came back, and at the very moment i was
expecting her i heard from the master that she was dead.â€

i turned this over. â€œbut of what?â€

â€œhe never told me! but please, miss,â€ said mrs. grose, â€œi must get to my

her thus turning her back on me was fortunately not, for my just
preoccupations, a snub that could check the growth of our mutual esteem.
we met, after i had brought home little miles, more intimately than ever
on the ground of my stupefaction, my general emotion: so monstrous was i
then ready to pronounce it that such a child as had now been revealed to
me should be under an interdict. i was a little late on the scene, and
i felt, as he stood wistfully l

inn at which the coach had put him down, that i had seen him, on the
instant, without and within, in the great glow of freshness, the same
positive fragrance of purity, in which i had, from the first moment,
seen his little sister. he was incredibly beautiful, and mrs. grose had
put her finger on it: everything but a sort of passion of tenderness for
him was swept away by his presence. what i then and there took him to
my heart for was something divine that i have never found to the same
degree in any child--his indescribable little air of knowing nothing in
the world but love. it would have been impossible to carry a bad name
with a greater sweetness of innocence, and by the time i had got back to
bly with him i remained merely bewildered--so far, that is, as i wa

a drawer. as soon as i could compass a private word with mrs. grose i
declared to her that it was grotesque.

she promptly understood me. â€œyou mean the cruel charge--?â€

â€œit doesnâ€™t live an instant. my dear woman, look at him!â€

she smiled at my pretention to have discovered his charm. â€œi assure
you, miss, i do nothing else! what will you say, then?â€ she immediately
added.

â€œin answer to the letter?â€ i had made up my mind. â€œnothing.â€

i was incisive. â€œnothing.â€

â€œand to the boy himself?â€

collision; i only recall that when i re-entered the house darkness had
quite closed in. agitation, in the interval, certainly had held me and
driven me, for i must, in circling about the place, have walked three
miles; but i was to be, later on, so much more overwhelmed that this
mere dawn of alarm was a comparatively human chill. the most singular
part of it, in fact--singular as the rest had been--was the part i
became, in the hall, aware of in meeting mrs. grose. this picture comes
back to me in the general train--the impression, as i received it on my
return, of the wide white panelled space, bright in the lamplight and
with its portraits and red carpet, and of the good surprised look of
my friend, which immediately told me she had missed me. it came to
me straightway, under her contact, that, with plain heartiness, mere
relieved anxiety at my appearance, she knew nothing whatever that could
bear upon the incident i had there ready for her. i had not

pain, and i had more pains than one. i was in receipt in these days of
disturbing letters from home, where things were not going well. but with
my children, what things in the world mattered? that was the question
i used to put to my scrappy retirements. i was dazzled by their
loveliness.

there was a sunday--to get on--when it rained with such force and for so
many hours that there could be no procession to church; in consequence
of which, as the day declined, i had arranged with mrs. grose that,
should the evening show improvement, we would attend together the late
service. the rain happily stopped, and i prepared for our walk, which,
through the park and by the good road to the village, would be a matter
of twenty minutes. coming downstairs to meet my colleague in the hall,
i remembered a pair of gloves that had required three stitches and that
had received them--with a publicity perhaps not edifying--while i sat
with the children at their tea, served on sundays, by exception, i

shrubberies and big trees, but i remember the clear assurance i felt
that none of them concealed him. he was there or was not there: not
there if i didnâ€™t see him. i got hold of this; then, instinctively,
instead of returning as i had come, went to the window. it was
confusedly present to me that i ought to place myself where he had
stood. i did so; i applied my face to the pane and looked, as he had
looked, into the room. as if, at this moment, to show me exactly what
his range had been, mrs. grose, as i had done for himself just before,
came in from the hall. with this i had the full image of a repetition of
what had already occurred. she saw me as i had seen my own visitant; she
pulled up short as i had done; i gave her something of the shock that
i had received. she turned white, and this made me ask myself if i had
blanched as much. she stared, in short, and retreated on just my lines,
and i knew she had then passed out and come round to me and that i
should presently meet her. i rema

oh, she let me know as soon as, round the corner of the house, she
loomed again into view. â€œwhat in the name of goodness is the matter--?â€
 she was now flushed and out of breath.

i said nothing till she came quite near. â€œwith me?â€ i must have made a
wonderful face. â€œdo i show it?â€

â€œyouâ€™re as white as a sheet. you look awful.â€

i considered; i could meet on this, without scruple, any innocence. my
need to respect the bloom of mrs. groseâ€™s had dropped, without a rustle,
from my shoulders, and if i wavered for the instant it was not with what
i kept back. i put out my hand to her and she took it; i held her hard
a little, liking to feel her close to me. there was a kind of support in
the shy heave of her surprise. â€œyou came for me for church, of course,
but i canâ€™t go.â€

â€œhas anything happened?â€

â€œyes. you must know now. did i look very queer?â€

â€œthrough this window? dreadful!â€

â€œwell,â€ i said, â€œiâ€™ve

plainly that she had no wish to be, yet also that she knew too well her
place not to be ready to share with me any marked inconvenience. oh,
it was quite settled that she must share! â€œjust what you saw from the
dining room a minute ago was the effect of that. what _i_ saw--just
before--was much worse.â€

her hand tightened. â€œwhat was it?â€

â€œan extraordinary man. looking in.â€

â€œwhat extraordinary man?â€

â€œi havenâ€™t the least idea.â€

â€œi know still less.â€

â€œhave you seen him before?â€

â€œyes--once. on the old tower.â€

she could only look at me harder. â€œdo you mean heâ€™s a stranger?â€

â€œoh, very much!â€

â€œyet you didnâ€™t tell me?â€

â€œno--for reasons. but now that youâ€™ve guessed--â€

mrs. groseâ€™s round eyes encountered this charge. â€œah, i havenâ€™t
guessed!â€ she said very simply. â€œhow can i if you donâ€™t imagine?â€

â€œi donâ€™t in the very least.â€

â€œyouâ€™ve seen him nowhere but on the tower?â€

â€œand on this spot just now.â€

mrs. grose looked round again. â€œwhat was he doing on the tower?â€

â€œonly standing there and looking down at me.â€

she thought a minute. â€œwas he a gentleman?â€

i found i had no need to think. â€œno.â€ she gazed in deeper wonder. â€œn

o.â€

â€œthen nobody about the place? nobody from the village?â€

â€œnobody--nobody. i didnâ€™t tell you, but i made sure.â€

she breathed a vague relief: this was, oddly, so much to the good. it
only went indeed a little way. â€œbut if he isnâ€™t a gentleman--â€

â€œwhat is he? heâ€™s a horror.â€

â€œa horror?â€

â€œheâ€™s--god help me if i know what he is!â€

mrs. grose looked round once more; she fixed her eyes on the duskier
distance, then, pulling herself together, turned to me with abrupt
inconsequence. â€œitâ€™s time we should be at church.â€

â€œoh, iâ€™m not fit for church!â€

â€œwonâ€™t it do you good?â€

â€œit wonâ€™t do them--! i nodded at the house.

â€œthe children?â€

â€œi canâ€™t leave them now.â€

â€œyouâ€™re afraid--?â€

i spoke boldly. â€œiâ€™m afraid of him.â€

ay faint glimmer of a consciousness more acute: i somehow made out
in it the delayed dawn of an idea i myself had not given her and that
was as yet quite obscure to me. it comes back to me that i thought
instantly of this as something i could get from her; and i felt it to be
connected with the desire she presently showed to know more. â€œwhen was
it--on the tower?â€

â€œabout the middle of the month. at this same hour.â€

â€œalmost at dark,â€ said mrs. grose.

â€œoh, no, not nearly. i saw him as i see you.â€

â€œthen how did he get in?â€

â€œand how did he get out?â€ i laughed. â€œi had no opportunity to ask him!
this evening, you see,â€ i pursued, â€œhe has not been able to get in.â€

â€œhe only peeps?â€

â€œi hope it will be confined to that!â€ she had now let go my hand; she
turned away a little. i waited an instant; then i brought out: â€œgo to
church. goodbye. i must watch.â€

slowly she faced me again. â€œdo you fear for them?â€

nearer to the window and, for a minute, applied her face to the glass.
â€œyou see how he could see,â€ i meanwhile went on.

she didnâ€™t move. â€œhow long was he here?â€

â€œtill i came out. i came to meet him.â€

mrs. grose at last turned round, and there was still more in her face.
â€œ_i_ couldnâ€™t have come out.â€

â€œneither could i!â€ i laughed again. â€œbut i did come. i have my duty.â€

â€œso have i mine,â€ she replied; after which she added: â€œwhat is he like?â€

â€œiâ€™ve been dying to tell you. but heâ€™s like nobody.â€

â€œnobody?â€ she echoed.

â€œhe has no hat.â€ then seeing in her face that she already, in this, with
a deeper dismay, found a touch of picture, i quickly added stroke to

ome time to be wholly
sure of what my honest ally was prepared for to keep terms with so
compromising a contract. i was queer company enough--quite as queer as
the company i received; but as i trace over what we went through i see
how much common ground we must have found in the one idea that, by good
fortune, could steady us. it was the idea, the second movement, that led
me straight out, as i may say, of the inner chamber of my dread. i could
take the air in the court, at least, and there mrs. grose could join me.
perfectly can i recall now the particular way strength came to me before
we separated for the night. we had gone over and over every feature of
what i had seen.

â€œhe was looking for someone else, you say--someone who was not you?â€

â€œhe was looking for little miles.â€ a portentous clearness now possessed
me. â€œthatâ€™s whom he was looking for.â€

â€œbut how do you know?â€

proving. i had an absolute certainty that i should see again what i
had already seen, but something within me said that by offering myself
bravely as the sole subject of such experience, by accepting, by
inviting, by surmounting it all, i should serve as an expiatory victim
and guard the tranquility of my companions. the children, in especial,
i should thus fence about and absolutely save. i recall one of the last
things i said that night to mrs. grose.

â€œit does strike me that my pupils have never mentioned--â€

she looked at me hard as i musingly pulled up. â€œhis having been here and
the time they were with him?â€

â€œthe time they were with him, and his name, his presence, his history,
in any way.â€

â€œoh, the little lady doesnâ€™t remember. she never heard or knew.â€

â€œthe circumstances of his death?â€ i thought with some intensity.
â€œperhaps not. but miles would remember--miles would know.â€

â€œah, donâ€™t try him!â€ broke

i returned her the look she had given me. â€œdonâ€™t be afraid.â€ i continued
to think. â€œit is rather odd.â€

â€œthat he has never spoken of him?â€

â€œnever by the least allusion. and you tell me they were â€˜great
friendsâ€™?â€

â€œoh, it wasnâ€™t him!â€ mrs. grose with emphasis declared. â€œit was quintâ€™s
own fancy. to play with him, i mean--to spoil him.â€ she paused a moment;
then she added: â€œquint was much too free.â€

this gave me, straight from my vision of his face--such a face!--a
sudden sickness of disgust. â€œtoo free with my boy?â€

â€œtoo free with everyone!â€

the reflection that a part of it applied to several of the members of
the household, of the half-dozen mai

â€œno. i couldnâ€™t--and i canâ€™t now!â€ and the poor woman burst into tears.

a rigid control, from the next day, was, as i have said, to follow them;
yet how often and how passionately, for a week, we came back together
to the subject! much as we had discussed it that sunday night, i was, in
the immediate later hours in especial--for it may be imagined whether i
slept--still haunted with the shadow of something she had not told me.
i myself had kept back nothing, but there was a word mrs. grose had kept
back. i was sure, moreover, by morning, that this was not from a failure
of frankness, but because on every side there were fears. it seems to me
indeed, in retrospect, that by the time the morrowâ€™s sun was high i had
restlessly read into the fact before us almost all the meaning they were
to receive from subsequent and more cruel occurrences. what they gave me
above all was just the sinister figure of the living man--the dead one
would keep awhile!--and of the months he had continuo

have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea
of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make
the thing a boat. this second morsel, as i watched her, she was
very markedly and intently attempting to tighten in its place. my
apprehension of what she was doing sustained me so that after some
seconds i felt i was ready for more. then i again shifted my eyes--i
faced what i had to face.

i got hold of mrs. grose as soon after this as i could; and i can give
no intelligible account of how i fought out the interval. yet i still
hear myself cry as i fairly threw myself into her arms: â€œthey know--itâ€™s
too monstrous: they know, they know!â€

â€œand what on earth--?â€ i felt her incredulity as she held me.

â€œwhy, all that we know--and heaven knows what else besides!â€ then, as
she released me, i made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now with
full coherency even to myself. â€œtwo hours ago, in

scarce articulate--â€œflora saw!â€

mrs. grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. â€œshe
has told you?â€ she panted.

â€œnot a word--thatâ€™s the horror. she kept it to herself! the child of
eight, that child!â€ unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of
it.

mrs. grose, of course, could only gape the wider. â€œthen how do you
know?â€

â€œi was there--i saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.â€

â€œdo you mean aware of him?â€

â€œno--of her.â€ i was conscious as i spoke that i looked prodigious
things, for i got the slow reflection of them in my companionâ€™s face.
â€œanother person--this time; but a figure of quite as unmistakable horror
and evil: a woman in black, pale and dreadful--with such an air also,
and such a face!--on the other side o

had thought it all out: â€œmy predecessor--the one who died.â€

â€œmiss jessel?â€

â€œmiss jessel. you donâ€™t believe me?â€ i pressed.

she turned right and left in her distress. â€œhow can you be sure?â€

this drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience.
â€œthen ask flora--sheâ€™s sure!â€ but i had no sooner spoken than i caught
myself up. â€œno, for godâ€™s sake, donâ€™t! sheâ€™ll say she isnâ€™t--sheâ€™ll
lie!â€

mrs. grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. â€œah, how can
you?â€

â€œbecause iâ€™m clear. flora doesnâ€™t want me to know.â€

â€œitâ€™s only then to spare you.â€

â€œno, no--there are depths, depths! the more i go over it, the more i see
in it, and the more i see in it, the more i fear. i donâ€™t know what i
donâ€™t see--what i donâ€™t fear!â€

mrs. grose tried to keep up with me. â€œyou mean youâ€™re afraid of seeing
her again?â€

â€œoh, no; thatâ€™s nothing--now!â€ then i explaine
 
 ___________________________
 
d. â€œitâ€™s of not seeing
her.â€

but my companion only looked wan. â€œi donâ€™t understand you.â€

â€œwhy, itâ€™s that the child may keep it up--and that the child assuredly
will--without my knowing it.â€

at the image of this possibility mrs. grose for a moment collapsed, yet
presently to pull herself together again, as if from the positive force
of the sense of what, should we yield an inch, there would really be to
give way to. â€œdear, dear--we must keep our heads! and after all, if she
doesnâ€™t mind it--!â€ she even tried a grim joke. â€œperhaps she likes it!â€

â€œlikes such things--a scrap of an infant!â€

â€œisnâ€™t it just a proof of her blessed innocence?â€ my friend bravely
inquired.

she brought me, for the instant, almost

 round. â€œoh, we must clutch at
that--we must cling to it! if it isnâ€™t a proof of what you say, itâ€™s a
proof of--god knows what! for the womanâ€™s a horror of horrors.â€

mrs. grose, at this, fixed her eyes a minute on the ground; then at last
raising them, â€œtell me how you know,â€ she said.

â€œthen you admit itâ€™s what she was?â€ i cried.

â€œtell me how you know,â€ my friend simply repeated.

â€œknow? by seeing her! by the way she looked.â€

â€œat you, do you mean--so wickedly?â€

â€œdear me, no--i could have borne that. she gave me never a glance. she
only fixed the child.â€

mrs. grose tried to see it. â€œfixed her?â€

â€œah, with such awful eyes!â€

she st

ared at mine as if they might really have resembled them. â€œdo you
mean of dislike?â€

â€œgod help us, no. of something much worse.â€

â€œworse than dislike?--this left her indeed at a loss.

â€œwith a determination--indescribable. with a kind of fury of intention.â€

i made her turn pale. â€œintention?â€

â€œto get hold of her.â€ mrs. grose--her eyes just lingering on mine--gave
a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking
out i completed my statement. â€œthatâ€™s what flora knows.â€

after a little she turned round. â€œthe person was in black, you say?â€

â€œin mourning--rather poor, almost shabby. but--yes--with extraordinary
beauty.â€ i now recognized to what i had at last, stroke by stroke,
brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed
this. â€œoh, handsome--very, very,â€ i ins

en; but the time has
certainly come to give me the whole thing.â€ she appeared to assent to
this, but still only in silence; seeing which i went on: â€œi must have it
now. of what did she die? come, there was something between them.â€

â€œthere was everything.â€

â€œin spite of the difference--?â€

â€œoh, of their rank, their conditionâ€--she brought it woefully out. â€œshe
was a lady.â€

i turned it over; i again saw. â€œyes--she was a lady.â€

â€œand he so dreadfully below,â€ said mrs. grose.

i felt that i doubtless neednâ€™t press too hard, in such company, on the
place of a servant in the scale; but there was nothing to prevent an
acceptance of my companionâ€™s own measure of my predecessorâ€™s abasement.
there was a way to deal with that, and i dealt; the more readily for
my full vision--on the evidence--of our employerâ€™s late clever,
good-looking â€œownâ€ man; impudent, assured, spoiled, depraved. â€œthe
fellow was a hound.â€

mrs. grose considered as if it were perhaps a

little a case for a sense
of shades. â€œiâ€™ve never seen one like him. he did what he wished.â€

â€œwith her?â€

â€œwith them all.â€

it was as if now in my friendâ€™s own eyes miss jessel had again appeared.
i seemed at any rate, for an instant, to see their evocation of her
as distinctly as i had seen her by the pond; and i brought out with
decision: â€œit must have been also what she wished!â€

mrs. groseâ€™s face signified that it had been indeed, but she said at the
same time: â€œpoor woman--she paid for it!â€

â€œthen you do know what she died of?â€ i asked.

â€œno--i know nothing. i wanted not to know; i was glad enough i didnâ€™t;
and i thanked heaven she was well out of this!â€

â€œyet you had, then, your idea--â€

â€œof her real reason for leaving? oh, yes--as to that. she couldnâ€™t have
stayed. fancy it here--for a governess! and afterward i imagined--and i
still imagine. and what i
 
 ___________________________
 
 must have shown
her--as i was indeed but too conscious--a front of miserable defeat. it
brought out again all her compassion for me, and at the renewed touch of
her kindness my power to resist broke down. i burst, as i had, the other
time, made her burst, into tears; she took me to her motherly breast,
and my lamentation overflowed. â€œi donâ€™t do it!â€ i sobbed in despair; â€œi
donâ€™t save or shield them! itâ€™s far worse than i dreamed--theyâ€™re lost!â€

what i had said to mrs. grose was true enough: there were in the matter
i had put before her depths and possibilities that i lacked resolution
to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a
common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. we were
to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else--difficult indeed as
that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was
least to be questioned. late that night, while the house slept, we had
another talk in my room, when

had
supposed i had brushed away the ugly signs: but i could literally--for
the time, at all events--rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that
they had not entirely disappeared. to gaze into the depths of blue of
the childâ€™s eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature
cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which i
naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my
agitation. i couldnâ€™t abjure for merely wanting to, but i could repeat
to mrs. grose--as i did there, over and over, in the small hours--that
with their voices in the air, their pressure on oneâ€™s heart, and their
fragrant faces against oneâ€™s cheek, everything fell to the ground but
their incapacity and their beauty. it was a pity that, somehow, to
settle this once for all, i had equally to re-enumerate the signs of
subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my
show of self-possession. it was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate
the certitude of the

moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as
a revelation that the inconceivable communion i then surprised was a
matter, for either party, of habit. it was a pity that i should have had
to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion,
so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as i
actually saw mrs. grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as
she did thus see, to make me suppose she didnâ€™t, and at the same time,
without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether i myself did!
it was a pity that i needed once more to describe the portentous little
activity by which she sought to divert my attention--the perceptible
increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the
gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.

yet if i had not indulged, to prove there w

me. â€œi was sure, at any rate,â€ she added, â€œthat he didnâ€™t. but he denied
certain occasions.â€

â€œwhat occasions?â€

â€œwhen they had been about together quite as if quint were his tutor--and
a very grand one--and miss jessel only for the little lady. when he had
gone off with the fellow, i mean, and spent hours with him.â€

â€œhe then prevaricated about it--he said he hadnâ€™t?â€ her assent was clear
enough to cause me to add in a moment: â€œi see. he lied.â€

â€œoh!â€ mrs. grose mumbled. this was a suggestion that it didnâ€™t matter;
which indeed she backed up by a further remark. â€œyou see, after all,
miss jessel didnâ€™t mind. she didnâ€™t forbid him.â€

i considered. â€œdid he put that to you as a justification?â€

at this she dropped again. â€œno, he never spoke of it.â€

â€œnever mentioned her in connection with quint?â€

she saw, visibly flushing, where i was coming out. â€œwell, he didnâ€™t show
anything. he denied,â€ she repeated; â€œhe denied.â€

my aid, to flounder about in silence, most of all made you miserable.
but i shall get it out of you yet! there was something in the boy that

relation.â€

â€œoh, he couldnâ€™t prevent--â€

â€œyour learning the truth? i daresay! but, heavens,â€ i fell, with
vehemence, athinking, â€œwhat it shows that they must, to that extent,
have succeeded in making of him!â€

â€œah, nothing thatâ€™s not nice now!â€ mrs. grose lugubriously pleaded.

â€œi donâ€™t wonder you looked queer,â€ i persisted, â€œwhen i mentioned to you
the letter from his school!â€

â€œi doubt if i looked as queer as you!â€ she retorted with homely force.
â€œand if he was so bad then as that comes to, how is he such an angel
now?â€

â€œyes, indeed--and if he was a fiend at school! how, how, how? well,â€
 i said in my torment, â€œyou must put it to me again, but i shall not be
able to tell you for some days. only, put it to me again!â€

oddest amusement. then i went on: â€œat all events, while he was with the
man--â€

â€œmiss flora was with the woman. it suited them all!â€

it suited me, too, i felt, only too well; by which i mean that it suited
exactly the particularly deadly view i was in the very act of forbidding
myself to entertain. but i so far succeeded in checking the expression
of this view that i will throw, just here, no further light on it than
may be offered by the mention of my final observation to mrs. grose.
â€œhis having lied and been impudent are, i confess, less engaging
specimens than i had hoped to have from you of the outbreak in him of
the little natural man. still,â€ i mused, â€œthey must do, for they make me
feel more than ever that i must watch.â€

it made me blush, the next minute, to see in my friendâ€™s face how much
more unreservedly she had forgiven him than her anecdote struck me as
presenting to my own tenderness an occasion for doing. this came out
when, at the schoolroom door,

there were empty rooms at bly, and it was only a question of choosing
the right one. the right one suddenly presented itself to me as the
lower one--though high above the gardens--in the solid corner of the
house that i have spoken of as the old tower. this was a large, square
chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extravagant size of
which made it so inconvenient that it had not for years, though kept by
mrs. grose in exemplary order, been occupied. i had often admired it and
i knew my way about in it; i had only, after just faltering at the first
chill gloom of its disuse, to pass across it and unbolt as quietly as i
could one of the shutters. achieving this transit, i uncovered the
glass without a sound and, applying my face to the pane, was able, the
darkness without being much less than within, to see that i commanded
the right direction. then i saw something more. the moon made the

ood there motionless and as if fascinated,
looking up to where i had appeared--looking, that is, not so much
straight at me as at something that was apparently above me. there was
clearly another person above me--there was a person on the tower; but
the presence on the lawn was not in the least what i had conceived and
had confidently hurried to meet. the presence on the lawn--i felt sick
as i made it out--was poor little miles himself.

it was not till late next day that i spoke to mrs. grose; the rigor with
which i kept my pupils in sight making it often difficult to meet
her privately, and the more as we each felt the importance of not
provoking--on the part of the servants quite as much as on that of the
children--any suspicion of a secret flurry or that of a discussion of
mysteries. i drew a great security in this particular from her mere
smooth aspect. there was nothing in her fresh face to pass on to others
my horrible confidences. she believed me, i was sure, absolutely: if s

at the hour i now speak of she had joined me, under pressure, on the
terrace, where, with the lapse of the season, the afternoon sun was now
agreeable; and we sat there together while, before us, at a distance,
but within call if we wished, the children strolled to and fro in one
of their most manageable moods. they moved slowly, in unison, below us,
over the lawn, the boy, as they went, reading aloud from a storybook and
passing his arm round his sister to keep her quite in touch. mrs. grose
watched them with positive placidity; then i caught the suppressed
intellectual creak with which she conscientiously turned to take from me
a view of the back of the tapestry. i had made her a receptacle of
lurid things, but there was an odd recognition of my superiority--my
accomplishments and my function--in her patience under my pain. she
offered her mind to my disclosures as, had i wished to mix a witchâ€™s
broth and proposed it with assurance, she would have held out a large

old tradition of the criminality of those caretakers of the young who
minister to superstitions and fears. he â€œhadâ€ me indeed, and in a cleft
stick; for who would ever absolve me, who would consent that i should go
unhung, if, by the faintest tremor of an overture, i were the first to
introduce into our perfect intercourse an element so dire? no, no: it
was useless to attempt to convey to mrs. grose, just as it is scarcely
less so to attempt to suggest here, how, in our short, stiff brush in
the dark, he fairly shook me with admiration. i was of course thoroughly
kind and merciful; never, never yet had i placed on his little shoulders
hands of such tenderness as those with which, while i rested against the
bed, i held him there well under fire. i had no alternative but, in form
at least, to put it to him.

he literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly
to assent. â€œhow otherwise should i have been bad enough?â€ he asked.
then, after another embrace, the incident and our interview closed on my
recognition of all the reserves of goodness that, for his joke, he had
been able to draw upon.

the particular impression i had received proved in the morning light,
i repeat, not quite successfully presentable to mrs. grose, though i
reinforced it with the mention of still another remark that he had made
before we separated. â€œit all lies in half a dozen words,â€ i said to her,
â€œwords that really settle the matter. â€˜think, you know, what i might
do!â€™ he threw that off to show me how good he is. he knows down to
the ground what he â€˜mightâ€™ do. thatâ€™s what he gave them a taste of at
school.â€

â€œlord, you do change!â€ cried my friend.

â€œi donâ€™t change--i simply make it out. the four, depend upon

lovely babies? yes, mad as that seems!â€ the very act of
bringing it out really helped me to trace it--follow it all up and piece
it all together. â€œthey havenâ€™t been good--theyâ€™ve only been absent. it
has been easy to live with them, because theyâ€™re simply leading a
life of their own. theyâ€™re not mine--theyâ€™re not ours. theyâ€™re his and
theyâ€™re hers!â€

â€œquintâ€™s and that womanâ€™s?â€

â€œquintâ€™s and that womanâ€™s. they want to get to them.â€

oh, how, at this, poor mrs. grose appeared to study them! â€œbut for
what?â€

â€œfor the love of all the evil that, in those dreadful days, the pair put
into them. and to ply them with that evil still, to keep up the work of
demons, is what brings the others back.â€

â€œlaws!â€ said my friend under her breath. the exclamation was homely, but
it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the bad
time--for there had been a worse even than this!--must have occurred.
there could have been no such justification fo

as it were, and beyond--in strange places and on high places, the top of
towers, the roof of houses, the outside of windows, the further edge

distance and overcome the obstacle; and the success of the tempters is
only a question of time. theyâ€™ve only to keep to their suggestions of
danger.â€

â€œfor the children to come?â€

â€œand perish in the attempt!â€ mrs. grose slowly got up, and i
scrupulously added: â€œunless, of course, we can prevent!â€

standing there before me while i kept my seat, she visibly turned things
over. â€œtheir uncle must do the preventing. he must take them away.â€

â€œand whoâ€™s to make him?â€

she had been scanning the distance, but she now dropped on me a foolish
face. â€œyou, miss.â€

â€œby writing to him that his house is poisoned and his little nephew and
niece mad?â€

â€œbut if they are, miss?â€

mrs. grose considered, following the children again. â€œyes, he do hate
worry. that was the great reason--â€

â€œwhy those fiends took him in so long? no doubt, though his indifference
must have been awful. as iâ€™m not a fiend, at any rate, i shouldnâ€™t take
him in.â€

my companion, after an instant and for all answer, sat down again and
grasped my arm. â€œmake him at any rate come to you.â€

i stared. â€œto me?â€ i had a sudden fear of what she might do. â€œâ€˜himâ€™?â€

evening out of doors, i had had my first sight of quint, and in which,
too, at those other instants, i had, after seeing him through the
window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. i recognized
the signs, the portents--i recognized the moment, the spot. but they
remained unaccompanied and empty, and i continued unmolested; if
unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had, in the
most extraordinary fashion, not declined but deepened. i had said in my
talk with mrs. grose on that horrid scene of floraâ€™s by the lake--and
had perplexed her by so saying--that it would from that moment distress
me much more to lose my power than to keep it. i had then expressed what
was vividly in my mind: the truth that, whether the children really
saw or not--since, that is, it was not yet definitely proved--i greatly
preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. i was ready
to know the very worst that was to be known. what i had then had an ugly
glimpse of was tha

suffocation. it was at least change, and it came with a rush.

walking to church a certain sunday morning, i had little miles at my
side and his sister, in advance of us and at mrs. groseâ€™s, well in
sight. it was a crisp, clear day, the first of its order for some time;
the night had brought a touch of frost, and the autumn air, bright
and sharp, made the church bells almost gay. it was an odd accident of
thought that i should have happened at such a moment to be particularly
and very gratefully struck with the obedience of my little charges. why
did they never resent my inexorable, my perpetual society? something or
other had brought nearer home to me that i had all but pinne

nd forward. â€œthere are not many of your own
sort, miles!â€ i laughed. â€œunless perhaps dear little flora!â€

â€œyou really compare me to a baby girl?â€

this found me singularly weak. â€œdonâ€™t you, then, love our sweet flora?â€

â€œif i didnâ€™t--and you, too; if i didnâ€™t--!â€ he repeated as if retreating
for a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had
come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the pressure
of his arm, had become inevitable. mrs. grose and flora had passed into
the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we were, for the
minute, alone among the old, thick graves. we had paused, on the path
from the gate, by a low, oblong, tablelike tomb.

â€œyes, if you didnâ€™t--?â€

he looked, while i waited, at the graves. â€œwell, you know what!â€ but
he didnâ€™t move, and he presently produced something that made me drop
straight down on the stone slab, as if suddenly to rest. â€œdoes my uncle
think what you think?â€

nothing in the room the next minute but the sunshine and a sense that i
must stay.

i had so perfectly expected that the return of my pupils would be marked
by a demonstration that i was freshly upset at having to take into
account that they were dumb about my absence. instead of gaily
denouncing and caressing me, they made no allusion to my having failed
them, and i was left, for the time, on perceiving that she too said
nothing, to study mrs. groseâ€™s odd face. i did this to such purpose that
i made sure they had in some way bribed her to silence; a silence that,
however, i would engage to break down on the first private opportunity.
this opportunity came before tea: i secured five minutes with her in the
housekeeperâ€™s room, where, in the twilight, amid a smell of lately baked
bread, but with the place all swept and garnished, i found her sitting
in pained placidity before the fire. so i see her still, so i see her
best: facing the fla

â€œmiss flora was too sweet. she said, â€˜oh, of course, of course!â€™--and i
said the same.â€

i thought a moment. â€œyou were too sweet, too--i can hear you all. but
nonetheless, between miles and me, itâ€™s now all out.â€

â€œall out?â€ my companion stared. â€œbut what, miss?â€

â€œeverything. it doesnâ€™t matter. iâ€™ve made up my mind. i came home, my
dear,â€ i went on, â€œfor a talk with miss jessel.â€

i had by this time formed the habit of having mrs. grose literally well
in hand in advance of my sounding that note; so that even now, as
she bravely blinked under the signal of my word, i could keep her
comparatively firm. â€œa talk! do you mean she spoke?â€

â€œit came to that. i found her, on my return, in the schoolroom.â€

â€œand what did she say?â€ i can hear the good woman still, and the candor
of her stupefaction.

â€œthat she suffers the torments--!â€

it was this, of a truth, that made her, as she filled out my picture,
gape. â€œdo you

â€œof the lost. of the damned. and thatâ€™s why, to share them-â€ i faltered
myself with the horror of it.

but my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. â€œto share them--?â€

â€œshe wants flora.â€ mrs. grose might, as i gave it to her, fairly have
fallen away from me had i not been prepared. i still held her there, to
show i was. â€œas iâ€™ve told you, however, it doesnâ€™t matter.â€

â€œbecause youâ€™ve made up your mind? but to what?â€

â€œto everything.â€

â€œand what do you call â€˜everythingâ€™?â€

â€œwhy, sending for their uncle.â€

â€œoh, miss, in pity do,â€ my friend broke out. â€œah, but i will, i will! i
see itâ€™s the only way. whatâ€™s â€˜out,â€™ as i told you, with miles is that

the spot (and before the boy himself, if necessary) that if iâ€™m to be
reproached with having done nothing again about more school--â€

â€œyes, miss--â€ my companion pressed me.

â€œwell, thereâ€™s that awful reason.â€

there were now clearly so many of these for my poor colleague that she
was excusable for being vague. â€œbut--a--which?â€

â€œwhy, the letter from his old place.â€

â€œyouâ€™ll show it to the master?â€

â€œi ought to have done so on the instant.â€

â€œoh, no!â€ said mrs. grose with decision.

â€œiâ€™ll put it before him,â€ i went on inexorably, â€œthat i canâ€™t undertake
to work the question on behalf of a child who has been expelled--â€

â€œfor weâ€™ve never in the least known what!â€ mrs. grose declared.

â€œfor wickedness. for what else--when heâ€™s so clever and beautiful and
perfect? is he stupid? is he untidy? is he infirm? is he ill-natured?
heâ€™s exquisite--so it can be only that; and that would open up the whole
thing. after all,â€ i said, â€œitâ€™s th

his voice tinkled out. â€œi say, you there--come in.â€ it was a gaiety in
the gloom!

i went in with my light and found him, in bed, very wide awake, but very
much at his ease. â€œwell, what are you up to?â€ he asked with a grace of
sociability in which it occurred to me that mrs. grose, had she been
present, might have looked in vain for proof that anything was â€œout.â€

i stood over him with my candle. â€œhow did you know i was there?â€

â€œwhy, of course i heard you. did you fancy you made no noise? youâ€™re
like a troop of cavalry!â€ he beautifully laughed.

â€œthen you werenâ€™t asleep?â€

â€œnot much! i lie awake and think.â€

i had put my candle, designedly, a short way off, and then, as he held
out his friendly old hand to me, had sat down on the edge of his bed.

boy gave a loud, high shriek, which, lost in the rest of the shock of
sound, might have seemed, indistinctly, though i was so close to him,
a note either of jubilation or of terror. i jumped to my feet again and
was conscious of darkness. so for a moment we remained, while i stared
about me and saw that the drawn curtains were unstirred and the window
tight. â€œwhy, the candleâ€™s out!â€ i then cried.

â€œit was i who blew it, dear!â€ said miles.

the next day, after lessons, mrs. grose found a moment to say to me
quietly: â€œhave you written, miss?â€

â€œyes--iâ€™ve written.â€ but i didnâ€™t add--for the hour--that my letter,
sealed and directed, was still in my pocket. there would be time enough
to send it before the messenger should go to the village. meanwhile
there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more
exemplary morning. it was exactly as if they had both had at heart to
gloss over any recent little friction. they performed the dizziest feats

rgotten. where, all this time, was flora? when i put the question to
miles, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say:
â€œwhy, my dear, how do _i_ know?â€--breaking moreover into a happy laugh
which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he
prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.

i went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before
going downstairs, i looked into several others. as she was nowhere
about she would surely be with mrs. grose, whom, in the comfort of that
theory, i accordingly proceeded in quest of. i found her where i had
found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with blank,
scared ignorance. she had only supposed that, after the repast, i had
carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right,
for it was the very first time i had allowed the little girl out of my
sight without some special provision. of course now indeed she might be
with the maids, so that the immediate thing

 our arrangement, we met in the hall,
it was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we
had altogether failed to trace her. for a minute there, apart from
observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and i could feel with what high
interest my friend returned me all those i had from the first given her.

â€œsheâ€™ll be above,â€ she presently said--â€œin one of the rooms you havenâ€™t
searched.â€

â€œno; sheâ€™s at a distance.â€ i had made up my mind. â€œshe has gone out.â€

mrs. grose stared. â€œwithout a hat?â€

i naturally also looked volumes. â€œisnâ€™t that woman always without one?â€

â€œsheâ€™s with her?â€

â€œsheâ€™s with her!â€ i declared. â€œwe must find them.â€

my hand was on my friendâ€™s arm, but she failed for the moment,
confronted with such an account of the matter, to respond to my
pressure. she communed, on the contrary, on the spot, with her
uneasiness. â€œand whereâ€™s master miles?â€

â€œoh, heâ€™s with quint. theyâ€™re in the schoolroom.â€

tone--had never yet reached so calm an assurance.

â€œthe trickâ€™s played,â€ i went on; â€œtheyâ€™ve successfully worked their
plan. he found the most divine little way to keep me quiet while she
went off.â€

â€œâ€˜divineâ€™?â€ mrs. grose bewilderedly echoed.

â€œinfernal, then!â€ i almost cheerfully rejoined. â€œhe has provided for
himself as well. but come!â€

she had helplessly gloomed at the upper regions. â€œyou leave him--?â€

â€œso long with quint? yes--i donâ€™t mind that now.â€

she always ended, at these moments, by getting possession of my hand,
and in this manner she could at present still stay me. but after gasping
an instant at my sudden resignation, â€œbecause of your letter?â€ she
eagerly brought out.

 flat-bottomed boat moored
there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its
agitation. the usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the
house, but i had an intimate conviction that, wherever flora might
be, she was not near home. she had not given me the slip for any small
adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that i had shared
with her by the pond, i had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to
which she most inclined. this was why i had now given to mrs. groseâ€™s
steps so marked a direction--a direction that made her, when she
perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly
mystified. â€œyouâ€™re going to the water, miss?--you think sheâ€™s in--?â€

â€œshe may be, though the depth is, i believe, nowhere very great. but
what i judge most likely is that sheâ€™s on the spot from which, the other
day, we saw together what i told you.â€

â€œwhen she pretended not to see--?â€

â€œwith that astounding self-possession? iâ€™ve always been

mrs. grose still stood where she had stopped. â€œyou suppose they really
talk of them?â€

â€œi could meet this with a confidence! they say things that, if we heard
them, would simply appall us.â€

â€œand if she is there--â€

â€œyes?â€

â€œthen miss jessel is?â€

â€œbeyond a doubt. you shall see.â€

â€œoh, thank you!â€ my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, i
went straight on without her. by the time i reached the pool, however,
she was close behind me, and i knew that, whatever, to he

™s eyes. i knew what she meant and i replied with a negative
headshake.

â€œno, no; wait! she has taken the boat.â€

my companion stared at the vacant mooring place and then again across
the lake. â€œthen where is it?â€

â€œour not seeing it is the strongest of proofs. she has used it to go
over, and then has managed to hide it.â€

â€œall alone--that child?â€

â€œsheâ€™s not alone, and at such times sheâ€™s not a child: sheâ€™s an old,
old woman.â€ i scanned all the visible shore while mrs. grose took again,
into the queer element i offered her, one of her plunges of submission;
then i pointed out that the boat might perfectly be in a small refuge
formed by one of the recesses of the pool, an indentation masked, for
the hither side, by a projection of the bank and by a clump of trees
growing close to the water.

â€œbut if the boatâ€™s there, where on earthâ€™s she?â€ my colleague anxiously
asked.

â€œthatâ€™s exactly what we must learn.â€ and i started to walk further.

her performance was now complete. the next thing she did, however, was
to stoop straight down and pluck--quite as if it were all she was there
for--a big, ugly spray of withered fern. i instantly became sure she
had just come out of the copse. she waited for us, not herself taking a
step, and i was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently
approached her. she smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done
in a silence by this time flagrantly ominous. mrs. grose was the first
to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the
child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,
yielding body. while this dumb convulsion lasted i could only watch
it--which i did the more intently when i saw floraâ€™s face peep at me
over our companionâ€™s shoulder. it was serious now--the flicker had left
it; but it strengthened the pang with which i at that moment envied mrs.
grose the simplicity of her relation. still, all this while, noth

more passed between us save that flora had let her foolish fern again
drop to the ground. what she and i had virtually said to each other was
that pretexts were useless now. when mrs. grose finally got up she kept
the childâ€™s hand, so that the two were still before me; and the singular
reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she
launched me. â€œiâ€™ll be hanged,â€ it said, â€œif _i_â€˜ll speak!â€

it was flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first.
she was struck with our bareheaded aspect. â€œwhy, where are your things?â€

â€œwhere yours are, my dear!â€ i promptly returned.

she had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to tak

answer quite sufficient. â€œand whereâ€™s miles?â€ she went on.

there was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me:
these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn
blade, the jostle of the cup that my hand, for weeks and weeks, had
held high and full to the brim that now, even before speaking, i felt
overflow in a deluge. â€œiâ€™ll tell you if youâ€™ll tell me--â€ i heard myself
say, then heard the tremor in which it broke.

â€œwell, what?â€

mrs. groseâ€™s suspense blazed at me, but it was too late now, and i
brought the thing out handsomely. â€œwhere, my pet, is miss jessel?â€

just as in the churchyard with miles, the whole thing was upon us. much
as i had made of the fact that this name had never once, between us,
been sounded, the quick, smitten glare with which the childâ€™s face now
received it fairly likened my breach of the silence to the smash of a
pane of glass. it added to the interposing cry, as if to stay the blow,
that

mrs. grose, at the same instant, uttered over my violence--the
shriek of a creature scared, or rather wounded, which, in turn, within a
few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. i seized my colleagueâ€™s
arm. â€œsheâ€™s there, sheâ€™s there!â€

miss jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had
stood the other time, and i remember, strangely, as the first feeling
now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. she
was there, and i was justified; she was there, an

nor mad. she was there for poor scared mrs. grose, but she was there
most for flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so
extraordinary as that in which i consciously threw out to her--with
the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and
understand it--an inarticulate message of gratitude. she rose erect on
the spot my friend and i had lately quitted, and there was not, in all
the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. this

during which mrs. groseâ€™s dazed blink across to where i pointed struck
me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my
own eyes precipitately to the child. the revelation then of the manner
in which flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it
would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay
was of course not what i had expected. prepared and on her guard as our
pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and i
was therefore shaken, on the

and that appeared to read and accuse and judge me--this was a stroke
that somehow converted the little girl herself into the very presence
that could make me quail. i quailed even though my certitude that
she thoroughly saw was never greater than at that instant, and in the
immediate need to defend myself i called it passionately to witness.
â€œsheâ€™s there, you little unhappy thing--there, there, there, and you see
her as well as you see me!â€ i had said shortly before to mrs. grose
that she was not at these times a child, but an old, old woman, and that
description of her could not have been more strikingly confirmed than in
the way in which, for all answer to this, she simply showed me, without
a concession, an admission, of her eyes, a countenance of deeper and
deeper, of indeed suddenly quite fixed, reprobation. i was by this
time--if i can put the whole thing at all together--more appalled at
what i may properly call her manner than at anything else, though it was

ultaneously with this that i became aware of having mrs. grose
also, and very formidably, to reckon with. my elder companion, the next
moment, at any rate, blotted out everything but her own flushed face and
her loud, shocked protest, a burst of high disapproval. â€œwhat a dreadful
turn, to be sure, miss! where on earth do you see anything?â€

i could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the
hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted. it had already
lasted a minute, and it lasted while i continued, seizing my colleague,

her relief at her exemption--a sense, touching to me even then, that she
would have backed me up if she could. i might well have needed that, for
with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed
i felt my own situation horribly crumble, i felt--i saw--my livid
predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and i was conscious,
more than all, of what i should have from this instant to deal with in
the astounding little attitude of flora. into this attitude mrs. grose
immediately and violently entered, breaking, even while there pierced
through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph, into breathless
reassurance.

â€œshe isnâ€™t there, little lady, and nobodyâ€™s there--and you never see
nothing, my sweet! how can poor miss jessel--when poor miss jesselâ€™s
dead and buried? we know, donâ€™t we, love?â€--and she appealed, blundering
in, to the child. â€œitâ€™s all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke--and
weâ€™ll go home as fast as we can!â€

panion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of
propriety, and they were again, with mrs. grose on her feet, united, as
it were, in pained opposition to me. flora continued to fix me with
her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute i prayed god to
forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight
to our friendâ€™s dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly
failed, had quite vanished. iâ€™ve said it already--she was literally,
she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. â€œi donâ€™t
know what you mean. i see nobody. i see nothing.

 i never have. i think
youâ€™re cruel. i donâ€™t like you!â€ then, after this deliverance, which
might have been that of a vulgarly pert little girl in the street, she
hugged mrs. grose more closely and buried in her skirts the dreadful
little face. in this position she produced an almost furious wail. â€œtake
me away, take me away--oh, take me away from her!â€

â€œfrom me?â€ i panted.

â€œfrom you--from you!â€ she cried.

even mrs. grose looked across at me dismayed, while i had nothing to
do but communicate again with the figure that, on the opposite bank,
without a movement, as rigidly still as if catching, beyond the
interval, our voices, was as vividly there for my disaster as it was not
there for my service. the wretched child had spoken exactly as if she
had got from some outside source each of her stabbing little words, and
i could therefore, in the full despair of all i had to accept, but sadly
shake my head at her. â€œ

e day was almost done.
i got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, at the gray pool and
its blank, haunted edge, and then i took, back to the house, my dreary
and difficult course. when i reached the gate in the fence the boat,
to my surprise, was gone, so that i had a fresh reflection to make on
floraâ€™s extraordinary command of the situation. she passed that night,
by the most tacit, and i should add, were not the word so grotesque a
false note, the happiest of arrangements, with mrs. grose. i saw
neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous
compensation, i saw a great deal of miles. i saw--i can use no other
phrase--so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever
been. no evening i had passed at bly had the portentous quality of
this one; in spite of which--and in spite also of the deeper depths of
consternation that had opened beneath my feet--there was literally, in
the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness. on reaching the

â€œoh, i see her perfectly from here. she resents, for all the world like
some high little personage, the imputation on her truthfulness and,
as it were, her respectability. â€˜miss jessel indeed--she!â€™ ah, sheâ€™s
â€˜respectable,â€™ the chit! the impression she gave me there yesterday was,
i assure you, the very strangest of all; it was quite beyond any of the
others. i did put my foot in it! sheâ€™ll never speak to me again.â€

hideous and obscure as it all was, it held mrs. grose briefly silent;
then she granted my point with a frankness which, i made sure, had more
behind it. â€œi think indeed, miss, she never will. she do have a grand
manner about it!â€

â€œand that mannerâ€--i summed it up--â€œis practically whatâ€™s the matter
with her now!â€

oh, that manner, i could see in my visitorâ€™s face, and not a little else
besides! â€œshe asks me every three minutes if i think youâ€™re coming in.â€

â€œi see--i see.â€ i, too, on my side, had so much more than worked

i donâ€™t contradict her. what else can i do?â€

â€œnothing in the world! youâ€™ve the cleverest little person to deal with.
theyâ€™ve made them--their two friends, i mean--still cleverer even than
nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! flora has now her
grievance, and sheâ€™ll work it to the end.â€

â€œyes, miss; but to what end?â€

â€œwhy, that of dealing with me to her uncle. sheâ€™ll make me out to him
the lowest creature--!â€

i winced at the fair show of the scene in mrs. groseâ€™s face; she looked
for a minute as if she sharply saw them together. â€œand him who thinks so
well of you!â€

â€œhe has an odd way--it comes over me now,â€ i laughed,â€--of proving it!
but that doesnâ€™t matter. what flora wants, of course, is to get rid of
me.â€

my companion bravely concurred. â€œnever again to so much as look at you.â€

â€œso that what youâ€™ve come to me now for,â€ i asked, â€œis to speed me on my

â€œiâ€™m not sure of anything but you. but i have, since last evening, a new
hope. i think he wants to give me an opening. i do believe that--poor
little exquisite wretch!--he wants to speak. last evening, in the
firelight and the silence, he sat with me for two hours as if it were
just coming.â€

mrs. grose looked hard, through the window, at the gray, gathering day.
â€œand did it come?â€

â€œno, though i waited and waited, i confess it didnâ€™t, and it was without
a breach of the silence or so much as a faint allusion to his sisterâ€™s
condition and absence that we at last kissed for good night. all the
same,â€ i continued, â€œi canâ€™t, if her uncle sees her, consent to his
seeing her brother without my having given the boy--and most of all
because things have got so bad--a little more time.â€

yet it was when she had got off--and i missed her on the spot--that the
great pinch really came. if i had counted on what it would give me to
find myself alone with miles, i speedily perceived, at least, that it
would give me a measure. no hour of my stay in fact was so assailed
with apprehensions as that of my coming down to learn that the carriage
containing mrs. grose and my younger pupil had already rolled out of the
gates. now i was, i said to myself, face to face with the elements, and
for much of the rest of the day, while i fought my weakness, i could
consider that i had been supremely rash. it was a tighter place still
than i had yet turned round in; all the more that, for the first time,
i could see in the aspect of others a confused reflection of the crisis.
what had happened naturally caused them all to stare; there was too
little of the explained,

lace in our relation as a consequence of his having at the
piano, the day before, kept me, in floraâ€™s interest, so beguiled and
befooled. the stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her
confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in
by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. he had
already disappeared when, on my way down, i pushed open his door, and
i learned below that he had breakfasted--in the presence of a couple of
the maids--with mrs. grose and his sister. he had then gone out, as he
said, for a stroll; than which nothing, i reflected, could better have
expressed his frank view of the abrupt transformation of my office. what
he would not permit this office to consist of was yet to be settled:
there was a queer relief, at all events--i mean for myself in
especial--in the renouncement of one pretension. if so much had sprung
to the surface, i scarce put it too strongly in saying that what had
perhaps sprung highest was the absurdity

yet when he at last arrived, the difficulty of applying them, the
accumulations of my problem, were brought straight home to me by the
beautiful little presence on which what had occurred had as yet, for the
eye, dropped neither stain nor shadow.

to mark, for the house, the high state i cultivated i decreed that my
meals with the boy should be served, as we called it, downstairs; so
that i had been awaiting him in the ponderous pomp of the room outside
of the window of which i had had from mrs. grose, that first scared
sunday, my flash of something it would scarce have done to call light.
here at present i felt afresh--for i had felt it again and again--how my
equilibrium depended on the success of my rigid will, the will to shut
my eyes as tight as possible to the truth that what i had to deal with
was, revoltingly, against nature. i could only get on at all by taking
â€œnatureâ€ into my confidence and my account, by treating my monstrous
ordeal as a push in a direction unusual, of course
