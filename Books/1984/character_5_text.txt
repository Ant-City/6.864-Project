een, deep underground, the lunch queue jerked
slowly forward. the room was already very full and deafeningly noisy. from
the grille at the counter the steam of stew came pouring forth, with a sour
metallic smell which did not quite overcome the fumes of victory gin. on
the far side of the room there was a small bar, a mere hole in the wall,
where gin could be bought at ten cents the large nip.

'just the man i was looking for,' said a voice at winston's back.

he turned round. it was his friend syme, who worked in the research
department. perhaps 'friend' was not exactly the right word. you did not
have friends nowadays, you had comrades: but there were some comrades whose
society was pleasanter than that of others. syme was a philologist, a
specialist in newspeak. indeed, he was one of the enormous team of experts
now engaged in compiling the eleventh edition of the newspeak dictionary.
he was a tiny creature, smaller than winston, with dark hair and large,
protuberant eyes, at once mourn

en a famine of them for months past.
at any given moment there was some necessary article which the party shops
were unable to supply. sometimes it was buttons, sometimes it was darning
wool, sometimes it was shoelaces; at present it was razor blades. you could
only get hold of them, if at all, by scrounging more or less furtively on
the 'free' market.

'i've been using the same blade for six weeks,' he added untruthfully.

the queue gave another jerk forward. as they halted he turned and faced
syme again. each of them took a greasy metal tray from a pile at the end
of the counter.

'did you go and see the prisoners hanged yesterday?' said syme.

'i was working,' said winston indifferently. 'i shall see it on the
flicks, i suppose.'

'a very inadequate substitute,' said syme.

his mocking eyes roved over winston's face. 'i know you,' the eyes seemed
to say, 'i see through you. i know very well why you didn't go to see
those prisoners hanged.' in an intellectual way, syme was venomously

uld talk with a disagreeable gloating satisfaction of
helicopter raids on enemy villages, and trials and confessions of
thought-criminals, the executions in the cellars of the ministry of love.
talking to him was largely a matter of getting him away from such subjects
and entangling him, if possible, in the technicalities of newspeak, on
which he was authoritative and interesting. winston turned his head a
little aside to avoid the scrutiny of the large dark eyes.

'it was a good hanging,' said syme reminiscently. 'i think it spoils it
when they tie their feet together. i like to see them kicking. and above
all, at the end, the tongue sticking right out, and blue--a quite bright
blue. that's the detail that appeals to me.'

'nex', please!' yelled the white-aproned prole with the ladle.

winston and syme pushed their trays beneath the grille. on to each was
dumped swiftly the regulation lunch--a metal pannikin of pinkish-grey stew,
a hunk of bread, a cube of cheese, a mug of milkless victor

y coffee, and
one saccharine tablet.

'there's a table over there, under that telescreen,' said syme. 'let's pick
up a gin on the way.'

the gin was served out to them in handleless china mugs. they threaded
their way across the crowded room and unpacked their trays on to the
metal-topped table, on one corner of which someone had left a pool of stew,
a filthy liquid mess that had the appearance of vomit. winston took up his
mug of gin, paused for an instant to collect his nerve, and gulped the
oily-tasting stuff down. when he had winked the tears out of his eyes he
suddenly discovered that he

stew, which, in among its general sloppiness, had cubes of spongy
pinkish stuff which was probably a preparation of meat. neither of them
spoke again till they had emptied their pannikins. from the table at
winston's left, a little behind his back, someone was talking rapidly and
continuously, a harsh gabble almost like the quacking of a duck, which
pierced the general uproar of the room.

'how is the dictionary getting on?' said winston, raising his voice to
overcome the noise.

'slowly,' said syme. 'i'm on the adjectives. it's fascinating.'

he had brightened up immediately at the mention of newspeak. he pushed his
pannikin aside, took up his hunk of bread in one delicate hand and his
cheese in the other, and leaned across the table so as to be able to speak
without shouting.

'the eleventh edition is the definitive edition,' he said. 'we're getting
the language into its final shape--the shape it's going to have when nobody
speaks anything else. when we've finished with it, people like y

e meaning, or "doubleplusgood" if you
want something stronger still. of course we use those forms already. but
in the final version of newspeak there'll be nothing else. in the end the
whole notion of goodness and badness will be covered by only six words--in
reality, only one word. don't you see the beauty of that, winston? it was
b.b.'s idea originally, of course,' he added as an afterthought.

a sort of vapid eagerness flitted across winston's face at the mention of
big brother. nevertheless syme immediately detected a certain lack of
enthusiasm.

'you haven't a real appreciation of newspeak, winston,' he said almost
sadly. 'even when you write it you're still thinking in oldspeak. i've read
some of those pieces that you write in "the times" occasionally. they're
good enough, but they're translations. in your heart you'd prefer to stick
to oldspeak, with all its vagueness and its useless shades of meaning.
you don't grasp the beauty of the destruction of words. do you know that
newspeak
 
 ___________________________
 
 is the only language in the world whose vocabulary gets smaller
every year?'

winston did know that, of course. he smiled, sympathetically he hoped, not
trusting himself to speak. syme bit off another fragment of the
dark-coloured bread, chewed it briefly, and went on:

'don't you see that the whole aim of newspeak is to narrow the range of
thought? in the end we shall make thoughtcrime literally impossible,
because there will be no words in which to express it. every concept that
can ever be needed, will be expressed by exactly one word, with its meaning
rigidly defined and all its subsidiary meanings rubbed out and forgotten.
already, in the eleventh edition, we're not far

t. newspeak is ingsoc and ingsoc
is newspeak,' he added with a sort of mystical satisfaction. 'has it ever
occurred to you, winston, that by the year 2050, at the very latest, not a
single human being will be alive who could understand such a conversation
as we are having now?'

'except----' began winston doubtfully, and he stopped.

it had been on the tip of his tongue to say 'except the proles,' but he
checked himself, not feeling fully certain that this remark was not in
some way unorthodox. syme, however, had divined what he was about to say.

'the proles are not human beings,' he said carelessly. 'by 2050--earlier,
probably--all real knowledge of oldspeak will have disappeared. the whole
literature of the past will have been destroyed. chaucer, shakespeare,
milton, byron--they'll exist only in newspeak versions, not merely changed
into something different, but actually changed into something contradictory
of what they used to be. even the literature of the party will change.
even the 
 
 ___________________________
 
slogans will change. how could you have a slogan like "freedom is
slavery" when the concept of freedom has been abolished? the whole climate
of thought will be different. in fact there will be no thought, as we
understand it now. orthodoxy means not thinking--not needing to think.
orthodoxy is unconsciousness.'

one of these days, thought winston with sudden deep conviction, syme will
be vaporized. he is too intelligent. he sees too clearly and speaks too
plainly. the party does not like such people. one day he will disappear.
it is written in his face.

winston had finished his bread and cheese. he turned a little sideways
in his chair to drink his mug of coffee. at the table on his left the man
with the strident voice was still talking remorselessly away. a young
woman who was perhaps his secretary, and who was sitting with her back
to winston, was listening to him an

erence. whatever it was, you
could be certain that every word of it was pure orthodoxy, pure ingsoc.
as he watched the eyeless face with the jaw moving rapidly up and down,
winston had a curious feeling that this was not a real human being but
some kind of dummy. it was not the man's brain that was speaking, it was
his larynx. the stuff that was coming out of him consisted of words, but
it was not speech in the true sense: it was a noise uttered in
unconsciousness, like the quacking of a duck.

syme had fallen silent for a moment, and with the handle of his spoon was
tracing patterns in the puddle of stew. the voice from the other table
quacked rapidly on, easily audible in spite of the surrounding din.

'there is a word in newspeak,' said syme, 'i don't know whether you know
it: duckspeak, to quack like a duck. it is one of those interesting words
that have two contradictory meanings. applied to an opponent, it is abuse,
applied to someone you agree with, it is praise.'

unquestionably sy

me will be vaporized, winston thought again. he thought
it with a kind of sadness, although well knowing that syme despised him
and slightly disliked him, and was fully capable of denouncing him as a
thought-criminal if he saw any reason for doing so. there was something
subtly wrong with syme. there was something that he lacked: discretion,
aloofness, a sort of saving stupidity. you could not say that he was
unorthodox. he believed in the principles of ingsoc, he venerated big
brother, he rejoiced over victories, he hated heretics, not merely with
sincerity but with a sort of restless zeal, an up-to-dateness of
information, which the ordinary party member did not approach. yet a faint
air of disreputability always clung to him. he said things that would have
been better unsaid, he h

ad read too many books, he frequented the chestnut
tree cafe, haunt of painters and musicians. there was no law, not even an
unwritten law, against frequenting the chestnut tree cafe, yet the place
was somehow ill-omened. the old, discredited leaders of the party had been
used to gather there before they were finally purged. goldstein himself,
it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. syme's
fate was not difficult to foresee. and yet it was a fact that if syme
grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, winston's, secret
opinions, he would betray him instantly to the thought police. so would
anybody else, for that matter: but syme more than most. zeal was not
enough. orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

syme looked up. 'here comes parsons,' he said.

something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.
parsons, winston's fellow-tenant at victory mansions, was in fact threading
his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man wit

s rolled back from pudgy forearms. parsons did,
indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. he greeted them both
with a cheery 'hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an
intense smell of sweat. beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.
his powers of sweating were extraordinary. at the community centre you
could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of
the bat handle. syme had produced a strip of paper on which there was a
long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his
fingers.

'look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said parsons, nudging
winston. 'keenness, eh? what's that you've got there, old boy? something
a bit too brainy for me, i expect. smith, old boy, i'll tell you why i'm
chasing you. it's that sub you forgot to give me.'

'which sub is that?' said winston, automatically feeling for money. about
a quarter of one's salary

re's the point, old boy. what do you
think put her on to him in the first place? she spotted he was wearing a
funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that
before. so the chances were he was a foreigner. pretty smart for a nipper
of seven, eh?'

'what happened to the man?' said winston.

'ah, that i couldn't say, of course. but i wouldn't be altogether surprised
if----' parsons made the motion of aiming a rifle, and clicked his tongue
for the explosion.

'good,' said syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.

'of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed winston dutifully.

'what i mean to say, there is a war on,' said parsons.

as though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the
telescreen just above their heads. however, it was not the proclamation of
a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the ministry
of plenty.

'comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'attention, comrades! we have

eek. and
only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was
to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. was it possible that they could
swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? yes, they swallowed it. parsons
swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. the eyeless creature
at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious
desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that
last week the ration had been thirty grammes. syme, too--in some more
complex way, involving doublethink, syme swallowed it. was he, then, alone
in the possession of a memory?

the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. as
compared with last year there was more food, more clothes, more houses,
more furniture, more cooking-pots, more fuel, more ships, more helicopters,
more books, more babies--more of everything except disease, crime, and
insanity. year by year and minute by minute, everybody and everything was

idly upwards. as syme had done earlier winston had taken up
his spoon and was dabbling in the pale-coloured gravy that dribbled across
the table, drawing a long streak of it out into a pattern. he meditated
resentfully on the physical texture of life. had it always been like
this? had food always tasted like this? he looked round the canteen.

myself.'

'ah, well--just thought i'd ask you, old boy.'

'sorry,' said winston.

the quacking voice from the next table, temporarily silenced during the
ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. for some
reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons, with her
wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. within two years those
children would be denouncing her to the thought police. mrs parsons would
be vaporized. syme would be vaporized. winston would be vaporized. o'brien
would be vaporized. parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.
the little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine
corridors of ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. and the girl
with dark hair, the girl from the fiction department--she would never be
vaporized either. it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would

 again. perhaps after all she was not
really following him about, perhaps it was coincidence that she had sat so
close to him two days running. his cigarette had gone out, and he laid it
carefully on the edge of the table. he would finish smoking it after work,
if he could keep the tobacco in it. quite likely the person at the next
table was a spy of the thought police, and quite likely he would be in the
cellars of the ministry of love within three days, but a cigarette end
must not be wasted. syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it
away in his pocket. parsons had begun talking again.

'did i ever tell you, old boy,' he said, chuckling round the stem of his
pipe, 'about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old
market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster
of b.b.? sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches.

nsparent as air. it was as though the surface of the glass
had been the arch of the sky, enclosing a tiny world with its atmosphere
complete. he had the feeling that he could get inside it, and that in
fact he was inside it, along with the mahogany bed and the gateleg table,
and the clock and the steel engraving and the paperweight itself. the
paperweight was the room he was in, and the coral was julia's life and his
own, fixed in a sort of eternity at the heart of the crystal.




chapter 5



syme had vanished. a morning came, and he was missing from work: a few
thoughtless people commented on his absence. on the next day nobody
mentioned him. on the third day winston went into the vestibule of the
records department to look at the notice-board. one of the notices carried
a printed list of the members of the chess committee, of whom syme had
been one. it looked almost exactly as it had looked before--nothing had
been crossed out--but it was one name shorter. it was enough. syme had

red part of his self-possession. 'hardly scholarly,' he
said. 'i'm only an amateur. it's not my subject. i have never had anything
to do with the actual construction of the language.'

'but you write it very elegantly,' said o'brien. 'that is not only my own
opinion. i was talking recently to a friend of yours who is certainly an
expert. his name has slipped my memory for the moment.'

again winston's heart stirred painfully. it was inconceivable that this
was anything other than a reference to syme. but syme was not only dead,
he was abolished, an unperson. any identifiable reference to him would have
been mortally dangerous. o'brien's remark must obviously have been intended
as a signal, a codeword. by sharing a small act of thoughtcrime he had
turned the two of them into accomplices. they had continued to stroll
slowly down the corridor, but now o'brien halted. with the curious,
disarming friendliness that he always managed to put in to the gesture he
resettled his spectacles on his nos
