 want to go to florida. she wanted to visit some of her connections in east tennessee and she was seizing at every chance to change bailey's mind. bailey was the son she lived with, her only boy. he was sitting on the edge of his chair at the table, bent over the orange sports section of the journal. "now look here, bailey," she said, "see here, read this," and she stood with one hand on her thin hip and the other rattling the newspaper at his bald head. "here this fellow that calls himself the misfit is aloose from the federal pen and headed toward florida and you read here what it says he did to these people. just you read it. i wouldn't take my children in any direction with a criminal like that aloose in it. i couldn't answer to my conscience if i did."

bailey didn't look up from his reading so she wheeled around then and faced the children's mother, a young woman in slacks, whose face was as broad and innocent as a cabbage and was tied around with a green head-kerchief that had two poi

e different parts of the world and be broad. they never have been to east tennessee."

the children's mother didn't seem to hear her but the eight-year-old boy, john wesley, a stocky child with glasses, said, "if you don't want to go to florida, why dontcha stay at home?" he and the little girl, june star, were reading the funny papers on the floor.

"she wouldn't stay at home to be queen for a day," june star said without raising her yellow head.

"yes and what would you do if this fellow, the misfit, caught you?" the grandmother asked.

"i'd smack his face," john wesley said.

"she wouldn't stay at home for a million bucks," june star said. "afraid she'd miss something. she has to go everywhere we go."

"all right, miss," the grandmother said. "just remember that the next time you want me to curl your hair."

june star said her hair was naturally curly.

the next morning the grandmother was the first one in the car, ready to go. she had her big black valise

ught? now why did i do that?"

"because you're a good man!" the grandmother said at once.

"yes'm, i suppose so," red sam said as if he were struck with this answer.

his wife brought the orders, carrying the five plates all at once without a tray, two in each hand and one balanced on her arm. "it isn't a soul in this green world of god's that you can trust," she said. "and i don't count nobody out of that, not nobody," she repeated, looking at red sammy.

"did you read about that criminal, the misfit, that's escaped?" asked the grandmother.

"i wouldn't be a bit surprised if he didn't attact this place right here," said the woman. "if he hears about it being here,i wouldn't be none surprised to see him. if he hears it's two cent in the cash register, i wouldn't be a tall surprised if he . . ."

"that'll do," red sam said. "go bring these people their co'-colas," and the woman went off to get the rest of the order.

"a good man is hard to find," red sammy said. "every- thing is getting terri

d you mind calling them children to sit down by you? children make me nervous. i want all you all to sit down right together there where you're at."

"what are you telling us what to do for?" june star asked.

behind them the line of woods gaped like a dark open mouth. "come here," said their mother.

"look here now," bailey began suddenly, "we're in a predicament! we're in . . ."

the grandmother shrieked. she scrambled to her feet and stood staring. "you're the misfit!" she said. "i recognized you at once!"

"yes'm," the man said, smiling slightly as if he were pleased in spite of himself to be known, "but it would have been better for all of you, lady, if you hadn't of reckernized me."

bailey turned his head sharply and said something to his mother that shocked even the children. the old lady began to cry and the misfit reddened.

"lady," he said, "don't you get upset. sometimes a man says things he don't mean. i don't reckon he meant to talk to you thataw

ay."

"you wouldn't shoot a lady, would you?" the grandmother said and removed a clean handkerchief from her cuff and began to slap at her eyes with it.

the misfit pointed the toe of his shoe into the ground and made a little hole and then covered it up again. "i would hate to have to," he said.

"listen," the grandmother almost screamed, "i know you're a good man. you don't look a bit like you have com- mon blood. i know you must come from nice people!"

"yes mam," he said, "finest people in the world." when he smiled he showed a row of strong white teeth. "god never made a finer woman than my mother and my daddy's heart was pure gold," he said. the boy

with the red sweat shirt had come around behind them and was standing with his gun at his hip. the misfit squatted down on the ground. "watch them children, bobby lee," he said. "you know they make me nervous." he looked at the six of them huddled together in front of him and he seemed to be embarrassed as if he couldn't think of anything to say. "ain't a cloud in the sky," he remarked, looking up at it. "don't see no sun but don't see no cloud neither."

"yes, it's a beautiful day," said the grandmother. "listen," she said, "you shouldn't call yourself the misfit because i know you're a good man a

"hush!" bailey yelled. "hush! everybody shut up and let me handle this!" he was squatting in the position of a runner about to sprint forward but he didn't move.

"i prechate that, lady," the misfit said and drew a little circle in the ground with the butt of his gun.

"it'll take a half a hour to fix this here car," hiram called, looking over the raised hood of it.

"well, first you and bobby lee get him and that little boy to step over yonder with you," the misfit said, pointing to bailey and john wesley. "the boys want to ast you some- thing," he said to bailey. "would you mind stepping back in them woods there with them?"

up by the arm as if he were assisting an old man. john wesley caught hold of his father's hand and bobby lee followed. they went off toward the woods and just as they reached the dark edge, bailey turned and supporting himself against a gray naked pine trunk, he shouted, "i'll be back in a minute, mamma, wait on me!"

"come back this instant!" his mother shrilled but they all disappeared into the woods.

"bailey boy!" the grandmother called in a tragic voice but she found she was looking at the misfit squatting on the ground in front of her. "i just know you're a good man," she said desperately. "you're not a bit common!"

"nome, i ain't a good man," the misfit said after a second as if he had considered her statement carefully, "but i ain't the worst in the world neither. my daddy said i was a different breed of dog from my brothers and sisters. 'you know,' daddy said, 'it's some that can live their whole life out without asking about it and it's others has to know why it is, and this boy i

"that's perfectly all right," the grandmother said. "maybe bailey has an extra shirt in his suitcase."

"i'll look and see terrectly," the misfit said.

"where are they taking him?" the children's mother screamed.

"daddy was a card himself," the misfit said. "you couldn't put anything over on him. he never got in trouble with the authorities though. just had the knack of handling them."

"you could be honest too if you'd only try," said the grandmother. "think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about some- body chasing you all the time."

oulder blades were just behind-his hat because she was standing up looking down on him. "do you ever pray?" she asked.

he shook his head. all she saw was the black hat wiggle between his shoulder blades. "nome," he said.

there was a pistol shot from the woods, followed closely by another. then silence. the old lady's head jerked around. she could hear the wind move through the tree tops like a long satisfied insuck of breath. "bailey boy!" she called.

"i was a gospel singer for a while," the misfit said. "i been most everything. been in the arm service, both land and sea, at home and abroad, been twict married, been an undertaker, been with the railroads, plowed mother earth, been in a tornado, seen a man burnt alive oncet," and he looked up at the children's mother and the little girl who were sitting close together, their faces white and their eyes glassy; "i even seen a woman flogged," he said.

"pray, pray," the grandmother began, "pray, pray . . ."

"i never was a bad boy that i reme

mber of," the misfit said in an almost dreamy voice, "but somewheres along the line i done something wrong and got sent to the penitentiary. i was buried alive," and he looked up and held her attention to him by a steady stare.

"that's when you should have started to pray," she said "what did you do to get sent to the penitentiary that first time?"

"turn to the right, it was a wall," the misfit said, looking up again at the cloudless sky. "turn to the left, it was a wall. look up it was a ceiling, look down it was a floor. i forget what i done, lady. i set there and set there, trying to remember what it was i done and i ain't recalled it to this day. oncet in a while, i would think it was coming to me, but it never come."

"maybe they put you in by mistake," the old lady said vaguely.

"nome," he said. "it wasn't no mistake. they had the papers on me."

"you must have stolen something

the misfit sneered slightly. "nobody had nothing i wanted," he said. "it was a head-doctor at the penitentiary said what i had done was kill my daddy but i known that for a lie. my daddy died in nineteen ought nineteen of the epidemic flu and i never had a thing to do with it. he was buried in the mount hopewell baptist churchyard and you can go there and see for yourself."

"if you would pray," the old lady said, "jesus would help you."

"that's right," the misfit said.

"well then, why don't you pray?" she asked trembling with delight suddenly.

"i don't want no hep," he said. "i'm doing all right by myself."

bobby lee and hiram came ambling back from the woods. bobby lee was dragging a yellow shirt with bright blue parrots in it.

"thow me that shirt, bobby lee," the misfit said. the shirt came flying at him and landed on his shoulder and he put it on. the grandmother couldn't name what the shirt reminded her of. "no, lady," the misfit said while he w

the children's mother had begun to make heaving noises as if she couldn't get her breath. "lady," he asked, "would you and that little girl like to step off yonder with bobby lee and hiram and join your husband?"

"yes, thank you," the mother said faintly. her left arm dangled helplessly and she was holding the baby, who had gone to sleep, in the other. "hep that lady up, hiram," the misfit said as she struggled to climb out of the ditch, "and bobby lee, you hold onto that little girl's hand."

"i don't want to hold hands with him," june star said. "he reminds me of a pig."

the fat boy blushed and laughed and caught her by the arm and pulled her off into the woods after hiram and her mother.

alone with the misfit, the grandmother found that she had lost her voice. there was not a cloud in the sky nor any sun. there was nothing around her but woods. she wanted to tell him that he

 must pray. she opened and closed her mouth several times before anything came out. finally she found herself saying, "jesus. jesus," meaning, jesus will help you, but the way she was saying it, it sounded as if she might be cursing.

"yes'm," the misfit said as if he agreed. "jesus shown everything off balance. it was the same case with him as with me except he hadn't committed any crime and they could prove i had committed one because they had the papers on me. of course," he said, "they never shown me my papers. that's why i sign myself now. i said long ago, you get you a signature and sign everything you do and keep a copy of it. then you'll know what you done and you can hold up the crime to the punishment and see do they match and in the

there was a piercing scream from the woods, followed closely by a pistol report. "does it seem right to you, lady, that one is punished a heap and another ain't punished at all?"

"jesus!" the old lady cried. "you've got good blood! i know you wouldn't shoot a lady! i know you come from nice

money i've got!"

"lady," the misfit said, looking beyond her far into the woods, "there never was a body that give the undertaker a tip."

there were two more pistol reports and the grandmother raised her head like a parched old turkey hen crying for water and called, "bailey boy, bailey boy!" as if her heart would break.

"jesus was the only one that ever raised the dead," the misfit continued, "and he shouldn't have done it. he shown everything off balance. if he did what he said, then it's nothing for you to do but thow away everything and follow him, and if he didn't, then it's nothing for you to do but enjoy the few minutes you got left the best way you can-by killing somebody or burning down his house or doing some other meanness to him. no pleasure but meanness," he said and his voice had become almost a snarl.

"maybe he didn't raise the dead," the old lady mumbled,

not knowing what she was saying and feeling so dizzy that she sank down in the ditch with her legs twisted under her.

"i wasn't there so i can't say he didn't," the misfit said. "i wisht i had of been there," he said, hitting the ground with his fist. "it ain't right i wasn't there because if i had of been there i would of known. listen lady," he said in a high voice, "if i had of been there i would of known and i wouldn't be like i am now." his voice seemed about to crack and the grandmother's head cleared for an instant. she saw the man's face twisted close to her own as if he were going to cry and she murmured, "why you're one of my babies. you're one of my ow

n children!" she reached out and touched him on the shoulder. the misfit sprang back as if a snake had bitten him and shot her three times through the chest. then he put his gun down on the ground and took off his glasses and began to clean them.

hiram and bobby lee returned from the woods and stood over the ditch, looking down at the grandmother who half sat and half lay in a puddle of blood with her legs crossed under her like a child's and her face smiling up at the cloudless sky.

"she was a talker, wasn't she?" bobby lee said, sliding down the ditch with a yodel.

"she would of been a good woman," the misfit said, "if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life."

"some fun!" bobby lee said.

"shut up, bobby lee" the misfit said. "it's no real pleasure in life."
