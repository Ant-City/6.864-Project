although i would have to reach home before i would realise there was a need for it; plenty
of time for verbena yet from the garden where aunt jenny puttered beside old joby, in a
pair of father's old cavalry gauntlets, among the coaxed and ordered beds, the quaint
and odorous old names, for though it was october no rain had come yet and hence no
frost to bring (or leave behind) the first half-warm half-chill nights of indian summer--the
drowsing air cool and empty for geese yet languid still with the old hot dusty smell of fox
grape and sassafras--the nights when before i became a man and went to college to

 back to town and dug her husband out of his little dim hole in the new bank
and made him sign father's peace bond for killing the two carpet baggers, and took
father and drusilla to the minister herself and saw that they were married. and father had
rebuilt the house too, on the same blackened spot, over the same cellar, where the other

had burned, only larger, much larger: drusilla said that the house was the aura of father's
dream just as a bride's trousseau and veil, the aura of hers. and aunt jenny had come to
live with us now so we had the garden (drusilla would no more have bothered with flowers
than father himself would have, who even now, even four years after it was over, still
seemed to exist, breathe, in that last year of it while she had ridden in man's clothes and
with her hair cut short like any other member of father's troop, across georgia and both
carolinas in front of sherman's army) for her to gather sprigs of verbena from to wear in her
hair because she said verbena was th

horses and courage and so it was the only one that was worth the wearing. the railroad
was hardly begun then and father and mr. redmond were not only still partners, they
were still friends, which as george wyatt said was easily a record for father, and he would
leave the house at daybreak on jupiter, riding up and down the unfinished line with two
saddlebags of gold coins borrowed on friday to pay the men on saturday, keeping just
two cross-ties ahead of the sheriff as aunt jenny said. so we walked in the dusk, slowly
between aunt jenny's flower beds while drusilla (in a dress now, who still would have worn
pants all the time if father had let her) leaned lightly on my arm and i smelled the verbena
in her hair as i had smelled the rain in it and in father's beard that night four years ago
when he and drusilla and uncle buck mccaslin found grumby and then came home and
found ringo and me more than just asleep: escaped into that oblivion which god or

found out that father had the money. and according to father, that's what started it,
although uncle buck mccaslin said father could not have owned a half interest in even
one hog, let alone a railroad, and not dissolve the business either sworn enemy or death-
pledged friend to his recent partner. so they parted and father finished the road. by that
time, seeing that he was going to finish it, some northern people sold him a locomotive on
credit which he named for aunt jenny, with a silver oil can in the cab with her name
engraved on it; and last summer the first train ran into jefferson, the engine decorated
with flowers and father in the cab blowing blast after blast on the whistle when he passed
redmond's house; and there were speeches at the station, with more flowers and a
confederate flag and girls in white dresses and red sashes and a band, and father stood
on the pilot of the engine and made a direct and absolutely needless allusion to mr.
redmond. that was

elbows angling outward as she put her hands to the sprig of verbena in her hair, i standing
straight and rigid facing the slightly bent head, the short jagged hair, the rigid curiously
formal angle of the bare arms gleaming faintly in the last of light as she removed the
verbena sprig and put it into my lapel, and i thought how the war had tried to stamp all
the women of her generation and class in the south into a type and how it had failed--the
suffering, the identical experience (hers and aunt jenny's had been almost the same
except that aunt jenny had spent a few nights with her husband before they brought him
back home in an ammunition wagon while gavin breckbridge was just drusilla's fiance)
was there in the eyes, yet beyond that was the incorrigibly individual woman: not like so
many men who return from wars to live on government reservations like so many steers,
emasculate and empty of all save an identical experience which they cannot forget and
dare not, else they would cease to liv

lt since the last overwhelming return of votes had come in late in the afternoon. so i
waited until after supper. we went to the diningroom and stood side by side until aunt
jenny entered and then drusilla, in the yellow ball gown, who walked straight to me and

"yes," she said. "you must tell him. kiss me." so again it was like it had been before.

her chair while father drew aunt jenny's. he had roused by then, not to talk himself but
rather to sit at the head of the table and reply to drusilla as she talked with a sort of
feverish and glittering volubility--to reply now and then to her with that courteous intolerant
pride which had lately become a little forensic, as if merely being in a political contest
filled with fierce and empty oratory had retroactively made a lawyer of him who was
anything and everything except a lawyer. then drusilla and aunt jenny rose and left us

we reached home just before midnight; we didn't have to pass through jefferson either.
before we turned in the gates i could see the lights, the chandeliers--hall, parlor, and what
aunt jenny (without any effort or perhaps even design on her part) had taught even ringo
to call the drawing room, the light falling outward across the portico, past the columns.
then i saw the horses, the faint shine of leather and buckle-glints on the black silhouettes
and then the men too--wyatt and others of father's old troop--and i had forgot that they
would be there. i had forgot that they would be there; i remember how i thought, since i

face at my shoulder--the jagged hair with a verbena sprig above each ear, the eyes
staring at me with that fierce exaltation. we entered the hall and crossed it, her hand
guiding me without pressure, and entered the parlor. then for the first time i realised it--the
alteration which is death--not that he was now just clay but that he was lying down. but i

jenny who had just risen from a chair behind which louvinia stood. she was father's sister,
taller than drusilla but no older, whose husband had been killed at the very beginning of
the war, by a shell from a federal frigate at fort moultrie, come to us from carolina six
years ago. ringo and i went to tennes

conceived to begin with yet with which man has taught himself to do so much, so much
more than they were intended to do or could be forgiven for doing, which had now
surrendered that life to which his intolerant heart had fiercely held; and then i knew that in
a minute i would begin to pant. so drusilla must have spoken twice before i heard her and
turned and saw in the instant aunt jenny and louvinia watching us, hearing drusilla now,
the unsentient bell quality gone now, her voice whispering into that quiet death-filled room
with a passionate and dying fall: "bayard." she faced me, she was quite near; again the
scent of the verbena in her hair seemed to have increased a hundred times as she stood
holding out to me, one in either hand, the two duelling pistols. "take them, bayard," she
said, in the same tone in which she had said "kiss me" last summer, already pressing them

 as dead leaves yet communicating to it that battery

women are--a touch, lips or fingers, and the knowledge, even clairvoyance, goes straight
to the heart without bothering the laggard brain at all. she stood erect now, staring at me
with intolerable and amazed incredulity which occupied her face alone for a whole
minute while her eyes were completely empty; it seemed to me that i stood there for a full
minute while aunt jenny and louvinia watched us, waiting for her eyes to fill. there was no
blood in her face at all, her mouth open a little and pale as one of those rubber rings
women seal fruit jars with. then her eyes filled with an expression of bitter and passionate
betrayal. "why, he's not--" she said. "he's not--and i kissed his hand," she said in an aghast
whisper; "i kissed his hand!" beginning to laugh, the laughter, rising, becoming a scream yet
still remaining laughter, screaming with laughter, trying her

and drusilla turned her face to louvinia.
"i kissed his hand, louvinia!" she cried. "did you see it? i kissed his hand!" the laughter

rising again, becoming the scream again yet still remaining laughter, she still trying to hold
it back with her hand like a small child who has filled its mouth too full.

"take her upstairs," aunt jenny said. but they were already moving toward the door,
louvinia half-carrying drusilla, the laughter diminishing as they neared the door as though
it waited for the larger space of the empty and brilliant hall to rise again. then it was gone;
aunt jenny and i stood there and i knew soon that i would begin to pant. i could feel it
beginning like you feel regurgitation beginning, as though there were not enough air in the
room, the house, not enough air anywhere under the heavy hot low sky where the

after a while the whippoorwills stopped and i heard the first day bird, a mockingbird. it
had sung all night too but now it was the day song, no longer the drowsy moony fluting.
then they all began--the sparrows from the stable, the thrush that lived in aunt jenny's
garden, and i heard a quail too from the pasture and now there was light in the room. but i
didn't move at once. i still lay on the bed (i hadn't undressed) with my hands under my
head and the scent of drusilla's verbena faint from where my coat lay on a chair,
watching the light grow, watching it turn rosy with the sun. after a while i heard louvinia
come up across the back yard and go into the kitchen; i heard the door and then the
long crash of her armful of stovewood into the box. soon th

they would begin to arrive and i told ringo to bring betsy on to the house.

but it was there, waiting, a part of the alteration, as though by being dead and no longer
needing air he had taken all of it, all that he had compassed and claimed and postulated
between the walls which he had built, along with him. aunt jenny must have been
waiting; she came out of the diningroom at once, without a sound, dressed, the hair that
was like father's combed and smooth above the eyes that were different from father's
eyes because they were not intolerant but just intent and grave and (she was wise too)
without pity. "are you going now?" she said.

"i do," she said. "even if you spend the day hidden in the stable loft, i still do."

mouth but to burst out all over her face like sweat does and with a dreadful and painful
convulsion as when you have vomited until it hurts you yet still you must vomit again--burst
out all over her face except her eyes, the brilliant incredulous eyes looking at me out of the
laughter as if they belonged to somebody else, as if they were two inert fragments of tar or
coal lying on the bottom of a receptacle filled with turmoil: "i kissed his hand! i kissed his
hand!" louvinia entered, aunt jenny must have sent her directly after me; again i walked
slowly and steadily so it would not start yet, down the stairs where aunt jenny stood
beneath the chandelier in the hall as mrs. wilkins had stood yesterday at the university. she
had my hat in her hand. "even if you hid all day in the stable, bayard," she said. i took the
hat; she said quietly, pleasantly, as if she were talking to a stranger, a guest: "i used to see
a lot of blockade runners in charleston. they were heroes in a way, you see

e could have kept his body. but i didn't need to see him
again because he was there, he would always be there; maybe what drusilla meant by his
dream was not something which he possessed but something which he had bequeathed
us which we could never forget, which would even assume the corporeal shape of him
whenever any of us, black or white, closed our eyes. i went into the house. there was no
light in the drawing room except the last of the afterglow which came through the western
window where aunt jenny's colored glass was; i was about to go on up stairs when i saw
her sitting there beside the window. she didn't call me and i didn't speak drusilla's name, i
just went to the door and stood there. "she's gone," aunt jenny said. "she took the evening
train. she has gone to montgomery, to dennison." denny had been married about a year
now; he was living in montgomery, reading law.

"no. kneel down." so i knelt beside the chair. "so you had a perfectly splendid

watched them come up as though she were trying to stop them; i felt them on my
