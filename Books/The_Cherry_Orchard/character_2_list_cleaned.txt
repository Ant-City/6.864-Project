[CHARACTER]  - 
      gayev is ranevsky's brother. he has several intriguing verbal habits; he frequently describes tricky billiards shots at odd and inappropriate times. he also will launch into overly sentimental and rhetorical speeches before his niece anya stops him, after which he always mutters "i am silent" at least once. gayev is a kind and concerned uncle and brother, but he behaves very differently around people not of his own social class. he is fifty-one years old, but as he notes, this is "difficult to believe", because he is in many ways an infant. he constantly pops sweets into his mouth, insults people (such as lopakhin) with whom he disagrees, and has to be reminded to put on his jacket by firs.
