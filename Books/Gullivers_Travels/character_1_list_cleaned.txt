the [CHARACTER] - 
                the
ruler of lilliput. like all lilliputians, the [CHARACTER] is fewer than
six inches tall. his power and majesty impress gulliver deeply,
but to us he appears both laughable and sinister. because of his
tiny size, his belief that he can control gulliver seems silly,
but his willingness to execute his subjects for minor reasons of politics
or honor gives him a frightening aspect. he is proud of possessing
the tallest trees and biggest palace in the kingdom, but he is also
quite hospitable, spending a fortune on his captive's food. the
[CHARACTER] is both a satire of the autocratic ruler and a strangely serious
portrait of political power.
