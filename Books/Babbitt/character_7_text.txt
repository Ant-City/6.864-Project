she cried cheerily, "now up-stairs you go, and pop into bed. we'll fix
it all up. i'll see to the doors. now skip!"

for many minutes, for many hours, for a bleak eternity, he lay awake,
shivering, reduced to primitive terror, comprehending that he had won
freedom, and wondering what he could do with anything so unknown and so
embarrassing as freedom.

no apartment-house in zenith had more resolutely experimented in
condensation than the revelstoke arms, in which paul and zilla riesling
had a flat. by sliding the beds into low closets the bedrooms were
converted into living-rooms. the kitchens were cupboards each containing
an electric range, a copper sink, a glass refrigerator, and, very
intermittently, a balkan maid. everything about the arms was excessively
modern, and everything was compressed--except the garages.

the babbitts were calling on the rieslings at the arms. it was a
speculative venture to call on the rieslings; interesting and sometimes
disconcerting. zilla wa

of the flat, with its mantel unprovided with a fireplace,
and its strip of heavy gilt fabric upon a glaring new player-piano, till
mrs. riesling shrieked, "come on! let's put some pep in it! get out your
fiddle, paul, and i'll try to make georgie dance decently."

the babbitts were in earnest. they were plotting for the escape to
maine. but when mrs. babbitt hinted with plump smilingness, "does
paul get as tired after the winter's work as georgie does?" then zilla
remembered an injury; and when zilla riesling remembered an injury the
world stopped till something had been done about it.

"does he get tired? no, he doesn't get tired, he just goes crazy, that's
all! you think paul is so reasonable, oh, yes, and he loves to make out
he's a little lamb, but he's stubborn as a mule. oh, if you had to live
with him--! you'd find out how sweet he is! he just pretends to be
meek so he can have his own way. and me, i get the credit for being
a terrible old crank, but if i didn't blow up once in a while and ge

not interfere with the reasonable profits of stockholders. thus nobly
endowed, and keyed high by the discovery that he was a natural orator,
he was popular with audiences, and he raged through the campaign,
renowned not only in the seventh and eighth wards but even in parts of

crowded in his car, they came driving up to turnverein hall, south
zenith--babbitt, his wife, verona, ted, and paul and zilla riesling. the
hall was over a delicatessen shop, in a street banging with trolleys and
smelling of onions and gasoline and fried fish. a new appreciation of
babbitt filled all of them, including babbitt.

"don't know how you keep it up, talking to three bunches in one evening.
wish i had your strength," said paul; and ted exclaimed to verona, "the
old man certainly does know how to kid these roughnecks along!"

brevity, and joe contentedly went to bed at eight. babbitt sat on the
stump, facing the dark pond, slapping mosquitos. save the snoring guide,
there was no other human being within ten miles. he was lonelier than he
had ever been in his life. then he was in zenith.

he was worrying as to whether miss mcgoun wasn't paying too much for
carbon paper. he was at once resenting and missing the persistent
teasing at the roughnecks' table. he was wondering what zilla riesling
was doing now. he was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity
of being a garageman, ted would "get busy" in the university. he was
thinking of his wife. "if she would only--if she wouldn't be so darn
satisfied with just settling down--no! i won't! i won't go back! i'll
be fifty in three years. sixty in thirteen years. i'm going to have some
fun before it's too late. i don't care! i will!"

he thought of ida putiak, of louetta swanson, of that nice widow--what
