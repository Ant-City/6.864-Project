dost thou then hate my face so much? 
elektra

as from some rocky cleft 

cool water, hidden long from sunlight, gushes, 

and dwelling in thy locks, e'en to thy shoulders 

strength floweth down; and through thy skin's cool 

whiteness 

i feel thy blood's red ardour burn. my cheek 
can feel how soft the down on thy young body. 
strong art thou, thou art fair, e'en as a fruit 
that summer suns have brought to fullest ripeness. 

chrysothemis.

elektra. 

no! i cleave to thee,

nay, sister, nay. 
speak no such words in this abode.

threshold, eagerly, without a sound, like an animal. elektra pauses 
in her digging, looks round, and continues. she looks round again 
and listens. elektra digs again. orestes stands by the gate of 
the courtyard, in black relief against the last rays of sun. elektra
