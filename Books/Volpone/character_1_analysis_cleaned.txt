[CHARACTER]

in a play that revolves around disguises, [CHARACTER] is the ultimate master of disguise. he is the person who continually executes volpone's ideas and the one who comes up with the necessary lie whenever needed. the lie could be made in order to save volpone from the charges laid against him by bonario and celia or to convince corvino to let his wife sleep with the fox--either way [CHARACTER] seems to have no scruples about deceit. but his most important deception is the one he effects on volpone and the audience, hiding his true nature and intentions from both the fox and us. in the opening acts, [CHARACTER] appears to be exactly what he is described as: a clinging, servile parasite, who only exists for volpone and through volpone. in other words, he exists to serve volpone, and all that volpone wants he wants. this impression is reinforced by several cringing speeches that he gives, all in praise of volpone. but in act three, we have the beginning of what seems an assertion of self-identity by [CHARACTER], when he begins to grow confident in his abilities. but then this confidence again is left unvoiced, and [CHARACTER] seems to go back to being volpone's faithful servant, helping him get out of the troublesome situation with bonario and celia. but it turns out that [CHARACTER]'s aid in this situation may have been motivated as much by personal interest as it was by a desire to aid volpone, for when he is presented with an opportunity to seize volpone's wealth, he takes it. [CHARACTER] himself is possessed by greed, and he attempts to move out of his role as parasite--a harmless fly, circling around a great beast--to the role of great beast himself. but his attempt fails, as volpone exposes them both. an interesting question is what significance his failure has in the context of the play and whether it is just punishment for his greed, his deceit, or his attempt to usurp the powers and privileges of the nobility and move above his social class.
