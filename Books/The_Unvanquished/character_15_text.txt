ox hounds would look
at him when he would go into the dog run, while we went up the aisle to our pew. ringo
had the book; he went up to the gallery, i looked back and saw him leaning his arms on
the book on the balustrade.

and straight in her sunday calico dress and the shawl and the hat mrs. compson had
loaned her a year ago; straight and quiet, with her hands holding her prayer book in her
lap like always, though there hadn't been an episcopal service in the church in almost
three years now. brother fortinbride was a methodist, and i don't know what the people
were. last summer when we got back with the first batch of mules from alabama, granny
sent for them, sent out word back into the hills where they lived in dirt-floored cabins, on
the little poor farms without slaves. it took three or four times to get them to come in, but at
last they all came--men and women and children and the dozen niggers that had got free
by accident and didn't know what to do about it. i reckon this was the first church wi

ting up there
in the high shadows where there was room enough for two hundred; and i could
remember back when father would be in the pew with us and the grove outside would be
full of carriages from the other plantations, and doctor worsham in his stole beneath the
altar, and for each white person in the auditorium there would be ten niggers in the
gallery. and i reckon that on that first sunday when granny knelt down in public, it was the
first time they had ever seen anyone kneel in a church. brother fortinbride wasn't a minister
either. he was a private in father's regiment, and he got hurt bad in the first battle the
regiment was in; they thought that he was dead, but he said that jesus came to him and
told him to rise up and live, and father sent him back home to die, only he didn't die. but
they said that he didn't have any stomach left at all, and everybody thought that the food
we had to eat in 1862 and '63 would finish killing him, even if he had eaten it with women
to cook it instead of gatheri

ng weeds from ditch banks and cooking them himself. but it
didn't kill him, and so maybe it was jesus, after all, like he said. and so, when we came
back with the first batch of mules and the silver and the food, and granny sent word out
for all that needed, it was like brother fortinbride sprang right up out of the ground with the
names and histories of all the hill folks at his tongue's end, like maybe what he claimed was
true--that the lord had both him and granny in mind when he created the other. so he
would stand there where doctor worsham used to stand, and talk quiet for a little while
about god, with his hair showing where he cut it himself and the bones looking like they
were coming right out through his face, in a frock coat that had turned green a long time
ago and wi

granny stood up. she would not go to the altar; she just stood there in our pew with



her face straight ahead, in the shawl and mrs. compson's hat and the dress that louvinia
washed and ironed every saturday, holding the prayer book. it used to have her name on
it in gold letters, but now the only way you could read them was to run your finger over
them; she said quiet, too--quiet as brother fortinbride--"i have sinned. i want you all to pray
for me."

compson's hat above the pew back they had to look at now. i don't know if she prayed
herself or not. and brother fortinbride didn't pray either--not aloud anyway. ringo and i
were just past fifteen then, but i could imagine what doctor worsham would have thought
up to say--about all soldiers did not carry arms, and about they also serve, and how one
child saved from hunger and cold is better in heaven's sight than a thousand slain
enemies. but b

 or not. and the ones that she had loaned the brand-blotted mules that ab snopes
was afraid to try to sell would have to tell her how the mule was getting along and how
much work it had done, and now and then she would take the mule away from one man
or woman and give it to another, tearing up the old receipt and making the man or the
woman sign the new one, telling them on what day to go and get the mule.

together, and granny stopped putting the rest of the money back into the can and she
and brother fortinbride did what they did each time. "i'm making out fine with the mule,"
he said. "i don't need any money."

feed a bird the longest day you live. you take this money."
"no," brother fortinbride said. "i'm making out fine."


we walked back home, ringo carrying the book. "you done receipted out four
mules you ain't hardly laid eyes on yet," he said. "what you gonter do about that?"

so it was afternoon when ringo closed the book and got the new receipts

n coming in where the children are getting ready to play a
game and telling the children that the game is all right but that the grown folks need the
room and the furniture for a while. he came walking fast up from the grove where he had
hitched his mule with the others, with his gaunted face and his frock coat with the horse-
hide and the yankee-tent patches, into where the town people were standing around
under umbrellas with granny in the middle and the big refugeeing preacher with his book

brother fortinbride and all of them--the old men and the women and the children,

most of the jefferson people were there too, and there was another preacher--a

already open and one of the compson niggers holding an umbrella over him and the rain

where granny was and into the dark red dirt beside the red grave without splashing at all.

ith the quiet rain splashing on the yellow
boards until they quit looking like boards and began to look like water with thin sunlight
reflected in it, sinking away into the ground. then the wet red dirt began to flow into the
grave, with the shovels darting and flicking slow and steady and the hill men waiting to
take turns with the shovels because uncle buck would not let anyone spell him with his.

it didn't take long, and i reckon the refugeeing preacher would have tried again
even then, but brother fortinbride didn't give him a chance. brother fortinbride didn't even
put down his shovel; he stood there leaning on it like he was in the field, and he sounded
just like he used to in the church when ab snopes would be home from memphis again--
strong and quiet and not loud:

where she has gone. and i don't reckon that anybody that ever knew her would want to
insult her by telling her to rest anywhere in peace. and i reckon that god has already seen
to it that there are men, women and children, black, whi
