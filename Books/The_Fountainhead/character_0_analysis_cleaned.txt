[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is the undisputed hero of the fountainhead, and
his story drives the novel. his name contains the words "hard" and "roar,"
both of which accurately describe his tough, determined character.
roark's buildings suggest his personality, for like roark they are
innovative and austere. roark never compromises or deviates from
his principles. rand holds him up as everything that man can and
should be. consequently, roark does not develop over the course
of the novel--the ideal man does not need to change. although rand
despised religion, she often describes roark as if he is a religious
figure. roark does not preach, and he never actively seeks converts,
but he inspires absolute devotion and rapture in his followers.
cameron, mallory, dominique, and wynand change their entire belief
systems after meeting him. dominique in particular exhibits a religious
passion for roark, racked by ecstasy and guilt as if inspired by
a messiah. like all christ figures in literature, roark's enemies
persecute him. despite the hatred of the world, roark lives life
as rand thinks it should be lived.
