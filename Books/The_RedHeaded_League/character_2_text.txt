st before we went into the very simple problem presented by miss mary sutherland, that for strange effects and extraordinary combinations we must go to life itself, which is always far more daring than any effort of the imagination."

"a proposition which i took the liberty of doubting."

"you did, doctor, but none the less you must come round to my view, for otherwise i shall keep on piling fact upon fact on you until your reason breaks down under them and acknowledges me to be right. now, mr. jabez wilson here has been good enough to call upon me this morning, and to begin a narrative which promises to be one of the most singular which i have listened to for some time. you have heard me remark that the strangest and most unique things are very often connected not with the larger but with the smaller crimes, and occasionally, indeed, where there is room for doubt whether any positive crime has been committed. as far as i have heard it is impossible for me to say whether the present case is an ins

 was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

sherlock holmes's quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else."

mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"how, in the name of good-fortune, did you know all that, mr. holmes?" he asked. "how did you know, for example, that i did manual labour. it's as true as gospel, for i began as a ship's carpenter."

"your hands, my dear sir. your right hand is quite a size larger than your left. you have worked with it, and the muscles are more developed."

"well, the snuff, then, and the freemasonry?"

"i won't insul

ith the smooth patch near the elbow where you rest it upon the desk?"

"well, but china?"

"the fish that you have tattooed immediately above your right wrist could only have been done in china. i have made a small study of tattoo marks and have even contributed to the literature of the subject. that trick of staining the fishes' scales of a delicate pink is quite peculiar to china. when, in addition, i see a chinese coin hanging from your watch-chain, the matter becomes even more simple."

mr. jabez wilson laughed heavily. "well, i never!" said he. "i thought at first that you had done something clever, but i see that there was nothing in it, after all."

"i begin to think, watson," said holmes, "that i make a mistake in explaining. 'omne ignotum pro magnifico,' you know, and my poor little reputation, such as it is, will suffer shipwreck if i am so candid. can you not find the advertisement, mr. wilson?"

"yes, i have got it now," he answered with his thick red finger planted halfway down the co

chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "it is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date."

"it is the morning chronicle of april 27, 1890. just two months ago."

"very good. now, mr. wilson?"

"well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes," said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; "i have a small pawnbroker's business at coburg square, near the city. it's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i used to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"what is the name of this obliging youth?" asked sherlock holmes.

"his name is vincent spaulding, and he's not such a youth, eith

 and a deal table, behind which sat a small man with a head that was even redder than mine. he said a few words to each candidate as he came up, and then he always managed to find some fault in them which would disqualify them. getting a vacancy did not seem to be such a very easy matter, after all. however, when our turn came the little man was much more favorable to me than to any of the others, and he closed the door as we entered, so that he might have a private word with us.

"'this is mr. jabez wilson,' said my assistant, 'and he is willing to fill a vacancy in the league.'

"'and he is admirably suited for it,' the other answered. 'he has every requirement. i cannot recall when i have seen anything so fine.' he took a step backward, cocked his head on one side, and gazed at my hair until i felt quite bashful. then suddenly he plunged forward, wrung my hand, and congratulated me warmly on my success.

"'it would be injustice to hesitate,' said he. 'you will, however, i am sure, excuse me for

t's only four hours a day, and i should not think of leaving,' said i.

"'no excuse will avail,' said mr. duncan ross; 'neither sickness nor business nor anything else. there you must stay, or you lose your billet.'

"'and the work?'

"'is to copy out the encyclopaedia britannica. there is the first volume of it in that press. you must find your own ink, pens, and blotting-paper, but we provide this table and chair. will you be ready to-morrow?'

"'certainly,' i answered.

"'then, good-bye, mr. jabez wilson, and let me congratulate you once more on the important position which you have been fortunate enough to gain.' he bowed me out of the room and i went home with my assistant, hardly knowing what to say or do, i was so pleased at my own good fortune.

"well, i thought over the matter all day, and by evening i was in low spirits again; for i had quite persuaded myself that the whole affair must be some great hoax or fraud, though what its object might be i could not imagine. it seemed altogether

but that was not quite good enough, mr. holmes. i did not wish to lose such a place without a struggle, so, as i had heard that you were good enough to give advice to poor folk who were in need of it, i came right away to you."

"and you did very wisely," said holmes. "your case is an exceedingly remarkable one, and i shall be happy to look into it. from what you have told me i think that it is possible that graver issues hang from it than might at first sight appear."

"grave enough!" said mr. jabez wilson. "why, i have lost four pound a week."

"as far as you are personally concerned," remarked holmes, "i do not see that you have any grievance against this extraordinary league. on the contrary, you are, as i understand, richer by some 30 pounds, to say nothing of the minute knowledge which you have gained on every subject which comes under the letter a. you have lost nothing by them."

"no, sir. but i want to find out about them, and who they are, and what their object was in playing this prank-

ong!"

we travelled by the underground as far as aldersgate; and a short walk took us to saxe-coburg square, the scene of the singular story which we had listened to in the morning. it was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with "jabez wilson" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up

ng point was what they were burrowing for. i walked round the corner, saw the city and suburban bank abutted on our friend's premises, and felt that i had solved my problem. when you drove home after the concert i called upon scotland yard and upon the chairman of the bank directors, with the result that you have seen."

"and how could you tell that they would make their attempt to-night?" i asked.

"well, when they closed their league offices that was a sign that they cared no longer about mr. jabez wilson's presence--in other words, that they had completed their tunnel. but it was essential that they should use it soon, as it might be discovered, or the bullion might be removed. saturday would suit them better than any other day, as it would give them two days for their escape. for all these reasons i expected them to come to-night."

"you reasoned it out beautifully," i exclaimed in unfeigned admiration "it is so long a chain, and yet every link rings true."

"it saved me from ennui," he answer
