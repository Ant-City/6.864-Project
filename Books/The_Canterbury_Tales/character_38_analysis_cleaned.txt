the [CHARACTER]
the [CHARACTER] rides at the front of the procession described
in the general prologue, and his story is the first in the sequence.
the host clearly admires the [CHARACTER], as does the narrator. the narrator
seems to remember four main qualities of the [CHARACTER]. the first is
the [CHARACTER]'s love of ideals--"chivalrie" (prowess), "trouthe" (fidelity), "honour"
(reputation), "fredom" (generosity), and "curteisie" (refinement)
(general prologue, 45-46).
the second is the [CHARACTER]'s impressive military career. the [CHARACTER]
has fought in the crusades, wars in which europeans traveled by
sea to non-christian lands and attempted to convert whole cultures
by the force of their swords. by chaucer's time, the spirit for
conducting these wars was dying out, and they were no longer undertaken
as frequently. the [CHARACTER] has battled the muslims in egypt, spain,
and turkey, and the russian orthodox in lithuania and russia. he
has also fought in formal duels. the third quality the narrator
remembers about the [CHARACTER] is his meek, gentle, manner. and the
fourth is his "array," or dress. the [CHARACTER] wears a tunic made of
coarse cloth, and his coat of mail is rust-stained, because he has
recently returned from an expedition.

the [CHARACTER]'s interaction with other characters tells us
a few additional facts about him. in the prologue to the nun's priest's
tale, he calls out to hear something more lighthearted, saying that
it deeply upsets him to hear stories about tragic falls. he would
rather hear about "joye and greet solas," about men who start off
in poverty climbing in fortune and attaining wealth (nun's priest's
prologue, 2774). the host agrees with him,
which is not surprising, since the host has mentioned that whoever
tells the tale of "best sentence and moost solaas" will win the
storytelling contest (general prologue, 798).
and, at the end of the pardoner's tale, the [CHARACTER] breaks in to stop
the squabbling between the host and the pardoner, ordering them to
kiss and make up. ironically, though a soldier, the romantic, idealistic [CHARACTER]
clearly has an aversion to conflict or unhappiness of any sort.
