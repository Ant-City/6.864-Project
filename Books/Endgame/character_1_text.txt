then you won't finish me.
(pause.)
clov:
i'll leave you, i have things to do.
hamm:
do you remember when you came here?
clov:
no. too small, you told me.
hamm:
do you remember your father?
clov (wearily):
same answer.
(pause.)
you've asked me these questions millions of times.
hamm:
i love the old questions.
(with fervour.)
ah the old questions, the old answers, there's nothing like them!
(pause.)
it was i was a father to you.
clov:
yes.
(he looks at hamm fixedly.)
you were that to me.
hamm:
my house a home for you.
clov:
yes.
(he looks about him.)
this was that for me.

hamm:
did you ever think of one thing?
clov:
never.
hamm:
that here we're down in a hole.
(pause.)
but beyond the hills? eh? perhaps it's still green. eh?
(pause.)
flora! pomona!
(ecstatically.)
ceres!
(pause.)
perhaps you won't need to go very far.
clov:
i can't go very far.

i'll leave you.
hamm:
is my dog ready?
clov:
he lacks a leg.
hamm:
is he silky?
clov:
he's kind of a pomeranian.
hamm:
go and get him.
clov:
he lacks a leg.
hamm:
go and get him!
(exit clov.)
we're getting on.
(enter clov holding by one of its three legs a black toy dog.)
clov:
your dogs are here.
(he hands the dog to hamm who feels it, fondles it.)
hamm:
he's white, isn't he?
clov:
nearly.
hamm:
what do you mean, nearly? is he white or isn't he?
clov:
he isn't.
(pause.)
hamm:
you've forgotten the sex.

but he isn't finished. the sex goes on at the end.

you haven't put on his ribbon.

hamm:
can he stand?
clov:
i don't know.
hamm:
try.
(he hands the dog to clov who places it on the ground.)
well?
clov:
wait!
(he squats down and tries to get the dog to stand on its three legs, fails, lets it go. the dog falls on its side.)
hamm (impatiently):
well?
clov:
he's standing.
hamm (groping for the dog):
where? where is he?
(clov holds up the dog in a standing position.)
clov:
there.
(he takes hamm's hand and guides it towards the dog's head.)
hamm (his hand on the dog's head):
is he gazing at me?
clov:
yes.
hamm (proudly):
as if he were asking me to take him for a walk?
clov:
if you like.
hamm (as before):
or as if he were begging me for a bone.
(he withdraws his hand.)
leave him like that, standing there imploring me.
(clov straightens up. the dog falls on its side.)
clov:
i'll leave you.
hamm:
have you had your visions?
clov:
less.

clov:
light! how could anyone's light be on?
hamm:
extinguished!
clov:
naturally it's extinguished. if it's not on it's extinguished.

no, i mean mother pegg.
clov:
but naturally she's extinguished!
(pause.)
what's the matter with you today?
hamm:
i'm taking my course.
(pause.)
is she buried?
clov:
buried! who would have buried her?
hamm:
you.
clov:
me! haven't i enough to do without burying people?
hamm:
but you'll bury me.
clov:
no i won't bury you.
(pause.)
hamm:
she was bonny once, like a flower of the field.
(with reminiscent leer.)
and a great one for the men!
clov:
we too were bonny—once. it's a rare thing not to have been bonny—once.
(pause.)
hamm:
go and get the gaff.
(clov goes to the door, halts.)
clov:
do this, do that, and i do it. i never refuse. why?

hamm:
did i move?
clov:
no.
(hamm throws down the gaff.)
hamm:

clov:
what for?
hamm:
to oil the castors.
clov:
i oiled them yesterday.
hamm:
yesterday! what does that mean? yesterday!
clov (violently):
that means that bloody awful day, long ago, before this bloody awful day. i use the words you taught me. if they don't mean anything any more, teach me others. or let me be silent.

hamm:
i once knew a madman who thought the end of the world had come. he was a painter—and engraver. i had a great fondness for him. i used to go and see him, in the asylum. i'd take him by the hand and drag him to the window. look! there! all that rising corn! and there! look! the sails of th

it appears the case is... was not so... so unusual.
clov:
a madman? when was that?

oh way back, way back, you weren't in the land of the living.
clov:
god be with those days.

hamm:
i had a great fondness for him.

he was a painter—and engraver.
clov:
there are so many terrible things.

no, no, there are not so many now.

clov!
clov:
yes.
hamm:
do you not think this has gone on long enough?
clov:
yes!

what?
hamm:
this... this... thing.

i've always thought so.

if you leave me how shall i know?
clov (briskly):
well you simply whistle me and if i don't come running it means i've left you.
(pause.)
hamm:
you won't come and kiss me goodbye?
clov:
oh i shouldn't think so.
(pause.)
hamm:
but you might be merely dead in your kitchen.
clov:
the result would be the same.
hamm:
yes, but how would i know, if you were merely dead in your kitchen?
clov:
well... sooner or later i'd start to stink.
hamm:
you stink already. the whole place stinks of corpses.
clov:
the whole universe.
hamm (angrily):
to hell with the universe.

think of something.

what?

having an idea.
(he paces.)
ah!

hamm:
what a brain!
(pause.)
well?
clov:
wait!
(he meditates. not very convinced.)
yes...
(he raises his head.)
i have it! i set the alarm.
(pause.)
hamm:
this is perhaps not one of my bright days, but frankly—
clov:
you whistle me. i don't come. the alarm rings. i'm gone. it doesn't ring. i'm dead.
(pause.)
hamm:
is it working?
(pause. impatiently.)
the alarm, is it working?
clov:
why wouldn't it be working?
hamm:
because it's worked too much.
clov:
but it's hardly worked at all.
hamm (angrily):
then because it's worked too little!
clov:
i'll go and see.

clov:
no!
(he goes to door, turns.)
i'll leave you.
hamm:
it's time for my story. do you want to listen to my story?
clov:
no.
hamm:
ask my father if he wants to listen to my story.
(clov goes to bins, raises the lid of nagg's, stoops, looks into it. pause. he straightens up.)
clov:
he's asleep.
hamm:
wake him.
(clov stoops, wakes nagg with the alarm. unintelligible words. clov straightens up.)
clov:
he doesn't want to listen to your story.
hamm:
i'll give him a bon-bon.
(clov stoops. as before.)
clov:
he wants a sugar-plum.
hamm:
he'll get a sugar-plum.
(clov stoops. as before.)
clov:
it's a deal.
(he goes towards door. nagg's hands appear, gripping the rim. then the head emerges. clov reaches door, turns.)
do you believe in the life to come?

mine was always that.

the dog's gone.

he's not a real dog, he can't go.

he's lain down.

what are you doing?
clov:
putting things in order.

i'm going to clear everything away!

what in god's name do you think you're doing?
clov (straightening up):
i'm doing my best to create a little order.

drop it!
(clov drops the objects he has picked up.)

after all, there or elsewhere.

hamm (irritably):
what's wrong with your feet?

my feet?
hamm:

i must have put on my boots.

your slippers were hurting you?

the dialogue.

i've got on with my story.

i've got on with it well.

oh, by the way, your story?
hamm (surprised):
what story?

the one you've been telling yourself all your days.

that's the one.

there are days like that, one isn't inspired.
(pause.)
nothing you can do about it, just wait for it to come.

no forcing, no forcing, it's fatal.
(pause.)
i've got on with it a little all the same.

technique, you know.
(pause. irritably.)
i say i've got on with it a little all the same.
clov (admiringly):
well i never! in spite of everything you were able to get on with it!
hamm (modestly):
oh not very far, you know, not very far, but nevertheless, better than nothing.
clov:
better than nothing! is it possible?
hamm:
i'll tell you how it goes. he comes crawling on his belly—

what?
clov:
who do you mean, he?

who do i mean! yet another.

a job as gardener!
hamm:
is that what tickles you?
clov:
it must be that.
hamm:
it wouldn't be the bread?
clov:
or the brat.
(pause.)
hamm:
the whole thing is comical, i grant you that. what about having a good guffaw, the two of us together?
clov (after reflection):
i couldn't guffaw again today.
hamm (after reflection):
nor i.
(pause.)
i continue then. before accepting with gratitude he asks if he may have his little boy with him.
clov:
what age?
hamm:
oh tiny.
clov:
he would have climbed the trees.
hamm:
all the little odd jobs.
clov:
and then he would have grown up.
hamm:
very likely.

clov:
keep going, can't you, keep going?

that's all. i stopped there.

do you remember, in the beginning, when you took me for a turn? you used to hold the chair too high. at every step you nearly tipped me out.
(with senile quaver.)
ah great fun, we had, the two of us, great fun.
(gloomily.)
and then we got into the way of it.
(clov stops the chair under window right.)
there already?

then how can it end?
hamm:
you want it to end?
clov:
i want to sing.
hamm:
i can't prevent you.
(pause. clov turns towards window right.)
clov:
what did i do with that steps?
(he looks around for ladder.)
you didn't see that steps?
(he sees it.)
ah, about time.
(he goes towards window left.)
sometimes i wonder if i'm in my right mind. then it passes over and i'm as lucid as before.
(he gets up on ladder, looks out of window.)
christ, she's under water!
(he looks.)
how can that be?
(he pokes forward his head, his hand above his eyes.)
it hasn't rained.

ah what a fool i am! i'm on the wrong side!

under water!
(he goes back for ladder.)
what a fool i am!
(he carries ladder towards window right.)
sometimes i wonder if i'm in my right senses. then it passes off and i'm as intelligent as ever.
(he sets down ladder under window right, gets up on it, looks out of window. he turns towards hamm.)
any particular sector you fancy? or merely the whole thing?
hamm:
whole thing.
clov:
the general effect? just a moment.
(he looks out of window. pause.)
hamm:
clov.
clov (absorbed):
mmm.
hamm:
do you know what it is?
clov (as before):
mmm.
hamm:
i was never there.
(pause.)
clov!
clov (turning towards hamm, exasperated):
what is it?
hamm:
i was never there.
clov:
lucky for you.
(he looks out of window.)
hamm:
absent, always. it all happened without me. i don't know what's happened.
(pause.)
do you know what's happened?

 you want me to look at this muckheap, yes or no?
hamm:
answer me first.
clov:
what?
hamm:
do you know what's happened?
clov:
when? where?
hamm (violently):
when! what's happened? use your head, can't you! what has happened?
clov:
what for christ's sake does it matter?
(he looks out of window.)
hamm:
i don't know.
(pause. clov turns towards hamm.)
clov (harshly):
when old mother pegg asked you for oil for her lamp and you told her to get out to hell, you knew what was happening then, no?
(pause.)
you know what she died of, mother pegg? of darkness.
hamm (feebly):
i hadn't any.
clov (as before):
yes, you had.
(pause.)
hamm:
have you the glass?
clov:
no, it's clear enough as it is.
hamm:
go and get it.
(pause. clov casts up his eyes, brandishes his fists. he loses balance, clutches on to the ladder. he starts to get down, halts.)
clov:
there's

one thing i'll never understand.
(he gets down.)
why i always obey you. can you explain that to me?
hamm:
no... perhaps it's compassion.
(pause.)
a kind of great compassion.
(pause.)
oh you won't find it easy, you won't find it easy.
(pause. clov begins to move about the room in search of the telescope.)
clov:
i'm tired of our goings on, very tired.
(he searches.)
you're not sitting on it?
(he moves the chair, looks at the place where it stood, resumes his search.)
hamm (anguished):
don't leave me there!
(angrily clov restores the chair to its place.)
am i right in the center?
clov:
you'd need a microscope to find this—
(he sees the telescope.)
ah, about time.
(he picks up the telescope, gets up on the ladder, turns the telescope on the without.)
hamm:
give me the dog.
clov (looking):
quiet!
hamm

(angrily):

(clov drops the telescope, clasps his hands to his head. pause. he gets down precipitately, looks for the dog, sees it, picks it up, hastens towards hamm and strikes him violently on the head with the dog.)
clov:
there's your dog for you.
(the dog falls to the ground. pause.)
hamm:
he hit me!
clov:
you drive me mad, i'm mad!
hamm:
if you must hit me, hit me with the axe.
(pause.)
or with the gaff, hit me with the gaff. not with the dog. with the gaff. or with the axe.
(clov picks up the dog and gives it to hamm who takes it in his arms.)
clov (impatiently):
let's stop playing!
hamm:
never!
(pause.)
put me in my coffin.
clov:
there are no more coffins.
hamm:
then let it end!
(clov goes towards ladder.)
with a bang!

clov (lowering the telescope, turning towards hamm):
what?
(pause.)
is it me you're referring to?
hamm (angrily):
an aside, ape! did you never hear an aside before?
(pause.)
i'm warming up for my last soliloquy.
clov:
i warn you. i'm going to look at this filth since it's an order. but it's the last time.
(he turns the telescope on the without.)
let's see.
(he moves the telescope.)
nothing... nothing... good... good... nothing... goo—
(he starts, lowers the telescope, examines it, turns it again on the without. pause.)
bad luck to it!
hamm:
more complications!
(clov gets down.)
not an underplot, i trust.
(clov moves ladder nearer window, gets up on it, turns telescope on the without.)

(he gets down, drops the telescope, goes towards door, turns.)
i'll take the gaff.
(he looks for the gaff, sees it, picks it up, hastens towards door.)
hamm:
no!
(clov halts.)
clov:
no? a potential procreator?
hamm:
if he exists he'll die there or he'll come here. and if he doesn't...
(pause.)
clov:
you don't believe me? you think i'm inventing?
(pause.)
hamm:
it's the end, clov, we've come to the end. i don't need you any more.
(pause.)
clov:
lucky for you.
(he goes towards door.)
hamm:
leave me the gaff.
(clov gives him the gaff, goes towards door, halts, looks at alarm-clock, takes it down, looks round for a better place to put it, goes to bins, puts it on lid of nagg's bin. pause.)
clov:
i'll leave you.
(he goes towards door.)
hamm:
before you go...
(clov halts near door.)
...say something.
clov:
there is nothing to say.
hamm:

clov... he never spoke to me. then, in the end, before he went, without my having asked him, he spoke to me. he said...
clov (despairingly):
ah...!
hamm:
something... from your heart.
clov:
my heart!
hamm:

clov (fixed gaze, tonelessly, towards auditorium):
they said to me, that's love, yes, yes, not a doubt, now you see how—
hamm:
articulate!
clov (as before):
how easy it is. they said to me, that's friendship, yes, yes, no question, you've found it. they said to me, here's the place, stop, raise your head and look at all that beauty. that order! they said to me, come now, you're not a brute beast, think upon these things and you'll see how all becomes clear. and simple! they said to me, what skille

i say to myself— sometimes, clov, you must learn to suffer better than that if you want them to weary of punishing you— one day. i say to myself—sometimes, clov, you must be better than that if you want them to let you go—one day. but i feel too old, and too far, to form new habits. good, it'll never end, i'll never go.
