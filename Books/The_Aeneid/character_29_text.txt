  all were attentive to the godlike man,
  when from his lofty couch he thus began:
  "great queen, what you command me to relate
  renews the sad remembrance of our fate:
  an empire from its old foundations rent,
  and ev'ry woe the trojans underwent;
  a peopled city made a desart place;
  all that i saw, and part of which i was:
  not ev'n the hardest of our foes could hear,
  nor stern ulysses tell without a tear.
  and now the latter watch of wasting night,
  and setting stars, to kindly rest invite;
  but, since you take such int'rest in our woe,
  and troy's disastrous end desire to know,
  i will restrain my tears, and briefly tell
  what in our last and fatal night befell.

  "by destiny compell'd, and in despair,
  the greeks grew weary of the tedious war,
  and by minerva's aid a fabric rear'd,
  which like a steed of monstrous height appear'd:
  the sides were plank'd with pi

  laocoon, follow'd by a num'rous crowd,
  ran from the fort, and cried, from far, aloud:
  'o wretched countrymen! what fury reigns?
  what more than madness has possess'd your brains?
  think you the grecians from your coasts are gone?
  and are ulysses' arts no better known?
  this hollow fabric either must inclose,
  within its blind recess, our secret foes;
  or 't is an engine rais'd above the town,
  t' o'erlook the walls, and then to batter down.
  somewhat is sure design'd, by fraud or force:
  trust not their presents, nor admit the horse.'
  thus having said, against the steed he threw
  his forceful spear, which, hissing as flew,
  pierc'd thro' the yielding planks of jointed wood,
  and trembling in the hollow belly stood.

  because these fatal wars he would prevent;
  whose death the wretched greeks too late lament-
  me, then a boy, my father, poor and bare
  of other means, committed to his care,
  his kinsman and companion in the war.
  while fortune favor'd, while his arms support
  the cause, and rul'd the counsels, of the court,
  i made some figure there; nor was my name
  obscure, nor i without my share of fame.
  but when ulysses, with fallacious arts,
  had made impression in the people's hearts,
  and forg'd a treason in my patron's name
  (i speak of things too far divulg'd by fame),
  my kinsman fell. then i, without support,
  in private mourn'd his loss, and left the court.
  mad as i was, i could not bear his fate
  with silent grief, but loudly blam'd the state,
  and curs'd the direful author of my woes.

 meteors, hung in air, were seen,
  and thunders rattled thro' a sky serene.
  dismay'd, and fearful of some dire event,
  eurypylus t' enquire their fate was sent.
  he from the gods this dreadful answer brought:

  "o grecians, when the trojan shores you sought,
  your passage with a virgin's blood was bought:
  so must your safe return be bought again,
  and grecian blood once more atone the main."
  the spreading rumor round the people ran;
  all fear'd, and each believ'd himself the man.
  ulysses took th' advantage of their fright;
  call'd calchas, and produc'd in open sight:
  then bade him name the wretch, ordain'd by fate
  the public victim, to redeem the state.
  already some presag'd the dire event,
  and saw what sacrifice ulysses meant.
  for twice five days the good old seer withstood
  th' intended treason, and was dumb to blood,
  till, tir'd, with endless clamors and pursuit
  of ithacus, he stood no longer mute;
  but, as it was agreed, pronounc'd that i

  the grecian hopes, and all th' attempts they made,

  but from the time when impious diomede,
  and false ulysses, that inventive head,
  her fatal image from the temple drew,
  the sleeping guardians of the castle slew,
  her virgin statue with their bloody hands
  polluted, and profan'd her holy bands;
  from thence the tide of fortune left their shore,
  and ebb'd much faster than it flow'd before:
  their courage languish'd, as their hopes decay'd;

  and guided by th' imperial galley's light;

  with some small glimpse of hope to find her there.
  instead of her, the cruel greeks i met;
  the house was fill'd with foes, with flames beset.
  driv'n on the wings of winds, whole sheets of fire,
  thro' air transported, to the roofs aspire.
  from thence to priam's palace i resort,
  and search the citadel and desart court.
  then, unobserv'd, i pass by juno's church:
  a guard of grecians had possess'd the porch;
  there phoenix and ulysses watch prey,
  and thither all the wealth of troy convey:
  the spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,
  and golden bowls from burning altars caught,
  the tables of the gods, the purple vests,
  the people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.

  we fly from ithaca's detested shore,
  and curse the land which dire ulysses bore.
  at length leucate's cloudy top appears,
  and the sun's temple, which the sailor fears.
  resolv'd to breathe a while from labor past,
  our crooked anchors from the prow we cast,
  and joyful to the little city haste.
  here, safe beyond our hopes, our vows we pay

  he seiz'd two captives of our grecian band;
  stretch'd on his back, he dash'd against the stones
  their broken bodies, and their crackling bones:
  with spouting blood the purple pavement swims,
  while the dire glutton grinds the trembling limbs.

  "'not unreveng'd ulysses bore their fate,

  his indigested foam, and morsels raw;
  we pray; we cast the lots, and then surround

  "twice-conquer'd cowards, now your shame is shown-

  thus threat you war? thus our alliance force?
  what gods, what madness, hether steer'd your course?
  you shall not find the sons of atreus here,

  there bath'd amid the stream, our boys we hold,
