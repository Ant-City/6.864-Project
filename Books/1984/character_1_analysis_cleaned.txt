[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] is winston's lover and the only other person who
winston can be sure hates the party and wishes to rebel against
it as he does. whereas winston is restless, fatalistic, and concerned
about large-scale social issues, [CHARACTER] is sensual, pragmatic, and
generally content to live in the moment and make the best of her
life. winston longs to join the brotherhood and read emmanuel goldstein's
abstract manifesto; [CHARACTER] is more concerned with enjoying sex and
making practical plans to avoid getting caught by the party. winston
essentially sees their affair as temporary; his fatalistic attitude
makes him unable to imagine his relationship with [CHARACTER] lasting
very long. [CHARACTER], on the other hand, is well adapted to her chosen
forms of small-scale rebellion. she claims to have had affairs with
various party members, and has no intention of terminating her pleasure
seeking, or of being caught (her involvement with winston is what
leads to her capture). [CHARACTER] is a striking contrast to winston:
apart from their mutual sexual desire and hatred of the party, most
of their traits are dissimilar, if not contradictory.
