Appetite - 
                Appetite
is the largest aspect of our tripartite soul. It is the seat of
all our various desires for food, drink, sexual gratification, and
other such pleasures. It contains both necessary desires, which
should be indulged (such as the desire to eat enough to stay alive),
unnecessary desires, which should be limited (such as the desire
to eat a ten pound sirloin steak at every meal), and unlawful desires,
which should be suppressed at all costs (such as the desire to eat
one's children). Though the appetite lusts after many things, Plato
dubs it "money-loving," since money is required for 
satisfying most of these desires. In a just man, the appetite is
strictly controlled by reason and reason's henchman, spirit.
