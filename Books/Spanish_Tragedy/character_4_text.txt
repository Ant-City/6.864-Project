t my love and me;
    for in the late conflict with portingal
    my valour drew me into danger's mouth
    till life to death made passage through my wounds.
    when i was slain, my soul descended straight
    to pass the flowing stream of acheron;
    but churlish charon, only boatman there,
    said that, my rites of burial not perform'd,
    i might not sit amongst his passengers.
    ere sol had slept three nights in thetis' lap,
    and slak'd his smoking chariot in her flood,
    by don horatio, our knight-marshall's son,
    my funerals and obsequies were done.
    then was the ferryman of hell content
    to pass me over to the slimy strand
    that leads to fell avernus' ugly waves.
    there, pleasing cerberus with honeyed speech,
    i passed the perils of the foremost porch.
    not far from hence, amidst ten thousand souls,
    sat minos, eacus and rhadamant;
    to whom no sooner 'gan i make approach,
    to crave a passport for my wandering ghost,
    but minos in graven leav

    in their main battle made so great a breach
    that, half dismay'd, the multitude retir'd.
    but balthazar, the portingales' young prince,
    brought rescue and encourag'd them to stay.
    here-hence the fight was eagerly renew'd,
    and in that conflict was andrea slain,--
    brave man-at-arms, but weak to balthazar.
    yet, while the prince, insulting over him,
    breath'd out proud vaunts, sounding to our reproach,
    friendship and hardy valour join'd in one
    prick'd forth horatio, our knight-marshall's son,
    to challenge forth that prince in single fight.
    not long between these twain the fight endur'd,
    but straight the prince was beaten from his horse
    and forc'd to yield him prisoner to his foe.
    when he was taken, all the rest fled,
    and our carbines pursu'd them to death,
    till, phoebus waning to the western deep,
    our trumpeters were charg'd to sound retreat.

  king.  thanks, good lord general, for these good news!
    and, for some argume

 this warning of this trumpet's sound?

  gen.  this tells me that your grace's men of war,
    such as war's fortune hath reserv'd from death,
    come marching on towards your royal seat,
    to show themselves before your majesty;
    for so gave i in charge at my depart.
    whereby by demonstration shall appear
    that all, except three hundred or few more,
    are safe return'd and by their foes enrich'd.

                  the army enters, balthazar between lorenzo
                  and horatio, captive.

  king.  a gladsome sight!  i long to see them here.

                  they enter and pass by.

    was that the warlike prince of portingal
    that by our nephew was in triumph led?

  gen.  it was, my liege, the prince of portingal.

  king.  but what was he that on the other side
    held him by th' arm as partner of the prize?

  hiero.  that was my son, my gracious sovereign;
    of whom though from his tender infancy
    my loving thoughts did never hope but well,
    he neve

our victory thou have a share
    by virtue of thy worthy son's exploit.

                  enter again.

    bring hither the young prince of portingal!
    the rest march on, but, ere they be dismiss'd,
    we will bestow on every soldier
    two ducats, and on every leader ten,
    that they may know our largesse welcomes them.

                  exeunt all [the army] but bal[thazar],
                  lor[enzo], and hor[atio].

  king.  welcome, don balthazar!  welcome nephew!
    and thou, horatio, thou art welcome too!
    young prince, although thy father's hard misdeeds
    in keeping back the tribute that he owes
    deserve but evil measure at our hands,
    yet shalt thou know that spain is honourable.

  balt.  the trespass that my father made in peace
    is now controll'd by fortune of the wars;
    and cards once dealt, it boots not ask why so.
    his men are slain,--a weakening to his realm;
    his colours seiz'd,--a blot unto his name;
    his son distress'd,--a corsive to

         let him go.

    say, worthy prince:  to whether didst thou yield?

  balt.  to him in courtesy; to this perforce;
    he spake me fair, this other gave me strokes;
    he promis'd life, this other threaten'd death;
    he won my love, this other conquer'd me;
    and, truth to say, i yield myself to both.

  hiero.  but that i know your grace is just and wise,
    and might seem partial in this difference,
    enforc'd by nature and by law of arms,
    my tongue should plead for young horatio's right.
    he hunted well that was a lion's death,
    not he that in a garment wore his skin;
    so hares may pull dead lions by the beard.

  king.  content thee, marshall; thou shalt have no wrong,
    and for thy sake thy son shall want to right.
    will both abide the censure of my doom?

  lor.  i crave no better than your grace awards.

  hor.  nor i, although i sit beside my right.

  king.  then by judgment thus your strife shall end:
    you both deserve and both shall have reward

.
    nephew, thou took'st his weapons and his horse:
    his weapons and his horse are thy reward.
    horatio, thou did'st force him first to yield:
    his ransom therefore is thy valour's fee;
    appoint the sum as you shall both agree.
    but, nephew, thou shalt have the prince in guard,
    for thine estate best fitteth such a guest;
    horatio's house were small for all his train.
    yet, in regard thy substance passeth his,
    and that just guerdon may befall desert,
    to him we yield the armour of the prince.
    how likes don balthazar of this device?

  balt.  right well, my liege, if this proviso were:
    that don horatio bear us company,
    whom i admire and love for chivalry.

  king.  horatio, leave him not that loves thee so.
    now let us hence, to see our soldiers paid,
    and feast our prisoner as our friendly gue

    keep him till we determine his death.
    if balthazar be dead, he shall not live.

                 [they take him out.]

    villuppo, follow us for thy reward.

                 exit vice[roy].

  villup.  thus have i with an envious forged tale
    deceiv'd the king, betray'd mine enemy,
    and hope for guerdon of my villainy.



[act i.  scene 3.]

                [spain: the palace]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  bel.  signior horatio, this is the place and hour
    wherein i must entreat thee to relate
    the circumstance of don andrea's death,
    who living was my garland's sweetest flower,
    and in his death hath buried my delights.

  hor.  for love of him and service to yourself,
    i'll not refuse this heavy doleful charge;
    yet tears and sighs, i fear, will hinder me.
    when both our armies were enjoin'd in fight,
    your worthy cavalier amidst the thickest,
    for

  this scarf i pluck'd from off his lifeless arm,
    and wear it in remembrance of my friend.

  bel.  i know the scarf: would he had kept it still!
    for, had he liv'd, he would have kept it still,
    and worn it for his bel-imperia's sake;
    for 'twas my favour at his last depart.
    but now wear thou it both for him and me;
    for, after him, thou hast deserv'd it best.
    but, for thy kindness in his life and death,
    be sure, while bel-imperia's life endures,
    she will be don horatio's thankful friend.

  hor.  and, madame, don horatio will not slack
    humbly to serve fair bel-imperia.
    but now, if your good liking stand thereto,
    i'll crave your pardon to go seek the prince;
    for so the duke, your father, gave me charge.

                exit.

  bel.  aye, go, horatio; leave me here alone,
    for solitude best fits my cheerless mood.--
    yet what avails to wail andreas death,
    from whence horatio proves my second love?
    had he not lov'd andrea as he di

    he could not sit in bel-imperia's thoughts.
    but how can love find harbour in my breast,
    till i revenge the death of my belov'd?
    yes, second love shall further my revenge:
    i'll love horatio, my andrea's friend,
    the more to spite the prince that wrought his end;
    and, where don balthazar, that slew my love,
    himself now pleads for favor at my hands,
    he shall, in rigour of my just disdain,
    reap long repentance for his murderous deed,--
    for what was't else but murderous cowardice,
    so many to oppress one valiant knight,
    without respect of honour in the fight?
    and here he comes that murder'd my delight.

                enter lorenzo and balthazar.

t her with your love.

  bel.  what boots complaint, when there's no remedy?

  bal.  yes, to your gracious self must i complain,
    in whose fair answer lies my remedy,
    on whose perfection all my thoughts attend,
    on whose aspect mine eyes find beauty's bower,
    in whose translucent breast my heart is lodg'd.

  bel. alas, my lord! these are but words of course,
    and but devis'd to drive me from this place.

                she, going in, lets fall her glove, which
                horatio, coming out, takes up.

  hor.  madame, your glove.

  bel.  thanks, good horatio; take it for thy pains.

                [bel-imperia exits.]

  bal.  signior horatio stoop'd in happy time!

  hor.  i reap'd more grace that i deserv'd or hop'd.

  lor.  my lord, be not dismay'd for what is past;
    you know that women oft are humorous:
    these clouds will overblow with little wind;
    let me alone, i'll scatter them myself.
    meanwhile let us devise to spend the time
    in some delight
 
 ___________________________
 
l. [aside]  so am i, slain by beauty's tyranny!--
    you see, my lord, how balthazar is slain:
    i frolic with the duke of castille's son,
    wrapp'd every hour in pleasures of the court,
    and grac'd with favours of his majesty.

  king.  put off your greetings till our feast be done;
    now come and sit with us, and taste our cheer.

                sit to the banquet.

    sit down, young prince, you are our second guest;
    brother, sit down; and nephew, take your place.
    signior horatio, wait thou upon our cup,
    for well thou hast deserved to be honour'd.
    now, lordings, fall too: spain is portugal,
    and portugal is spain; we both are friends;
    tribute is paid, and we enjoy our right.
    but where is old hieronimo, our marshall?
    he promis'd us, in honour of our guest,
    to grace our banquet with some pompous jest.

                enter hieronimo with a drum, three knights,
                each with scutcheon; then he fetches three
                kings; the
 
 ___________________________
 
his scutcheon plainly may appear:
    he with a puissant army came to spain
    and took our king of castille prisoner.

  ambass.  this is an argument for our viceroy
    that spain may not insult for her success,
    since english warriors likewise conquer'd spain
    and made them bow their knees to albion.

  king.  hieronimo, i drink to thee for this device,
    which hath pleas'd both the ambassador and me:
    pledge me, hieronimo, if thou love the king!

                takes the cup of horatio.

    my lord, i fear we sit but over-long,
    unless our dainties were more delicate,--
    but welcome are you to the best we have.
    now let us in, that you may be dispatch'd;
    i think our council is already set.

                exeunt omnes.

                [chorus.]

  andrea.  come we for this from depth of under ground,--
    to see him feast that gave me my death's wound?
    these pleasant sights are sorrow to my soul:
    nothing but league and love and banqueting!

  revenge.

friendship cannot win.
    thy death shall bury what thy life conceals.
    thou die'st for more esteeming her than me!

                [draws his sword.]

  ped.  oh stay, my lord!

  lor.  yet speak the truth, and i will guerdon thee
    and shield thee from whatever can ensue,
    and will conceal whate'er proceeds from thee;
    but, if thou dally once again, thou diest!

  ped.  if madame bel-imperia be in love--

  lor.  what, villain!  ifs and ands?

  ped.  oh stay, my lord!  she loves horatio!

                balthazar starts back.

  lor.  what!  don horatio, our knight-marshall's son?

  ped. even him, my lord.

  lor.  now say but how know'st thou he is her love,
    and thou shalt find me kind and liberal.
    stand up, i say, and fearless tell the truth.

  ped.  she sent him letters,--which myself perus'd,--
    full-fraught with lines and arguments of love,
    preferring him before prince balthazar.

  lor.  swear on this cross that what thou say'st is true,
    and that th

 armis quam ingenio:
    where words prevail not, violence prevails.
    but gold doth more than either of them both.
    how likes prince balthazar this stratagem?

  bal.  both well and ill; it makes me glad and sad:
    glad, that i know the hind'rer of my love;
    sad, that i fear she hates me whom i love;
    glad, that i know on whom to be reveng'd;
    sad, that she'll fly me if i take revenge.
    yet must i take revenge or die myself;
    for love resisted grows impatient.
    i think horatio be my destin'd plague:
    first, in his hand he brandished a sword,
    and with that sword he fiercely waged war,
    and in that war he gave me dangerous wounds,
    and by those wounds he forced me to yield,
    and by my yielding i became his slave;
    now, in his mouth he carries pleasing words,
    which pleasing words do harbour sweet conceits,
    which sweet conceits are lim'd with sly deceits,
    which sly deceits smooth bel-imperia's ears,
    and through her ears dive down into h

er heart,
    and in her heart set him, where i should stand.
    thus hath he ta'en my body by his force,
    and now by sleight would captivate my soul;
    but in his fall i'll tempt the destinies,
    and either lose my life or win my love.

  lor. let's go, my lord;  our staying stays revenge.
    do but follow me, and gain your love;
    her favour must be won by his remove.

                exeunt.




[act ii.  scene 2.]

[the duke's castle]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  hor.  now, madame, since by favour of your love
    our hidden smoke is turn'd to open flame,
    and that with looks and words we feed our thought,--
    two chief contents where more cannot be had,--
    thus in the midst of love's fair blandishments
    why show you sign of inward languishments?

                pedringano showeth all to the prince and
                lorenzo, placing them in secret.

  bel.  my heart, sweet friend, is like a ship at sea:
    she wisheth

    there to repair the joys that it hath lost,
    and, sitting safe, to sing in cupid's choir
    that sweetest bliss is crown of love's desire.

                balthazar, above.

  bal.  o sleep, mine eyes; see not my love profan'd!
    be deaf, my ears; hear not my discontent!
    die, heart; another joys what thou deserv'st!

  lor.  watch still, mine eyes, to see this love disjoin'd!
    hear still, mine ears, to hear them both lament!
    live, heart, to joy at fond horatio's fall!

  bel.  why stands horatio speechless all this while?

  hor.  the less i speak, the more i meditate.

  bel.  but whereon dost thou chiefly meditate?

  hor.  on dangers past and pleasures to ensue.

  bal. on pleasures past and dangers to ensue!

  bel.  what dangers and what pleasures dost thou mean?

  hor.  dangers of war and pleasures of our love.

  lor.  dangers of death, but pleasures none at all!

  bel. let dangers go; thy war shall be with me,
    but such a war as breaks n

  king.  commend me to the king; and so, farewell!
    but where's prince balthazar, to take his leave?

  ambass.  that is perform'd already, my good lord.

  king.  amongst the rest of what you have in charge,
    the prince's ransom must not be forgot:
    that's none of mine, but his that took him prisoner,--
    and well his forwardness deserves reward:
    it was horatio, our knight-marshall's son.

  ambass.  between us there's a price already pitch'd,
    and shall be sentwith all convenient speed.

  king.  then once again farewell, my lord!

  ambass.  farwell, my lord of castile, and the rest!

                exit.

  king.  now, brother, you must make some little pains
    to win fair bel-imperia from her will;
    young virgins must be ruled by their friends.
    the prince is amiable, and loves her well;
    if she neglect him and forgo his love,

he both will wrong her own estate and ours.
    therefore, whiles i do entertain the prince
    with greatest pleasure that our court affords,
    endeavor you to win your daughter's thought.
    if she give back, all this will come to naught.

    to over-cloud the brightness of the sun,

    come, bel-imperia, let us to the bower,
    and there is safety pass a pleasant hour.

  bel.  i follow thee, my love, and will not back,
    although my fainting heart controls my soul.

    the stars, thou see'st, hold back their twinkling shine

  bel. thou hast prevail'd!  i'll conquer my misdoubt,
    and in thy love and counsel drown my fear.
    i fear no more; love now is all my thoughts!
    why sit we not? for pleasure asketh ease.

  hor.  the more thou sitt'st within these leafy bowers,
    the more will flora deck it with her flowers.

  bel. aye; but, if flora spy horatio here,
    her jealous eye will think i sit too near.

  hor.  hark, madame, how the birds record by night,
    for joy that bel-imperia sits in sight!

  bel.  no; cupid counterfeits the nightingale,
    to frame sweet music to horatio's tale.

  hor.  if cupid sing, then venus is not far,--
    aye, thou art venus, or some fairer star!

  bel.  if i be venus, thou must needs be mars;
    and where mars reigneth, there must needs be wars.

    a letter for hieronimo.

    what cause had they horatio to malign?
    or what might move thee, bel-imperia,
    to accuse thy brother, had he been the mean?
    hieronimo, beware!  thou art betray'd,
    and to entrap thy life this train is laid.
    advise thee therefore, be not credulous:

    that thou, by this, lorenzo should'st accuse.

    ah, nay;  thou dost delay their deaths,
    forgiv'st the murd'rers of thy noble son;
    and none but i bestir me,--to no end!
    and, as i curse this tree from further fruit,
    so shall my womb be cursed for his sake;
    and with this weapon will i wound this breast,--
    that hapless breast that gave horatio suck!

d, died, yea, all decay'd with this.
    from forth these wounds came breath that gave me life;
    they murder'd me that made these fatal marks.
    the cause was love whence grew this mortal hate:
    the hate, lorenzo and young balthazar;
    the love, my son to bel-imperia.
    but night, the cov'rer of accursed crimes,
    with pitchy silence hush'd these traitors' harms,
    and lent them leave--for they had sorted leisure--
    to take advantage in my garden plot
    upon my son, my dear horatio.
    there merciless they butcher'd up my boy,
    in black, dark night, to pale, dim, cruel death!
    he shrieks; i heard--and yet, methinks, i hear--
    his dismal out-cry echo in the air;
    with soonest speed i hasted to the noise,
    where, hanging on a tree, i found my son
    through-girt with wounds and slaughter'd, as you see.
    and griev'd i, think you, at this spectacle?

    and you, my lord, whose reconciled son
    march'd in a net and thought himself unseen,
    and rated me for a brainsick lunacy,
    with "god amend that mad hieronimo!"--
    how can you brook our play's catastrophe?
    and here behold this bloody handkerchief,
    which at horatio's death i weeping dipp'd
    within the river of his bleeding wounds!
    it as propitious, see, i have reserv'd,
    and never hath it left my bloody heart,
    soliciting remembrance of my vow
    with these, o these accursed murderers!
    which now perform'd, my heart is satisfied.
    and to this end the bashaw i became,
    that might revenge me on lorenzo's life,
    who therefore was appointed to the part
    and was to represent the knight of rhodes,
    that i might kill him more conv

r, thou shalt have no harm!

  hiero.  viceroy, i will not trust thee with my life,
    which i this day have offer'd to my son:
    accursed wretch, why stayst thou him that was resolv'd to die?

  king.  speak, traitor!  damned, bloody murd'rer, speak!--
    for, now i have thee, i will make thee speak!
    why hast thou done this undeserving deed?

  vice.  why hast thou murdered my balthazar?

  cas.  why hast thou butcher'd both my children thus?

  hiero.  o good words!  as dear to me was horatio
    as yours, or yours, my lord, to you.
    my guiltless son was by lorenzo slain;
    and by lorenzo and that balthazar
    am i at last revenged thoroughly,--
    upon whose souls may heav'n be yet aveng'd
    with greater far than these afflictions!

  cas.  but who were thy confederates in this?

  vice.  that was thy daughter bel-imperia;
    for by her hand my balthazar was slain,--
    i saw her stab him.

  king.         why speak'st thou not?

  hiero.  what lesser liberty can kings a

    sufficeth i may not nor i will not tell thee.

  king.  fetch forth the tortures!
         traitor as thou art, i'll make thee tell!

  hiero.                indeed?
    thou mayst torment me as his wretched son
    hath done in murd'ring my horatio;
    but never shalt thou force me to reveal
    the thing which i have vow'd inviolate.
    and therefore, in despite of all thy threats,
    pleas'd with their deaths, and eas'd with their revenge,
    first take my tongue, and afterwards my heart!

                he bites out his tongue.

  king. o monstrous resolution of a wretch!
    see, viceroy, he hath bitten forth his tongue
    rather than reveal what we require'd.

                the trumpets sound a dead march, the king of spain

[chorus.]

                enter ghost and revenge.

  ghost.  aye; now my hopes have end in their effects,
    when blood and sorrow finish my desires:
    horatio murder'd in his father's bower,
    vile serberine by pedrigano slain,
    false pedrigano hang'd by quaint device,
    fair isabella by herself misdone,
    prince balthazar by bel-imperia stabb'd,
    the duke of castile and his wicked son
    both done to death by old hieronimo,
    my bel-imperia fallen as dido fell,
    and good hieronimo slain by himself!
    aye, these were spectacles to please my soul.
    now will i beg at lovely proserpine
    that, by the virtue of her princely doom,

    i may consort my friends in pleasing sort,
    and on my foes work just and sharp revenge.
    i'll lead my friend horatio through those fields
    where never-dying wars are still inur'd;
    i'll lead fair isabella to that train
    where pity weeps but never feeleth pain;
    i'll lead my bel-imperia to those joys
    that vestal virgins and fair queens possess;
    i'll lead hieronimo where orpheus plays,
    adding sweet pleasure to eternal days.
    but say, revenge,--for thou must help or none,--
    against the rest how shall my hate be shown?

  revenge.  this hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,
