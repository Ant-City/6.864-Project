 very
thought of it burnt him like fire. he got out his worldly wealth and
examined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange
of _work_, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour
of pure freedom. so he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and
gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. at this dark and hopeless
moment an inspiration burst upon him! nothing less than a great,
magnificent inspiration.

he took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. ben rogers hove in
sight presently--the very boy, of all boys, whose ridicule he had been
dreading. benï¿½s gait was the hop-skip-and-jump--proof enough that his
heart was light and his anticipations high. he was eating an apple, and
giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep-toned
ding-dong-dong, ding-dong-dong, for he was personating a steamboat. as
he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned
far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with labo

ï¿½hello, huckleberry!ï¿½

 was interested in nothing. when he got
upon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown, a melancholy change had
come over everything and every creature. there had been a ï¿½revival,ï¿½ and
everybody had ï¿½got religion,ï¿½ not only the adults, but even the boys and
girls. tom went about, hoping against hope for the sight of one blessed
sinful face, but disappointment crossed him everywhere. he found joe
harper studying a testament, and turned sadly away from the depressing
spectacle. he sought ben rogers, and found him visiting the poor with a
basket of tracts. he hunted up jim hollis, who called his attention to
the precious blessing of his late measles as a warning. every boy
he encountered added another ton to his depression; and when, in
desperation, he flew for refuge at last to the bosom of huckleberry finn
and was received with a scriptural quotation, his heart broke and he
crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of all the town was lost,
forever and forever.

and gone home, tom felt just as insecure as he was before.

the slow days drifted on, and each left behind it a slightly lightened
weight of apprehension.




chapter xxv

there comes a time in every rightly-constructed boyï¿½s life when he has
a raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. this desire
suddenly came upon tom one day. he sallied out to find joe harper,
but failed of success. next he sought ben rogers; he had gone fishing.
presently he stumbled upon huck finn the red-handed. huck would
answer. tom took him to a private place and opened the matter to him
confidentially. huck was willing. huck was always willing to take a hand
in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required no capital,
for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of time which is
not money. ï¿½whereï¿½ll we dig?ï¿½ said huck.

ï¿½oh, most anywhere.ï¿½

ï¿½why, is it hid all around?ï¿½

ï¿½no, indeed it ainï¿½

block and maow--and if iï¿½m asleep, you throw some gravel at the window
and thatï¿½ll fetch me.ï¿½

ï¿½agreed, and good as wheat!ï¿½

ï¿½now, huck, the stormï¿½s over, and iï¿½ll go home. itï¿½ll begin to be
daylight in a couple of hours. you go back and watch that long, will
you?ï¿½

ï¿½i said i would, tom, and i will. iï¿½ll haï¿½nt that tavern every night for
a year! iï¿½ll sleep all day and iï¿½ll stand watch all night.ï¿½

ï¿½thatï¿½s all right. now, where you going to sleep?ï¿½

ï¿½in ben rogersï¿½ hayloft. he lets me, and so does his papï¿½s nigger man,
uncle jake. i tote water for uncle jake whenever he wants me to, and any
time i ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he can spare it.
thatï¿½s a mighty good nigger, tom. he likes me, becuz i donï¿½t ever act as
if i was above him. sometime iï¿½ve set right down and eat _with_ him. but
you neednï¿½t tell that. a bodyï¿½s got to do things when heï¿½s awful hungry
he wouldnï¿½t want to do as a steady thing.ï¿½

huck searched all the place about, and found nothing. tom proudly
marched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and said:

ï¿½here you are! look at it, huck; itï¿½s the snuggest hole in this country.
you just keep mum about it. all along iï¿½ve been wanting to be a robber,
but i knew iï¿½d got to have a thing like this, and where to run across
it was the bother. weï¿½ve got it now, and weï¿½ll keep it quiet, only weï¿½ll
let joe harper and ben rogers in--because of course thereï¿½s got to be a
gang, or else there wouldnï¿½t be any style about it. tom sawyerï¿½s gang--it
sounds splendid, donï¿½t it, huck?ï¿½

ï¿½well, it just does, tom. and whoï¿½ll we rob?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, most anybody. waylay people--thatï¿½s mostly the way.ï¿½

ï¿½and kill them?ï¿½

ï¿½no, not always. hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s a ransom?ï¿½

ï¿½money. you make them raise all they can, offï¿½n their friends; and after
youï¿½ve kept them a yea
