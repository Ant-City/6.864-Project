gnorant of the different grades in the social
hierarchy, the fact that my father found it impossible for us to see
anything of swann's wife and daughter had, for a long time, had the
contrary effect of making me imagine them as separated from us by an
enormous gulf, which greatly enhanced their dignity and importance in
my eyes. i was sorry that my mother did not dye her hair and redden her
lips, as i had heard our neighbour, mme. sazerat, say that mme. swann
did, to gratify not her husband but m. de charlus; and i felt that, to
her, we must be an object of scorn, which distressed me particularly on
account of the daughter, such a pretty little girl, as i had heard, and
one of whom i used often to dream, always imagining her with the same
features and appearance, which i bestowed upon her quite arbitrarily,
but with a charming effect. but from this afternoon, when i had learned
that mlle. swann was a creature living in such rare and fortunate
circumstances, bathed, as in her natural element, in suc

ake excuses to his fashionable friends for not
paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her
that he sought to excuse himself to odette. he still paid them (asking
himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps
exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her,
it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each
visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some
information which she required, m. de charlus, whom he had met actually
going to her house, and who had insisted upon swann's accompanying him.
and, failing any excuse, he would beg m. de charlus to go to her
at once, and to tell her, as though spontaneously, in the course of
conversation, that he had just remembered something that he had to say
to swann, and would she please send a message to swann's house asking
him to come to her then and there; but as a rule swann waited at home
in vain, and m. de charlus informed him, later in the eve

himself with questions
to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the
strain of interrogation. it is true that swann was little the wiser for
such information as he did receive. to know a thing does not enable us,
always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know
we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can
dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of
power to control them. he was quite happy whenever m. de charlus was
with odette. he knew that between m. de charlus and her nothing untoward
could ever happen, that when m. de charlus went anywhere with her, it
was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty
about telling him everything that she had done. sometimes she had
declared so emphatically to swann that it was impossible for him to see
her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly
to some outing, that swann attached a very real importance to the fact

that m. de charlus was free to accompany her. next day, without daring
to put many questions to m. de charlus, he would force him, by appearing
not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each
of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very
soon learned that odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of
dissipations.

"but what do you mean, my dear mémé, i don't quite understand.... you
didn't go straight from her house to the musée grévin? surely you went
somewhere else first? no? that is very odd! you don't know how amusing
you are, my dear mémé.

, every now and then, she
forbade him to do. one day she announced that she did not care for his
coachman, who, she thought, was perhaps setting swann against her, and,
anyhow, did not shew that promptness and deference to swann's orders
which she would have liked to see. she felt that he wanted to hear her
say: "don't have him again when you come to me," just as he might have
wanted her to kiss him. so, being in a good temper, she said it; and he
was deeply moved. that evening, when talking to m. de charlus, with whom
he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the
most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never
heard of her, had always some sort of reference to odette), he said to
him:

"i believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now,
and she certainly takes an interest in what i do."

and if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his
carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way,
his friend said:

ee take; anything you can think of. i don't count upon
seeing her to-night, myself; still if she would like me to come, or
if you find a loophole, you've only to send me a line at mme. de
saint-euverte's up till midnight; after that i shall be here. ever so
many thanks for all you are doing for me--you know what i feel about
you!"

his friend promised to go and do as swann wished as soon as he had
deposited him at the door of the saint-euverte house, where he arrived
soothed by the thought that m. de charlus would be spending the evening
in the rue la pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to
everything that did not involve odette, and in particular to the details
of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is
to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire,
appears to us in its own guise. on alighting from his carriage, in the
foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which
hostesses are pleased to offer to their

invite me to dinner. anyhow, i'm going. listen, my dearest charles, now
that i have seen you, once in a blue moon, won't you let me carry you
off and take you to the princesse de parme's, who would be so pleased
to see you (you know), and basin too, for that matter; he's meeting me
there. if one didn't get news of you, sometimes, from mémé... remember,
i never see you at all now!"

swann declined. having told m. de charlus that, on leaving mme. de
saint-euverte's, he would go straight home, he did not care to run the
risk, by going on now to the princesse de parme's, of missing a message
which he had, all the time, been hoping to see brought in to him by one
of the footmen, during the party, and which he was perhaps going to find
left with his own porter, at home.

always charming, but he does look so dreadfully unhappy. you will see

is dream, he would thank heaven for those special
circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could
remain in odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow
him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages:
his social position--his fortune, from which she stood too often in
need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture
(having even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry
her)--his friendship with m. de charlus, which, it must be confessed,
had never won him any very great favour from odette, but which gave him
the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things
said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an
esteem--and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in
weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not
agreeable, at any rate necessary to odette--he thought of what might
have happened to him if all these advantages had

requented houses of ill-fame. he was tormented by the discovery that
there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of
sending him such a letter (for certain details betrayed in the writer a
familiarity with his private life). he wondered who it could be. but he
had never had any suspicion with regard to the unknown actions of other
people, those which had no visible connection with what they said.
and when he wanted to know whether it was rather beneath the apparent
character of m. de charlus, or of m. des laumes, or of m. d'orsan that
he must place the untravelled region in which this ignoble action might
have had its birth; as none of these men had ever, in conversation
with swann, suggested that he approved of anonymous letters, and as
everything that they had ever said to him implied that they strongly
disapproved, he saw no further reason for associating this infamy with
the character of any one of them more than with the rest. m. de charlus
was somewhat inclined to eccentricit

lthy woman, and that whenever
he thought of him he was obliged to set that evil reputation on one
side, as irreconcilable with so many unmistakable proofs of his genuine
sincerity and refinement. for a moment swann felt that his mind was
becoming clouded, and he thought of something else so as to recover
a little light; until he had the courage to return to those other
reflections. but then, after not having been able to suspect anyone, he
was forced to suspect everyone that he knew. after all, m. de charlus
might be most fond of him, might be most good-natured; but he was a
neuropath; to-morrow, perhaps, he would burst into tears on hearing that
swann was ill; and to-day, from jealousy, or in anger, or carried away
by some sudden idea, he might have wished to do him a deliberate injury.
really, that kind of man was the worst of all. the prince des laumes
was, certainly, far less devoted to swann than was m. de charlus. but
for that very reason he had not the same susceptibility with regard to
him;

 and besides, his was a nature which, though, no doubt, it was cold,
was as incapable of a base as of a magnanimous action. swann regretted
that he had formed no attachments in his life except to such people.
then he reflected that what prevents men from doing harm to their
neighbours is fellow-feeling, that he could not, in the last resort,
answer for any but men whose natures were analogous to his own, as was,
so far as the heart went, that of m. de charlus. the mere thought of
causing swann so much distress would have been revolting to him. but
with a man who was insensible, of another order of humanity, as was the
prince des laumes, how was one to foresee the actions to which he might
be led by the promptings of a different nature? to have a good heart was
everything, and m. de charlus had one. but m. d'orsan was not lacking
in that either, and his relations with swann--cordial, but scarcely
intimate, arising from the pleasure which, as they hel

about everything, they found in talking together--were more quiescent
than the enthusiastic affection of m. de charlus, who was apt to be
led into passionate activity, good or evil. if there was anyone by
whom swann felt that he had always been understood, and (with delicacy)
loved, it was m. d'orsan. yes, but the life he led; it could hardly be
called honourable. swann regretted that he had never taken any notice
of those rumours, that he himself had admitted, jestingly, that he had
never felt so keen a sense of sympathy, or of respect, as when he was
in thoroughly 'detrimental' society. "it is not for nothing

's, the noble's rather than the flunkey's. what criterion
ought one to adopt, in order to judge one's fellows? after all, there
was not a single one of the people whom he knew who might not, in
certain circumstances, prove capable of a shameful action. must he then
cease to see them all? his mind grew clouded; he passed his hands two
or three times across his brow, wiped his glasses with his handkerchief,
and remembering that, after all, men who were as good as himself
frequented the society of m. de charlus, the prince des laumes and
the rest, he persuaded himself that this meant, if not that they were
incapable of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human
life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people
who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. and he continued to
shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely
formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to
drive him to despair. as for the actual cont
