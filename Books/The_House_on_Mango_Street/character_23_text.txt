girl, my  friend, studies all  night and sees the mice, the ones 
her  father  says  do  not  exist.  is  afraid  of nothing  except 
four-legged  fur.  and fathers.

close your eyes and they'll  go away,  her father says, 
or you're just imagining. and anyway, a woman's place is 
sleeping so she can wake up early with the tortilla star, the 
one that  appears  early just in  time  to  rise  and  catch  the 
hind  legs  hide  behind  the  sink,  beneath  the  four-clawed 
tub,  under  the  swollen  aoorboards  nobody  fixes,  in  the 
corner of your eyes. 

alicia, whose mama died, is sorry there is no one older 

to rise and  make the lunchbox tortillas.  alicia,  who inher­
ited  her  mama's  rolling  pin  and  sleepiness,  is  young and 
smart and studies for the first  time at the university. two

the 
fanrily 

of little feet  • 

there was  a  family.  all  were little.  their arms were 
little,  and their hands were little, and their height was  not 
tall,  and  their feet  very small. 

the  grandpa  slept  on  the  living  room  couch  and 
snored  through  his  teeth.  his  feet  were  fat  and  doughy 
like thick tamales, and these he powdered and stuffed into 
white socks and  brown leather shoes. 

the  grandma's  feet  were  lovely  as  pink  pearls  and 
dressed  in  velvety  high  heels  that  made  her walk  with  a 
wobble,  but  she  wore  them  anyway  because  they  were 
pretty. 

the baby's feet had ten tiny toes, pale and see-through 

r i 

like  a  salamander's. and  these  he  popped  into  his  mouth 
whenever  he  was  hungry. 

the mother's feet,  plump and polite. descended like 
white  pigeons from  the sea of pillow,  across  the linoleum 
roses,  down down  the wooden stairs,  over the chalk  hop­
scotch squares,  5,6

er a while and i didn't know 
if i could sit down or not, and then i  started sitting down 
only when the two ladies next to me did. after a while they 
started  to  laugh  and came up to  me  and  said  i  could  sit 
when  i  wanted to,  and i  said  i  knew. 

when  lunchtime came,  i  was  scared  to eat alone  in 

the company lunchroom with all those men and ladies look­
ing, so i ate real fast standing in one of the washroom stalls 
and had lots of time left over, so i went back to work early. 
but then break time came, and not knowing where else to 
go,  i  went  into  the  coatroom  because  there  was  a  bench 
there. 

i  guess  it  was  the time  for  the  night shift or middle 
shift to arrive because a  few  people came in and punched 
the  time clock,  and an older oriental man said  hello  and

hold my  papa in my arms.  i  hold and hold and hold him.

your  abuelito  is  dead,  papa  says  early  one  morning 
in  my  room.  esta  muerto,  and then as  if he just heard the 
news himself, crumples like a coat and cries, my brave papa 
cries.  i  have never seen  my  papa cry and don't know what 
to do. 

i  know  he  will  have  to  go  away,  that  he  will  take  a 
plane to mexico, all the uncles and aunts will be there, and 
they  will  have  a  black-and-white  photo  taken  in  front  of

comes and goes  to work.  he has  two  little  black dogs that 
go  everywhere  with  him.  they  don't  walk.  like  ordinary 
dogs,  but  leap  and  somersault  like  an  apostrophe  and 
comma. 

at night nenny and i can hear when earl comes home 

from work. first the click and whine of the car door open­
ing, then the scrape of concrete, the excited tinkling of dog 
tags, followed by  the heavy jingling of keys, and finally  the 
moan of the wooden door as it opens and lets loose its sigh 
of dampness. 

earl is  a jukebox repairman.  he learned his  trade in 
the  south,  he  says.  he  speaks  with  a  southern  accent, 
smokes fat cigars and wears a felt hat-winter or summer, 
hot or cold, don't matter-a felt hat.  in h

boxes and boxes of 45 records,  moldy  and damp like  the 
smell that comes out of his apartment whenever he opens 
the door.  he gives the records away  to  us-all except the 
country and western. 

the word is that earl is married and has a wife some­

where. edna says she saw  her once when earl brought her 
to the apartment.  mama says  she is  a  skinny  thing,  blond 
and  pale  like  salamanders  that  have  never seen  the  sun. 
but i  saw  her once too and she's  not that way  at all.  and 
the boys  across the street say she is  a  tall  red-headed lady 
who  wears  tight  pink  pants  and  green  glasses.  we  never 
agree on what she looks like, but we do know  this.  when­
ever  she  arrives,  he  holds  her  tight  by  the  crook of the 
arm.  they  walk  fast  into  the

the 
earl of 
tennessee 

earl  lives  next door in edna's  basement,  behind  the 
flower boxes edna paints green each year, behind the dusty 
geraniums. we used to sit on the flower boxes until the day 
tito saw a cockroach with a spot of green paint on its head. 
now  we  sit  on  the steps  that swing around  the  basement 
apartment where earl lives. 

earl works nights. his blinds are always closed during 
the day. sometimes he comes out and tells us to keep quiet. 
the little wooden door that has wedged shut the dark for 
so  long  opens  with  a  sigh  and  lets  out  a  breath  of mold 
and  dampness,  like  books  that  have  been  left  out  in  the 
rain.  this is  the only time we  see earl except for when he

mamacita is the big mama of the man across the street, 

third-floor  front.  rachel  says  her  name  ought  to  be  ma­
masota,  but i  think that's  mean. 

the man saved his money to bring her here. he saved 
and saved because she was alone with  the baby boy in  that 
country.  he worked  two jobs.  he came home late and  he 
left early.  every day. 

then  one  day  mamacita  and  the  baby  boy  arrived 
in  a  yellow  taxi.  the  taxi  door  opened  like  a  waiter's 
arm.  out stepped  a  tiny  pink  shoe,  a  foot  soft  as  a  rab­
bit's  ear,  then  the  thick  ankle,  a  rutter  of  hips,  fuch­
sia  roses  and  green  perfume.  the man  had  to  pull  her,
