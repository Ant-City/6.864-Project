    should hold up high in brass; and such again
    as venerable nestor, hatch'd in silver,
    should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
    on which heaven rides, knit all the greekish ears
    to his experienc'd tongue-yet let it please both,
    thou great, and wise, to hear ulysses speak.
  agamemnon. speak, prince of ithaca; and be't of less expect
    that matter needless, of importless burden,
    divide thy lips than we are confident,
    when rank thersites opes his mastic jaws,
    we shall hear music, wit, and oracle.
  ulysses. troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
    and the great hector's sword had lack'd a master,
    but for these instances:
    the specialty of rule hath been neglected;
    and look how many grecian tents do stand
    hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
    when that the general is not like the hive,
    to whom the foragers shall all repair,
    what honey is expected? degree being vizarded,

  nestor. and in the imitation of these twain-
    who, as ulysses says, opinion crowns
    with an imperial voice-many are infect.
    ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    in such a rein, in full as proud a place
    as broad achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle, and sets thersites,
    a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    to match us in comparisons with dirt,
    to weaken and discredit our exposure,
    how rank soever rounded in with danger.
  ulysses. they tax our policy and call it cowardice,
    count wisdom as no member of the war,
    forestall prescience, and esteem no act
    but that of hand. the still and mental parts
    that do contrive how many hands shall strike
    when fitness calls them on, and know, by measure
    of their obse
