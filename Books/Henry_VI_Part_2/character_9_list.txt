Margaret - 
      A French woman, Margaret was captured during the French wars by Suffolk, who wooed her for Henry since he could not have her himself. In exchange for Margaret, the French keep two pivotal regions of French territory, which upsets Gloucester. Margaret had imagined that Henry would be just like chivalrous Suffolk, so she is disappointed in the weak king. She plots against Gloucester and gradually gains more power. She is devastated when Suffolk is exiled, for she had begun an affair with him.
