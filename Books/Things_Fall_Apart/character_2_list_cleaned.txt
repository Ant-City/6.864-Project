[CHARACTER] - 
                the
only child of okonkwo's second wife, ekwefi. as the only one of
ekwefi's ten children to survive past infancy, [CHARACTER] is the center
of her mother's world. their relationship is atypical--[CHARACTER] calls
ekwefi by her name and is treated by her as an equal. [CHARACTER] is also
okonkwo's favorite child, for she understands him better than any
of his other children and reminds him of ekwefi when ekwefi was
the village beauty. okonkwo rarely demonstrates his affection, however, because
he fears that doing so would make him look weak. furthermore, he
wishes that [CHARACTER] were a boy because she would have been the perfect
son.
