the huge red beard, each of which covered one-half of
his face,--had it not been for the roll of gilded cardboard, spangled,
and all bristling with strips of tinsel, which he held in his hand, and
in which the eyes of the initiated easily recognized thunderbolts,--had
not his feet been flesh-colored, and banded with ribbons in greek
fashion, he might have borne comparison, so far as the severity of his
mien was concerned, with a breton archer from the guard of monsieur de
berry.




chapter ii. pierre gringoire.



nevertheless, as be harangued them, the satisfaction and admiration
unanimously excited by his costume were dissipated by his words; and
when he reached that untoward conclusion: â€œas soon as his illustrious
eminence, the cardinal, arrives, we will begin,â€ his voice was drowned
in a thunder of hooting.

â€œbegin instantly! the mystery! the mystery immediately!â€ shrieked the
people. and above all the voices, that of johannes de molendino
was audible, piercing the uproar like the fifeâ€™

o them with impatience.

â€œdo you promise us that this mystery will be fine?â€ said gisquette.

â€œwithout doubt,â€ he replied; then he added, with a certain emphasis,--â€œi
am the author of it, damsels.â€

â€œtruly?â€ said the young girls, quite taken aback.

â€œtruly!â€ replied the poet, bridling a little; â€œthat is, to say, there
are two of us; jehan marchand, who has sawed the planks and erected
the framework of the theatre and the woodwork; and i, who have made the
piece. my name is pierre gringoire.â€

the author of the â€œcidâ€ could not have said â€œpierre corneilleâ€ with more
pride.

our readers have been able to observe, that a certain amount of time
must have already elapsed from the moment when jupiter had retired
beneath the tapestry to the instant when the author of the new morality
had thus abruptly revealed himself to the innocent admiration of
gisquette and liÃ©narde. remarkable fact: that whole crowd, so tumultuous
but a few moments before, now waited amiably on the word o

all this was, in fact, very fine.

nevertheless, in that throng, upon which the four allegories vied with
each other in pouring out floods of metaphors, there was no ear more
attentive, no heart that palpitated more, not an eye was more haggard,
no neck more outstretched, than the eye, the ear, the neck, and the
heart of the author, of the poet, of that brave pierre gringoire, who
had not been able to resist, a moment before, the joy of telling his
name to two pretty girls. he had retreated a few paces from them, behind
his pillar, and there he listened, looked, enjoyed. the amiable applause
which had greeted the beginning of his prologue was still echoing in
his bosom, and he was completely absorbed in that species of ecstatic
contemplation with which an author beholds his ideas fall, one by one,
from the mouth of the actor into the vast silence of the audience.

it pains us to say it, but this first ecstasy was speedily disturbed.
hardly had gringoire raised this intoxicating cup of joy and triumph to
his lips, when a drop of bitterness was mingled with it.

a tattered mendicant, who could not collect any coins, lost as he was
in the midst of the crowd, and who had not probably found sufficient
indemnity in the pockets of his neighbors, had hit upon the idea of
perching himself upon some conspicuous point, in order to attract looks
and alms. he had,

during the siege of paris, on sunday, the twenty-sixth of september,

powder stored at the gate of the temple, would have rent his ears less
rudely at that solemn and dramatic moment, than these few words, which
fell from the lips of the usher, â€œhis eminence, monseigneur the cardinal
de bourbon.â€

it is not that pierre gringoire either feared or disdained monsieur the
cardinal. he had neither the weakness nor the audacity for that. a true
eclectic, as it would be expressed nowadays, gringoire was one of those
firm and lofty, moderate and calm spirits, which always know how to bear
themselves amid all circumstances (_stare in dimidio rerum_), and who
are full of reason and of liberal philosophy, while still setting
store by cardinals. a rare, precious, and never interrupted race of
philosophers to whom wisdom, like anot

represent them in the fifteenth century if we succeed in bestowing upon
him the distinction which he deserves, it certainly was their spirit
which animated father du breul, when he wrote, in the sixteenth, these
naively sublime words, worthy of all centuries: â€œi am a parisian by

there was then neither hatred for the cardinal, nor disdain for his

quite the contrary; our poet had too much good sense and too threadbare
a coat, not to attach particular importance to having the numerous
allusions in his prologue, and, in particular, the glorification of the
dauphin, son of the lion of france, fall upon the most eminent ear. but
it is not interest which predominates in the noble nature of poets. i

prologue.

we have all forgotten him completely.

this is precisely what he feared.

from the moment of the cardinalâ€™s entrance, gringoire had never ceased
to tremble for the safety of his prologue. at first he had enjoined the
actors, who had stopped in suspense, to continue, and to raise their
voices; then, perceiving that no one was listening, he had stopped them;
and, during the entire quarter of an hour that the interruption lasted,
he had not ceased to stamp, to flounce about, t

when pierre gringoire arrived on the place de grÃ¨ve, he was paralyzed.
he had directed his course across the pont aux meuniers, in order
to avoid the rabble on the pont au change, and the pennons of jehan
fourbault; but the wheels of all the bishopâ€™s mills had splashed him as
he passed, and his doublet was drenched; it seemed to him besides, that
the failure of his piece had rendered him still more sensible to cold
than usual. hence he made haste to draw near the bonfire, which was

flight and passage through all the meanderings of the ancient passages

lack of breath in the first place, and in the second, because he had
been collared, after a fashion, by a dilemma which had just occurred to
his mind. â€œit strikes me, master pierre gringoire,â€ he said to himself,
placing his finger to his brow, â€œthat you are running like a madman. the
little scamps are no less afraid of you than you are of them. it strikes
me, i say, that you heard the clatter of their wooden shoes fleeing
southward, while you were fleeing northward. now, one of two things,
either they have taken flight, and the pallet, which they must have
forgotten in their terror, is precisely that hospitable bed in search

father the pope!â€ exclaimed the emperor of galilee, smashing his pot in
order to prop up his table.

â€œmesseigneurs, emperors, and kings,â€ said gringoire coolly (for i know
not how, firmness had returned to him, and he spoke with resolution),
â€œdonâ€™t think of such a thing; my name is pierre gringoire. i am the
poet whose morality was presented this morning in the grand hall of the
courts.â€

â€œah! so it was you, master!â€ said clopin. â€œi was there, _xÃªte dieu_!
well! comrade, is that any reason, because you bored us to death this
morning, that you should not be hung this evening?â€

â€œi shall find difficulty in getting out of it,â€ said gringoire to
himself. nevertheless, he made one more effort: â€œi donâ€™t see why poets

â€œmy name? if you want it, here it is,--pierre gringoire.â€

â€œi know a prettier one,â€ said she.

me. wait, perhaps you will love me more when you know me better; and
then, you have told me your story with so much confidence, that i

who, in order to earn a few testers in his turn, was walking round the
circle, with his elbows on his hips, his head thrown back, his face red,
his neck outstretched, with a chair between his teeth. to the chair he
had fastened a cat, which a neighbor had lent, and which was spitting in
great affright.

â€œnotre-dame!â€ exclaimed the archdeacon, at the moment when the juggler,
perspiring heavily, passed in front of him with his pyramid of chair and
his cat, â€œwhat is master pierre gringoire doing here?â€

the harsh voice of the archdeacon threw the poor fellow into such a
commotion that he lost his equilibrium, together with his whole edifice,
and the chair and the cat tumbled pell-mell upon the heads of the
spectators, in the midst of inextinguishable hootings.

it is probable that master pierre gringoire (for it was indeed he) would
have had a sorry account to settle with the neighbor who owned the cat,

question in my turn.â€

â€œspeak, sir.â€

â€œwhat concern is it of yours?â€

the archdeaconâ€™s pale face became as crimson as the cheek of a young
girl. he remained for a moment without answering; then, with visible
embarrassment,--

â€œlisten, master pierre gringoire. you are not yet damned, so far as
i know. i take an interest in you, and wish you well. now the least
contact with that egyptian of the demon would make you the vassal of
satan. you know that â€˜tis always the body which ruins the soul. woe to
you if you approach that woman! that is all.â€

bernardins.



as soon as pierre gringoire had seen how this whole affair was
turning, and that there would decidedly be the rope, hanging, and other
disagreeable things for the principal personages in this comedy, he had
not cared to identify himself with the matter further. the outcasts
with whom he had remained, reflecting that, after all, it was the best
company in paris,--the outcasts had continued to interest themselves in
behalf of the gypsy. he had thought it very simple on the part of
people who had, like herself, nothing else

â€œthat is singular,â€ said the priest dreamily. â€œyet a handsome uniform is

gringoire, perceiving that he was in a pensive mood, quitted him to go
and admire the porch of a neighboring house. he came back clapping his
hands.

â€œif you were less engrossed with the fine clothes of men of war,
monsieur the archdeacon, i would entreat you to come and see this door.
i have always said that the house of the sieur aubry had the most superb
entrance in the world.â€

â€œpierre gringoire,â€ said the archdeacon, â€œwhat have you done with that
little gypsy dancer?â€

â€œla esmeralda? you change the conversation very abruptly.â€

â€œwas she not your wife?â€

â€œyes, by virtue of a broken crock. we were to have four years of it. by

way, â€œare you still thinking of her?â€

â€œand you think of her no longer?â€

intermingled from one end of the apartment to the other.

in the midst of this uproar, at the extremity of the tavern, on the
bench inside the chimney, sat a philosopher meditating with his feet in
the ashes and his eyes on the brands. it was pierre gringoire.

in the midst of this anguish, she heard some one walking near her. she

no one doubted but that the day had come when, in accordance with their
compact, quasimodo, that is to say, the devil, was to carry off claude

the body when taking the soul, like monkeys who break the shell to get

this is why the archdeacon was not interred in consecrated earth.

louis xi. died a year later, in the month of august, 1483.

as for pierre gringoire, he succeeded in saving the goat, and he won
success in tragedy. it appears that, after having tasted astrology,
philosophy, architecture, hermetics,--all vanities, he returned to
tragedy, vainest pursuit of all. this is what he called â€œcoming to a
tragic end.â€ this is what is to be read, on the subject of his dramatic
triumphs, in 1483, in the accounts of the â€œordinary:â€ â€œto jehan marchand
