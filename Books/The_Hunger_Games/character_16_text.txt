as broken. heâ€™s not back to 
normal, but itâ€™s come down a few degrees. last night, when i 
was gathering vines, i came upon a bush of rueâ€™s berries. i 
strip off the fruit and mash it up in the broth pot with cold wa-
ter. peetaâ€™s struggling to get up when i reach the cave. â€œi woke 
up and you were gone,â€ he says. â€œi was worried about you.â€ 
i have to laugh as i ease him back down. â€œyou were worried 
about me? have you taken a look at yourself lately?â€ 
â€œi thought cato and clove might have found you. they like 
to hunt at night,â€ he says, still serious. 
â€œclove? which one is that?â€ i ask. 
â€œthe girl from district two. sheâ€™s still alive, right?â€ he says. 
â€œyes, thereâ€™s just them and us and thresh and foxface,â€ i 
say. â€œthatâ€™s what i nicknamed the girl from five. how do you 
feel?â€

â€œbetter than yesterday. this is an enormous improvement 
over the mud,â€ he says. â€œclean clothes and medicine and a 
sleeping bag . . . and you.â€

cover a tuft of chives growing at the base of some rocks. per-
fect. i chop them very fine and add them to the pot, switch out 
the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew. 
iâ€™ve seen very few signs of game around, but i donâ€™t feel 
comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt, so i rig half a 
dozen snares and hope i get lucky. i wonder about the other 
tributes, how theyâ€™re managing now that their main source of 
food has been blown up. at least three of them, cato, clove, 
and foxface, had been relying on it. probably not thresh 
though. iâ€™ve got a feeling he must share some of rueâ€™s know-
ledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. are they fighting 
each other? looking for us? maybe one of them has located us 
and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. the idea 
sends me back to the cave. 
peetaâ€™s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the 
shade of the rocks. although he brightens a bit when i come 
in, itâ€™s clear he feels miserable.

thereâ€™s nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. i 
jump as peeta grips my shoulder from behind. â€œno,â€ he says. 
â€œyouâ€™re not risking your life for me.â€ 
â€œwho said i was?â€ i say. 
â€œso, youâ€™re not going?â€ he asks. 
â€œof course, iâ€™m not going. give me some credit. do you think 
iâ€™m running straight into some free-for-all against cato and 
clove and thresh? donâ€™t be stupid,â€ i say, helping him back to 
bed. â€œiâ€™ll let them fight it out, weâ€™ll see whoâ€™s in the sky tomor-
row night and work out a plan from there.â€ 
â€œyouâ€™re such a bad liar, katniss. i donâ€™t know how youâ€™ve 
survived this long.â€ he begins to mimic me. â€œi knew that goat 
course,  iâ€™m  not  going. he shakes his head. â€œnever gamble at 
cards. youâ€™ll lose your last coin,â€ he says. 
anger flushes my face. â€œall right, i am going, and you canâ€™

make a meal out of the smaller, bonier fish that inhabit the 
stream down here, fill every water container and purify it, and 
clean my weapons. iâ€™ve nine arrows left in all. i debate leaving 
the knife with peeta so heâ€™ll have some protection while iâ€™m 
gone, but thereâ€™s really no point. he was right about camouf-
lage being his final defense. but i still might have use for the 
knife. who knows what iâ€™ll encounter? 
here are some things iâ€™m fairly certain of. that at least ca-
to, clove, and thresh will be on hand when the feast starts. iâ€™m 
not sure about foxface since direct confrontation isnâ€™t her

style or her forte. sheâ€™s even smaller than i am and unarmed, 
unless sheâ€™s picked up some weapons recently. sheâ€™ll probably 
be hanging somewhere nearby, seeing what she can scavenge. 
but the other three . . . iâ€™m going to have my hands full. my 
ability to kill at a distance is my greatest asset, but i know iâ€™ll 
have to go right into the thick of t

s, but maybe foxface is the real opponent 
here. sheâ€™s cost me time, too, because by now itâ€™s clear that i 
must get to the table next. anyone who beats me to it will 
easily scoop up my pack and be gone. without hesitation, i 
sprint for the table. i can sense the emergence of danger be-
fore i see it. fortunately, the first knife comes whizzing in on 
my right side so i can hear it and iâ€™m able to deflect it with my 
bow. i turn, drawing back the bowstring and send an arrow 
straight at cloveâ€™s heart. she turns just enough to avoid a fatal 
hit, but the point punctures her upper left arm. unfortunately, 

279 

 

 

she throws with her right, but itâ€™s enough to slow her down a 
few moments, having to pull the arrow from her arm, take in 
the severity of the wound. i keep moving, positioning the next 
arrow automatically, as only someone who has hunted for 
years can do. 
iâ€™m at the table now, my fingers closing over the tiny 
orange backpack. my hand slips between the straps

it up on my arm, itâ€™s really too small to fit on any other part of 
my anatomy, and iâ€™m turning to fire again when the second 
knife catches me in the forehead. it slices above my right eye-
brow, opening a gash that sends a gush running down my face, 
blinding my eye, filling my mouth with the sharp, metallic 
taste of my own blood. i stagger backward but still manage to 
send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assai-
lant. i know as it leaves my hands it will miss. and then clove 
slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my 
shoulders to the ground, with her knees. 
this is it, i think, and hope for primâ€™s sake it will be fast. but 
clove means to savor the moment. even feels she has time. no 
doubt cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for 
thresh and possibly peeta. 
â€œwhereâ€™s your boyfriend, district twelve? still hanging 
on?â€ she asks. 
well, as long as weâ€™re talking iâ€™m alive. â€œheâ€™s out there now.

clove jams her fist into my windpipe, very effectively cut-
ting off my voice. but her headâ€™s whipping from side to side, 

280 

 

 

and i know for a moment sheâ€™s at least considering iâ€™m telling 
the truth. since no peeta appears to save me, she turns back to 
me. â€œliar,â€ she says with a grin. â€œheâ€™s nearly dead. cato knows 
where he cut him. youâ€™ve probably got him strapped up in 
some tree while you try to keep his heart going. whatâ€™s in the 
pretty little backpack? that medic

heâ€™ll never get it.â€ 
clove opens her jacket. itâ€™s lined with an impressive array 
of knives. she carefully selects an almost dainty-looking num-
ber with a cruel, curved blade. â€œi promised cato if he let me 
have you, iâ€™d give the audience a good show.â€ 
iâ€™m struggling now in an effort to unseat her, but itâ€™s no use. 
sheâ€™s too heavy and her lock on me too tight. 
â€œforget it, district twelve. weâ€™re going to kill you. just like 
we did your pathetic little ally . . . what was her name? the 
one who hoppe

then you, and then i think weâ€™ll just let nature take care of 
lover boy. how does that sound?â€ clove asks. â€œnow, where to 
start?â€ 
she carelessly wipes away the blood from my wound with 
her jacket sleeve. for a moment, she surveys my face, tilting it 
from side to side as if itâ€™s a block of wood and sheâ€™s deciding 
exactly what pattern to carve on it. i attempt to bite her hand, 
but she grabs the hair on the top of my head, forcing me back 
to the ground. â€œi think . . .â€ she almost purrs. â€œi think weâ€™ll start 
with your mouth.â€ i clamp my teeth together as she teasingly

but i will stare her down, i will not cry out. i will die, in my 
own small way, undefeated. 
â€œyes, i donâ€™t think youâ€™ll have much use for your lips any-
more. want to blow lover boy one last kiss?â€ she asks, i work 
up a mouthful of blood and saliva and spit it in her face. she 
flushes with rage. â€œall right then. letâ€™s get started.â€ 
i brace myself for the agony thatâ€™s sure to follow. but as i 
feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks 
clove from my body and then sheâ€™s screaming. iâ€™m too 
stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. has 
peeta somehow come to my rescue? have the gamemakers 
sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? has a hovercraft 
inexplicably plucked her into the air? 
but when i push myself up on my numb arms, i see itâ€™s 
none of the above. clove is dangling a foot off the ground, im-
prisoned in threshâ€™s arms. i let out a gasp, seeing him like 
that, towering over me, holding clove like

 a rag doll. i remem-
ber him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful 
than i even recall. if anything, he seems to have gained weight 
in the arena. he flips clove around and flings her onto the 
ground. when he shouts, i jump, never having heard him speak 
above a mutter. â€œwhatâ€™d you do to that little girl? you kill 
her?â€ 

282 

 

 

clove is scrambling backward on all fours, like a frantic in-
sect, too shocked to even call for cato. â€œno! no, it wasnâ€™t me!â€ 
â€œyou said her name. i heard you. you kill her?â€ another 
thought brings a fresh wave of rage to his features. â€œyou cut 
her up like you were going to cut up this girl here?â€ 
â€œno! no, i â€”â€ clove sees the stone, about the size of a small 
loaf of bread in threshâ€™s hand and loses it. â€œcato!â€ she 
screeches. â€œcato!â€ 
â€œclove!â€ i hear catoâ€™s an

swer, but heâ€™s too far away, i can 
tell that much, to do her any good. what was he doing? trying 
to get foxface or peeta? or had he been lying in wait for 
thresh and just badly misjudged his location? 
thresh brings the rock down hard against cloveâ€™s temple. 
itâ€™s not bleeding, but i can see the dent in her skull and i know 
that sheâ€™s a goner. thereâ€™s still life in her now though, in the 
rapid rise and fall of her chest, the low moan escaping her lips. 
when thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, i know 
itâ€™s no good to run. and my bow is empty, the last loaded ar-
row having gone in cloveâ€™s direction. iâ€™m trapped in the glare 
of his strange golden brown eyes. â€œwhatâ€™d she mean? about 
rue being your ally?â€

the 
rock and points at me, almost accusingly. â€œjust this one time, i 
let you go. for the little girl. you and me, weâ€™re even then. no 
more owed. you understand?â€ 
i nod because i do understand. about owing. about hating 
it. i understand that if thresh wins, heâ€™ll have to go back and 
face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank 
me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. and i under-
stand that, for the moment, thresh is not going to smash in 
my skull. 
â€œclove!â€ catoâ€™s voice is much nearer now. i can tell by the 
pain in it that he sees her on the ground. 
â€œyou better run now, fire girl,â€ says thresh. 
i donâ€™t need to be told twice. i flip over and my feet dip into 
the hard-packed earth as i run away from thresh and clove 
and the sound of catoâ€™s voice. only when i reach the woods do 
i turn back for an instant. thresh and both large backpacks 
are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area iâ€™ve nev-
er seen. cato kneels beside

to stay with him. in a moment, he will realize itâ€™s futile, she 
canâ€™t be saved. i crash into the trees, repeatedly swiping away 
the blood thatâ€™s pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, 
wounded creature i am. after a few minutes, i hear the cannon 
and i know that clove has died, that cato will be on one of our 
trails. either threshâ€™s or mine. iâ€™m seized with terror, weak 
from my head wound, shaking. i load an arrow, but cato can 
throw that spear almost as far as i can shoot. 
only one thing calms me down. thresh has catoâ€™s backpack 
containing the thing he needs desperately. if i had to bet, cato 
headed out after thresh, not me. still i donâ€™t slow down when 
i reach the water. i plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder 
downstream. i pull off

lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. 
rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but peeta has 
built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging 
the square of plastic into the rock above me. 
â€œi wonder what brought on this storm? i mean, whoâ€™s the 
target?â€ says peeta. 
â€œcato and thresh,â€ i say without thinking. â€œfoxface will be 
in her den somewhere, and clove . . . she cut me an then . . .â€ 
my voice trails off. 
â€œi know cloveâ€™s dead. i saw it in the sky last night,â€ h says. 
â€œdid you kill her?â€ 
â€œno. thresh broke her skull with a rock,â€ i say. 
â€œlucky he didnâ€™t catch you, too,â€ says peeta. 
the memory of the feast returns full-force and i feel sick. 
â€œhe did. but he let me go.â€ then, of course, i have to tell him. 
about things iâ€™ve kept to myself because he was too sick to ask 
and i wasnâ€™t ready to relive anyway. lik
