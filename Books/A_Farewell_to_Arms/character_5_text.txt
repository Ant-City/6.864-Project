are there?" 

"just us two." 

"won't there be more?" 

"some more are coming." 

"when will they get here?" 

"i don't know. you ask a great many questions for 
a sick boy." 

"i'm not sick," i said, "i'm wounded." 

they had finished making the bed and i lay with a 
clean smooth sheet under me and another sheet over 
me. mrs. walker went out and came back with a 
pajama jacket. they put that on me and i felt very 
clean and dressed. 

"you're awfully nice to me," i said. the nurse 
called miss gage giggled. "could i have a drink of 
water?" i asked. 

"certainly. then you can have breakfast." 

"i don't want breakfast. can i have the shutters 
opened please?" 

the light had been dim in the room and when the 
shutters were opened it was bright sunlight and i 
looked out on a balcony and beyond were the tile roofs 
of houses and chimneys. i looked out over the tiled 
roofs and saw white clouds and the sky very blue. 

"don't you know when the other nurses are com- 
ing?" 

"why? don't we t

"you're very nice." 

"would you like to use the bedpan?"

"i might try." 

they helped me and held me up but it was not any 
use. afterward i lay and looked out the open doors 
onto the balcony. 

"when does the doctor come?" 

"when he gets back. we've tried to telephone to 
lake como for him." 

"aren't there any other doctors?" 

"he's the doctor for the hospital." 

miss gage brought a pitcher of water and a glass. i 
drank three glasses and then they left me and i looked 
out the window a while and went back to sleep. i ate 
some lunch and in the afternoon miss van campen, 
the superintendent, came up to see me. she did not 
like me and i did not like her. she was small and 
neatly suspicious and too good for her position. she 
asked many questions and seemed to think it was some- 
what disgraceful that i was with the italians. 

"can i have wine with the meals?" i

 asked her. 

"only if the doctor prescribes it." 

"i can't have it until he comes?" 

"absolutely not." 

"you plan on having him come eventually?" 

"we've telephoned him at lake como." 

she went out and miss gage came back. 

"why were you rude to miss van campen?" she 
asked after she had done something for me very skil- 
fully. 

"i didn't mean to be. but she was snooty." 

"she said you were domineering and rude." 

"i wasn't. but what's the idea of a hospital with- 
out a doctor?" 

"he's coming. they've telephoned for him to lake 
como."

while, the news from the front, and the list of dead 
officers with their decorations and then reached down 
and brought up the bottle of cinzano and held it 
straight up on my stomach, the cool glass against my 
stomach, and took little drinks making rings on my 
stomach from holding the bottle there between drinks, 
and watched it get dark outside over the roofs of the 
town. the swallows circled around and i watched them 
and the night-hawks flying above the roofs and drank 
the cinzano. miss gage brought up a glass with some 
egg-nog in it. i lowered the vermouth bottle to the 
other side of the bed when she came in. 

"miss van campen had some sherry put in this," 
she said. "you shouldn't be rude to her. she's not 
young and this hospital is a big responsibility for her. 
mrs. walker's too old and she's no use to her." 

"she's a splendid woman," i said. "thank her very 
much." 

"i'm going to bring your supper right away." 
"that's all right," i said. "i'm not hungry."

and soap and warm water. "hold your shoulder up," 
she said. "that's fine." 

"can i have the barber before breakfast?" 

"i'll send the porter for him." she went out and 
came back. "he's gone for him," she said and dipped 
the cloth she held in the basin of water. 

the barber came with the porter. he was a man of 
about fifty with an upturned mustache. miss gage 
was finished with me and went out and the barber 
lathered my face and shaved. he was very solemn and 
refrained from talking. 

"what's the matter ? don't you know any news ?" i 
asked. 

"what news?" 

"any news. what's happened in the town?" 

"it is time of war," he said. "the enemy's ears are 
everywhere." 

i looked up at him. "please hold your face still," he 
said and went on shaving. "i will tell nothing." 

"what's the matter with you?" i asked.

"i will not i am not at the front. but i am an 
italian." 

"get the hell out of here."

"with your permission," he said and wrapped his 
razors in newspaper. he went out leaving the five 
copper coins on the table beside the bed. i rang the 
bell. miss gage came in. "would you ask the porter 
to come please?" 

"all right." 

the porter came in. he was trying to keep from 
laughing. 

"is that barber crazy?" 

"no, signorino. he made a mistake. he doesn't 
understand very well and he thought i said you were 
an austrian officer." 

"oh," i said. 

"ho ho ho," the porter laughed. "he was funny. 
one move from you he said and he would have — " he 
drew his forefinger across his throat.

"come back right away." 

"i'll come when i can." 

"good-by." 

"good-by, sweet." 

she went out. god knows i had not wanted to fall 
in love with her. i had not wanted to fall in love with 
any one. but god knows i had and i lay on the bed 
in the room of the hospital in milan and all sorts of 
things went through my head but i felt wonderful and 
finally miss gage came in. 

"the doctor's coming," she said. "he telephoned 
from lake como." 

"when does he get here?" 

"he'll be here this afternoon." 






chapter xv 

nothing happened until afternoon. the doctor 
was a thin quiet little man who seemed disturbed by 
the war. he took out a number of small steel splinters 
from my thighs with delicate and refined distaste. he 
used a local anaesthetic called something or other "snow," 
which froze the tissue and avoided pain until the probe,

ful. it was arranged by holding up the shoulders, that 
the patient should see personally some of the larger 
foreign bodies through the machine. the plates were 
to be sent over. the doctor requested me to write in 
his pocket notebook, my name, and regiment and some 
sentiment. he declared that the foreign bodies were 
ugly, nasty, brutal. the austrians were sons of bitches. 
how many had i killed? i had not killed any but i 
was anxious to please — and i said i had killed plenty. 
miss gage was with me and the doctor put his arm 
around her and said she was more beautiful than cleo- 
patra. did she understand that? cleopatra the for- 
mer queen of egypt. yes, by god she was. we re- 
turned to the little hospital in the ambulance and after 
a while and much lifting i was upstairs and in bed 
again. the plates came that afternoon, the doctor had

"this is the young man," said the house doctor with 
the delicate hands. 

"how do you do?" said the tall gaunt doctor with 
the beard. the third doctor, who carried the x-ray 
plates in their red envelopes, said nothing. 

"remove the dressings?" questioned the bearded 
doctor. 

"certainly. remove the dressings, please, nurse," 
the house doctor said to miss gage. miss gage re- 
moved the dressings. i looked down at the legs. at 
the field hospital they had the look of not too freshly 
ground hamburger steak. now they were crusted and 
the knee was swollen and discolored and the calf 
sunken but there was no pus.

"very clean/' said the house doctor. "very clean 
and nice." 

"urn," said the doctor with the beard. the third 
doctor looked over the house doctor's shoulder.

"thank you very much," i said. "i value your 
opinion." 

the first captain looked at his watch. 

"we must go," he said. "all my best wishes." 

"all my best wishes and many thanks," i said. i 
shook hands with the third doctor, "capitano varini — 
tenente enry," and they all three went out of the room. 

"miss gage," i called. she came in. "please ask 
the house doctor to come back a minute." 

he came in holding his cap and stood by the bed. 
"did you wish to see me?" 

"yes. i can't wait six months to be operated on. 
my god, doctor, did you ever stay in bed six months?" 

"you won't be in bed all the time. you must first 
have the wounds exposed to the sun. then afterward 
you can be on crutches."

chapter xvii 

when i was awake after the operation i had not 
been away. you do not go away. they only choke 
you. it is not like dying it is just a chemical choking 
so you do not feel, and afterward you might as well 
have been drunk except that when you throw up noth- 
ing comes but bile and you do not feel better after- 
ward. i saw sandbags at the end of the bed. they 
were on pipes that came out of the cast. after a while 
i saw miss gage and she said, "how is it now?" 

"better," i said. 

"he did a wonderful job on your knee." 

"how long did it take ?" 

"two hours and a half." 

"did i say anything silly?" 

"not a thing. don't talk. just be quiet." 

i was sick and catherine was right. it did not make 
any difference who was on night duty. 

there were three other patients in the hospital now,

"miss van campen spoke about you sleeping all the 
forenoons." 

"she would." 

"it would be better if you let her stay off nights a 
little while." 

"i want her to." 

"you do not. but if you would make her i'd re- 
spect you for it." 

"i'll make her." 

"i don't believe it." she took the note and went out. 
i rang the bell and in a little while miss gage came in. 

"what's the matter?" 

"i just wanted to talk to you. don't you think miss 
barkley ought to go off night duty for a while? she

looks awfully tired. why does she stay on so long?" 

miss gage looked at me. 

"i'm a friend of yours," she said. "you don't have 
to talk to me like that." 

"what do you mean?" 

"don't be silly. was that all you wanted?" 

"do you want a vermouth?" 

"all right. then i have to go." she got out the 
bottle from the armoire and

 brought a glass. 

"you take the glass," i said. 'til drink out of the 
bottle." 

"here's to you," said miss gage. 

"what did van campen say about me sleeping late 
in the mornings?" 

"she just jawed about it. she calls you our priv- 
ileged patient." 

"to hell with her." 

"she isn't mean," miss gage said. "she's just old 
and cranky. she never liked you." 

"no." 

"well, i do. and i'm your friend. don't forget 
that." 

"you're awfully damned nice." 

"no. i know who you think is nice. but i'm your 
friend. how does your leg feel?" 

"fine." 

"i'll bring some cold mineral water to pour over it. 
it must itch under the cast. it's hot outside."

"does it itch much?" 

"no. it's fine."

next day it was 
raining. coming home from the ospedale maggiore 
it rained very hard and i was wet when i came in. up 
in my room the rain was coming down heavily outside 
on the balcony, and the wind blew it against the glass 
doors. i changed my clothing and drank some brandy 
but the brandy did not taste good. i felt sick in the 
night and in the morning after breakfast i was nau- 
seated. 

"there is no doubt about it," the house surgeon said. 
"look at the whites of his eyes, miss." 

miss gage looked. they had me look in a glass. the 
whites of the eyes were yellow and it was the jaundice. 
i was sick for two weeks with it. for that reason we 
did not spend a convalescent leave together. we had 
planned to go to pallanza on lago maggiore. it is 
nice there in the fall when the leaves turn. there are 
walks you can take and you can troll for trout in the 
lake. it would have been better than stresa because 
there are fewer people at pallanza. stresa is so easy 
to get to from milan th

"that wasn't the question. i have seen self-inflicted 
wounds also. i asked you if you had ever known a 
man who had tried to disable himself by kicking him- 
self in the scrotum. because that is the nearest sensa- 
tion to jaundice and it is a sensation that i believe few 
women have ever experienced. that was why i asked 
you if you had ever had the jaundice, miss van 
campen, because — " miss van campen left the room. 
later miss gage came in.

"what did you say to van campen ? she was furi- 
ous." 

"we were comparing sensations. i was going to 
suggest that she had never experienced childbirth " 

"you're a fool/' gage said. "she's after your scalp." 

"she has my scalp," i said. "she's lost me my leave 
and she might try and get me court-martialled. she's 
mean enough." 

"she never liked you," gage said. "what's it 
about?" 

"she says i've drunk myself into jaundice so as 
not to go back to t

"pooh," said gage. "i'll swear you've never taken

drink." 

"she found the bottles." 

"i've told you a hundred times to clear out those 
bottles. where are they now?" 

"in the armoire." 

"have you a suitcase?" 

"no. put them in that rucksack." 

miss gage packed the bottles in the rucksack. "i'll 
give them to the porter," she said. she started for the 
door. 

"just a minute," miss van campen said. "i'll take 
those bottles." she had the porter with her. "carry 
them, please," she said. "i want to show them to the 
doctor when i make my report." 

she went down the hall. the porter carried the sack. 
he knew what was in it. 

nothing happened except that i lost my leave.
