     "was it telling you that it's been outside the world and come back again? that
must be untrue."
     "i don't know," said bigwig, "but i'm sure he's not lying. this water,

can't hear that, he misses it. that's his name -- kehaar. it's the noise the water
makes."
     the others were impressed in spite of themselves.
     "well, why's it here?" asked hazel.
     "he shouldn't be. he ought to have been off to this big water place a long time

trong feeling, latent throughout the
warren, had come to the surface. but his plan to make use of the gull excited
everyone and was seen as something that not even blackberry could have hit
upon. reconnaissance is familiar to all rabbits -- indeed, it is second nature -- but
the idea of making use of a bird, and one so strange and savage, convinced them
that hazel, if he could really do it, must be as clever as el-ahrairah himself.
     for the next few days a lot of hard work went into feeding kehaar. acorn and
pipkin, boasting that they were the best insect-catchers in the warren, brought in
great numbers of beetles and grasshoppers. at first the gull's principal hardship
was lack of water. he suffered a good deal and was reduced to tearing at the
stems of the long grasses for moisture. however, during his third night in the
warren it rained for three or four hours and puddles formed on the track. a
cluttery spell set in, as it often does in hampshire when haytime approaches.

om the south laid the grass flat all day, turning it to a dull,
damascene silver. the great branches of the beeches moved little, but spoke
loudly. there were squalls of rain on the wind. the weather made kehaar restless.
he walked about a good deal, watched the flying clouds and snapped up
everything the foragers brought. searching became harder, for in the wet the
insects burrowed into the deep grass and had to be scratched out.
     one afternoon hazel, who now shared a burrow with fiver as in the old days,
was woken by bigwig to be told that kehaar had something to say to him. he
made his way to kehaar's lobby without coming above ground. the first thing he
noticed was that the gull's head was molt

ing and turning white, though a dark

brown patch remained behind each eye. hazel greeted him and was surprised to
be answered in a few words of halting, broken lapine. evidently kehaar had
prepared a short speech.
     "meester 'azel, ees rabbits vork 'ard," said kehaar. "i no finish now. soon i go
fine."
     "that's good news," said hazel. "i'm glad."
     kehaar relapsed into hedgerow vernacular.
     "meester pigvig, 'e plenty good fella."
     "yes, he is."
     "'e say you no getting mudders. ees finish mudders. plenty trouble for you."
     "yes, that's true. we don't know what to do. no mothers anywhere."
     "listen. i get peeg, fine plan. i go fine now. ving, 'e better. vind finish, den i

     "ees finish mudders for me dis year. ees too late. all mudders sitting on nest

     "i'm sorry."
     "nudder time i get mudder. now i fly for you."
     "we'll do everything we possibly can to help you."
     the next day the wind dropped and kehaar made one or two short flights.
however, it was not until three days later that he felt able to set out on his search.
it was a perfect june morning. he was snapping up numbers of the little white-
shelled downland snails from the wet grass and cracking them in his great beak,
when he suddenly turned to bigwig and said,
     "now i fly for you,"
     he opened his wings. the two-foot span arched above bigwig, who sat
perfectly still while the white feathers beat the air round his head in a kind

ceremonious farewell. laying his ears flat in the fanned draft, he stared up at
kehaar as the gull rose, rather heavily, into the air. when he flew, his body, so
long and graceful on the ground, took on the appearance of a thick, stumpy
cylinder, from the front of which his red beak projected between his round black
eyes. for a few moments he hovered, his body rising and falling between his
wings. then he began to climb, sailed sideways over the grass and disappeared
northward below the edge of the escarpment. bigwig returned to the hanger with
the news that kehaar had set out.
 
 
 ___________________________
 
    the gull was away several days -- longer than the rabbits had expected. hazel
could not help wondering whether he really would return, for he knew that
kehaar, like themselves, felt the mating urge and he thought it quite likely that
after all he would be off to the big water and the raucous, teeming gull colonies
of which he had spoken with such feeling to bigwig. as far as he was able, he kept
his anxiety to himself, but one day when they were alone, he asked fiver whether
he thought kehaar would return.
     "he will return," said fiver unhesitatingly.
     "and what will he bring with him?"
     "how can i tell?" replied fiver. but later, when they were underground, silent
and drowsy, he said suddenly, "the gifts of el-ahrairah. trickery; great danger;

and blessing for the warren." when hazel questioned him again, he seemed to be
unaware that he had spoken and could add nothing more.
     bigwig spent most of the hours of daylight watching for kehaar's return. he
was inclined

and short, and once, when bluebell remarked that he
thought meester pigvig's fur cap was molting in sympathy for absent friends, he
showed a flash of his old sergeant-major spirit and cuffed and abused him twice
round the honeycomb, until holly intervened to save his faithful jester from
further trouble.
     it was late one afternoon, with a light north wind blowing and the smell of hay
drifting up from the fields of sydmonton, when bigwig came hurtling down into
the honeycomb to announce that kehaar was back. hazel suppressed his
excitement and told everyone to keep out of the way while he went to see him
alone. on second thoughts, however, he took fiver and bigwig with him.
     the three of them found kehaar back in his lobby. it was full of droppings,
messy and malodorous. rabbits will not excrete underground and kehaar's habit
of fouling his own nest had always disgusted hazel. now, in his eagerness to hear
his news, the guano smell seemed almost welcome.
     "glad to see you back, ke

     "ving 'e still go tired. fly liddle bit, stop liddle bit, everyt'ing go fine."
     "are you hungry? shall we get you some insects?"
     "fine. fine. good fellas. plenty beetle." (all insects were "beetle" to kehaar.)
     clearly, he had missed their attentions and was ready to enjoy being back.
although he no longer needed to have food brought to the lobby, he evidently felt
that he deserved it. bigwig went to get his foragers and kehaar kept them busy
until sunset at last he looked shrewdly at fiver and said,
     "eh, meester liddle von, you know vat i pring, ya?"
     "i've no idea," replied fiver, rather shortly.
     "den i tell. all dis peeg 'ill, i go along 'im, dis vay, dat vay, vere sun come up,

     he stopped. hazel looked at fiver apprehensively.

     "i know this happens," said hazel. "i've heard of it. that's fine, kehaar. you've

     "i t'ink ees mudders. in peeg box. but else ees no rabbits; not in fields, not in

     "that sounds bad."

     "iron road?" asked fiver.
     "ya, ya, iron road. you not seen heem -- iron road? men make heem."
     kehaar's speech was so outlandish and distorted at the best of times that it was
only too common for the rabbits to be unsure what he meant. the vernacular
words which he used now for "iron" and "road" (familiar enough to seagulls) his
listeners had scarcely ever heard. kehaar was quick to impatience and now, as
often, they felt at a disadvantage in the face of his familiarity with a wider world
than their own. hazel thought quickly. two things were clear. kehaar had
evidently found a big warren some

way off to the south: and whatever the iron
road was, the warren was on this side both of it and of a river. if he had
understood rightly, it seemed to follow that the iron road and the river could be
ignored for their purposes.
     "kehaar," he said, "i want to be certain. can we get to the rabbits' town without
bothering about the iron road and the river?"
     "ya, ya. not go to iron road. rabbits' town in bushes for peeg, lonely fields.

     "sleep now. tomorrow plenty beetle, ya, ya."

rabbits made their way back to the honeycomb. hazel told kehaar's news
and a long, disorderly, intermittent discussion began. this was their way of
reaching a conclusion. the fact that there was a warren two or three days' journey
to the south flickered and oscillated down among them as a penny wavers down
through deep water moving one way and the other, shifting, vanishing,
reappearing, but always sinking toward the firm bottom. hazel let the talk run on
as long as it would, until at last they dispersed and slept.
     the next morning they went about thei

themselves, playing and digging. but all this time, just as a drop of water slowly
swells until it is heavy enough to fall from a twig, the idea of what they meant to
do was becoming clear and unanimous. by the following day hazel saw it plain. it
so happened that the time for speaking came when he was sitting on the bank at
sunrise, with fiver and three or four others. there was no need to summon a
general gathering. the thing was settled. when it reached them, those who were

     "this warren that kehaar found," said hazel, "he said it was big."
     "so we can't take it by force," said bigwig.
     "i don't think i want to go and join it," said hazel. "do you?"
     "and leave here?" replied dandelion. "after all our work? besides, i reckon
we'd have a thin time. no, i'm sure none of us wants to do that."
     "what we want is to get some does and bring them back here," said hazel.

his. holly was the obvious choice, but to select his
companions was less easy. everyone was ready to go, but the business was so
important that at last they considered each rabbit in turn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he had the

satisfaction of knowing that he was worth something to his new friends.
     they started early in the morning, in the gray light. kehaar had undertaken to

     hazel sat on the bank in the midsummer night. there had been no more than
five hours' darkness and that of a pallid, twilit quality which kept him wakeful
and restless. everything was going well. kehaar had found holly during the
afternoon and corrected his line a little to the west. he had left him in the shelter
of a thick hedge, sure of his course for the big warren. it seemed certain now that
two days would be enough for the journey. bigwig and some of the other rabbits

what they were going to do. no, of course not -- but just to show them that their
chief rabbit was up to anything that they were up to. he thought it over as he
hopped down the bank and sniffed out a patch of salad burnet in the grass. what,

now, would be likely to give them just a little, not unpleasant shock? suddenly he
thought, "suppose, when they got back, that there were one or two does here
already?" and in the same moment he remembered what kehaar had said about a
box full of rabbits at the farm. what sort of rabbits could they be? did they ever
come out of their box? had they ever seen a wild rabbit? kehaar had said that the
farm was not far from the foot of the down, on a little hill. so it could easily be
reached in the early morning, before its men were about. any dogs would
probably be chained, but the cats would be loose. a rabbit could outrun a cat as
long as he kept in the open and saw it coming first. the important thing was not

but there's some other funny thing besides -- something i can't smell. what

     "well, i had a bit of a brush with a cat, but why worry?"
     "because you're concealing something, hazel. something dangerous."
     "it's holly that's in danger, not i. why bother about me?"
     "holly?" replied fiver in surprise. "but holly and the others reached the big
warren early yesterday evening. kehaar told us. do you mean to say you didn't
know?"
     hazel felt fairly caught out. "well, i know now," he replied. "i'm glad to hear
it."
     "so it comes to this," said fiver. "you went to a farm yesterday and escaped
from a cat. and whatever you were up to, it was so much on your mind that you
forgot to ask about holly last night."
     "well, all right, fiver -- i'll tell you all about it. i took pipkin and went to that
farm that kehaar told us about where there are rabbits in a hutch. i foun

suppose there can't be more than three cats. too many rabbits will only be a
nuisance in the dark: someone will get lost and we shall have to spend time
looking for him."
     "well, dandelion, speedwell and hawkbit, then," said bigwig, "and leave the
others behind. do you mean to go tonight, hazel-rah?"
     "yes, the sooner the better," said hazel. "get hold of those three and tell them.
pity it's going to be dark -- we could have taken kehaar: he'd have enjoyed it."
     however, their hopes for that night were disappointed, for the rain returned
before dusk, settling in on a northwest wind and carrying up the hill the sweet-
sour smell of flowering privet from cottage hedges below. hazel sat on the bank
until the light had quite faded. at last, when it was clear that the rain was going to
stay for the night, he joined the others in the honeycomb. they had persuaded
kehaar to come down out of the wind and wet, and one of dandelion's

fascinated, about a time when frith had to go away on a journey, leaving the
whole world to be covered with rain. but a man built a great floating hutch that
held all the animals and birds until frith returned and let them out.
     "it won't happen tonight, will it, hazel-rah?" asked pipkin, listening to the rain
in the beech leaves outside. "there's no hutch here."
     "kehaar'll fly you up to the moon, hlao-roo," said bluebell, "and you can come
down on bigwig's head like a birch branch in the frost. but there's time to go to
sleep first."
     before fiver slept, however, he talked again to hazel about the raid.
     "i suppose it's no good asking you not to go?" he said.
     "look here," answered hazel, "have you got one of your bad turns about the
farm? if you have, why not say so straight out? then we'd all know where we
were."

ended by joining in himself, first as an attacker and then as the cat, staring and
quivering for all the world like the nuthanger tabby.
     "i shall be disappointed if we don't meet a cat after all this," said dandelion, as
he waited for his turn to run at a fallen beech branch from one side, claw it twice
and dash out again. "i feel a really dangerous animal."
     "you vatch heem, meester dando," said kehaar, who was hunting for snails in
the grass nearby, "meester pigvig, 'e vant you t'ink all vun peeg yoke; make you

     "but we're not going there to eat, kehaar," said bigwig. "that makes all the
difference. we shan't stop watching for cats the whole time."
     "why not eat the cat?" said bluebell. "or bring one back here for breeding?
that ought to improve the warren stock no end."
     hazel and bigwig had decided that

returned to say that strawberry felt too ill and that he could find neither
blackberry nor fiver.
     "well, leave fiver," said bigwig. "poor fellow, he'll feel better by himself for a
time, i dare say."
     "he's not in his burrow, though," said acorn.
     "never mind," said bigwig. but the thought came to him, "fiver and
blackberry? could they have left the warren without telling anyone? if they have,
what will happen when the others get to know?" should he ask kehaar to go and
look for them while there was still light? but if kehaar found them, what then?
they could not be compelled to return. or if they were, what good would that do,
if they wanted to be gone? at that moment holly began to speak and everyone
became quiet.
     "we all know we're in a mess," said holly, "and i suppose before long we shall
have to talk about what's best to be done. but i thought that first of all i ought to

himself to reach it. once there, he lay down and at once returned to the sleep of
total exhaustion.
     when bigwig arrived, just before dark, he found fiver snatching a quick feed
in the long grass. it was out of the question to disturb hazel by digging, and they
spent the night crouched beside him on the narrow floor.
     coming out in the gray light before dawn, the first creature bigwig saw was
kehaar, foraging between the elders. he stamped to attract his attention and
kehaar sailed across to him with one beat of his wings and a long glide.
     "meester pigvig, you find meester 'azel?"
     "yes," said bigwig, "he's in the ditch here."
     "'e not dead?"
     "no, but he's wounded and very weak. the farm man shot him with a gun, you
know."
     "you get black stones out?"
     "how do you mean?"

     "take out black stones, 'e get better. 'e come now, ya?"
     "i'll see," said bigwig. he went down to hazel and found him awake and
talking to fiver. when bigwig told him that kehaar was outside he dragged
himself up the short run and into the grass.
     "dis damn gun," said kehaar. "'e put liddle stones for 'urt you. i look, ya?"
     "i suppose you'd better," said hazel. "my leg's still very bad, i'm afraid."
     he lay down and kehaar's head flicked from side to side as though he were
looking for snails in hazel's brown fur. he peered closely up the length of the torn
flank.
     "ees not stones 'ere," he said. "go in, go out -- no stop. now i see you leg.
maybe 'urt you, not long."

     two shotgun pellets were buried in the muscle of the haunch. kehaar detected
them by smell and removed them exactly as he might have picked spiders out of a

     as things turned out, hazel stayed three days at the foot of the hill. the hot
weather continued and for much of the time he sat under the elder branches,
dozing above ground like some solitary hlessi and feeling his strength returning.
fiver stayed with him, keeping the wounds clean and watching his recovery.

     the following morning all the rabbits were out at silflay by dawn and there was
a good deal of excitement as they waited for hazel. during the previous few days
blackberry had had to repeat several times the story of the journey to the farm
and the finding of hazel in the drain. one or two had suggested that kehaar must
have found hazel and told fiver secretly. but kehaar denied this and, when

pressed, replied cryptically that fiver was one who had traveled a good deal
further than he had himself. as for hazel, he had acquired, in everyone's eyes, a
kind of magical quality. of all the warren, dandelion was the last rabbit to fail to
do justice to a good story and he had made the most of hazel's heroic dash out of
the ditch to save his friends from the farmers. no one had even suggested that

     someone called out, "what does fiver think?"

     "i'm certainly going," said fiver quietly. "hazel's perfectly right and there's
nothing the matter with his plan. but i promise you this, all of you. if i do come,
later on, to feel any kind of misgiving, i shan't keep it to myself."
     "and if that happens, i shan't ignore it," said hazel.
     there was silence. then bigwig spoke.
     "you may as well all know that i'm going," he said, "and we shall have kehaar
with us, if that appeals to you at all."
     there was a buzz of surprise.
     "of course, there are some of us who ought to stay here," said hazel. "the farm
rabbits can't be expected to go; and i'm not asking anyone who went the first time
to go back again."
     "i'll come, though," said silver. "i hate general woundwort and his council

nervous voice.
     there was a scuffling in the run that led down from the wood and hazel called,
"who's that?"
     "it's i, hazel-rah -- blackberry."
     "blackberry!" said hazel. "why, i thought you'd been here all the time. where
have you been?"
     "sorry not to have come before," said blackberry. i've been talking to kehaar,
as a matter of fact, about the plan. he's improved it a good deal. if i'm not
mistaken, general woundwort's going to look remarkably silly before we've
finished. i thought at first that it couldn't be done, but now i feel sure it can."
     "come where the grass is greener," said bluebell,
     "and the lettuces grow in rows,
     "and a rabbit of free demeanor
     "is known by his well-scratched nose.

was only trying to cheer everyone up a bit. after all, most of us feel frightened at
the idea of going to this place and you can't blame us, can you? it sounds horribly
dangerous."
     "well, look here," said hazel, "we'll finish this meeting now. let's wait and see
what we decide -- that's the rabbits' way. no one has to go to efrafa who doesn't
want to, but it's clear enough that some of us mean to go. now i'm off to talk to

kehaar myself."
     he found kehaar just inside the trees, snapping and tearing with his great beak
at a foul-smelling piece of flaking brown flesh which seemed to be hanging from a
tracery of bones. he wrinkled his nose in disgust at the odor, which filled the
wood around and was already attracting ants and bluebottles.
     "what on earth is that, kehaar?" he asked. "it smells appalling!"
     "you not know? heem feesh, feesh, come from peeg vater. ees goot."
     "come from big water? (ugh!) did y

eaten kipper. hazel sat choking with nausea and disgust as kehaar lifted it entire
and beat it against a beech root, so that small fragments flew round them. he
collected himself and made an effort.
     "kehaar," he said, "bigwig says you told him you'd come and help us to get the
mothers out of the big warren."
     "ya, ya, i come for you. meester pigvig, 'e need me for 'elp 'im. van 'e dere, 'e

     "yes, rather. it's the only possible way. you're a good friend to us, kehaar."

buckthorn, strawberry and the farm rabbits are to stay with him. anyone else
who wants to stay will be perfectly free to do so."
     "don't worry," said bigwig, from the hole. "i'll send them all up to silflay with
kehaar. they'll go anywhere you like before a duck can dive."

30.     a new journey

     an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is.

          company prospectus of the south sea bubble

     with the exception of buckthorn and the addition of bluebell, the rabbits who
set off from the southern end of the beech hanger early the next morning were
those who had left sandleford with hazel five weeks before. hazel had said
nothing more to persuade them, feeling t

 this occasion) they know that they
are not fit and that their bodies may let them down in the pinch. again, in
speaking about his secret plan, hazel had aroused their curiosity. he had hoped
that, with fiver behind him, he could lure them with hints and promises: and he
had been right. the rabbits trusted him and fiver, who had gotten them out of
sandleford before it was too late, crossed the enborne and the common, taken
bigwig out of the wire, founded the warren on the downs, made an ally of kehaar
and produced two does against all odds. there was no telling what they would do
next. but they were evidently up to something; and since bigwig and blackberry
seemed to be confidently in on it, no one was ready to say that he would rather
stay out; especially since hazel had made it clear that anyone who wished could
remain at home and welcome -- implying that if he was so poor-spirited as to
choose to miss the exploit, they could do without him. holly, in whom loyalty was
second nature, had sa

id no more to queer the pitch. he accompanied them as far
as the end of the wood with all the cheerfulness he could muster; only begging
hazel, out of hearing of the rest, not to underrate the danger. "send news by
kehaar when he reaches you," he said, "and come back soon."
     nevertheless, as silver guided them southward along higher ground to the
west of the farm, almost all, now that they were actually committed to the
adventure, felt dread and apprehension. they had heard enough about efrafa to
daunt the stoutest heart. but before reaching it -- or wherever they were going --
they had to expect two days on the open down. foxes, stoats, weasels -- any of
these might be encountered, and the only recourse wou

efrafa safely and i don't know how you can begin to look for somewhere to hide.
and then the patrol -- if there is one -- they'll be cunning brutes. they might very
well spot us and not show themselves at all -- simply go and report."
     "well, here comes bigwig back again," said hazel. "is it all right, bigwig? good
-- let's get them into the wood and go down the length of it a little way. then we
must slip out on the other side and make sure that kehaar finds us. he's coming
to look for us this afternoon and at all costs we mustn't miss him."
     less than half a mile to the west, they came upon a spinney adjoining the
southern edge of caesar's belt. to the west again was a shallow, dry downland
combe, perhaps four hundred yards across and overgrown with weeds and rough,
yellowing summer tussocks. there, well before sunset, kehaar, flying westward
down the belt, spotted the rabbits lying up, all among the nettles and goose grass.

     "how's holly?" asked hazel.
     "'e sad," said kehaar. "'e say you no come back." then he added, "mees clover,
she ready for mudder."
     "that's good," said hazel. "is anyone doing anything about it?"
     "ya, ya, ees all to fight."
     "oh, well, i suppose it'll sort itself out."
     "vat you do now, meester 'azel?"
     "this is where you start helping, kehaar. we need a place to hide, as near the
big warren as we can safely get -- somewhere where those other rabbits won't find
us. if you know the country well enough, perhaps you can suggest something."
     "meester 'azel, 'ow close you vant?"
     "well, no further away than nuthanger farm is from the honeycomb. in fact,
that's really about the limit."

     "ees only von t'ing, meester 'azel. you go udder side river, den dey not find
you."
     "over the river? you mean we swim across?"
     "na,
 
 ___________________________
 
   "are we to cross, hazel-rah?" asked blackberry.
     "yes," said hazel, "at once. put it between us and efrafa: then we'll feed."
     they went rather hesitantly down into the cutting, half expecting the fiery,
thundering angel of frith to appear out of the twilight; but the silence remained
unbroken. soon they were all feeding in the meadow beyond, too tired to pay
attention to concealment or to anything but the ease of resting their legs and
nibbling the grass.
     from above the larches kehaar sailed down among them, alighted and folded
his long, pale gray wings.
     "meester 'azel, vat you do? you no stay 'ere?"
     "they're tired out, kehaar. they've got to have a rest."
     "ees not to rest 'ere. ees rabbits come."
     "yes, but not just yet. we can--"
     "ya, ya, ees coming for find you! ees close!"
     "oh, curse these confounded patrols!" cried hazel. "come on, all of you, get
down the field into that wood! yes, you, too, speedwell, unless you want to have

ed off in efrafa. come on, move!"
     they tottered over the pasture to the woodland beyond and lay completely
exhausted on flat, bare ground under fir trees. hazel and fiver consulted kehaar
again.
     "it's no good expecting them to go any further, kehaar," said hazel. "they've
been going all night, you know. we'll have to sleep here today. did you actually
see a patrol?"
     "ya, ya, come all along by udder side iron road. yoost in time you go."
     "well, then, you saved us. but look, kehaar, could you go and see where they
are now? if they're gone, i'm going to tell our lot to go to sleep -- not that they
need telling: look at them!"
     kehaar returned with the news that the efrafan patrol had turned back without
crossing the iron road. then he offered to keep watch himself until the evening
and hazel, greatly relieved, at once told the rabbits to sleep. one or two had
already fallen asleep, lying on their sides on the open ground. hazel wondered

ls held in the pale green calices, but most were already star-flowering and
giving off their strong scent. the bats were hunting among the flies and moths
attracted to the soapwort.
     hazel passed hraka and began to feed in the field. he was disturbed to find
that his hind leg was troubling him. he had thought that it was healed, but the
forced journey over the downs had evidently proved too much for the muscle torn
by the shotgun pellets. he wondered whether it was far to the river of which
kehaar had spoken. if it was, he was in for trouble.
     "hazel-rah," said pipkin, coming up from among the soapwort, "are you all
right? your leg looks queer -- you're dragging it."
     "no, it's all right," said hazel. "look, hlao-roo, where's kehaar? i want to talk
to him."
     "he's flown out to see if there's a patrol anywhere near, hazel-rah. bigwig
woke some time ago and he and silver asked kehaar to go. they didn't want to
disturb you."
     hazel felt irritated. it would have been better t

o be told at once which way to

go, rather than to wait while kehaar looked for patrols. they were going to cross a
river and, as far as he was concerned, they could not do it too soon. fretting, he
waited for kehaar. soon he had become as tense and nervous as he had ever been
in his life. he was beginning to believe that after all he might have been rash. it
was clear that holly had not underrated their danger near efrafa. he had little
doubt that bigwig, by sheer chance, had led the fox onto a wide patrol which had
been following their trail. then, in the morning, again by luck and the help of
kehaar, they had evidently just missed another at the crossing of the iron road.
perhaps silver's fear was well f

ounded and a patrol had already spotted and
reported them without their knowing? had general woundwort got some sort of
kehaar of his own? perhaps a bat was at this moment talking to him? how was
one to foresee and guard against everything? the grass seemed sour, the sunshine
chilly. hazel sat hunched under the firs, worrying dismally. he felt less annoyed,
now, with bigwig: he could understand his feelings. waiting was bad. he fidgeted
for some kind of action. just as he had decided to wait no longer, but to collect
everyone and go immediately, kehaar came flying from the direction of the
cutting. he flapped clumsily

down among the firs, silencing the bats.
     "meester 'azel, ees no rabbits. i t'ink maybe dey no like for go across iron
road."
     "good. is it far to the river, kehaar?"
     "na, na. ees close, in vood."
     "splendid. we can find this crossing in daylight?"
     "ya, ya. i show you pridge."
     the rabbits had gone only a short distance through the wood when they sensed
that they were already near the river. the ground became soft and damp. they
could smell sedge and water. suddenly, the harsh, vibrating cry of a moor hen
echoed through the trees, followed by a flapping of wings and a watery scuttering.
the rustling of the leaves seemed also to echo, as t

ble, appeared at his shoulder, hovered, droning and motionless, and was gone
like lightning into the sedge. pipkin leaped back in alarm. as he did so there came
a shrill, vibrant cry and he caught sight, between the plants, of a brilliant azure
bird flashing past over the open water. a few moments later there came, from
close behind the plant hedge, the sound of a fairly heavy splash: but what creature
might have made it there was no telling.
     looking round for hazel, pipkin caught sight of kehaar, a little way off,
standing in a patch of shallow water between two clumps of willow herb. he was
stabbing and snapping at something in the mud and after a few moments pulled
out a six-inch leech and swallowed it whole. beyond him, some distance down the
path, hazel was combing the goose grass out of his coat and evidently listening to
fiver as they sat together under a rhododendron. pipkin ran along the bank and
joined them.
     "there's nothing wrong with the place," fiver was saying. "there

's no more
danger here than anywhere else. kehaar's going to show us where to get across,
isn't he? the thing to do is to get on with it before it gets dark."
     "they'll never stop here," replied hazel. "we can't stay and wait for bigwig in a
place like this. it's unnatural for rabbits."
     "yes, we can -- calm down. they'll get used to it quicker than you think. i tell
you, it's better than one or two other places we've been in. not all strange things
are bad. would you like me to take them over? say it's because of your leg."
     "fine

," said hazel. "hlao-roo, can you get everyone along here?"
     when pipkin had gone, he said, "i feel troubled, fiver. i'm asking so much of
them, and there are so many risks in this plan."
     "they're a better lot than you give them credit for," replied fiver. "if you were
to--"
     kehaar called raucously across, startling a wren out of the bushes.
     "meester 'azel, vat for you vait?"
     "to know where to go," answered fiver.
     "pridge near. you go on, you see."
     where they were, the undergrowth stood close to the green path, but beyond --
downstream, as they all intuitively felt -- it gave way to open parkland. out into
this they went, hazel following fiver.

     hazel did not know what a bridge was. it was another of kehaar's unknown
words that he did not feel up

 to questioning. despite his trust in kehaar and his
respect for his wide experience, he felt still more disturbed as they came into the
open. clearly, this was some sort of man place, frequented and dangerous. a
short way ahead was a road. he could see its smooth, unnatural surface
stretching away over the grass. he stopped and looked at it. at length, when he
was sure that there were no men anywhere near, he went cautiously up to the
verge.
     the road crossed the river on a bridge about thirty feet long. it did not occur to
hazel tha

at least there
was plenty of cover. fiver and pipkin began at once on some scrapes, while hazel
sat chewing pellets and resting his injured leg. soon they were joined by silver
and dandelion, but the other rabbits, more hesitant even than hazel, remained
crouching in the long grass on the right bank. at last, just before darkness fell,
fiver re-crossed the bridge and coaxed them to follow him back. bigwig, to
everyone's surprise, showed considerable reluctance, and only crossed in the end
after kehaar, returning from another flight over efrafa, had asked whether he
would like him to go and fetch a fox.
     the night that followed seemed to all of them disorganized and precarious.
hazel, still conscious of being in man country, was half expecting either a dog or a
cat. but although they heard owls more than once, no elil attacked them and by
the morning they were in better spirits.
     as soon as they had fed, hazel set them to exploring the surroundings. it
became even more plain that the

zel had the idea of picking a fresh
spot and digging again. but presently the day grew so hot and humid that all
activity was quenched. the faint breeze vanished. the sun drew up a torpid
moisture from the watery thickets. the smell of water mint filled all the
hydrophanic air. the rabbits crept into the shade, under any cover that offered.
long before ni-frith, all were drowsing in the undergrowth.
     it was not until the dappled afternoon began to grow cool that hazel woke
suddenly, to find kehaar beside him. the gull was strutting from side to side with
short, quick steps and pecking impatiently in the long grass. hazel sat up quickly.
     "what is it, kehaar? not a patrol?"
     "na, na. ees all fine for sleep like bloody owls. maybe i go for peeg vater.

meester 'azel, you getting mudders now soon? vat for vait now?"
     "no, you're right, kehaar, we must start now. the trouble is, i can see how to
start but not how to finish."
     hazel made his way through the grass, roused the

first rabbit he found -- who
happened to be bluebell -- and sent him to fetch bigwig, blackberry and fiver.
when they came, he took them to join kehaar on the short grass of the riverbank.
     "this is the problem, blackberry," he said. "you remember that when we were
under the down that evening i said we should have to do three things: get the
does out of efrafa, break up the pursuit and then get right away so that they
wouldn't find us. this plan you've thought up is clever. it'll do the first two things,
all right, i'm sure of that. but what about the last one? the efrafan rabbits are
fast and savage. they'll find us if we're to be found a

them to a finish -- we're too
few. and on top of that, my leg seems to be bad again. so what's to be done?"
     "i don't know," answered blackberry. "but, obviously, we shall need to
disappear. could we swim the river? no scent then, you know."
     "it's too swift," said hazel. "we'd be carried away. but even if we did swim it,
we couldn't count on not being followed. from what i've heard of these efrafans,
they'd certainly swim the river if they thought we had. what it comes to is that,
with kehaar to help us, we can break up a pursuit while we're getting the does
out, but they'll know which way we've gone and they won't leave it at that. no,
you're right, we've got to vanish without a trace, so that they can't even track us.
but how?"
     "i don't know," said blackberry again. "shall we go up the river a little way and
have a look at it? perhaps there's somewhere we could use for a hiding place. can
you manage that, with your leg?"
     "if we don't go too far," replied hazel.

 somewhere in this jungle, they became aware of another sound -- the falling
water which they had heard on their approach the day before. soon they reached
a place where the river curved round in a bend from the east, and here they came
upon the broad, shallow fall. it was no more than a foot high -- one of those
artificial falls, common on the chalk streams, made to attract trout. several were
already rising to the evening hatch of fly. just above the fall a plank footbridge
crossed the river. kehaar flew up, circled the pool and perched on the hand rail.
     "this is more sheltered and lonely than the bridge we crossed last night," said
blackberry. "perhaps we could make some use of it. you didn't know about this
bridge, kehaar, did you?"
     "na, not know, not see heem. but ees goot pridge -- no von come."

     "i'd like to go across, hazel-rah," said blackberry.
     "well, fiver's the rabbit for that," replied hazel. "he simply loves crossing
bridges. you carry on. i'll come behind,

he banks the current was as swift as in midstream, on account of weed-
cutting and sound camp-sheeting. as hazel came nearer, he saw that blackberry
had actually scrambled on the thing. his claws made a faint hollow sound on the
wood, so there must be water underneath. whatever it might be, the thing did not
extend downward to the bottom: it was lying on the water.
     "what are you after, blackberry?" he said rather sharply.
     "food," replied blackberry. "flayrah. can't you smell it?"
     kehaar had alighted on the middle of the thing, and was snapping away at
something white. blackberry scuttered along the wood toward him and began to
nibble at some kind of greenstuff. after a little while hazel also ventured out on
the wood and sat in the sunshine, watching the flies on the warm, varnished
surface and sniffing the strange river smells that came up from the water.
     "what is this man thing, kehaar?" he asked. "is it dangerous?"
     "na, no dangerous. you not know? ees poat. at pee

     kehaar went on pecking at the broken pieces of stale bread. blackberry, who
had finished the fragments of lettuce he had found, was sitting up and looking
over the very low side, watching a stone-colored, black-spotted trout swim up
into the fall. the "boat" was a miniature punt, used for reed-cutting -- little more
than a raft, with a single thwart amidships. even when it was unmanned, as now,
there were only a few inches of freeboard.
     "you know," said fiver from the bank, "seeing you sitting th

that other wooden thing you found when the dog was in the wood and you got

     "i remember shoving you along," said bigwig. "it was jolly cold."
     "what puzzles me," said blackberry, "is why this boat thing doesn't go along.
everything in this river goes along, and fast, too -- see there." he looked out at a
piece of stick floating down on the even two-mile-an-hour current. "so what's
stopping this thing from going?"
     kehaar had a short-way-with-landlubbers manner which he sometimes used to
those of the rabbits that he did not particularly like. blackberry was not one of his

favorites: he preferred straightforward characters such as bigwig, buckthorn and
silver.

     "yes, i see," said fiver. "the rope goes round that metal thing where hazel's

aw it through and the leaf -- the boat -- would drop off the bank."
     "well, anyway, let's go back now," said hazel, rather dejectedly. "i'm afraid we
don't seem to be any nearer to finding what we're looking for, kehaar. can you
possibly wait until tomorrow? i had the idea that we might all move to
somewhere a bit drier before tonight -- higher up in the wood, away from the
river."
     "oh, what a pity!" said bluebell. "do you know, i'd quite decided to become a
water rabbit."
     "a what?" asked bigwig.
     "a water rabbit," repeated bluebell. "well, there are water rats and water
beetles and pipkin says that last night he saw a water hawk. so why not a water
rabbit? i shall float merrily along--"

do you mind explaining?"
     then and there, while the black gnats settled on their ears, by the plank bridge
and the pouring waterfall, blackberry and fiver explained.
     "could you just go and try the rope, hazel-rah?" added blackberry, when he
had finished. "it may be too thick."
     they went back to the punt.
     "no, it's not," said hazel, "and it's stretched tight, of course, which makes it
much easier to gnaw. i can gnaw that, all right."
     "ya, ees goot," said kehaar. "you go fine. but you do heem queek, ya? maybe
somet'ing change. man come, take poat -- you know?"
     "there's nothing more to wait for," said hazel. "go on, bigwig, straightaway,
and may el-ahrairah go with you. and remember, you're the leader now. send
word by kehaar what you want us to do; we shall all be here, ready to back you
up."
     afterward, they all remembered how bigwig had taken his orders. no one
could say that he did not practice what he preached. he hesitated a few moments

nd then looked squarely at hazel.
     "it's sudden," he said. "i wasn't expecting it tonight. but that's all to the good --
i hated waiting. see you later."
     he touched his nose to hazel's, turned and hopped away into the undergrowth.

a few minutes later, guided by kehaar, he was running up the open pasture north
of the river, straight for the brick arch in the overgrown railway embankment and
the fields that lay beyond.

     "leave him," said chervil. "he's none of our business. the owslafa will keep
him here until the mark come back and after that they'll take him away."
     bigwig made his way into the field, conscious of the wary glances of the rabbits
he passed. he felt perplexed and apprehensive. how was he to begin his
dangerous task? begin he must, in one way or another, for kehaar had made it
clear that he was not ready to wait. there was nothing for it but to take a chance
and trust somebody. but whom? a warren like this must be full of spies. probably
only general woundwort knew who the spies were. was there a spy watching him
now?
     "i shall just have to trust my feelings," he thought. "i'll go round the place a bit
and see if i can make any friends. but i know one thing -- if i do succeed in
getting any does out of here, i'll take that poor wretched blackavar with

there like that. general woundwort indeed! a gun's too good for him."
     nibbling and pondering, he moved slowly over the open meadow in the
evening sun. after a while he found that he was approaching a small hollow,
much like the one on watership down where he and silver had found kehaar. in
this hollow there were four does, with their backs to him. he recognized them as
the little group who had gone out last. they had evidently finished the hungry,
intent stage of feeding and were browsing and talking at leisure, and he could see
that one of them had the attention of the other three. even more than most
rabbits, bigwig loved a story and now he felt attracted by the prospect of hearing
something new in this strange warren. he moved quietly up to the edge of the
hollow just as t

crixa and report to the general."
     as soon as the mark had gone underground and blackavar had been taken
away by his escort, bigwig excused himself to chervil and avens and went to his
own burrow. although the rank and file were cramped underground, the sentries
had two large, roomy burrows to themselves, while each officer had a private
burrow. by himself at last, bigwig settled down to think over his problem.
     the difficulties were bewildering. he was fairly certain that with kehaar's help
he himself could escape from efrafa whenever he wished. but how in the world
was he to bring a bunch of does out -- supposing that any were ready to try it? if
he took it upon himself to call the sentries in during a silflay, chervil would see in
a matter of moments what he had done. the only possibility, then, was to make
the break-out during the day: to wait until chervil was asleep and then order a
sentry to leave his post at the mouth of one of the holes. bigwig considered. he

     "we heard that there was no officer to spare, with bugloss under arrest and
charlock dead."
     "those rabbits returned to us safely. one of them is not far away now, with our
chief rabbit and several more. they are cunning and resourceful. they are
waiting for me to bring does out of efrafa -- as many as i can get to come. i shall
be able to send them a message tomorrow morning."
     "how?"
     "by a bird -- if all goes well." bigwig told her about kehaar. when he had
finished, hyzenthlay made no reply and he could not tell whether she was
considering all that he had said or whether fear and disbelief had so troubled her
that she did not know what to say. did she think he was a spy trying to trap her?
did she perhaps wish only that he would let her go away? at last he said,
     "do you believe me?"
     "yes, i believe you."
     "might i not be a spy sent by the council?"
     "you are not. i can tell."
     "how?"
     "you spoke of your frie

 if he had to fight him, it would be better to
avoid doing it between blackavar and the mouth of the hole, for blackavar would
be as bewildered as the rest and might bolt back down the run. if he was going to
bolt anywhere he must bolt outward. of course, with any luck, the second guard
might make off underground without fighting at all, but one could not count on
that. efrafan owslafa were not given to running away.
     as he went out into the field, he wondered whether he would be spotted by
kehaar. the arrangement had been that kehaar would find him whenever he
might come above ground on the second day.
     he need not have worried. kehaar had been over efrafa since before dawn. as
soon as he saw the mark come up, he alighted a little way out in the field, halfway
between the undergrowth and the sentry line, and began pecking about in the
grass. bigwig nibbled his way slowly toward him and then settled down to feed
without a glance in his direction. after a while, he sensed that kehaar

was behind
him, a little to one side.
     "meester pigvig, i t'ink ees not goot ve talk much. meester 'azel, 'e say vat you
do? vat you vant?"
     "i want two things, kehaar -- both at sunset tonight. first, our rabbits must be

down by the big arch. i shall come through that arch with the does. if we're
pursued, you and hazel and the rest must be ready to fight. the boat thing, is it
still there?"
     "ya, ya, men no take heem. i tell meester 'azel vat you say."
     "good. now listen, kehaar, this is the second thing, and it's terribly important.
you see those rabbits out beyond us, in the field? they're the sentries. at sunset,
you meet me here. then i shall run back to those trees and go down a hole. as
soon as you see me go in, attack the sentries -- terrify them, drive them away. if
they won't run, hurt them. they must be driven off. you'll see me come out again
almost at once and then the does -- the mothers -- will start running with me and
we'll go straight down to the arch.

but we may very well be attacked on the way. if
that happens, can you pile in again?"
     "ya, ya. i fly at dem -- dey no stop you."
     "splendid. that's it, then. hazel and the others -- are they all right?"
     "fine -- fine. dey say you damn good fella. meester pluebell, 'e say to pring one
mudder for everyone else and two for 'im."
     bigwig was trying to think of some appropriate reply to this when he saw
chervil running across the grass toward him. at once, without speaking again to
kehaar, he took a few hops in chervil's direction and began biting busily at a
patch of clover. as chervil came up, kehaar flew low above their heads and
disappeared over the trees.
     chervil looked after the flying gull and then turned to bigwig.
     "aren't you afraid of those birds?" he asked.
     "not particularly," answered bigwig.
     "they sometimes attack mice, you know, and rabbit kittens, too," said chervil.
"you were taking a risk, feeding there. why were you so careless?"
     for an

rk have seen it. in fact, i shall
go and report it now. silflay's nearly over, so if i'm not back in time, you and
avens had better see the mark underground yourselves."
     as soon as chervil had left him, bigwig went to look for hyzenthlay. he found
her in the hollow with thethuthinnang. most of the mark did not appear to be
unduly affected by the thunder, which was still distant, as chervil had said. the
two does, however, were subdued and nervous. bigwig told them what he had
arranged with kehaar.
     "but will this bird really attack the sentries?" asked thethuthinnang. "i've
never heard of anything like that."

     "it will, i promise you. get the does together as soon as silflay begins this
evening. when i come out with blackavar, the sentries will be running for cover."
     "and which way do we run?" asked thethuthinnang.
     bigwig took them well out into the field, so that they could see the distant arch
in the embankment about four hundred yards away.
     "we're bound to me

passed him without a glance. they looked tense but steady. chervil followed the
last rabbit.
     bigwig waited until he was sure that chervil had had time to get well away
from the hole. then, with a last, quick look to where blackavar was sitting, he
went out himself. the bright sunset dazzled him and he sat up on his hind legs,
blinking and combing the fur along one side of his face as his eyes got accustomed
to the light. a few moments later he saw kehaar come flying across the field.
     "this is it, then," he said to himself. "here we go."
     at that moment a rabbit spoke from behind him.
     "thlayli, i want a few words with you. just come back under the bushes, will
you?"
     bigwig dropped on his front paws and looked round.
     it was general woundwort.

     *marli -- a doe. tharn -- stupefied, distraught. in this particular context, the
nearest translation might be "the maiden all forlorn."

     "yes, sir."
     "i'm not at all sure the trouble's over there, thlayli. keep an eye on it. if she'll
talk to you, so much the better. perhaps those does are settling down and perhaps
they aren't. i want to know."
     "very well, sir," said bigwig.
     "that's all," said woundwort. "you'd better get back to your mark now."
     bigwig made his way into the field. the silflay was almost over, the sun had set
and it was growing dark. heavy clouds dimmed the afterlight. kehaar was
nowhere to be seen. the sentries came in and the mark began to go underground.
sitting alone in the grass, he waited until the last rabbit had disappeared. there
was still no sign of kehaar. he hopped slowly to the hole. entering, he knocked
into one of the police escort, who was blocking the mouth to make sure that
blackavar did not try to bolt as he was taken down.
     "get out of my way, you dirty little tale-bearing bloodsucker," said bigwig.
"now go and report that," he added over his

ight faded from the thick sky, hazel slipped once more across the hard,
bare earth under the railway arch, came out on the north side and sat up to listen.
a few moments later fiver joined him and they crept a little way into the field,
toward efrafa. the air was close and warm and smelled of rain and ripening
barley. there was no sound close by, but behind and below them, from the water
meadow on the nearer bank of the test, came faintly the shrill, incessant fussing

of a pair of sandpipers. kehaar flew down from the top of the embankment.
     "you're sure he said tonight?" asked hazel for the third time.
     "ees bad," said kehaar. "maybe dey catch 'im. ees finish meester pigvig. you
t'ink?"
     hazel made no reply.
     "i can't tell," said fiver. "clouds and thunder. that place up the field -- it's like
the bottom of a river. anything could be happening in there."
     "bigwig's there. suppose he's dead? suppose they're trying to make him tell
them--"
     "hazel," said fiver. "haze

rabbits are in danger here. kehaar can go up tomorrow at dawn and bring us
another message."
     "i dare say you're right," said hazel, "but i hate to go. just suppose he were to
come. let silver take them back and i'll stay here."
     "you couldn't do any good by yourself, hazel, even if your leg was all right.
you're trying to eat grass that isn't there. why don't you give it a chance to grow?"
     they returned under the arch and as silver came out of the bushes to meet
them, they could hear the other rabbits stirring unea

 how long could it be before
he took the final step of fitting all these things together? perhaps he had already
done so and was merely waiting to arrest them in his own time?
     woundwort had every advantage. he sat secure at the junction of all paths,
seeing clearly down each, while he, bigwig, ludicrous in his efforts to measure up
to him as an enemy, clambered clumsily and ignorantly through the
undergrowth, betraying himself with every movement. he did not know how to

get in touch with kehaar again. even if he managed to do so, would hazel be able
to bring the rabbits a second time? perhaps they had already been spotted by
campion on patrol? to speak to blackavar would be suspect. to go near kehaar
would be suspect. through more holes than he could possibly stop, his secret was
leaking -- pouring -- out.
     there was worse to come.

     late in the afternoon it came on dark and very close. it was plain that there
would be no true sunset. on the green path by the riverbank, hazel sat fidgeting
as he tried to imagine what might be going on in efrafa.
     "he told you he wanted you to attack the sentries while the rabbits were
feeding, didn't he," he said to kehaar, "and that he'd bring the mothers out in the
confusion?"
     "ya, say dis, but not 'appen. den 'e say go away, come again tonight."
     "so that's still what he means to do. the question is, when will they be
feeding? it's getting dark already. silver, what do you think?"
     "if i know them, they won't alter anything they usually do," said silver. "but if
you're worried in case we're not there in time, why not go now?"
     "because they're always patrolling. the longer we wait up there, th

e greater the
risk. if a patrol finds us before bigwig comes, it won't be just a matter of getting
ourselves away. they'll realize we're there for some purpose and give the alarm,
and that'll be the end of any chance he's got."
     "listen, hazel-rah," said blackberry. "we ought to reach the iron road at the
same time as bigwig and not a moment before. why don't you take them all over
the river now and wait in the undergrowth, near the boat? once kehaar's attacked
the sentries, he can fly back and tell us."
     "yes, that's it," answered hazel. "but once he's told us, we must get up there in
no time at all. bigwig's going to need us as well as kehaar."
     "well, you won't be able to dash up to the arch," said fiver, "with your leg. the
best thing you can do is to get on the boat and have the rope gnawed half through
by the time we come back. silver can look after the fighting, if there's going to be
any."
     hazel hesitated. "but some of

 do. blackavar, are
you all right?"
     "yes, sir," said blackavar, "but what do we do now?"
     "follow me," said bigwig, "all of you. come on!"
     he led the way out again. there was no sign of bartsia, but as he looked back
to make sure that the others were following, he caught a glimpse of the
astonished face of avens peering out of the other hole.
     "captain chervil wants you!" he called, and dashed away into the field.
     as he reached the clump of thistles where he had spoken to kehaar that
morning, a long roll of thunder sounded from across the valley beyond. a few
great, warm drops of rain were falling. along the western horizon the lower
clouds formed a single purple mass, against which distant trees stood out minute
and sharp. the upper edges rose into the light, a far land of wild mountains.
copper-colored, weightless and motionless, they suggested a glassy fragility like
that of frost. surely, when the thunder struck them again they would vibrate,
tremble and shatter, t

 "they're coming!"
     "well, run, then," said bigwig. "keep near me, all of you."
     they were better runners than he had dared to hope. as they made for the ash
tree, more does fell in with them and it seemed to him that they ought now to be a
match for a patrol, unless it were a very strong one. once through the hedge he
turned south and, keeping close beside it, led them down the slope. there, ahead
of him, was the arch in the overgrown embankment. but would hazel be there?
and where was kehaar?

          -<*>-

     "well, and what was to happen after that, nelthilta?" asked general
woundwort. "make sure you tell us everything, because we know a good deal
already. let her alone, vervain," he added. "she can't talk if you keep cuffing her,
you fool."
     "hyzenthlay said -- oh! oh! -- she said a big bird would attack the owsla
sentries," gasped nelthilta, "and we would run away in the confusion. and then--"
     "she said a bird would attack the sentries?" interrupted woundwort, puz

f the murky light and increasing rain. but the sight of the general was
more alarming still. pausing only to stamp the escape alarm, they set out behind
him toward the iron road.
     very soon they came upon traces of blood which the rain had not yet washed
away, and these they followed toward the ash tree in the hedge to the west of the
warren.

          -<*>-

     bigwig came out from the further side of the railway arch, sat up and looked
round him. there was no sign either of hazel or of kehaar. for the first time since

he had attacked bartsia he began to feel uncertain and troubled. perhaps, after
all, kehaar had not understood his cryptic message that morning? or had some
disaster overtaken hazel and the rest? if they were dead -- scattered -- if there
was no one left alive to meet him? he and his does would wander about the fields
until the patrols hunted them down.
     "no, it shan't come to that," said bigwig to himself. "at the worst we can cross
the river and try to hide in

im at once. there was something to be said for efrafan
discipline, thought bigwig grimly, as they left the arch and met the force of the
rain.
     along one side of the field, beside the elms, farm tractors had pounded a
broad, flat path downhill toward the water meadow below -- that same path up
which he had run three nights before, after he had left hazel by the boat. it was
turning muddy now -- unpleasant going for rabbits -- but at least it led straight to
the river and was open enough for kehaar to spot them if he should turn up.
     he had just begun to run once more when a rabbit overtook him.
     "stop, thlayli! what are you doing here? where are you going?"
     bigwig had been half expecting campion to appear and had made up his mind
to kill him if necessary. but now that he actually saw him at his side, disregarding
the storm and the mud, self-possessed as he led his patrol, no more than four
strong, into the thick of a pack of desperate runaways, he could feel only what a
pity

moment,

through the all-enveloping sound of the rain, there sounded a raucous clamor.
     "yark! yark! yark!"
     some big white thing was striking at woundwort, who was cowering and
guarding his head as best he could. then it was gone, sailing upward and turning
in the rain.
     "meester pigvig, ees rabbits come!"
     sights and feelings swirled through bigwig as though in a dream. the things
that were happening no longer seemed connected by anything except his own
dazed senses. he heard kehaar screaming as he dived again to attack vervain. he
felt the rain pouring cold into the open gash in his shoulder. through the curtain
of rain he glimpsed woundwort dodging among his officers and urging them back
into the ditch on the edge of the field. he saw blackavar striking at campion and
campion turning to run. then someone beside him was saying, "hullo, bigwig.
bigwig! bigwig! what do you want us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're
 
 ___________________________
 
 wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.
     "you did it, then,

 bigwig," said blackberry, shivering. "was it very bad? good
heavens, your shoulder--"
     "it's not finished yet," said bigwig. "has everyone passed you?"
     "you're the last," said blackberry. "can we go? this storm's terrifying me!"
     kehaar alighted beside them.
     "meester pigvig," he said, "i fly on does damn rabbits, but dey no run, dey get
in ditch. i no catch 'em in dere. dey coming all along beside you."
     "they'll never give up," said bigwig. "i warn you, silver, they'll be at us before
it's done. there's thick cover in the water meadow -- they'll use that. acorn, come
back, keep away from that ditch!"
     "go back to bluebell! go back to bluebell!" repeated silver, running from side
to side.
     they found bluebell

acorn and two does with him. that's everyone. come on, quick as you can."
     it was only a short distance now to the river, but among the sodden patches of
rushes, the bushes and sedge and deep puddles, they found it next to impossible
to tell their direction. expecting to be attacked at any moment, they scuttered and
floundered through the undergrowth, finding here a doe and there one of their
own rabbits and forcing them on. without kehaar they would certainly have lost
all touch with each other and perhaps never reached the river. the gull kept flying
backward and forward along the direct line to the bank, only alighting now and
then to guide bigwig toward some straggling doe whom he had spotted going the
wrong way.
     "kehaar," said bigwig, as they waited for thethuthinnang to struggle up to
them through a half-flattened clump of nettles, "will you go and see whether you
can spot the efrafans? they can't be far away. but why

     kehaar was back in a very short time.

     "did he?" said bigwig. "the brute's got courage, i'll give him that."
     "dey t'ink you got to cross river dere or else go all along pank. dey not know
heem poat. you near poat now."
     fiver came running through the undergrowth.
     "we've been able to get some of them on the boat, bigwig," he said, "but most
of them won't trust me. they just keep

 little way
downstream, campion and his patrol had emerged from the bushes and were
coming up the path. from the opposite direction vervain, chervil and groundsel
were approaching. the doe turned and darted for the undergrowth immediately
behind her. just as she reached it, woundwort himself appeared in her way,
reared up and dealt her a great, raking blow across the face. the doe turned once
more and ran blindly across the path and onto the boat.
     bigwig realized that since the moment when kehaar had attacked him in the
field, woundwort had not only retained control over his officers but had actually

made a plan and put it into effect. the storm and the difficult going had upset the
fugitives and disorganized them. woundwort, on the other hand, had taken his
rabbits into the ditch and then made use of it to get them down to the water
meadow, unexposed to further attack from kehaar. once there, he must have
gone straight for the plank bridge -- which he evidently knew about -- and set 
 
 ___________________________
 
an
ambush under cover. but as soon as he had grasped that for some reason the
runaways were not making for the bridge after all, he had instantly sent campion
to make his way round through the undergrowth, regain the bank downstream
and cut them off; and campion had done this without error or delay. now
woundwort meant to fight them, here on the bank. he knew that kehaar could
not be everywhere and that the bushes and undergrowth provided enough cover,
at a pinch, to dodge him. it was true that the other side had twice his numbers,
but most of them were afraid of him and none was a trained efrafan officer. now
that he had them pinned against the river, he would split them up and kill as
many as possible. the rest could run away and come to grief as they might.
     bigwig began to understand why woundwort's officers followed him and
fought for him as they did.

, quoting a
rabbit proverb. "how did you get that wound? it's a nasty one."
     "i fought a member of the council police," said bigwig.
     "a what?" the term "owslafa" was unknown to hazel.
     "a dirty little beast like hufsa," said bigwig.
     "did you beat him?"
     "oh, yes -- or i shouldn't be here. i should think he'll stop running. i say,
hazel-rah, we've got the does. what's going to happen now?"
     "i don't know," said hazel. "we need one of these clever rabbits to tell us. and
kehaar -- where's he gone? he's supposed to know about this thing we're sitting
on."
     dandelion, crouching beside hazel, got up at the mention of "clever rabbits,"
made his way across the puddled floor and returned with blackberry and fiver.
     "we're all wondering what to do next," said hazel.
     "well," said blackberry, "i suppose we shall drift into the bank before long and
then we can get out and find cover. there's no harm, though, in going a good long
way from those friends of bigwig's."
 
 ___________________________
 

     "there is," said hazel. "we're stuck here in full view and we can't run. if a man
sees us we're in trouble."
     "men don't like rain," said blackberry. "neither do i, if it comes to that, but it
makes us safer just now."
     at this moment hyzenthlay, sitting just behind him, started and looked up.
     "excuse me, sir, for interrupting you," she said, as though speaking to an
officer in efrafa, "but the bird -- the white bird -- it's coming toward us."
     kehaar came flying up the river through the rain and alighted on the narrow
side of the punt. the does nearest to him backed away nervously.
     "meester 'azel," he said, "pridge come. you see 'im pridge?"
     it had not occurred to any of the rabbits that they were floating beside the path
up which they had come earlier that evening before the storm broke. they were
on the opposite side of the hedge of plants along the bank and the whole river
looked different. but now they saw, not far ahead, the 
 
 ___________________________
 
bridge which they had
crossed when they first came to the test four nights before. this they recognized
at once, for it looked the same as it had from the bank.
     "maybe you go under 'im, maybe not," said kehaar. "but you sit dere, ees
trouble."
     the bridge stretched from bank to bank between two low abutments. it was
not arched. its underside, made of iron girders, was perfectly straight -- parallel
with the surface and about eight inches above it. just in time hazel saw what
kehaar meant. if the punt did pass under the bridge without sticking, it would do

so by no more than a claw's breadth. any creature above the level of the sides
would be struck and perhaps knocked into the river. he scuttered through the
warm bilgewater to the other end and pushed his way up among the wet, crowded
rabbits.
     "get down in the bottom! get down in the bottom!" he said. "silver, hawkbit --
all of you. never mind the water. you, and you -- what's your name? oh,
blackavar, is it? -- ge
 
 ___________________________
 
t everyone into the bottom. be quick."
     like bigwig, he found that the efrafan rabbits obeyed him at once. he saw
kehaar fly up from his perch and disappear over the wooden rails. the concrete
abutments projected from each bank, so that the narrowed river ran slightly
faster under the bridge. the punt had been drifting broadside on, but now one
end swung forward, so that hazel lost his bearings and found that he was no
longer looking at the bridge but at the bank. as he hesitated, the bridge seemed to
come at him in a dark mass, like snow sliding from a bough. he pressed himself
into the bilge. there was a squeal

 and a rabbit tumbled on top of him. then a
heavy blow vibrated along the length of the punt and its smooth movement was
checked. this was followed by a hollow sound of scraping. it grew dark and a roof
appeared, very low above him. for a moment hazel had the vague idea that he
was underground. then the roof vanished, the punt was gliding on and he heard
kehaar calling. they were below the bridge and still drifting downstream.
     the rabbit who had fallen on him was acorn. he had been struck by the bridge
and the blow had sent him flying. however, though dazed and bruised, he seemed
to have escaped injury.
     "i wasn't quick enough, hazel-rah," he said. "i'd better go to efrafa for a bit."
     "you'd be wasted," said hazel. "but i'm afraid there's someone at the other end
who hasn't been so lucky."
     one of the does had held back from the bilg

ewater, and the upstream girder
under the bridge had caught her across the back. it was plain that she was
injured, but how badly hazel could not tell. he saw hyzenthlay beside her and it
seemed to him that since there was nothing he could do to help, it would probably
be best to let them alone. he looked round at his bedraggled, shivering comrades
and then at kehaar, spruce and brisk on the stem.
     "we ought to get back on the bank, kehaar," he said. "how can we do it?
rabbits weren't meant for this, you know."
     "you not stop poat. but again is nudder pridge more. 'e stop 'im."
     there was nothing to be done but wait. they drifted on and came to a second
bend, where the river curved westward. the current did not slacken and the punt
came round the bend almost in the middle of the stream, revolving as it did so.
the rabbits had been frightened by what had happened to acorn and to the doe,
and remained squatting miserably, h

begun to drift more slowly. the nearer bank was high and the trees stood close
and thick, but on the further bank the ground was low and open. grassy, it
stretched away, smooth as the mown gallops on watership down. hazel hoped
that they might somehow drop out of the current and reach that side, but the
punt moved quietly on, down the very center of the broad pool. the open bank

slipped by and now the trees towered on both sides. downstream, the pool was
closed by the second bridge, of which kehaar had spoken.
     it was old, built of darkened bricks. ivy trailed over it and the valerian and
creeping mauve toadflax. well out from either bank stood four low arches --
scarcely more than culverts, each filled by the stream to within a foot of the apex.
through them, thin segments of daylight showed from the downstream side. the
piers did not project, but against each lay a little accumulation of flotsam, from
which driftweed and sticks continually broke away to be carried through the
bridge

of leaves, the splashing of the raindrops and some curious thing that
appeared to be standing in the water and to be made of vertical gray lines -- these
were all that could be made out. the rain echoed dismally up the culvert. the
hard, ringing noise from under the soffit, so much unlike any sound to be heard
in an earth tunnel, was disturbing. hazel returned to blackberry and silver.
     "this is as bad a fix as we've been in," he said. "we can't stay here, but i can't
see any way out."
     kehaar appeared on the parapet above them, flapped the rain out of his wings
and dropped down to the punt.
     "ees finish poat," he said. "not vait more."
     "but how can we get to the bank, kehaar?" said hazel.
     the gull was surprised. "dog sveem, rat sveem. you no sveem?"

     "yes, we can swim as long as it's not very far. but the banks are too steep for
us, kehaar. we wouldn't be able to stop the current taking us down one of these
tunnels and we don't know what's at the other end."
    
 
 ___________________________
 
 "ees goot -- you get out fine."
     hazel felt at a loss. what exactly was he to understand from this? kehaar was
not a rabbit. whatever the big water was like, it must be worse than this and
kehaar was used to it. he never said much in any case and what he did say was
always restricted to the simplest, since he spoke no lapine. he was doing them a
good turn because they had saved his life but, as hazel knew, he could not help
despising them for timid, helpless, stay-at-home creatures who could not fly. he
was often impatient. did he mean that he had looked at the river and considered
it as if he were a rabbit? that there was slack water immediately below the bridge,
with a low, shelving b

 mean that they had better hurry up and take a
chance on being able to do what he himself could do without difficulty? this
seemed more likely. suppose one of them did jump out of the boat and go down
with the current -- what would that tell the others, if he did not come back?
     poor hazel looked about him. silver was licking bigwig's wounded shoulder.
blackberry was fidgeting on and off the thwart, strung up, able to feel only too
clearly all that hazel felt himself. as he still hesitated, kehaar let out a squawk.
     "yark! damn rabbits no goot. vat i do, i show you."
     he tumbled clumsily off the raised bow. there was no gap between the punt
and the dark mouth of the culvert. sitting low in the water like a mallard, he
floated into the tunnel and vanished. peering after him, hazel could at first see
nothing. then he made out kehaar's shape black against the light at the far end.
it floated into daylight, turned sideways and passed out of the restricted view.
     "what does that p

rove?" said blackberry, his teeth chattering. "he may have
flown off the surface or put his great webbed feet down. it's not he that's soaked
through and shivering and twice as heavy with wet fur."
     kehaar reappeared on the parapet above.
     "you go now," he said shortly.
     still the wretched hazel hung back. his leg had begun to hurt again. the sight
of bigwig -- bigwig of all rabbits -- at the end of his tether, half unconscious,
playing no part in this desperate exploit, lowered his courage still more. he knew
that he had not got it in him to jump into the water. the horrible situation was
beyond him. he stumbled on the slippery planking and, as he sat up, found fiver
beside him.
     "i'
 
 ___________________________
 
ll go, hazel," said fiver quietly. "i think it'll be all right."
     he put his front paws on the edge of the bow. then, on the instant, all the
rabbits froze motionless. one of the does stamped on the puddled floor of the
punt. from above came the sounds of approaching footsteps and men's voices,
and the smell of a burning white stick.
     kehaar flew away. not a rabbit moved. the footsteps grew nearer, the voices
louder. they were on the bridge above, no further away than the height of a
hedge. every one of the rabbits was seized by the instinct to run, to go
underground. hazel saw hyzenthlay looking at him and returned her stare,
willing her with all his might to keep still. the voices, the smell of men's sweat, of

leather, of white sticks, the pain in his leg, the damp, chuckling tunnel at his very
ear -- he had known them all befo

, from the
brickwork of the bridge near the opposite bank to a point a little below them on
their own side, was a grating of thin, vertical iron rods. in the cutting season the
river weed, drifting in tangled mats from the fishing reaches above, was held
against this grating and raked out of the pool by men in waders, who piled it to be
used as compost. the left bank was a great rubbish heap of rotting weed among
the trees. it was a green, rank-smelling place, humid and enclosed.
     "good old kehaar!" said hazel, gazing with satisfaction round the fetid
solitude. "i should have trusted him."
     as he spoke, a third rabbit came swimming out from under the bridge. the
sight of him, struggling in the current like a fly in a spider's web, filled them both

with fear. to watch another in danger can be almost as bad as sharing it. the
rabbit fetched up against the grating, drifted a little way along it, found the
bottom and crawled out of the turbid water. it was blackavar. he lay on his side

er in a clump of
reeds downstream. evidently the poor creature had felt that she was going to die
and, in the manner of animals, had slipped away.
     the news depressed hazel. he knew that they had been lucky to get so many
does out of efrafa and to escape from woundwort without having to stand and
fight. the plan had been a good one, but the storm and the frightening efficiency
of the efrafans had nearly defeated it. for all the courage of bigwig and of silver,
they would have failed without kehaar. now kehaar was going to leave them,
bigwig was wounded, and his own leg was none too good. with the does to look
after, they would not be able to travel in the open as fast or as easily as they had
on the way down from watership. he would have liked to stay where they were
for a few days, so that bigwig could recover his strength and the does find their
feet and get used to life outside a warren. but the place, he realized, was
hopelessly inhospitable. although there was good cover, it was too

before men found the boat; then very likely several would be close by for some
time. this decided hazel that they had better set out at once and try to reach
somewhere where they could rest more easily. he could hear and smell that the
swamp extended a long way downstream. with the road lying to the south, the
only way seemed to be northward, over the bridge, which was in any case the way
home.
     taking bigwig with him, he climbed the bank to the grass track. the first thing
they saw was kehaar, picking slugs out of a clump of hemlock near the bridge.
they came up to him without speaking and began to nibble the short grass
nearby.
     after a little while kehaar said, "now you getting mudders, meester 'azel. all
go fine, eh?"
     "yes. we'd never have done it without you, kehaar. i hear you turned up just in
time to save bigwig last night."
     "dis bad rabbit, pig fella, 'e go fight me. plenty clever, too."
     "yes. he got a shock for once, though."
     "ya, ya. meester 'azel,

     "shall we see you again, kehaar?"

     "you go back hills? stay dere?"
     "yes, we mean to get there. it's going to be hard going with so many rabbits,
and there'll be efrafan patrols to dodge, i expect."
     "you get dere, later on ees vinter, plenty cold, plenty storm on peeg vater.
plenty bird come in. den i come back, see you vere you live."
     "don't forget, then, kehaar, will you?" said bigwig. "we shall be looking out for
you. come down suddenly, like you did last night."
     "ya, ya, frighten all mudders und l

     kehaar arched his wings and rose into the air. he flew over the parapet of the
bridge and upstream. then he turned in a circle to the left, came back over the
grass track and flew straight down it, skimming just over the rabbits' heads. he
gave one of his raucous cries and was gone to the southward. they gazed after
him as he disappeared above the trees.
     "oh, fly away, great bird so white," said bigwig. "you know, he made me feel i
could fly, too. that big water! i wish i could see it."

hey continued to look in the direction where kehaar had gone, hazel
noticed for the first time a cottage at the far end of the track, where the grass
sloped up to join the road. a man, taking care to keep still, was leaning over the
hedge and watching them intently. hazel stamped and bolted into the
undergrowth of the swamp, with bigwig hard on his heels.
     "you know what he's thinking about?" said bigwig. "he's thinking about the
vegetables in his garden."
     "i know," replied hazel. "and we shan't be able to keep this lot away from

 to bigwig -- bluebell and speedwell
suggested that it might be worthwhile to dig some scrapes in the light soil under
the trees and live there for a day or two. hazel felt willing enough, but fiver
needed persuasion.
     "i know we can do with a rest, but somehow i don't altogether like it, hazel-
rah," he said. "i suppose i've got to try to think why?"
     "not on my account," answered hazel. "but i doubt you'll shift the others this
time. one or two of these does are 'ready for mudder,' as kehaar would say, and
that's the real reason why bluebell and the rest are prepared to be at the trouble
of digging scrapes. surely it'll be all right at that rate, won't it? you know what
they say -- 'rabbit underground, rabbit safe and sound.'"
     "well, you may be right," said fiver. "that vilthuril's a beautiful doe. i'd like a
chance to get to know her better. after all, it's not natural to rabbits, is it? -- on
and on day after day."
     later, however, when blackavar returned with dandelion

 last, doesn't
it?" said bigwig, as they browsed their way along the bank. "what a summer it's
been! i keep dreaming i'm back in efrafa, you know; but it'll pass off, i suppose.
one thing i brought back out of that place, though, and that's the value of keeping
a warren hidden. as we get bigger, hazel, we ought to take care of that. we'll do
better than efrafa, though. when we've reached the right size, rabbits can be
encouraged to leave."
     "well, don't you leave," said hazel, "or i'll tell kehaar to bring you back by the
scruff of the neck. i'm relying on you to produce us a really good owsla."
     "it's certainly something to look forward to," said bigwig. "take a pack of
young fellows across to the farm and chase the cats out of the barn to get an
appetite. well, it'll come. i say, this grass is as dry as horsehair on barbed wire,
isn't it? what about a run down the hill to the fields -- just you and i and fiver?

were hard with the hot weather. it was not easy to get started, and when the soil
began to fall, it was light and powdery and did little to block the holes. it was
blackberry who hit upon the idea of working outward from inside the
honeycomb itself, scratching down the ceilings of the runs where they came into
the meeting hall and blocking the holes by breaking the underground walls into
them. one run, leading up into the wood, was left open for coming and going. it
was the one where kehaar used to shelter and the lobby at the mouth was still
cluttered with guano. as hazel passed the place, it occurred to him that
woundwort did not know that kehaar had left them. he dug out as much of the
mess as he could and scattered it about. then, as the work went on below, he
squatted on the bank and watched the darkening eastern skyline.
     his thoughts were very sad. indeed, they were desperate. although he had
spoken resolutely in front of the others, he knew only too well how little hop

     when the punt floated down the river in the rain, part of general woundwort's
authority went with it. he could not have appeared more openly and completely
at a loss if hazel and his companions had flown away over the trees. until that
very moment he had shown up strongly, a most formidable adversary. his officers
had been demoralized by kehaar's unexpected attack. he had not. on the
contrary, he had kept up the pursuit in spite of kehaar and had actually carried
out a scheme to cut off the fugitives' retreat. cunning and resourceful in
adversity, he had nearly succeeded in hurting the gull when he leaped at him out
of the close cover by the plank bridge. then, when he had his quarry cornered in a
place where kehaar could not have done a great deal to help them, they had
suddenly shown their own cunning greater than his, and left him

 fear as best they could and did as he told
them, enlarging the burrows beyond the south end of the honeycomb and piling
up the soft earth in the entry runs until what had been a colonnade began to
become a solid wall. it was during a pause in this work that speedwell reported
that the digging above the north end had stopped. hazel went and crouched
beside him, listening for some time. there was nothing to be heard. he went back
to where buckthorn sat guarding the foot of the single open run -- kehaar's run,
as it was called.
     "you know what's happened?" he said. "they've realized they're all among the
beech roots up there, so they've chucked it. they'll be going harder at the other
end now."
     "i suppose so, hazel-rah," replied buckthorn. after a little he said, "d'you
remember the rats in the barn? we got out of that all right, didn't we? but i'm
afraid we shan't get out of this. it's a pity, after all we've done together."
     "yes, we shall," said hazel, with all the conviction h

     the wind blew, the trees shook their myriads of leaves. the stream was gone.
he was in the honeycomb, facing bigwig in the dark, across the motionless body
of fiver. the scratching from above was louder and closer.
     "bigwig," said hazel, "do as i say at once, there's a good fellow. we've got
hardly any time. go and get dandelion and blackberry and bring them to me at
the foot of kehaar's run, quickly."
     at the foot of the run buckthorn was still in his place. he had not moved at
fiver's cry, but his breath was short and his pulse very quick. he and the other
three rabbits gathered about hazel without a word.
     "i've got a plan," said hazel. "if it works, it'll finish woundwort for good and
all. but i've no time to explain. every moment counts now. dandelion and

lion running ahead. the only alarm
came when they startled four partridges, which whirred away over the hedge to
the west and sailed down, spread-winged, into the field beyond. soon they
reached the road and hazel halted among the quickset on top of the nearer bank.
     "now, blackberry," he said, "this is where we leave you. lie close and don't
move. when the time comes, don't break too soon. you've got the best head of
any of us. use it -- and keep it, too. when you get back, go to ground in kehaar's
run and stay there till things are safe. have you got your line clear?"
     "yes, hazel-rah," replied blackberry. "but, as far as i can see, i may have to run
from here to the iron tree without a check. there's no cover."
     "i know," said hazel. "it can't be helped. if the worst comes to the worst, you'll
have to turn for the hedge and then keep popping in and out of it. do whatever

were for hazel and bigwig. bigwig seemed
likely to die. bleeding in half a dozen places, he lay with closed eyes in the run he
had defended and made no reply when hyzenthlay told him that the efrafans
were defeated and the warren was saved. after a time, they dug carefully to
broaden the run and as the day wore on the does, each in turn, remained beside
him, licking his wounds and listening to his low, unsteady breathing.
     before this, blackberry and dandelion had burrowed their way in from
kehaar's run -- it had not been blocked very heavily -- and told their story. they
could not say what might have happened to hazel after the dog broke loose, and
by the early afternoon everyone feared the worst. at last pipkin, in great anxiety
and distress, insisted on setting out for nuthanger. fiver at once said that he
would go with him and together they left the wood and set off northward over the
down. they had gone only a short distance when fiver, sitting up on an anthill to
look about, saw a

hing out his cheeks and sniffing at the two rabbits beside him. he
said nothing and hazel wondered whether he had understood. at last he
whispered, "ees finish meester voundvort, ya?"
     "ya," replied hazel. "i've come to help you to silflay. it'll do you good and we
can clean you up a lot better outside. come on: it's a lovely afternoon, all sun and
leaves."
     bigwig got up and tottered forward into the devastated honeycomb. there he
sank down, rested, got up again and reached the foot of kehaar's run.
     "i thought he'd killed me," he said. "no more fighting for me -- i've had
enough. and you -- your plan worked, hazel-rah, did it? well done. tell me what
it was. and how did you get back from the farm?"
     "a man brought me in a hrududu," said hazel, "nearly all the way."
     "and you flew the rest, i suppose," said bigwig, "burning a white stick in your
mouth? come on, tell me sensibly. what's the matter, hyzenthlay?"
     "oh!" said hyzenthlay, staring. "oh!"
     "what is it?"

heard it's doing well under campion, even if some things
aren't quite the same as they used to be. and listen -- by next spring, if i'm right,
we shall have too many rabbits here for comfort. i'm going to encourage some of
the youngsters to start a new warren between here and efrafa; and i think you'll
find campion will be ready to send some of his rabbits to join them. you'd be just
the right fellow to start that scheme off."
     "won't it be difficult to arrange?" asked holly.
     "not when kehaar comes," said hazel, as they began to hop easily back toward
the holes at the northeast corner of the hanger. "he'll turn up one of these days,
when the storms begin on that big water of his. he can take a message to
campion as quickly as you'd run down to the iron tree and back."

silver. "someone not so very far away."

he's got them all."
     "come over to the evening side of the wood with us, hazel-rah?" said pipkin.
"we came up early on purpose to have a bit of sunshine before it gets dark."
     "all right," answered hazel good-naturedly. "we've just come back from there,
silver and i, but i don't mind slipping over again for a bit."
     "let's go out to that little hollow where we found kehaar that morning," said
silver. "it'll be out of the wind. d'you remember how he cursed at us and tried to
peck us?"
     "and the worms we carried?" said bluebell. "don't forget them."
     as they came near the hollow they could hear that it was not empty. evidently
some of the other rabbits had had the same idea.
     "let's see how close we can get before they spot us," said silver. "real campion
style -- come on."
     they approached very quietly, upwind from the north. peeping over the edge,

party was led by none other than captain avens, who acted sensibly and made a
very good job of it.
     general woundwort was never seen again. but it was certainly true, as
groundsel said, that no one ever found his body, so it may perhaps be that, after
all, that extraordinary rabbit really did wander away to live his fierce life
somewhere else and to defy the elil as resourcefully as ever. kehaar, who was
once asked if he would look out for him in his flights over the downs, merely
replied, "dat damn rabbit -- i no see 'im, i no vant i see 'im." before many months
had passed, no one on watership knew or particularly cared to know whether he
himself or his mate was descended from one or two efrafan parents or from none
at all. hazel was glad that it should be so. and yet there endured the legend that
somewhere out over the down there lived a great and solitary rabbit, a giant who
drove t
