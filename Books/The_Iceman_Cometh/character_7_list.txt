Pat McGloin - 
      Mosher's drinking partner. The fiftyish McGloin has the look of his former police days stamped all over him. His once brutal and greedy face has melted into a "good-humored, parasite's characterlessness." He dreams of disproving his conviction on graft charges and returning to the police force.
