 this is not quite the end of the story. each of these particles has an antiparticle
partner—a particle of identical mass but opposite in certain other respects such as its electric charge
(as well as its charges with respect to other forces discussed below). for instance, the antiparticle of
an electron is called a positron—it has exactly the same mass as an electron, but its electric charge is
+1  whereas  the  electric  charge  of  the  electron  is  -1.  when  in  contact,  matter  and  antimatter  can
annihilate one another to produce pure energy—that's why there is extremely little naturally occurring
antimatter in the world around us.

physicists have recognized a pattern among these particles, displayed in table 1.1. the matter
particles neatly fall into three groups, which are often called families. each family contains two of
the  quarks,  an  electron  or  one  of  its  cousins,  and  one  of  the  neutrino  species.  the  corresponding
particle types across the three families h

ave identical properties except for their mass, which grows
larger in each successive family. the upshot is that physicists have now probed the structure of matter
to scales of about a billionth of a billionth of a meter and shown that everything encountered to date
—whether it occurs naturally or is produced artificially with giant atom-smashers—consists of some
combination of particles from these three families and their antimatter partners.

a  glance  at  table  1.1  will  no  doubt  leave  you  with  an  even  stronger  sense  of  rabi's
bewilderment  at  the  discovery  of  the  muon.  the  arrangement  into  families  at  least  gives  some
semblance  of  order,  but  innumerable  "whys"  leap  to  the  fore.  why  are  there  so  many  fundamental
particles, especially when it seems that the great majority of things in the world around us need only
electrons, up-quarks, and down-quarks? why are there three families?

lsive  "borrower"  of  energy  and  momentum,  constantly
extracting "loans" from the universe and subsequently "paying" them back. but what participates in
these  exchanges  in,  for  instance,  a  quiet empty region of space? everything. literally. energy (and
momentum as well) is the ultimate convertible currency. e  = mc2 tells us that energy can be turned
into matter and vice versa. thus if an energy fluctuation is big enough it can momentarily cause, for
instance,  an  electron  and  its  antimatter  companion  the  positron  to  erupt  into  existence,  even  if  the
region was initially empty! since this energy must be quickly repaid, these particles will annihilate
one another after an instant, relinquishing the energy borrowed in their creation. and the same is true
for  all  of  the  other  forms  that  energy  and  momentum  can  take—other  particle  eruptions  and
annihilations,  wild  electromagnetic-field  oscillations,  weak  and  strong  force-field  fluctuations—

cle  quantum  field  theory  shows  that  essentially  the  same  thing  happens  when
elementary particles collide—they scatter off one another and continue on deflected trajectories—but
the details are a little different.

figure 6.5 two particles interact—they "slam together"—and cause the path of each to be deflected.

for  concreteness  and  simplicity,  imagine  that  one  of  the  two  particles  is  an  electron  and  the
other is its antiparticle, the positron. when matter and antimatter collide, they can annihilate in a flash
of pure energy, producing, for example, a photon.9 to distinguish the ensuing trajectory of the photon
from the previous trajectories of the electron and positron, we follow a traditional physics convention
and draw it with a wiggly line. the photon will typically travel for a bit and then release the energy
derived  from  the  initial  electron-positron  pair  by  producing  another  electron-positron  pair  with
trajectories as indicated on the far righ

much like its mass or
its electric charge. if an electron were not spinning, it would not be an electron.

with this background on the concept of spin, let's now turn to the role it plays in revealing the

although  early  work  focused  on  the  electron,  physicists  have  subsequently  shown  that  these
ideas about spin apply equally well to all of the matter particles that fill out the three families of
table 1.1. this is true down to the last detail: all of the matter particles (and their antimatter partners
as well) have spin equal to that of the electron. in the language of the trade, physicists say that matter
particles  all  have  "spin-1/2,"  where  the  value  1/2  is,  roughly  speaking,  a  quantum-mechanical
measure  of  how  quickly  the  particles  rotate.2  moreover,  physicists  have  shown  that  the
nongravitational force carriers—photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—also possess an intrinsic
spinning characteristic that turns out to be twice that of the matter particl
