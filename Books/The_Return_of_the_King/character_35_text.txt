 if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame.
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. and he was older, far older. ‘how much older?’ he wondered, and then he thought how odd it was that he had never thought about it before. treebeard had said something about wizards, but even then he had not thought of gandalf as one of them. what was gandalf? in what far time and place did he come into the world, and when would he leave it? and then his musings broke off, and he saw that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the other’s mind. but it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze.
‘yea,’ he said; ‘for though the stones be lost, they say, still the lords of gondor have keener sight than les

 water, and out of it the tower of orthanc rose still, tall and impregnable, and its black rock was mirrored in the pool.
for a while the travellers sat where once the old gates of isengard had stood, and there were now two tall trees like sentinels at the beginning of a green-bordered path that ran towards orthanc; and they looked in wonder at the work that had been done, but no living thing could they see far or near. but presently they heard a voice calling hoom-hom, hoom-hom; and there came treebeard striding down the path to greet them with quickbeam at his side.
‘welcome to the treegarth of orthanc!’ he said. ‘i knew that you were coming, but i was at work up the valley; there is much still to be done. but you have not been idle either away in the south and the east, i hear; and all that i hear is good, very good.’ then treebeard praised all their deeds, of which he seemed to have full knowledge; and at last he stopped and looked long at gandalf.
‘well, come now!’ he said. ‘

you have proved mightiest, and all your labours have gone well. where now would you be going? and why do you come here?’
‘to see how your work goes, my friend,’ said gandalf, ‘and to thank you for your aid in all that has been achieved.’
‘hoom, well, that is fair enough,’ said treebeard; ‘for to be sure ents have played their part. and not only in dealing with that, hoom, that accursed tree-slayer that dwelt here. for there was a great inrush of those, burárum, those evileyed - blackhanded - bowlegged - flinthearted - clawfingered - foulbellied - bloodthirsty, morimaite - sincahonda, hoom, well, since you are hasty folk and their full name is as long as years of torment, those vermin of orcs; and they came over the river and down from the north and all round the wood of lau

hey had not heard of us before; though that might be said also of better folk. and not many will remember us, for not many escaped us alive, and the river had most of those. but it was well for you, for if they had not met us, then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far, and if he had there would have been no home to return to.’
‘we know it well,’ said aragorn, ‘and never shall it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras.’
‘never is too long a word even for me,’ said treebeard. ‘not while your kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long to ents.’
‘the new age begins,’ said gandalf, ‘and in this age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you, fangorn my friend. but now come tell me: what of the task that i set you? how is saruman? is he not weary of orthanc yet? for i do not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from his windows.’
treebeard gave gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, mer

ry thought. ‘ah!’ he said. ‘i thought you would come to that. weary of orthanc? very weary at last; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice. hoom! i gave him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in your speech.’
‘then why did he stay to listen? did you go into orthanc?’ asked gandalf.
‘hoom, no, not into orthanc!’ said treebeard. ‘but he came to his window and listened, because he could not get news in any other way, and though he hated the news, he was greedy to have it; and i saw that he heard it all. but i added a great many things to the news that it was good for him to think of. he grew very weary. he always was hasty. that was his ruin.’
‘l observe, my good fangorn,’ said gandalf, ‘that with great care you say dwelt, was, grew. what about is? is he dead?’
‘no, not dead, so far as i know,’ said tre

 promised to keep him safe; for i know it. but things have changed since then. and i kept him until he was safe, safe from doing any more harm. you should know that above all i hate the caging of live things, and i will not keep even such creatures as these caged beyond great need. a snake without fangs may crawl where he will.’
‘you may be right,’ said gandalf; ‘but this snake had still one tooth left, i think. he had the poison of his voice, and i guess that he persuaded you, even you treebeard, knowing the soft spot in your heart. well, he is gone, and there is no more to be said. but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the king, to whom it belongs. though maybe he will not need it.’
‘that will be seen later,’ said aragorn. ‘but i will give to ents all this valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.’
‘it is locked,’ said treebeard. ‘i made saruman lock it and give me the keys. quickbeam has

them.’
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to aragorn two great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a ring of steel. ‘now i thank you once more,’ said aragorn, ‘and i bid you farewell. may your forest grow again in peace. when this valley is filled there is room and to spare west of the mountains, where once you walked long ago.’
treebeard’s face became sad. ‘forests may grow,’ he said. ‘woods may spread. but not ents. there are no entings.’
‘yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,’ said aragorn. ‘lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.’
but treebeard shook his head and said: ‘it is far to go. and there are too many men there in these days. but i am forgetting my manners! will you stay here and rest a while? and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through fangorn

then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the ring,’ said aragorn. ‘yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help that you promised.’
‘we will come, if our own lords allow it,’ said gimli. ‘well, farewell. my hobbits! you should come safe to your own homes now, and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril. we will send word when we may, and some of us may yet meet at times; but i fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever again.’
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed three times slowly and with great reverence to celeborn and galadriel. ‘it is long, long since we met by stock or by stone, a vanimar, vanimálion nostari!’ he said. ‘it is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. for the world is changing: i feel it in the water, i feel it in the earth, and i smell it in the air. i do not think we shall meet again.’
and celeborn said: ‘i do not know, eldest.’ but galadriel said: ‘not in

le-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. then in the willow-meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring. farewell!’
last of all merry and pippin said good-bye to the old ent, and he grew gayer as he looked at them. ‘well, my merry folk,’ he said, ‘will you drink another draught with me before you go?’
‘indeed we will,’ they said, and he took them aside into the shade of one of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set. and treebeard filled three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl. ‘take care take care!’ he said. ‘for you have already grown since i saw you last.’ and they laughed and drained their bowls.
‘well, good-bye!’ he said. ‘and don’t forget that if you hear any news of the entwives in your land, you will send word to me.’ then he waved his great hands to all the company and went off into the trees.
the travellers now rode with more speed, a

ugh rohan?’
‘ah!’ said sam. ‘and bought he said. how, i wonder? and i didn’t like the sound of what he said about the southfarthing. it’s time we got back.’
‘i’m sure it is,’ said frodo. ‘but we can’t go any quicker, if we are to see bilbo. i am going to rivendell first, whatever happens.’
‘yes, i think you had better do that,’ said gandalf. ‘but alas for saruman! i fear nothing more can be made of him. he has withered altogether. all the same, i am not sure that treebeard is right: i fancy he could do some mischief still in a small mean way.’
next day they went on into northern dunland, where no men now dwelt, though it was a green and pleasant country. september came in with golden days and silver nights, and they rode at ease until they reached the swanfleet river, and found the old ford, east of the falls where it went down suddenly into the lowlands. far to the west in a haze lay the meres and eyots through which it wound its way to the greyflood: there co
