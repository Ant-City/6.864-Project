 the old
man." he went back to them.
 harshaw saw the papal nuncio come in, saw him seated at the main table, and smiled inwardly-if
that long-eared debit, larue, had any lingering doubts about the official nature of this meeting, he would
do well to forget them!

 a man came up behind harshaw, tapped him on the shoulder. "is this where the man from mars
hangs out?"
 "yes," agreed jubal.
 "which one is he? i'm tom boone-senator boone, that is-and i've got a message for him from
supreme bishop digby."
 jubal suppressed his personal feelings and let his cortex go into emergency high speed. "i'm jubal
harshaw, senator-" he signalled mike to stand up and offer to shake hands. "-and this is mr. smith.
mike, this is senator boone."
 "how do you do, senator boone," mike said in perfect dancingschool form. he looked at
boone with interest. he had already had it straightened out for him that "senator" did not mean "old
one" as the w

on't mind the political implications of being seen seated with
the official mars delegation. we aren't trying to crowd you into an embarrassing situation."
 boone barely hesitated. "not at all! who cares what people think? matter of fact, between you
and i, the bishop is very, very interested in this young man."
 "fine. there's a vacant chair there by captain van tromp-that man there . . . but probably you
know him."
 "van tromp? sure, sure, old friends, know him well-met him at the reception." senator boone
nodded at smith, swaggered down and seated himself.
 most of those present were seated now and fewer were getting past the guards at the doors.
jubal watched one argument over seating and the longer he watched it the more it made him fidget. at
last he felt that he simply could not stand it; he could not sit still and watch this indecency go on. so he
leaned over and spoke very privately with mike, made sure that, if mike did not understand why, at least
he understood what jubal wanted him to d

ately for the welfare of this planet, your opinion did not control."
jubal turned back to douglas. "mr. secretary, this is the longest public appearance i have made in years
. . and i find that i am fatigued. could we recess these talks? while we await your decision?"

 the meeting adjourned. jubal found his intention of getting his flock out of the palace
balked by the presence of the american president and of senator boone; both wanted to chat with
mike, both were practical politicians who realized fully the freshly enhanced value of being seen on
intimate terms with the man from mars-and both were well aware that the eyes of the world, via
stereovision, were still on them.
 and other hungry politicos were closing in.
 jubal said quickly, "mr. president, senator-we're leaving at once to have lunch. can you join
us?" he reflected that two in private would be easier to handle than two dozen in public-and he had to

 and quite martian. he had
discovered, too, that the cat's name (friedrich wilhelm nietzsche) was not the cat's name at all, but he
had not told anyone this because he could not pronounce the cat's real name; he could only hear it in his
head.
 the cat did not smell like dorcas.
 giving presents was a great goodness and the buying thereof taught mike much about the true
value of money. but he had not forgotten even momentarily that there were other things he was eager to
grok. jubal had put off senator boone's invitation to mike twice without mentioning it to mike and mike
had not noticed, since his quite different grasp of time made "next sunday" no particular date.

 but the next repetition of the invitation came by mall and was addressed to mike; senator boone
was under pressure from supreme bishop digby to produce the man from mars and boone had sensed
that harshaw was stalling him and might stall indefinitely.

long waiting he grokked and cherished himself.
 mike remained in his trance; there was still much to grok, loose ends and bits and pieces to be
puzzled over and fitted into his growing pattern- all that he had seen and heard and been at the archangel
foster tabernacle (not just the cusp he had encountered when he and digby had come face to face
alone), why bishop senator boone had made him warily uneasy without frightening him, why miss dawn
ardent had tasted like a water brother when she was not, the texture and smell of the goodness he had
incompletely grokked in the jumping up and down and the wailing- jubal's stored conversation both
coming and going-jubal's words troubled him more than other details; he studied them with great care,
compared them with what he bad been taught as a nestling, making great effort to bridge between his two
languages, the one he thoug
