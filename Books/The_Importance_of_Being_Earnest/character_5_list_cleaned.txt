miss[CHARACTER] - 
                cecily's
governess. miss[CHARACTER] is an endless source of pedantic bromides
and cliches. she highly approves of jack's presumed respectability
and harshly criticizes his "unfortunate" brother. puritan though
she is, miss[CHARACTER]'s severe pronouncements have a way of going so far
over the top that they inspire laughter. despite her rigidity, miss
prism seems to have a softer side. she speaks of having once written
a novel whose manuscript was "lost" or "abandoned." also, she entertains
romantic feelings for dr. chasuble.
