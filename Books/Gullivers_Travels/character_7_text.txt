n such a manner, that i do
hardly know my own work.  when i formerly hinted to you something of this
in a letter, you were pleased to answer that you were afraid of giving
offence; that people in power were very watchful over the press, and apt
not only to interpret, but to punish every thing which looked like an
_innuendo_ (as i think you call it).  but, pray how could that which i
spoke so many years ago, and at about five thousand leagues distance, in
another reign, be applied to any of the _yahoos_, who now are said to
govern the herd; especially at a time when i little thought, or feared,
the unhappiness of living under them?  have not i the most reason to
complain, when i see these very _yahoos_ carried by _houyhnhnms_ in a
vehicle, as if they were brutes, and those the rational creatures?  and
indeed to avoid so monstrous and detestable a sight was one principal
motive of my retirement hither.

thus much i thought proper to tell you in relation to yourself, and to
the trust i reposed

in you.

i do, in the next place, complain of my own great want of judgment, in
being prevailed upon by the entreaties and false reasoning of you and
some others, very much against my own opinion, to suffer my travels to be
published.  pray bring to your mind how often i desired you to consider,
when you insisted on the motive of public good, that the _yahoos_ were a
species of animals utterly incapable of amendment by precept or example:
and so it has proved; for, instead of seeing a full stop put to all
abuses and corruptions, at least in this little island, as i had reason
to expect; behold, after above six months warning, i cannot learn that my
book has produced one single effect according to my intentions.  i
desired you would let me know, by a letter, when party and faction were
extinguished; judges learned and upright; pleaders honest and mod

with some tincture of common sense, and smithfield blazing with pyramids
of law books; the young nobility‚Äôs education entirely changed; the
physicians banished; the female _yahoos_ abounding in virtue, honour,
truth, and good sense; courts and levees of great ministers thoroughly
weeded and swept; wit, merit, and learning rewarded; all disgracers of
the press in prose and verse condemned to eat nothing but their own
cotton, and quench their thirst with their own ink.  these, and a
thousand other reformations, i firmly counted upon by your encouragement;
as indeed they were plainly deducible from the precepts delivered in my
book.  and it must be owned, that seven months

were a sufficient time to
correct every vice and folly to which _yahoos_ are subject, if their
natures had been capable of the least disposition to virtue or wisdom.
yet, so far have you been from answering my expectation in any of your
letters; that on the contrary you are loading our carrier every week with
libels, and keys, and reflections, and memoirs, and second parts; wherein
i see myself accused of reflecting upon great state folk; of degrading
human nature (for so they have still the confidence to style it), and of
abusing the female sex.  i find likewise t

corrections, which you may insert, if ever there should be a second

my judicious and candid readers to adjust it as they please.

i hear some of our sea _yahoos_ find fault with my sea-language, as not
proper in many parts, nor now in use.  i cannot help it.  in my first
voyages, while i was young, i was instructed by the oldest mariners, and
learned to speak as they did.  but i have since found that the sea
_yahoos_ are apt, like the land ones, to become new-fangled in their
words, which the latter change every year; insomuch, as i remember upon
each return to my own country their old dialect was so altered, that i
could hardly understand the new.  an

if the censure of the _yahoos_ could any way affect me, i should have
great reason to complain, that some of them are so bold as to think my
book of travels a mere fiction out of mine own brain, and have gone so
far as to drop hints, that the _houyhnhnms_ and _yahoos_ have no more
existence than the inhabitants of utopia.

indeed i must confess, that as to the people of _lilliput_, _brobdingrag_
(for so the word should have been spelt, and not erroneously
_brobdingnag_), and _laputa_, i have never yet heard of any _yahoo_ so
presumptuous as to dispute their being, or the facts i have related
concerning them; because the truth immediately strikes every reader with
conviction.  and is there less probability in my account of the

confine him a long time to his cabin, and set him on shore in an unknown
land.  he travels up into the country.  the yahoos, a strange sort of
animal, described.  the author meets two houyhnhnms.

i continued at home with my wife and children about five months, in a
very happy condition, if i could have learned the lesson of knowing when
i was well.  i left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an
advantageous offer made me to be captain of the adventurer, a stout
merchantman of 350 tons: for i understood navigation well, and being
grown weary of a surgeon‚Äôs employment at sea, which, however, i could

described.

the great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see
the rest of my body so very different from that of a _yahoo_, for which i
was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception.  the sorrel
nag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, as we shall
describe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; i took it in
my hand, and, having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as i
could.  he brought out of the _yahoos_‚Äô kennel a piece of ass‚Äôs flesh;
but it smelt so offensively that i turned from it with loathing: he then
threw it to the _yahoo_, by whom it was greedily devoured.  he afterwards
showed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but i shook my head,
to signify that neither of these were food for me.  and indeed i now
apprehended that i must absolutely starve, if i did not get to some of my
own species; for as to those filthy _yahoos_, although there were few
greater lovers of mankind at

s engaged, i observed a cow passing by, whereupon i pointed to
her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her.  this had its effect; for
he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a room,
where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after a
very orderly and cleanly manner.  she gave me a large bowlful, of which i
drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.

about noon, i saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a
sledge by four _yahoos_.  there was in it an old steed, who seemed to be
of quality; he alighted with his hind-feet forward, having by accident
got a hurt in his left fore-foot.  he came to dine with our horse, who
received him with great civility.  they dined in the best room, and had
oats boiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm,
but the rest cold.  their mangers were placed circular in the middle of
the room, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on
their haunches, upo

gh to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other
travellers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned
whether we fare well or ill.  however, it was necessary to mention this
matter, lest the world should think it impossible that i could find
sustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.

when it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to
lodge in; it was but six yards from the house and separated from the
stable of the _yahoos_.  here i got some straw, and covering myself with
my own clothes, slept very sound.  but i was in a short time better
accommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when i come to treat
more particularly about my way of living.

with the translations.  this last, after some time, i ventured to
do in my master‚Äôs presence.  it cost me much trouble to explain to him
what i was doing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or
literature.

in about ten weeks time, i was able to understand most of his questions;
and in three months, could give him some tolerable answers.  he was
extremely curious to know ‚Äúfrom what part of the country i came, and how
i was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the _yahoos_ (whom
he saw i exactly resembled in my head, hands, and face, that were only
visible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition
to mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes.‚Äù  i
answered, ‚Äúthat i came over the sea, from a far place, with many others
of my own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees:
that my companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to
shift for myself.‚Äù  it was with some difficulty, and by
 
 ___________________________
 
 the help of many
signs, that i brought him to understand me.  he replied, ‚Äúthat i must
needs be mistaken, or that i said the thing which was not;‚Äù for they have
no word in their language to express lying or falsehood.  ‚Äúhe knew it was
impossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel
of brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water.  he
was sure no _houyhnhnm_ alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust
_yahoos_ to manage it.‚Äù

the word _houyhnhnm_, in their tongue, signifies a _horse_, and, in its
etymology, the _perfection of nature_.  i told my master, ‚Äúthat i was at
a loss for expression, but would improve as fast as i could; and hoped,
in a short time, i should be able to tell him wonders.‚Äù  he was pleased
to direct his own mare, his colt, and foal, and the servants of the
family, to take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for
two or three hours, he was at the same pains hi

hat he had seen.  this i presently discovered, for,
going as soon as i was dressed to pay my attendance upon his honour, he
asked me ‚Äúthe meaning of what his servant had reported, that i was not
the same thing when i slept, as i appeared to be at other times; that his
vale assured him, some part of me was white, some yellow, at least not so
white, and some brown.‚Äù

i had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish
myself, as much as possible, from that cursed race of _yahoos_; but now i
found it in vain to do so any longer.  besides, i considered that my
clothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining
condition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of
_yahoos_, or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known.  i
therefore told my master, ‚Äúthat in the country whence i came, those of my
kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals
prepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemen

ttempted to tell
him, with about fifty more of my own species; that we travelled upon the
seas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honour‚Äôs
house.  i described the ship to him in the best terms i could, and
explained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven
forward by the wind.  that upon a quarrel among us, i was set on shore on
this coast, where i walked forward, without knowing whither, till he
delivered me from the persecution of those execrable _yahoos_.‚Äù  he asked
me, ‚Äúwho made the ship, and how it was possible that the _houyhnhnms_ of
my country would leave it to the management of brutes?‚Äù  my answer was,
‚Äúthat i durst proceed no further in my relation, unless he would give me
his word and honour that he would not be offended, and then i would tell
him the wonders i had so often promised.‚Äù  he agreed; and i went on by
assuring him, that the ship was made by creatures like myself; who, in
all the countries i had travelled, as well

said the thing which was not, these ends were
defeated, because i cannot properly be said to understand him; and i am
so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in
ignorance; for i am led to believe a thing black, when it is white, and
short, when it is long.‚Äù  and these were all the notions he had
concerning that faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood, and so
universally practised, among human creatures.

to return from this digression.  when i asserted that the _yahoos_ were
the only governing animals in my country, which my master said was
altogether past his conception, he desired to know, ‚Äúwhether we had
_houyhnhnms_ among us, and what was their employment?‚Äù  i told him, ‚Äúwe
had great numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in
winter were kept in houses with hay and oats, where _yahoo_ servants were
employed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,
serve them with food, and make their beds.‚Äù  ‚Äúi understand you 
 
 ___________________________
 
well,‚Äù
said my master: ‚Äúit is now very plain, from all you have spoken, that
whatever share of reason the _yahoos_ pretend to, the _houyhnhnms_ are
your masters; i heartily wish our _yahoos_ would be so tractable.‚Äù  i
begged ‚Äúhis honour would please to excuse me from proceeding any further,
because i was very certain that the account he expected from me would be
highly displeasing.‚Äù  but he insisted in commanding me to let him know
the best and the worst.  i told him ‚Äúhe should be obeyed.‚Äù  i owned ‚Äúthat
the _houyhnhnms_ among us, whom we called horses, were the most generous
and comely animals we had; that they excelled in strength and swiftness;
and when they belonge

oved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they
were severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks;
that the males, designed for the common use of riding or draught, were
generally castrated about two years after their birth, to take down their
spirits, and make them more tame and gentle; that they were indeed
sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honour would please to
consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason, any more than
the _yahoos_ in this country.‚Äù

it put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right
idea of what i spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of
words, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us.  but it
is impossible to express his noble resentment at our savage treatment of
the _houyhnhnm_ race; particularly after i had explained the manner and
use of castrating horses among us, to hinder them from propagating their
kind, and to render them more servile.  h

e said, ‚Äúif it were possible
there could be any country where _yahoos_ alone were endued with reason,
they certainly must be the governing animal; because reason in time will
always prevail against brutal strength.  but, considering the frame of
our bodies, and especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk
was so ill-contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of
life;‚Äù whereupon he desired to know ‚Äúwhether those among whom i lived
resembled me, or the _yahoos_ of his country?‚Äù  i assured him, ‚Äúthat i
was as well shaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females,
were much more soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as
white as milk.‚Äù  he said, ‚Äúi differed indeed from other _yahoos_, being
much more cleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real
advantage, he thought i differed for the worse: that my nails were of no
use either to my fore or hinder feet; as to my fore feet, he could not
properly call t

ore nature had placed those joints
to answer that necessity.  he knew not what could be the use of those
several clefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft
to bear the hardness and sharpness of stones, without a covering made
from the skin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence
against heat and cold, which i was forced to put on and off every day,
with tediousness and trouble: and lastly, that he observed every animal
in this country naturally to abhor the _yahoos_, whom the weaker avoided,
and the stronger drove from them.  so that, supposing us to have the gift
of reason, he could not see how it were possible to cure that natural
antipathy, which every creature discovered against us; nor consequently
how we could tame and render them serviceable.  however, he would,‚Äù as he
said, ‚Äúdebate the matter no farther, because he was more desirous to know
my own story, the country where i was born, and the several actions and
events of my life, before i came

ch was remote from his country, as many days‚Äô journey as the strongest
of his honour‚Äôs servants could travel in the annual course of the sun;
that i was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in
the body, gotten by accident or violence; that my country was governed by
a female man, whom we called queen; that i left it to get riches, whereby
i might maintain myself and family, when i should return; that, in my
last voyage, i was commander of the ship, and had about fifty _yahoos_
under me, many of which died at sea, and i was forced to supply them by
others picked out from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger
of being sunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by
striking against a rock.‚Äù  here my master interposed, by asking me, ‚Äúhow
i could persuade strangers, out of different countries, to venture with
me, after the losses i had sustained, and the hazards i had run?‚Äù  i
said, ‚Äúthey were fellows of desperate fortunes, forced to fly fr

in obedience, therefore, to his honour‚Äôs commands, i related to him the
revolution under the prince of orange; the long war with france, entered
into by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the present queen,
wherein the greatest powers of christendom were engaged, and which still
continued: i computed, at his request, ‚Äúthat about a million of _yahoos_
might have been killed in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred
or more cities taken, and five times as many ships burnt or sunk.‚Äù

he asked me, ‚Äúwhat were the usual causes or motives that made one country
go to war with another?‚Äù  i answered ‚Äúthey were innumerable; but i should
only mention a few of the chief.  sometimes the ambition of princes, who
never think they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes the
corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war,
 
 ___________________________
 
úwhat you have told me,‚Äù said my master, ‚Äúupon the subject of war, does
indeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend to:
however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and that
nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief.  for, your
mouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other to any
purpose, unless by consent.  then as to the claws upon your feet before
and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our _yahoos_ would
drive a dozen of yours before him.  and therefore, in recounting the
numbers of those who have been killed in battle, i cannot but think you
have said the thing which is not.‚Äù

i could not forbear shaking my head, and smiling a little at his
ignorance.  and being no stranger to the art of war, i gave him a
description of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets,
powder, swords, bayonets, battles, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines,
countermines, bombardments, sea fig

dogs and wolves and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing,
burning, and destroying.  and to set forth the valour of my own dear
countrymen, i assured him, ‚Äúthat i had seen them blow up a hundred
enemies at once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead
bodies drop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the
spectators.‚Äù

i was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.
he said, ‚Äúwhoever understood the nature of _yahoos_, might easily believe
it possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action i had
named, if their strength and cunning equalled their malice.  but as my
discourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he found
it gave him a disturbance in his mind to which he was wholly a stranger
before.  he thought his ears, being used to such abominable words, might,
by degrees, admit them with less detestation: that although he hated the
_yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more bl

saying,
they did it for hire.  whereupon i was at much pains to describe to him
the use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the
metals; ‚Äúthat when a _yahoo_ had got a great store of this precious
substance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to; the finest
clothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats
and drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful females.  therefore
since money alone was able to perform all these feats, our _yahoos_
thought they could never have enough of it to spend, or to save, as they
found themselves inclined, from their natural bent either to profusion or
avarice; that the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man‚Äôs labour,
and the latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former; that
the bulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by labouring every
day for small wages, to make a few live plentifully.‚Äù

i enlarged myself much on these, and many other particulars to the same
purp

re he desired i would let him know, ‚Äúwhat these costly
meats were, and how any of us happened to want them?‚Äù  whereupon i
enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with the various methods
of dressing them, which could not be done without sending vessels by sea
to every part of the world, as well for liquors to drink as for sauces
and innumerable other conveniences.  i assured him ‚Äúthat this whole globe
of earth must be at least three times gone round before one of our better
female _yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a cup to put it in.‚Äù  he said
‚Äúthat must needs be a miserable country which cannot furnish food for its
own inhabitants.  but what he chiefly wondered at was, how such vast
tracts of ground as i described should be wholly without fresh water, and
the people put to the necessity of sending over the sea for drink.‚Äù  i
replied ‚Äúthat england (the dear place of my nativity) was computed to
produce three times the quantity of food more than its inhabitants are

 to perfection, should suffer any pains to
breed in our bodies, he thought impossible, and desired to know the
reason of so unaccountable an evil.‚Äù

i told him ‚Äúwe fed on a thousand things which operated contrary to each
other; that we ate when we were not hungry, and drank without the
provocation of thirst; that we sat whole nights drinking strong liquors,
without eating a bit, which disposed us to sloth, inflamed our bodies,
and precipitated or prevented digestion; that prostitute female _yahoos_
acquired a certain malady, which bred rottenness in the bones of those
who fell into their embraces; that this, and many other diseases, were
propagated from father to son; so that great numbers came into the world
with complicated maladies upon them; that it would be endless to give him
a catalogue of all diseases incident to human bodies, for they would not
be fewer than five or six hundred, spread over every limb and joint‚Äîin
short, every part, external and intestine, having diseases appr

‚Äúbut, besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only
imaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures; these
have their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper for them;
and with these our female _yahoos_ are always infested.

‚Äúone great excellency in this tribe, is their skill at prognostics,
wherein they seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they
rise to any degree of malignity, generally portending death, which is
always in their power, when recovery is not: and therefore, upon any
unexpected signs of amendment, after they have pronounced their sentence,
rather than be accused as false prophets, they know how to approve their
sagacity to the world, by a seasonable dose.

one day, in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility of
my country, was pleased to make me a compliment which i could not pretend
to deserve: ‚Äúthat he was sure i must have been born of some noble family,
because i far exceeded in shape, colour, and cleanliness, all the
_yahoos_ of his nation, although i seemed to fail in strength and
agility, which must be imputed to my different way of living from those
other brutes; and besides i was not only endowed with the faculty of
speech, but likewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree that,
with all his acquaintance, i passed for a prodigy.‚Äù

he made me observe, ‚Äúthat among the _houyhnhnms_, the white, the sorrel,
and the iron-gray, were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the

the reader may be disposed to wonder how i could prevail on myself to
give so free a representation of my own species, among a race of mortals
who are already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of humankind, from
that entire congruity between me and their _yahoos_.  but i must freely
confess, that the many virtues of those excellent quadrupeds, placed in
opposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes and
enlarged my understanding, that i began to view the actions and passions
of man in a very different light, and to think the honour of my own kind
not worth managing; which, besides, it was impossible for me to do,
before a person of so acute a judgment as my master, who daily convinced
me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof i had not

emed to spend
our whole lives in vain endeavours to supply them by our own inventions;
that, as to myself, it was manifest i had neither the strength nor
agility of a common _yahoo_; that i walked infirmly on my hinder feet;
had found out a contrivance to make my claws of no use or defence, and to
remove the hair from my chin, which was intended as a shelter from the
sun and the weather: lastly, that i could neither run with speed, nor
climb trees like my brethren,‚Äù as he called them, ‚Äúthe _yahoos_ in his
country.

‚Äúthat our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our
gross defects in reason, and by consequence in virtue; because reason
alone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was, therefore,
a character we had no pretence to challenge, even from the account i had
given of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that, in order
to favour them, i had concealed many particulars, and often said the
thing which was not.

‚Äúhe was the more confirmed

 in this opinion, because, he observed, that as
i agreed in every feature of my body with other _yahoos_, except where it
was to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity,
the shortness of my claws, and some other particulars where nature had no
part; so from the representation i had given him of our lives, our
manners, and our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the
disposition of our minds.‚Äù  he said, ‚Äúthe _yahoos_ were known to hate one
another, more than they did any different species of animals; and the
reason usually assigned was, the odiousness of their own shapes, which
all could see in the rest, but not in themselves.  he had therefore begun
to think it not unwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention
conceal many of our deformities from each other, which would else be
hardly supportable.  but he now found he had been mistaken, and that the
dissensions of those brutes in his country wer

e owing to the same cause
with ours, as i had described them.  for if,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúyou throw among
five _yahoos_ as much food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will,
instead of eating peaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one
impatient to have all to itself; and therefore a servant was usually
employed to stand by while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at
home were tied at a distance from each other: that if a cow died of age
or accident, before a _houyhnhnm_ could secure it for his own _yahoos_,
those in the neighbourhood would come in herds to seize it, and then
would ensue suc

h a battle as i had described, with terrible wounds made
by their claws on both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one
another, for want of such convenient instruments of death as we had
invented.  at other times, the like battles have been fought between the
_yahoos_ of several neighbourhoods, without any visible cause; those of
one district watching all opportunities to surprise the next, before they
are prepared.  but if they find their project has miscarried, they return
home, and, for want of enemies, engage in what i call a civil war among
themselves.

‚Äúthat in some fields of his country there are certain shining stones of
several colours, whereof the _yahoos_ are violently fond: and when part
of these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes h

with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their
treasure.‚Äù  my master said, ‚Äúhe could never discover the reason of this
unnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _yahoo_;
but now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice
which i had ascribed to mankind.  that he had once, by way of experiment,
privately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of his
_yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his
treasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place,
there miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest, began
to pine away, would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a
servant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them
as before; which, when his _yahoo_ had found, he presently recovered his
spirits and good humour, but took good care to remove them to a better
hiding place

, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.‚Äù

my master further assured me, which i also observed myself, ‚Äúthat in the
fields where the shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent
battles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighbouring
_yahoos_.‚Äù

he said, ‚Äúit was common, when two _yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a
field, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a
third would take the advantage, and carry it away from them both;‚Äù which
my master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our
suits at law; wherein i thought it for our credit not to undeceive him;
since the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees
among us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside
the stone they contended for: where
 
 ___________________________
 
as our courts of equity would never
have dismissed the cause, while either of them had any thing left.

my master, continuing his discourse, said, ‚Äúthere was nothing that
rendered the _yahoos_ more odious, than their undistinguishing appetite
to devour every thing that came in their way, whether herbs, roots,
berries, the corrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together: and it
was peculiar in their temper, that they were fonder of what they could
get by rapine or stealth, at a greater distance, than much better food
provided for them at home.  if their prey held out, they would eat till
they were ready to burst; after which, nature had pointed out to them a
certain root that gav

e them a general evacuation.

‚Äúthere was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and
difficult to be found, which the _yahoos_ sought for with much eagerness,
and would suck it with great delight; it produced in them the same
effects that wine has upon us.  it would make them sometimes hug, and
sometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and
reel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.‚Äù

i did indeed observe that the _yahoos_ were the only animals in this
country subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than
horses have among us, and contracted, not by any ill-treatment they meet
with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.  neither
has their language any more than a general appellation for those
maladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called
_hnea-yahoo_, or _yahoo‚Äôs evil_; and the cure prescribed is a mixture of
their own dung and urine, forcibly put down t

he _yahoo‚Äôs_ throat.  this i
have since often known to have been taken with success, and do here
freely recommend it to my countrymen for the public good, as an admirable
specific against all diseases produced by repletion.

‚Äúas to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like,‚Äù my master
confessed, ‚Äúhe could find little or no resemblance between the _yahoos_
of that country and those in ours; for he only meant to observe what
parity there was in our natures.  he had heard, indeed, some curious
_houyhnhnms_ observe, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling
_yahoo_ (as among us there is generally some leading or principal stag in
a park), who was always more deformed in body, and mischievous in
disposition, than any of the rest; that this leader had usually a
favourite as like himself as he could get, whose employment was to lick
his master‚Äôs
 
 ___________________________
 
 feet and posteriors, and drive the female _yahoos_ to his
kennel; for which he was now and then rewarded with a piece of ass‚Äôs
flesh.  this favourite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to
protect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader.  he usually
continues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he is
discarded, his successor, at the head of all the _yahoos_ in that
district, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and discharge
their excrements upon him from head to foot.  but how far this might be
applicable to our courts, and favourites, and ministers of state, my
master said i could best determine.‚Äù

i durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased human
understanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has judgment
enough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack,
without being ever mis

taken.

my master told me, ‚Äúthere were some qualities remarkable in the _yahoos_,
which he had not observed me to mention, or at least very slightly, in
the accounts i had given of humankind.‚Äù  he said, ‚Äúthose animals, like
other brutes, had their females in common; but in this they differed,
that the she _yahoo_ would admit the males while she was pregnant; and
that the hes would quarrel and fight with the females, as fiercely as
with each other; both which practices were such degrees of infamous
brutality, as no other sensitive creature ever arrived at.

‚Äúanother t

hing he wondered at in the _yahoos_, was their strange
disposition to nastiness and dirt; whereas there appears to be a natural
love of cleanliness in all other animals.‚Äù  as to the two former
accusations, i was glad to let them pass without any reply, because i had
not a word to offer upon them in defence of my species, which otherwise i
certainly had done from my own inclinations.  but i could have easily
vindicated humankind from the imputation of singularity upon the last
article, if there had been any swine in that countr

y (as unluckily for me
there were not), which, although it may be a sweeter quadruped than a
_yahoo_, cannot, i humbly conceive, in justice, pretend to more
cleanliness; and so his honour himself must have owned, if he had seen
their filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing and sleeping
in the mud.

my master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had
discovered in several yahoos, and to him was wholly unaccountable.  he
said, ‚Äúa fancy would sometimes take a _yahoo_ to retire into a corner, to
lie down, and howl, and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,
although he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water, nor did
the servant imagine what could possibly ail him.  and the only remedy
they found was, to set him to hard work, after which he would infallibly
come to himself.‚Äù  to this i was silent out of partiality to my own kind;
yet here i could plai

r, and grin, and
smell her all over; and then turn off with gestures, that seemed to
express contempt and disdain.‚Äù

perhaps my master might refine a little in these speculations, which he
had drawn from what he observed himself, or had been told him by others;
however, i could not reflect without some amazement, and much sorrow,
that the rudiments of lewdness, coquetry, censure, and scandal, should
have place by instinct in womankind.

i expected every moment that my master would accuse the _yahoos_ of those
unnatural appetites in both sexes, so common among us.  but nature, it
seems, has not been so expert a school-mistress; and these politer
pleasures are entirely the productions of art and reason on our side of
the globe.

or my master to do, so it was easy to apply the character he
gave of the _yahoos_ to myself and my countrymen; and i believed i could
yet make further discoveries, from my own observation.  i therefore often
begged his honour to let me go among the herds of _yahoos_ in the
neighbourhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being
perfectly convinced that the hatred i bore these brutes would never
suffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honour ordered one of his
servants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my
guard; without whose protection i durst not undertake such adventures.

weasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.  i forgot another
circumstance (and perhaps i might have the reader‚Äôs pardon if it were
wholly omitted), that while i held the odious vermin in my hands, it
voided its filthy excrements of a yellow liquid substance all over my
clothes; but by good fortune there was a small brook hard by, where i
washed myself as clean as i could; although i durst not come into my
master‚Äôs presence until i were sufficiently aired.

by what i could discover, the _yahoos_ appear to be the most unteachable
of all animals: their capacity never reaching higher than to draw or
carry burdens.  yet i am of opinion, this defect arises chiefly from a
perverse, restive disposition; for they are cunning, malicious,
treacherous, and revengeful.  they are strong and hardy, but of a
cowardly spirit, and, by consequence, insolent, abject, and cruel.  it is
observed, that the red haired of both sexes are more libidinous and
mischievous than the rest, whom yet they much exceed

 in strength and
activity.

the _houyhnhnms_ keep the _yahoos_ for present use in huts not far from
the house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they dig
up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion, or
sometimes catch weasels and _luhimuhs_ (a sort of wild rat), which they
greedily devour.  nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their
nails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves;
only the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or
three cubs.

they swim from their

hardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills,
and over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat, they are
ordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river.  four times a
year the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in
running and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility; where the
victor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise.  on this festival,
the servants drive a herd of _yahoos_ into the field, laden with hay, and
oats, and milk, for a repast to the _houyhnhnms_; after which, these
brutes are immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome to
the assembly.

every fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative
council of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles
from our house, and continues about five or six days.  here they inquire
into the state and condition of the several districts; whether they
abound or be deficient in h

ay or oats, or cows, or _yahoos_; and wherever
there is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately supplied by
unanimous consent and contribution.  here likewise the regulation of
children is settled: as for instance, if a _houyhnhnm_ has two males, he
changes one of them with another that has two females; and when a child
has been lost by any casualty, where the mother is past breeding, it is
determined what family in the district shall breed another to supply the
loss.

a grand debate at the general as

their manner of burials.  the defectiveness of their language.

one of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months
before my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our
district.  in this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the
only debate that ever happened in their country; whereof my master, after
his return, give me a very particular account.

the question to be debated was, ‚Äúwhether the _yahoos_ should be
exterminated from the face of the earth?‚Äù  one of the members for the
affirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,
alleging, ‚Äúthat as the _yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and
deformed animals which nature ever produced, so they were the most
restive and indocible, mischievous and malicious; they would privately
suck the teats of the _houyhnhnms‚Äô_ cows, kill and devour their cats,
trample down their oats and grass, if they were not continually watch

ed,
and commit a thousand other extravagancies.‚Äù  he took notice of a general
tradition, ‚Äúthat _yahoos_ had not been always in their country; but that
many ages ago, two of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain;
whether produced by the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or
from the ooze and froth of the sea, was never known; that these _yahoos_
engendered, and their brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to
overrun and infest the whole nation; that the _houyhnhnms_, to get rid of
this evil, made a general hunting, and at last enclosed the whole herd;
and destroying the elder, every _houyhnhnm_ kept two young ones in a
kennel, and brought them to such a degree of tameness, as an animal, so
savage by nature, can be capable of acquiring, using them for draught and
carriage; that there seemed to be much truth in this tradition, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
that
those creatures could not be _yinhniamshy_ (or _aborigines_ of the land),
because of the violent hatred the _houyhnhnms_, as well as all other
animals, bore them, which, although their evil disposition sufficiently
deserved, could never have arrived at so high a degree if they had been
_aborigines_, or else they would have long since been rooted out; that
the inhabitants, taking a fancy to use the service of the _yahoos_, had,
very imprudently, neglected to cultivate the breed of asses, which are a
comely animal, easily kept, more tame and orderly, without any offensive
smell, strong enough for labour, although they yield to the other in
agility of body, and if their braying be no agreeable sound, it is far
preferable to the horrible howlings of the _yahoos_.‚Äù

several others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my
master proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed
borrowed th

e hint from me.  ‚Äúhe approved of the tradition mentioned by
the honourable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two
_yahoos_ said to be seen first among them, had been driven thither over
the sea; that coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions,
they retired to the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in
process of time much more savage than those of their own species in the
country whence these two originals came.  the reason of this assertion
was, that he had now in his possession a certain wonderful _yahoo_
(meaning myself) which most of them had heard of, and many of them had
seen.  he then

to them how he first found me; that my body was
all covered with an artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other
animals; that i spoke in a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned
theirs; that i had related to him the accidents which brought me thither;
that when he saw me without my covering, i was an exact _yahoo_ in every
part, only of a whiter colour, less hairy, and with shorter claws.  he
added, how i had endeavoured to persuade him, that in my own and other
countries, the _yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held
the _houyhnhnms_ in servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities
of a _yahoo_, only a little more civilized by some tincture of reason,
which, however, was in a degree as far inferior to the _houyhnhnm_ race,
as the _yahoos_ of their country were to me; that, among other things, i
mentioned a custom we had of castrating _houyhnhnms_ when they were
young, in order to render them tame; that the operation was easy and
safe; that it was no s

hame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is
taught by the ant, and building by the swallow (for so i translate the
word _lyhannh_, although it be a much larger fowl); that this invention
might be practised upon the younger _yahoos_ here, which besides
rendering them tractable and fitter for use, would in an age put an end
to the whole species, without destroying life; that in the mean time the
_houyhnhnms_ should be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which,
as they are in all respects more valuable brutes, so they have this
advantage, to be fit for service at five years old, which the others are
not till twelve.‚Äù

this was all my master thought fit to tell me, at that time, of what
passed in the grand council.

magine.  i have seen a white mare of our family thread
a needle (which i lent her on purpose) with that joint.  they milk their
cows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the
same manner.  they have a kind of hard flints, which, by grinding against
other stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,
axes, and hammers.  with tools made of these flints, they likewise cut
their hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several
fields; the _yahoos_ draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants
tread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in
stores.  they make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake
the former in the sun.

if they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried in
the obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations
expressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying
person discover the least regret that he is leaving the world,

 generally to seventy, or seventy-five years, very seldom to
fourscore.  some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay; but
without pain.  during this time they are much visited by their friends,
because they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.
however, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in
computing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who
are nearest in the neighbourhood, being carried in a convenient sledge
drawn by _yahoos_; which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion,
but when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by any
accident: and therefore when the dying _houyhnhnms_ return those visits,
they take a solemn leave of their friends, as if they were going to some
remote part of the country, where they designed to pass the rest of their
lives.

i know not whether it may be worth observing, that the _houyhnhnms_ have
no word in their language to express any thing that is evil, except w

they denote the folly of a servant, an omission of a child, a stone that
cuts their feet, a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather, and the
like, by adding to each the epithet of _yahoo_.  for instance, _hhnm
yahoo_; _whnaholm yahoo_, _ynlhmndwihlma yahoo_, and an ill-contrived
house _ynholmhnmrohlnw yahoo_.

virtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to

i had settled my little economy to my own heart‚Äôs content.  my master had
ordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards
from the house: the sides and floors of which i plastered with clay, and
covered with rush-mats of my own contriving.  i had beaten hemp, which
there grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this i filled with
the feathers of several birds i had taken with springes made of _yahoos‚Äô_
hairs, and were excellent food.  i had worked two chairs with my knife,
the sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part.  when
my clothes were worn to rags, i made myself others with the skins of
rabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called
_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down.  of these i
also made very tolerable stockings.  i soled my shoes with wood, which i
cut from a tree, and fitted to the upper-leather; and when this was

out, i supplied it with the skins of _yahoos_ dried in the sun.  i often
got honey out of hollow trees, which i mingled with water, or ate with my
bread.  no man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, ‚Äúthat
nature is very easily satisfied;‚Äù and, ‚Äúthat necessity is the mother of
invention.‚Äù  i enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind;
i did not feel the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries
of a secret or open enemy.  i had no occasion of bribing, flattering, or
pimping, to procure the fav

various excellences of poetry.  i may add, without vanity, that my
presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse, because it
afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into the history of
me and my country, upon which they were all pleased to descant, in a
manner not very advantageous to humankind: and for that reason i shall
not repeat what they said; only i may be allowed to observe, that his
honour, to my great admiration, appeared to understand the nature of
_yahoos_ much better than myself.  he went through all our vices and
follies, and discovered many, which i had never mentioned to him, by only
supposing what qualities a _yahoo_ of their country, with a small
proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded, with
too much probability, ‚Äúhow vile, as well as miserable, such a creature
must be.‚Äù

i freely confess, that all the little knowledge i have of any value, was
acquired by the lectures i received from my master, and from hearin
 
 ___________________________
 
g the
discourses of him and his friends; to which i should be prouder to
listen, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in europe.  i
admired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such
a constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the
highest veneration.  at first, indeed, i did not feel that natural awe,
which the _yahoos_ and all other animals bear toward them; but it grew
upon me by decrees, much sooner than i imagined, and was mingled with a
respectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish
me from the rest of my species.

when i thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human race
in general, i considered them, as they really were, _yahoos_ in shape and
disposition, perhaps a little more civilized, and qualified with the gift
of speech; but making no other use of reason,

lf ridiculed on that account, without the least mortification.

in the midst of all this happiness, and when i looked upon myself to be
fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little
earlier than his usual hour.  i observed by his countenance that he was
in some perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak.
after a short silence, he told me, ‚Äúhe did not know how i would take what
he was going to say: that in the last general assembly, when the affair
of the _yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offence
at his keeping a _yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family, more like a
_houyhnhnm_ than a brute animal; that he was known frequently to converse
with me, as if he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company;
that such a practice was not agreeable to reason or nature, or a thing
ever heard of before among them; the assembly did therefore exhort him
either to employ me like the rest of my species, or command me to swim
back to the

that many materials,
necessary for making a small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting
in this country; which, however, i would attempt, in obedience and
gratitude to his honour, although i concluded the thing to be impossible,
and therefore looked on myself as already devoted to destruction; that
the certain prospect of an unnatural death was the least of my evils;
for, supposing i should escape with life by some strange adventure, how
could i think with temper of passing my days among _yahoos_, and
relapsing into my old corruptions, for want of examples to lead and keep
me within the paths of virtue? that i knew too well upon what solid
reasons all the determinations of the wise _houyhnhnms_ were founded, not
to be shaken by arguments of mine, a miserable _yahoo_; and therefore,
after presenting him with my humble thanks for the offer of his servants‚Äô
assistance in making a vessel, and desiring a reasonable time for so
difficult a work, i told him i would endeavour to preserve a w

down several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking-staff, and
some larger pieces.  but i shall not trouble the reader with a particular
description of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six weeks
time with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts that
required most labour, i finished a sort of indian canoe, but much larger,
covering it with the skins of _yahoos_, well stitched together with
hempen threads of my own making.  my sail was likewise composed of the
skins of the same animal; but i made use of the youngest i could get, the
older being too tough and thick; and i likewise provided myself with four
paddles.  i laid in a stock of boiled flesh, of rabbits and fowls, and
took with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.

i tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master‚Äôs house, and then
corrected in it what was amiss; stop

when it was as complete as i could possibly make it, i had it drawn on a
carriage very gently by _yahoos_ to the sea-side, under the conduct of
the sorrel nag and another servant.

when all was ready, and the day came for my departure, i took leave of my
master and lady and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears, and my
heart quite sunk with grief.  but his honour, out of curiosity, and,
perhaps, (if i may speak without vanity,) partly out of kindness, was
determined to see me in my canoe, and got several of his neighbouring
friends to accompany him.  i was forced to wait above an hour for t

my design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,
yet sufficient, by my labour, to furnish me with the necessaries of life,
which i would have thought a greater happiness, than to be first minister
in the politest court of europe; so horrible was the idea i conceived of
returning to live in the society, and under the government of _yahoos_.
for in such a solitude as i desired, i could at least enjoy my own
thoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable
_houyhnhnms_, without an opportunity of degenerating into the vices and
corruptions of my own species.

the reader may remember what i related, when my crew conspired against
me, and confined me to my cabin; how i continued there several weeks
without knowing what course we took; and when i was put ashore in the
long-boat, how the sailors told me, with oaths

looking about for a secure landing-place, i saw a sail to the
north-north-east, which appearing every minute more visible, i was in
some doubt whether i should wait for them or not; but at last my
detestation of the _yahoo_ race prevailed: and turning my canoe, i sailed
and paddled together to the south, and got into the same creek whence i
set out in the morning, choosing rather to trust myself among these
barbarians, than live with european _yahoos_.  i drew up my canoe as
close as i could to the shore, and hid myself behind a stone by the
little brook, which, as i have already said, was excellent water.

the ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her long boat
with vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very
well known); but i did not observe it, till the boat was almost on shore;
and it was too late to seek another hiding-place.  the seamen at their
landing observed my canoe, and rummaging it all ov

and asked who i was.  i understood that language very well, and getting
upon my feet, said, ‚Äúi was a poor _yahoo_ banished from the _houyhnhnms_,
and desired they would please to let me depart.‚Äù  they admired to hear me
answer them in their own tongue, and saw by my complexion i must be a
european; but were at a loss to know what i meant by _yahoos_ and
_houyhnhnms_; and at the same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in
speaking, which resembled the neighing of a horse.  i trembled all the
while betwixt fear and hatred.  i again desired leave to depart, and was
gently moving to my canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know,
‚Äúwhat country i was of? whence i came?‚Äù with many other questions.  i
told them ‚Äúi was born in england, whence i came about five years ago, and
then their country and ours were at peace.  i therefore

nt and sullen; i was
ready to faint at the very smell of him and his men.  at last i desired
something to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and
some excellent wine, and then directed that i should be put to bed in a
very clean cabin.  i would not undress myself, but lay on the
bed-clothes, and in half an hour stole out, when i thought the crew was
at dinner, and getting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into
the sea, and swim for my life, rather than continue among _yahoos_.  but
one of the seamen prevented me, and having informed the captain, i was
chained to my cabin.

after dinner, don pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so
desperate an attempt; assured me, ‚Äúhe only meant to do me all the service
he was able;‚Äù and spoke so very movingly, that at last i descended to
treat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason.  i gave
him a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against me by
my own men; of the country where

 they set me on shore, and of my five
years residence there.  all which he looked upon as if it were a dream or
a vision; whereat i took great offence; for i had quite forgot the
faculty of lying, so peculiar to _yahoos_, in all countries where they
preside, and, consequently, their disposition of suspecting truth in
others of their own species.  i asked him, ‚Äúwhether it were the custom in
his country to say the thing which was not?‚Äù  i assured him, ‚Äúi had
almost forgot what he meant by falsehood, and if i had lived a thousand
years in _houyhnhnmland_, i should never have heard a lie from the
meanest servant; that i was altogether indifferent whether he believed me
or not; but, however, in return for his

some part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my
veracity.  but he added, ‚Äúthat since i professed so inviolable an
attachment to truth, i must give him my word and honour to bear him
company in this voyage, without attempting any thing against my life; or
else he would continue me a prisoner till we arrived at lisbon.‚Äù  i gave
him the promise he required; but at the same time protested, ‚Äúthat i
would suffer the greatest hardships, rather than return to live among
_yahoos_.‚Äù

our voyage passed without any considerable accident.  in gratitude to the
captain, i sometimes sat with him, at his earnest request, and strove to
conceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out;
which he suffered to pass without observation.  but the greatest part of
the day i confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.
the captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress,
and offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had.  thi

house at rotherhith. {546}

my wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because they
concluded me certainly dead; but i must freely confess the sight of them
filled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt; and the more, by
reflecting on the near alliance i had to them.  for although, since my
unfortunate exile from the _houyhnhnm_ country, i had compelled myself to
tolerate the sight of _yahoos_, and to converse with don pedro de mendez,
yet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues
and ideas of those exalted _houyhnhnms_.  and when i began to consider
that, by copulating with one of the _yahoo_ species i had become a parent
of more, it struck me with the utmost shame, confusion, and horror.

as soon as i entered the house, my wife took me in her arms, and kissed
me; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal for
so many years, i fell in

out of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that ever i
was an author.  this indeed would be too great a mortification, if i
wrote for fame: but as my sole intention was the public good, i cannot be
altogether disappointed.  for who can read of the virtues i have
mentioned in the glorious _houyhnhnms_, without being ashamed of his own
vices, when he considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of
his country?  i shall say nothing of those remote nations where _yahoos_
preside; among which the least corrupted are the _brobdingnagians_; whose
wise maxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to
observe.  but i forbear descanting further, and rather leave the
judicious reader to his own remarks and application.

i am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet with
no censurers: for what objections can be made against a writer, who
relates only plain facts, that happened in such distant countries, where
we have not the least in

colonies, nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco, i did
humbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our
valour, or our interest.  however, if those whom it more concerns think
fit to be of another opinion, i am ready to depose, when i shall be
lawfully called, that no european did ever visit those countries before
me.  i mean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute
may arise concerning the two _yahoos_, said to have been seen many years
ago upon a mountain in _houyhnhnmland_.

but, as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign‚Äôs name, it
never came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs then
stood, i should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have
put it off to a better opportunity.

having thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against
me as a traveller, i here take a final leave of all my courteous readers,

_houyhnhnms_; to instruct the _yahoos_ of my own family, is far as i

and thus, if possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of
a human creature; to lament the brutality to _houyhnhnms_ in my own
country, but always treat their persons with respect, for the sake of my
noble master, his family, his friends, and the whole _houyhnhnm_ race,

of deformity and diseases, both in
body and mind, smitten with pride, it immediately breaks all the measures
of my patience; neither shall i be ever able to comprehend how such an
animal, and such a vice, could tally together.  the wise and virtuous
_houyhnhnms_, who abound in all excellences that can adorn a rational
creature, have no name for this vice in their language, which has no
terms to express any thing that is evil, except those whereby they
describe the detestable qualities of their _yahoos_, among which they
were not able to distinguish this of pride, for want of thoroughly
understanding human nature, as it shows itself in other countries where
that animal presides.  but i, who had more experience, could plainly
observe some rudiments of it among the wild _yahoos_.

but the _houyhnhnms_, who live under the government of reason, are no
more proud of the good qualities they possess, than i should be for not
wanting a leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of,
although
