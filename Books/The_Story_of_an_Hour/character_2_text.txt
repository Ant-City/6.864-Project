the story of an hour  
by kate chopin (1894) 

 
knowing that mrs. mallard was afflicted with a heart trouble, great care was taken to break to her as 
gently as possible the news of her husband's death.  

it was her sister josephine who told her, in broken sentences; veiled hints that revealed in half concealing. 
her husband's friend richards was there, too, near her. it was he who had been in the newspaper office
