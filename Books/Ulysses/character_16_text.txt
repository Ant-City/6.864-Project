he foresaw his pale body reclined in it at full, naked, in a womb of
warmth, oiled by scented melting soap, softly laved. he saw his
trunk and limbs riprippled over and sustained, buoyed lightly upward,
lemonyellow: his navel, bud of flesh: and saw the dark tangled curls of
his bush floating, floating hair of the stream around the limp father of
thousands, a languid floating flower.

martin cunningham, first, poked his silkhatted head into the creaking
carriage and, entering deftly, seated himself. mr power stepped in after
him, curving his height with care.

â€”come on, simon.

â€”after you, mr bloom said.

mr dedalus covered himself quickly and got in, saying:

yes, yes.

â€”are we all here now? martin cunningham asked. come along, bloom.

mr bloom entered and sat in the vacant place. he pulled the door to

mr dedalus nodded, looking out.

passers. respect. the carriage swerved from the tramtrack to the
smoother road past watery lane. mr bloom at gaze saw a lithe young man,
clad in mourning, a wide hat.

â€”thereâ€™s a friend of yours gone by, dedalus, he said.

â€”who is that?

â€”your son and heir.

â€”where is he? mr d

. martin cunningham began to brush away
crustcrumbs from under his thighs.

â€”what is this, he said, in the name of god? crumbs?

â€”someone seems to have been making a picnic party here lately, mr power
said.

all raised their thighs and eyed with disfavour the mildewed buttonless
leather of the seats. mr dedalus, twisting his nose, frowned downward
and said:

â€”unless iâ€™m greatly mistaken. what do you think, martin?

â€”it struck me too, martin cunningham said.

mr bloom set his thigh down. glad i took that bath. feel my feet quite
clean. but i wish mrs fleming had darned these socks better.

mr dedalus sighed resignedly.

â€”after all, he said, itâ€™s the most natural thing in the world.

â€”did tom kernan turn up? martin cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
his beard gently.

â€”yes, mr bloom answered. heâ€™s behind with ned lambert and hynes.

â€”and corny kelleher himself? mr power asked.

â€”at the cemetery, martin cunningham said.

â€”a pity it did not keep up fine, martin cunningham said.

out.

mr dedalus, peering through his glasses towards the veiled sun, hurled a
mute curse at the sky.

â€”itâ€™s as uncertain as a childâ€™s bottom, he said.

â€”weâ€™re off again.

the carriage turned again its stiff wheels and their trunks swayed
gently. martin cunningham twirled more quickly the peak of his beard.

â€”tom kernan was immense last night, he said. and paddy leonard taking

â€”immense, martin cunningham said pompously. his singing of that simple
ballad, martin, is the most trenchant rendering i ever heard in the
whole course of my experience.

â€”trenchant, mr power said laughing. heâ€™s dead nuts on that. and the
retrospective arrangement.

â€”did you read dan dawsonâ€™s speech? martin cunningham asked.

â€”i did not then, mr dedalus said. where is it?

â€”in the paper this morning.

mr bloom took the paper from his inside pocket. that book i must change
for her.

â€”no, no, mr dedalus said quickly. later on please.

mr power asked:

â€”how is the concert tour getting on, bloom?

â€”o, very well, mr bloom said. i hear great accounts of it. itâ€™s a good
idea, you see...

â€”are you going yourself?

â€”well no, mr bloom said. in point of fact i have to go down to the
county clare on some private business. you see the idea is to tour the
chief towns. what you lose on one you can make up on the other.

â€”quite so, martin cunningham said. mary anderson is up there now.

a tall blackbearded figure, bent on a stick, stumping round the corner
of elveryâ€™s elephant house, showed them a curved hand open on his spine.

â€”in all his pristine beauty, mr power said.

mr dedalus looked after the stumping figure and said mildly:

â€”the devil break the hasp of your back!

mr power, collapsing in laughter, shaded his face from the window as the
carriage passed grayâ€™s statue.

him to the isle of man out of harmâ€™s way but when they were both.....

â€”yes, mr bloom said. they were both on the way to the boat and he tried
to drown.....

â€”drown barabbas! mr dedalus cried. i wish to christ he did!

mr power sent a long laugh down his shaded nostrils.

â€”no, mr bloom said, the son himself.....

martin cunningham thwarted his speech rudely:

â€”reuben j and the son were piking it down the quay next the river on
their way to the isle of man boat and the young chiseller suddenly got
loose and over the wall with him into the liffey.

â€”for godâ€™s sake! mr dedalus exclaimed in fright. is he dead?

â€”dead! martin cunningham cried. not he! a boatman got a pole and fished
him out by the slack of the breeches and he was landed up to the father
on the quay more dead than alive. half the town was there.

â€”isnâ€™t it awfully good? mr bloom said eagerly.

mr powerâ€™s choked laugh burst quietly in the carriage.

custom at all.

saluting ned lambert and john henry menton he walked on at martin
cunninghamâ€™s side puzzling two long keys at his back.

â€”did you hear that one, he asked them, about mulcahy from the coombe?

â€”i did not, martin cunningham said.

they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear. the
caretaker hung his thumbs in the loops of his gold watchchain and spoke
in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.

â€”they tell the story, he said, that two drunks came out here one foggy
evening to look for the grave of a friend of theirs. they asked for
mulcahy from the coombe and were told where he was buried. after
traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. one of the
drunks spelt out the name: te

the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. he
resumed:

â€”and, after blinking up at the sacred figure, not a bloody bit like the
man, says he. thatâ€™s not mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.

rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher, accepting
the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.

â€”thatâ€™s all done with a purpose, martin cunningham explained to hynes.

â€”i know, hynes said. i know that.

â€”to cheer a fellow up, martin cunningham said. itâ€™s pure

john henry menton took off his hat, bulged out the dinge and smoothed
the nap with care on his coatsleeve. he clapped the hat on his head
again.

â€”itâ€™s all right now, martin cunningham said.

john henry menton jerked his head down in acknowledgment.

writ where jacko put the nuts.

he led father cowley boldly forward, linked to his bulk.

â€”filberts i believe they were, mr dedalus said, as he dropped his
glasses on his coatfront, following them.

â€”the youngster will be all right, martin cunningham said, as they passed
out of the castleyard gate.

the policeman touched his forehead.

â€”god bless you, martin cunningham said, cheerily.

he signed to the waiting jarvey who chucked at the reins and set on
towards lord edward street.

bronze by gold, miss kennedyâ€™s head by miss douceâ€™s head, appeared above
the crossblind of the ormond hotel.

â€”yes, martin cunningham said, fingering his beard. i wrote to father
conmee and laid the whole case before him.

â€”you could try our friend, mr p

â€”boyd? martin cunningham said shortly. touch me not.

john wyse nolan, lagging behind, reading the list, came after them
quickly down cork hill.

on the steps of the city hall councillor nannetti, descending, hailed
alderman cowley and councillor abraham lyon ascending.

the castle car wheeled empty into upper exchange street.

â€”look here, martin, john wyse nolan said, overtaking them at the mail
office. i see bloom put his name down for five shillings.

â€”quite right, martin cunningham said, taking the list. and pu

five shillings too.

â€”without a second word either, mr power said.

â€”strange but true, martin cunningham added.

john wyse nolan opened wide eyes.

â€”iâ€™ll say there is much kindness in the jew, he quoted, elegantly.

they went down parliament street.

â€”thereâ€™s jimmy henry, mr power said, just heading for kavanaghâ€™s.

â€”righto, martin cunningham said. here goes.

outside la maison claire blazes boylan waylaid jack mooneyâ€™s
brother-in-law, humpy, tight, making for the liberties.

john wyse nolan fell back with mr power, while martin cunningham took
the elbow of a dapper little man in a shower of hail suit, who walked
uncertainly, with hasty steps past micky andersonâ€™s watches.

â€”the assistant town clerkâ€™s corns are giving him some trouble, john wyse
nolan told mr power.

they followed round the corner towards james kavanaghâ€™s

winerooms. the
empty castle car fronted them at rest in essex gate. martin cunningham,
speaking always, showed often the list at which jimmy henry did not
glance.

â€”and long john fanning is here too, john wyse nolan said, as large as
life.

the tall form of long john fanning filled the doorway where he stood.

â€”good day, mr subsheriff, martin cunningham said, as all halted and
greeted.

long john fanning made no way for them. he removed his large henry clay
decisively and his large fierce eyes scowled intelligently over all
their faces.

â€”are the conscript fathers pursuing their peaceful deliberations? he
said with rich acrid utterance to the assistant town clerk.

hell open to christians they were having, jimmy henry said pettishly,
about their damned irish language. where was the marshal, he wanted
to know, to keep order in the council cha

no quorum even, and hutchinson, the lord mayor, in llandudno and little
lorcan sherlock doing locum tenens for him. damned irish language,
language of our forefathers.

long john fanning blew a plume of smoke from his lips.

martin cunningham spoke by turns, twirling the peak of his beard, to the
assistant town clerk and the subsheriff, while john wyse nolan held his
peace.

â€”what dignam was that? long john fanning asked.

jimmy henry made a grimace and lifted his left foot.

â€”o, my corns! he said plaintively. come upstairs for goodnessâ€™ sake till
i sit down somewhere. uff! ooo! mind!

testily he made room for himself beside long john fanningâ€™s flank and
passed in and up the stairs.

â€”come on up, martin cunningham said to

the subsheriff. i donâ€™t think you
knew him or perhaps you did, though.

with john wyse nolan mr power followed them in.

â€”decent little soul he was, mr power said to the stalwart back of long
john fanning ascending towards long john fanning in the mirror.

â€”rather lowsized. dignam of mentonâ€™s office that was, martin cunningham
said.

long john fanning could not remember him.

clatter of horsehoofs sounded from the air.

â€”whatâ€™s that? martin cunningham said.

all turned where they stood. john wyse nolan came down again. from the
cool shadow of the doorway he saw the horses pass parliament street,
harness and glossy pasterns in sunlight shimmering. gaily they went past
before his cool unfriendly eyes, not quickly. in saddles of the leaders,
leaping leaders, rode outriders.

â€”what was it? martin cunningham asked, as they went on up the staircase.

â€”the lord lieutenantgeneral and general governor of ireland, john wyse
nolan answered from the

â€”the noblest, the truest, says he. and heâ€™s gone, poor little willy,
poor little paddy dignam.

and mournful and with a heavy heart he bewept the extinction of that
beam of heaven.

old garryowen started growling again at bloom that was skeezing round
the door.

â€”come in, come on, he wonâ€™t eat you, says the citizen.

so bloom slopes in with his codâ€™s eye on the dog and he asks terry was
martin cunningham there.

â€”o, christ mâ€™keown, says joe, reading one of the letters. listen to
this, will you?

and he starts reading out one.

â€”same again, terry, says joe. are you sure you wonâ€™t have anything in
the way of liquid refreshment? says he.

â€”thank you, no, says bloom. as a matter of fact i just wanted to meet
martin cunningham, donâ€™t you see, about this insurance of poor dignamâ€™s.
martin asked me to go to the house. you see, he, dignam, i mean, didnâ€™t
serve any notice of the assignment on the company at the time and
nominally under the act the mortgagee canâ€™t recover on the policy.

â€”holy wars, says joe, laughing, thatâ€™s a good one if old shylock is

you all about it, martin cunningham.

sure enough the castle car drove up with martin on it and jack power
with him and a fellow named crofter or crofton, pensioner out of
the collector generalâ€™s, an orangeman blackburn does have on the

ever travelled extensively to any great extent but he was at heart a
born adventurer though by a trick of fate he had consistently remained
a landlubber except you call going to holyhead which was his longest.
martin cunningham frequently said he would work a pass through egan but
some deuced hitch or other eternally cropped up with the net result that
the scheme fell through. but even suppose it did come to planking
down the needful and breaking boydâ€™s heart it was not so dear, purse

snevin. the deceased gentleman was a
most popular and genial personality in city life and his demise after a
brief illness came as a great shock to citizens of all classes by whom
he is deeply regretted. the obsequies, at which many friends of the
deceased were present, were carried out (certainly hynes wrote it with
a nudge from corny) by messrs h. j. oâ€™neill and son, 164 north strand
road. the mourners included: patk. dignam (son), bernard corrigan
(brother-in-law), jno. henry menton, solr, martin cunningham, john

monks the dayfather about keyesâ€™s ad) thomas kernan, simon dedalus,

the sound of the peal of the hour of the night by the chime of the bells
in the church of saint george.

what echoes of that sound were by both and each heard?

by stephen:

      liliata rutilantium. turma circumdet.
      iubilantium te virginum. chorus excipiat.

by bloom:

     heigho, heigho,
     heigho, heigho.

where were the several members of the company which with bloom that day
at the bidding of that peal had travelled from sandymount in the south
to glasnevin in the north?

martin cunningham (in bed), jack power (in bed), simon dedalus (in bed),
ned lambert (in bed), tom kernan (in bed), joe hynes (in bed), john
henry menton (in bed), bernard corrigan (in bed), patsy dignam (in bed),
paddy dignam (in the grave).

double vibration of a jewâ€™s harp in the resonant lane.

alone, what did bloom feel?
