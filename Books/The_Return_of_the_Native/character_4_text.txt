hamed, i don’t see why they shouldn’t have done it here-right,” said a wide-spread woman whose stays creaked like shoes whenever she stooped or turned. “‘tis well to call the neighbours together and to hae a good racket once now and then; and it may as well be when there’s a wedding as at tide-times. i don’t care for close ways.”
“ah, now, you’d hardly believe it, but i don’t care for gay weddings,” said timothy fairway, his eyes again travelling round. “i hardly blame thomasin yeobright and neighbour wildeve for doing it quiet, if i must own it. a wedding at home means five and six-handed reels by the hour; and they do a man’s legs no good when he’s over forty.”
“true. once at the woman’s house you can hardly say nay to being one in a jig, knowing all the time that you be expected to make yourself worth your victuals.”
“you be bound to dance at christmas because ‘tis the time o’ year; you must dance at weddings because ‘tis the time o’ life. at christenin

down on a three-legged milking stool that formed the only seat in the van, and, examining his packet by the light of a candle, took thence an old letter and spread it open. the writing had originally been traced on white paper, but the letter had now assumed a pale red tinge from the accident of its situation; and the black strokes of writing thereon looked like the twigs of a winter hedge against a vermilion sunset. the letter bore a date some two years previous to that time, and was signed “thomasin yeobright.” it ran as follows:—
dear diggory venn,—the question you put when you overtook me coming home from pond-close gave me such a surprise that i am afraid i did not make you exactly understand what i meant. of course, if my aunt had not met me i could have explained all then at once, but as it was there was no chance. i have been quite uneasy since, as you know i do not wish to pain you, yet i fear i shall be doing so now in contradicting what i seemed to say then. i cannot, diggory, marry y

t, i know, agree to it, even if i wished to have you. she likes you very well, but she will want me to look a little higher than a small dairy-farmer, and marry a professional man. i hope you will not set your heart against me for writing plainly, but i felt you might try to see me again, and it is better that we should not meet. i shall always think of you as a good man, and be anxious for your well-doing. i send this by jane orchard’s little maid,—and remain diggory, your faithful friend,
thomasin yeobright.
to mr. venn, dairy-farmer.
since the arrival of that letter, on a certain autumn morning long ago, the reddleman and thomasin had not met till today. during the interval he had shifted his position even further from hers than it had originally been, by adopting the reddle trade; though he was really in very good circumstances still. indeed, seeing that his expenditure was only one-fourth of his income, he might have been called a prosperous man.

s, as to step across and tell you some strange news which has come to my ears about that man.”
“ah! what man?”
he jerked his elbow to the southeast—the direction of the quiet woman.
eustacia turned quickly to him. “do you mean mr. wildeve?”
“yes, there is trouble in a household on account of him, and i have come to let you know of it, because i believe you might have power to drive it away.”
“i? what is the trouble?”
“it is quite a secret. it is that he may refuse to marry thomasin yeobright after all.”
eustacia, though set inwardly pulsing by his words, was equal to her part in such a drama as this. she replied coldly, “i do not wish to listen to this, and you must not expect me to interfere.”
“but, miss, you will hear one word?”
“i cannot. i am not interested in the marriage, and even if i were i could not compel mr. wildeve to do my bidding.”
“as the only lady on the heath i think you might,” said venn with subtle indirectness. “this is how the case stands. m

your young neighbour tamsin with honourable kindness and give up the other woman, he would perhaps do it, and save her a good deal of misery.”
“ah, my life!” said eustacia, with a laugh which unclosed her lips so that the sun shone into her mouth as into a tulip, and lent it a similar scarlet fire. “you think too much of my influence over menfolk indeed, reddleman. if i had such a power as you imagine i would go straight and use it for the good of anybody who has been kind to me—which thomasin yeobright has not particularly, to my knowledge.”
“can it be that you really don’t know of it—how much she had always thought of you?”
“i have never heard a word of it. although we live only two miles apart i have never been inside her aunt’s house in my life.”
the superciliousness that lurked in her manner told venn that thus far he had utterly failed. he inwardly sighed and felt it necessary to unmask his second argument.
“well, leaving that out of the question, ‘tis in your power,

i assure you, miss vye, to do a great deal of good to another woman.”
she shook her head.
“your comeliness is law with mr. wildeve. it is law with all men who see ‘ee. they say, ‘this well-favoured lady coming—what’s her name? how handsome!’ handsomer than thomasin yeobright,” the reddleman persisted, saying to himself, “god forgive a rascal for lying!” and she was handsomer, but the reddleman was far from thinking so. there was a certain obscurity in eustacia’s beauty, and venn’s eye was not trained. in her winter dress, as now, she was like the tiger-beetle, which, when observed in dull situations, seems to be of the quietest neutral colour, but under a full illumination blazes with dazzling splendour.

pen the window-shutters and see the sight outside.
eustacia, who had been sitting listlessly in the parlour, started up at the intelligence and flung open the shutters. facing her on the bank blazed the fire, which at once sent a ruddy glare into the room where she was, and overpowered the candles.
“well done, charley!” said captain vye from the chimney-corner. “but i hope it is not my wood that he’s burning.... ah, it was this time last year that i met with that man venn, bringing home thomasin yeobright—to be sure it was! well, who would have thought that girl’s troubles would have ended so well? what a snipe you were in that matter, eustacia! has your husband written to you yet?”
“no,” said eustacia, looking vaguely through the window at the fire, which just then so much engaged her mind that she did not resent her grandfather’s blunt opinion. she could see charley’s form on the bank, shovelling and stirring the fire; and there flashed upon her imagination some other form which
