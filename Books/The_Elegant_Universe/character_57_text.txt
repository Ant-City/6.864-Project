an indirect approach and thereby
predict the tension on the strings of string theory. their calculations revealed that the strength of the
force transmitted by the proposed graviton pattern of string vibration is inversely proportional to the
string's tension. and since the graviton is supposed to transmit the gravitational force—a force that is
intrinsically quite feeble—they found that this implies a colossal tension of a thousand billion billion
billion billion (1039) tons, the so-called planck tension. fundamental strings are therefore extremely
stiff compared with more familiar examples. this has three important consequences.

three consequences of stiff strings

first, whereas the ends of a violin or a piano string are pinned down, ensuring that they have a fixed
length, no analogous constraining frame pins down the size of a fundamental string. instead, the huge
string tension causes the loops of string theory to contract to a minuscule size. detailed calculation
reveals that being under

centimeters—as previously mentioned.8

second, because of the enormous tension, the typical energy of a vibrating loop in string theory
is extremely high. to understand this, we note that the greater the tension a string is under, the harder
it is to get it to vibrate. for instance, it's far easier to pluck a violin string and set it vibrating than it is
to pluck a piano string. two strings, therefore, that are under different tens

planck's  constant.  denoted  by  the  symbol h,  planck's  constant  is  a  fundamental  parameter  in
quantum mechanics. it determines the size of the discrete units of energy, mass, spin, etc. into which
the microscopic world is partitioned. its value is 1.05 × 10-27 grams-cm/sec.
planck tension. about 1039 tons. the tension on a typical string in string theory.
planck time. about 10-43 seconds. time at which the size of the universe was roughly the planck
length; more precisely, time it takes light to travel the planck length.
