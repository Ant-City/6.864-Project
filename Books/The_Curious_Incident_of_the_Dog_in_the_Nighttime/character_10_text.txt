mother died 2 years ago. 
 
i came home from school one day and no one answered the door, so i went and found the secret key that 
we keep under a flowerpot behind the kitchen door. i let myself into the house and carried on making the 
airfix sherman tank model i was building. 
 
an  hour  and  a  half  later  father  came  home  from  work.  he  runs  a  business  and  he  does  heating 
maintenance and boiler repair with a man called rhodri who is his employee. he knocked on the door of 
my room and opened it and asked whether i had seen mother. 
 
i said that i hadn't seen her and he went downstairs and started making some phone calls. i did not hear 
what he said. 
 
then he came up to my room and said he had to go out for a while and he wasn't sure how long he would 
be. he said that if i needed anything i should call him on his mobile phone. 
 
he was away for 2Â½ hours. when he came back i went downstairs. he was sitting in t

and this shows that intuition can sometimes get things wrong. and intuition is what people use in life to 
make decisions. but logic can help you work out the right answer. 
 
it  also  shows  that  mr.  jeavons  was  wrong  and  numbers  are  sometimes  very  complicated  and  not  very 
straightforward at all. and that is why i like the monty hall problem.

when  i  got  home  rhodri  was  there.  rhodri  is  the  man  who  works  for  father,  helping  him  do  heating 
maintenance and boiler repair. and he sometimes comes round to the house in the evening to drink beer 
with father and watch the television and have a conversation. 
 
rhodri was wearing a pair of white dungarees which had dirty marks all over them and he had a gold ring 
on the middle finger of his left hand and he smelled of something i do not know the name of which father 
often smells of when he comes h

work. 
 
i put my licorice laces and my milky bar in my special food box on the shelf, which father is not allowed 
to touch because it is mine. 
 
then father said, "and what have you been up to, young man?" 
 
and i said, "i went to the shop to get some licorice laces and a milky bar." 
 
and he said, "you were a long time." 
 
and  i  said,  "i  talked  to  mrs.  alexander's  dog  outside  the  shop.  and  i  stroked  him  and  he  sniffed  my 
trousers." which was another white lie. 
 
then rhodri said to me, "god, you do get the third degree, don't you." 
 
but i didn't know what the third degree was. 
 
and he said, "so, how are you doing, captain?" 
 
and i said, "i'm doing very well, thank you," which is what you're meant to say. 
 
and he said, "what's 251 times 864?" 
 
and i thought about this and i said,"216,864." because it was a really easy sum because you just multiply 
864 x 1,000,which is 864,000. then you divide it by 4, which is 216,000, and that's 250 x 864. then you

t add another 864 onto it to get 251 x 864. and that's 216,864. 
 
and i said, "is that right?" 
 
and rhodri said, "i haven't got a bloody clue," and he laughed. 
 
i don't like it when rhodri laughs at me. rhodri laughs at me a lot. father says it is being friendly. 
 
then father said, "i'll stick one of those gobi aloo sag things in the oven for you, ok?" 
 
this is because i like indian food because it has a strong taste. but gobi aloo sag is yellow, so i put red 
food coloring into it before i eat it. and i keep a little plastic bottle of this in my special food box. 
 
and i said, "ok." 
 
and rhodri said, "so, it looks like parky stitched them up, then?" but this was to father, not to me.

ather said, "well, those circuit boards looked like they'd come out of the bloody ark." 
 

and rhodri said, "you going to tell them?" 
 
and father said, "what's the point? they're hardly going to take him to court, are they?" 
 
and rhodri said, "that'll be the day." 
 
and father said, "best to let sleeping dogs lie, i reckon." 
 
then i went into the garden. 
 
siobhan said that when you are writing a book you have to include some descriptions of things. i said that 
i could take photographs and put them in the book. but she said the idea of a book was to describe things 
using words so that people could read them and make a picture in their own head. 
 
and she said it was best to describe things that were interesting or diffe

rent. 
 
she also said that i should describe people in the story by mentioning one or two details about them so 
that people could make a picture of them in their head. which is why i wrote about mr. jeavons's shoes 
with all the holes in them and the policeman who looked as if he had two mice in his nose and the thing 
rhodri smelled of but i didn't know the name for. 
 
so i decided to do a description of the garden. but the garden wasn't very interesting or different. it was 
just a garden, with grass and a shed and a clothesline. but the sky was interesting and different because 
usually skies look boring because they are all blue or all gray or all covered in one pattern of clouds and 
they  don't  look  like  they  are  hundreds  of  miles  above  your  head.  they  look  like  someone  might  have

this water had evaporated from the oceans somewhere in the middle of the gulf of mexico or baffin bay, 
and now it was falling in front of the house and it would drain away into the gutters and flow to a sewage 
station where it would be cleaned and then it would go into a river and go back into the ocean again. 
 
and in the evening on monday father got a phone call from a lady whose cellar had flooded and he had 
to go out and fix it in an emergency. 
 
if there is only one emergency rhodri goes and fixes it because his wife and his children went to live in 
somerset,  which  means  he doesn't  have  anything  to  do  in  the  evenings  apart  from  playing  snooker  and 
drinking and watching the television, and he needs to do overtime to earn money to send to his wife to 
help  her  look  after  the  children.  and  father  has  me  to  look  after.  but  this  evening  there  were  two 
emergencies, so father told me to behave and to ring him on his mobile phone if there was a

that i couldn't feel any other sort of hurt, like the hurt in my chest, and i couldn't hear mother and mr. 
shears arguing and i couldn't think about not doing my a level or the fact that there wasn't a garden at 
451c chapter road, london nw2 5ng, or the fact that i couldn't see the stars. 
 
and then it was monday. and it was very late at night and mr. shears came into my room and woke me 
up and he had been drinking beer because he smelled like father did when he had been drinking beer with 
rhodri.  and  he  said,  "you  think  you're  so  fucking  clever,  don't  you.  don't  you  ever,  ever  think  about 
other people for one second, eh? well, i bet you're really pleased with yourself now, aren't you." 
 
and  then  mother  came  in  and  pulled  him  out of the  room  and  said,  "christopher,  i'm  sorry. i'm  really, 
really sorry." 
 
the  next  morning,  after  mr.  shears  had  gone  to  work,  mother  packed  lots  of  her  clothes  into  two 
suitcases and told me to come down

case you've forgotten." 
 
and father shouted, "is your fucking fancy man here as well?" 
 
and then i picked up the bongo drums that uncle terry had bought me and i knelt down in the corner of 
the room and i pressed my head into the join between the two walls and i banged the drums and i groaned 
and  i  carried  on  doing  this  for  an  hour  and  then  mother  came  into  the  room  and  said  father  had  gone. 
and she said father had gone to stay with rhodri for a while and we would get a place to live of our own 
in the next few weeks. 
 
then i went into the garden and i found toby's cage behind the shed and i brought it inside and i cleaned 
it and put toby back in it. 
 

and i asked mother if i could do my maths a level the next day. 
 
and she said, "i'm sorry, christopher." 
 
and i said, "can i do my maths a level?" 
 
and she said, "you're not listening to me, are you, christopher." 
 
and i said, "i'm listening to you."
