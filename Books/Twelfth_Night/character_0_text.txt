duke.
o, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
to pay this debt of love but to a brother,
how will she love when the rich golden shaft
hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
that live in her; when liver, brain, and heart,
these sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd--
her sweet perfections -- with one self king!
away before me to sweet beds of flow'rs;
love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bow'rs.

what country, friends, is this?

captain.
this is illyria, lady.

viola.
and what should i do in illyria?
my brother he is in elysium.
perchance he is not drown'd. what think you, sailors?

captain.
it is perchance that you yourself were sav'd.

viola.
o my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.

captain.
true, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
assure yourself, after our ship did split,
when you, and those poor number sav'd with y

hung on our driving boat, i saw your brother,
most provident in peril, bind himself,
courage and hope both teaching him the practice,
to a strong mast that liv'd upon the sea;
where, like arion on the dolphin's back,
i saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
so long as i could see.

viola.
for saying so, there's gold:
mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
whereto thy speech serves for authority,
the like of him. know'st thou this country?

captain.
ay, madam, well; for i was bred and born
not three hours' travel from this very place.

viola.
who governs here?

captain.
a noble duke, in nature as in name.

viola.

captain.
orsino.

orsino! i have heard my father name him;
he was a bachelor then.

for but a month ago i went from hence,
and then 'twas fresh in murmur--as, you know,
what great ones do the less will prattle of--
that he did seek the love of fair olivia.

viola.
what's she?

captain.
a virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
that died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
in the protection of his son, her brother,
who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
they say, she hath abjur'd the company
and sight of men.

viola.
o that i serv'd that lady,
and might not be delivered to the world,
till i had made mine own occasion mellow,
what my estate is!

captain.
that were hard to compass,
because she will admit no kind of suit,
no, not the duke's.

viola.
there is a fair behaviour in thee, captain;
and though that nature with a beauteous wall
doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
i will believe thou hast a mind that suits
with this thy fair and outward character.

thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;
it may be worth thy pains, for i can sing
and speak to him in many sorts of music
that will allow me very worth his service.
what else may hap, to time i will commit;
only shape thou silence to my wit.

when my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. but this is from my

this fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
and to do that well craves a kind of wit:
he must observe their mood on whom he jests,
the quality of persons, and the time;
and, like the haggard, check at every feather
that comes before his eye. this is a practice
as full of labour as a wise man's art:
for folly that he wisely shows is fit;
but wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.

he is knight, dubb'd with unhatch'd rapier and on carpet

do not embrace me till each circumstance
of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump

i 'll bring you to a captain in this town,

[to olivia] so comes it, lady, you have been mistook;
but nature to her bias drew in that.

i shall have share in this most happy wreck.
[to viola] boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
thou never shouldst love woman like to me.

viola.
and all those sayings will i over-swear;
and all those swearings keep as true in soul

one day shall crown th' alliance on 't, so please you,
here at my house, and at my proper cost.

duke.
madam, i am most apt t' embrace your offer.
[to viola] your master quits you; and, for your service done him,
so much against the mettle of your sex,
so far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
and since you call'd me master for so long,
here is my hand; you shall from this time be
your master's mistress.
