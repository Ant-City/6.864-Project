s of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. they were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of men. upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an s-rune, wrought of some white metal.
'i have not seen these tokens before,' said aragorn. 'what do they mean?'
's is for sauron,' said gimli. 'that is easy to read.'
'nay!' said legolas. 'sauron does not use the elf-runes.'
'neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said aragorn. 'and he does not use white. the orcs in the service of barad-dûr use the sign of the red eye.' he stood for a moment in thought. 's is for saruman, i guess,' he said at length. 'there is evil afoot in isengard, and the west is no longer safe. it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor saruman has had new

at dusk they halted again. now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the shadows of the east. the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.
'now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said legolas. 'the orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of sauron were behind them. i fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'
gimli ground his teeth. 'this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said.
'to hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said aragorn. 'we shall not turn back here. yet i am weary.' he gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the east. 'there is something strange at work in this land. i distrust the silence. i distrust ev

'i have been among them,' answered aragorn. 'they are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of men before the dark years. but i do not know what has happened here of late, nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron. they have long been the friends of the people of gondor, though they are not akin to them. it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north, and their kinship is rather with the bardings of dale, and with the beornings of the wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the riders of rohan. at least they will not love the orcs.'

'i will,' said éomer lowering his blade. 'but wanderers in the riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt. first tell me your right name.'
'first tell me whom you serve,' said aragorn. 'are you friend or foe of sauron, the dark lord of mordor?'
'i serve only the lord of the mark, théoden king son of thengel,' answered éomer. 'we do not serve the power of the black land far away, but neither are we yet at open war with him; and if you are fleeing from him, then you had best leave this land. there is trouble now on all our borders, and we are threatened; but we desire only to be free, and to live as we have lived, keeping our own, and serving no foreign lord, good or evil. we welcomed guests kindly in the be

'i serve no man,' said aragorn; 'but the servants of sauron i pursue into whatever land they may go. there are few among mortal men who know more of orcs; and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends. in such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. i am not weaponless.'

'tell me, lord,' he said, 'what brings you here? and what was the meaning of the dark words? long has boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. what doom do you bring out of the north?'
'the doom of choice,' said aragorn. 'you may say this to théoden son of thengel: open war lies before him, with sauron or against him. none may live now as they have lived, and few shall keep what they call their own. but of these great matters we will speak later. if chance allows, i will come myself to the king. now i am in great need, and i ask for help, or at least for tidings. you heard that we are pursuing an orc-host that carried off our friends. what can you tell us?'
'that you need not pursue them further,' said éomer. 'the orcs are destroyed.'

'we found none but orcs.'

'i set out from imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,' answered aragorn. 'with me went boromir of minas tirith. my errand was to go to that city with the son of denethor, to aid his folk in their war against sauron. but the company that i journeyed with had other business. of that i cannot speak now. gandalf the grey was our leader.'
'gandalf!' éomer exclaimed. 'gandalf greyhame is known in the mark: but his name, i warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. he has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a season, or after many years. he is ever the herald of strange events: a bringer of evil, some now say.

 true that we are not yet at open war with the black land, and there are some, close to the king's ear, that speak craven counsels; but war is coming. we shall not forsake our old alliance with gondor, and while they fight we shall aid them: so say i and all who hold with me. the east-mark is my charge. the ward of the third marshal, and i have removed all our herds and herdfolk, withdrawing them beyond entwash, and leaving none here but guards and swift scouts.'
'then you do not pay tribute to sauron?' said gimli.
'we do not and we never have.' said éomer with a flash of his eyes; 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. some years ago the lord of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use. then he sent plundering orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter.

'i remember it was long ago - in the time of the war between sauron and the men of the sea - desire came over me to see fimbrethil again. very fair she was still in my eyes, when i had last seen her, though little like the entmaiden of old. for the entwives were bent and browned by their labour; their hair parched by the sun to the hue of ripe corn and their cheeks like red apples. yet their eyes were still the eyes of our own people. we crossed over anduin and came to their land: but we found a desert: it was all burned and uprooted, for war had passed over it

'there was an elvish song that spoke of this, or at least so i understand it. it used to be sung up and down the great river. it was never an entish song, mark you: it would have been a very long song in entish! but we know it by heart, and hum it now and again. this is how it runs in your tongue:

'hoom! yes, indeed. quicker than i expected. indeed i have not seen them roused like this for many an age. we ents do not like being roused; and we never are roused unless it is clear to us that our trees and our lives are in great danger. that has not happened in this forest since the wars of sauron and the men of the sea. it is the orc-work, the wanton hewing - rárum - without even the bad excuse of feeding the fires, that has so angered us; and the treachery of a neighbour, who should have helped us. wizards ought to know better: they do know better. there is no curse in elvish, entish, or the tongues of men bad enough for such treachery. down with saruman!'

'you should be glad, théoden king,' said gandalf. 'for not only the little life of men is now endangered, but the life also of those things which you have deemed the matter of legend. you are not without allies, even if you know them not.'
'yet also i should be sad,' said théoden. 'for however the fortune of war shall go, may it not so end that much that was fair and wonderful shall pass for ever out of middle-earth?'
'it may,' said gandalf. 'the evil of sauron cannot be wholly cured, nor made as if it had not been. but to such days we are doomed. let us now go on with the journey we have begun!'
the company turned then away from the coomb and from the wood and took the road towards the fords. legolas followed reluctantly. the sun had set, already it had sunk behind the rim of the world; but as they rode out from the shadow of the hills and looked west to the gap of rohan the sky was still red, and a burning light was under the floating clouds. dark a

'and what if sauron does not conquer? what will you do to him?' asked pippin.

'the name meant that which looks far away. the orthanc-stone was one.'
'then it was not made, not made' - pippin hesitated - 'by the enemy?'
'no,' said gandalf. 'nor by saruman. it is beyond his art, and beyond sauron's too. the palantíri came from beyond westernesse from eldamar. the noldor made them. fëanor himself, maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured in years. but there is nothing that sauron cannot turn to evil uses. alas for saruman! it was his downfall, as i now perceive. perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves. yet he must bear the blame. fool! to keep it secret, for his own profit. no word did he ever speak of it to any of

. now it appears that, as the rock of orthanc has withstood the storms of time, so there the palantír of that tower has remained. but alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote. very useful, no doubt, that was to saruman; yet it seems that he was not content. further and further abroad he gazed, until he cast his gaze upon barad-dûr. then he was caught!
'who knows where the lost stones of arnor and gondor now lie buried, or drowned deep? but one. at least sauron must have obtained and mastered to his purposes. i guess that it was the ithil-stone, for he took minas ithil long ago and turned it into an evil place: minas morgul, it has become.
'easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of saruman was trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and daunted when persuasion would not serve. the biter bit, the hawk under the eagle's foot, the spider in a steel web! how long, i wonder, has he been constrained to come often to

ven a nazgûl would take a few hours to fly between them. but saruman certainly looked in the stone since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought, i do not doubt, has been read than he intended. a messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing. and after what has happened tonight another will come, i think, and swiftly. so saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in. he has no captive to send. he has no stone to see with, and cannot answer the summons. sauron will only believe that he is withholding the captive and refusing to use the stone. it will not help saruman to tell the truth to the messenger. for isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe in orthanc. so whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. yet he rejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! what he will do in such a plight, i cannot guess. he has power still, i think, while in orthanc, to resist the nine riders. he may try to do so. he may try to trap the nazgûl, or at least to

with that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again. he looked out. clear sky was growing in the east once more. the skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over the emyn muil; upon which the dark thought of sauron brooded for a while. thence it turned, smiting the vale of anduin with hail and lightning, and casting its shadow upon minas tirith with threat of war. then, lowering in the mountains, and gathering its great spires, it rolled on slowly over gondor and the skirts of rohan, until far away the riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as they rode into the west. but here, over the desert and the reeking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more, and a few pallid

aw it come: a small cloud flying from the accursed hills; a black shadow loosed from mordor; a vast shape winged and ominous. it scudded across the moon, and with a deadly cry went away westward, outrunning the wind in its fell speed.
they fell forward, grovelling heedlessly on the cold earth. but the shadow of horror wheeled and returned, passing lower now, right above them, sweeping the fen-reek with its ghastly wings. and then it was gone, flying back to mordor with the speed of the wrath of sauron; and behind it the wind roared away, leaving the dead marshes bare and bleak. the naked waste, as far as the eye could pierce, even to the distant menace of the mountains, was dappled with the fitful moonlight.
frodo and sam got up, rubbing their eyes, like children wakened from an evil dream to find the familiar night still over the world. but gollum lay on the ground as if he had been stunned. they roused him with difficulty, and for some time he would not lift his face, but knelt forward on

when day came at last the hobbits were surprised to see how much closer the ominous mountains had already drawn. the air was now clearer and colder, and though still far off, the walls of mordor were no longer a cloudy menace on the edge of sight, but as grim black towers they frowned across a dismal waste. the marshes were at an end, dying away into dead peats and wide flats of dry cracked mud. the land ahead rose in long shallow slopes, barren and pitiless, towards the desert that lay at sauron's gate.
while the grey light lasted, they cowered under a black stone like worms, shrinking, lest the winged terror should pass and spy them with its cruel eyes. the remainder of that journey was a shadow of growing fear in which memory could find nothing to rest upon. for two more nights they struggled on through the weary pathless land. the air, as it seemed to them, grew harsh, and filled with a bitter reek that caught their breath and parched their mouths.

h, and the bitter inland sea of núrnen amidmost, they swung out long arms northward; and between these arms there was a deep defile. this was cirith gorgor, the haunted pass, the entrance to the land of the enemy. high cliffs lowered upon either side, and thrust forward from its mouth were two sheer hills, black-boned and bare. upon them stood the teeth of mordor, two towers strong and tall. in days long past they were built by the men of gondor in their pride and power, after the overthrow of sauron and his flight, lest he should seek to return to his old realm. but the strength of gondor failed, and men slept, and for long years the towers stood empty. then sauron returned. now the watch-towers, which had fallen into decay, were repaired, and filled with arms, and garrisoned with ceaseless vigilance. stony-faced they were, with dark window-holes staring north and east and west, and each window was full of sleepless eyes.
across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the dark lord had

the two hobbits gazed at the towers and the wall in despair. even from a distance they could see in the dim light the movement of the black guards upon the wall, and the patrols before the gate. they lay now peering over the edge of a rocky hollow beneath the out-stretched shadow of the northmost buttress of ephel dúath. winging the heavy air in a straight flight a crow, maybe, would have flown but a furlon

a new fear was upon them. they heard singing and hoarse shouting. at first it seemed a long way off, but it drew nearer: it was coming towards them. it leaped into all their minds that the black wings had spied them and had sent armed soldiers to seize them: no speed seemed too great for these terrible servants of sauron. they crouched, listening. the voices and the clink of weapons and harness were very close. frodo and sam loosened their small swords in their sheaths. flight was impossible.
gollum rose slowly and crawled insect-like to the lip of the hollow. very cautiously he raised himself inch by inch, until he could peer over it between two broken points of stone. he remained there without moving for some time, making no sound. presently the voices began to recede again, and then they slowly faded away. f

a little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last year's fern. beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. here they decided to rest and pass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. a good day for strolling on their way along the groves and glades of ithilien; but though orcs may shun the sunlight. there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: sauron had many servants. gollum, in any case, would not move under the yellow. face. soon it would look over the dark ridges of the ephel dúath, and he would faint and cower in the light and heat.
sam had been giving earnest thought to food as they marched. now that the despair of the impassable gate was behind him, he did not feel so inclined as his master to take no thought for their livelihood beyond the end of their errand; and anyway it seemed wiser to him to save the waybread of the elves for

he paused and looked more attentively. the horn upon the left was tall and slender; and in it burned a red light, or else the red light in the land beyond was shining

he listened. the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had sighted one another, and both parties were now hurrying and shouting. he heard them both clearly, and he understood what they said. perhaps the ring gave understanding of tongues, or simply understanding, especially of the servants of sauron its maker, so that if he gave heed, he understood and translated the thought to himself. certainly the ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not confer, and that was courage. at present sam still thought only of hiding, of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. he could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears.
