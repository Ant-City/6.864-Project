[CHARACTER] - 
                the
"shrew" of the play's title, [CHARACTER], or kate, is the daughter
of baptista minola, with whom she lives in padua. she is sharp-tongued,
quick-tempered, and prone to violence, particularly against anyone
who tries to marry her. her hostility toward suitors particularly
distresses her father. but her anger and rudeness disguise her deep-seated
sense of insecurity and her jealousy toward her sister, bianca.
she does not resist her suitor petruchio forever, though, and she eventually
subjugates herself to him, despite her previous repudiation of marriage.
