couldn‚Äôt get the visor up; and i could only shake my head, which
was baking hot by this time, and the fly--well, you know how a fly
acts when he has got a certainty--he only minded the shaking enough
to change from nose to lip, and lip to ear, and buzz and buzz
all around in there, and keep on lighting and biting, in a way
that a person, already so distressed as i was, simply could not
stand.  so i gave in, and got alisande to unship the helmet and
relieve me of it.  then she emptied the conveniences out of it
and fetched it full of water, and i drank and then stood up, and
she poured the rest down inside the armor. one cannot think how
refreshing it was.  she continued to fetch and pour until i was
well soaked and thoroughly comfortable.

it was good to have a rest--and peace.  but nothing is quite

these comforts had been in the helmet, and now i had them again,
but no matches.

gradually, as the time wore along, one annoying fact was borne in
upon my understanding--that we were weather-bound.  an armed novice
cannot mount his horse without help and plenty of it.  sandy was
not enough; not enough for me, anyway.  we had to wait until
somebody should come along.  waiting, in silence, would have been
agreeable enough, for i was full of matter for reflection, and
wanted to give it a chance to work.  i wanted to try and think out
how it was that rational or even half-rational men could ever
have learned to wear armor, considering its inconveniences; and
how they had managed to keep up such a fashion for generations
when it was plain that what i had suffered to-day

and moreover i wanted to think out some way to reform this evil
and persuade the people to let the foolish fashion die out; but
thinking was out of the question in the circumstances.  you couldn‚Äôt
think, where sandy was.

she was a quite biddable creature and good-hearted, but she had
a flow of talk that was as steady as a mill, and made your head
sore like the drays and wagons in a city.  if she had had a cork
she would have been a comfort.  but you can‚Äôt cork that kind;
they would die.  her clack was going all day, and you would think
something would surely happen to her works, by and by; but no,
they never got out of order; and she never had to slack up for
words.  she could grind, and pump, and churn,

we must camp, of course.  i found a good shelter for the demoiselle
under a rock, and went off and found another for myself.  but
i was obliged to remain in my armor, because i could not get it off
by myself and yet could not allow alisande to help, because it
would have seemed so like undressing before folk.  it would not
have amounted to that in reality, because i had clothes on
underneath; but the prejudices of one‚Äôs breeding are not gotten
rid of just at a jump, and i knew that when it came to stripping
off that bob-tailed iron petticoat i should be embarrassed.

when the morning came at last, i was in a bad enough plight: seedy,
drowsy, fagged, from want of sleep; weary from thrashing around,
famished from long fasting; pining for a bath, and to get rid of
the animals; and crippled with rheumatism.  and how had it fared
with the nobly born, the titled aristocrat, the demoiselle alisande
la carteloise?  why, she was as fresh as a squirrel; she had slept
like the dead; and as for a bath, probably neither she nor any
other noble in the land had ever had one, and so she was not
missing it.  measured by modern standards, they were merely modified
savages, those people.  this noble lady showed no impatience to get
to breakfast--and that smacks of the savage, too.  on their journeys
those britons were used to long fasts, and knew how to bear them;

sandy was loaded for a three-day stretch.

we were off before sunrise, sandy riding and i limping along
behind.  in half an hour we came upon a group of ragged poor
creatures who had assembled to mend the thing which was regarded
as a road.  they were as humble as animals to me; and when i
proposed to breakfast with them, they were so flattered, so
overwhelmed by this extraordinary condescension of mine that
at first they were not able to believe that i was in earnest.

the farmers were bound to throw in something, to sort of offset
my liberality, whether i would or no; so i let them give me a flint
and steel; and as soon as they had comfortably bestowed sandy
and me on our horse, i lit my pipe.  when the first blast of smoke
shot out through the bars of my helmet, all those people broke
for the woods, and sandy went over backwards and struck the ground
with a dull thud.  they thought i was one of those fire-belching
dragons they had heard so much about from knights and other
professional liars.  i had infinite trouble to persuade those people
to venture back within explaining distance.  then i told them that
this was only a bit of enchantment which would work harm to none
but my enemies.  and i promised, with my hand on my heart, that

there were no casualties to report, for nobody had curiosity enough
to remain behind to see what would happen.

i lost some time, now, for these big children, their fears gone,
became so ravished with wonder over my awe-compelling fireworks
that i had to stay there and smoke a couple of pipes out before
they would let me go.  still the delay was not wholly unproductive,
for it took all that time to get sandy thoroughly wonted to the new
thing, she being so close to it, you know.  it plugged up her
conversation mill, too, for a considerable while, and that was
a gain.  but above all other benefits accruing, i had learned
something.  i was ready for any giant or any ogre that might come
along, now.

we tarried with a holy hermit, that night, and my opportunity
came about the middle of the next afternoon.  we were crossing
a vast meadow by way of short-cut, and i was musing absently,

a remark which she had begun that morning, with the cry:

‚Äúdefend thee, lord!--peril of life is toward!‚Äù

and she slipped down from the horse and ran a little way and stood.
i looked up and saw, far off in the shade of a tree, half a dozen
armed knights and their squires; and straightway there was bustle
among them and tightening of saddle-girths for the mount.  my pipe
was ready and would have been lit, if i had not been lost in

a handsome sight, a beautiful sight--for a man up a tree.  i laid
my lance in rest and waited, with my heart beating, till the iron
wave was just ready to break over me, then spouted a column of
white smoke through the bars of my helmet.  you should have seen
the wave go to pieces and scatter!  this was a finer sight than
the other one.

but these people stopped, two or three hundred yards away, and
this troubled me.  my satisfaction collapsed, and fear came;
i judged i was a lost man.  but sandy was radiant; and was going
to be eloquent--but i stopped her, and told her my magic had
miscarried, somehow or other, and she must mount, with all despatch,
and we must ride for life.  no, she wouldn‚Äôt.  she said that my
enchantment had disabled those knights; they were not riding on,
because they couldn‚Äôt; wait, they would drop out of their saddles
presently, and we would get their horses and harness.  i could not
deceive such trusting simplicity, so i said it was a mistake; that

i couldn‚Äôt tell what; but we must hurry and get away, for those
people would attack us again, in a minute.  sandy laughed, and said:

‚Äúlack-a-day, sir, they be not of that breed!  sir launcelot will
give battle to dragons, and will abide by them, and will assail
them again, and yet again, and still again, until he do conquer
and destroy them; and so likewise will sir pellinore and sir aglovale
and sir carados, and mayhap others, but there be none else that
will venture it, let the idle say what the idle will.  and, la,

really, is that ‚Äòsooth‚Äô--as you people say?  if they want to,
why don‚Äôt they?‚Äù

‚Äúit would like them much; but an ye wot how dragons are esteemed,
ye would not hold them blamable. they fear to come.‚Äù

‚Äúwell, then, suppose i go to them instead, and--‚Äù

‚Äúah, wit ye well they would not abide your coming.  i will go.‚Äù

and she did.  she was a handy person to have along on a raid.
i would have considered this a doubtful errand, myself.  i presently
saw the knights riding away, and sandy coming back.  that was
a relief.  i judged she had somehow failed to get the first innings
--i mean in the conversation; otherwise the interview wouldn‚Äôt have
been so short.  but it turned out that she had managed the business
well; in fact, admirably.  she said that when she told those people
i was the boss, it hit them where they lived: ‚Äúsmote them sore

put up with anything she might require.  so she swore them to appear

say anything.  i judged that the irish knight was in trouble with
the visitors by this time, and this turned out to be the case.

‚Äúthe truth is, alisande, these archaics are a little _too_ simple;
the vocabulary is too limited, and so, by consequence, descriptions
suffer in the matter of variety; they run too much to level saharas
of fact, and not enough to picturesque detail; this throws about
them a certain air of the monotonous; in fact the fights are all
alike: a couple of people come together with great random

so is holocaust, and defalcation, and usufruct and a hundred other

never have been attempted in the first place.  and yet, once you
start a mistake, the trouble is done and you never know what is
going to come of it.

when i came to myself again and began to listen, i perceived that
i had lost another chapter, and that alisande had wandered a long
way off with her people.

‚Äúand so they rode and came into a deep valley full of stones,
and thereby they saw a fair stream of water; above thereby was
the head of the stream, a fair fountain, and three damsels sitting
thereby. in this country, said sir marhaus, came never knight

 just to hear her dear voice come melting back to me with a

she got three dollars a week, but she was worth it.

i could not follow alisande‚Äôs further explanation of who our
captured knights were, now--i mean in case she should ever get
to explaining who they were.  my interest was gone, my thoughts
were far away, and sad.  by fitful glimpses of the drifting tale,
caught here and there and now and then, i merely noted in a vague
way that each of these three knights took one of these three damsels
up behind him on his horse, and one rode north, another east,
the other south, to seek adventures, and meet again and lie, after

alisande had begun to tell me who the cowboys were; so she had made
pretty good progress with it--for her.  she would arrive some time
or other, no doubt, but she was not a person who could be hurried.

we were approaching a castle which stood on high ground; a huge,
strong, venerable structure, whose gray towers and battlements were
charmingly draped with ivy, and whose whole majestic mass was
drenched with splendors flung from the sinking sun.  it was the
largest castle we had seen, and so i thought i

if knights errant were to be believed, not all castles were desirable
places to seek hospitality in.  as a matter of fact, knights errant

time, and scaled accordingly, you got the truth.  it was very

s in his time.  his chief
celebrity rested upon the events of an excursion like this one
of mine, which he had once made with a damsel named maledisant,
who was as handy with her tongue as was sandy, though in a different
way, for her tongue churned forth only railings and insult, whereas
sandy‚Äôs music was of a kindlier sort.  i knew his story well, and so
i knew how to interpret the compassion that was in his face when he
bade me farewell.  he supposed i was having a bitter hard time of it.

sandy and i discussed his story, as we rode along, and she said
that la cote‚Äôs bad luck had begun with the very beginning of that
trip; for the king‚Äôs fool had overthrown him on the first day,
and in such cases it was customary for the girl to desert to the
conqueror, but maledisant didn‚Äôt do it; and also persisted afterward
in sticking to him, after all his defeats.  but, said i, suppose
the victor should decline to accept his spoil?  she said that that

everybody crossed himself in a grisly fright, for a curse was an
awful thing to those people; but the queen rose up majestic, with
the death-light in her eye, and flung back this ruthless command:

‚Äúlay hands on her!  to the stake with her!‚Äù

the guards left their posts to obey.  it was a shame; it was a
cruel thing to see.  what could be done?  sandy gave me a look;
i knew she had another inspiration.  i said:

‚Äúdo what you choose.‚Äù

she was up and facing toward the queen in a moment.  she indicated
me, and said:

‚Äúmadame, _he_ saith this may not be.  recall the commandment, or he
will dissolve the castle and it shall vanish away like the instable
fabric of a dream!‚Äù

well, she certainly was a curious one, was morgan le fay.  i have
seen a good many kinds of women in my time, but she laid over them
all for variety.  and how sharply characteristic of her this episode
was.  she had no more idea than a horse of how to photograph
a procession; but being in doubt, it was just like her to try
to do it with an axe.



chapter xix

knight-errantry as a trade

sandy and i were on the road again, next morning, bright and early.
it was so good to open up one‚Äôs lungs and take in whole luscious
barrels-ful of the blessed god‚Äôs untainted, dew-fashioned,
woodland-scented air once more, after suffocating body and mind for two
days and nights in the moral and physical stenches of that intolerable
old buzzard-roost!  i mean, for me: of course the place was all
right and agreeable enough for sandy, for she had been used to
high life all her days.

up the unget-aroundable fact that, all gentle cant and philosophizing
to the contrary notwithstanding, no people in the world ever did
achieve their freedom by goody-goody talk and moral suasion:
it being immutable law that all revolutions that will succeed must
_begin_ in blood, whatever may answer afterward.  if history teaches
anything, it teaches that.  what this folk needed, then, was a
reign of terror and a guillotine, and i was the wrong man for them.

two days later, toward noon, sandy began to show signs of excitement
and feverish expectancy.  she said we were approaching the ogre‚Äôs
castle.  i was surprised into an uncomfortable shock.  the object
of our quest had gradually dropped out of my mind; this sudden
resurrection of it made it seem quite a real and startling thing
for a moment, and roused up in me a smart interest.  sandy‚Äôs
excitement increased every moment; and so did mine, for that sort
of thing is catching.  my heart got to thumping.  you can‚Äôt reason
with y

our heart; it has its own laws, and thumps about things which
the intellect scorns.  presently, when sandy slid from the horse,
motioned me to stop, and went creeping stealthily, with her head
bent nearly to her knees, toward a row of bushes that bordered
a declivity, the thumpings grew stronger and quicker.  and they
kept it up while she was gaining her ambush and getting her glimpse
over the declivity; and also while i was creeping to her side on
my knees.  her eyes were burning now, as she pointed with her
finger, and said in a panting whisper:

‚Äúthe castle!  the castle!  lo, where it looms!‚Äù

 swine-herds--‚Äù

‚Äúthe ogres, are _they_ changed also?  it is most wonderful.  now
am i fearful; for how canst thou strike with sure aim when five of
their nine cubits of stature are to thee invisible?  ah, go warily,
fair sir; this is a mightier emprise than i wend.‚Äù

‚Äúyou be easy, sandy.  all i need to know is, how _much_ of an ogre
is invisible; then i know how to locate his vitals.  don‚Äôt you be
afraid, i will make short work of these bunco-steerers.  stay
where you are.‚Äù

i left sandy kneeling there, corpse-faced but plucky and hopeful,
and rode down to the pigsty, and struck up a trade with the
swine-herds.  i won their gratitude by buying out all the hogs
at the lump sum of sixteen pennies, which was rather above latest
quotations.  i was just in time; for the church, the lord of the
manor, and the rest of the tax-gatherers would have been along
next day and swept off pretty much all the stock, leaving the
swine-herds very short of hogs and sandy out of princesses.  but

how curious.  the same thing had happened in the wales of my day,
under this same old established church, which was supposed by many
to have changed its nature when it changed its disguise.

i sent the three men away, and then opened the sty gate and beckoned
sandy to come--which she did; and not leisurely, but with the rush
of a prairie fire.  and when i saw her fling herself upon those
hogs, with tears of joy running down her cheeks, and strain them
to her heart, and kiss them, and caress them, and call them
reverently by grand princely names, i was ashamed of her, ashamed
of the human race.

we had to drive those hogs home--ten miles; and no ladies were
ever more fickle-minded or contrary.  they would stay in no road,
no path; they broke out through the

 brush on all sides, and flowed
away in all directions, over rocks, and hills, and the roughest
places they could find.  and they must not be struck, or roughly
accosted; sandy could not bear to see them treated in ways unbecoming
their rank.  the troublesomest old sow of the lot had to be called
my lady, and your highness, like the rest.  it is annoying and
difficult to scour around after hogs, in armor.  there was one
small countess, with an iron ring in her snout and hardly any hair
on her back, that was the devil for perversity.  she gave me a race
of an hour, over all sorts of country, and then we were right where
we had started from, having made not a rod of real

i seized her at last by the tail, and brought her along squealing.
when i overtook sandy she was horrified, and said it was in the
last degree indelicate to drag a countess by her train.

we got the hogs home just at dark--most of them.  the princess
nerovens de morganore was missing, and two of her ladies in waiting:
namely, miss angela bohun, and the demoiselle elaine courtemains,
the former of these two being a young black sow with a white star
in her forehead, and the latter a brown one with thin legs and a
slight limp in the forward shank on the starboard side--a couple

could produce; and yet, from my point of view she was acting like
a crazy woman.  my land, the power of training! of influence!
of education!  it can bring a body up to believe anything.  i had
to put myself in sandy‚Äôs place to realize that she was not a
lunatic.  yes, and put her in mine, to demonstrate how easy it is
to seem a lunatic to a person who has not been taught as you have
been taught.  if i had told sandy i had seen a wagon, uninfluenced
by enchantment, spin along fifty miles an hour; had seen a man,
unequipped with magic powers, get into a basket and soar out of
sight among the clouds; and had listened, without any necromancer‚Äôs
help, to the conversation of a person who was several hundred miles
away, sandy would not merely have supposed me to be crazy, she
would have thought she knew it.  everybody around her believed in
enchantments; nobody had any doubts; to doubt that a castle could

that the world was not flat, and hadn‚Äôt pillars under it to support
it, nor a canopy over it to turn off a universe of water that
occupied all space above; but as i was the only person in the kingdom
afflicted with such impious and criminal opinions, i recognized
that it would be good wisdom to keep quiet about this matter, too,
if i did not wish to be suddenly shunned and forsaken by everybody
as a madman.

the next morning sandy assembled the swine in the dining-room and
gave them their breakfast, waiting upon them personally and
manifesting in every way the deep reverence which the natives of
her island, ancient and modern, have always felt for rank, let its
outward casket and the mental and moral contents be what they may.
i could have eaten with the hogs if i had had birth approaching my
lofty official rank; but i hadn‚Äôt, and so accepted the unavoidable
slight and made no complaint.  sandy and i had our breakfast a

english wits of the first quarter of the far-off nineteenth century
were sprung here and there and yonder along the line, and compelled
the delightedest applause; and sometimes when a bright remark was
made at one end of the procession and started on its travels toward
the other, you could note its progress all the way by the sparkling
spray of laughter it threw off from its bows as it plowed along;
and also by the blushes of the mules in its wake.

sandy knew the goal and purpose of this pilgrimage, and she posted
me.  she said:

‚Äúthey journey to the valley of holiness, for to be blessed of the
godly hermits and drink of the miraculous waters and be cleansed
from sin.‚Äù

‚Äúwhere is this watering place?‚Äù

hunted up my weakest place and located itself there.  this was
the place where the abbot put his arms about me and mashed me, what
time he was moved to testify his gratitude to me with an embrace.

when at last i got out, i was a shadow.  but everybody was full
of attentions and kindnesses, and these brought cheer back into
my life, and were the right medicine to help a convalescent swiftly
up toward health and strength again; so i gained fast.

sandy was worn out with nursing; so i made up my mind to turn out
and go a cruise alone, leaving her at the nunnery to rest up.
my idea was to disguise myself as a freeman of peasant degree
and wander through the country a week or two on foot.  this would
give me a chance to eat and lodge with the lowliest and poorest
class of free citizens on equal terms.  there was no other way
to inform myself perfectly of their everyday life and the operation
of the laws upon it.  if i went among them as a gentlem

broke my heart was something which happened in front of our old
barrack in a square, while we were enduring the spectacle of a man
being boiled to death in oil for counterfeiting pennies.  it was

hang him, i supposed he was in earnest, and was beginning to be
persuaded by him, until he exploded that cat-howl and startled me
almost out of my clothes.  but he never could be in earnest.  he
didn‚Äôt know what it was.  he had pictured a distinct and perfectly
rational and feasible improvement upon constitutional monarchy,
but he was too feather-headed to know it, or care anything about
it, either.  i was going to give him a scolding, but sandy came
flying in at that moment, wild with terror, and so choked with sobs
that for a minute she could not get her voice.  i ran and took her
in my arms, and lavished caresses upon her and said, beseechingly:

‚Äúspeak, darling, speak!  what is it?‚Äù

her head fell limp upon my bosom, and she gasped, almost inaudibly:

‚Äúhello-central!‚Äù

‚Äúquick!‚Äù i shouted to clarence; ‚Äútelephone the king‚Äôs homeopath
to come!‚Äù

in two minutes i was kneeling by the child‚Äôs crib, and sandy was

ching servants here, there, and everywhere, all over the
palace.  i took in the situation almost at a glance--membranous
croup!  i bent down and whispered:

‚Äúwake up, sweetheart!  hello-central.‚Äù

she opened her soft eyes languidly, and made out to say:

‚Äúpapa.‚Äù

that was a comfort.  she was far from dead yet.  i sent for
preparations of sulphur, i rousted out the croup-kettle myself;
for i don‚Äôt sit down and wait for doctors when sandy or the child
is sick.  i knew how to nurse both of them, and had had experience.
this little chap had lived in my arms a good part of its small life,
and often i could soothe away its troubles and get it to laugh
through the tear-dews on its eye-lashes when even its mother couldn‚Äôt.

sir launcelot, in his richest armor, came striding along the great
hall now on his way to the stock-board; he was president of the
stock-board, and occupied the siege perilous, which he had bought
of sir galahad;

shorts to-day; but what of that?  he was
the same old launcelot, and when he glanced in as he was passing
the door and found out that his pet was sick, that was enough
for him; bulls and bears might fight it out their own way for all
him, he would come right in here and stand by little hello-central
for all he was worth.  and that was what he did.  he shied his
helmet into the corner, and in half a minute he had a new wick
in the alcohol lamp and was firing up on the croup-kettle.  by this
time sandy had built a blanket canopy over the crib, and everything
was ready.

sir launcelot got up steam, he and i loaded up the kettle with
unslaked lime and carbolic acid, with a touch of lactic acid added
thereto, then filled the thing up with water and inserted the
steam-spout under the canopy.  everything was ship-shape now,
and we sat down on either side of the crib to stand our watch.
sandy was so grateful and so comforted that she charged a couple
of church-wardens with willow-bark and sumach-tob

iful friendships between two persons of the same
sex.  what is the best of that sort, as compared with the friendship
of man and wife, where the best impulses and highest ideals of
both are the same?  there is no place for comparison between
the two friendships; the one is earthly, the other divine.

in my dreams, along at first, i still wandered thirteen centuries
away, and my unsatisfied spirit went calling and harking all up
and down the unreplying vacancies of a vanished world.  many a
time sandy heard that imploring cry come from my lips in my sleep.
with a grand magnanimity she saddled that cry of mine upon our
child, conceiving it to be the name of some lost darling of mine.
it touched me to tears, and it also nearly knocked me off my feet,
too, when she smiled up in my face for an earned reward, and played
her quaint and pretty surprise upon me:

‚Äúthe name of one who was dear to thee is here preserved, here made
holy, and the music of it will abide alway in our ears.  now

 hair, and i could take my own time about dating the
explosion.  you couldn‚Äôt hire one of them to go back during the
century, if the explosion was still impending.

we had a week of waiting.  it was not dull for me, because i was
writing all the time.  during the first three days, i finished
turning my old diary into this narrative form; it only required
a chapter or so to bring it down to date.  the rest of the week
i took up in writing letters to my wife.  it was always my habit
to write to sandy every day, whenever we were separate, and now
i kept up the habit for love of it, and of her, though i couldn‚Äôt
do anything with the letters, of course, after i had written them.
but it put in the time, you see, and was almost like talking;
it was almost as if i was saying, ‚Äúsandy, if you and hello-central
were here in the cave, instead of only your photographs, what
good times we could have!‚Äù  and then, you know, i could imagine
the baby goo-gooing something out in reply, with its fists i
