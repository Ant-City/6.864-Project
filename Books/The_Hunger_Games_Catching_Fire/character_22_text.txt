usual next to venia's thin, angular one. â€œthere, there. you can fix those in no time. but what 
am i going to do with these nails?â€ she grabs my hand and pins it flat between her two pea 
green ones. no, her skin isn't exactly pea green now. it's more of a light evergreen. the shift 
in shade is no doubt an attempt to stay abreast of the capricious fashion trends of the capitol. 
â€œreally, katniss, you could have left me something to work with!â€ she wails. 

it's true. i've bitten my nails to stubs in the past couple of months. i thought about trying to 
break the habit but couldn't think of a good reason i should. â€œsorry,â€ i mutter. i hadn't really 
been spending much time worrying about how it might affect my prep team. 

flavius lifts a few strands of my wet, tangled hair. he gives his head a disapproving shake, 
causing  his  orange  corkscrew  curls  to  bounce  around.  â€œhas  anyone  touched  this  since  you 
last  saw  us?â€  he  asks  sternly

shiny white boots like she's about to take flight, likeâ€” 

bam! it's like someone actually hits me in the chest. no one has, of course, but the pain  is 
so real i take a step back. i squeeze my eyes shut and i don't see primâ€”i see rue, the twelve-
year-old girl from district 11 who was my ally in the arena. she could fly, birdlike, from tree 
to tree, catching on to the slenderest branches. rue, who i didn't save. who i let die. i picture 
her lying on the ground with the spear still wedged in her stomach... . 

who else will i fail to save from the capitol's vengeance? who else will be dead if i don't 

satisfy president snow? 

i realize cinna's trying to put a coat on me, so i raise my arms. i feel fur, inside and out,

rry covers my ears. â€œyou're bringing 
earmuffs back in style.â€ 

i hate earmuffs, i think. they make it hard to hear, and since i was blasted deaf in one ear 
in the arena, i dislike them  even  more.  after i won, the capitol repaired  my  ear,  but i still 
find myself testing it. 

my mother hurries up with something cupped in her hand. â€œfor good luck,â€ she says. 

it's the pin madge gave me before i left for the games. a mockingjay flying in a circle of 
gold. i tried to give it to rue but she wouldn't take it. she said the pin was the reason she'd 
decided to trust me. cinna fixes it on the knot in the scarf. 

effie  trinket's  nearby,  clapping  her  hands.  â€œattention,  everyone!  we're  about  to  do  the 
first outdoor shot, where the victors greet each other at the beginning of their marvelous trip. 
all  right,  katniss,  big  smile,  you're  very  excited,  right?â€  i  don't  exaggerate  when  i  say  she 
shoves me out the door.

shoulder  a  pat  and  says,  â€œyou  could  do  a  lot  worse,  you  know.â€  he  heads  off  to  his 
compartment, taking the smell of wine with him. 

in my room, i remove my sodden slippers, my wet robe and pajamas. there are more in 
the drawers but i just crawl between the covers of my bed in my underclothes. i stare into the 
darkness, thinking about my conversation with haymitch. everything he said was true about 
the capitol's expectations, my future with peeta, even his last comment. of course, i could do 
a lot worse than peeta. that isn't really the point, though, is it? one of the few freedoms we 
have in district 12 is the right to marry who we want or not marry at all. and now even that 
has been taken away from me. i wonder if president snow will insist we have children. if we 
do, they'll have to face the reaping each year. and wouldn't it be something to see the child of 
not one but two

difference  it  makes  when  i  get  up,  since  this  is  a  travel  day,  but  then  it  turns  out  that 
yesterday's makeover was just to get me to the train station. today i'll get the works from my 
prep team. 

â€œwhy? it's too cold for anything to show,â€ i grumble. 

â€œnot in district eleven,â€ says effie. 

district 11. our first stop. i'd rather start in any other district, since this was rue's home. 
but  that's  not  how  the  victory  tour  works.  usually  it  kicks  off  in  12  and  then  goes  in 
descending  district  order  to  1,  followed  by  the  capitol.  the  victor's  district  is  skipped  and 
saved for very last. since 12 puts on the least fabulous celebration â€” usually just a dinner for 
the tributes and a victory rally in the square, where nobody looks like they're having any fun 

â€” it's probably best to get us out of the way as soon as possible. this year

watch as peeta positions his artificial leg. â€œbad 

day, huh?â€ â€œit's nothing,â€ i say. 

he takes a deep breath. â€œlook, katniss, i've been wanting to talk to you about the way i 
acted  on  the  train.  i  mean,  the  last  train.  the  one  that  brought  us  home.  i  knew  you  had 
something with gale. i was jealous of him before i even officially met you. and it wasn't fair 
to hold you to anything that happened in the games. i'm sorry.â€ 

his apology takes me by surprise. it's true that peeta froze me out after i confessed that my 
love for him during the games was something of an act. but i don't hold that against him. in 
the  arena,  i'd  played  that romance  angle  for  all  it  was  worth. there  had  been  times  when  i 
didn't honestly know how i felt about him. i still don't, really. 

â€œi'm sorry, too,â€ i say. i'm not sure for what exactly. maybe because there's a real chance 

i'm about to destroy him. 

â€œthere's  nothing  for  you  to  be  sorry  about.

now plague me whenever i sleep. but the old standby, the one of my father being blown to 
bits  in  the  mines,  is  rare.  instead  i  relive  versions  of  what  happened  in  the  arena.  my 
worthless  attempt  to  save  rue.  peeta  bleeding  to  death.  glimmer's  bloated  body 
disintegrating  in  my  hands.  cato's  horrific  end  with  the  muttations.  these  are  the  most 
frequent visitors. â€œme, too. does it help? to paint them out?â€ 

â€œi don't know. i think i'm  a  little  less afraid of going to sleep at night, or i tell  myself i

t  least  thirty-five  feet  in  the  air  and  topped  with  wicked  coils  of 
barbed  wire,  it  makes  ours  back  in  district  12  look  childish.  my  eyes  quickly  inspect  the 
base, which is lined with enormous metal plates. there would be no burrowing under those, 
no  escaping  to  hunt.  then  i  see  the  watchtowers,  placed  evenly  apart,  manned  with  armed 
guards, so out of place among the fields of wildflowers around them. 

â€œthat's something different,â€ says peeta. 

rue did give me the impression that the rules in district 11 were more harshly enforced. 

but i never imagined something like this. 

now the crops begin, stretched out as far as  the  eye can see. men, women, and children 
wearing straw hats to keep off the sun straighten up, turn our way, take a moment to stretch 
their backs as they watch our train go by. i can see orchards in the distance, and i wonder if 
that's where rue would  have worked, collecting the  fruit  from the slimmest branches a

it goes. i can't believe the size of district 11. â€œhow many people do you think 
live here?â€ peeta asks. i shake my head. in school they refer to it as a large district, that's all. 
no actual figures on the population. but those kids we see on camera waiting for the reaping 
each year, they can't be but a sampling of the ones who actually live here. what do they do? 
have  preliminary  drawings?  pick  the  winners  ahead  of  time  and  make  sure  they're  in  the 
crowd? how exactly did rue end up on that stage with nothing but the wind offering to take 
her place? 

i begin to weary of the vastness, the endlessness of this place. when effie comes to tell us 

to dress, i don't object. 

i go to  my  compartment and  let the prep team do my  hair and  makeup. cinna comes  in 
with a pretty orange frock patterned with autumn leaves. i think how much peeta will like the 
color.

our  honor,  and  we'll  respond  with  a  scripted  thank-you  provided  by  the  capitol.  if  a  victor 
had  any  special  allies  among  the  dead  tributes,  it  is  considered  good  form  to  add  a  few 
personal  comments  as  well.  i  should  say  something  about  rue,  and  thresh,  too,  really,  but 
every time i tried to write it at home, i ended up with a blank paper staring me in the face: it's 
hard  for  me  to  talk  about  them  without  getting  emotional.  fortunately,  peeta  has  a  little 
something worked up, and with some slight alterations, it can count for both of us. at the end 
of the ceremony, we'll be presented with some sort of plaque, and then we can withdraw to 
the justice building, where a special dinner will be served.

i  see  the  buildings  on  the  square  have  been  hung  with  banners  that  help  cover  up  their 
neglected  state.  it's  packed  with  people,  but  again,  just  a  fraction  of  the  number  who  live 
here. 

as  usual,  a  special  platform  has  been  constructed  at  the  bottom  of  the  stage  for  the 
families  of  the  dead  tributes.  on  thresh's  side,  there's  only  an  old  woman  with  a  hunched 

back and a tall, muscular girl i'm guessing is his sister. on rue's ... i'm not prepared for rue's 
family. her parents, whose faces are still fresh with sorrow. her five younger siblings, who 
resemble  her  so  closely.  the  slight  builds,  the  luminous  brown  eyes.  they  form  a  flock  of 
small dark birds. 

the applause dies out and the mayor gives the speech in our honor. two little girls come 
up with tremendous bouquets of flowers. peeta does his part of the scripted reply and then i 
find my lips moving to conclude it. fortunately my mother and

 prim have drilled me so i can 
do it in my sleep. 

peeta had his personal comments written on a card, but he doesn't pull  it out. instead he 
speaks in his simple, winning style about thresh and rue making it to the final eight, about 
how they  both kept me aliveâ€”thereby keeping him aliveâ€”and about  how this  is a debt we 
can  never  repay.  and  then  he  hesitates  before  adding  something  that  wasn't  written  on  the 
card. maybe because he thought effie might make him remove it. â€œit can in no way replace 
your  losses,  but  as  a  token  of  our  thanks  we'd  like  for  each  of  the  tributes'  families  from 
district  eleven  to  receive  one  month  of  our  winnings

 every  year  for  the  duration  of  our 
lives.â€ 

the crowd can't help but respond with gasps and murmurs. there is no precedent for what 
peeta has done. i don't even know if it's legal. he probably doesn't know, either, so he didn't 
ask in case it isn't. as for the families, they just stare at us in shock. their lives were changed 
forever  when  thresh  and  rue  were  lost,  but  this  gift  will  change  them  again.  a  month  of 
tribute winnings can easily provide for a family for a year. as long as we live, they will not 
hunger. 

i look at peeta and he gives me a sad smile. i hear haymitch's voice. â€œyou could do a lot 
worse.â€ at this moment, it's impossible to imagine how i could do any better. the gift ... it is 
perfect. so when i rise up on tiptoe to kiss him, it doesn't seem forced at all. 

the mayor steps forward and presents us each

 with a plaque that's so large i have to put 
down my bouquet to hold it. the ceremony's about to end when i notice one of rue's sisters 
staring at me. she must be about nine and is almost an exact replica of rue, down to the way 
she stands with her arms slightly extended. despite the good news about the winnings, she's 
not happy. in fact, her look is reproachful. is it because i didn't save rue? 

no. it's because i still haven't thanked her, i think. 

a wave of shame rushes through me. the girl is right. how can i stand here, passive and 
mute, leaving all the words to peeta? if she had won, rue would never have let my death go 
unsung. i remember how i took care in the arena to cover her with flowers, to make sure her 
loss did not go unnoticed. but that gesture will mean nothing if i don't support it now. 

â€œwait!â€ i stumble forward, pressing the plaque to my chest. my allotte

them from the beginning, but he wouldn't do it. i respected him for that.â€ 

for the  first time the old  hunched woman  â€”  is she thresh's grandmother?  â€”  raises  her 

head and the trace of a smile plays on her lips. 

the crowd has fallen silent now, so silent that i wonder how they manage it. they must all 

be holding their breath. 

i  turn  to  rue's  family.  â€œbut  i  feel  as  if  i  did  know  rue,  and  she'll  always  be  with  me. 
everything  beautiful  brings  her  to  mind.  i  see  her  in  the  yellow  flowers  that  grow  in  the 
meadow by my house. i see her in the mockingjays that sing in the trees. but most of all, i 
see her in my sister, prim.â€ my voice is undependable, but i am almost finished. â€œthank you 
for your children.â€ i raise my chin to address the crowd. â€œand thank you all for the bread.â€

pause. then,  from somewhere  in the  crowd, someone whistles  rue's  four-note mocking-jay 
tune. the one that signaled the end of the workday in the orchards. the one that meant safety 
in the arena. by the end of the tune, i have found the whistler, a wizened old man in a faded 
red shirt and overalls. his eyes meet mine. 

what happens next is not an accident. it is too well executed to be spontaneous, because it 
happens  in  complete  unison.  every  person  in  the  crowd  presses  the  three  middle  fingers  of 
their left hand against their lips and

recent orders to calm the districts fresh in my ears, it fills me with dread. what will he think 
of this very public salute to the girl who defied the capitol? 

the full impact of what i've done hits me. it was not intentionalâ€”i only meant to express 
my thanks â€” but i have elicited something dangerous. an act of dissent from the people of

â€œwell,  you  overestimated  me.  because  i  really  screwed  up  today.  what  do  you  think  is 
going  to  happen  to  rue's  and  thresh's  families?  do  you  think  they'll  get  their  share  of  our

â€œthat's true. but remember, until they changed the rules, i could only hope to get one of

when i open my eyes, it's early afternoon. my head rests on peeta's arm. i don't remember 

him coming in last night. i turn, being careful not to disturb him, but he's already awake. 

â€œno nightmares,â€ he says. 

â€œwhat?â€ i ask. 

â€œyou didn't have any nightmares last night,â€ he says. 

he's right. for the first time in ages i've slept through the night. â€œi had a dream, though,â€ i 
say, thinking back. â€œi was following a mockingjay through the woods. for a long time. it was 
rue, really. i mean, when it sang, it had her voice.â€ 

â€œwhere did she take you?â€ he says, brushing my hair off my forehead. 

â€œi don't know. we never arrived,â€ i say. â€œbut i felt happy.â€

capitol.  the  rebels  caught  on  and  turned  them  against  the  capitol  by  sending  them  home 
loaded with  lies.  when this was discovered, the  jabberjays were  left to die. in a  few  years, 
they  became  extinct  in  the  wild,  but  not  before  they  had  mated  with  female  mockingbirds, 
creating an entirely new species. 

â€œbut mockingjays were never a weapon,â€ said madge. â€œthey're just songbirds. right?â€ 

â€œyeah,  i  guess  so,â€  i  said.  but  it's  not  true.  a  mockingbird  is  just  a  songbird.  a 
mockingjay  is  a  creature  the  capitol  never  intended  to  exist.  they  hadn't  counted  on  the 
highly controlled jabberjay having the brains to adapt to the wild, to pass on its genetic code, 
to thrive in a new form. they hadn't anticipated its will to live. 

now, as i trudge through the snow, i see the mockingjays  hopping about on branches as 
they pick up on other birds' melodies, replicate them, and then transform them into something

where i followed her in mockingjay form. i wish i could have stayed asleep just a bit longer 
and found out where she was trying to take me. 

it's a hike to the lake, no question. if he decides to follow me at all, gale's going to be put

after a couple of hours, i reach an old house near the edge of the lake. maybe â€œhouseâ€ is 
too big a word for it. it's only one room, about twelve feet square. my father thought that a 
long time  ago there were a  lot of buildings â€”  you can still see some of the  foundations  â€”

feel  the  welt  rising  up,  the  swelling  closing  my  eye.  the  stones  beneath  me  are  wet  with 
gale's blood, the air heavy with its scent. â€œstop it! you'll kill him!â€ i shriek. 

i  get  a  glimpse  of  my  assailant's  face.  hard,  with  deep  lines,  a  cruel  mouth.  gray  hair 
shaved  almost  to  nonexistence,  eyes  so  black  they  seem  all  pupils,  a  long,  straight  nose 
reddened by the freezing air. the powerful arm lifts again, his sights set on me. my hand flies 
to my shoulder, hungry for an arrow, but, of course, my weapons are stashed in the woods. i

and  then  it  hits  me.  they  already  have.  they  have  killed  her  father  in  those  wretched 
mines. they  have sat  by as she almost starved to death. they  have chosen  her as a tribute, 
then made her watch her sister fight to the death in the games. she has been hurt far worse

i shove off the blanket and suck in the cold air that seeps through the windowpanes. 

prim ... rue ... aren't they the  very reason i  have to try to fight? because what has  been 
done to them is so wrong, so beyond justification, so evil that there is no choice? because no 
one has the right to treat them as they have been treated? 

yes.  this  is  the  thing  to  remember  when  fear  threatens  to  swallow  me  up.  what  i  am 
about to do, whatever any of us are forced to endu

district 11. not too late for rory and vick and posy. not too late for prim. 

gale is right. if people have the courage, this could be an opportunity. he's also right that, 
since i have set it in motion, i could do so much. although i have no idea what exactly that 
should be. but deciding not to run away is a crucial first step.

twill  but  cross  over  and  place  the  other  on  bonnie's  lap  since  her  hand-eye  coordination 
seems a little questionable at the moment and i don't want the thing ending up in the fire. 

â€œoh,â€ says bonnie. â€œoh, is this all for me?â€ 

something inside me twists as i remember another voice. rue. in the arena. when i gave 
her the leg of groosling. â€œoh, i've never had a whole leg to myself before.â€ the disbelief of 
the chronically hungry. 

â€œyeah, eat up,â€ i say. bonnie holds the bun as if she can't quite believe it's real and then 
sinks her teeth into it again and again, unable to stop. â€œit's better if you chew it.â€ she nods, 
trying to slow down, but  i know how hard it is when  you're that hollow. â€œi think  your tea's

nuclear development.â€ 

â€œthey  were  graphite  miners,â€  i  say.  but then  i  hesitate,  because  that's  information  i  got 

from the capitol. 

â€œthey  had  a  few  small  mines,  yes.  but  not  enough  to  justify  a  population  of  that  size. 

that, i guess, is the only thing we know for sure,â€ says twill. 

my  heart's  beating  too  quickly.  what  if  they're  right?  could  it  be  true?  could  there  be 
somewhere to run besides the wilderness? somewhere safe? if a community exists in district 
13, would it be better to go there, where i might be able to accomplish something, instead of 
waiting  here  for  my  death?  but  then  ...  if  there  are  people  in  district  13,  with  powerful 
weapons ...

everyone  feels  less  vulnerable  once  winter  passes.  peeta's  not  home.  i  guess  he's  already 
gone into town. i'm surprised to see haymitch moving around his kitchen so early, though. i 
walk into his house without knocking. i can hear hazelle upstairs, sweeping the floors of the 
now-spotless  house.  haymitch  isn't  flat-out  drunk,  but  he  doesn't  look  too  steady,  either.  i 
guess the rumors about ripper being back in business are true. i'm thinking maybe i better let 
him just go to bed, when he suggests a walk to town. 

haymitch and i can speak in a kind of shorthand now. in a few minutes i've updated him 
and  he's told  me about rumors of uprisings  in districts 7 and 11 as well. if  my  hunches are 
right, this would mean almost half the districts have at least attempted to rebel. 

â€œdo you still think it won't work here?â€ i ask. 

â€œnot yet. those other districts, they're much larger. even if half the people cower

â€œi came for a drink,â€ i say. 

haymitch bursts out laughing and slams the bottle on the table before me. i run my sleeve 
across the top and take a couple gulps  before i come up choking. it takes a  few  minutes to 
compose  myself,  and  even  then  my  eyes  and  nose  are  still  streaming.  but  inside  me,  the 
liquor feels like fire and i like it. 

â€œmaybe  it  should  be  you,â€  i  say  matter-of-factly  as  i  pull  up  a  chair.  â€œyou  hate  life, 

anyway.â€ 

â€œvery true,â€ says haymitch. â€œand since last time i tried to keep you alive... seems like i'm 

obligated to save the boy this time.â€ 

â€œthat's another good point,â€ i say, wiping my nose and tipping up the bottle again. 

â€œpeeta's argument is that since i chose you, i now owe him. anything he wants. and what 

he wants is the chance to go in again to protect you,â€ says haymitch. 

i knew  it. in this way, peeta's  not hard to predict. while i was wallowing around on the 
floor of that cellar,

circumstances, i guess i deserve one day of indulgence. i'm glad the cameras weren't here for 
it, though. 

downstairs,  my  mother  and  prim  embrace  me  again,  but  they're  not overly  emotional.  i 
know they're  holding things  in to  make  it easier  on  me.  looking at prim's  face,  it's  hard to 
imagine  she's  the  same  frail  little  girl  i  left  behind  on  reaping  day  nine  months  ago.  the 
combination of that ordeal and all that has followedâ€”the cruelty in the district, the parade of 
sick and wounded that she often treats by  herself now  if  my  mother's  hands are too full  â€” 
these  things  have  aged  her  years.  she's  grown  quite  a  bit,  too;  we're  practically  the  same 
height now, but that isn't what makes her seem so much older. 

my  mother  ladles  out  a  mug  of  broth  for  me,  and  i  ask  for  a  second  mug  to  take  to 
haymitch. then i walk across the lawn to his house. he's only just waking up and accepts the

stolen that as well. 

â€œwe'll write letters, katniss,â€ says peeta from behind me. â€œit will be better, anyway. give 
them  a  piece  of  us  to  hold  on  to.  haymitch  will  deliver  them  for  us  if  ...  they  need  to  be 
delivered.â€ 

i nod and go straight to my room. i sit on the bed, knowing i will never write those letters. 
they will be like the speech i tried to write to honor rue and thresh in district 11. things 
seemed clear in my head and even when i talked before the crowd, but the words never came 
out of the pen right. besides, they were meant to go with embraces and kisses and a stroke of 
prim's hair, a caress of gale's face, a squeeze of madge's hand. they cannot be delivered with 
a wooden box containing my cold, stiff body. 

too  heartsick  to  cry,  all  i  want  is  to  curl  up  on  the  bed  and  sleep  until  we  arrive  in  the

when it flies back out and right into his hand, he starts laughing. 

that's when we hear maysilee begin to scream. the alliance is over and she broke it off, 
so no one could blame him for ignoring her. but haymitch runs for her, anyway. he arrives 

only in time to watch the last of a flock of candy pink birds, equipped with long, thin beaks, 
skewer her through the neck. he holds her  hand while she dies, and all i can think of is rue 
and how i was too late to save her, too. 

later that day, another tribute is killed in combat and a third gets eaten by a pack of those 
fluffy squirrels, leaving haymitch and a girl from district 1 to vie for the crown. she's bigger 
than he is and just as fast, and when the inevitable fight comes, it's bloody and awful and both 
have  received  what  could  well  be  fatal  wounds,  when  haymitch  is  finally  disarmed.  he

mine. â€œwhat about you, girl on fire? do you have any secrets worth my time?â€ 

for some stupid reason, i blush, but i force myself to hold my ground. â€œno, i'm an open 

book,â€ i whisper back. â€œeverybody seems to know my secrets before i know them myself.â€

you.â€ he tosses another sugar cube in his mouth and saunters off. 

peeta's beside me, dressed in an outfit identical to mine. â€œwhat did finnick odair want?â€ 

he asks.

the woman, seeder, looks almost like she could be from the seam, with her olive skin and 
straight black hair streaked with silver. only her golden brown eyes mark her as from another 
district. she must be around sixty, but she still looks strong, and there's no sign she's turned to 
liquor or morphling or any other chemical form of escape over the years. before either of us 
says  a  word,  she  embraces  me.  i  know  somehow  it  must  be  because  of  rue  and  thresh. 
before i can stop myself, i whisper, â€œthe families?â€ 

â€œthey're alive,â€ she says back softly before letting me go. 

chaff throws his good arm around me and gives me a big kiss right on the mouth. i jerk 

back, startled, while he and haymitch guffaw. 

that's  about  all  the  time  we  get  before  the  capitol  attendants  are  firmly  directing  us 
toward the  elevators. i  get the  distinct  feeling  they're  not  comfortable  with  the  camaraderie

as  soon  as  it's  over,  i  stand  up  and  thank  cinna  and  portia  for  their  amazing  work  and 
head  off  to  bed.  effie  calls  a  reminder  to  meet  early  for  breakfast  to  work out our training 
strategy, but even  her voice sounds  hollow. poor effie. she  finally  had a decent year  in the 
games with peeta and me, and now it's all broken down into a mess that even she can't put a 
positive spin on. in capitol terms, i'm guessing this counts as a true tragedy. 

soon after i go to bed, there's a quiet knock on my door, but i ignore it. i don't want peeta 
tonight. especially not with darius around. it's almost as bad as if gale were here. gale. how 
am i supposed to let him go with darius haunting the hallways? 

tongues  figure  prominently  in  my  nightmares.  first  i  watch  frozen  and  helpless  while 
gloved  hands  carry  out the  bloody  dissection  in  darius's  mouth.  then  i'm  at  a  party  where 
everyone wears  masks and  so

ou like. i'd suggest chaff and seeder. although finnick's not to be ignored,â€ says haymitch. 
â€œfind someone to team up with who might be of some use to you. remember, you're not in a 
ring  full of trembling children  anymore. these people  are all experienced killers,  no  matter 
what shape they appear to be in.â€ 

maybe he's right. only who could i trust? seeder maybe. but do  i really want to make a 
pact with her, only to possibly have to kill her later? no. still, i made a pact with rue under 
the same circumstances. i tell haymitch i'll try, even though i think i'll  be pretty  bad at the 
whole thing. 

effie shows up a bit early to take us down because last year, even though we were on time, 
we were the last two tributes to show up. but haymitch tells her he doesn't want her taking us 
down to the gym. none of the other victors will be showing up with a babysitter, and being 
the youngest, it's even more important we look self-reliant. so she has to satisfy herself with

we sit in silence awhile and then i blurt out the thing that's on both our minds. â€œhow are 

we going to kill these people, peeta?â€ 

â€œi don't know.â€ he leans his forehead down on our entwined hands. 

â€œi don't want them as allies. why did haymitch want us to get to know them?â€ i say. â€œit'll 
make  it  so  much  harder  than  last  time.  except  for  rue  maybe.  but  i  guess  i  never  really 
couldâ€™ve killed her, anyway. she was just too much like prim.â€ 

peeta  looks  up  at  me,  his  brow  creased  in  thought.  â€œher  death  was  the  most  despicable, 

wasn't it?â€ 

â€œnone of them were very pretty,â€ i say, thinking of glimmer's and cato's ends.

forty minutes before i'm called. 

when i go in, i smell the sharp odor of cleaner and

upset them? 

i feel a pang of worry. that isn't good. i don't want peeta singling himself out as a target 
for the gamemakers' anger. that's part of my job. to draw fire away from peeta. but how did 
he upset them? because i'd love to do just that and more. to break through the smug veneer 
of those who use their brains to find amusing ways to kill us. to make them realize that while 
we're vulnerable to the capitol's cruelties, they are as well. 

do you have any idea how much i hate you? i think. you, who have given your talents to 

the games? 

i try to catch plutarch heavensbee's eye, but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as 
he has the entire training period. i remember how he sought me out for a dance, how pleased 
he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. his friendly manner has no place here. how 
could it, when i'm a mere tribute and he's the head gamemaker? so powerful, so removed, so

â€œwhy would he paint a picture of me, effie?â€ i ask, somehow annoyed. 

â€œto show he's going to do everything  he can to defend  you. that's what everyone  in the 
capitol's expecting, anyway. didn't he volunteer to go in with you?â€ effie says, as if it's the 
most obvious thing in the world. 

â€œactually,  i  painted  a  picture  of  rue,â€  peeta  says.  â€œhow  she  looked  after  katniss  had 

covered her in flowers.â€ 

there's a long pause at the table while everyone absorbs this. â€œand what exactly were you 

trying to accomplish?â€ haymitch asks in a very measured voice. 

â€œi'm not sure. i just wanted to hold them accountable, if only for a moment,â€ says peeta. 

â€œfor killing that little girl.â€

she thinks of how much the people in the capitol must be suffering because they will lose us. 
gloss recalls the kindness shown here to him and his sister. beetee questions the legality of 
the  quell  in  his  nervous,  twitchy  way,  wondering  if  it's  been  fully  examined  by  experts  of

people faint because they're sure he means them. by the time johanna mason gets up, she's 
asking if something can't be done about the situation. surely the creators of the quarter quell 
never anticipated such love forming between the victors and the capitol. no one could be so 

cruel as to sever such a deep bond. seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district 11, 
everyone  assumes  president  snow  is  all-powerful.  so  if  he's  all-powerfu

the  victors  themselves  have  been  building.  hoping  someone  would  be  able  to  detonate  it. 
perhaps  thinking  it  would  be  me  in  my  bridal  gown.  not  knowing  how  much  i  rely  on 
cinna's talents, whereas peeta needs nothing more than his wits. 

as the bomb explodes,  it sends accusations of  injustice and  barbarism and cruelty  flying

there can't ignore, at least for a moment, how horrific the whole thing is.

moaning, shrieking, calling for help. and me? i know my face is projected in a tight close-up

it? if i hadn't spent my life building up layers of defenses until i recoil at even the suggestion 
of marriage or a family? 

caesar  can't  rein  in  the  crowd  again,  not  even  when  the  buzzer  sounds.  peeta  nods  his 
good-bye and comes back to his seat without any more conversation. i can see caesar's lips 
moving, but the place is in total chaos and i can't hear a word. only the blast of the anthem, 
cranked up so loud i can feel it vibrating through my bones, lets u

close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast. 

and  then  it  happens.  up  and  down  the  row, the  victors  begin  to  join  hands.  some  right

of those around them, like brutus and enobaria. by the time the anthem plays its final strains,

i  feel  him  lurch  forward  and  realize  finnick  has  come  back  for  us  and  is  hauling  peeta 
along. i wedge  my  shoulder, which  still  seems under  my control, under peeta's arm and do 

my best to keep up with finnickâ€™s rapid pace. we put about ten yards between us and the fog 
when finnick stops. 

â€œitâ€™s no good. i'll have to carry him. can you take mags?â€ he asks me. 

â€œyes,â€  i  say  stoutly,  although  my  heart  sinks.  it's  true  that  mags  can't  weigh  more  than 
about seventy pounds, but i'm not very big myself. still, i'm sure i've carried heavier loads. if 
only  my  arms  would  stop  jumping  around.  i  squat  down  and  she  positions  herself  over  my 
shoulder,  the  way  she  rides  on  finnick.  i  slowly  straighten  my  legs  and,  with  my  knees 
locked, i can manage her. finnick has peeta slung across his back now and we move forward, 
finnick leading, me following in the trail he breaks through th

them  both? go on ahead, i'll catch up.â€  a somewhat doubtful proposal, but i say  it with as 
much surety as i can muster. 

i can see  finnick's eyes, green  in the  moonlight. i can see them  as clear as day.  almost 
like a cat's, with a strange reflective quality. maybe because they are shiny with tears. â€œno,â€ 
he  says.  â€œi  can't  carry  them  both.  my  arms  aren't  working.â€  it's  true.  his  arms  jerk 
uncontrollably at his sides. his hands are empty. of his three tridents, only one remains, and 
it's in peeta's hands. â€œi'm sorry, mags. i can't do it.â€ 

what happens next is so fast, so senseless, i can't even move to stop it. mags hauls herself 
up,  plants  a  kiss  on  finnick's  lips,  and  then  hobbles  straight  into the  fog.  immediately,  her 
body is seized by wild contortions and she falls to the ground in a horrible dance. 

i want to scream, but my throat

whether  it  moves  from  the  poison  that  affected  our  nerves,  the  shock  of  the  attack,  or 
withdrawal from the drug that was her sustenance. there is nothing we can do. nothing but 
stay with her while she dies. 

â€œi'll watch the trees,â€ finnick says before walking away. i'd like to walk away, too, but she 
grips my hand so tightly i would have to pry off her fingers, and i don't have the strength for 
that kind of cruelty. i think of rue, how maybe i could sing a song or something. but i don't 
even know the morphling's name, let alone if she likes songs. i just know she's dying. 

peeta  crouches  down  on  the  other  side  of  her  and  strokes  her  hair.  when  he  begins  to 
speak  in  a  soft  voice,  it  seems  almost  nonsensical,  but  the  words  aren't  for  me.  â€œwith  my

â€œwhat's it do, die?â€ asks johanna. 

â€œit stops singing first. that's when you should get out. but if the air's too bad, it dies, yes.

prim. then your mother. your cousin, gale. madge,â€ he continues. â€œit was a trick, 
katniss. a horrible one. but we're the only ones who can be hurt by it. we're the ones in the 
games. not them.â€ 

â€œyou really believe that?â€ i say. 

â€œi  really  do,â€  says  peeta.  i  waver,  thinking  of  how  peeta  can  make  anyone  believe 

anything. i look over at finnick for confirmation, see he's fixated on peeta, his words. 

â€œdo you believe it, finnick?â€ i ask. 

â€œit  could  be  true.  i  don't  know,â€  he  says.  â€œcould  they  do  that,  beetee?  take  someone's 

regular voice and make it ...â€ 

â€œoh,  yes.  it's  not  even  that  difficult,  finnick.  our  children  learn  a  similar  technique  in 

school,â€ says beetee. 

â€œof  course  peeta's  right.  the  whole  country  adores  katniss's  little  sister.  if  they  really 
killed  her  like  this,  they'd  probably  have  an  uprising  on  their  hands,â€  says  johanna  flat ly.

 hands  before  he  sets  it  in  a  neat 
configuration.  i  don't  know  what  it  is  with  finnick  and  bread,  but  he  seems  obsessed  with 
handling it. â€œtwenty-four,â€ he says. 

â€œan even two dozen, then?â€ says beetee. 

â€œtwenty-four on the nose,â€ says finnick. â€œhow should we divide them?â€ 

â€œlet's each have three, and whoever is still alive at breakfast can take a vote on the rest,â€ 
says johanna. i don't know why this makes me laugh a little. i guess because it's true. when i 
do, johanna gives me a look that's almost approving. no, not approving. but maybe slightly 
pleased. 

we wait until the giant wave has flooded out of the ten-to-eleven-o'clock section, wait for 
the water to recede, and then go to that beach to make camp. theoretically, we should have a 
full twelve hours of safety from the jungle. there's an unpleasant chorus of clicking, probably 
from  some  evil  type  of  insect,  coming  from  the  eleven-to-twelve-o'clock  wedge.  but

everything. that's what peeta wants me to take from him. 

i wait for him to mention the baby, to play to the cameras, but he doesn't. and that's how i 
know  that  none  of  this  is  part  of  the  games.  that  he  is  telling  me  the  truth  about  what  he 
feels. 

â€œno one really needs me,â€ he says, and there's no self-pity in his voice. it's true his family 
doesn't  need  him.  they  will  mourn  him,  as  will  a  handful  of  friends.  but they  will  get  on. 
even haymitch, with the help of a lot of white liquor, will get on. i realize only one person 
will be damaged beyond repair if peeta dies. me. 

â€œi  do,â€  i  say.  â€œi  need  you.â€  he  looks  upset,  takes  a  deep  breath  as  if  to  begin  a  long 
argument, and that's no good, no good at all, because he'll start going on about prim and my 
mother and everything an

e manipulated. 

but as i stretch out on the sand i wonder, could it be more? like a reminder to me that i 
could still one day have kids with gale? well, if that was it, it was a mistake. because for one 
thing, that's never been part of my plan. 

and for another, if only one of us can be a parent, anyone can see it should be peeta. 

as  i  drift  off,  i  try  to  imagine  that  world,  somewhere  in  the  future,  with  no  games,  no 
capitol. a place like the meadow in the song i sang to rue as she died. where peeta's child 
could be safe. 

 

 

 

when  i  wake,  i  have  a  brief,  delicious  feeling  of  happiness  that  is  somehow  connected 
with peeta. happiness, of course, is a complete absurdity at this point, since at the rate things 
are going, i'll be dead in a day. and that's the best-case scenario, if i'm able to eliminate the 
rest of the field, including myself, and get peeta crowned as the winner of the quarter quell.

on but as an avox or something, waiting on the  future tributes of district 
12. then maybe he could find some way to escape. my death could, in fact, still save him. 

if it can't, no matter. it's enough to die of spite. to punish haymitch, who, of all the people 
in this rotting world, has turned peeta and me into pieces in his games. i trusted him. i put 
what was precious in haymitch's hands. and he has betrayed me. 

â€œsee, this is why no one lets you make the plans,â€ he said. 

that's true. no one in their right mind would let me make the plans. because i obviously 

can't tell a friend from an enemy. 

a lot of people come by to talk to me, but i make all their words sound like the clicking of 
the  insects  in  the  jungle.  meaningless  and  distant.  dangerous,  but  only  if  approached. 
whenever the words start to become distinct, i moan until they give me more painkiller and 
that fixes things right up. 

until one time, i open my eyes and find someone i cannot block out
