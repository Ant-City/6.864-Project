 sentence--had there been a chance of any one of its savage
details being spared--by just so much would he have lost in his
fascination. the form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled,
was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered
and torn asunder, yielded the sensation. whatever gloss the various
spectators put upon the interest, according to their several arts and
powers of self-deceit, the interest was, at the root of it, ogreish.

silence in the court! charles darnay had yesterday pleaded not guilty to
an indictment denouncing him (with infinite jingle and jangle) for that
he was a false traitor to our serene, illustrious, excellent, and so
forth, prince, our lord the king, by reason of his having, on divers
occasions, and by divers means and ways, assisted lewis, the french
king, in his wars against our said serene, illustrious, excellent, and
so forth; that was to say, by coming and going, between the dominions of
our said serene, illustrious, exce

said french lewis, and wickedly, falsely, traitorously, and otherwise
evil-adverbiously, revealing to the said french lewis what forces our
said serene, illustrious, excellent, and so forth, had in preparation
to send to canada and north america. this much, jerry, with his head
becoming more and more spiky as the law terms bristled it, made out with
huge satisfaction, and so arrived circuitously at the understanding that
the aforesaid, and over and over again aforesaid, charles darnay, stood
there before him upon his trial; that the jury were swearing in; and
that mr. attorney-general was making ready to speak.

the accused, who was (and who knew he was) being mentally hanged,
beheaded, and quartered, by everybody there, neither flinched from
the situation, nor assumed any theatrical air in it. he was quiet and
attentive; watched the opening proceedings with a grave interest;
and stood with his hands resting on the slab of wood before him, so
composedly, that they h

from the dimly-lighted passages of the court, the last sediment of the
human stew that had been boiling there all day, was straining off, when
doctor manette, lucie manette, his daughter, mr. lorry, the solicitor
for the defence, and its counsel, mr. stryver, stood gathered round mr.
charles darnay--just released--congratulating him on his escape from
death.

it would have been difficult by a far brighter light, to recognise
in doctor manette, intellectual of face and upright of bearing, the
shoemaker of the garret in paris. yet, no one could have looked at him
twice, without looking again: even though the opportunity of observation
had not extended to the mournful cadence of his low grave voice, and
to the abstraction that overclouded him fitfully, without any apparent
reason. w

perhaps a little angry with himself, as well as with the barrister, mr.
lorry bustled into the chair, and was carried off to tellsonâ€™s. carton,
who smelt of port wine, and did not appear to be quite sober, laughed
then, and turned to darnay:

â€œthis is a strange chance that throws you and me together. this must
be a strange night to you, standing alone here with your counterpart on
these street stones?â€

â€œi hardly seem yet,â€ returned charles darnay, â€œto belong to this world
again.â€

â€œi donâ€™t wonder at it; itâ€™s not so long since you were pretty far
advanced on your way to another. you speak faintly.â€

â€œi begin to think i _am_ faint.â€

â€œthen why the devil donâ€™t you dine? i dined, myself, while those
numskulls were deliberating which world you should belong to--this, or
some other. let me show you the nearest tavern to dine well at.â€

treet, and so, up a covered way, into a tavern. here, they were
shown into a little room, where charles darnay was soon recruiting
his strength with a good plain dinner and good wine: while carton sat
opposite to him at the same table, with his separate bottle of port
before him, and his fully half-insolent manner upon him.

â€œdo you feel, yet, that you belong to this terrestrial scheme again, mr.
darnay?â€

â€œi am frightfully confused regarding time and place; but i am so far
mended as to feel that.â€

â€œit must be an immense satisfaction!â€

confused by the emotion of the day, and feeling his being there with
this double of coarse deportment, to be like a dream, charles darnay was
at a loss how to answer; finally, answered not at all.

â€œnow your dinner is done,â€ carton presently said, â€œwhy donâ€™t you call a
health, mr. darnay; why donâ€™t you give your toast?â€

â€œwhat health? what toast?â€

â€œwhy, itâ€™s on the tip of your tongue. it ought to be, it must be, iâ€™ll

â€œnevertheless,â€ pursued darnay, rising to ring the bell, â€œthere is
nothing in that, i hope, to prevent my calling the reckoning, and our
parting without ill-blood on either side.â€

carton rejoining, â€œnothing in life!â€ darnay rang. â€œdo you call the whole
reckoning?â€ said carton. on his answering in the affirmative, â€œthen
bring me another pint of this same wine, drawer, and come and wake me at
ten.â€

the bill being paid, charles darnay rose and wished him good night.
without returning the wish, carton rose too, with something of a threat
of defiance in his manner, and said, â€œa last word, mr. darnay: you think
i am drunk?â€

â€œi think you have been drinking, mr. carton.â€

â€œno, my dear, not ill. there are large drops of rain falling, and they

he recovered himself almost instantly. rain was really falling in large
drops, and he showed the back of his hand with rain-drops on it. but, he
said not a single word in reference to the discovery that had been told
of, and, as they went into the house, the business eye of mr. lorry
either detected, or fancied it detected, on his face, as it turned
towards charles darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house.

he recovered himself so quickly, however, that mr. lorry had doubts of
his business eye. the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him.

it was the nephew of monseigneur. he had been some few leagues behind
monseigneur, early in the afternoon. he had diminished the distance
rapidly, but not so rapidly as to come up with monseigneur on the road.
he had heard of monseigneur, at the posting-houses, as being before him.

he was to be told (said monseigneur) that supper awaited him then and
there, and that he was prayed to come to it. in a little while he came.
he had been known in england as charles darnay.

monseigneur received him in a courtly manner, but they did not shake
hands.

â€œyou left paris yesterday, sir?â€ he said to monseigneur, as he took his
seat at table.

 best of it. in this, his prosperity consisted.

a certain portion of his time was passed at cambridge, where he
read with undergraduates as a sort of tolerated smuggler who drove a
contraband trade in european languages, instead of conveying greek
and latin through the custom-house. the rest of his time he passed in
london.

now, from the days when it was always summer in eden, to these days
when it is mostly winter in fallen latitudes, the world of a man has
invariably gone one way--charles darnayâ€™s way--the way of the love of a
woman.

he had loved lucie manette from the hour of his danger. he had never
heard a sound so sweet and dear as the sound of her compassionate voice;
he had never seen a face so tenderly beautiful, as hers when it was
confronted with his own on the edge of the grave that had been dug for
him. but, he had not yet spoken to her on the subject; the assassination
at the deserted chateau far away beyond the heaving water and the long,
long, dusty roads--the

radually restored to him. he was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. in his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been
frequently observable, and had grown more and more rare.

he studied much, slept little, sustained a great deal of fatigue with
ease, and was equably cheerful. to him, now entered charles darnay, at
sight of whom he laid aside his book and held out his hand.

â€œcharles darnay! i rejoice to see you. we have been counting on your
return these three or four days past. mr. stryver and sydney carton were
both here yesterday, and both made you out to be more than due.â€

â€œi am obliged to them for their interest in the matter,â€ he answered,
a little coldly as to them, though very warmly as to the doctor. â€œmiss
manette--â€

â€œis well,â€ said the doctor, as he stopped shor

â€œi have had the happiness, doctor manette, of being so intimate here,â€
 so he at length began, â€œfor some year and a half, that i hope the topic
on which i am about to touch may not--â€

he was stayed by the doctorâ€™s putting out his hand to stop him. when he
had kept it so a little while, he said, drawing it back:

â€œis lucie the topic?â€

â€œshe is.â€

â€œit is hard for me to speak of her at any time. it is very hard for me
to hear her spoken of in that tone of yours, charles darnay.â€

â€œit is a tone of fervent admiration, true homage, and deep love, doctor
manette!â€ he said deferentially.

there was another blank silence before her father rejoined:

â€œi believe it. i do you justice; i believe it.â€

his constraint was so manifest, and it was so manifest, too, that it
originated in an unwillingness to approach the subject, that charles
darnay hesitated.

â€œshall i go on, sir?â€

another blank.

â€œyes, go on.â€

â€œyou anticipate what i would s

come in aid of it, and bind her closer to you, if such a thing can be.â€

his touch still lingered on her fatherâ€™s hand. answering the touch for a
moment, but not coldly, her father rested his hands upon the arms of
his chair, and looked up for the first time since the beginning of the
conference. a struggle was evidently in his face; a struggle with that
occasional look which had a tendency in it to dark doubt and dread.

â€œyou speak so feelingly and so manfully, charles darnay, that i thank
you with all my heart, and will open all my heart--or nearly so. have
you any reason to believe that lucie loves you?â€

â€œnone. as yet, none.â€

â€œis it the immediate object of this confidence, that you may at once
ascertain that, with my knowledge?â€

â€œnot even so. i might not have the hopefulness to do it for weeks; i
might (mistaken or not mistaken) have that hopefulness to-morrow.â€

â€œdo you seek any guidance from me?â€

â€œi ask none, sir. but i have

n her
innocent heart--do not think i have the presumption to assume so much--i
could retain no place in it against her love for her father.â€

â€œif that be so, do you see what, on the other hand, is involved in it?â€

â€œi understand equally well, that a word from her father in any suitorâ€™s
favour, would outweigh herself and all the world. for which reason,
doctor manette,â€ said darnay, modestly but firmly, â€œi would not ask that
word, to save my life.â€

â€œi am sure of it. charles darnay, mysteries arise out of close love, as
well as out of wide division; in the former case, they are subtle and
delicate, and difficult to penetrate. my daughter lucie is, in this one
respect, such a mystery to me; i can make no guess at the state of her
heart.â€

â€œmay i ask, sir, if you think she is--â€ as he hesitated, her father
supplied the rest.

â€œis sought by any other suitor?â€

â€œit is what i meant to say.â€

her father considered a little before he answered:

 the
condition on which i ask it, and which you have an undoubted right to
require, i will observe immediately.â€

â€œi give the promise,â€ said the doctor, â€œwithout any condition. i believe
your object to be, purely and truthfully, as you have stated it. i
believe your intention is to perpetuate, and not to weaken, the ties
between me and my other and far dearer self. if she should ever tell me
that you are essential to her perfect happiness, i will give her to you.
if there were--charles darnay, if there were--â€

the young man had taken his hand gratefully; their hands were joined as
the doctor spoke:

â€œ--any fancies, any reasons, any apprehensions, anything whatsoever,
new or old, against the man she really loved--the direct responsibility
thereof not lying on his head--they should all be obliterated for her
sake. she is everything to me; more to me than suffering, more to me
than wrong, more to me--well! this is idle talk.â€

so strange was the way in which he faded

secret from you.â€

â€œstop!â€

for an instant, the doctor even had his two hands at his ears; for
another instant, even had his two hands laid on darnayâ€™s lips.

â€œtell me when i ask you, not now. if your suit should prosper, if lucie
should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. do you
promise?â€

â€œwillingly.

â€œgive me your hand. she will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. go! god bless you!â€

it was dark when charles darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
darker when lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
miss pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
reading-chair empty.

â€œmy father!â€ she called to him. â€œfather dear!â€

nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom. passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
blood all chilled, â€œ

 a laugh. after sipping his cognac to the
end, he added:

â€œyes, miss manette is going to be married. but not to an englishman; to
one who, like herself, is french by birth. and speaking of gaspard (ah,
poor gaspard! it was cruel, cruel!), it is a curious thing that she is
going to marry the nephew of monsieur the marquis, for whom gaspard
was exalted to that height of so many feet; in other words, the present
marquis. but he lives unknown in england, he is no marquis there; he is
mr. charles darnay. dâ€™aulnais is the name of his motherâ€™s family.â€

madame defarge knitted steadily, but the intelligence had a palpable
effect upon her husband. do what he would, behind the little counter,
as to the striking of a light and the lighting of his pipe, he was
troubled, and his hand was not trustworthy. the spy would have been no

but, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the
shrewd glance of mr. lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the
old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold
wind.

he gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot
which mr. lorry had hired in honour of the day. the rest followed in
another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange
eyes looked on, charles darnay and lucie manette were happily married.

besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little
group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling,
glanced on the brideâ€™s hand, which were newly released from the
dark obscurity of one of mr. lorryâ€™s pockets. they returned home to

xx. a plea


when the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was sydney carton. they had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself. he was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to the observation of charles darnay.

he watched his opportunity of taking darnay aside into a window, and of
speaking to him when no one overheard.

â€œmr. darnay,â€ said carton, â€œi wish we might be friends.â€

â€œwe are already friends, i hope.â€

â€œyou are good enough to say so, as a fashion of speech; but, i donâ€™t
mean any fashion of speech. indeed, when i say i wish we might be
friends, i scarcely mean quite that, either.â€

charles darnay--as was natural--asked him, in all good-humour and
good-fellows

dare say, to know that i had it.â€

â€œwill you try?â€

â€œthat is another way of saying that i am placed on the footing i have
indicated. i thank you, darnay. i may use that freedom with your name?â€

â€œi think so, carton, by this time.â€

they shook hands upon it, and sydney turned away. within a minute
afterwards, he was, to all outward appearance, as unsubstantial as ever.

when he was gone, and in the course of an evening passed with miss
pross, the doctor, and mr. lorry, charles darnay made some mention of
this conversation in general terms, and spoke of sydney carton as a
problem of carelessness and recklessness. he spoke of him, in short, not
bitterly or meaning to bear hard upon him, but as anybody might who saw
him as he showed himself.

he had no idea that this could dwell in the thoughts of his fair young
wife; but, when he afterwards joined her in their own rooms, he found
her waiting for him with the old pretty lifting of the forehead strongly
marked.

â€œthat is what you are not to ask me. but i think--i know--he does.â€

â€œif you know it, it is enough. what would you have me do, my life?â€

â€œi would ask you, dearest, to be very generous with him always, and very
lenient on his faults when he is not by. i would ask you to believe that
he has a heart he very, very seldom reveals, and that there are deep
wounds in it. my dear, i have seen it bleeding.â€

â€œit is a painful reflection to me,â€ said charles darnay, quite
astounded, â€œthat i should have done him any wrong. i never thought this
of him.â€

â€œmy husband, it is so. i fear he is not to be reclaimed; there is
scarcely a hope that anything in his character or fortunes is reparable
now. but, i am sure that he is capable of good things, gentle things,
even magnanimous things.â€

she looked so beautiful in the purity of her faith in this lost man,
that her husband could have looked at her as she was for hours.

vapouring, combined with the extravagant plots of monseigneur for the
restoration of a state of things that had utterly exhausted itself,
and worn out heaven and earth as well as itself, was hard to be endured
without some remonstrance by any sane man who knew the truth. and it was
such vapouring all about his ears, like a troublesome confusion of blood
in his own head, added to a latent uneasiness in his mind, which had
already made charles darnay restless, and which still kept him so.

way to state promotion, and, therefore, loud on the theme: broaching
to monseigneur, his devices for blowing the people up and exterminating
them from the face of the earth, and doing without them: and for
accomplishing many similar objects akin in their nature to the abolition
of eagles by sprinkling salt on the tails of the race. him, darnay heard

on the marriage morning, doctor manette had made it his one urgent and
express request to charles darnay, that the secret of this name should

between them. nobody else knew it to be his name; his own wife had no
suspicion of the fact; mr. lorry could have none.

s own private place there, and earned his own
bread. monsieur gabelle had held the impoverished and involved estate
on written instructions, to spare the people, to give them what little
there was to give--such fuel as the heavy creditors would let them have
in the winter, and such produce as could be saved from the same grip in
the summer--and no doubt he had put the fact in plea and proof, for his
own safety, so that it could not but appear now.

this favoured the desperate resolution charles darnay had begun to make,
that he would go to paris.

yes. like the mariner in the old story, the winds and streams had driven
him within the influence of the loadstone rock, and it was drawing him
to itself, and he must go. everything that arose before his mind drifted
him on, faster and faster, more and more steadily, to the terrible
attraction. his latent uneasiness had been, that bad aims were being
worked out in his own unhappy land by bad instruments, and that he who
could not fail to k

 in his mind, he did not
discuss with himself. but, that circumstance too, had had its influence
in his course.

he walked to and fro, with thoughts very busy, until it was time to
return to tellsonâ€™s and take leave of mr. lorry. as soon as he arrived
in paris he would present himself to this old friend, but he must say
nothing of his intention now.

a carriage with post-horses was ready at the bank door, and jerry was
booted and equipped.

â€œi have delivered that letter,â€ said charles darnay to mr. lorry. â€œi
would not consent to your being charged with any written answer, but
perhaps you will take a verbal one?â€

â€œthat i will, and readily,â€ said mr. lorry, â€œif it is not dangerous.â€

â€œnot at all. though it is to a prisoner in the abbaye.â€

â€œwhat is his name?â€ said mr. lorry, with his open pocket-book in his
hand.

â€œgabelle.â€

â€œgabelle. and what is the message to the unfortunate gabelle in prison?â€

â€œsimply, â€˜that he has received the let

â€œany time mentioned?â€

â€œhe will start upon his journey to-morrow night.â€

â€œany person mentioned?â€

â€œno.â€

he helped mr. lorry to wrap himself in a number of coats and cloaks,
and went out with him from the warm atmosphere of the old bank, into the
misty air of fleet-street. â€œmy love to lucie, and to little lucie,â€ said
mr. lorry at parting, â€œand take precious care of them till i come back.â€
 charles darnay shook his head and doubtfully smiled, as the carriage
rolled away.

that night--it was the fourteenth of august--he sat up late, and wrote
two fervent letters; one was to lucie, explaining the strong obligation
he was under to go to paris, and showing her, at length, the reasons
that he had, for feeling confident that he could become involved in no
personal danger there; the other was to the doctor, confiding lucie and
their dear child to his care, and dwelling on the same topics with t

migrant,â€ said the functionary, â€œi am going to send you on to paris,
under an escort.â€

â€œcitizen, i desire nothing more than to get to paris, though i could
dispense with the escort.â€

â€œsilence!â€ growled a red-cap, striking at the coverlet with the butt-end
of his musket. â€œpeace, aristocrat!â€

â€œit is as the good patriot says,â€ observed the timid functionary. â€œyou
are an aristocrat, and must have an escort--and must pay for it.â€

â€œi have no choice,â€ said charles darnay.

â€œchoice! listen to him!â€ cried the same scowling red-cap. â€œas if it was
not a favour to be protected from the lamp-iron!â€

â€œit is always as the good patriot says,â€ observed the functionary. â€œrise
and dress yourself, emigrant.â€

darnay complied, and was taken back to the guard-house, where other
patriots in rough red caps were smoking, drinking, and sleeping, by
a watch-fire. here he paid a heavy price for his escort, and hence he
started with it on the wet, wet road

they travelled in the night, halting an hour or two after daybreak, and
lying by until the twilight fell. the escort were so wretchedly clothed,
that they twisted straw round their bare legs, and thatched their ragged
shoulders to keep the wet off. apart from the personal discomfort of
being so attended, and apart from such considerations of present danger
as arose from one of the patriots being chronically drunk, and carrying
his musket very recklessly, charles darnay did not allow the restraint
that was laid upon him to awaken any serious fears in his breast; for,
he reasoned with himself that it could have no reference to the merits
of an individual case that was not yet stated, and of representations,
confirmable by the prisoner in the abbaye, that were not yet made.

but when they came to the town of beauvais--which they did at eventide,
when the streets were filled with people--he could not conceal from
himself that the aspect of affairs was ver

daylight at last found them before the wall of paris. the barrier was
closed and strongly guarded when they rode up to it.

â€œwhere are the papers of this prisoner?â€ demanded a resolute-looking man
in authority, who was summoned out by the guard.

naturally struck by the disagreeable word, charles darnay requested the
speaker to take notice that he was a free traveller and french citizen,
in charge of an escort which the disturbed state of the country had
imposed upon him, and which he had paid for.

â€œwhere,â€ repeated the same personage, without taking any heed of him
whatever, â€œare the papers of this prisoner?â€

the drunken patriot had them in his cap, and produced them. casting his
eyes over gabelleâ€™s letter, the same personage in authority showed some
disorder and surpris

 (you know, citizen, even better
than i, of how much importance), that i should be able to communicate to
mr. lorry of tellsonâ€™s bank, an english gentleman who is now in paris,
the simple fact, without comment, that i have been thrown into the
prison of la force. will you cause that to be done for me?â€

â€œi will do,â€ defarge doggedly rejoined, â€œnothing for you. my duty is to
my country and the people. i am the sworn servant of both, against you.
i will do nothing for you.â€

charles darnay felt it hopeless to entreat him further, and his pride
was touched besides. as they walked on in silence, he could not but see
how used the people were to the spectacle of prisoners passing along the
streets. the very children scarcely noticed him. a few passers turned
their heads, and a few shook their fingers at him as an aristocrat;
otherwise, that a man in good clothes should be going to prison, was no
more remarkable than that a labourer in working clothes should be
going to work. i

n one narrow, dark, and dirty street through which they
passed, an excited orator, mounted on a stool, was addressing an excited
audience on the crimes against the people, of the king and the royal
family. the few words that he caught from this manâ€™s lips, first made
it known to charles darnay that the king was in prison, and that the
foreign ambassadors had one and all left paris. on the road (except at
beauvais) he had heard absolutely nothing. the escort and the universal
watchfulness had completely isolated him.

that he had fallen among far greater dangers than those which had
developed themselves when he left england, he of course knew now. that
perils had thickened about him fast, and might thicken faster and faster
yet, he of course knew now. he could not but admit to

ove of liberty;â€ which sounded in that place like an inappropriate
conclusion.

the prison of la force was a gloomy prison, dark and filthy, and with a
horrible smell of foul sleep in it. extraordinary how soon the noisome
flavour of imprisoned sleep, becomes manifest in all such places that
are ill cared for!

â€œin secret, too,â€ grumbled the gaoler, looking at the written paper. â€œas
if i was not already full to bursting!â€

he stuck the paper on a file, in an ill-humour, and charles darnay
awaited his further pleasure for half an hour: sometimes, pacing to and
fro in the strong arched room: sometimes, resting on a stone seat: in
either case detained to be imprinted on the memory of the chief and his
subordinates.

â€œcome!â€ said the chief, at length taking up his keys, â€œcome with me,
emigrant.â€

through the dismal prison twilight, his new charge accompanied him by
corridor and staircase, many doors clanging and locking behind them,

ive association of prisoners with shameful crime and
disgrace, the new-comer recoiled from this company. but the crowning
unreality of his long unreal ride, was, their all at once rising to
receive him, with every refinement of manner known to the time, and with
all the engaging graces and courtesies of life.

so strangely clouded were these refinements by the prison manners and
gloom, so spectral did they become in the inappropriate squalor and
misery through which they were seen, that charles darnay seemed to stand
in a company of the dead. ghosts all! the ghost of beauty, the ghost
of stateliness, the ghost of elegance, the ghost of pride, the ghost of
frivolity, the ghost of wit, the ghost of youth, the ghost of age, all
waiting their dismissal from the desolate shore, all turning on him eyes
that were changed by the death they had died in coming there.

it struck him motionless. the gaoler standing at his side, and the other
gaolers moving about, who would have been well enough

â€œin the name of the assembled companions in misfortune,â€ said a
gentleman of courtly appearance and address, coming forward, â€œi have the
honour of giving you welcome to la force, and of condoling with you
on the calamity that has brought you among us. may it soon terminate
happily! it would be an impertinence elsewhere, but it is not so here,
to ask your name and condition?â€

charles darnay roused himself, and gave the required information, in
words as suitable as he could find.

â€œbut i hope,â€ said the gentleman, following the chief gaoler with his
eyes, who moved across the room, â€œthat you are not in secret?â€

â€œi do not understand the meaning of the term, but i have heard them say
so.â€

â€œah, what a pity! we so much regret it! but take courage; several
members of our society have been in secret, at first, and it has lasted
but a short time.â€ then he adde

there was a murmur of commiseration as charles darnay crossed the room
to a grated door where the gaoler awaited him, and many voices--among
which, the soft and compassionate voices of women were conspicuous--gave
him good wishes and encouragement. he turned at the grated door, to
render the thanks of his heart; it closed under the gaolerâ€™s hand; and
the apparitions vanished from his sight forever.

that, hereupon he had ascertained, through the registers on the table,
that his son-in-law was among the living prisoners, and had pleaded hard
to the tribunal--of whom some members were asleep and some awake, some
dirty with murder and some clean, some sober and some not--for his life
and liberty. that, in the first frantic greetings lavished on himself as
a notable sufferer under the overthrown system, it had been accorded
to him to have charles darnay brought before the lawless court, and
examined. that, he seemed on the point of being at once released, when
the tide in his favour met with some unexplained check (not intelligible
to the doctor), which led to a few words of secret conference. that,
the man sitting as president had then informed doctor manette that
the prisoner must remain in custody, but should, for his sake, be held
inviolate in safe custody. that, immediately, on a signal, the prisoner
was removed to the interior of

preceding relative positions of himself
and lucie were reversed, yet only as the liveliest gratitude and
affection could reverse them, for he could have had no pride but in
rendering some service to her who had rendered so much to him. â€œall
curious to see,â€ thought mr. lorry, in his amiably shrewd way, â€œbut all
natural and right; so, take the lead, my dear friend, and keep it; it
couldnâ€™t be in better hands.â€

but, though the doctor tried hard, and never ceased trying, to get
charles darnay set at liberty, or at least to get him brought to trial,
the public current of the time set too strong and fast for him. the new
era began; the king was tried, doomed, and beheaded; the republic of
liberty, equality, fraternity, or death, declared for victory or death
against the world in arms; the black flag waved night and day from the
great towers of notre dame; three hundred thousand men, summoned to rise
against the tyrants of the earth, rose from all the varying soils
of france, as

 and to die by it, was not mere
boastfulness, but a wild infection of the wildly shaken public mind. in
seasons of pestilence, some of us will have a secret attraction to the
disease--a terrible passing inclination to die of it. and all of us have
like wonders hidden in our breasts, only needing circumstances to evoke
them.

the passage to the conciergerie was short and dark; the night in its
vermin-haunted cells was long and cold. next day, fifteen prisoners were
put to the bar before charles darnayâ€™s name was called. all the fifteen
were condemned, and the trials of the whole occupied an hour and a half.

â€œcharles evremonde, called darnay,â€ was at length arraigned.

his judges sat upon the bench in feathered hats; but the rough red cap
and tricoloured cockade was the head-dress otherwise prevailing. looking
at the jury and the turbulent audience, he might have thought that the
usual order of things was reversed, and that the felons were trying the
honest men. the lowest, cr

this answer had a happy effect upon the audience. cries in exaltation
of the well-known good physician rent the hall. so capriciously were
the people moved, that tears immediately rolled down several ferocious
countenances which had been glaring at the prisoner a moment before, as
if with impatience to pluck him out into the streets and kill him.

on these few steps of his dangerous way, charles darnay had set his foot
according to doctor manetteâ€™s reiterated instructions. the same cautious
counsel directed every step that lay before him, and had prepared every
inch of his road.

the president asked, why had he returned to france when he did, and not
sooner?

he had not returned sooner, he replied, simply because he had no means
of living in france, save those he had resigned; whereas, in england,
he lived by giving instruction in the french language and literature.

two score and twelve were told off. from the farmer-general of seventy,
whose riches could not buy his life, to the seamstress of twenty, whose
poverty and obscurity could not save her. physical diseases, engendered
in the vices and neglects of men, will seize on victims of all degrees;
and the frightful moral disorder, born of unspeakable suffering,
intolerable oppression, and heartless indifference, smote equally
without distinction.

charles darnay, alone in a cell, had sustained himself with no
flattering delusion since he came to it from the tribunal. in every line
of the narrative he had heard, he had heard his condemnation. he had
fully comprehended that no personal influence could possibly save him,
that he was virtually sentenced by the millions, and that units could
avail him nothing.

nevertheless, it was not easy, with the face of his beloved wife fresh
before him, to compose his mind to what it must bear. his hold on lif
