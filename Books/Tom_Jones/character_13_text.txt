england; and that nothing but regard to right made him and the rest of
the popish party to be jacobites.”--“i believe him to be as much a
protestant as i believe he hath any right,” says jones; “and i make no
doubt of our success, but not without a battle. so that i am not so
sanguine as your friend the popish priest.” “nay, to be sure, sir,”
 answered partridge, “all the prophecies i have ever read speak of a
great deal of blood to be spilt in the quarrel, and the miller with
three thumbs, who is now alive, is to hold the horses of three kings,
up to his knees in blood. lord, have mercy upon us all, and send
better times!” “with what stuff and nonsense hast thou filled thy
head!” answered jones: “this too, i suppose, comes from the popish
priest. monsters and prodigies are the proper arguments to support
monstrous and absurd doctrines. the cause of king george is the cause
of liberty and true religion. in other words, it is the cause of

happens in every other kind of knowledge. neither physic nor law are

may have described the plant, he himself would advise his disciple to

afflicted him, and his countenance, as well as his behaviour, in
defiance of all his endeavours to the contrary, betrayed manifest
indications of a disordered mind.

the discourse turned at present, as before, on love; and mr
nightingale again expressed many of those warm, generous, and
disinterested sentiments upon this subject, which wise and sober men
call romantic, but which wise and sober women generally regard in a
better light. mrs miller (for so the mistress of the house was called)
greatly approved these sentiments; but when the young gentleman
appealed to miss nancy, she answered only, “that she believed the
gentleman who had spoke the least was capable of feeling most.”

this compliment was so apparently directed to jones, that we should
have been sorry had he passed it by unregarded. he made her indeed a
very polite answer, and concluded with an oblique hint, that her own
silence subjected her to a suspicion of the same

 kind: for indeed she
had scarce opened her lips either now or the last evening.

“i am glad, nanny,” says mrs miller, “the gentleman hath made the
observation; i protest i am almost of his opinion. what can be the
matter with you, child? i never saw such an alteration. what is become
of all your gaiety? would you think, sir, i used to call her my little
prattler? she hath not spoke twenty words this week.”

here their conversation was interrupted by the entrance of a
maid-servant, who brought a bundle in her hand, which, she said, “was
delivered by a porter for mr jones.” she added, “that the man
im

er.”

jones expressed some surprize on this occasion, and declared it must
be some mistake; but the maid persisting that she was certain of the
name, all the women were desirous of having the bundle immediately
opened; which operation was at length performed by little betsy, with
the consent of mr jones: and the contents were found to be a domino, a
mask, and a masquerade ticket.

jones was now more positive than ever in asserting, that these things
must have been delivered by mistake; and mrs miller herself expressed
some doubt, and said, “she knew not what to think.” but when mr
nightingale was asked, he delivered a very different opinion. “all i
can conclude from it, sir,” said he, “is, that you are a very happy
man; for i make no doubt but these were sent you by some lady whom you
will have the happiness of meeting at the masquerade.”

jones had not a sufficient degree of vanity to entertain any such
flattering imagination; nor did mrs miller herself give much assent to
what

 mr nightingale had said, till miss nancy having lifted up the
domino, a card dropt from the sleeve, in which was written as
follows:--

     to mr jones.

     the queen of the fairies sends you this;
     use her favours not amiss.

mrs miller and miss nancy now both agreed with mr nightingale; nay,
jones himself was almost persuaded to be of the same opinion. and as
no other lady but mrs fitzpatrick, he thought, knew his lodging, he
began to flatter himself with some hopes, that it came from her, and
that he might possibly see his sophia. these hopes had surely very
little foundation; but as the conduct of mrs fitzpatrick, in not
seeing him according to her promise, and in quitting her lodgings, had
been very odd and unaccountable,

od woman would not accept them. she said, “she did not conceive the
harm which some people imagined in a masquerade; but that such
extravagant diversions were proper only for persons of quality and
fortune, and not for young women who were to get their living, and
could, at best, hope to be married to a good tradesman.”----“a
tradesman!” cries nightingale, “you shan’t undervalue my nancy. there
is not a nobleman upon earth above her merit.” “o fie! mr
nightingale,” answered mrs miller, “you must not fill the girl’s head
with such fancies: but if it was her good luck” (says the mother with
a simper) “to find a gentleman of your generous way of thinking, i
hope she would make a better return to his generosity than to give her
mind up to extravagant pleasures. indeed, where young ladies bring
great fortunes themselves, they have some right to insist on spending
what is their own; and on that account i have heard the gentlemen say,
a man has sometimes a better bargain wi

for he is really very ill. the rest of the children are in pretty good
health: but molly, i am afraid, will do herself an injury: she is but
thirteen years old, mr nightingale, and yet, in my life, i never saw a
better nurse: she tends both her mother and her brother; and, what is
wonderful in a creature so young, she shows all the chearfulness in
the world to her mother; and yet i saw her--i saw the poor child, mr
nightingale, turn about, and privately wipe the tears from her eyes.”
 here mrs miller was prevented, by her own tears, from going on, and
there was not, i believe, a person present who did not accompany her
in them; at length she a little recovered herself, and proceeded thus:
“in all this distress the mother supports her spirits in a surprizing
manner. the danger of her son sits heaviest upon her, and yet she
endeavours as much as possible to conceal even this concern, on her
husband’s account. her grief, however, sometimes gets the better of
all her endeavours; for she was

“this was a love-match, as they call it, on both sides; that is, a
match between two beggars. i must, indeed, say, i never saw a fonder
couple; but what is their fondness good for, but to torment each
other?” “indeed, mamma,” cries nancy, “i have always looked on my
cousin anderson” (for that was her name) “as one of the happiest of
women.” “i am sure,” says mrs miller, “the case at present is much
otherwise; for any one might have discerned that the tender
consideration of each other’s sufferings makes the most intolerable
part of their calamity, both to the husband and wife. compared to
which, hunger and cold, as they affect their own persons only, are
scarce evils. nay, the very children, the youngest, which is not two
years old, excepted, feel in the same manner; for they are a most
loving family, and, if they had but a bare competency, would be the

stress; but, indeed, this absolute ruin hath been brought upon
them by others. the poor man was bail for the villain his brother; and
about a week ago, the very day before her lying-in, their goods were
all carried away, and sold by an execution. he sent a letter to me of
it by one of the bailiffs, which the villain never delivered.--what
must he think of my suffering a week to pass before he heard of me?”

it was not with dry eyes that jones heard this narrative; when it was
ended he took mrs miller apart with him into another room, and,
delivering her his purse, in which was the sum of £50, desired her to
send as much of it as she thought proper to these poor people. the
look which mrs miller gave jones, on this occasion, is not easy to be
described. she burst into a kind of agony of transport, and cryed
out--“good heavens! is there such a man in the world?”--but
recollecting herself, she said, “indeed i know one such; but can there
be another?” “i hope, madam,” cries jones,

“there are many who have
common humanity; for to relieve such distresses in our fellow-creatures,
can hardly be called more.” mrs miller then took ten guineas, which
were the utmost he could prevail with her to accept, and said, “she
would find some means of conveying them early the next morning;”
 adding, “that she had herself done some little matter for the poor
people, and had not left them in quite so much misery as she found
them.”

they then returned to the parlour, where nightingale expressed much
concern at the dreadful situation of these wretches, whom indeed he
knew; for he had seen them more than once at mrs m

iller’s. he
inveighed against the folly of making oneself liable for the debts of
others; vented many bitter execrations against the brother; and
concluded with wishing something could be done for the unfortunate
family. “suppose, madam,” said he, “you should recommend them to mr
allworthy? or what think you of a collection? i will give them a
guinea with all my heart.”

mrs miller made no answer; and nancy, to whom her mother had whispered
the generosity of jones, turned pale upon the occasion; though, if
either of them was angry with nightingale, it was surely without
reason. for the liberality of jones, if he had known it, was not an
example which he had any obligation to follow; and there are thousands
who would not have contributed a single halfpenny, as indeed he did
not in effect, for he made no tender of anything; and therefore, as
the others thought proper to mak

omised herself two or
three hours of uninterrupted conversation after her return from the
place where she dined, which was at a friend’s house in a pretty
distant part of the town, near her old place of assignation, where she
had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the revolution
that had happened in the mind and morals of her late confidante.



chapter x.

a chapter which, though short, may draw tears from some eyes.


mr jones was just dressed to wait on lady bellaston, when mrs miller
rapped at his door; and, being admitted, very earnestly desired his
company below-stairs, to drink tea in the parlour.

upon his entrance into the room, she presently introduced a person to
him, saying, “this, sir, is my cousin, who hath been so greatly
beholden to your goodness, for which he begs to return you his
sincerest thanks.”

the man had scarce entered upon that speech which mrs miller had so
kindly prefaced, when both jones and he, looking stedfastly at each
other, showed at once 
 
 ___________________________
 
the utmost tokens of surprize. the voice of the
latter began instantly to faulter; and, instead of finishing his
speech, he sunk down into a chair, crying, “it is so, i am convinced
it is so!”

“bless me! what’s the meaning of this?” cries mrs miller; “you are not
ill, i hope, cousin? some water, a dram this instant.”

“be not frighted, madam,” cries jones, “i have almost as much need of
a dram as your cousin. we are equally surprized at this unexpected
meeting. your cousin is an acquaintance of mine, mrs miller.”

“an acquaintance!” cries the man.--“oh, heaven!”

“ay, an acquaintance,” repeated jones, “and an honoured acquaintance
too. when i do not love and honour the man who dares venture
everything to preserve 
 
 ___________________________
 
his wife and children from instant destruction,
may i have a friend capable of disowning me in adversity!”

“oh, you are an excellent young man,” cries mrs miller:--“yes, indeed,
poor creature! he hath ventured everything.--if he had not had one of
the best of constitutions, it must have killed him.”

“cousin,” cries the man, who had now pretty well recovered himself,
“this is the angel from heaven whom i meant. this is he to whom,
before i saw you, i owed the preservation of my peggy. he it was to
whose generosity every comfort, every support which i have procured
for her, was owing. he is, indeed, the worthiest, bravest, noblest; of
all human

and thank you.--my children
too must express their gratitude.----indeed, sir, they are not without
a sense of their obligation; but what is my feeling when i reflect to
whom i owe that they are now capable of expressing their
gratitude.----oh, sir, the little hearts which you have warmed had now
been cold as ice without your assistance.”

here jones attempted to prevent the poor man from proceeding; but
indeed the overflowing of his own heart would of itself have stopped
his words. and now mrs miller likewise began to pour forth
thanksgivings, as well in her own name, as in that of her cousin, and
concluded with saying, “she doubted not but such goodness would meet a
glorious reward.”

jones answered, “he had been sufficiently rewarded already. your
cousin’s account, madam,” said he, “hath given me a sensation more
pleasing than i have ever known. he must be a wretch who is unmoved at
hearing such a story; how transporting then must be the thought of
having happily acted a part

ee him again as soon as possible; promising that
he would himself take the first opportunity of visiting him at his own
house. he then stept into his chair, and proceeded to lady
bellaston’s, greatly exulting in the happiness which he had procured
to this poor family; nor could he forbear reflecting, without horror,
on the dreadful consequences which must have attended them, had he
listened rather to the voice of strict justice than to that of mercy,
when he was attacked on the high road.

mrs miller sung forth the praises of jones during the whole evening,
in which mr anderson, while he stayed, so passionately accompanied
her, that he was often on the very point of mentioning the
circumstance of the robbery. however, he luckily recollected himself,
and avoided an indiscretion which would have been so much the greater,
as he knew mrs miller to be extremely strict and nice in her
principles. he was likewise well apprized of the loquacity of this
lady; and yet such was his gratitude, that it

xcuse; and to this he soon received the following answer:--

  “i am vexed that i cannot see you here this afternoon, but more
  concerned for the occasion; take great care of yourself, and have
  the best advice, and i hope there will be no danger.--i am so
  tormented all this morning with fools, that i have scarce a moment’s
  time to write to you. adieu.

  “_p.s._--i will endeavour to call on you this evening, at nine.--be
  sure to be alone.”

mr jones now received a visit from mrs miller, who, after some formal
introduction, began the following speech:--“i am very sorry, sir, to
wait upon you on such an occasion; but i hope you will consider the
ill consequence which it must be to the reputation of my poor girls,
if my house should once be talked of as a house of ill-fame. i hope
you won’t think me, therefore, guilty of impertinence, if i beg you
not to bring any more ladies in at that time of night. the clock had
struck two before one of them went away.”--“i do assure

you, madam,”
 said jones, “the lady who was here last night, and who staid the
latest (for the other only brought me a letter), is a woman of very
great fashion, and my near relation.”--“i don’t know what fashion she
is of,” answered mrs miller; “but i am sure no woman of virtue, unless
a very near relation indeed, would visit a young gentleman at ten at
night, and stay four hours in his room with him alone; besides, sir,
the behaviour of her chairmen shows what she was; for they did nothing
but make jests all the evening in the entry, and asked mr partridge,
in the hearing of my own maid, if madam intended to stay with his
master all night; with a great deal of stuff not proper to be
repeated. i have really a great respect for you,

’ and my own reputation were out of the case, i
should, for your own sake, be sorry that so pretty a young gentleman
should converse with these women; but if you are resolved to do it, i
must beg you to take another lodging; for i do not myself like to have
such things carried on under my roof; but more especially upon the
account of my girls, who have little, heaven knows, besides their
characters, to recommend them.” jones started and changed colour at
the name of allworthy. “indeed, mrs miller,” answered he, a little
warmly, “i do not take this at all kind. i will never bring any
slander on your house; but i must insist on seeing what company i
please in my own room; and if that gives you any offence, i shall, as
soon as i am able, look for another lodging.”--“i am sorry we must
part then, sir,” said she; “but i am convinced mr allworthy himself
would never come within my doors, if he had the least suspicion of my
keeping an ill house.”--“very well, madam,” said jon

id mention such a matter,” answers
partridge, “i am sure i thought no harm; for i should not have opened
my lips, if it had not been to his own friends and relations, who, i
imagined, would have let it go no farther.” “but i have a much heavier
charge against you,” cries jones, “than this. how durst you, after all
the precautions i gave you, mention the name of mr allworthy in this
house?” partridge denied that he ever had, with many oaths. “how
else,” said jones, “should mrs miller be acquainted that there was any
connexion between him and me? and it is but this moment she told me
she respected me on his account.” “o lord, sir,” said partridge, “i
desire only to be heard out; and to be sure, never was anything so
unfortunate: hear me but out, and you will own how wrongfully you have
accused me. when mrs honour came downstairs last night she met me in
the entry, and asked me when my master had heard from mr allworthy;
and to be sure mrs miller heard the very words;

es than mr nightingale, with whom
he had now contracted a great intimacy, came to him, and, after a
short salutation, said, “so, tom, i hear you had company very late
last night. upon my soul you are a happy fellow, who have not been in
town above a fortnight, and can keep chairs waiting at your door till
two in the morning.” he then ran on with much commonplace raillery of
the same kind, till jones at last interrupted him, saying, “i suppose
you have received all this information from mrs miller, who hath been
up here a little while ago to give me warning. the good woman is
afraid, it seems, of the reputation of her daughters.” “oh! she is
wonderfully nice,” says nightingale, “upon that account; if you
remember, she would not let nancy go with us to the masquerade.” “nay,
upon my honour, i think she’s in the right of it,” says jones:
“however, i have taken her at her word, and have sent partridge to
look for another lodging.” “if you will,” says nightingale, “
 
 ___________________________
 
we may, i
believe, be again together; for, to tell you a secret, which i desire
you won’t mention in the family, i intend to quit the house to-day.”
 “what, hath mrs miller given you warning too, my friend?” cries jones.
“no,” answered the other; “but the rooms are not convenient enough.
besides, i am grown weary of this part of the town. i want to be
nearer the places of diversion; so i am going to pall-mall.” “and do
you intend to make a secret of your going away?” said jones. “i
promise you,” answered nightingale, “i don’t intend to bilk my
lodgings; but i have a private reason for not taking a formal leave.”
 “not so private,” answe

r which he had before this time received some rebukes from
jones, who always exprest great bitterness against any misbehaviour to
the fair part of the species, who, if considered, he said, as they
ought to be, in the light of the dearest friends, were to be
cultivated, honoured, and caressed with the utmost love and
tenderness; but, if regarded as enemies, were a conquest of which a
man ought rather to be ashamed than to value himself upon it.



chapter v.

a short account of the history of mrs miller.


jones this day eat a pretty good dinner for a sick man, that is to
say, the larger half of a shoulder of mutton. in the afternoon he
received an invitation from mrs miller to drink tea; for that good
woman, having learnt, either by means of partridge, or by some other
means natural or supernatural, that he had a connexion with mr
allworthy, could not endure the thoughts of parting with him in an
angry manner.

jones accepted the invitation; and no sooner was the tea-kettle
removed, and the g

 dear husband used to
say, unless the word `dishonourable’ be applied to the parents; for
the children can derive no real dishonour from an act of which they
are intirely innocent.”

here jones heaved a deep sigh, and then said, “since i perceive,
madam, you really do know me, and mr allworthy hath thought proper to
mention my name to you; and since you have been so explicit with me as
to your own affairs, i will acquaint you with some more circumstances
concerning myself.” and these mrs miller having expressed great desire
and curiosity to hear, he began and related to her his whole history,
without once mentioning the name of sophia.

there is a kind of sympathy in honest minds, by means of which they
give an easy credit to each other. mrs miller believed all which jones
told her to be true, and exprest much pity and concern for him. she
was beginning to comment on the story, but jones interrupted her; for,
as the hour of assignation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a
second

 interview with the lady that evening, which he promised should
be the last at her house; swearing, at the same time, that she was one
of great distinction, and that nothing but what was intirely innocent
was to pass between them; and i do firmly believe he intended to keep
his word.

mrs miller was at length prevailed on, and jones departed to his
chamber, where he sat alone till twelve o’clock, but no lady bellaston
appeared.

as we have said that this lady had a great affection for jones, and as
it must have appeared that she really had so, the reader may perhaps
wonder at the first failure of her appointment, as she apprehended him
to be confined by sickness, a season when friendship seems most to
require such visits. this behaviour, therefore, in the lady, may, by
some, be conde

hat susan” (which was the name of the maid) “had given
him to understand, it was nothing more than a common affair. in
short,” said he, “miss nancy hath had a mind to be as wise as her
mother; that’s all; she was a little hungry, it seems, and so sat
down to dinner before grace was said; and so there is a child coming
for the foundling hospital.”----“prithee, leave thy stupid jesting,”
 cries jones. “is the misery of these poor wretches a subject of
mirth? go immediately to mrs miller, and tell her i beg leave--stay,
you will make some blunder; i will go myself; for she desired me to
breakfast with her.” he then rose and dressed himself as fast as he
could; and while he was dressing, partridge, notwithstanding many
severe rebukes, could not avoid throwing forth certain pieces of
brutality, commonly called jests, on this occasion. jones was no
sooner dressed than he walked downstairs, and knocking at the door,
was presently admitted by the maid, into the outward parlour, wh

r mistress hoped he
would excuse the disappointment, but an accident had happened, which
made it impossible for her to have the pleasure of his company at
breakfast that day; and begged his pardon for not sending him up
notice sooner.” jones desired, “she would give herself no trouble
about anything so trifling as his disappointment; that he was
heartily sorry for the occasion; and that if he could be of any
service to her, she might command him.”

he had scarce spoke these words, when mrs miller, who heard them all,
suddenly threw open the door, and coming out to him, in a flood of
tears, said, “o mr jones! you are certainly one of the best young men
alive. i give you a thousand thanks for your kind offer of your
service; but, alas! sir, it is out of your power to preserve my poor
girl.--o my child! my child! she is undone, she is ruined for ever!”
 “i hope, madam,” said jones, “no villain”----“o mr jones!” said she,
“that villain who yesterday left my lodgings, hath

red to soothe and encourage these hopes by the most generous
expressions of disinterested love, which he hath always directed to my
poor girl, and which i, as well as she, believed to be real. could i
have believed that these were only snares laid to betray the innocence
of my child, and for the ruin of us all?”--at these words little betsy
came running into the room, crying, “dear mamma, for heaven’s sake
come to my sister; for she is in another fit, and my cousin can’t hold
her.” mrs miller immediately obeyed the summons; but first ordered
betsy to stay with mr jones, and begged him to entertain her a few
minutes, saying, in the most pathetic voice, “good heaven! let me
preserve one of my children at least.”

jones, in compliance with this request, did all he could to comfort
the little girl, though he was, in reality, himself very highly
affected with mrs miller’s story. he told her “her sister would be
soon very well again; that by taking on in that manner she would not

 
 ___________________________
 
t part with her; indeed, i can’t.--and
then poor mamma too, what will become of her?--she says she will die
too, and leave me: but i am resolved i won’t be left behind.” “and are
you not afraid to die, my little betsy?” said jones. “yes,” answered
she, “i was always afraid to die; because i must have left my mamma,
and my sister; but i am not afraid of going anywhere with those i
love.”

jones was so pleased with this answer, that he eagerly kissed the
child; and soon after mrs miller returned, saying, “she thanked heaven
nancy was now come to herself. and now, betsy,” says she, “you may go
in, for your sister is better, and longs to see you.” she then turned
to jones, and began to renew her apologies for having disappointed him
of his breakfast.

“i hope, madam,” said jones, “i shall have a more exquisite repast
than any you could have provided for me. this, i assure you, will be
the case, if i can do any service to this little family of love. but
whatever suc

cess may attend my endeavours, i am resolved to attempt
it. i am very much deceived in mr nightingale, if, notwithstanding
what hath happened, he hath not much goodness of heart at the bottom,
as well as a very violent affection for your daughter. if this be the
case, i think the picture which i shall lay before him will affect
him. endeavour, madam, to comfort yourself, and miss nancy, as well as
you can. i will go instantly in quest of mr nightingale; and i hope to
bring you good news.”

mrs miller fell upon her knees and invoked all the blessings of heaven
upon mr jones; to which she afterwards added the most passionate
expressions of gratitude. he then departed to find mr nightingale, and
the good woman returned to comfort her daughter, who was somewhat
cheared at what her mother told her; and both joined in resounding the
praises of mr jones.

times that sum, and she shall
produce fifty to that before i consent that she shall marry my son.”
 “nay,” said jones, “it is too late to talk of consent now; if she had
not fifty farthings your son is married.”--“my son married!” answered
the old gentleman, with surprize. “nay,” said jones, “i thought you
was unacquainted with it.” “my son married to miss harris!” answered
he again. “to miss harris!” said jones; “no, sir; to miss nancy
miller, the daughter of mrs miller, at whose house he lodged; a young
lady, who, though her mother is reduced to let lodgings--“--“are you
bantering, or are you in earnest?” cries the father, with a most
solemn voice. “indeed, sir,” answered jones, “i scorn the character of
a banterer. i came to you in most serious earnest, imagining, as i
find true, that your son had never dared acquaint you with a match so
much inferior to him in point of fortune, though the reputation of the
lady will suffer it no longer to remain

 town; not, indeed, to forward, but to dissuade his brother
from a purpose which he conceived would inevitably ruin his nephew;
for he foresaw no other event from a union with miss harris,
notwithstanding the largeness of her fortune, as neither her person
nor mind seemed to him to promise any kind of matrimonial felicity:
for she was very tall, very thin, very ugly, very affected, very
silly, and very ill-natured.

his brother, therefore, no sooner mentioned the marriage of his nephew
with miss miller, than he exprest the utmost satisfaction; and when
the father had very bitterly reviled his son, and pronounced sentence
of beggary upon him, the uncle began in the following manner:

“if you was a little cooler, brother, i would ask you whether you love
your son for his sake or for your own. you would answer, i suppose,
and so i suppose you think, for his sake; and doubtless it is his
happiness which you intended in the marriage you proposed for him.

“now, brother, to prescribe rules of h

son, who hath, i believe, as little profited by your precepts, as by
your example.” for young nightingale was his uncle’s godson, and had
lived more with him than with his father. so that the uncle had often
declared he loved his nephew almost equally with his own child.

jones fell into raptures with this good gentleman; and when, after
much persuasion, they found the father grew still more and more
irritated, instead of appeased, jones conducted the uncle to his
nephew at the house of mrs miller.



chapter ix.

containing strange matters.


at his return to his lodgings, jones found the situation of affairs
greatly altered from what they had been in at his departure. the
mother, the two daughters, and young mr nightingale, were now sat down
to supper together, when the uncle was, at his own desire, introduced
without any ceremony into the company, to all of whom he was well
known; for he had several times visited his nephew at that house.

the old gentleman immediately walked up to mi

ss nancy, saluted and
wished her joy, as he did afterwards the mother and the other sister;
and lastly, he paid the proper compliments to his nephew, with the
same good humour and courtesy, as if his nephew had married his equal
or superior in fortune, with all the previous requisites first
performed.

miss nancy and her supposed husband both turned pale, and looked
rather foolish than otherwise upon the occasion; but mrs miller took
the first opportunity of withdrawing; and, having sent for jones into
the dining-room, she threw herself at his feet, and in a most
passionate flood of tears, called him her good angel, the preserver of
her poor little family, with many other respectful and endearing
appellations, and made him every acknowledgment which the highest
benefit can extract from the most grateful heart.

after the first gust of her passion was a little over, which she
declared, if she had not vented, would have

sat down again, while jones was wishing the ground to sink under him,
or the house to fall on his head, when an odd accident freed him from
an embarrassment out of which neither the eloquence of a cicero, nor
the politics of a machiavel, could have delivered him, without utter
disgrace.

this was no other than the arrival of young nightingale, dead drunk;
or rather in that state of drunkenness which deprives men of the use
of their reason without depriving them of the use of their limbs.

mrs miller and her daughters were in bed, and partridge was smoaking
his pipe by the kitchen fire; so that he arrived at mr jones’s
chamber-door without any interruption. this he burst open, and was
entering without any ceremony, when jones started from his seat and
ran to oppose him, which he did so effectually, that nightingale never
came far enough within the door to see who was sitting on the bed.

nightingale had in reality mistaken jones’s apartment for that in
which himself had lodged; he there

the morning some gentle remonstrances for
the hurricane which had happened the preceding night in his chamber.
these were, however, so gentle and so friendly, professing, and indeed
truly, to aim at nothing more than the real good of mr jones himself,
that he, far from being offended, thankfully received the admonition
of the good woman, expressed much concern for what had past, excused
it as well as he could, and promised never more to bring the same
disturbances into the house.

but though mrs miller did not refrain from a short expostulation in
private at their first meeting, yet the occasion of his being summoned
downstairs that morning was of a much more agreeable kind, being
indeed to perform the office of a father to miss nancy, and to give
her in wedlock to mr nightingale, who was now ready drest, and full as
sober as many of my readers will think a man ought to be who receives
a wife in so imprudent a manner.

and here perhaps it may be proper to account for the escape which this

the care of a servant, he directly
left the house, scarce knowing what he did, nor whither he went.

the uncle thus departed, when the servant came to attend the nephew to
bed, had waked him for that purpose, and had at last made him sensible
that his uncle was gone, he, instead of accepting the kind offices
tendered him, insisted on a chair being called; with this the servant,
who had received no strict orders to the contrary, readily complied;
and, thus being conducted back to the house of mrs miller, he had
staggered up to mr jones’s chamber, as hath been before recounted.

this bar of the uncle being now removed (though young nightingale knew
not as yet in what manner), and all parties being quickly ready, the
mother, mr jones, mr nightingale, and his love, stept into a
hackney-coach, which conveyed them to doctors’ commons; where miss
nancy was, in vulgar language, soon made an honest woman, and the poor
mother became, in the purest sense of the word, one of the happiest of

in favour of sophia.

nightingale highly exulted in the success of his stratagem, upon which
he received many thanks and much applause from his friend. he
answered, “dear tom, we have conferred very different obligations on
each other. to me you owe the regaining your liberty; to you i owe the
loss of mine. but if you are as happy in the one instance as i am in
the other, i promise you we are the two happiest fellows in england.”

the two gentlemen were now summoned down to dinner, where mrs miller,
who performed herself the office of cook, had exerted her best talents
to celebrate the wedding of her daughter. this joyful circumstance she
ascribed principally to the friendly behaviour of jones, her whole
soul was fired with gratitude towards him, and all her looks, words,
and actions, were so busied in expressing it, that her daughter, and
even her new son-in-law, were very little objects of her
consideration.

dinner was just ended when mrs miller received a letter; but as we
have had le

is numberless benefits on others, acted
by a rule diametrically opposite to what is practised by most generous
people. he contrived, on all occasions, to hide his beneficence, not
only from the world, but even from the object of it. he constantly
used the words lend and pay, instead of give; and by every other
method he could invent, always lessened with his tongue the favours he
conferred, while he was heaping them with both his hands. when he
settled the annuity of £50 a year therefore on mrs miller, he told
her, “it was in consideration of always having her first-floor when he
was in town (which he scarce ever intended to be), but that she might
let it at any other time, for that he would always send her a month’s
warning.” he was now, however, hurried to town so suddenly, that he
had no opportunity of giving such notice; and this hurry probably
prevented him, when he wrote for his lodgings, adding, if they were
then empty; for he would most certainly have been well satisfied to

to these it is so far from being sufficient that their defence would
acquit them at the old bailey, that they are not even contented,
though conscience, the severest of all judges, should discharge them.
nothing short of the fair and honourable will satisfy the delicacy of
their minds; and if any of their actions fall short of this mark, they
mope and pine, are as uneasy and restless as a murderer, who is afraid
of a ghost, or of the hangman.

mrs miller was one of these. she could not conceal her uneasiness at
this letter; with the contents of which she had no sooner acquainted
the company, and given some hints of her distress, than jones, her
good angel, presently relieved her anxiety. “as for myself, madam,”
 said he, “my lodging is at your service at a moment’s warning; and mr
nightingale, i am sure, as he cannot yet prepare a house fit to
receive his lady, will consent to return to his new lodging, whither
mrs nightingale will cert
 
 ___________________________
 
ainly consent to go.” with which proposal
both husband and wife instantly agreed.

the reader will easily believe, that the cheeks of mrs miller began
again to glow with additional gratitude to jones; but, perhaps, it may
be more difficult to persuade him, that mr jones having in his last
speech called her daughter mrs nightingale (it being the first time
that agreeable sound had ever reached her ears), gave the fond mother
more satisfaction, and warmed her heart more towards jones, than his
having dissipated her present anxiety.

the next day was then appointed for the removal of the new-married
couple, and of mr jones, who was likewis

seems to have been an utter enemy to his match with sophia, tried a
new method to put a final end to it, by throwing a temptation in his
way, which in his present desperate situation it seemed unlikely he
should be able to resist.



chapter xi.

containing curious, but not unprecedented matter.


there was a lady, one mrs hunt, who had often seen jones at the house
where he lodged, being intimately acquainted with the women there, and
indeed a very great friend to mrs miller. her age was about thirty,
for she owned six-and-twenty; her face and person very good, only
inclining a little too much to be fat. she had been married young by
her relations to an old turkey merchant, who, having got a great
fortune, had left off trade. with him she lived without reproach, but
not without pain, in a state of great self-denial, for about twelve
years; and her virtue was rewarded by his dying and leaving her very
rich. the first year of her widowhood was just at an end, and she

conversation by ordering chairs to be called. i say luckily, for had
it continued much longer, fresh matter of dissension would, most
probably, have arisen between the brother and sister; between whom
education and sex made the only difference; for both were equally
violent and equally positive: they had both a vast affection for
sophia, and both a sovereign contempt for each other.



chapter v.

in which jones receives a letter from sophia, and goes to a play with
mrs miller and partridge.


the arrival of black george in town, and the good offices which that
grateful fellow had promised to do for his old benefactor, greatly
comforted jones in the midst of all the anxiety and uneasiness which
he had suffered on the account of sophia; from whom, by the means of
the said george, he received the following answer to his letter, which
sophia, to whom the use of pen, ink, and paper was restored with her
liberty, wrote the very evening when she departed from her

ntment,
which he had before made, into execution. this was, to attend mrs
miller, and her younger daughter, into the gallery at the play-house,
and to admit mr partridge as one of the company. for as jones had
really that taste for humour which many affect, he expected to enjoy
much entertainment in the criticisms of partridge, from whom he
expected the simple dictates of nature, unimproved, indeed, but
likewise unadulterated, by art.

in the first row then of the first gallery did mr jones, mrs miller,
her youngest daughter, and partridge, take their places. partridge
immediately declared it was the finest place he had ever been in. when
the first music was played, he said, “it was a wonder how so many
fiddlers could play at one time, without putting one another out.”
 while the fellow was lighting the upper candles, he cried out to mrs
miller, “look, look, madam, the very picture of the man in the end of
the common-prayer book before the gunpowder-treason service.” nor
could he help

pieces. if she was my own mother, i would serve her so. to be sure all
duty to a mother is forfeited by such wicked doings.----ay, go about
your business, i hate the sight of you.”

our critic was now pretty silent till the play, which hamlet
introduces before the king. this he did not at first understand, till
jones explained it to him; but he no sooner entered into the spirit of
it, than he began to bless himself that he had never committed murder.
then turning to mrs miller, he asked her, “if she did not imagine the
king looked as if he was touched; though he is,” said he, “a good
actor, and doth all he can to hide it. well, i would not have so much
to answer for, as that wicked man there hath, to sit upon a much
higher chair than he sits upon. no wonder he ran away; for your sake
i’ll never trust an innocent face again.”

the grave-digging scene next engaged the attention of partridge, who
expressed much surprize at the number of skulls thrown upon the

are: i never could bring myself to touch anything belonging to a dead
man, on any account.--he seemed frightened enough too at the ghost, i

little more worth remembering occurred during the play, at the end of
which jones asked him, “which of the players he had liked best?” to
this he answered, with some appearance of indignation at the question,
“the king, without doubt.” “indeed, mr partridge,” says mrs miller,
“you are not of the same opinion with the town; for they are all
agreed, that hamlet is acted by the best player who ever was on the
stage.” “he the best player!” cries partridge, with a contemptuous
sneer, “why, i could act as well as he myself. i am sure, if i had
seen a ghost, i should have looked in the very same manner, and done
just as he did. and then, to be sure, in that scene, as you called it,
between him and his mother, where you told me he acted so fine, why,

, any man, that is, any good man, that had such a mother,
would have done exactly the same. i know you are only joking with me;
but indeed, madam, though i was never at a play in london, yet i have
seen acting before in the country; and the king for my money; he
speaks all his words distinctly, half as loud again as the
other.--anybody may see he is an actor.”

while mrs miller was thus engaged in conversation with partridge, a
lady came up to mr jones, whom he immediately knew to be mrs
fitzpatrick. she said, she had seen him from the other part of the
gallery, and had taken that opportunity of speaking to him, as she had
something to say, which might be of great service to himself. she then
acquainted him with her lodgings, and made him an appointment the next
day in the morning; which, upon recollection, she presently changed to
the afternoon; at which time jones p

thus ended the adventure at the playhouse; where partridge had
afforded great mirth, not only to jones and mrs miller, but to all who
sat within hearing, who were more attentive to what he said, than to
anything that passed on the stage.

he durst not go to bed all that night, for fear of the ghost; and for
many nights after sweated two or three hours before he went to sleep,
with the same apprehensions, and waked several times in great horrors,
crying out, “lord have mercy upon us! there it is.”

none of these helps. to natural means alone we are confined; let us
try therefore what, by these means, may be done for poor jones; though
to confess the truth, something whispers me in the ear that he doth
not yet know the worst of his fortune; and that a more shocking piece
of news than any he hath yet heard remains for him in the unopened
leaves of fate.



chapter ii.

the generous and grateful behaviour of mrs miller.


mr allworthy and mrs miller were just sat down to breakfast, when
blifil, who had gone out very early that morning, returned to make one
of the company.

he had not been long seated before he began as follows: “good lord! my
dear uncle, what do you think hath happened? i vow i am afraid of
telling it you, for fear of shocking you with the remembrance of ever
having shewn any kindness to such a villain.” “what is the matter,
child?” said the uncle. “i fear i have shewn kindness in m

y life to
the unworthy more than once. but charity doth not adopt the vices of
its objects.” “o, sir!” returned blifil, “it is not without the secret
direction of providence that you mention the word adoption. your
adopted son, sir, that jones, that wretch whom you nourished in your
bosom, hath proved one of the greatest villains upon earth.” “by all
that’s sacred ‘tis false,” cries mrs miller. “mr jones is no villain.
he is one of the worthiest creatures breathing; and if any other
person had called him villain, i would have thrown all this boiling
water in his face.” mr allworthy looked very much amazed at this
behaviour. but she did not give him leave to speak, before, turning to
him, she cried, “i hope you will not be angry with me; i would not
offend you, sir, for the world; but, indeed, i could not bear to hear
him called so.” “i must own, madam,” said allworthy, ve

ed, my best of friends, he deserves a kinder
appellation from you, had you heard the good, the kind, the grateful
things which i have heard him utter of you. he never mentions your
name but with a sort of adoration. in this very room i have seen him
on his knees, imploring all the blessings of heaven upon your head. i
do not love that child there better than he loves you.”

“i see, sir, now,” said blifil, with one of those grinning sneers with
which the devil marks his best beloved, “mrs miller really doth know
him. i suppose you will find she is not the only one of your
acquaintance to whom he hath exposed you. as for my character, i
perceive, by some hints she hath thrown out, he hath been very free
with it, but i forgive him.” “and the lord forgive you, sir!” said mrs
miller; “we have all sins enough to stand in need of his forgiveness.”

“upon my word, mrs miller,” said allworthy, “i do not take this
behaviour of yours to my nephew kindly; and i do assure you, as a

ny
reflections which you cast upon him must come only from that wickedest
of men, they would only serve, if that were possible, to heighten my
resentment against him: for i must tell you, mrs miller, the young man
who now stands before you hath ever been the warmest advocate for the
ungrateful wretch whose cause you espouse. this, i think, when you
hear it from my own mouth, will make you wonder at so much baseness
and ingratitude.”

“you are deceived, sir,” answered mrs miller; “if they were the last
words which were to issue from my lips, i would say you were deceived;
and i once more repeat it, the lord forgive those who have deceived
you! i do not pretend to say the young man is without faults; but they
are all the faults of wildness and of youth; faults which he may, nay,
which i am certain he will, relinquish, and, if he should not, they
are vastly overbalanced by one of the most humane, tender, honest
hearts that ever man was blest with.”

“indeed, mrs mi
 
 ___________________________
 
must have been the most despicable and most
ungrateful of wretches if i had acted any other part than i have.”

“well, madam,” said allworthy, “i shall be very glad to hear any good
excuse for a behaviour which, i must confess, i think wants an excuse.
and now, madam, will you be pleased to let my nephew proceed in his
story without interruption. he would not have introduced a matter of
slight consequence with such a preface. perhaps even this story will
cure you of your mistake.”

mrs miller gave tokens of submission, and then mr blifil began thus:
“i am sure, sir, if you don’t think proper to resent the ill-usage of
mrs miller, i shall easily forgive what affects me only. i think your
goodness hath not deserved this indignity at her hands.” “well,
child,” said allworthy, “but what is this new instance? what hath he
done of late?” “what,” cries blifil, “notwithstanding all mrs miller
hath said, i am very sorry to relate, and what you should never have
heard from
 
 ___________________________
 
 me, had it not been a matter impossible to conceal from the
whole world. in short he hath killed a man; i will not say
murdered--for perhaps it may not be so construed in law, and i hope
the best for his sake.”

allworthy looked shocked, and blessed himself; and then, turning to
mrs miller, he cried, “well, madam, what say you now?”

“why, i say, sir,” answered she, “that i never was more concerned at
anything in my life; but, if the fact be true, i am convinced the man,
whoever he is, was in fault. heaven knows there are many villains in
this town who make it their business to provoke young gentlemen.
nothing but the greatest provocation could have tempted him; for of
all the gentlemen i ever had in my house, i never saw one so gentle or
so sweet-tempered. he was belov

some readers may, perhaps, be pleased with these minute circumstances,
in relating of which we follow the example of plutarch, one of the
best of our brother historians; and others, to whom they may appear
trivial, will, we hope, at least pardon them, as we are never prolix
on such occasions.



chapter iii.

the arrival of mr western, with some matters concerning the paternal
authority.


mrs miller had not long left the room when mr western entered; but not
before a small wrangling bout had passed between him and his chairmen;
for the fellows, who had taken up their burden at the hercules
pillars, had conceived no hopes of having any future good customer in
the squire; and they were moreover farther encouraged by his
generosity (for he had given them of his own accord sixpence more than
their fare); they therefore very boldly demanded another shilling,
which so provoked the squire, that h

said; and agreed that a little distant behaviour might not be improper
to so forward a lover.

thus sophia, by a little well-directed flattery, for which surely none
will blame her, obtained a little ease for herself, and, at least, put
off the evil day. and now we have seen our heroine in a better
situation than she hath been for a long time before, we will look a
little after mr jones, whom we left in the most deplorable situation
that can be well imagined.



chapter v.

mrs miller and mr nightingale visit jones in the prison.


when mr allworthy and his nephew went to meet mr western, mrs miller
set forwards to her son-in-law’s lodgings, in order to acquaint him
with the accident which had befallen his friend jones; but he had
known it long before from partridge (for jones, when he left mrs
miller, had been furnished with a room in the same house with mr
nightingale). the good woman found her daughter under great affliction
on account of mr jones, whom having comforted

 consequence, can be attended with no danger to you,
and in which your conscience cannot accuse you of having been the
least to blame? if the fellow should die, what have you done more than
taken away the life of a ruffian in your own defence? so will the
coroner’s inquest certainly find it; and then you will be easily
admitted to bail; and, though you must undergo the form of a trial,
yet it is a trial which many men would stand for you for a shilling.”
 “come, come, mr jones,” says mrs miller, “chear yourself up. i knew
you could not be the aggressor, and so i told mr allworthy, and so he
shall acknowledge too, before i have done with him.”

jones gravely answered, “that whatever might be his fate, he
should always lament the having shed the blood of one of his
fellow-creatures, as one of the highest misfortunes which could
have befallen him. but i have another misfortune of the tenderest
kind----o! mrs miller, i have lost what i held most dear upon earth.”
 “that must be

a mistress,” said mrs miller; “but come, come; i know
more than you imagine” (for indeed partridge had blabbed all); “and i
have heard more than you know. matters go better, i promise you, than
you think; and i would not give blifil sixpence for all the chance
which he hath of the lady.”

“indeed, my dear friend, indeed,” answered jones, “you are an entire
stranger to the cause of my grief. if you was acquainted with the
story, you would allow my case admitted of no comfort. i apprehend no
danger from blifil.
 
 ___________________________
 
 i have undone myself.” “don’t despair,” replied
mrs miller; “you know not what a woman can do; and if anything be in
my power, i promise you i will do it to serve you. it is my duty. my
son, my dear mr nightingale, who is so kind to tell me he hath
obligations to you on the same account, knows it is my duty. shall i
go to the lady myself? i will say anything to her you would have me
say.”

“thou best of women,” cries jones, taking her by the hand, “talk not
of obligations to me;--but as you have been so kind to mention it,
there is a favour w
 
 ___________________________
 
hich, perhaps, may be in your power. i see you are
acquainted with the lady (how you came by your information i know
not), who sits, indeed, very near my heart. if you could contrive to
deliver this (giving her a paper from his pocket), i shall for ever
acknowledge your goodness.”

“give it me,” said mrs miller. “if i see it not in her own possession
before i sleep, may my next sleep be my last! comfort yourself, my
good young man! be wise enough to take warning from past follies, and
i warrant all shall be well, and i shall yet see you happy with the
most charming young lady in the world; for i so hear from every one
she is.”

“believe me, madam,” said he, “i do not speak the common cant of one
in my unhappy situation. before this dreadful accident happened, i had
resolved to quit a life of

 which i was become sensible of the
wickedness as well as folly. i do assure you, notwithstanding the
disturbances i have unfortunately occasioned in your house, for which
i heartily ask your pardon, i am not an abandoned profligate. though i
have been hurried into vices, i do not approve a vicious character,
nor will i ever, from this moment, deserve it.”

mrs miller expressed great satisfaction in these declarations, in the
sincerity of which she averred she had an entire faith; and now the
remainder of the conversation past in the joint attempts of that good
woman and mr nightingale to cheer the dejected spirits of mr jones, in
which they so far succeeded as to leave him much better comforted and
satisfied than they found him; to which happy alteration nothing so
much contributed as the kind undertaking of mrs miller to deliver his
letter to sophia, which

m sophia, he
informed partridge that she had strictly charged him, on pain of
having it communicated to her father, not to bring her any answer. he
was, moreover, not a little pleased to find he had so warm an advocate
to mr allworthy himself in this good woman, who was, in reality, one
of the worthiest creatures in the world.

after about an hour’s visit from the lady (for nightingale had been
with him much longer), they both took their leave, promising to return
to him soon; during which mrs miller said she hoped to bring him some
good news from his mistress, and mr nightingale promised to enquire
into the state of mr fitzpatrick’s wound, and likewise to find out
some of the persons who were present at the rencounter.

the former of these went directly in quest of sophia, whither we
likewise shall now attend her.



chapter vi.

in which mrs miller pays a visit to sophia.


access to the young lady was by no means difficult; for, as she lived
now on a perfect friendly footing with her a

liberty to receive what visitants she pleased.

sophia was dressing when she was acquainted that there was a
gentlewoman below to wait on her. as she was neither afraid, nor
ashamed, to see any of her own sex, mrs miller was immediately
admitted.

curtsies and the usual ceremonials between women who are strangers to
each other, being past, sophia said, “i have not the pleasure to know
you, madam.” “no, madam,” answered mrs miller, “and i must beg pardon
for intruding upon you. but when you know what has induced me to give
you this trouble, i hope----” “pray, what is your business, madam?”
 said sophia, with a little emotion. “madam, we are not alone,” replied
mrs miller, in a low voice. “go out, betty,” said sophia.

when betty was departed, mrs miller said, “i was desired, madam, by a
very unhappy young gentleman, to deliver you this letter.” sophia
changed colour when she saw the direction, well kn

owing the hand, and
after some hesitation, said--“i could not conceive, madam, from your
appearance, that your business had been of such a nature.--whomever
you brought this letter from, i shall not open it. i should be sorry
to entertain an unjust suspicion of any one; but you are an utter
stranger to me.”

“if you will have patience, madam,” answered mrs miller, “i will
acquaint you who i am, and how i came by that letter.” “i have no
curiosity, madam, to know anything,” cries sophia; “but i must insist
on your delivering that letter back to the person who gave it you.”

mrs miller then fell upon her knees, and in the most passionate terms
implored her compassion; to which sophia answered: “sure, madam, it is
surprizing you should be so very strongly interested in the behalf of
this person. i would not think, madam”--“no, madam,” s

ays mrs miller,
“you shall not think anything but the truth. i will tell you all, and
you will not wonder that i am interested. he is the best-natured
creature that ever was born.”--she then began and related the story of
mr anderson.--after this she cried, “this, madam, this is his
goodness; but i have much more tender obligations to him. he hath
preserved my child.”--here, after shedding some tears, she related
everything concerning that fact, suppressing only those circumstances
which would have mo

the alterations in the countenance of sophia had hitherto been chiefly
to her disadvantage, and had inclined her complexion to too great
paleness; but she now waxed redder, if possible, than vermilion, and
cried, “i know not what to say; certainly what arises from gratitude
cannot be blamed--but what service can my reading this letter do your
friend, since i am resolved never----” mrs miller fell again to her
entreaties, and begged to be forgiven, but she could not, she said,
carry it back. “well, madam,” says sophia, “i cannot help it, if you
will force it upon me.--certainly you may leave it whether i will or
no.” what sophia meant, or whether she meant anything, i will not
presume to determine; but mrs miller actually understood this as a
hint, and presently laying the letter down on the table, took her
leave, having first begged permission to wait again on sophia; which
 
 ___________________________
 

request had neither assent nor denial.

the letter lay upon the table no longer than till mrs miller was out
of sight; for then sophia opened and read it.

this letter did very little service to his cause; for it consisted of
little more than confessions of his own unworthiness, and bitter
lamentations of despair, together with the most solemn protestations
of his unalterable fidelity to sophia, of which, he said, he hoped to
convince her, if he had ever more the honour of being admitted to her
presence; and that he could account for the letter to lady bellaston
in such a manner, that, though

chapter vii.

a pathetic scene between mr allworthy and mrs miller.


mrs miller had a long discourse with mr allworthy, at his return from
dinner, in which she acquainted him with jones’s having unfortunately
lost all which he was pleased to bestow on him at their separation;
and with the distresses to which that loss had subjected him; of all
which she had received a full account from the faithful retailer
partridge. she then explained the obligations she had to jones; not
that she was entirely explicit with regard to her daughter; for though
she had the u

kind, i will depart from your house that instant. he is the worthiest
and best of men; and i once more repeat it to you, he hath carried his
friendship to this man to a blameable length, by too long concealing
facts of the blackest die. the ingratitude of the wretch to this good
young man is what i most resent; for, madam, i have the greatest
reason to imagine he had laid a plot to supplant my nephew in my
favour, and to have disinherited him.”

“i am sure, sir,” answered mrs miller, a little frightened (for,
though mr allworthy had the utmost sweetness and benevolence in his
smiles, he had great terror in his frowns), “i shall never speak
against any gentleman you are pleased to think well of. i am sure,
sir, such behaviour would very little become me, especially when the
gentleman is your nearest relation; but, sir, you must not be angry
with me, you must not indeed, for my good wishes to this poor wretch.
sure i may call him so now, though once you would have been ang

 must. when i
consider the cruel reverse of fortune which this poor youth, to whom i
am so much obliged, hath suffered; when i consider the loss of your
favour, which i know he valued more than his life, i must, i must
lament him. if you had a dagger in your hand, ready to plunge into my
heart, i must lament the misery of one whom you have loved, and i
shall ever love.”

allworthy was pretty much moved with this speech, but it seemed not to
be with anger; for, after a short silence, taking mrs miller by the
hand, he said very affectionately to her, “come, madam, let us
consider a little about your daughter. i cannot blame you for
rejoicing in a match which promises to be advantageous to her, but you
know this advantage, in a great measure, depends on the father’s
reconciliation. i know mr nightingale very well, and have formerly had
concerns with him; i will make him a visit, and endeavour to serve you
in this matter. i believe he is a worldly man; but as this is an only
son, and the th

be
brought to reason. i promise you i will do all i can for you.”

many were the acknowledgments which the poor woman made to allworthy
for this kind and generous offer, nor could she refrain from taking
this occasion again to express her gratitude towards jones, “to whom,”
 said she, “i owe the opportunity of giving you, sir, this present
trouble.” allworthy gently stopped her; but he was too good a man to
be really offended with the effects of so noble a principle as now
actuated mrs miller; and indeed, had not this new affair inflamed his
former anger against jones, it is possible he might have been a little
softened towards him, by the report of an action which malice itself
could not have derived from an evil motive.

mr allworthy and mrs miller had been above an hour together, when
their conversation was put an end to by the arrival of blifil and
another person, which other person was no less than mr dowling, the
attorney, who was now become a great favourite with mr blifil, a
 
 ___________________________
 
ad lived for
some time in the capacity of a comb-brush: she was a very sensible
girl, and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young
lady very carefully. these instructions, we are sorry to say, were
communicated to her by mrs honour, into whose favour lady bellaston
had now so ingratiated herself, that the violent affection which the
good waiting-woman had formerly borne to sophia was entirely
obliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new
mistress.

now, when mrs miller was departed, betty (for that was the name of the
girl), returning to her young lady, found her very attentively engaged
in reading a long letter, and the visible emotions which she betrayed
on that occasion might have well accounted for some suspicions which
the girl entertained; but indeed they had yet a stronger foundation,
for she had overheard the whole scene which passed between sophia and
mrs miller.

mrs western was acquainted with all this matter by betty, who, after
receiving many com
 
 ___________________________
 
mendations and some rewards for her fidelity, was
ordered, that, if the woman who brought the letter came again, she
should introduce her to mrs western herself.

unluckily, mrs miller returned at the very time when sophia was
engaged with his lordship. betty, according to order, sent her
directly to the aunt; who, being mistress of so many circumstances
relating to what had past the day before, easily imposed upon the poor
woman to believe that sophia had communicated the whole affair; and so
pumped everything out of her which she knew relating to the letter and
relating to jones.

this poor creature might, indeed, be called simplicity itself. she was
one of that order of mo

rtals who are apt to believe everything which
is said to them; to whom nature hath neither indulged the offensive
nor defensive weapons of deceit, and who are consequently liable to be
imposed upon by any one who will only be at the expense of a little
falshood for that purpose. mrs western, having drained mrs miller of
all she knew, which, indeed, was but little, but which was sufficient
to make the aunt suspect a great deal, dismissed her with assurances
that sophia would not see her, that she would send no answer to the
letter, nor ever receive another; nor did she suffer her to depart
without a handsome lecture on the merits of an office to which she
could afford no better name than that of procuress.--this discovery
had greatly discomposed her temper, when, coming into the apartment
next to that in whi

the confidence to solicit them to speak in the behalf of a man
condemned for the blackest crime in human nature? believe me, i have
no such hope; but i have some reliance on a throne still greatly
superior; which will, i am certain, afford me all the protection i
merit.”

he then concluded with many solemn and vehement protestations of the
truth of what he had at first asserted.

the faith of nightingale was now again staggered, and began to incline
to credit his friend, when mrs miller appeared, and made a sorrowful
report of the success of her embassy; which when jones had heard, he
cried out most heroically, “well, my friend, i am now indifferent as
to what shall happen, at least with regard to my life; and if it be
the will of heaven that i shall make an atonement with that for the
blood i have spilt, i hope the divine goodness will one day suffer my
honour to be cleared, and that the words of a dying man, at least,
will be believed, so far as to justify his character.

s friends,
at which, as few readers would have been pleased to be present, so
few, i believe, will desire to hear it particularly related. we will,
therefore, pass on to the entrance of the turnkey, who acquainted
jones that there was a lady without who desired to speak with him when
he was at leisure.

jones declared his surprize at this message. he said, “he knew no lady
in the world whom he could possibly expect to see there.” however, as
he saw no reason to decline seeing any person, mrs miller and mr
nightingale presently took their leave, and he gave orders to have the
lady admitted.

if jones was surprized at the news of a visit from a lady, how greatly
was he astonished when he discovered this lady to be no other than mrs
waters! in this astonishment then we shall leave him awhile, in order
to cure the surprize of the reader, who will likewise, probably, not a
little wonder at the arrival of this lady.

who this mrs waters was, the reader pretty well knows; what she was,
he must b

hat it ended at last with
perfect innocence, and much more to the satisfaction of jones than of
the lady; for the former was greatly transported with the news she had
brought him; but the latter was not altogether so pleased with the
penitential behaviour of a man whom she had, at her first interview,
conceived a very different opinion of from what she now entertained of
him.

thus the melancholy occasioned by the report of mr nightingale was
pretty well effaced; but the dejection into which mrs miller had
thrown him still continued. the account she gave so well tallied with
the words of sophia herself in her letter, that he made not the least
doubt but that she had disclosed his letter to her aunt, and had taken
a fixed resolution to abandon him. the torments this thought gave him
were to be equalled only by a piece of news which fortune had yet in
store for him, and which we shall communicate in the second chapter of
the ensuing book.

regard each other in
the light of rivals; but nightingale no sooner heard the story than he
exclaimed against the fellow in terms much severer than the justice
and honesty of allworthy had bestowed on him.

allworthy desired nightingale to retain both the money and the secret
till he should hear farther from him; and, if he should in the
meantime see the fellow, that he would not take the least notice to
him of the discovery which he had made. he then returned to his
lodgings, where he found mrs miller in a very dejected condition, on
account of the information she had received from her son-in-law. mr
allworthy, with great chearfulness, told her that he had much good
news to communicate; and, with little further preface, acquainted her
that he had brought mr nightingale to consent to see his son, and did
not in the least doubt to effect a perfect reconciliation between
them; though he found the father more sowered by another accident of
the same kind which had happened in his family. he then 
 
 ___________________________
 
mentioned the
running away of the uncle’s daughter, which he had been told by the
old gentleman, and which mrs miller and her son-in-law did not yet
know.

the reader may suppose mrs miller received this account with great
thankfulness, and no less pleasure; but so uncommon was her friendship
to jones, that i am not certain whether the uneasiness she suffered
for his sake did not overbalance her satisfaction at hearing a piece
of news tending so much to the happiness of her own family; nor
whether even this very news, as it reminded her of the obligations she
had to jones, did not hurt as well as please her; when her grateful
heart said to her, “while my own family is happy, how

e beginning of all this
happiness!”

allworthy, having left her a little while to chew the cud (if i may
use that expression) on these first tidings, told her he had still
something more to impart, which he believed would give her pleasure.
“i think,” said he, “i have discovered a pretty considerable treasure
belonging to the young gentleman, your friend; but perhaps, indeed,
his present situation may be such that it will be of no service to
him.” the latter part of the speech gave mrs miller to understand who
was meant, and she answered with a sigh, “i hope not, sir.” “i hope so
too,” cries allworthy, “with all my heart; but my nephew told me this
morning he had heard a very bad account of the affair.”----“good
heaven! sir,” said she--“well, i must not speak, and yet it is
certainly very hard to be obliged to hold one’s tongue when one
hears.”--“madam,” said allworthy, “you may say whatever you please,
you know me too well to think i have a prejudice aga

inst any one; and
as for that young man, i assure you i should be heartily pleased to
find he could acquit himself of everything, and particularly of this
sad affair. you can testify the affection i have formerly borne him.
the world, i know, censured me for loving him so much. i did not
withdraw that affection from him without thinking i had the justest
cause. believe me, mrs miller, i should be glad to find i have been
mistaken.” mrs miller was going eagerly to reply, when a servant
acquainted her that a gentleman without desired to speak with her
immediately. allworthy then enquired for his nephew, and was told that
he had been for some time in his room with the gentleman who used to
come to him, and whom mr allworthy guessing rightly to be mr dowling,
he desired presently to speak with him.

when dowling attended, allworthy put the case of the bank-notes to
him, without mentioning any name, and asked in what manner such a
person
 
 ___________________________
 
 might be punished. to which dowling answered, “he thought he
might be indicted on the black act; but said, as it was a matter of
some nicety, it would be proper to go to counsel. he said he was to
attend counsel presently upon an affair of mr western’s, and if mr
allworthy pleased he would lay the case before them.” this was agreed
to; and then mrs miller, opening the door, cried, “i ask pardon, i did
not know you had company;” but allworthy desired her to come in,
saying he had finished his business. upon which mr dowling withdrew,
and mrs miller introduced mr nightingale the younger, to return thanks
for the great kindness done him by allworthy: but she had scarce
patience to let the young gentleman finish his speech before she
interrupted him, saying, “o sir! mr nightingale brings great news
about poor mr jones: he hath been to see the 
 
 ___________________________
 
wounded gentleman, who is
out of all danger of death, and, what is more, declares he fell upon
poor mr jones himself, and beat him. i am sure, sir, you would not
have mr jones be a coward. if i was a man myself, i am sure, if any
man was to strike me, i should draw my sword. do pray, my dear, tell
mr allworthy, tell him all yourself.” nightingale then confirmed what
mrs miller had said; and concluded with many handsome things of jones,
who was, he said, one of the best-natured fellows in the world, and
not in the least inclined to be quarrelsome. here nightingale was
going to cease, when mrs miller again begged him to relate all the
many dutiful expressions he had heard him make use of towards mr
allworthy. “to say the utmost good of mr allworthy,” cries
nightingale, “is doing no more than strict justice, and can have no
merit in it: but indeed, i must say, no 
 
 ___________________________
 
lies under. he hath often lamented it to me, and hath as
often protested in the most solemn manner he hath never been
intentionally guilty of any offence towards you; nay, he hath sworn he
would rather die a thousand deaths than he would have his conscience
upbraid him with one disrespectful, ungrateful, or undutiful thought
towards you. but i ask pardon, sir, i am afraid i presume to
intermeddle too far in so tender a point.” “you have spoke no more
than what a christian ought,” cries mrs miller. “indeed, mr
nightingale,” answered allworthy, “i applaud your generous friendship,
and i wish he may merit it of you. i confess i am glad to hear the
report you bring from this unfortunate gentleman; and, if that matter
should turn out to be as you represent it (and, indeed, i doubt
nothing of what you say), i may, perhaps, in time, be brought to think
better than lately i have of this young man; for this good gentlewoman
here, nay, all who know me, can witness that i loved him as dearly

 as
if he had been my own son. indeed, i have considered him as a child
sent by fortune to my care. i still remember the innocent, the
helpless situation in which i found him. i feel the tender pressure of
his little hands at this moment. he was my darling, indeed he was.” at
which words he ceased, and the tears stood in his eyes.

as the answer which mrs miller made may lead us into fresh matters, we
will here stop to account for the visible alteration in mr allworthy’s
mind, and the abatement of his anger to jones. revolutions of this
kind, it is true, do frequently occur in histories and dramatic
writers, for no other reason than because the history or play draws to
a conclusion, and are justified by authority of authors; yet, though
we insist upon as much authority as any author whatever, we shall use
this power very sparingly, and never but when

e could never bring himself to part with a tutor to the
boys, who was, both by learning and industry, extremely well qualified
for his office; and he hoped, that as they were bred up in his own
house, and under his own eye, he should be able to correct whatever
was wrong in thwackum’s instructions.



chapter v.

in which the history is continued.


mr allworthy, in his last speech, had recollected some tender ideas
concerning jones, which had brought tears into the good man’s eyes.
this mrs miller observing, said, “yes, yes, sir, your goodness to this
poor young man is known, notwithstanding all your care to conceal it;
but there is not a single syllable of truth in what those villains
said. mr nightingale hath now discovered the whole matter. it seems
these fellows were employed by a lord, who is a rival of poor mr
jones, to have pressed him on board a ship.--i assure them i don’t
know who they will press next. mr nightingale here hath seen the
officer himself, who is a very pretty

enquire into the
affair.” “i am still in the dark, upon my honour,” said allworthy.
“why then do you tell him, my dear sir,” cries she. “indeed, sir,”
 said nightingale, “i did see that very lawyer who went from you when i
came into the room, at an alehouse in aldersgate, in company with two
of the fellows who were employed by lord fellamar to press mr jones,
and who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between
him and mr fitzpatrick.” “i own, sir,” said mrs miller, “when i saw
this gentleman come into the room to you, i told mr nightingale that i
apprehended you had sent him thither to inquire into the affair.”
 allworthy shewed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this
news, and was indeed for two or three minutes struck dumb by it. at
last, addressing himself to mr nightingale, he said, “i must confess
myself, sir, more surprized at what you tell me than i have ever been
before at anything in my whole life. are you certain this was the
gen

nce the lawyer said little; but, after i
had several times examined the fellows, who persisted in a story
directly contrary to what i had heard from mr jones, and which i find
by mr fitzpatrick was a rank falshood, the lawyer then desired the
fellows to say nothing but what was the truth, and seemed to speak so
much in favour of mr jones, that, when i saw the same person with you,
i concluded your goodness had prompted you to send him thither.”--“and
did you not send him thither?” says mrs miller.--“indeed i did not,”
 answered allworthy; “nor did i know he had gone on such an errand till
this moment.”--“i see it all!” said mrs miller, “upon my soul, i see
it all! no wonder they have been closeted so close lately. son
nightingale, let me beg you run for these fellows immediately----find
them out if they are above-ground. i will go myself”--“dear madam,”
 said allworthy, “be patient, and do me the favour to send a servant
upstairs to call mr dowling hither, if he be
 
 ___________________________
 
 in the house, or, if not,
mr blifil.” mrs miller went out muttering something to herself, and
presently returned with an answer, “that mr dowling was gone; but that
the t’other,” as she called him, “was coming.”

allworthy was of a cooler disposition than the good woman, whose
spirits were all up in arms in the cause of her friend. he was not
however without some suspicions which were near akin to hers. when
blifil came into the room, he asked him with a very serious
countenance, and with a less friendly look than he had ever before
 
 ___________________________
 
 clients on the day of tryal, that
they may be supplyed with proper and ready answers, which the most
fertile invention cannot supply in an instant. besides, the sudden and
violent impulse on the blood, occasioned by these surprizes, causes
frequently such an alteration in the countenance, that the man is
obliged to give evidence against himself. and such indeed were the
alterations which the countenance of blifil underwent from this sudden
question, that we can scarce blame the eagerness of mrs miller, who
immediately cryed out, “guilty, upon my honour! guilty, upon my soul!”

mr allworthy sharply rebuked her for this impetuosity; and then
turning to blifil, who seemed sinking into the earth, he said, “why do
you hesitate, sir, at giving me an answer? you certainly must have
employed him; for he would not, of his own accord, i believe, have
undertaken such an errand, and especially without acquainting me.”

blifil then answered, “i own, sir, i have been guilty of an offence,
yet ma
 
 ___________________________
 
g,
not on a vain and fruitless enquiry, but to discover the witnesses,
and to endeavour to soften their evidence. this, sir, is the truth;
which, though i intended to conceal from you, i will not deny.”

“i confess,” said nightingale, “this is the light in which it appeared
to me from the gentleman’s behaviour.”

“now, madam,” said allworthy, “i believe you will once in your life
own you have entertained a wrong suspicion, and are not so angry with
my nephew as you was.”

mrs miller was silent; for, though she could not so hastily be pleased
with blifil, whom she looked upon to have been the ruin of jones, yet
in this particular instance he had imposed upon her as well as upon
the rest; so entirely had the devil stood his friend. and, indeed, i
look upon the vulgar observation, “that the devil often deserts his
friends, and leaves them in the lurch,” to be a great abuse on that
gentleman’s character. perhaps he may sometimes desert those who are
only his cup acquaint
 
 ___________________________
 
ter suspicion, the
lesser, which had been raised by square’s letter, sunk of course, and
was forgotten; and thwackum, with whom he was greatly offended, bore
alone all the reflections which square had cast on the enemies of
jones.

as for that young man, the resentment of mr allworthy began more and
more to abate towards him. he told blifil, “he did not only forgive
the extraordinary efforts of his good-nature, but would give him the
pleasure of following his example.” then, turning to mrs miller with a
smile which would have become an angel, he cryed, “what say you,
madam? shall we take a hackney-coach, and all of us together pay a
visit to your friend? i promise you it is not the first visit i have
made in a prison.”

every reader, i believe, will be able to answer for the worthy woman;
but they must have a great deal of good-nature, and be well acquainted
with friendship, who can feel what she felt on this occasion. few, i
hope, are capable of feeling what now passed in the mind 
 
 ___________________________
 
of blifil;
but those who are will acknowledge that it was impossible for him to
raise any objection to this visit. fortune, however, or the gentleman
lately mentioned above, stood his friend, and prevented his undergoing
so great a shock; for at the very instant when the coach was sent for,
partridge arrived, and, having called mrs miller from the company,
acquainted her with the dreadful accident lately come to light; and
hearing mr allworthy’s intention, begged her to find some means of
stopping him: “for,” says he, “the matter must at all hazards be kept
a secret from him; and if he should now go, he will find mr jones and
his mother, who arrived just as i left him, lamenting over one another
the horrid crime they have ignorantly committed.”

the poor woman, who was almost deprived of her senses at his dreadful
news
 
 ___________________________
 
 of spirits; and now, sir,
should we all on a sudden fling him into such a violent fit of joy, as
i know your presence will occasion, it may, i am afraid, produce some
fatal mischief, especially as his servant, who is without, tells me he
is very far from being well.”

“is his servant without?” cries allworthy; “pray call him hither. i
will ask him some questions concerning his master.”

partridge was at first afraid to appear before mr allworthy; but was
at length persuaded, after mrs miller, who had often heard his whole
story from his own mouth, had promised to introduce him.

allworthy recollected partridge the moment he came into the room,
though many years had passed since he had seen him. mrs miller,
therefore, might have spared here a formal oration, in which, indeed,
she was something prolix; for the reader, i believe, may have observed
already that the good woman, among other things, had a tongue always
ready for the service of her friends.

“and are you,” said allwort
 
 ___________________________
 
our honour, at present. _non sum qualis
eram_, as your honour very well knows.”

mr allworthy then asked him many questions concerning jones, as to his
health, and other matters; to all which partridge answered, without
having the least regard to what was, but considered only what he would
have things appear; for a strict adherence to truth was not among the
articles of this honest fellow’s morality or his religion.

during this dialogue mr nightingale took his leave, and presently
after mrs miller left the room, when allworthy likewise despatched
blifil; for he imagined that partridge when alone with him would be
more explicit than before company. they were no sooner left in private
together than allworthy began, as in the following chapter.



chapter vi.

in which the history is farther continued


“sure, friend,” said the good man, “you are the strangest of all human
beings. not only to have suffered as you have formerly for obstinately
persisting in a falshood, but to persist i

fact which i think it would be
rather your interest to own?” “nay, sir,” answered partridge (for he
could hold no longer), “if your honour will not believe me, you are
like soon to have satisfaction enough. i wish you had mistaken the
mother of this young man, as well as you have his father.”--and now
being asked what he meant, with all the symptoms of horror, both in
his voice and countenance, he told allworthy the whole story, which he
had a little before expressed such desire to mrs miller to conceal
from him.

allworthy was almost as much shocked at this discovery as partridge
himself had been while he related it. “good heavens!” says he, “in
what miserable distresses do vice and imprudence involve men! how much
beyond our designs are the effects of wickedness sometimes carried!”
 he had scarce uttered these words, when mrs waters came hastily and
abruptly into the room. partridge no sooner saw her than he cried,
“here, sir, here is the very woman herself. this is the

fore, extorted from him, who was besides taken unawares, and
had no time to consider of evasions.

allworthy appeared well satisfied with this relation, and, having
enjoined on dowling strict silence as to what had past, conducted that
gentleman himself to the door, lest he should see blifil, who was
returned to his chamber, where he exulted in the thoughts of his last
deceit on his uncle, and little suspected what had since passed
below-stairs.

as allworthy was returning to his room he met mrs miller in the entry,
who, with a face all pale and full of terror, said to him, “o! sir, i
find this wicked woman hath been with you, and you know all; yet do
not on this account abandon the poor young man. consider, sir, he was
ignorant it was his own mother; and the discovery itself will most
probably break his heart, without your unkindness.”

“madam,” says allworthy, “i am under such an astonishment at what i
have heard, that i am really unable to satisfy you; but come with me
into my ro
 
 ___________________________
 
om. indeed, mrs miller, i have made surprizing discoveries,
and you shall soon know them.”

the poor woman followed him trembling; and now allworthy, going up to
mrs waters, took her by the hand, and then, turning to mrs miller,
said, “what reward shall i bestow upon this gentlewoman, for the
services she hath done me?--o! mrs miller, you have a thousand times
heard me call the young man to whom you are so faithful a friend, my
son. little did i then think he was indeed related to me at all.--your
friend, madam, is my nephew; he is the brother of that wicked viper
which i have so long nourished in my bosom.--she will herself tell you
the whole story, and how the youth came to pass for her son. indeed,
mrs miller, i am convinced that he hath been wronged, and that i have
been abused; abused by one whom you too justly suspect
 
 ___________________________
 
ed of being a
villain. he is, in truth, the worst of villains.”

the joy which mrs miller now felt bereft her of the power of speech,
and might perhaps have deprived her of her senses, if not of life, had
not a friendly shower of tears come seasonably to her relief. at
length, recovering so far from her transport as to be able to speak,
she cried, “and is my dear mr jones then your nephew, sir, and not the
son of this lady? and are your eyes opened to him at last? and shall i
live to see him as happy as he deserves?” “he certainly is my nephew,”
 says allworthy, “and i hop
 
 ___________________________
 
 a whore of a lord. i vound ‘em together at
my cousin my lady bellaston’s. he hath turned the head o’ her, that’s
certain--but d--n me if he shall ha her--i’ll ha no lords nor
courtiers in my vamily.”

allworthy now made a long speech, in which he repeated his resolution
to avoid all violent measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle
methods to mr western, as those by which he might be assured of
succeeding best with his daughter. he then took his leave, and
returned back to mrs miller, but was forced to comply with the earnest
entreaties of the squire, in promising to bring mr jones to visit him
that afternoon, that he might, as he said, “make all matters up with
the young gentleman.” at mr allworthy’s departure, western promised to
follow his advice in his behaviour to sophia, saying, “i don’t know
how ‘tis, but d--n me, allworthy, if you don’t make me always do just
as you please; and yet i have as good an estate as you, and am in the
commission of the peace 
 
 ___________________________
 
ours. o, my dear uncle! i find my follies are irretrievable;
and all your goodness cannot save me from perdition.”

a servant now acquainted them that mr western was below-stairs; for
his eagerness to see jones could not wait till the afternoon. upon
which jones, whose eyes were full of tears, begged his uncle to
entertain western a few minutes, till he a little recovered himself;
to which the good man consented, and, having ordered mr western to be
shewn into a parlour, went down to him.

mrs miller no sooner heard that jones was alone (for she had not yet
seen him since his release from prison) than she came eagerly into the
room, and, advancing towards jones, wished him heartily joy of his
new-found uncle and his happy reconciliation; adding, “i wish i could
give you joy on another account, my dear child; but anything so
inexorable i never saw.”

jones, with some appearance of surprize, asked her what she meant.
“why then,” says she, “i have been with your young lady, and have

and she, `i had discovered great goodness of heart in mr jones; and
for that i own i had a sincere esteem; but an entire profligacy of
manners will corrupt the best heart in the world; and all which a
good-natured libertine can expect is, that we should mix some grains
of pity with our contempt and abhorrence.’ she is an angelic creature,
that is the truth on’t.” “o, mrs miller!” answered jones, “can i bear
to think that i have lost such an angel?” “lost! no,” cries mrs
miller; “i hope you have not lost her yet. resolve to leave such
vicious courses, and you may yet have hopes, nay, if she would remain
inexorable, there is another young lady, a sweet pretty young lady,
and a swinging fortune, who is absolutely dying for love of you. i

the conversation which now ensued was pleasant enough; and with which,
had it happened earlier in our history, we would have entertained our
reader; but as we have now leisure only to attend to what is very
material, it shall suffice to say that matters being entirely adjusted
as to the afternoon visit mr western again returned home.



chapter xi.

the history draws nearer to a conclusion.


when mr western was departed, jones began to inform mr allworthy and
mrs miller that his liberty had been procured by two noble lords, who,
together with two surgeons and a friend of mr nightingale’s, had
attended the magistrate by whom he had been committed, and by whom, on
the surgeons’ oaths, that the wounded person was out of all manner of
danger from his wound, he was discharged.

one only of these lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no
more than once; but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his
pardon for an offence he had been guilty of t

dispositions to injustice; but insults proceed only from black and
rancorous minds, and have no temptations to excuse them. let me
beseech you, sir, to do nothing by him in the present height of your
anger. consider, my dear uncle, i was not myself condemned unheard.”
 allworthy stood silent a moment, and then, embracing jones, he said,
with tears gushing from his eyes, “o my child! to what goodness have i
been so long blind!”

mrs miller entering the room at that moment, after a gentle rap which
was not perceived, and seeing jones in the arms of his uncle, the poor
woman in an agony of joy fell upon her knees, and burst forth into the
most ecstatic thanksgivings to heaven for what had happened; then,
running to jones, she embraced him eagerly, crying, “my dearest
friend, i wish you joy a thousand and a thousand times of this blest
day.” and next mr allworthy himself received the same congratulations.
to which he answered,

indeed, indeed, mrs miller, i am beyond
expression happy.” some few more raptures having passed on all sides,
mrs miller desired them both to walk down to dinner in the parlour,
where she said there were a very happy set of people assembled--being
indeed no other than mr nightingale and his bride, and his cousin
harriet with her bridegroom.

allworthy excused himself from dining with the company, saying he had
ordered some little thing for him and his nephew in his own apartment,
for that they had much private business to discourse of; but would not
resist promising the good woman that both he and jones would mak

mrs miller then asked what was to be done with blifil? “for indeed,”
 says she, “i cannot be easy while such a villain is in my
house.”--allworthy answered, “he was as uneasy as herself on the same
account.” “oh!” cries she, “if that be the case, leave the matter to
me, i’ll soon show him the outside out of my doors, i warrant you.
here are two or three lusty fellows below-stairs.” “there will be no
need of any violence,” cries allworthy; “if you will carry him a
message from m

 “will i?” said mrs miller; “i never did anything in my life with a
better will.” here jones interfered, and said, “he had considered the
matter better, and would, if mr allworthy pleased, be himself the
messenger. i know,” says he, “already enough of your pleasure, sir,
and i beg leave to acquaint him with it by my own words. let me
beseech you, sir,” added he, “to reflect on the dreadful consequences
of driving him to violent and sudden despair. how unfit, alas! is this

ation.” this suggestion had not the
least effect on mrs miller. she left the room, crying, “you are too
good, mr jones, infinitely too good to live in this world.” but it
made a deeper impression on allworthy. “my good child,” said he, “i am
equally astonished at the goodness of your heart, and the quickness of
your understanding. heaven indeed forbid that this wretch should be
deprived of any means or time for repentance! that would be a shocking
consideration indeed. go to him, therefore, and use your own
discretion; yet do not flatter him with

partly to turn the discourse from the subject which she knew well
enough he was endeavouring to open, said--

“sure, sir, you are the most fortunate man in the world in this
discovery.” “and can you really, madam, think me so fortunate,” said
jones, sighing, “while i have incurred your displeasure?”--“nay, sir,”
 says she, “as to that you best know whether you have deserved it.”
 “indeed, madam,” answered he, “you yourself are as well apprized of
all my demerits. mrs miller hath acquainted you with the whole truth.
o! my sophia, am i never to hope for forgiveness?”--“i think, mr
jones,” said she, “i may almost depend on your own justice, and leave
it to yourself to pass sentence on your own conduct.”--“alas! madam,”
 answered he, “it is mercy, and not justice, which i implore at your
hands. justice i know must condemn me.--yet not for the letter i sent
to lady bellaston. of that i most solemnly declare you have had a true
account.” he then insist

out the government of their children, both heartily
despising the method which each other took. each of them therefore now
endeavoured, as much as he could, to palliate the offence which his
own child had committed, and to aggravate the match of the other. this
desire of triumphing over his brother, added to the many arguments
which allworthy had used, so strongly operated on the old gentleman
that he met his son with a smiling countenance, and actually agreed to
sup with him that evening at mrs miller’s.

as for the other, who really loved his daughter with the most
immoderate affection, there was little difficulty in inclining him to
a reconciliation. he was no sooner informed by his nephew where his
daughter and her husband were, than he declared he would instantly go
to her. and when he arrived there he scarce suffered her to fall upon
her knees before he took her up, and embraced her with a tenderness
which affected all who saw him; and in less than a quarter of an hour
was as well rec

onciled to both her and her husband as if he had
himself joined their hands.

in this situation were affairs when mr allworthy and his company
arrived to complete the happiness of mrs miller, who no sooner saw
sophia than she guessed everything that had happened; and so great was
her friendship to jones, that it added not a few transports to those
she felt on the happiness of her own daughter.

there have not, i believe, been many instances of a number of people
met together, where every one was so perfectly happy as in this
company. amongst whom the father of young nightingale enjoyed the
least perfect content; for, notwithstanding his affection for his son,
notwithstanding the au

his son’s choice; and, perhaps, the presence of sophia
herself tended a little to aggravate and heighten his concern, as a
thought now and then suggested itself that his son might have had that
lady, or some other such. not that any of the charms which adorned
either the person or mind of sophia created the uneasiness; it was the
contents of her father’s coffers which set his heart a longing. these
were the charms which he could not bear to think his son had
sacrificed to the daughter of mrs miller.

the brides were both very pretty women; but so totally were they
eclipsed by the beauty of sophia, that, had they not been two of the
best-tempered girls in the world, it would have raised some envy in
their breasts; for neither of their husbands could long keep his eyes
from sophia, who sat at the table like a queen receiving homage, or,
rather, like a superior being receiving adoration from all around her.
but it was an adoration which they gave, not which she exacted; for
she was as much d

sophia, who was now in private become a bride too, officiated as the
mistress of the ceremonies, or, in the polite phrase, did the honours
of the table. she had that morning given her hand to jones, in the
chapel at doctors’-commons, where mr allworthy, mr western, and mrs
miller, were the only persons present.

sophia had earnestly desired her father that no others of the company,
who were that day to dine with him, should be acquainted with her
marriage. the same secrecy was enjoined to mrs miller, and jones
undertook for allworthy. this somewhat reconciled the delicacy of
sophia to the public entertainment which, in compliance with her
father’s will, she was obliged to go to, greatly against her own
inclinations. in confidence of this secrecy she went through the day
pretty well, till the squire, who was now advanced into the second
bottle, could contain his joy no longer, but, filling out a bumper,
drank a health to the bride. the health was immediately pledged by all
present, to the

 great confusion of our poor blushing sophia, and the
great concern of jones upon her account. to say truth, there was not a
person present made wiser by this discovery; for mrs miller had
whispered it to her daughter, her daughter to her husband, her husband
to his sister, and she to all the rest.

sophia now took the first opportunity of withdrawing with the ladies,
and the squire sat in to his cups, in which he was, by degrees,
deserted by all the company except the uncle of young nightingale, who
loved his bottle as well as western himself. these two, therefore, sat
stoutly to it during the whole evening, and long after that happy hour
which had surrendered the charming s
