  orlando. as i remember, adam, it was upon this fashion bequeathed
    me by will but poor a thousand crowns, and, as thou say'st,
    charged my brother, on his blessing, to breed me well; and there
    begins my sadness. my brother jaques he keeps at school, and
    report speaks goldenly of his profit. for my part, he keeps me
    rustically at home, or, to speak more properly, stays me here at
    home unkept; for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my
    birth t

enance seems to take from
    me. he lets me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
    brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my
    education. this is it, adam, that grieves me; and the spirit of
    my father, which i think is within me, begins to mutiny against
    this servitude. i will no longer endure it, though yet i know no
    wise remedy how to avoid it.

  adam. yonder comes my master, your brother.

  orlando. go apart, adam, and thou shalt hear how he will shake me

  oliver. now, sir! what make you here?

  orlando. nothing; i am not taught to make any thing.

  oliver. what mar you then, sir?

  orlando. marry, sir, i am helping you to mar that which god made, a
    poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

  oliver. marry, sir, be better employed, and be nought awhile.

  oliver. know you where you are, sir?

  orlando. o, sir, very well; here in your orchard.

  oliver. know you before whom, sir?

  orlando. ay, better than him i am before knows me. i know you are
    my eldest brother; and in the gentle condition of blood, you
    should so know me. the courtesy of nations allows you my better
    in that you are the first-born; but the same tradition takes not
    away my blood, were there twenty brothers betwixt us. i have as
    much of my father in me as you, albeit i confess your coming
    before me is nearer to his reverence.

  oliver. what, boy!                               [str

  orlando. come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

  oliver. wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

  orlando. i am no villain; i am the youngest son of sir rowland de
    boys. he was my father; and he is thrice a villain that says such
    a father begot villains. wert thou not my brother, i would not
    take this hand from thy throat till this other had pull'd out thy
    tongue for saying so. thou has rail'd on thyself.

  adam. [coming forward] sweet masters, be patient; for your father's
    remembrance, be at accord.

  oliver. let me go, i say.

ing from me all
    gentleman-like qualities. the spirit of my father grows strong in
    me, and i will no longer endure it; therefore allow me such
    exercises as may become a gentleman, or give me the poor
    allottery my father left me by testament; with that i will go buy
    my fortunes.

  oliver. and what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent? well, sir,
    get you in. i will not long be troubled with you; you shall have
    some part of your will. i pray you leave me.

  orlando. i no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

  oliver. get you with him, you old dog.

  adam. is 'old dog' my reward? most true, i have lost my teeth in
    your service. god be with my old master! he would not have spoke
    such a word.

  charles. they say he is already in the forest of arden, and a many
    merry men with him; and there they live like the old robin hood
    of england. they say many young gentlemen flock to him every day,
    and fleet the time carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

  oliver. what, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?

  charles. marry, do i, sir; and i came to acquaint you with a
    matter. i am given, sir, secretly to understand that your younger
    brother, orlando, hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against
    me to try a fall. to-morrow, sir, i wrestle for my credit; and he
    that escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him well.
    your brother is but young and tender; and, for your love, i would
    be loath to foil him, as i must, for my own honour, if he come
    in; therefore, out of my love to you, i came hither to acquaint
    you withal, that either you might stay him from his intendment,
    or brook such disgrace well

  celia. or i, i promise thee.

  rosalind. but is there any else longs to see this broken music in
    his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?
    shall we see this wrestling, cousin?

  le beau. you must, if you stay here; for here is the place
    appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to perform it.

  celia. yonder, sure, they are coming. let us now stay and see it.

  frederick. come on; since the youth will not be entreated, his own
    peril on his forwardness.

  rosalind. is yonder the man?

  le beau. even he, madam.

  celia. alas, he is too young; yet he looks successfully.

  frederick. how now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither to
    see the wrestling?

  rosalind. ay, my liege; so please you give us leave.

  frederick. you will take little delight in it, i can tell you,

    there is such odds in the man. in pity of the challenger's youth
    i would fain dissuade him, but he will not be entreated.
    speak to him, ladies; see if you can move him.

  celia. call him hither, good monsieur le beau.

  frederick. do so; i'll not be by.

  orlando. i attend them with all respect and duty.

  rosalind. young man, have you challeng'd charles the wrestler?

  orlando. no, fair princess; he is the general challenger. i come
    but in, as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth.

  celia. young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your years.
    you have seen cruel proof of this man's strength; if you saw
    yourself with your eyes, or knew yourself with your judgment, the
    fear of your adventure would counsel

    safety and give over this attempt.

  rosalind. do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore be
    misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke that the
    wrestling might not go forward.

  orlando. i beseech you, punish me not with your hard thoughts,
    wherein i confess me much guilty to deny so fair and excellent
    ladies any thing. but let your fair eyes and gentle wishes go
    with me to my trial; wherein if i be foil'd there is but one
    sham'd that was never gracious; if kill'd, but one dead that is
    willing to be so. i shall do my friends no wrong, for i have none
    to lament me; the world no injury, for in it i have nothing; only

    lie with his mother earth?

  frederick. you shall try but one fall.

  charles. no, i warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him to a
    second, that have so mightily persuaded him from a first.

  orlando. you mean to mock me after; you should not have mock'd me
    before; but come your ways.

my father, coz, would i do this?

  orlando. i am more proud to be sir rowland's son,
    his youngest son- and would not change that calling
    to be adopted heir to frederick.

  rosalind. my father lov'd sir rowland as his soul,
    and all the world was of my father's mind;
    had i before known this young man his son,
    i should have given him tears unto entreaties
    ere he should thus have ventur'd.

  orlando. can i not say 'i thank you'? my better parts
    are all thrown down; and that which here stands up
    is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.

  rosalind. he calls us back. my pride fell with my fortunes;
    i'll ask him what he would. did you call, sir?
    sir, you have wrestled well, and overthrown
    more than your enemies.

    are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
    but i can tell you that of late this duke

    grounded upon no other argument
    but that the people praise her for her virtues
    and pity her for her good father's sake;
    and, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
    will suddenly break forth. sir, fare you well.
    hereafter, in a better world than this,
    i shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

 a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in despite of

    into so strong a liking with old sir rowland's youngest son?

  rosalind. the duke my father lov'd his father dearly.

  celia. doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son dearly?
    by this kind of chase i should hate him, for my father hated his
    father dearly; yet i hate not orlando.

    proper?

  rosalind. by no means, sir. time travels in divers paces with
    divers persons. i'll tell you who time ambles withal, who time

    the length of seven year.

    i have heard him read many lectures against it; and i thank god i

    hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal.

    to the charge of women?

  rosalind. there were none principal; they were all like one another
    as halfpence are; every one fault seeming monstrous till his
    fellow-fault came to match it.

  orlando. i prithee recount some of them.

    upon him.

  rosalind. there is none of my uncle's marks upon you; he taught me
    how to know a man in love; in which cage of rushes i am sure you
    are not prisoner.

  rosalind. a lean cheek, which you have not; a blue eye and sunken,
    which you have not; an unquestionable spirit, which you have not;
    a beard neglected, which you have not; but i pardon you for that,
    for simply your having in beard is a younger brother's revenue.

  orlando. neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.

  rosalind. love is merely a madness; and, i tell you, deserves as
    well a dark house and a whip as madmen do; and the reason why
    they are not so punish'd and cured is that the lunacy is so
    ordinary that the whippers are in love too. yet i profess curing
    it by counsel.

  orlando. did you ever cure any so?

  rosalind. yes, one; and in this manner. he was to imagine me his
    love, his mistress; and i set him every day to woo me; at which
    time would i, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be effeminate,
    changeable, longing and liking, proud, fantastical, apish,
    shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles; for every

    upon me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's heart,

    words, swears brave oaths, and breaks them bravely, quite

  rosalind. why, horns; which such as you are fain to be beholding to

    i know not the contents; but, as i guess

    which she did use as she was writing of it,
    it bears an angry tenour. pardon me,

    such garments, and such years: 'the boy is fair,
    of female favour, and bestows himself
    like a ripe sister; the woman low,
    and browner than her brother.' are not you
    the owner of the house i did inquire for?

  celia. it is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.

    this handkercher was stain'd.

  chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
    lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
    and mark what object did present itself.
    under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age,
    and high top bald with dry antiquity,
    a wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
    lay sleeping on his back. about his neck
    a green and gilded snake had wreath'd itself,
    who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
    the opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
    seeing orlando, it unlink'd itself,
    and with indented glides did slip away
    into a bush; under which bush's shade
    a lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
    lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
    when that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
    the royal disposition of that beast
    to prey on nothing that doth seem as dead.
    this seen, orlando did approach the man,
    and found it was his brother, his elder brother.

  celia. o, i have heard him speak of that same

    and he did render him the most unnatural
    that liv'd amongst men.

  oliver. and well he might so do,
    for well i know he was unnatural.

  rosalind. but, to orlando: did he leave him there,
    food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?

  oliver. twice did he turn his back, and purpos'd so;
    but kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
    and nature, stronger than his just occasion,
    made him give battle to the lioness,
    who quickly fell before him; in which hurtling
    from miserable slumber i awak'd.

  celia. are you his brother?

    if you do love rosalind so near the heart as your gesture cries

    i know into what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is not
    impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient to you, to set
