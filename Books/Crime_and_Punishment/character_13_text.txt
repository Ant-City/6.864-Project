â€œi am the messenger from our office, from the merchant shelopaev, and iâ€™ve come on business.â€
â€œplease sit down.â€ razumihin seated himself on the other side of the table. â€œitâ€™s a good thing youâ€™ve come to, brother,â€ he went on to raskolnikov. â€œfor the last four days you have scarcely eaten or drunk anything. we had to give you tea in spoonfuls. i brought zossimov to see you twice. you remember zossimov? he examined you carefully and said at once it was nothing seriousâ€”something seemed to have gone to your head. some nervous nonsense, the result of bad feeding, he says you have not had enough beer and radish, but itâ€™s nothing much, it will pass and you will be all right. zossimov is a first-rate fellow! he is making quite a name. come, i wonâ€™t keep you,â€ he said, addressing the man again. â€œwill you explain what you want? you must know, rodya, t

ll gazed wildly with strained attention. meanwhile razumihin sat down on the sofa beside him, as clumsily as a bear put his left arm round raskolnikovâ€™s head, although he was able to sit up, and with his right hand gave him a spoonful of soup, blowing on it that it might not burn him. but the soup was only just warm. raskolnikov swallowed one spoonful greedily, then a second, then a third. but after giving him a few more spoonfuls of soup, razumihin suddenly stopped, and said that he must ask zossimov whether he ought to have more.
nastasya came in with two bottles of beer.
â€œand will you have tea?â€
â€œyes.â€
â€œcut along, nastasya, and bring some tea, for tea we may venture on without the faculty. but here is the beer!â€ he moved back to his chair, pulled the soup and meat in front of him, and began eating as though he had not touched food for three days.

â€œhe calls her pashenka! ah, heâ€™s a deep one!â€ said nastasya as he went out; then she opened the door and stood listening, but could not resist running downstairs after him. she was very eager to hear what he would say to the landlady

â€œwhat time is it?â€ asked raskolnikov, looking round uneasily.
â€œyes, you had a fine sleep, brother, itâ€™s almost evening, it will be six oâ€™clock directly. you have slept more than six hours.â€
â€œgood heavens! have i?â€
â€œand why not? it will do you good. whatâ€™s the hurry? a tryst, is it? weâ€™ve all time before us. iâ€™ve been waiting for the last three hours for you; iâ€™ve been up twice and found you asleep. iâ€™ve called on zossimov twice; not at home, only fancy! but no matter, he will turn up. and iâ€™ve been out on my own business, too. you know iâ€™ve been moving to-day, moving with my uncle. i have an uncle living with me now. but thatâ€™s no matter, to business. give me the parcel, nastasya. we will open it directly. and how do you feel now, brother?â€
â€œi am quite well, i am not ill. razumihin, have you been here long?â€

â€œmoney? why, your own, what the messenger brought from vahrushin, your mother sent it. have you forgotten that, too?â€
â€œi remember now,â€ said raskolnikov after a long, sullen silence. razumihin looked at him, frowning and uneasy.
the door opened and a tall, stout man whose appearance seemed familiar to raskolnikov came in.




chapter iv

zossimov was a tall, fat man with a puffy, colourless, clean-shaven face and straight flaxen hair. he wore spectacles, and a big gold ring on his fat finger. he was twenty-seven. he had on a light grey fashionable loose coat, light summer trousers, and everything about him loose, fashionable and spick and span; his linen was irreproachable, his watch-chain was massive. in manner he was slow and, as it were, nonchalant, and at the same time studiously free and easy; he made efforts to conceal his self-im

â€œiâ€™ve been to you twice to-day, brother. you see, heâ€™s come to himself,â€ cried razumihin.
â€œi see, i see; and how do we feel now, eh?â€ said zossimov to raskolnikov, watching him carefully and, sitting down at the foot of the sofa, he settled himself as comfortably as he could.
â€œhe is still depressed,â€ razumihin went on. â€œweâ€™ve just changed his linen and he almost cried.â€
â€œthatâ€™s very natural; you might have put it off if he did not wish it.... his pulse is first-rate. is your head still aching, eh?â€
â€œi am well, i am perfectly well!â€ raskolnikov declared positively and irritably. he raised himself on the sofa and looked a

â€œvery good.... going on all right,â€ he said lazily. â€œhas he eaten anything?â€
they told him, and asked what he might have.
â€œhe may have anything... soup, tea... mushrooms and cucumbers, of course, you must not give him; heâ€™d better not have meat either, and... but no need to tell you that!â€ razumihin and he looked at each other. â€œno more medicine or anything. iâ€™ll look at him again to-morrow. perhaps, to-day even... but never mind...â€

â€œi would not disturb him to-morrow at all, but i donâ€™t know... a little, maybe... but weâ€™ll see.â€
â€œach, what a nuisance! iâ€™ve got a house-warming party to-night; itâ€™s only a step from here. couldnâ€™t he come? he could lie on the sofa. you are coming?â€ razumihin said to zossimov. â€œdonâ€™t forget, you promised.â€
â€œall right, only rather later. what are you going to do?â€
â€œoh, nothingâ€”tea, vodka, herrings. there will be a pie... just our friends.â€
â€œand who?â€
â€œall neighbours here, almost all new friends, except my old uncle, and he is new tooâ€”he only arrived in petersburg yesterday to see to some business of his. we meet once in five years.â€

â€œi donâ€™t care a damn for him.â€
â€œso much the better. well, there will be some students, a teacher, a government clerk, a musician, an officer and zametov.â€

â€œoh, you particular gentleman! principles! you are worked by principles, as it were by springs; you wonâ€™t venture to turn round on your own account. if a man is a nice fellow, thatâ€™s the only principle i go upon. zametov is a delightful person.â€

raskolnikov turned to the wall where in the dirty, yellow paper he picked out one clumsy, white flower with brown lines on it and began examining how many petals there were in it, how many scallops in the petals and how many lines on them. he felt his arms and legs as lifeless as though they had been cut off. he did not attempt to move, but stared obstinately at the flower.
â€œbut what about the painter?â€ zossimov interrupted nastasyaâ€™s chatter with marked displeasure. she sighed and was silent.
â€œwhy, he was accused of the murder,â€ razumihin went on hotly.
â€œwas there evidence against him then?â€
â€œevidence, indeed! evidence that was no evidence, and thatâ€™s what we have to prove. it was just as they pitched on those fellows, koch and pestryakov, at first. foo! how stupidly itâ€™s all done, it makes one sick, though itâ€™s not oneâ€™s business! pestryakov may be coming to-night.... by the way,

zossimov looked curiously at raskolnikov. he did not stir.
â€œbut i say, razumihin, i wonder at you. what a busybody you are!â€ zossimov observed.
â€œmaybe i am, but we will get him off anyway,â€ shouted razumihin, bringing his fist down on the table. â€œwhatâ€™s the most offensive is not their lyingâ€”one can always forgive lyingâ€”lying is a delightful thing, for it leads to truthâ€”what is offensive is that they lie and worship their own lying.... i respect porfiry, but... what threw them out at first? the door was locked, and when they came back with the porter it was open. so it followed that koch and pestryakov were the m

â€œi should think so,â€ said zossimov.
â€œwait! hear the end. of course they sought high and low for nikolay; they detained dushkin and searched his house; dmitri, too, was arrested; the kolomensky men also were turned inside out. and the day before yesterday they arrested nikolay in a tavern at the end of the town. he had gone there, taken the silver cross off his neck and asked for a dram for it. they gave it to him. a few minutes afterwards the woman went to the cowshed, and through a crack in the wall she saw in the stable adjo

â€œwell, anyway, thereâ€™s the evidence.â€
â€œi am not talking of the evidence now, i am talking about that question, of their own idea of themselves. well, so they squeezed and squeezed him and he confessed: â€˜i did not find it in the street, but in the flat where i was painting with dmitri.â€™ â€˜and how was that?â€™ â€˜why, dmitri and i w

â€œyes... why? whatâ€™s the matter? whatâ€™s wrong?â€ razumihin, too, got up from his seat.
â€œnothing,â€ raskolnikov answered faintly, turning to the wall. all were silent for a while.
â€œhe must have waked from a dream,â€ razumihin said at last, looking inquiringly at zossimov. the latter slightly shook his head.
â€œwell, go on,â€ said zossimov. â€œwhat next?â€
â€œwhat next? as soon as he saw the ear-rings, forgetting dmitri and everything, he took up his cap and ran to dushkin and, as we know, got a rouble from him. he told a lie saying he found them in the street, and went off drinking. he keeps repeating his old story about the murder: â€˜i know nothing of it, never heard of it till the day before yesterday.â€™ â€˜and why didnâ€™t you come to the police till now

gure and unshaven face of razumihin, who looked him boldly and inquiringly in the face without rising from his seat. a constrained silence lasted for a couple of minutes, and then, as might be expected, some scene-shifting took place. reflecting, probably from certain fairly unmistakable signs, that he would get nothing in this â€œcabinâ€ by attempting to overawe them, the gentleman softened somewhat, and civilly, though with some severity, emphasising every syllable of his question, addressed zossimov:
â€œrodion romanovitch raskolnikov, a student, or formerly a student?â€
zossimov made a slight movement, and would have answered, had not razumihin anticipated him.
â€œhere he is lying on the sofa! what do you want?â€
this familiar â€œwhat do you wantâ€ seemed to cut the ground from the feet of the pompous gentleman. he was turning to razumihin, but checked himself in time and turned to zossimov again.
â€œthis is raskolnikov,â€ mumbled zossimov, nodding towards him. then he gave a prolonged

raskolnikov himself lay without speaking, on his back, gazing persistently, though without understanding, at the stranger. now that his face was turned away from the strange flower on the paper, it was extremely pale and wore a look of anguish, as though he had just undergone an agonising operation or just been taken from the rack. but the new-comer gradually began to arouse his attention, then his wonder, then suspicion and even alarm. when zossimov said â€œthis is raskolnikovâ€ he jumped up quickly, sat on the sofa and with an almost defiant, but weak and breaking, voice articulated:
â€œyes, i am raskolnikov! what do you want?â€
the visitor scrutinised him and pronounced impressively:
â€œpyotr petrovitch luzhin. i believe i have reason to hope that my name is not wholly unknown to you?â€
but raskolnikov, who had expected something quite different, gazed blankly and dreamily at him, making no reply, as though he heard the name of pyotr

â€œis it possible that you can up to the present have received no information?â€ asked pyotr petrovitch, somewhat disconcerted.
in reply raskolnikov sank languidly back on the pillow, put his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling. a look of dismay came into luzhinâ€™s face. zossimov and razumihin stared at him more inquisitively than ever, and at last he showed unmistakable signs of embarrassment.
â€œi had presumed and calculated,â€ he faltered, â€œthat a letter posted more than ten days, if not a fortnight ago...â€
â€œi say, why are you standing in the doorway?â€ razumihin interrupted suddenly. â€œif youâ€™ve something to say, sit down. nastasya and you are so crowded. nastasya, make room. hereâ€™s a chair, thread your way in!â€

â€œno need to be nervous,â€ the latter blurted out. â€œrodya has been ill for the last five days and delirious for three, but now he is recovering and has got an appetite. this is his doctor, who has just had a look at him. i am a comrade of rodyaâ€™s, like him, formerly a student, and now i am nursing him; so donâ€™t you take any notice of us, but go on with your business.â€
â€œthank you. but shall i not disturb the invalid by my presence and conversation?â€ pyotr petrovitch asked of zossimov.
â€œn-no,â€ mumbled zossimov; â€œyou may amuse him.â€ he yawned again.
â€œhe has been conscious a long time, since the morning,â€ went on razumihin, whose familiarity seemed so much like unaffected good-nature that pyotr petrovitch began to be more cheerful, partly, perhaps, because this shabby and impudent person had introduced himself as a student.
â€œyour mamma,â€ began luzhin.
â€œhm!â€ razumihin cleared his throat loudly. luzhin looked at him inquiringly.
â€œthatâ€™s all right, go on.â

â€œat what?â€
â€œyour question is a wide one. i may be mistaken, but i fancy i find clearer views, more, so to say, criticism, more practicality...â€
â€œthatâ€™s true,â€ zossimov let drop.
â€œnonsense! thereâ€™s no practicality.â€ razumihin flew at him. â€œpracticality is a difficult thing to find; it does not drop down from heaven. and for the last two hundred years we have been divorced from all practical life. ideas, if you like, are fermenting,â€ he said to pyotr petrovitch, â€œand desire for good exists, though itâ€™s in a childish form, and honesty you may find, although there are crowds of brigands. anyway, thereâ€™s no practicality. practicality goes well shod

â€œheâ€™s learnt it by heart to show off!â€ raskolnikov pronounced suddenly.
â€œwhat?â€ asked pyotr petrovitch, not catching his words; but he received no reply.
â€œthatâ€™s all true,â€ zossimov hastened to interpose.
â€œisnâ€™t it so?â€ pyotr petrovitch went on, glancing affably at zossimov. â€œyou must admit,â€ he went on, addressing razumihin with a shade of triumph and superciliousnessâ€”he almost added â€œyoung manâ€â€”â€œthat there is an advance, or, as they say now, progress in the name of science and economic truth...â€

â€œoh, my dear sir... how could i?... come, thatâ€™s enough,â€ razumihin concluded, and he turned abruptly to zossimov to continue their previous conversation.
pyotr petrovitch had the good sense to accept the disavowal. he made up his mind to take leave in another minute or two.

â€œyes. what then?â€
â€œnothing.â€
â€œhow does he get hold of them?â€ asked zossimov.
â€œkoch has given the names of some of them, other names are on the wrappers of the pledges and some have come forward of themselves.â€
â€œit must have been a cunning and practised ruffian! the boldness of it! the coolness!â€
â€œthatâ€™s just what it wasnâ€™t!â€ interposed razumihin. â€œthatâ€™s what throws you all off the scent. but i maintain that he is not cunning, not practised, and probably this was his first crime! the supposition that it was a calculated crime and a cunning criminal

â€œoh, yes, being in the neighbourhood.â€

â€œwhat answer had your lecturer in moscow to make to the question why he was forging notes? â€˜everybody is getting rich one way or another, so i want to make haste to get rich too.â€™ i donâ€™t remember the exact words, but the upshot was that he wants money for nothing, without waiting or working! weâ€™ve grown used to having everything ready-made, to

â€œin accordance with my theory?â€
â€œwhy, carry out logically the theory you were advocating just now, and it follows that people may be killed...â€

â€œno, thatâ€™s not so,â€ put in zossimov.
raskolnikov lay with a white face and twitching upper lip, breathing painfully.
â€œthereâ€™s a measure in all things,â€ luzhin went on superciliously. â€œeconomic ideas are not an incitement to murder, and one has but to suppose...â€
â€œand is it true,â€ raskolnikov interposed once more suddenly, again in a voice quivering with fury and delight in insulting him, â€œis it true that you told your fiancÃ©e... within an hour of her acceptance, that what pleased you most... was that she was a be

â€œso much the worse...â€

but luzhin was already leaving without finishing his speech, squeezing between the table and the chair; razumihin got up this time to let him pass. without glancing at anyone, and not even nodding to zossimov, who had for some time been making signs to him to let the sick man alone, he went out, lifting his hat to the level of his shoulders to avoid crushing it as he stooped to go out of the door. and even the curve of his spine was expressive of the horrible insult he had received.
â€œhow could youâ€”how could you!â€ razumihin said, shaking his head in perplexity.

â€œif only he could get some favourable shock, thatâ€™s what would do it! at first he was better.... you know he has got something on his mind! some fixed idea weighing on him.... i am very much afraid so; he must have!â€

â€œno.â€
â€œr-rubbish!â€ razumihin shouted, out of patience. â€œhow do you know? you canâ€™t answer for yourself! you donâ€™t know anything about it.... thousands of times iâ€™ve fought tooth and nail with people and run back to them afterwards.... one feels ashamed and goes back to a man! so remember, potchinkovâ€™s house on the third storey....â€
â€œwhy, mr. razumihin, i do believe youâ€™d let anybody beat you from sheer benevolence.â€
â€œbeat? whom? m

â€œtalked to him?â€
â€œyes.â€
â€œwhat about? confound you, donâ€™t tell me then. potchinkovâ€™s house, 47, babushkinâ€™s flat, remember!â€
raskolnikov walked on and turned the corner into sadovy street. razumihin looked after him thoughtfully. then with a wave of his hand he went into the house but stopped short of the stairs.
â€œconfound it,â€ he went on almost aloud. â€œhe talked sensibly but yet... i am a fool! as if madmen didnâ€™t talk sensibly! and this was just what zossimov seemed afraid of.â€ he struck his finger on his forehead. â€œwhat if... how could i let him go off alone? he may drown himself.... ach, what a blunder! i canâ€™t.â€ and he ran back to overtake raskolnikov, but there was no trace of him. with a curse he returned with rapid steps to the palais de cristal to question zametov.
raskolnikov walked straight to xâ€”â€” bridge, stood in the middle, and leaning both elbows on the rail stared into the distance. on parting with razumihin, he felt so much

zossimov pounced upon raskolnikov almost greedily; he showed a special interest in him; soon his face brightened.
â€œyou must go to bed at once,â€ he pronounced, examining the patient as far as he could, â€œand take something for the night. will you take it? i got it ready some time ago... a powder.â€
â€œtwo, if you like,â€ answered raskolnikov. the powder was taken at once.

raskolnikov listened greedily. razumihin was drunk enough to talk too freely.
â€œi fainted then because it was so close and the smell of paint,â€ said raskolnikov.
â€œno need to explain that! and it wasnâ€™t the paint only: the fever had been coming on for a month; zossimov testifies to that! but how crushed that boy is now, you wouldnâ€™t believe! â€˜i am not worth his little finger,â€™ he says. yours, he means. he has good feelings at times, brother. but the lesson, the lesson you gave him to-day in the palais de cristal, that was too good for anything! you frightened him at first, you know, he nearly went into convulsions! you almost convinced him again of the truth of all that hideous nonsense, and then you suddenlyâ€”put out your tongue at him: â€˜there now,

â€œi know we are going in together, but i want to shake hands here and say good-bye to you here. so give me your hand, good-bye!â€
â€œwhatâ€™s the matter with you, rodya?â€
â€œnothing... come along... you shall be witness.â€
they began mounting the stairs, and the idea struck razumihin that perhaps zossimov might be right after all. â€œah, iâ€™ve upset him with my chatter!â€ he muttered to himself.
when they reached the door they heard voices in the room.
â€œwhat is it?â€ cried razumihin. raskolnikov was the first to open the door; he flung it wide and stood still in the doorway, dumbfoundered.
his mother and sister were sitting on his sofa and had been waiting an hour and a half for him. why had he never expected, never thought of them, though the news that they had started, were on their way a

 there was a certain barrier fixed by honesty, principle and the deepest convictions which nothing would induce her to cross.
exactly twenty minutes after razumihinâ€™s departure, there came two subdued but hurried knocks at the door: he had come back.
â€œi wonâ€™t come in, i havenâ€™t time,â€ he hastened to say when the door was opened. â€œhe sleeps like a top, soundly, quietly, and god grant he may sleep ten hours. nastasyaâ€™s with him; i told her not to leave till i came. now i am fetching zossimov, he will report to you and then youâ€™d better turn in; i can see you are too tired to do anything....â€
and he ran off down the corridor.
â€œwhat a very competent and... devoted young man!â€ cried pulcheria alexandrovna exceedingly delighted.
â€œhe seems a splendid person!â€ avdotya romanovna replied with some warmth, resuming her walk up and down the room.

tely relying on razumihinâ€™s promise; he actually had succeeded in bringing zossimov. zossimov had agreed at once to desert the drinking party to go to raskolnikovâ€™s, but he came reluctantly and with the greatest suspicion to see the ladies, mistrusting razumihin in his exhilarated condition. but his vanity was at once reassured and flattered; he saw that they were really expecting him as an oracle. he stayed just ten minutes and succeeded in completely convincing and comforting pulcheria alexandrovna. he spoke with marked sympathy, but with the reserve and extreme seriousness of a you

ction. he declared that he thought the invalid at this moment going on very satisfactorily. according to his observations the patientâ€™s illness was due partly to his unfortunate material surroundings during the last few months, but it had partly also a moral origin, â€œwas, so to speak, the product of several material and moral influences, anxieties, apprehensions, troubles, certain ideas... and so on.â€ noticing stealthily that avdotya romanovna was following his words with close attention, zossimov allowed himself to enlarge on this theme. on pulcheria alexandrovnaâ€™s anxiously and timidly inquiring as to â€œsome suspicion of insanity,â€ he replied with a composed and candid smile that his words had been exaggerated; that certainly the patient had some fixed idea, something approaching a monomaniaâ€”he, zossimov, was now particularly studying this interesting branch of medicineâ€”but that it must be recollected that until to-day the patient had been in delirium and... and that no doubt

â€œweâ€™ll talk to-morrow; go to bed at once!â€ razumihin said in conclusion, following zossimov out. â€œiâ€™ll be with you to-morrow morning as early as possible with my report.â€
â€œthatâ€™s a fetching little girl, avdotya romanovna,â€ remarked zossimov, almost licking his lips as they both came out into the street.
â€œfetching? you said fetching?â€ roared razumihin and he flew at zossimov and seized him by the throat. â€œif you ever dare.... do you understand? do you understand?â€ he shouted, shaking him by the collar and squeezing him against the wall. â€œdo you hear?â€
â€œlet me

go, you drunken devil,â€ said zossimov, struggling and when he had let him go, he stared at him and went off into a sudden guffaw. razumihin stood facing him in gloomy and earnest reflection.
â€œof course, i am an ass,â€ he observed, sombre as a storm cloud, â€œbut still... you are another.â€
â€œno, brother, not at all such another. i am not dreaming of any folly.â€
they walked along in silence and only when they were close to raskolnikovâ€™s lodgings, razumihin broke the silence in considerable anxiety.

â€œbut i donâ€™t think!â€
â€œhere you have modesty, brother, silence, bashfulness, a savage virtue... and yet sheâ€™s sighing and melting like wax, simply melting! save me from her, by all thatâ€™s unholy! sheâ€™s most prepossessing... iâ€™ll repay you, iâ€™ll do anything....â€
zossimov laughed more violently than ever.
â€œwell, you are smitten! but what am i to do with her?â€
â€œit wonâ€™t be much trouble, i assure you. talk any rot you like to her, as long as you sit by her and talk. youâ€™re a doctor, too; try curing her of something. i swear you wonâ€™t regret it. she has a piano, and you know, i strum a little. i have a song there, a genuine russian one: â€˜i shed hot tears.â€™ she likes the genuine articleâ€”and well, it all began with that song; now youâ€™re a regular

he was engaged in such monologues when zossimov, who had spent the night in praskovya pavlovnaâ€™s parlour, came in.
he was going home and was in a hurry to look at the invalid first. razumihin informed him that raskolnikov was sleeping like a dormouse. zossimov gave orders that they shouldnâ€™t wake him and promised to see him again about eleven.
â€œif he is still at home,â€ he added. â€œdamn it all! if one canâ€™t control oneâ€™s patients, how is one to cure them? do you know whether he will go to them, or whether they are coming here?â€

you are tormenting yourself so.â€
â€œwait, iâ€™ll peep in and see whether he has waked up.â€
the ladies slowly followed razumihin, who went on before, and when they reached the landladyâ€™s door on the fourth storey, they noticed that her door was a tiny crack open and that two keen black eyes were watching them from the darkness within. when their eyes met, the door was suddenly shut with such a slam that pulcheria alexandrovna almost cried out.

â€œhe is well, quite well!â€ zossimov cried cheerfully as they entered.
he had come in ten minutes earlier and was sitting in the same place as before, on the sofa. raskolnikov was sitting in the opposite corner, fully dressed and carefully washed and combed, as he had not been for some time past. the room was immediately crowded, yet nastasya managed to follow the visitors in and stayed to listen.
raskolnikov really was almost well, as compared with his condition the day before, but he was still pale, listless, and sombre. he look

yes feverish. he spoke little and reluctantly, as though performing a duty, and there was a restlessness in his movements.
he only wanted a sling on his arm or a bandage on his finger to complete the impression of a man with a painful abscess or a broken arm. the pale, sombre face lighted up for a moment when his mother and sister entered, but this only gave it a look of more intense suffering, in place of its listless dejection. the light soon died away, but the look of suffering remained, and zossimov, watching and studying his patient with all the zest of a young doctor beginning to practise, noticed in him no joy at the arrival of his mother and sister, but a sort of bitter, hidden determination to bear another hour or two of inevitable torture. he saw later that almost every word of the following conversation seemed to touch on some sore place and irritate it. but at the same time he marvelled at the power of controlling himself and hiding his feelings in a patient who the previous day ha

â€œyes, i see myself now that i am almost well,â€ said raskolnikov, giving his mother and sister a kiss of welcome which made pulcheria alexandrovna radiant at once. â€œand i donâ€™t say this as i did yesterday,â€ he said, addressing razumihin, with a friendly pressure of his hand.
â€œyes, indeed, i am quite surprised at him to-day,â€ began zossimov, much delighted at the ladiesâ€™ entrance, for he had not succeeded in keeping up a conversation with his patient for ten minutes. â€œin another three or four days, if he goes on like this, he will be just as before, that is, as he was a month ago, or two... or perhaps even three. this has been coming on for a long while.... eh? confess, now, that it has been perhaps your own fault?â€ he added, with a tentative smile, as though still afraid of irritating him.
â€œit is very possible,â€ answere

â€œi should say, too,â€ continued zossimov with zest, â€œthat your complete recovery depends solely on yourself. now that one can talk to you, i should like to impress upon you that it is essential to avoid the elementary, so to speak, fundamental causes tending to produce your morbid condition: in that case you will be cured, if not, it will go from bad to worse. these fundamental causes i donâ€™t know, but they must be known to you. you are an intelligent man, and must have observed yourself, of course. i fancy the first stage of your

â€œyes, yes; you are perfectly right.... i will make haste and return to the university: and then everything will go smoothly....â€
zossimov, who had begun his sage advice partly to make an effect before the ladies, was certainly somewhat mystified, when, glancing at his patient, he observed unmistakable mockery on his face. this lasted an instant, however. pulcheria alexandrovna began at once thanking zossimov, especially for his visit to their lodging the previous night.
â€œwhat! he saw you last night?â€ raskolnikov asked, as though startled. â€œthen you have not slept either after your journey.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be irritated.â€ zossimov forced himself to laugh. â€œassume that you are my first patientâ€”wellâ€”we fellows just beginning to practise love our first patients as if they were our children, and some almost fall in love with them. and, of course, i am not rich in pa

â€œdelirious? but you remember everything!â€ razumihin interrupted.
â€œthatâ€™s true,â€ raskolnikov answered with special carefulness. â€œi remember everything even to the slightest detail, and yetâ€”why i did that and went there and said that, i canâ€™t clearly explain now.â€
â€œa familiar phenomenon,â€ interposed zossimov, â€œactions are sometimes performed in a masterly and most cunning way, while the direction of the actions is deranged and dependent on various morbid impressionsâ€”itâ€™s like a dream.â€
â€œperhaps itâ€™s a good thing really that he should think me almost a madman,â€ thought raskolnikov.
â€œwhy, people in perfect health act in the same way too,â€ observed dounia, looking uneasily at zossimov.
â€œthere is some truth in your observation,â€ the latter replied. â€œin that sense we are certainl

at the word â€œmadman,â€ carelessly dropped by zossimov in his chatter on his favourite subject, everyone frowned.
raskolnikov sat seeming not to pay attention, plunged in thought with a strange smile on his pale lips. he was still meditating on something.
â€œwell, what about the man who was run over? i interrupted you!â€ razumihin cried hastily.

â€œyes, excellent, splendid, well-educated, intelligent,â€ raskolnikov began, suddenly speaking with surprising rapidity, and a liveliness he had not shown till then. â€œi canâ€™t remember where i met him before my illness.... i believe i have met him somewhereâ€”â€”... and this is a good man, too

â€œi did not expect you,â€ he said, hurriedly, with a look that made her stop. â€œplease sit down. you come, no doubt, from katerina ivanovna. allow meâ€”not there. sit here....â€
at soniaâ€™s entrance, razumihin, who had been sitting on one of raskolnikovâ€™s three chairs, close to the door, got up to allow her to enter. raskolnikov had at first shown her the place on the sofa where zossimov had been sitting, but feeling that the sofa which served him as a bed, was too familiar a place, he hurriedly motioned her to razumihinâ€™s chair.
â€œyou sit here,â€ he said to razumihin, putting him on the sofa.
sonia sat down, almost shaking with terror, and looked timidly at the two ladies. it was evidently almost inconceivable to herself that she could sit down beside them. at the thought of it, she was so frightened that she hurriedly got up again, and in utter confusion addressed raskoln

â€œthatâ€™s why you were so much struck when i mentioned to zossimov that porfiry was inquiring for everyone who had pledges!â€ razumihin put in with obvious intention.
this was really unbearable. raskolnikov could not help glancing at him with a flash of vindictive anger in his black eyes, but immediately recollected himself.
