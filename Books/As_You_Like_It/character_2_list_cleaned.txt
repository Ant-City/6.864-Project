[CHARACTER] - 
                 the
father of rosalind and the rightful ruler of the dukedom in which
the play is set. having been banished by his usurping brother, frederick,
[CHARACTER] now lives in exile in the forest of ardenne with a number
of loyal men, including lord amiens and jaques. we have the sense
that senior did not put up much of a fight to keep his dukedom,
for he seems to make the most of whatever life gives him. content
in the forest, where he claims to learn as much from stones and
brooks as he would in a church or library, [CHARACTER] proves himself
to be a kind and fair-minded ruler.
