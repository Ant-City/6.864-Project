Leo Auffmann - 
      The town inventor. Leo Auffmann is as happy as he is brilliant. On a farcical suggestion from Douglas and Grandpa Spaulding he decides to build a Happiness Machine, but finds that it only threatens the real happiness in his life--his family. He is devoted to his family and could not be any happier than when with his wife and children.
