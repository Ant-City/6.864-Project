[CHARACTER] - 
      an exemplar of english prettiness, mabel, sir robert's younger sister, embodies what wilde describes as the "fascinating tyranny of youth" and "astonishing courage of innocence." pert and clever, mabel flirtatiously matches lord goring's wit throughout t he play and their somewhat unconventional union serves as a foil to the other marriages and would-be engagements that compose the plot. mabel acts much like cecily in the importance of being earnest.
