, was a splendid spectacle. the mathematicians took their leave after conveying them to a place of safety, and candide had no other desire, no other aim, than to present his sheep to miss cunegonde.

"now," said he, "we are able to pay the governor of buenos ayres if miss cunegonde can be ransomed. let us journey towards cayenne. let us embark, and we will afterwards see what kingdom we shall be able to purchase."[pg 89]

what happened to them at surinam and how candide got acquainted with martin.

our travellers spent the first day very agreeably. they were delighted with possessing more treasure than all asia, europe, and africa could scrape together. candide, in his raptures, cut cunegonde's name on the trees. the second day two of their sheep plunged into a morass, where they and their burdens were lost; two more died of fatigue a few days after; seven or eight perished with hunger in a desert; and others subsequently fell down precipices. at length, after travelling a hundred days,

 with her. he had just been deprived of a small employment, on which he subsisted; and he was persecuted by the preachers of surinam, who took him for a socinian. we must allow that the others were at least as wretched as he; but candide hoped that the philosopher would entertain him during[pg 97] the voyage. all the other candidates complained that candide had done them great injustice; but he appeased them by giving one hundred piastres to each.[pg 98]

what happened at sea to candide and martin.

the old philosopher, whose name was martin, embarked then with candide for bordeaux. they had both seen and suffered a great deal; and if the vessel had sailed from surinam to japan, by the cape of good hope, the subject of moral and natural evil would have enabled them to entertain one another during the whole voyage.

candide, however, had one great advantage over martin, in that he always hoped to see miss cunegonde; whereas martin had nothing at all to hope. besides, candide was possessed

 of money and jewels, and though he had lost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon earth; though the knavery of the dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his mind; yet when he reflected upon what he had still left, and when he mentioned the name of cunegonde, especially towards the latter end of a repast, he inclined to pangloss's doctrine.

"but you, mr. martin," said he to the philosopher,[pg 99] "what do you think of all this? what are your ideas on moral and natural evil?"

"sir," answered martin, "our priests accused me of being a socinian, but the real fact is i am a manichean."[21]

"you jest," said candide; "there are no longer manicheans in the world."

"i am one," said martin. "i cannot help it; i know not how to think otherwise."

"surely you must be possessed by the devil," said candide.

"he is so deeply concerned in the affairs of this wo

the other, get their bread by disciplined depredation and murder, for want of more honest employment. even in those cities which seem to enjoy peace, and[pg 100] where the arts flourish, the inhabitants are devoured by more envy, care, and uneasiness than are experienced by a besieged town. secret griefs are more cruel than public calamities. in a word i have seen so much, and experienced so much that i am a manichean."

"there are, however, some things good," said candide.

"that may be," said martin; "but i know them not."

in the middle of this dispute they heard the report of cannon; it redoubled every instant. each took out his glass. they saw two ships in close fight about three miles off. the wind brought both so near to the french vessel that our travellers had the pleasure of seeing the fight at their ease. at length one let off a broadside, so low and so truly aimed, that the other sank to the bottom. candide and martin could plainly perceive a hundred men on the deck of the sinkin

g vessel; they raised their hands to heaven and uttered terrible outcries, and the next moment were swallowed up by the sea.

"well," said martin, "this is how men treat one another."

"it is true," said candide; "there is something diabolical in this affair."

while speaking, he saw he knew not what, of a shining red, swimming close to the vessel.[pg 101] they put out the long-boat to see what it could be: it was one of his sheep! candide was more rejoiced at the recovery of this one sheep than he had been grieved at the loss of the hundred laden with the large diamonds of el dorado.

the french captain soon saw that the captain of the 
 
 ___________________________
 
victorious vessel was a spaniard, and that the other was a dutch pirate, and the very same one who had robbed candide. the immense plunder which this villain had amassed, was buried with him in the sea, and out of the whole only one sheep was saved.

"you see," said candide to martin, "that crime is sometimes punished. this rogue of a dutch skipper has met with the fate he deserved."

"yes," said martin; "but why should the passengers be doomed also to destruction? god has punished the knave, and the devil has drowned the rest."

the french and spanish ships continued their course, and candide continued his conversation with martin. they disputed fifteen successive days, and on the last of those fifteen days, they were as far advanced as on the first. but, however, they chatted, they communicated ideas, they consoled each other. candide caressed his sheep.

"since i have found thee again," sai

candide and martin, reasoning, draw near the coast of france.

at length they descried the coast of france.

"were you ever in france, mr. martin?" said candide.

"yes," said martin, "i have been in several provinces. in some one-half of the people are fools, in others they are too cunning; in some they are weak and simple, in others they affect to be witty; in all, the principal occupation is love, the next is slander, and the third is talking nonsense."

"but, mr. martin, have you seen paris?"

"yes, i have. all these kinds are found there. it is a chaos—a confused multitude, where everybody seeks pleasure and scarcely any one finds it, at least as it appeared to me. i

 foot. i[pg 103] knew the whole scribbling rabble, the party rabble, the fanatic rabble. it is said that there are very polite people in that city, and i wish to believe it."

"for my part, i have no curiosity to see france," said candide. "you may easily imagine that after spending a month at el dorado i can desire to behold nothing upon earth but miss cunegonde. i go to await her at venice. we shall pass through france on our way to italy. will you bear me company?"

"with all my heart," said martin. "it is said that venice is fit only for its own nobility, but that strangers meet with a very good reception if they have a good deal of money. i have none of it; you have, therefore i will follow you all over the world."

"but do you believe," said candide, "that the earth was originally a sea, as we find it asserted in that large book belonging to the captain?"

"i do not believe a word of it," said martin, "any more than i do of the many ravings which have been published lately."

"but for

what end, then, has this world been formed?" said candide.

"to plague us to death," answered martin.

"are you not greatly surprised," continued candide, "at the love which these two girls of[pg 104] the oreillons had for those monkeys, of which i have already told you?"

"not at all," said martin. "i do not see that that passion was strange. i have seen so many extraordinary things that i have ceased to be surprised."

"do you believe," said candide, "that men have always massacred each other as they do to-day, that they have always been liars, cheats, traitors, ingrates, brigands, idiots, thieves, scoundrels, gluttons, drunkards, misers, envious, ambitious, bloody-minded, calumniators, debauchees, fanatics, hypocrites, and fools?"

"do you believe," said martin, "that hawks have always

 eaten pigeons when they have found them?"

"yes, without doubt," said candide.

"well, then," said martin, "if hawks have always had the same character why should you imagine that men may have changed theirs?"

"oh!" said candide, "there is a vast deal of difference, for free will——"

and reasoning thus they arrived at bordeaux.[pg 105]

what happened in france to candide and martin.

candide stayed in bordeaux no longer than was necessary for the selling of a few of the pebbles of el dorado, and for hiring a good chaise to hold two passengers; for he could not travel without his philosopher martin. he was only vexed at parting with his sheep, which he left to the bordeaux academy of sciences, who set as a subject for that year's prize, "to find why this sheep's wool was red;" and the prize was awarded to a learned man of the north, who demonstrated by a plus b minus c div

he entered paris by the suburb of st. marceau,[pg 106] and fancied that he was in the dirtiest village of westphalia.

scarcely was candide arrived at his inn, than he found himself attacked by a slight illness, caused by fatigue. as he had a very large diamond on his finger, and the people of the inn had taken notice of a prodigiously heavy box among his baggage, there were two physicians to attend him, though he had never sent for them, and two devotees who warmed his broths.

"i remember," martin said, "also to have been sick at paris in my first voyage; i was very poor, thus i had neither friends, devotees, nor doctors, and i recovered."

however, what with physic and bleeding, candide's illness became serious. a parson of the neighborhood came with great meekness to ask for a bill for the other world payable to the bearer. candide would do nothing for him; but the devotees assured him it was the new fashion. he answered that he was not a man of fashion. martin wished to throw the prie

st out of the window. the priest swore that they would not bury candide. martin swore that he would bury the priest if he continued to be troublesome. the quarrel grew heated. martin took him by the shoulders and roughly turned him out of doors; which occasioned great scandal and a law-suit.[pg 107]

candide got well again, and during his convalescence he had very good company to sup with him. they played high. candide wondered why it was that the ace never came to him; but martin was not at all astonished.

among those who did him the honours of the town was a little abbé of perigord, one of those busybodies who are ever alert, officious, forward, fawning, and complaisant; who watch for strangers in their passage through the capital, tell them the scandalous history of the town, and offer them pleasure at all prices. he first took candide and martin to la comédie, where they played a new tragedy. candide happened to be seated near some of the fashionable wits. this di

 plays with her is yet worse; and the play is still worse than the actors. the author does not know a word of arabic, yet the scene is in arabia; moreover he is a man that does not believe in innate ideas; and i will bring you, to-morrow, twenty pamphlets written against him."[22]

"how many dramas have you in france, sir?" said candide to the abbé.

"five or six thousand."[pg 108]

"what a number!" said candide. "how many good?"

"fifteen or sixteen," replied the other.

"what a number!" said martin.

candide was very pleased with an actress who played queen elizabeth in a somewhat insipid tragedy[23] sometimes acted.

"that actress," said he to martin, "pleases me much; she has a likeness to miss cunegonde; i should be very glad to wait upon her."

the perigordian abbé offered to introduce him. candide, brought up in germany, asked what was the etiquette, and how they treated queens of england in france.

"it is necessary to make distinctions," said the abbé. "in the provinces one takes

 them to the inn; in paris, one respects them when they are beautiful, and throws them on the highway when they are dead."[24]

"queens on the highway!" said candide.

"yes, truly," said martin, "the abbé is right. i was in paris when miss monime passed, as the saying is, from this life to the other. she was refused what people call the honours of sepulture—that is to say, of rotting with all the beggars of the neighbourhood in an ugly cemetery; she was interred all alone by her company at the corner of the rue de bourgogne, which[pg 109] ought to trouble her much, for she thought nobly."

"that was very uncivil," said candide.

"what would you have?" said martin; "these people are
 
 ___________________________
 
 who spoke so ill of the piece at which i wept, and of the actors who gave me so much pleasure?"

"he is a bad character," answered the abbé, "who gains his livelihood by saying evil of all plays and of all books. he hates whatever succeeds, as the eunuchs hate those who enjoy; he is one of the serpents of literature who nourish themselves on dirt and spite; he is a folliculaire."

"what is a folliculaire?" said candide.

"it is," said the abbé, "a pamphleteer—a fréron."[25]

thus candide, martin, and the perigordian[pg 110] conversed on the staircase, while watching every one go out after the performance.

"although i am eager to see cunegonde again," said candide, "i should like to sup with miss clairon, for she appears to me admirable."

the abbé was not the man to approach miss clairon, who saw only good company.

"she is engaged for this evening," he said, "but i shall have the honour to take you to the house of a lady of quality, and there you will know paris as if you had lived

with lynx-eyes all the doubled and other increased stakes, as each player dog's-eared his cards; she made them turn down the edges again with severe, but polite attention; she showed no vexation for fear of losing her customers. the lady insisted upon being called the marchioness of parolignac. her daughter, aged fifteen, was among the punters, and notified with a covert glance the[pg 111] cheatings of the poor people who tried to repair the cruelties of fate. the perigordian abbé, candide and martin entered; no one rose, no one saluted them, no one looked at them; all were profoundly occupied with their cards.

"the baroness of thunder-ten-tronckh was more polite," said candide.

however, the abbé whispered to the marchioness, who half rose, honoured candide with a gracious smile, and martin with a condescending nod; she gave a seat and a pack of cards to candide, who lost fifty thousand francs in two deals, after which they supped very gaily, and every one was astonished that candide was

in impertinent quarrels; jansenist against molinist, parliament against the church, men of letters against men of letters, courtesans against courtesans, financiers against the people, wives against husbands, relatives against relatives—it is eternal war."

"i have seen the worst," candide replied. "but a wise man, who since has had the misfortune to be hanged, taught me that all is marvellously well; these are but the shadows on a beautiful picture."

"your hanged man mocked the world," said martin. "the shadows are horrible blots."[pg 115]

"they are men who make the blots," said candide, "and they cannot be dispensed with."

"it is not their fault then," said martin.

most of the punters, who understood nothing of this language, drank, and martin reasoned with the scholar, and candide related some of his adventures to his hostess.

after supper the marchioness took candide into her boudoir, and made him sit upon a sofa.

"ah, well!" said she to him, "you love desperately miss cunegonde

at bordeaux, where i left faithful cacambo and the old woman, who are to follow me very soon. the governor of buenos ayres has taken all, but[pg 118] there remains to me your heart. come! your presence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure."

this charming, this unhoped-for letter transported candide with an inexpressible joy, and the illness of his dear cunegonde overwhelmed him with grief. divided between those two passions, he took his gold and his diamonds and hurried away, with martin, to the hotel where miss cunegonde was lodged. he entered her room trembling, his heart palpitating, his voice sobbing; he wished to open the curtains of the bed, and asked for a light.

"take care what you do," said the servant-maid; "the light hurts her," and immediately she drew the curtain again.

"my dear cunegonde," said candide, weeping, "how are you? if you cannot see me, at least speak to me."

"she cannot speak," said the maid.

the lady then put a plump hand out from the bed, and can

dide bathed it with his tears and afterwards filled it with diamonds, leaving a bag of gold upon the easy chair.

in the midst of these transports in came an officer, followed by the abbé and a file of soldiers.

"there," said he, "are the two suspected[pg 119] foreigners," and at the same time he ordered them to be seized and carried to prison.

"travellers are not treated thus in el dorado," said candide.

"i am more a manichean now than ever," said martin.

"but pray, sir, where are you going to carry us?" said candide.

"to a dungeon," answered the officer.

martin, having recovered himself a little, judged that the lady who acted the part of cunegonde was a cheat, that the perigordian abbé was a knave who had imposed upon the honest simplicity of candide, and that the officer was another knave whom they might easily silence.

candide, advised by martin and impatient to see the real cunegonde, rather than expose himself before a court of justi

"i can conduct you no further than lower normandy," said the officer.

immediately he ordered his irons to be struck off, acknowledged himself mistaken, sent away his men, set out with candide and martin for dieppe, and left them in the care of his brother.[pg 121]

there was then a small dutch ship in the harbour. the norman, who by the virtue of three more diamonds had become the most subservient of men, put candide and his attendants on board a vessel that was just ready to set sail for portsmouth in england.

this was not the way to venice, but candide thought he had made his way out of hell, and reckoned that he would soon have an opportunity for resuming his journey.[pg 122]

de and martin touched upon the coast of england, and what they saw there.

"ah, pangloss! pangloss! ah, martin! martin! ah, my dear cunegonde, what sort of a world is this?" said candide on board the dutch ship.

"something very foolish and abominable," said martin.

"you know england? are they as foolish there as in france?"

"it is another kind of folly," said martin. "you know that these two nations are at war for a few acres of snow in canada,[31] and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than canada is worth. to tell you exactly, whether there are more people fit to send to a madhouse in one country than the other, is what my imperfect intelligence will not permit. i only know in general that the people we are going to see are very atrabilious."

talking thus they arrived at portsmouth. the coast was lined with crowds of people, whose eyes we

rs."

candide was so shocked and bewildered by what he saw and heard, that he would not set foot on shore, and he made a bargain with the dutch skipper (were he even to rob him like the surinam captain) to conduct him without delay to venice.

the skipper was ready in two days. they[pg 124] coasted france; they passed in sight of lisbon, and candide trembled. they passed through the straits, and entered the mediterranean. at last they landed at venice.

"god be praised!" said candide, embracing martin. "it is here that i shall see again my beautiful cunegonde. i trust cacambo as myself. all is well, all will be well, all goes as well as possible."[pg 125]

xxiv

of paquette and friar giroflée.

upon their arrival at venice, candide went to search for cacambo at every inn and coffee-house, and among all the ladies of pleasure, but to no purpose. he sent every day to inquire on all the ships that came in. but there was no news of cacambo.

"what!" said he to martin, "i have had time to voyage
 
 ___________________________
 
from paris to dieppe, from dieppe to portsmouth, to coast along portugal and spain, to cross the whole mediterranean, to spend some months, and yet the beautiful cunegonde has not arrived! instead of her i have only met a parisian wench and a perigordian abbé. cunegonde is dead without doubt, and there is nothing for me but to die. alas! how much better it would have been for me to have remained in the paradise of el dorado than to come back to this cursed europe! you are in the right, my dear martin: all is misery and illusion."

he fell into a deep melancholy, and neither[pg 126] went to see the opera, nor any of the other diversions of the carnival; nay, he was proof against the temptations of all the ladies.

"you are in truth very simple," said martin to him, "if you imagine that a mongrel valet, who has five or six millions in his pocket, will go to the other end of the world to seek your mistress and bring her to you to venice. if he find her, he will keep her to himself; if he do no

t find her he will get another. i advise you to forget your valet cacambo and your mistress cunegonde."

martin was not consoling. candide's melancholy increased; and martin continued to prove to him that there was very little virtue or happiness upon earth, except perhaps in el dorado, where nobody could gain admittance.

while they were disputing on this important subject and waiting for cunegonde, candide saw a young theatin friar in st. mark's piazza, holding a girl on his arm. the theatin looked fresh coloured, plump, and vigorous; his eyes were sparkling, his air assured, his look lofty, and his step bold. the girl was very pretty, and sang; she looked amorou

sly at her theatin, and from time to time pinched his fat cheeks.

"at least you will allow me," said candide to martin, "that these two are happy. hitherto i have met with none but unfortunate people in[pg 127] the whole habitable globe, except in el dorado; but as to this pair, i would venture to lay a wager that they are very happy."

"i lay you they are not," said martin.

"we need only ask them to dine with us," said candide, "and you will see whether i am mistaken."

immediately he accosted them, presented his compliments, and invited them to his inn to eat some macaroni, with lombard partridges, and caviare, and to drink some montepulciano, lachrymæ christi, cyprus and samos wine. the girl blushed, the theatin accepted the invitation and she followed him, casting her eyes on candide with confusion and surprise, and dropping a few tears. no sooner had she se

olier, an abbé, to be exposed to abuse and insults; to be often reduced to borrowing a petticoat, only to go and have it raised by a disagreeable man; to be robbed by one of what one has earned from another; to be subject to the extortions of the officers of justice; and to have in prospect only a frightful old age, a hospital, and a dung-hill; you would conclude that i am one of the most unhappy creatures in the world."[33]

paquette thus opened her heart to honest candide, in the presence of martin, who said to his friend:

"you see that already i have won half the wager."

friar giroflée stayed in the dining-room, and drank a glass or two of wine while he was waiting for dinner.

"but," said candide to paquette, "you looked so gay and content when i met you; you sang and you behaved so lovingly to the theatin, that you seemed to me as happy as you pretend to be now the reverse."

"ah! sir," answered paquette, "this is one of the miseries of the trade. yesterday i was[pg 130] robbed and

beaten by an officer; yet to-day i must put on good humour to please a friar."

candide wanted no more convincing; he owned that martin was in the right. they sat down to table with paquette and the theatin; the repast was entertaining; and towards the end they conversed with all confidence.

"father," said candide to the friar, "you appear to me to enjoy a state that all the world might envy; the flower of health shines in your face, your expression makes plain your happiness; you have a very pretty girl for your recreation, and you seem well satisfied with your state as a theatin."

"my faith, sir," said friar giroflée, "i w

martin turned towards candide with his usual coolness.

"well," said he, "have i not won the whole wager?"

candide gave two thousand piastres to paquette, and one thousand to friar giroflée.

"i'll answer for it," said he, "that with this they will be happy."

"i do not believe it at all," said martin; "you will, perhaps, with these piastres only render them the more unhappy."

"let that be as it may," said candide, "but one thing consoles me. i see that we often meet with those whom we expected nev

er to see more; so that, perhaps, as i have found my red sheep and paquette, it may well be that i shall also find cunegonde."

"i wish," said martin, "she may one day make you very happy; but i doubt it very much."

"you are very hard of belief," said candide.

"i have lived," said martin.

"you see those gondoliers," said candide, "are they not perpetually singing?"

"you do not see them," said martin, "at home with their wives and brats. the doge has his troubles, the gondoliers have theirs. it is true that, all things considered, the life of a gondolier is preferable to that of a doge; but i believe the[pg 132] difference to be so trifling that it is not worth the trouble of examining."

"people talk," said candide, "of the senator pococurante, who lives in that fine palace on the brenta, where he entertains foreigners in the politest manner. they pretend that this man has never felt any u

"i should be glad to see such a rarity," said martin.

candide immediately sent to ask the lord pococurante permission to wait upon him the next day.[pg 133]

the visit to lord pococurante, a noble venetian.

candide and martin went in a gondola on the brenta, and arrived at the palace of the noble signor pococurante. the gardens, laid out with taste, were adorned with fine marble statues. the palace was beautifully built. the master of the house was a man of sixty, and very rich. he received the two travellers with polite indifference, which put candide a little out of countenance, but was not at all disagreeable to martin.

candide disputed the point a little, but with discretion. martin was entirely of the senator's opinion.

they sat down to table, and after an excellent dinner they went into the library. candide, seeing a homer magnificently bound, commended the virtuoso on his good taste.

"there," said he, "is a book that was once the delight of the great pangloss, the best philosopher in germany."

"it is not mine," answered pococurante coolly. "they used at one time to make me believe that i took a pleasure in reading him. but that continual repetition of battles, so ext

candide, having been educated never to judge for himself, was much surprised at what he heard. martin found there was a good deal of reason in pococurante's remarks.

"oh! here is cicero," said candide. "here is the great man whom i fancy you are never tired of reading."

"i never read him," replied the venetian. "what is it to me whether he pleads for rabirius or cluentius? i try causes enough myself; his philosophical works seem to me better, but when i found that he doubted of everything, i concluded that i knew as much as he, and that i had no need of a guide to learn ignorance."

"ha! here

 are four-score volumes of the academy of sciences," cried martin. "perhaps there is something valuable in this collection."[pg 138]

"there might be," said pococurante, "if only one of those rakers of rubbish had shown how to make pins; but in all these volumes there is nothing but chimerical systems, and not a single useful thing."

"and what dramatic works i see here," said candide, "in italian, spanish, and french."

"yes," replied the senator, "there are three thousand, and not three dozen of them good for anything. as to those collections of sermons, wh

martin saw some shelves filled with english books.

"i have a notion," said he, "that a republican must be greatly pleased with most of these books, which are written with a spirit of freedom."

"yes," answered pococurante, "it is noble to write as one thinks; this is the privilege of humanity. in all our italy we write only what we do not think; those who inhabit the country of the cæsars and the antoninuses dare not acquire a single idea without the permission of a dominican friar. i should be plea

candide was grieved at this speech, for he had a respect for homer and was fond of milton.

"alas!" said he softly to martin, "i am afraid that this man holds our german poets in very great contempt."

"there would not be much harm in that," said martin.

"oh! what a superior man," said candide below his breath. "what a great genius is this pococurante! nothing can please him."

after their survey of the library they went down into the garden, where candide praised its several beauties.

"i know of nothing in so bad a taste," said the master. "all you see here is merely trifling. after to-morrow i will have it plante

"well," said candide to martin when they had taken their leave, "you will agree that this is the happiest of mortals, for he is above everything he possesses."

"but do you not see," answered martin, "that he is disgusted with all he possesses? plato observed a long while ago that those stomachs are not the best that reject all sorts of food."

"but is there not a pleasure," said candide,[pg 141] "in criticising everything, in pointing out faults where others see nothing but beauties?"

"that is to say," replied martin, "that there is some pleasure in having no pleasure."

"well, well," said candide, "i find that i shall be the only happy man when i am blessed with the sight of my dear cun

egonde."

"it is always well to hope," said martin.

however, the days and the weeks passed. cacambo did not come, and candide was so overwhelmed with grief that he did not even reflect that paquette and friar giroflée did not return to thank him.[pg 142]

of a supper which candide and martin took with six strangers, and who they were.[34]

one evening that candide and martin were going to sit down to supper with some foreigners who lodged in the same inn, a man whose complexion was as black as soot, came behind candide, and taking him by the arm, said:

"get yourself ready to go along with us; do not fail."

upon this he turned round and saw—cacambo! nothing but the sight of cunegonde could have astonished and delighted him more. he was on the point of going mad with joy. he embraced his dear friend.

"cunegonde is here, without doubt; where is she? take me to he

 she in china i would fly thither; let us be off."

"we shall set out after supper," replied[pg 143] cacambo. "i can tell you nothing more; i am a slave, my master awaits me, i must serve him at table; speak not a word, eat, and then get ready."

candide, distracted between joy and grief, delighted at seeing his faithful agent again, astonished at finding him a slave, filled with the fresh hope of recovering his mistress, his heart palpitating, his understanding confused, sat down to table with martin, who saw all these scenes quite unconcerned, and with six strangers who had come to spend the carnival at venice.

cacambo waited at table upon one of the strangers; towards the end of the entertainment he drew near his master, and whispered in his ear:

"sire, your majesty may start when you please, the vessel is ready."

on saying these words he went out. the company in great surprise looked at one another without speaking a word, when another domestic approached his master and said to him:

"sire, your majesty's chaise is at padua, and the boat is ready."

the master gave a nod and the servant went away. the company all stared at one another again, and their surprise redoubled. a third valet came up to a third stranger, saying:

"sire, believe me, your majesty ought not to[pg 144] stay here any longer. i am going to get everything ready."

and immediately he disappeared. candide and martin did not doubt that this was a masquerade of the carnival. then a fourth domestic said to a fourth master:

"your majesty may depart when you please."

saying this he went away like the rest. the fifth valet said the same thing to the fifth master. but the sixth valet spoke differently to the sixth stranger, who sat near candide. he said to him:

"faith, sire, they will no longer give credit to your majesty nor to me, and we may perhaps both of us be put in jail this very night. therefore i will

 take care of myself. adieu."

the servants being all gone, the six strangers, with candide and martin, remained in a profound silence. at length candide broke it.

"gentlemen," said he, "this is a very good joke indeed, but why should you all be kings? for me i own that neither martin nor i is a king."

cacambo's master then gravely answered in italian:

"i am not at all joking. my name is achmet iii. i was grand sultan many years. i dethroned my brother; my nephew dethroned me, my viziers were beheaded, and i am condemned to end my days in the old seraglio. my nephew,[pg 145] the great sultan mahmoud, permits me to travel sometimes for my health, and i am come to spend the carnival at venice."

a young man who sat next to achmet, spoke then as follows:

"my name is ivan. i

came four serene highnesses, who had also been stripped of their territories by the fortune of war, and were come to spend the carnival at venice. but candide paid no regard to these newcomers, his thoughts were entirely employed on his voyage to constantinople, in search of his beloved cunegonde.[pg 148]

candide's voyage to constantinople.

the faithful cacambo had already prevailed upon the turkish skipper, who was to conduct the sultan achmet to constantinople, to receive candide and martin on his ship. they both embarked after having made their obeisance to his miserable highness.

"you see," said candide to martin on the way, "we supped with six dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom i gave charity. perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. for my part, i have only lost a hundred sheep; and now i am flying into cunegonde's arms. my dear martin, yet once more pangloss was right: all is for the best."

"i wish it," answered martin.

"but," said ca

ndide, "it was a very strange adventure we met with at venice. it has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn."

"it is not more extraordinary," said martin, "than most of the things that have happened to us. it is a very common thing for kings to be[pg 149] dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their company, it is a trifle not worth our attention."

no sooner had candide got on board the vessel than he flew to his old valet and friend cacambo, and tenderly embraced him.

"well," said he, "what news of cunegonde? is she still a prodigy of beauty? does she love me still? how is she? thou hast doubtless bought her a palace at co

"what a series of shocking calamities!" cried candide. "but after all, i have some diamonds left; and i may easily pay cunegonde's ransom. yet it is a pity that she is grown so ugly."

then, turning towards martin: "who do you think," said he, "is most to be pitied—the sultan achmet, the emperor ivan, king charles edward, or i?"

"how should i know!" answered martin. "i must see into your hearts to be able to tell."

"ah!" said candide, "if pangloss were here, he could tell."

"i know not," said martin, "in what sort of scales your pangloss would weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrows. all that i can presume to say is, that there are millions of people upon earth who

d let drop their oars. the captain ran up to them and redoubled his blows with the bull's pizzle.

"stop! stop! sir," cried candide. "i will give you what money you please."[pg 152]

"what! it is candide!" said one of the slaves.

"what! it is candide!" said the other.

"do i dream?" cried candide; "am i awake? or am i on board a galley? is this the baron whom i killed? is this master pangloss whom i saw hanged?"

"it is we! it is we!" answered they.

"well! is this the great philosopher?" said martin.

"ah! captain," said candide, "what ransom will you take for monsieur de thunder-ten-tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for monsieur pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in germany?"

"dog of a christian," answered the levantine captain, "since these two dogs of christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which i doubt not are high dignities in their country, you shall give me fifty thousand sequins."

"you shall have them, sir. carry me back at once to constantinople,

candide embraced the baron and pangloss a hundred times.

"and how happened it, my dear baron, that[pg 153] i did not kill you? and, my dear pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? and why are you both in a turkish galley?"

"and it is true that my dear sister is in this country?" said the baron.

"yes," answered cacambo.

"then i behold, once more, my dear candide," cried pangloss.

candide presented martin and cacambo to them; they embraced each other, and all spoke at once. the galley flew; they were already in the port. instantly candide sent for a jew, to whom he sold for fifty thousand sequins a diamond worth a hundred thousand, though the fellow swore to him by abraham that he could give him no more. he immediately paid the ransom for the baron and pangloss. the latter threw himself at the feet of his deliverer, and bathed them with his tears; the former thanked him with a nod, and promised

to return him the money on the first opportunity.

"but is it indeed possible that my sister can be in turkey?" said he.

"nothing is more possible," said cacambo, "since she scours the dishes in the service of a transylvanian prince."

candide sent directly for two jews and sold them some more diamonds, and then they all set out together in another galley to deliver cunegonde from slavery.[pg 154]

what happened to candide, cunegonde, pangloss, martin, etc.

"i ask your pardon once more," said candide to the baron, "your pardon, reverend father, for having run you through the body."

"say no more about it," answered the baron. "i was a little too hasty, i own, but since you wish to know by what fatality i came to be a galley-slave i will inform you. after i had been cured by the surgeon of the college of the wound you gave me, i was attacked and carried off by a party of spanish troops, who confined me in prison at buenos ayres at the very t

"i am still of my first opinion," answered pangloss, "for i am a philosopher and i cannot[pg 158] retract, especially as leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."[pg 159]

how candide found cunegonde and the old woman again.

while candide, the baron, pangloss, martin, and cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the banks of the propontis. the first objects which met their sight were cunegonde and the old woman hanging towels out to dry.

the baron paled at this sight.

rry her; and dost thou pretend to oppose the match? i should kill thee again, were i only to consult my anger."

"thou mayest kill me again," said the baron, "but thou shalt not marry my sister, at least whilst i am living."[pg 161]

the conclusion.

at the bottom of his heart candide had no wish to marry cunegonde. but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match, and cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from his word. he consulted pangloss, martin, and the faithful cacambo. pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the baron had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she might marry candide with her left hand. martin was for throwing the baron into the sea; cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship. this advice was well received

, the old woman approved it; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a jesuit, and punishing the pride of a german baron.[pg 162]

it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married, and living with the philosopher pangloss, the philosopher martin, the prudent cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas, must have led a very happy life. but he was so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde. cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and cursed hi

s destiny. pangloss was in despair at not shining in some german university. for martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. candide, martin, and pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics. they often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of effendis, pashas, and cadis, who were going into banishment to lemnos, mitylene, or erzeroum. and they saw other cadis, pashas, and effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their turn. they saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the sublime porte. such spectacles as these increased the number[pg 163] of their dissertations

y upon their hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them:

"i want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an auto-da-fé, to be dissected, to row in the galleys—in short, to go through all the miseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?"

"it is a great question," said candide.

this discourse gave rise to new reflections, and martin especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust. candide did not quite agree to that, but he affirmed nothing. pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.

what helped to confirm martin in his detestable principles, to stagger candide more than ever, and to puzzle pangloss, was that one day they saw

paquette and friar giroflée land at the farm in extreme misery. they had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown[pg 164] into gaol, had escaped, and friar giroflée had at length become turk. paquette continued her trade wherever she went, but made nothing of it.

"i foresaw," said martin to candide, "that your presents would soon be dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. you have rolled in millions of money, you and cacambo; and yet you are not happier than friar giroflée and paquette."

"ha!" said pangloss to paquette, "providence has then brought you amongst us again, my poor child! do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? what a world is this!"

and now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.

s," said pangloss, "that i should reason with you a little about causes and effects, about the best of possible worlds, the origin of evil, the nature of the soul, and the pre-established harmony."

at these words, the dervish shut the door in their faces.

during this conversation, the news was spread that two viziers and the mufti had been strangled at constantinople, and that several of their friends had been impaled. this catastrophe made a great noise for some hours. pangloss, candide, and martin, returning to the little farm, saw a good old man taking the fresh air at his door under an orange bower. pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what was the name of the strangled mufti.

"i do not know," answered the worthy man, "and i have not known the name of any mufti, nor of any vizier. i am entirely ignorant of the event you mention; i presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably, and that t

"you must have a vast and magnificent estate," said candide to the turk.

"i have only twenty acres," replied the old man; "i and my children cultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great evils—weariness, vice, and want."

candide, on his way home, made profound reflections on the old man's conversation.

"this honest turk," said he to pangloss and martin, "seems to be in a situation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honour of supping."

"grandeur," said pangloss, "is extremely dangerous according to the testimony of philosophers. for, in short, eglon, king of moab,[pg 167] was assassinated by ehud; absalom was hung by his hair, and pierced with three darts; king nadab, the son of jeroboam, was killed by baasa; king ela by zimri; ahaziah by jehu; athaliah by jehoiada; the kings jehoiakim, jeconiah, and zedekiah, were l

"i know also," said candide, "that we must cultivate our garden."

"you are right," said pangloss, "for when man was first placed in the garden of eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, that he might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."

"let us work," said martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable."

the whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent pastry cook; paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after the[pg 168] linen. they were all, not excepting friar giroflée, of some service or other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man
