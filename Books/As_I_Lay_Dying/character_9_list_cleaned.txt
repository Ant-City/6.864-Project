[CHARACTER] - 
                	the
father of dewey dell's child. while he never appears in person in
the novel, [CHARACTER] is certainly a driving force behind many of dewey
dell's thoughts and much of her behavior. in a supreme effort to disassociate
himself from her problems, [CHARACTER] gives dewey dell ten dollars with
which to pay for 
an abortion.
