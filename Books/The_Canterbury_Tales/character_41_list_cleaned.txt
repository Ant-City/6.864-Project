the [CHARACTER] - 
these are the three protagonists of the pardoner's
tale. all three indulge in and represent the vices against which
the pardoner has railed in his prologue: gluttony, drunkeness, gambling,
and swearing. these traits define the three and eventually lead
to their downfall. the rioters at first appear like personified
vices, but it is their belief that a personified concept--in this
case, death--is a real person that becomes the root cause of their
undoing.
