own curiosity, and become what with her untrained mind she greatly
admired, an investigator, elucidating the social problem.

insoluble questions they were, it seemed to her, standing there, holding
james by the hand. he had followed her into the drawing-room, that young
man they laughed at; he was standing by the table, fidgeting with
something, awkwardly, feeling himself out of things, as she knew without
looking round. they had all gone--the children; minta doyle and paul
rayley; augustus carmichael; her husband--they had all gone. so she
turned with a sigh and said, "would it bore you to come with me,
mr. tansley?"

she had a dull errand in the town; she had a letter or two to write; she
would be ten minutes perhaps; she would put on her hat. and, with her
basket and her parasol, there she was again, ten minutes later, giving out
a sense of being ready, of being equipped for a jaunt, which, however, she
must interrupt for a moment, as they passed the tennis lawn, to ask
mr. carmichael, wh

perhaps to mend it; and then about his books, to be afraid that he might
guess, what she a little suspected, that his last book was not quite his
best book (she gathered that from william bankes); and then to hide small
daily things, and the children seeing it, and the burden it laid on
them--all this diminished the entire joy, the pure joy, of the two notes
sounding together, and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal
flatness.

a shadow was on the page; she looked up. it was augustus carmichael
shuffling past, precisely now, at the very moment when it was painful to
be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships, that the most
perfect was flawed, and could not bear the examination which, loving her
husband, with her instinct for truth, she turned upon it; when it was
painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness, and impeded in her
proper function by these lies, these exaggerations,--it was at this
moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation,

, vocal, evaporated; and one shrunk,
with a sense of solemnity, to being oneself, a wedge-shaped core of
darkness, something invisible to others. although she continued to
knit, and sat upright, it was thus that she felt herself; and this self
having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures. when
life sank down for a moment, the range of experience seemed limitless.
and to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources,
she supposed; one after another, she, lily, augustus carmichael, must
feel, our apparitions, the things you know us by, are simply childish.
beneath it is all dark, it is all spreading, it is unfathomably deep;
but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us
by. her horizon seemed to her limitless. there were all the places
she had not seen; the indian plains; she felt herself pushing aside the
thick leather curtain of a church in rome. this core of darkness could
go anywhere, for no one saw it. they could not stop it, she thought,

these questions and answers across, each knowing exactly what the other
felt). everybody could see, mrs. ramsay thought. there was rose gazing
at her father, there was roger gazing at his father; both would be off
in spasms of laughter in another second, she knew, and so she said
promptly (indeed it was time):

"light the candles," and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled
at the sideboard.

why could he never conceal his feelings? mrs. ramsay wondered, and she
wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed. perhaps he had; perhaps
he had not. she could not help respecting the composure with which he
sat there, drinking his soup. if he wanted soup, he asked for soup.
whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same.
he did not like her, she knew that; but partly for that very reason she
respected him, and looking at him, drinking soup, very large and calm
in the failing light, and monumental, and contemplative, she wondered
what he did feel then, and why he was alwa

 own voice, outside her self, saying quite easily and
naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said
different things. she knew, without looking round, that every one at
the table was listening to the voice saying:

i wonder if it seems to you, luriana, lurilee

with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had, as if this
were, at last, the natural thing to say, this were their own voice
speaking.

but the voice had stopped. she looked round. she made herself get up.
augustus carmichael had risen and, holding his table napkin so that it
looked like a long white robe he stood chanting:

to see the kings go riding by
over lawn and daisy lea
with their palm leaves and cedar
luriana, lurilee,

and as she passed him, he turned slightly towards her repeating the
last words:

luriana, lurilee

and bowed to her as if he did her homage. without knowing why, she
felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before; and with a
feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow an
