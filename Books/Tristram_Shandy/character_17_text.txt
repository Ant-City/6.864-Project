temper more from blood, than either wind or
water, or any modifications or combinations of them whatever: and i
have, therefore, oft-times wondered, that my father, tho' i believe he
had his reasons for it, upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity,
in my course, when i was a boy,--should never once endeavour to account
for them in this way: for all the shandy family were of an original
character throughout:--i mean the males,--the females had no character
at all,--except, indeed, my great aunt dinah, who, about sixty years
ago, was married and got with child by the coachman, for which my
father, according to his hypothesis of christian names, would often say,
she might thank her godfathers and godmothers.

it will seem strange,--and i would as soon think of dropping a riddle
in the reader's way, which is not my interest to do, as set him upon
guessing how it could come to pass, that an event of this kind, so many
years after it had happened, should be reserved for the interruption of

hereafter; and every circumstance relating to it, in its proper place,
shall be faithfully laid before you:--'till then, it is not in my power
to give farther light into this matter, or say more than what i have
said already,--that my uncle toby was a gentleman of unparallel'd
modesty, which happening to be somewhat subtilized and rarified by the
constant heat of a little family pride,--they both so wrought together
within him, that he could never bear to hear the affair of my aunt dinah
touch'd upon, but with the greatest emotion.--the least hint of it was
enough to make the blood fly into his face;--but when my father enlarged
upon the story in mixed companies, which the illustration of his
hypothesis frequently obliged him to do,--the unfortunate blight of one
of the fairest branches of the family, would set my uncle toby's honour
and modesty o'bleeding; and he would often take my father aside, in the
greatest concern imaginable, to expostulate and tell him, he would give

m any thing in the world, only to let the story rest.

my father, i believe, had the truest love and tenderness for my uncle
toby, that ever one brother bore towards another, and would have done
any thing in nature, which one brother in reason could have desir'd of
another, to have made my uncle toby's heart easy in this, or any other
point. but this lay out of his power.

--my father, as i told you was a philosopher in
grain,--speculative,--systematical;--and my aunt dinah's affair was
a matter of as much consequence to him, as the retrogradation of the
planets to copernicus:--the backslidings of venus in her orbit fortified
the copernican system, called so after his name; and the backslidings
of my aunt dinah in her orbit, did the same service in establishing my
father's system, which, i trust, will for ever hereafter be called the
shandean system, after his.

in any other family dishonour, my father, i believe, had as nice a
sense of shame as any man whatever;-

on in him,--but
because 'tis an excellence seldom looked for, or expected indeed, in a
digression;--and it is this: that tho' my digressions are all fair, as
you observe,--and that i fly off from what i am about, as far, and as
often too, as any writer in great britain; yet i constantly take care
to order affairs so that my main business does not stand still in my
absence.

i was just going, for example, to have given you the great out-lines of
my uncle toby's most whimsical character;--when my aunt dinah and the
coachman came across us, and led us a vagary some millions of miles into
the very heart of the planetary system: notwithstanding all this, you
perceive that the drawing of my uncle toby's character went on gently
all the time;--not the great contours of it,--that was impossible,--but
some familiar strokes and faint designations of it, were here and there
touch'd on, as we went along, so that you are much better acquainted
with my uncle toby now than you was before.

le soreness of temper; tho' this never transported him to any thing
which looked like malignancy:--yet in the little rubs and vexations
of life, 'twas apt to shew itself in a drollish and witty kind of
peevishness:--he was, however, frank and generous in his nature;--at all
times open to conviction; and in the little ebullitions of this subacid
humour towards others, but particularly towards my uncle toby, whom he
truly loved:--he would feel more pain, ten times told (except in the
affair of my aunt dinah, or where an hypothesis was concerned) than what
he ever gave.

the characters of the two brothers, in this view of them, reflected
light upon each other, and appeared with great advantage in this affair
which arose about stevinus.

i need not tell the reader, if he keeps a hobby-horse,--that a man's
hobby-horse is as tender a part as he has about him; and that
these unprovoked strokes at my uncle toby's could not be unfelt by
him.--no:--as i said above, my uncle toby did feel them, and very

to appear with a blot in my escutcheon before them.--never mind the

said my father--you may go with my aunt dinah to a visitation with a
bend-sinister, if you think fit--my poor uncle toby blush'd. my father
was vexed at himself.--no--my dear brother toby, said my father,
changing his tone--but the damp of the coach-lining about my loins, may
give me the sciatica again, as it did december, january, and february
last winter--so if you please you shall ride my wife's pad--and as

oh! there is a husk and shell, yorick, which grows up with learning,

yorick thought my father inspired.--i will enter into obligations
this moment, said my father, to lay out all my aunt dinah's legacy in
charitable uses (of which, by the bye, my father had no high opinion),
if the corporal has any one determinate idea annexed to any one word
he has repeated.--prithee, trim, quoth my father, turning round to
him,--what dost thou mean, by 'honouring thy father and mother?'

allowing them, an' please your honour, three halfpence a day out of my
pay, when they grow old.--and didst thou do that, trim? said yorick.--he
did indeed, replied my uncle toby.--then, trim, said yorick, springing

now this being a little bald about the chin, by frequently putting off

family would wear it after. to cover the mask afresh, was more than the
mask was worth--and to wear a mask which was bald, or which could be
half seen through, was as bad as having no mask at all--

this is the reason, may it please your reverences, that in all our
