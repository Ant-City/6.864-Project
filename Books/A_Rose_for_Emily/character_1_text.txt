she was sick for a long time. when we saw her again, her hair was cut short, making her look like a girl, with a vague resemblance to those angels in colored church windows--sort of tragic and serene.
the town had just let the contracts for paving the sidewalks, and in the summer after her father's death they began the work. the construction company came with niggers and mules and machinery, and a foreman named homer barron, a yankee--a big, dark, ready man, with a big voice and eyes lighter than his face. the little boys would follow in groups to hear him cuss the niggers, and the niggers singing in time to the rise and fall of picks. pretty soon he knew everybody in town. whenever you heard a lot of laughing anywhere about the square, homer barron would be in the center of the group. presently we began to see him and miss emily on sunday afternoons driving in the yellow-wheeled buggy and the matched team of bays

miss emily just stared at him, her head tilted back in order to look him eye for eye, until he looked away and went and got the arsenic and wrapped it up. the negro delivery boy brought her the package; the druggist didn't come back. when she opened the package at home there was written on the box, under the skull and bones: "for rats."

so the next day we all said, "she will kill herself"; and we said it would be the best thing. when she had first begun to be seen with homer barron, we had said, "she will marry him." then we said, "she will persuade him yet," because homer himself had remarked--he liked men, and it was known that he drank with the younger men in the elks' club--that he was not a marrying man. later we said, "poor emily" behind the jalousies as they passed on sunday afternoon in the glittering buggy, miss emily with her head high and homer barron with his hat cocked and a cigar in his teeth, reins and whip in a yellow glove.
then some of the ladies began t

. at first nothing happened. then we were sure that they were to be married. we learned that miss emily had been to the jeweler's and ordered a man's toilet set in silver, with the letters h. b. on each piece. two days later we learned that she had bought a complete outfit of men's clothing, including a nightshirt, and we said, "they are married." we were really glad. we were glad because the two female cousins were even more grierson than miss emily had ever been.
so we were not surprised when homer barron--the streets had been finished some time since--was gone. we were a little disappointed that there was not a public blowing-off, but we believed that he had gone on to prepare for miss emily's coming, or to give her a chance to get rid of the cousins. (by that time it was a cabal, and we were all miss emily's allies to help circumvent the cousins.) sure enough, after another week they departed. and, as we had expected all along, within three days homer barron was back in town. a neighbor saw th

and that was the last we saw of homer barron. and of miss emily for some time. the negro man went in and out with the market basket, but the front door remained closed. now and then we would see her at a window for a moment, as the men did that night when they sprinkled the lime, but for almost six months she did not appear on the streets. then we knew that this was to be expected too; as if that quality of her father which had thwarted her woman's life so many times had been too virulent and too furious to die.
