quite a lot of competitiveness
about it, with everybody wanting to beat not only cancer
itself, but also the other people in the room. like, i realize
that this is irrational, but when they tell you that you have,
say, a 20 percent chance of living five years, the math kicks
in and you figure that's one in five ... so you look around
and think, as any healthy person would: i gotta outlast four
of these bastards.)

the only redeeming facet of support group was this
kid named isaac, a long-faced, skinny guy with straight
blond hair swept over one eye.

and his eyes were the problem. he had some
fantastically improbable eye cancer. one eye had been cut
out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick
glasses that made his eyes (both the real one and the glass
one) preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically
just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. from what
i could gather on the rare occasions when isaac shared with
the group, a recurrence h

isaac and i communicated almost exclusively through
sighs. each time someone discussed anticancer diets or
snorting ground-up shark fin or whatever, he'd glance
over at me and sigh ever so slightly. i'd shake my head
microscopically and exhale in response.

so support group blew, and after a few weeks, i grew to
be rather kicking-and-screaming about the whole affair.
in fact, on the wednesday i made the acquaintance of
augustus waters, i tried my level best to get out of support
group while sitting o

ertising a band i didn't even like anymore. also
my hair: i had this pageboy haircut, and i hadn't even
bothered to, like, brush it. furthermore, i had ridiculously
fat chipmunked cheeks, a side effect of treatment. i looked
like a normally proportioned person with a balloon for a
head. this was not even to mention the cankle situation.
and yet— i cut a glance to him, and his eyes were still on me.

it occurred to me why they call it eye contact.

i walked into the circle and sat down next to isaac,
two seats away from the boy. i glanced again. he was still
watching me.

look, let me just say it: he was hot. a nonhot boy
stares at you relentlessly and it is, at best, awkward and, at
worst, a form of assault. but a hot boy . . . well.

i pulled out my phone and clicked it so it would dis-
play the time: 4:59. the circle filled in with the unlucky
twelve-to-eighteens, and then patrick started us out with
the serenity prayer: god, grant me the serenity to accept the things

t rather blushy.

finally, i decided that the proper strategy was to stare
back. boys do not have a monopoly on the staring business,
after all. so i looked him over as patrick acknowledged for
the thousandth time his ball-lessness etc., and soon it was
a staring contest. after a while the boy smiled, and then
finally his blue eyes glanced away. when he looked back at
me, i flicked my eyebrows up to say, i win.

he shrugged. patrick continued and then finally it was
time for the introductions. "isaac, perhaps you'd like to go
first today. i know you're facing a challenging time."

"yeah," isaac said. "i'm isaac. i'm seventeen. and it's
looking like i have to get surgery in a couple weeks, after
which i'll be blind. not to complain or anything because i
know a lot of us have it worse, but yeah, i mean, being blind
does sort of suck. my girlfriend helps, though. and friends
like augustus." he nodded toward the boy, who now had
a name. "so, yeah," isaac continued. he was looking at his
hands,

which he'd folded into each other like the top of a
tepee. "there's nothing you can do about it."

"we're here for you, isaac," patrick said. "let isaac hear
it, guys." and then we all, in a monotone, said, "we're here
for you, isaac."

michael was next. he was twelve. he had leukemia.

he'd always had leukemia. he was okay. (or so he said. he'd
taken the elevator.)

lida was sixteen, and pretty enough to be the object
of the hot boy's eye. she was a regular— in a long remission
from appendiceal cancer, which i had not previously known
existed. she said— as she had every other time i'd attended
support group— that she felt strong, which felt like bragging
to me as the oxygen-drizzling

there were five others before they got to him. he smiled
a little when his turn came. his voice was low, smoky, and
dead sexy. "my name is augustus waters," he said. "i'm
seventeen. i had a little touch of osteosarcoma a year and a
half ago, but i'm just here today at isaac's request."

"and how are you feeling?" asked patrick.

"oh, i'm grand." augustus waters smiled with a corner
of his mouth. "i'm on a roller coaster that only goes up, my
friend."

when it was my turn, i said, "my name is hazel. i'm
sixteen. thyroid with mets in my lungs. i'm okay."

the hour proceeded apace: fights were recounted,
battles won amid wars sure to be lost; hope was clung to;
families were both celebrated and denounced; it was agreed
that friends just didn't get it; tears were shed

proffered. neither augustus waters nor i spoke again until
patrick said, "augustus, perhaps you'd like to share your
fears with the group."

"my fears?"
"yes."

"i fear oblivion," he said without a moment's pause.
"i fear it like the proverbial blind man who's afraid of the
dark."

"too soon," isaac said, cracking a smile.

"was that insensitive?" augustus asked. "i can be
pretty blind to other people's feelings."

isaac was laughing, but patrick raised a chastening
finger and said, "augustus, please. let's return to you and
your struggles. you said you fear oblivion?"

"i did," augustus answered.

patrick seemed lost. "would, uh, would anyone like to
speak to that?"

i hadn't been in proper school in three years. my
parents were my two best friends. my third best friend was
an author who did not know i existed. i was a fairly shy
person— not the hand-raising type.

and yet, just this once, i decided to speak

group. at the end, we all had to hold hands, and patrick led
us in a prayer. "lord jesus christ, we are gathered here in
your heart, literally in your heart, as cancer survivors. you and
you alone know us as we know ourselves. guide us to life
and the light through our times of trial. we pray for isaac's
eyes, for michael's and jamie's blood, for augustus's bones,
for hazel's lungs, for james's throat. we pray that you
might heal us and that we might feel your love, and your
peace, which passes all understanding. and we remember in
our hearts those whom we knew and loved who have gone
home to you: maria and kade and joseph and haley and
abigail and angelina and taylor and gabriel and . . ."

it was a long list. the world contains a lot of dead
people. and while patrick droned on, reading the

ening.

when patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra
together-living our best life today-and it was
over. augustus waters pushed himself out of his chair and
walked over to me. his gait was crooked like his smile. he
towered over me, but he kept his distance so i wouldn't
have to crane my neck to look him in the eye. "what's your
name?" he asked.

"hazel."



14



the fault in our stars



"no, your full name."

"um, hazel grace lancaster." he was just about to say
something else when isaac walked up. "hold on," augustus
said, raising a finger, and turned to isaac. "that was actually
worse than you made it out to be."

"i told you it was bleak."

"why do you bother with it?"

"i don't know. it kind of helps?"

augustus leaned in so he thought i couldn't hear.
"she's a regular?" i couldn't hear isaac's comment, but
augustus responded, "i'll say." he clasped isaac by both
shoulders and then took a half step away from him. "tell
hazel about clinic."

isaac leaned a hand against the s

"good luck with that. all right, i should go. monica's
waiting for me. i gotta look at her a lot while i can."

"counterinsurgence tomorrow?" augustus asked.

"definitely." isaac turned and ran up the stairs, taking
them two at a time.

augustus waters turned to me. "literally," he said.

"literally?" i asked.

"we are literally in the heart of jesus," he said. "i
thought we were in a church basement, but we are literally
in the heart of jesus."

"someone should tell jesus," i said. "i mean, it's gotta
be dangerous, storing children with cancer in your heart."

"i would tell him myself," augustus said, "but
unfortunately i am literally stuck inside of his heart, so he

to check you out. then, if it likes you, it takes the rest.

i followed him upstairs, losing ground as i made my
way up slowly, stairs not being a field of expertise for my
lungs.

and then we were out of jesus's heart and in the
parking lot, the spring air just on the cold side of perfect,
the late-afternoon light heavenly in its hurtfulness.

mom wasn't there yet, which was unusual, because
mom was almost always waiting for me. i glanced around
and saw that a tall, curvy brunette girl had isaac pinned
against the stone wall of the church, kissing him rather
aggressively. they were close enough to me that i could hear
the weird noises of their mouths together, and i could hear
him saying, "always," and her saying, "always," in return.

suddenly standing next to me, augustus half
whispered, "they're big believers in pda."

"what's with the 'always'?" the slurping sounds
intensified.

"always is their thing. they'll always love each other
and whatever. i would conservatively estimate the

a couple more cars drove up, taking michael and alisa

against a place of worship. his hand reached for her boob
over her shirt and pawed at it, his palm still while his fingers
moved around. i wondered if that felt good. didn't seem
like it would, but i decided to forgive isaac on the grounds
that he was going blind. the senses must feast while there
is yet hunger and whatever.

"imagine taking that last drive to the hospital," i said
quietly. "the last
