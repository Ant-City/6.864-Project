6. my lefe is fare in land: this seems to have been the refrain of
some old song, and its precise meaning is uncertain. it
corresponds in cadence with the morning salutation of the cock;
and may be taken as a greeting to the sun, which is beloved of
chanticleer, and has just come upon the earth -- or in the sense
of a more local boast, as vaunting the fairness of his favourite
hen above all others in the country round.

transcriber's note: later commentators explain "fare in land" as
"gone abroad" and  have identified the song:

my lefe is fare in lond
alas! why is she so?
and i am so sore bound
i may not come her to.
she hath my heart in hold
where ever she ride or go
with true love a thousand-fold.

(printed in the athenaeum, 1896, vol ii, p. 566).

"sir nunne's priest," our hoste said anon,
"y-blessed be thy breech, and every stone;
this was a merry tale of chanticleer.
but by my truth, if thou wert seculere,*                       *a layman

so great a neck, and such a large breast
he looketh as a sperhawk with his eyen
him needeth not his colour for to dyen
with brazil, nor with grain of portugale.
