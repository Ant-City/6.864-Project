it seemed to me then that i could interpret the look on the faces of those present; it
was one of almost respectful sympathy. the policemen, too, handled me very gently.
the lawyer placed his hand on my wrist. i had stopped thinking altogether. i heard
the judge’s voice asking if i had anything more to say. after thinking for a moment,
i answered, “no.” then the policemen led me out.

i have just refused, for the third time, to see the prison chaplain. i have nothing to
say  to  him,  don’t  feel  like  talking—and  shall  be  seeing  him  quite  soon  enough,
anyway. the only thing that interests me now is the problem of circumventing the
machine, learning if the inevitable admits a loophole.

they have moved me to another cell. in this one, lying on my back, i can see the
sky,  and  there  is  nothing  else  to  see.  all  my  time  is  spent  in  watching  the  slowly
changing  colors  of  the  sky,  as  day  moves  on  to  night.  i

was to calm down that sudden rush of joy racing through my
body and even bringing tears to my eyes. but it was up to me to bring my nerves to
heel and steady my mind; for, even in considering this possibility, i had to keep some
order in my thoughts, so as to make my consolations, as regards the first alternative,
more plausible. when i’d succeeded, i had earned a good hour’s peace of mind; and
that, anyhow, was something.

it was at one of these moments that i refused once again to see the chaplain. i was
lying down and could mark the summer evening coming on by a soft golden glow
spreading  across  the  sky.  i  had  just  turned  down  my  appeal,  and  felt  my  blood
circulating with slow, steady throbs. no, i didn’t want to see the chaplain. ... then i
did something i hadn’t done for quite a while;  i  fell  to  thinking  about  marie.  she
hadn’t  written  for  ages;  probably,  i  surmised,  she  had  grown  tired  of  being  the
mistress of a man sentenced to death. or she m

separated now, there was no link between us, nothing to remind us of each other?
supposing  she  were  dead,  her  memory  would  mean  nothing;  i  couldn’t  feel  an
interest  in  a  dead  girl.  this  seemed  to  me  quite  normal;  just  as  i  realized  people
would  soon  forget  me  once  i  was  dead.  i  couldn’t  even  say  that  this  was  hard  to
stomach; really, there’s no idea to which one doesn’t get acclimatized in time.

my thoughts had reached this point when the chaplain walked in, unannounced. i
couldn’t help giving a start on seeing him. he noticed this evidently, as he promptly
told  me  not  to  be  alarmed.  i  reminded  him  that  usually  his  visits  were  at  another
hour, and for a pretty grim occasion. this, he replied, was just a friendly visit; it had
no concern with my appeal, about which he knew nothing. then he sat down on my
bed, asking me to sit beside him. i refused—not because i had anything against him;
he seemed a mild, amiable man.

 out,  and,  what’s

more, could be no consolation.

he nodded. “maybe. still, if you don’t die soon, you’ll die one day. and then the

same question will arise. how will you face that terrible, final hour?”

i replied that i’d face it exactly as i was facing it now.
thereat he stood up, and looked me straight in the eyes. it was a trick i knew well.
i used to amuse myself trying it on emmanuel and céleste, and nine times out of ten
they’d look away uncomfortably. i could see the chaplain was an old hand at it, as
his gaze never faltered. and his voice was quite steady when he said: “have you no

hope  at  all?  do  you  really  think  that  when  you  die  you  die  outright,  and  nothing
remains?”

i said: “yes.”
he dropped his eyes and sat down again. he was truly sorry for me, he said. it

must make life unbearable for a man, to think as i did.

the  priest  was  beginning  to  bore  me,  and,  resting  a  shoulder  on  th

 i  informed  him  that  i’d  been  staring  at  those  walls  for
months; there was nobody, nothing in the  world, i knew better than i knew them.
and once upon a time, perhaps, i used to try to see a face. but it was a sun-gold face,
lit up with desire—marie’s face. i had no luck; i’d never seen it, and now i’d given
up  trying.  indeed,  i’d  never  seen  anything  “taking  form,”  as  he  called  it,  against
those gray walls.

the chaplain gazed at me with a sort of sadness. i now had my back to the wall
and  light  was  flowing  over  my  forehead.  he  muttered  some  words  i  didn’t  catch;
then abruptly asked if he might kiss me. i said, “no.” then he turned, came up to the
wall, and slowly drew his hand along it.

“do you really love these earthly things so very much?” he asked in a low voice.
i made no reply.
for  quite  a  while  he  kept  his  eyes  averted.  his  presence  was  getting  more  and
more irksome,

from paris who
had married masson, or as marie, who wanted me to marry her. what did it matter if
raymond was as much my pal as céleste, who was a far worthier man? what did it
matter if at this very moment marie was kissing a new boy friend? as a condemned
man  himself,  couldn’t  he  grasp  what  i  meant by that dark wind blowing from  my
future? ...

i  had  been  shouting  so  much  that  i’d  lost  my  breath,  and  just  then  the  jailers
rushed in and started trying to release the chaplain from my grip. one of them made
as if to strike me. the chaplain quietened them down, then gazed at me for a moment
without speaking. i could see tears in his eyes. then he turned and left the cell.

once he’d gone, i felt calm again. but all this excitement had exhausted me and i
dropped heavily on to my sleeping plank. i must have had a longish sleep, for, when
i  woke,  the  stars  were  shining  down  on  my  face.  sounds  of  the  countryside  came
faintly in, and the cool night air, vei
