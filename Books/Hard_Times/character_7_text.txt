t factories, which looked, when they were
illuminated, like fairy palacesâ€”or the travellers by express-train said
soâ€”were all extinguished; and the bells had rung for knocking off for the
night, and had ceased again; and the hands, men and women, boy and girl,
were clattering home.  old stephen was standing in the street, with the
old sensation upon him which the stoppage of the machinery always
producedâ€”the sensation of its having worked and stopped in his own head.

â€˜yet i donâ€™t see rachael, still!â€™ said he.

it was a wet night, and many groups of young women passed him, with their
shawls drawn over their bare heads and held close under their chins to
keep the rain out.  he knew rachael well, for a glance at any one of
these groups was sufficient to show him that she was not there.  at last,
there were no more to come; and then he turned away, saying in a tone of
disappointment, â€˜why, then, haâ€™ missed her!â€™

but, he had not gone the length of three streets, when he saw ano

ther of
the shawled figures in advance of him, at which he looked so keenly that
perhaps its mere shadow indistinctly reflected on the wet pavementâ€”if he
could have seen it without the figure itself moving along from lamp to
lamp, brightening and fading as it wentâ€”would have been enough to tell
him who was there.  making his pace at once much quicker and much softer,
he darted on until he was very near this figure, then fell into his
former walk, and called â€˜rachael!â€™

she turned, being then in the brightness of a lamp; and raising her hood
a little, showed a quiet oval face, dark and rather delicate, irradiated
by a pair of very gentle eyes, and further set off by the perfect order
of her shining black hair.  it was not a face in its first bloom; she was
a woman five and thirty years of age.

â€˜ah, lad!  â€™tis thou?â€™  when she had said this, with a smile which would
have been quite expressed, though nothing of her had been seen but her
pleasant eyes

, she replaced her hood again, and they went on together.

â€˜i thought thou wast ahind me, rachael?â€™

â€˜no.â€™

â€˜early tâ€™night, lass?â€™

â€˜â€™times iâ€™m a little early, stephen! â€™times a little late.  iâ€™m never to
be counted on, going home.â€™

â€˜nor going tâ€™other way, neither, â€™t seems to me, rachael?â€™

â€˜no, stephen.â€™

he looked at her with some disappointment in his face, but with a
respectful and patient conviction that she must be right in whatever she
did.  the expression was not lost upon her; she laid her hand lightly on
his arm a moment as if to thank him for it.

â€˜we are such true friends, lad, and such old friends, and getting to be
such old folk, now.â€™

â€˜no, rachael, thouâ€™rt as young as ever thou wast.â€™

â€˜one of us would be puzzled how to get old, stephen, withou

getting so too, both being alive,â€™ she answered, laughing; â€˜but, anyways,
weâ€™re such old friends, and tâ€™ hide a word of honest truth froâ€™ one
another would be a sin and a pity.  â€™tis better not to walk too much
together.  â€™times, yes!  â€™twould be hard, indeed, if â€™twas not to be at
all,â€™ she said, with a cheerfulness she sought to communicate to him.

â€˜â€™tis hard, anyways, rachael.â€™

â€˜try to think not; and â€™twill seem better.â€™

â€˜iâ€™ve tried a long time, and â€™taâ€™nt got better.  but thouâ€™rt right; â€™t
might mak fok talk, even of thee.  thou hast been that to me, rachael,
through so many year: thou hast done me so much good, and heartened of me
in that cheering way, that thy word is a law to me.  ah, lass, and a
bright good law!  better than some real ones.â€™

â€˜never fret about them, stephen,â€™ she answered quickly, and not without
an anxious glance at

 his face.  â€˜let the laws be.â€™

â€˜yes,â€™ he said, with a slow nod or two.  â€˜let â€™em be.  let everything be.
let all sorts alone.  â€™tis a muddle, and thatâ€™s aw.â€™

â€˜always a muddle?â€™ said rachael, with another gentle touch upon his arm,
as if to recall him out of the thoughtfulness, in which he was biting the
long ends of his loose neckerchief as he walked along.  the touch had its
instantaneous effect.  he let them fall, turned a smiling face upon her,
and said, as he broke into a good-humoured laugh, â€˜ay, rachael, lass,
awlus a muddle.  thatâ€™s where i stick.  i come to the muddle many times
and agen, and i never get beyond it.â€™

they had walked some distance, and were near their

scarcely heard above its crash and rattle.  long before then his thoughts
had gone back to the dreary room above the little shop, and to the
shameful figure heavy on the bed, but heavier on his heart.

machinery slackened; throbbing feebly like a fainting pulse; stopped.
the bell again; the glare of light and heat dispelled; the factories,
looming heavy in the black wet nightâ€”their tall chimneys rising up into
the air like competing towers of babel.

he had spoken to rachael only last night, it was true, and had walked
with her a little way; but he had his new misfortune on him, in which no
one else could give him a momentâ€™s relief, and, for the sake of it, and
because he knew himself to want that softening of his anger which no
voice but hers could effect, he felt he might so far disregard what she
had said as to wait for her again.  he waited, but she had eluded him.
she was gone.  on no other night in the year could he so ill have spared
her patient face.

 better to have no home in which to lay his head, than to have a home
and dread to go to it, through such a cause.  he ate and drank, for he
was exhaustedâ€”but he little knew or cared what; and he wandered about in
the chill rain, thinking and thinking, and brooding and brooding.

no word of a new marriage had ever passed between them; but rachael had
taken great pity on him years ago, and to her alone he had opened his
closed heart all this time, on the subject of his miseries; and he knew
very well that if he were free to ask her, she would take him.  he
thought of the home he might at that moment have been seeking with
pleasure and pride; of the different man he might have been that night;
of the lightness then in his now heavy-laden breast; of the then restored
honour, self-respect, and tranquillity all torn to pieces.  he thought of

the waste of the best part of his life, of the change it made in his
character for the worse every day, of the dreadful nature of his
existence, bound hand and foot, to a dead woman, and tormented by a demon
in her shape.  he thought of rachael, how young when they were first
brought together in these circumstances, how mature now, how soon to grow
old.  he thought of the number of girls and women she had seen marry, how
many homes with children in them she had seen grow up around her, how she
had contentedly pursued her own lone quiet pathâ€”for himâ€”and how he had
sometimes seen a shade of melancholy on her blessed face, that smote him
with remorse and despair.  he set the picture of her up, beside the
infamous image of last night;

filled with these thoughtsâ€”so filled that he had an unwholesome sense of
growing larger, of being placed in some new and diseased relation towards
the objects among which he passed, of seeing the iris round every misty
light turn redâ€”he went home for shelter.



chapter xiii
rachael


a candle faintly burned in the window, to which the black ladder had
often been raised for the sliding away of all that was most precious in
this world to a striving wife and a brood of hungry babies; and stephen
added to his other thoughts the stern reflection, that of all the
casualties of this existence upon earth, not one was dealt out with so
unequal a hand as death.  the inequality of birth was nothing to it.
for, say that the child of a king and the child of a weaver were born
to-night

 in the same moment, what was that disparity, to the death of any
human creature who was serviceable to, or beloved by, another, while this
abandoned woman lived on!

from the outside of his home he gloomily passed to the inside, with
suspended breath and with a slow footstep.  he went up to his door,
opened it, and so into the room.

quiet and peace were there.  rachael was there, sitting by the bed.

she turned her head, and the light of her face shone in upon the midnight
of his mind.  she sat by the bed, watching and tending his wife.  that is
to say, he saw that some one lay there, and he knew too well it must be
she; but rachaelâ€™s hands had put a curtain up, so that she was screened
from his eyes.  her disgraceful garments were removed, and some of
rachaelâ€™s were in the room.  everything was in its place and order as he
had always kept it, the little

fire was newly trimmed, and the hearth was
freshly swept.  it appeared to him that he saw all this in rachaelâ€™s
face, and looked at nothing besides.  while looking at it, it was shut
out from his view by the softened tears that filled his eyes; but not
before he had seen how earnestly she looked at him, and how her own eyes
were filled too.

she turned again towards the bed, and satisfying herself that all was
quiet there, spoke in a low, calm, cheerful voice.

â€˜i am glad you have come at last, stephen.  you are very late.â€™

â€˜i haâ€™ been walking up anâ€™ down.â€™

â€˜i thought so.  but â€™tis

he laid his furrowed forehead on his hand, with a low groan.

â€˜and next, for that i know your heart, and am right sure and certain that
â€™tis far too merciful to let her die, or even so much as suffer, for want
of aid.  thou knowest who said, â€œlet him who is without sin among you
cast the first stone at her!â€  there have been plenty to do that.  thou
art not the man to cast the last stone, stephen, when she is brought so
low.â€™

â€˜o rachael, rachael!â€™

â€˜thou hast been a cruel sufferer, heaven reward thee!â€™ she said, in
compassionate accents.  â€˜i am thy poor friend, with all my heart and
mind.â€™

             [picture: stephen and rachael in the sick room]

the wounds of which she had spoken, seemed to be about the neck of the
self-made outcast.  she dressed them now, still without showing her.  she
steeped a piece of linen in a basin, into which she poured some liquid
from a bottle, and laid it with a gentle hand upon the

it was not so far off, but that stephen, following her hands with his
eyes, could read what was printed on it in large letters.  he turned of a
deadly hue, and a sudden horror seemed to fall upon him.

â€˜i will stay here, stephen,â€™ said rachael, quietly resuming her seat,
â€˜till the bells go three.  â€™tis to be done again at three, and then she
may be left till morning.â€™

â€˜but thy rest agen to-morrowâ€™s work, my dear.â€™

â€˜i slept sound last night.  i can wake many nights, when i am put to it.
â€™tis thou who art in need of restâ€”so white and tired.  try to sleep in
the chair there, while i watch.  thou hadst no sleep last night, i can
well believe.  to-morrowâ€™s work is far harder for thee than for me.â€™

he heard the thu

ndering and surging out of doors, and it seemed to him as
if his late angry mood were going about trying to get at him.  she had
cast it out; she would keep it out; he trusted to her to defend him from
himself.

â€˜she donâ€™t know me, stephen; she just drowsily mutters and stares.  i
have spoken to her times and again, but she donâ€™t notice!  â€™tis as well
so.  when she comes to her right mind once more, i shall have done what i
can, and she never the wiser.â€™

â€˜how long, rachael, is â€™t looked for, that sheâ€™ll be so?â€™

â€˜doctor said she would haply come to her mind to-morrow.â€™

his eyes fell again on the bottle, and a tremble passed over him, causing
him to shiver in every limb.  she thought he was chilled with the wet.
â€˜no,â€™ he said, â€˜it was not that.  he had had a fright.â€™

â€˜a fright?â€™

â€˜ay, ay! coming in.  when i were walking.  when i were thinking.  when
iâ€”â€™  it seized him again; and he stood up, holding by the mantel-shelf,
as he pressed

she was coming to him, but he stretched out his arm to stop her.

â€˜no!  donâ€™t, please; donâ€™t.  let me see thee setten by the bed.  let me
see thee, aâ€™ so good, and so forgiving.  let me see thee as i see thee
when i coom in.  i can never see thee better than so.  never, never,
never!â€™

he had a violent fit of trembling, and then sunk into his chair.  after a
time he controlled himself, and, resting with an elbow on one knee, and
his head upon that hand, could look towards rachael.  seen across the dim
candle with his moistened eyes, she looked as if she had a glory shining
round her head.  he could have believed she had.  he did believe it, as
the noise without shook the window, rattled at the door below, and went
about the house clamouring and lamenting.

â€˜when she gets better, stephen, â€™tis to be hoped sheâ€™ll leave thee to
thyself again, and do thee no more hurt.  anyways we will hope so now.
and now i shall keep silence, for i want thee to sleep.â€™

he closed 
 
 ___________________________
 
his eyes, more to please her than to rest his weary head; but,
by slow degrees as he listened to the great noise of the wind, he ceased
to hear it, or it changed into the working of his loom, or even into the
voices of the day (his own included) saying what had been really said.
even this imperfect consciousness faded away at last, and he dreamed a
long, troubled dream.

he thought that he, and some one on whom his heart had long been setâ€”but
she was not rachael, and that surprised him, even in the midst of his
imaginary happinessâ€”stood in the church being married.  while the
ceremony was performing, and while he recognized among the witnesses some
whom he knew to be living, and many whom he knew to be dead, darkness
came on, succeeded by the shining of a tremendous light.  it broke from
one line in the table of commandments at the altar, and illuminated the
building with the words.  they were sounded through the church, too, as
if there were voices 
 
 ___________________________
 
 and, looking up at
the shape the loom took, and hearing the burial service distinctly read,
he knew that he was there to suffer death.  in an instant what he stood
on fell below him, and he was gone.

â€”out of what mystery he came back to his usual life, and to places that
he knew, he was unable to consider; but he was back in those places by
some means, and with this condemnation upon him, that he was never, in
this world or the next, through all the unimaginable ages of eternity, to
look on rachaelâ€™s face or hear her voice.  wandering to and fro,
unceasingly, without hope, and in search of he knew not what (he only
knew that he was doomed to seek it), he was the subject of a nameless,
horrible dread, a mortal fear of one particular shape which everything
took.  whatsoever he looked at, grew into that form sooner or later.  the
object of his miserable existence was to prevent its recognition by any
one among the various people he encountered.  hopeless labour!  if he led
them out of room

s where it was, if he shut up drawers and closets where
it stood, if he drew the curious from places where he knew it to be
secreted, and got them out into the streets, the very chimneys of the
mills assumed that shape, and round them was the printed word.

the wind was blowing again, the rain was beating on the house-tops, and
the larger spaces through which he had strayed contracted to the four
walls of his room.  saving that the fire had died out, it was as his eyes
had closed upon it.  rachael seemed to have fallen into a doze, in the
chair by the bed.  she sat wrapped in her shawl, perfectly still.  the
table stood in the same place, close by the bedside, and on it, in its
real proportions and appearance, was the shape so often repeated.

he thought he saw the curtain move.  he looked again, and he was sure it
moved.  he saw a hand come forth and grope about a little.  then the
curtain moved more perceptibly, and the woman in the bed put it back, and
sat up.

with her woful eyes, so
 
 ___________________________
 
 haggard and wild, so heavy and large, she looked
all round the room, and passed the corner where he slept in his chair.
her eyes returned to that corner, and she put her hand over them as a
shade, while she looked into it.  again they went all round the room,
scarcely heeding rachael if at all, and returned to that corner.  he
thought, as she once more shaded themâ€”not so much looking at him, as
looking for him with a brutish instinct that he was thereâ€”that no single
trace was left in those debauched features, or in the mind that went
along with them, of the woman he had married eighteen years before.  but
that he had seen her come to this by inches, he never could have believed
her to be the same.

all this time, as if a spell were on him, he was motionless and

 his corner, with the defiance of
last night, and moving very cautiously and softly, stretched out her
greedy hand.  she drew a mug into the bed, and sat for a while
considering which of the two bottles she should choose.  finally, she
laid her insensate grasp upon the bottle that had swift and certain death
in it, and, before his eyes, pulled out the cork with her teeth.

dream or reality, he had no voice, nor had he power to stir.  if this be
real, and her allotted time be not yet come, wake, rachael, wake!

she thought of that, too.  she looked at rachael, and very slowly, very
cautiously, poured out the contents.  the draught was at her lips.  a
moment and she would be past all help, let the whole world wake and come
about her with its utmost power.  but in that moment rachael started up
with a suppressed cry.  the creature struggled, struck her, seized her by
the hair; but rachael had the cup.

stephen broke out of his chair.  â€˜rachael, am i wakinâ€™ or dreaminâ€™ this

quiet again.  the few drops in the basin iâ€™ll pour away, for â€™tis bad
stuff to leave about, though ever so little of it.â€™  as she spoke, she
drained the basin into the ashes of the fire, and broke the bottle on the
hearth.

she had nothing to do, then, but to cover herself with her shawl before
going out into the wind and rain.

â€˜thouâ€™lt let me walk wiâ€™ thee at this hour, rachael?â€™

â€˜no, stephen.  â€™tis but a minute, and iâ€™m home.â€™

â€˜thouâ€™rt not fearfoâ€™;â€™ he said it in a low voice, as they went out at the
door; â€˜to leave me alone wiâ€™ her!â€™

as she looked at him, saying, â€˜stephen?â€™ he went down on his knee before
her, on the poor mean stairs, and put an end of her shawl to his lips.

â€˜thou art an angel.  bless thee, bless thee!â€™

â€˜i am, as i have told thee, stephen, thy poor friend.  angels are not

â€œhow can _i_ say what i might haâ€™ done to myseln, or her, or both!â€â€™

she put her two hands on his mouth, with a face of terror, to stop him
from saying more.  he caught them in his unoccupied hand, and holding
them, and still clasping the border of her shawl, said hurriedly:

â€˜but i see thee, rachael, setten by the bed.  i haâ€™ seen thee, aw this
night.  in my troublous sleep i haâ€™ known thee still to be there.

he kissed the border of her shawl again, and let her go.  she bade him
good night in a broken voice, and went out into the street.

the wind blew from the quarter where the day would soon appear, and still
blew strongly.  it had cleared the sky before it, and the rain had spent
itself or travelled elsewhere, and the stars were bright.  he stood
bare-headed in the road, watching her quick disappearance.  as the
shining stars were to the heavy candle in the window, so was rachael, in
the rugged fancy of this man, to the common experiences of his life.

the great manufacturer


time went on in coketown like its own machinery: so much material wrought
up, so much fuel consumed, so many powers worn out, so much money made.
but, less inexorable than iron, steel, and brass, it brought its varying
seasons even into that wilderness of smoke and brick, and made the only
stand that ever _was_ made in the place against its direful uniformity.

gth of the want in his heart for the frequent
recognition of a nod, a look, a word; or the immense amount of relief
that had been poured into it by drops through such small means.  it was
even harder than he could have believed possible, to separate in his own
conscience his abandonment by all his fellows from a baseless sense of
shame and disgrace.

the first four days of his endurance were days so long and heavy, that he
began to be appalled by the prospect before him.  not only did he see no
rachael all the time, but he avoided every chance of seeing her; for,
although he knew that the prohibition did not yet formally extend to the
women working in the factories, he found that some of them with whom he
was acquainted were changed to him, and he feared to try others, and
dreaded that rachael might be even singled out from the rest if she were
seen in his company.  so, he had been quite alone during the four days,
and had spoken to no one, when, as he was leaving his work at night, a

fading away


it was falling dark when stephen came out of mr. bounderbyâ€™s house.  the
shadows of night had gathered so fast, that he did not look about him
when he closed the door, but plodded straight along the street.  nothing
was further from his thoughts than the curious old woman he had
encountered on his previous visit to the same house, when he heard a step
behind him that he knew, and turning, saw her in rachaelâ€™s company.

he saw rachael first, as he had heard her only.

â€˜ah, rachael, my dear!  missus, thou wiâ€™ her!â€™

â€˜well, and now you are surprised to be sure, and with reason i must say,â€™
the old woman returned.  â€˜here i am again, you see.â€™

â€˜but how wiâ€™ rachael?â€™ said stephen, falling into their step, walking
between them, and looking from the one to the other.

and her face being so friendly i spoke to her, and she spoke to me.
there!â€™ said the old woman to stephen, â€˜you can make all the rest out for
yourself now, a deal shorter than i can, i dare say!â€™

once again, stephen had to conquer an instinctive propensity to dislike
this old woman, though her manner was as honest and simple as a manner
possibly could be.  with a gentleness that was as natural to him as he
knew it to be to rachael, he pursued the subject that interested her in
her old age.

â€˜well, missus,â€™ said he, â€˜i ha seen the lady, and she were young and
hansom.  wiâ€™ fine dark thinkin eyes, and a still way, rachael, as i ha
never seen the like on.â€™

â€˜young and handsome.  yes!â€™ cried the old woman, quite delighted.  â€˜as
bonny as a rose!  and what a happy wife!â€™

â€˜aye, missus, i suppose she be,â€™ said stephen.  but with a doubtful
glance at rachael.

â€˜suppose she be?  she must be.  sheâ€™s your m

old woman.

stephen nodded assent.  â€˜though as to master,â€™ said he, glancing again at
rachael, â€˜not master onny more.  thatâ€™s aw enden â€™twixt him and me.â€™

â€˜have you left his work, stephen?â€™ asked rachael, anxiously and quickly.

â€˜why, rachael,â€™ he replied, â€˜whether i ha lefâ€™n his work, or whether his
work ha lefâ€™n me, cooms tâ€™ thâ€™ same.  his work and me are parted.  â€™tis
as weel soâ€”better, i were thinkin when yo coom up wiâ€™ me.  it would ha

kindness to monny that i go; haply â€™tis a kindness to myseln; anyways it

â€˜i donno tâ€™night,â€™ said he, lifting off his hat, and smoothing his thin
hair with the flat of his hand.  â€˜but iâ€™m not goin tâ€™night, rachael, nor
yet tâ€™morrow.  â€™tanâ€™t easy overmuch tâ€™ know wheer tâ€™ turn, but a good
heart will coom to me.â€™

herein, too, the sense of even thinking unselfishly aided him.  before he
had so much as closed mr. bounderbyâ€™s door, he had reflected that at
least his being obliged to go away was good for her, as it would save her
from the chance of being brought into question for not withdrawing from
him.  though it would cost him a hard pang to leave her, and though he
could think of no similar

pursue him, perhaps it was almost a relief to be forced away from the
endurance of the last four days, even to unknown difficulties and
distresses.

so he said, with truth, â€˜iâ€™m more leetsome, rachael, under â€™t, than i
couldâ€™n ha believed.â€™  it was not her part to make his burden heavier.
she answered with her comforting smile, and the three walked on together.

age, especially when it strives to be self-reliant and cheerful, finds
much consideration among the poor.  the old woman was so decent and
contented, and made so light of her infirmities, though they had
increased upon her since her former interview with stephen, that they
both took an interest in her.  she was too sprightly to

walking at a slow pace on her account, but she was very grateful to be
talked to, and very willing to talk to any extent: so, when they came to
their part of the town, she was more brisk and vivacious than ever.

â€˜come to my poor place, missus,â€™ said stephen, â€˜and tak a coop oâ€™ tea.
rachael will coom then; and arterwards iâ€™ll see thee safe tâ€™ thy
travellersâ€™ lodgin.  â€™t may be long, rachael, ere ever i ha thâ€™ chance oâ€™
thy coompany agen.â€™

they complied, and the three went on to the house where he lodged.  when
they turned into a narrow street, stephen glanced at his window with a
dread that always haunted his desolate home; but it was open, as he had
left it, and no one was there.  the evil spirit of his life had flitted
away again, months ago, and he had heard no more of her since.  the only
evidence of her last return now, were the scantier moveables in his room,
and the

he lighted a candle, set out his little tea-board, got hot water from
below, and brought in small portions of tea and sugar, a loaf, and some
butter from the nearest shop.  the bread was new and crusty, the butter
fresh, and the sugar lump, of courseâ€”in fulfilment of the standard
testimony of the coketown magnates, that these people lived like princes,
sir.  rachael made the tea (so large a party necessitated the borrowing
of a cup), and the visitor enjoyed it mightily.  it was the first glimpse
of sociality the host had had for many days.  he too, with the world a
wide heath before him, enjoyed the mealâ€”again in corroboration of the
magnates, as exemplifying the utter want of calculation on the part of
these people, sir.

â€˜i ha never thowt yet, missus,â€™ said stephen, â€˜oâ€™ askin thy name.â€™

the old lady announced herself as â€˜mrs. pegler.â€™

â

€˜a widder, i think?â€™ said stephen.

â€˜oh, many long years!â€™  mrs. peglerâ€™s husband (one of the best on record)
was already dead, by mrs. peglerâ€™s calculation, when stephen was born.

â€˜â€™twere a bad job, too, to lose so good a one,â€™ said stephen.  â€˜onny
children?â€™

mrs. peglerâ€™s cup, rattling against her saucer as she held it, denoted
some nervousness on her part.  â€˜no,â€™ she said.  â€˜not now, not now.â€™

â€˜dead, stephen,â€™ rachael softly hinted.

â€˜iâ€™m sooary i ha spokâ€™n on â€™t,â€™ said stephen, â€˜i ought tâ€™ hadn in my mind
as i might touch a sore place.  iâ€”i blame myseln.â€™

while he excused himself, the old ladyâ€™s cup rattled more and more.  â€˜i
had a son,â€™ she said, curiously distressed, and not by any of the usual
appearances of sorrow; â€˜and he did well, wonderfully well.  but he is not
to be spoken of if you please.  he isâ€”â€™  putting down her cup, she moved
her hands as if she would have added

t yet got the better of his having given the old lady pain,
when his landlady came stumbling up the narrow stairs, and calling him to
the door, whispered in his ear.  mrs. pegler was by no means deaf, for
she caught a word as it was uttered.

â€˜bounderby!â€™ she cried, in a suppressed voice, starting up from the
table.  â€˜oh hide me!  donâ€™t let me be seen for the world.  donâ€™t let him
come up till iâ€™ve got away.  pray, pray!â€™  she trembled, and was
excessively agitated; getting behind rachael, when rachael tried to
reassure her; and not seeming to know what she was about.

â€˜but hearken, missus, hearken,â€™ said stephen, astonished.  â€˜â€™tisnâ€™t mr.
bounderby; â€™tis his wife.  yoâ€™r not fearfoâ€™ oâ€™ her.  yo was hey-go-mad
about her, but an hour sin.â€™

â€˜but are you sure itâ€™s the lady, and not the gentleman?â€™ she asked, still
trembling.

â€˜certain sure!â€™

â€˜well then, pray donâ€™t speak to me, nor yet take any notice of me,â€™ said
the old woman.  â€˜let me be qui

te to myself in this corner.â€™

stephen nodded; looking to rachael for an explanation, which she was
quite unable to give him; took the candle, went downstairs, and in a few
moments returned, lighting louisa into the room.  she was followed by the
whelp.

rachael had risen, and stood apart with her shawl and bonnet in her hand,
when stephen, himself profoundly astonished by this visit, put the candle
on the table.  then he too stood, with his doubled hand upon the table
near it, waiting to be addressed.

for the first time in her life louisa had come into one of the dwellings
of the coketown hands; for the first time in her life she was face to
face with anything like individuality in connection with them.  she knew
of their existence by hundreds and by

 again; this she knew
the coketown hands to be.  but, she had scarcely thought more of
separating them into units, than of separating the sea itself into its
component drops.

she stood for some moments looking round the room.  from the few chairs,
the few books, the common prints, and the bed, she glanced to the two
women, and to stephen.

â€˜i have come to speak to you, in consequence of what passed just now.  i
should like to be serviceable to you, if you will let me.  is this your
wife?â€™

rachael raised her eyes, and they sufficiently answered no, and dropped
again.

â€˜i remember,â€™ said louisa, reddening at her mistake; â€˜i recollect, now,
to have heard your domestic misfortunes spoken of, though i was not
attending to the particulars at the time.  it was not my meaning to ask a
question that would give pain to any one here.  if i should ask any other
question that may happen to have that result, give me credit, if you
please, for being in ignorance how to speak to you as i ought.â€

as stephen had but a little while ago instinctively addressed himself to
her, so she now instinctively addressed herself to rachael.  her manner
was short and abrupt, yet faltering and timid.

â€˜he has told you what has passed between himself and my husband?  you
would be his first resource, i think.â€™

â€˜i have heard the end of it, young lady,â€™ said rachael.

â€˜did i understand, that, being rejected by one employer, he would
probably be rejected by all?  i thought he said as much?â€™

â€˜the chances are very small, young ladyâ€”next to nothingâ€”for a man who
gets a bad name among them.â€™

â€˜what shall i understand that you mean by a bad name?â€™

â€˜the name of being troublesome.â€™

â€˜then, by the prejudices of his own class, and by the prejudices of the
other, he is sacrificed alike?  are the two so deeply separated in this
town, that there
 
 ___________________________
 
 is no place whatever for an honest workman between
them?â€™

rachael shook her head in silence.

â€˜he fell into suspicion,â€™ said louisa, â€˜with his fellow-weavers,
becauseâ€”he had made a promise not to be one of them.  i think it must
have been to you that he made that promise.  might i ask you why he made
it?â€™

rachael burst into tears.  â€˜i didnâ€™t seek it of him, poor lad.  i prayed
him to avoid trouble for his own good, little thinking heâ€™d come to it
through me.  but i know heâ€™d die a hundred deaths, ere ever heâ€™d break
his word.  i know that of him well.â€™

stephen had remained quietly attentive, in his usual thoughtful attitude,
with his hand at his chin.  he now spoke in a voice rather less steady
than usual.

â€˜no one, excepting myseln, can ever know what honour, anâ€™ what love, anâ€™

promess, i towd her true, she were thâ€™ angel oâ€™ my life.  â€™twere a solemn
promess.  â€™tis gone froâ€™ me, for ever.â€™

louisa turned her head to him, and bent it with a deference that was new
in her.  she looked from him to rachael, and her features softened.
â€˜what will you do?â€™ she asked him.  and her voice had softened too.

â€˜weel, maâ€™am,â€™ said stephen, making the best of it, with a smile; â€˜when i
ha finished off, i mun quit this part, and try another.  fortnet or
misfortnet, a man can but try; thereâ€™s nowt to be done wiâ€™out tryinâ€™â€”cept

â€˜how will you travel?â€™

â€˜afoot, my kind ledy, afoot.â€™

louisa coloured, and a purse appeared in her hand.  the rustling of a

â€˜rachael, will you tell himâ€”for you know how, without offenceâ€”that this
is freely his, to help him on his way?  will you entreat him to take it?â€™

â€˜i canna do that, young lady,â€™ she answered, turning her head aside.
â€˜bless you for thinking oâ€™ the poor lad wiâ€™ such tenderness.  but â€™tis
for him to know his heart, and what is right according to it.â€™

louisa looked, in part incredulous, in part frightened, in part overcome
with quick sympathy, when this man of so much self-command, who 
 
 ___________________________
 
had been
so plain and steady through the late interview, lost his composure in a
moment, and now stood with his hand before his face.  she stretched out
hers, as if she would have touched him; then checked herself, and
remained still.

â€˜not eâ€™en rachael,â€™ said stephen, when he stood again with his face
uncovered, â€˜could mak sitch a kind offerin, by onny words, kinder.  tâ€™

smaller sum he had named.  he

gone, and until stephen came back with the candle in his hand.  she was
in a state of inexpressible admiration of mrs. bounderby, and, like an
unaccountable old woman, wept, â€˜because she was such a pretty dear.â€™  yet
mrs. pegler was so flurried lest the object of her admiration should
return by chance, or anybody else should come, that her cheerfulness was
ended for that night.  it was late too, to people who rose early and
worked hard; therefore the party broke up; and stephen and rachael
escorted their mysterious acquaintance to the door of the travellersâ€™
coffee house, where they parted from her.

they walked back together to the corner of the street where rachael
lived, and as they drew nearer and nearer to it, silence crept upon them.
when they came to the dark corner where their unfrequent meetings always
ended, they stopped, still silent, as if both were afraid to speak.

arranged for his departure.  he meant to be clear of the town very early;
before the hands were in the streets.

it was barely daybreak, when, with a parting look round his room,
mournfully wondering whether he should ever see it again, he went out.
the town was as entirely deserted as if the inhabitants had abandoned it,
rather than hold communication with him.  everything looked wan at that
hour.  even the coming sun made but a pale waste in the sky, like a sad
sea.

by the place where rachael lived, though it was not in his way; by the
red brick streets; by the great silent factories, not trembling yet; by
the railway, where the danger-lights were waning in the strengthening
day; by the railwayâ€™s crazy neighbourhood, half pulled down and half
built up; by scattered red brick villas, where the besmoked evergreens
were sprinkled with a dirty powder, like untidy snuff-takers; by
coal-dust paths and many varieties of ugliness; stephen got to the top of
the hill, and looked back.

hese were pigmies against an
army; the general assemblage subscribed to the gospel according to
slackbridge, and gave three cheers for him, as he sat demonstratively
panting at them.

these men and women were yet in the streets, passing quietly to their
homes, when sissy, who had been called away from louisa some minutes
before, returned.

â€˜who is it?â€™ asked louisa.

â€˜it is mr. bounderby,â€™ said sissy, timid of the name, â€˜and your brother
mr. tom, and a young woman who says her name is rachael, and that you
know her.â€™

â€˜what do they want, sissy dear?â€™

â€˜they want to see you.  rachael has been crying, and seems angry.â€™

â€˜father,â€™ said louisa, for he was present, â€˜i cannot refuse to see them,
for a reason that will explain itself.  shall they come in here?â€™

as he answered in the affirmative, sissy went away to bring them.  she
reappeared with them directly.  tom was last; and remained standing in
the obscurest part of the room, near the door.

or other to say anything at all about those statements, good or bad, i am
obliged to confront her with your daughter.â€™

â€˜you have seen me once before, young lady,â€™ said rachael, standing in
front of louisa.

tom coughed.

â€˜you have seen me, young lady,â€™ repeated rachael, as she did not answer,
â€˜once before.â€™

tom coughed again.

â€˜i have.â€™

rachael cast her eyes proudly towards mr. bounderby, and said, â€˜will you
make it known, young lady, where, and who was there?â€™

â€˜why couldnâ€™t you say so, young tom?â€™ demanded bounderby.

â€˜i promised my sister i wouldnâ€™t.â€™  which louisa hastily confirmed.  â€˜and
besides,â€™ said the whelp bitterly, â€˜she tells her own story so precious
wellâ€”and so fullâ€”that what business had i to take it out of her mouth!â€™

â€˜say, young lady, if you please,â€™ pursued rachael, â€˜why, in an evil hour,
you ever came to stephenâ€™s that night.â€™

â€˜i felt compassion for him,â€™ said louisa, her colour deepening, â€˜and i
wished to know what he was going to do, and wished to offer him
assistance.â€™

â€˜thank you, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby.  â€˜much flattered and obliged.â€™

â€˜did you offer him,â€™ asked rachael, â€˜a bank-note?â€™

â€˜yes; but he refused it, and would only take two pounds in gold.â€™

rachael cast her eyes towards mr. bounderby again.

failed her, and she broke off sobbing.

â€˜i am very, very sorry,â€™ said louisa.

lad.  i said then, bless you for coming; and i said it of my heart, you
seemed to take so pitifully to him; but i donâ€™t know now, i donâ€™t know!â€™

louisa could not reproach her for her unjust suspicions; she was so
faithful to her idea of the man, and so afflicted.

â€˜and when i think,â€™ said rachael through her sobs, â€˜that the poor lad was
so grateful, thinkin you so good to himâ€”when i mind that he put his hand
over his hard-worken face to hide the tears that you brought up thereâ€”oh,
i hope you may be sorry, and haâ€™ no bad cause to be it; but i donâ€™t know,
i donâ€™t know!â€™

corner, â€˜to come here with these precious imputations!  you ought to be

she said nothing in reply; and her low weeping was the only sound that
was heard, until mr. bounderby spoke.

give your mind to that; not this.â€™

â€˜â€™deed, i am loath,â€™ returned rachael, drying her eyes, â€˜that any here
should see me like this; but i wonâ€™t be seen so again.  young lady, when
i had read whatâ€™s put in print of stephenâ€”and what has just as much truth
in it as if it had been put in print of youâ€”i went straight to the bank
to say i knew where stephen was, and to give a sure and certain promise
that he should be here in two days.  i couldnâ€™t meet wiâ€™ mr. bounderby
then, and your brother sent me away, and i tried to find you, but you was
not to be found,

thatâ€™s true enough,â€™ assented mr. bounderby, with his hands in
his pockets and his hat on.  â€˜but i have known you people before to-day,

recommend you not so much to mind talking just now, as doing.  you have
undertaken to do something; all i remark upon that at present is, do it!â€™

â€˜i have written to stephen by the post that went out this afternoon, as i
have written to him once before sinâ€™ he went away,â€™ said rachael; â€˜and he
will be here, at furthest, in two days.â€™

â€˜then, iâ€™ll tell you something.  you are not aware perhaps,â€™ retorted mr.
bounderby, â€˜that you yourself have been looked after now and then, not
being considered quite free from suspicion in this business, on account
of most people being judged according to the company they keep.  the
post-office hasnâ€™t been forgotten either.  what iâ€™ll tell you is, that no

â€˜he hadnâ€™t been gone from here, young lady,â€™ said rachael, turning
appealingly to louisa, â€˜as much as a week, when he sent me the only
letter i have had from him, saying that he was forced to seek work in
another name.â€™

â€˜oh, by george!â€™ cried bounderby, shaking his head, with a whistle, â€˜he
changes his name, does he!  thatâ€™s rather unlucky, too, for such an
immaculate chap.  itâ€™s considered a little suspicious in courts of
justice, i believe, when an innocent happens to have many names.â€™

â€˜what,â€™ said rachael, with the tears in he

â€˜you need have no fear of that, young lady.  he is sure!â€™

â€˜all the surer, i suppose,â€™ said mr. bounderby, â€˜for your refusing to
tell where he is?  eh?â€™

â€˜he shall not, through any act of mine, come back wiâ€™ the unmerited
reproach of being brought back.  he shall come back of his own accord to
clear himself, and put all those that have injured his good character,
and he not here for its defence, to shame.  i have told him what has been
done against him,â€™ said rachael, throwing off all distrust as a rock
throws of the sea, â€˜and he will be here, at furthest, in two days.â€™

â€˜notwithstanding which,â€™ added mr. bounderby, â€˜if he can be laid hold of
any sooner, he shall have an earlier opportunity of clearing himself.  as
to you, i have nothing against you; what you came and told me turns out
to be true, and i have given you the means of proving it to be true, and
thereâ€™s an end of it.  i wish you good night all!  i must be off to look

 into this.â€™

tom came out of his corner when mr. bounderby moved, moved with him, kept
close to him, and went away with him.  the only parting salutation of
which he delivered himself was a sulky â€˜good night, father!â€™  with a
brief speech, and a scowl at his sister, he left the house.

since his sheet-anchor had come home, mr. gradgrind had been sparing of
speech.  he still sat silent, when louisa mildly said:

â€˜rachael, you will not distrust me one day, when you know me better.â€™

â€˜it goes against me,â€™ rachael answered, in a gentler manner, â€˜to mistrust
any one; but when i am so mistrustedâ€”when we all areâ€”i cannot keep such
things quite out of my mind.  i ask your pardon for having done you an
injury.  i donâ€™t think what i said now.  yet i might come to think it
again, wiâ€™ the poor lad so wronged.â€™

â€˜did you tell him in your letter,â€™ inquired sissy, â€˜that suspicion seemed

night?  he would then know what he would have to explain on coming back,
and would be ready.â€™

â€˜yes, dear,â€™ she returned; â€˜but i canâ€™t guess what can have ever taken
him there.  he never used to go there.  it was never in his way.  his way
was the same as mine, and not near it.â€™

sissy had already been at her side asking her where she lived, and
whether she might come to-morrow night, to inquire if there were news of
him.

â€˜i doubt,â€™ said rachael, â€˜if he can be here till next day.â€™

â€˜then i will come next night too,â€™ said sissy.

when rachael, assenting to this, was gone, mr. gradgrind lifted up his
head, and said to his daughter:

â€˜louisa, my dear, i have never, that i know of, seen this man.  do you
believe him to be implicated?â€™

â€˜i think i have believed it, father, though with great difficulty.  i do
not believe it now.â€™

â€˜that is to say, you once persuaded yourself to believe it, from knowing
him to be suspected.

he told it in a whisper.  next night again, when she came home
with the same account, and added that he had not been heard of, she spoke
in the same low frightened tone.  from the moment of that interchange of
looks, they never uttered his name, or any reference to him, aloud; nor
ever pursued the subject of the robbery, when mr. gradgrind spoke of it.

the two appointed days ran out, three days and nights ran out, and
stephen blackpool was not come, and remained unheard of.  on the fourth
day, rachael, with unabated confidence, but considering her despatch to
have miscarried, went up to the bank, and showed her letter from him with
his address, at a working colony, one of many, not upon the main road,
sixty miles away.  messengers were sent to that place, and the whole town
looked for stephen to be brought in next day.

during this whole time the whelp moved about with mr. bounderby like his
shadow, assisting in all the proceedings.  he was greatly excited,
horribly fevered, bit his nails do

rattling voice, and with lips that were black and burnt up.  at the hour
when the suspected man was looked for, the whelp was at the station;
offering to wager that he had made off before the arrival of those who
were sent in quest of him, and that he would not appear.

the whelp was right.  the messengers returned alone.  rachaelâ€™s letter
had gone, rachaelâ€™s letter had been delivered.  stephen blackpool had
decamped in that same hour; and no soul knew more of him.  the only doubt
in coketown was, whether rachael had written in good faith, believing
that he really would come back, or warning him to fly.  on this point
opinion was divided.

six days, seven days, far on into another week.  the wretched whelp
plucked up a ghastly courage, and began to grow defiant.  â€˜_was_ the
suspected fellow the thief?  a pretty question!  if not, where was the

day and night again, day and night again.  no stephen blackpool.  where
was the man, and why did he not come back?

every night, sissy went to rachaelâ€™s lodging, and sat with her in her
small neat room.  all day, rachael toiled as such people must toil,
whatever their anxieties.  the smoke-serpents were indifferent who was
lost or found, who turned out bad or good; the melancholy mad elephants,
like the hard fact men, abated nothing of their set routine, whatever
happened.  day and night again, day and night again.  the monotony was
unbroken.  even stephen blackpoolâ€™s disappearance was falling into the
general way, and becoming as monotonous a wonder as any piece of
machinery in coketown.

â€˜i misdoubt,â€™ s

aid rachael, â€˜if there is as many as twenty left in all

she said it to sissy, as they sat in her lodging, lighted only by the
lamp at the street corner.  sissy had come there when it was already
dark, to await her return from work; and they had since sat at the window
where rachael had found her, wanting no brighter light to shine on their
sorrowful talk.

â€˜if it hadnâ€™t been mercifully brought about, that i was to have you to
speak to,â€™ pursued rachael, â€˜times are, when i think my mind would not
have kept right.  but i get hope and strength through you; and you
believe that though appearances may rise against him, he will be proved
clear?â€™

â€˜i do believe so,â€™ returned sissy, â€˜with my whole heart.  i feel so
certain, rachael, that the confidence you hold in

ore doubt of him
than if i had known him through as many years of trial as you have.â€™

â€˜and i, my dear,â€™ said rachel, with a tremble in her voice, â€˜have known
him through them all, to be, according to his quiet ways, so faithful to
everything honest and good, that if he was never to be heard of more, and
i was to live to be a hundred years old, i could say with my last breath,
god knows my heart.  i have never once left trusting stephen blackpool!â€™

â€˜we all believe, up at the lodge, rachael, that he will be freed from
suspicion, sooner or later.â€™

â€˜the better i know it to be so believed there, my dear,â€™ said rachael,
â€˜and the kinder i feel it that you come away from there, purposely to
comfort me, and keep me company, and be seen wiâ€™ me when i am not yet
free from all suspicion myself, the more grieved i am that i should ever
have spoken those mistrusting words to the young lady.  and yet iâ€”â€™

â€˜you donâ€™t mistrust her now, rachael?â€™

â€˜now that you have brought

mistrust that some one has put stephen out of the way.  i mistrust that
by his coming back of his own accord, and showing himself innocent before
them all, some one would be confounded, whoâ€”to prevent thatâ€”has stopped
him, and put him out of the way.â€™

â€˜that is a dreadful thought,â€™ said sissy, turning pale.

â€˜it _is_ a dreadful thought to think he may be murdered.â€™

sissy shuddered, and turned paler yet.

â€˜when it makes its way into my mind, dear,â€™ said rachael, â€˜and it will
come sometimes, though i do all i can to keep it out, wiâ€™ counting on to
high numbers as i work, and saying over and over again pieces that i knew
when i were a childâ€”i fall into such a wild, hot hurry, that, however
tired i am, i want to walk fast, miles and miles.  i must get the better
of this before bed-time.  iâ€™ll walk home wiâ€™ you.â€™

â€˜he might fall ill upon the journey back,â€™ said sissy, faintly offering a
worn-out scrap of hope; â€˜and in such a case, there 
 
 ___________________________
 
are many places on the
road where he might stop.â€™

â€˜but he is in none of them.  he has been sought for in all, and heâ€™s not
there.â€™

â€˜true,â€™ was sissyâ€™s reluctant admission.

â€˜heâ€™d walk the journey in two days.  if he was footsore and couldnâ€™t
walk, i sent him, in the letter he got, the money to ride, lest he should
have none of his own to spare.â€™

â€˜let us hope that to-morrow will bring something better, rachael.  come
into the air!â€™

her gentle hand adjusted rachaelâ€™s shawl upon her shining black hair in
the usual manner of her wearing it, and they went out.  the night being
fine, little knots of hands were here and there lingering at street
corners; but it was supper-time with the greater part of them, and there
were but few people in the streets.

â€˜youâ€™re not so hurried now, rachael, and your hand is cooler.â€™

â€˜i get better, dear, if i can only walk, and breathe a little fresh.
â€˜times when i canâ€™t, i turn weak and confused.â€™

â€˜but you m

to-morrow, let us walk in the country on sunday morning, and strengthen
you for another week.  will you go?â€™

â€˜yes, dear.â€™

they were by this time in the street where mr. bounderbyâ€™s house stood.
the way to sissyâ€™s destination led them past the door, and they were
going straight towards it.  some train had newly arrived in coketown,
which had put a number of vehicles in motion, and scatte

dwelling-house and see the matter out.  but when the phenomenon was
enhanced by the notoriety and mystery by this time associated all over
the town with the bank robbery, it would have lured the stragglers in,
with an irresistible attraction, though the roof had been expected to
fall upon their heads.  accordingly, the chance witnesses on the ground,
consisting of the busiest of the neighbours to the number of some
five-and-twenty, closed in after sissy and rachael, as they closed in
after mrs. sparsit and her prize; and the whole body made a disorderly
irruption into mr. bounderbyâ€™s dining-room, where the people behind lost
not a momentâ€™s time in mounting on the chairs, to get the better of the
people in front.

â€˜fetch mr. bounderby down!â€™ cried mrs. sparsit.  â€˜rachael, young woman;
you know who this is?â€™

â€˜itâ€™s mrs. pegler,â€™ said rachael.

â€˜why, whatâ€™s the matter now!â€™ said he.  â€˜mrs. sparsit, maâ€™am?â€™

â€˜sir,â€™ explained that worthy woman, â€˜i trust it is my good fortune to
produce a person you have much desired to find.  stimulated by my wish to
relieve your mind, sir, and connecting together such imperfect clues to
the part of the country in which that person might be supposed to reside,
as have been afforded by the young woman, rachael, fortunately now
present to identify, i have had the happiness to succeed, and to bring
that person with meâ€”i need not say most unwillingly on her part.  it has
not been, sir, without some trouble that i have effected this; but
trouble in your service is to me a pleasure, and hunger, thirst, and cold
a real gratification.â€™

here mrs. sparsit ceased; for mr. bounderbyâ€™s visage exhibited an
extraordinary combination of all possible colours and expressions of
discomfiture, as old mrs. pegler

k himself on to
a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.  with the people filing off
at the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole
town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a bully
more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  even that
unlucky female, mrs. sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into
the slough of despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man
and self-made humbug, josiah bounderby of coketown.

rachael and sissy, leaving mrs. pegler to occupy a bed at her sonâ€™s for
that night, walked together to the gate of stone lodge and there parted.
mr. gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with
much interest of stephen blackpool; for whom he thought this signal
failure of the suspicions against mrs. pegler was likely to work well.

as to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he
had stuck close to bounderby.  he seemed to feel that as long as
bounderby

ery without his knowledge, he was so far
safe.  he never visited his sister, and had only seen her once since she
went home: that is to say on the night when he still stuck close to
bounderby, as already related.

there was one dim unformed fear lingering about his sisterâ€™s mind, to
which she never gave utterance, which surrounded the graceless and
ungrateful boy with a dreadful mystery.  the same dark possibility had
presented itself in the same shapeless guise, this very day, to sissy,
when rachael spoke of some one who would be confounded by stephenâ€™s
return, having put him out of the way.  louisa had never spoken of
harbouring any suspicion of her brother in connexion with the robbery,
she and sissy had held no confidence on the subject, save in that one
interchange of looks when the unconscious father rested his gray head on
his hand; but it was understood between them, and they both knew it.
this other fear was so awful, that it hovered about each of them like a
ghostly shadow; neit

and still the forced spirit which the whelp had plucked up, throve with
him.  if stephen blackpool was not the thief, let him show himself.  why
didnâ€™t he?

another night.  another day and night.  no stephen blackpool.  where was
the man, and why did he not come back?



chapter vi
the starlight


the sunday was a bright sunday in autumn, clear and cool, when early in
the morning sissy and rachael met, to walk in the country.

as coketown cast ashes not only on its own head but on the
neighbourhoodâ€™s tooâ€”after the manner of those pious persons who do
penance for their own sins by putting other people into sackclothâ€”it was
customary for those who now and then thirsted for a draught of pure air,
which is not absolutely the most wicked among the vanities of life, to
get a few miles away by the railroad, and then begin their walk, or their
lounge in the fields.  sissy and rachael helpe

s, marking the site of deserted works.  they followed paths and
tracks, however slight.  mounds where the grass was rank and high, and
where brambles, dock-weed, and such-like vegetation, were confusedly
heaped together, they always avoided; for dismal stories were told in
that country of the old pits hidden beneath such indications.

the sun was high when they sat down to rest.  they had seen no one, near
or distant, for a long time; and the solitude remained unbroken.  â€˜it is
so still here, rachael, and the way is so untrodden, that i think we must
be the first who have been here all the summer.â€™

as sissy said it, her eyes were attracted by another of those rotten
fragments of fence upon the ground.  she got up to look at it.  â€˜and yet
i donâ€™t know.  this has not been broken very long.  the wood is quite
fresh where it gave way.  here are footsteps too.â€”o rachael!â€™

she ran back, and caught her round the neck.  rachael had already started
up.

â€˜what is the matter?â€™

â€˜i do

nâ€™t know.  there is a hat lying in the grass.â€™  they went forward
together.  rachael took it up, shaking from head to foot.  she broke into
a passion of tears and lamentations: stephen blackpool was written in his
own hand on the inside.

â€˜o the poor lad, the poor lad!  he has been made away with.  he is lying
murdered here!â€™

â€˜is thereâ€”has the hat any blood upon it?â€™ sissy faltered.

they were afraid to look; but they did examine it, and found no mark of
violence, inside or out.  it had been lying there some days, for rain and
dew had stained it, and the mark of its

shape was on the grass where it
had fallen.  they looked fearfully about them, without moving, but could
see nothing more.  â€˜rachael,â€™ sissy whispered, â€˜i will go on a little by
myself.â€™

she had unclasped her hand, and was in the act of stepping forward, when
rachael caught her in both arms with a scream that resounded over the
wide landscape.  before them, at their very feet, was the brink of a
black ragged chasm hidden by the thick grass.  they sprang back, and fell
upon their knees, each hiding her face upon the otherâ€™s neck.

â€˜o, my good lord!  heâ€™s down there!  down there!â€™  at first this, and her
terrific screams, were all that could be got from rachael, by any tears,
by any prayers, by any representations, by any means.  it was impossible
to 
 
 ___________________________
 
hush her; and it was deadly necessary to hold her, or she would have
flung herself down the shaft.

â€˜rachael, dear rachael, good rachael, for the love of heaven, not these
dreadful cries!  think of stephen, think of stephen, think of stephen!â€™

by an earnest repetition of this entreaty, poured out in all the agony of
such a moment, sissy at last brought her to be silent, and to look at her
with a tearless face of stone.

â€˜rachael, stephen may be living.  you wouldnâ€™t leave him lying maimed at
the bottom of this dreadful place, a moment, if you could bring help to
him?â€™

â€˜no, no, no!â€™

â€˜donâ€™t stir from here, for his sake!  let me go and listen.â€™

she shuddered to approach the pit; but she crept towards it on her hands
and knees, and called to him as loud as she could call.  she listened,
but no sound replied.  she called again and listened; still no answering
sound.  she did this, twenty, thirty times.  she

 took a little clod of
earth from the broken ground where he had stumbled, and threw it in.  she
could not hear it fall.

the wide prospect, so beautiful in its stillness but a few minutes ago,
almost carried despair to her brave heart, as she rose and looked all
round her, seeing no help.  â€˜rachael, we must lose not a moment.  we must
go in different directions, seeking aid.  you shall go by the way we have
come, and i will go forward by the path.  tell any one you see, and every
one what has happened.  think of stephen, think of stephen!â€™

she knew by rachaelâ€™s face that she might trust her now.  and after
standing for a moment to see her running, wringing her hands as she ran,
she turned and went upon her own search; she stopped at the hedge to tie
her shawl there as a guide to the

mplements they wanted should come up.

every sound of insects in the air, every stirring of the leaves, every
whisper among these men, made sissy tremble, for she thought it was a cry
at the bottom of the pit.  but the wind blew idly over it, and no sound
arose to the surface, and they sat upon the grass, waiting and waiting.
after they had waited some time, straggling people who had heard of the
accident began to come up; then the real help of implements began to
arrive.  in the midst of this, rachael returned; and with her party there
was a surgeon, who brought some wine and medicines.  but, the expectation
among the people that the man would be found alive was very slight
indeed.

there being now people enough present to impede the work, the sobered man
put himself at the head of the rest, or was put there by the general
consent, and made a large ring round the old hell shaft, and appointed
men to keep it.  besides such volunteers as were accepted to work, only
sissy and rachael were at fi

rst permitted within this ring; but, later in
the day, when the message brought an express from coketown, mr. gradgrind
and louisa, and mr. bounderby, and the whelp, were also there.

the sun was four hours lower than when sissy and rachael had first sat
down upon the grass, before a means of enabling two men to descend
securely was rigged with poles and ropes.  difficulties had arisen in the
construction of this machine, simple as it was; requisites had been found
wanting, and messages had had to go and return.  it was five oâ€™clock in
the afternoon of the bright autumnal sunday, before a candle was sent
down to try the air, while three or four rough faces stood crowded close
together, attentively watching it: the man at the win

the figure of a poor, crushed, human creature.

a low murmur of pity went round the throng, and the women wept aloud, as
this form, almost without form, was moved very slowly from its iron
deliverance, and laid upon the bed of straw.  at first, none but the
surgeon went close to it.  he did what he could in its adjustment on the
couch, but the best that he could do was to cover it.  that gently done,
he called to him rachael and sissy.  and at that time the pale, worn,
patient face was seen looking up at the sky, with the broken right hand
lying bare on the outside of the covering garments, as if waiting to be
taken by another hand.

they gave him drink, moistened his face with water, and administered some
drops of cordial and wine.  though he lay quite motionless looking up at
the sky, he smiled and said, â€˜rachael.â€™  she stooped down on the grass at
his side, and bent over him until her eyes were between his a

nd the sky,
for he could not so much as turn them to look at her.

â€˜rachael, my dear.â€™

she took his hand.  he smiled again and said, â€˜donâ€™t let â€™t go.â€™

â€˜thouâ€™rt in great pain, my own dear stephen?â€™

â€˜i haâ€™ been, but not now.  i haâ€™ beenâ€”dreadful, and dree, and long, my
dearâ€”but â€™tis ower now.  ah, rachael, aw a muddle!  froâ€™ first to last, a
muddle!â€™

the spectre of his old look seemed to pass as he said the word.

â€˜i haâ€™ fell into thâ€™ pit, my dear, as have cost wiâ€™in the knowledge oâ€™
old fok now livin, hundreds and hundreds oâ€™ menâ€™s livesâ€”fathers, sons,
brothers, dear to thousands anâ€™ thousands, anâ€™ keeping â€™em froâ€™ want and

when â€™tis let alone, it kills wiâ€™out need.  see how we die anâ€™ no need,
one way anâ€™ anotherâ€”in a muddleâ€”every day!â€™

he faintly said it, without any anger against any one.  merely as the
truth.

â€˜thy little sister, rachael, thou hast not forgot her.  thouâ€™rt not like
to forget her now, and me so nigh her.  thou knowâ€™stâ€”poor, patient,
suffâ€™rin, dearâ€”how thou didst work for her, seetâ€™n all day long in her
little chair at thy winder, and how she died, young and misshapen, awlung
oâ€™ sickly air as hadâ€™n no need to be, anâ€™ awlung oâ€™ working peopleâ€™s
miserable homes.  a muddle!  aw a muddle!â€™

louisa approached him; but he could not see her, lying with his face
turned up to the night sky.

â€˜if

ever knowâ€™d me at awâ€”he wouldâ€™n haâ€™ tookâ€™n offence wiâ€™ me.  he wouldâ€™n
haâ€™ suspectâ€™n me.  but look up yonder, rachael!  look aboove!â€™

following his eyes, she saw that he was gazing at a star.

      [picture: stephen blackpool recovered from the old hell shaft]

â€˜it haâ€™ shined upon me,â€™ he said reverently, â€˜in my pain and trouble down

dyin prayer that aw thâ€™ world may onâ€™y coom toogether more, anâ€™ get a
better unnerstanâ€™in oâ€™ one another, than when i were in â€™t my own weak
seln.â€™

louisa hearing what he said, bent over him on the opposite side to
rachael, so that he could see her.

â€˜you haâ€™ heard?â€™ he said, after a few momentsâ€™ silence.  â€˜i haâ€™ not
forgot you, ledy.â€™

â€˜yes, stephen, i have heard you.  and your prayer is mine.â€™

â€˜you haâ€™ a father.  will yo takâ€™ a message to him?â€™

â€˜he is here,â€™ said louisa, with dread.  â€˜shall i bring him to you?â€™

â€˜if yo please.â€™

louisa returned with her father.  standing hand-in-hand, they both looked
down upon the solemn countenance.

â€˜sir, yo will clear me anâ€™ mak m

trust to yo to do â€™t.â€™

the bearers being now ready to carry him away, and the surgeon being
anxious for his removal, those who had torches or lanterns, prepared to
go in front of the litter.  before it was raised, and while they were
arranging how to go, he said to rachael, looking upward at the star:

â€˜often as i coom to myseln, and found it shininâ€™ on me down there in my
trouble, i thowt it were the star as guided to our saviourâ€™s home.  i
awmust think it be the very star!â€™

they lifted him up, and he was overjoyed to find that they were about to
take him in the direction whither the star seemed to him to lead.

â€˜rachael, beloved lass!  donâ€™t let go my hand.  we may walk toogether
tâ€™night, my dear!â€™

â€˜i will hold thy hand, and keep beside thee

, stephen, all the way.â€™

â€˜bless thee!  will soombody be pleased to coover my face!â€™

they carried him very gently along the fields, and down the lanes, and
over the wide landscape; rachael always holding the hand in hers.  very
few whispers broke the mournful silence.  it was soon a funeral
procession.  the star had shown him where to find the god of the poor;
and through humility, and sorrow, and forgiveness, he had gone to his
redeemerâ€™s rest.

had disappeared from within it.  mr. bounderby and his shadow had not

â€˜sissy has effected it, father.â€™

he raised his eyes to where she stood, like a good fairy in his house,
and said in a tone of softened gratitude and grateful kindness, â€˜it is
always you, my child!â€™

â€˜we had our fears,â€™ sissy explained, glancing at louisa, â€˜before

night, and heard what passed (being close to rachael all the time), i
went to him when no one saw, and said to him, â€œdonâ€™t look at me.  see

was in a tremble before i whispered to him, and he started and trembled

er fatherâ€™s name, exonerating the late stephen blackpool,
weaver, from misplaced suspicion, and publishing the guilt of his own
son, with such extenuation as his years and temptation (he could not
bring himself to add, his education) might beseech; were of the present.
so, stephen blackpoolâ€™s tombstone, with her fatherâ€™s record of his death,
was almost of the present, for she knew it was to be.  these things she
could plainly see.  but, how much of the future?

a working woman, christened rachael, after a long illness once again
appearing at the ringing of the factory bell, and passing to and fro at
the set hours, among the coketown hands; a woman of pensive beauty,
always dressed in black, but sweet-tempered and serene, and even
cheerful; who, of all the people in the place, alone appeared to have
compassion on a degraded, drunken wretch of her own sex, who was
sometimes seen in the town secretly begging of her, and crying to her; a
woman working, ever working, but content to do it, an
