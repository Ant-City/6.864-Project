climbed a thousand times to that
tall hill they call the spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most
wonderful and changing prospects. sometimes the isle was thick with
savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that
hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and
tragic as our actual adventures.

so the weeks passed on, till one fine day there came a letter addressed
to dr. livesey, with this addition, "to be opened, in the case of his
absence, by tom redruth or young hawkins." obeying this order, we
found, or rather i found--for the gamekeeper was a poor hand at reading
anything but print--the following important news:

     old anchor inn, bristol, march 1, 17--

     dear livesey--as i do not know whether you
     are at the hall or still in london, i send this in
     double to both places.

     the ship is bought and fitted.  she lies at
     anchor, ready for sea.  you never imagined a
     sweeter schooner--a child might sail her--two

which has never been
     overdrawn.  he leaves his wife to manage the inn;
     and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old
     bachelors like you and i may be excused for
     guessing that it is the wife, quite as much as the
     health, that sends him back to roving.
     j. t.

     p.p.s.--hawkins may stay one night with his
     mother.

you can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. i was half
beside myself with glee; and if ever i despised a man, it was old
tom redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. any of the
under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such
was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law
among them all. nobody but old redruth would have dared so much as even
to grumble.

the next morning he and i set out on foot for the admiral benbow, and
there i found my mother in good health and spirits. the captain, who had
so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked

 joyce from the block house, had time to
fire. the four shots came in rather a scattering volley, but they did
the business: one of the enemy actually fell, and the rest, without
hesitation, turned and plunged into the trees.

after reloading, we walked down the outside of the palisade to see to
the fallen enemy. he was stone dead--shot through the heart.

we began to rejoice over our good success when just at that moment a
pistol cracked in the bush, a ball whistled close past my ear, and poor
tom redruth stumbled and fell his length on the ground. both the squire
and i returned the shot, but as we had nothing to aim at, it is probable
we only wasted powder. then we reloaded and turned our attention to poor
tom.

the captain and gray were already examining him, and i saw with half an
eye that all was over.

i believe the readiness of our return volley had scattered the mutineers
once more, for we were suffered without further molestation to get the
poor old gamekeeper hoisted over the stockade a

re was sand in our eyes, sand in our teeth, sand in our
suppers, sand dancing in the spring at the bottom of the kettle, for all
the world like porridge beginning to boil. our chimney was a square hole
in the roof; it was but a little part of the smoke that found its way
out, and the rest eddied about the house and kept us coughing and piping
the eye.

add to this that gray, the new man, had his face tied up in a bandage
for a cut he had got in breaking away from the mutineers and that poor
old tom redruth, still unburied, lay along the wall, stiff and stark,
under the union jack.

if we had been allowed to sit idle, we should all have fallen in the
blues, but captain smollett was never the man for that. all hands were
called up before him, and he divided us into watches. the doctor and
gray and i for one; the squire, hunter, and joyce upon the other. tired
though we all were, two were sent out for firewood; two more were set to
dig a grave for redruth; the doctor was named cook; i was put sentry
