[CHARACTER] - 
                 [CHARACTER]
is the daughter of a german baron who acts as candide's benefactor
until he discovers candide's love for his daughter. throughout much
of the novel, [CHARACTER] is young and beautiful. after her father's
castle is destroyed in war, a number of exploitative men enslave
her or use her as a mistress. [CHARACTER] returns candide's love but
is willing to betray him for the sake of her own interests. like
him, she is neither intelligent nor complex. her very blandness
casts a satiric light on candide's mad romantic passion for her.
