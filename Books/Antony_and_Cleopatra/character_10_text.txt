enobarbus.
not if the small come first.

your speech is passion:
but, pray you, stir no embers up. here comes
the noble antony.

lepidus.
noble friends,
that which combin'd us was most great, and let not
a leaner action rend us. what's amiss,
may it be gently heard: when we debate
our trivial difference loud, we do commit
murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,--
the rather for i earnestly beseech,--
touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
nor curstness grow to the matter.

antony.
thou art a soldier only: speak no more.

enobarbus.
that truth should be silent i had almost forgot.

antony.
you wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.

enobarbus.
go to, then; your considerate stone!

caesar.
i do not much dislike the matter, but
the manner of his speech; for't cannot be
we shall remain in friendship, our conditions
so differing in their acts. yet if i knew
what hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge

caesar.

agrippa.
thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
admir'd octavia: great mark antony
is now a widower.

caesar.

if cleopatra heard you, your reproof
were well deserv'd of rashness.

agrippa further speak.

and all great fears, which now import their dangers,
would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
where now half tales be truths: her love to both
would each to other, and all loves to both,
draw after her. pardon what i have spoke;
for 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
by duty ruminated.

there is my hand.

when she first met mark antony she pursed up his heart, upon the
river of cydnus.

agrippa.
there she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised well for her.

enobarbus.
i will tell you.
the barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
purple the sails, and so perfumed that
the winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
the water which they beat to follow faster,
as amorous of their strokes. for her own person,
it beggar'd all description: she did lie
in her pavilion,-

the fancy out-work nature: on each side her
stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling cupids,
with divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
to glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
and what they undid did.

agrippa.
o, rare for antony!

enobarbus.
her gentlewomen, like the nereids,
so many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
and made their bends adornings: at the helm
a seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands
that yarely frame the office. from the barge
a strange invisible perfume hits the sense
of the adjacent wharfs. the city cast
her people out upon her; and antony,
enthron'd i' the market-place, did sit alone,
whistling to the air; which,

invited her to supper: she replied
it should be better he became her guest;
which she entreated: our courteous antony,

and, for his ordinary, pays his heart

the other three are sealing. octavia weeps
to part from rome: caesar is sad; and lepidus,
since pompey's feast, as menas says, is troubled
with the green sickness.

'tis a noble lepidus.

nay, but how dearly he adores mark antony!

would you praise caesar, say 'caesar'--go no further.

agrippa.
indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.

contemning rome, he has done all this, and more,
in alexandria. here's the manner of't:--
i' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
were publicly enthron'd: at the feet sat
caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
and all the unlawful issue that their lust

that lepidus of the triumvirate
