   'no,' my father said. 'this is margaret's house.'

   the front door of the house opened, and margaret, the lady with the wild
red hair, stood there. i looked up and down the street. the buildings were all
jammed together like a row of birdhouses in front of each one was a tiny
square of grass, and in front of that was a long, long cement sidewalk
running alongside the cement road.

   'where's the barn?' i asked. 'where's the river? where's the swimming
hole?'

   'oh, sal,' my father said. 'come along. there's margaret.' he waved to the
lady at the door.

   'we have to go back.' i said 'i forgot something.

   the lady with the wild red hair opened the door and came out on the
porch.


   'in the back of my closet.' i said, 'under the floorboards. i put something
there, and i've got to have it.

   'don't be a goose,' he said. 'come and see margaret.

   i did not want to see margaret. i stood there, looking around, and that's

minutes solid. i prayed that we would not be in an accident (i was terrified
of cars and buses) and that we would get there by my mother's birthday -
seven days away - and that we would bring her home. over and over, i
prayed the same thing. i prayed to trees this was easier than praying directly
to god. there was nearly always a tree nearby.

   as we-pulled onto the ohio turnpike, which is the flattest, straightest
piece of road in god's whole creation, gram interrupted my prayers
'salamanca--'

   i should explain right off that my real name is salamanca tree hiddle.
salamanca, my parents thought, was the name of the indian tribe to which
my great-great grandmother belonged. my parents were mistaken. the name
of the tribe was seneca, but since my parents did not discover their error
until after i was born and they were, by then, used to my name, it remained
salamanca.

   my middle name, tree, comes from your basic tree. a thing of such beauty
to my mother that she made it p

art of my name. she wanted to be more
specific and use sugar maple tree, her very favorite because sugar maple is
part of her own name, but salamanca sugar maple tree hiddle sounded a
bit much.


   my mother used to call me salamanca, but after she left, only my
grandparents hiddle called me salamanca (when they were not calling me
chickabiddy). to most other people, i was sal, and to a few boys who
thought they were especially amusing, i was salamander.

   in the car, as we started our long journey to lewiston, idaho, my
grandmother hiddle said, 'salamanca, why don't you entertain us?'

   'what sort of thing did you have in mind?' i hoped they would not expect
me to do something thumpingly embarrassing, like climb on top of the car
and sing a little ditty. you can never tell with my grandparents.

   but gramps said, 'how about a story? spin us a yam.'

   i certainly do know heaps of stories, but i learned most of them from

around this pleasant round face, her hair curled in short ringlets as yellow as
a crow's foot.

   during that first week, when my father and i were at margaret's (we ate
dinner there three times the first week), i saw phoebe's face twice more at
her window in the house next door. once i waved at phoebe, but she didn't
seem to notice, and at school she never mentioned that she had seen me.


   then, one day, at lunch, she slid into the seat next to me and said. 'sal,
you're ever so courageous. you're ever so brave.'

   to tell you the truth, i was surprised.  you could have knocked me over
with a chicken feather. 'me? i'm not brave,' i said.

   'you are. you're ever so brave.'

   i was not. i, salamanca tree hiddle, was afraid of lots and lots of things.
for example, i was terrified of car accidents, death, cancer, brain tumors
nuclear war, pregnant women, loud noises, strict teachers, elevators, and
scads of other things but i was not afraid of spiders

ese creatures.

   on the first day of class, when a dignified black spider was investigating
my desk, i cupped my hands around it, carried it to the open window, and set
it outside on the ledge. mary lou finney said, 'alpha and omega, will you
look at that!' beth am. was as white as milk. all around the room, people
were acting as if i had single-handedly taken on a fire-breathing dragon.

   during that next week, if an innocent spider was crawling toward
someone's desk, they would all yell, 'sal, get it!' when a wasp flew in the
window for a peek around the room, they said, 'sal, it's a wasp, get it!' and
once, a tiny green garden snake slithered along the baseboard and everyone
screamed, "sal, a snake, oh, sal, get it!'

   as i was trying my best to assist these various creatures in finding their
way out of our classroom and back into the wide open spaces, people would
say, 'sal, kill it, kill it!' i wondered how they would like it if someone
smooshed them just because they happened

at just because i was not afraid of these little creatures, people
thought i was brave. i suppose they didn't know how i felt about cars,
cancer, nuclear war and all those other things. what i have since realized is
that if people expect you to be brave, sometimes you pretend that you are,
even when you are frightened down to your very bones. but this was later,
during the whole thing with phoebe's lunatic, that i realized this.


   at this point in my story, gram interrupted me to say, 'why, salamanca, of
course you're brave. all the hiddles are brave. it's a family trait. look at
your daddy - your momma-'

   'my momma is not a real hiddle,' i said.

   'she practically is,' gram said. 'you can't be married to a hiddle that long
and not become a hiddle.' that is not what my mother used to say. she
would tell my father, 'you hiddles are a mystery to me. i'll never be a true
hiddle.' she did not say this proudly. she said it as if she were thumpingly
sorry about it, as if it was some so

phoebe and i walked home from school together. we stopped briefly at my
house so that i could call my father at work. margaret had helped him find a
job selling farm machinery. when i phoned him that day, he said it made
him happy as a clam at high water to know i had a new friend. maybe this is
really why he was happy, i thought, or maybe it was because he could be
alone with margaret cadaver.

   phoebe and i then walked to her house. as we passed margaret cadaver's
house, a voice called out 'sal? sal? is that you'!'

   phoebe put her hand up to her mouth and said. 'oh!'

   in the shadows on the porch. margaret's mother. mrs. partridge, sat in a
wicker rocker. a thick, gnarled cane with a handle carved in the shape of a
cobra's head lay across her knees her purple dress had slipped up over her
bony knees, which were spread apart, and, i hate to say it, you could see
right up her skirt. around her neck was a yellow feather scarf ('my boa' she
once told me, 'my most favouritest boa').

   as i started up the walk, phoebe pulled on my arm. 'don't go up there,' she
said.

   'it's only mrs. partridge,' i said. 'come on.'


   'who's that with you?' mrs. partridge said. 'what's that on her face?' i
knew what she was going to do. she did this with me the first time i met her.

   phoebe placed her hands on her own round face and felt about. 'is it beans?
is it the beans from that red bean salad i had at lunch?'

   'come here,' mrs. partridge said. she wriggled her crooked little fingers at
phoebe.

   phoebe looked at me, and i pushed her a little closer. mrs. partridge put
her fingers up to phoebe's face and mashed around gently over her eyelids
and down her cheeks. then she said, 'just as i thought. it's two eyes, a nose
and a mouth.' then she laughed a wicked laugh that sounded as if it was
bouncing off jagged rocks. 'you're thirteen years old.'

   'yes' phoebe said.

"oh!" and "amazing!" and "how does he do that?" what he was doing was
guessing people's ages he had to guess your correct age within one year or
else you won a teddy bear.

   'how did he do it?' i asked.

   'that's what i'm telling you,' phoebe said. 'the thin man would look
someone over carefully, close his eyes, and then he would point his finger at
the person and shout, "seventy-two!" '

   'at everyone? he guessed everyone to be seventy- two?'

   'sal,' she said. 'that's what i am trying to tell you. i was just giving an
example. he might have said, "ten" or "thirty" or "seventy-two". it just
depended on the person. he was astounding.

   i really thought it was more astounding that mrs. partridge could do this,
but i didn't say anything.

   phoebe said that her father wanted the thin man to guess his age. 'my
father thinks he looks very young for his age, and he was certain he could
fool the man. after studying my father closely, the thin

   'oh, no. not to blackberries.' the truth is, i do not have allergies, but i
could not admit that the sight of blackberries reminded me of my mother.

   mrs. winterbottom made me and phoebe sit down at the kitchen table and
tell her about our day. she brought out a plate of homemade cookies. phoebe
told her about mrs. partridge guessing her age.

   'she's really remarkable,' i said.

   phoebe said, 'it's not that remarkable, sal. i wouldn't exactly use the word
"remarkable".

   'but, phoebe,' i said, 'mrs. partridge is blind.'

   both phoebe and her mother said, 'blind?'

   later, phoebe said to me, 'don't you think it's odd' that mrs. partridge,
who is blind, could see something about me - but i, who can see, was blind
about her? and speaking of odd, there's something very odd about that mrs.
cadaver.


   'margaret?' i said.

   'is that her name?   margaret cadaver?   mrs. margaret cadaver?'

   'yes'

   'why?'

   'that's what i'm telling you,' she said. 'first, there is that name: cadaver.
you know what cadaver means?'

   actually, i did not.

   'it means dead body.'

   'are you sure?' i said.

   'of course i am sure, sal. you can check the dictionary if you want. do
you know what she does for a living - what her job is?'

   'yes.` i was pleased to say. i was pleased to know something. 'she's a
nurse.

   'exactly.' phoebe said. 'would you want a nurse whose name meant dead
body? and that hair. don't you think all that sticking-out red hair is spooky?
and that voice. it reminds me of dead leaves all blowing around on the
ground.'

   this was phoebe's power. in her world, no one was ordinary. people were

   'yes' she said.

   gramps pulled out his wallet. 'if you need some cash--'

you for - for' - she looked around at all the pieces of her car - 'for everything.
i'm sure you have to be on your way.

   and, once gramps was satisfied that the mechanic was an honest man who
might actually be able to repair her car, we started on our trip again.

   'phoebe,' i said.' phoebe winterbottom.'

   'yes, that's right,' gram said. 'peeby.'

   'what was the diabolic thing that happened to mr. cadaver?' gramps
asked. 'you didn't tell us that yet.'

   i explained that just as phoebe was going to divulge the purely awful thing
that had happened to mr. cadaver, her father came home from work and we
all sat down to dinner: me, phoebe, mr. and mrs. winterbottom, and
phoebe's sister

 reminded me a lot of my other grandparents - the
pickfords like the pickfords, mr. and mrs. winterbottom spoke quietly, in
short sentences, and sat straight up as they ate their food. they were
extremely polite to each other, saying 'yes, norma,' and 'yes, george,' and
'would you please pass the potatoes, phoebe?' and 'wouldn't your guest like
another helping?'

   they were picky about their food, too. everything they ate was what my
father would call 'side dishes': potatoes, courgettes, bean salad, and a
mystery casserole that i could not identify. they didn't eat meat, and they
didn't use butter. they were very much concerned with cholesterol.

   from what i could gather, mr. winterbottom worked in an office, creating
road maps. mrs. winterbottom baked and cleaned and did laundry and
grocery shopping. i had a funny feeling that mrs. winterbottom did no
actually like all this barking and cleaning and laundry and shopping, and i'm

would find myself looking around for her, to see what i might want to feel.

   one day, about two weeks after she had left, i was standing against the
fence watching a new-born calf wobble on its thin legs. it tripped and
wobbled and swung its big head in my direction and gave me a sweet, loving
look. 'oh!' i thought. 'i am happy at this moment in time.' i was surprised
that i knew this all by myself, without my mother there. and that night in
bed, i did not cry. i said to myself, 'salamanca tree hiddle, you can be
happy without her.' it seemed a mean thought and i was sorry for it, but it
felt true.

   in the motel, as i was remembering these things. gram came and sat on the
edge of my bed. she said, 'do you miss your daddy? do you want to call
him?'

   i did miss him, and i did want to call him, but i said, 'no, i'm fine, really.'
he might think i was a goose if i had to call him already.

i was relieved that i had not had to submit one, since i was new at the school

it was a picture of two figures. one was a lizard-like creature with long
black hair that, as it ran down the lizard's back and under its bottom, became
a chair with legs. underneath this, ben had written.' salamander sitting on

on its legs and a short crew cut on its head. underneath this, ben had
written, 'free bee'.

   'very amusing,' phoebe said. she left the room, and mary lou followed
her.

   i turned around to hand the drawing back to ben, just as he leaned forward
and mashed his lips into my collarbone. his lips rested there a moment. my
nose was pressed into his hair, which smelled like grapefruit. it was his

 was a good reason for this. all along her trip, my
mother had sent me postcards she wrote, 'here i am in the badlands,
missing you terribly,' and-'this is mount rushmore, but i don't see any
presidents' faces, i only see yours.' the last postcard arrived two days after
we found out she wasn't coming back. it was from coeur d'alene, idaho. on
the front was a picture of a beautiful blue lake surrounded by tall evergreens.
on the back she had written, 'tomorrow i'll be in lewiston. i love you, my
salamanca tree.'

   'i sure hate to get back on the road,' gramps said, 'but time 's-a-wastin!'

   yes, i thought, yes, yes, yes!

   gram settled back for a nap while i said a few thousand more prayers. the
next thing i knew. gramps was pulling off the road again. 'lookee here.' he
said. 'the wisconsin dells.' he drove into a huge parking area and said,
'why don't you two go look around? i'm going to get a little shut-eye.

on the far side of the store was the
nervous young man who had come to phoebe's house. he was at the cash
register, paying for something, but he was staring at us while he was handing
his money to the clerk. i nudged phoebe.

   'oh, no,' she said, 'the lunatic.'

   she hustled over to ben and mary lou. 'look, quick,' phoebe said. 'it's the
lunatic.

   'where?'

   'at the cash register.'

   ''there's nobody there,' mary lou said.

   'honest, he was there,' phoebe said. 'i swear he was. ask sal.

   'he was there,' i said.

   all the way back to mary lou's house, we kept turning around and
glancing over our shoulders, but there was no sign of the lunatic. we stayed
at mary lou's for a little longer before we started back to phoebe's house.
we were only about a block away when we heard someone running up
behind us

   phoebe thought we were doomed. 'if we get our heads bashed in and he
leaves us here on the sidewalk--' she said.

   i felt a hand on my shoulder and i opened my mouth t

one did touch me. i wasn't always like that. before - before
everything went all wrong - we were a hugging family. as i walked along
with ben and phoebe, t saw a picture in my mind of my mother with her
arms around me. i saw another picture of myself when i was three years old.
my mother was carrying me on her back up to the barn. my arms were
wrapped around her neck and my face was tickled by her hair. her hair
smelled like roses. she licked the skin on my arm and said, 'um, you're a
delicious salamanca tree, a most delicious salamanca tree.'

   i saw another vision of myself when i was nine or ten. my mother crawled
into bed with me and snuggled close and said, 'let's build a raft and float
away down a river.' i used to think about that raft a lot, and i actually
believed that one day we might build a raft and float away down a river
together. but when she went to lewiston, idaho, she went alone.

   ben touched phoebe's arm. she flinched. 'ha,' he said. 'gotcha. you're

   when we reached phoebe's driveway. ben said, 'i guess you're safe now. i
guess i'll go.

   'go ahead.' phoebe said.

   we stood there. he stood there. mrs. cadaver came screeching up to the
kerb in her yellow volkswagen, with her wild red witch hair flying all over
the place. she waved at us and then started pulling things out of the car and
plopping them on the sidewalk.

   'who's that?' ben asked.

   'mrs. cadaver.'

   'cadaver? like dead body?'

   'that's right.'

   'hi, sal!' mrs. cadaver called. she was dumping a huge pile of lumpy bags
on the sidewalk. ben walked over and asked if she wanted any help carrying
things inside.

   'my, you're very polite,' mrs. cadaver said, flashing her wild gray eyes.

   'she scares me half to death,' phoebe said.

   phoebe's mother came to her front door. 'phoebe? what are you doing?
are you coming in? who is that?' she was pointing to ben.

   phoebe whispered to ben, 'don't go inside.

   'why not?' he said, rather too loudl

   mrs. cadaver said, 'sal, do you want to come in?'

   phoebe pulled on ben's sleeve. 'what's the matter', he asked.

   'is something the matter?' mrs. cadaver said in her crackly dead-leaf
voice.

   'phoebe!' her mother called. 'sweetie!'

   we left ben. just as we were going into phoebe's house, we turned around
and saw ben lift something off the sidewalk. it was a shiny, new axe.

her in my lap and pet her till she calms down, and sometimes i sing her a

   'i don't mean to,' she said. 'you've told me all i need to know. i figure if
you treat a dog that good, you'll treat me better. i figure if that old beagle
sadie loves you so much, i'll probably love you better. yes. i'll marry you.


   they were married three months later. during that time between his
proposal and their wedding day, gramps and his father and brothers' built a
small house in the clearing behind the first meadow.

   'we didn't have time,' gramps said, 'to completely finish it, and there
wasn't a single stick of furniture in it, but that didn't matter. we were going
to sleep there on our wedding night, all the same.'

   they were married in an aspen grove on a clear july day, and afterwards
they and all their friends and relatives had a wedding supper on the banks of

   i pulled my foot back inside. we closed the door and locked it. by the time
we returned to phoebe's bedroom window, mrs. cadaver and mr. birkway
had re-planted the bush.

   'maybe there is something hidden under the bush, phoebe said.

   'like what?'

   'like a dead body. maybe mr. birkway helped her chop up her husband
and bury him and maybe they were getting worried and decided to disguise
the spot with a rhododendron bush.'

   i must have looked skeptical. phoebe said, 'sal, you never can tell. and,
sal, i don't think you or your father should go over there any more.'

   i certainly agreed with her on that one. dad and i had been there two
nights earlier, and i had hardly been able to sit still. i started noticing all
these frightening things in margaret's house: creepy masks, old swords,
books with titles like murder on the rue morgue and the skull and the
hatchet. margaret cornered me in the kitchen and said, 'so, what has your
father told you about me?'

   'n

 asked her if
she was sick.

   mrs. winterbottom looked at phoebe and then straight at me. 'no,' she
said, 'i think i have an allergy.'

   phoebe said that we were going to do our home- work. upstairs, i said,
'maybe we should have helped her put away the groceries'

   'she likes to do all that by herself,' phoebe said.

   'are you sure?'

   'of course, i'm sure,' phoebe said. 'i've lived here my whole life, haven't i?'

   i asked phoebe if her mother really had allergies

   'well, gosh, sal, if she says she does, then i guess she does. she's not the
sort of person to lie.'

   'maybe something is wrong. maybe something is bothering her.

   'don't you think she would say so then?'

   'maybe she's afraid to,' i said. i wondered why it was so easy for me to see
that phoebe's mother was worried and miserable, but phoebe couldn't see it -
or if she could, she was ignoring it. maybe she didn't want to notice. maybe
it was too frightening a thing. i started wondering if this was how it

with my mother. were there things i didn't notice?

   phoebe sat quite straight in her chair and said, 'sal. i can assure you that
my mother would not be afraid to say if something is bothering her. what on
earth would she have to be afraid of? we are not exactly a family of lunatics,
you know.'

   later that afternoon, when phoebe and i went downstairs, mrs.
winterbottom was talking with prudence. 'do you think i lead a tiny life?'
she was asking.


   'how do you mean?' prudence asked, as she filed her nails. 'do we have
any nail polish remover?'

   phoebe's mother retrieved a bottle of nail pol

  'oh!' prudence said to her mother. 'before i forget - do you think you
could sew up the hem on my brown skirt so i could wear it tomorrow? oh,
please?' prudence tilted her head to the side and tugged at her hair in exactly
the same way phoebe does. prudence smooshed up her mouth into a little
pout.

   in the kitchen, i said to phoebe, 'doesn't prudence know how to sew?'

   'of course, she does' phoebe said. 'why do you ask?'

   'i was just wondering why she doesn't sew her own skirt.'

   'sal,' phoebe said, 'if you don't mind my saying so, i think you're becoming
ever so critical.'

   before i left phoebe's that day, mrs. winterbottom handed prudence her
brown skirt with the newly sewn hem, and all the way home i wondered
about mrs. winterbottom and what she meant about living a tiny life. if she
didn't like all that baking and cleaning and jumping up to get bottles of nail
polish remover and sewing hems, why did she do it? why didn't she tell
them to do some of these things themse

lves? maybe she was afraid there
would be nothing left for her to do. there would be no need for her and she
would become invisible and no one would notice.

   when i got home that day, my father handed me a package. 'it's from
margaret.' he said.

   'what is it?'

   'i don't know. why don't you open it?'

   inside was a blue sweater. i put it back in the box and went upstairs my
father followed me. 'sal? sal - do you like it?'


   'i don't want it,' i said.

   'she was just trying to - she likes you--'

   'i don't care if she likes me or not,' i said.

   my father stood there looking around the room. 'i want to tell you
something about margaret,' he said.

   'well, i don't want to hear it,' i said. i was feeling so completely ornery.
when my father left the room, i could still hear my own voice saying, 'i
don't want to hear it,' and i knew that i sounded exactly like phoebe.

   i looked up and down the river. not a soul in sight. the water looked cool

and sat down. it was nearly heaven, with that cool water rippling and a high,
clear sky all around us, and trees waving along the banks.

   my hair floated all around me. my mother's hair had been long and black,
like mine, but a week before she left, she cut it. my father said to me, 'don't
cut yours, sal. please, don't cut yours.'

   my mother said, 'i knew you wouldn't like it if i cut mine.'

   my father said, 'i didn't say anything about yours.

   'but, i know what you're thinking,' she said.

   'i loved your hair, sugar,' he said.

   i saved her hair. i swept it up from the kitchen floor and wrapped it in a
plastic bag and hid it beneath the floorboards of my room. it was still there,
along with the postcards she sent.

   as gram, gramps and i sat in the missouri river, i tried not to

bound to be a little pale.

   gram climbed out of bed. 'i'm not invisible, you know. you don't have to
talk as if i'm not here.' her breathing was rapid and raspy she said, 'where's
my underwear?' gramps and the doctor looked at her as she took two steps
and stopped. you could tell her snake-bite leg was bothering her.

'salamanca, would you mind fishing in my suitcase for some clean
underwear?'

   'i guess this cantankerous woman is getting out of here,' gramps said.

   i think fear had made us all a little cantankerous i had spent the night in

he left for lewiston, idaho. gram and gramps came to stay with me. i had
pleaded to go along, but my father said i could not go. that day, i climbed
up into the maple and watched the singing tree, waiting for it to sing. i
stayed there all day and on into the early evening. it did not sing.

   at dusk, gramps placed three sleeping bags at the foot of the tree, and he,
gram and i slept there that night. the tree did not sing. in the hospital
parking lot, ram heard the tree, too. 'oh, salamanca,' she said. ia singing
tree!' she pulled at cramps' sleeve. 'look, a singing tree. that's a good sign,
don't you think? it's like it's following us, all the way from bybanks. oh,
that's a good sign.


   i listened for another few minutes to the tree in the hospital parking lot,
and then climbed in the car.

   as we swept on across south dakota toward the badlands, the whispers no
longer said, hurry, hurry or, rush, rush. they now said, slow down, slow
down. i could not figure this out.

oming back, he chipped away
at the plaster wall and discovered the brick fireplace beneath. the next day
he flew to lewiston, idaho, and when he came back, he did nothing for three
days but chip and chip until every last piece of plaster was removed from
that fireplace and every brick was scrubbed. some of the cement grouting

had to be replaced and i saw that he had written her name in tiny letters in
the new cement. he wrote chanhassen, not sugar.

   three weeks later he put the farm up for sale. by this time, he was
receiving letters from mrs. cadaver, and i knew that he was answering her
letters then he drove up to see mrs. cadaver while i stayed with gram and
gramps when he came back, he said we were moving to euclid. mrs.
cadaver had helped him find a job.

   i didn't even wonder how he had met her or how long he had known her. i
ignored her whole existence. besides, i was too busy throwing the most
colossal temper tantrums i refused to move. i would not leave our farm, our

not leave the place, which belonged to me. i would not leave the place to
which, i was convinced, my mother might return.

   at first, my father did not argue with me. he let me behave like a wild
boar. at last, he took down the for sale sign and put up a for rent sign. he
said he would rent out the farm, hire someone to care for the animals and the
crops, and rent a house for us in euclid. the farm would still belong to us
and one day we could return to it. 'but now,' he said. 'we have to leave
because your mother is haunting me day and night. she's in the fields, the
air, the barn, the walls, the trees.' he said we were making this move to learn
about bravery and courage. that sounded awfully familiar.

   'i've been wanting to explain--' he said.

   i plunged on. i didn't want him to explain. i wanted to warn him. 'phoebe
and i saw her slashing and hacking away at the bushes in her back yard.'

   'is there something wrong with that?' he asked.

   i tried another approach. 'her voice is like dead leaves blowing around,
and her hair is spooky.

   'i see,' he said.


   'and, there is a man who visits her---

   'sal, that sounds like spying.'

   'and, i don't think we should go over there any more.'

   dad took off his glasses and rubbed them on his shirt for about five
minutes. then, he said, 'sal, you're trying to catch fish in the air. your
mother is not coming back.'

   it looked like i was merely jealous of mrs. cadaver. in the calm light of
my father, all those things that phoebe had said about mrs. cadaver seemed
foolish.

   'i'd like to explain about her,' my father said.

   'oh, never mind. j

   'lucky me,' phoebe muttered. mr. birkway asked me to stay after class for
a minute. phoebe sent me warning messages with her eyebrows. as
everyone else was leaving the room, phoebe said, 'i'll stay with you if you
want.'

   'why?'

   'because, sal, because.'

   'because of what?' i said.


   'because of him hacking up mr. cadaver, that's what. i don't think you
should be alone with him.'

   he did not hack me up. instead, he gave me a special assignment, a 'mini
journal'.

   'i don't know what that is,' i said. phoebe was breathing on my shoulder.
mr. birkway said i should write about something that interested me. 'like

   i still, didn't think too much of it. 'she's probably just working late,' i said.

   'i don't know,' phoebe said. 'i don't like it. i don't like it one bit.'

   prudence heated up the spaghetti sauce and boiled the spaghetti, while i
helped phoebe set the table. phoebe and i even made a salad. 'i do feel sort
of independent,' phoebe said.

   phoebe's father came home. 'where's norma?' he said. phoebe showed him
his note. he opened it and sat down, staring at the piece of paper. phoebe
looked over his shoulder and read his note aloud: i had to go away. i can't
explain. i'll call you in a few days. it was signed, norma.

   'he might--

   'phoebe! that's enough.' he sat there staring at the note. then he stood up,

the album quickly when i came in the room, as if he were embarrassed to be

day, our dog, moody blue, caught the baby rabbit in its mouth. moody blue

finally coaxed moody blue to drop it, and when i picked up the rabbit, its
heart was beating faster than anything. faster and faster it went, and then all
of a sudden its heart stopped.

   i took the rabbit to my mother. she said. 'it's dead, salamanca.

   'it can't be dead,' i said. 'it was alive just a minute ago.'

   phoebe said, 'i'm going to the nurse. come with me. please?' in the nurse's
office, phoebe explained that she was having a heart attack. the nurse told
phoebe to lie down. five minutes later the nurse took phoebe's pulse, said
the heart attack had probably subsided, and sent both of us on to class. i

that phoebe didn't want to hear it.

   when my mother did not return, i imagined all sorts of things maybe she
had cancer and didn't want to tell us and was hiding in idaho. maybe she got
knocked on the head and had amnesia and was wandering around lewiston,
not knowing who she really was, or thinking she was someone else. my
father would say, 'she does not have cancer, sal. she does not have amnesia.
'those are fishes in the air.' but i didn't believe him. maybe he was trying to
protect her - or me.

   phoebe prowled through the house, examining the walls and carpet,
searching for blood stains she found several suspicious spots and
unidentifiable hair strands phoebe marked the spots with pieces of adhesive
tape and collected the hairs in an envelope.

   'at least,' phoebe said to me, 'he's taking some action, but i still think
someone should call the police.'

   as i left phoebe's the dead leaf crackly voice of margaret cadaver called
to me from her house next door. 'sal? sal?' i stopped, but i did not go up the

   my father appeared behind her. 'come on, sal,' he said. 'don't be a goose.'

   i asked if i could touch her. she was still a little warm from being inside

hold her, but the doctor said that was not a good idea. i thought maybe if i
held her she would wake up.

   dinner at the finneys was an experience. when we arrived, mary lou's
brothers were running around like crazed animals, jumping over the
furniture and tossing footballs. mary lou's older sister, maggie, was talking
on the telephone and plucking her eyebrows at the same time. mr. finney
was cooking something in the kitchen, with the help of four-year-old

and examined it. when the potatoes came around, phoebe explained that she
was on a diet and could not eat starch. the rest of us looked glumly down at
our plates. there was nothing at all on phoebe's plate. mrs. finney said. 'so
what do you eat, phoebe?'

   'my mother makes special vegetarian meals. low calorie and no
cholesterol. we eat a lot of salads and vegetables. my mother's an excellent
cook.

   she never mentioned the cholesterol in all those pies and brownies her
mother made. i wanted to jump up and say, 'phoebe's mother has
disappeared and that is why phoebe is acting like a complete donkey,' but i
didn't.

   phoebe repeated, 'a truly excellent cook.

   'marvelous' mrs. finney said.

   'do you have any unadulterated vegetables?'

   'unadulterated?' mrs. finney said.

   'it means unspoiled, without any butter or stuff added--

   one by one, everyone at the table turned to stare at phoebe. mrs. finney
got up from the table and went into the kitchen. we heard her opening and
closing cupboards she returned to the doorway. 'muesli?' she asked phoebe.

again and returned with a bowl of dried-up muesli and a bot

   'did you call all of mom's friends?' phoebe asked.

   'phoebe,' he said. 'i'm looking into it. i'm a little tired. do you mind if we
don't discuss this now?'

   'but, don't you think we should call the police?'

you let me know?'

   'of course.'

   'or, what if she telephones? i won't be able to talk with her. maybe i
should stay home. i think i should be here if she telephones.'

   i did not answer. i did not bash her over the head. i knew why she was
acting this way. she sat down on my bed and bounced on it a couple of
times. 'i guess i'll have to get used to your lumpy mattress mine is very firm.
a firm mattress is much better for your back. that's why i have such good
posture. the reason you slouch is probably because of this mattress.'

   'slouch?' i said.

   'i know, i know - sacrifice.'

   later, as i sat at my desk, flipping through a book, she sighed loudly. 'i
guess i'll work on my pandora report, as long as you're going to be doing
homework while i'm visiting.' she said. 'i don't suppose you have another

won't be necessary. i do apologize.


   we followed mr. winterbottom outside. in the car he said nothing. i
thought he might drop me off at my house, but he did not. when we got to
their house, the only thing he said was 'phoebe, i'm going to go talk with
mrs. cadaver. you and sal wait here.'

   when he returned from visiting mrs. cadaver, he said that she was unable
to give him any more information about phoebe's mother's call. all mrs.
winterbottom had said was. 'tell george i am fine and that i will phone him
soon. tell him i would phone him now if i could, but i can't.'

   'that's all?' phoebe asked.

and her annoying comments, there was something about phoebe that was
like a magnet. i was drawn to her. i was pretty sure that underneath all that
odd behaviour was someone who was frightened. and, in a strange way, she
was like another version of me - she acted out the way i sometimes felt.

   i do not think that phoebe actually planned to break into mrs. cadaver's
house but, as she was going to bed, s

   phoebe was waiting in front of mrs. cadaver's house. there were no lights
on there. phoebe said, 'come on,' and she started up the walk.

   i admit that i was reluctant. 'phoebe---

   'shh, i just want to take a quick look.' she crept up onto the porch and
stood by the door. she listened and then tapped twice.

   i don't think phoebe intended to go inside, but she did, and i followed. we

street lamp came in through the window. we went into that room. we both
nearly leaped through the window when someone said, 'sal?' i started
backing toward the door.

   'it's a ghost,' phoebe said.

   'come here,' the voice said.


   as my eyes adjusted to the dim light, i could see someone huddled in a
chair in the far corner. when i saw the cane, i was relieved. 'mrs. partridge?'

   'come over here,' she said. 'who's that with you? is that phoebe?'

   phoebe said, 'yes.' her voice was high and quivery.

without an explanation? well, she might. a person - a mother - might do
that.'

   phoebe said, 'my mother wouldn't. my mother loves me.'

   'but, she might love you and still not have been able to explain.' i was
thinking about the letter my mother left me. 'maybe it would be too painful
for her to explain. maybe it would seem too permanent.'

   'i don't know what in the world you are talking about.'

   'she might not come back, phoebe--'

   'shut up, sal.'

   'she might not. i just think you should be prepared--'

   'she is too coming back. you don't know what you're talking about. you're
being horrid.' phoebe ran into the house.


   when i got home and had crept up to my room, i remembered what my
father had said to me that one night. 'she's not coming back.' he said it
straight out like that. i said, 'she is, too.' he said, 'no, she isn't.' and we
argued back and forth. i was just like phoebe. i didn't want to believe it.

what i wanted
to say - what i wanted to ask you--' i was trying to find a way to ask about
his own mother, but he interrupted me.

   'you've got something on your face,' he said. he reached up and with soft,
warm fingers he rubbed the side of my face. 'it's probably your breakfast.'

   i don't know what came over me. i was going to kiss him. i leaned forward
just as he turned around and slammed the door of his locker. my lips ended
up pressed against the cold, metal locker.

   'you're weird, sal,' he said, as he went off to class.

   i decided that kissing was thumpingly more complicated than i had ever
imagined. circumstances had to be exactly right in order for the kiss to
occur: both people had to be in the same place at the same time and both
people had to remain still so that the kiss ended up in the right place.
actually, i was relieved that my lips ended up on the cold metal locker. i
could not imagine what had come over me. i could not imagine what might
have happened if the k

hen we arrived at yellowstone. all we got to see that evening
was a hot spring. 'we walked on boardwalks placed across the bubbling
mud. 'huzza, huzza!' gram said. we stayed at the old faithful inn in a
frontier cabin. i'd never seen gram so excited. she could not wait for the
next morning. 'we're gonna see old faithful,' she said, over and over.

   'it won't take too very long, will it?' i said, and i felt like a mule saying it,
because gram was so looking forward to it.

   'don't you worry, salamanca: gram said. 'we'll just watch that old geyser
blow up and then we'll hit the road.'

   i prayed all night long to the elm tree outside. i prayed that we would not
get in an accident, that we would get to lewiston, idaho, in time for my
mother's birthday, and that we would bring her home. later i would realize
that i had prayed for the wrong things.

   that night, gram was so excited that she could not sleep. she rambled on
about all sorts of things. she said to cramps 'remember that let

legs like i am doing?'

   'no, i meant are you walking to wherever you're going?'

   'oh, no, it's much too far for these legs jimmy's coming. he'll be here any
minute.' mrs. partridge continued down the front walk. i was amazed that
she didn't fall. she stepped out so confidently, barely using her cane at all. a
car pulled up in front of the house.

   'there he is' she said. she called out to the driver, 'i'm redible. i said i
would be, and here i am.'

   the driver leaped out of the car. 'sal?' he said.'i had no idea you two were
neighbours' it was mr. birkway.

   'we're not neighbours: i said. 'it's phoebe, actually, who is the neighbor.

   'is that right?' he said. he opened the car door for mrs. partridge. 'come
on, mom,' he said. 'let's get a move on.'

   'mom?' i said. i looked at mrs. partridge. 'this is your son? you're his
mother?'

   'why, of course,' mrs. partridge said.' this is my little jimmy.'

   'but, he's a birkway….?'

   mrs. partridge said, 'i was a birkway

e?'

   'phoebe, aren't you going to eat anything?' her father asked.

   'two-four-six... prudence punched the air.

   'let's go upstairs,' phoebe said.

   in phoebe's bedroom, i said, 'i've got two important things to tell you--'

   the doorbell rang. phoebe said, 'shh.' we listened. 'that sounds like mr.
birkway.

   'that's one of the things i want to tell you,' i said. 'about mr. birkway--

   there was a tap on phoebe's door. her father said, 'phoebe? could you
come downstairs with me? sal, maybe you should come too.'

   i thought mr. birkway was going to be extensively angry at phoebe for
what she had written about his sister. the worst thing was that phoebe didn't
even know yet that mrs. cadaver was mr. birkway's sister. i felt like we
were lambs being led to the slaughter. take us, i thought. take us, and do
away with us quickly. we followed phoebe's father downstairs. there, on
the sofa, was mr. birkway, holding phoebe's journal and looking
embarrassed.

   'that is my own p

u to know, mr. birkway said, 'that mr. cadaver is not
buried in her garden. i've also just learned about your mother, phoebe, and
i'm sorry that she is gone, but i want to assure you that margaret would not
have kidnapped or murdered her.

   after mr. birkway left, phoebe and i sat on the front porch. phoebe said,
'if mrs. cadaver didn't kidnap or murder my mother, then where is she?
what can i do? where should i look?'

   'phoebe,' i said. 'there's something i've got to tell you.'

   'look, sal, if you're going to tell me she's not coming back, i don't want to
hear it. you might as well go home now. you might as well--'


   'no, phoebe, that isn't it. i know who the lunatic is. it's sergeant bickle's
son.

   and so we devised a plan.

   at home that night, all i could think about was mrs. cadaver. i could see
her in her white uniform, working in the emergency room. i could see an
ambulance pulling up with its blue lights flashing, and i could see her
walking briskly to the swingin

ant a kiss on me, i knew he
was, but there was nothing i could do about it. i could not help it that
whenever he aimed his mouth in my direction, my body was already moving
away. i needed a little warning.

   i did try remaining completely still for several consecutive minutes, and
during those minutes, i detected ben leaning slightly toward me several
times. each time, however, he drew back, as if someone were con- trolling
him by an invisible thread.

   across the library, beth ann called. 'sal, there's a spider - oh, sal, kill it!'

   when the final bell rang, phoebe and i were out of school like a shot. at
phoebe's house, we examined the telephone directory. 'we've got to hurry,'
phoebe said, 'before prudence or my father come home.' there were six
pickles listed in the directory. we took turns calling. each time, we asked
for sergeant pickle. the first two people said we must have the wrong
number. the third number we dialed was busy. the fourth number, no
answer. the fifth number

bordered by flower gardens
scattered across the lawn were benches and chairs, most of them occupied
with patients and their visitors it was a scene much like the one i had just
left at the university, except here no one was studying, and some of the
people wore dressing gowns

   ben was sitting cross-legged on the ground in front of a woman in a pink
robe. she fidgeted with the sash. ben saw me and stood up as i crossed the
lawn. 'this is my mother,' he said. she did not look up. 'mom. this is
salamanca.' she plucked at her sash. i said hello, but she did not look at me.
instead, she stood and drifted off across the lawn as if we were not there.
ben and i followed.

   she reminded me so much of my mother after she returned from the
hospital. my mother would stop right in the middle of doing something
inside the house and walk out the door. halfway up the hill, she would sit
down to catch her breath. she picked at the grass, got up again, and went a
little further. sometimes my mother we

person at all? did she mention a name?' he was getting agitated.

   'why, no,' prudence said. 'she didn't mention a name. she just said that she
was bringing him with her.

   'him?'

   phoebe looked at me. 'cripes,' she said, and she went into the house,
slamming the door behind her.

   i couldn't believe it. wasn't she going to tell her father what she had seen?
i was bursting at the seams to tell my own father, but when i got home, he
and margaret were sitting on the porch.

   'oh, sal,' margaret said. 'my brother told me you're in his english class.
what a surprise.' she must have already told my father this, because he
didn't look too surprised. 'he's a terrific teacher. do you like him?'

   'i suppose.' i didn't want to talk about it. i wanted margaret to vanish.


   i had to wait until she went home to tell my father about phoebe's mother,
and when i did tell him, all he said was, 'so, mrs. winterbottom is coming
home. that's good. then he went over to the window and s

you to meet
mike.'

   'mike?' mr. winterbottom said. he was quite red in the face. i was glad
there was no axe in the house or i am fairly certain he would have picked it
up and headed straight for mike.

   phoebe said, 'now, dad, don't do anything too rash--'

   'mike?' he repeated.

   mrs. winterbottom called, 'george? phoebe?' we heard her say to
prudence, 'where are they? didn't you tell them we were coming?'

   mr. winterbottom took a deep breath. he said, 'phoebe, i'm not sure you
or sal should be around for this'

   'are you kidding?' phoebe said. he took another deep breath. 'ok,' he said.
'ok. here we go.' he stood up straight and tall and walked through to the
living room. phoebe and i followed.

   honest and truly, i think phoebe nearly fainted dead away on the carpet.
there were two reasons for this the first one was that mrs. winterbottom
looked different. her hair was not only short but also quite stylish. she was

wearing lipstick, mascara and a little blush on her

mr. winterbottom said, 'i think we all need to sit down and talk. maybe
we can sort something out. then he did what i think was a noble thing. he
went over to mike and shook his hand and said, 'i did always think a son
would be a nice addition to this family.

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively relieved. prudence smiled at mike.
phoebe stood quite still off to the side.

   'i'd better go,' i said.

   everyone turned to me as if i had just dropped through the roof. mr.
winterbottom said, 'sal, oh, i am sorry, i truly am.' to mike, he said, 'sal is
like another member of the family.

   mrs. winterbottom went over to phoebe. 'you're mad at me, aren't you,
phoebe?'


   'yes,' phoebe said. 'i most certainly am.' phoebe took my sleeve and pulled
me toward the door. she turned back around to say, 'when you all decide
exactly how many people are in this family, let me know.'

   phoebe pulled me out on the porch, just as mrs. partridge placed a white
envelope on the steps.

 him. when was that?'

   she tapped her head. 'noggin, remember. let's see. some time ago. a
week? 'two weeks? he came to my house by mistake, i suppose. he let me
feel his face. that's why i thought he was your brother. he has a similar
face. isn't that peculible?'

   phoebe looked back toward her house. she said,' no more peculible than
most things lately.'

   mrs. partridge tottered on down the walk and back to her house.

   phoebe stood there looking all around. 'it's a peculible world, sal,' she
said, and then she walked across the grass and spit into the street. she said,
'come on, try it.' i spit into the street. 'what do you think?' phoebe said. we
spit again.

   it might sound thumpingly disgusting, but to tell the truth, we got a great
deal of pleasure from those spits. i doubt if i ever could explain why that
was, but for some reason it seemed the perfect thing to do, and when phoebe
turned around and went into the house, i knew that that was the right thing
for her to do,

ound of the river gurgling
by, i heard a bird. it was singing a birdsong, a true, sweet birdsong. i looked
all around and then up into the willow that leaned toward the river. the
birdsong came from the top of the willow and i did not want to look too
closely, because i wanted it to be the tree that was singing.

   i went up and kissed the willow. 'happy birthday,' i said.

   in the sheriff's car, i said, 'she isn't actually gone at all. she's singing in
the trees'

   'whatever you say, miss salamanca hiddle.'

   'you can take me to jail now.'


44. our gooseberry


   instead of taking me to jail, the sheriff drove me to coeur d'alene, with
the deputy following us in cramps' car. the sheriff gave me a lengthy and
severe lecture about driving without a license, and he made me promise that
i would not drive again until i was sixteen.

   'not even on cramps' farm?' i said.

   he looked straight ahead at the road. 'i suppose people are going to do
whatever they want to on their own far

they have a lot
of room to maneuver and as long as they are not endangering the lives of any
other persons or animals. but, i'm not saying you ought to. i'm not giving
you permission or anything.'

   i asked him to tell me about the bus accident. i asked him if he had been
there that night and if he had seen anyone brought out of the bus


   he said, 'you don't want to know all that. a person shouldn't have to think
about those things'

   'did you see my mother?'

   'i saw a lot of people, salamanca, and maybe i saw your mother and
maybe i didn't, but i'm sorry to say that if i did see her, i didn't know it. i
remember your father coming in to the station. i do remember that, but i
wasn't with him when - i wasn't there when--'

   'did you see mrs. cadaver?' i said.

   'how do you know about mrs. cadaver?' he said. 'of course i saw mrs.
cadaver. everyone saw mrs. cadaver. nine hours after that bus rolled over,
as all those stretchers were being carried up the hill, and everyone

father isn't ready to love anyone else yet. your mother was one of a kind.'

   that's true. she was.

   and even though mrs. cadaver had told me all this and had told me how
she had been with my mother in her last minutes, i still did not believe that
my mother was actually dead. i still thought that there might have been a
mistake. i don't know what i had hoped to find in lewiston. maybe i
expected that i would see her walking through a field and i would call to her
and she would say 'oh, salamanca, my left arm,' and 'oh, salamanca, take
me home.'

   i slept for the last fifty miles into coeur d'alene and when i awoke, i was
sitting in the sheriff's car outside the hospital entrance. the sheriff was
coming out of the hospital he handed me an envelope and slid in beside me
on the seat.

   in the envelope was a note from gramps giving the name of the motel he
was staying at. beneath that he had written, 'i am sorry to say that our
gooseberry died at three o'clock this morning.'

named huzza huzza. gramps pets the puppy and smokes his pipe as i drive,
and we both play the moccasin game. it is a game we made up on our way
back from idaho. we take turns pretending we are walking in someone else's
moccasins

   'if i was walking in peeby's moccasins, i would be jealous of a new brother
dropping out of the sky.'

   'if i was in gram's moccasins right this minute, i would want to cool my
feet in that river over there.'

   'if i was walking in ben's moccasins, 1 would miss salamanca hiddle.'

   on and on we go. we walk in everybody's moccasins, and we have
discovered some interesting things that way. one day i realized that our
whole trip out to lewiston had been a gift from gram and gramps to me.
they were giving me a chance to walk in my mother's moccasins - to see
what she had seen and feel what she might have felt on her last trip.

   and, another afternoon, after we had been talking about prometheus
stealing fire from the sun to give to man, and about pandora

 heard the singing tree sing.
the sugar maple tree is my thinking place. yesterday in the sugar maple, i
realized that i was jealous of three things

   the first jealousy is a foolish one. i am jealous of whomever ben wrote
about in his journal, because it was not me.

   the second jealousy is this: i am jealous that my mother had wanted more
children. wasn't i enough? when i walk in her moccasins, though, i say, 'if i

were my mother, i might want more children - not because i don't love my
salamanca, but because i love her so much. i want more of these.' maybe
that is a fish in the air and maybe it isn't, but it is what i want to believe.

   the last jealousy is not foolish, nor is it one that will go away just yet. i
am still jealous that phoebe's mother came back and mine did not.

   i miss my mother.

   ben and phoebe write to me all the time. ben sent me a valentine in the
middle of october that said,


roses are red
dirt is brown,

please be my valentine,

or else i'll frown.
