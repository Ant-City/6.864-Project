'faith, i must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us of all our
cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.

now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!

bawd.
'faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the way to the pox.
here comes the lord lysimachus disguised.

boult.
we should have both lord and lown, if the peevish baggage would
but give way to customers.

lysimachus.
how now!  how a dozen of virginities?

bawd.
now, the gods to bless your honour!

boult.
i am glad to see your honour in good health.

lysimachus.
you may so; 'tis the better for you that your resorters stand
upon sound legs. how now! wholesome iniquity have you that a
man may deal withal, and defy the surgeon?

bawd.
we have here

 one, sir, if she would -- but there never came her
like in mytilene.

lysimachus.
if she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.

bawd.
your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.

lysimachus.
well, call forth, call forth.

boult.
for flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall see a rose;
and she were a rose indeed, if she had but --

lysimachus.
what, prithee?

boult.
o, sir, i can be modest.

lysimachus.
that dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it gives a good
report to a number to be chaste.

[exit boult.]

bawd.
here comes that which grows to the stalk; never plucked yet, i
can assure you.

[re-enter boult with marina.]

is she not a fair creature?

lysimachus.
'faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea. well, there's
for you:  leave us.

bawd.
i beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and i'll have done
presently.

lysimachus.
i beseech you, do.

 i would have you note, this is an honourable man.

marina.
i desire to find him so, that i may worthily note him.

bawd.
next, he's the governor of this country, and a man whom i am
bound to.

marina.
if he govern the country, you are bound to him indeed; but how
honourable he is in that, i know not.

bawd.
pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will you use him
kindly? he will line your apron with gold.

marina.
what he will do graciously, i will thankfully receive.

lysimachus.
ha' you done?

bawd.
my lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some pains to work
her to your manage. come, we will leave his honour and her
together.  go thy ways.

[exeunt bawd, pandar, and boult.]

lysimachus.
now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?

marina.
what trade, sir?

lysimachus.
why, i cannot name't but i shall offend.

marina.
i cannot be offended with my trade. please you to name it.

lysimachus.
how long have you been of this profession?

lysimachus.
did you go to't so young? were you a gamester at five or at
seven?

marina.
earlier, too, sir, if now i be one.

lysimachus.
why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a creature of
sale.

marina.
do you know this house to be a place of such resort, and will
come into 't? i hear say you are of honourable parts, and are
the governor of this place.

lysimachus.
why, hath your principal made known unto you who i am?

marina.
who is my principal?

lysimachus.
why, your herb-woman;  she that sets seeds and roots of shame and
iniquity. o, you have heard something of my power, and so stand
aloof for more serious wooing. but i protest to thee, pretty one,
my authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly upon thee.

lord lysimachus.

bawd.
o abominable!

boult.
she makes our profession as it were to stink afore the face of
the gods.

bawd.
marry, hang her up for ever!

boult.
the nobleman would have dealt with her like a nobleman, and she
sent him away as cold as a snowball; saying his prayers too.

bawd.
boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure: crack the glass of
her virginity, and make the rest malleable.

boult.
an if she were a thornier piece of ground than she is, she shall
be ploughed.

first, what is your place?

lysimachus.
i am the governor of this place you lie before.

helicanus.
sir,
our vessel is of tyre, in it the king;
a man who for this three months hath not spoken
to any one, nor taken sustenance
but to prorogue his grief.

lysimachus.
upon what ground is his distemperature?

helicanus.
'twould be too tedious to repeat;
but the main grief springs from the loss
of a beloved daughter and a wife.

she questionless with her sweet harmony
and other chosen attractions, would allure,
and make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
which now are midway stopp'd:
she is all happy as the fairest of all,
and, with her fellow maids, is now upon
the leafy shelter that abuts against
the island's side.

a maid-child call'd marina; who, o goddess,
wears yet thy silver livery. she at tarsus
was nursed with cleon; who at fourteen years
he sought to murder: but her better stars
brought her to mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
riding, her fortunes bro
