ckmann. certainly.

mrs. stockmann (coming back). she has just gone with it.

billing. upon my soul, doctor, you are going to be the foremost man in the town!

dr. stockmann (walking about happily). nonsense! as a matter of
fact i have done nothing more than my duty. i have only made a lucky find—that's all. still, all the same...

billing. hovstad, don't you think the town ought to give dr. stockmann some sort of testimonial?

hovstad. i will suggest it, anyway.

billing. and i will speak to aslaksen about it.

dr. stockmann. no, my good friends, don't let us have any of that nonsense. i won't hear anything of the kind. and if the baths committee should think of voting me an increase of salary, i will not accept it. do you hear, katherine?—i won't accept it.

mrs. stockmann. you are quite right, thomas.

petra (lifting her glass). your health, father!

hovstad and billing. your health, doctor! good health!

horster (touches glasses with dr. stockmann). i hope it will bring you nothing but

hovstad. yes—and in my opinion a journalist incurs a heavy responsibility if he neglects a favourable opportunity of emancipating the masses—the humble and oppressed. i know well enough that in exalted circles i shall be called an agitator, and all that sort of thing; but they may call what they like. if only my conscience doesn't reproach me, then—

dr. stockmann. quite right! quite right, mr. hovstad. but all the same—devil take it! (a knock is heard at the door.) come in!

(aslaksen appears at the door. he is poorly but decently dressed, in black, with a slightly crumpled white neckcloth; he wears gloves and has a felt hat in his hand.)

aslaksen (bowing). excuse my taking the liberty, doctor—

dr. stockmann (getting up). ah, it is you, aslaksen!

aslaksen. yes, doctor.

hovstad (standing up). is it me you want, aslaksen?

aslaksen. no; i didn't know i should find you here. no, it was the doctor i—

hat i heard from mr. billing true, sir—that you mean to improve our water supply?

dr. stockmann. yes, for the baths.

aslaksen. quite so, i understand. well, i have come to say that i will back that up by every means in my power.

hovstad (to the doctor). you see!

dr. stockmann. i shall be very grateful to you, but—

aslaksen. because it may be no bad thing to have us small tradesmen at your back. we form, as it were, a compact majority in the town—if we choose. and it is always a good thing to have the majority with you, doctor.

dr. stockmann. that is undeniably true; but i confess i don't see why such unusual precautions should be necessary in this case. it seems to me that such a plain, straightforward thing.

aslaksen. oh, it may be very desirable, all the same. i know our local authorities so well; officials

 are not generally very ready to act on proposals that come from other people. that is why i think it would not be at all amiss if we made a little demonstration.

hovstad. that's right.

dr. stockmann. demonstration, did you say? what on earth are you going to make a demonstration about?

aslaksen. we shall proceed with the greatest moderation, doctor. moderation is always my aim; it is the greatest virtue in a citizen—at least, i think so.

dr. stockmann. it is well known to be a characteristic of yours, mr. aslaksen.

aslaksen. yes, i think i may pride myself on that. and this matter of the water supply is of the greatest importance to us small tradesmen. the baths promise to be a regular gold-mine for the town. we shall all make our living out of them, especially those of us who are

dr. stockmann. yes—?

aslaksen. and, what is more, local secretary of the temperance society—you know, sir, i suppose, that i am a worker in the temperance cause?

dr. stockmann. of course, of course.

aslaksen. well, you can understand that i come into contact with a great many people. and as i have the reputation of a temperate and law-abiding citizen—like yourself, doctor—i have a certain influence in the town, a little bit of power, if i may be allowed to say so.

dr. stockmann. i know that quite well, mr. aslaksen.

aslaksen. so you see it would be an easy matter for me to set on foot some testimonial, if necessary.

dr. stockmann. a testimonial?

aslaksen. yes, some kind of an address of tha

nks from the townsmen for your share in a matter of such importance to the community. i need scarcely say that it would have to be drawn up with the greatest regard to moderation, so as not to offend the authorities—who, after all, have the reins in their hands. if we pay strict attention to that, no one can take it amiss, i should think!

hovstad. well, and even supposing they didn't like it—

aslaksen. no, no, no; there must be no discourtesy to the authorities, mr. hovstad. it is no use falling foul of those upon whom our welfare so closely depends. i have done that in my time, and no good ever comes of it. but no one can take exception to a reasonable and frank expression of a citizen's views.

dr. stockmann (shaking him by the hand). i can't tell you, dear mr. aslaksen, how extremely pleased i am to find such hearty support among my fellow-citizens. i am delighted—delighted! now, you wi

aslaksen. no, thank you; i never drink alcohol of that kind.

dr. stockmann. well, what do you say to a glass of beer, then?

aslaksen. nor that either, thank you, doctor. i never drink anything as early as this. i am going into town now to talk this over with one or two householders, and prepare the ground.

dr. stockmann. it is tremendously kind of you, mr. aslaksen; but i really cannot understand the necessity for all these precautions. it seems to me that the thing should go of itself.

aslaksen. the authorities are somewhat slow to move, doctor. far be it from me to seem to blame them—

hovstad. we are going to stir them up in the paper tomorrow, aslaksen.

aslaksen. but not violently, i trust, mr. hovstad. proceed with moderation, or you will do nothing with them. you may take my advice; i have gathered my experience in the school of life. well, i mu

dr. stockmann. i am very much obliged, dear mr. aslaksen, (shakes hands with him.) goodbye, goodbye.

aslaksen. are you going my way, towards the printing-office. mr. hovstad?

hovstad, i will come later; i have something to settle up first.

aslaksen. very well. (bows and goes out; stockmann follows him into the hall.)

hovstad (as stockmann comes in again). well, what do you think of that, doctor? don't you think it is high time we stirred a little life into all this slackness and vacillation and cowardice?

dr. stockmann. are you referring to aslaksen?

hovstad, yes, i am. he is one of those who are floundering in a bog—decent enough fellow though he may be, otherwise. and most of the people here are in just the same case—see-sawing a

dr. stockmann, yes, but aslaksen seemed to me so thoroughly well-intentioned.

hovstad. there is one thing i esteem higher than that; and that is for a man to be self-reliant and sure of himself.

dr. stockmann. i think you are perfectly right there.

hovstad. that is why i want to seize this opportunity, and try if i cannot manage to put a little virility into these well-intentioned people for once. the idol of authority must be shattered in this town. this gross and inexcusable blunder about the water supply must be brought

hovstad. yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the first blow.

billing. that is true; and for that reason we must strike blow upon blow until the whole of this aristocracy tumbles to pieces. as i sat in there reading this, i almost seemed to see a revolution in being.

hovstad (turning round). hush!—speak so that aslaksen cannot hear you.

billing (lowering his voice). aslaksen is a chicken-hearted chap, a coward; there is nothing of the man in him. but this time you will insist on your own way, won't you? you will put the doctor's article in?

hovstad. yes, and if the mayor doesn't like it—

billing. that will be the devil of a nuisance.

dr. stockmann. yes, print away. undoubtedly it has come to that. now they must take what they get. there is going to be a fight in the town, mr. billing!

billing. war to the knife, i hope! we will get our knives to their throats, doctor!

dr. stockmann. this article is only a beginning. i have already got four or five more sketched out in my head. where is aslaksen?

billing (calls into the printing-room). aslaksen, just come here for a minute!

hovstad. four or five more articles, did you say? on the same subject?

dr. stockmann. no—far from it, my dear fellow. no, they are about quite another matter. but they all spring from the question of the water supply and the drainage. one thing leads to another, you know. it is like beginning to pull down an old house, exactly.

hovstad. i think it is simply a masterpiece.

aslaksen. in that case we may venture to print it.

dr. stockmann. i should think so!

hovstad. we will put it in tomorrow morning.

dr. stockmann. of course—you must not lose a single day. what i wanted to ask you, mr. aslaksen, was if you would supervise the printing of it yourself.

aslaksen. with pleasure.

dr. stockmann. take care of it as if it were a treasure! no misprints—every word is important. i will look in again a little later; perhaps you will be able to let me see a proof. i can't tell you how eager i am to see it in print, and see it burst upon the public—

hovstad. oh, you mustn't be surprised at anything from that quarter.

dr. stockmann. well, they will get the worst of it with me; they may assure themselves of that. i shall consider the "people's messenger" my sheet-anchor now, and every single day i will bombard them with one article after another, like bombshells—

aslaksen. yes, but

dr. stockmann. i shall smite them to the ground—i shall crush them—i shall break down all their defenses, before the eyes of the honest public! that is what i shall do!

aslaksen, yes, but in moderation, doctor—proceed with moderation.

hovstad. for my part i think we have now a prospect of getting the municipal authority into the hands where it should lie.

aslaksen. and if only we proceed with moderation, i cannot imagine that there will be any risk.

dr. stockmann. who the devil cares whether there is any risk or not! what i am doing, i am doing in the name of truth and for the sake of my conscience.

hovstad. you are a man who deserves to be supported, doctor.

aslaksen. yes, there is no denying that the doctor is a true friend to the town—a real friend to the community, that he is.

billing. take my word for it, aslaksen, dr. stockmann is a friend of

aslaksen. i fancy the householders' association will make use of that expression before long.

dr. stockmann (affected, grasps their hands). thank you, thank you, my dear staunch friends. it is very refreshing to me to hear you say that; my brother called me something quite different. by jove, he shall have it back, with interest! but now i must be off to see a poor devil—i will come back, as i said. keep a very careful eye on the manuscript, aslaksen, and don't for worlds leave out any of my notes of exclamation! rather put one or two more in! capital, capital! well, good-bye for the present—goodbye, goodbye! (they show him to the door, and bow him out.)

hovstad. he may prove an invaluably useful man to us.

aslaksen. yes, so long as he confines himself to this matter of the baths. but if he goes farther afield, i don't think it would be advisable to follow him.

hovstad. hm!—that all depends—

billing. you are so infernally timid, a

aslaksen. timid? yes, when it is a question of the local authorities, i am timid, mr. billing; it is a lesson i have learned in the school of experience, let me tell you. but try me in higher politics, in matters that concern the government itself, and then see if i am timid.

billing. no, you aren't, i admit. but this is simply contradicting yourself.

aslaksen. i am a man with a conscience, and that is the whole matter. if you attack the government, you don't do the community any harm, anyway; those fellows pay no attention to attacks, you see—they go on just as they are, in spite of them. but local authorities are different; they can be turned out, and then perhaps you may get an ignorant lot into office who may do irreparable harm to the householders and everybody else.

hovstad. but what of the education of citizens by self government—don't yo

billing. hear, hear!

aslaksen (with a smile). hm! (points to the desk.) mr. sheriff stensgaard was your predecessor at that editorial desk.

billing (spitting). bah! that turncoat.

hovstad. i am not a weathercock—and never will be.

aslaksen. a politician should never be too certain of anything, mr. hovstad. and as for you, mr. billing, i should think it is time for you to be taking in a reef or two in your sails, seeing that you are applying for the post of secretary to the bench.

hovstad. because your father cannot do without my help.

peter stockmann. the medical officer of the baths is responsible for what happened today.

hovstad. indeed? the doctor?

peter stockmann. he has addressed a kind of report to the baths committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the baths.

hovstad. has he indeed?

peter stockmann. yes—has he not told you? i thought he said—

hovstad. ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about—

hovstad. oh, is that what you were speaking about?

peter stockmann. and a man of very considerable influence.

aslaksen. chiefly among the small tradesmen, sir.

peter stockmann. the small tax-payers are the majority—here as everywhere else.

aslaksen. that is true.

peter stockmann. and i have no doubt you know the general trend of opinion among them,

aslaksen. yes i think i may say i do, mr. mayor.

peter stockmann. yes. well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town—

aslaksen. what?

hovstad. self-sacrifice?

peter stockmann. it is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling, extremely pleasing evidence. i might almost say i hardly expected it. but you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than i.

aslaksen. but, mr. mayor—

peter stockmann. and indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is going to make.

hovstad. the town?

aslaksen. but i don't understand. is it the baths—?

peter stockmann. at a provisional estimate, the alterations that the medical officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewhere about twenty thousand pounds.

aslaksen. that is a lot of money, but—

peter stockmann. of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal loan.

hovstad (getting up). surely you never m

aslaksen. do you mean that it must come out of the municipal funds?—out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen?

peter stockmann. well, my dear mr. aslaksen, where else is the money to come from?

aslaksen. the gentlemen who own the baths ought to provide that.

peter stockmann. the proprietors of the baths are not in a position to incur any further expense.

aslaksen. is that absolutely certain, mr. mayor?

peter stockmann. i have satisfied myself that it is so. if the town wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them.

aslaksen. but, damn it all—i beg your pardon—this is quite another matter, mr. hovstad!

hovstad. it is, indeed.

peter stockmann. the most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged to shut the baths for a couple of years.

peter stockmann. unfortunately, that is an extremely difficult question to answer, mr. aslaksen. but what would you have us do? do you suppose we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming that our water is polluted, that we are living over a plague spot, that the entire town—

(dr. stockmann has put on the mayor's hat and taken his stick in his hand. he goes up to the door, opens it, and stands with his hand to his hat at the salute. peter stockmann comes in, red with anger. billing follows him.)

peter stockmann. what does this tomfoolery mean?

dr. stockmann. be respectful, my good peter. i am the chief authority in the town now. (walks up and down.)

mrs. stockmann (almost in tears). really, thomas!

dr. stockmann. pooh! do you think the newly awakened lionhearted people are going to be frightened by an official hat? there is going to be a revolution in the town tomorrow, let me tell you. you thought you could turn me out; but now i shall turn you out—turn you out of all your various offices. do you think i cannot? listen to me. i have triumphant social forces behind me. hovstad and billing will thunder in the "people's messenger," and aslaksen will take the field at the head of the whole householders' association—

aslaksen. that i won't, doctor.

dr. stockmann. of course you will—

peter stockmann. ah!—may i ask then if mr. hovstad intends to join this agitation?

hovstad. no, mr. mayor.

aslaksen. no, mr. hovstad is not such a fool as to go and ruin his paper and himself for the sake of an imaginary grievance.

dr. stockmann. a false light! leave that part of it to me. only print my article; i am quite capable of defending it.

hovstad. i am not going to print it. i cannot and will not and dare not print it.

dr. stockmann. you dare not? what nonsense!—you are the editor; and an editor controls his paper, i suppose!

aslaksen. no, it is the subscribers, doctor.

peter stockmann. fortunately, yes.

aslaksen. it is public opinion—the enlightened public—householders and people of that kind; they control the newspapers.

dr. stockmann (composedly). and i have all these influences against me?

aslaksen. yes, you have. it would mean the absolute ruin of the community if your article were to appear.

dr. stockmann. indeed.

mrs. stockmann. you need not concern yourself about his family, thank you, mr. hovstad.

peter stockmann (taking a paper from his pocket). it will be sufficient, for the guidance of the public, if this appears. it is an official statement. may i trouble you?

hovstad (taking the paper). certainly; i will see that it is printed.

dr. stockmann. but not mine. do you imagine that you can silence me and stifle the truth! you will not find it so easy as you suppose. mr. aslaksen, kindly take my manuscript at once and print it as a pamphlet—at my expense. i will have four hundred copies—no, five or six hundred.

aslaksen. if you offered me its weight in gold, i could not lend my press for any such purpose, doctor. it would be flying in the face of public opinion. you will not get it printed anywhere in the town.

dr. stockmann. then give it me back.

aslaksen. not a single one, i am certain.

billing. no, i'm damned if you will find one.

mrs. stockmann. but this is too shameful! why should every one turn against you like that?

dr. stockmann (angrily). i will tell you why. it is because all the men in this town are old women—like you; they all think of nothing but their families, and never of the community.

mrs. stockmann (putting her arm into his). then i will show them that an old woman can be a man for once. i am going to stand by you, thomas

dr. stockmann. yes, i am.

aslaksen. you won't find a single man in the whole town to go with you.

mrs. stockmann. don't give in, thomas. i will tell the boys to go with you.

mrs. stockmann. morten will be delighted; and ejlif will do whatever he does.

4th citizen. but the mayor is his brother.

1st citizen. that doesn't matter; dr. stockmann's not the chap to be afraid.

peter stockmann. for various reasons, which you will easily understand, i must beg to be excused. but fortunately we have amongst us a man who i think will be acceptable to you all. i refer to the president of the householders' association, mr. aslaksen.

several voices. yes—aslaksen! bravo aslaksen!

(dr. stockmann takes up his ms. and walks up and down the platform.)

aslaksen. since my fellow-citizens choose to entrust me with this duty, i cannot refuse.

(loud applause. aslaksen mounts the platform.)

billing (writing), "mr. aslaksen was elected with enthusiasm."

aslaksen. and now, as i am in this position, i should like to say a few brief words. i am a quiet and peaceable man, who believes in discreet moderation, and—and—in moderat

several voices. that's right! that's right, aslaksen!

aslaksen. i have learned in the school of life and experience that moderation is the most valuable virtue a citizen can possess—

peter stockmann. hear, hear!

aslaksen. —and moreover, that discretion and moderation are what enable a man to be of most service to the community. i would therefore suggest to our esteemed fellow-citizen, who has called this meeting, that he should strive to keep strictly within the bounds of moderation.

a man by the door. three cheers for the moderation society!

(sounds of disapproval among the audience, and some cat-calls.)

aslaksen (ringing his bell). silence, please, gentlemen! i beg to support the mayor's motion. i quite agree with him that there is something behind this agitation started by the doctor. he talks about the baths; but it is a revolution he is aiming at—he wants to get the administration of the town put into new hands. no one doubts the honesty of the doctor's intentions—no one will suggest that there can be any two opinions as to that, i myself am a believer in self-government for the people, provided

entation of the state of affairs—

dr. stockmann. misrepresentation—!

hovstad. well, let us say a not entirely trustworthy representation. the mayor's statement has proved that. i hope no one here has any doubt as to my liberal principles; the attitude of the "people's messenger" towards important political questions is well known to everyone. but the advice of experienced and thoughtful men has convinced me that in purely local matters a newspaper ought to proceed with a certain caution.

aslaksen. i entirely agree with the speaker.

hovstad. and, in the matter before us, it is now an undoubted fact that dr. stockmann has public opinion against him. now, what is an editor's first and most obvious duty, gentlemen? is it not to work in harmony with his readers? has he not received a sort of tacit mandate to work persistently and assiduously for the welfare of those whose opinions he represents? or is it possible i am mistaken in that?

voices from the crowd. no, no! you are quite right!

 is true! bravo, stockmann!

hovstad. but my duty to the community obliged me to break with him. and there is another consideration that impels me to oppose him, and, as far as possible, to arrest him on the perilous course he has adopted; that is, consideration for his family—

dr. stockmann. please stick to the water-supply and drainage!

hovstad. —consideration, i repeat, for his wife and his children for whom he has made no provision.

morten. is that us, mother?

mrs. stockmann. hush!

aslaksen. i will now put the mayor's proposition to the vote.

dr. stockmann. there is no necessity! tonight i have no intention of dealing with all that filth down at the baths. no; i have something quite different to say to you.

a number of voices (shouting). don't talk about the baths! we won't hear you! none of that!

dr. stockmann. i have already told you that what i want to speak about is the great discovery i have made lately—the discovery that all the sources of our moral life are poisoned and that the whole fabric of our civic community is founded on the pestiferous soil of falsehood.

voices of disconcerted citizens. what is that he says?

peter stockmann. such an insinuation—!

aslaksen (with his hand on his bell). i call upon the speaker to moderate his language.

dr. stockmann. i have always loved my native town as a man only can love the home of his youthful days. i was not old when i went away from here; and exile, longing and memories cast as it were an additional halo over both the town and its inhabitants. (some clapping and applause.) and there i stayed, for many years, in a horrible hole far away up north. when i came into contact with some of the people that lived sc

dr. stockmann. and so, with my eyes blinded to the real facts, i revelled in happiness. but yesterday morning—no, to be precise, it was yesterday afternoon—the eyes of my mind were opened wide, and the first thing i realised was the colossal stupidity of the authorities—. (uproar, shouts and laughter, mrs. stockmann coughs persistently.)

peter stockmann. mr. chairman!

aslaksen (ringing his bell). by virtue of my authority—!

dr. stockmann. it is a petty thing to catch me up on a word, mr. aslaksen. what i mean is only that i got scent of the unbelievable piggishness our leading men had been responsible for down at the baths. i can't stand leading men at any price!—i have had enough of such people in my time. they are like billy-goats on a young plantation; they do mischief everywhere. they stand in a free man's way, whichever way he turns, and what i should like

aslaksen (with his hand on his bell). doctor—!

dr. stockmann. i cannot understand how it is that i have only now acquired a clear conception of what these gentry are, when i had almost daily before my eyes in this town such an excellent specimen of them—my brother peter—slow-witted and hide-bound in prejudice—.

2nd citizen. he doesn't belong here.

3rd citizen. i expect he is a navvy from over at—(the rest is inaudible).

aslaksen. he had obviously had too much beer. proceed, doctor; but please strive to be moderate in your language.

dr. stockmann. very well, gentlemen, i will say no more about our leading men. and if anyone imagines, from what i have just said, that my object is to attack these people this evening, he is wrong—absolutely wide of the mark. for i cherish the comforting conviction that these parasites—all these venerable relics of a dying school of thought—are most admirably paving the way for their

(tremendous uproar. most of the crowd are shouting, stamping and hissing. some of the older men among them exchange stolen glances and seem to be enjoying themselves. mrs. stockmann gets up, looking anxious. ejlif and morten advance threateningly upon some schoolboys who are playing pranks. aslaksen rings his bell and begs for silence. hovstad and billing both talk at once, but are inaudible. at last quiet is restored.)

aslaksen. as chairman, i call upon the speaker to withdraw the ill-considered expressions he has just used.

dr. stockmann. never, mr. aslaksen! it is the majority in our community that denies me my freedom and seeks to prevent my speaking the truth.

hovstad. the majority always has right on its side.

billing. and truth too, by god!

dr. stockmann. the majority never has

wenty years—seldom longer. but truths as aged as that are always worn frightfully thin, and nevertheless it is only then that the majority recognises them and recommends them to the community as wholesome moral nourishment. there is no great nutritive value in that sort of fare, i can assure you; and, as a doctor, i ought to know. these "majority truths" are like last year's cured meat—like rancid, tainted ham; and they are the origin of the moral scurvy that is rampant in our communities.

aslaksen. it appears to me that the speaker is wandering a long way from his subject.

peter stockmann. i quite agree with the chairman.

dr. stockmann. have you gone clean out of your senses, peter? i am sticking as closely to my subject as i can; for my subject is precisely this, that it is the masses, the majority—this infernal compact majority—that poisons the sources of our moral life and infects the ground we stand on.

hovstad. and all this because the great, broadminded majority of the peopl

the floor ought to be scrubbed as well, but that is a debatable question—in such a house, let me tell you, people will lose within two or three years the power of thinking or acting in a moral manner. lack of oxygen weakens the conscience. and there must be a plentiful lack of oxygen in very many houses in this town, i should think, judging from the fact that the whole compact majority can be unconscientious enough to wish to build the town's prosperity on a quagmire of falsehood and deceit.

aslaksen. we cannot allow such a grave accusation to be flung at a citizen community.

a citizen. i move that the chairman direct the speaker to sit down.

voices (angrily). hear, hear! quite right! make him sit down!

dr. stockmann (losing his self-control). then i will go and shout the truth at every street corner! i will write it in other towns' newspapers! the whole country shall know what is going on here!

hovstad. it almost seems as if dr. stockmann's intention were to ruin the town.

aslaksen. this is really serious. (uproar and cat-calls mrs. stockmann coughs, but to no purpose; her husband does not listen to her any longer.)

hovstad (shouting above the din). a man must be a public enemy to wish to ruin a whole community!

dr. stockmann (with growing fervor). what does the destruction of a community matter, if it lives on lies? it ought to be razed to the ground. i tell you— all who live by lies ought to be exterminated like vermin! you will end by infecting the whole country; y

voices from the crowd. that is talking like an out-and-out enemy of the people!

billing. there sounded the voice of the people, by all that's holy!

the whole crowd (shouting). yes, yes! he is an enemy of the people! he hates his country! he hates his own people!

aslaksen. both as a citizen and as an individual, i am profoundly disturbed by what we have had to listen to. dr. stockmann has shown himself in a light i should never have dreamed of. i am unhappily obliged to subscribe to the opinion which i have just heard my estimable fellow-citizens utter; and i propose that we should give expression to that opinion in a resolution. i propose a resolution as follows: "this meeting declares that it considers dr. thomas stockmann, medical officer of the baths, to be

dr. stockmann (to the men who are hissing him). oh, you fools! i tell you that—

aslaksen (ringing his bell). we cannot hear you now, doctor. a formal vote is about to be taken; but, out of regard for personal feelings, it shall be by ballot and not verbal. have you any clean paper, mr. billing?

billing. i have both blue and white here.

aslaksen (going to him). that will do nicely; we shall get on more quickly that way. cut it up into small strips—yes, that's it. (to the meeting.) blue means no; white means yes. i will come round myself and collect votes. (peter stockmann leaves

hovstad. call it what you like, we could not do otherwise.

dr. stockmann. you dared not do otherwise—isn't that it?

hovstad. well, if you like to put it that way.

aslaksen. but why did you not let us have word of it beforehand?—just a hint to mr. hovstad or to me?

dr. stockmann. a hint? of what?

aslaksen. of what was behind it all.

dr. stockmann. i don't understand you in the least—

aslaksen (with a confidential nod). oh yes, you do, dr. stockmann.

hovstad. it is no good making a mystery of it any longer.

dr. stockmann (looking first at one of them and then at the other). what the devil do you both mean?

aslaksen. may i ask if your father-in-law is not going round the town buying up all the shares in the baths?

dr. stockmann. yes, he has been buying baths shares today; but—

aslaksen.

 it would have been more prudent to get someone else to do it—someone less nearly related to you.

hovstad. and you should not have let your name appear in the affair. there was no need for anyone to know that the attack on the baths came from you. you ought to have consulted me, dr. stockmann.

dr. stockmann (looks in front of him; then a light seems to dawn on him and he says in amazement.) are such things conceivable? are such things possible?

aslaksen (with a smile). evidently they are. but it is better to use a little finesse, you know.

hovstad. and it is much better to have several persons in a thing of that sort; because the responsibility of each individual is lessened, when there are others with him.

dr. stockmann (composedly). come to the point, gentlemen. what do you want?

aslaksen. perhaps mr. hovstad had better—

hovstad. no, you tell him, aslaksen.

aslaksen. well, the fact is that, now we know the bearings of the whole affair

dr. stockmann. do you dare do that now? what about public opinion? are you not afraid of a storm breaking upon our heads?

aslaksen. and you must be ready to go off quickly on a new tack, doctor. as soon as your invective has done its work—

dr. stockmann. do you mean, as soon as my father-in-law and i have got hold of the shares at a low figure?

hovstad. your reasons for wishing to get the control of the baths are mainly scientific, i take it.

dr. stockmann. of course; it was for scientific reasons that i persuaded the old "badger" to stand in with me in the matter. so we will tinker at the conduit-pipes a little, and

dr. stockmann. quite so. and so is public opinion. and you, mr. aslaksen—i suppose you will be answerable for the householders' association?

aslaksen. yes, and for the temperance society. you may rely on that.

dr. stockmann. but, gentlemen—i really am ashamed to ask the question—but, what return do you—?

hovstad. we should prefer to help you without any return whatever, believe me. but the "people's messenger" is in rather a shaky condition; it doesn't go really well; and i should be very unwilling to suspend the paper now, when there is so much work to do here in the political way.
