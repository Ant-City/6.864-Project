included, seemed to lack. call it a sense of equanimity, or a feeling of inner
peace, maybe even a constant and unwavering faith that someday the long

and by god, it almost seemed to me that somewhere i could hear andy dufresne
laughing.
norton finally got a skinny drink of water on the night shift to go into the
hole that had been behind andy's poster of linda ronstadt. the skinny guard's
name was rory tremont, and he was not exactly a ball of fire in the brains
department. maybe he thought he was going to win a bronze star or something. as
it turned out, it was fortunate
