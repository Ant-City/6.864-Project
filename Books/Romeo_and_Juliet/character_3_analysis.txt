Mercutio
With a lightning-quick wit and a clever mind, Mercutio
is a scene stealer and one of the most memorable characters in all
of Shakespeare's works. Though he constantly puns, jokes, and teases--sometimes
in fun, sometimes with bitterness--Mercutio is not a mere jester
or prankster. With his wild words, Mercutio punctures the romantic
sentiments and blind self-love that exist within the play. He mocks
Romeos self-indulgence just as he ridicules Tybalt's hauteur and
adherence to fashion. The critic Stephen Greenblatt describes Mercutio
as a force within the play that functions to deflate the possibility
of romantic love and the power of tragic fate. Unlike the other
characters who blame their deaths on fate, Mercutio dies cursing
all Montagues and Capulets. Mercutio believes that specific people
are responsible for his death rather than some external impersonal
force.
