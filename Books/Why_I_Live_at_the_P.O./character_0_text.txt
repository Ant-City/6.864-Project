why i live at the p.o.


i was getting along fine with mama, papa-daddy and uncle rondo until my sister stella-rondo just separated from her husband and came back home again. mr. whitaker! of course i went with mr. whitaker first, when he first appeared here in china grove, taking "pose yourself" photos, and stella-rondo broke us up. told him i was one-sided. bigger on one side than the other, which is a deliberate, calculated falsehood: i'm the same. stella-rondo is exactly twelve months to the day younger than i am and for that reason she's spoiled.
   she's always had anything in the world she

t," says mama. "i'm thoroughly ashamed of you." but of course she wasn't.
   stella-rondo just calmly takes off this hat, i wish you could see it. she says, "why, mama, shirley-t.'s adopted, i can prove it."
   "how?" says mama, but all i says was, "h'm!" there i was over the hot stove, trying to stretch two chickens over five people and a completely unexpected child into the bargain, without one moment's notice.
   "what do you mean  -  'h'm!'?" says stella-rondo, and mama says, "i heard that, sister."
   i said that oh, i didn't mean a thing, only that whoever shirley-t. was, she was the spit-image of papa-daddy if he'd cut off his beard, which of course he'd never do in the world. papa-daddy's mama's papa and sulks.
   stella-rondo got furious! she said, "sister, i don't need to tell you you got a lot of nerve and always did have and i'll thank you to make no future reference to my adopted child whatsoever."
   "very well," i said. "very well, very well. of course i noticed at once she lo

de too. that frown. she looks like a cross between mr. whitaker and papa-daddy."
   "well, all i can say is she isn't."
   "she looks exactly like shirley temple to me," says mama, but shirley-t. just ran away from her.
   so the first thing stella-rondo did at the table was turn papa-daddy against me.
   "papa-daddy," she says. he was trying to cut up his meat. "papa-daddy!" i was taken completely by surprise. papa-daddy is about a million years old and's got this long-long beard. "papa-daddy, sister says she fails to understand why you don't cut off your beard."
   so papa-daddy l-a-y-s down his knife and fork! he's real rich. mama says he is, he says he isn't. so he says, "have i heard correctly? you don't understand why i don't cut off my beard?"
   "why," i says, "papa-daddy, of course i understand, i did not say any such of a thing, the idea!"
   he says, "hussy!"
   i says, "papa-daddy, you know i wouldn't any more want you to cut off your beard than the man in the moon. it was the fa

r my words: i'll never cut off my beard as long as i live, even one inch, and i don't appreciate it in you at all." passed right by me in the hall and went straight out and got in the hammock.
   it would be a holiday. it wasn't five minutes before uncle rondo suddenly appeared in the hall in one of stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimonos, all cut on the bias, like something mr. whitaker probably thought was gorgeous.
   "uncle rondo!" i says. "i didn't know who that was! where are you going?"
   "sister," he says, "get out of my way, i'm poisoned."
   "if you're poisoned stay away from papa-daddy," i says. "keep out of the hammock. papa-daddy will certainly beat you on the head if you come within forty miles of him. he thinks i deliberately said he ought to cut off his beard after he got me the p.o., and i've told him and told him and told him, and he acts like he just don't hear me. papa-daddy must of gone stone deaf.'
   "he picked a fine day to do it then," says uncle rondo, and before you

for your uncle rondo in his precarious condition, i must say. or poor little adopted shirley-t. shame on you!"
   that made me tired. i says, "well, stella-rondo had better thank her lucky stars it was her instead of me came trotting in with that very peculiar-looking child. now if it had been me that trotted in from illinois and brought a peculiar-looking child of two, i shudder to think of the reception i'd of got, much less controlled the diet of an entire family."
   "but you must remember, sister, that you were never married to mr. whitaker in the first place and didn't go up to illinois to live," says mama, shaking a spoon in my face. "if you had i would of been just as overjoyed to see you and your little adopted girl as i was to see stella-rondo, when you wound up with your separation and came on back home."
   ''you would not," i says.
   "don't contradict me, i would," says mama.
   but i said she couldn't convince me though she talked till she was blue in the face. then i said, "b

esides, you know as well as i do that that child is not adopted."
   "she most certainly is adopted," says mama, stiff as a poker.
   i says, "why, mama, stella-rondo had her just as sure as anything in this world, and just too stuck up to admit it."
   "why, sister," said mama. "here i thought we were going to have a pleasant fourth of july, and you start right out not believing a word your own baby sister tells you!"
   "just like cousin annie flo. went to her grave denying the facts of life," i remind mama.
   "i told you if you ever mentioned annie flo's name i'd slap your face," says mama, and slaps my face.
   "all right, you wait and see," i says.
   "i," says mama, "i  prefer to take my children's word for anything when it's humanly possible." you ought to see mama, she weighs two hundred pounds and has real tiny feet.
   just then something perfectly horrible occurred to me.

equently drank like a fish," says mama. "i believed to my soul he drank chemicals."  and without another word she marches to the foot of the stairs and calls stella-rondo.
   "stella-rondo? o-o-o-o-o! stella-rondo!"
   "what?" says stella-rondo from upstairs. not even the grace to get up off the bed.
   "can that child of yours talk?" asks mama.
   stella-rondo says, "can she what?"
   "talk! talk!" says mama. "burdyburdyburdyburdy!"
   so stella-rondo yells back, "who says she can't talk?"
   "sister says so," says mama.
   "you didn't have to tell me, i know whose word of honor don't mean a thing in this house," says stella-rondo.
   and in a minute the loudest yankee voice i ever heard in my life yells out, "oe'm pop-oe the sailor-r-r-r ma-a-an!" and then somebody jumps up and down in the upstairs hall. in another second the house would of fallen down.
   "not only talks, she can tap-dance!" calls stella-rondo. "which is more than some people i won't name can do."
   "why, the little prec

ious darling thing!" mama says, so surprised. "just as smart as she can be!" starts talking baby talk right there. then she turns on me. "sister, you ought to be thoroughly ashamed! run upstairs this instant and apologize to stella-rondo and shirley-t."
   "apologize for what?" i says. "i merely wondered if the child was normal, that's all. now that she's proved she is, why, i have nothing further to say."
   but mama just turned on her heel and flew out, furious. she ran right upstairs and hugged the baby. she believed it was adopted. stella-rondo hadn't done a thing but turn her against me from upstairs while i stood there helpless ov

ught to try to eat a little something. so finally uncle rondo said he would try a little cold biscuits and ketchup, but that was all. so she  brought it to him.
   "do you think it wise to disport with ketchup in stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimono?'' i says. trying to be considerate! if stella-rondo couldn't watch out for her trousseau, somebody had to.
   "any objections?" asks uncle rondo, just about to pour out all the ketchup.
   "don't mind what she says, uncle rondo," says stella-rondo. "sister has been devoting this solid afternoon to sneering out my bedroom window at the way you look."
   "what's that?" says unde rondo. uncle rondo has got the most terrible temper in the world. anything is liable to make him tear the house down if it comes at the wrong time.
   so stella-rondo says, "sister says, 'uncle rondo certainly does look like a fool in that pink kimono!' "
   do you remember who it was really said that?
   unde rondo spills out all the ketchup and jumps out of his chair and

e first thing they knew, i marched in where they were all playing old maid and pulled the electric oscillating fan out by the plug, and everything got real hot. next i snatched the pillow i'd done the needlepoint on right off the davenport from behind papa-daddy. he went ''ugh!" i beat stella-rondo up the stairs and finally found my charm bracelet in her bureau drawer under a picture of nelson eddy.
   "so that's the way the land lies," says uncle rondo. there he was, piecing on the ham. "well, sister, i'll be glad to donate my army cot if you got any place to set it up, providing you'll leave right this minute and let me get some peace." uncle rondo was in france.
   "thank you kindly for the cot and 'peace' is hardly the word i would select if i had to resort to firecrackers at 6:30 a.m. in a young girl's bedroom," i says back to him. "and as to where i intend to go, you seem to forget my position as postmistress of china grove, mississippi," i says. "i've always got the p.o."

y," i says. "and who you think's going to sit down and write you all those big fat letters and postcards, by the way? mr. whitaker? just because he was the only man ever dropped down in china grove and you got him  -  unfairly  -  is he going to sit down and write you a lengthy correspondence after you come home giving no rhyme nor reason whatsoever for your separation and no explanation for the presence of that child? i may not have your brilliant mind, but i fail to see it."
   so mama says, "sister, i've told you a thousand times that stella-rondo simply got homesick, and this child is far too big to be hers," and she says, "now, why don't you all just sit down and play casino?"
   then shirley-t. sticks out her tongue at me in this perfectly horrible way. she has no more manners than the man in the moon. i told her she was going to cross her eyes like that some day and they'd stick.
   "it's too late to stop me now," i says. "you should have tried that yesterday. i'm going to the p.o. an

has a fresh conniption fit.
   "he  left her   -  you mark my words," i says. "that's mr. whitaker. i know mr. whitaker. after all, i knew him first. i said from the beginning he'd up and leave her. i foretold every single thing that's happened."
   "where did he go?" asks mama.
   "probably to the north pole, if he knows what's good for him," i says.
   but stella-rondo just bawled and wouldn't say another word. she flew to her room and slammed the door.
   "now look what you've gone and done, sister," says mama. "you go apologize."
   "i haven't got time, i'm leaving," i says.
   "well, what are you waiting around for?" asks uncle rondo.
   so i just picked up the kitchen clock and marched off, without saying "kiss my foot" or anything, and never did tell stella-rondo good-bye.
   there was a girl going along on a little wagon right in front.
   "girl," i says, "come help me haul these things down the hill, i'm going to live in the post office."
   took her nine trips in her express wagon.
