[CHARACTER]  - 
      an emissary from the pope, campeius has come to assess the situation of henry's divorce and give his decision about its legality. he carries papers from rome that apparently grant the divorce, since henry plans to carry it out. he and cardinal wolsey speak to katharine to convince her to take part in the divorce proceedings, and they tell her that henry still loves her and plans to protect her. she curses them both. later, campeius flees to rome after wolsey's correspondence with the pope urging against granting the divorce is discovered. it is not clear whether campeius supports or opposes the divorce or whether he was a pawn of the pope or of wolsey.
