[CHARACTER] - 
the unhappy and fastidious clerk who reunites with
his friend gallaher in "a little cloud." [CHARACTER]'s physical
attributes match his name--he is small, fragile, and delicately groomed.
his tendency to suppress his poetic desires suggests that he also
earns his title by living quietly and without passion. he fleetingly
rebels against his domestic life after hearing about gallaher's
exciting life, then shamefully re-embraces it.
