chapter 1

the departure of boromir

aragorn sped on up the hill. every now and again he bent to the ground. hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.
'i read the signs aright,' he said to himself. 'frodo ran to the hill-top. i wonder what he saw there? but he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again.'
aragorn hesitated. he desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there someth

a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.
'the horn of boromir!' he cried. 'he is in need!' he sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. 'alas! an ill fate is on me this day, and all that i do goes amiss. where is sam?'
as he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. fierce and shrill rose the yells of the orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. drawing his bright sword and crying elendil! elendil! he crashed through the trees.
a mile, maybe, from parth galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found boromir. he was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. but aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feath

ered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. many orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.
aragorn knelt beside him. boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. at last slow words came. 'i tried to take the ring from frodo ' he said. 'i am sorry. i have paid.' his glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. 'they have gone: the halflings: the orcs have taken them. i think they are not dead. orcs bound them.' he paused and his eyes closed wearily. after a moment he spoke again.
'farewell, aragorn! go to minas tirith and save my people! i have failed.'
'no!' said aragorn,

 taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'you have conquered. few have gained such a victory. be at peace! minas tirith shall not fall!'
boromir smiled.
'which way did they go? was frodo there?' said aragorn.
but boromir did not speak again.
'alas!' said aragorn. 'thus passes the heir of denethor, lord of the tower of guard! this is a bitter end. now the company is all in ruin. it is i that have failed. vain was gandalf's trust in me. what shall i do now? boromir has laid it on me to go to minas tirith, and my heart desires it; but where are the ring and the bearer? how shall i find them and save the quest from disaster?'
he knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping boromir's hand. so it was that legolas and gimli found him. they came from t

he western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. gimli had his axe in hand, and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. when they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.
'alas!' said legolas, coming to aragorn's side. 'we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. we came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. i fear you have taken deadly hurt.'
'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound

and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners.'
'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said aragorn. 'are we to abandon him? must we not seek him first? an evil choice is now before us!'
'then let us do first what we must do,' said legolas. 'we have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. a cairn we might build.'
'the labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water-side,' said gimli.
'then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said aragorn. 'we will send him to t

he falls of rauros and give him to anduin. the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.'
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap. 'see!' cried aragorn. 'here we find tokens!' he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 'no orc-tools these!' he said. 'they were borne by the hobbits. doubtless the orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of mordor. well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. i will ta

ke these things, hoping against hope, to give them back.'
'and i,' said legolas, 'will take all the arrows that i can find, for my quiver is empty.' he searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use. he looked at them closely.
and aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'here lie many that are not folk of mordor. some are from the north, from the misty mountains, if i know anything of orcs and their kinds. and here are others strange to me. their gear is not after the manner of orcs at all!'
there were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. they were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and

shape like the bows of men. upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an s-rune, wrought of some white metal.
'i have not seen these tokens before,' said aragorn. 'what do they mean?'
's is for sauron,' said gimli. 'that is easy to read.'
'nay!' said legolas. 'sauron does not use the elf-runes.'
'neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken,' said aragorn. 'and he does not use white. the orcs in the service of barad-dûr use the sign of the red eye.' he stood for a moment in thought. 's is for saruman, i guess,' he said at length. 'there is evil afoot in isengard, and the west is no longer safe. it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor saruman has had news of our journey. it is likely too that he knows of gandalf's fall. pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lórien, or they may have avoided that land and come to isenga

rd by other paths. orcs travel fast. but saruman has many ways of learning news. do you remember the birds?'
'well, we have no time to ponder riddles,' said gimli. 'let us bear boromir away!'
'but after that we must guess the riddles, if we are to choose our course rightly,' answered aragorn.
'maybe there is no right choice,' said gimli.
taking his axe the dwarf now cut several branches. these they lashed together with bowstrings, and spread their cloaks upon the frame. upon this rough bier they carried the body of their companion to the shore, together with such trophies of his last battle as they chose to send forth with him. it was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for boromir was a man both tall and strong.
at the water-side aragorn remained, watching the bier.

while legolas and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen. it was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.
'there is a strange tale to tell!' said legolas. 'there are only two boats upon the bank. we could find no trace of the other.'
'have orcs been there?' asked aragorn.
'we saw no signs of them,' answered gimli. 'and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'
'i will look at the ground when we come there,' said aragorn.
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. the grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. the golden belt of lórien gleamed about his waist. his helm they set beside him, and across his lap

ddenly it vanished. rauros roared on unchanging. the river had taken boromir son of denethor, and he was not seen again in minas tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the white tower in the morning. but in gondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through osgiliath, and past the many mouths of anduin, out into the great sea at night under the stars.
for a while the three companions remained silent, gazing after him. then aragorn spoke. 'they will look for him from the white tower,' he said, 'but he will not return from mountain or from sea.' then slowly he began to sing:
through rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows
the west wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes.
'what news from the west, o wandering wind, do you bring to me tonight?
have you seen boromir the tall by moon or by starlight?'
'i saw him ride over seven streams, over waters wide and grey;
i saw him walk in empty lands, until he pass

'what news from the south, o sighing wind, do you bring to me at eve?
where now is boromir the fair? he tarries and i grieve.'
'ask not of me where he doth dwell-so many bones there lie
on the white shores and the dark shores under the stormy sky;
so many have passed down anduin to find the flowing sea.
ask of the north wind news of them the north wind sends to me!'
'o boromir! beyond the gate the seaward road runs south,
but you came not with the wailing gulls from the grey sea's mouth.'
then aragorn sang again:
from the gate of kings the north wind rides, and past the roaring falls;
and clear and cold about the tower its loud horn calls.
'what news from the north, o mighty wind, do you bring to me today?
what news of boromir the bold? for he is long away.'
'beneath amon hen i heard his cry. there many foes he fought.
his cloven shield, his broken sword, they to the water brought.
his head so proud, his face so fair, his limbs they laid to rest;
and rauros, golden rauros-falls, bore him upo

n its breast.'
'o boromir! the tower of guard shall ever northward gaze
to rauros, golden rauros-falls, until the end of days.'
so they ended. then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen.
'you left the east wind to me,' said gimli, 'but i will say naught of it.'
'that is as it should be,' said aragorn. 'in minas tirith they endure the east wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. but now boromir has taken his road. and we must make haste to choose our own.'
he surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to the earth. 'the orcs have been on this ground,' he said. 'otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. all our footprints are here, crossing and re-crossing. i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for frodo began.' he returned to the

 bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the river. 'there are some clear prints here,' he said. 'a hobbit waded out into the water and back; but i cannot say how long ago.'
'how then do you read this riddle?' asked gimli.
aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. 'two packs are missing.' he said, 'and one is certainly sam's: it was rather large and heavy. this then is the answer: frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. frodo must have returned while we were all away. i met sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so. he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had gone. he did not find it easy to lea

ve sam behind!'
'but why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said gimli. 'that was a strange deed!'
'and a brave deed,' said aragorn. 'sam was right, i think. frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor. but he knew that he must go himself. something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'
'maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled,' said legolas.
'he fled, certainly,' said aragorn, 'but not, i think, from orcs.' what he thought was the cause of frodo's sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say. the last words of boromir he long kept secret.
'well, so much at least is now clear,' said legolas: 'frodo is no longer on this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat. and sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'
'our choice then,' said gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boat and follow frodo, or else to follow the orcs on foot. there is little hop

e either way. we have already lost precious hours.'
'let me think!' said aragorn. 'and now may i make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' he stood silent for a moment. 'i will follow the orcs,' he said at last. 'i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end; but if i seek him now in the wilderness, i must abandon the captives to torment and death. my heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the bearer is in my hands no longer. the company has played its part. yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strengt

 carried it to the trees. they laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. then they left parth galen. the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen. there they picked up the trail of the orcs. it needed little skill to find.
'no other folk make such a trampling,' said legolas. 'it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'
'but they go with a great speed for all that,' said aragorn, 'and they do not tire. and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'
'well, after them!' said gimli. 'dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than orcs. but it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'
'yes,' said aragorn, 'we shall all need the endurance of dwarves. but come! with hope or without hope we will follow the trail of our enemies. and woe to them, if we prove the swifter! we will make such a chase as shall be accounted a marvel among the thr

the eastward slopes were gentler, furrowed with many gullies and narrow ravines. all night the three companions scrambled in this bony land, climbing to the crest of the first and tallest ridge, and down again into the darkness of a deep winding valley on the other side.
there in the still cool hour before dawn they rested for a brief space. the moon had long gone down before them, the stars glittered above them; the first light of day had not yet come over the dark hills behind. for the moment aragorn was at a loss: the orc-trail had descended into the valley, but there it had vanished.
'which way would they turn, do you think?' said legolas. 'northward to take a straighter road to isengard, or fangorn, if that is their aim as you guess? or southward to strike the entwash?'
'they will not make for the river, whatever mark they aim at'' said aragorn. 'and unless there is much amiss in rohan and the power of saruman is greatly increased; they will take the shortest way that they can find over

the fields of the rohirrim. let us search northwards!'
the dale ran like a stony trough between the ridged hills, and a trickling stream flowed among the boulders at the bottom. a cliff frowned upon their right; to their left rose grey slopes, dim and shadowy in the late night. they went on for a mile or more northwards. aragorn was searching. bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up into the western ridge. legolas was some way ahead. suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him.
'we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 'look!' he pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. five dead orcs lay there. they had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been behead

ed. the ground was wet with their dark blood.
'here is another riddle!' said gimli. 'but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait.'
'yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said legolas. 'enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends. do any folk dwell in these hills?'
'no,' said aragorn. 'the rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from minas tirith. it might be that some company of men were hunting here for reasons that we do not know. yet i think not.'
'what do you think?' said gimli.
'i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered aragorn. 'these are northern orcs from far away. among the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badges. there was a quarrel, i guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. maybe there was some dispute about

the road.'
'or about the captives,' said gimli. 'let us hope that they, too, did not meet their end here.'
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be found. they went on. already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. a little further north they came to a fold in which a tiny stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. in it some bushes grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.
'at last!' said aragorn. 'here are the tracks that we seek! up this water-channel: this is t

sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land. before them in the west the world lay still, formless and grey; but even as they looked, the shadows of night melted, the colours of the waking earth returned: green flowed over the wide meads of rohan; the white mists shimmered in the watervales; and far off to the left, thirty leagues or more, blue and purple stood the white mountains, rising into peaks of jet, tipped with glimmering snows, flushed with the rose of morning.
'gondor! gondor!' cried aragorn. 'would that i looked on you again in happier hour! not yet does my road lie southward to your bright streams.
gondor! gondor, between the mountains and the sea!
west wind blew there; the light upon the silver tree
fell like bright rain in gardens of the kings of old.
o proud walls! white towers! o winged crown and throne of gold!
o gondor, gondor! shall men behold the silver tree,
or west wind blow again between the mountains and the sea?
now let us go!' he said, drawing his eyes away from the

 or more, there was a wide and rugged shelf which ended suddenly in the brink of a sheer cliff: the east wall of rohan. so ended the emyn muil, and the green plains of the rohirrim stretched away before them to the edge of sight.
'look!' cried legolas, pointing up into the pale sky above them. 'there is the eagle again! he is very high. he seems to be flying now away, from this land back to the north. he is going with great speed. look!'
'no, not even my eyes can see him, my good legolas,' said aragorn. 'he must be far aloft indeed. i wonder what is his errand, if he is the same bird that i have seen before. but look! i can see something nearer at hand and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'
'many things,' said legolas. 'it is a great company on foot; but i cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. they are many leagues away: twelve, i guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'
'i think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us 
 
 ___________________________
 
which way to go,' said gimli. 'let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be.'
'i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orcs chose,' said aragorn.
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. it seemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed. every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. the trail led them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily down. in the narrow rav

green tunnels, down long gentle slopes towards the fens of entwash vale far away. they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.
'ah! the green smell!' he said. 'it is better than much sleep. let us run!'
'light feet may run swiftly here,' said aragorn. 'more swiftly, maybe, than iron-shod orcs. now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'
they went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in their eyes. nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed. presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside. 'stay!' he shouted. 'do not follow me yet!' he ran quickly to the right, away from the main trail; for he had see

n footprints that went that way, branching off from the others, the marks of small unshod feet. these, however, did not go far before they were crossed by orc-prints, also coming out from the main trail behind and in front, and then they curved sharply back again and were lost in the trampling. at the furthest point aragorn stooped and picked up something from the grass; then he ran back.
'yes,' he said, 'they are quite plain: a hobbit's footprints. pippin's i think. he is smaller than the other. and look at this! he held up a thing that glittered in the sunlight. it looked like the new-opened leaf of a beech-tree, fair and strange in that treeless plain.
'the brooch of an elven-cloak!' cried legolas and gimli together.
'not idly do the leaves of lórien fall,' said aragorn. 'this did not drop by chance: it was ca

ht of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart.'
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze. the sun sank. shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east. still the hunters held on. one day now had passed since boromir fell, and the orcs were yet far ahead. no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted. only twice in the day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn.
'we have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'
'unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sleep.' said legolas. 'surely even orcs must pause on the march?' said gimli. 'seldom will orcs journey in the open under the sun.

yet these have done so,' said legolas. 'certainly they will not rest by night.'
'but if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said gimli.
'the trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said legolas.
'maybe, i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'
'and there is this also,' said gimli: 'only by day can we see if any tracks lead away. if a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off, eastward, say, to the great river, towards mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'
'that is true,' said aragorn. 'but if i read the signs back yonder rightly, the orcs of the white hand prevailed, and the whole co

,' said legolas. 'there will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. how that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake them.'
'and yet even i, dwarf of many journeys, and not the least hardy of my folk, cannot run all the way to isengard without any pause ' said gimli. 'my heart burns me too, and i would have started sooner but now i must rest a little to run the better. and if we rest, then the blind night is the time to do so.'
'i said that it was a hard choice,' said aragorn. 'how shall we end this debate?'
'you are our guide,' said gimli, 'and you are skilled in the chase. you shall choose.'
'my heart bids me go on,' said legolas. 'but we must hold together. i will follow your counsel.'
'you give the choice to an ill chooser,' said aragorn. 'since we passed through the argonath my choices have gone amiss.' he fell silent gazing north and west into the gathering night for a long while.
'we will not walk in the dark,' he said at length. 'the peril of missing the tra

il or signs of other coming and going seems to me the greater. if the moon gave enough light, we would use it, but alas! he sets early and is yet young and pale.'
'and tonight he is shrouded anyway,' gimli murmured. 'would that the lady had given us a light, such a gift as she gave to frodo!'
'it will be more needed where it is bestowed,' said aragorn. 'with him lies the true quest. ours is but a small matter in the great deeds of this time. a vain pursuit from its beginning, maybe, which no choice of mine can mar or mend. well, i have chosen. so let us use the time as best we may!'
he cast himself on the ground and fell at once into sleep, for he had not slept since their night under the shadow of tol brandir. before dawn was in the sky he woke and rose. gimli was still deep in slumber, but legolas was standing, gazing northwards into the d

arkness, thoughtful and silent as a young tree in a windless night.
'they are far far away,' he said sadly, turning to aragorn. 'i know in my heart that they have not rested this night. only an eagle could overtake them now.'
'nonetheless we will still follow as we may,' said aragorn. stooping he roused the dwarf. 'come! we must go,' he said. 'the scent is growing cold.'
'but it is still dark,' said gimli. 'even legolas on a hill-top could not see them till the sun is up.'
'i fear they have passed beyond my sight from hill or plain, under moon or sun,' said legolas.
'where sight fails the earth may bring us rumour,' said aragorn. 'the land must groan under their hated feet.' he stretched himself upon the ground with his ear pressed against the turf. he lay there motionless,

strength even as they ran.
all day the track of their enemies led straight on, going north-west without a break or turn. as once again the day wore to its end they came to long treeless slopes, where the land rose, swelling up towards a line of low humpbacked downs ahead. the orc-trail grew fainter as it bent north towards them, for the ground became harder and the grass shorter. far away to the left the river entwash wound, a silver thread in a green floor. no moving thing could be seen. often aragorn wondered that they saw no sign of beast or man. the dwellings of the rohirrim were for the most part many leagues away to the south, under the wooded eaves of the white mountains, now hidden in mist and cloud; yet the horse-lords had formerly kept many herds and studs in the eastemnet, this easterly region of their realm, and there the herdsmen had wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. but now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet

oung moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.
'now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said legolas. 'the orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of sauron were behind them. i fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'
gimli ground his teeth. 'this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said.
'to hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said aragorn. 'we shall not turn back here. yet i am weary.' he gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the east. 'there is something strange at work in this land. i distrust the silence. i distrust even the pale moon. the stars are faint; and i am weary as i have seldom been before, weary as no ranger should be with a clear trail to follow. there is some will that lends speed to our foes and sets an unseen barrier before us: a weariness that is in the heart more than in t

he limb.'
'truly!' said legolas. 'that i have known since first we came down from the emyn muil. for the will is not behind us but before us.' he pointed away over the land of rohan into the darkling west under the sickle moon. 'saruman!' muttered aragorn. 'but he shall not turn us back! halt we must once more; for, see! even the moon is falling into gathering cloud. but north lies our road between down and fen when day returns.'
as before legolas was first afoot, if indeed he had ever slept. 'awake! awake!' he cried. 'it is a red dawn. strange things await us by the eaves of the forest. good or evil, i do not know; but we are called. awake!'

reached them: green slopes rising to bare ridges that ran in a line straight towards the north. at their feet the ground was dry and the turf short, but a long strip of sunken land, some ten miles wide, lay between them and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. just to the west of the southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. from it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.
'they rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. i fear that your heart spoke truly, legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, i guess, since the orcs stood where we now stand. if they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn.'
'i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said gimli. 'could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'

'well, let us go on,' said gimli. 'my legs must forget the miles. they would be more willing, if my heart were less heavy.'
the sun was sinking when at last they drew near to the end of the line of downs. for many hours they had marched without rest. they were going slowly now, and gimli's back was bent.

stone-hard are the dwarves in labour or journey, but this endless chase began to tell on him, as all hope failed in his heart. aragorn walked behind him, grim and silent, stooping now and again to scan some print or mark upon the ground. only legolas still stepped as lightly as ever, his feet hardly seeming to press the grass. leaving no footprints as he passed; but in the waybread of the elves he found all the sustenance that he needed, and he could sleep, if sleep it could be called by men, resting his mind in the strange paths of elvish dreams, even as he walked open-eyed in the light of this world.

hill smooth and bare, standing by itself, the most northerly of the downs. the sun sank and the shadows of evening fell like a curtain. they were alone in a grey formless world without mark or measure. only far away north-west there was a deeper darkness against the dying light: the mountains of mist and the forest at their feet.
'nothing can we see to guide us here,' said gimli. 'well, now we must halt again and wear the night away. it is growing cold!'
'the wind is north from the snows,' said aragorn.
'and ere morning it will be in the east,' said legolas. 'but rest if you must. yet do not cast all hope away. tomorrow is unknown. rede oft is found at the rising of the sun.'
'three suns already have risen on our chase and brought no counsel ' said gimli.
the night grew ever colder. aragorn and gimli slept fitfully, and whenever they awoke they saw legolas standing beside them, or walking to and fro, singing softly to himself in his own tongue, and as he sang the white stars opened in the har

ngorn; still ten leagues away stood its shadowy eaves, and its further slopes faded into the distant blue. beyond there glimmered far away, as if floating on a grey cloud, the white head of tall methedras, the last peak of the misty mountains. out of the forest the entwash flowed to meet them, its stream now swift and narrow, and its banks deep-cloven. the orc-trail turned from the downs towards it.
following with his keen eyes the trail to the river, and then the river back towards the forest, aragorn saw a shadow on the distant green, a dark swift-moving blur. he cast himself upon the ground and listened again intently. but legolas stood beside him, shading his bright elven-eyes with his long slender hand, and he saw not a shadow, nor a blur, but the small figures of horsemen, many horsemen, and the glint of morning on the tips of their spears was like the twinkle of minute stars beyond the edge of mortal sight. far behind them a dark smoke rose in thin curling threads.
there was a silence

in the empty fields, arid gimli could hear the air moving in the grass.
'riders!' cried aragorn, springing to his feet. 'many riders on swift steeds are coming towards us!'
'yes,' said legolas, 'there are one hundred and five. yellow is their hair, and bright are their spears. their leader is very tall.'
aragorn smiled. 'keen are the eyes of the elves,' he said.
'nay! the riders are little more than five leagues distant,' said legolas.
'five leagues or one,' said gimli; 'we cannot escape them in this bare land. shall we wait for them here or go on our way?'
'we will wait,' said aragorn. 'i am weary, and our hunt has failed. or at least others were before us; for these horsemen are riding back down the orc-trail. we may get new s from them.'
'or spears,' said gimli.
'there are three empty saddles, but i

'i did not say that we should hear good news,' said aragorn. 'but evil or good we will await it here.'
the three companions now left the hill-top, where they might be an easy mark against the pale sky, and they walked slowly down the northward slope. a little above the hill's foot they halted, and wrapping their cloaks about them, they sat huddled together upon the faded grass. the time passed slowly and heavily. the wind was thin and searching. gimli was uneasy.
'what do you know of these horsemen, aragorn?' he said. 'do we sit here waiting for sudden

'i have been among them,' answered aragorn. 'they are proud and wilful, but they are true-hearted, generous in thought and deed; bold but not cruel; wise but unlearned, writing no books but singing many songs, after the manner of the children of men before the dark years. but i do not know what has happened here of late, nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron. they have long been the friends of the people of gondor, though they are not akin to them. it was in forgotten years long ag

o that eorl the young brought them out of the north, and their kinship is rather with the bardings of dale, and with the beornings of the wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the riders of rohan. at least they will not love the orcs.'
'but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor ' said gimli.
'i believe it no more than did boromir,' answered aragorn.
'you will soon learn the truth,' said legolas. 'already they approach.'
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. the horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. they were riding like the wind.
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. suddenly they swept up with a noise like thunder, and the foremost horseman swerved, passing by the foot of the hill, and leading the host back southward along the

elms, and streamed in long braids behind them; their faces were stern and keen. in their hands were tall spears of ash, painted shields were slung at their backs, long swords were at their belts, their burnished skirts of mail hung down upon their knees.
in pairs they galloped by, and though every now and then one rose in his stirrups and gazed ahead and to either side, they appeared not to perceive the three strangers sitting silently and watching them. the host had almost passed when suddenly aragorn stood up, and called in a loud voice:
'what news from the north, riders of rohan?'
with astonishing speed and skill they checked their steeds, wheeled, and came charging round. soon the three companions found themselves in a ring of horsemen moving in a running circle, up the hill-slope behind them and down, round and round them, and drawing ever inwards. aragorn stood silent, and the other two sat without moving, wondering what way things would turn.
without a word or cry, suddenly, the riders

 halted. a thicket of spears were pointed towards the strangers; and some of the horsemen had bows in hand, and their arrows were already fitted to the string. then one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed. he advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of aragorn's breast. aragorn did not stir.
'who are you, and what are you doing in this land?' said the rider, using the common speech of the west, in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir, man of gondor.
'i am called strider,' answered aragorn. 'i came out of the north. i am hunting orcs.'
the rider leaped from his horse. giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. at length he spoke again.

ee that it is not so. indeed you know little of orcs, if you go hunting them in this fashion. they were swift and well-armed, and they were many. you would have changed from hunters to prey, if ever you had overtaken them. but there is something strange about you, strider.' he bent his clear bright eyes again upon the ranger. 'that is no name for a man that you give. and strange too is your raiment. have you sprung out of the grass? how did you escape our sight? are you elvish folk?'
'no,' said aragorn. 'one only of us is an elf, legolas from the woodland realm in distant mirkwood. but we have passed through lothlórien, and the gifts and favour of the lady go with us.'
the rider looked at them with renewed wonder, but his eyes hardened. 'then there is a lady in the golden wood, as old tales tell!' he said. 'few escape her nets, they say. these are strange days! but if you have her favour, then you also are net-weavers and sorcerers, maybe.' he turned a cold glance suddenly upon legolas and g

éomer's eyes blazed, and the men of rohan murmured angrily, and closed in, advancing their spears. 'i would cut off your head, beard and all, master dwarf, if it stood but a little higher from the ground ' said éomer.
'he stands not alone,' said legolas, bending his bow and fitting an arrow with hands that moved quicker than sight. 'you would die before your stroke fell.'
éomer raised his sword, and things might have gone ill, but aragorn sprang between them, and raised his hand. 'your pardon, éomer!' he cried. 'when you know more you will understand why you have angered my companions. we intend no evil to rohan, nor to any of its folk, neither to man nor to horse. will you not hear our tale before you strike?'
'i will,' said éomer lowering his blade. 'but wanderers in the riddermark would be wise to be less haughty in these days of doubt. first tell me your right name.'
'first tell me whom you serve,' said aragorn. 'are you f

'i serve no man,' said aragorn; 'but the servants of sauron i pursue into whatever land they may go. there are few among mortal men who know more of orcs; and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends. in such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. i am not weaponless.'
aragorn threw back his cloak. the elven-sheath glittered as he grasped it, an

gimli and legolas looked at their companion in amazement, for they had not seen him in this mood before. he seemed to have grown in stature while éomer had shrunk; and in his living face they caught a brief vision of the power and majesty of the kings of stone. for a moment it seemed to

éomer stepped back and a look of awe was in his face. he cast down his proud eyes. 'these are indeed strange days,' he muttered. 'dreams and legends spring to life out of the grass.
'tell me, lord,' he said, 'what brings you here? and what was the meaning of the dark words? long has boromir son of denethor been gone seeking an answer, and the horse that we lent him came back riderless. what doom do you bring out of the north?'
'the doom of choice,' said aragorn. 'you may

'that you need not pursue them further,' said éomer. 'the orcs are destroyed.'
'and our friends?'
'we found none but orcs.'
'but that is strange indeed,' said aragorn. 'did you search the slain? were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? they would be small. only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'
'there were no dwarves nor children,' said éomer. 'we counted all the slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as is our custom. the ashes are smoking still.'
'we do not speak of dwarves or children,' said gimli. 'our friends were hobbits.'
'hobbits?' said éomer. 'and what may they be? it is a strange name.'

'a strange name for a strange folk,' said gimli. 'but these were very dear to us. it seems that you have heard in rohan of the words that troubled minas tirith. they spoke of the halfling. these hobbits are halflings.'
'halflings!' laughed the rider that stood beside éomer. 'halflings! but they are only a little people in old songs and children's tales out of the north. do we walk in legends or on the green earth in the daylight?'
'a man may do both,' said aragorn. 'for not we but those who come after will make the legends of our time. the green earth, say you? that is a mighty matter of legend, though you tread it under the light of day!'
'time is pressing,' said the rider, not heeding aragorn. 'we must hasten south, lord. let us leave these wild folk to their fancies. or let us bind them and take them to the king.'
'peace, éothain!' said éomer in his own tongue. 'leave me a while. tell the éored to assemble on the path' and make ready to ride to the

muttering éothain retired, and spoke to the others. soon they drew off and left éomer alone with the three companions.
'all that you say is strange, aragorn.' he said. 'yet you speak the truth, that is plain: the men of the mark do not lie, and therefore they are not easily deceived. but you have not told all. will you not now speak more fully of your errand, so that i may judge what to do?'
'i set out from imladris, as it is named in the rhyme, many weeks ago,' answered aragorn. 'with me went boromir of minas tirith. my errand was to go to that city with the son of denethor, to aid his folk in their war against sauron. but the company that i journeyed with had other business. of that i cannot speak now. gandalf the grey was our leader.'
'gandalf!' éomer exclaimed. 'gandalf greyhame is known in the mark: but his name, i warn you, is no longer a password to the king's favour. he has been a guest in the land many times in the memory of men, coming as he will, after a se

'then shadowfax has found his way alone from the far north,' said aragorn; 'for it was there that he and gandalf parted. but alas! gandalf will ride no longer. he fell into darkness in the mines of moria and comes not again.'
'that is heavy tidings,' said éomer. 'at least to me, and to many; though not to all, as you may find, if you come to the king.'
'it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' said aragorn. 'but when the great fall, the less must lead. my part it has been to guide

'it is now the fourth day since he was slain,' answered aragorn, 'and since the evening of that day we have journeyed from the shadow of tol brandir.'
'on foot?' cried éomer.
'yes, even as you see us.'
wide wonder came into éomer's eyes. 'strider is too poor a name, son of arathorn,' he said. 'wingfoot i name you. this deed of the three friends should be sung in many a hall. forty leagues and five you have measured ere the fourth day is ended! hardy is the race of elendil!

'i will come when i may,' said aragorn.

'indeed in this riding north i went without the king's leave, for in my absence his house is left with little guard. but scouts warned me of the orc-host coming down out of the east wall three nights ago, and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman. so suspecting what i most

'nonetheless we put an end to them. but we have been too long away. we are needed south and west. will you not come? there are spare horses as you see. there is work for the sword to do. yes, and we could find a use for gimli's axe and the bow of legolas, if they will pardon my rash words concerning the lady of the wood. i spoke only as do all men in my land, and i would gladly learn better.'
'i thank you for your fair words,' said aragorn, 'and my heart desires to come with you; but i cannot desert my friends while hope remains.'
'hope does not remain,' said éomer. 'you will not find your friends on the north-borders.'
'yet my friends are not behind. we found a clear token not far from the east wall that one at least of them was still alive there. but between the wall and the downs we have found no other trace of them, and no trail has turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.'
'then what do you think

'i would swear that no orc escaped after we sighted them,' said éomer. 'we reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that any living thing broke through our ring, then it was no orc and had some elvish power.'
'our friends were attired even as we are,' said aragorn; 'and you passed us by under the full light of day.'
'i had forgotten that,' said éomer. 'it is hard to be sure of anything among so many marvels. the world is all grown strange. elf and dwarf in company walk in our daily fields; and folk speak with the lady of the wood and yet live; and the sword comes back to war that was broken in the long ages ere the fathers of our fathers rode into the mark! how shall a man judge what to do in such times?'
'as he ever has judged,' said aragorn. 'good and

'true indeed,' said éomer. 'but i do not doubt you, nor the deed which my heart would do. yet i am not free to do all as i would. it is against our law to let strangers wander at will in our land, until the king himself shall give them leave, and more strict is the command in these days of peril. i have begged you to come back willingly with me, and you will not. loth am i to begin a battle of one hundred against three.'
'i do not think your law was made for such a chance,' said aragorn. 'nor indeed am i a stranger; for i have been in this land before, more than once, and ridden with the host of the rohirrim, though under other name and in other guise. you i have not seen before, for you are young, but i have spoken with éomund your father, and with théoden son of thengel. never in former days would any high lord of this land have constrained a man to abandon such a quest as mine. my duty at least is clear, to go on. come now, son of éomund, the choice must be made at last.

'my company chafes to be away, and every hour lessens your hope. this is my choice. you may go; and what is more, i will lend you horses. this only i ask: when your quest is achieved, or is proved vain, return with the horses over the entwade to meduseld, the high house in edoras where théoden now sits. thus you shall prove to him that i have not misjudged. in this i place myself, and maybe my very life, in the keeping of your good faith. do not fail.'
'i will not,' said aragorn.
there was great wonder, and many dark and doubtful glances, among his men, when éomer gave orders that the spare horses were to be lent to the strangers; but only éothain dared to speak openly.
'it may be well enough for this lord of the race of gondor, as he claims,' he said, 'but who has heard of a horse of the mark being given to a dwarf?'
'no one,' said gimli. 'and do not trouble: no one will ever hear of it. i would sooner walk than sit on the back of any beast so great, free or begrudg

'but you must ride now, or you will hinder us,' said aragorn.
'come, you shall sit behind me, friend gimli, said legolas. then all will be well, and you need neither borrow a horse nor be troubled by one.'
a great dark-grey horse was brought to aragorn, and he mounted it. 'hasufel is his name,' said éomer. 'may he bear you well and to better fortune than gárulf, his late master!'
a smaller and lighter horse, but restive and fiery, was brought to legolas. arod was his name. but legolas asked them to take off saddle and rein. 'i need them not,' he said, and leaped lightly up, and to their wonder arod was tame and willing beneath him, moving here and there with but a spoken word: such was the elvish way with all good beasts. gimli was lifted u

'farewell, and may you find what you seek!' cried éomer. 'return with what speed you may, and let our swords hereafter shine together!'
'i will come,' said aragorn.
'and i will come, too,' said gimli. 'the matter of the lady galadriel lies still between us. i have yet to teach you gentle speech. '
'we shall see,' said éomer. 'so many strange things have chanced that to learn the praise of a fair lady under the loving strokes of a dwarf's axe will seem no great wonder. farewell!'
with that they parted. very swift were the horses of rohan. when after a little gimli looked back, the company of éomer were already small and far away. aragorn did not look bac

aragorn dismounted and surveyed the ground, then leaping back into the saddle, he rode away for some distance eastward, keeping to one side and taking care not to override the footprints. then he again dismounted and examined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot.
'there is little to discover,' he said when he returned. 'the main trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; their outward course must have lain nearer the river. but this eastward trail is fresh and

aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin.
'we can do no more,' said gimli sadly. 'we have been set many riddles since we came to tol brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs'. it will be hard news for frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobb

'but gandalf was not,' said legolas.
'but gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered gimli. 'his foresight failed him.'
'the counsel of gandalf was not founded on foreknowledge of safety, for himself or for others,' said aragorn. 'there are some things that it is better to begin than to refuse, even though the end may be dark. but i shall not depart from this place yet. in any case we must here await the morning-light.'
a little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.

'if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,' said legolas.
'and it might draw other things, neither orc nor hobbit,' said aragorn. 'we are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman. also we are on the very edge of fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'
'but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said gimli, 'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen. yet they passed the night after safely here, when their labour was ended.'
'they were many,' said aragorn, 'and they do not heed the wrath of fangorn, for they come here seldom, and they do not go under the tre

'there is no need,' said gimli. 'the riders have left chip and bough enough, and there is dead wood lying in plenty.' he went off to gather fuel, and busied himself with building and kindling a fire; but aragorn sat silent with his back to the great tree, deep in thought; and legolas stood alone in the open, looking towards the profound shadow of the wood, leaning forward, as one who listens to voices calling from a distance.
when the dwarf had a small bright blaze going, the three companions drew close to it and sat together, shrouding the light with their hooded forms. legolas looked up at the boughs of the tree reaching out above them.
'look!' he said. 'the tree is glad of the fire!'

there was a silence, for suddenly the dark and unknown forest, so near at hand, made itself felt as a great brooding presence, full of secret purpose. after a while legolas spoke again.
'celeborn warned us not to go far into fangorn,' he said. 'do you know why, aragorn? what are the fables of the forest that boromir had heard?'
'i have heard many tales in gondor and elsewhere,' said aragorn, 'but if it were not for the words of celeborn i should deem them only fables that men have made as true knowledge fades. i had thought of asking you what was the truth of the matter. and if an elf of the wood does not know, how shall a man answer?'
'you have journeyed further than i,' said legolas. 'i have heard nothing of this in my own land, save only songs that tell ho

'yes, it is old,' said aragorn, 'as old as the forest by the barrow-downs, and it is far greater. elrond says that the two are akin, the last strongholds of the mighty woods of the elder days, in which the firstborn roamed while men still slept. yet fangorn holds some secret of its own. what it is i do not know.'
'and i do not wish to know,' said gimli. 'let nothing that dwells in fangorn be troubled on my account!'
they now drew lots for the watches, and the lot for the first watch fell to gimli. the others lay down. almost

with that he fell asleep. legolas already lay motionless, his fair hands folded upon his breast, his eyes unclosed, blending living night and deep dream, as is the way with elves. gimli sat hunched by the fire, running his thumb thoughtfully along the edge of his axe. the tree rustled. there was no other sound.

imli looked up, and there just on the edge of the fire-light stood an old bent man, leaning on a staff, and wrapped in a great cloak; his wide-brimmed hat was pulled down over his eyes. gimli sprang up, too amazed for the moment to cry out, though at once the thought flashed into his mind that saruman had caught them. both aragorn and legolas, roused by his sudden movement, sat up and stared. the old man did not speak or make, sign.
'well, father, what can we do for you?' said aragorn, leaping to his feet. 'come and be warm, if you are cold!' he strode forward, but the old man was gone. there was no trace of him to be found near at hand, and they did not dare to wander far. the moon had set and the night was very dark.
suddenly legolas gave a cry. 'the horses! the horses!'
the horses were gone. they had dragged their pickets and disappeared. for me time the three companions stood still and silent, troubled by this new stroke of ill fortune. they were under the eaves of fango

rn, and endless leagues lay between them and the men of rohan, their only friends in this wide and dangerous land. as they stood, it seemed to them that they heard, far off in the night. the sound of horses whinnying and neighing. then all was quiet again, except for the cold rustle of the wind.
'well, they are gone,' said aragorn at last. 'we cannot find them or catch them; so that if they do not return of their own will, we must do without. we started on our feet, and we have those still.'
'feet!' said gimli. 'but we cannot eat them as well as walk on them ' he threw some fuel on the fire and slumped down beside it.
'only a few hours ago you were unwilling to sit on a horse of rohan,' laughed legolas. 'you will make a rider yet.'
'it seems unlikely that i shall have the chance,' said gimli.
'if you wish to know what i

think,' he began again after a while 'i think it was saruman. who else? remember the words of éomer: he walks about like an old man hooded and cloaked. those were the words. he has gone off with our horses, or scared them away, and here we are. there is more trouble coming to us, mark my words!'
'i mark them,' said aragorn. 'but i marked also that this old man had a hat not a hood. still i do not doubt that you guess right, and that we are in peril here, by night or day. yet in the meantime there is nothing that we can do but rest, while we may. i will watch for a while now, gimli. i have more need of thought than of sleep.'
the night passed slowly. legolas followed aragorn, and gimli followed legolas, and their watches wore away. but nothing happened. the old man did not appear again, and the horses did not retu

y were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.
'and do not forget that old man!' said gimli. 'i should be happier if i could see the print of a boot.'
'why would that make you happy?' said legolas.
'because an old man with feet that leave marks might be no more than he seemed,' answered the dwarf.
'maybe,' said the elf; 'but a heavy boot might leave no print here: the grass is deep and springy.'
'that would not baffle a ranger,' said gimli. 'a bent blade is enough for aragorn to read. but i do not expect him to find any traces. it was an evil phantom of saruman that we saw last night. i am sure of it, even under the light of morning. his eyes are looking out on us from fangorn even now, maybe.'
'it is likely enough,' said aragorn; 'yet i am not sure. i am thinking of the horses. you said last night, gimli, that they were scared away. but i did not think so. did you hear them, legolas? did they sound to you like beasts in terror?'
'no,' said legolas. 'i heard them cl

early. but for the darkness and our own fear i should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. they spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed.'
'so i thought,' said aragorn; 'but i cannot read the riddle, unless they return. come! the light is growing fast. let us look first and guess later! we should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, searching carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. to find the hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of our visitor in the night. if they escaped by some chance, then they must have hidden in the trees, or they would have been seen. if we find nothing between here and the eaves of the wood, t

hen we will make a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes. but there is little hope there: the horsemen of rohan did their work too well.'
for some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground. the tree stood mournfully above them, its dry leaves now hanging limp, and rattling in the chill easterly wind. aragorn moved slowly away. he came to the ashes of the watch-fire near the river-bank, and then began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. then he called to the others. they came running up.
'here at last we find news!' said aragorn. he lifted up a broken leaf for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning brown. 'here is a mallorn-leaf of lórien, and there are small

 how did he use the knife? and if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. after that, i suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. it should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!'
'there was sorcery here right enough,' said gimli. 'what was that old man doing? what have you to say, aragorn, to the reading of legolas. can you better it?'
'maybe, i could,' said aragorn, smiling. 'there are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered. i agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. i guess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also because, as i read the marks, he was carried to this point by an orc. blood was spilled there, a few paces away, orc-blood. there are deep prints of hoofs all

 with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. but it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. i say he, though i hope and guess that both merry and pippin were here together. there is, however, nothing to show that for certain.'
'and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked gimli.
'i do not know how it happened,' answered aragorn. 'nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away. not to help them to escape, we may be sure. nay, rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of merry and pippin? they did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards isengard. did they suppose they had captured the ring-bearer and his faithful comrade? i think not. their master

old orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. there, that is my tale. others might be devised. but on this we may count in any case: one at least of our friends escaped. it is our task to find him and help him before we return to rohan. we must not be daunted by fangorn, since need drove him into that dark place.'
'i do not know which daunts me more: fangorn, or the thought of the long road through rohan on foot,' said gimli.
'then let us go to the forest,' said aragorn.
it was not long before aragorn found fresh signs. at one point, near the bank of the entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too light for much to be made of them. then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. the earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal much.
'one hobbit at least stood here for a while and looked back; and then he turned away into the forest,' said aragorn.
'then we must go in, too,' said gimli. 'but i do

'you are a wood-elf, anyway, though elves of any kind are strange folk. yet you comfort me. where you go, i will go. but keep your bow ready to hand, and i will keep my axe loose in my belt. not for use on trees,' he added hastily, looking up at the tree under which they stood. 'i do not wish to meet that old man at unawares without an argument ready to hand, that is all. let us go!'
with that the three hunters plunged into the forest of fangorn. legolas and gimli left the tracking to aragorn. there was little for him to see. the floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. so it was that he came upon the place where merry and pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. there plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.
'this is good tidings,' said aragorn. 'yet the marks are two days old and it seems that at this po

int the hobbits left the water-side.'
'then what shall we do now?' said gimli. 'we cannot pursue them through the whole fastness of fangorn. we have come ill supplied. if we do not find them soon, we shall be of no use to them, except to sit down beside them and show our friendship by starving together.'
'if that is indeed all we can do, then we must do that,' said aragorn. 'let us go on.'
they came at length to the steep abrupt end of treebeard's hill and looked up at the rock-wall with its rough steps leading to the high shelf. gleams of sun were striking through the hurrying clouds, and the forest now looked less grey and drear.
'let us go up and look about us!' said legolas. 'i will feel my breath short. i should like to taste a freer air for a while.'
the companions climbed up. aragorn came last, moving slowly: he was scanning the steps and ledges closely.
'

t. few can foresee whither their road will lead them, till they come to its end.'
'but we did not wish to come to fangorn,' said gimli.
'yet here we are-and nicely caught in the net,' said legolas. 'look!'
'look at what?' said gimli.
'there in the trees.'
'where? i have not elf-eyes.'
'hush! speak more softly! look!' said legolas pointing. 'down in the wood, back in the way that we have just come. it is he. cannot you see him, passing from tree to tree?'
'i see, i see now!' hissed gimli. 'look, aragorn! did i not warn you? there is the old man. all in dirty grey rags: that is why i could not see him at first.'
aragorn looked and beheld a bent figure moving slowly. it was not far away. it looked like an old beggar-man, walking wearily, leaning on a rough staff. his head was bowed, and he did not look towards them. in other lands they would have greeted him with kind words; but now they stood silent, each feeling a strange expectancy: something was approaching that held a hidden power-or menace

.
gimli gazed with wide eyes for a while, as step by step the figure drew nearer. then suddenly, unable to contain himself longer, he burst out: 'your bow, legolas! bend it! get ready! it is saruman. do not let him speak, or put a spell upon us! shoot first!'
legolas took his bow and bent it, slowly and as if some other will resisted him. he held an arrow loosely in his hand but did not fit it to the string. aragorn stood silent, his face was watchful and intent.
'why are you waiting? what is the matter with you?' said gimli in a hissing whisper.
'legolas is right,' said aragorn quietly. 'we may not shoot an old man so, at unawares and unchallenged, whatever fear or doubt be on us. watch and wait!'
at that moment the old man quickened his pace and came with surprising speed to the foot of the rock-wall. then suddenly he looked up, while they stood motionless looking down. there was no sound.

 see his face: he was hooded, and above the hood he wore a wide-brimmed hat, so that all his features were over-shadowed, except for the end of his nose and his grey beard. yet it seemed to aragorn that he caught the gleam of eyes keen and bright from within the shadow of the hooded brows.
at last the old man broke the silence. 'well met indeed, my friends,' he said in a soft voice. 'i wish to speak to you. will you come down or shall i come up?' without waiting for an answer he began to climb.
'now!' said gimli. 'stop him, legolas!'
'did i not say that i wished to speak to you?' said the old man. 'put away that bow, master elf!'
the bow and arrow fell from legolas' hands, and his arms hu

 of gimli's breath could be heard as a loud hiss in the silence.
'well met, i say again!' said the old man, coming towards them. when he was a few feet away, he stood, stooping over his staff, with his head thrust forward, peering at them from under his hood. 'and what may you be doing in these parts? an elf, a man, and a dwarf. all clad in elvish fashion. no doubt there is a tale worth hearing behind it all. such things are not often seen here.'
'you speak as one that knows fangorn well,' said aragorn. 'is that so?'
'not well,' said the old man: 'that would be the study of many lives. but i come here now and again.'
'might we know your name, and then hear what it is that you have to say to us?' said aragorn. 'the morning passes, and we have an errand that will not wait.'
'as for what i wished to say, i have said it: what may you be doing, and what tale can you tell of yourselves? as for my name!' he broke off, laughing long and softly. aragorn felt a shudder run through him at the sound, a s

 did not expect. does that comfort you? and now you would like to know where they were taken? well, well, maybe i can give you some news about that. but why are we standing? your errand, you see, is no longer as urgent as you thought. let us sit down and be more at ease.'
the old man turned away and went towards a heap of fallen stones and rock at the foot of the cliff behind. immediately, as if a spell had been removed, the others relaxed and stirred. gimli's hand went at once to his axe-haft. aragorn drew his sword. legolas picked up his bow.
the old man took no notice, but stooped and sat himself on a low flat stone. then his grey cloak drew apart, and they saw, beyond doubt, that he was clothed beneath all in white.
'saruman!' cried gimli, springing towards him with axe in hand. 'speak! tell us where you have hidden our friends! what have you done with them? speak, or i will make a dint in your hat that even a wizard will find it hard to deal with!'
the old man was too quick for him. he s

prang to his feet and leaped to the top of a large rock. there he stood, grown suddenly tall, towering above them. his hood and his grey rags were flung away. his white garments shone. he lifted up his staff, and gimli's axe leaped from his grasp and fell ringing on the ground. the sword of aragorn, stiff in his motionless hand, blazed with a sudden fire. legolas gave a great shout and shot an arrow high into the air: it vanished in a flash of flame.
'mithrandir!' he cried. 'mithrandir!'
'well met, i say to you again. legolas!' said the old man.
they all gazed at him. his hair was white as snow in the sunshine; and gleaming white was his robe; the eyes under his deep brows were bright, piercing as the rays of the sun; power was in his hand. between wonder, joy, and fear they stood and fou

at last aragorn stirred. 'gandalf!' he said. 'beyond all hope you return to us in our need! what veil was over my sight? gandalf!' gimli said nothing, hut sank to his knees, shading his eyes.
'gandalf,' the old man repeated, as if recalling from old memory a long disused word. 'yes, that was the name. i was gandalf.'
he stepped down from the rock, and picking up his grey cloak wrapped it about him: it seemed as if the sun had been shining, but now was hid in cloud again. 'yes, you may still call me gandalf,' h

 suddenly. 'gandalf!' he said. 'but you are all in white!'
'yes, i am white now,' said gandalf. 'indeed i am saruman, one might almost say, saruman as he should have been. but come now, tell me of yourselves! i have passed through fire and deep water, since we parted. i have forgotten much that i thought i knew, and learned again much that i had forgotten. i can see many things far off, but many things that are close at hand i cannot see. tell me of yourselves!'
'what do you wish to know?' said aragorn. 'all that has happened since we parted on the bridge would be a long tale. will you not first give us news of the hobbits? did you find them, and are they safe?'
'no, i did not find them,' said gandalf. 'there was a darkness over the valleys of the emyn muil, and i did not know of their captivity, until the eagle told me.'
'the eagle!' said legolas. 'i have seen an eagle high and far off: the last time was three days ago, above the emyn muil.'
'yes,' said gandalf, 'that was gwaihir the windlor

'not alone,' said legolas. 'we think that sam went with him.'
'did he!' said gandalf, and there was a gleam in his eye and a smile on his face. 'did he indeed? it is news to me, yet it does not surprise me. good! very good! you lighten my heart. you must tell me more. now sit by me and tell me the tale of your journey.'
the companions sat on the ground at his feet, and aragorn took up the tale. for a long while gandalf said nothing, and he asked no questions. his hands were spread upon his knees, and his eyes were closed. at last when aragorn spoke of the death of boromir and of his last journey upon the great river, the old man sighed.
'you have not said all that you know or guess, aragorn my friend,' he said quietly. 'poor boromir! i could not see what happened to him. it was a sore trial for such a man: a warrior, and a lord of men. galadriel told me that he was i

n peril. but he escaped in the end. i am glad. it was not in vain that the young hobbits came with us, if only for boromir's sake. but that is not the only part they have to play. they were brought to fangorn, and their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains. even as we talk here, i hear the first rumblings. saruman had best not be caught away from home when the dam bursts!'
'in one thing you have not changed, dear friend,' said aragorn: 'you still speak in riddles.'
'what? in riddles?' said gandalf. 'no! for i was talking aloud to myself. a habit of the old: they choose the wisest person present to speak to; the long explanations needed by the young are wearying.' he laughed, but the sound now seemed warm and kindly as a gleam of sunshine.
'i am no longer young even in the reckoning of men of the ancient houses,' said aragorn. 'will you not open your mind more clearly to me?'
'what then shall i say?' said gandalf, and paused

 this new shape in which the ringwraiths have been clad. his thought is ever on the ring. was it present in the battle? was it found? what if théoden, lord of the mark, should come by it and learn of its power? that is the danger that he sees, and he has fled back to isengard to double and treble his assault on rohan. and all the time there is another danger, close at hand, which he does not see, busy with his fiery thoughts. he has forgotten treebeard.'
'now you speak to yourself again,' said aragorn with a smile. 'treebeard is not known to me. and i have guessed part of saruman's double treachery; yet i do not see in what way the coming of two hobbits to fangorn has served, save to give us a long and fruitless chase.'
'wait a minute!' cried gimli. 'there is another thing that i should like to know first. was it you, gandalf, or saruman that we saw last night?'
'you certainly did not see me,' answered gandalf, 'therefore i must guess that you saw saruman. evidently we look so much alike tha

'but the hobbits!' legolas broke in. 'we have come far to seek them, and you seem to know where they are. where are they now?'
'with treebeard and the ents,' said gandalf.
'the ents!' exclaimed aragorn. 'then there is truth in the old legends about the dwellers in the deep forests and the giant shepherds of the trees? are there still ents in the world? i thought they were only a memory of ancient days, if indeed they were ever more than a legend of rohan.'
'a legend of rohan!' cried legolas. 'nay, every elf in wilderland has sung songs of the old onodrim and their long sorrow. yet even among us they are only a memory. if i were to meet one still walking in this world, then indeed i should fee

 i think he saw me, for he paused; but i did not speak, for i was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the eye of mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name.'
'perhaps he also thought that you were saruman,' said gimli. 'but you speak of him as if he was a friend. i thought fangorn was dangerous.'
'dangerous!' cried gandalf. 'and so am i, very dangerous: more dangerous than anything you will ever meet, unless you are brought alive before the seat of the dark lord. and aragorn is dangerous, and legolas is dangerous. you are beset with dangers, gimli son of glóin; for you are dangerous yourself, in your own fashion. certainly the forest of fangorn is perilous-not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and fangorn himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless. but now his long slow wrath is brimming over, and all the forest is filled with it. the coming of the hobbits and the tidings that they brought have spilled it: it will soon be r

'i do not know,' said gandalf. 'i do not think they know themselves. i wonder.' he fell silent, his head bowed in thought.
the others looked at him. a gleam of sun through fleeting clouds fell on his hands, which lay now upturned on his lap: they seemed to be filled with light as a cup is with water. at last he looked up and gazed straight at the sun.
'the morning is wearing away,' he said. 'soon we must go.'
'do we go to find our friends and to see treebeard?' asked aragorn.
'no,' said gandalf. 'that is not the road that you must take. i have spoken words of hope. but only of hope. hope is not victory. war is upon us and all our friends, a war in which only the use of the ring could give us surety of victory. it fills me with great sorrow and great fear: for much shall be destroyed and all may be lost. i am gandalf, gandalf the white, but black is mightier still.'
he rose and gazed out eastward, shading his eyes, as if he saw things far away that none of them coul

he turned. 'come, aragorn son of arathorn!' he said. 'do not regret your choice in the valley of the emyn muil, nor call it a vain pursuit. you chose amid doubts the path that seemed right: the choice was just, and it has been rewarded. for so we have met in time, who otherwise might have met too late. but the quest of your companions is over. your next journey is marked by your given word. you must go to edoras and seek out théoden in his hall. for you are needed. the light of andúril must now be uncovered in the bat

tle for which it has so long waited. there is war in rohan, and worse evil: it goes ill with théoden.'
'then are we not to see the merry young hobbits again?' said legolas.
'i did not say so,' said gandalf. 'who knows? have patience. go where you must go, and hope! to edoras! i go thither also.'
'it is a long way for a man to walk, young or old,' said aragorn. 'i fear the battle will be over long ere i come there.'
'we shall see, we shall see,' said gandalf. 'will you come now with me?'
'yes, we will set out together,' said aragorn. 'but i do not doubt that you will come there before me, if you wish.' he rose and looked long at gandalf. the others gazed at them in silence as they stood there facing one another. the grey figure of the man, aragorn son of arathorn, was tall, and stern as stone, his hand upon the hilt of his sword; he looked as if some

 king out of the mists of the sea had stepped upon the shores of lesser men. before him stooped the old figure, white; shining now as if with some light kindled within, bent, laden with years, but holding a power beyond the strength of kings.
'do i not say truly, gandalf,' said aragorn at last, 'that you could go whithersoever you wished quicker than i? and this i also say: you are our captain and our banner. the dark lord has nine. but we have one, mightier than they: the white rider. he has passed through the fire and the abyss, and they shall fear him. we will go where he leads.'

' 'that indeed is the command of the lady galadriel who sent me to look for you,' he answered.
'thus it was that i came to caras galadhon and found you but lately gone. i tarried there in the ageless time of that land where days bring healing not decay. healing i found, and i was clothed in white. counsel i gave and counsel took. thence by strange roads i came, and messages i bring to some of you. to aragorn i was bidden to say this:

why do thy kinsfolk wander afar?

l not walk. time presses,' said gandalf. then lifting up his head he gave a long whistle. so clear and piercing was the note that the others stood amazed to hear such a sound come from those old bearded lips. three times he whistled; and then faint and far off it seemed to them that they heard the whinny of a horse borne up from the plains upon the eastern wind. they waited wondering. before long there came the sound of hoofs, at first hardly more than a tremor of the ground perceptible only to aragorn as he lay upon the grass, then growing steadily louder and clearer to a quick beat.
'there is more than one horse coming,' said aragorn.
'certainly,' said gandalf. 'we are too great a burden for one.'
'there are three,' said legolas, gazing out over the plain. 'see how they run! there is hasufel, and there is my friend arod beside him! but there is another that strides ahead: a very great horse. i have not seen his like before.'
'nor will you again,' said gandalf. 'that is shadowfax. he is the

 him. 'it is a long way from rivendell, my friend,' he said; 'but you are wise and swift and come at need. far let us ride now together, and part not in this world again!'
soon the other horses came up and stood quietly by, as if awaiting orders. 'we go at once to meduseld, the hall of your master, théoden,' said gandalf, addressing them gravely. they bowed their heads. 'time presses, so with your leave, my friends, we will ride. we beg you to use all the speed that you can. hasufel shall bear aragorn and arod legolas. i will set gimli before me, and by his leave shadowfax shall bear us both. we will wait now only to drink a little.'
'now i understand a part of last night's riddle,' said legolas as he sprang lightly upon arod's back. 'whether they fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. did you know that he was at hand, gandalf?'
'yes, i knew,' said the wizard. 'i bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yesterday he

smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth.
'there lies the gap of rohan,' said gandalf. 'it is now almost due west of us. that way lies isengard.'
'i see a great smoke,' said legolas. 'what may that be?'
'battle and war!' said gandalf. 'ride on!'

chapter 6

the king of the golden hall

they rode on through sunset, and slow dusk, and gathering night. when at last they halted and dismounted, even aragorn was stiff and weary. gandalf only allowed them a few hours' rest. legolas and gimli slept and aragorn lay flat, stretched upon his back; but gandalf stood, leaning on his staff, gazing into the darkness, east and west. all was silent, and there was no sign or sound of living thing. the night was barred with long clouds, fleeting on a chill wind, when they arose again. under the cold moon they went on once more, as swift as by the light of day.
hours passed and still they rode on. gimli nodded a

'look!' said gandalf. 'how fair are the bright eyes in the grass! evermind they are called, simbelmynë in this land of men, for they blossom in all the seasons of the year, and grow where dead men rest. behold! we are come to the great barrows where the sires of théoden sleep.' 'seven mounds upon the left, and nine upon the right,' said aragorn. 'many long lives of men it is since the golden hall was built.'
'five hundred times have the red leaves fallen in mirkwood in my home since then,' said legolas, 'and but a little while does that seem to us.'
'but to the riders of the mark it seems so long ago,' said aragorn, 'that the raising of this house is but a memory of song, and the years before are lost in the mist of time. now they call this land their home, their own, and their speech is sundered from their northern kin.' then he bega

n to chant softly in a slow tongue unknown to the elf and dwarf; yet they listened, for there was a strong music in it.
'that, i guess, is the language of the rohirrim,' said legolas; 'for it is like to this land itself; rich and rolling in part, and else hard and stern as the mountains. but i cannot guess what it means, save that it is laden with the sadness of mortal men.'
'it runs thus in the common speech,' said aragorn, 'as near as i can make it.
where now the horse and the rider? where is the horn that was blowing?
where is the helm and the hauberk, and the bright hair flowing?
where is the hand on the harpstring, and the red fire glowing?

dburg in the land of gondor. who are you that come heedless over the plain thus strangely clad, riding horses like to our own horses? long have we kept guard here, and we have watched you from afar. never have we seen other riders so strange, nor any horse more proud than is one of these that bear you. he is one of the mearas, unless our eyes are cheated by some spell. say, are you not a wizard, some spy from saruman, or phantoms of his craft? speak now and be swift!'
'we are no phantoms,' said aragorn, 'nor do your eyes cheat you. for indeed these are your own horses that we ride, as you knew well are you asked, i guess. but seldom does thief ride home to the stable. here are hasufel and arod, that éomer, the third marshal of the mark, lent to us, only two days ago. we bring them back now, even as we promised him. has not éomer then returned and given warning of our coming?'
a troubled look came into the guard's eyes. 'of éomer i have naught to say,' he answered. 'if what you tell me is t

'yes, i will go,' he answered slowly. 'but what names shall i report? and what shall i say of you? old and weary you seem now, and yet you are fell and grim beneath, i deem'
'well do you see and speak,' said the wizard. 'for i am gandalf. i have returned. and behold! i too bring back a horse. here is shadowfax the great, whom no other hand can tame. and here beside me is aragorn son of arathorn, the heir of kings, and it is to mundburg that he goes. here also are legolas the elf and gimli the dwarf, our comrades. go now and say to your master that we are at his gates and would have speech with him, if he will permit us to come into his hall.' 'strange names you give indeed! but i will report them as you bid and learn my master's will,' said the guard. 'wait here a little while, and f will bring you such answer as seems good to him. do not hope too much! these are dark

'i am the doorward of théoden,' he said. 'háma is my name. here i must bid you lay aside your weapons before you enter.'
then legolas gave into his hand his silver-hafted knife, his quiver and his bow. 'keep these well,' he said, 'for they come from the golden wood and the lady of lothlórien gave them to me.'
wonder came into the man's eyes, and he laid the weapons hastily by the wall, as if he feared to handle them. 'no man will touch them i promise you,' he said.
aragorn stood a while hesitating. 'it is not my will,' he said, 'to put aside my sword or to deliver andúril to the hand of any other man.'
'it is the will of théoden,' said háma.
'it is not clear to me that the will of théoden son of thengel even though he be lord of the mark, should prevail over the will of aragorn son of arathorn, elendil's heir of gondor.'
'this is the house of théoden, not of aragorn, even were he king of gondor in the seat of denethor,' said háma, stepping swiftly before th

'this is idle talk,' said gandalf. 'needless is théoden's demand, but it is useless to refuse. a king will have his way in his own hall, be it folly or wisdom.'
'truly,' said aragorn. 'and i would do as the master of the house bade me, were this only a woodman's cot, if i bore now any sword but andúril.'
'whatever its name may be,' said háma, 'here you shall lay it, if you would not fight alone against all the men in edoras.'
'not alone!' said gimli, fingering the blade of his axe, and looking darkly up at the guard, as if he were a young tree that gimli had a mind to fell. 'not alone!'
'come, come!' said gandalf. 'we are all friends here. or should be; for the laughter o

slowly aragorn unbuckled his belt and himself set his sword upright against the wall. 'here i set it,' he said; 'but i command you not to touch it, nor to permit any other to lay hand on it. in this elvish heath dwells the blade that was broken and has been made again. telchar first wrought it in the deeps of time. death shall come to any man that draws elendil's sword save elendil's heir.'
the guard stepped back and looked with amazement on aragorn. 'it seems that you are come on the wings of song out of the

the guard still hesitated. 'your staff,' he said to gandalf. 'forgive me, but that too must be left at the doors.'
'foolishness!' said gandalf. 'prudence is one thing, but discourtesy is another. i am old. if i may not lean on my stick as i go, then i will sit out here, until it pleases théoden to hobble out himself to speak with me.'
aragorn laughed. 'every man has something too dear to trust to another. but would you part an old man from his support? come, will you not let us enter?'
'the staff in the hand of a wizard may be more than a prop for age' said háma. he looked hard at the ash-staff on which gandalf leaned. 'yet in doubt a man of worth will trust to his own wisdom. i believe you are friends and folk worthy of honour, who have no evil purpose. you may go in.'
the guards now lifted the heavy bars of the doors and swung th

urs. many woven cloths were hung upon the walls, and over their wide spaces marched figures of ancient legend, some dim with years, some darkling in the shade. but upon one form the sunlight fell: a young man upon a white horse. he was blowing a great horn, and his yellow hair was flying in the wind. the horse's head was lifted, and its nostrils were wide and red as it neighed, smelling battle afar. foaming water, green and white, rushed and curled about its knees.
'behold eorl the young!' said aragorn. 'thus he rode out of the north to the battle of the field of celebrant.'
now the four companions went forward, past the clear wood-fire burning upon the long hearth in the midst of the hall. then they halted. at the far end of the house, beyond the hearth and facing north towards the doors, was a dais with three steps; and in the middle of the dais was a great gilded chair. upon it sat a man so bent with age that he seemed almost a dwarf; but his white hair was long and thick and fell in great

'go, éowyn sister-daughter!' said the old king. 'the time for fear is past.'
the woman turned and went slowly into the house. as she passed the doors she turned and looked back. grave and thoughtful was her glance, as she looked on the king with cool pity in her eyes. very fair was her face, and her long hair was like a river of gold. slender and tall she was in her white robe girt with silver; but strong she seemed and stern as steel, a daughter of kings. thus aragorn for the first time in the full light of day beheld éowyn, lady of rohan, and thought her fair, fair and cold, like a morning of pale spring that is not yet come to womanhood. and she now was suddenly aware of him: tall heir of kings, wise with many winters, greycloaked. hiding a power that yet she felt. for a moment still as stone she stood, then turning swiftly she was gone.
'now, lord,' said gandalf, 'look out upon your land! breathe the free air again!'

'that may be. i will do as you ask. call háma to me. since he proved untrusty as a doorward, let him become an errand-runner. the guilty shall bring the guilty to judgement,' said théoden, and his voice was grim, yet he looked at gandalf and smiled and as he did so many lines of care were smoothed away and did not return.
when háma had been summoned and had gone, gandalf led théoden to a stone seat, and then sat himself before the king upon the topmost stair. aragorn and his companions stood nearby.
'there is no time to tell all that you should hear,' said gandalf. 'yet if my hope is not cheated, a time will come ere long when i can speak more fully. behold! you are come into a peril greater even than the wit of wormtongue could weave into your dreams. but see! you dream no longer. you live. gondor and rohan do not stand alone. the enemy is strong beyond our reckoning, yet we have a hope at which he has not guessed.'
quickly now gandalf spoke. his voice was

'this counsel seems good to me now,' said théoden. 'let all my folk get ready! but you my guests-truly you said, gandalf, that the courtesy of my hall is lessened. you have ridden through the night, and the morning wears away. you have had neither sleep nor food. a guest-house shall be made ready: there you shall sleep, when you have eaten.'
'nay, lord,' said aragorn. 'there is no rest yet for the weary. the men of rohan must ride forth today, and we will ride with them, axe, sword, and bow. we did not bring them to rest against your wall, lord of the mark. and i promised éomer that my sword and his should be drawn together.'
'now indeed there is hope of victory!' said éomer.
'hope, yes,' said gandalf. 'but isengard is strong. and other perils draw ever nearer. do not delay, théoden, when we are gone. lead your people swiftly to the hold of dunharrow in

the hills!'
'nay, gandalf!' said the king. 'you do not know your own skill in healing. it shall not be so. i myself will go to war, to fall in the front of the battle, if it must be. thus shall i sleep better.'
'then even the defeat of rohan will be glorious in song,' said aragorn. the armed men that stood near clashed their weapons, crying: 'the lord of the mark will ride! forth eorlingas!'
'but your people must not be both unarmed and shepherdless' said gandalf. 'who shall guide them and govern them in your place?'
'i will take thought for that ere i go,' answered théoden. 'here comes my counsellor.'
at that moment háma came again from the hall. behind him cringing between two other men, came gríma the wormtongue. his face was very white. his eyes blinked in the sun

 'and i give him now gladly. yet it is a great gift. there is none like to shadowfax. in him one of the mighty steeds of old has returned. none such shall return again. and to you my other guests i will offer such things as may be found in my armoury. swords you do not need, but there are helms and coats of mail of cunning work, gifts to my fathers out of gondor. choose from these ere we go, and may they serve you well!'
now men came bearing raiment of war from the king's hoard and they arrayed aragorn and legolas in shining mail. helms too they chose, and round shields: their bosses were overlaid with gold and set with gems, green and red and white. gandalf took no armour; and gimli needed no coat of rings, even if one had been found to match his stature, for there was no hauberk in the hoards of edoras of better make than his short corslet forged beneath the mountain in the north. but he chose a cap of iron and leather that fitted well upon his round head; and a small shield he also took. i

'it may well be so,' said théoden.
the king now rose, and at once éowyn came forward bearing wine. 'ferthu théoden hál!' she said. 'receive now this cup and drink in happy hour. health be with thee at thy going and coming!'
théoden drank from the cup, and she then proffered it to the guests. as she stood before aragorn she paused suddenly and looked upon him, and her eyes were shining. and he looked down upon her fair face and smiled; but as he took the cup, his hand met hers, and he knew that she trembled at the touch. 'hail aragorn son of arathorn!' she said. 'hail lady of rohan!' he answered, but his face now was troubled and he did not smile.
when they had all drunk, the king went down the hall to the doors. there the guards awaited him, and heralds stood, and all the lords and chiefs were gathered togeth

owyn will lead them!'
then the king sat upon a seat before his doors, and éowyn knelt before him and received from him a sword and a fair corslet. 'farewell sister-daughter!' he said. 'dark is the hour, yet maybe we shall return to the golden hall. but in dunharrow the people may long defend themselves, and if the battle go ill, thither will come all who escape.' 'speak not so!' she answered. 'a year shall i endure for every day that passes until your return.' but as she spoke her eyes went to aragorn who stood nearby.
'the king shall come again,' he said. 'fear not! not west but east does our doom await us.'
the king now went down the stair with gandalf beside him. the others followed. aragorn looked back as they passed towards the gate. alone éowyn stood before the doors of the house at the stair's head; the sword was set upright before her, and her hands were laid upon the hilt. she was clad now in mail and shone like silver in the sun.
gimli walked with legolas. his axe on his shoulder.

'and a dwarf is no horseman. it is orc-necks i would hew, not shave the scalps of men,' said gimli, patting the haft of his axe.
at the gate they found a great host of men, old and young, all ready in the saddle. more than a thousand were there mustered. their spears were like a springing wood. loudly and joyously they shouted as théoden came forth. some held in readiness the king's horse, snowmane, and others held the horses of aragorn and legolas. gimli stood ill at ease, frowning, but éomer came up to him, leading his horse.
'hail, gimli glóin's son!' he cried. 'i have not had time to learn gentle speech under your rod, as you promised. but shall we not put aside our quarrel? at least i will speak no evil again of the lady of the wood.'
'i will forget my wrath for a while, éomer son of éomund,' said gimli; 'but if ever you chance to see the lady galadriel with your eyes, then you shall acknowledge her the fairest of lad

'i thank you indeed,' said gimli greatly pleased. 'i will gladly go with you, if legolas, my comrade, may ride beside us.'
'it shall he so,' said éomer. 'legolas upon my left, and aragorn upon my right, and none will dare to stand before us!'
'where is shadowfax?' said gandalf.
'running wild over the grass,' they answered. 'he will let no man handle him. there he goes, away down by the ford, like a shadow among the willows.'
gandalf whistled and called aloud the horse's name, and far away he tossed his head and neighed, and turning sped towards the host like an arrow.
'were the breath of the west wind to take a body visible, even so would it appear,' said éomer, as the great ho

'i thank you, théoden king,' said gandalf. then suddenly he threw back his grey cloak, and cast aside his hat, and leaped to horseback. he wore no helm nor mail. his snowy hair flew free in the wind, his white robes shone dazzling in the sun.
'behold the white rider!' cried aragorn, and all took up the words.
'our king and the white rider!' they shouted. 'forth eorlingas!'
the trumpets sounded. the horses reared and neighed. spear clashed on shield. then the king raised his hand, and with a rush like the sudden onset of a great wind the last host of rohan rode thundering into the west. far over the plain éowyn saw the glitter of their spears, as she stood still, alone before the doors of the silent house.

while théoden was speaking, gandalf rode a short way ahead, and he sat there alone, gazing north to isengard and west to the setting sun. now he came back.
'ride, théoden!' he said. 'ride to helm's deep! go not to the fords of isen, and do not tarry in the plain! i must leave you for a while. shadowfax must bear me now on a swift errand.' turning to aragorn and éomer and the men of the king's household, he cried: 'keep well the lord of the mark, till i return. await me at helm's gate! farewell!'
he spoke a word to shadowfax, and like an arrow from the bow the great horse sprang away. even as they looked he was gone: a flash of silver in the sunset, a wind over the grass, a shadow that fled and passed from sight. snowmane snorted and reared, eager to follow; but only a swift bird on the wing could have overtaken him.
'what does that mean?' said on

'then let us be swift,' said éomer. 'let us drive through such foes as are already between us and the fastness. there are caves in helm's deep where hundreds may lie hid; and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills.
'trust not to secret ways,' said the king. 'saruman has long spied out this land. still in that place our defence may last long. let us go!'
aragorn and legolas went now with éomer in the van. on through the dark night they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains' feet. they found few of the enemy before them. here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs; but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them.
'it will not be long i fear,' said éomer, 'ere the coming of the king's host will be known to the leader of our enemies, saruman or wha

the rumour of war grew behind them. now they could hear, borne over the dark, the sound of harsh singing. they had climbed far up into the deeping-coomb when they looked back. then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon the black fields behind, scattered like red flowers, or winding up from the lowlands in long flickering lines. here and there a larger blaze leapt up.
'it is a great host and follows us hard,' said aragorn.
'they bring fire,' said théoden, 'and they are burning as they come, rick, cot, and tree. this was a rich vale and had many homesteads. alas for my folk!'
'would that day was here and we might ride down upon them like a storm out of the mountains!' said aragorn. 'it grieves me to fly before them.'
'we need not fly much further,' said éomer. 'not far ahead now lies helm's dike, an ancient trench and rampart scored across the coomb, two furlongs below helm's gate. there we can turn and give ba

rang, and a press of roaring men leaped forth. they held their great shields above them like a roof, while in their midst they bore two trunks of mighty trees. behind them orc-archers crowded, sending a hail of darts against the bowmen on the walls. they gained the gates. the trees, swung by strong arms, smote the timbers with a rending boom. if any man fell, crushed by a stone hurtling from above, two others sprang to take his place. again and again the great rams swung and crashed.
éomer and aragorn stood together on the deeping wall. they heard the roar of voices and the thudding of the rams; and then in a sudden flash of light they beheld the peril of the gates.
'come!' said aragorn. 'this is the hour when we draw swords together!'
running like fire, they sped along the wall, and up the steps, and passed into the outer court upon the rock. as they ran they gathered a handful of stout swordsmen. there was a small postern-door that opened in an angle of the burg-wall on the west, where the

 cliff stretched out to meet it. on that side a narrow path ran round towards the great gate, between the wall and the sheer brink of the rock. together éomer and aragorn sprang through the door, their men close behind. the swords flashed from the sheath as one.
'gúthwinë!' cried éomer. 'gúthwinë for the mark!'
'andúril!' cried aragorn. 'andúril for the dúnedain!'
charging from the side, they hurled themselves upon the wild men. andúril rose and fell, gleaming with white fire. a shout went up from wall and tower: 'andúril! andúril goes to war. the blade that was broken shines again!'
dismayed the rammers let fall the trees and turned to fight; but the wall of their shields was broken as by a lightning-stroke, and they were swept away, hewn down, or cast over the rock into the stony stream below. the orc-archers shot wild

ly and then fled.
for a moment éomer and aragorn halted before the gates. the thunder was rumbling in the distance now. the lightning flickered still, far off among the mountains in the south. a keen wind was blowing from the north again. the clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills of the coomb-side the westering moon rode, glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack.
'we did not come too soon,' said aragorn, looking at the gates. their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of their timbers were cracked.
'yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them,' said éomer. 'look!' he pointed to the causeway. already a great press of orcs and men were gathering again beyond the stream. arrows whined, and skipped on the stones about them. 'come! we must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and beam across the gates within. come now!'
they turned and ran. at that moment so

me dozen orcs that had lain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently and swiftly behind. two flung themselves to the ground at éomer's heels, tripped him, and in a moment they were on top of him. but a small dark figure that none had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: baruk khazâd! khazâd ai-mênu! an axe swung and swept back. two orcs fell headless. the rest fled.
éomer struggled to his feet, even as aragorn ran back to his aid.
the postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside with stones. when all were safe within, éomer turned: 'i thank you, gimli son of glóin!' he said. 'i did not know that you were with us in the sortie. but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. how came you there?'
'i followed you to shake off sleep,' said gimli; 'but i looked on the hillmen and they seemed over large for me, so i sat beside a stone to see your sword-play.'
'i shall not find

could cut them or fling them back. hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and orcs sprang up them like apes in the dark forests of the south. before the wall's foot the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on.
the men of rohan grew weary. all their arrows were spent, and every shaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields were riven. three times aragorn and éomer rallied them, and three times andúril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall.
then a clamour arose in the deep behind. orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall's top. then they sprang out. already some had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses, fight

ut i will help as i may.'
they gathered such small boulders and broken stones as they could find to hand, and under gimli's direction the westfold-men blocked up the inner end of the culvert, until only a narrow outlet remained. then the deeping-stream, swollen by the rain, churned and fretted in its choked path, and spread slowly in cold pools from cliff to cliff.
'it will be drier above,' said gimli. 'come, gamling, let us see how things go on the wall!'
he climbed up and found legolas beside aragorn and éomer. the elf was whetting his long knife. there was for a while a lull in the assault, since the attempt to break in through the culvert had been foiled.
'twenty-one!' said gimli.
'good!' said legolas. 'but my count is now two dozen. it has been knife-work up here.'
éomer and aragorn leant wearily on their swords. away on the left the crash and clamour of the battle on the rock rose loud again. but the hornburg still held fast, like an island in the sea. its gates lay in ruin; but over

the barricade of beams and stones within no enemy as yet had passed.
aragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley. 'this is a night as long as years,' he said. 'how long will the day tarry?'
'dawn is not far off,' said gamling, who had now climbed up beside him. 'but dawn will not help us, i fear.'
'yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said aragorn.
'but these creatures of isengard, these half-orcs and goblin-men that the foul craft of saruman has bred, they will not quail at the sun,' said gamling. 'and neither will the wild men of the hills. do you not hear their voices?'
'i hear them,' said éomer; 'but they are only the scream of birds and the bellowing of beasts to my ears.'
'yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue,' said gamling. 'i know that tongue. it is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valle

'nonetheless day will bring hope to me,' said aragorn. 'is it not said that no foe has ever taken the hornburg, if men defended it?'
'so the minstrels say,' said éomer.
'then let us defend it, and hope!' said aragorn.
even as they spoke there came a blare of trumpets. then there was a crash and a flash of flame and smoke. the waters of the deeping-stream poured out hissing and foaming: they were choked no longer, a gaping hole was blasted in the wall. a host of dark shapes poured in.
'devilry of saruman!' cried aragorn. 'they have crept in the cu

s he did so a hundred ladders were raised against the battlements. over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand. the defence was swept away. some of the riders were driven back, further and further into the deep, falling and fighting as they gave way, step by step, towards the caves. others cut their way back towards the citadel.
a broad stairway, climbed from the deep up to the rock and the rear-gate of the hornburg. near the bottom stood aragorn. in his hand still andúril gleamed, and the terror of the sword for a while held back the enemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate. behind on the upper steps knelt legolas. his bow was bent, but one gleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair.
'all who can have now got safe within, aragorn,' he called. 'come back!'
aragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stu

mbled in his weariness. at once his enemies leapt forward. up came the orcs, yelling, with their long arms stretched out to seize him. the foremost fell with legolas' last arrow in his throat. but the rest sprang over him. then a great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, and hurled them back into the deep. aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it clanged to behind him.
'things go ill, my friends,' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm.
'ill enough,' said legolas, 'but not yet hopeless, while we have you with us. where is gimli?'
'i do not know.' said aragorn. 'i last saw him fighting on the ground behind the wall, but the enemy swept us apart.'
'alas! that is evil news,' said legolas.
'he is stout and strong,' said aragorn. 'let us hope that he will escape back to the caves. there he would

be safe for a while. safer than we. such a refuge would be to the liking of a dwarf.'
'that must be my hope'' said legolas. 'but i wish that he had come this way. i desired to tell master gimli that my tale is now thirty-nine.'
'if he wins back to the caves, he will pass your count again,' laughed aragorn. 'never did i see an axe so wielded.'
'i must go and seek some arrows,' said legolas. 'would that this night would end, and i could have better light for shooting.'
aragorn now passed into the citadel. there to his dismay he learned that éomer had not reached the hornburg.
'nay, he did not come to the rock,' said one of the westfold-men, 'i last saw him gathering men about him and fighting in the mouth of the deep. gamling was with him, and the dwarf; but i could not come to them.'
aragorn strode on through the inner court, and mounted to a high chamber in the tower. there stood the king, dark against a narrow window, looking out upon the vale.
'what is the news,

 aragorn?' he said.
'the deeping wall is taken, lord, and all the defence swept away; but many have escaped hither to the rock.'
'is éomer here?'
'no, lord. but many of your men retreated into the deep; and some say that éomer was amongst them. in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves. what hope they may have then i do not know.'
'more than we. good provision, it is said. and the air is wholesome there because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above. none can

 force an entrance against determined men. they may hold out long.'
'but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc,' said aragorn. 'they have a blasting fire, and with it they took the wall. if they cannot come in the caves, they may seal up those that are inside. but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence.'
'i fret in this prison,' said théoden. 'if i could have set a spear in rest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe i could have felt again the joy of battle, and so ended. but i serve little purpose here.'
'here at least you are guarded in the strongest fastness of the mark,' said aragorn. 'more ho

rg has never fallen to assault,' said théoden; 'but now my heart is doubtful. the world changes, and all that once was strong now proves unsure. how shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless hate? had i known that the strength of isengard was grown so great, maybe l should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it, for all the arts of gandalf. his counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun.'
'do not judge the counsel of gandalf, until all is over, lord,' said aragorn.
'the end will not be long,' said the king. 'but i will not end here, taken like an old badger in a trap. snowmane and hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner court. when dawn comes, i will bid men sound helm's horn, and i will ride forth. will you ride with me then, son of arathorn? maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth a song-if any be left to sing of us hereafter.'
'i will ride with you,' said aragorn.
taking his leave, he returned to the walls, and p

assed round all their circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. legolas went with him. blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones. grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. again and again the orcs gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them down.
at last aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.
the orcs yelled and jeered. 'come down! come down!' they cried. 'if you wish to speak to us, come down! bring out your king! we are the fighting uruk-hai. we will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. bring out your skulking king!'
'the king stays or comes at his own will,' said aragorn.

'i looked out to see the dawn,' said aragorn.
'what of the dawn?' they jeered. 'we are the uruk-hai: we do not stop the fight for night or day, for fair weather or for storm. we come to kill, by sun or moon. what of the dawn?'
'none knows what the new day shall bring him,' said aragorn. 'get you gone, ere it turn to your evil.'
'get down or we will shoot you from the wall,' they cried. 'this is no parley. you have nothing to say.'
'i have still this to say,' answered aragorn. 'no enemy has yet taken the hornburg. depart, or not one of you will be spared. not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the north. you do not know your peril.'
so great a power and royalty was revealed in aragorn, as he stood there alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, t

hat many of the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and some looked up doubtfully at the sky. but the orcs laughed with loud voices; and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as aragorn leaped down.
there was a roar and a blast of fire. the archway of the gate above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust. the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. aragorn ran to the king's tower.
but even as the gate fell, and the orcs about it yelled, preparing to charge, a murmur arose behind them. like a wind in the distance, and it grew to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn. the orcs upon the rock, hearing the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. and then, sudden and terrible, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of helm rang out.
all that heard that sound trembled. many of the orcs cast themselves on their faces and

n blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood. but on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes did not die. ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free.
'helm! helm!' the riders shouted. 'helm is arisen and comes back to war. helm for théoden king!'
and with that shout the king came. his horse was white as snow, golden was his shield, and his spear was long. at his right hand was aragorn, elendil's heir, behind him rode the lords of the house of eorl the young. light sprang in the sky. night departed.
'forth eorlingas!' with a cry and a great noise they charged. down from the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through the hosts of isengard as a wind among grass. behind them from the deep came the stern cries of' men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. out poured all the men that were left upon the rock. and ever the sound of blowing hor

final doom approached.
there suddenly upon a ridge appeared a rider, clad in white, shining in the rising sun. over the low hills the horns were sounding. behind him, hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men on foot; their swords were in their hands. amid them strode a man tall and strong. his shield was red. as he came to the valley's brink, he set to his lips a great black horn and blew a ringing blast.
'erkenbrand!' the riders shouted. 'erkenbrand!'
'behold the white rider!' cried aragorn. 'gandalf is come again!'
'mithrandir, mithrandir!' said legolas. 'this is wizardry indeed! come! i would look on this forest, ere the spell changes.'
the hosts of isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from fear to fear. again the horn sounded from the tower. down through the breach of the dike charged the king's company. down from the hills leaped erkenbrand, lord of westfold. down leaped shadowfax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. the white rider was upon them,

ming filled the enemy with madness. the wild men fell on their faces before him. the orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever came again.

chapter 8

the road to isengard

so it was that in the light of a fair morning king théoden and gandalf the white rider met again upon the green grass beside the deeping-stream. there was also aragorn son of arathorn, and legolas the elf, and erkenbrand of westfold, and the lords of the golden house. about them were gathered the rohirrim, the riders of the mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes were turned towards the wood.
suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the dike came those who had been driven back into the deep. there came gamling the old, and éomer son of éomund, and beside them walked gimli the dwarf. he had no helm, and about his head was a linen ba

the king then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the mark; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste to edoras. there the lord of the mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the second day after the full moon. to ride with him to isengard the king chose éomer and twenty men of his household. with gandalf would go aragorn, and legolas, and gimli. in spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind.
'it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;' he said. 'it would take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.'
'i will tend it, while you rest,' said aragorn.
the king now returned to the hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company rested also. but the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fa

y, for the king was weary. they were come to the feet of the misty mountains, and the long arms of nan curunír stretched down to meet them. dark lay the vale before them, for the moon had passed into the west, and its light was hidden by the hills. but out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering billows, black and silver, over the starry sky.
'what do you think of that, gandalf?' asked aragorn. 'one would say that all the wizard's vale was burning.'
'there is ever a fume above that valley in these days,' said éomer: 'but i have never seen aught like this before. these are steams rather than smokes. saruman is brewing some devilry to greet us. maybe he is boiling all the waters of isen, and that is why the river runs dry.'
'maybe he is,' said gandalf. 'tomorrow we shall learn what he is doing. now let us rest for a while, if we can.'
they camped beside the bed of the isen river; it w

the hobbits bowed low. 'so that is the king of rohan!' said pippin in an undertone. 'a fine old fellow. very polite.'

chapter 9

flotsam and jetsam

gandalf and the king's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of isengard. but aragorn, gimli, and legolas remained behind. leaving arod and hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.
'well, well! the hunt is over, and we meet again at last, where none of us ever thought to come,' said aragorn.
'and now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters,' said legolas, 'the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles. we tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that i should like to know the truth of

'i lit a bit of fire,' said pippin. 'it cheered us up in the fogs. there were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. but there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. a fire is handy. i will make you some toast. the bread is three or four days old, i am afraid.'
aragorn and his companions sat themselves down at one end of a long table, and the hobbits disappeared through one of the inner doors. 'store-room in there, and above the woods, luckily,' said pippin, as they came back laden with dishes, bowls, cups, knives, and food of various sorts.
'and you need not turn up your nose at the provender, master gimli,' said merry. 'this is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as treebeard calls it. will you have wine or beer? there's a barrel inside there - very passable. and

busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, unabashed, set to a second time. 'we must keep our guests company,' they said.
'you are full of courtesy this morning,' laughed legolas. 'but maybe. if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again.'
'maybe; and why not?' said pippin. 'we had foul fare with the orcs, and little enough for days before that. it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'
'it does not seem to have done you any harm,' said aragorn. 'indeed you look in the bloom of health.'
'aye, you do indeed,' said gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'
'he has not,' said merry. 'but ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something s

'you have drunk of the waters of the ents, have you?' said legolas. 'ah, then i think it is likely that gimli's eyes do not deceive him. strange songs have been sung of the draughts of fangorn.'
'many strange tales have been told about that land,' said aragorn. 'i have never entered it. come, tell me more about it, and about the ents!'
'ents,' said pippin, 'ents are - well ents are all different for on thing. but their eyes now, their eyes are very odd.' he tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. 'oh, well,' he went on, 'you have seen some at a distance, already-they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way-and you will see many others, i expect, before you leave here. you must form your own ideas.'

'does that settle the score between us?' he said. 'settle it!' cried gimli. 'most noble hobbit, it leaves me deep in your debt.'
'well, i am going back into the open air, to see what the wind and sky are doing!' said legolas.
'we will come with you,' said aragorn.
they went out and seated themselves upon the piled stones before the gateway. they could see far down into the valley now; the mists were lifting and floating away upon the breeze.
'now let us take our ease here for a little!' said aragorn. 'we will sit on the edge of ruin and talk, as gandalf says, while he is busy elsewhere. i feel a weariness such as i have seldom felt before.' he wrapped his grey cloak about him, hiding his mail-shirt, and stretched out his long legs. then he lay back and

sent from his lips a thin stream of smoke.
'look!' said pippin. 'strider the ranger has come back!'
'he has never been away,' said aragorn. 'i am strider and dúnadan too, and i belong both to gondor and the north.'
they smoked in silence for a while, and the sun shone on them; slanting into the valley from among white clouds high in the west. legolas lay still, looking up at the sun and sky with steady eyes, and singing softly to himself. at last he sat up. 'come now!' he said. 'time wears on, and the mists are blowing away, or would if you strange folk did not wreathe yourselves in smoke. what of the tale?'

'only nine days ago!' he said.1 'it seems a year since we were caught. well, though half of it was like a bad dream, i reckon that three very horrible days followed. merry will correct me, if i forget anything important: i am not going into details: the whips and the filth and stench and all that; it does not bear remembering.' with that he plunged into an account of boromir's last fight and the orc-march from emyn muil to the forest. the others no

'and here also is your brooch, pippin,' said aragorn. 'i have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'

'nothing else,' answered aragorn. 'one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. you did rightly.'
'the cutting of the bands on your wrists, that was smart work!' said gimli. 'luck served you there; but you seized your chance with both hands, one might say.'
'and set us a pretty riddle,' said legolas. 'i wondered if you had grown wings!'
'unfortunately not,' said pippin. 'but you did not know about grishnákh.' he shuddered and said no more, leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, t

'all this about the orcs of barad-dûr, lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said aragorn. 'the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also; and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel. the red eye will be looking towards isengard. but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'
'yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,' said merry. 'things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan.'
'we caught a glimpse of the old villain, or so gandalf hints,' said gimli. 'on the edge of the forest.'

'when was that?' asked pippin.

'i thought of him too,' said aragorn. 'we had many of these half-orcs to deal with at helm's deep. it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy of saruman's; but whether he was working with the black riders, or for saruman alone, i do not know. it is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.'
'well, of all sorts together, there must have been ten thousand at the very least,' said merry. 'they took an hour to pass out of the gates. some went off down the highway to

'no,' said aragorn. 'once he was as great as his fame made him. his knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvellously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. the wise he could persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. that power he certainly still keeps. there are not many in middle-earth that i should say were safe, if they were left alone to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a defeat. gandalf, elrond, and galadriel, perhaps, now that his wickedness has been lai

'we saw a cloud of smoke and steam from the south last night when we came to the mouth of nan curunír,' said aragorn. 'we feared that saruman was brewing some new devilry for us.'
'not he!' said pippin. 'he was probably choking and not laughing any more. by the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. we took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had rather a fright. the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. we thought we were going to get caught like orcs in a hole; but we foun

'he was,' said aragorn; 'and also saruman's spy and servant in rohan. fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. the sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. but i fear that worse awaits him.'
'yes, i don't suppose treebeard sent him to orthanc out of kindness,' said merry. 'he seemed rather grimly delighted with the business and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. we spent a busy time after that, searching the flot

ows were cut with deep embrasures in the climbing walls: far up they peered like little eyes in the sheer faces of the horns.
at the foot of the stairs gandalf and the king dismounted. 'i will go up,' said gandalf. 'i have been in orthanc and i know my peril.'
'and i too will go up,' said the king. 'i am old, and fear no peril any more. i wish to speak with the enemy who has done me so much wrong. éomer shall come with me, and see that my aged feet do not falter.'
'as you will,' said gandalf. 'aragorn shall come with me. let the others await us at the foot of the stairs. they will hear and see enough, if there is anything to hear or see.'
'nay!' said gimli. 'legolas and i wish for a closer view. we alone here represent our kindred. we also will come behind.'

'the murderous rogue!' cried éomer. but gandalf was unmoved. no, that was not thrown b saruman, he said; nor even at his bidding, i think. it came from a window far above. a parting shot from master wormtongue, i fancy, but ill aimed.'
'the aim was poor, maybe, because he could not make up his mind which he hated more, you or saruman,' said aragorn.
'that may be so,' said gandalf. 'small comfort will those two have in their companionship: they will gnaw one another with words. but the punishment is just. if wormtongue ever comes out of orthanc alive, it will be more than he deserves.
'here, my lad, i'll take that! i did not ask you to handle it,' he cried, turning sharply and seeing pippin coming up the steps, slowly, as if he were bearing a great weight. he went down to meet him and hastily took the dark globe from the hobbit, wrapping i

a shrill shriek; suddenly cut off, came from an open window high above.
'it seems that saruman thinks so too,' said gandalf. 'let us leave them!'
they returned now to the ruins of the gate. hardly had they passed out under the arch, when, from among the shadows of the piled stones where they had stood, treebeard and a dozen other ents came striding up. aragorn, gimli and legolas gazed at them in wonder.
'here are three of my companions, treebeard,' said gandalf. 'i have spoken of them, but you have not yet seen them.' he named them one by one.
the old ent looked at them long and searchingly, and spoke to them in turn. last he turned to legolas. 'so you have come all the way from mirkwood, my good elf? a very great forest it used to be!'
'and still is,' said legolas. 'but not so great that we who dwell there ever tire of seeing new trees. i should dea

the palantír
the sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when gandalf and his companions, and the king with his riders, set out again from isengard. gandalf took merry behind him, and aragorn took pippin. two of the king's men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down into the valley. the others followed at an easy pace.
ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound. merry and pippin looked back, when they had passed some way down the winding road. sunlight was still shining in the sky, but long shadows reached over isengard: grey ruins falling into darkness. treebeard stood alone there now, like the

with that gandalf returned to the others, who were still standing by the orthanc-stone in troubled thought. 'peril comes in the night when least expected,' he said. 'we have had a narrow escape!'
'how is the hobbit, pippin?' asked aragorn.
'i think all will be well now,' answered gandalf. 'he was not held long, and hobbits have an amazing power of recovery. the memory, or the horror of it, will probably fade quickly. too quickly, perhaps. will you, aragorn, take the orthanc-stone and guard it? it is a dangerous charge.'
'dangerous indeed, but not to all,' said aragorn. 'there is one who may claim it by right. for this assuredly is the palantír of orthanc from the treasury of elendil, set here by the kings of gondor. now my hour

gandalf looked at aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he lifted the covered stone, and bowed as he presented it.
'receive it, lord!' he said: 'in earnest of other things that shall be given back. but if i may counsel you in the use of your own, do not use it - yet! be wary!'
'when have i been hasty or unwary, who have waited and prepared for so many long years?' said aragorn.
'never yet. do not then stumble at the end of the road,' answered gandalf. 'but at the least keep this thing secret. you, and all others that stand here! the hobbit, peregrin, above all should not know where it is bestowed. the evil fit may come on him again. for alas! he has handled it and looked in it, as should never have happened. he ought never to have touched it in isengard, and there i should have been quicker. but my mind was bent on saruman, and i did not at once guess the nature of t

'yes, there can be no doubt,' said aragorn. 'at last we know the link' between isengard and mordor, and how it worked. much is explained.' 'strange powers have our enemies, and strange weaknesses!' said théoden. 'but it has long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar.'
'that many times is seen,' said gandalf. 'but at this time we have been strangely fortunate. maybe, i have been saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder. i had considered whether or not to probe this stone myself to find its uses. had i done so, i should have been reve

aled to him myself. i am not ready for such a trial, if indeed i shall ever be so: but even if i found the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for him to see me, yet - until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.'
'that hour is now come, i think,' said aragorn.
'not yet,' said gandalf. 'there remains a short while of doubt which we must use. the enemy, it is clear, thought that the stone was in orthanc - why should he not? and that therefore the hobbit was captive there, driven to look in the glass for his torment by saruman. that dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before he learns his error. we must snatch that time. we have been too leisurely. we must move. the neighbourhoo

d of isengard is no place now to linger in. i will ride ahead at once with peregrin took. it will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep.'
'i will keep éomer and ten riders,' said the king. 'they shall ride with me at early day. the rest may go with aragorn and ride as soon as they have a mind.'
'as you will,' said gandalf. 'but make all the speed you may to the cover of the hills, to helm's deep!'
at that moment a shadow fell over them. the bright moonlight seemed to be suddenly cut off. several of the riders cried out, and crouched, holding their arms above their heads, as if to ward off a blow from above: a blind fear and a deadly cold fell on them. cowering they looked up. a vast winged shape passed over the moon like a black cloud. it wheeled

 and went north, flying at a speed greater than any wind of middle-earth. the stars fainted before it. it was gone.
they stood up, rigid as stones. gandalf was gazing up, his arms out and downwards, stiff, his hands clenched.
'nazgûl!' he cried. 'the messenger of mordor. the storm is coming. the nazgûl have crossed the river! ride, ride! wait not for the dawn! let not the swift wait for the slow! ride!'
he sprang away, calling shadowfax as he ran. aragorn followed him. going to pippin, gandalf picked him up in his arms. 'you shall come with me this time,' he said. 'shadowfax shall show you his paces.' then he ran to the place where he had slept. shadowfax stood there already. slinging the small bag which was all his luggage across his shoulders, the wizard leapt upon the horse's back. aragorn lifted pippin and set him in gandalf's arms, ,wrapped in cloak and blanket.
'farewell! follow fast!' cried gandalf. 'away, shadowfax!'

ed his head. his flowing tail flicked in the moonlight. then he leapt forward, spurning the earth, and was gone like the north wind from the mountains.
'a beautiful, restful night!' said merry to aragorn. 'some folk have wonderful luck. he did not want to sleep, and he wanted to ride with gandalf - and there he goes! instead of being turned into a stone himself to stand here for ever as a warning.'
'if you had been the first to lift the orthanc-stone, and not he, how would it be now?' said aragorn. 'you might have done worse. who can say? but now it is your luck to come with me, i fear. at once. go and get ready, and bring anything that pippin left behind. make haste!'
over the plains shadowfax was flying, needing no urging and no guidance. less than an hour had passed, and they had reached the fords of isen and crossed them. the mound of the riders and its cold spears lay grey behind them.
pippin was recovering. he was warm, but the wind in his face was keen and refreshing. he was with

, or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air. in that case let rohan look to its horses!
'but i cannot tell how it will fall out, well or ill for us. it may be that the counsels of the enemy will be confused, or hindered by his wrath with saruman. it may be that he will learn that i was there and stood upon the stairs of orthanc-with hobbits at my tail. or that an heir of elendil lives and stood beside me. if wormtongue was not deceived by the armour of rohan, he would remember aragorn and the title that he claimed. that is what i fear. and so we fly - not from danger but into greater danger. every stride of shadowfax bears you nearer to the land of shadow, peregrin took.'
pippin made no answer, but clutched his cloak, as if a sudden chill had struck him. grey land passed under them.

ed now; but perhaps not, perhaps not.'
`i don't like the sound of it at all,' said sam. `sounds too easy at any rate in the telling. if that path is still there, it'll be guarded too. wasn't it guarded, gollum? ' as he said this, he caught or fancied he caught a green gleam in gollum's eye. gollum muttered but did not reply.
'is it not guarded? ' asked frodo sternly. `and did you escape out of the darkness, sméagol? were you not rather permitted to depart upon an errand? that at least is w hat aragorn thought, who found you by the dead marshes some years ago.'
'it's a lie! ' hissed gollum, and an evil light came into his eyes at the naming of aragorn. `he lied on me, yes he did. i did escape, all by my poor self. indeed i was told to seek for the precious; and i have searched and searched, of course i have. but not for the black one. the precious was ours, it was mine i tell you. i did escape.'
frodo felt a strange certainty that in this matter gollum was for once not so far from the truth a

 for one thing, he noted that gollum used i, and that seemed usually to be a sign, on its rare appearances. that some remnants of old truth and sincerity were for the moment on top. but even if gollum could be trusted on this point, frodo did not forget the wiles of the enemy. the 'escape' may have been allowed or arranged, and well known in the dark tower. and in any case gollum was plainly keeping a good deal back.
'i ask you again,' he said: `is not this secret way guarded? '
but the name of aragorn had put gollum into a sullen mood. he had all the injured air of a liar suspected when for once he has told the truth. or part of it. he did not answer.
'is it not guarded? ' frodo repeated.
`yes, yes, perhaps. no safe places in this country,' said gollum sulkily. 'no safe places. but master must try it or go home. . no other way.' they could not get him to say more. the name of the perilous place and the high pass he could not tell, or would not.

umour. aragorn could perhaps have told them that name and its significance: gandalf would have warned them. but they were alone, and aragorn was far away, and gandalf stood amid the ruin of isengard and strove with saruman, delayed by treason. yet even as he spoke his last words to saruman, and the palantír crashed in fire upon the steps of orthanc. his thought was ever upon frodo and samwise, over the long leagues his mind sought for them in hope and pity.
maybe frodo felt it, not knowing it, as he had upon amon hen, even though he believed that gandalf was gone, gone for ever into the shadow in moria far away. he sat upon the gro

er my care for a while. but as for us, we are hobbits of the shire, far to the north and west, beyond many rivers. frodo son of drogo is my name, and with me is samwise son of hamfast, a worthy hobbit in my service. we have come by long ways - out of rivendell, or imladris as some call it.' here faramir started and grew intent. 'seven companions we had: one we lost at moria, the others we left at parth galen above rauros: two of my kin; a dwarf there was also, and an elf, and two men. they were aragorn; and boromir, who said that he came out of minas tirith, a city in the south.'
'boromir! ' all the four men exclaimed.
'boromir son of the lord denethor?' said faramir, and a strange stern look came into his face. 'you came with him? that is news indeed, if it be true. know, little strangers, that boromir son of denethor was high warden of the white tower, and our captain-general: sorely do we miss him. who are you then, and what had you to do with him? be swift, for the sun is climbing!'

in imladris it dwells.
'the words are known indeed,' said faramir in astonishment. `it is some token of your truth that you also know them.'
`aragorn whom i named is the bearer of the sword that was broken,' said frodo. 'and we are the halflings that the rhyme spoke of.'
`that i see,' said faramir thoughtfully. `or i see that it might be so. and what is isildur's bane? '
`that is hidden,' answered frodo. `doubtless it will be made clear in time.'
`we must learn more of this,' said faramir, `and know what brings you so far east under the shadow of yonder-,' he pointed and said no name. 'but not now. we have business in hand. you are in peril.

then to learn from you more of it; for what concerns boromir concerns me. an orc-arrow slew isildur, so far as old tales tell. but orc-arrows are plenty, and the sight of one would not be taken as a sign of doom by boromir of gondor. had you this thing in keeping? it is hidden, you say; but is not that because you choose to hide it? '
'no, not because i choose,' answered frodo. `it does not belong to me. it does not belong to any mortal, great or small; though if any could claim it, it would be aragorn son of arathorn, whom i named, the leader of our company from moria to rauros.'
'why so, and not boromir, prince of the city that the sons of elendil founded? '
'because aragorn is descended in direct lineage, father to father, from isildur elendil's son himself. and the sword that he bears was elendil's sword.'
a murmur of astonishment ran through all the ring of men. some cried aloud: 'the sword of elendil! the sword of elendil comes to minas tirith! great tidings! ' but faramir's face was un

moved.
`maybe,' he said. `but so great a claim will need to be established and clear proofs will be required, should this aragorn ever come to minas tirith. he had not come, nor any of your company, when i set out six days ago.'
'boromir was satisfied of that claim,' said frodo. `indeed, if boromir were here, he would answer all your questions. and since he was already at rauros many days back, and intended then to go straight to your city, if you return, you may soon learn the answers there. my part in the company was known to him, as to all the others. for it was appointed to me by elrond of imladris himself before the

i remember of boromir as a boy, when we together learned the tale of our sires and the history of our city, that always it displeased him that his father was not king. "how many hundreds of years needs it to make a steward a king, if the king returns not? " he asked. "few years, maybe, in other places of less royalty," my father answered. "in gondor ten thousand years would not suffice." alas! poor boromir. does that not tell you something of him? '
'it does,' said frodo. `yet always he treated aragorn with honour.'
'i doubt it not,' said faramir. `if he were satisfied of aragorn's claim as you say, he would greatly reverence him. but the pinch has not yet come. they had not yet reached minas tirith or become rivals in her wars.
`but i stray. we in the house of denethor know much ancient lore by long tradition, and there are moreover in our treasuries many things preserved: books and tablets writ on withered parchments, yea, and on stone, and on leaves of silver and of gold, in divers charact

d the matter away from the quest of the company and from the ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under caradhras, and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell. faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge.
`it must have irked boromir to run from orcs,' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the balrog - even though he was the last to leave.'
`he was the last,' said frodo, 'but aragorn was forced to lead us. he alone knew the way after gandalf's fall. but had there not been us lesser folk to care for, i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled.'
`maybe, it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir,' said faramir, `and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of rauros.'
'maybe. but tell me now of your own fortunes,' said frodo, turning the matter aside once again. `for i would learn more of minas ithil and osgiliath, and minas ti

rilous now for mortal man wilfully to seek out the elder people. yet i envy you that have spoken with the white lady.'
`the lady of lórien! galadriel!' cried sam. `you should see her indeed you should, sir. i am only a hobbit, and gardening's my job at home, sir, if you understand me, and i'm not much good at poetry - not at making it: a bit of a comic rhyme, perhaps. now and again, you know, but not real poetry - so i can't tell you what i mean. it ought to be sung. you'd have to get strider, aragorn that is, or old mr. bilbo, for that. but i wish i could make a song about her. beautiful she is, sir! lovely! sometimes like a great tree in flower, sometimes like a white daffadowndilly, small and slender like. hard as di'monds, soft as moonlight. warm as sunlight, cold as frost in the stars. proud and far-off as a snow-mountain, and as merry as any lass i ever saw with daisies in her hair in springtime. but that's a lot o' nonsense, and all wide of my mark.'

do! they're gone, and we'd better go too. there's something still alive in that place, something with eyes, or a seeing mind, if you take me; and the longer we stay in one spot, the sooner it will get on to us. come on, mr. frodo! '
frodo raised his head, and then stood up. despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. he even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether faramir or aragorn or elrond or galadriel or gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. he took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. when he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart. then turning from the city of morgul, now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward road.
gollum, it seemed, had crawled off along the ledge into the darkness beyond, when the gat
