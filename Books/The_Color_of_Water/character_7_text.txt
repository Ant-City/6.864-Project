r’s family had all the class and money. tateh, i
don’t know where his family was from. mameh was his meal
ticket to america, and once he got here, he was done with her.
he came here under the sponsorship of my mother’s eldest sis-
ter, laurie, and her husband, paul schiffman. you couldn’t
just walk into america. you had to have a sponsor, someone
who would say, “i’ll vouch for this person.” he came first and
after a few months sent for his family—me, mameh, and my
older brother, sam. i was two years old and sam was four
when  we  arrived,  so  i  don’t  remember  anything  about  our
long, perilous journey to america other than what i’ve seen in
the movies. i have a legal paper in the shoebox under my bed
that  says  i  arrived  here  on  august  23,  1923,  on  a  steamer

off the floor to see him. his beard lay flat on his chest and his
hands were folded. he had a little black tie on. he seemed
asleep. i remember saying to myself that he couldn’t possibly be
dead, because it seemed not too long before that he’d been alive
and joking and being silly and now here he was dead as a rock.
they buried him before sundown that day and we sat shiva

seasoned boxer slips punches. when malcolm x, the sup-
posed  demon  of  the  white  man,  was  killed,  i  asked  her
who  he  was  and  she  said,  “he  was  a  man  ahead  of  his
