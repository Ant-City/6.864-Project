[CHARACTER] - 
                unkempt
humanlike beasts who live in servitude to the houyhnhnms. [CHARACTER]
seem to belong to various ethnic groups, since there are blond [CHARACTER]
as well as dark-haired and redheaded ones. the men are characterized by
their hairy bodies, and the women by their low-hanging breasts.
they are naked, filthy, and extremely primitive in their eating
habits. [CHARACTER] are not capable of government, and thus they are
kept as servants to the houyhnhnms, pulling their carriages and
performing manual tasks. they repel gulliver with their lascivious sexual
appetites, especially when an eleven-year-old yahoo girl attempts
to rape gulliver as he is bathing naked. yet despite gulliver's
revulsion for these disgusting creatures, he ends his writings referring
to himself as a yahoo, just as the houyhnhnms do as they regretfully
evict him from their realm. thus, "yahoo" becomes another term for
human, at least in the semideranged and self-loathing mind of gulliver
at the end of his fourth journey.
