our host upon his stirrups stood anon,
and saide; "good men, hearken every one,

for we shall have a predication:
this lollard here will preachen us somewhat."
"nay, by my father's soul, that shall he not,

notes to the prologue to the shipman's tale


1. the prologue here given was transferred by tyrwhitt from
the place, preceding the squire's tale, which it had formerly
occupied; the shipman's tale having no prologue in the best
manuscripts.

2. lollard: a contemptuous name for the followers of
wyckliffe; presumably derived from the latin, "lolium," tares,
as if they were the tares among the lord's wheat; so, a few lines
below, the shipman intimates his fear lest the parson should
"spring cockle in our clean corn."

3. cockle: a weed, the "agrostemma githago" of linnaeus;
perhaps named from the anglo-saxon, "ceocan," because it
chokes the corn.
(transcriber's note: it is also possible chaucer had in mind
matthew 13:25, where in some translations, an enemy sowed
"cockle" amongst the wheat. (other translations have "tares"
and "darnel".))

the merchant saw none other remedy;
and for to chide, it were but a folly,
since that the thing might not amended be.
"now, wife," he said, "and i forgive it thee;
but by thy life be no more so large;*                   *liberal, lavish
keep better my good, this give i thee in charge."
thus endeth now my tale; and god us send
taling enough, until our lives' end!


notes to the shipman's tale


1. in this tale chaucer seems to have followed an old french
story, which also formed the groundwork of the first story in
the eighth day of the "decameron."

2. "he must us clothe": so in all the manuscripts and from this
and the following lines, it must be inferred that chaucer had
intended to put the tale in  the mouth of a female speaker.

3. dan: a title bestowed on priests and scholars; from
"dominus," like the spanish "don".

4. bruges was in chaucer's time the great emporium of

henry rebelled. he was by false pretences inveigled into his
brother's tent, and treacherously slain. mr wright has remarked
that "the cause of pedro, though he was no better than a cruel
and reckless tyrant, was popular in england from the very
circumstance that prince edward (the black prince) had
embarked in it."

29. not the oliver of charlemagne -- but a traitorous oliver of
armorica, corrupted by a bribe. ganilion was the betrayer of
the christian army at roncevalles (see note 9 to the shipman's
tale); and his name appears to have been for a long time used in
france to denote a traitor. duguesclin, who betrayed pedro into
his brother's tent, seems to be intended by the term "ganilion
oliver," but if so, chaucer has mistaken his name, which was
bertrand -- perhaps confounding him, as tyrwhttt suggests,
with oliver du clisson, another illustrious breton of those
times, who was also constable of france, after duguesclin. the
arms of the latter are supposed to be described a little above

onnected with the
word "cold" as, some forty lines below, it is applied to the
prejudicial counsel of women, and as frequently it is used to
describe "sighs" and other tokens of grief, and "cares" or
"anxieties."

23. undern:  in this case, the meaning of "evening" or
"afternoon" can hardly be applied to the word, which must be
taken to signify some early hour of the forenoon. see also note
4 to the wife of bath's tale and note 5 to the clerk's tale.

24. ganilion: a traitor.  see note 9 to the shipman's tale and
note 28 to the monk's tale.

25. greek sinon: the inventor of the trojan horse. see note 14
to the squire's tale

26. boult it from the bren: examine the matter thoroughly; a
metaphor taken from the sifting of meal, to divide the fine flour
from the bran.

27. thomas bradwardine, archbishop of canterbury in the
thirteenth century, who wrote a book, "de causa dei," in
controversy with pelagius; and also numerous other treatises,
among them some  on predestination.
