mur;--and as the fellow was well-beloved
in the regiment, and a handy fellow into the bargain, my uncle toby took
him for his servant; and of an excellent use was he, attending my uncle
toby in the camp and in his quarters as a valet, groom, barber, cook,
sempster, and nurse; and indeed, from first to last, waited upon him and
served him with great fidelity and affection.

my uncle toby loved the man in return, and what attached him more to him
still, was the similitude of their knowledge.--for corporal trim, (for
so, for the future, i shall call him) by four years occasional attention
to his master's discourse upon fortified towns, and the advantage of
prying and peeping continually into his master's plans, &c. exclusive
and besides what he gained hobby-horsically, as a body-servant, non
hobby horsical per se;--had become no mean proficient in the science;
and was thought, by the cook and chamber-maid, to know as much of the
nature of strong-holds as my uncle toby himself.

character,--and it is the only dark line in it.--the fellow loved to
advise,--or rather to hear himself talk; his carriage, however, was so
perfectly respectful, 'twas easy to keep him silent when you had him
so; but set his tongue a-going,--you had no hold of him--he was
voluble;--the eternal interlardings of your honour, with the
respectfulness of corporal trim's manner, interceding so strong
in behalf of his elocution,--that though you might have been
incommoded,--you could not well be angry. my uncle toby was seldom
either the one or the other with him,--or, at least, this fault, in
trim, broke no squares with them. my uncle toby, as i said, loved the
man;--and besides, as he ever looked upon a faithful servant,--but as an
humble friend,--he could not bear to stop his mouth.--such was corporal
trim.

toby--speak,--speak what thou thinkest upon the subject, man, without
fear.--why then, replied trim, (not hanging his ears and scratching his
head like a country-lout, but) stroking his hair back from his forehead,
and standing erect as before his division,--i think, quoth trim,
advancing his left, which was his lame leg, a little forwards,--and
pointing with his right hand open towards a map of dunkirk, which was
pinned against the hangings,--i think, quoth corporal trim, with humble
submission to your honour's better judgment,--that these ravelins,
bastions, curtins, and hornworks, make but a poor, contemptible,
fiddle-faddle piece of work of it here upon paper, compared to what your
honour and i could make of it were we in the country by ourselves, and
had but a rood, or a rood and a half of ground to do what we pleased
with: as summer is coming on, continued trim, your honour might sit
out of doors, and give me the nography--(call it ichnography, quoth my

 said my uncle toby.--whether they are gazons or
sods, is not much matter, replied trim; your honour knows they are ten
times beyond a facing either of brick or stone.--i know they are,
trim in some respects,--quoth my uncle toby, nodding his head;--for a
cannon-ball enters into the gazon right onwards, without bringing any
rubbish down with it, which might fill the fosse, (as was the case at
st. nicolas's gate) and facilitate the passage over it.

your honour understands these matters, replied corporal trim, better
than any officer in his majesty's service;--but would your honour please
to let the bespeaking of the table alone, and let us but go into the
country, i would work under your honour's directions like a horse,
and make fortifications for you something like a tansy, with all their
batteries, saps, ditches, and palisadoes, that it should be worth all
the world's riding twenty miles to go and see it.

my uncle toby blushed as red as scarlet as trim went on;--but it was not
a blush of guilt,

field, and demolish them town by town as fast as--trim, quoth my uncle

leg, quite overcome with rapture,--and thrusting a guinea into trim's
hand,--trim, said my uncle toby, say no more;--but go down, trim, this
moment, my lad, and bring up my supper this instant.

trim ran down and brought up his master's supper,--to no
purpose:--trim's plan of operation ran so in my uncle toby's head, he
could not taste it.--trim, quoth my uncle toby, get me to bed.--'twas
all one.--corporal trim's description had fired his imagination,--my
uncle toby could not shut his eyes.--the more he considered it, the more
bewitching the scene appeared to him;--so that, two full hours before
day-light, he had come to a final determination and had concerted the
whole plan of his and corporal trim's decampment.

my uncle toby had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village
where my father's estate lay at shandy, which had been left him by
an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hun

behind this house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about
half an acre, and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by
a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-green, containing just about as much
ground as corporal trim wished for;--so that as trim uttered the
words, 'a rood and a half of ground to do what they would with,'--this
identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and became curiously
painted all at once, upon the retina of my uncle toby's fancy;--which
was the physical cause of making him change colour, or at least of
heightening his blush, to that immoderate degree i spoke of.

from mortal sight, by rough holly and thick-set flowering shrubs:--so
that the idea of not being seen, did not a little contribute to the
idea of pleasure pre-conceived in my uncle toby's mind.--vain thought!
however thick it was planted about,--or private soever it might
seem,--to think, dear uncle toby, of enjoying a thing which took up a
whole rood and a half of ground,--and not have it known!

how my uncle toby and corporal trim managed this matter,--with the
history of their campaigns, which were no way barren of events,--may
make no uninteresting under-plot in the epitasis and working-up of this
drama.--at present the scene must drop,--and change for the parlour
fire-side.

obadiah has been going those said miles and back, i have brought my
uncle toby from namur, quite across all flanders, into england:--that
i have had him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since
travelled him and corporal trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near
two hundred miles down into yorkshire.--all which put together, must
have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of dr. slop upon
the stage,--as much, at least (i hope) as a dance, a song, or a concerto
between the acts.

chapter 1.xxxix.

at the end of the last chapter, my father and my uncle toby were left
both standing, like brutus and cassius, at the close of the scene,
making up their accounts.

as my father spoke the three last words,--he sat down;--my uncle toby
exactly followed his example, only, that before he took his chair, he
rung the bell, to order corporal trim, who was in waiting, to step
home for stevinus:--my uncle toby's house being no farther off than the
opposite side of the way.

some men would have dropped the subject of stevinus;--but my uncle toby
had no resentment in his heart, and he went on with the subject, to shew
my father that he had none.

your sudden appearance, dr. slop, quoth my uncle, resuming the
discourse, instantly brought stevinus into my head. (my father, you
may be sure, did not offer to lay any more wagers upon stevinus's

my father here had got into his element,--and was going on as
prosperously with his dissertation upon trade, as my uncle toby had
before, upon his of fortification;--but to the loss of much sound
knowledge, the destinies in the morning had decreed that no dissertation
of any kind should be spun by my father that day,--for as he opened his
mouth to begin the next sentence,

him.

remonstrate,--so taking the book to a side-table, and running over

i assure you, was the best scholar in my company, and should have had
the next halberd, but for the poor fellow's misfortune. corporal trim
laid his hand upon his heart, and made an humble bow to his master; then
laying down his hat upon the floor, and taking up the sermon in his
left hand, in order to have his right at liberty,--he advanced, nothing
doubting, into the middle of the room, where he could best see, and be
best seen by his audience.

what effect,--i leave the world to judge!

the necessity of this precise angle of 85 degrees and a half to a
mathematical exactness,--does it not shew us, by the way, how the arts
and sciences mutually befriend each other?

how the duce corporal trim, who knew not so much as an acute angle from
an obtuse one, came to hit it so exactly;--or whether it was chance or
nature, or good sense or imitation, &c. shall be commented upon in that
part of the cyclopaedia of arts and sciences, where the instrumental
parts of the eloquence of the senate, the pulpit, and the bar, the

so much for corporal trim's body and legs.--he held the sermon loosely,
not carelessly, in his left hand, raised something above his stomach,
and detached a little from his breast;--his right arm falling
negligently by his side, as nature and the laws of gravity ordered
it,--but with the palm of it open and turned towards his audience, ready
to aid the sentiment in case it stood in need.

corporal trim's eyes and the muscles of his face were in full harmony
with the other parts of him;--he looked frank,--unconstrained,-

something assured,--but not bordering upon assurance.

let not the critic ask how corporal trim could come by all this.--i've
told him it should be explained;--but so he stood before my father, my
uncle toby, and dr. slop,--so swayed his body, so contrasted his limbs,
and with such an oratorical sweep throughout the whole figure,--a
statuary might have modelled from it;--nay, i doubt whether the oldest
fellow of a college,--or the hebrew professor himself, could have much
mended it.

trim made a bow, and read as follows:

got a little vent,--read on,--and put this melancholy story out of thy
head:--i grieve that i interrupted thee; but prithee begin the sermon
again;--for if the first sentence in it is matter of abuse, as thou
sayest, i have a great desire to know what kind of provocation the
apostle has given.

corporal trim wiped his face, and returned his handkerchief into his
pocket, and, making a bow as he did it,--he began again.)

--for we trust we have a good conscience.--

'trust! trust we have a good conscience! surely if there is any thing in
this life which a man may depend upon, and to the knowledge of which he
is capable of arriving upon the most indisputable evidence, it must be
this very thing,--whether he has a good conscience or no.'

he has done;--perceives no penalty or forfeiture of goods and chattels

has got safely entrenched behind the letter of the law; sits there
invulnerable, fortified with cases and reports so strongly on all

we are in a condition to be of some service to mrs. shandy, to send up
stairs to know how she goes on.

i have ordered, answered my father, the old midwife to come down to us

father, with a perplexed kind of a smile upon his countenance, that by

misery in this life enow, but he must add voluntary ones to his stock of

from his heart for ever?

chapter 2.xv.

when corporal trim had brought his two mortars to bear, he was delighted
with his handy-work above measure; and knowing what a pleasure it would
be to his master to see them, he was not able to resist the desire he
had of carrying them directly into his parlour.

now next to the moral lesson i had in view in mentioning the affair of
hinges, i had a speculative consideration arising out of it, and it is
this.

had the parlour door opened and turn'd upon its hinges, as a door should

its hinges--(that is, in case things have all along gone well with your
worship,--otherwise i give up my simile)--in this case, i say, there had
been no danger either to master or man, in corporal trim's peeping in:
the moment he had beheld my father and my uncle toby fast asleep--the
respectfulness of his carriage was such, he would have retired as silent
as death, and left them both in their arm-chairs, dreaming as happy
as he had found them: but the thing was, morally speaking, so very
impracticable, that for the many years in which this hinge was suffered
to be out of order, and amongst the hourly grievances my father
submitted to upon its account--this was one; that he never folded his
a

 road which
led to it;--or to drop my metaphor (for there is nothing more dishonest
in an historian than the use of one)--in order to conceive the
probability of this error in my uncle toby aright, i must give you some
account of an adventure of trim's, though much against my will, i say
much against my will, only because the story, in one sense, is certainly
out of its place here; for by right it should come in, either amongst
the anecdotes of my uncle toby's amours with widow wadman, in which
corporal trim was no mean actor--or else in the middle of his and my
uncle toby's campaigns on the bowling-green--for it will do very well in
either place;--but then if i reserve it for either of those parts of my
story--i ruin the story i'm upon;--and if i tell it here--i anticipate
matters, and ruin it there.

--what would your worship have me to do in this case?

--tell it, mr. shandy, by all means.--you are a fool, tristram, if you
do.

least you set up a guide-post in the centre of them, in mere charity, to
direct an uncertain devil which of the three he is to take.



chapter 2.xvii.

tho' the shock my uncle toby received the year after the demolition of
dunkirk, in his affair with widow wadman, had fixed him in a resolution
never more to think of the sex--or of aught which belonged to it;--yet
corporal trim had made no such bargain with himself. indeed in my
uncle toby's case there was a strange and unaccountable concurrence of
circumstances, which insensibly drew him in, to lay siege to that fair
and strong citadel.--in trim's case there was a concurrence of nothing
in the world, but of him and bridget in the kitchen;--though in truth,
the love and veneration he bore his master was such, and so fond was he
of imitating him in all he did, that had my uncle toby employed his
time and genius in tagg

ing of points--i am persuaded the honest corporal
would have laid down his arms, and followed his example with pleasure.
when therefore my uncle toby sat down before the mistress--corporal trim
incontinently took ground before the maid.

now, my dear friend garrick, whom i have so much cause to esteem
and honour--(why, or wherefore, 'tis no matter)--can it escape your
penetration--i defy it--that so many play-wrights, and opificers of
chit-chat have ever since been working upon trim's and my uncle toby's
pattern.--i care not what aristotle, or pacuvius, or bossu, or
ricaboni say--(though i never read one of them)--there is not a greater
difference between a single-horse chair and mada

nd an amour thus nobly doubled, and going

silly affair of that kind--is quite lost in five acts--but that is
neither here nor there.

after a series of attacks and repulses in a course of nine months on my
uncle toby's quarter, a most minute account of every particular of which
shall be given in its proper place, my uncle toby, honest man! found
it necessary to draw off his forces and raise the siege somewhat
indignantly.

corporal trim, as i said, had made no such bargain either with
himself--or with any one else--the fidelity however of his heart not
suffering him to go into a house which his master had forsaken with
disgust--he contented himself with turning his part of the siege into a
blockade;--that is, he kept others off;--for though he never after went
to the house, yet he never met bridget in the village, but he
would either nod or wink, or smile, or look kindly at her--or (as
circumstances directed) he would shake he
 
 ___________________________
 
 at the siege of troy.--he would tell my uncle toby
of the catapultae of the syrians, which threw such monstrous stones
so many hundred feet, and shook the strongest bulwarks from their very
foundation:--he would go on and describe the wonderful mechanism of
the ballista which marcellinus makes so much rout about!--the terrible
effects of the pyraboli, which cast fire;--the danger of the terebra and
scorpio, which cast javelins.--but what are these, would he say, to the
destructive machinery of corporal trim?--believe me, brother toby, no
bridge, or bastion, or sally-port, that ever was constructed in this
world, can hold out against such artillery.

my uncle toby would never attempt any defence against the force of this
ridicule, but that of redoubling the vehemence of smoaking his pipe; in
doing which, he raised so dense a vapour one night after supper, that
it set my father, who was a little phthisical, into a suffocating fit of
violent coughing: my uncle toby leap'd up without feeling the pain

y took it of him in the field--convinced him, that if the king of
spain and the emperor went together by the ears, england and france and
holland must, by force of their pre-engagements, all enter the lists
too;--and if so, he would say, the combatants, brother toby, as sure
as we are alive, will fall to it again, pell-mell, upon the old
prize-fighting stage of flanders;--then what will you do with your
italian bridge?

--we will go on with it then upon the old model, cried my uncle toby.

when corporal trim had about half finished it in that style--my uncle
toby found out a capital defect in it, which he had never thoroughly
considered before. it turned, it seems, upon hinges at both ends of
it, opening in the middle, one half of which turning to one side of the
fosse, and the other to the other; the advantage of which was this,
that by dividing the weight of the bridge into two equal portions, it
impowered my uncle toby to raise it up or let it down with the end of
his crutch, and with one hand,

members which a common reader would imagine!

--for he spake in the sweetest modulation--and took down his hat with
the genteelest movement of limbs, that ever affliction harmonized and
attuned together.

speaking to obadiah, as soon as my father left the room.

head;--the reader remembers that he walked instantly up stairs, and cast
himself down upon his bed; and from hence, unless he has a great insight
into human nature, he will be apt to expect a rotation of the same
ascending and descending movements from him, upon this misfortune of my
name;--no.

you are to preach, yorick, you had better make the best of your way

our own rates.

now the chapter i was obliged to tear out, was the description of this
cavalcade, in which corporal trim and obadiah, upon two coach-horses
a-breast, led the way as slow as a patrole--whilst my uncle toby, in
his laced regimentals and tye-wig, kept his rank with my father, in deep
roads and dissertations alternately upon the advantage of learning and
arms, as each could get the start.

much above the stile and manner of any thing else i have been able
to paint in this book, that it could not have remained in it, without

thing, as soon as he had left the letter upon the table which brought
the news of my brother's death, so that before my father had well got

legs, to speak his sentiments upon the subject.

job's stock--though by the bye, your curious observers are seldom worth

haranguing over the same bier.

nile, without one.--your most obedient servant, madam--i've cost you a
great deal of trouble,--i wish it may answer;--but you have left a crack
in my back,--and here's a great piece fallen off here before,--and what

trim, by the help of his fore-finger, laid flat upon the table, and the
edge of his hand striking across it at right angles, made a shift to
tell his story so, that priests and virgins might have listened to
it;--and the story being told,--the dialogue went on as follows.



chapter 3.xxi.

--i would be picquetted to death, cried the corporal, as he concluded
susannah's story, before i would suffer the woman to come to any
harm,--'twas my fault, an' please your honour,--not her's.

corporal trim, replied my uncle toby, putting on his hat which lay upon
the table,--if any thing can be said to be a fault, when the service
absolutely requires it should be done,--'tis i certainly who deserve the
blame,--you obeyed your orders.

had count solmes, trim, done the same at the battle of steenkirk, said
yorick, drolling a little upon the corporal, who had been run over by
a dragoon in the retreat,--he had saved thee;--saved! cried trim,
interrupting yorick, and finishing the sentence for him aft

nd after a moment's pause, my uncle toby sinking his
voice a note,--resumed the discourse as follows.



chapter 3.xxii.

king william, said my uncle toby, addressing himself to yorick, was so
terribly provoked at count solmes for disobeying his orders, that he
would not suffer him to come into his presence for many months after.--i
fear, answered yorick, the squire will be as much provoked at the
corporal, as the king at the count.--but 'twould be singularly hard
in this case, continued be, if corporal trim, who has behaved so
diametrically opposite to count solmes, should have the fate to be
rewarded with the same disgrace:--too oft in this world, do things take
that train.--i would spring a mine, cried my uncle toby, rising up,--and
blow up my fortifications, and my house with them, and we would perish
under their ruins, ere i would stand by and see it.--trim directed a
slight,--but a grateful bow towards his master,--and so the chapter
ends.



chapter 3.xxiii.

--then, yorick, replied my uncle

he has repeated.--prithee, trim, quoth my father, turning round to
him,--what dost thou mean, by 'honouring thy father and mother?'

allowing them, an' please your honour, three halfpence a day out of my
pay, when they grow old.--and didst thou do that, trim? said yorick.--he
did indeed, replied my uncle toby.--then, trim, said yorick, springing
out of his chair, and taking the corporal by the hand, thou art the best
commentator upon that part of the decalogue; and i honour thee more for
it, corporal trim, than if thou hadst had a hand in the talmud itself.



chapter 3.xxxiii.

o blessed health! cried my father, making an exclamation, as he turned
over the leaves to the next chapter, thou art before all gold and
treasure; 'tis thou who enlargest the soul,--and openest all its powers
to receive instruction and to relish virtue.--he that has thee,
has little more to wish for;--and he that is so wretched as to want
thee,--wants every thing with thee.

 which had like to have killed both his honour and
myself; now there was no such thing, after the first ten days, continued
the corporal, for a soldier to lie dry in his tent, without cutting a
ditch round it, to draw off the water;--nor was that enough, for those
who could afford it, as his honour could, without setting fire every
night to a pewter dish full of brandy, which took off the damp of the
air, and made the inside of the tent as warm as a stove.--

and what conclusion dost thou draw, corporal trim, cried my father, from
all these premises?

i infer, an' please your worship, replied trim, that the radical
moisture is nothing in the world but ditch-water--and that the radical
heat, of those who can go to the expence of it, is burnt brandy,--the
radical heat and moisture of a private man, an' please your honour, is
nothing but ditch-water--and a dram of geneva--and give us but enough
of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and drive away the
vapours--we know not what it is to fea

the corporal, shutting the door.

my uncle toby filled his second pipe; and had it not been, that he now
and then wandered from the point, with considering whether it was not
full as well to have the curtain of the tennaile a straight line, as a
crooked one,--he might be said to have thought of nothing else but poor
le fever and his boy the whole time he smoaked it.



chapter 3.l.

the story of le fever continued.

it was not till my uncle toby had knocked the ashes out of his third
pipe, that corporal trim returned from the inn, and gave him the
following account.

i despaired, at first, said the corporal, of being able to bring
back your honour any kind of intelligence concerning the poor sick
lieutenant--is he in the army, then? said my uncle toby--he is, said
the corporal--and in what regiment? said my uncle toby--i'll tell your
honour, replied the corporal, every thing straight forwards, as i learnt
it.--then, trim, i'll fill another pipe, said my uncle toby, and not
interrupt thee till thou

take possession of the spot of ground we have so often
spoke of, in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the
allies; that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the
whole affair, it was neither a pioneer's spade, a pickax, or a shovel--

--it was a bed to lie on: so that as shandy-hall was at that time
unfurnished; and the little inn where poor le fever died, not yet built;
my uncle toby was constrained to accept of a bed at mrs. wadman's, for
a night or two, till corporal trim (who to the character of an excellent
valet, groom, cook, sempster, surgeon, and engineer, super-added that of
an excellent upholsterer too), with the help of a carpenter and a couple
of taylors, constructed one in my uncle toby's house.

nd to do him justice, when he was
once there, he would defend it so gallantly, that 'twould have been a
concern, either to a brave man or a good-natured one, to have seen him
driven out.

yorick, for this reason, though he would often attack him--yet could
never bear to do it with all his force.

doctor slop's virginity, in the close of the last chapter, had got him
for once on the right side of the rampart; and he was beginning to blow
up all the convents in christendom about slop's ears, when corporal trim
came into the parlour to inform my uncle toby, that his thin scarlet
breeches, in which the attack was to be made upon mrs. wadman, would not
do; for that the taylor, in ripping them up, in order to turn them, had
found they had been turn'd before--then turn them again, brother, said
my father, rapidly, for there will be many a turning of 'em yet
before all's done in the affair--they are as rotten as dirt, said
the corporal--then by all means, said my father, bespeak a new pair,
brother--for th
