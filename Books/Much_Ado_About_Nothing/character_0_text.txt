three leagues off when i left him

   leon. how many gentlemen haue you lost in this
action?
  mess. but few of any sort, and none of name

   leon. a victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer
brings home full numbers: i finde heere, that don peter
hath bestowed much honor on a yong florentine, called
claudio

no beard, is lesse then a man: and hee that is more then a

not for him: therefore i will euen take sixepence in earnest

when i doe name him, let it be thy part,
to praise him more then euer man did merit,
my talke to thee must be how benedicke

of prowder stuffe then that of beatrice:
