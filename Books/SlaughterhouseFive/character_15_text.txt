ilium, and the electric blanket was turned up high. he was drenched in sweat,
remembered groggily that his daughter had put him to bed, had told him to stay there
until the oil burner was repaired.
 somebody was knocking on his bedroom door.
 'yes?' said billy.
 'oil-burner man.'
 'yes?'
 'itâ€™s running good now. heat's coming up.'
 'good.'
 'mouse ate through a wire from the thermostat'
 'i'll be darned.'
 billy sniffed. his hot bed smelled like a mushroom cellar. he had had a wet dream
about montana wildhack.
 on the morning after that wet dream, billy decided to go back to work in his office in
the shopping plaza. business was booming as usual. his assistants were keeping up with
it nicely. they were startled to see him. they had been told by his daughter that he might
never practice again.
 but billy went into his examining room briskly, asked that the first patient be sent in.
so they sent him one-a twelve-year old boy who was accompanied by his-widowed
mother. they were strangers, new in town.

en was like the moon now nothing but minerals. the stones were hot.
everybody else in the neighborhood was dead.
 so it goes.
 the guards drew together instinctively, rolled their eyes. they experimented with one
expression and then another, said nothing, though their mouths were often open. they
looked like a silent film of a barbershop quartet.
 'so long forever,' they might have been singing, 'old fellows and pals; so long forever,
old sweethearts and pals-god bless 'em-'
 'tell me a story,' montana wildhack said to billy pilgrim in the tralfamadorian zoo
one time. they were in bed side by side. they had privacy. the canopy covered the
dome. montana was six months pregnant now, big and rosy, lazily demanding small
favors from billy from time to time. she couldn't send billy out for ice cream or
strawberries, since the atmosphere outside the dome was cyanide, and the nearest
strawberries and ice cream were millions of light years away.
 she could send him to the refrigerator, which was decorated wit

these. so he was startled when he saw what
billy's book was. he said, 'jesus christ, where did you find this thing?' and so on, and he
had to tell the other clerks about the pervert who wanted to buy the window dressing. the
other clerks already knew about billy. they had been watching him, too.
 the cash register where billy waited for his change was near a bin of old girly
magazines. billy looked at one out of the corner of his eye, and he saw this question on
its cover: what really became of montana wildhack?
 so billy read it. he knew where montana wildhack really was, of course. she was
back on tralfamadore, taking care of the baby, but the magazine, which was called
midnight pussycats, promised that she was wearing a cement overcoat under fathoms of
saltwater in san pedro bay.
 so it goes.
 billy wanted to laugh. the magazine., which was published for lonesome men to jerk
off to, ran the story so it could print pictures taken from blue movies which montana had
made as a teenagers billy did not l

ook closely at these. they were grainy things, soot and
chalk. they could have been anybody.
 billy was again directed to the back of the store and he went this time. a jaded sailor
stepped away from a movie machine while the film was still running. billy looked in, and
there was montana wildhack alone on a bed, peeling a banana. the picture clicked off.
billy did not want to see what happened next, and a clerk importuned him to come over
and see some really hot stuff they kept under the counter for connoisseurs.
 billy was mildly curious as to what could possibly have been kept hidden in such a
place. the clerk leered and showed him. it was a photograph of a woman and a shetland
pony. they were attempting to have sexual intercourse between two doric columns, in
front of velvet draperie

en. the master of ceremonies asked
people to say what they thought the function of the novel might be in modern society, and
one critic said, 'to provide touches of color in rooms with all-white wars.' another one
said, 'to describe blow-jobs artistically.' another one said, 'to teach wives of junior
executives what to buy next and how to act in a french restaurant.'
 and then billy was allowed to speak. off he went, in that beautifully trained voice of
his, telling about the flying saucers and montana wildhack and so on.
 he was gently expelled from the studio during a commercial. he went back to his hotel
room, put a quarter into the magic fingers machine connected to his bed, and he went to
sleep. he traveled in time back to tralfamadore.
 'time-traveling again?' said montana. it was artificial evening in the dome. she was
breast-feeding their child.
 'hmm?' said billy.
 'you've been time-traveling again. i can always tell.'
 'um.'
 'where did you go this time? it wasn't the war. i can tell that, t

er who was shot. he made a blue movie with a
firing squad.' she moved the baby from one breast to the other, because the moment was
so structured that she had to do so.
 there was a silence.
 'they're playing with the clocks again,' said montana, rising, preparing to put the baby
into its crib. she meant that their keepers were making the electric clocks in the dome go
fast, then slow, then fast again., and watching the little earthling family through
peepholes.
 there was a silver chain around montana wildhack's neck. hanging from it, between
her breasts, was a locket containing a photograph of her alcoholic mother-grainy thing,
soot and chalk. it could have been anybody. engraved on the outside of the locket were
these words:
god grant me the serenity
to accept the things i
cannot change, courage
to change the things
i can, and wisdom
always to tell the
difference.
