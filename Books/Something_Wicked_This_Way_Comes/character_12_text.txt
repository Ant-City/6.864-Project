m! will!'
here came miss foley, their seventh-grade schoolteacher, along the midway, all smiles.
'boys,' she said, 'what's wrong? you look as if you lost something.'
'well,' said will, 'last night, did you hear that calliope - '
'calliope? no - '
'then why're you out here so early, miss foley?' asked jim.
'i love carnivals.' said miss foley, a little woman lost somewhere in her grey fifties, beaming
around. 'i'll buy hot dogs and you eat while i look for my fool nephew.you seen him?'
'nephew?'
'robert.staying with me a few-weeks. father's dead, mother's sick in wisconsin. i took him
in. he ran out here early today.said he'd meet me.but you know boys! my, you look glum.' she
shoved food at them. 'eat! cheer up! rides'll open in ten minutes. meantime, i think i'll spy
through that mirror maze and - '
'no,' said will.
'no what?' asked miss foley.
'no mirror maze.' will swallowed. he stared at fathoms of reflections.you could never strike
bottom there. it was like winter standing tall, waiting t

o kill you with a glance. 'miss foley,' he
said at last, and wondered to hear his mouth say it, 'don't go in there.'
'why not?'
jim peered, fascinated, into will's face. 'yeah, tell us. why not?'
'people get lost,' said will, lamely.
'all the more reason. robert might be wandering, loose, and not find his way out if i don't
grab his ear - '
'never can tell - ' will could not take his eyes off the millions of miles of blind grass - 'what
might be s around in there…'
'swimming!' miss foley laughed. 'what a lovely mind you have, willy. well, yes, but i'm an old
fish.so…'
'miss foley!'
miss foley waved, poised, took a step, and vanished into the mirror ocean. they watched as
she settled, wandered, sank deep, deep, and was finally dissolved, grey among

will flushed. 'all those darn carnival mirrors - '
'nonsense, i've forgotten all about it. well, boys, are you coming in?
she held the door wide.
will shuffled a foot and stopped.
beyond miss foley, a beaded curtain hung like a dark blue thunder shower across the parlour
entry.
where the coloured rain touched the floor, a pair of dusty small shoes poked out. just
beyond the downpour the evil boy loitered.
evil? will blinked. why evil? because. 'because' was reason enough.a boy, yes, and evil.
'robert?' miss foley turned, calling through the dark blue always-falling beads of rain.she
took will's hand and gently pulled him inside. 'come meet two of my students.'
the rain poured aside.a fresh candy-pink hand broke through, all by itself, as if testing the
weather in the hall.
good grief, thought will, he'll look me in the eye! see the merry-go-round and himself on it
moving back, back. i know it's printed on my eyeball like i been struck by lightning!
'miss foley!' said will.
now a pink face s

uite suddenly, clearly he saw the sign in the barber's window. the sign seen but not seen
as they ran by:
closed on account of illness.
'mr crosetti!' he repeated, and added swiftly. 'he's…dead!'
'what…the barber?'
'the barber?' echoed jim.
'see this haircut?' will turned, trembling, his hand to his head. 'he did it.and we just walked
by there and the sign was up and people told us - '
'what a shame.' miss foley was reaching out to fetch the strange boy forward: 'i'm so sorry.
boys, this is robert, my nephew from wisconsin.'
jim stuck out his hand. robert the nephew examined it, curiously. 'what are you looking at?'
he asked.
'you look familiar,' said jim.
jim! will yelled to himself.
'like an uncle of mine,' said jim, all sweet and calm.
the nephew flicked his eyes to will, who looked only at the floor, afraid the boy would see his
eyeballs whirl with the remembered carousel. crazily, he wanted to hum the backward music.
now, he thought, face him!
he looked up straight at the boy.
and i

hind those trim white candy-kernel teeth.
mr cooger, somewhere behind the eye-slits, went blink-click with his insect-kodak pupils.
the lenses exploded like suns, then burnt chilly and serene again.
he swivelled his glance to jim.blink-click. he had jim flexed, focused, shot, developed, dried,
filed away in the dark.blink-click.
yet this was only a boy standing in a hall with two other boys and a women…
and all the while jim gazed steadily, back, feathers unruffled, taking his own pictures of
robert.
'have you boys had supper?', asked miss foley. 'we're just sitting down - '
'we got to go!'
everyone looked at will as if amazed he didn't want to stick here forever.
'jim - ' he stammered. 'your mom's home alone - '
'oh, sure,' jim said,reluctantly.
'i know what.' the nephew paused for their attention. when their faces turned, mr cooger
inside the nephew went silently blink-click, blink-click, listening through the toy ears, watching
through the toy-charm eyes, whetting the doll's mouth with

a pekingese tongue. 'join us later
for dessert, huh?'
'dessert?'
'i'm taking aunt willa to the carnival.' the boy stroked miss foley's arm until she laughed
nervously.
'carnival?' cried will, and lowered his voice. 'miss foley, you said - '
'i said i was foolish and scared myself,' said miss foley. 'it's saturday night the best night for
tent shows and showing my nephew the sights.'
'join us?' asked robert, holding miss foley's hand. 'later?'
'great!' said jim.
'jim.' said will. 'we been out all day.your mom's sick.'
'i forgot.' jim, flashed him a look filled with purest snake-poison.
flick. the nephew made an x-ray of both, showing them, no doubt, as cold bones trembling
in warm flesh. he stuck out his hand.
'tomorrow, then. meet you by the side-shows.'
'swell!' jim grabbed the small hand.
'so long!' will jumped out the door, then turned with a last agonized appeal to the teacher.
'miss foley…

oung, me scared!
will hauled off and hit jim, hard, on the nose.
then he jumped jim, wrapped him tight, and toppled him rolling down, yelling, in the bushes.
he slapped jim's mouth, stuffed it, mashed it full of fingers to snap and bite at, suffocating the
angry grunts and yells.
the front door opened.
will crushed the air out of jim, lay heavy on him, fisting his mouth tight.
something stood on the porch.a tiny shadow scanned the town, searching for but not
finding jim.
but it was just the boy robert, the friendly nephew, come almost casually forth, hands in
pockets, whistling under his breath, to breathe the night air as boys do, curious for adventures
that they themselves must make, that rarely happen by. threshed tight, mortally locked and
bound to jim, staring up, will was all the more shaken to see the normal boy, the airy glance,
the unassuming poise, the small, the easy self in which no man at all was revealed by street
light.
at any moment, robert, in full cry, might leap to play wi

 run upstairs, scrabbled about, and hurtled down
again, for suddenly as the two boys out-thrashed out-gripped, outraged each other, there was
a rain of tinkling,rattling glitter on the lawn.
the nephew leaped the porch rail and landed panther-soft, imbedded in his shadow, on the
grass. his hands were delicious with stars. these he liberally sprinkled. they thudded, slithered,
winked at jim's side.both boys lay stricken by the rain of gold and diamond fire that pelted
them.
'help, police!' cried robert.
will was so shocked he let go jim.
jim was so shocked he let go will.
both reached at the same time for the cold strewn ice.
'good grief, a bracelet!'
'a ring! a necklace!'
robert kicked. two trash cans at the curb fell thundering.
a bedroom light, above, flicked on.
'police!' robert threw one last spray of glitter at their feet, shut up his fresh-peach smile like
locking an explosion away in a box, and shot away down the street.
'wait!' jim jumped. 'we won't hurt you!'
will tripped him, jim f
