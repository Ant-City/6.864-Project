"what do you know about the foundation?" morris said.
grant shrugged. "the hammond foundation is a respected source of academic grants. they
fund research all over the world, including several dinosaur researchers. i know they support bob
kerry out of the tyrrell in alberta, and john weller in alaska. probably more."
"do you know why the hammond foundation supports so much dinosaur research?" morris
asked.
"of course. it's because old john hammond is a dinosaur nut."
"you've met hammond?"
grant shrugged. "once or twice. he comes here for brief visits. he's quite elderly, you know.
and eccentric, the way rich people sometimes are. but always very enthusiastic. why?"
"well," morris said, "the hammond foundation is actually a rather mysterious organization." he
pulled out a xeroxed world map, marked with red dots, and passed it to grant. "these are the
digs the foundation financed last year. notice anything odd about them? montana, alaska,

twelve thousand. that must have been about the middle of '85."
morris made a note. "and ingen? any other contact with them?"
"not since 1985."
"and when did the hammond foundation begin to fund your research?"
"i'd have to look," grant said. "but it was around then. mid-eighties."
"and you know hammond as just a rich dinosaur enthusiast."
"yes." 
morris made another note.
"look," grant said. "if the epa is so concerned about john hammond and what he's doing-the
dinosaur sites in the north, the amber purchases, the island in costa rica-why don't you 'ust ask
him about it?"
"at the moment, we can't," morris said. "why not?" grant said.
"because we don't have any evidence of wrongdoing," morris said. "but personally, i think it's
clear john hammond is evading the law."
"i was first contacted," morris explained, "by the office of technology transfer. the ott

. that'd be something to see. how big were they?"
"about so," grant said, holding his hands six inches apart. "squirrelsize."
"and how long before they become full-grown?"
"three years," grant said. "give or take."
morris held out his band. "well, thanks again for your help."
"take it easy driving back," grant said. he watched for a moment as morris walked back
toward his car, and then closed the trailer door.
grant said, "what did you think?"
ellie shrugged. "naâ€¹ve."
"you like the part where john hammond is the evil arch-villain?" grant laughed. "john
hammond's about as sinister as walt disney. by the way, who called?"
"oh," ellie said, "it was a woman named alice levin. she works at columbia medical center.
you know her?"
grant shook his head. "no."
"well, it was something about identifying some remains. she wants you to call her back right
away."

"and what does hammond say?"
"he insists nothing is wrong on the island. claims he has all these security precautions."
"but you don't believe him," ross said.
"no," gennaro said. "i don't."
donald gennaro had come to cowan, swain from a background in investment banking.
cowan, swain's high-tech clients frequently needed capitalization, and gennaro helped them find
the money. one of his first assignments, back in 1982, had been to accompany john hammond
while the old man, then nearly seventy, put together the funding to start the ingen corporation.
they eventually raised almost a billion dollars, and gcnnaro remembered it as a wild ride.
"hammond's a dreamer," gennaro said.
"a potentially dangerous dreamer," ross said. "we should never have gotten involved. what is
our financial position?"
"the firm," gennaro said, "owns five percent."
"general or limited?"
"general."
ross shook his head. "we should never have done that."

"all right," ross said. "but just make sure it happens. stay on top of it. i want this costa rican
situation resolved within a week." ross got up, and walked out of the room.
gennaro dialed, heard the whining hiss of a radiophone. then he heard a voice say, "grant
here."
"hi, dr. grant, this is donald gennaro. i'm the general counsel for ingen. we talked a few
years back, i don't know if you remember-"
"i remember," grant said.
"well," gennaro said. "i just got off the phone with john hammond, who tells me the good
news that you're coming down to our island in costa rica. . . ."
"yes," grant said. "i guess we're going down there tomorrow."
"well, i just want to extend my thanks to you for doing this on short notice. everybody at ingen
appreciates it. we've asked fan malcolm, who like you was one of the early consultants, to come
down as well. he's the mathematician at ut in austin?"
"john hammond mentioned that," grant said.
"well, good," gennaro said. "and i'll be coming, too, as a

the sleek grumman jet circled for a landing.
"i hate to wait on the money men," grant grumbled.
ellie shrugged."goes with the job."
although many fields of science, such as physics and chemistry, had become federally funded,
paleontology remained strongly dependent on private patrons. quite apart from his own curiosity
about the island in costa rica, grant understood that, if john hammond asked for his help, he
would give it. that was how patronage worked-how it had always worked.
the little jet landed and rolled quickly toward them. ellie shouldered her bag. the iet came to a
stop and a stewardess in a blue uniform opened the door.
inside, he was surprised at how cramped it was, despite the luxurious appointments. grant
had to hunch over as he went to shake hammond's hand.
"dr. grant and dr. sattler," hammond said. "it's good of you to join us. allow me to introduce

version 4.4
"was there any problem with the group?" hammond asked.
"no," henry wu said, "there was no problem at all."
"they accepted your explanation?"
"why shouldn't they?" wu said. "it's all quite straightforward, in the broad strokes. it's only the
details that get sticky. and i wanted to talk about the details with you today. you can think of it as
a matter of aesthetics."
john hammond wrinkled his nose, as if he smelled something disagreeable. "aesthetics?" he
repeated.
they were standing in the living room of hammond's elegant bungalow, set back among palm
trees in the northern sector of the park. the living room was airy and comfortable, fitted with a
half-dozen video monitors showing the animals in the park. the file wu had brought, stamped
animal development: version 4.4, lay on the coffee table.

m any more.
there had been a time when hammond listened to wu very attentively. especially when he had
first recruited him, back in the days when henry wu was a twenty-eight-year-old graduate
student getting his doctorate at stanford in norman atherton's tab.
atherton's death had thrown the lab into confusion as well as mourning; no one knew what
would happen to the funding or the doctoral programs. there was a lot of uncertainty; people
worried about their careers.
two weeks after the funeral, john hammond came to see wu. everyone in the lab knew that
atherton had had some association with hammond, although the details were never clear. but
hammond had approached wu with a directness wu never forgot.
"norman always said you're the best geneticist in his lab," he said. "what are your plans now?"
"i don't know. research."
"you want a university appointment?"
"yes."
"that's a mistake," hammond said briskly. "at least, if you respect your talent."
wu had blinked. "why?"
"because, let's face facts," h

can't squander precious time with forms and committees. life is too short, and dna too long. you
want to make your mark. if you want to get something done, stay out of universities."
in those days, wu desperately wanted to make his mark. john hammond had his full attention.
"i'm talking about work, " hammond continued. "real accomplishment. what does a scientist
need to work? he needs time, and he needs money. i'm talking about giving you a five-year
commitment, and ten million dollars a year in funding. fifty million dollars, and no one tells you
how to spend it. you decide. everyone else just gets out of your way."
it sounded too good to be true. wu was silent for a long time. finally he said, "in return for
what?"

relished. it wasn't what he had bargained for.
still, he had succeeded. he had done what nobody really believed could be done, at least in so
short a time. and henry wu thought that he should have some rights, some say in what
happened, by virtue of his expertise and his efforts. instead, he found his influence waning with
each passing day. the dinosaurs existed. the procedures for obtaining them were worked out to
the point of being routine. the technologies were mature. and john hammond didn't need henry
wu any more.
"that should be fine," hammond said, speaking into the phone. he listened for a while, and
smiled at wu. "fine. yes. fine." he hung up. "where were we, henry?"
"we were talking about phase two," wu said.
"oh yes. we've gone over some of this before, henry-"
"i know, but you don't realize-"
"excuse me, henry," hammond said, with an edge of impatience in his voice. "i do realize. and
i must tell you frankly, henry. i see no reason to improve upon reality. every chan

e dinner had been excellent, considering the dining
room wasn't fully staffed yet.
but there was something about hammond that wu found troubling. the old man was different in
some way . . . subtly different. all during dinner, wu had tried to decide what it was. in part, a
tendency to ramble, to repeat himself, to retell old stories. in part, it was an emotional lability,
flaring anger one moment, maudlin sentimentality the next. but all that could be understood as a
natural concomitant of age. john hammond was, after all, almost seventy-seven.
but there was something else. a stubborn evasiveness. an insistence on having his way. and, in
the end, a complete refusal to deal with the situation that now faced the park.
wu had been stunned by the evidence (he did not yet allow himself to believe the case was
proved) that the dinosaurs were breeding. after grant had asked about amphibian dna, wu had
intended to go directly to his laboratory and check the computer records of the various dna
assemblies.

and turned the car around. "i just wish i understood what the urgency is."
harding put the jeep in gear, and they rumbled down the road in the darkness. it was another
ten minutes before they saw the welcoming lights of the safari lodge. and as harding pulled to a
stop in front of the visitor center, they saw muldoon coming toward them. he was shouting, and
waving his arms.
"god damn it, arnold, you son of a bitch! god damn it, get this park back on track! now! get my
grandkids back here! now!" john hammond stood in the control room, screaming and stamping
his little feet. he had been carrying on this way for the last two minutes, while henry wu stood in
the corner, looking stunned.
"well, mr. hammond," arnold said, "muldoon's on his way out right now, to do exactly that."
arnold turned away, and lit another cigarette. hammond was like every other management guy
arnold had ever seen. whether it was disney or the navy, management guys always behaved

theory that's been used to study everything from the stock market, to rioting crowds, to brain
waves during epilepsy. a very fashionable theory. very trendy to apply it to any complex system
where there might be unpredictability. okay?"
"okay," gennaro said.
"ian malcolm is a mathematician specializing in chaos theory. quite amusing and personable,
but basically what he does, besides wear black, is use computers to model the behavior of
complex systems. and john hammond loves the latest scientific fad, so he asked malcolm to
model the system at jurassic park. which malcolm did. malcolm's models are all phase-space
shapes on a computer screen. have you seen them?"
"no," gennaro said.
"well, they look like a weird twisted ship's propeller. according to malcolm, the behavior of any
system follows the surface of the propeller. you with me?"
"not exactly," gennaro said.

"what happened to him?" gennaro said, alarmed.
ellie stepped forward and leaned close to the hole, listening at the opening. she clicked the
radio, said softly, "alan?"
there was a long silence. then they heard faintly: "i'm here."
"is everything all right, alan?"
another long silence. when grant finally spoke, his voice sounded distinctly odd, almost
awestruck.
"everything's fine," he said.

in the lodge, john hammond paced back and forth in malcolm's room. hammond was impatient
and uncomfortable. since marshaling the effort for his last outburst, malcolm had slipped into a
coma, and now it appeared to hammond that he might actually die. of course a helicopter had
been sent for, but god knows when it would arrive. the thought that malcolm might die in the
meantime filled hammond with anxiety and dread.
and, paradoxically, hammond found it all much worse because he disliked the mathematician
so much. it was w

gennaro watched them and said, "why don't they go outside?"
"they're nocturnal,"
"yes, but it almost seems like they're hiding."
grant shrugged. in the next moment, the infants began to squeak and hop excitedly. the
adults watched curiously for a moment. and then, with hoots and cries that echoed in the dark
cavernous space, all the dinosaurs wheeled and ran, heading down the concrete tunnel, into the
darkness beyond.

john hammond sat down heavily in the damp earth of the hillside and tried to catch his breath.
dear god, it was hot, he thought. hot and humid. he felt as if he were breathing through a
sponge. 
he looked down at the streambed, now forty feet below. it seemed like hours since he had left
the trickling water and begun to climb the hill. his ankle was now swollen and dark purple. he
couldn't put any weight on it at all. he was forced to hop up the hill on his other leg, which now

 call whomever they wished. but they were not permitted to
leave the country. each day a young man from the american embassy came to visit them, to ask
if they needed anything, and to explain that washington was doing everything it could to hasten
their departure. but the plain fact was that many people had died in a territorial possession of
costa rica. the plain fact was that an ecological disaster had been narrowly averted. the
government of costa rica felt it had been misled and deceived by john hammond and his plans
for the island. under the circumstances, the government was not disposed to release survivors in a
hurry. they did not even permit the burial of hammond or ian malcolm. they simply waited.
each day it seemed to grant he was taken to another government office, where he was
questioned by another courteous, intelligent government officer. they made him go over his
story, again and again. how grant had met john hammond. what grant knew of the project.
