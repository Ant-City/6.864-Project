    a man that loves not me, nor none of you.
  river. is it concluded he shall be protector?
  queen elizabeth. it is determin'd, not concluded yet;
    but so it must be, if the king miscarry.

  grey. here come the lords of buckingham and derby.
  buckingham. good time of day unto your royal grace!
  derby. god make your majesty joyful as you have been.
  queen elizabeth. the countess richmond, good my lord
    of derby,
    to your good prayer will scarcely say amen.
    yet, derby, notwithstanding she's your wife
    and loves not me, be you, good lord, assur'd
    i hate not you for her proud arrogance.
  derby. i do beseech you, either not believe
    the envious slanders of her false accusers;
    or, if she be accus'd on true report,
    bear with her weakness, which i think proceeds
    from wayward sickness and no grounded malice.
  queen elizabeth. saw you the kin

  queen elizabeth. ah, cut my lace asunder
    that my pent heart may have some scope to beat,
    or else i swoon with this dead-killing news!
  anne. despiteful tidings! o unpleasing news!
  dorset. be of good cheer; mother, how fares your grace?
  queen elizabeth. o dorset, speak not to me, get thee
    gone!
    death and destruction dogs thee at thy heels;
    thy mother's name is ominous to children.
    if thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
    and live with richmond, from the reach of hell.
    go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
    lest thou increase the number of the dead,
    and make me die the thrall of margaret's curse,
    nor mother, wife, nor england's counted queen.
  stanley. full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
    take all the swift advantage of the hours;
    you shall have letters from me to my son
    in your behalf, to meet you on the way.
    be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.

    did i enjoy the golden dew of sleep,
    but with his timorous dreams was still awak'd.
    besides, he hates me for my father warwick;
    and will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
  queen elizabeth. poor heart, adieu! i pity thy complaining.
  anne. no more than with my soul i mourn for yours.

    north,
    when they should serve their sovereign in the west?
  stanley. they have not been commanded, mighty king.
    pleaseth your majesty to give me leave,
    i'll muster up my friends and meet your grace
    where and what time your majesty shall please.
  king richard. ay, ay, thou wouldst be gone to join with
    richmond;
    but i'll not trust thee.
  stanley. most mighty sovereign,
    you have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful.
    i never was nor never will be false.

    if they were his assistants, yea or no;
    who answer'd him they came from buckingham
    upon his party. he, mistrusting them,
    hois'd sail, and made his course again for britaine.

    now fills thy sleep with perturbations.
    to-morrow in the battle think on me,
    and fall thy edgeless sword. despair and die.
    [to richmond]  thou quiet soul, sleep thou a quiet sleep;
    dream of success and happy victory.
    thy adversary's wife doth pray for thee.

                   enter the ghost of buckingham

  ghost.  [to richard]  the first was i that help'd thee
    to the crown;
    the last was i that felt thy tyranny.
    o, in the battle think on buckingham,
    and die in terror of thy guiltiness!
    dream on, dream on of bloody deeds and death;
    fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!

    god and good angels fight on richmond's side;

  king richard. give me another horse. bind up my wounds.
    have mercy, jesu! soft! i did but dream.
    o coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
    the lights burn blue. it is now dead midnight.
    cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
    what do i fear? myself? there's none else by.
    richard loves richard; that is, i am i.

  king richard. o ratcliff, i have dream'd a fearful dream!
    what think'st thou-will our friends prove all true?
  ratcliff. no doubt, my lord.
  king richard. o ratcliff, i fear, i fear.
  ratcliff. nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
  king richard by the apostle paul, shadows to-night
    have stuck more terror to the soul of richard
    than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
    armed in proof and led by shallow richmond.
    'tis not yet near day. come, go with me;
    under our tents i'll play the eaves-dropper,
    to see if any mean to shrink from me.                 exeunt

          enter the lords to richmond sitting in his tent

  lords. good morrow, richmond!
  richmond. cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
    that you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
  lords. how have you slept, my lord?
  richmond. the sweetest sleep and fairest-boding dreams
    that ever ent'red in a drowsy head

    methought their souls whose bodies richard murder'd
    came to my tent and cried on victory.
    i promise you my soul is very jocund
    in the remembrance of so fair a dream.
    how far into the morning is it, lords?
  lords. upon the stroke of four.
  richmond. why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.

                 his oration to his soldiers

    more than i have said, loving countrymen,
    the leisure and enforcement of the time
    forbids to dwell upon; yet remember this:
    god and our good cause fight upon our side;
    the prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
    like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
    richard except, those whom we fight against
    had rather have us win than him they follow.
