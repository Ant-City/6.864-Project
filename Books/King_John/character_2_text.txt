    i give you welcome with a powerless hand,
    but with a heart full of unstained love;
    welcome before the gates of angiers, duke.

    to cull the plots of best advantages.
    we'll lay before this town our royal bones,
    wade to the market-place in frenchmen's blood,
    but we will make it subject to this boy.

    and stir them up against a mightier task.
    england, impatient of your just demands,
    hath put himself in arms. the adverse winds,

    this toil of ours should be a work of thine;

    how comes it then that thou art call'd a king,

    which owe the crown that thou o'er-masterest?

    to draw my answer from thy articles?
  king philip. from that supernal judge that stirs good thoughts
    in any breast of strong authority
    to look into the blots and stains of right.
    that judge hath made me guardian to this boy,
    under whose warrant i impeach thy wrong,
    and by whose help i mean to chastise it.
  king john. alack, thou dost usurp authority.

    pray that their burdens may not fall this day,
    lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd;

    to curse the fair proceedings of this day.

  constance. you have beguil'd me with a counterfeit
    resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
    proves valueless; you are forsworn, forsworn;
    you came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
    but now in arms you strengthen it with yours.

    but as we under heaven are supreme head,

    where we do reign we will alone uphold,
    without th' assistance of a mortal hand.
    so tell the pope, all reverence set apart
    to him and his usurp'd authority.
  king philip. brother of england, you blaspheme in this.
  king john. though you and all the kings of christendom
    are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
    dreading the curse that money may buy out,
    and by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
    purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
    who in that sale sells pardon from himself-
    though you and all the rest, so grossly led,
    this juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish;
    yet i alone, alone do me oppose
    against the pope,

er cardinal, cry thou 'amen'
    to my keen curses; for without my wrong
    there is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
  pandulph. there's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
  constance. and for mine too; when law can do no right,
    let it be lawful that law bar no wrong;
    law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
    for he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
    therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
    how can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
  pandulph. philip of france, on peril of a curse,
    let go the hand of that arch-heretic,
    and raise the power of france upon his head,
    unless he do submit himself to rome.
  elinor. look'st thou pale, france? do not let go thy hand.
  constance. look to that, devil, lest that france repent
    and by disjoining hands hell lose a soul.
