Henry - 
      Called Henry VI, Henry is the king of England. Crowned at a young age when his popular warrior father died, Henry had a protector, Gloucester, to take care of the kingdom until he was old enough to rule. Prophecies at the time of Henry's coronation declared that Henry VI would lose all the land in France that his father Henry V won. 1 Henry VI depicts wars in France to save those lands, but in this play France is finally lost. Henry marries Margaret, a French girl with no money, giving the French two regions in return for her hand; this horrifies Henry's nobles, who see France slipping out of their grasp. Henry's overall weakness allows his nobles and his wife to create complex plots against each other and against him, culminating in a full-fledged civil war with York. Throughout the play Henry is unable to assert his power.
