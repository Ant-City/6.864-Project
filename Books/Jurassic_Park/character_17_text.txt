chicken, and some kind of a meat-filled pastry. not that ellen would cat any of
it.
"you don't think she'd leave the beach?" ellen said.
"no, hon, i don't."
"i feel so isolated here," ellen said.
"i thought that's what you wanted," mike bowman said.
"i did."
"well, then, what's the problem?"
"i just wish i could see her, is all," ellen said.
then, from down the beach, carried by the wind, they heard their daughter's voice. she was
screaming.

"i think she is quite comfortable now," dr. cruz said, lowering the plastic flap of the oxygen tent
around tina as she slept. mike bowman sat beside the bed, close to his daughter. mike thought
dr. cruz was probably pretty capable; he spoke excellent english, the result of training at medical 
centers in london and baltimore. dr. cruz radiated competence, and the cl¡nica santa mar¡a,
the modern hospital in puntarenas, was spotless and efficient.
but, even so, mike bowman felt nervous. there was no getting around the fact that his only

mike would not soon forget the frantic drive back to civilization, the four-wheel-drive land rover
slipping and sliding up the muddy track into the hills, while his daughter screamed in fear and
pain, and her arm grew more bloated and red. long before they reached the park boundaries, the
swelling had spread to her neck, and then tina began to have trouble breathing. . . .
"she'll be all right now?" ellen said, staring through the plastic oxygen tent.
"i believe so," dr. cruz said. "i have given her another dose of steroids, and her breathing is
much easier. and you can see the edema in her arm is greatly reduced."
mike bowman said, "about those bites. . ."
"we have no identification yet," the doctor said. "i myself haven't seen bites like that before.
but you'll notice they are disappearing. it's already quite difficult to make them out. fortunately i
have taken photographs for reference. and i have washed her arm to collect some samples of
the sticky saliva-one fo

r analysis here, a second to send to the labs in san jos‚, and the third we
will keep frozen in case it is needed. do you have the picture she made?"
"yes," mike bowman said. he handed the doctor the sketch that tina had drawn, in response
to questions from the admitting officials.
"this is the animal that bit her?" dr. cruz said, looking at the picture.
"yes," mike bowman said. "she said it was a green lizard, the size of a chicken or a crow."
"i don't know of such a lizard," the doctor said. "she has drawn it standing on its hind legs. . . ."
"that's right," mike bowman said. "she said it walked on its hind legs."
dr. cruz frowned. he stared at the picture a while longer. "i am not an expert. i've asked for dr.
guitierrez to visit us here. he is a senior researcher at the reserva biol¢gica de carara, which is

ross the bay. perhaps he can identify the animal for us."
"isn't there someone from cabo blanco?" bowman asked. "that's where she was bitten."
"unfortunately not," dr. cruz said. "cabo blanco has no permanent staff, and no researcher
has worked there for some time. you were probably the first people to walk on that beach in
several months. but i am sure you will find dr. guitierrez to be knowledgeable."
dr. guitierrez turned out to be a bearded man wearing khaki shorts and shirt. the surprise was
that he was american. he was introduced to the bowmans, saying in a soft southern accent, "mr.
and mrs. bowman, how you doing, nice to meet you," and then explaining that

 he was a field
biologist from yale who had worked in costa rica for the last five years. marty guitierrez
examined tina thoroughly, lifting her arm gently, peering closely at each of the bites with a
penlight, then measuring them with a small pocket ruler. after a while, guitierrez stepped away,
nodding to himself as if he had understood something. he then inspected the polaroids, and
asked several questions about the saliva, which cruz told him was still being tested in the lab.
finally he turned to mike bowman and his wife, waiting tensely. "i think tina's going to be fine.
i just want to be clear about a few details," he said, making notes in a precise band. "your
daughter says she was bitten by a green lizard, approximately one foot high, which walked
upright onto the beach from the mangrove swamp?"
"that's right, yes."
"and the lizard made some kind of a vocalization?"
"tina said it chirped, or squeaked."
"like a mouse, w

 their hind legs, they are sometimes as tall as a
foot."
"are they poisonous?"
"no, mrs. bowman. not at all." guitierrez explained that the swelling in tina's arm was an
allergic reaction. "according to the literature, fourteen percent of people are strongly allergic to
reptiles," he said, "and your daughter seems to be one of them."
"she was screaming, she said it was so painful."
"probably it was," guitierrez said. "reptile saliva contains serotonin, which causes tremendous
pain." he turned to cruz. "her blood pressure came down with antihistamines?"
"yes," cruz said. "promptly."
"serotonin," guitierrez said. "no question."
still, ellen bowman remained uneasy. "but why would a lizard bite her in the first place?"
"lizard bites are very common," guitierrez said. "animal handlers in zoos get bitten all the
time. and just the other day i heard that a lizard had bitten an infant in her crib in amaloya, about
sixty miles from where you were. so bites do occur. i'm not sure why your daughter ha

s on the holding shelf of the
refrigerator.
the next morning, the day clerk checked the holding shelf against the names of discharged
patients. seeing that bowman, christina l. was scheduled for discharge that morning, the
clerk threw out the saliva samples. at the last moment, he noticed that one sample had the red
tag which meant that it was to be forwarded to the university lab in san jos‚. he retrieved the test
tube from the wastebasket, and sent it on its way.
"go on. say thank you to dr. cruz," ellen bowman said, and pushed tina forward.
"thank you, dr. cruz," tina said. "i feel much better now." she reached up and shook the
doctor's band. then she said, "you have a different shirt."
for a moment dr. cruz looked perplexed; then he smiled. "that's right, tina. when i work all
night at the hospital, in the morning i change my shirt."
"but not your tie?" "no.
just my shirt."
ellen bowman said, "mike told you she's observant."
"she certainly is." dr. cruz smiled and shook the little gir

l's band gravely. "enjoy the rest of
your holiday in costa rica, tina." 
"i will."
the bowman family had started to leave when dr. cruz said, "ob, tina, do you remember the
lizard that bit you?"
"uh-huh."
"you remember its feet?"
"uh-huh."
"did it have any toes?"
"yes."
"how many toes did it have?"
"three," she said.
"how do you know that?"
"because i looked," she said. "anyway, all the birds on the beach made marks in the sand with
three toes, like this." she held up her hand, middle three fingers spread wide. "and the lizard
made those kind of marks in the sand, too."
"the lizard made marks like a bird?"
"uh-huh," tina said.

"he walked like a bird, too. he jerked his head like this, up and down."
she took a few steps, bobbing her head.
after the bowmans had departed, dr. cruz decided to report this conversation to guitierrez, at
the biological station.
"i must admit the girl's story is puzzling," guitierrez said. "i have been doing some checking
myself. i am no longer certain she was bitten by a basilisk. not certain at all."
"then what could it be?"
"well," guitierrez said, "let's not speculate prematurely. by the way, have you heard of any
other lizard bites at the hospital?"
"no, why?"
"let me know, my friend, if you do."

known. biological activity was still under study, but it seemed to be a neurotoxic poison related to
cobra venom, although more primitive in structure.
the lab also detected trace quantities of the gamma-amino metbionine hydrolase. because
this enzyme was a marker for genetic engineering, and not found in wild animals, technicians
assumed it was a lab contaminant and did not report it when they called dr, cruz, the referring
physician in puntarenas.
