ok.
when he was quite sure that the narrative had ended he laughed noiselessly for fully half a minute. then he said:
“well!... that takes the biscuit!”
his voice seemed winnowed of vigour; and to enforce his words he added with humour:
“that takes the solitary, unique, and, if i may so call it, recherché biscuit!”
he became serious and silent when he had said this. his tongue was tired for he had been talking all the afternoon in a public-house in dorset street. most people considered lenehan a leech but, in spite of this reputation, his adroitness and eloquence had always prevented his friends from forming any general policy against him. he had a brave manner of coming up to a party of them in a bar and of holding himself nimbly at the borders of the company until he was included in a round. he was a sporting vagrant armed with a vast stock of stories, limericks and riddles. he was insensitive to all kinds of discourtesy. no one knew how he achieved the stern task of living, but hi

 next sunday, man, i met her by appointment. we went out to donnybrook and i brought her into a field there. she told me she used to go with a dairyman.... it was fine, man. cigarettes every night she’d bring me and paying the tram out and back. and one night she brought me two bloody fine cigars—o, the real cheese, you know, that the old fellow used to smoke.... i was afraid, man, she’d get in the family way. but she’s up to the dodge.”
“maybe she thinks you’ll marry her,” said lenehan.
“i told her i was out of a job,” said corley. “i told her i was in pim’s. she doesn’t know my name. i was too hairy to tell her that. but she thinks i’m a bit of class, you know.”
lenehan laughed again, noiselessly.
“of all the good ones ever i heard,” he said, “that emphatically takes the biscuit.”
corley’s stride acknowledged the compliment. the swing of his burly body made his friend execute a few light skips from the path to the roadway and back again. corley was th

 word. he was often to be seen walking with policemen in plain clothes, talking earnestly. he knew the inner side of all affairs and was fond of delivering final judgments. he spoke without listening to the speech of his companions. his conversation was mainly about himself: what he had said to such a person and what such a person had said to him and what he had said to settle the matter. when he reported these dialogues he aspirated the first letter of his name after the manner of florentines.
lenehan offered his friend a cigarette. as the two young men walked on through the crowd corley occasionally turned to smile at some of the passing girls but lenehan’s gaze was fixed on the large faint moon circled with a double halo. he watched earnestly the passing of the grey web of twilight across its face. at length he said:
“well ... tell me, corley, i suppose you’ll be able to pull it off all right, eh?”
corley closed one eye expressively as an answer.
“is she game for that?” asked l

enehan dubiously. “you can never know women.”
“she’s all right,” said corley. “i know the way to get around her, man. she’s a bit gone on me.”
“you’re what i call a gay lothario,” said lenehan. “and the proper kind of a lothario, too!”
a shade of mockery relieved the servility of his manner. to save himself he had the habit of leaving his flattery open to the interpretation of raillery. but corley had not a subtle mind.
“there’s nothing to touch a good slavey,” he affirmed. “take my tip for it.”
“by one who has tried them all,” said lenehan.
“first i used to go with girls, you know,” said corley, unbosoming; “girls off the south circular. i used to take them o

ut, man, on the tram somewhere and pay the tram or take them to a band or a play at the theatre or buy them chocolate and sweets or something that way. i used to spend money on them right enough,” he added, in a convincing tone, as if he was conscious of being disbelieved.
but lenehan could well believe it; he nodded gravely.
“i know that game,” he said, “and it’s a mug’s game.”
“and damn the thing i ever got out of it,” said corley.
“ditto here,” said lenehan.
“only off of one of them,” said corley.
he moistened his upper lip by running his tongue along it. the recollection brightened his eyes. he too gazed at the pale disc of the moon, now nearly veiled, and seemed to meditate.
“she was ... a bit of all right,” he said regretfully.
he was silent again. then he added:
“she’s on the turf now. i saw her driving down earl street one night with two fellows with her on a car.”
“i suppose that’s your doing,” said lenehan.
“there was

others at her before me,” said corley philosophically.
this time lenehan was inclined to disbelieve. he shook his head to and fro and smiled.
“you know you can’t kid me, corley,” he said.
“honest to god!” said corley. “didn’t she tell me herself?”
lenehan made a tragic gesture.
“base betrayer!” he said.
as they passed along the railings of trinity college, lenehan skipped out into the road and peered up at the clock.
“twenty after,” he said.
“time enough,” said corley. “she’ll be there all right. i always let her wait a bit.”
lenehan laughed quietly.
“ecod! corley, you know how to take them,” he said.
“i’m up to all their little tricks,” corley confessed.
“but tell me,” said lenehan again, “are you sure you can bring it off all right? you know it’s a ticklish job. they’re damn close on that point. eh?... what?”

ght, small eyes searched his companion’s face for reassurance. corley swung his head to and fro as if to toss aside an insistent insect, and his brows gathered.
“i’ll pull it off,” he said. “leave it to me, can’t you?”
lenehan said no more. he did not wish to ruffle his friend’s temper, to be sent to the devil and told that his advice was not wanted. a little tact was necessary. but corley’s brow was soon smooth again. his thoughts were running another way.
“she’s a fine decent tart,” he said, with appreciation; “that’s what she is.”
they walked along nassau street and then turned into kildare street. not far from the porch of the club a harpist stood in the roadway, playing to a little ring of listen

er each group of notes. the notes of the air sounded deep and full.
the two young men walked up the street without speaking, the mournful music following them. when they reached stephen’s green they crossed the road. here the noise of trams, the lights and the crowd released them from their silence.
“there she is!” said corley.
at the corner of hume street a young woman was standing. she wore a blue dress and a white sailor hat. she stood on the curbstone, swinging a sunshade in one hand. lenehan grew lively.
“let’s have a look at her, corley,” he said.
corley glanced sideways at his friend and an unpleasant grin appeared on his face.
“are you trying to get inside me?” he asked.
“damn it!” said lenehan boldly, “i don’t want an introduction. all i want is to have a look at her. i’m not going to eat her.”
“o.... a look at her?” said corley, more amiably. “well ... i’ll tell you what. i’ll go over and talk to her and you can pass by.”
“right!” said len

ehan.
corley had already thrown one leg over the chains when lenehan called out:
“and after? where will we meet?”
“half ten,” answered corley, bringing over his other leg.
“where?”
“corner of merrion street. we’ll be coming back.”
“work it all right now,” said lenehan in farewell.
corley did not answer. he sauntered across the road swaying his head from side to side. his bulk, his easy pace, and the solid sound of his boots had something of the conqueror in them. he approached the young woman and, without saluting, began at once to converse with her. she swung her umbrella more quickly and executed half turns on her heels. once or twice when he spoke to her at close quarters she laughed and bent her head.
lenehan observed them for a few minutes. then he walk

s scrutiny of the young woman’s appearance. she had her sunday finery on. her blue serge skirt was held at the waist by a belt of black leather. the great silver buckle of her belt seemed to depress the centre of her body, catching the light stuff of her white blouse like a clip. she wore a short black jacket with mother-of-pearl buttons and a ragged black boa. the ends of her tulle collarette had been carefully disordered and a big bunch of red flowers was pinned in her bosom, stems upwards. lenehan’s eyes noted approvingly her stout short muscular body. frank rude health glowed in her face, on her fat red cheeks and in her unabashed blue eyes. her features were blunt. she had broad nostrils, a straggling mouth which lay open in a contented leer, and two projecting front teeth. as he passed lenehan took off his cap and, after about ten seconds, corley returned a salute to the air. this he did by raising his hand vaguely and pensively changing the angle of position of his hat.

. then he turned into dame street. at the corner of george’s street he met two friends of his and stopped to converse with them. he was glad that he could rest from all his walking. his friends asked him had he seen corley and what was the latest. he replied that he had spent the day with corley. his friends talked very little. they looked vacantly after some figures in the crowd and sometimes made a critical remark. one said that he had seen mac an hour before in westmoreland street. at this lenehan said that he had been with mac the night before in egan’s. the young man who had seen mac in westmoreland street asked was it true that mac had won a bit over a billiard match. lenehan did not know: he said that holohan had stood them drinks in egan’s.
he left his friends at a quarter to ten and went up george’s street. he turned to the left at the city markets and walked on into grafton street. the crowd of girls and young men had thinned and on his way up the street he heard many groups

the young woman went down the steps into the area of a house. corley remained standing at the edge of the path, a little distance from the front steps. some minutes passed. then the hall-door was opened slowly and cautiously. a woman came running down the front steps and coughed. corley turned and went towards her. his broad figure hid hers from view for a few seconds and then she reappeared running up the steps. the door closed on her and corley began to walk swiftly towards stephen’s green.
lenehan hurried on in the same direction. some drops of light rain fell. he took them as a warning and, glancing back towards the house which the young woman had entered to see that he was not observed, he ran eagerly across the road. anxiety and his swift run made him pant. he called out:
“hallo, corley!”
corley turned his head to see who had called him, and then continued walking as before. lenehan ran after him, settling the waterproof on his shoulders with one hand.
“hallo, corley!” he crie

he came level with his friend and looked keenly in his face. he could see nothing there.
“well?” he said. “did it come off?”
they had reached the corner of ely place. still without answering, corley swerved to the left and went up the side street. his features were composed in stern calm. lenehan kept up with his friend, breathing uneasily. he was baffled and a note of menace pierced through his voice.
“can’t you tell us?” he said. “did you try her?”
corley halted at the first lamp and stared grimly before him. then with a grave gesture he extended a hand towards the light and, smiling, opened it slowly to the gaze of his disciple. a small gold coin shone in the palm.
