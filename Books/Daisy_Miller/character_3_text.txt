â€œtell me your name, my boy,â€ he said.
â€œrandolph c. miller,â€ said the boy sharply. â€œand iâ€™ll tell you her name;â€ and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.
â€œyou had better wait till you are asked!â€ said this young lady calmly.
â€œi should like very much to know your name,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œher name is daisy miller!â€ cried the child. â€œbut that isnâ€™t her real name; that isnâ€™t her name on her cards.â€
â€œitâ€™s a pity you havenâ€™t got one of my cards!â€ said miss miller.
â€œher real name is annie p. miller,â€ the boy went

but on this point randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family. â€œmy fatherâ€™s name is ezra b. miller,â€ he announced. â€œmy father ainâ€™t in europe; my fatherâ€™s in a better place than europe.â€
winterbourne imagined for a moment that this was the manner in which the child had been taught to intimate that mr. miller had been removed to the sphere of celestial reward. but randolph immediately added, â€œmy fatherâ€™s in schenectady. heâ€™s got a big business. my fatherâ€™s rich, you bet!â€
â€œwell!â€ ejaculated miss miller, lowering her parasol and looking at the embroidered border. winterbourne presently released the child, who departed, dragging his alpenstock along the path. â€œhe doesnâ€™t like europe,â€ said the young girl. â€œhe wants to go back.â€
â€œto schenectady, you mean?â€
â€œyes; he wants t

â€œyes,â€ said winterbourne; â€œhe seems very smart.â€
â€œmotherâ€™s going to get a teacher for him as soon as we get to italy. can you get good teachers in italy?â€
â€œvery good, i should think,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œor else sheâ€™s going to find some school. he ought to learn some more. heâ€™s only nine. heâ€™s going to college.â€ and in this way miss miller continued to converse upon the affairs of her family and upon other topics. she sat there with her extremely pretty hands, ornamented with very brilliant rings, folded in her lap, and with her pretty eyes now resting upon those of winterbourne, now wandering over the garden, the people who passed by, and the beautiful view. she talked to winterbourne as if she had known him a long time. he found it very pleasant. it was many years since he had heard a young girl talk so much. it might have been

d her tone was decidedly sociable. she gave winterbourne a history of her movements and intentions and those of her mother and brother, in europe, and enumerated, in particular, the various hotels at which they had stopped. â€œthat english lady in the cars,â€ she saidâ€”â€œmiss featherstoneâ€”asked me if we didnâ€™t all live in hotels in america. i told her i had never been in so many hotels in my life as since i came to europe. i have never seen so manyâ€”itâ€™s nothing but hotels.â€ but miss miller did not make this remark with a querulous accent; she appeared to be in the best humor with everything. she declared that the hotels were very good, when once you got used to their ways, and that europe was perfectly sweet. she was not disappointedâ€”not a bit. perhaps it was because she had heard so much about it before. she had ever so many intimate friends that had been there ever so many times. and then she had had ever so many dresses and things from paris. whenever she put on a paris dres

s she felt as if she were in europe.
â€œit was a kind of a wishing cap,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œyes,â€ said miss miller without examining this analogy; â€œit always made me wish i was here. but i neednâ€™t have done that for dresses. i am sure they send all the pretty ones to america; you see the most frightful things here. the only thing i donâ€™t like,â€ she proceeded, â€œis the society. there isnâ€™t any society; or, if there is, i donâ€™t know where it keeps itself. do you? i suppose there is some society somewhere, but i havenâ€™t seen anything of it. iâ€™m very fond of society, and i have always had a gre

poor winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. he had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just

 this fashion; never, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. and yet was he to accuse miss daisy miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they said at geneva? he felt that he had lived at geneva so long that he had lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the american tone. never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had he encountered a young american girl of so pronounced a type as this. certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! was she simply a pretty girl from new york state? were they all like that, the pretty girls who had a good deal of

gentlemenâ€™s society? or was she also a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. miss daisy miller looked extremely innocent. some people had told him that, after all, american girls were exceedingly innocent; and others had told him that, after all, they were not. he was inclined to think miss daisy miller was a flirtâ€”a pretty american flirt. he had never, as yet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. he had known, here in europe, two or three womenâ€”persons older than miss daisy miller, and provided, for respectabilityâ€™s sake, with husbandsâ€”who were great coquettesâ€”dangerous, terrible women, with whom oneâ€™s relations were liable to take a serious turn. but this young girl was not a coquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a pretty american fli

rt. winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to miss daisy miller. he leaned back in his seat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of oneâ€™s intercourse with a pretty american flirt. it presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn.
â€œhave you been to that old castle?â€ asked the young girl, pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the chateau de chillon.
â€œyes, formerly, more than once,â€ said winterbourne. â€œyou too, i suppos

e, have seen it?â€
â€œno; we havenâ€™t been there. i want to go there dreadfully. of course i mean to go there. i wouldnâ€™t go away from here without having seen that old castle.â€
â€œitâ€™s a very pretty excursion,â€ said winterbourne, â€œand very easy to make. you can drive, you know, or you can go by the little steamer.â€
â€œyou can go in the cars,â€ said miss miller.
â€œyes; you can go in the cars,â€ winterbourne assented.
â€œour courier says they take you right up to the castle,â€ the young girl continued. â€œwe were going last week, but my mother gave out. she suffers dreadfully from dyspepsia. she said she couldnâ€™t go. randolph wouldnâ€™t go either; he says he doesnâ€™t think much of old castles. but i guess weâ€™ll go this week, if we can get randolph.â€
â€œyour brother is not interested in ancient monuments?â€ winterbourne inquired, smiling.

he says he donâ€™t care much about old castles. heâ€™s only nine. he wants to stay at the hotel. motherâ€™s afraid to leave him alone, and the courier wonâ€™t stay with him; so we havenâ€™t been to many places. but it will be too bad if we donâ€™t go up there.â€ and miss miller pointed again at the chateau de chillon.
â€œi should think it might be arranged,â€ said winterbourne. â€œcouldnâ€™t you get some one to stay for the afternoon with randolph?â€
miss miller looked at him a moment, and then, very placidly, â€œi wish you would stay with him!â€ she said.
winterbourne hesitated a moment. â€œi should much rather go to chillon with you.â€
â€œwith me?â€ asked the young girl with the same placidity.
she didnâ€™t rise, blushing, as a young girl at geneva would have done; and yet winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought it possible she was offended. â€œwith your mother,â€ he answered very respectfully.
but it seemed that both his auda

city and his respect were lost upon miss daisy miller. â€œi guess my mother wonâ€™t go, after all,â€ she said. â€œshe donâ€™t like to ride round in the afternoon. but did you really mean what you said just nowâ€”that you would like to go up there?â€
â€œmost earnestly,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen we may arrange it. if mother will stay with randolph, i guess eugenio will.â€
â€œeugenio?â€ the young man inquired.
â€œeugenioâ€™s our courier. he doesnâ€™t like to stay with randolph; heâ€™s the most fastidious man i ever saw. but heâ€™s a splen

did courier. i guess heâ€™ll stay at home with randolph if mother does, and then we can go to the castle.â€
winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possibleâ€”â€œweâ€ could only mean miss daisy miller and himself. this program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young ladyâ€™s hand. possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably eugenio, appeared. a tall, handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain, approached miss miller, looking sharply at her companion. â€œoh, eugenio!â€ said miss miller with the friendliest accent.
eugenio had looked at

winterbourne from head to foot; he now bowed gravely to the young lady. â€œi have the honor to inform mademoiselle that luncheon is upon the table.â€
miss miller slowly rose. â€œsee here, eugenio!â€ she said; â€œiâ€™m going to that old castle, anyway.â€
â€œto the chateau de chillon, mademoiselle?â€ the courier inquired. â€œmademoiselle has made arrangements?â€ he added in a tone which struck winterbourne as very impertinent.
eugenioâ€™s tone apparently threw, even to miss millerâ€™s own apprehension, a slightly ironical light upon the young girlâ€™s situation. she turned to winterbourne, blushing a littleâ€”a very little. â€œyou wonâ€™t back out?â€ she said.
â€œi shall not be happy till we go!â€ he protested.
â€œand you are staying in this hotel?â€ she went on. â€œand you are really an american?â€
the courier stood looking at winterbourne offensively. the young man, at least, thought his manner of looking an offense to miss miller; it conveyed an imputation that sh

e â€œpicked upâ€ acquaintances. â€œi shall have the honor of presenting to you a person who will tell you all about me,â€ he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.
â€œoh, well, weâ€™ll go some day,â€ said miss miller. and she gave him a smile and turned away. she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio. winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved away, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess.
he had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising to present his aunt, mrs. costello, to miss daisy miller. as soon as the former lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her apartment; a

nto many of the secrets of that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in the american capital. she admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if he were acquainted with new york, he would see that one had to be. and her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was, to winterbourneâ€™s imagination, almost oppressively striking.
he immediately perceived, from her tone, that miss daisy millerâ€™s place in the social scale was low. â€œi am afraid you donâ€™t approve of them,â€ he said.
â€œthey are very common,â€ mrs. costello declared. â€œthey are the sort of americans that one does oneâ€™s duty by notâ€”not accepting.â€
â€œah, you donâ€™t accept them?â€ said the young man.
â€œi canâ€™t, my dear frederick. i would if i could, but i canâ€™t.â€
â€œthe young girl is very pretty,â€ said winterbourne in a moment.
â€œof course sheâ€™s pretty. but she is very common.â€
â€œi see what

ust decline the honor of her acquaintance. i am an old woman, but i am not too old, thank heaven, to be shocked!â€
â€œbut donâ€™t they all do these thingsâ€”the young girls in america?â€ winterbourne inquired.
mrs. costello stared a moment. â€œi should like to see my granddaughters do them!â€ she declared grimly.
this seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were â€œtremendous flirts.â€ if, therefore, miss daisy miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that anything might be expected of her. winterbourne was impatient to see her again, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not appreciate her justly.
though he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say to her about his auntâ€™s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he discovered, promptly enough, that with miss daisy miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe. he found

 her that evening in the garden, wandering about in the warm starlight like an indolent sylph, and swinging to and fro the largest fan he had ever beheld. it was ten oâ€™clock. he had dined with his aunt, had been sitting with her since dinner, and had just taken leave of her till the morrow. miss daisy miller seemed very glad to see him; she declared it was the longest evening she had ever passed.
â€œhave you been all alone?â€ he asked.
â€œi have been walking round with mother. but mother gets tired walking round,â€ she answered.
â€œhas she gone to bed?â€
â€œno; she doesnâ€™t like to go to bed,â€ said the young girl. â€œshe doesnâ€™t sleepâ€”not three hours. she says she doesnâ€™t know how she lives. sheâ€™s dreadfully nervous. i guess she sleeps more than she thinks. sheâ€™s gone somewhere afte

”or they donâ€™t speak to us. i suppose itâ€™s about the same thing. anyway, i shall be ever so glad to know your aunt.â€
winterbourne was embarrassed. â€œshe would be most happy,â€ he said; â€œbut i am afraid those headaches will interfere.â€
the young girl looked at him through the dusk. â€œbut i suppose she doesnâ€™t have a headache every day,â€ she said sympathetically.
winterbourne was silent a moment. â€œshe tells me she does,â€ he answered at last, not knowing what to say.
miss daisy miller stopped and stood looking at him. her prettiness was still visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous fan. â€œshe doesnâ€™t want to know me!â€ she said suddenly. â€œwhy donâ€™t you say so? you neednâ€™t be afraid. iâ€™m not afraid!â€ and she gave a little laugh.
winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched, shocked, mortified by it. â€œmy dear young lady,â€ he protested, â€œshe knows no one. itâ€™s her wretched health.â€
the young girl walked o

n a few steps, laughing still. â€œyou neednâ€™t be afraid,â€ she repeated. â€œwhy should she want to know me?â€ then she paused again; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her was the starlit lake. there was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms. daisy miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh. â€œgracious! she is exclusive!â€ she said. winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her. he had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes. he felt then, for the instant, quite ready to sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit

himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an exclamation in quite another tone. â€œwell, hereâ€™s mother! i guess she hasnâ€™t got randolph to go to bed.â€ the figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. suddenly it seemed to pause.
â€œare you sure it is your mother? can you distinguish her in this thick dusk?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œwell!â€ cried miss daisy miller with a laugh; â€œi guess i know my own mother. and when she has got on my shawl, too! she is always wearing my things.â€
the lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps.
â€œi am afraid your mother doesnâ€™t see you,â€ said winterbourne. â€œor perhaps,â€ he added, thinking, with miss miller, the joke permissibleâ€”â€œperhaps she feels guilty about your shawl.â€
â€œoh, itâ€™s a fearful old thing!â€ the young girl replied serenely. â

€œi told her she could wear it. she wonâ€™t come here because she sees you.â€
â€œah, then,â€ said winterbourne, â€œi had better leave you.â€
â€œoh, no; come on!â€ urged miss daisy miller.
â€œiâ€™m afraid your mother doesnâ€™t approve of my walking with you.â€
miss miller gave him a serious glance. â€œit isnâ€™t for me; itâ€™s for youâ€”that is, itâ€™s for her. well, i donâ€™t know who itâ€™s for! but mother doesnâ€™t like any of my gentlemen friends. sheâ€™s right down timid. she always makes a fuss if i introduce a gentleman. but i do introduce themâ€”almost always. if i didnâ€™t introduce my gentlemen friends to mother,â€ the young girl added in her little soft, flat monotone, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think i was natural.â€
â€œto introduce me,â€ said winterbourne,

 â€œyou must know my name.â€ and he proceeded to pronounce it.
â€œoh, dear, i canâ€™t say all that!â€ said his companion with a laugh. but by this time they had come up to mrs. miller, who, as they drew near, walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them. â€œmother!â€ said the young girl in a tone of decision. upon this the elder lady turned round. â€œmr. winterbourne,â€ said miss daisy miller, introducing the young man very frankly and prettily. â€œcommon,â€ she was, as mrs. costello had pronounced her; yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that, with her commonness, she had a singularly delicate grace.
her mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye, a very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain amount of thin, much frizzled hair. like her daughter, mrs. miller was dressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. so far a

 was near her, pulling her shawl straight. â€œwhat are you doing, poking round here?â€ this young lady inquired, but by no means with that harshness of accent which her choice of words may imply.
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ said her mother, turning toward the lake again.
â€œi shouldnâ€™t think youâ€™d want that shawl!â€ daisy exclaimed.
â€œwell i do!â€ her mother answered with a little laugh.
â€œdid you get randolph to go to bed?â€ asked the young girl.
â€œno; i couldnâ€™t induce him,â€ said mrs. miller very gently. â€œhe wants to talk to the waiter. he likes to talk to that waiter.â€
â€œi was telling mr. winterbourne,â€ the young girl went on; and to the young manâ€™s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life.
â€œoh, yes!â€ said winterbourne; â€œi have the pleasure of knowing your son.â€
randolphâ€™s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake. but at last she spoke. â€œwell, i donâ€™t see how he lives!â€
â€œanyhow, it isnâ€™t so bad as

 it was at dover,â€ said daisy miller.
â€œand what occurred at dover?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œhe wouldnâ€™t go to bed at all. i guess he sat up all night in the public parlor. he wasnâ€™t in bed at twelve oâ€™clock: i know that.â€
â€œit was half-past twelve,â€ declared mrs. miller with mild emphasis.
â€œdoes he sleep much during the day?â€ winterbourne demanded.
â€œi guess he doesnâ€™t sleep much,â€ daisy rejoined.
â€œi wish he would!â€ said her mother. â€œit seems as if he couldnâ€™t.â€
â€œi think heâ€™s real tiresome,â€ daisy pursued.
then, for some moments, there was silence. â€œwell, daisy miller,â€ said the elder lady, presently, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think youâ€™d want to talk against your own brother!â€
â€œwell, he is tiresome, mother,â€ said daisy, quite witho

ut the asperity of a retort.
â€œheâ€™s only nine,â€ urged mrs. miller.
â€œwell, he wouldnâ€™t go to that castle,â€ said the young girl. â€œiâ€™m going there with mr. winterbourne.â€
to this announcement, very placidly made, daisyâ€™s mamma offered no response. winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the projected excursion; but he said to himself that she was a simple, easily managed person, and that a few deferential protestations would take the edge from her displeasure. â€œyes,â€ he began; â€œyour daughter has kindly allowed me the hono

r of being her guide.â€
mrs. millerâ€™s wandering eyes attached themselves, with a sort of appealing air, to daisy, who, however, strolled a few steps farther, gently humming to herself. â€œi presume you will go in the cars,â€ said her mother.
â€œyes, or in the boat,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œwell, of course, i donâ€™t know,â€ mrs. miller rejoined. â€œi have never been to that castle.â€
â€œit is a pity you shouldnâ€™t go,â€ said winterbourne, beginning to feel reassured as to her opposition. and yet he was quite prepared to find that, as a matter of course, she meant to accompany her daughter.
â€œweâ€™ve been thinking ever so much about going,â€ she pursued; â€œbut it seems as if we couldnâ€™t. of course daisyâ€”she wants to go round. but thereâ€™s a lady hereâ€”i donâ€™t know her nameâ€”she says she shouldnâ€™t think weâ€™d

want to go to see castles here; she should think weâ€™d want to wait till we got to italy. it seems as if there would be so many there,â€ continued mrs. miller with an air of increasing confidence. â€œof course we only want to see the principal ones. we visited several in england,â€ she presently added.
â€œah yes! in england there are beautiful castles,â€ said winterbourne. â€œbut chillon here, is very well worth seeing.â€
â€œwell, if daisy feels up to itâ€”â€ said mrs. miller, in a tone impregnated with a sense of the magnitude of the enterprise. â€œit seems as if there was nothing she wouldnâ€™t undertake.â€
â€œoh, i think sheâ€™ll enjoy it!â€ winterbourne declared. and he desired more and more to make it a certainty that he was to have the privilege of a tete-a-tete with the young lady, who was still strolling along in front of them, softly vocalizing. â€œyou are not disposed, madam,â€ he inquired, â€œto undertake it yourself?â€
daisyâ€™s mother looked at him

an instant askance, and then walked forward in silence. thenâ€”â€œi guess she had better go alone,â€ she said simply. winterbourne observed to himself that this was a very different type of maternity from that of the vigilant matrons who massed themselves in the forefront of social intercourse in the dark old city at the other end of the lake. but his meditations were interrupted by hearing his name very distinctly pronounced by mrs. millerâ€™s unprotected daughter.
â€œmr. winterbourne!â€ murmured daisy.
â€œmademoiselle!â€ said the young man.
â€œdonâ€™t you want to take me out in a boat?â€
â€œat present?â€ he asked.
â€œof course!â€ said daisy.
â€œwell, annie miller!â€ exclaimed her mother.
â€œi beg you, madam, to let her go,â€ said winterbourne ardently; for he had never yet enjoyed the sensation of guiding through the summer starlight a skiff freighted with a fresh and beautiful young girl.
â€œi shouldnâ€™t think sheâ€™d w

from the garden to the lake. â€œif you will do me the honor to accept my arm, we will go and select one of them.â€
daisy stood there smiling; she threw back her head and gave a little, light laugh. â€œi like a gentleman to be formal!â€ she declared.
â€œi assure you itâ€™s a formal offer.â€
â€œi was bound i would make you say something,â€ daisy went on.
â€œyou see, itâ€™s not very difficult,â€ said winterbourne. â€œbut i am afraid you are chaffing me.â€
â€œi think not, sir,â€ remarked mrs. miller very gently.
â€œdo, then, let me give you a row,â€ he said to the young girl.
â€œitâ€™s quite lovely, the way you say that!â€ cried daisy.
â€œit will be still more lovely to do it.â€
â€œyes, it would be lovely!â€ said daisy. but she made no movement to accompany him; she only stood there laughing.
â€œi should think you had better find out what time it is,â€ interposed her mother.
â€œit is eleven oâ€™clock, madam,â€ said a voice, with a foreign accent, out of the neighboring darkness; and

winterbourne, turning, perceived the florid personage who was in attendance upon the two ladies. he had apparently just approached.
â€œoh, eugenio,â€ said daisy, â€œi am going out in a boat!â€
eugenio bowed. â€œat eleven oâ€™clock, mademoiselle?â€
â€œi am going with mr. winterbourneâ€”this very minute.â€
â€œdo tell her she canâ€™t,â€ said mrs. miller to the courier.
â€œi think you had better not go out in a boat, mademoiselle,â€ eugenio declared.
winterbourne wished to heaven this pretty girl were not so familiar with her courier; but he said nothing.
â€œi suppose you donâ€™t think itâ€™s proper!â€ daisy exclaimed. â€œeugenio doesnâ€™t think anythingâ€™s proper.â€
â€œi am at your service,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œdoes mademoiselle propose to go alone?â€ asked eugenio of mrs. miller.
â€œoh, no; with this gentleman!â€ answered daisyâ€™s

rier looked for a moment at winterbourneâ€”the latter thought he was smilingâ€”and then, solemnly, with a bow, â€œas mademoiselle pleases!â€ he said.
â€œoh, i hoped you would make a fuss!â€ said daisy. â€œi donâ€™t care to go now.â€
â€œi myself shall make a fuss if you donâ€™t go,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œthatâ€™s all i wantâ€”a little fuss!â€ and the young girl began to laugh again.
â€œmr. randolph has gone to bed!â€ the courier announced frigidly.
â€œoh, daisy; now we can go!â€ said mrs. miller.
daisy turned away from winterbourne, looking at him, smiling and fanning herself. â€œgood night,â€ she said; â€œi hope you are disappointed, or disgusted, or something!â€
he looked at her, taking the hand she offered him. â€œi am puzzled,â€ he answered.
â€œwell, i hope it wonâ€™t keep you awake!â€ she said very smartly; and, under the escort of the privileged eugenio, the two ladies passed toward the house.

 feudal antiquities and that the dusky traditions of chillon made but a slight impression upon her. they had the good fortune to have been able to walk about without other companionship than that of the custodian; and winterbourne arranged with this functionary that they should not be hurriedâ€”that they should linger and pause wherever they chose. the custodian interpreted the bargain generouslyâ€”winterbourne, on his side, had been generousâ€”and ended by leaving them quite to themselves. miss millerâ€™s observations were not remarkable for logical consistency; for anything she wanted to say she was sure to find a pretext. she found a great many pretexts in the rugged embrasures of chillon for asking winterbourne sudden questions about himselfâ€”his family, his previous history, his tastes, his habits, his intentionsâ€”and for supplying information upon corresponding points in her own personality. of her own tastes, habits, and intentions miss miller was prepared to give the most definite,

i donâ€™t want you to come for your aunt,â€ said daisy; â€œi want you to come for me.â€ and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. he declared that, at any rate, he would certainly come. after this daisy stopped teasing. winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to vevey in the dusk; the young girl was very quiet.
in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs. costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller.
â€œthe americansâ€”of the courier?â€ asked this lady.
â€œah, happily,â€ said winterbourne, â€œthe courier stayed at home.â€
â€œshe went with you all alone?â€
â€œall alone.â€
mrs. costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. â€œand that,â€ she exclaimed, â€œis the young person whom you wanted me to know!â€

winterbourne, who had returned to geneva the day after his excursion to chillon, went to rome toward the end of january. his aunt had been established there for sever

in the natural course of events, winterbourne, on arriving in rome, would presently have ascertained mrs. millerâ€™s address at the american bankerâ€™s and have gone to pay his compliments to miss daisy. â€œafter what happened at vevey, i think i may certainly call upon them,â€ he said to mrs. costello.
â€œif, after what happensâ€”at vevey and everywhereâ€”you desire to keep up the acquaintance, you are very welcome. of course a man may know everyone. men are welcome to the privilege!â€
â€œpray what is it that happensâ€”here, for instance?â€ winterbourne demanded.

â€œand where is the mother?â€
â€œi havenâ€™t the least idea. they are very dreadful people.â€
winterbourne meditated a moment. â€œthey are very ignorantâ€”very innocent only. depend upon it they are not bad.â€
â€œthey are hopelessly vulgar,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œwhether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being â€˜badâ€™ is a question for the metaphysicians. they are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life that is quite enough.â€
the news that daisy miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked winterbourneâ€™s impulse to go straightway to see her. he had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations; the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old roman window and asking herself urgently when mr. winterbourne would arrive

. if, however, he determined to wait a little before reminding miss miller of his claims to her consideration, he went very soon to call upon two or three other friends. one of these friends was an american lady who had spent several winters at geneva, where she had placed her children at school. she was a very accomplished woman, and she lived in the via gregoriana. winterbourne found her in a little crimson drawing room on a third floor; the room was filled with southern sunshine. he had not been there ten minutes when the servant came in, announcing â€œmadame mila!

â€ this announcement was presently followed by the entrance of little randolph miller, who stopped in the middle of the room and stood staring at winterbourne. an instant later his pretty sister crossed the threshold; and then, after a considerable interval, mrs. miller slowly advanced.
â€œi know you!â€ said randolph.
â€œiâ€™m sure you know a great many things,â€ exclaimed winterbourne, taking him by the hand. â€œhow is your education coming on?â€
daisy was exchanging greetings very prettily with her hostess, but when she heard winterbourneâ€™s voice she quickly turned her head. â€œwell, i declare!â€ she said.
â€œi told you i should come, you know,â€ winterbourne rejoined, smiling.
â€œwell, i didnâ€™t believe it,â€ said miss daisy.
â€œi am much obliged t

o you,â€ laughed the young man.
â€œyou might have come to see me!â€ said daisy.
â€œi arrived only yesterday.â€
â€œi donâ€™t believe that!â€ the young girl declared.
winterbourne turned with a protesting smile to her mother, but this lady evaded his glance, and, seating herself, fixed her eyes upon her son. â€œweâ€™ve got a bigger place than this,â€ said randolph. â€œitâ€™s all gold on the walls.â€
mrs. miller turned uneasily in her chair. â€œi told you if i were to bring you, you would say something!â€ she murmured.
â€œi told you!â€ randolph exclaimed. â€œi tell you, sir!â€ he added jocosely, giving winterbourne a thump on the knee. â€œit is bigger, too!â€
daisy had entered upon a lively conversation with her hostess; winterbourne judged it becoming to address a few words to her mother. â€œi hope you have been well since we parted at vevey,â€ he said.
mrs. miller now certainly looked at himâ€”a

â€œsheâ€™s got the dyspepsia,â€ said randolph. â€œiâ€™ve got it too. fatherâ€™s got it. iâ€™ve got it most!â€
this announcement, instead of embarrassing mrs. miller, seemed to relieve her. â€œi suffer from the liver,â€ she said. â€œi think itâ€™s this climate; itâ€™s less bracing than schenectady, especially in the winter season. i donâ€™t know whether you know we reside at schenectady. i was saying to daisy that i certainly hadnâ€™t found any one like dr. davis, and i didnâ€™t believe i should. oh, at schenectady he stands first; they think everything of him. he has so much to do, and yet there was nothing he wouldnâ€™t do for me. he said he never saw an

winterbourne had a good deal of pathological gossip with dr. davisâ€™s patient, during which daisy chattered unremittingly to her own companion. the young man asked mrs. miller how she was pleased with rome. â€œwell, i must say i am disappointed,â€ she answered. â€œwe had heard so much about it; i suppose we had heard to

â€œthe best place weâ€™ve seen is the city of richmond!â€ said randolph.
â€œhe means the ship,â€ his mother explained. â€œwe crossed in that ship. randolph had a good time on the city of richmond.â€
â€œitâ€™s the best place iâ€™ve seen,â€ the child repeated. â€œonly it was turned the wrong way.â€
â€œwell, weâ€™ve got to turn the right way some time,â€ said mrs. miller with a little laugh. winterbourne expressed the hope that her daughter at least found some gratification in rome, and she declared that daisy was quite carried away. â€œitâ€™s on account of the societyâ€”the societyâ€™s splendid. she goes round everywhere; she has made a great number of acquaintances. of course she goes round more than i do. i must say they have been very sociable; they have taken her right in. and then she knows a great many gentlemen. oh, she thinks thereâ€™s nothing like rom

e. of course, itâ€™s a great deal pleasanter for a young lady if she knows plenty of gentlemen.â€
by this time daisy had turned her attention again to winterbourne. â€œiâ€™ve been telling mrs. walker how mean you were!â€ the young girl announced.
â€œand what is the evidence you have offered?â€ asked winterbourne, rather annoyed at miss millerâ€™s want of appreciation of the zeal of an admirer who on his way down to rome had stopped neither at bologna nor at florence, simply because of a certain sentimental impatience. he remembered that a cynical compatriot had once told him that american womenâ€”the pretty ones, and this gave a largeness to the axiomâ€”were at once the most exacting in the world and the least endowed with a sense of indebtedness.
â€œwhy, you were awfully mean at vevey,â€ said daisy. â€œyou wouldnâ€™t do anything.

ds to his words, â€œi tell you youâ€™ve got to go. eugenioâ€™ll raiseâ€”something!â€
â€œiâ€™m not afraid of eugenio,â€ said daisy with a toss of her head. â€œlook here, mrs. walker,â€ she went on, â€œyou know iâ€™m coming to your party.â€
â€œi am delighted to hear it.â€
â€œiâ€™ve got a lovely dress!â€
â€œi am very sure of that.â€
â€œbut i want to ask a favorâ€”permission to bring a friend.â€
â€œi shall be happy to see any of your friends,â€ said mrs. walker, turning with a smile to mrs. miller.
â€œoh, they are not my friends,â€ answered daisyâ€™s mamma, smiling shyly in her own fashion. â€œi never spoke to them.â€
â€œitâ€™s an intimate friend of mineâ€”mr. giovanelli,â€ said daisy without a tremor in her clear little voice or a shadow on her brilliant little face.
mrs. walker was silent a moment; she gave a rapid glance at winterbourne. â€œi shall be glad to see mr. giovanelli,â€ she then said.
â€œheâ€™s an italian,â€ daisy pursued with the prettiest serenity. â€œheâ€™s a great

friend of mine; heâ€™s the handsomest man in the worldâ€”except mr. winterbourne! he knows plenty of italians, but he wants to know some americans. he thinks ever so much of americans. heâ€™s tremendously clever. heâ€™s perfectly lovely!â€
it was settled that this brilliant personage should be brought to mrs. walkerâ€™s party, and then mrs. miller prepared to take her leave. â€œi guess weâ€™ll go back to the hotel,â€ she said.
â€œyou may go back to the hotel, mother, but iâ€™m going to take a walk,â€ said daisy.
â€œsheâ€™s going to walk with mr. giovanelli,â€ randolph proclaimed.
â€œi am going to the pincio,â€ said daisy, smiling.
â€œalone, my dearâ€”at this hour?â€ mrs. walker asked. the afternoon was drawing to a closeâ€”it was the hour for the throng of carriages and of contemplative pedestrians. â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s safe, m

â€œneither do i,â€ subjoined mrs. miller. â€œyouâ€™ll get the fever, as sure as you live. remember what dr. davis told you!â€
â€œgive her some medicine before she goes,â€ said randolph.
the company had risen to its feet; daisy, still showing her pretty teeth, bent over and kissed her hostess. â€œmrs. walker, you are too perfect,â€ she said. â€œiâ€™m not going alone; i am going to meet a friend.â€
â€œyour friend wonâ€™t keep you from getting the fever,â€ mrs. miller observed.
â€œis it mr. giovanelli?â€ asked the hostess.
winterbourne was watching the young girl; at this question his attention quickened. she stood there, smiling and smoothing her bonnet ribbons; she glanced at winterbourne. then, while she glanced and smiled, she answered, without a shade of hesitation, â€œmr. giovanelliâ€”the beautiful giovanelli.â€
â€œmy dear young friend,â€ said mrs. walker, taking her hand pleadingly, â€œdonâ€™t walk off to the pincio at this hour to meet a beautiful

â€œwell, he speaks english,â€ said mrs. miller.

winterbourneâ€™s politeness hastened to affirm itself, and the young girl gave him gracious leave to accompany her. they passed downstairs before her mother, and at the door winterbourne perceived mrs. mille

â€œi certainly shall not help you to find him,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen i shall find him without you,â€ cried miss daisy.
â€œyou certainly wonâ€™t leave me!â€ cried winterbourne.

tion of audacity and innocence.
she had been walking some quarter of an hour, attended by her two cavaliers, and responding in a tone of very childish gaiety, as it seemed to winterbourne, to the pretty speeches of mr. giovanelli, when a carriage that had detached itself from the revolving train drew up beside the path. at the same moment winterbourne perceived that his friend mrs. walkerâ€”the lady whose house he had lately leftâ€”was seated in the vehicle and was beckoning to him. leaving miss millerâ€™s side, he hastened to obey her summons. mrs. walker was flushed; she wore an excited air. â€œit is really too dreadful,â€ she said. â€œthat girl must not do this sort of thing. she must not walk here with you two men. fifty people have noticed her.â€
winterbourne raised his eyebrows. â€œi think itâ€™s a pity to make too much fuss about it.â€
â€œitâ€™s a pity to let the girl ruin herself!â€
â€œshe is very innocent,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œsheâ€™s very crazy!â€ cried mrs. walker. â€œdid

ordered the carriage and put on my bonnet, and came here as quickly as possible. thank heaven i have found you!â€
â€œwhat do you propose to do with us?â€ asked winterbourne, smiling.
â€œto ask her to get in, to drive her about here for half an hour, so that the world may see she is not running absolutely wild, and then to take her safely home.â€
â€œi donâ€™t think itâ€™s a very happy thought,â€ said winterbourne; â€œbut you can try.â€
mrs. walker tried. the young man went in pursuit of miss miller, who had simply nodded and smiled at his interlocutor in the carriage and had gone her way with her companion. daisy, on learning that mrs. walker wished to speak to her, retraced her steps with a perfect good grace and with mr. giovanelli at her side. she declared that she was delighted to have a chance to present this gentleman to mrs. walker. she immediately achieved the introduction, and declared that she had never in her life seen anything so lovely as mrs. walkerâ€™s carriage rug.

â€œwell, it ought to be, then!â€ said daisy. â€œif i didnâ€™t walk i should expire.â€
â€œyou should walk with your mother, dear,â€ cried the lady from geneva, losing patience.
â€œwith my mother dear!â€ exclaimed the young girl. winterbourne saw that she scented interference. â€œmy mother never walked ten steps in her life. and then, you know,â€ she added with a laugh, â€œi am more than five years old.â€
â€œyou are old enough to be more reasonable. you are old enough, dear miss miller, to be talked about.â€
daisy looked at mrs. walker, smiling intensely. â€œtalked about? what do you mean?â€
â€œcome into my carriage, and i will tell you.â€
daisy turned her quickened glance again from one of the gentlemen beside her to the other. mr. giovanelli was bowing to and fro, rubbing down his gloves and laughing very agreeably; winterbourne thought it a most unpleasant scene. â€œi donâ€™t think i want to know what you mean,â€ said daisy presently. â€œi donâ€™t think i should like i

, and glancing at him from head to foot, â€œthat, to save my reputation, i ought to get into the carriage?â€
winterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. it seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her â€œreputation.â€ but he himself, in fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. the finest gallantry, here, was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for winterbourne, as the few indications i have been able to give have made him known to the reader, was that daisy miller should take mrs. walkerâ€™s advice. he looked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, â€œi think you should get into the carriage.â€
daisy gave a violent laugh. â€œi never heard anything so stiff! if this is improper, mrs. walker,â€ she pursued, â€œthen i am all improper, and you must give me up. goodbye; i hope youâ€™ll have a lovely ride!â€ and, with mr. giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned away.
mrs. walker sat looking after her, and there

â€œbut her brother,â€ said winterbourne, laughing, â€œsits up till midnight.â€
â€œhe must be edified by what he sees. iâ€™m told that at their hotel everyone is talking about her, and that a smile goes round among all the servants when a gentleman comes and asks for miss miller.â€
â€œthe servants be hanged!â€ said winterbourne angrily. â€œthe poor girlâ€™s only fault,â€ he presently added, â€œis that she is very uncultivated.â€
â€œshe is naturally indelicate,â€ mrs. walker declared.
â€œtake that example this morning. how long had you known her at vevey?â€
â€œa couple of days.â€
â€œfancy, then, her making it a personal matter that you should have left the place!â€
winterbourne was silent for some moments; then he said, â€œi suspect, mrs. walker, that you and i

â€œi wished to beg you to cease your relations with miss millerâ€”not to flirt with herâ€”to give her no further opportunity to expose herselfâ€”to let her alone, in short.â€
â€œiâ€™m afraid i canâ€™t do that,â€ said winterbourne. â€œi like her extremely.â€
â€œall the more reason that you shouldnâ€™t help her to make a scandal.â€
â€œthere shall be nothing scandalous in my attentions to her.â€
â€œthere certainly will be in the way she takes them. but i have said what i had on my conscience,â€ mrs. walker pursued. â€œif you wish to rejoin the young lady

 parasol out of her hands and opened it. she came a little nearer, and he held the parasol over her; then, still holding it, he let it rest upon her shoulder, so that both of their heads were hidden from winterbourne. this young man lingered a moment, then he began to walk. but he walkedâ€”not toward the couple with the parasol; toward the residence of his aunt, mrs. costello.
he flattered himself on the following day that there was no smiling among the servants when he, at least, asked for mrs. miller at her hotel. this lady and her daughter, however, were not at home; and on the next day after, repeating his visit, winterbourne again had the misfortune not to find them. mrs. walkerâ€™s party took place on the evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess, winterbourne was among the guests. mrs. walker was one of those american ladies who, while residing abroad, make a point, in their own phrase, of studying european society, and she had on t

his occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. when winterbourne arrived, daisy miller was not there, but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. mrs. millerâ€™s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. as she approached mrs. walker, winterbourne also drew near.
â€œyou see, iâ€™ve come all alone,â€ said poor mrs. miller. â€œiâ€™m so frightened; i donâ€™t know what to do. itâ€™s the first time iâ€™ve ever been to a party alone, especially in this country. i wanted to bring randolph or eugenio, or someone, but daisy just pushed me off by myself. i ainâ€™t used to going round alone.â€
â€œand does not your daughter intend to favor us with her society?â€ demanded mrs. walker impressively.
â€œwell, daisyâ€™s all dressed,â€ said mrs. miller with that accent of the dispassionate, if not of the philosophic, historia

â€œiâ€™m sorry she should come in that way,â€ said mrs. walker.
â€œwell, i told her that there was no use in her getting dressed before dinner if she was going to wait three hours,â€ responded daisyâ€™s mamma. â€œi didnâ€™t see the use of her putting on such a dress as that to sit round with mr. giovanelli.â€

ned.
â€œi prefer weak tea!â€ cried daisy, and she went off with the brilliant giovanelli. she sat with him in the adjoining room, in the embrasure of the window, for the rest of the evening. there was an interesting performance at the piano, but neither of these young people gave heed to it. when daisy came to take leave of mrs. walker, this lady conscientiously repaired the weakness of which she had been guilty at the moment of the young girlâ€™s arrival. she turned her back straight upon miss miller and left her to depart with what grace she might. winterbourne was standing near the door; he saw it all. daisy turned very pale and looked at her mother, but mrs. miller was humbly unconscious of any violation of the usual social forms. she appeared, indeed, to have felt an incongruous impulse to draw attention to her own striking observance of them. â€œgood night, mrs. walker,â€ she said; â€œweâ€™ve had a beautiful evening. you see, if i let daisy come to parties without me, i donâ€™t want h

er to go away without me.â€ daisy turned away, looking with a pale, grave face at the circle near the door; winterbourne saw that, for the first moment, she was too much shocked and puzzled even for indignation. he on his side was greatly touched.
â€œthat was very cruel,â€ he said to mrs. walker.
â€œshe never enters my drawing room again!â€ replied his hostess.
since winterbourne was not to meet her in mrs. walkerâ€™s drawing room, he went as often as possible to mrs. millerâ€™s hotel. the ladies were rarely at home, but when he found them, the devoted giovanelli was always present. very often the brilliant little roman was in the drawing room with daisy alone, mrs. miller being apparently constantly of the opinion that discretion is the better part of surveillance. winterbourne noted, at first with surprise, that daisy on these occasions was never embarrassed or annoyed by his own entrance; but he very presently began to feel that she had no more surprises for him

and her apparently inexhaustible good humor. he could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous. at the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readerâ€™s part, i may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to winterbourne among the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be afraidâ€”literally afraidâ€”of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of daisy miller. it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.
but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli. she looked at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that; she was constantly â€œchaffingâ€ and abusing him. she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs. wal

â€œthatâ€™s what makes you so pensive in these days, eh?â€
â€œi had not the least idea i was pensive,â€ said the young man.
â€œyou are very much preoccupied; you are thinking of something.â€
â€œand what is it,â€ he asked, â€œthat you accuse me of thinking of?â€
â€œof that young ladyâ€™sâ€”miss bakerâ€™s, miss chandlerâ€™sâ€”whatâ€™s her name?â€”miss millerâ€™s intrigue with that little barberâ€™s block.â€
â€œdo you call it an intrigue,â€ winterbourne askedâ€”â€œan affair that goes on with such peculiar publicity?â€
â€œthatâ€™s their folly,â€ said mrs. costello; â€œitâ€™s not their merit.â€
â€œno,â€ rejoined winterbourne, with something of that pensiveness to which his aunt had alluded. â€œi donâ€™t believe that there is anything to be called an intrigue.â€
â€œi have heard a dozen people speak of it; they say she is quite carried away by hi

â€œthe little italian. i have asked questions about him and learned something. he is apparently a perfectly respectable little man. i believe he is, in a small way, a cavaliere avvocato. but he doesnâ€™t move in what are called the first circles. i think it is really not absolutely impossible that the courier introduced him. he is evidently immensely charmed with miss miller. if she thinks him the finest gentleman in the world, he, on his side, has never found himself in personal contact with such splendor, such opulence, such expensiveness as this young ladyâ€™s. and then she must seem to him wonderfully pretty and interesting. i rather doubt that he dreams of marrying her. that must appear to him too impossible a piece of luck. he has nothing but his handsome face to offer, and there is a substantial mr. miller in that mysterious land of dollars. giovanelli knows

 that he hasnâ€™t a title to offer. if he were only a count or a marchese! he must wonder at his luck, at the way they have taken him up.â€
â€œhe accounts for it by his handsome face and thinks miss miller a young lady qui se passe ses fantaisies!â€ said mrs. costello.
â€œit is very true,â€ winterbourne pursued, â€œthat daisy and her mamma have not yet risen to that stage ofâ€”what shall i call it?â€”of culture at which the idea of catching a count or a marchese begins. i believe that they are intellectually incapable of that conception.â€
â€œah! but the avvocato canâ€™t believe it,â€ said mrs. costello.

ndefended, and natural assigned to a vulgar place among the categories of disorder. he made an attempt after this to give a hint to mrs. miller. he met one day in the corso a friend, a tourist like himself, who had just come out of the doria palace, where he had been walking through the beautiful gallery. his friend talked for a moment about the superb portrait of innocent x by velasquez which hangs in one of the cabinets of the palace, and then said, â€œand in the same cabinet, by the way, i had the pleasure of contemplating a picture of a different kindâ€”that pretty american girl whom you pointed out to me last week.â€ in answer to

panion in the secluded nook in which the great papal portrait was enshrined.
â€œwho was her companion?â€ asked winterbourne.
â€œa little italian with a bouquet in his buttonhole. the girl is delightfully pretty, but i thought i understood from you the other day that she was a young lady du meilleur monde.â€
â€œso she is!â€ answered winterbourne; and having assured himself that his informant had seen daisy and her companion but five minutes before, he jumped into a cab and went to call on mrs. miller. she was at home; but she apologized to him for receiving him in daisyâ€™s absence.
â€œsheâ€™s gone out somewhere with mr. giovanelli,â€ said mrs. miller. â€œsheâ€™s always going round with mr. giovanelli.â€
â€œi have noticed that they are very intimate,â€ winterbourne observed.
â€œoh, it seems as if they couldnâ€™t live without each other!â€ said mrs. miller. â€œwell, heâ€™s a real gentleman, anyhow. i keep telling daisy sheâ€™s engaged!â€
â€œand what does daisy say?â€
â€œoh, she says sh

e isnâ€™t engaged. but she might as well be!â€ this impartial parent resumed; â€œshe goes on as if she was. but iâ€™ve made mr. giovanelli promise to tell me, if she doesnâ€™t. i should want to write to mr. miller about itâ€”shouldnâ€™t you?â€
winterbourne replied that he certainly should; and the state of mind of daisyâ€™s mamma struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard.
after this daisy was never at home, and winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived, these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far. they ceased t

o invite her; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant europeans the great truth that, though miss daisy miller was a young american lady, her behavior was not representativeâ€”was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal. winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her, and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all. he said to himself that she was too light and childish, too uncultivated and unreasoning, too provincial, to have reflected upon her ostracism, or even to have perceived it. then at other moments he believed that she carried a

presently the sound of the womanâ€™s voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air. â€œwell, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the christian martyrs!â€ these were the words he heard, in the familiar accent of miss daisy miller.
â€œlet us hope he is not very hungry,â€ responded the ingenious giovanelli. â€œhe will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!â€
winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. it was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of daisyâ€™s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. she was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect. he stood there, looking at herâ€”looking at her compan

ion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been more brightly visible. he felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding miss daisy miller. then, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism. he turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard daisy speak again.
â€œwhy, it was mr. winterbourne! he saw me, and he cuts me!â€
what a clever little reprobate she was, and how smartly she played at injured innocence! but he wouldnâ€™t cu

daisy took her seat in the carriage, and the fortunate italian placed himself beside her. â€œdonâ€™t forget eugenioâ€™s pills!â€ said winterbourne as he lifted his hat.
â€œi donâ€™t care,â€ said daisy in a little strange tone, â€œwhether i have roman fever or not!â€ upon this the cab driver cracked his whip, and they rolled away over the desultory patches of the antique pavement.
winterbourne, to do him justice, as it were, mentioned to no one that he had encountered miss miller, at midnight, in the colosseum with a gentleman; but nevertheless, a couple of days later, the fact of her having been there under these circumstances was known to every member of the little american circle, and commented accordingly. winterbourne reflected that they had of course known it at the hotel, and that, after daisyâ€™s return, there had been an exchange of remarks between the porter and the cab driver. but the young man was conscious, at the same moment, that it had ceased to be a mat

ter of serious regret to him that the little american flirt should be â€œtalked aboutâ€ by low-minded menials. these people, a day or two later, had serious information to give: the little american flirt was alarmingly ill. winterbourne, when the rumor came to him, immediately went to the hotel for more news. he found that two or three charitable friends had preceded him, and that they were being entertained in mrs. millerâ€™s salon by randolph.
â€œitâ€™s going round at night,â€ said randolphâ€”â€œthatâ€™s what made her sick. sheâ€™s always going round at night. i shouldnâ€™t think sheâ€™d want to, itâ€™s so plaguy dark. you canâ€™t see anything here at night, except when thereâ€™s a moon. in america thereâ€™s always a moon!â€ mrs. miller was invisible; she was now, at least, giving her daughter the advantage of her society. it was evident that daisy was dangerously ill.

of her, and once he saw mrs. miller, who, though deeply alarmed, was, rather to his surprise, perfectly composed, and, as it appeared, a most efficient and judicious nurse. she talked a good deal about dr. davis, but winterbourne paid her the compliment of saying to himself that she was not, after all, such a monstrous goose. â€œdaisy spoke of you the other day,â€ she said to him. â€œhalf the time she doesnâ€™t know what sheâ€™s saying, but that time i think she did. she gave me a message she told me to tell you. she told me to

â€œshe would never have married you?â€
â€œfor a moment i hoped so. but no. i am sure.â€
winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the april daisies. when he turned away again, mr. giovanelli, with his light, slow step, had retired.
winterbourne almost immediately left rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, mrs. costello at vevey. mrs. costello was fond of vevey. in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners. one day he spoke of her to his auntâ€”said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice.
â€œi am sure i donâ€™t know,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œhow did your injustice affect her?â€
â€œshe sent me a message before her death which i didnâ€™t understand at the time; but i have understood it since. she would have appreciated oneâ€™s esteem.â€
â€œis that a modest way,â€ asked mrs. costello, â€œof saying that she would have reciprocated oneâ€™s affection?â€
