something 
worth saying too. it's fine to think that you will leave something behind you 
when you die, but it's better to have made something you can die with.

through the fence, between the curling flower spaces, i could see them 
hitting. they were coming toward where the flag was and i went along the 
fence. luster was hunting in the grass by the flower tree. they took the flag 
out, and they were hitting. then they put the flag back and they went to the 
table, and he hit and the other hit. then they went on, and i went along the 
fence. luster came away from the flower tree and we went along the fence 
and they stopped and we stopped and i looked through the fence while

quarter so i can go to the show tonight."  
they were hitting little, across the pasture. i went back along the fence to 
where the flag was. it flapped on the bright grass and the trees.  
"come on." luster said. "we done looked there. they aint no more coming 
right now. les go down to the branch and find that quarter before them 
niggers finds it."  
it was red, flapping on the pasture. then there was a bird slanting and 
tilting on it. luster threw. the flag flapped on the bright grass and the 
trees. i held to the fence.  
"shut up that moaning." luster said. "i cant make them come if they aint 
coming, can i. if you dont hush up, mammy aint going to have no birthday

the fence and pointed his arm. "see them. they aint coming back here no 
more. come on.  
we went along the fence and came to the garden fence, where our shadows 
were. my shadow was higher than luster's on the fence. we came to the 
hroken place and went through it.  

"wait a minute." luster said. "you snagged on that nail again. cant you 
never crawl through here without snagging on that nail."  
4.1 
caddy uncaught me and we crawled through. uncle maury said to not let 
anybody see us, so we better stoop over, caddy said. stoop over, benjy. 
like this, see. we stooped over and crossed the garden, where the flowers 
rasped and rattled against us. the ground was hard. we climbed the 
fence

she opened the gate and came in and stooped 
down. caddy smelled like leaves. "did you come to meet me." she said. 
"did you come to meet caddy. what did you let him get his hands so cold 
for, versh." "i told him to keep them in his pockets." versh said. "holding 
on to that ahun gate."  
"did you come to meet caddy." she said, rubbing my hands. "what is it.

"all right." versh said. "i aint going out in that cold for no fun." he went on 
and we stopped in the hall and caddy knelt and put her arms around me 
and her cold bright face against mine. she smelled like trees.  
"you're not a poor baby. are you. are you. you've got your caddy. haven't 
you got your caddy."

where the carriage was. it had a new wheel.

      i went straight to the kitchen and told dilsey to hurry up with dinner.  
      "quentin aint come yit," she says.  
      "what of that?" i says. "you'll be telling me next that luster's not quite 
ready to eat yet. quentin knows when meals are served in this house. 
hurry up with it, now."  

      mother was in her room. i gave her the letter. she opened it and took 
the check out and sat holding it in her hand. i went and got the shovel from 
the corner and gave her a match. "come on," i says. "get it over with. you'll 
be crying in a minute."  
      she took the match, but she didn't strike it. she sat there, looking at the 
check. just like i said it would be.

i carried it to the grate and put it in. "it just seems a 
shame to me to burn up good money," i says.  
      "let me never see the day when my children will have to accept that, the 
wages of sin," she says. "i'd rather see even you dead in your coffin first."  
      "have it your way," i says. "are we going to have dinner soon?" i says. 
"because if we're not, i'll have to go on back. we're pretty busy today." she 
got up. "i've told her once," i says. "it seems she's waiting on quentin or 
luster or somebody. here, i'll call her. wait." but she went to the head of 
the stairs and called.  
      "quentin aint come yit," dilsey says.  
      "well, i'll have to get on back," i says. "i can get a sandwich downtown. 
i dont want to interfere with dilsey's arrangements," i says. well, that got 
her started again, with dilsey hobbling and mumbling back and forth, 
saying,

      "i try to please you all," mother says. "i try

little country store. i wanted you to get 
ahead. i knew your father would never realise that you were the only one 
who had any business sense, and then when everything else failed i 
believed that when she married, and herbert ... after his promise--"  
      "well, he was probably lying too," i says. "he may not have even had a 
bank. and if he had, i dont reckon he'd have to come all the way to 
mississippi to get a man for it."  
      we ate a while. i could hear ben in the kitchen, where luster was 
feeding him. like i say, if we've got to feed another mouth and she wont 
take that money, why not send him down to jackson. he'll be happier 
there, with people like him. i says god knows there's little enough room for 
pride in this family, but it dont take much pride to not like to see a thirty 
year old man playing around the yard with a nigger boy, running up and 
down the fence and lowing like a cow whenever they play golf over there. i 
says if they'd sent him to jackson at first we

i says. "you want them back?"  
      "no, no," he says. "i just forgot whether i gave them to you or not. no 
sense in wasting them."  
      he locked the door and said goodnight and went on. the sparrows 
were still rattling away in the trees, but the square was empty except for a 
few cars. there was a ford in front of the drugstore, but i didn't even look 
at it. i know when i've had enough of anything. i dont mind trying to help 
her, but i know when i've had enough. i guess i could teach luster to drive 
it, then they could chase her all day long if they wanted to, and i could stay 
home and play with ben.  
      i went in and got a couple of cigars. then i thought i'd have another 
headache shot for luck, and i stood and talked with them a while.  
      "well," mac says. "i reckon you've got your money on the yankees this 
year."  
      "what for?" i says.  
      "the pennant," he says. "not anything in the league can beat them."  
      "like hell there's not," i says. "they're

even remember he didn't and couldn't want any longer. and what he'd

himself and begin to cry like he'd do. but like i say they never did enough 
of that. i says i know what you need you need what they did to ben then 
you'd behave. and if you dont know what that was i says, ask dilsey to tell 
you.  
      there was a light in mother's room. i put the car up and went on into 
the kitchen. luster and ben were there.  
      "where's dilsey?" i says. "putting supper on?"  
      "she up stairs wid miss cahline," luster says. "dey been goin hit. ever

to hear another word about dat show."  
      "that reminds me," i says. "i've got a couple of tickets they gave me." i 
took them out of my coat.

him and opening the stove lid.

      "all right," i says. i dropped one of them in the stove.

      i went on into the living room. i couldn't hear anything from upstairs. i 
opened the paper. after a while ben and luster came in. ben went to the 
dark place on the wall where the mirror used to be, rubbing his hands on it 
and slobbering and moaning. luster begun punching at the fire.  
      "what're you doing?" i says. "we dont need any fire tonight."  
      "i tryin to keep him quiet," he says. "hit always cold easter," he says.

      he put the poker back and got the cushion out of mother's chair and 
gave it to ben, and he hunkered down in front of the fireplace and got 
quiet.

     "you put hit down and g'awn back to bed," dilsey said. she toiled 
painfully up the steps, shapeless, breathing heavily. "i'll have de fire gwine 
in a minute, en de water hot in two mot"    
     "i've been lying there for an hour, at least," mrs compson said. "i 
thought maybe you were waiting for me to come down and start the fire."    
     dilsey reached the top of the stairs and took the water bottle. "i'll fix hit

 into bed again she could hear dilsey yet descending the 
stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would have become 
maddening had it not presently ceased beyond the flapping diminishment 
of the pantry door.    
     she entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began to prepare 
breakfast. in the midst of this she ceased and went to the window and 
looked out toward her cabin, then she went to the door and opened it and 
shouted into the driving weather.    
     "luster!" she shouted, standing to listen, tilting her face from the wind. 
"you, luster!" she listened, then as she prepared to shout again luster 
appeared around the corner of the kitchen.    
     "ma'am?" he said innocently, so innocently that dilsey looked down at 
him, for a moment motionless, with something more than mere surprise.    
     "whar you at?" she said.    
     "nowhere," he said. "jes in de cellar."    
     "whut you coin in de cellar?" she said. "dont stand dar in de rain, fool,

she said.    
     "aint coin nothin," he said. he came up the steps.    
     "dont you dare come in dis do widout a armful of wood," she said. "here 
i done had to tote yo wood en build yo fire bofe. didn't i tole you not to

     "i did," luster said. "i filled hit."    
     "whar hit gone to, den?"    
     "i dont know'm. i aint teched hit."    
     "well, you git hit full up now," she said. "and git on up dar en see bout 
benjy."    
     she shut the door. luster went to the woodpile. the five jaybirds 
whirled over the house, screaming, and into the mulberries again. he 
watched them. he picked up a rock and threw it. "whoo," he said. "git on 
back to hell, whar you belong at. 'taint monday yit."    
     he loaded himself mount

ainously with stove wood. he could not see 
over it, and he staggered to the steps and up them and blundered crashing 
against the door, shedding billets. then dilsey came and opened the door 
for him and he blundered across the kitchen. "you, luster!"hah!"" she 
shouted, but he had already hurled the wood into the box with a 
thunderous crash. "hah!" he said.    
     "is you tryin to wake up de whole house?" dilsey said. she hit him on 
the back of his head with the flat of her hand. "go on up dar and git benjy 
dressed, now."    
     "yessum," he said. he went toward the outer door.    
     "whar you gwine dilsey said.    
     "i thought i better go round de house en in by de front, so i wont wake

ou go on up dem back stairs like i tole you en git benjy's clothes on 
him," dilsey said. "go on, now."    
     "yessum," luster said. he returned and left by the diningroom door. 
after a while it ceased to flap. dilsey prepared to make biscuit. as she 
ground the sifter steadily above the bread board, she sang, to herself at 
first, something without particular tune or words, repetitive, mournful and 
plaintive, austere, as she ground a faint, steady snowing of flour onto the 
bread board. the stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with 
murmurous minors of the fire, and presently she was singing louder, as if

her apron and wiped her hands and caught up the bottle from the chair on 
which she had laid it and gathered her apron about the handle of the kettle 
which was now jetting faintly. "jes a minute," she called. "de water jes dis 
minute got hot."    
     it was not the bottle which mrs compson wanted, however, and 
clutching it by the neck like a dead hen dilsey went to the foot of the stairs 
and looked upward.    
     "aint luster up dar wid him?" she said.    
     "luster hasn't been in the house. i've been lying here listening for him. i 
knew he would be late, but i did hope he'd come in time to keep benjamin 
from disturbing jason on jason's one day in the week to sleep in the 
morning."    
     "i dont see how you expect anybody to sleep, wid you standin in de hall, 
holl'in at folks fum de crack of dawn," dilsey said. she began to mount the 
stairs, toiling heavily. "i sent dat boy up dar half an hour ago."

    mrs compson watched her, holding the dressing gown under her chin. 
"what are you going to do?" she said.    
     "gwine git benjy dressed en bring him down to de kitchen, whar he 
wont wake jason en quentin," dilsey said.    
     "haven't you started breakfast yet?"    
     "i'll tend to dat too," dilsey said. "you better git back in bed swell luster 
make yo fire. hit cold dis mawnin."    
     "i know it," mrs compson said. "my feet are like ice. they were so cold 
they waked me up." she watched dilsey mount the stairs. it took her a long 
while. "you know how it frets jason when breakfast is late," mrs compson 
said.    
     "i cant do but one thing at a time," dilsey said. "you git on back to bed, 
fo i has you on my hands dis mawnin too."    
     "if you're going to drop everything to dress benjamin, i'd better come

your responsibility. you can go away. you dont have to bear the brunt of it 
day in and day out. you owe nothing to them, to mr compson's memory. i 
know you have never had any tenderness for jason. you've never tried to 
conceal it."    
     dilsey said nothing. she turned slowly and descended, lowering her 
body from step to step, as a small child does, her hand against the wall. 
"you go on and let him alone," she said. "dont go in dar no mo, now. i'll 
send luster up soon as i find him. let him alone, now."    
     she returned to the kitchen. she looked into the stove, then she drew 
her apron over her head and donned the overcoat and opened the outer 
door and looked up and down the yard. the weather drove upon her flesh, 
harsh and minute, but the scene was empty of all else that moved. she 
descended the steps, gingerly, as if for silence, and went around the corner 
of the kitchen. as she did so luster emerged quickly and innocently from 
the cella

     dilsey stopped. "whut you up to?" she said.    
     "nothin," luster said. "mr jason say fer me to find out whar dat water 
leak in de cellar fum."    
     "en when wus hit he say fer you to do dat?" dilsey said. "last new 
year's day, wasn't hit?"    

     "i thought i jes be lookin whiles dey sleep," luster said. dilsey went to 
the cellar door. he stood aside and she peered down into the obscurity 
odorous of dank earth and mold and rubber.    
     "huh," dilsey said. she looked at luster again. he met her gaze blandly, 
innocent and open. "i dont know whut you up to, but you aint got no 
business coin hit. you jes tryin me too dis mawnin cause de others is, aint 
you? you git on up dar en see to benjy, you hear?"    
     "yessum," luster said. he went on toward the kitchen steps, swiftly.

     "here," dilsey said. "you git me another armful of wood while i got 
you."    
     "yessum," he said. he passed her on the steps and went to the woodpile. 
when he blundered again at the door a moment later, again invisible and 
blind within and beyond his wooden avatar, dilsey opened the door and 
guided him across the kitchen with a firm hand.    
     "jes thow hit at dat box again," she said. "jes thow hit."    
     "i got to," luster said, panting. "i cant put hit down no other way."    
     "den you stand dar en hold hit a while," dilsey said. she unloaded him a 
stick at a time. "whut got into you dis mawnin? here i vent you fer wood

     "yessum," luster said. he vanished through the swing door. dilsey put 
some more wood in the stove and returned to the bread board. presently 
she began to sing again.    
     the room grew warmer. soon dilsey's skin had taken on a rich, lustrous 
quality as compared with that as of a faint dusting of wood ashes which 
both it and luster's had worn as she moved about the kitchen, gathering 
about her the raw materials of food, coordinating the meal. on the wall 
above a cupboard, invisible save at night, by lamp light and even then 
evincing an enigmatic profundity because it had but one hand, a cabinet 
clock ticked, then with a preliminary sound as if it had cleared its throat, 

struck five times.    
     "eight oclock," dilsey said. she ceased and tilted her head upward, 
listening. but there was no sound save the clock a

nd the fire. she opened 
the oven and looked at the pan of bread, then stooping she paused while 
someone descended the stairs. she heard the feet cross the diningroom, 
then the swing door opened and luster entered, followed by a big man who 
appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would 
not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it. 
his skin was dead looking and hairless; dropsical too, he moved with a 
shambling gait like a trained bear. his hair was pale and fine. it had been 
brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in 
daguerrotypes. his eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers, 
his thick mouth hung open, drool

     "is he cold?" dilsey said. she wiped her hands on her apron and touched 
his hand.    
     "ef he aint, i is," luster said. "always cold easter. aint never seen hit 
fail. miss cahline say ef you aint got time to fix her hot water bottle to 
never mind about hit." "oh, lawd," dilsey said. she drew a chair into the 
corner between the woodbox and the stove. the man went obediently and 
sat in it. "look in de dinin room and see whar i laid dat bottle down," 
dilsey said. luster fetched the bottle from the diningroom and dilsey filled 
it and gave it to him. "hurry up, now," she said. "see ef jason wake now. 
tell em hit's all ready."    
     luster went out. ben sat beside the stove. he sat loosely, utterly 
motionless save for his head, which made a continual bobbing sort of 
movement as he watched dilsey with his sweet vague gaze as she moved 
about. luster returned.    
     "he up," he said. "miss cahline say put hit on de table." he came to the 
stove and spread

watched her, slobbering, making a faint, eager sound.    
     "all right, honey," she said. "here yo breakfast. bring his chair, luster." 
luster moved the chair up and ben sat down, whimpering and slobbering. 
dilsey tied a cloth about his neck and wiped his mouth with the end of it. 
"and see kin you keep fum messin up his clothes one time," she said, 
handing luster a spoon.    
     ben ceased whimpering. he watched the spoon as it rose to his mouth. 
it was as if even eagerness were musclebound in him too, and hunger itself 
inarticulate, not knowing it is hunger. luster fed him with skill and 
detachment. now and then his attention would return long enough to 
enable him to feint the spoon and cause ben to close his mouth upon the 
empty air, but it was apparent that luster's mind was elsewhere. his other 
hand lay on the back of the chair and upon that

tentatively, delicately, as if he were picking an inaudible tune out of the

fingers teased out of the slain wood a soundless and involved arpeggio until 
ben recalled him by whimpering again.    
     in the diningroom dilsey moved back and forth. presently she rang a 
small clear bell, then in the kitchen luster heard mrs compson and jason 
descending, and jason's voice, and he rolled his eyes whitely with 
listening.    
     "sure, i know they didn't break it," jason said. "sure, i know that. 
maybe the change of weather broke it."    
     "i dont see how it could have," mrs compson said. "your room stays 
locked all day long, just as you leave it when you go to town. none of us

anybody's private affairs. i wouldn't put my foot over the threshold, even if 
i had a key."    
     "yes," jason said. "i know your keys wont fit. that's why i had the lock 
changed. what i want to know is, how that window got broken."    
     "luster say he didn't do hit," dilsey said.    
     "i knew that without asking him," jason said. "where's quentin?" he 
said.    
     "where she is ev'y sunday mawnin," dilsey said. "whut got into you de 
last few days, anyhow?"    
     "well, we're going to change all that," jason said. "go up and tell her 
breakfast is ready."    
     "you leave her alone now, jason," dilsey said. "she gits up fer breakfast 
ev'y week mawnin, en miss cahline lets her stay in bed ev'y sunday. you 
knows dat."

     "i cant keep a kitchen full of niggers to wait on her pleasure, much as i'd 
like to," jason said. "go and tell her to come down to breakfast."    
     "aint nobody have to wait on her," dilsey said. "i puts her breakfast in 
de warmer en she--"    
     "did you hear me?" jason said.    
     "i hears you," dilsey said. "all i been hearin, when you in de house. ef

dat way fer, miss cahline?"    
     "you'd better do as he says," mrs compson said. "he's head of the house 
now. it's his right to require us to respect his wishes. i try to do it, and if i 
can, you can too."    
     "'taint no sense in him bein so bad tempered he got to make quentin git 
up jes to suit him," dilsey said. "maybe you think she broke dat window."

     he clapped the receiver back and crossed the diningroom, where the 
scarce broken meal lay cold now on the table, and entered the kitchen. 
dilsey was filling the hot water bottle. ben sat, tranquil and empty. beside 
him luster looked like a fice dog, brightly watchful. he was eating 
something. jason went on across the kitchen.    
     "aint you going to eat no breakfast?" dilsey said. he paid her no 
attention. "go on en eat yo breakfast, jason." he went on. the outer door 
banged behind him. luster rose and went to the window and looked out.    
     "whoo," he said. "whut happenin up dar? he been beatin miss

they heard jason pass the house in his car. then there was no sound in the 
kitchen save the simmering murmur of the kettle and the clock.    
     "you know whut i bet?" luster said. "i bet he beat her. i bet he knock 
her in de head en now he gone fer de doctor. dat's whut i bet." the clock 
tick-tocked, solemn and profound. it might have been the dry pulse of the 
decaying house itself, after a while it whirred and cleared its throat and 
struck six times. ben looked up at it, then he looked at the bulletlike 
silhouette of luster's head in the window and he begun to bob his head 
again, drooling. he whimpered.

hands dangling between his knees, moaning faintly. suddenly he wept, a 
slow bellowing sound, meaningless and sustained. "hush," luster said. he 
turned and lifted his hand. "you want me to whup you?" but ben looked at 
him, bellowing slowly with each expiration. luster came and shook him. 
"you hush dis minute!" he shouted. "here," he said. he hauled ben out of 
the chair and dragged the chair around facing the stove and opened the 
door to the firebox and shoved ben into the chair. they looked like a tug 
nudging at a clumsy tanker in a narrow dock. ben sat down again facing 
the rosy door. he hushed. then they heard the clock again, and dilsey slow 
on the stairs. when she entered he began to whimper again. then he lifted 
his voice.

rove out of the southeast, broken 
overhead into blue patches. upon the crest of a hill beyond the trees and 
roofs and spires of town sunlight lay like a pale scrap of cloth, was blotted 
away. upon the air a bell came, then as if at a signal, other bells took up the 
sound and repeated it.    
     the cabin door opened and dilsey emerged, again in the maroon cape 
and the purple gown, and wearing soiled white elbow-length gloves and 
minus her headcloth now. she came into the yard and called luster. she 
waited a while, then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door, 
moving close to the wall, and looked into the door. ben sat on the steps. 

before him luster squatted on the damp floor. he held a saw in his left 
hand, the blade sprung a little by pressure of his hand, and he was in the 
act of striking the blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had 
been making beaten biscuit for more than thirty years. the saw gave forth 
a single sluggish twang that ceased with

 lifeless alacrity, leaving the blade 
in a thin clean curve between luster's hand and the floor. still, inscrutable, 
it bellied.    
     "dat's de way he done hit," luster said. "i jes aint foun de right thing to 
hit it wid."    
     "dat's whut you doin, is it?" dilsey said. "bring me dat mallet," she 
said.    
     "i aint hurt hit," luster said.    
     "bring hit here," dilsey said. "put dat saw whar you got hit first."    
     he put the saw away and brought the mallet to her. then ben wailed 
again, hopeless and prolonged. it was nothing. just sound. it might have 
been all time and injustice and sorrow become vocal for an instant by a 
conjunction of planets.    
     "listen at him," luster said. "he been gwine on dat way ev'y since you 
vent us outen de house. i dont know whut got in to him dis mawnin."    
     "bring hi

m here," dilsey said.    
     "come on, benjy," luster said. he went back down the steps and took 
ben's arm. he came obediently, wailing, that slow hoarse sound that ships 
make, that seems to begin before the sound itself has started, seems to 
cease before the sound itself has stopped.    
     "run and git his cap," dilsey said. "dont make no noise miss cahline kin 
hear. hurry, now. we already late."    
     "she gwine hear him anyhow, ef you dont stop him," luster said.    
     "he stop when we git off de place," dilsey said. "he smellin hit. dat's 
whut hit is."    
     "smell whut, mammy?" luster said.    
     "you go git dat cap," dilsey said. luster went on. they stood in the cellar 
door, ben one step below her. the sky was broken now into scudding 
patches that dragged their swift shadows up out of the shabby garden, over 
the broken fence and across the yard. dilsey stroked ben's head, slowly and 
steadily, smoothing the bang upon his brow. he

wailed quietly, 

unhurriedly. "hush," dilsey said. "hush, now. we be gone in a minute. 
hush, now." he wailed quietly and steadily.    
     luster returned, wearing a stiff new straw hat with a colored band and 
carrying a cloth cap. the hat seemed to isolate luster's skull, in the 
beholder's eye as a spotlight would, in all its individual planes and angles. 
so peculiarly individual was its shape that at first glance the hat appeared 
to be on the head of someone standing immediately behind luster. dilsey 
looked at the hat.    
     "whyn't you wear yo old hat?" she said.    
     "couldn't find hit," luster said.    
     "i bet you couldn't. i bet you fixed hit last night so you couldn't find hit. 
you fixin to ruin dat un."

     luster went to the cabin. ben wailed quietly.    
     "come on," dilsey said. "dey kin ketch up wid us. we "wine to hear de 
singin." they went around the house, toward the gate. "hush," dilsey said 
from time to time as they went down the drive. they reached the gate. 
dilsey opened it. luster was coming down the drive behind them, carrying 
the umbrella. a woman was with him. "here dey come," dilsey said. they 
passed out the gate. "now, den," she said. ben ceased. luster and his 
mother overtook t

     before they reached the street though she stopped and lifted her skirt 
and dried her eyes on the hem of her topmost underskirt. then they went 
on. ben shambled along beside dilsey, watching luster who anticked along 
ahead, the umbrella in his hand and his new straw hat slanted viciously in 
the sunlight, like a big foolish dog watching a small clever one. they 
reached the gate and entered. immediately ben began to whimper again, 
and for a while all of them looked up the drive at the square, paintless 

house with its rotting portico.    
     "whut's gwine on up dar today?" frony said. "somethin is."

stove was almost cold. while she stood there the clock above the cupboard 
struck ten times. "one oclock," she said aloud. "jason aint comin home. ise 
seed de first en de last," she said, looking at the cold stove. "i seed de first 
en de last." she set out some cold food on a table. as she moved back and 
forth she sang, a hymn. she sang the first two lines over and over to the 
complete tune. she arranged the meal and went to the door and called 
luster, and after a time luster and ben entered. ben was still moaning a 
little, as to himself.    
     "he aint never quit," luster said.    
     "y'all come on en eat," dilsey said. "jason aint comin to dinner." they 
sat down at the table. ben could manage solid food pretty well for himself, 
though even now, with cold food before him, dilsey tied a cloth about his 
neck. he and luster ate. dilsey moved about the kitchen, singing the two 
lines of the hymn which she remembered. "y'all kin g'awn

people were turning peacefully into houses and sunday dinners, and on out 
of town. he thought that. he wasn't thinking of home, where ben and 
luster were eating cold dinner at the kitchen table. something--the 
absence of disaster, threat, in any constant evil--permitted him to forget 
jefferson as any place which he had ever seen before, where his life must 
resume itself.    
     when ben and luster were done dilsey sent them outdoors. "and see 
kin you let him alone swell fo oclock. t. p. be here den."

there was no sound. she returned through the kitchen and out the outer 
door and stopped on the steps. ben and luster were not in sight, but while 
she stood there she heard another sluggish twang from the direction of the 
cellar door and she went to the door and looked down upon a repetition of 
the morning's scene.    
     "he done hit jes dat way," luster said. he contemplated the motionless 
saw with a kind of hopeful dejection. "i aint got de right thing to hit it wid 
yit," he said.    
     "en you aint gwine find hit down here, neither," dilsey said. "you take 
him on out in de sun. you bofe get pneumonia down here on dis wet flo."    
     she waited and watched them cross the yard toward a clump of cedar 
trees near the fence. then she went on to her cabin.

today." there was a hammock made of barrel staves slatted into woven 
wires. luster lay down in the swing, but ben went on vaguely and 
purposelessly. he began to whimper again. "hush, now," luster said. "i 
fixin to whup you." he lay back in the swing. ben had stopped moving, but 
luster could hear him whimpering. "is you gwine hush, er aint you?" 
luster said. he got up and followed and came upon ben squatting before a 
small mound of earth. at either end of it an empty bottle of blue glass that 
once contained poison was fixed in the ground. in one was a withered stalk 
of jimson weed. ben squatted before it, moaning, a slow, inarticulate 
sound. still moaning he sought vaguely about and found a twig and put it 
in the other bottle. "whyn't you hush?" luster said. "you want me to give 

you somethin to sho nough moan about? sposin i does dis.

" he knelt and 
swept the bottle suddenly up and behind him. ben ceased moaning. he 
squatted, looking at the small depression where the bottle had sat, then as 
he drew his lungs full luster brought the bottle back into view. "hush!" he 
hissed. "dont you dast to beller! dont you. dar hit is. see? here. you fixin 
to start ef you stays here. come on, les go see ef dey started knockin ball 
yit." he took ben's arm and drew him up and they went to the fence and 
stood side by side there, peering between the matted honeysuckle not yet 
in bloom.    
     "dar," luster said. "dar come some. see um?"    
     they watched the foursome play onto the green and out, and move to

foursome went on he followed along the fence, bobbing and moaning. one 
said,    
     "here, caddie. bring the bag."    
     "hush, benjy," luster said, but ben went on at his shambling trot, 
clinging to the fence, wailing in his hoarse, hopeless voice. the man played 
and went on, ben keeping pace with him until the fence turned at right 
angles, and he clung to the fence, watching the people move on and away.    
     "will you hush now?" luster said. "will you hush now?" he shook ben's 
arm. ben clung to the fence, wailing steadily and hoarsely. "aint you gwine 
stop?" luster said. "or is you?" ben gazed through the fence. "all right,

shoulder, toward the house. then he whispered: "caddy! beller now. 
"caddy! "caddy! "caddy!    
     a moment later, in the slow intervals of ben's voice, luster heard dilsey 
calling. he took ben by the arm and they crossed the yard toward her.    
     "i tole you he warnt gwine stay quiet," luster said.    
     "you vilyun!" dilsey said. "whut you done to him?"    
     "i aint done nothin. i tole you when dem folks start playin, he git started

     "you come on here," dilsey said. "hush, benjy. hush, now." but he 
wouldn't hush. they crossed the yard quickly and went to the cabin and 
entered. "run git dat shoe," dilsey said. "dont you sturb miss cahline,

 led ben to the bed and drew him 
down beside her and she held him, rocking back and forth, wiping his 
drooling mouth upon the hem of her skirt. "hush, now," she said, stroking 
his head. "hush. dilsey got you." but he bellowed slowly, abjectly, without 
tears; the grave hopeless sound of all voiceless misery under the sun. 
luster returned, carrying a white satin slipper. it was yellow now, and 
cracked, and soiled, and when they gave it into ben's hand he hushed for a 
while. but he still whimpered, and soon he lifted his voice again.    
     "you reckon you kin find t. p.?" dilsey said.    
     "he say yistiddy he gwine out to st john's today. say he be back at fo."

she said. "lewd knows dat. go git it, den," she said, rising. luster scuttled

coat. he wailed steadily. she took the slipper from him and put it away and 
they went out. luster came up, with an ancient white horse in a battered 
and lopsided surrey.    
     "you gwine be careful, luster?" she said.    
     "yessum," luster said. she helped ben into the back seat. he had ceased

     "you set right dar," dilsey said. she went and took the cheekstrap.

garden. he came back with a single narcissus.

luster put a splint on the flower stalk with a twig and two bits of string and 
gave it to ben. then he mounted and took the reins. dilsey still held the 
bridle.    
     "you knows de way now?" she said. "up de street, round de square, to de

     "yessum," luster said. "hum up, queenie."    
     he flapped the lines on queenie's broad back and the surrey lurched 
into motion.    
     "you; luster!" dilsey said.    

     "hum up, dar!" luster said. he flapped the lines again. with 
subterranean rumblings queenie jogged slowly down the drive and turned 
into the street, where luster exhorted her into a gait resembling a 
prolonged and suspended fall in a forward direction.

paired flower upright in his fist, his eyes serene and ineffable. directly 
before him luster's bullet head turned backward continually until the 
house passed from view, then he pulled to the side of the street and while 
ben watched him he descended and broke a switch from a hedge. queenie 
lowered her head and fell to cropping the grass until luster mounted and 
hauled her head up and harried her into motion again, then he squared his 
elbows and with the switch and the reins held high he assumed a 
swaggering attitude out of all proportion to the sedate cropping of 
queenie's hooves and the organlike basso of her internal accompaniment. 
motors passed them, and pedestrians; once a group of half grown 
negroes:    
     "dar luster. whar you gwine luster? to de boneyard?"    
     "hi," luster said. "aint de same boneyard y'all headed fen

     they approached the square, where the confederate soldier gazed with 
empty eyes beneath his marble hand in wind and weather. luster took still 
another notch in himself and gave the impervious queenie a cut with the 
switch, casting his glance about the square. "dar mr jason car," he said, 
then he spied another group of negroes. "les show dem niggers how 
quality does, benjy," he said.    
     "whut you say?" he looked back. ben sat, holding the flower in his fist, 
his gaze empty and untroubled. luster hit queenie again and swung her to 
the left at the monument.    
     for an instant ben sat in an utter hiatus. then h

bellow, his voice mounted, with scarce interval for breath. there was more 
than astonishment in it, it was horror; shock; agony eyeless, tongueless; 
just sound, and luster's eyes backrolling for a white instant. "gret god," he 
said. "hush! hush! gret god!" he whirled again and struck queenie with 
the switch. it broke and he cast it away and with ben's voice mounting 
toward its unbelievable crescendo luster caught up the end of the reins 

and leaned forward as jason came jumping across the square and onto the 
step.    
     with a backhanded blow he hurled luster aside and caught the reins 
and sawed queenie about and doubled the reins back and slashed her 
across the hips. he cut her again and again, into a plunging gallop, while 
ben's hoarse agony roared about them, and swung her about to the right of 
the monument. then he struck luster over the head with his fist.    
     "dont you know a

reached back and struck ben, breaking the flower stalk again. "shut up!" he 
said. "shut up!" he jerked queenie back and jumped down. "get to hell on 
home with him. if you ever cross that gate with him again, i'll kill you!"    
     "yes, suh!" luster said. he took the reins and hit queenie with the end 
of them. "git up! git up, dar! benjy, fer god's sake!"    
     ben's voice roared and roared. queenie moved again, her feet began to 
clop-clop steadily again, and at once ben hushed. luster looked quickly 
back over his shoulder, then he drove on. the broken flower drooped over 
ben's fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as cornice 
and fa&ccirc;ade flowed smoothly once more from left to right, post and 
tree, window and
