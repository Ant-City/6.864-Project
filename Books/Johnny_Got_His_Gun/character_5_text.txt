eave it lying around. do you send it to hospitals
so guys can pick it to pieces and see how an arm works? do you wrap it up in an
old newspaper and throw it onto the junk heap? do you bury it? after all it's part of a
man a very important part of a man and it should be treated respectfully. do you take it
out and bury it and say a little prayer? you should because it's human flesh and it died
young and it deserves a good sendoff.
my ring.
there was a ring on my hand. what have you done with it? kareen gave it to me and
i want it back. i can wear it on the other hand. i've got to have it because it means something
it's important. if you've stolen it i'll turn you in as soon as i get these bandages off
you thieving bastards you. if you've stolen it you're grave robbers because my arm that is
gone is dead and you've taken the ring from it and you've robbed the dead that's what
you've done. where is my ring kareen's ring before i go under again? i want the ring.
you've got the arm isn't that eno

ugh where's my ring kareen's ring our ring please where
is it? the hand it was on is dead and it wasn't meant to be on rotten flesh. it was meant
always to be on my living finger on my living hand because it meant life.

suddenly a shadow fell across them and they both looked up.
"stop that stop it goddam you."
old mike birkman how did he get into the house so quietly was standing above them
in the darkness glaring down.
they both lay there on the sofa and stared up at him. he looked like an overgrown
dwarf because his back was crooked from twenty-eight years in the coal mines of
wyoming. twenty-eight years in the mines with an i.w.w. red card and damning
everybody. he stood and glared down a

"i'll have none of this business going on in my house. you think this is the back seat
of a flivver? now get up like a couple decent people. go on. get up from there k'reen."
kareen got up. she was only five feet one. mike swore it was because she didn't
have enough food when she was a kid but that probably wasn't the truth because her
mother had been small and kareen was perfectly formed and healthy and beautiful so
beautiful. mike was liable to exaggerate when he got excited. kareen looked up at old
mike unafraid.
"he's going away in the morning."
"i know. i know girl. get into the bedroom. both of you. maybe you never get
another chance. go on k'reen."
kareen took one long look at him and then with her head bent as if she were a very
busy child thinking about something walked into the bedroom.
"go on in there boy. she's scared. go in and put your arm arou

he started to go and then he felt mike's grip against his shoulder. mike was looking
straight into his face and even in the dark his eyes could be seen.
"you know how to treat her don't you. she's no whore. you know don't you?"
"yes."
"go to bed boy."
he turned and went into the bedroom.
an electric candle was burning on one side of the bureau. in the corner of the room
beyond the candle kareen was standing. her waist was off lying on a chair beside her.
she was wearing a slip. as he came in she was twisted around and down a little toward
her hip where her hands were trying to undo the fastening of her skirt. she looked up and
saw him and just looked without moving her hands or anything. she looked at him like
she was seeing him for the first time and didn't know whether to like him or not. she
looked at him in a way that made him want to cry.
he walked over and put his arms around he

crowd at the station. the whole place the station and the cars and even the locomotives
were draped with bunting and the children and women mostly carried flags little flags
that they waved vaguely vacantly. there were three bands all seeming to play at once and
lots of officers herding people around and songs and the mayor giving an address and
people crying and losing each other and laughing and drunk.
his mother and his sisters were there and kareen was there and mike was there
muttering goddam fools and glaring at everybody and watching kareen sharply.

 to the way things were melting into each other. sometimes he was
drifting on top of white clouds frightened at his smallness in the midst of a thing so big as
the sky. sometimes he was cushioned in soft pillows that had a way of sliding him feet
first over rough and uneven ground. but mostly he was floating in some backwash of the
colorado river where it wandered through shale city. he was lying in the water of a
river that ran through home long before he came to los angeles long before he met
kareen long long before he went away on a bunting-covered train with the mayor making
speeches.
he was floating on his back. there were willows near the edge of the water and
sweet clover. there was hot sunshine on his face but his stomach and back were cool
from water that had been snow in the mountains not long ago. he was floating there and
thinking about kareen.
it's fine kareen floating here. lie back more like this like that. isn't it nice kareen i
love it i love you. float kareen keep your head

 out of the water so you can breathe. keep
real close to me kareen isn't it swell floating here not going anywhere and not even
caring to go anywhere? just letting the river take care of things. nothing to do and
nowhere to go. being on top of the river cool and hot and thoughtful yet not thinking a
thing.
stay closer kareen. don't go away. closer closer kareen and watch out for the water
coming over your face. i can't turn over on my stomach to swim kareen i can only float
so please don't go so far away. kareen where are you i can't find you and the water was
coming over your face. don't sink kareen don't let the water come over your face. come
back kareen you'll choke you'll fill up like i'm filling up. you'll go down kareen watch
out please watch out. come back kareen. you're gone. you weren't even there. just me
alone in the river with water coming over my nose and mouth and eyes.
the water was washing over his face and he couldn't stop it. it

ng you and you're scared to death only there's nothing to do about it
because you can't run. your legs are stuck in concrete and you can't move a muscle. that
was why he drowned.
he lay there under the water and thought what a shame it is to drown when you're
maybe only six or eight feet from air and sunlight. what a goddam shame it is to drown
when if you could only stand up and stretch your hand above your head you might touch
a willow branch trailing in the water like the hair of a girl like kareen's hair. but when
you're drowned you can't stand up. when you're dead and drowned there's nothing left
except time going on and on like water over your body.
things began to shoot back and forth in front of his eyes. rockets and bombs and
pinwheels and curves of fire and great white flares whirled through his head and sank
into the soft wet part of his brain with a hissing sound. he could hear the hissing very
plainly. it was like the escape of steam from a locomotive. he could hear explosions a

no legs you see.
never again to wiggle your toes. what a hell of a thing what a wonderful beautiful
thing to wiggle your toes.
no no.
if he could only think of real things he would destroy this dream of having no legs.
steamships loaves of bread girls kareen machine guns books chewing gum pieces of
wood kareen but thinking of real things didn't help because it wasn't a dream.
it was the truth.
that was why his head had seemed lower than his legs. because he had no legs.
naturally they seemed light. air is light too. even a toenail is heavy compared to air.
he had no arms and no legs.
he threw back his head and started to yell from fright. but he only started because he
had no mouth to yell with. he was so surprised at not yelling when he tried that

wonderful fragrance of sagebrush carried on the wind across a wide open plain. he would
never again be able to see the faces of people who made you glad just to look at them of
people like kareen. he would never again be able to see sunlight or the stars or the little
grasses that grow on a colorado hillside.
he would never walk with his legs on the ground. he would never run or jump or

he would burn up with it and not be able to make a move. if he should feel an insect

swinging free. when july came and the trout were biting he went up to grand mesa and
talked things over with his father. they had lots to talk about they had learned lots since
the last time they saw each other. it's much better than worrying his father said you worry
so much you don't enjoy life death is better only i wish i knew how your mother was.
each night summer and winter week in and week out he went to sleep with kareen
whispering to her god bless you kareen darling god bless you. i don't know what i'd do
without you here beside me every night the others have all gone and i'm alone except for
you kareen. they slept with his arm around her or her's around him and they always
turned together. they nestled tight against one another and he kissed her in his dreams all
night long.

training camp and eleven months in france so that made her over twenty. then the time
he had lost completely would probably even it up to another year. and now another. and
others to come others and others. kareen must be twenty-two by now. she was at least
twenty-two. three years. it would go on that way as long as he lived. ten more years and
kareen would have lines. a little later and her hair would be gray and then she would be
an old woman an old old woman and the girl at the station would never have existed.
he knew it wasn't true. kareen would never grow old. she was still nineteen. she
would be nineteen forever. her hair would stay brown and her eyes clear and her skin
fresh like rain. he would never let one line mark her face. that was something he could
do for her that no other man on earth could ever do. he could keep her safe bes

according to orders and every sunday was spring. but where would she be—the real
kareen—the kareen out in the world out in time? while he slept with the nineteen
year old kareen every night was the real kareen with somebody else a woman now
perhaps with a baby? kareen grown up and far away having forgotten him . . .
he wished he could be near her. not that he could ever see her not that he wanted her
to see him. but he would like to feel that he was breathing the same air she breathed that
he was in the same country she was in. he remembered the funny excitement inside him
when he used to start out for old mike's house for kareen's house. the closer he got the
sweeter the air seemed. he used to tell himself although he knew it wasn't true that the air

 her house was different because it was near to her.
he had never cared particularly where he was where they had taken him—but
thinking now of kareen he got homesick. his mind was wailing i wish to god i was in
america i wish i was home. it seemed that an american any american was a friend
compared to any englishman or frenchman. that was because he was an american
himself america was his home he had been born there and anyone outside was a stranger.
then he would say to himself what do you care you'll never be able to see or talk or walk
you won't know the difference you might as well be in turkey as america. but that

 why they were there.
the vibrations got heavier and then they stopped and he knew that people were gathered
around his bed more people than ever before had been in his room at the same time. it
was like the first time he went to school and was embarrassed and bewildered with so
many people around. little tremors of expectations ran through his stomach. he was stiff
with excitement. he had visitors.
the first thought that passed through his mind was that they might be his mother and
sisters and kareen. there was just a chance that kareen forever lovely and young was
standing by him was looking down at him was even this minute putting out her hand her
soft and tiny hand her beautiful beautiful hand to touch his forehead.
and then just as he could almost feel the touch of her hand his delight turned
suddenly to shame. he hoped more than anything else in the world that it was not his
mother and sisters and kareen who had come to visit him. he didn't want them to see
him. he didn't want anybody

st run around putting medals on guys and feeling important
and smug about it. how many generals got killed in the war? there was kitchener of
course but that was an accident. how many others? name them name any of the softliving
sonsofbitches and you could have them. how many of them had got all shot up so
they had to live wrapped in a sheet for the rest of their lives? they had a lot of guts
coming around and giving medals.
when he had thought for an instant that his mother and his sisters and kareen might
be standing beside the bed he had wanted to hide. but now that he had generals and big
guys he felt a sudden fierce surging desire for them to see him. just as before he had
started to reach for the medal without an arm to reach with so now he began to blow the
mask off his face without having mouth and lips to blow with. he wanted them to get just
one look at that hole in his head. he wanted them to get their fill of a face that began and
ended with a forehead. he lay there blowing and t

 still he felt her
standing motionless beside his bed looking down and wondering.
then he felt her hand against his forehead. for just a moment she held it there. he
kept on tapping growing angry now and hopeless and feeling like he wanted to throw up.
she began to stroke his forehead in slow gentle motions. she was stroking it in a way she
had never done it before. he felt pity in the softness of her touch. then her hand went
from his forehead clear back through his hair and he remembered that kareen used to do
that sometimes. but he put kareen out of his mind and kept right on tapping because this
was such an important thing that he couldn't stop for pleasant sensations.
the pressure of the hand against his forehead was getting heavier. he realized that
she was trying by the weight of her hand to make him tired so he'd quit tapping. he began
to tap all the harder all the faster to show her that her plan wouldn't work. he could feel
the vertebrae in the back of his neck crack and pop from t

ay to speak. look at him and then let us ask
you if this isn't even more wonderful than all the splendid operations we have performed
upon his stump?
he knew now that he had never been really happy in his whole life. there had been
times when he had thought he was happy but none of them were like this. there was the
time when all year long he had wanted an erector set and when at christmas time he got
it. that was probably as happy as he had ever been while he was a kid. there was the
time when kareen told him she loved him and that was as happy as he had ever been up
to the time the shell exploded and blew him out of the world. but this happiness this new
wild frantic happiness was greater than anything he could conceive. it was a thing so
absolute so towering so out of this world that it hit him almost like delirium. his legs that
were smashed and gone got up and danced. his arms that were rotted these five six seven
years swung fantastically free at his sides to keep time with the dance.
