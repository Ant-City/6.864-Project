    is dirt to him; and, i warrant, helen, to change, would give an
    eye to boot.
  cressida. here comes more.

                 common soldiers pass

  pandarus. asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
    porridge after meat! i could live and die in the eyes of troilus.
    ne'er look, ne'er look; the eagles are gone. crows and daws,
    crows and daws! i had rather be such a man as troilus than
    agamemnon and all greece.
  cressida. there is amongst the greeks achilles, a better man than
    troilus.
  pandarus. achilles? a drayman, a porter, a very camel!
  cressida. well, well.
  pandarus. well, well! why, have you any discretion? have you any
    eyes? do you know what a man is? is not birth, beauty, good
    shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth,
    liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
  cressida. ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in
    the pie, for then the man's date is ou

 ever step,
    exampl'd by the first pace that is sick
    of his superior, grows to an envious fever
    of pale and bloodless emulation.
    and 'tis this fever that keeps troy on foot,
    not her own sinews. to end a tale of length,
    troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
  nestor. most wisely hath ulysses here discover'd
    the fever whereof all our power is sick.
  agamemnon. the nature of the sickness found, ulysses,
    what is the remedy?
  ulysses. the great achilles, whom opinion crowns
    the sinew and the forehand of our host,
    having his ear full of his airy fame,
    grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
    lies mocking our designs; with him patroclus
    upon a lazy bed the livelong day
    breaks scurril jests;
    and with ridiculous and awkward action-
    which, slanderer, he imitation calls-
    he pageants us. sometime, great agamemnon,
    thy topless deputation he puts on;
    and like a strutting player whose conceit

 lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
    to hear the wooden dialogue and sound
    'twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage-
    such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
    he acts thy greatness in; and when he speaks
    'tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquar'd,
    which, from the tongue of roaring typhon dropp'd,
    would seem hyperboles. at this fusty stuff
    the large achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
    from his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
    cries 'excellent! 'tis agamemnon just.
    now play me nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
    as he being drest to some oration.'
    that's done-as near as the extremest ends
    of parallels, as like vulcan and his wife;
    yet god achilles still cries 'excellent!
    'tis nestor right. now play him me, patroclus,
    arming to answer in a night alarm.'
    and then, forsooth, the faint defects of

    achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
    excitements to the field or speech for truce,
    success or loss, what is or is not, serves
    as stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
  nestor. and in the imitation of these twain-
    who, as ulysses says, opinion crowns
    with an imperial voice-many are infect.
    ajax is grown self-will'd and bears his head
    in such a rein, in full as proud a place
    as broad achilles; keeps his tent like him;
    makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war
    bold as an oracle, and sets thersites,
    a slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
    to match us in comparisons with dirt,
    to weaken and discredit our exposure,
    how rank soever rounded in with danger.
  ulysses. they tax our policy and call it cowardice,
    count wisdom as no member of the war,
    forestall prescience, and esteem no act
    but that of hand. the still and mental parts

 hands shall strike
    when fitness calls them on, and know, by measure
    of their observant toil, the enemies' weight-
    why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
    they call this bed-work, mapp'ry, closet-war;
    so that the ram that batters down the wall,
    for the great swinge and rudeness of his poise,
    they place before his hand that made the engine,
    or those that with the fineness of their souls
    by reason guide his execution.
  nestor. let this be granted, and achilles' horse
    makes many thetis' sons.

    as may be in the world. his youth in flood,
    i'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.

  agamemnon. fair lord aeneas, let me touch your hand;
    to our pavilion shall i lead you, first.
    achilles shall have word of this intent;
    so shall each lord of greece, from tent to tent.

    or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil
    to overbulk us all.
  nestor. well, and how?
  ulysses. this challenge that the gallant hector sends,
    however it is spread in general name,
    relates in purpose only to achilles.
  nestor. true. the purpose is perspicuous even as substance
    whose grossness little characters sum up;
    and, in the publication, make no strain
    but that achilles, were his brain as barren
    as banks of libya-though, apollo knows,
    'tis dry enough-will with great speed of judgment,
    ay, with celerity, find hector's purpose
    pointing on him.
  ulysses. and wake him to the answer, think you?
  nestor. why, 'tis most meet. who may you else oppose
    that can from hector bring those honours off,
    if not achilles? though 't be a sportful combat,
    yet in this trial much opinion dwells;

    to steel a strong opinion to themselves?
    which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
    in no less working than are swords and bows

    therefore 'tis meet achilles meet not hector.
    let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares
    and think perchance they'll sell; if not, the lustre
    of the better yet to show shall show the better,
    by showing the worst first. do not consent
    that ever hector and achilles meet;
    for both our honour and our shame in this
    are dogg'd with two strange followers.

    for that will physic the great myrmidon,
    who broils in loud applause, and make him fall

    if the dull brainless ajax come safe off,
    we'll dress him up in voices; if he fail,
    yet go we under our opinion still
    that we have better men. but, hit or miss,
    our project's life this shape of sense assumes-
    ajax employ'd plucks down achilles' plumes.
  nestor. now, ulysses, i begin to relish thy advice;
    and i will give a taste thereof forthwith
    to agamemnon. go we to him straight.
    two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
    must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.

  achilles. i'll heat his blood with greekish wine to-night,
    which with my scimitar i'll cool to-morrow.
    patroclus, let us feast him to the height.

  achilles. how now, thou core of envy!

    idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.

  patroclus. who keeps the tent now?
  thersites. the surgeon's box or the patient's wound.
  patroclus. well said, adversity! and what needs these tricks?
  thersites. prithee, be silent, boy; i profit not by thy talk; thou
    art said to be achilles' male varlet.
  patroclus. male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
  thersites. why, his masculine whore. now, the rotten diseases of
    the south, the guts-griping ruptures, catarrhs, loads o' gravel
    in the back, lethargies, cold palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten
    livers, wheezing lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
    limekilns i' th' palm, incurable bone-ache, and the rivelled fee-
    simple of the tetter, take and take again such preposterous
    discoveries!

    to curse thus?
  thersites. do i curse thee?
  patroclus. why, no, you ruinous butt; you whoreson
    indistinguishable cur, no.
  thersites. no! why art thou, then, exasperate, thou idle immaterial
    skein of sleid silk, thou green sarcenet flap for a sore eye,
    thou tassel of a prodigal's purse, thou? ah, how the poor world is
    pest'red with such water-flies-diminutives of nature!
  patroclus. out, gall!
  thersites. finch egg!
  achilles. my sweet patroclus, i am thwarted quite
    from my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
    here is a letter from queen hecuba,
    a token from her daughter, my fair love,
    both taxing me and gaging me to keep
    an oath that i have sworn. i will not break it.
    fall greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
    my major vow lies here, this i'll obey.
    come, come, thersites, help to trim my tent;
    this night in banqueting must all be spent.
    away, patroclus!

    crafty swearing rascals-that stale old mouse-eaten dry cheese,

    blackberry. they set me up, in policy, that mongrel cur, ajax,
    against that dog of as bad a kind, achilles; and now is the cur,
    ajax prouder than the cur achilles, and will not arm to-day;
    whereupon the grecians begin to proclaim barbarism, and policy
    grows into an ill opinion.
