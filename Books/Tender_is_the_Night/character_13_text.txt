cious courage, us-ually, something like a
lion, something like a drunken man.’
nicole waited until the echo of his boast had died away
in his mind—she knew he had probably never made such a
statement before. then she looked among the strangers, and
found as usual, the fierce neurotics, pretending calm, liking
the country only in horror of the city, of the sound of their
own voices which had set the tone and pitch... . she asked:
‘who is the woman in white?’
‘the one who was beside me? lady caroline siblybiers.’—they
listened for a moment to her voice across the
way:
‘the man’s a scoundrel, but he’s a cat of the stripe. we
sat up all night playing two-handed chemin-de-fer, and he
owes me a mille swiss.’
tommy laughed and said: ‘she is now the wickedest
woman in london— whenever i come back to europe there
is a new crop of the wickedest women from london. she’s
the very latest—though i believe there is now one other
who’s considered almost as wicked.’
nicole glanced

they moved into the dining salon and dick was placed
next to lady sibly-biers. nicole saw that his usually ruddy
face was drained of blood; he talked in a dogmatic voice, of
which only snatches reached nicole:
‘... it’s all right for you english, you’re doing a dance of
death... . sepoys in the ruined fort, i mean sepoys at the
gate and gaiety in the fort and all that. the green hat, the
crushed hat, no future.’
lady caroline answered him in short sentences spotted
with the terminal ‘what?’ the double-edged ‘quite!’ the
depressing ‘cheerio!’ that always had a connotation of imminent
peril, but dick appeared oblivious to the warning
signals. suddenly he made a particularly vehement pro-

nouncement, the purport of which eluded nicole, but she
saw the young woman turn dark and sinewy, and heard her
answer sharply:
‘after all a chep’s a chep and a chum’s a chum.’

there was a young lady from hell—‘
‘what is all this?’ whispered tommy to nicole.
the girl on the other side of him supplied the answer:
‘caroline sibly-biers wrote the words. he wrote the music.’
‘quelle enfanterie!’ tommy murmured as the next verse
began, hinting at the jumpy lady’s further predilections.
‘on dirait qu’il récite racine!’
on the surface at least, lady caroline was paying no at-
396 tender is the night
tention to the performance of her work. glancing at her
again nicole found herself impressed, neither with the
character nor the personality, but with the sheer strength
derived from an attitude; nicole thought that she was formidable,
and she was confirmed in this point of view as the
party rose from table. dick remained in his seat wearing an
odd expression; then he crashed into words with a harsh
ineptness.
‘i don’t like innuendo in these deafeni

ng english whispers.’
already half-way out of the room lady caroline turned
and walked back to him; she spoke in a low clipped voice
purposely audible to the whole company.
‘you came to me asking for it—disparaging my countrymen,
disparaging my friend, mary minghetti. i simply said
you were observed associating with a questionable crowd
in lausanne. is that a deafening whisper? or does it simply
deafen you?’
‘it’s still not loud enough,’ said dick, a little too late. ‘so i
am actually a notorious—‘

 colossal paws. nicole and tommy
joined them and tommy remarked: ‘dick seems to be
drinking.’
‘only moderately,’ she said loyally.
‘there are those who can drink and those who can’t. obviously
dick can’t. you ought to tell him not to.’
‘i!’ she exclaimed in amazement. ‘i tell dick what he
should do or shouldn’t do!’
but in a reticent way dick was still vague and sleepy
when they reached the pier at cannes. golding buoyed him
down into the launch of the margin whereupon lady caroline
shifted her place conspicuously. on the dock he bowed
good-by with exaggerated formality, and for a moment he
seemed about to speed her with a salty epigram, but the
bone of tommy’s arm went into the soft part of his and they
walked to the attendant car.
‘i’ll drive you home,’ tommy suggested.
‘don’t bother—we can get a cab.’
‘i’d like to, if you can put me up.’
on the back seat of the car dick remained quiescent until
the yellow monolith of golfe juan was passed, and then

what offense they could have committed; then she slept. a
little after three when dick came in she sat up stark awake
saying, ‘what?’ as if to a character in her dream.
‘it was an extraordinary story—‘ dick said. he sat on the
foot of her bed, telling her how he had roused old gausse
from an alsatian coma, told him to clean out his cash drawer,
and driven with him to the police station.
‘i don’t like to do something for that anglaise,’ gausse
grumbled.
mary north and lady caroline, dressed in the costume
of french sailors, lounged on a bench outside the two dingy
cells. the latter had the outraged air of a briton who momentarily
expected the mediterranean fleet to steam up to

her assistance. mary minghetti was in a condition of panic
and collapse—she literally flung herself at dick’s stomach
as though that were the point of greatest association, imploring
him to do something. meanwhile the chief of police
explained the matter to gausse who li

stened to each word
with reluctance, divided between being properly appreciative
of the officer’s narrative gift and showing that, as the
perfect servant, the story had no shocking effect on him. ‘it
was merely a lark,’ said lady caroline with scorn. ‘we were
pretending to be sailors on leave, and we picked up two silly
girls. they got the wind up and made a rotten scene in a
lodging house.’
dick nodded gravely, looking at the stone floor, like a
priest in the confessional—he was torn between a tendency
to ironic laughter and another tendency to order fifty
stripes of the cat and a fortnight of bread and water. the
lack, in lady caroline’s face, of any sense of evil, except the
evil wrought by cowardly provençal girls a

confounded him; yet he had long concluded that certain
classes of english people lived upon a concentrated essence
of the anti-social that, in comparison, reduced the gorgings
of new york to something like a child contracting indigestion
from ice cream.
‘i’ve got to get out before hosain hears about this,’ mary
pleaded. ‘dick, you can always arrange things—you always
could. tell ‘em we’ll go right home, tell ‘em we’ll pay anything.’
‘i shall not,’ said lady caroline disdainfully. ‘not a shilling.
but i shall jolly well find out what the consulate in 
free ebooks at planet ebook.com 443
cannes has to say about this.’
‘no, no!’ insisted mary. ‘we’ve got to get out to-night.’
‘i’ll see what i can do,’ said dick, and added, ‘but money
will certainly have to change hands.’ looking at them as
though they were the innocents that he knew they were not,
he shook his head: ‘of all the crazy stunts!’
lady caroline smiled complacently.

diately. then they can be released on bail on

before the officer spoke dick saw by his expression that it
would be all right. the man said hesitantly, ‘i have made no
entry because they have no cartes d’identité. i must see—
give me the money.’
an hour later dick and m. gausse dropped the women
by the majestic hotel, where lady caroline’s chauffeur slept
in her landaulet.
‘remember,’ said dick, ‘you owe monsieur gausse a hundred
dollars a piece.’
‘all right,’ mary agreed, ‘i’ll give him a check to-morrow—and
something more.’
‘not i!’ startled, they all turned to lady caroline, who,
now entirely recovered, was swollen with righteousness.
‘the whole thing was an outrage. by no means did i authorize
you to give a hundred dollars to those people.’
little gausse stood beside the car, his eyes blazing s

uddenly.
‘you won’t pay me?’
‘of course she will,’ said dick.
suddenly the abuse that gausse had once endured as a
bus boy in london flamed up and he walked through the
moonlight up to lady caroline.
he whipped a string of condemnatory words about her,
and as she turned away with a frozen laugh, he took a step
after her and swiftly planted his little foot in the most celebrated
of targets. lady caroline, taken by surprise, flung up
her hands like a person shot as her sailor-clad form sprawled 
446 tender is the night
forward on the sidewalk.
dick’s voice cut across her raging: ‘mary, you quiet her
down! or you’ll both be in leg-irons in ten minutes!’
on the way back to the hotel old gausse said not a word,
until they passed the juan-les-pins casino, still sobbing and
coughing with jazz; then he sighed forth:
‘i have never seen women like this sort of women. i have
known many of the g

 and see how you like
that! all people want is to have a good time and if you make
them unhappy you cut yourself off from nourishment.’
‘have i been nourished?’ he asked.
mary was having a good time, though she did not know
it, as she had sat down with him only out of fear. again she
refused a drink and said: ‘self-indulgence is back of it. of
course, after abe you can imagine how i feel about it—since
i watched the progress of a good man toward alcoholism—‘
down the steps tripped lady caroline sibly-biers with
blithe theatricality.
dick felt fine—he was already well in advance of the
day; arrived at where a man should be at the end of a good
dinner, yet he showed only a fine, considered, restrained interest
in mary. his eyes, for the moment clear as a child’s,
asked her sympathy and stealing over him he felt the old
necessity of convincing her that he was the last man in the
world and she was the last woman.
... then he would not have to look at those two other figures,
a man and
