Alexander Iden  - 
      Iden is a landholding noble, who, unique among nobles, prefers to stay on his property rather than come to London and deal in the intrigues of the court. Seemingly kinder than the other nobles, Iden has no desire to fight with Jack Cade, who appears in his garden and insults him; but he is forced to fight and kills the starving Cade. Iden's loyalties are always clear; he takes Cade's head immediately to the king.
