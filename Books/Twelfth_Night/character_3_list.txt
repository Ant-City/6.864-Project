Sebastian - 
                	Viola's
lost twin brother. When he arrives in Illyria, traveling with Antonio,
his close friend and protector, Sebastian discovers that many people
think that they know him. Furthermore, the beautiful Lady Olivia, whom
he has never met, wants to marry him. Sebastian is not as well rounded
a character as his sister. He seems to exist to take on the role
that Viola fills while disguised as Cesario--namely, the mate for
Olivia.
