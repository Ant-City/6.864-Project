there for emergencies. it was a demure little number, barely translucent and with bustle and bust pads so
subdued that they merely re-created the effect she would have produced had she been wearing nothing.
the dress had cost her a month's pay and did not look it, its subtle power being concealed like
knock-out drops in a drink. jill looked at herself with satisfaction and took the bounce tube up to the
roof.
 there she pulled her cape around her against the wind and was looking for ben caxton when the
roof orderly touched her arm. "there is a car over there paging you, miss boardman-that talbot saloon."
 "thanks, jack." she saw the taxi spotted for take-off, with its door open. she went to it, climbed
in, and was about to hand ben a backhanded compliment on gallantry when she saw that he was not
inside. the taxi was on automatic; its door closed and it took to the air, swung out of the circle, and
sliced across the potomac. jill sat back and waited.

 everyone knows that jails and hospitals have one thing in common: they both can be very hard to
get out of. in some ways a prisoner is less cut off than a patient; a prisoner can send for his lawyer, can
demand a fair witness, he can invoke habeas corpus and require the jailor to show cause in open court.
 but it takes only a simple no visitors sign, ordered by one of the medicine men of our
peculiar tribe, to consign a hospital patient to oblivion more thoroughly than ever was the man in the

ony broadcast of the night before had made her jumpy about showing curiosity; she
decided to wait until lunch and see what she could pick up on the gossip grapevine.
 but first jill went to the floor's public booth and called ben. his office informed her that mr.
caxton had just left town, to be gone a few days. she was startled almost speechless by this-then pulled
herself together and left word for ben to call her.
 she then called his home. he was not there; she recorded the same message.


 ben caxton had wasted no time in preparing his attempt to force his way into the presence of
valentine michael smith. he was lucky in being able to retain james oliver cavendish as his fair
witness. while any fair witness would do, the prestige of cavendish was such that a lawyer was hardly
necessary-the old gentleman had testified many times before the high court of the federation and it was
said that the wills locked up in his head represented not billions but trillions. cavendish had received his

 or was he? a fretful suspicion that had been burrowing around in her subconscious all day finally

town without letting her know the outcome of his attempt to see the man from mars. as a fellow
conspirator it was her right to receive a report and ben always played fair . . . always.

 harshaw stuck the headpiece in his ears, started sounding for heart beat. "i'm afraid you're
mistaken," he said gently to jill. "this one is beyond my help. who was he?"
 jill sighed. her face was drained of expression and she answered in a fiat voice, "he was the
man from mars. i tried so hard."
 "i'm sure you did-the man from mars?"
 "yes. ben ... ben caxton said you were the one to come to."

 "that's right. all of them are your friends. don't worry-and don't go away again. everything is all

 he did not answer but lay still with his eyes open, staring at everything and everyone around him.
he seemed as content as a cat in a lap.
 twenty-five minutes later harshaw had both of his patients in bed. jill had managed to tell him,
before the pill he gave her took hold, enough of the situation to let him know that he had a bear by the
tail. ben caxton was missing-he'd have to try to figure out something to do about that- and young smith
was as hot as a dry bearing . . . although he had been able to guess that when he heard who he was. oh,
well, life might be amusing for a while; it would keep back that grey boredom that lay always just around
the corner.
 he looked at the little utility car that jill had arrived in. lettered across its sides was: reading

 "but i thought you said-"
 "i said i was not interested in a web of legal fictions. but a patient and guest under my roof is
another matter. he can stay, if he likes. i just wanted to make it clear that i had no intention of meddling
with politics to suit any romantic notions you or ben caxton may have. my dear, i used to think i was
serving humanity . . . and i pleasured in the thought. then i discovered that humanity does not want to be
served; on the contrary it resents any attempt to serve it. so now i do what pleases jubal harshaw." he
turned to dorcas as if the subject were closed. "time for dinner, isn't it, dorcas? is anyone doing
anything about it?"

eiling. presently the speed
control slipped out of her relaxed fingers, the lights went out, and she slept.
 jubal harshaw did not get to sleep as easily; he was vexed with himself. his initial interest in the
situation had cooled off and reaction had set in. well over a half century earlier he had sworn a mighty
oath, full of fireworks, never again to pick up a stray cat-and now, so help him, by the multiple paps of
venus genetrix, he had managed to pick up two at once no, three, if he counted ben caxton.
 the fact that he had broken his oath more times than there were years intervening did not trouble
him; his was not a small mind bothered by logic and consistency. nor did the mere presence of two more
pensioners sleeping under his roof and eating at his table bother him. pinching pennies was not in him. in
the course of nearly a century of gusty living he had been broke many times, had several times been
wealthier than he now was; he regarded both conditions as he did shifts in the weather, a

 but it was certainly possible, or even probable, that the administration knew exactly where the
man from mars was hiding . . . and for reasons of their own preferred to leave it that way, while they

 if so, how long would it go on? and how long could he keep his defensive "time bomb" armed

 "jubal, i don't like the idea much better than you do."

stand and take it-but instinct and habit won out; he ducked.

man from mars and that he certainly
would get very quick action if he claimed to have the man from mars with him, but he was far from
certain that the resultant action would be a face-to-face hookup with douglas. on the contrary, he
calculated that any mention of smith would kill any chance of reaching douglas but would at once
produce violent reaction from subordinates-which was not what he wanted. he knew from a lifetime of
experience that it was always easier to dicker with the top man. with ben caxton's life very possibly at
stake harshaw could not risk failure through a subordinate's lack of authority or excess of ambition.
 but this soft brush-off was trying his patience. finally he snarled, "young man, if you have no
authority yourself, let me speak to someone who has! put me through to mr. berquist."

on, in order to improve the breed, promote the general welfare, and minimize the ancient insolence of
office; he had seen at once that heinrich had such feet.
 but, if no action developed, harshaw wondered how long he could afford to wait? in addition to
the pending collapse of his "time bomb" and the fact that he had, in effect, promised jill that he would
take steps on behalf of ben caxton (why couldn't the child see that ben probably could not be
helped-indeed, was almost certainly beyond help-and that any direct or hasty action minimized mike's
chance of keeping his freedom?)- in addition to these two factors, something new was crowding him:

waited with his best poker face to see what would happen. douglas stared at him. 0 'ben caxton?'
surely you don't mean that cheap winchell?"
 "the ben caxton i refer to is a newspaperman. he has a column with one of the syndicates."
 "absolutely out of the question!"
 harshaw shook his head. "then that's all, mr. secretary. my instructions are firm and give me no
leeway. i'm sorry to have wasted your time. i beg to be excused now." he reached out as if to switch off
the phone.

accepted harshaw's signature and thumb print on a prepared receipt, then left at once while jill continued
to sob on ben's shoulder.
