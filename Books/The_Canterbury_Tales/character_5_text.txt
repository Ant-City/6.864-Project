either the lonely, cheerless condition of the priest, or the strange
behaviour of the merchant in leaving him to himself.

"well said, by *corpus domini,"* quoth our host;       *the lord's body*
"now longe may'st thou saile by the coast,

who shall now telle first of all this rout
another tale;" and with that word he said,
as courteously as it had been a maid;
"my lady prioresse, by your leave,
so that i wist i shoulde you not grieve,*                        *offend
i woulde deeme* that ye telle should                      *judge, decide
a tale next, if so were that ye would.
now will ye vouchesafe, my lady dear?"
"gladly," quoth she; and said as ye shall hear.


notes to the prologue to the prioress's tale.


1. a thousand last quad year: ever so much evil.   "last" means
a load, "quad," bad; and literally we may read "a thousand
weight of bad years." the italians use "mal anno" in the same
sense.

notes to the prioress's tale


1. tales of the murder of children by jews were frequent in the
middle ages, being probably designed to keep up the bitter
feeling of the christians against the jews. not a few children
were canonised on this account; and the scene of the misdeeds
was laid anywhere and everywhere, so that chaucer could be at
no loss for material.

2. this is from psalm viii. 1, "domine, dominus noster,quam
admirabile est nomen tuum in universa terra."

3. "out of the mouths of babes and sucklings hast

of an afterthought;
while the whole tenor of the introduction confirms the belief
that chaucer composed it as a writer or translator -- not,
dramatically, as a speaker. the story is almost literally
translated from the life of st cecilia in the "legenda aurea."

2. leas: leash, snare; the same as "las," oftener used by
chaucer.

3. the nativity and assumption of the virgin mary formed the
themes of some of st bernard's most eloquent sermons.

4. compare with this stanza the fourth stanza of the prioress's
tale, the substance of which is the same.

5. "but he answered and said, it is not meet to take the
children's bread, and cast it to dogs.  and she said, truth, lord:
yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their master's
table." --  matthew xv. 26, 27.

6.  see note 1.

7. these are latin puns: heaven's lily - "coeli lilium"; the way
of blind - "caeci via";  heaven and lia - from "coeli", heaven,
and "ligo," to bind; heaven and leos - from coeli and "laos,"

chaucer's tale of meliboeus.

73. swart: black; german, "schwarz."

74. tewell: the pipe, chimney, of the furnace; french "tuyau."
in the prologue to the canterbury tales, the monk's head is
described as steaming like a lead furnace.

75. tetches: blemishes, spots; french, "tache."

76. for the story of belle isaude see note 21 to the assembly of
fowls.

77. quern:  mill. see note 6 to the monk's tale.

78. to put an ape into one's hood, upon his head, is to befool
him; see the prologue  to the prioresses's tale, l.6.

79. obviously chaucer should have said the temple of diana, or
artemis (to whom, as goddess of the moon, the egyptian isis
corresponded), at ephesus. the building, famous for its
splendour, was set on fire, in b.c. 356, by erostatus, merely
that he might perpetuate his name.

80. "now do our los be blowen swithe,
     as wisly be thou ever blithe." i.e.
cause our renown to be blown abroad quickly, as surely as you
wish to be glad.

81. the labyrinth at cnossus in crete, construc

er, as a prayer for her private use, being a
woman in her religion very devout." it was first printed in
speght's edition of 1597.

2. la priere de nostre dame: french, "the prayer of our
lady."

3. thieves seven: i.e. the seven deadly sins

4. mary's name recalls the waters of "marah" or bitterness
(exod. xv. 23), or the prayer of naomi in her grief that she
might be called not naomi, but "mara" (ruth i. 20). mary,
however, is understood to mean "exalted."

5. a typical representation. see the prioress's tale, third
stanza.

6. the reference evidently is to luke i. 38 -- "ecce ancilla
domini," ("behold the handmaid of the lord") the virgin's
humble answer to gabriel at the annunciation.

7. "xpe" represents the greek letters chi rho epsilon, and is a
contraction for "christe."

8. according to tradition, the soldier who struck the saviour to
the heart with his spear was named longeus, and was blind;
but, touching his eyes by chance with the mingled blood and
water that flowed down the shaft u
