Edmund Mortimer, called the Earl of March  - 
The Welsh rebel Owain Glyndwr's
son-in-law. Mortimer is a conflation of two separate historical
figures: Mortimer and the Earl of March. For Shakespeare's purposes,
Mortimer matters because he had a strong claim to the throne of England
before King Henry overthrew the previous king, Richard II.
