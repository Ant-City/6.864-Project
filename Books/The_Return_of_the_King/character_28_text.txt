tall pages were now almost filled. at the beginning there were many leaves covered with bilbo’s thin wandering hand; but most of it was written in frodo’s firm flowing script. it was divided into chapters but chapter 80 was unfinished, and after that were some blank leaves. the title page had many titles on it, crossed out one after another, so:
my diary. my unexpected journey. there and back again. and what happened after.
adventures of five hobbits. the tale of the great ring, compiled by bilbo baggins from his own observations and the accounts of his friends. what we did in the war of the ring.
here bilbo’s hand ended and frodo had written:
the downfall
of the
lord of the rings
and the
return of the king
(as seen by the little people; being the memoirs of bilbo and frodo of the shire, supplemented by the accounts of their friends and the learning of the wise.)
together with extracts from books of lore translated by bilbo in rivendell.
