nd he passed by without any words.  i marvel, said
arthur, that the knight would not speak.  sir, said merlin, he saw
you not; for and he had seen you ye had not lightly departed.  so
they came unto carlion, whereof his knights were passing glad.
and when they heard of his adventures they marveled that he would
jeopard his person so alone.  but all men of worship said it was
merry to be under such a chieftain that would put his person in
adventure as other poor knights did.”



chapter iv

sir dinadan the humorist

it seemed to me that this quaint lie was most simply and beautifully
told; but then i had heard it only once, and that makes a difference;
it was pleasant to the others when it was fresh, no doubt.

sir dinadan the humorist was the first to awake, and he soon roused
the rest with a practical joke of a sufficiently poor quality.
he tied some metal mugs to a dog’s tail and turned him loose,
and he tore around and around the place in a frenzy of fright,
with all the other dogs bell

owing after him and battering and
crashing against everything that came in their way and making
altogether a chaos of confusion and a most deafening din and
turmoil; at which every man and woman of the multitude laughed
till the tears flowed, and some fell out of their chairs and
wallowed on the floor in ecstasy.  it was just like so many children.
sir dinadan was so proud of his exploit that he could not keep
from telling over and over again, to weariness, how the immortal
idea happened to occur to him; and as is the way with humorists
of his breed, he was still laughing at it after everybody else had
got through.  he was so set up that he concluded to make a speech
--of course a humorous speech.  i think i never heard so many old
played-out jokes strung together in my life.  he was worse than
the minstrels, worse than the clown in the circus.  it s

dred years before i was
born, and listen again to poor, flat, worm-eaten jokes that had
given me the dry gripes when i was a boy thirteen hundred years
afterwards.  it about convinced me that there isn’t any such thing
as a new joke possible.  everybody laughed at these antiquities
--but then they always do; i had noticed that, centuries later.
however, of course the scoffer didn’t laugh--i mean the boy.  no,
he scoffed; there wasn’t anything he wouldn’t scoff at. he said
the most of sir dinadan’s jokes were rotten and the rest were
petrified.  i said “petrified” was good; as i believed, myself,
that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of
those jokes was by geologic periods.  but that neat idea hit
the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn’t been invented yet.
however, i made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate
the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through.  it is no use
to throw a good thing away merely because the market isn’t ripe yet.

 sir lionel,
  and there sir pertolope the green knight smote down sir
  lionel, brother to sir launcelot.  all this was marked
  by noble heralds, who bare him best, and their names.
  then sir bleobaris brake his spear upon sir gareth,
  but of that stroke sir bleobaris fell to the earth.
  when sir galihodin saw that, he bad sir gareth keep him,
  and sir gareth smote him to the earth.  then sir galihud
  gat a spear to avenge his brother, and in the same wise
  sir gareth served him, and sir dinadan and his brother
  la cote male taile, and sir sagramore le disirous, and
  sir dodinas le savage; all these he bare down with one
  spear.  when king aswisance of ireland saw sir gareth
  fare so he marvelled what he might be, that one time
  seemed green, and another time, at his again coming,
  he seemed blue.  and thus at every course that he rode
  to and fro he changed his color, so that there might
  neither king nor knight have ready cognizance of him.
  then sir agwisance the king of ir

report.  you will have noticed
that garry was doing some great fighting in the engagement.  when
i say garry i mean sir gareth.  garry was my private pet name
for him; it suggests that i had a deep affection for him, and that
was the case.  but it was a private pet name only, and never spoken
aloud to any one, much less to him; being a noble, he would not
have endured a familiarity like that from me.  well, to proceed:
i sat in the private box set apart for me as the king’s minister.
while sir dinadan was waiting for his turn to enter the lists,
he came in there and sat down and began to talk; for he was always
making up to me, because i was a stranger and he liked to have
a fresh market for his jokes, the most of them having reached that
stage of wear where the teller has to do the laughing himself while
the other person looks sick.  i had always responded to his efforts
as well as i could, and felt a very deep and real kindness for him,
too, for the reason that if by malice of fate he knew

i closed up alongside of a burly fellow with a fat good-humored
face, purposing to make myself agreeable and pick up some further
crumbs of fact; but i had hardly more than scraped acquaintance
with him when he began eagerly and awkwardly to lead up, in the
immemorial way, to that same old anecdote--the one sir dinadan
told me, what time i got into trouble with sir sagramor and was
challenged of him on account of it.  i excused myself and dropped
to the rear of the procession, sad at heart, willing to go hence
from this troubled life, this vale of tears, this brief day of
broken rest, of cloud and storm, of weary struggle and monotonous
defeat; and yet shrinking from the change, as remembering how long
eternity is, and how many have wended thither who know that anecdote.

early in the afternoon we overtook an

any way to misunderstand the language
of that challenge.  even the dullest of the chivalry perceived
that this was a plain case of “put up, or shut up.”  they were
wise and did the latter.  in all the next three years they gave
me no trouble worth mentioning.

consider the three years sped.  now look around on england.  a happy
and prosperous country, and strangely altered.  schools everywhere,
and several colleges; a number of pretty good newspapers.  even
authorship was taking a start; sir dinadan the humorist was first
in the field, with a volume of gray-headed jokes which i had been
familiar with during thirteen centuries.  if he had left out that
old rancid one about the lecturer i wouldn’t have said anything;
but i couldn’t stand that one.  i suppressed the book and hanged
the author.

slavery was dead and gone; all men were equal before the law;
taxation had been equalized.  the telegraph, the telephone, the
phonograph, the typewriter, the sewing-machine, and all the thousand
