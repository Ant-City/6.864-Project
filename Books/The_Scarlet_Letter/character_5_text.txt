ter to fast and
pray upon it; and still better, it may be, to leave the mystery
as we find it, unless providence reveal it of its own accord.
thereby, every good christian man hath a title to show a
father's kindness towards the poor, deserted babe."

the affair being so satisfactorily concluded, hester prynne,
with pearl, departed from the house.  as they descended the
steps, it is averred that the lattice of a chamber-window was
thrown open, and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of
mistress hibbins, governor bellingham's bitter-tempered sister,
and the same who, a few years later, was executed as a witch.

"hist, hist!" said she, while her ill-omened physiognomy seemed
to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house.  "wilt
thou go with us to-night?  there will be a merry company in the
forest; and i well-nigh promised the black man that comely
hester prynne should make one."

"make my excuse to him, so please you!" answered hester, with a
triumphant smile.  "i must tarry at home,

gone with thee into the forest, and signed my name in the black
man's book too, and that with mine own blood!"

"we shall have thee there anon!" said the witch-lady, frowning,
as she drew back her head.

but here--if we suppose this interview betwixt mistress hibbins
and hester prynne to be authentic, and not a parable--was
already an illustration of the young minister's argument against
sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of
her frailty.  even thus early had the child saved her from
satan's snare.

uncovered his eyes and looked about him.  at one of the
chamber-windows of governor bellingham's mansion, which stood at
some distance, on the line of another street, he beheld the
appearance of the old magistrate himself with a lamp in his hand
a white night-cap on his head, and a long white gown enveloping
his figure.  he looked like a ghost evoked unseasonably from the
grave.  the cry had evidently startled him.  at another window of
the same house, moreover appeared old mistress hibbins, the
governor's sister, also with a lamp, which even thus far off
revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face.  she
thrust forth her head from the lattice, and looked anxiously
upward.  beyond the shadow of a doubt, this venerable witch-lady
had heard mr. dimmesdale's outcry, and interpreted it, with its
multitudinous echoes and reverberations, as the clamour of the
fiends and night-hags, with whom she was well known to make
excursions in the forest.

morning light still waxing stronger--old patriarchs would rise
up in great haste, each in his flannel gown, and matronly dames,
without pausing to put off their night-gear.  the whole tribe of
decorous personages, who had never heretofore been seen with a
single hair of their heads awry, would start into public view
with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects.  old governor
bellingham would come grimly forth, with his king james' ruff
fastened askew, and mistress hibbins, with some twigs of the
forest clinging to her skirts, and looking sourer than ever, as
having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride; and good
father wilson too, after spending half the night at a death-bed,
and liking ill to be disturbed, thus early, out of his dreams
about the glorified saints.  hither, likewise, would come the
elders and deacons of mr. dimmesdale's church, and the young
virgins who so idolized their minister, and had made a shrine
for him in their white bosoms, whi

ever meet the black man, mother?"

"and who told you this story, pearl," asked her mother,
recognising a common superstition of the period.

"it was the old dame in the chimney corner, at the house where
you watched last night," said the child.  "but she fancied me
asleep while she was talking of it.  she said that a thousand and
a thousand people had met him here, and had written in his book,
and have his mark on them.  and that ugly tempered lady, old
mistress hibbins, was one.  and, mother, the old dame said that
this scarlet letter was the black man's mark on thee, and that
it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him at midnight,
here in the dark wood.  is it true, mother?  and dost thou go to
meet him in the nighttime?"

"didst thou ever awake and find thy mother gone?" asked hester.
"not that i remember," said the child.  "if thou fearest to leave
me in our cottage, thou mightest take me along with thee.  i
would very gladly go!  but, mother, tell me

ester's bosom.

"i see what ails the child," whispered hester to the clergyman,
and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her
trouble and annoyance, "children will not abide any, the
slightest, change in the accustomed aspect of things that are
daily before their eyes.  pearl misses something that she has
always seen me wear!"

"i pray you," answered the minister, "if thou hast any means of
pacifying the child, do it forthwith!  save it were the cankered
wrath of an old witch like mistress hibbins," added he,
attempting to smile, "i know nothing that i would not sooner
encounter than this passion in a child.  in pearl's young beauty,
as in the wrinkled witch, it has a preternatural effect.  pacify
her if thou lovest me!"

hester turned again towards pearl with a crimson blush upon her
cheek, a conscious glance aside clergyman, and then a heavy
sigh, while, even before she had time to speak, the blush
yielded to a deadly pallor.

"pearl," said she sadly, "look down at thy feet!  there!--b

" cried the minister
to himself, at length, pausing in the street, and striking his
hand against his forehead.

"am i mad?  or am i given over utterly to the fiend?  did i make
a contract with him in the forest, and sign it with my blood?
and does he now summon me to its fulfilment, by suggesting the
performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination
can conceive?"

at the moment when the reverend mr. dimmesdale thus communed
with himself, and struck his forehead with his hand, old
mistress hibbins, the reputed witch-lady, is said to have been
passing by.  she made a very grand appearance, having on a high
head-dress, a rich gown of velvet, and a ruff done up with the
famous yellow starch, of which anne turner, her especial friend,
had taught her the secret, before this last good lady had been
hanged for sir thomas overbury's murder.  whether the witch had
read the minister's thoughts or no, she came to a full stop,
looked shrewdly into his face, smiled craftily, and--though
little given

 he had yielded himself with
deliberate choice, as he had never done before, to what he knew
was deadly sin.  and the infectious poison of that sin had been
thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system.  it had
stupefied all blessed impulses, and awakened into vivid life the
whole brotherhood of bad ones.  scorn, bitterness, unprovoked
malignity, gratuitous desire of ill, ridicule of whatever was
good and holy, all awoke to tempt, even while they frightened
him.  and his encounter with old mistress hibbins, if it were a
real incident, did but show its sympathy and fellowship with
wicked mortals, and the world of perverted spirits.

he had by this time reached his dwelling on the edge of the
burial ground, and, hastening up the stairs, took refuge in his
study.  the minister was glad to have reached this shelter,
without first betraying himself to the world by any of those
strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been
continually impelled while passing through the streets.  he

another shade of the same sentiment, in reference to mr.
dimmesdale, was expressed by a person whose
eccentricities--insanity, as we should term it--led her to do
what few of the townspeople would have ventured on--to begin a
conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in public.  it
was mistress hibbins, who, arrayed in great magnificence, with a
triple ruff, a broidered stomacher, a gown of rich velvet, and a
gold-headed cane, had come forth to see the procession.  as this
ancient lady had the renown (which subsequently cost her no less
a price than her life) of being a principal actor in all the
works of necromancy that were continually going forward, the
crowd gave way before her, and seemed to fear the touch of her
garment, as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds.

unction with hester prynne--kindly as so many now
felt towards the latter--the dread inspired by mistress hibbins
had doubled, and caused a general movement from that part of the
market-place in which the two women stood.

"now, what mortal imagination could conceive it?" whispered the
old lady confidentially to hester.  "yonder divine man!  that
saint on earth, as the people uphold him to be, and as--i must
needs say--he really looks!  who, now, that saw him pass in the
procession, would think how little while it is since he went

trifle, when a woman knows the world.  but this minister.  couldst
thou surely tell, hester, whether he was the same man that
encountered thee on the forest path?"

"madam, i know not of what you speak," answered hester prynne,
feeling mistress hibbins to be of infirm mind; yet strangely
startled and awe-stricken by the confidence with which she
affirmed a personal connexion between so many persons (herself
among them) and the evil one.  "it is not for me to talk lightly
of a learned and pious minister of the word, like the reverend
mr. dimmesdale."

"fie, woman--fie!" cried the old lady, shaking her finger at
hester.  "dost thou think i have been to the forest so many

 the dark.  thou wearest it openly, so
there need be no question about that.  but this minister!  let me
tell thee in thine ear!  when the black man sees one of his own
servants, signed and sealed, so shy of owning to the bond as is
the reverend mr. dimmesdale, he hath a way of ordering matters
so that the mark shall be disclosed, in open daylight, to the
eyes of all the world!  what is that the minister seeks to hide,
with his hand always over his heart?  ha, hester prynne?"

"what is it, good mistress hibbins?" eagerly asked little pearl.
"hast thou seen it?"

"no matter, darling!" responded mistress hibbins, making pearl a
profound reverence.  "thou thyself wilt see it, one time or
another.  they say, child, thou art of the lineage of the prince
of air!  wilt thou ride with me some fine night to see thy
father?  then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his
hand over his heart!"

laughing so shrilly that all the market-place could hear her,
the weird old gentlewoman took her departure.

s difficult to imagine her without it.

"thy mother is yonder woman with the scarlet letter," said the
seaman, "wilt thou carry her a message from me?"

"if the message pleases me, i will," answered pearl.

"then tell her," rejoined he, "that i spake again with the
black-a-visaged, hump shouldered old doctor, and he engages to
bring his friend, the gentleman she wots of, aboard with him.  so
let thy mother take no thought, save for herself and thee.  wilt
thou tell her this, thou witch-baby?"

"mistress hibbins says my father is the prince of the air!"
cried pearl, with a naughty smile.  "if thou callest me that
ill-name, i shall tell him of thee, and he will chase thy ship
with a tempest!"

pursuing a zigzag course across the marketplace, the child
returned to her mother, and communicated what the mariner had
said.  hester's strong, calm steadfastly-enduring spirit almost
sank, at last, on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an
inevitable doom, which at the moment when a passage seemed to
