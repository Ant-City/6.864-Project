™t imagine what a strange feeling it gave me. marilla, have i really
a pretty nose? i know youâ€™ll tell me the truth.â€

â€œyour nose is well enough,â€ said marilla shortly. secretly she thought
anneâ€™s nose was a remarkable pretty one; but she had no intention of
telling her so.

that was three weeks ago and all had gone smoothly so far. and now, this
crisp september morning, anne and diana were tripping blithely down the
birch path, two of the happiest little girls in avonlea.

â€œi guess gilbert blythe will be in school today,â€ said diana. â€œheâ€™s been
visiting his cousins over in new brunswick all summer and he only came
home saturday night. heâ€™s _awâ€™fly_ handsome, anne. and he teases the
girls something terrible. he just torments our lives out.â€

dianaâ€™s voice indicated that she rather liked having her life tormented
out than not.

â€œgilbert blythe?â€ said anne. â€œisnâ€™t his name thatâ€™s written up on the
porch wall with julia bellâ€™s and a big â€˜take noticeâ€™ over them?

andrews--but i did. i just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she
got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.â€

â€œthose pye girls are cheats all round,â€ said diana indignantly, as they
climbed the fence of the main road. â€œgertie pye actually went and put
her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. did you ever? i
donâ€™t speak to her now.â€

when mr. phillips was in the back of the room hearing prissy andrewsâ€™s
latin, diana whispered to anne, â€œthatâ€™s gilbert blythe sitting right
across the aisle from you, anne. just look at him and see if you donâ€™t
think heâ€™s handsome.â€

anne looked accordingly. she had a good chance to do so, for the said
gilbert blythe was absorbed in stealthily pinning the long yellow braid
of ruby gillis, who sat in front of him, to the back of her seat. he
was a tall boy, with curly brown hair, roguish hazel eyes, and a mouth
twisted into a teasing smile. presently ruby gillis started up to take
a sum to the master; she fell ba

ck into her seat with a little shriek,
believing that her hair was pulled out by the roots. everybody looked at
her and mr. phillips glared so sternly that ruby began to cry. gilbert
had whisked the pin out of sight and was studying his history with the
soberest face in the world; but when the commotion subsided he looked at
anne and winked with inexpressible drollery.

â€œi think your gilbert blythe _is_ handsome,â€ confided anne to diana,
â€œbut i think heâ€™s very bold. it isnâ€™t good manners to wink at a strange
girl.â€

but it was not until the afternoon that things really began to happen.

mr. phillips was back in the corner explaining a problem in algebra to
prissy andrews and the rest of the scholars were doing pretty much as
they pleased eating green apples, whispering, drawing pictures on their
slates, and driving crickets harnessed to strings, up and down aisle.

 was trying to make anne shirley look at him and failing
utterly, because anne was at that moment totally oblivious not only
to the very existence of gilbert blythe, but of every other scholar in
avonlea school itself. with her chin propped on her hands and her eyes
fixed on the blue glimpse of the lake of shining waters that the west
window afforded, she was far away in a gorgeous dreamland hearing and
seeing nothing save her own wonderful visions.

gilbert blythe wasnâ€™t used to putting himself out to make a girl look
at him and meeting with failure. she _should_ look at him, that red-haired
shirley girl with the little pointed chin and the big eyes that werenâ€™t
like the eyes of any other girl in avonlea school.

gilbert reached across the aisle, picked up the end of anneâ€™s long red
braid, held it out at armâ€™s length and said in a piercing whisper:

â€œcarrots! carrots!â€

then anne looked at him with a vengeance!

she did more than look. she sp

 temper,â€ and then read it out loud so that even the primer class,
who couldnâ€™t read writing, should understand it.

anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.
she did not cry or hang her head. anger was still too hot in her heart
for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. with
resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike dianaâ€™s
sympathetic gaze and charlie sloaneâ€™s indignant nods and josie pyeâ€™s
malicious smiles. as for gilbert blythe, she would not even look at him.
she would _never_ look at him again! she would never speak to him!!

when school was dismissed anne marched out with her red head held high.
gilbert blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.

â€œiâ€™m awfully sorry i made fun of your hair, anne,â€ he whispered
contritely. â€œhonest i am. donâ€™t be mad for keeps, now.â€

anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. â€œoh
how could you, anne?â€ breathed diana as they went down the road h

reproachfully, half admiringly. diana felt that _she_ could never have
resisted gilbertâ€™s plea.

â€œi shall never forgive gilbert blythe,â€ said anne firmly. â€œand mr.
phillips spelled my name without an e, too. the iron has entered into my
soul, diana.â€

diana hadnâ€™t the least idea what anne meant but she understood it was
something terrible.

â€œyou mustnâ€™t mind gilbert making fun of your hair,â€ she said soothingly.
â€œwhy, he makes fun of all the girls. he laughs at mine because itâ€™s
so black. heâ€™s called me a crow a dozen times; and i never heard him
apologize for anything before, either.â€

â€œthereâ€™s a gre

at deal of difference between being called a crow and
being called carrots,â€ said anne with dignity. â€œgilbert blythe has hurt
my feelings _excruciatingly_, diana.â€

it is possible the matter might have blown over without more
excruciation if nothing else had happened. but when things begin to
happen they are apt to keep on.

avonlea scholars often spent noon hour picking gum in mr. bellâ€™s spruce
grove over the hill and across his big pasture field. from there they
could keep an eye on eben wrightâ€™s house, where the master boarded. when
they saw mr. phillips emerging therefrom they ran for the schoolhous

g a dozen pupils; but it was necessary to do something
to save his word, so he looked about for a scapegoat and found it
in anne, who had dropped into her seat, gasping for breath, with a
forgotten lily wreath hanging askew over one ear and giving her a
particularly rakish and disheveled appearance.

â€œanne shirley, since you seem to be so fond of the boysâ€™ company we
shall indulge your taste for it this afternoon,â€ he said sarcastically.
â€œtake those flowers out of your hair and sit with gilbert blythe.â€

the other boys snickered. diana, turning pale with pity, plucked the
wreath from anneâ€™s hair and squeezed her hand. anne stared at the master
as if turned to stone.

â€œdid you hear what i said, anne?â€ queried mr. phillips sternly.

â€œyes, sir,â€ said anne slowly â€œbut i didnâ€™t suppose you really meant it.â€

â€œi assure you i didâ€--still with the sarcastic inflection which all the
children, and anne especially, hated. it flicked on the raw. â€œobey me at
once.â€

 anne looked as if she meant to disobey. then, realizing
that there was no help for it, she rose haughtily, stepped across the
aisle, sat down beside gilbert blythe, and buried her face in her arms
on the desk. ruby gillis, who got a glimpse of it as it went down,
told the others going home from school that sheâ€™d â€œacksually never seen
anything like it--it was so white, with awful little red spots in it.â€

to anne, this was as the end of all things. it was bad enough to be
singled out for punishment from among a dozen equally guilty ones; it
was worse still to be sent to sit with a boy, but that that boy should
be gilbert blythe was heaping insult on

in this island is coming to.â€

mrs. rachel shook her head, as much as to say if she were only at the
head of the educational system of the province things would be much
better managed.

marilla took mrs. rachelâ€™s advice and not another word was said to anne
about going back to school. she learned her lessons at home, did her
chores, and played with diana in the chilly purple autumn twilights;
but when she met gilbert blythe on the road or encountered him in sunday
school she passed him by with an icy contempt that was no whit thawed by
his evident desire to appease her. even dianaâ€™s efforts as a peacemaker
were of no avail. anne had evidently made up her mind to hate gilbert
blythe to the end of life.

as much as she hated gilbert, however, did she love diana, with all the
love of her passionate little heart, equally intense in its likes and
dislikes. one evening marilla, coming in from the orchard with a basket

father came down to the school and dared mr. phillips to lay a hand on

perfectly sickening; and lizzie wright didnâ€™t speak to mamie wilson
because mamie wilsonâ€™s grown-up sister had cut out lizzie wrightâ€™s
grown-up sister with her beau; and everybody missed anne so and wished
sheâ€™s come to school again; and gilbert blythe--

but anne didnâ€™t want to hear about gilbert blythe. she jumped up
hurriedly and said suppose they go in and have some raspberry cordial.

anne looked on the second shelf of the room pantry but there was no
bottle of raspberry cordial there. search revealed it away back on the
top shelf. anne put it on a tray and set it on the table with a tumbler.

marilla pessimistically expected more trouble since anne had again begun
to go to school. but none developed. perhaps anne caught something of
the â€œmodelâ€ spirit from minnie andrews; at least she got on very well
with mr. phillips thenceforth. she flung herself into her studies heart
and soul, determined not to be outdone in any class by gilbert blythe.
the rivalry between them was soon apparent; it was entirely good natured
on gilbertâ€™s side; but it is much to be feared that the same thing
cannot be said of anne, who had certainly an unpraiseworthy tenacity for
holding grudges. she was as intense in her hatreds as in her loves. she
would not stoop to admit that she meant to rival gilbert in schoolwork,
because that would have been to acknowledge his existence which anne
persistently ignored; but the rivalry was there and honors fluctuated

that concert. i never was to a concert in my life, and when the other
girls talk about them in school i feel so out of it. you didnâ€™t know
just how i felt about it, but you see matthew did. matthew understands
me, and itâ€™s so nice to be understood, marilla.â€

anne was too excited to do herself justice as to lessons that morning in
school. gilbert blythe spelled her down in class and left her clear out
of sight in mental arithmetic. anneâ€™s consequent humiliation was
less than it might have been, however, in view of the concert and the
spare-room bed. she and diana talked so constantly about it all day that
with a stricter teacher than mr. phillips dire disgrace must inevitably
have been their portion.

anne felt that she could not have borne it if she had not been going
to the concert, for nothing else was discussed that day in school. the

into the parlor, a long narrow room out of which the spare room opened.
it was pleasantly warm and dimly lighted by the embers of a fire in the
grate.

â€œletâ€™s undress here,â€ said diana. â€œitâ€™s so nice and warm.â€

â€œhasnâ€™t it been a delightful time?â€ sighed anne rapturously. â€œit must
be splendid to get up and recite there. do you suppose we will ever be
asked to do it, diana?â€

â€œyes, of course, someday. theyâ€™re always wanting the big scholars to
recite. gilbert blythe does often and heâ€™s only two years older than us.
oh, anne, how could you pretend not to listen to him? when he came to
the line,

           â€˜_thereâ€™s another_, not _a sister_,â€™

he looked right down at you.â€

â€œdiana,â€ said anne with dignity, â€œyou are my bosom friend, but i cannot
allow even you to speak to me of that person. are you ready for bed?
letâ€™s run a race and see whoâ€™ll get to the bed first.â€

those recitations so often up in the garret, or iâ€™d never have been able

â€œyes, indeed, you groaned lovely,â€ assured diana.

â€œi saw old mrs. sloane wiping away tears when i sat down. it was
splendid to think i had touched somebodyâ€™s heart. itâ€™s so romantic
to take part in a concert, isnâ€™t it? oh, itâ€™s been a very memorable
occasion indeed.â€

â€œwasnâ€™t the boysâ€™ dialogue fine?â€ said diana. â€œgilbert blythe was just
splendid. anne, i do think itâ€™s awful mean the way you treat gil. wait
till i tell you. when you ran off the platform after the fairy dialogue
one of your roses fell out of your hair. i saw gil pick it up and put
it in his breast pocket. there now. youâ€™re so romantic that iâ€™m sure you
ought to be pleased at that.â€

â€œitâ€™s nothing to me what that person does,â€ said anne loftily. â€œi simply
never waste a thought on him, diana.â€

maid. why didnâ€™t somebody come? where had the girls gone? suppose they
had fainted, one and all! suppose nobody ever came! suppose she grew so
tired and cramped that she could hold on no longer! anne looked at the
wicked green depths below her, wavering with long, oily shadows, and
shivered. her imagination began to suggest all manner of gruesome
possibilities to her.

then, just as she thought she really could not endure the ache in her
arms and wrists another moment, gilbert blythe came rowing under the
bridge in harmon andrewsâ€™s dory!

gilbert glanced up and, much to his amazement, beheld a little white
scornful face looking down upon him with big, frightened but also
scornful gray eyes.

â€œanne shirley! how on earth did you get there?â€ he exclaimed.

without waiting for an answer he pulled close to the pile and extended
his hand. there was no help for it; anne, clinging to gilbert blytheâ€™s
hand, scrambled down into the dory, where she sat, drabbled and furious,

to see. her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. but the
bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering
determination. that scene of two years before flashed back into her
recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. gilbert had
called her â€œcarrotsâ€ and had brought about her disgrace before the whole
school. her resentment, which to other and older people might be as
laughable as its cause, was in no whit allayed and softened by time
seemingly. she hated gilbert blythe! she would never forgive him!

â€œno,â€ she said coldly, â€œi shall never be friends with you, gilbert
blythe; and i donâ€™t want to be!â€

â€œall right!â€ gilbert sprang into his skiff with an angry color in his
cheeks. â€œiâ€™ll never ask you to be friends again, anne shirley. and i
donâ€™t care either!â€

he pulled away with swift defiant strokes, and anne went up the steep,
ferny little path under the maples. she held her head very high, but
she was conscious of an odd feeling of regret

thoroughly grounded,
miss stacy says.â€

â€œi shall take more interest than ever in my studies now,â€ said anne
blissfully, â€œbecause i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queenâ€™s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queenâ€™s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone

 through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all the former could do to keep
her seat and refrain from rushing impulsively after her chum. a lump
came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her
uplifted latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. not for worlds
would anne have had gilbert blythe or josie pye see those tears.

â€œbut, oh, marilla, i really felt that i had tasted the bitterness of
death, as mr. allan said in his sermon last sunday, when i saw diana go
out alone,â€ she said mournfully that night. â€œi thought how splendid it
would have been if diana had only been going to study for the entrance,
too. but we canâ€™t have things perfect in this imperfect world, as mrs.

he thought of moody spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.
heâ€™s such a funny-looking boy with that big fat face, and his little
blue eyes, and his ears sticking out like flaps. but perhaps he will
be more intellectual looking when he grows up. charlie sloane says heâ€™s
going to go into politics and be a member of parliament, but mrs. lynde
says heâ€™ll never succeed at that, because the sloanes are all honest
people, and itâ€™s only rascals that get on in politics nowadays.â€

â€œwhat is gilbert blythe going to be?â€ queried marilla, seeing that anne
was opening her caesar.

â€œi donâ€™t happen to know what gilbert blytheâ€™s ambition in life is--if he
has any,â€ said anne scornfully.

there was open rivalry between gilbert and anne now. previously the
rivalry had been rather one-sided, but there was no longer any doubt
that gilbert was as determined to be first in class as anne was. he was
a foeman worthy of her steel. the other members of the class tacitly
acknowledged their superiority,

e coming year, dimly shadowing their
pathway already, loomed up that fateful thing known as â€œthe entrance,â€
 at the thought of which one and all felt their hearts sink into their
very shoes. suppose they did not pass! that thought was doomed to
haunt anne through the waking hours of that winter, sunday afternoons
inclusive, to the almost entire exclusion of moral and theological
problems. when anne had bad dreams she found herself staring miserably
at pass lists of the entrance exams, where gilbert blytheâ€™s name was
blazoned at the top and in which hers did not appear at all.

but it was a jolly, busy, happy swift-flying winter. schoolwork was
as interesting, class rivalry as absorbing, as of yore. new worlds of
thought, feeling, and ambition, fresh, fascinating fields of unexplored
knowledge seemed to be opening out before anneâ€™s eager eyes.


      â€œhills peeped oâ€™er hill and alps on alps arose.â€


much of all this was due to miss stacyâ€™s tactful, careful, broadminded
guidance. she

the girls say they know they didnâ€™t pass, but i think they did pretty
well. josie says the geometry was so easy a child of ten could do it!
moody spurgeon still thinks he failed in history and charlie says he
failed in algebra. but we donâ€™t really know anything about it and wonâ€™t
until the pass list is out. that wonâ€™t be for a fortnight. fancy living
a fortnight in such suspense! i wish i could go to sleep and never wake
up until it is over.â€

diana knew it would be useless to ask how gilbert blythe had fared, so
she merely said:

â€œoh, youâ€™ll pass all right. donâ€™t worry.â€

â€œiâ€™d rather not pass at all than not come out pretty well up on the
list,â€ flashed anne, by which she meant--and diana knew she meant--that
success would be incomplete and bitter if she did not come out ahead of
gilbert blythe.

with this end in view anne had strained every nerve during the
examinations. so had gilbert. they had met and passed each other on the
street a dozen times without any sign of recog

critics. perhaps, like the white-lace girl, they anticipated amusement
from her â€œrusticâ€ efforts. she felt hopelessly, helplessly ashamed and
miserable. her knees trembled, her heart fluttered, a horrible faintness
came over her; not a word could she utter, and the next moment she would
have fled from the platform despite the humiliation which, she felt,
must ever after be her portion if she did so.

but suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the
audience, she saw gilbert blythe away at the back of the room, bending
forward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to anne at once
triumphant and taunting. in reality it was nothing of the kind. gilbert
was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and
of the effect produced by anneâ€™s slender white form and spiritual face
against a background of palms in particular. josie pye, whom he had
driven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant
and taunting. but anne did not se

she had. she drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage
and determination tingling over her like an electric shock. she _would
not_ fail before gilbert blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,
never, never! her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her
recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest corner of
the room without a tremor or a break. self-possession was fully restored
to her, and in the reaction from that horrible moment of powerlessness
she recited as she had never done before. when she finished there were
bursts of honest applause. anne, stepping back to her seat, blushing
with shyness and delight, found he

how very wicked it must be to take on so about a sinful fellow creature.

anne and the rest of the avonlea scholars reached town just in time to
hurry off to the academy. that first day passed pleasantly enough in a
whirl of excitement, meeting all the new students, learning to know the
professors by sight and being assorted and organized into classes. anne
intended taking up the second year work being advised to do so by miss
stacy; gilbert blythe elected to do the same. this meant getting a
first class teacherâ€™s license in one year instead of two, if they were
successful; but it also meant much more and harder work. jane, ruby,
josie, charlie, and moody spurgeon, not being troubled with the
stirrings of ambition, were content to take up the second class work.
anne was conscious of a pang of loneliness when she found herself in
a room with fifty other students, not one of whom she knew, except the

helped in the wearing by her
weekend visits home. as long as the open weather lasted the avonlea
students went out to carmody on the new branch railway every friday
night. diana and several other avonlea young folks were generally on
hand to meet them and they all walked over to avonlea in a merry party.
anne thought those friday evening gypsyings over the autumnal hills in
the crisp golden air, with the homelights of avonlea twinkling beyond,
were the best and dearest hours in the whole week.

gilbert blythe nearly always walked with ruby gillis and carried her
satchel for her. ruby was a very handsome young lady, now thinking
herself quite as grown up as she really was; she wore her skirts as long
as her mother would let her and did her hair up in town, though she had
to take it down when she went home. she had large, bright-blue eyes,
a brilliant complexion, and a plump showy figure. she laughed a great
deal, was cheerful and good-tempered, and enjoyed the pleasant things of
life frankly.

but she thought
that if gilbert had ever walked home with her from the train, over the
crisp fields and along the ferny byways, they might have had many and
merry and interesting conversations about the new world that was opening
around them and their hopes and ambitions therein. gilbert was a clever
young fellow, with his own thoughts about things and a determination to
get the best out of life and put the best into it. ruby gillis told jane
andrews that she didnâ€™t understand half the things gilbert blythe said;
he talked just like anne shirley did when she had a thoughtful fit on
and for her part she didnâ€™t think it any fun to be bothering about books
and that sort of thing when you didnâ€™t have to. frank stockley had lots
more dash and go, but then he wasnâ€™t half as good-looking as gilbert and
she really couldnâ€™t decide which she liked best!

in the academy anne gradually drew a little circle of friends about
her, thoughtful, imaginative, ambitious students like herself. with the

a heartful of wistful dreams and fancies,
as aerial and rainbow-like as anneâ€™s own.

after the christmas holidays the avonlea students gave up going home
on fridays and settled down to hard work. by this time all the queenâ€™s
scholars had gravitated into their own places in the ranks and
the various classes had assumed distinct and settled shadings of
individuality. certain facts had become generally accepted. it was
admitted that the medal contestants had practically narrowed down
to three--gilbert blythe, anne shirley, and lewis wilson; the avery
scholarship was more doubtful, any one of a certain six being a possible
winner. the bronze medal for mathematics was considered as good as
won by a fat, funny little up-country boy with a bumpy forehead and a
patched coat.

ruby gillis was the handsomest girl of the year at the academy; in the
second year classes stella maynard carried off the palm for beauty, with
small but critical minority in favor of anne shirley. ethel marr was
admitted by all co

seems as if you were doing something when youâ€™re worrying. it would be
dreadful if i failed to get my license after going to queenâ€™s all winter
and spending so much money.â€

â€œ_i_ donâ€™t care,â€ said josie pye. â€œif i donâ€™t pass this year iâ€™m coming
back next. my father can afford to send me. anne, frank stockley says
that professor tremaine said gilbert blythe was sure to get the medal
and that emily clay would likely win the avery scholarship.â€

â€œthat may make me feel badly tomorrow, josie,â€ laughed anne, â€œbut just
now i honestly feel that as long as i know the violets are coming out
all purple down in the hollow below green gables and that little ferns
are poking their heads up in loversâ€™ lane, itâ€™s not a great deal of

old friendship to do it as quickly as possible. if i have failed just
say so, without trying to break it gently; and whatever you do _donâ€™t_
sympathize with me. promise me this, jane.â€

jane promised solemnly; but, as it happened, there was no necessity for
such a promise. when they went up the entrance steps of queenâ€™s they
found the hall full of boys who were carrying gilbert blythe around on
their shoulders and yelling at the tops of their voices, â€œhurrah for
blythe, medalist!â€

for a moment anne felt one sickening pang of defeat and disappointment.
so she had failed and gilbert had won! well, matthew would be sorry--he
had been so sure she would win.

and then!

somebody called out:

â€œthree cheers for miss shirley, winner of the avery!â€

hearty cheers. â€œoh, anne iâ€™m so proud! isnâ€™t

isnâ€™t it splendid to think we all got through even to moody spurgeon and
josie pye?â€

â€œthe newbridge trustees have offered jane their school already,â€ said
diana. â€œgilbert blythe is going to teach, too. he has to. his father
canâ€™t afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means
to earn his own way through. i expect heâ€™ll get the school here if miss
ames decides to leave.â€

anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise. she had not
known this; she had expected that gilbert would be going to redmond
also. what would she do without their inspiring rivalry? would not
work, even at a coeducational college with a real degree in prospect, be

â€œjosie is a pye,â€ said marilla sharply, â€œso she canâ€™t help being
disagreeable. i suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in
society, but i must say i donâ€™t know what it is any more than i know the
use of thistles. is josie going to teach?â€

â€œno, she is going back to queenâ€™s next year. so are moody spurgeon and
charlie sloane. jane and ruby are going to teach and they have both got
schools--jane at newbridge and ruby at some place up west.â€

â€œgilbert blythe is going to teach too, isnâ€™t he?â€

â€œyesâ€--briefly.

â€œwhat a nice-looking fellow he is,â€ said marilla absently. â€œi saw him in
church last sunday and he seemed so tall and manly. he looks a lot like
his father did at the same age. john blythe was a nice boy. we used to
be real good friends, he and i. people called him my beau.â€

anne looked up with swift interest.

â€œoh, marilla--and what happened?--why didnâ€™t you--â€

â€œwe had a quarrel. i wouldnâ€™t forgive him when he aske

ay. iâ€™m not going to take the scholarship. i decided so
the night after you came home from town. you surely donâ€™t think i could
leave you alone in your trouble, marilla, after all youâ€™ve done for me.
iâ€™ve been thinking and planning. let me tell you my plans. mr. barry
wants to rent the farm for next year. so you wonâ€™t have any bother over
that. and iâ€™m going to teach. iâ€™ve applied for the school here--but i
donâ€™t expect to get it for i understand the trustees have promised it to
gilbert blythe. but i can have the carmody school--mr. blair told me
so last night at the store. of course that wonâ€™t be quite as nice or
convenient as if i had the avonlea school. but i can board home and
drive myself over to carmody and back, in the warm weather at least. and
even in winter i can come home fridays. weâ€™ll keep a horse for that. oh,
i have it all planned out, marilla. and iâ€™ll read to you and keep you
cheered up. you shaâ€™nâ€™t be dull or lonesome. and weâ€™ll be real cozy and
happy he

t. oh, iâ€™m not going to overdo
things. as â€˜josiah allenâ€™s wife,â€™ says, i shall be â€˜mejumâ€™. but iâ€™ll
have lots of spare time in the long winter evenings, and iâ€™ve no
vocation for fancy work. iâ€™m going to teach over at carmody, you know.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know it. i guess youâ€™re going to teach right here in avonlea.
the trustees have decided to give you the school.â€

â€œmrs. lynde!â€ cried anne, springing to her feet in her surprise. â€œwhy, i
thought they had promised it to gilbert blythe!â€

â€œso they did. but as soon as gilbert heard that you had applied for it
he went to them--they had a business meeting at the school last night,
you know--and told them that he withdrew his application, and suggested
that they accept yours. he said he was going to teach at white sands. of
course he knew how much you wanted to stay with marilla, and i must
say i think it was real kind and thoughtful in him, thatâ€™s what. real
self-sacrificing, too, for heâ€™ll have his board to pay at white

may as well make a
complete confession--iâ€™ve been sorry ever since.â€

â€œwe are going to be the best of friends,â€ said gilbert, jubilantly. â€œwe
were born to be good friends, anne. youâ€™ve thwarted destiny enough. i
know we can help each other in many ways. you are going to keep up your
studies, arenâ€™t you? so am i. come, iâ€™m going to walk home with you.â€

marilla looked curiously at anne when the latter entered the kitchen.

â€œwho was that came up the lane with you, anne?â€

â€œgilbert blythe,â€ answered anne, vexed to find herself blushing. â€œi met
him on barryâ€™s hill.â€

â€œi didnâ€™t think you and gilbert blythe were such good friends that youâ€™d
stand for half an hour at the gate talking to him,â€ said marilla with a
dry smile.

â€œwe havenâ€™t been--weâ€™ve been good enemies. but we have decided that it
will be much more sensible to be good friends in the future. were we
really there half an hour? it seemed just a few minutes. but, you see,
we have five yearsâ€™ lost con
