a note on the historical accuracy of this play 

 

this  play  is  not  history  in  the  sense  in  which  the  word  is  used  by  the  academic 
historian. dramatic purposes have sometimes required many characters to be fused into 
one; the number of girls involved in the “crying-out” has been reduced; abigail’s age 
has  been  raised;  while  there  were  several  judges  of  almost  equal  authority,  i  have 
symbolized them all in hathorne and danforth. however, i believe that the reader will 
discover  here  the  essential  nature  of  one  of  the  strangest  and  most  awful  chapters  in 
human  history.  the fate of each character is exactly that of his historical model, and 
there is no one in the drama who did not play a similar - and in some cases exactly the 
same - role in history. 

as for the characters of the persons, little is known about most of them excepting 
what may be surmised from a few letters, the trial record, certain broadsides written at 
the  time,  and  references  to  their  conduct  in  sources  of  varying  reliability.  they  may 
therefore be taken as creations of my own, drawn to the best of my ability in conformity 
with their known behavior, except as indicated in the commentary i have written for this 
text.

(an overture) 

a  small  upper  bedroom  in  the  home  of  reverend  samuel  parris,  salem, 
massachusetts, in the spring of the year 1692. 
 
there  is  a  narrow  window  at  the  left.  through  its  leaded  panes  the  morning 
sunlight  streams.  a  candle  still  burns  near  the  bed,  which  is  at  the  right.  a 
chest, a chair, and a small table are the other furnishings. at the back a door 
opens on the landing of the stairway to the ground floor. the room gives op an 
air of clean spareness. the roof rafters are exposed, and the wood colors are 
raw and unmellowed. 
 
as  the  curtain  rises,  reverend  parris  is  discovered  kneeling  be-side  the  bed, 
evidently in prayer. his daughter, betty parris, aged ten, is lying on the bed, 
inert. 
 

at the time of these events parris was in his middle forties. in history he cut a 
villainous path, and there is very little good to be said for him. he believed he 
was being persecuted wherever he went, despite his best efforts to win people 
and god to his side. in meeting, he felt insulted if someone rose to shut the door 
without  first  asking  his  permission.  he  was  a  widower  with  no  interest  in 
children, or talent with them. he regarded them as

the crucible 

 

young adults, and until this strange crisis he, like the rest of salem, never conceived that 
the  children  were  anything  but  thankful  for  being  permitted  to  walk  straight,  eyes 
slightly low-ered, arms at the sides, and mouths shut until bidden to speak. 

his  house  stood  in  the  “town”  -  but  we  today  would  hardly  call  it  a  village.  the 
meeting  house  was  nearby,  and  from  this  point  outward  -  toward  the  bay  or  inland  - 
there  were  a  few  small-windowed,  dark  houses  snuggling  against  the  raw  massa-
chusetts winter. salem had been established hardly forty years before. to the european 
world the whole province was a bar-baric frontier inhabited by a sect of fanatics who, 
nevertheless, were shipping out products of slowly increasing quantity and value. 

no one can really know what their lives were like. they had no novelists - and would 
not  have  permitted  anyone  to  read  a  novel  if  one  were  handy.  their  creed  forbade 
anything re-sembling a theater or “vain enjoyment.” they did not celebrate christmas, 
and a holiday from work meant only that they must concentrate even more upon prayer. 
which is not to say that nothing broke into this strict and somber way of life. when a 
new  farmhouse  was  built,  friends  assembled  to  “raise  the  roof,”  and  there  would  be 
special foods cooked and probably some potent cider passed around. there was a good 
supply of ne’er-do-wells in salem, who dallied at the shovelboard in bridget bishop’s 
tavern.  probably  more  than  the  creed,  hard  work  kept  the  morals  of  the  place  from 
spoiling, for the people were forced to fight the land like heroes for every grain of corn, 
and no man had very much time for fooling around. 

that  there  were  some  jokers,  however,  is  indicated  by  the  practice  of  appointing  a 
two-man  patrol  whose  duty  was  to  “walk  forth  in  the  time  of  god’s  worship  to  take 
notice of such as either lye about the meeting house, without attending to the word and 
ordinances, or that lye at home or in the fields with-out giving good account thereof, and 
to take the names of such 

act one

persons,  and  to  present  them  to  the  magistrates,  whereby  they  may  be  accordingly 
proceeded  against.”  this  predilection  for  minding  other  people’s  business  was  time-
honored among the people of salem, and it undoubtedly created many of the sus-picions 
which were to feed the coming madness. it was also, in my opinion, one of the things 
that  a  john  proctor  would  rebel  against,  for  the  time  of  the  armed  camp  had  almost 
passed,  and  since  the  country  was  reasonably  -  although  not  wholly  -  safe,  the  old 
disciplines were beginning to rankle. but, as in all such matters, the issue was not clear-
cut, for danger was still a possibility, and in unity still lay the best promise of safety. 

the edge of the wilderness was close by. the american con-tinent stretched endlessly 
west,  and  it  was  full  of  mystery  for  them.  it  stood,  dark  and  threatening,  over  their 
shoulders  night  and  day,  for  out  of  it  indian  tribes  marauded  from  time  to  time,  and 
reverend parris had parishioners who had lost relatives to these heathen. 

the  parochial  snobbery  of  these  people  was  partly  responsible  for  their  failure  to 
convert the indians. probably they also pre-ferred to take land from heathens rather than 
from  fellow  christians.  at  any  rate,  very  few  indians  were  converted,  and  the  salem 
folk believed that the virgin forest was the devil’s last preserve, his home base and the 
citadel of his final stand. to the best of their knowledge the american forest was the last 
place on earth that was not paying homage to god. 

for these reasons, among others, they carried about an air of innate resistance, even of 
persecution. their fathers had, of course, been persecuted in england. so now they and 
their  church  found  it  necessary  to  deny  any  other  sect  its  freedom;  lest  their  new 
jerusalem be defiled and corrupted by wrong ways and deceitful ideas. 

they  believed,  in  short,  that  they  held  in  their  steady  hands  the  candle  that  would 
light the world. we have inherited this belief, and it has helped and hurt us. it helped 
them with the discipline it gave them. they were a dedicated folk, by and large, 

the crucible 

6 
 
and they had to be to survive the life they had chosen or been born into in this 
country. 

the salem tragedy, which is about to begin in these pages, 

the  proof  of  their  belief’s  value  to  them  may  be  taken  from  the  opposite 
character  of  the  first  jamestown  settlement,  farther  south,  in  virginia.  the 
englishmen who landed there were motivated mainly by a hunt for profit. they 
had thought to pick off the wealth of the new country and then return rich to 
eng-land.  they  were  a  band  of  individualists,  and  a  much  more  ingratiating 
group than the massachusetts men. but virginia destroyed them. massachusetts 
tried to kill off the puritans, but they combined; they set up a communal society 
which, in the beginning, was little more than an armed camp with an auto-cratic 
and very devoted leadership. it was, however, an autoc-racy by consent, for they 
were  united  from  top  to  bottom  by  a  commonly  held  ideology  whose 
perpetuation  was  the  reason  and  justification  for  all  their  sufferings.  so  their 
self-denial, their purposefulness, their suspicion of all vain pursuits, their hard-
handed  justice,  were  altogether  perfect  instruments  for  the  con-quest  of  this 
space so antagonistic to man. 

but the people of salem in 1692 were not quite the dedicated folk that arrived 
on the mayflower. a vast differentiation had taken place, and in their own time 
a revolution had unseated the royal government and substituted a junta which 
was at this moment in power. the times, to their eyes, must have been out of 
joint, and to the common folk must have seemed as insoluble and complicated 
as do ours today. it is not hard to see how easily many could have been led to 
believe  that  the  time  of  confusion  had  been  brought  upon  them  by  deep  and 
darkling  forces.  no  hint  of  such  speculation  appears  on  the  court  record,  but 
social  disorder  in  any  age  breeds  such  mystical  suspicions,  and  when,  as  in 
salem, wonders are brought forth from below the social surface, it is too much 
to expect people to hold back very long from laying on the victims with all the 
force of their frustrations.

developed from a paradox. it is a paradox in whose grip we still live, and there is no 
prospect yet that we will discover its res-olution. simply, it was this: for good purposes, 
even high pur-poses, the people of salem developed a theocracy, a combine of state and 
religious  power  whose  function  was  to keep the com-munity together, and to prevent 
any kind of disunity that might open it to destruction by material or ideological enemies. 
it  was  forged  for  a  necessary  purpose  and  accomplished  that  pur-pose.  but  all 
organization is and must be grounded on the idea of exclusion and prohibition, just as 
two  objects  cannot occupy the same space. evidently the time came in new england 
when  the  repressions  of  order  were  heavier  than  seemed  warranted  by  the  dangers 
against which the order was organized. the witch-hunt was a perverse manifestation of 
the panic which set in among all classes when the balance began to turn toward greater 
individual freedom. 

when one rises above the individual villainy displayed, one can only pity them all, 
just as we shall be pitied someday. it is still impossible for man to organize his social 
life  without  repressions,  and  the  balance  has  yet  to  be  struck  between  order  and 
freedom. 

the witch-hunt was not, however, a mere repression. it was also, and as importantly, 
a long overdue opportunity for every-one so inclined to express publicly his guilt and 
sins, under the cover of accusations against the victims. it suddenly became possible - 
and patriotic and holy - for a man to say that martha corey had come into his bedroom 
at night, and that, while his wife was sleeping at his side, martha laid herself down on 
his  chest  and  “nearly  suffocated  him.”  of  course  it  was  her  spirit  only,  but  his 
satisfaction at confessing himself was no lighter than if it had been martha herself. one 
could not ordinarily speak such things in public. 

long-held  hatreds  of  neighbors  could  now  be  openly  ex-pressed,  and  vengeance 
taken,  despite  the  bible’s  charitable  injunctions.  land-lust  which  had  been  expressed 
before by con- 

the crucible 

8 
 
stant  bickering  over  boundaries  and  deeds,  could  now  be  ele-vated  to  the  arena  of 
morality; one could cry witch against one’s neighbor and feel perfectly justified in the 
bargain. old scores could be settled on a plane of heavenly combat between lucifer and 
the lord; suspicions and the envy of the miserable toward the happy could and did burst 
out in the general revenge. 
 
reverend parris is praying now, and, though we cannot hear his words, a sense of his 
confusion  hangs  about  him.  he  mumbles,  then  seems  about  to  weep;  then  he  weeps, 
then,prays again; but his daughter does not stir on the bed. 
 
the door opens, and his negro slave enters. tituba is in her forties. parris brought her 
with him from barbados, where he spent some years as a merchant before entering the 
ministry. she enters as one does who can no longer bear to be barred from the sight of 
her  beloved,  but  she is also very frightened because her slave sense has warned her 
that, as always, trouble in this house eventually lands on her back. 
 
tituba, already taking a step backward: my betty be hearty soon? 
 
parris: out of here! 
 
tituba, backing to the door: my betty not goin’ die... 
 
parris, scrambling to his feet in a fury: out of my sight! she is gone. out of my - he is 
overcome with sobs. he clamps his teeth against them and closes the door and leans 
against  it,  ex-hausted.  oh,  my  god!  god  help  me!  quaking  with  fear,  mum-bling  to 
himself through his sobs, he goes to the bed and gently takes betty’s hand. betty. child. 
dear child, will you wake, will you open up your eyes! betty, little one... 
 
he is bending to kneel  again when his  niece,  abigail  williams, seventeen, enters - a 
strikingly beautiful girl, an orphan, with an

endless  capacity  for  dissembling.  now  she  is  all  worry  and  appre-hension  and 
propriety. 
 
abigail: uncle? he looks to her. susanna walcott’s here from doctor griggs. 
 
parris: oh?. let her come, let her come. 
 
abigail, leaning out the door to call to susanna, who is down the hall a few 
steps: come in, susanna. 
 
susanna walcott, a little younger than abigail, a nervous, hur-ried girl, enters. 
 
parris, eagerly: what does the doctor say, child? 
 
susanna, craning around parris to get a look at betty: he bid me come and tell 
you, reverend sir, that he cannot discover no medicine for it in his books. 
 
parris: then he must search on. 
 
susanna: aye, sir, he have been searchin’ his books since he left you, sir. but he 
bid me tell you, that you might look to un-natural things for the cause of it. 
 
parris, his eyes going wide: no - no. there be no unnatural cause here. tell him 
i have sent for reverend hale of beverly, and mr. hale will surely confirm that. 
let him look to medicine and put out all thought of unnatural causes here. there 
be none. 
 
susanna: aye, sir. he bid me tell you. she turns to go. 
 
abigail: speak nothin’ of it in the village, susanna. 
 
parris: go directly home and speak nothing of unnatural causes. 
susanna: aye, sir. i pray for her. she goes out. 
abigail: uncle, the rumor of witchcraft is all about; i think

you’d best go down and deny it yourself. the parlor’s packed with people, sir. i’ll sit 
with her. 
 
parris, pressed, turns on her: and what shall i say to them? that my daughter 
and my niece i discovered dancing like heathen in the forest? 
 
abigail:  uncle,  we  did  dance;  let  you  tell  them  i  confessed  it  -  and  i’ll  be 
whipped if i must be. but they’re speakin’ of witch-craft. betty’s not witched. 
 
parris: abigail, i cannot go before the congregation when i know you have not 
opened with me. what did you do with her in the forest? 
 
abigail: we did dance, uncle, and when you leaped out of the bush so suddenly, 
betty was frightened and then she fainted. and there’s the whole of it. 
 
parris: child. sit you down. 
 
abigail, quavering, as she sits: i would never hurt betty. i love her dearly. 
 
parris; now look you, child, your punishment will come in its time. but if you 
trafficked with spirits in the forest i must know it now, for surely my enemies 
will, and they will ruin me with it. 
 
abigail: but we never conjured spirits. 
 
parris:  then  why  can  she  not  move  herself  since  midnight?  this  child  is 
desperate! abigail lowers her eyes. it must come out - my enemies will bring it 
out. let me know what you done there. abigail, do you understand that i have 
many enemies? 
 
abigail: i have heard of it, uncle. 
 
parris: there is a faction that is sworn to drive me from my pulpit. do you 
understand that? 
 
abigail: i think so, sir. 

abigail: she always sings her barbados songs, and we dance.

11 
 
parris: now then, in the midst of such disruption, my own household is discovered to 
be the very center of some obscene practice. abominations are done in the forest - 
 
abigail: it were sport, uncle! 
 
parris, pointing at betty: you call this sport? she lowers her eyes. he pleads: abigail, 
if you know something that may help the doctor, for god’s sake tell it to me. she is 
silent. i saw tituba waving her arms over the fire when i came on you. why was she 
doing that? and i heard a screeching and gibberish coming from her mouth. she were 
swaying like a dumb beast over that fire! 
 

parris: i cannot blink what i saw, abigail, for my enemies will not blink it. i saw a 
dress lying on the grass. 
 
abigail, innocently: a dress? 
 
parris  -  it  is  very  hard  to  say:  aye,  a  dress.  and  i  thought  i  saw  -  someone  naked 
running through the trees! 
 
abigail, in terror: no one was naked! you mistake yourself, uncle! 
 
parris, with anger: i saw it! he moves from her. then, re-solved: now tell me true, 
abigail. and i pray you feel the weight of truth upon you, for now my ministry’s at 
stake,  my  ministry  and  perhaps  your  cousin’s  life.  whatever  abomination  you  have 
done, give me all of it now, for i dare not be taken unaware when i go before them 
down there. 
 
abigail: there is nothin’ more. i swear it, uncle. 
 
parris, studies her, then nods, half convinced: abigail, i have sought here three long 
years  to  bend  these  stiff-necked  people  to  me,  and  now,  just  now  when  some  good 
respect is rising for me in the parish, you compromise my very character. i have

given  you  a  home,  child,  i  have  put  clothes  upon  your  back  -  now  give  me  upright 
answer. your name in the town - it is en-tirely white, is it not? 
 
abigail, with an edge of resentment: why, i am sure it is, sir. there be no blush about 
my name. 
 
parris, to the point: abigail, is there any other cause than you have told me, for your 
being discharged from goody proc-tor’s service? i have heard it said, and i tell you as i 
heard it, that she comes so rarely to the church this year for she will not sit so close to 
something soiled. what signified that remark? 
 
abigail: she hates me, uncle, she must, for i would not be her slave. it’s a bitter woman, 
a lying, cold, sniveling woman, and i will not work for such a woman! 
 
parris: she may be. and yet it has troubled me that you are now seven month out of 
their house, and in all this time no other family has ever called for your service. 
 
abigail: they want slaves, not such as i. let them send to barbados for that. i will not 
black my face for any of them! with ill-concealed resentment at him: do you begrudge 
my bed, uncle? 
 
parris: no - no. 
 
abigail, in a temper: my name is good in the village! i will not have it said my name is 
soiled! goody proctor is a gossiping liar! 
 
enter  mrs.  ann  putnam.  she  is  a  twisted  soul  of  forty-five,  a  death-ridden  woman, 
haunted by dreams. 
 
parris, as soon as the door begins to open: no - no, i cannot have anyone'. he sees her, 
and  a  certain  deference  springs  into  him,  although  his  worry  remains.  why,  goody 
putnam, come in. 
 
mrs. putnam, full of breath, shiny-eyed: it is a marvel. it is surely a stroke of hell upon 
you.

 act one parris: no, goody putnam, it is - 
 
mrs. putnam, glancing at betty: how high did she fly, how high? 
 
parris: no, no, she never flew - 
 
mrs. putnam, very pleased with it: why, it’s sure she did. mr. collins saw her 
goin’ over ingersoll’s barn, and come down light as bird, he says! 
 
parris:  now,  look  you,  goody  putnam,  she  never  -  enter  thomas  putnam,  a 
well-to-do, hard-handed landowner, near fifty. oh, good morning, mr. putnam. 
 
putnam:  it  is  a  providence  the  thing  is  out  now!  it  is  a  provi-dence. he goes 
directly to the bed. 
 
parris: what’s out, sir, what’s - ? 
 
mrs. putnam goes to the bed. 
 
putnam, looking down at betty: why, her eyes is closed! look you, ann. 
mrs. putnam: why, that’s strange. to parris: ours is open. parris, shocked: 
your ruth is sick? 
 
mrs. putnam, with vicious certainty: i’d not call it sick; the devil’s touch is 
heavier  than  sick.  it’s  death,  y’know,  it’s  death  drivin’  into  them,  forked  and 
hoofed. 
 
parris: oh, pray not! why, how does ruth ail? 
 
mrs. putnam: she ails as she must - she never waked this morning, but her eyes 
open and she walks, and hears naught, sees naught, and cannot eat. her soul is 
taken, surely. 
 
parris is struck. 
 
putnam, as though for further details: they say you’ve sent for reverend 
hale of beverly?

parris, with dwindling conviction now: a precaution only. he has much experience in 
all demonic-arts, and i - 
 
mrs. putnam: he has indeed; and found a witch in beverly last year, and let you 
remember that. 
 
parris: now, goody ann, they only thought that were a witch, and i am certain 
there be no element of witchcraft here. 
 
putnam: no witchcraft! now look you, mr. parris - 
 
parris: thomas, thomas, i pray you, leap not to witchcraft. i know that you - 
you least of all, thomas, would ever wish so disastrous a charge laid upon me. 
we  cannot  leap  to  witchcraft.  they  will  howl  me  out  of  salem  for  such 
corruption in my house. 
 

a word about thomas putnam. he was a man with many grievances, at least 
one  of  which  appears  justified.  some  time  before,  his  wife’s  brother-in-law, 
james bayley, had been turned down as minister of salem. bayley had all the 
qualifications, and a two-thirds vote into the bargain, but a faction stopped his 
acceptance, for reasons that are not clear. 

thomas putnam was the eldest son of the richest man in the village. he had 
fought the indians at narragansett, and was deeply interested in parish affairs. 
he  undoubtedly  felt  it  poor  payment  that  the  village  should  so  blatantly 
disregard his candi-date for one of its more important offices, especially since 
he  regarded  himself  as  the  intellectual  superior  of  most  of  the  people  around 
him. 

his  vindictive  nature  was  demonstrated  long  before  the  witch-craft  began. 
another former salem minister, george burroughs, had had to borrow money 
to pay for his wife’s funeral, and, since the parish was remiss in his salary, he 
was soon bankrupt. thomas and his brother john had burroughs jailed for debts 
the  man  did  not  owe.  the  incident  is  important  only  in  that  burroughs 
succeeded in becoming minister where bayley, 

act one 

15 
 
thomas putnam’s brother-in-law, had been rejected; the motif of resentment is 
clear here. thomas putnam felt that his own name and the honor of his family 
had  been  smirched  by  the  village,  and  he  meant  to  right  matters  however  he 
could. 

another  reason  to  believe  him  a  deeply  embittered  man  was  his  attempt to 
break his father’s will, which left a dispropor-tionate amount to a stepbrother. 
as with every other public cause in which he tried to force his way, he failed in 
this. 

 

so it is not surprising to find that so many accusations against people are in 
the  handwriting  of  thomas  putnam,  or  that  his  name  is  so  often  found  as  a 
witness corroborating the super-natural testimony, or that his daughter led the 
crying-out at the most opportune junctures of the trials, especially when - but 
we’ll speak of that when we come to it. 

putnum - at the moment he is intent upon getting parris, for whom he has only 
contempt, to move toward the abyss: mr. parris, i have taken your part in all 
contention  here,  and  i  would  continue;  but  i  cannot  if  you  hold  back  in  this. 
there are hurtful, vengeful spirits layin’ hands on these children. 
 
parris: but, thomas, you cannot - 
 
putnam: ann! tell mr. parris what you have done. 
 
mrs.  putnam:  reverend  parris,  i  have  laid  seven  babies  un-baptized  in  the 
earth. believe me, sir, you never saw more hearty babies born, and yet, each 
would wither in my arms the very night of their birth. i have spoke nothin’, but 
my heart has clamored intimations. and now, this year, my ruth, my only - i 
see her turning strange. a secret child she has become this year, and shrivels 
like a sucking mouth were pullin’ on her life too. and so i thought to send her 
to your tituba - 
 
parris: to tituba! what may tituba - ? 
 
mrs. putnam: tituba knows how to speak to the dead, mr. parris. 

the crucible 

16 
parris: goody ann, it is a formidable sin to conjure up the dead! 
 
mrs. putnam: i take it on my soul, but who else may surely tell us what person 
murdered my babies? 
 
parris, horrified: woman! 
 
mrs. putnam: they were murdered, mr. parris! and mark this proof! mark it! 
last night my ruth were ever so close to their little spirits; i know it, sir. for 
how else is she struck dumb now except some power of darkness would stop her 
mouth? it is a marvelous sign, mr. parris! 
 
putnam:  don’t  you  understand  it,  sir?  there  is  a  murdering  witch  among  us, 
bound to keep herself in the dark. parris turns to betty, a frantic terror rising in 
him. let your enemies make of it what they will, you cannot blink it more. 
 
parris, to abigail: then you were conjuring spirits last night. 
 
abigail, whispering: not i, sir - tituba and ruth. 
 
parris turns now, with new fear, and goes to betty, looks down at her, and then, 
gazing  off:  oh,  abigail,  what  proper  payment  for  my  charity!  now  i  am 
undone. 
 
putnam: you are not undone! let you take hold here. wait for no one to charge 
you - declare it yourself. you have dis-covered witchcraft - 
 
parris:  in  my  house?  in  my  house,  thomas?  they  will  topple  me  with  this!

mrs. putnam: ah, there’s a sign of life! 
 
mercy: i’d fear no more, goody putnam. it were a grand sneeze; another like it 
will shake her wits together, i’m sure. she goes to the bed to look. 
 
parris: will you leave me now, thomas? i would pray a while alone. 
 
abigail: uncle, you’ve prayed since midnight. why do you not go down and - 
 
parris: no - no. to putnam: i have no answer for that crowd. i’ll wait till mr. 
hale arrives. to get mrs. putnam to leave: if you will, goody ann... 
 
putnam: now look you, sir. let you strike out against the devil, and the village 
will  bless  you  for  it!  come  down,  speak  to  them  -  pray  with  them.  they’re 
thirsting for your word, mister! surely you’ll pray with them. 
 
parris, swayed: i’ll lead them in a psalm, but let you say nothing of witchcraft 
yet.  i  will  not  discuss  it.  the  cause  is  yet  unknown.  i  have  had  enough 
contention since i came; i want no more. 
 
mrs. putnam: mercy, you go home to ruth, d’y’hear? 
 
mercy: aye, mum. 
 
mrs. putnam goes out. 
 
parris, to abigail: if she starts for the window, cry for me at once. 
 
abigail: i will, uncle.

abigail, with hushed trepidation: how is ruth sick? 
 
mercy! it’s weirdish, i know not - she seems to walk like a dead one since last 
night. 
 
abigail, turns at once and goes to betty, and now, with fear in her voice: betty? 
betty doesn’t move. she shakes her. now stop this! betty! sit up now! 
 
betty doesn’t stir. mercy comes over. 
 
mercy: have you tried beatin’ her? i gave ruth a good one and it waked her for 
a minute. here, let me have her. 
 
abigail, holding mercy back: no, he’ll be comin’ up. listen, now; if they be 
questioning us, tell them we danced - i told him as much already, 
 
mercy: aye. and what more? 
 
abigail: he knows tituba conjured ruth’s sisters to come out of the grave. 
mercy: and what more? 
abigail: he saw you naked. 
 
mercy: clapping her hands together with a frightened laugh: oh, jesus! 
 
enter mary warren, breathless. she is  seventeen, a subservient, naive, lonely 
girl. 
 
mary warren: what’ll we do? the village is out! i just come from the farm; the 
whole country’s talkin’ witchcraft! they’ll be callin’ us witches, abby! 
 
mercy, pointing and looking at mary warren: she means to tell, i know it. 
 
mary  warren:  abby,  we’ve  got  to  tell.  witchery’s  a  hangin’  error,  a  hangin’ 
like they done in boston two year ago! we

must tell the truth, abby! you’ll only be whipped for dancin’, and the other things! 
 
abigail: oh,-we’ll be whipped! 
 
mary warren: i never done none of it, abby. i only looked! 
 
mercy, moving menacingly toward mary: oh, you’re a great one for lookin’, aren’t you, 
mary warren? what a grand peeping courage you have! 
 
betty, on the bed, whimpers. abigail turns to her at once. 
 
abigail: betty? she goes to betty. now, betty, dear, wake up now. it’s abigail. she sits 
betty up and furiously shakes her. i’ll beat you, betty! betty whimpers. my, you seem 
improving. i talked to your papa and i told him everything. so there’s nothing to - 
 
betty, darts op the bed, frightened of abigail, and flattens her-self against the wall: i 
want my mama! 
 
abigail, with alarm, as she cautiously approaches betty: what ails you, betty? your 
mama’s dead and buried. 
 
betty: i’ll fly to mama. let me fly! she raises her arms as though to fly, and streaks for 
the window, gets one leg out. 
 
abigail, pulling her away from the window: i told him every-thing,' he knows now, he 
knows everything we - 
betty: you drank blood, abby! you didn’t tell him that! 
abigail: betty, you never say that again! you will never-- 
 
betty: you did, you did! you drank a charm to kill john proctor’s wife! you drank a 
charm to kill goody proctor! 
 
abigail, smashes her across the face: shut it! now shut it! 
 
barry, collapsing on the bed: mama, mama! she dissolves into sobs.

abigail: now look you. all of you. we danced. and tituba conjured ruth putnam’s 
dead sisters. and that is all. and mark this. let either of you breathe a word, or the edge 
of a word, about the other things, and i will come to you in the black of some terrible 
night and i will bring a pointy reckoning that will shudder you. and you know i can do 
it; i saw indians smash my dear parents’ heads on the pillow next to mine, and i have 
seen some reddish work done at night, and i can make you wish you had never seen the 
sun go down! she goes to betty and roughly sits her up. now, you - sit up and stop this' 
 
but betty collapses in her hands and lies inert on the bed. 
 
marry warren, with hysterical fright, what’s got her? abigail stares in fright at betty. 
abby, she’s going to die! it’s a sin to conjure, and we - 
 
abigail, starting for mary: i say shut it, mary warren! 
 
enter john proctor. on seeing him, mary warren leaps in fright, 
 

proctor was a farmer in his middle thirties, he need not have been a partisan of any 
faction in the town, but there is evidence to suggest that he had a sharp and biting way 
with hypocrites. he was the kind of man - powerful of body, even-tempered, and not 
easily  led  -  who  cannot  refuse  support  to  partisans  with-out  drawing  their  deepest 
resentment. in proctor’s presence a fool felt his foolishness instantly - and a proctor is 
always marked for calumny therefore. 

but as we shall see, the steady manner he displays does not spring from an untroubled 
soul. he is a sinner, a sinner not only against the moral fashion of the time, but against 
his own vision of decent conduct. these people had no ritual for the washing away of 
sins. it is another trait we inherited from them. and it has helped to discipline us as well 
as to breed hypocrisy among us. proctor, respected and even feared in salem, has 

 

 21 

 act one 

 
 
come to regard himself as a kind of fraud. but no hint of this has yet appeared on the 
surface, and as he enters from the crowded parlor below it is a man in his prime we see, 
with a quiet confidence and an unexpressed, hidden force. mary war-ren, his servant, 
can barely speak for embarrassment and fear. 
 
mary warren: oh! i’m just going home, mr. proctor. 
 
proctor:  be  you  foolish,  mary  warren?  be  you  deaf?  i  for-bid  you  leave  the 
house, did i not? why shall i pay you? i am looking for you more often than my 
cows! 
 
mary warren: i only come to see the great doings in the world. 
 
proctor: i’ll show you a great doin' on your arse one of these days. now get you 
home; my wife is waitin’ with your work! trying to retain a shred of dignity, 
she goes slowly out. 
 
mercy lewis, both afraid of him and strangely titillated: i’d best be off. i have 
my ruth to watch. good morning, mr. proctor. 
 
mercy  sidles  out.  since  proctor’s  entrance,  abigail  has  stood  as  though  on 
tiptoe, absorbing his presence, wide-eyed. he glances at her, then goes to betty 
on the bed. 
 
abigail: gah! i’d almost forgot how strong you are, john proctor! 
 
proctor, looking at abigail now, the faintest suggestion of a knowing smile on 
his face: what’s this mischief here? 
 
abigail, with a nervous laugh: oh, she’s only gone silly some-how. 
 
proctor:  the  road  past  my  house  is  a  pilgrimage  to  salem  all  morning.  the 
town’s mumbling witchcraft. 
 
abigail: oh, posh! winningly she comes a little closer, with a 

  22 
 

 the crucible 

 

confidential, wicked air. we were dancin’ in the woods last night, and my uncle leaped 
in on us. she took fright, is all. 
 
proctor,  his  smile  widening:  ah,  you’re  wicked  yet,  aren’t  y’!  a  trill  of 
expectant laughter escapes her, and she dares come closer, feverishly looking 
into his eyes. you’ll be clapped in the stocks before you’re twenty. 
 
he takes a step to go, and she springs into his path. 
 
abigail: give me a word, john. a soft word. her concentrated desire destroys 
his smile. 
 
proctor: no, no, abby. that’s done with. 
 
abigail,  tauntingly:  you  come  five  mile  to  see  a  silly  girl  fly?  i  know  you 
better. 
 
proctor, setting her firmly out of his path: i come to see what mischief your 
uncle’s brewin’ now. with final emphasis: put it out of mind, abby. 
 
abigail, grasping his hand before he can release her: john - i am waitin’ for 
you every night. 
 
proctor: abby, i never give you hope to wait for me. 
 
abigail, now beginning to anger - she can’t believe it: i have something better 
than hope, i think! 
 
proctor: abby, you’ll put it out of mind. i’ll not be comin’ for you more. 
 
abigail: you’re surely sportin’ with me. 
 
proctor: you know me better. 
 
abigail:  i  know  how  you  clutched  my  back  behind  your  house  and  sweated 
like a stallion whenever i come near! or did i dream that? it’s she put me out, 
you cannot pretend it were you. i saw your face when she put me out, and you 
loved me then and you do now!

 proctor: abby, that’s a wild thing to say - 
 
abigail: a wild thing may say wild things. but not so wild, i think. i have seen you 
since she put me out; i have seen you nights. 
 
proctor: i have hardly stepped off my farm this sevenmonth. 
 
abigail: i have a sense for heat, john, and yours has drawn me to my window, 
and  i  have  seen  you  looking  up,  burning  in  your  loneliness.  do  you  tell  me 
you’ve never looked up at my window? 
 
proctor: i may have looked up. 
 
abigail,  now  softening:  and  you  must.  you  are  no  wintry  man.  i  know  you, 
john. i know you. she is weeping. i cannot sleep for dreamin‘; i cannot dream 
but  i  wake  and  walk  about  the  house  as  though  i’d  find  you  comin’  through 
some door. she clutches him desperately. 
 
proctor, gently pressing her from him, with great sympathy but firmly: child - 
 
abigail, with a pash of anger: how do you call me child! 
 
proctor: abby, i may think of you softly from time to time. but i will cut off my 
hand  before  i’ll  ever  reach  for  you  again.  wipe  it  out  of  mind.  we  never 
touched, abby. 
 
abigail: aye, but we did. 
 
proctor: aye, but we did not. 
 
abigail, with a bitter anger: oh, i marvel how such a strong man may let such a 
sickly wife be - 
 
proctor, angered - at himself as well: you’ll speak nothin’ of elizabeth! 
 

abigail: she is blackening my name in the village! she is tell-

ing lies about me! .she is a cold, sniveling woman, and you bend to her! let her turn 
you like a - 
 
proctor, shaking her: do you look for whippin’? 
 
a psalm is heard being sung below. 
 
abigail, in tears: i look for john proctor that took me from my sleep and put knowledge 
in my heart! i never knew what pretense salem was, i never knew the lying lessons i 
was taught by all these christian women and their covenanted men! and now you bid 
me tear the light out of my eyes? i will not, i cannot! you loved me, john proctor, and 
whatever sin it is, you love me yet! he turns abruptly to go out. she rushes to him. john, 
pity me, pity me! 
 
the  words  “going  up  to  jesus”  are  heard  in  the  psalm  and  betty  claps  her  ears 
suddenly and whines loudly. 
 
abigail: betty? she hurries to betty, who is now sitting up and screaming. proctor goes 
to betty as abigail is trying to pull her hands down, calling “betty!” 
 
proctor, growing unnerved: what’s she doing? girl, what ails you? stop that wailing! 
 
the singing has stopped in the midst of this, and now parris rushes in. 
 
parris: what happened? what are you doing to her? betty! he rushes to the bed, crying, 
“betty,  betty!”  mrs.  putnam  enters,  feverish  with  curiosity,  and  with  her  thomas 
putnam and mercy lewis. parris, at the bed, keeps lightly slapping betty’s face, while 
she moans and tries to get up. 
 
abigail: she heard you singin’ and suddenly she’s up and screamin’. 
 
mrs. putnam: the psalm! the psalm! she cannot bear to hear the lord’s name! 

act one 

25 
 
parris:  no.  god  forbid.  mercy,  run  to  the  doctor!  tell  him  what’s  happened 
here! mercy lewis rushes out. 
 
mrs. putnam: mark it for a sign, mark it! 
 
rebecca  nurse,  seventy-two,  enters.  she  is  white-haired,  leaning  upon  her 
walking-stick. 
 
putnam, pointing at the whimpering betty: that is a notorious sign of witchcraft 
afoot, goody nurse, a prodigious sign! 
 
mrs. putnam: my mother told me that! when they cannot bear to hear the name 
of - 
 
parris, trembling: rebecca, rebecca, go to her, we’re lost. she suddenly cannot 
bear to hear the lord’s - 
 
giles corey, eighty-three, enters. he is knotted with muscle, canny, inquisitive, 
and still powerful. 
 
rebecca: there is hard sickness here, giles corey, so please to keep the quiet. 
 
giles: i’ve not said a word. no one here can testify i’ve said a word. is she 
going to fly again? i hear she flies. 
 
putnam: man, be quiet now! 
 
everything  is  quiet.  rebecca  walks  across  the  room  to  the  bed.  gentleness 
exudes from her. betty is quietly whimpering, eyes shut, rebecca simply stands 
over the child, who gradually quiets. 
 

and while they are so absorbed, we may put a word in for rebecca. rebecca 
was the wife of francis nurse, who, from all accounts, was one of those men for 
whom both sides of the argument had to have respect. he was called upon to 
arbitrate  disputes  as  though  he  were  an  unofficial  judge,  and  rebecca  also 
enjoyed the high opinion most people had for him. by the time of the delusion, 
they  had  three  hundred  acres,  and  their  children  were  settled  in  separate 
homesteads within the same 

the crucible 

26 
 
estate. however, francis had originally rented the land, and one theory has it that, as he 
gradually paid for it and raised hi: social status, there were those who resented his rise. 

another  suggestion  to  explain  the  systematic  campaign  against  rebecca,  and 
inferentially against francis, is the land war he fought with his neighbors, one of whom 
was a putnam. this squabble grew to the proportions of a battle in the woods be-tween 
partisans of both sides, and it is said to have lasted for two days. as for rebecca herself, 
the general opinion of her character was so high that to explain how anyone dared cry 
her out for a witch - and more, how adults could bring them-selves to lay hands on her - 
we must look to the fields and boundaries of that time. 

as  we  have  seen, thomas putnam’s man for the salem min-istry was bayley. the 
nurse clan had been in the faction that prevented bayley’s taking office. in addition, 
certain  families  allied  to  the  nurses  by  blood  or  friendship,  and  whose  farms  were 
contiguous with the nurse farm or close to it, combined to break away from the salem 
town authority and set up tops-field, a new and independent entity whose existence was 
re-sented by old salemites. 

that the guiding hand behind the outcry was putnam’s is, indicated by the fact that, as 
soon  as  it  began,  this  topsfield-nurse  ’faction  absented  themselves  from  church  in 
protest  and  disbelief.  it  was  edward  and  jonathan  putnam  who  signed  the  first 
complaint against rebecca; and thomas putnam’s little daughter was the one who fell 
into  a  fit  at  the  hearing  and  pointed  to  rebecca  as  her  attacker.  to  top  it  all,  mrs. 
putnam - who is now staring at the bewitched child on the bed - soon accused rebecca’s 
spirit of “tempting her to iniquity,” a charge that had more truth in it than mrs. putnam 
could know, 

 

mrs. putnam, astonished: what have you done? 
rebecca, in thought, now leaves the bedside and sits. 

 

 27

parris, wondrous and relieved: what do you make of it, rebecca? 
 
putnam, eagerly: goody nurse, will you go to my ruth and see if you can wake 
her? 
 
rebecca,  sitting:  i  think  she’ll  wake  in  time.  pray  calm  your-selves.  i  have 
eleven children, and i am twenty-six times a grandma, and i have seen them all 
through their silly seasons, and when it come on them they will run the devil 
bowlegged keeping up with their mischief. i think she’ll wake when she tires of 
it. a child’s spirit is like a child, you can never catch it by running after it; you 
must stand still, and, for love, it will soon itself come back, 
 
proctor: aye, that’s the truth of it, rebecca. 
 
mrs.  putnam:  this  is  no  silly  season,  rebecca.  my  ruth  is  bewildered, 
rebecca; she cannot eat. 
 
rebecca: perhaps she is not hungered yet. to parris: i hope you are not decided 
to go in search of loose spirits, mr. parris. i’ve heard.promise of that outside. 
 
parris: a wide opinion’s running in the parish that the devil may be among us, 
and i would satisfy them that they are wrong. 
 
proctor:  then  let  you  come  out  and  call  them  wrong.  did  you  consult  the 
wardens before you called this minister to look for devils? 
 
parris: he is not coming to look for devils! 
 
proctor: then what’s he coming for? 
 
putnam: there be children dyin’ in the village, mister! 
 
proctor: i seen none dyin’. this society will not be a bag to swing around your 
head, mr. putnam. to parris: did you call a meeting before you - ?

putnam: i am sick of meetings; cannot the man turn his head without he have a 
meeting? 
 
proctor:, he may turn his head, but not to hell! 
 
rebecca: pray, john, be calm. pause. he defers to her. mr. parris, i think you’d 
best send reverend hale back as soon as he come. this will set us all to arguin’ 
again in the society, and we thought to have peace this year; i think we ought 
rely on the doctor now, and good prayer. 
 
mrs. putnam: rebecca, the doctor’s baffled! 
 
rebecca: if so he is, then let us go to god for the cause of it. there is prodigious 
danger  in  the  seeking  of  loose  spirits.  i  fear  it,  i  fear  it.  let  us  rather  blame 
ourselves and - 
 
putnam:  how  may  we  blame  ourselves?  i  am  one  of nine sons; the putnam 
seed have peopled this province. and yet i have but one child left of eight - and 
now she shrivels! 
 
rebecca: i cannot fathom that. 
 
mrs. putnam, with a growing edge of sarcasm: but i must! you think it god’s 
work you should never lose a child, nor grand-child either, and i bury all but 
one? there are wheels within wheels in this village, and fires within fires! 
 
putnam, to parris: when reverend hale comes, you will pro-ceed to look for 
signs of witchcraft here. 
 
proctor, to putnam: you cannot command mr. parris. we vote by name in this 
society, not by acreage. 
 
putnam: i never heard you worried so on this society, mr. proctor. i do not think 
i saw you at sabbath meeting since snow flew.

hellfire and bloody damnation. take it

to  heart,  mr.  parris.  there  are  many  others  who  stay  away  from  church  these  days 
because you hardly ever mention god any more. 
 
parris, now aroused: why, that’s a drastic charge! 
 
rebecca: it’s somewhat true; there are many that quail to bring their children - 
 
parris:  i  do  not  preach  for  children,  rebecca.  it  is  not  the  children  who  are 
unmindful of their obligations toward this ministry. 
 
rebecca: are there really those unmindful? 
 
parris: i should say the better half of salem village - 
 
putnam: and more than that! 
 
parris:  where  is  my  wood?  my  contract  provides  i  be  supplied  with  all  my 
firewood. i am waiting since november for a stick, and even in november i had 
to show my frostbitten hands like some london beggar! 
 
giles: you are allowed six pound a year to buy your wood, mr. parris. 
 
parris:  i  regard  that  six  pound  as  part  of  my  salary.  i  am  paid  little  enough 
without i spend six pound on firewood. 
 
proctor: sixty, plus six for firewood - 
 
parris: the salary is sixty-six pound, mr. proctor! i am not some preaching 
farmer with a book under my arm; i am a graduate of harvard college. 
 
giles: aye, and well instructed in arithmetic!

howling  riot  of  argument.  i  have  often  wondered  if  the  devil  be  in  it  somewhere;  i 
cannot understand you people otherwise. 
 
proctor: mr. parris, you are the first minister ever did demand the deed to this 
house - 
 
parris: man! don’t a minister deserve a house to live in? 
 
proctor: to live in, yes. but to ask ownership is like you shall own the meeting 
house  itself;  the  last  meeting  i  were  at  you  spoke  so  long  on  deeds  and 
mortgages i thought it were an auction. 
 
parris: i want a mark of confidence, is all! i am your third preacher in seven 
years. i do not wish to be put out like the cat whenever some majority feels the 
whim. you people seem not to comprehend that a minister is the lord’s man in 
the parish; a minister is not to be so lightly crossed and contra-dicted - 
 
putnam: aye! 
 
parris: there is either obedience or the church will burn like hell is burning! 
 
proctor: can you speak one minute without we land in hell again? i am sick of 
hell!

enter reverend john hale of beverly. 
 

mr. hale is nearing forty, a tight-skinned, eager-eyed intel-lectual. this is a beloved 

errand for him; on being called here 

act one 

33 
 
to  ascertain  witchcraft  he  felt  the  pride  of  the  specialist  whose  unique 
knowledge has at last been publicly called for. like almost all men of learning, 
he spent a good deal of his time pondering the invisible world, especially since 
he had himself encountered a witch in his parish not long before. that woman, 
however, turned into a mere pest under his searching scrutiny, and the child she 
had  allegedly  been  afflicting  recovered  her  normal  behavior  after  hale  had 
given her his kindness and a few days of rest in his own house. however, that 
experience never raised a doubt in his mind as to the reality of the under-world 
or the existence of lucifer’s many-faced lieutenants. and his belief is not to his 
discredit. better minds than hale’s were - and still are - convinced that there is a 
society of spirits beyond our ken. one cannot help noting that one of his lines 
has  never  yet  raised  a  laugh  in  any  audience  that  has  seen  this  play;  it  is  his 
assurance that “,we cannot look to superstition in this. the devil is precise.” 
evidently we are not quite certain even now whether diabolism is holy and not 
to be scoffed at. and it is no accident that we should be so bemused. 

like reverend hale and the others on this stage, we conceive the devil as a 
necessary part of a respectable view of cosmology. ours is a divided empire in 
which certain ideas and emotions and actions are of god, and their opposites are 
of lucifer. it is as impossible for most men to conceive of a morality without 
sin as of an earth without “sky.” since 1692 a great but super-ficial change has 
wiped  out  god’s  beard  and  the  devil’s  horns,  but  the  world  is  still  gripped 
between  two  diametrically  opposed  absolutes.  the concept of unity, in which 
positive and negative are attributes of the same force, in which good and evil 
are relative, ever-changing, and always joined to the same phenom-enon - such 
a  concept  is  still  reserved  to  the  physical  sciences  and  to  the  few  who  have 
grasped the history of ideas. when it is recalled that until the christian era the 
underworld was never regarded as a hostile area, that all gods were useful and 
es-sentially friendly to man despite occasional lapses; when we 

the crucible 

34 
 
see  the  steady  and  methodical  inculcation  into  humanity  of  the  idea  of  man’s 
worthlessness  -  until  redeemed  -  the  necessity  of  the  devil  may  become  evident  as  a 
weapon, a weapon designed and used time and time again in every age to whip men into 
a surrender to a particular church or church-state. 

our difficulty in believing the - for want of a better word - political inspiration of the 
devil is due in great part to the fact that he is called up and damned not only by our 
social  antagonists  but  by  our  own  side,  whatever  it  may  be.  the  catholic  church, 
through  its  inquisition,  is  famous  for  culti-vating  lucifer  as  the  arch-fiend,  but  the 
church’s enemies relied no less upon the old boy to keep the human mind enthralled. 
luther was himself accused of alliance with hell, and he in turn accused his enemies. 
to complicate matters further, he believed that he had had contact with the devil and 
had argued theology with him. i am not surprised at this, for at my own university a 
professor of history - a lutheran, by the way - used to as-semble his graduate students, 
draw the shades, and commune in the classroom with erasmus. he was never, to my 
knowledge, officially scoffed at for this, the reason being that the university officials, 
like most of us, are the children of a history which still sucks at the devil’s teats. at this 
writing, only england has held back before the temptations of contemporary diabolism. 
in the countries of the communist ideology, all resistance of any import is linked to the 
totally malign capitalist succubi, and in america any man who is not reactionary in his 
views is open to the charge of alliance with the red hell. political opposition, thereby, is 
given an inhumane overlay which then justifies the abrogation of all normally applied 
customs  of  civilized  inter-course.  a  political  policy  is  equated  with  moral  right,  and 
opposition to it with diabolical malevolence. once such an equation is effectively made, 
society becomes a congerie of plots and counterplots, and the main role of government 
changes from that of the arbiter to that of the scourge of god. 
the results of this process are no different now from what 

act one 

35 
 

they ever were, except sometimes in the degree of cruelty inflicted, and not always even 
in that department. normally the actions and deeds of a man were all that society felt 
com-fortable in judging, the secret intent of an action was left to the ministers, priests, 
and rabbis to deal with. when diabolism rises, however, actions are the least important 
manifests of the true nature of a man. the devil, as reverend hale said, is a wily one, 
and, until an hour before he fell, even god thought him beautiful in heaven. 

the analogy, however, seems to falter when one considers that, while there were no 
witches  then,  there  are  communists  and  capitalists  now,  and  in  each  camp  there  is 
certain  proof  that  spies  of  each  side  are  at  work  undermining  the  other.  but  this  is  a 
snobbish  objection  and  not  at  all  warranted by  the  facts.  i  have  no  doubt  that  people 
were communing with, and even worshiping, the devil in salem, and if the whole truth 
could  be  known  in  this  case,  as  it  is  in  others,  we  should  dis-cover  a  regular  and 
conventionalized'  propitiation  of  the  dark  spirit,  one  certain  evidence  of  this  is  the 
confession of tituba, the slave of reverend parris, and another is the behavior of the, 
children who were known to have indulged in sorceries with her. 

there are accounts of similar klatches in europe, where the daughters of the towns 
would assemble at night and, sometimes with fetishes, sometimes with a selected young 
man, give them-selves to love, with some bastardly results. the church, sharp-eyed as it 
must be when gods long dead are brought to life, condemned these orgies as witchcraft 
and interpreted them, rightly, as a resurgence of the dionysiac forces it had crushed long 
before. sex, sin, and the. devil were early linked, and so they continued to be in salem, 
and are today. from all accounts there are no more puritanical mores in the world than 
those enforced by the communists in russia, where women’s fashions, for instance, are 
as prudent and all-covering as any american baptist would desire. the divorce laws lay 
a tremendous re-sponsibility on the father for the care of his children. even the 

the crucible 

36 
 
laxity of divorce regulations in the early years of the revolution was undoubtedly a revulsion 
from  the  nineteenth-century  vic-torian  immobility  of  marriage  and  the  consequent  hypocrisy 
that developed from it. if for no other reasons, a state so power-ful, so jealous of the uniformity 
of its citizens, cannot long toler-ate the atomization of the family. and yet, in american eyes at 
least, there remains the conviction that the russian attitude toward women is lascivious. it is the 
devil working again, just as he is working within the slav who is shocked at the very idea of a 
woman’s disrobing herself in a burlesque show. our opposites are always robed in sexual sin, 
and it is from this unconscious conviction that demonology gains both its attractive sensuality 
and its capacity to infuriate and frighten. 

coming into salem now, reverend hale conceives of himself much as a young doctor on his 
first call. his painfully acquired armory of symptoms, catchwords, and diagnostic procedures 
are now to be put to use at last. the road from beverly is unusually busy this morning, and he 
has passed a hundred rumors that make him smile at the ignorance of the yeomanry in this most 
precise  science.  he  feels  himself  allied  with the  best  minds  of  europe  -  kings,  philosophers, 
scientists, and ecclesiasts of all churches. his goal is light, goodness and its preservation, and he 
knows the exaltation of the blessed whose intelligence, sharpened by minute examinations of 
enormous  tracts,  is  finally  called  upon  to  face  what  may  be  a  bloody  fight  with  the  fiend 
himself.

caught, defined, and calculated. in these books the devil stands stripped of all 
his brute disguises. here are all your familiar spirits - your incubi and succubi; 
your witches that go by land, by air, and by sea; your wizards of the night and 
of the day. have no fear now - we shall find him out if he has come among us,

to get her free.

rebecca: i wish i knew. she goes out; they feel resentful of her note of moral 
superiority. 

putnam, abruptly: come, mr. hale, let’s get on. sit you here. 

 

 

giles: mr. hale, i have always wanted to ask a learned man - what signifies the 
readin’ of strange books? 
 
hale: what books? 
giles: i cannot tell; she hides them, hale; who does 
this? 
 
giles: martha, my wife. i have waked at night many a time and found her in a 
corner, readin’ of a book. now what do you make of that? 
 
hale: why, that’s not necessarily - 
 
giles: it discomfits me! last night - mark this - i tried and tried and could not 
say my prayers. and then she close her book and walks out of the house, and 
suddenly - mark this - i could pray again! 
 

old  giles  must  be  spoken  for,  if  only  because  his  fate  was  to  be  so 
remarkable  and  so  different  from  that  of  all  the  others.  he  was  in  his  early 
eighties at this time, and was the most comical hero in the history. no man has 
ever been blamed for so much. if a cow was missed, the first thought was to 
look for her around corey’s house; a fire blazing up at night brought sus-picion 
of arson to his door. he didn’t give a hoot for public opinion, and only in his 
last years - after he had married martha - did he bother much with the church. 
that she stopped his prayer is very probable, but he forgot to say that he’d only 
recently learned any prayers and it didn’t take much to make him stumble over 
them. he was a crank and a nuisance, but 

act one 

41 
 
withal a deeply innocent and brave man. in court once he was asked if it were 
true that he had been frightened by the strange behavior of a hog and had then 
said he knew it to be the devil in an animal’s shape. “what frighted you?” he 
was asked. he forgot everything but the word “frighted,” and instantly replied, 
“i do not know that i ever spoke that word in my life,” 
 
hale: ah! the stoppage of prayer - that is strange. i’ll speak further on that with 
you. 
 
giles: i’m not sayin’ she’s touched the devil, now, but i’d admire to know what 
books she reads and why she hides them. ' she’ll not answer me, y’ see. 
 
hale: aye, we’ll discuss it. to all: now mark me, if the devil is in her you will 
witness some frightful wonders in this room, so please to keep your wits about 
you. mr. putnam, stand close in case she flies. now, betty, dear, will you sit 
up? putnam comes in closer, ready-handed. hale sits betty up, but she hangs 
limp  in  his  hands.  hmmm.  he  observes  her  carefully.  the  others  watch 
breathlessly.  can  you  hear  me?  i  am  john  hale,  minister  of  beverly.  i  have 
come to help you, dear. do you remember my two little girls in beverly? she 
does not stir in his hands. 
 
parris, in fright: how can it be the devil? why would he choose my house to 
strike? we have all manner of licentious . people in the village! 
 
hale: what victory would the devil have to win a soul already bad? it is the 
best the devil wants, and who is better than the minister? 
giles: that’s deep, mr, parris, deep, deep! 
paaris,  with  resolution  now:  betty!  answer  mr.  hale!  betty!  hale:  does 
someone  afflict  you,  child?  it  need  not  be  a  woman,  mind  you,  or  a  man. 
perhaps some bird invisible to others comes to you - perhaps a pig, a mouse, or 
any beast at all. is there

some figure bids you fly? the child remains limp in his hands. in silence he lays her back on the 
pillow now, holding out his hands toward her, he intones: in nomine domini sabaoth sui filiique 
ite ad infernos. she does not stir. he turns to abigail, his eyes narrowing. abigail, what sort of 
dancing were you doing with her in the forest? 
 
abigail: why - common dancing is all. 
 
parris: i think i ought to say that i - i saw a kettle in the grass where they were dancing. 
abigail: that were only soup. 
hale: what sort of soup were in this kettle, abigail?  
abigail: why, it were beans - and lentils, i think, and - 
 
hale: mr. parris, you did not notice, did you, any living thing in the kettle? a mouse, 
perhaps, a spider, a frog - ? 
 
parris, fearfully: i - do believe there were some movement - in the soup. 
 
abigail: that jumped in, we never put it in! 
 
hale, quickly: what jumped in? 
 
abigail: why, a very little frog jumped - 
 
parris: a frog, abby! 
 
hale, grasping abigail: abigail, it may be your cousin is dying. did you call the devil 
last night? 
 
abigail: i never called him! tituba, tituba... 
parris, blanched: she called the devil? 
hale: i should like to speak with tituba, 
parris: goody ann, will you bring her up? mrs, putnam exits.

enters with tituba, and instantly abigail points at tituba.

tituba: mister reverend, i never - 
hale, resolved now: tituba, i want you to wake this child.  
 
tituba: i have no power on this child, sir. 
 
hale: you most certainly do, and you will free her from it now! when did you compact 
with the devil? 
 
tituba: i don’t compact with no devil! 
 
parris:  you will confess yourself or i will take you out and whip you to your death, 
tituba! 
 
putnam: this woman must be hanged! she must be taken and hanged! 
 
tituba, terrified, falls to her knees: no, no, don’t hang tituba! i tell him i don’t desire 
to work for him, sir.

hale:  then  you  saw  him!  tituba  weeps.  now  tituba,  i  know  that  when  we  bind 
ourselves to hell it is very hard to break with it. we are going to help you tear yourself 
free - 
 
tituba,  frightened  by  the  coming  process:  mister  reverend,  i  do  believe 
somebody else be witchin’ these children. 
 
hale: who? 
 
tituba: i don’t know, sir, but the devil got him numerous witches. 
 
hale: does he! it is a clue. tituba, look into my eyes. come, look into me. she 
raises her eyes to his fearfully. you would be a good christian woman, would 
you not, tituba? 
tituba: aye, sir, a good christian woman. 
hale: and you love these little children? 
tituba: oh, yes, sir, i don’t desire to hurt little children. 
hale: and you love god, tituba? 
tituba: i love god with all my bein’. 
hale: now, in god’s holy name - 
 
tituba: bless him. bless him. she is rocking on her kness, sobbing in terror. 
hale: and to his glory - 
tituba: eternal glory. bless him - bless god... 
 
hale: open yourself, tituba - open yourself and let,god’s holy light shine on 
you. 
 
tituba: oh, bless the lord. 
 
hale: when the devil comes to you does he ever come - with another person? 
she stares up into his face, perhaps another person in the village? someone you 
know. 
 
parris: who came with him? 

the crucible

putnam: sarah good? did you ever see sarah good with him? or osburn? 
 
parris: was it man or woman came with him? 
 
tituba: man or woman. was - was woman. 
 
parris: what woman? a woman, you said. what woman? 
 
tituba: it was black dark, and i - 
 
parris: you could see him, why could you not see her? 
 
tituba: well, they was always talking; they was always runnin’ round and 
carryin’ on - 
 
parris: you mean out of salem? salem witches? 
 
tituba: i believe so, yes, sir. 
 
now hale takes her hand. she is surprised. 
 
hale: tituba. you must have no fear to tell us who they are, do you understand? 
we will protect you. the devil can never overcome a minister. you know that, 
do you not? 
 
tituba, kisses hale’s hand: aye, sir, oh, i do. 
 
hale: you have confessed yourself to witchcraft, and that speaks a wish to come 
to heaven’s side. and we will bless you, tituba. 
 
tituba, deeply relieved: oh, god bless you, mr. hale! 
 
hale,  with  rising  exaltation:  you  are  god’s  instrument  put  in  our  hands  to 
discover the devil’s agents among us. you are selected, tituba, you are chosen 
to help us cleanse our village. so speak utterly, tituba, turn your back on him 
and face god - face god, tituba, and god will protect you. 
 
tituba, joining with him: oh, god, protect tituba! 
 
hale, kindly: who came to you with the devil? two? three? four? how many?

tituba pants, and begins rocking back and forth again, staring ahead. 
 
tituba: there was four. there was four. 
 
parris, pressing in on her: who? who? their names, their names! 
 
tituba,  suddenly  bursting  out:  oh,  how  many  times  he  bid  me  .kill  you,  mr. 
parris! 
 
parris: kill me! 
 
tituba, in a fury: he say mr. parris must be kill! mr. parris no goodly man, 
mr. parris mean man and no gentle man, and he bid me rise out of my bed and 
cut your throat! they gasp. but i tell him “no! i don’t hate that man. i don’t 
want kill that man.” but he say, “you work for me, tituba, and i make you free! 
i give you pretty dress to wear, and put you way high up in the air, and you 
gone fly back to barbados!” and i say, “you lie, devil, you lie!” and then he 
come one stormy night to me, and he say, “look! i have white people belong to 
me.” and i look - and there was goody good. 
 
parris: sarah good! 
 
tituba, rocking and weeping: aye, sir, and goody osburn. 
 
mrs.  putnam:  i  knew  it!  goody  osburn  were  midwife  to  me  three  times.  i 
begged  you,  thomas,  did  i  not?  i  begged  him  not  to  call  osburn  because  i 
feared her. my babies always shriveled in her hands! 
 
hale: take courage, you must give us all their names. how can you bear to see 
this child suffering? look at her, tituba. he is indicating betty on the bed. look 
at her god-given innocence; her soul is so tender; we must protect her, tituba; 
the devil is out and preying on her like a beast upon the mesh of the pure lamb. 
god will bless you for your help.

abigail rises, staring as though inspired, and cries out. 
 
' abigail: i want to open myself! they turn to her, startled. she is enraptured, as though 
in a pearly light. i want the light of god, i want the sweet love of jesus! i danced for 
the devil; i saw him; i wrote in his book; i go back to jesus; i kiss his hand. i saw 
sarah good with the devil! i saw goody osburn with the devil! i saw bridget bishop 
with the devil! 

 

as she is speaking, betty is rising from the bed, a fever in her eyes, and picks up the 
chant. 
 
betty, staring too: i saw george jacobs with the devil! i saw goody howe with the 
devil! 
parris: she speaks! he rushes to embrace betty. she speaks! hale: glory to god! it is 
broken, they are free! 
 
betty,  calling  out  hysterically  and  with  great  relief:  i  saw  martha  bellows  with  the 
devil!

the common room of proctor’s house, eight days later. 
 
at the right is a door opening on the fields outside. a fireplace is at the left, and behind 
it a stairway leading upstairs. it is the low, dark, and rather long living room of the 
time.  as  the  curtain  rises,  the  room  is  empty.  from  above,  elizabeth  is  heard  softly 
singing to the children. presently the door opens and john proctor enters, carrying his 
gun.  he  glances  about  the  room  as  he  comes  toward  the  fireplace, then halts for an 
instant as he hears her singing. he continues on to the fireplace, leans the gun against 
the wall as he swings a pot out of the fire and smells it. then he lifts out the ladle and 
tastes. he is not quite pleased. he reaches to a cupboard, takes a pinch of salt, and 
drops it into the pot. as he is tasting again, her footsteps are heard on the stair. he 
swings the pot into the fireplace and goes to a basin and washes his hands and face, 
elizabeth enters. 
 
elizabeth: what keeps you so late? it’s almost dark.  
 
proctor: i were planting far out to the forest edge. elizabeth: oh, you’re done 
then. 
proctor: aye, the farm is seeded. the boys asleep?

elizabeth: they will be soon. and she goes to the fireplace, proceeds to ladle up stew in 
a dish. 
 
proctor: pray now for a fair summer. 
 
elizabeth: aye. 
 
proctor: are you well today? 
 
elizabeth: i am. she brings the plate to the table, and, indi-cating the food:. it is 
a rabbit. 
 
proctor, going to the table: oh, is it! in jonathan’s trap? 
 
elizabeth: no, she walked into the house this afternoon; i found her sittin’ in the 
corner like she come to visit. 
 
proctor: oh, that’s a good sign walkin’ in. 
 
elizabeth: pray god. it hurt my heart to strip her, poor rabbit. she sits and 
watches him taste it. 
 
proctor: it’s well seasoned. 
 
elizabeth, blushing with pleasure: i took great care. she’s tender? 
 
proctor: aye. he eats. she watches him. i think we’ll see green fields soon. it’s 
warm as blood beneath the clods. 
elizabeth: that’s well. 
proctor eats, then looks up. 
 
proctor: if the crop is good i’ll buy george jacob’s heifer. how would that 
please you? 
 
elizabeth: aye, it would. 
 
proctor, with a grin: i mean to please you, elizabeth. 
 
elizabeth - it is hard to say: i know it, john. 
 
he gets up, goes to her, kisses her. she receives it. with a certain 
disappointment, he returns to the table.

 act two proctor, as gently as he can: cider? 
 
elizabeth, with a sense of reprimanding herself for having forgot: aye! she gets up and 
goes and pours a glass for him. he now arches his back. 
 
proctor: this farm’s a continent when you go foot by foot droppin’ seeds in it. 
 
elizabeth, coming with the cider: it must be. 
 
proctor, drinks a long draught, then, putting the glass down: you ought to bring some 
flowers in the house. 
 
elizabeth: oh! i forgot! i will tomorrow. 
 
proctor: it’s winter in here yet. on sunday let you come with me, and we’ll walk the 
farm together; i never see such a load of flowers on the earth. with good feeling he goes 
and looks up at the sky through the open doorway. lilacs have a purple smell. lilac is 
the smell of nightfall, i think. massachusetts is a beauty in the spring! 
 
elizabeth: aye, it is. 
 
there is a pause. she is watching him from the table as he stands there absorbing the 
night. it is as though she would speak but cannot. instead, now, she takes up his plate 
and glass and fork and goes with them to the basin. her back is turned to him. he turns 
to her and watches her. a sense of their separation rises. 
 
proctor: i think you’re sad again. are you? 
 
elizabeth - she doesn’t want friction, and yet she must: you come so late i thought 
you’d gone to salem this afternoon. 
proctor: why? i have no business in salem. 
elizabeth: you did speak of going, earlier this week. proctor - he knows what she 
means: i thought better of it since. 

the crucible 

52 
 
elizabeth: mary warren’s there today, 
 
proctor: why’d you let her? you heard me forbid her go to salem any morel 
 
elizabeth: i couldn’t stop her. 
 
proctor,  holding  back  a  full  condemnation  of  her:  it  is  a  fault,  it  is  a  fault, 
elizabeth - you’re the mistress here, not mary warren. 
 
elizabeth: she frightened all my strength away. 
 
proctor: how may that mouse frighten you, elizabeth? you - 
 
elizabeth: it is a mouse no more. i forbid her go, and she raises up her chin like 
the daughter of a prince and lays to me, “i must go to salem, goody proctor; i 
am an official of the court!” 
 
proctor: court! what court? 
 
elizabeth: aye, it is a proper court they have now. they’ve sent four judges out 
of boston, she says, weighty magistrates of the general court, and at the head 
sits the deputy governor of the province. 
 
proctor, astonished: why, she’s mad. 
 
elizabeth: i would to god she were. there be fourteen people in the jail now, 
she says. proctor simply looks at her, unable to grasp it. and they’ll be tried, 
and the court have power to hang them too, she says. 
 
proctor, scoffing, but without conviction: ah, they’d never hang - 
 
elizabeth: the deputy governor promise hangin’ if they’ll not confess, john. 
the town’s gone wild, i think. she speak of abigail, and i thought she were a 
saint, to hear her. abigail brings the other girls into the court, and where she 
walks the

53 
 
crowd will part like the sea for israel. and folks are brought before them, and if 
they scream and howl and fall to the floor - the person’s clapped in the jail for 
bewitchin’ them. 
 
proctor, wide-eyed: oh, it is a black mischief. 
 
elizabeth: i think you must go to salem, john. he turns to her. i think so. you 
must tell them it is a fraud. 
 
proctor, thinking beyond this: aye, it is, it is surely. 
 
elizabeth:  let  you  go  to  ezekiel  cheever  -  he  knows you well. and tell him 
what she said to you last week in her uncle’s house. she said it had naught to do 
with witchcraft, did she not? 
 
proctor, in thought: aye, she did, she did. now, a pause. 
 
elizabeth, quietly, fearing to anger him by prodding: god for-bid you keep that 
from the court, john. i think they must be told. 
 
proctor, quietly, struggling with his thought: aye, they must, they must. it is a 
wonder they do believe her. 
 
elizabeth: i would go to salem now, john - let you go tonight. 
 
proctor: i’ll think on it. 
 
elizabeth, with her courage now: you cannot keep it, john, 
 
proctor, angering: i know i cannot keep it. i say i will think on it! 
 
elizabeth, hurt, and very coldly: good, then, let you think on it. she stands and 
starts to walk out of the room. 
 
proctor: i am only wondering how i may prove what she told me, elizabeth. if 
the girl’s a saint now, i think it is not easy to prove she’s fraud, and the town 
gone so silly. she told it to me in a room alone - i have no proof for it. 
 
elizabeth: you were alone with her? 

the crucible 

54 
proctor, stubbornly: for a moment alone, aye. elizabeth: why, then, it 
is not as you told me. 
 
proctor, his anger rising: for a moment, i say. the others come in soon after. 
 
elizabeth, quietly - she has suddenly lost all faith in him: do as you wish, then. 
she starts to turn. 
 
proctor: woman. she turns to him. i’ll not have your sus-picion any more. 
elizabeth, a little loftily: i have no - 
proctor: i’ll not have it! 
elizabeth: then let you not earn it. 
proctor, with a violent undertone: you doubt me yet? 
 
elizabeth, with a smile, to keep her dignity: john, if it were not abigail that you 
must go to hurt, would you falter now? i think not. 
proctor: now look you - 
elizabeth: i see what i see, john. 
 
proctor, with solemn warning: you will not judge me more, elizabeth. i have 
good reason to think before i charge fraud on abigail, and i will think on it. let 
you look to your own im-provement before you go to judge your husband any 
more. i have forgot abigail, and - 
 
elizabeth: and i. 
 
proctor:  spare  me!  you  forget  nothin’  and  forgive  nothin’.  learn  charity, 
woman. i have gone tiptoe in this house all seven month since she is gone. i 
have not moved from there to there without i think to please you, and still an 
everlasting funeral marches round your heart. i cannot speak but i am

doubted, every moment judged for lies, as though i come into a court when i come into 
this house! 
 
elizabeth: john, you are not open with me. you saw her with a crowd, you said. now 
you - 
 
proctor: i’ll plead my honesty no more, elizabeth. 
 
elizabeth - now she would justify herself: john, i am only - 
 
proctor:  no  more!  i  should  have  roared  you  down  when  first  you  told  me  your 
suspicion. but i wilted, and, like a christian, i confessed. confessed! some dream i had 
must  have  mistaken  you  for  god  that  day.  but  you’re  not,  you’re  not,  and  let  you 
remember it! let you look sometimes for the goodness in me, and judge me not. 
 
elizabeth: i do not,judge you. the magistrate sits in your heart that judges you. i never 
thought you but a good man, john - with a smile - only somewhat bewildered. 
 
proctor,  laughing  bitterly:  oh,  elizabeth,  your  justice  would  freeze  beer!  he  turns 
suddenly  toward  a  sound  outside.  he  starts  for  the  door  as  mary  warren  enters.  as 
soon as he sees her, he goes directly to her and grabs her by her cloak, furious. how do 
you go to salem when i forbid it? do you mock me? shaking her. i’ll whip you if you 
dare leave this house again! 
 

mary  warren:  i  am  sick,  i  am  sick,  mr.  proctor.  pray,  pray,  hurt  me  not.  her 
strangeness  throws  him  op,  and  her  evident  pallor  and  weakness.  he  frees  her.  my 
insides are all shuddery; i am in the proceedings all day, sir. 
 
proctor,  with  draining  anger  -  his  curiosity  is  draining  it:.  and  what  of  these 
proceedings  here?  when  will  you  proceed  to  keep  this  house,  as  you  are  paid  nine 
pound a year to do - and my wife not wholly well? 

strangely, she doesn’t resist him, but hangs limply by his grip.

as  though  to  compensate,  mary  warren  goes  to  elizabeth  with  a  small  rag 
doll. 
 
mary  warren:  i  made  a  gift  for  you  today,  goody  proctor.  i  had  to  sit  long 
hours in a chair, and passed the time with sewing. 
 
elizabeth, perplexed, looking at the doll: why, thank you, it’s a fair poppet. 
 
mary warren, with a trembling, decayed voice: we must all love each other 
now, goody proctor. 
 

mary warren, glancing at the room: i’ll get up early in the morning and clean 
the house. i must sleep now. she turns and starts off. 
 
proctor: mary. she halts. is it true? there be fourteen women arrested? 
 
mary warren: no, sir. there be thirty-nine now - she sud-denly breaks op and 
sobs and sits down, exhausted. 
elizabeth: why, she’s weepin'! what ails you, child? 
mary warren: goody osburn - will hang! 
there is a shocked pause, while she sobs. 
proctor: hang! he calls into her face. hang, y’say? 
mary warren, through her weeping: aye. 
proctor: the deputy governor will permit it? 
 
mary warren: he sentenced her. he must. to ameliorate it: but not sarah 
good. for sarah good confessed, y’see. 
 
proctor: confessed' to what? 
 
mary  warren:  that  she  -  in  horror  at  the  memory  -  she  some-times  made  a 
compact with lucifer, and wrote her name in his

black book - with her blood - and bound herself to torment christians till god’s thrown 
down - and we all must worship hell forevermore, 
 
pause. 
 
proctor: but - surely you know what a jabberer she is. did you tell them that? 
 
mary  warren:  mr.  proctor,  in  open  court  she  near  to  choked  us  all  to 
death. 
 
proctor: how, choked you? 
 
mary warren: she sent her spirit out. 
 
elizabeth: oh, mary, mary, surely you - 
 
mary warren, with an indignant edge: she tried to kill me many times, goody 
proctor! 
 
elizabeth: why, i never heard you mention that before. 
 
mary warren: i never knew it before. i never knew anything before. when she 
come into the court i say to myself, i must not accuse this woman, for she sleep 
in ditches, and so very old and poor. but then - then she sit there, denying and 
denying, and i feel a misty coldness climbin’ up my back, and the skin on my 
skull begin to creep, and i feel a clamp around my neck and i cannot breathe air; 
and then - entranced - i hear a voice, a screamin’ voice, and it were my voice - 
and all at once i re-membered everything she done to me! 
 
proctor: why? what did she do to you? 
 
mary warren, like one awakened to a marvelous secret in-sight: so many time, 
mr. proctor, she come to this very door, beggin’ bread and a cup of cider - and 
mark this: whenever i turned her away empty, she mumbled. 
 
elizabeth: mumbled! she may mumble if she’s hungry. 

58 the crucible 
 
mary  warren:  but  what  does  she  mumble?  you  must  re-member,  goody 
proctor. last month - a monday, i think - she walked away, and i thought my 
guts would burst for two days after. do you remember it? 
 
elizabeth: why - i do, i think, but - 
 
mary warren: and so i told that to judge hathorne, and he asks her so. “sarah 
good,” says he, “what curse do you mumble that this girl must fall sick after 
turning you away?” and then she replies - mimicking an old crone - "why, your 
excellence, no curse at all. i only say my commandments; i hope i may say my 
commandments,” says she! 
 
elizabeth: and that’s an upright answer. 
 
mary  warren:  aye,  but  then  judge  hathorne  say,  “recite  for  us  your 
commandments!” - leaning avidly toward them - and of all the ten she could not 
say a single one. she never knew no commandments, and they had her in a flat 
lie! 
 
proctor: and so condemned her? 
 
mary warren, now a little strained, seeing his stubborn doubt: why, they must 
when she condemned herself. 
 
proctor: but the proof, the proof! 
 
mary warren, with greater impatience with him: i told you the proof. it’s hard 
proof, hard as rock, the judges said. 
 
proctor, pauses an instant, then: you will not go to court again, mary warren. 
 
mary warren: i must tell you, sir, i will be gone every day now. i am amazed 
you do not see what weighty work we do. 
 
proctor: what work you do! it’s strange work for a christian girl to hang old 
women! 
 
mary warren: but, mr. proctor, they will not hang them it

they confess. sarah good will only sit in jail some time - recall-ing - and here’s 
a wonder for you; think on this. goody good is pregnant! 
 
elizabeth: pregnant! are they mad? the woman’s near to sixty! 
 
mary warren: they had doctor griggs examine her, and she’s full to the brim. 
and smokin’ a pipe all these years, and no husband either! but she’s safe, thank 
god, for they’ll not hurt the innocent child, but be that not a marvel? you must 
see it, sir, it’s god’s work we do. so i’ll be gone every day for some time. i’m - 
i  am  an  official  of  the  court,  they  say,  and  i  -  she  has  been  edging  toward 
onstage. 
 
proctor: i’ll official you! he strides to the mantel, takes down the whip hanging 
there. 
 
mary  warren,  terrified,  but  coming  erect,  striving  for  her  au-thority:  i’ll  not 
stand whipping any more! 
 
elizabeth, hurriedly, as proctor approaches: mary, promise now you’ll stay at 
home - 
 
mary  warren,  backing  from  him,  but  keeping  her  erect  pos-ture,  striving, 
striving for her way: the devil’s loose in salem, mr. proctor; we must discover 
where he’s hiding! 
 
proctor! i’ll whip the devil out of you! with whip raised he reaches out for her, 
and she streaks away and yells. 
 
mary warren, pointing at elizabeth: i saved her life today! 
 
silence. his whip comes down. 
 
elizabeth, softly: i am accused? 
 
mary  warren, quaking: somewhat mentioned. but i said 1 never see no sign 
you ever sent your spirit out to hurt no one, and seeing i do live so closely with 
you, they dismissed it.

mary  warren:  i  am  bound  by  law,  i  cannot  tell  it.  to proctor:  i  only  hope you’ll not be so 
sarcastical no more. four judges and the king’s deputy sat to dinner with us but an hour ago. i - 
i would have you speak civilly to me, from this out. 
 
proctor, in horror, muttering in disgust at her: go to bed. 
 
mary warren, with a stamp of her foot: i’ll not be ordered to bed no more, mr. proctor! i am 
eighteen and a woman, how-ever single! 
 
proctor: do you wish to sit up? then sit up. 
 
mary warren: i wish to go to bed! 
 
proctor, in anger: good night, then! 
 
mary  warren:  good  night.  dissatisfied,  uncertain  of  herself,  she  goes  out.  wide-eyed,  both, 
proctor and elizabeth stand staring.

proctor: there’ll be no noose.

proctor: sit you down. 
 
elizabeth: she wants me dead, john, you know it!

must be wise, elizabeth.

elizabeth: john, with so many in the jail, more than cheever’s help is needed 
now, i think. would you favor me with this? go to abigail. 
 
proctor, his soul hardening as he senses... : what have i to say to abigail? 
 
elizabeth, delicately: john - grant me this. you have a faulty understanding of 
young girls. there is a promise made in any bed - 
 
proctor, striving against his anger: what promise! 
 
elizabeth: spoke or silent, a promise is surely made. and she may dote on it 
now - i am sure she does - and thinks to kill me, then to take my place. 
 
proctor’s anger is rising; he cannot speak. 
 
elizabeth: it is her dearest hope, john, i know it. there be a thousand names; 
why does she call mine? there be a certain danger in calling such a name - i am 
no goody good that sleeps in ditches, nor osburn, drunk and half-witted. she’d 
dare not call out such a farmer’s wife but there be monstrous profit in it. she 
thinks to take my place, john, 
 
proctor: she cannot think it! he knows it is true. 
 
elizabeth,  “reasonably”:  john,  have  you  ever  shown  her  some-what  of 
contempt? she cannot pass you in the church but you will blush - 
 
proctor: i may blush for my sin. 
 
elizabeth: i think she sees another meaning in that blush. 
 
proctor: and what see you? what see you, elizabeth?

elizabeth, “conceding”: i think you be somewhat ashamed, far i am there, and she so 
close. 
 
proctor: when will you know me, woman? were i stone 1 would have cracked 
for shame this seven month! 
 
elizabeth: then go and tell her she’s a whore. whatever promise she may sense 
- break it, john, break it. 
 
proctor, between his teeth: good, then. i’ll go. he starts for his rifle. 
 
elizabeth, trembling, fearfully: oh, how unwillingly! 
 
proctor,  turning  on  her,  ripe  in  hand:  i  will  curse  her  hotter  than  the  oldest 
cinder in hell. but pray, begrudge me not my anger! 
 
elizabeth: your anger! i only ask you - 
 
proctor: woman, am i so base? do you truly think me base? 
 
elizabeth: i never called you base. 
 
proctor: then how do you charge me with such a promise? the promise that a 
stallion gives a mare i gave that girl! 
 
elizabeth: then why do you anger with me when i bid you break it? 
 
proctor: because it speaks deceit, and i am honest! but i’ll plead no more! i see 
now your spirit twists around the single error of my life, and i will never tear it 
free! 
 
elizabeth, crying out: you’ll tear it free - when you come to know that i will be 
your only wife, or no wife at all! she has an arrow in you yet, john proctor, and 
you know it well! 
 
quite suddenly, as though from the air, a figure appears in the doorway. they 
start slightly. 1t is mr. hale. he is different now - drawn a little, and there is a 
quality of deference, even of guilt, about his manner now.

hale: good evening. 
 
 
proctor, still in his shock: why, mr. hale! good evening to you, sir. come in, come in. 
 
hale, to elizabeth: i hope i do not startle you. 
 
elizabeth: no, no, it’s only that i heard no horse - 
 
hale: you are goodwife proctor. 
 
proctor: aye; elizabeth. 
 
hale, nods, then: i hope you’re not off to bed yet. 
 
proctor, setting down his gun: no, no. hale comes further into the room. and 
proctor, to explain his nervousness: we are not used to visitors after dark, but 
you’re welcome here. will you sit you down, sir? 
 
hale: i will. he sits. let you sit, goodwife proctor. 
 
she  does,  never  letting  him  out  of  her  sight.  there  is  a  pause  as  hale  looks 
about the room. 
 
proctor, to break the silence: will you drink cider, mr. hale? 
 
hale: no, it rebels my stomach; i have some further traveling yet tonight. sit 
you down, sir. proctor sits. i will not keep you long, but i have some business 
with you. 
 
proctor: business of the court? 
 
hale: no - no, i come of my own, without the court’s author-ity. hear me. he 
wets his lips. i know not if you are aware, but your wife’s name is - mentioned 
in the court. 
 
proctor: we know it, sir. our mary warren told us. we are entirely amazed. 
 
hale: i am a stranger here, as you know. and in my ignorance i find it hard to 
draw a clear opinion of them that come accused before the court. and so this 
afternoon, and now tonight, i go 

the crucible 

64 
from house to house - i come now from rebecca nurse’s house and - 
 
elizabeth, shocked: rebecca’s charged! 
 
hex,a:  god  forbid  such  a  one  be  charged.  she  is,  however  -  mentioned 
somewhat. 
 
elizabeth,  with  an  attempt  at  a  laugh:  you  will  never  believe,  i  hope,  that 
rebecca trafficked with the devil. 
hale: woman, it is possible. 
proctor: taken aback: surely you cannot think so. 
 
hale: this is a strange time, mister. no man may longer doubt the powers of 
the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village. there is too much 
evidence now to deny it. you will agree, sir? 
 
proctor, evading: i - have no knowledge in that line. but it’s hard to think so 
pious  a  woman  be  secretly  a  devil’s  bitch  after  seventy  year  of  such  good 
prayer. 
 
hale: aye. but the devil is a wily one, you cannot deny it. however, she is far 
from  accused,  and  i  know  she  will  not  be. pause.  i  thought,  sir,  to  put  some 
questions as to the christian character of this house, if you’ll permit me. 
 
proctor, coldly, resentful: why, we - have no fear of ques-tions, sir. 
 
hale: good, then. he makes himself more comfortable. in the book of record 
that mr. parris keeps, i note that you are rarely in the church on sabbath day. 
 
proctor: no, sir, you are mistaken. 
 
hale: twenty-six time in seventeen month, sir. i must call that rare. will you 
tell me why you are so absent? 
 

proctor: mr. hale, i never knew i must account to that man 

act two 

65 

for i come to church or stay at home. my wife were sick this winter. 
 
hale: so i am told. but you, mister, why could you not come alone? 
 
proctor: i surely did come when i could, and when i could not i prayed in this house. 
 
hale: mr. proctor, your house is not a church; your theology must tell you that. 
 
proctor: it does, sir, it does; and it tells me that a minister may pray to god without he 
have golden candlesticks upon the altar. 
 
hale: what golden candlesticks? 
 
proctor:  since  we  built  the  church  there  were  pewter  candle-sticks  upon  the  altar; 
francis  nurse  made them, y’know, and a sweeter hand never touched the metal. but 
parris came, and for twenty week he preach nothin’ but golden candlesticks until he had 
them. i labor the earth from dawn of day to blink of night, and i tell you true, when i 
look to heaven and see my money glaring at his elbows - it hurt my prayer, sir, it hurt 
my  prayer.  i  think,  sometimes,  the  man  dreams  cathedrals,  not  clapboard  meetin’ 
houses. 
 
hale,  thinks,  then:  and  yet,  mister,  a  christian  on  sabbath  day  must  be  in  church. 
pause. tell me - you have three chil-dren? 
 
proctor: aye. boys. 
 
hale: how comes it that only two are baptized? 
 
proctor, starts 'o speak, then stops, then, as though unable to restrain this: i like it not 
that mr. parris should lay his hand upon my baby. i see no light of god in that man. i’ll 
not conceal it. 

 

 the crucible 

 66 
 
hale:  i  must  say  it,  mr.  proctor;  that  is  not  for  you  to  decide.  the  man’s  ordained, 
therefore the light of god is in him. 
 
proctor, flushed with resentment but trying to smile: what’s your suspicion, mr. 
hale? 
 
hale; no, no, i have no - 
 
proctor: i nailed the roof upon the church, i hung the door - 
 
hale: oh, did you! that’s a good sign, then. 
 
proctor:  it  may  be  i  have  been  too  quick  to  bring  the  man  to  book,  but  you 
cannot think we ever desired the destruction of religion. i think that’s in your 
mind, is it not? 
 
hale, not altogether giving way: i - have - there is a softness in your record, sir, 
a softness. 
 
elizabeth: i think, maybe, we have been too hard with mr. parris. i think so. but 
sure we never loved the devil here. 
 
hale, nods, deliberating this. then, with the voice of one ad-ministering a secret 
test: do you know your commandments, elizabeth? 
 
elizabeth,  without  hesitation,  even  eagerly:  i  surely  do.  there  be  no  mark  of 
blame upon my life, mr. hale. i am a covenanted christian woman. 
hale: and you, mister? 
proctor, a tripe unsteadily: i - am sure i do, sir. 
 
hale, glances at her open face, then at john, then: let you re-peat them, if you 
will. 
proctor: the commandments. 
hale: aye. 
proctor, looking off, beginning to sweat: thou shalt not kill. 

 67 

 

 act two 

hale: aye. 
 
 
proctor, counting on his angers: thou shalt not steal. thou shalt not covet thy neighbor’s goods, 
nor make unto thee any graven image. thou shalt not take the name of the lord in vain; thou 
shalt have no other gods before me. with some hesitation: thou shalt remember the sabbath day 
and keep it holy. pause. then: thou shalt honor thy father and mother. thou shalt not bear false 
witness. he is stuck. he counts back on his fingers, knowing one is missing. thou shalt not make 
unto thee any graven image. 
hale: you have said that twice, sir. proctor, lost: aye. he is failing 
for it. elizabeth, delicately: adultery, john. 
 
proctor, as though a secret arrow had pained his heart: aye. trying to grin it away - to 
hale:  you  see,  sir,  between  the  two  of  us  we  do  know  them  all.  hale  only  looks  at 
proctor, deep in his attempt to define this man, proctor grows more uneasy. i think it be 
a small fault. 
 
hale:  theology,  sir,  is  a  fortress;  no  crack  in  a  fortress  may  be  accounted  small.  he 
rises; he seems worried now. he paces a little, in deep thought. 
 

proctor: there be no love for satan in this house, mister. 

 

hale: i pray it, i pray it dearly. he looks to both of them, an attempt at a smile on his 
face, but his misgivings are clear. well, then - i’ll bid you good night. 
 
elizabeth, unable to restrain herself: mr. hale. he turns. i do think you are suspecting 
me somewhat? are you not? 
 
hale, obviously disturbed - and evasive: goody proctor, i do not judge you. my duty is 
to add what i may to the godly

wisdom  of  the  court.  i  pray  you  both  good  health  and  good  fortune.  to  john:  good 
night, sir. he starts out. 
 
elizabeth, with a note of desperation: i think you must tell him, john. 
hale: what’s that? 
elizabeth, restraining a call: will you tell him? 
slight pause. hale looks questioningly at john. 
 
proctor,  with  difficulty:  i  -  i  have  no  witness  and  cannot  prove  it,  except  my 
word  be  taken.  but  i  know  the  children’s  sickness  had  naught  to  do  with 
witchcraft. 
 
hale, stopped, struck: naught to do - ? 
 
proctor: mr. parris discovered them sportin' in the woods. they were startled 
and took sick. 
pause. 
hale: who told you this? 
proctor, hesitates, then: abigail williams. 
hale: abigail! 
proctor: aye. 
 
hale, his eyes wide: abigail williams told you it had naught to do with 
witchcraft! 
 
proctor: she told me the day you came, sir. 
 
hale, suspiciously: why - why did you keep this? 
 
proctor:  i  never  knew  until  tonight  that  the  world  is  gone  daft  with  this 
nonsense. 
 
hale:  nonsense!  mister,  i  have  myself  examined  tituba,  sarah  good,  and 
numerous  others  that  have  confessed  to  dealing  with  the  devil.  they  have 
confessed it. 

 

 69 

 act two 

 
 
proctor: and why not, if they must hang for denyin’ it? there are them that will swear 
to anything before they’ll hang; have you never thought of that? 
 
hale:  i  have.  i  -  i  have  indeed.  it  is  his  own  suspicion,  but  he  resists  it.  he 
glances at elizabeth, then at john. and you - would you testify to this in court? 
 
proctor: i - had not reckoned with goin’ into court. but if i must i will. 
 
hale: do you falter here? 
 
proctor: i falter nothing, but i may wonder if my story will be credited in such a 
court.  i  do  wonder  on  it,  when  such  a  steady-minded  minister  as  you  will 
suspicion such a woman that never lied, and cannot, and the world knows she 
cannot! i may falter somewhat, mister; i am no fool. 
 
hale, quietly - it has impressed him: proctor, let you open with me now, for i 
have a rumor that troubles me.' it’s said you hold no belief that there may even 
be witches in the world. is that true, sir? 
 
proctor - he knows this is critical, and is striving against his disgust with hale 
and with himself for even answering: i know not what i have said, i may have 
said  it.  i  have  wondered  if  there  be  witches  in  the  world  -  although  i  cannot 
believe they come among us now. 
 
hale: then you do not believe - 
 
proctor: i have no knowledge of it; the bible speaks of witches, and i will not 
deny them. 
 
hale: and you, woman? 
 
elizabeth: i - i cannot believe it. 
 
hale, shocked: you cannot! 

the crucible 

70 
 
proctor: elizabeth, you bewilder him! 
 
elizabeth, to hale: i cannot think the devil may own a woman’s soul, mr. hale, 
when she keeps an upright way, as i have. i am a good woman, i know it; and if 
you believe i may do only good work in the world, and yet be secretly bound to 
satan, then i must tell you, sir, i do not believe it. 
 
hale: but, woman, you do believe there are witches in - 
 
elizabeth: if you think that i am one, then i say there are none. 
 
hale: you surely do not fly against the gospel, the gospel - 
 
proctor: she believe in the gospel, every word! 
 
elizabeth: question abigail williams about the gospel, not myself! 
 
hale stares at her. 
 
proctor: she do not mean to doubt the gospel, sir, you can-not think it. this be 
a christian house, sir, a christian house. 
 
hale: god keep you both; let the third child be quickly baptized, and go you 
without fail each sunday in to sabbath prayer; and keep a solemn, quiet way 
among you. i think - 
giles corey appears in doorway. 
giles: john! 
proctor: giles! what’s the matter? 
giles: they take my wife. 
francis nurse enters. 
giles: and his rebecca! 
proctor, to francis: rebecca’s in the jail1 
francis: aye, cheever come and take her in his wagon. we’ve

only now come from the jail, and they’ll not even let us in to see them. 
 
elizabeth: they’ve surely gone wild now, mr. hale! 
 
francis,  going  to  hale:  reverend  hale!  can  you  not  speak  to  the  deputy 
governor? i’m sure he mistakes these people - 
 
hale: pray calm yourself, mr. nurse. 
 
francis:  my  wife  is  the  very  brick  and  mortar  of  the  church,  mr..  hale  - 
indicating giles - and martha corey, there cannot be a woman closer yet to god 
than martha. 
 
hale: how is rebecca charged, mr. nurse? 
 
francis,  with  a  mocking,  half-hearted  laugh:  for  murder,  she’s  charged! 
mockingly quoting the warrant: “for the marvelous and supernatural murder of 
goody putnam’s babies.” what am i to do, mr. hale? 
 
hale,  turns  from  francis,  deeply  troubled,  then:  believe  me,  mr.  nurse,  if 
rebecca  nurse  be  tainted,  then  nothing’s  left  to  stop  the  whole  green  world 
from burning. let you rest upon the justice of the court; the court will send her 
home, i know it. 
 
francis: you cannot mean she will be tried in court! 
 
hale, pleading: nurse, though our hearts break, we cannot flinch; these are new 
times, sir. there is a misty plot afoot so subtle we should be criminal to cling to 
old  respects  and  ancient  friendships.  i have seen too many frightful proofs in 
court - the devil is alive in salem, and we dare not quail to follow wherever the 
accusing finger points! 
 
proctor, angered: how may such a woman murder children? 
 
hale, in great pain: man, remember, until an hour before the devil fell, god 
thought him beautiful in heaven. 
 
giles:  i  never  said  my  wife  were  a  witch,  mr.  hale;  i  only  said  she  were 
reading books! 

the crucible 

72 
 
hale: mr. corey, exactly what complaint were made on your wife? 
 
giles: that bloody mongrel walcott charge her. y’see, he buy a pig of my wife 
four or five year ago, and the pig died soon after. so he come dancin’ in for his 
money back. so my martha, she says to him, “walcott, if you haven’t the wit to 
feed  a  pig  properly,  you’ll  not  live  to  own  many,”  she  says.  now  he  goes  to 
court and claims that from that day to this he cannot keep a pig alive for more 
than four weeks because my martha bewitch them with her books! 
enter ezekiel cheever. a shocked silence. 
cheever: good evening to you, proctor. 
proctor: why, mr. cheever. good evening. 
cheever: good evening, all. good evening, mr. hale. 
proctor: i hope you come not on business of the court. 
 
cheever: i do, proctor, aye. i am clerk of the court. now, y’know. 
 
enter  marshal  herrick,  a  man  in  hi"  early  thirties,  who  is  some-what 
shamefaced at the moment. 
 
giles: it’s a pity, ezekiel, that an honest tailor might have gone to heaven must 
burn in hell. you’ll burn for this, do you know it? 
 
cheever: you know yourself i must do as i’m told. you surely know that, giles. 
and i’d as lief you’d not be sending me to hell. i like not the sound of it, i tell 
you; i like not the sound of it. he fears proctor, but starts to reach inside his 
coat. now believe me, proctor, how heavy be the law, all its tonnage i do carry 
on my back tonight. he takes out a warrant. i have a warrant for your wife. 
 
proctor, to hale: you said she were not charged!

hale: i know nothin’ of it. to cheever: when were she charged? 
 
cheever: i am given sixteen warrant tonight, sir, and she is one. 
 
proctor: who charged her? 
 
cheever: why, abigail williams charge her. 
 
proctor: on what proof, what proof? 
 
cheever, looking about the room: mr. proctor, i have little time. the court bid 
me search your house, but i like not to search a house. so will you hand me any 
poppets that your wife may keep here? 
 
proctor: poppets? 
 
elizabeth: i never kept no poppets, not since i were a girl. 
 
cheever, embarrassed, glancing toward the mantel where sits mary warren’s 
poppet: i spy a poppet, goody proctor. 
 
elizabeth: oh! going for it: why, this is mary’s. 
 
cheever, shyly: would you please to give it to me? 
 
elizabeth,  handing  it  to  him,  asks  hale:  has  the  court  discov-ered  a  text  in 
poppets now? 
 
cheever, carefully holding the poppet: do you keep any others in this house? 
 
procvoa: no, nor this one either till tonight. what signifies a poppet? 
 
cheever:  why,  a  poppet  -  he  gingerly  turns  the  poppet  over  -  a  poppet  may 
signify - now, woman, will you please to come with me? 
 
proctor: she will not! to elizabeth: fetch mary here. 
 
cheever, ineptly reaching toward elizabeth: no, no, i am for-bid to leave her 
from my sight. 

the crucible 

74 
 
proctor, pushing his arm away: you’ll leave her out of sight and out of mind, 
mister. fetch mary, elizabeth. elizabeth goes upstairs. 
 
hale: what signifies a poppet, mr. cheever? 
 
cheever, turning the poppet over in his hands: why, they say it may signify that 
she  -  he  has  lifted  the  poppet’s  skirt,  and  his  eyes  widen  in  astonished  fear. 
why, this, this - 
 
proctor, reaching for the poppet: what’s there? 
 
cheever: why - he draws out a long needle from the poppet - it is a needle! 
herrick, herrick, it is a needle! 
herrick comes toward aim. 
proctor, angrily, bewildered: and what signifies a needle! 
 
cheever, his hands shaking: why, this go hard with her, proc-tor, this - i had 
my doubts, proctor, i had my doubts, but here’s' calamity. to hale, showing the 
needle: you see it, sir, it is a needle! 
 
hale: why? what meanin’ has it? 
 
cheever, wide-eyed, trembling: the girl, the williams girl, abi-gail williams, 
sir. she sat to dinner in reverend parris’s house tonight, and without word nor 
warnin’  she  falls  to  the  floor.  like  a  struck  beast,  he  says,  and  screamed  a 
scream that a bull would weep to hear. and he goes to save her, and, stuck two 
inches in the flesh of her belly, he draw a needle out. and demandin’ of her how 
she come to be so stabbed, she - to proctor now - testify it -were your wife’s 
familiar spirit pushed it in. 
 
proctor:  why,  she  done  it  herself!  to  hale:  i  hope  you’re  not  takin’  this  for 
proof, mister! 
 
hale, struck by the proof, is silent.

cheever: ’tis hard proof! to hale: i find here a poppet goody proctor keeps. i have found it, sir. 
and in the belly of the poppet a needle’s stuck. i tell you true, proctor, i never warranted to see 
such proof of hell, and i bid you obstruct me not, for i - 
 
enter  elizabeth  with  mary  warren.  proctor,  seeing  mary  war-ren,  draws  her  by  the  arm  to 
hale. 
 
proctor: here now! mary, how did this poppet come into my house? 
 
mary warren, frightened for herself, her voice very small: what poppet’s that, sir? 
 
proctor, impatiently, pointing at the doll in cheever’s hand: this poppet, this poppet. 
 
mary warren, evasively, looking at it: why, i - i think it is mine. 
 
proctor: it is your poppet, is it not? 
 
mary warren, not understanding the direction of this: it - is, sir. 
 
proctor: and how did it come into this house? 
 
mary warren, glancing about at the avid faces: why - i made it in the court, sir, and - give it to 
goody proctor tonight. 
 
proctor, to hale: now, sir - do you have it? 
 
hale: mary warren, a needle have been found inside this poppet. 
 
mary warren, bewildered: why, i meant no harm by it, sir. 
 
proctor, quickly: you stuck that needle in yourself? 
 
mary warren: i - i believe i did, sir, i -

proctor: to hale: what say you now? 
 
hale,  watching  mary  warren  closely:  child,  you  are  certain  this  be  your  natural 
memory? may it be, perhaps, that someone conjures you even now to say this? 
 
mary warren: conjures me? why, no, sir, i am entirely my-self, i think. let you ask 
susanna walcott - she saw me sewin’ it in court. or better still: ask abby, abby sat 
beside me when i made it. 
 
proctor, to hale, of cheever: bid him begone. your mind is surely settled now. bid him 
out, mr. hale. 
 
elizabeth: what signifies a needle? 
 
hale: mary - you charge a cold and cruel murder on abigail. 
 
mary warren: murder! i charge no - 
 
hale: abigail were stabbed tonight; a needle were found stuck into her belly - 
 
elizabeth: and she charges me? 
 
hale: aye. 
 
elizabeth, her breath knocked out: why - ! the girl is mur-der! she must be ripped out 
of the world! 
 
cheever,  pointing  at  elizabeth:  you’ve  heard  that,  sir!  ripped  out  of  the  world! 
herrick, you heard it! 
 
proctor, suddenly snatching the warrant out of cheever’s hands: out with you. 
 
cheever: proctor, you dare not touch the warrant.

proctor: if she is innocent! why do you never wonder if parris be innocent, or abigail? is the 
accuser always holy now? were they born this morning as clean as god’s fingers? i’ll tell you 
what’s walking salem - vengeance is walking salem. we are what we always were in salem, but 
now the little crazy children are jangling the keys of the kingdom, and common vengeance writes

herrick:  i  have  nine  men  outside.  you  cannot  keep  her.  the  lair  binds  me,  john,  i 
cannot budge. 
proctor, to hale, ready to break him: will you see her taken? hale: proctor, the court is 
just - 
 
proctor: pontius pilate! god will not let you wash your hands of this! 
 
elizabeth: john - i think i must go with them. he cannot bear to look at her. mary, there 
is bread enough for the morning; you will bake, in the afternoon. help mr. proctor as 
you were his daughter - you owe me that, and much more. she is fighthing her weeping. 
to  proctor:  when  the  children  wake,  speak  noth-ing  of  witchcraft  -  it  will  frighten 
them. she cannot go on. 
proctor: i will bring you home. i will bring you soon. elizabeth: oh, john, bring 
me soon!

proctor: i will fall like an ocean on that court! pear nothing, elizabeth. 
 
elizabeth,  with  great  fear:  i  will  fear  nothing.  she  looks  about  the  room,  as 
though to fix it in her mind. tell the children i have gone to visit someone sick. 
 
.she  walks  out  the  door,  herrick  and  cheever  behind  her.  for  a  moment, 
proctor watches from the doorway. the clank of chain is heard. 
 
proctor:  herrick!  herrick,  don’t  chain  her!  he  rushes  out  the  door.  from 
outside: damn you, man, you will not chain her! off with them! i’ll not have it! 
i will not have her chained! 
 
there  are  other  men's  voices  against  his.  hale,  in  a  fever  of  guilt  and 
uncertainty,  turns  from  the  door  to  avoid  the  sight;  mary  warren  bursts  into 
tears and sits weeping. giles corey calls to hale. 
 
giles:  and  yet  silent,  minister?  it  is  fraud,  you  know  it  is  fraud!  %hat  keeps 
you, man? 
 
proctor is half braced, half pushed into the room by two deputies and herrick. 
 
proctor: i’ll pay you, herrick, i will surely pay you! 
 
herrick, panting: in god’s name, john, i cannot help myself. i must chain them 
all.  now  let  you  keep  inside  this  house  till  1  am  gone!  he  goes  out  with  his 
deputies. 
 
proctor stands there, gulping air. horses and a wagon creak-ing are heard. 
hale, in great uncertainty: mr. proctor - proctor: out of my 
sight! 
 
hale: charity, proctor, charity. what i have heard in her favor, i will not fear to 
testify in court. god help me, i cannot

judge her guilty or innocent - i know not. only this consider: the world goes mad, and it 
profit nothing you should lay the cause to the vengeance of a little girl. 
 
proctor:  you  are  a  coward!  though  you  be  ordained  in  god’s  own  tears,  you  are  a 
coward now! 
 
hale: proctor, i cannot think god be provoked so grandly by such a petty cause. the 
jails are packed - our greatest judges sit in salem now - and hangin’s promised. man, 
we  must  look  to  cause  proportionate.  were  there  murder  done,  perhaps,  and  never 
brought to light? abomination? some secret blasphemy that stinks to heaven? think on 
cause, man, and let you help me to discover it. for there’s your way, believe it, there is 
your  only  way,  when  such  confusion  strikes  upon  the  world.  he  goes  to  giles  and 
francis. let you counsel among yourselves; think on your village and what may have 
drawn from heaven such thundering wrath upon you all. i shall pray god open up our 
eyes. 
 
hale goes out. 
 
francis, struck by hate’s mood: i never heard no murder done in salem. 
 
proctor - he has been reached by hale’s words: leave me, francis, leave me. 
giles, shaken: john - tell me, are we lost? 
proctor: go home now, giles, we’ll speak on it tomorrow. 
giles: let you think on it. we’ll come early, eh? 
proctor: aye. go now, giles. 
giles: good night, then. 
giles corey goes out. after a moment: 
mary warren, in a fearful squeak of n voice: mr. proctor, 

the crucible

very likely they’ll let her come home once they’re given proper evidence. 
 
proctor: you’re coming to the court with me, mary. you will tell it in the court, 
 
mary warren: i cannot charge murder on abigail. 
 
proctor, moving menacingly toward her: you will tell the court how that poppet come 
here and who stuck the needle in. 
 
mary  warren:  she’ll  kill  me  for  sayin’  that!  proctor  continues  toward  her.  abby’ll 
charge lechery on you, mr. proctor! 
 
proctor, halting: she’s told you! 
 
mary warren: i have known it, sir. she’ll ruin you with it, i know she will. 
 
proctor, hesitating, and with deep hatred of himself: good. then her saintliness is done 
with. mary backs from him. we will slide together into our pit; you will tell the court 
what you know. 
 
mary warren, in terror: i cannot, they’ll turn on me - 
 
proctor strides and catches her, and she is repeating, “i cannot, i cannot!” 
 
proctor: my wife will never die for me! i will bring your guts into your mouth but that 
goodness will not die for me! 
 
mary warren, struggling to escape him: i cannot do it, i cannot! 
 
proctor, grasping her by the throat as though he would strangle her: make your peace 
with it! now hell and heaven grapple on our backs, and all our old pretense is ripped 
away  -  make  your  peace!  he  throws  her  to  the  poor,  where  she  sobs,  "i  cannot,  i 
cannot...” and now, half to himself, staring, and

turning to the open door: peace. it is a providence, and no great change; we are only what we 
always were, but naked now. he walks as though toward a great horror, facing the open sky. 

e, naked! and the wind, god’s icy wind, will blow! 
 

and she is over and over again sobbing, “i cannot, i cannot, l cannot,” as 
 

the curtain falls*

the vestry room of the salem meeting house, now serving as the anteroom of 
the general court. 
 
as the curtain rises, the room is empty, but for sunlight pouring through two 
high  windows  in  the  back  wall.  the  room  is  solemn,  even  forbidding.  heavy 
beams jut out, boards of random widths make up the walls. at the right are two 
doors leading into the meeting house proper, where the court is being held. at 
the left another door leads outside. 
 
there is a plain bench at the left, and another at the right. in the center a rather 
long meeting table, with stools and a con-siderable armchair snugged up to it. 
 
through the partitioning wall at the right we hear a prosecutor’s voice, judge 
hathorne’s,  asking  a  question;  then  a  woman’s  voice,  martha  corey’s, 
replying. 
 
hathorne's voice: now, martha corey, there is abundant evidence in our hands 
to show that you have given yourself to the reading of fortunes, do you deny it? 
 
martha corey’s voice: i am innocent to a witch. i know not what a witch 
is. 
 

83

 84 
 
hathorne’s voice: how do you know, then, that you are not a witch? 
 
martha corey’s voice: if i were, i would know it. 
 
hathorne’s voice: why do you hurt these children? 
 
martha corey’s voice: i do not hurt them. i scorn it! 
 
giles’ voice, roaring: i have evidence for the court! 
 
voices of townspeople rise in excitement. 
 
danforth’s voice: you will keep your seat! 
 
giles voice: thomas putnam is reaching out for land! 
 
danforth’s voice: remove that man, marshal! 
 
giles’ voice: you’re hearing lies, lies! 
 
a roaring goes up from the people. 
 
hathorne’s voice: arrest him, excellency! 
 

giles’ voice: i have evidence. why will you not hear my evi-dence? 
 
the door opens and giles is half carried into the vestry room by herrick. 
giles: hands off, damn you, let me go! 
herrick: giles, giles! 
giles: out of my way, herrick! i bring evidence - 
herrick: you cannot go in there, giles; it’s a court! 
enter hale from the court. 
hale: pray be calm a moment. 
giles: you, mr. hale, go in there and demand i speak. 
hale: a moment, sir, a moment.

judge hathorne enters. he is in his sixties, a bitter, remorseless salem judge. 
 
hathorne:  how  do  you  dare  come  roarin’ into  this  court!  are  you  gone  daft, 
corey? 
 
giles: you’re not a boston judge yet, hathorne. you’ll not call me daft! 
 
enter deputy governor danforth and, behind him, ezekiel cheever and parris. 
on his appearance, silence falls. danforth is a grave man in his sixties, of some 
humor and sophistication that does not, however, interfere with an exact loyalty 
to his position and his cause. he comes down to giles, who awaits his wrath. 
 
danforth, looking directly at giles: who is this man? 
 
parris: giles corey, sir, and a more contentious - 
 
giles, to parris: i am asked the question, and i am old enough to answer it! to 
danforth,  who  impresses  him  and  to  whom  he  smiles  through  his  strain:  my 
name  is  corey,  sir,  giles  corey.  i  have  six  hundred  acres,  and  timber  in 
addition. it is my wife you be condemning now. he indicates the courtroom. 
 
danforth: and how do you imagine to help her cause with such contemptuous 
riot? now be gone. your old age alone keeps you out of jail for this. 
 
giles, beginning to plead: they be tellin’ lies about my wife, sir, i - 
 
danforth:  do  you  take  it  upon  yourself  to  determine  what  this  court  shall 
believe and what it shall set aside? 
giles: your excellency, we mean no disrespect for - 
danforth: disrespect indeed! it is disruption, mister. this is

the highest court of the supreme government of this province, do you know it? 
 
giles,  beginning  to  weep:  your  excellency,  i  only  said  she  were  readin’ 
books, sir, and they come and take her out of my house for - 
 
danforth, mystified: books! what books? 
 
giles, through helpless sobs: it is my third wife, sir; i never had no wife that be 
so taken with books, and i thought to find the cause of it, d’y’see, but it were no 
witch  i  blamed  her  for.  he  is  openly  weeping.  i  have  broke  charity  with  the 
woman, i have broke charity with her. he covers his face, ashamed. dan-forth 
is respectfully silent. 
 
hale: excellency, he claims hard evidence for his wife’s de-fense. i think that 
in all justice you must - 
 
danforth:  then  let  him  submit  his  evidence  in  proper  affidavit.  you  are 
certainly aware of our procedure here, mr. hale. to herrick: clear this room. 
 
herrick: come now, giles, he gently pushes corey out. 
 
francis: we are desperate, sir; we come here three days now and cannot be 
heard. 
 
danforth: who is this man? 
 
francis: francis nurse, your excellency. 
 
hale: his wife’s rebecca that were condemned this morning. 
 
danforth:  indeed!  i  am amazed to find you in such uproar; i have only good 
report of your character, mr. nurse. 
 

danforth, to francis: let you write your plea, and in due time i will - 

hathorne: i think they must both be arrested in contempt, sir.

francis: excellency, we have proof for your eyes; god forbid you shut them to it. the 
girls, sir, the girls are frauds. 
 
danforth: what’s that? 
 
francis: we have proof of it, sir. they are all deceiving you. 
 
danforth is shocked, but studying francis. 
 
hathorne: this is contempt, sir, contempt! 
 
danforth: peace, judge hathorne. do you know who i am, mr. nurse? 
 
francis: i surely do, sir, and i think you must be a wise judge to be what you 
are. 
 
danforth:  and  do  you  know  that  near  to  four  hundred  are  in  the  jails  from 
marblehead to lynn, and upon my signature? 
 
francis: i - 
 
danforth: and seventy-two condemned to hang by that signature? 
 
francis: excellency, i never thought to say it to such a weighty judge, but you 
are deceived. 
 
enter giles corey from left. all turn to see as he beckons in mary warren with 
proctor.  mary  is  keeping  her  eyes  to  the  ground;  proctor  has  her  elbow  as 
though she were near collapse. 
 
parris, on seeing her, in shock: mary warren! he goes directly to bend close to 
her face. what are you about here? 
 
proctor,  pressing  parris  away  from  her  with  a  gentle  but  burnt  motion  of 
protectiveness: she would speak with the deputy governor. 
 
danforth, shocked by this, turns to herrick: did you not tell me mary warren 
were sick in bed? 

the crucible 

88 
 
herrick: she were, your honor. when i go to fetch her to the court last week, 
she said she were sick. 
 
giles: she has been strivin’ with her soul all week, your honor; she comes now 
to tell the truth of this to you. 
 
danforth: who is this? 
 
proctor: john proctor, sir. elizabeth proctor is my wife. 
 
parris: beware this man, your excellency, this man is mischief. 
 
hale, excitedly: i think you must hear the girl, sir, she - 
 
danforth, who has become very interested in mary warren and only raises a 
hand toward hale: peace. what would you tell us, mary warren? 
proctor looks at her, but she cannot speak. proctor! she never 
saw no spirits, sir. 
 
danforth, with great alarm and surprise, to mary: never saw no spirits! 
giles, eagerly: never. 
proctor, reaching into his jacket: she has signed a deposition, 
sir - 
 
danforth, instantly: no, no, i accept no depositions. he is rapidly calculating 
this; he turns from her to proctor. tell me, mr. proctor, have you given out this 
story in the village? 
proctor: we have not. 
parris: they’ve come to overthrow the court, sir! this man is - 
 
danforth:  i  pray  you,  mr,  parris.  do  you  know,  mr.  proctor,  that  the  entire 
contention  of  the  state  in  these  trials  is  that  the  voice  of  heaven  is  speaking 
through the children? 
 
proctor: i know that, sir. 

 

 89 

 act three 

 
 
danforth,  thinks,  staring  at  proctor,  then  turns  to  mary  war-ren:  and  you,  mary 
warren, how came you to cry out people for sending their spirits against you? 
 
mary warren: it were pretense, sir. 
 
danforth: i cannot hear you. 
 
proctor: it were pretense, she says. 
 
danforth: ah? and the other girls? susanna walcott, and - the others? they are 
also pretending? 
 
mary warren: aye, sir. 
 
danforth,  wide-eyed:  indeed.  pause.  he  is  baffled  by  this.  he  turns  to  study 
proctor’s face. 
 
parris,  in  a  sweat:  excellency,  you  surely  cannot  think  to  let  so  vile  a  lie  be 
spread in open court! 
 
danforth: indeed not, but it strike hard upon me that she will dare come here 
with such a tale. now, mr. proctor, before i decide whether i shall hear you or 
not,  it  is  my  duty  to  tell  you  this.  we  burn  a  hot  fire  here;  it  melts  down  all 
concealment. 
 
proctor: i know that, sir. 
 
danforth: let me continue. i understand well, a husband’s tenderness may drive 
him to extravagance in defense of a wife. are you certain in your conscience, 
mister, that your evidence is the truth? 
 
proctor: it is. and you will surely know it. 
 
danforth: and you thought to declare this revelation in the open court before 
the public? 
 
proctor: i thought i would, aye - with your permission. 
 
danforth, his eyes narrowing: now, sir, what is your purpose in so doing? 

the crucible 

90 
proctor: why, i - i would free my wife, sir. 
 
danforth: there lurks nowhere in your heart, nor hidden in your spirit, any 
desire to undermine this court? 
 
proctor, with the faintest faltering: why, no, sir. 
 
cheever, clears his throat, awakening: i - your excellency. 
 
danforth: mr. cheever. 
 
cheever: i think it be my duty, sir - kindly, to proctor: you’ll not deny it, john. 
to danforth: when we come to take his wife, he damned the court and ripped 
your warrant. 
 
parris: now you have it! 
 
danforth: he did that, mr. hale? 
 
hale, takes a breath: aye, he did. 
 
proctor: it were a temper, sir. i knew not what i did. 
 
danforth, studying him: mr. proctor. 
 
proctor: aye, sir. 
 
danforth, straight into his eyes: have you ever seen the devil? 
 
proctor: no, sir. 
 
danforth: you are in all respects a gospel christian? 
 
proctor: i am, sir. 
 

parris: such a christian that will not come to church but once in a month! 
 
danforth, restrained - he is curious: not come to church? 
 
proctor: i - i have no love for mr. parris. it is no secret. but god i surely love. 
 
cheever: he plow on sunday, sir. 

 
 

 91

 danforth: plow on sunday! 
 
cheever,  apologetically:  i  think  it  be  evidence,  john.  i  am  an  official  of  the  court,  i 
cannot keep it. 
 
proctor: i - i have once or twice plowed on sunday. i have three children, sir, 
and until last year my land give little. 
 
giles:  you’ll  find  other  christians  that  do  plow  on  sunday  if  the  truth  be 
known. 
 
hale: your honor, i cannot think you may judge the man on such evidence. 
 
danforth: i judge nothing. pause. he keeps watching proctor, who tries to meet 
his gaze. i tell you straight, mister - i have seen marvels in this court. i have 
seen people choked before my eyes by spirits; i have seen them stuck by pins 
and slashed by daggers. i have until this moment not the slightest reason to sus-
pect that the children may be deceiving me. do you 'understand my meaning? 
 
proctor: excellency, does it not strike upon you that so many of these women 
have lived so long with such upright reputation, and - 
parris: do you read the gospel, mr. proctor? proctor: i read 
the gospel. 
 
parris: i think not, or you should surely know that cain were an upright man, 
and yet he did kill abel. 
 
proctor: aye, god tells us that. to danforth: but who tells us rebecca nurse 
murdered seven babies by sending out her spirit on them? it is the children only, 
and this one will swear she lied to you. 
 
danforth considers, then beckons hathorne to him. hathorne leans in, and he 
speaks in his ear. hathorne nods. 

the crucible 

92 
 
hathorne: aye, she’s the one. 
 
danforth: mr. proctor, this morning, your wife send me a claim in which she 
states that she is pregnant now. 
 
proctor: my wife pregnant! 
 
danforth: there be no sign of it - we have examined her body. 
 
proctor:  but  if  she  say  she  is  pregnant,  then  she  must  be!  that  woman  will 
never lie, mr. danforth. 
 
danforth: she will not? 
 
proctor: never, sir, never. 
 
danforth: we have thought it too convenient to be credited. however, if i 
should tell you now that i will let her be kept another month; and if she begin to 
show her natural signs, you shall have her living yet another year until she is 
delivered - what say you to that? john proctor is struck silent. come now. you 
say your only purpose is to save your wife. good, then, she is saved at least this 
year, and a year is long. what say ' you, sir? it is done now. in convict, proctor 
glances at francis and giles. will you drop this charge? 
 
proctor: i - i think i cannot. 
 
danforth,  now  an  almost  imperceptible  hardness  in  his  voice:  then  your 
purpose is somewhat larger. 
 
parris: he’s come to overthrow this court, your honor! 
 
proctor: these are my friends. their wives are also accused - 
 
danforth, with a sudden briskness of manner: i judge you not, sir. i am ready to 
hear your evidence. 
 
proctor: i come not to hurt the court; i only - 
 
danforth, cutting him op: marshal, go into the court and bid

judge stoughton and judge sewall declare recess for one hour. and let them go to the 
tavern, if they will. all witnesses and prisoners are to be kept m the building. 
 
herrick: aye, sir'. very deferentially: if i may say it, sir, i know this man all my 
life. it is a good man, sir. 
 
danforth  - it is the reflection on himself he resents: i am sure of it, marshal. 
herrick  nods,  then  goes  out.  now,  what  deposi-tion  do  you  have  for  us,  mr. 
proctor? and i beg you be clear, open as the sky, and honest. 
 
proctor, as he takes out several papers: i am no lawyer, so i'll - 
 
danforth: the pure in heart need no lawyers. proceed as you will. 
 
proctor, handing danforth a paper: will you read this first, sir? it’s a sort of 
testament. the people signing it declare their good opinion of rebecca, and my 
wife, and martha corey. danforth looks down at the paper. 
 
parris, to enlist danforth’s sarcasm: their good opinion! but danforth goes on 
reading, and proctor is heartened. 
 
proctor: these are all landholding farmers, members of the church. delicately, 
trying to point out a paragraph: if you’ll notice, sir - they’ve known the women 
many years and never saw no sign they had dealings with the devil. 
 

parris nervously moves over and reads over dan forth’s shoulder. 

 

danforth, glancing down a long list: how many names are here? 
 
francis: ninety-one, your excellency. 
 
parris,'sweating: these people should be summoned. danforth looks up at 
him questioningly. for questioning.

francis, trembling with anger: mr. danforth, i gave them all my word no harm 
would come to them for signing this. 
 
parris: this is a clear attack upon the court! 
 
hale, to parris, trying to contain himself: is every defense an attack upon the 
court? can no one - ? 
 
parris:  all  innocent  and  christian  people  are  happy  for  the  courts  in  salem! 
these people are gloomy for it. to danforth directly: and i think you will want 
to know, from each and every one of them, what discontents them with you! 
 
hathorne: i think they ought to be examined, sir. 
 
danforth: it is not necessarily an attack, i think. yet - 
 
francis: these are all covenanted christians, sir. 
 
danforth:  then  i  am  sure  they  may  have  nothing  to  fear. hands cheever the 
paper.  mr.  cheever,  have  warrants  drawn  for  all  of  these  -  arrest  for 
examination. to proctor: now, mister, what other information do you have for 
us? francis is still standing, horrified. you may sit, mr. nurse. 
 
francis: i have brought trouble on these people; i have - 
 
danforth:  no,  old  man,  you  have  not  hurt  these  people  if  they  are  of  good 
conscience. but you must understand, sir, that a person is either with this court 
or he must be counted against it, there be no road between. this is a sharp time, 
now, a pre-cise time - we live no longer in the dusky afternoon when evil mixed 
itself with good and befuddled the world. now, by god’s grace, the shining sun 
is up, and them that fear not light will surely praise it. i hope you will be one of 
those. mary warren suddenly sobs. she’s not hearty, i see. 
 
proctor: no, she’s not, sir. to mary, bending to her, holding her hand, quietly: 
now remember what the angel raphael saint to the boy tobias. remember it.

proctor: “do that which is good, and no harm shall come to thee.”

marshal herrick returns, and takes his post at the door. 
 
giles: john, my deposition, give him mine. 
 
proctor:  aye.  he  hands  danforth  another  paper.  this  is  mr.  corey’s 
deposition. 
 
danforth: oh? he looks down at it. now hathorne comes behind him and reads 
with him. 
 
hathorne, suspiciously: what lawyer drew this, corey? 
 
giles: you know i never hired a lawyer in my life, hathorne. 
 
danforth, finishing the reading: it is very well phrased. my compliments. mr. 
parris, if mr. putnam is in the court, will you bring him in? hathorne takes the 
deposition,  and  walks  to  the  window  with  it.  parris  goes  into  the  court.  you 
have no legal training, mr. corey? 
 
giles, very pleased: i have the best, sir - i am thirty-three time in court in my 
life. and always plaintiff, too. 
 
danforth: oh, then you’re much put-upon. 
 
giles: i am never put-upon; i know my rights, sir, and i will have them. you 
know, your father tried a case of mine - might be thirty-five year ago, i think. 
 
danforth: indeed. 
 
giles: he never spoke to you of it? 
 
danforth: no, i cannot recall it.

giles:  that’s  strange,  he  give  me  nine  pound  damages.  he  were  a  fair  judge,  your 
father. y’see, i had a white mare that tinge, and this fellow come to borrow the mare - 
enter parris with thomas putnam. when he sees putnam, giles’ ease goes; he is hard. 
aye, there he is. 
 
danforth: mr. putnam, i have here an accusation by mr. corey against you. he 
states  that  you  coldly  prompted  your  daughter  to  cry  witchery  upon  george 
jacobs that is now in jail. 
 
putnam: it is a lie. 
 
danforth, turning to giles: mr. putnam states your charge is a lie. what say you 
to that? 
 
giles, furious, his fists clenched: a fart on thomas putnam, that is what i say to 
that! 
 
danforth: what proof do you submit for your charge, sir? 
 
giles: my proof is there! pointing to the paper. if jacobs hangs for a witch he 
forfeit up his property - that’s law! and there is none but putnam with the; coin 
to buy so great a piece. this man is killing his neighbors for their land! 
 
danforth: but proof, sir, proof. 
 
giles, pointing at his deposition: the proof is there! i have it from an honest 
man who heard putnam say it! the day his daughter cried out on jacobs, he said 
she’d given him a fair gift of land. 
 
hathorne: and the name of this man? 
 
giles, taken aback: what name? 
 
hathorne: the man that give you this information. 
 
giles, hesitates, then: why, i - i cannot give you his name. 
 
hathorne: and why not?

 act three 

 
 
giles, hesitates, then bursts out: you know well why not! he’ll lay in jail if i give his 
name! 
 
hathorne: this is contempt of the court, mr. danforth! 
 
danforth, to avoid that: you will surely tell us the name. 
 
giles: i will not give you no name, i mentioned my wife’s name once and i’ll 
burn in hell long enough for that. i stand mute. 
 
danforth: in that case, i have no choice but to arrest you for contempt of this 
court, do you know that? 
 
giles: this is a hearing; you cannot clap me for contempt of a hearing. 
 
danforth: oh, it is a proper lawyer! do you wish me to declare the court in full 
session here? or will you give me good reply? 
 
giles, faltering: i cannot give you no name, sir, i cannot. 
 
danforth: you are a foolish old man. mr. cheever, begin the record. the court 
is now in session. i ask you, mr. corey - 
 
proctor, breaking in: your honor - he has the story in confi-dence, sir, and he - 
 
parris: the devil lives on such confidences! to danforth: without confidences 
there could be no conspiracy, your honor! 
 
hathorne. i think it must be broken, sir. 
 
danforth, to giles: old man, if your informant tells the truth let him come 
here openly like a decent man. but if he hide in anonymity i must know why. 
now  sir,  the government and central church demand of you the name of him 
who reported mr. thomas putnam a common murderer. 
hale: excellency - 
danforth: mr. hale.

 98 
 
hale: we cannot blink it more. there is a prodigious fear of this court in the country - 
 
danforth: then there is a prodigious guilt m the country. are you afraid to be 
questioned here? 
 
hale: i may only fear the lord, sir, bat there is fear in the country nevertheless. 
 
danforth, angered now: reproach me not with the fear in the country; there is 
fear  in  the  country  because  there  is  a  moving  plot  to  topple  christ  in  the 
country! 
 
hale: but it does not follow that everyone accused is part of it. 
 
danforth; no uncorrupted man may fear this court, mr. hale! none! to giles: 
you  are  under  arrest  in  contempt  of  this  court.  now  sit  you  down  and  take 
counsel with yourself, or you will be set in the jail until you decide to answer all 
questions. 
 
giles corey makes a rush for putnam. proctor lunges and holds him. 
 
proctor: no, giles! 
 
giles, over proctor’s shoulder at putnam: i’ll cut your throat, putnam, i’ll kill 
you yet! 
 
proctor,  forcing  him  into  a  chair:  peace,  giles,  peace.  re-leasing  him.  we’ll 
prove ourselves. now we will. he starts to turn to danforth. 
 
giles: say nothin’ more, john. pointing at danforth: he’s only playin’ you! he 
means to hang us all! 
 
mary warren bursts into sobs. 
 
danforth: this is a court of law, mister. i’ll have no effron-tery here! 
 
proctor: forgive him, sir, for his old age. peace, giles, we’ll prove it all now. 
he lifts up mary’s chin. you cannot weep,

mary. remember the angel, what he say to the boy. hold to it, now; there is your rock. 
mary  quiets.  he  takes  out  a  paper,  and  turns  to  danforth.  this  is  mary  warren’s 
deposition. i - i would ask you remember, sir, while you read it, that until two week ago 
she  were  no  different  than  the  other  children  are  today.  he  is  speaking  reasonably, 
restraining all his fears, his anger, his anxiety. you saw her scream, she howled, she 
swore familiar spirits choked her; she even testified that satan, in the form of women 
now in jail, tried to win hex soul away, and then when she refused - 
 
danforth: we know all this. 
 
proctor:  aye,  sir.  she  swears  now  that  she  never  saw  satan;  nor  any  spirit,  vague  or 
clear, that satan may have sent to hurt her. and she declares her friends are lying now. 
 
proctor  starts  to  hand  danforth  the  deposition,  and  hale  comes  up to danforth in a 
trembling state. 
 
hale: excellency, a moment. i think this goes to the heart of the matter. 
 
danforth, with deep misgivings: it surely does. 
 
hale: i cannot say he is an honest man; i know him little. but in all justice, sir, a claim 
so weighty cannot be argued by a farmer. in god’s name, sir, stop here; send him home 
and let him come again with a lawyer - 
 
danforth, patiently: now look you, mr. hale - 
 
hale: excellency, i have signed seventy-two death warrants; i am a minister of the lord, 
and i dare not take a life without there be a proof so immaculate no slightest qualm of 
conscience may doubt it. 
 

danforth: mr. hale, you surely do not doubt my justice. 

hale: i have this morning signed away the soul of rebecca 

the crucible

nurse, your honor. i’ll not conceal it, my hand shakes yet as with a wound! i 
pray you, sir, this argument let lawyers present to you. 
 
danforth: mr. hale, believe me; for a man of such terrible learning you are most 
bewildered - i hope you will forgive me. i have been thirty-two year at the bar, 
sir, and i should be con-founded were i called upon to defend these people. let 
you consider, now - to proctor and the others: and i bid you all do likewise. in 
an ordinary crime, how does one defend the accused? one calls up witnesses to 
prove his innocence. but witchcraft is ipso facto, on its face and by its nature, 
an invisible crime, is it not? therefore, who may possibly be witness to it? the 
witch and the victim. none other. now we cannot hope the witch will accuse 
herself; granted? therefore, we must rely upon her victims - and they do testify, 
the children certainly do testify. as for the witches, none will deny that we are 
most eager for all their confessions. therefore, what is left for a lawyer to bring 
out? i think i have made my point. have i not? 
 
hale: but this child claims the girls are not truthful, and if they are not - 
 
danforth:  that  is  precisely  what  i  am  about to consider, sir. what more may 
you ask of me? unless you doubt my probity? 
 

danforth: and let you put your heart to rest. her deposition, mr. proctor. 
 
proctor  hands  it  to  him.  hathorne  rises,  goes  beside  danforth,  and  starts 
reading. parris comes to his other side. danforth looks at john proctor, then 
proceeds to read. hale gets up, finds position near the judge, reads too. proctor 
glances at giles. francis prays silently, hands pressed together. cheever waits 
placidly,  the  sublime  official,  dutiful.  mary  warren  sobs  once.  john  proctor 
touches her head reassuringly. presently danforth 

hale, defeated: i surely do not, sir. let you consider it, then.

lifts his eyes, stands up, takes out a kerchief and blows his nose. the others stand aside 
as he moves in thought toward the window. 
 
parris, hardly able to contain his anger and fear: i should like to question - 
 
danforth - his first real outburst, in which his contempt for parris is clear: 
mr. parris, i bid you be silent! he stands in silence, looking out the window. 
now, having established that he will set the gait: mr. cheever, will you go into 
the court and bring the children here? cheever gets up and goes out up-stage. 
danforth now turns to mary. mary warren, how came you to this turnabout? 
has mr. proctor threatened you for this deposition? 
 
mary warren: no, sir. 
 
danforth: has he ever threatened you? 
 
mary warren, weaker: no, sir. 
 
danforth, sensing a weakening: has he threatened you?- 
 
mary warren: no, sir. 
 
danforth: then you tell me that you sat in my court, cal-lously lying, when you 
knew that people would hang by your evidence? she does not answer. answer 
me! 
 
mary warken, almost inaudibly: i did, sir. 
 
danforth:  how  were  you  instructed  in  your  life?  do  you  not  know  that  god 
damns all liars? she cannot speak. or is it now that you lie'! 
 
mary warren: no, sir - i am with god now. 
 
danforth: you are with god now. 
 
mary warren: aye, sir. 

 

 the crucible 

 102 
 
danforth, containing himself: i will tell you this - you are either lying now, or you were 
lying in the court, and in either case you have committed perjury and you will go to jail 
for it. you cannot lightly say you lied, mary. do you know that? 
 
mary warren: i cannot lie no more. i am with god, i am with god. 
 
but she breaks into sobs at the thought of it, and the right door opens, and enter 
susanna  walcott,  mercy  lewis,  betty  parris,  and  finally  abigail.  cheever 
comes to danforth. 
 
cheever: ruth putnam’s not in the court, sir, nor the other children. 
 
danforth:  these  will  be  sufficient.  sit  you  down,  children.  silently  they  sit. 
your friend, mary warren, has given us a deposition. in which she swears that 
she never saw familiar spirits, apparitions, nor any manifest of the devil. she 
claims  as  well  that  none  of  you  have  seen  these  things  either.  slight  pause. 
now, children, this is a court of law. the law, based upon the bible, and the 
bible,  writ  by  almighty  god,  forbid  the  practice  of  witchcraft,  and  describe 
death as the penalty thereof. but likewise, children, the law and bible damn all 
bearers of false witness. slight pause. now then. it does not escape me that this 
deposition  may  be  devised  to  blind  us;  it  may  well  be  that  mary  warren  has 
been conquered by satan, who sends her here to distract our sacred purpose. if 
so, her neck will break for it. but if she speak true, i bid you now drop your 
guile and confess your pretense, for a quick confession will go easier with you. 
pause. abigail williams, rise, abigail slowly rises. is there any truth in this? 
 
abigail: no, sir. 
 
danforth, thinks, glances at mary, then back to abigail: chil-dren, a very augur 
bit will now be turned into your souls until

your honesty is proved. will either of you change your positions now, or do you force me to 
hard questioning? 
 
abigail: i have naught to change, sir. she lies. 
 
danforth. to mary: you would still go on with this? 
 
mary warren, faintly: aye, sir. 
 
danforth, turning to abigail: a poppet were discovered in mr. proctor’s house, stabbed 
by a needle. mary warren claims that you sat beside her in the court when she made it, 
and that you saw her make it and witnessed how she herself stuck her needle into it for 
safe-keeping. what say you to that? 
 
abigail, with a slight note of indignation: it is a lie, sir. 
 
danforth, after a slight pause: while you worked for mr. proctor, did you see poppets 
in that house? 
 
abigail: goody proctor always kept poppets. 
 
proctor: your honor, my wife never kept no poppets. mary warren confesses it was 
her poppet. 
cheever: your excellency. danforth: mr. 
cheever. 
 
cheever: when i spoke with goody proctor in that house, she said she never kept no 
poppets. but she said she did keep poppets when she were a girl. 
 
proctor: she has not been a girl these fifteen years, your honor. 
 
hathorne: but a poppet will keep fifteen years, will it not? 
 
proctor: it will keep i¿ it is kept, but mary warren swears she never saw no poppets in 
my house, nor anyone else. 

the crucible 

104 
parris:  why  could  there  not  have  been  poppets  hid  where  no  one  ever  saw 
them? 
 
proctor, furious: there might also be a dragon with five legs in my house, but 
no one has ever seen it. 
 
parris:  we  are  here,  your  honor,  precisely  to  discover  what  no  one  has  ever 
seen. 
 
proctor:  mr.  danforth,  what  profit  this  girl  to  turn  herself  about?  what  may 
mary warren gain but hard questioning and worse? 
 
danforth:  you  are  charging  abigail  williams  with  a  mar-velous  cool  plot  to 
murder, do you understand that? 
 
proctor: i do, sir. i believe she means to murder. 
 
danforth,  pointing  at  abigail,  incredulously:  this  child  would  murder  your 
wife? 
 
proctor: it is not a child. now hear me, sir. in the sight of the congregation she 
were twice this year put out of this meetin’ house for laughter during prayer. 
 
danforth, shocked, turning to abigail: what’s this? laughter during - ! 
 
parris:  excellency,  she  were  under  tituba’s  power  at  that  time,  but  she  is 
solemn now. 
giles: aye, now she is solemn and goes to hang people! danforth: quiet, man. 
 
hathorne:  surely  it  have  no  bearing  on  the  question,  sir.  he  charges 
contemplation of murder. 
 
danforth: aye. he studies abigail for a moment, then: con-tinue, mr. proctor. 
 
proctor: mary. now tell the governor how you danced in the woods.

parris, instantly: excellency, since i come to salem this man is blackening my name. he - 
 
danforth:  in  a  moment,  sir.  to  mary  warren,  sternly,  and  surprised:  what  is  this 
dancing? 
 
mary  warren:  i  -  she  glances  at  abigail,  who  is  staring  down at her remorselessly. 
then, appealing to proctor: mr. proctor - 
 
proctor, taking it right up: abigail leads the girls to the woods, your honor, and they 
have danced there naked - 
 
parris: your honor, this - 
 
proctor, at once: mr. parris discovered them himself in the dead of night! there’s the 
“child” she is! 
 
danforth  -  it  is  growing  into  a  nightmare,  and  he  turns,  as-tonished,  to  parris:  mr. 
parris - 
 
parris: i can only say, sir, that i never found any of them naked, and this man is - 
 
danforth: but you discovered them dancing in the woods? eyes on parris, he points at 
abigail. abigail? 
 
hale: excellency, when i first arrived from beverly, mr. parris told me that. 
danforth: do you deny it, mr. parris? 
parris: i do not, sir, but i never saw any of them naked. 
danforth: but she have danced? 
parris, unwillingly: aye, sir. 
danforth, as though with new eyes, looks at abigail. 
 
hathorne: excellency, will you permit me? he points at mary warren. 
 
danforth, with great worry: pray, proceed.

 106 
 
hathorne: you say you never saw no spirits, mary, were never threatened or afflicted by 
any manifest of the devil or the devil’s agents. 
 
mary warren, very faintly: no, sir. 
 
hathorne, with a gleam of victory: and yet, when people ac-cused of witchery 
confronted you in court, you would faint, saying their spirits came out of their 
bodies and choked you - 
 
mary warren: that were pretense, sir. 
 
danforth: i cannot hear you. 
 
mary warren: pretense, sir. 
 
parris: but you did turn cold, did you not? i myself picked you up many times, 
and your skin were icy, mr. danforth, you - 
 
danforth: i saw that many times. 
 
proctor: she only pretended to faint, your excellency. they’re all marvelous 
pretenders. 
hathorne: then can she pretend to faint now? proctor: now? 
 
parris: why not? now there are no spirits attacking her, for none in this room is 
accused  of  witchcraft.  so  let  her  turn  herself  cold now, let her pretend she is 
attacked now, let her faint. he turns to mary warren. faint! 
 
mary warren: faint? 
 
parris: aye, faint. prove to us how you pretended in the court so many times. 
mary warren, looking to proctor: i - cannot faint now, sir. proctor, alarmed, 
quietly: can you not pretend it?

mary warren: i - she looks about as though searching for the passion to faint. i - have 
no sense of it now, i - 
danforrth: why? what is lacking now?  
 
mary warren: i - cannot tell, sir, i - 
 
danforth: might it be that here we have no afflicting spirit loose, but in the 
court there were some? 
 
mary warren: i never saw no spirits. 
 
parris: then see no spirits now, and prove to us that you can faint by your 
own will, as you claim. 
 
mary warren, stares, searching for the emotion of it, and then shakes her head: 
i - cannot do it. 
 
parris: then you will confess, will you not? it were attacking spirits made you 
faint! 
 
mary warren: no, sir, i - 
 
parris: your excellency, this is a trick to blind the court! 
 
mary warren: it’s not a trick! she stands. i - i used to faint because i - i thought 
i saw spirits. 
 
danforth: thought you saw them! 
 
mary warren: but i did not, your honor. 
 
hathorne: how could you think you saw them unless you saw them? 
 
mary  warren:  i  -  i  cannot  tell  how,  but  i  did.  i  -  i  heard  the  other  girls 
screaming, and you, your honor, you seemed to believe them, and i - it were 
only sport in the beginning, sir, but then the whole world cried spirits, spirits, 
and i - i promise you, mr. danforth, i only thought i saw them but i did not. 
 
danforth peers at her. 

108  the crucible 
 
parris,  smiling,  but  nervous  because  danforth  seems  to  be  struck  by  mary 
warren’s story: surely your excellency is not taken by this simple lie. 
 
danforth, turning worriedly to abigail: abigail. i bid you now search your heart 
and tell me this - and beware of it, child, to god every soul is precious and his 
vengeance is terrible on them that take life without cause. is it possible, child, 
that the spirits you have seen are illusion only, some deception that may cross 
your mind when - 
 
abigail: why, this - this - is a base question, sir. 
 
danforth: child, i would have you consider it - 
 
abigail: i have been hurt, mr. danforth; i have seen my blood runnin’ out! i 
have been near to murdered every day because i done my duty pointing out the 
devil’s  people - and this is my reward? to be mistrusted, denied, questioned 
like a - 
 
danforth, weakening: child, i do not mistrust you - 
 
abigial, in an open threat: let you beware, mr. danforth. think you to be so 
mighty that the power of hell may not turn your wits? beware of it! there is - 
suddenly,  from  an  accusa-tory  attitude,  her  face  turns,  looking  into  the  air 
above - it is truly frightened. 
 
danforth, apprehensively: what is it, child? 
 
abigail, looking about in the air, clasping her arms about her as though cold: i 
- i know not. a wind, a cold wind, has come. her eyes fall on mary warren. 
 
mary warren, terrified, pleading: abby! 
 
mercy lewis, shivering: your honor, i freeze! 
 
proctor: they’re pretending!

hathorne, touching abigail’s hand: she is cold, your honor, touch her! 
 
mercy lewis, through chattering teeth: mary, do you send this shadow on me? 
 
mary warren: lord, save me! 
 
susanna walcott: i freeze, i freeze! 
 
abigail, shivering visibly: it is a wind, a wind! 
 
mary warren: abby, don’t do that! 
 
danforth, himself engaged and entered by abigail: mary warren, do you witch 
her? i say to you, do you send your spirit out? 
 
with a hysterical cry mary warren starts to run. proctor catches her. 
 
mary warren, almost collapsing: let me go, mr. proctor, i cannot, i cannot - 
 
abigail, crying to heaven: oh, heavenly father, take away this shadow! 
 
without warning or hesitation, proctor leaps at abigail and, grabbing her by 
the hair, pulls her to her feet. she screams in pain. danforth, astonished, cries, 
“what are you about?” and hathorne and parris call, “take your hands op 
her!” and out of it all comes proctor’s roaring voice. 
proctor: how do you call heaven! whore! whore! 
herrick breaks proctor from her. 
herrick: john! 
danforth: man! man, what do you - 

110  the crucible 
proctor, breathless and in agony: it is a whore! danforth, dumfounded: 
you charge - ? abigail: mr. danforth, he is lying! 
 
proctor: mark her! now she’ll suck a scream to stab me with, but - 
 
danforth: you will prove this! this will not pass! 
 
proctor, trembling, his life collapsing about him: i have known her, sir. i have 
known her. 
 
danforth: you - you are a lecher? 
 
francis, horrified: john, you cannot say such a - 
 
proctor:  oh,  francis,  i  wish  you  had  some  evil  in  you  that  you  might  know  me!  to 
danforth: a man will not cast away his good name. you surely know that. 
 
danforth, dumfounded: in - in what time? in what place? 
 
proctor, his voice about to break, and his shame great: in the proper place - where my 
beasts  are  bedded.  on  the  last  night  of  my  joy,  some  eight  months  past.  she  used  to 
serve me in my house, sir. he has to clamp his jaw to keep from weeping. a man may 
think god sleeps, but god sees everything, i know it now. i beg you, sir, i beg you - see 
her what she is. my wife, my dear good wife, took this girl soon after, sir, and put her 
out  on  the  highroad.  and  being  what  she  is,  a  lump  of  vanity,  sir  -  he  is  being 
overcome. excellency, forgive me, forgive me. an-grily against himself, he turns away 
from the governor for a moment. then, as though to cry out is his only means of speech 
left: she thinks to dance with me on my wife’s grave! and well she might, for i thought 
of her softly. god help me, t lusted, and there is a promise in such sweat. but it is a 
whore’s venge-ance, and you must see it; i set myself entirely in your hands, i know you 
must see it now.

danforth, blanched, in horror, turning to abigail: you deny every scrap and tittle of 
this? 
 
aalu.: if i must answer that, i will leave and i will not come back again! 
 
danforth seems unsteady. 
 
proctor:  l  have  made  a  bell  of  my  honor!  i  have  rung  the  doom  of  my  good 
name  -  you  will  believe  me,  mr.  danforth!  my  wife  is  innocent,  except  she 
knew a whore when she saw one! 
 
abigail, stepping up to danforth: what look do you give me? danforth cannot 
speak. i’ll not have such looks! she turns and starts for the door. 
 
danforth:  you  will  remain  where  you  are!  herrick  steps  into  her  path.  she 
comes  up  short,  fire  in  her  eyes.  mr.  parris,  go  into  the  court  and  bring 
goodwife proctor out. 
 
parris, objecting: your honor, this is all a - 
 
danforth, sharply to parris: bring her out! and tell her not one word of what’s 
been spoken here. and let you knock before you enter. parris goes out. now we 
shall  touch  the  bottom  of  this  swamp.  to  proctor:  your  wife,  you  say,  is  an 
honest woman. 
 
proctor: in her life, sir, she have never lied. there are them that cannot sing, and 
them that cannot weep - my wife cannot lie. i have paid much to learn it, sir. 
 
danforth: and when she put this girl out of your house, she put her out for a 
harlot? 
 
proctor: aye, sir. 
 
danforth: and knew her for a harlot? 
 
proctor: aye, sir, she knew her for a harlot. 
 
danforth: good then. to abigail: and if she tell me, child,

it were for harlotry, may god spread his mercy on you! there is a knock. he calls to the 
door. hold! to abigail: turn your back. turn your back. to proctor: do likewise. both 
turn their backs - abigail with indignant slowness. now let neither of you turn to face 
goody proctor. no one in this room is to speak one word, or raise a gesture aye or nay. 
he turns toward the door, calls: enter! the door opens. elizabeth enters with parris. 
parris leaves her. she stands alone, her eyes looking for proctor. mr. cheever, report 
this testimony in all exactness. are you ready? 
 
cheever: ready, sir. 
 
danforth:  come  here,  woman.  elizabeth  comes  to  him,  glanc-ing  at  proctor's  back. 
look at me only, not at your husband. in my eyes only. 
 
elizabeth, faintly: good, sir. 
 
danforth: we are given to understand that at one time you dismissed your servant, 
abigail williams. 
 
elizabeth: that is true, sir. 
 
danforth:  for  what  cause  did  you  dismiss  her?  slight  pause.  then  elizabeth  tries  to 
glance at proctor. you will look in my eyes only and not at your husband. the answer 
is in your memory and you need no help to give it to me. why did you dismiss abigail 
williams? 
 
elizabeth, not knowing what to say, sensing a situation, wetting her lips to stall for time: 
she - dissatisfied me. pause. and my husband. 
 
danforth: in what way dissatisfied you? 
 
elizabeth: she were - she glances at proctor for a cue. 
 
danforth: woman, look at me! elizabeth does. were she slovenly? lazy? what 
disturbance did she cause?

elizabeth: your honor, i - in that time i were sick. and i - my husband is a good and 
righteous man. he is never drunk as some are, nor wastin’ his time at the shovelboard, 
but always at his work. but in my sickness - you see, sir, i were a long time sick after 
my last baby, and i thought i saw my husband somewhat turning from me. and this girl 
- she turns to abigail. 
 
danforth: look at me. 
 
elizabeth: aye, sir. abigail williams - she breaks op. 
 
danforth: what of abigail williams? 
 
elizabeth: i came to think he fancied her. and so one night i lost my wits, i think, and 
put her out on the highroad. 
 
danforth: your husband - did he indeed turn from you? 
 
elizabeth, in agony: my husband - is a goodly man, sir. 
 
danforth: then he did not turn from you. 
 
elizabeth, starting to glance at proctor: he - 
 
danforth, reaches out and holds her face, then: look at me! to your own knowledge, 
has  john  proctor  ever  committed  the  crime  of  lechery?  1n  a  crisis  of  indecision  she 
cannot speak, answer my question! is your husband a lecher! 
 
elizabeth, faintly: no, sir. 
 
danforth: remove her, marshal. 
 
proctor: elizabeth, tell the truth! 
 
danforth: she has spoken. remove her! 
 
proctor, crying out: elizabeth, i have confessed it! 
 
elizabeth: oh, god! the door closes behind her. 
 
proctor: she only thought to save my name!

condemned! l may shut my conscience to it no more - private vengeance is working 
through this testimony! from the beginning this man has struck me true. by my oath to 
heaven, i believe him now, and i pray you call back his wife before we -

hale: i believe him! pointing at abigail: this girl has always struck me false! she has - 
 
abigail, with a weird, wild, chilling cry, screams up to the ceiling. 
 
abigail: you will not! begone! begone, i say! 
 
danforth:  what  is  it,  child?  but  abigail,  pointing  with  fear,  is  now  raising  up  her 
frightened eyes, her awed face, toward the ceiling - the girls are doing the same - and 
now  hathorne,  hale,  putnam,  cheever,  herrick,  and  danforth  do  the  same.  what’s 
there?  he  lowers  his  eyes  from  the  ceiling,  and  now  he  is  fright-ened;  there  is  real 
tension  in  his  voice.  child!  she  is  transfixed  -  with  all  the  girls,  she  is  whimpering 
open-mouthed, agape at the ceiling. girls! why do you - ?

abigail, to the ceiling, in a genuine conversation with the “bird,.” as though trying to 
talk it out of attacking her: but god made my face; you cannot want to tear my face. 
envy is a deadly sin, mary. 
 
mary warren, on her feet with a spring, and horrified, plead-ing: abby! 
 
abigail, unperturbed, continuing to the “bird”: oh, mary, this is a black art to 
change your shape. no, i cannot, i cannot stop my mouth; it’s god’s work i do. 
 
mary warren: abby, i’m here! 
 
proctor, frantically: they’re pretending, mr. danforth! 
 
abigail - now she takes a backward step, as though in fear the bird will swoop 
down momentarily: oh, please, mary! don’t come down. 
 
susanna walcott: her claws, she’s stretching her claws! 
 
proctor: lies, lies. 
 
abigail, backing further, eyes still fixed above: mary, please don’t hurt me!

danforth, to mary warren: why does she see this vision? 
 
mary warren: she sees nothin’!

tone of mary warren’s cry: she sees nothin’!

mary warren, screaming it out at the top of her lungs, and raising her fists:

mary  warren,  utterly  confounded,  and  becoming  overwhelmed  by  abigail’s  - 
and the girls’ - utter conviction, starts to whimper, hands half raised, powerless, 
and all the girls begin whimpering exactly as she does.

where did you find this power?

compact with lucifer, have you not? 
 
proctor: god damns liars, mary! 
 
mary utters something unintelligible, staring at abigail, who keeps watching the 
“bird” above. 
 
danforth: i cannot hear you. what do you say? mary utters again unintelligibly 
you will confess yourself or you will hang! he turns her roughly to face him. 
do you know who i am? i say you will hang if you do not open with me!

she and all the girls run to one wall, shielding their eyes. and now, as though cornered, 
they  let  out  a  gigantic  scream,  and  mary,  as  though  infected,  opens  her  mouth  and 
screams  with  them.  gradually  abigail  and  the  girls  leave  op,  until  only  mary  is  left 
there, staring up at the “bird,” screaming madly. all watch her, horrified by this evident 
fit. proctor strides to her. 
 
proctor: mary, tell the governor what they - he has hardly got a word out, when, seeing 
him coming for her, she rushes out of his reach, screaming in horror, 
 
mary warren: don’t touch me - don’t touch me! at which the girls halt at the door. 
 
proctor, astonished: mary! 
 
mary warren, pointing at proctor: you’re the devil’s man! 
 
he is stopped in his tracks.

to sign, to sign, to -

mary warren, hysterically, pointing at proctor, fearful of him: my name, he want my name. “i’ll 
murder you,” he says, “if my wife hangs! we must go and overthrow the court,” he says! 
 
danforth’s head jerks toward proctor, shock and horror in his face. 
 
proctor, turning, appealing to hale: mr. hale! 
 
mary warren, her sobs beginning: he wake me every night, his eyes were like coals 
and his fingers claw my neck, and i sign, i sign... 
hale: excellency, this child’s gone wild! 
proctor, as danforth’s wide eyes pour on him: mary, mary! 
 
mary warren, screaming at him: no, i love god; i go your way no more. i love god, i 
bless god. sobbing, she rushes to abigail. abby, abby, i’ll never hurt you more! they 
all  watch,  as  abigail,  out  of  her  infinite  charity,  reaches  out  and  draws  the  sobbing 
mary to her, and then looks up to danforth. 
 
danforth, to proctor: what are you? proctor is beyond speech in his anger. you are 
combined with anti-christ, are you not? i have seen your power; you will not deny it! 
what say you, mister? 
 
hale: excellency - 
 
danforth:  i  will  have  nothing  from  you,  mr.  hale!  to  proctor:  will  you  confess 
yourself befouled with hell, or do you keep that black allegiance yet? what say you?

the curtain falls

a cell in salem jail, that fall. 
 
at the back is a high barred window; near it, a great, heavy door. along the 
walls are two benches. 
 
the  place  is  in  darkness  but  for  the  moonlight  seeping  through  the  bars.  it 
appears empty. presently footsteps are heard com-ing down a corridor beyond 
the wall, keys rattle, and the door swings open. marshal herrick enters with a 
lantern. 
 
he is nearly drunk, and heavy-footed. he goes to a bench and nudges a bundle 
of rags lying on it. 
 
herrick: sarah,. wake up! sarah good! he then crosses to the other bench. 
 
sarah  good,  rising  in  her  rags:  oh,  majesty!  comin’,  comin’!  tituba,  he’s 
here, his majesty’s come! 
 
herrick.: go to the north cell; this place is' wanted now. he hangs his lantern 
on the wall. tituba sits up. 
 
tituba: that don’t look to me like his majesty; look to me like the marshal. 
 

herrick, taking out a ask: get along with you now, clear this 121

 herrick, grabbing tituba: come along, come along. 
 tituba, resisting him: no, he comin’ for me. i goin' home! 
 
herrick, pulling her to the door: that’s not satan, just a poor old cow with a hatful of 
milk. come along now, out with you! 
 
tituba, calling to the window: take me home, devil! take me home! 
 
sarah  good,  following  the  shouting  tituba  out:  tell  him  i’m  goin’,  tituba! 
now you tell him sarah good is goin’ too! 
 
in the corridor outside tituba calls on - “take me home, devil; devil take me 
home!” and hopkins’ voice orders her to move on. herrick returns and begins 
to push old rags and straw into a corner. hearing footsteps, he turns, and enter 
danforth and judge hathorne. they are in greatcoats and wear hats against 
the bitter cold. they are followed in by cheever, who carries a dispatch case 
and a flat wooden box containing his writing materials. 
herrick good morning, excellency. danforth: where is mr. 
parris? 
herrick: i’ll fetch him. he starts for the door. 
 
danforth: marshal. herrick stops. when did reverend hale arrive? 
herrick: it were toward midnight, i think. 
danforth, suspiciously: %hat is he about here? 
 
herrick: he goes among them that will hang, sir. and he prays with them. he 
sits with goody nurse now. and mr. parris with him. 
 
danforth: indeed. that man have no authority to enter here, marshal. why have 
you let him in? 

the crucible 

124 
herrick: why, mr. parris command me, sir. i cannot deny him. danforth: are 
you drunk, marshal? 
herrick: no, sir; it is a bitter night, and i have no fire here. danforth, containing 
his anger: fetch mr. parris. 
herrick: aye, sir. 
danforth: there is a prodigious stench in this place.  
 
herrick: i have only now cleared the people out for you.  
 
danforth: beware hard drink, marshal. 
 
herrick:  aye,  sir.  he  waits  an  instant  for  further  orders.  but  danforth,  in 
dissatisfaction, turns his back on him, and herrick goes out. there is a pause. 
danforth stands in thought. 
 
hathorne: let you question hale, excellency; i should not be surprised he have 
been preaching in andover lately. 
 
danforth: we’ll come to that; speak nothing of andover. parris prays with him. 
that’s  strange.  he  blows  on  his  hands,  moves  toward  the  window,  and  looks 
out. 
 
hathorne: excellency, i wonder if it be wise to let mr. parris so continuously 
with  the  prisoners.  danforth turns to him, inter-ested. i think, sometimes, the 
man has a mad look these days. 
 
danforth: mad? 
 
hathorne:  i  met  him  yesterday  coming  out  of  his  house,  and  i  bid  him  good 
morning - and he wept and went his way. i think it is not well the village sees 
him so unsteady. 
 
danforth: perhaps he have some sorrow. 
 
cheever, stamping his feet against the cold: i think it be the cows, sir. 
 
danforth: cows? 

act four 

125 
 
cheever: there be so many cows wanderin’ the highroads, now their masters are in the 
jails,  and  much  disagreement  who  they  will  belong  to  now.  i  know  mr.  parris  be 
arguin’  with  farmers  all  yesterday  -  there  is  great  contention,  sir,  about  the  cows. 
contention make him weep, sir; it were always a man that weep for contention. he 
turns,  as  do  hathorne  and  danforth,  hearing  someone  coming  up  the  corridor. 
danforth raises his head as parris enters. he is gaunt, frightened, and sweating in his 
greatcoat. 
 
parris, to danforth, instantly: oh, good morning, sir, thank you 
' for coming, i beg your pardon wakin’ you so early. good morn-ing, judge hathorne. 
 

danforth: reverend hale have no right to enter this - 
 
parris: excellency, a moment. he hurries back and shuts the door. 
 
hathorne: do you leave him alone with the prisoners? 
 
danforth: what’s his business here? 
 
parris,  prayerfully  holding  up  his  hands:  excellency,  hear  me.  it  is  a  providence. 
reverend hale has returned to bring rebecca nurse to god. 
 
danforth, surprised: he bids her confess? 
 
parris, sitting: hear me. rebecca have not given me a word this three month since she 
came. now she sits with him, and her sister and martha corey and two or three others, 
and he pleads with them, confess their crimes and save their lives. 
 
danforth: why - this is indeed a providence. and they soften, they soften? 
 
parris: not yet, not yet. but i thought to summon you, sir, that we might think on 
whether it be not wise, to - he dares not’ 

the crucible 

126 
say it. i had thought to put a question, sir, and i hope you will not - 
danforth: mr. parris, be plain, what troubles you? 
 
parris: there is news, sir, that the court - the court must reckon with. my niece, 
sir, my niece - i believe she has van-ished. 
 
danforth: vanished! 
 
parris: i had thought to advise you of it earlier in the week, but - 
 
danforth: why? how long is she gone? 
 
parris: this be the third night. you see, sir, she told me she would stay a night 
with mercy lewis. and next day, when she does not return, i send to mr. lewis 
to inquire. mercy told him she would sleep in my house for a night. 
 
danforth: they are both gone?! 
 
parris, in fear of him: they are, sir. 
 
danforth, alarmed: i will send a party for them. where may they be? 
 
parris: excellency, i think they be aboard a ship. danforth stands agape. my 
daughter tells me how she heard them speaking of ships last week, and tonight i 
discover  my  -  my  strongbox  is  broke  into.  he  presses  his  fingers  against  his 
eyes to keep back tears. 
 
hathorne, astonished: she have robbed you? 
 
parris: thirty-one pound is gone. i am penniless. he covers his face and sobs. 
 
danforth:  mr.  parris,  you  are  a  brainless  man!  he  walks  in  thought,  deeply 
worried. 

 

 127 

 act four 

 
 
parris: excellency, it profit nothing you should blame me. i cannot think they would run 
off except they fear to keep in salem any more. he is pleading. mark it, sir, abigail had 
close knowledge of the town, and since the news of andover has broken here - ' 
 
danforth:  andover  is  remedied.  the  court  returns  there  on  friday,  and  will 
resume examinations. 
 
parris: i am sure of it, sir. but the rumor here speaks rebellion in andover, and 
it - 
 
danforth: there is no rebellion in andover! 
 
parris: i tell you what is said here, sir. andover have thrown out the court, they 
say, and will have no part of witchcraft. there be a faction here, feeding on that 
news, and i tell you true, sir, i fear there will be riot here. 
 
hathorne: riot! why at every execution i have seen naught but high satisfaction 
in the town. 
 
parris:  judge  hathorne  -  it  were  another  sort  that  hanged  till  now.  rebecca 
nurse is no bridget that lived three year with bishop before she married him. 
john  proctor  is  not  isaac  ward  that  drank  his  family  to  ruin.  to  danforth:  i 
would to god it were not so, excellency, but these people have great weight jet 
in  the  town.  let  rebecca  stand  upon  the  gibbet  and  send  up  some  righteous 
prayer, and i fear she’ll wake a vengeance on 
you. 
 
hathorne: excellency, she is condemned a witch. the court have - 
 
danforth, in deep concern, raising a hand to hathorne: pray you. to parris: 
how do you propose, then? 
parris: excellency, i would postpone these hangin’s for a time. danforth: there 
will be no postponement. 

128  the crucible 
parris: now mr. hale’s returned, there is hope, i think - for if he bring even one 
of these to god, that confession surely damns the others in the public eye, and 
none  may  doubt more that they are all linked to hell. this way, unconfessed 
and claiming innocence, doubts are multiplied, many honest people will weep 
for them, and our good purpose is lost in their tears. 
 
danforth, after thinking a moment, then going to cheever: give me the list. 
 
cheever opens the dispatch case, searches. 
 
parris:  it  cannot  be  forgot,  sir,  that  when  i  summoned  the  con-gregation  for 
john proctor’s excommnnication there were hardly thirty people come to hear 
it. that speak a discontent, i think, and - 
 
danforth, studying the list: there will be no postponement.  
parris: excellency - 
 
danforth: now, sir - which of these in your opinion may be brought to god? i 
will myself strive with him till dawn. he hands she list to parris, who merely 
glances at it. 
 
parris: there is not sufficient time till dawn. 
 
danforth: i shall do my utmost. which of them do you have hope for? 
 
parris,  not  even  glancing  at  the  list  now,  and  in  a  quavering  voice,  quietly: 
excellency - a dagger - he chokes up. 
 
danforth: what do you say? 
 
parris: tonight, when i open my door to leave my house - a dagger clattered to 
the ground. silence. danforth absorbs this. now parris cries out: you cannot 
hang this sort. there is danger for me. i dare not step outside at night! 
 
reverend hale enters. they look at.him for an instant in silence- 

 

 129 

 act four 

 
 
he is steeped in sorrow, exhausted, and more direct than he ever was. 
 
danforth: accept my congratulations, reverend hale; we are gladdened to see 
you returned to your good work. 
 
hale, coming to danforth now: you must pardon them. they will not budge. 
 
herrick enters, waits. 
 
danforth,  conciliatory:  you  misunderstand,  sir;  i  cannot  par-don  these  when 
twelve are already hanged for the same crime. it is not just. 
 
parris, with failing heart: rebecca will not confess? 
 
har.e: the sun will rise in a few minutes. excellency, i must have more time. 
 
danforth: now hear me, and beguile yourselves no more. i will not receive a 
single plea for pardon or postponement. them that will not confess will hang. 
twelve are already executed; the names of these seven are given out, and the 
village expects to see them die this morning. postponement now speaks a floun-
dering on my part; reprieve or pardon must cast doubt upon the guilt of them 
that  died  till  now.  while  i  speak  god’s  law,  i  will  not  crack  its  voice  with 
whimpering. if retaliation is your fear, know this - i should hang ten thousand 
that dared to rise against the law, and an ocean of salt tears could not melt the 
resolution of the statutes. now draw yourselves up like men and help me, as you 
are bound by heaven to do. have you spoken with them all, mr. hale? 
hale: all but proctor. he is in the dungeon. 
danforth, to herrick: what’s proctor’s way now? 
 
herrick: he sits like some great bird; you’d not know he lived except he will 
take food from time to time. 

130  the crucible 
 
danforth, after thinking a moment: his wife - his wife must be well on with child now. 
 
herrick: she is, sir. 
 
danforth: what think you, mr. parris? you have closer knowledge of this man; might 
her presence soften him? 
 
parris:  it  is  possible,  sir.  he  have  not  laid  eyes  on  her  these  three  months.  i  should 
summon her, 
 
' danforth, to herrick: is he yet adamant? has he struck at you again? 
 

herrick: he cannot, sir, he is chained to the wall now. 
 
danforth, after thinking on it: fetch goody proctor to me. then let you bring him up. 
 
herrick: aye, sir. herrick goes. there is silence. 
 
hale: excellency, if you postpone a week and publish to the town that you are striving 
for their confessions, that speak mercy on your part, not faltering. 
 
danforth: mr. hale, as god have not empowered me like joshua to stop this sun from 
rising, so i cannot withhold from them the perfection of their punishment. 
 
hale, harder now: if you think god wills you to raise rebellion, mr. danforth, you are 
mistaken! 
 
danforth, instantly: you have heard rebellion spoken in the town? 
 
hale: excellency, there are orphans wandering from house to house; abandoned cattle 
bellow  on  the  highroads,  the  stink  of  rotting  crops  hangs  everywhere,  and  no  man 
knows when the harlots’ cry will end his life - and you wonder yet if rebellion’s spoke? 
better you should marvel how they do not burn your province!

danforth: mr. hale, have you preached in andover this month? 
hale: thank god they have no need of me in andover. 
danforth; you baffle me, sir. why have you returned here? 
 
hale: why, it is all simple. i come to do the devil’s work. i come to counsel 
christians they should belie themselves. his sarcasm collapses. there is blood 
on my head! can you not see the blood on my head!! 
 
parris: hush! for he has heard footsteps. they all face the door. herrick enters 
with  elizabeth.  her  wrists  are  linked  by  heavy  chain,  which  herrick  now 
removes. her clothes are dirty; her face is pale and gaunt. herrick goes out. 
 
danforth, very politely: goody proctor. she is silent. i hope you are hearty? 
 
elizabeth, as a warning reminder: i am yet six month before my time. 
 
danforth: pray be at your ease, we come not for your life. we - uncertain how 
to  plead,  for  he  is  not  accustomed  to  it.  mr.  hale,  will  you  speak  with  the 
woman? 
 
hale: goody proctor, your husband is marked to hang this morning, 
pause. 
elizabeth, quietly: i have heard it. 
 
hale:  you  know,  do  you  not,  that  i  have  no  connection  with  the  court?  she 
seems  to  doubt  it.  i  come  of  my  own,  goody  proctor.  i  would  save  your 
husband’s life, for if he is taken i count myself hi: murderer. do you understand 
me? 
 
elizabeth: what do you want of me? 

 

 the crucible

hale: goody proctor, i have gone this three month like our lord into the wilderness. i 
have sought a christian way, for damnation’s doubled on a minister who counsels men 
to lie. 
 
hathorne: it is no lie, you cannot speak of lies. 
 
hale: it is a lie! they are innocent! 
 
danforth: i’ll hear no more of that! 
 
hale, continuing to elizabeth: let you not mistake your duty as i mistook my 
own. i came into this village like a bridegroom to his beloved, bearing gifts of 
high religion; the very crowns of holy law i brought, and what i touched with 
my  bright  confi-dence,  it  died;  and  where  i  turned  the  eye  of  my  great  faith, 
blood flowed up. beware, goody proctor - cleave to no faith when faith brings 
blood. it is mistaken law that leads you to sacrifice. life, woman, life is god’s 
most precious gift; no principle, however glorious, may justify the taking of it. i 
beg you, woman, prevail upon your husband to confess. let him give his lie. 
quail not before god’s judgment in this, for it may well be god damns a liar 
less  than  he  that  throws  his  life  away  for  pride.  will  you  plead  with  him?  i 
cannot think he will listen to another. 
 
elizabeth, quietly: i think that be the devil’s argument. 
 
hale, with a climactic desperation: woman, before the laws of god we are as 
swine! we cannot read his will! 
 
elizabeth: l cannot dispute with you, sir; i lack learning for it. 
 
danforth,  going  to  her:  goody  proctor,  you  are  not  sum-moned  here  for 
disputation.  be  there  no  wifely  tenderness  within  you?  he  will  die  with  the 
sunrise. your husband. do you under-stand it? she only looks at him. what say 
you? will you contend with him? she is silent. are you stone? i tell you true, 
woman, had i no other proof of your unnatural life, your dry eyes now would be 
sufficient evidence that you delivered up your soul to

hell! a very ape would weep at such calamity! have the devil dried up any tear of pity 
in you? she is silent. take her out. it profit nothing she should speak to him! 
 
elizabeth, quietly: let me speak with him, excellency. 
 
parris, with hope: you’ll strive with him? she hesitates. 
 
danforth: will you plead for his confession or will you not? 
 
elizabeth: i promise nothing. let me speak with him. 
 
a sound - the sibilance of dragging feet on stone. they turn. a pause. herrick 
enters with john proctor. his wrists are chained. he is another man, bearded, 
filthy, his eyes misty as though webs had overgrown them. he halts inside the 
doorway, his eye caught by the sight of elizabeth. the emotion flowing between 
them prevents anyone from speaking for an instant. wow hale, visibly affected, 
goes to danforth and speaks quietly.  
hale: pray, leave them, excellency. 
 
danforth, pressing rale impatiently aside: mr. proctor, you have been notified, 
have  you  not?  proctor  is  silent,  staring  at  elizabeth.  i  see  light  in  the  sky, 
mister; let you counsel with your wife, and may god help you turn your back 
on hell. proctor is silent, staring at elizabeth. 
 
hale, quietly: excellency, let - 
 
danforth brushes past hale and walks out. hale follows. cheever stands and 
follows, hathorne behind. herrick goes. parris, from a safe distance, ayers: 
 
parris: if you desire a cup of cider, mr. proctor, i am sure i - proctor turns an 
icy stare at him, and he breaks op. parris raises his palms toward proctor. god 
lead you now. parris goes 
 
alone.  proctor  walks  to  her,  halts.  it  is  as  though  they  stood  m  a  spinning 
world. it is beyond sorrow, above i,". he reaches out 

 

 the crucible 

 134 
 
his  hand  as  though  toward  an  embodiment  not  quite  real,  and  as  he  touches  her,  a 
strange soft sound, half laughter, half amazement, comes from his throat. he pats her 
hand. she covers his hand with hers. and then, weak, he sits. then she sits, facing him. 
 
proctor: the child? 
 
elizabeth: it slows. 
 
proctor: there is no word of the boys? 
 
elizabeth: they’re well. rebecca’s samuel keeps them. 
 
proctor: you have not seen them? 
 
elizabeth: i have not. she catches a weakening in herself and downs it. 
 
proctor: you are a - marvel, elizabeth. 
 
elizabeth: you - have been tortured? 
 
proctor: aye. pause. she will not let herself be drowned in the sea that 
threatens her. they come for my life now. 
 
elizabeth: i know it. 
 
pause. 
 
proctor: none - have yet confessed? 
 
elizabeth: there be many confessed. 
 
proctor: who are they? 
 
elizabeth: there be a hundred or more, they say. goody ballard is one; isaiah 
goodkind is one. there be many. 
 
proctor: rebecca? 
 
elizabeth: not rebecca. she is one foot in heaven now; naught may hurt her 
more.

 proctor: and giles? 
 elizabeth: .you have not heard of it? 
 proctor: i hear nothin’, where i am kept. 
 elizabeth: giles is dead. 
 he looks at her incredulously. 
 proctor: when were he hanged? 
 
elizabeth, quietly, factually: he were not hanged. he would not answer aye or nay to 
his indictment; for if he denied the charge they’d hang him surely, and auction out his 
property. so he stand mute, and died christian under the law. and so his sons will have 
his farm. it is the law, for he could not be con-demned a wizard without he answer the 
indictment, aye or nay. 
 
proctor: then how does he die? 
 
elizabeth, gently: they press him, john. 
 
proctor: press? 
 
elizabeth: great stones they lay upon his chest until he plead aye or nay. with a 
tender  smile  for  the  old  man:  they  say  he  give  them  but  two  words.  “more 
weight,” he says. and died. 
 
proctor, numbed - a thread to weave into his agony: “more weight,” 
 
elizabeth: aye. it were a fearsome man, giles corey. 
 
pause. 
 
proctor,  with  great  force  of  will,  but  not  quite  looking  at  her:  i  have  been 
thinking i would confess to them, elizabeth. she shows nothing. what say you? 
if i give them that? 
 
elizabeth: i cannot judge you, john. 
 
pause. 

 

 the crucible 

 136 
 
proctor, simply - a pure question: what would you have me do? 
 
elizabeth: as you will, i would have it. slight pause: i want you living, john. 
that’s sure. 
 
proctor, pauses, then with a flailing of hope: giles’ wife? have she confessed? 
 
elizabeth: she will not. 
 
pause. 
 
proctor: it is a pretense, elizabeth. 
 
elizabeth: what is? 
 
proctor: i cannot mount the gibbet like a saint. it is a fraud. .' am not that man. 
she  is  silent.  my  honesty  is  broke,  elizabeth;  i  am  no  good  man.  nothing’s 
spoiled by giving them this lie that were not rotten long before. 
 
elizabeth: and yet you’ve not confessed till now. that speak goodness in you. 
 
proctor: spite only keeps me silent. it is hard to give a lie to dogs. pause, for the 
first time he turns directly to her. i would have your forgiveness, elizabeth, 
 
elizabeth: it is not for me to give, john, i am - 
 
proctor: i’d have you see some honesty in it. let them, that never lied die now 
to keep their souls. it is pretense for me, a vanity that will not blind god nor 
keep my children out of the wind. pause. what say you? 
 
elizabeth, upon a heaving sob that always threatens: john, it come to naught 
that i should forgive you, if you’ll not forgive yourself. now he turns away a 
little, in great agony. it is not my soul, john, it is yours. he stands, as though in 
physical pain, slowly rising to his feet with a great immortal longing to find his 

act four 137 answer. it is difficult to say,.and she is on the verge of tears. only 
be sure of this, for i know it now: whatever you will do, it is a good man does 
it. he turns his doubting, searching gaze upon her. i have read my heart this 
three month, john. pause. i have sins of my own to count. it needs a cold wife 
to prompt lechery. 
 

proctor, in great pain: enough, enough - 
 
elizabeth, now pouring out her heart; better you should know me! 
 
proctor: i will not hear it! i know you! 
 
elizabeth: you take my sins upon you, john - 
 
proctor, in agony: no, i take my own, my own! 
 
elizabeth:  john,  i  counted  myself  so  plain,  so  poorly  made,  no  honest  love 
could come to me! suspicion kissed you when i did; i never knew how i should 
say my love. it were a cold house i kept! in fright, she swerves, as hathorne 
enters. 
 
hathorne: what say you, proctor? the sun is soon up. 
 
proctor,  his  chest  heaving,  stares,  turns  to  elizabeth.  she  comes  to  him  as 
though to plead, her voice quaking. 
 
elizabeth: do what you will. but let none be your judge. there be no higher 
judge  under  heaven  than  proctor  is!  forgive  me,  forgive  me,  john  -  i  never 
knew such goodness in the world! she covers her face, weeping. 
 
proctor turns from her to hathorne; he is op the earth, his voice hollow. 
 
proctor: i want my life. 
 
hathorne, electrified, surprised: you’ll confess yourself? 
 
proctor: i will have my life. 
 
hathorne, with a mystical tone: god be praised! it is a provi-

dence! he rushes out the door, and his voice is heard calling dawn the corridor: he 
will confess! proctor will confess! 
 
proctor, with a cry, as he strides to the door: why do you cry it? in great pain he turns 
back to her. it is evil, is it not? it is evil. 
 
elizabeth, in terror, weeping: i cannot judge you, john, i cannot! 
 
proctor: then who will judge me? suddenly clasping his hands: god in heaven, what is 
john proctor, what is john proctor? he moves as an animal, and a fury is riding in him, 
a tantalized search. i think it is honest, i think so; i am no saint. as though she had 
denied this he calls angrily at her: let rebecca go like a saint; for me it is fraud! 
 
voices are heard in the hall, speaking together in suppressed excitement. 
 
elizabeth: i am not your judge, i cannot be. as though giving him release: do as you 
will, do as you will! 
 
proctor: would you give them such a lie? say it. would you ever give them this? she 
cannot answer. you would not; if tongs of fire were singeing you you would not! it is 
evil. good, then - it is evil, and i do it! 
 
hathorne  enters  with  danforth,  and,  with  them,  cheever,  parris,  and  hale.  it  is  a 
businesslike, rapid entrance, as though the ice had been broken. 
 
danforth, with great relief and gratitude: praise to god, man, praise to god; you shall 
be  blessed  in  heaven  for  this.  cheever  has  hurried  to  the  bench  with  pen,  ink,  and 
paper. proctor watches him. now then, let us have it. are you ready, mr. cheever? 
 
proctor, with a cold, cold horror at their efficiency: why must it be written? 

 

 139 

 act four 

 
 
danforth: why, for the good instruction of the village, mister; this we shall post upon 
the church door! to parris, urgently: where is the marshal? 
 
parris, runs to the door and calls down the corridor: marshal! hurry! 
 
danforth: now, then, mister, will you speak slowly, and directly to the point, 
for mr. cheever’s sake. he is on record now, and is really dictating to cheever, 
who writes. mr. proctor, have you seen the devil in your life? proctor’s jaws 
lock.  come,  man,  there  is  light  in  the  sky;  the  town  waits  at  the  scaffold;  i 
would give out this news. did you see the devil? 
 
proctor: i did. 
 
parris: praise god! 
 
danforth: and when he come to you, what were his demand? proctor is silent. 
danforth helps. did he bid you to do his work upon the earth? 
 
proctor: he did. 
 
danforth: and you bound yourself to his service? danforth turns, as rebecca 
nurse enters, with herrick helping to sup-port her. she is barely able to walk. 
come in, come in, woman! rebecca, brightening as she sees proctor: ah, john! 
you are well, then, eh? 
 
proctor turns his face to the wall. 
 
danforth: courage, man, courage - let her witness your good example that 
she may come to god herself. now hear it, goody nurse! say on, mr, proctor. 
did you bind yourself to the devil’s service? 
 
rebecca, astonished: why, john! 
 
proctor, through his teeth, his face turned from rebecca: i did. 

the crucible 

140 
 
danforth:  now,  woman,  you  surely  see  it  profit  nothin’  to  keep  this  conspiracy  any 
further. will you confess yourself with him? 
rebecca: oh, john - god send his mercy on you! 
danforth: i say, will you confess yourself, goody nurse? 
 
rebecca: why, it is a lie, it is a lie; how may i damn myself? i cannot, i cannot. 
 
danforth: mr. proctor. when the devil came to you did you see rebecca nurse in his 
company? proctor is silent. come, man, take courage - did you ever see her with the 
devil? 
 
proctor, almost inaudibly: no. 
 
daiforth, now sensing trouble, glances at john and goes to the table, and picks up a 
sheet - the list of condemned. 
 
danforth: did you ever see her sister, mary easty, with the devil? 
 
proctor: no, i did not. 
 
danforth, his eyes narrow on proctor: did you ever see martha corey with the devil? 
 
proctor: i did not. 
 
danforth, realizing, slowly putting the sheet down: did you ever see anyone with the 
devil? 
 
proctor: i did not. 
 
danforth: proctor, you mistake me. i am not empowered to trade your life for a lie. you 
have most certainly seen some person with the devil. proctor is silent. mr. proctor, a 
score of people have already testified they saw this woman with the devil. 
 
proctor: then it is proved. why must i say it? 

 

 141 

 act four 

 
 
danforth: why “must” you say it! why, you should rejoice to say it if your soul is truly 
purged of any love for hell! 
 
proctor: they think to go like saints. i like not to spoil their names. 
 
danforth, inquiring, incredulous: mr. proctor, do you think they go like saints? 
 
proctor, evading: this woman never thought she done the devil’s work. 
 
danforth: look you, sir. i think you mistake your duty here. it matters nothing 
what she thought - she is convicted of the unnatural murder of children, and you 
for sending your spirit out upon mary warren. your soul alone is the issue here, 
mister,  and  you  will  prove  its  whiteness  or  you  cannot  live  in  a  christian 
country. will you tell me now what persons conspired with you in the devil’s 
company? proctor is silent. to your knowledge was rebecca nurse ever - 
 
proctor". i speak my own sins; i cannot judge another. crying out, with hatred: 
i have no tongue for it. 
 
hale,  quickly  to  danforth:  excellency,  it  is  enough  he  confess  himself.  let 
him sign it, let him sign it. 
 
parris, feverishly: it is a great service, sir. it is a weighty name; it will strike the 
village  that  proctor  confess.  i  beg  you,  let  him  sign  it.  the  sun  is  up, 
excellency! 
 
danforth, considers; then with dissatisfaction, come, then, sign your testimony. 
to cheever: give it to him. cheever goes to proctor, the confession and a pen 
in hand. proctor does not look at it. come, man, sign it. 
 
proctor,  after  glancing  at  the  confession:  you  have  all  wit-nessed  it  -  it  is 
enough. 
 
danforth: you will not sign it? 

 

 the crucible 

 142 
 
proctor: you have all witnessed it; what more is needed? 
 
danforth:  do  you  sport  with  me?  you  will  sign  your  name  or  it  is  no 
confession,  mister!  his  breast heaving with agonized breathing,  proctor now 
lays the paper down and signs his name. 
 
parris: praise be to the lord! 
 
proctor  has  just  finished  signing  when  danforth  reaches  for  the  paper.  but 
proctor snatches it up, and now a wild terror is rising in him, and a boundless 
anger. 
 
danforth, perplexed, but politely extending his hand: if you please, sir. 
 
proctor: no. 
 
danforth, as though proctor did not understand: mr. proctor, i must have - 
 
proctor: no, no. i have signed it, you have seen me. it is done! you have no 
need for this. 
 
parris: proctor, the village must have proof that - 
 
proctor: damn the village! i confess to god, and god has seen my name on 
this! it is enough! 
 
danforth: no, sir, it is - 
 
proctor: you came to save my soul, did you not? here! i have confessed 
myself; it is enough! 
 
danforth: you have not con - 
 
proctor: i have confessed myself! is there no good penitence but it be public? 
god does not need my name nailed upon the church! god sees my name; god 
knows how black my sins are! it is enough! 
 
danforth: mr. proctor - 
 
proctor: you will not use me! i am no sarah good or tituba,

 act four 

 
 
i am john proctor! you will not use me! it is no part of salva-tion that you should use 
me! 
 
danforth: i do not wish to - 
 
proctor: i have three children - how may i teach them to walk like men in the 
world, and i sold my friends? 
 
danforth: you have not sold your friends - 
 
proctor: beguile me not! i blacken all of them when this is nailed to the church 
the very day they hang for silence! 
 
danforth: mr. proctor, i must have good and legal proof that you - 
 
proctor:  you  are  the  high  court,  your  word  is  good  enough!  tell  them  i 
confessed myself; say proctor broke his knees and wept like a woman; say what 
you will, but my name cannot - 
 
danforth, with suspicion: it is the same, is it not? if i report it or you sign to it? 
 
proctor - he knows it is insane: no, it is not the same! what others say and what 
i sign to is not the same! 
 
danforth: why? do you mean to deny this confession when you are free? 
 
proctor: i mean to deny nothing! 
 
danforth: then explain to me, mr. proctor, why you will not let - 
 
proctor, with a cry of his whole soul: because it is my name! because i cannot 
have another in my life! because i lie and sign myself to lies! because i am not 
worth the dust on the feet of them that hang! how may i live without my name? 
i have given you my soul; leave me my name! 
 
danforth, pointing at the confession in proctor’s hand: is that document a lie? 
if it is a lie i will not accept it! what say you? 

 

 the crucible 

 144 
 
i  will  not  deal  in  lies,  mister!  proctor  is  motionless.  you  will  give  me  your  honest 
confession  in  my  hand,  or  i  cannot  keep  you  from  the  rope.  proctor  does  not  reply. 
which way do you go, mister? 
 
his breast heaving, his eyes staring, proctor tears the paper and crumples it, 
and he is weeping in fury, but erect. 
 
danforth: marshal! 
 
parris, hysterically, as though the tearing paper were his life: proctor, proctor! 
 
hale: man, you will hang! you cannot! 
 
proctor, his eyes fully of tears: i can. and there’s your first marvel, that i can. 
you  have  made  your  magic  now,  for  now  i  do  think  i  see  some  shred  of 
goodness  in  john  proctor.  not  enough  to  weave  a  banner  with,  but  white 
enough to keep it from such dogs. elizabeth, in a burst of terror, rushes to him 
and  weeps  against  his  hand.  give  them  no  tear!  tears  pleasure  them!  show 
honor  now,  show  a  stony  heart  and  sink  them  with  it!  he has lifted her, and 
kisses her now with great passion. 
 

danforth:  hang  them  high  over  the  town!  who  weeps  for  these,  weeps  for 
corruption!  he  sweeps  out  past  them.  herrick  starts  to  lead  rebecca,  who 
almost  collapses,  but  proctor  catches  her,  and  she  glances  up  at  him 
apologetically. 
 
rebecca: i’ve had no breakfast. 
 
herrick: come, man. 
 
herrick escorts them out, hathorne and cheever behind them. elizabeth stands 
staring at the empty doorway. 
 
parris,  in  deadly  fear,  to  elizabeth:  go  to  him,  goody  proctor!  there  is  yet 
time! 

rebecca: let you fear nothing! another judgment waits us all!

from outside a drumroll strikes the air. parris is startled. eliza-beth jerks about toward 
the window. 
 
parris:  go  to  him! he rushes out the door, as though to hold back his fate. proctor! 
proctor! 
 
again, a short burst of drums. 
 
hale: woman, plead with him! he starts to rush out the door, and then goes back to 
her. woman! it is pride, it is vanity. she avoids his eyes, and moves to the window. he 
drops to his knees. be his helper! - what profit him to bleed? shall the dust praise him? 
shall the worms declare his truth? go to him, take his shame away! 
 
elizabeth, supporting herself against collapse, grips the bars. of the window, and with a 
cry: he have his goodness now. god forbid i take it from him! 
 
the final drumroll crashes, then heightens violently. hale weeps in frantic prayer, and 
the new sun is pouring in upon her face, and the drums rattle like bones in the morning 
air. 
 

the curtain falls 

not  long  after  the  fever  died,  parris  was  voted  from  office,  walked  out  on  the 

echoes down the corridor 

 

highroad, and was never heard of again. 

the legend has it that abigail turned up later as a prostitute in boston. 
twenty years after the last execution, the government awarded compensation to the 
victims  still  living,  and  to  the  families  of  the  dead,  however,  it  is  evident  that  some 
people still were unwilling to admit their total guilt, and also that the factionalism was 
still alive, for some beneficiaries were actually not victims at all, but informers. 

elizabeth proctor married again, four years after proctor’s death. 
in  solemn  meeting,  the  congregation  rescinded  the  excommunica-tions  -  this  in 
march 1712. but they did so upon orders of the government. the jury, however, wrote a 
statement praying forgive-ness of all who had suffered. 

certain farms which had belonged to the victims were left to ruin, and for more than 

a century no one would buy them or live on them. 

to all intents and purposes, the power of theocracy in massachu-setts was broken.

proctor  enters  with  lantern,  glowing  behind  him,  then  halts,  holding  lantern  raised. 
abigail  appears  with  a  wrap  over  her  nightgown,  her  hair  down.  a  moment  of 
questioning silence. 
 
proctor, searching: i must speak with you, abigail. she does not move, staring at him. 
will you sit? 
 
abigail: how do you come? 
 
proctor: friendly. 
 
abigail,  glancing  about:  i  don’t  like  the  woods  at  night.  pray  you,  stand  closer.  he 
comes closer to her. i knew it must be you. when i heard the pebbles on the window, 
before i opened up my eyes i knew. sits on log. i thought you would come a good time 
sooner. 
 
proctor: i had thought to come many times. 
 
abigail: why didn’t you? i am so alone in the world now. 
 
proctor, as a fact, not bitterly: are you! i’ve heard that people ride a hundred mile to 
see your face these days. 
 
abigail: aye, my face. can you see my face? 
 
proctor, holds lantern to her face: then you’re troubled?

  abigail: have you come to mock me? 
 
proctor, sets lantern on ground. sits next to her: no, no, but i hear only that you go to the tavern 
every night, and play shovel-board with the deputy governor, and they give you cider. 
 
abigail: i have once or twice played the shovelboard. but i have no joy in it. 
 
proctor:  this  is  a  surprise,  abby.  i’d  thought  to  find  you  gayer  than  this.  i’m  told  a 
troop of boys go step for step with you wherever you walk these days. 
 
abigail: aye, they do. but i have only lewd looks from the boys. 
 
proctor: and you like that not? 
 
abigail: i cannot bear lewd looks no more, john. my spirit’s changed entirely. i ought 
be given godly looks when i suffer for them as i do. 
 
proctor: oh? how do you suffer, abby? 
 
abigail,  pulls  up  dress:  why,  look  at  my  leg.  i’m  holes  all  over  from  their  damned 
needles and pins. touching her stomach: the jab your wife gave me’s not healed yet, 
y’know. 
 
proctor, seeing her madness now: oh, it isn’t. 
 
abigail'. i think sometimes she pricks it open again while i sleep. 
 
proctor: ah? 
 
abigail: and george jacobs - sliding up her sleeve - he comes again and again and raps 
me with his stick - the same spot every night all this week. look at the lump i have. 
proctor: abby - george jacobs is in the jail all this month. 
abigail: thank god he is, and bless the day he hangs and lets

me  sleep  in  peace  again!  oh,  john,  the  world’s  so  full  of  hypo-crites!  astonished, 
outraged: they pray in jail! i’m told they all pray in jail! 
 
proctor: they may not pray? 
 
abigail: and torture me in my bed while sacred words are comin’ from their 
mouths? oh, it will need god himself to cleanse this town properly! 
 
proctor: abby - you mean to cry out still others? 
 
abigail: if i live, if i am not murdered, i surely will, until the last hypocrite is 
dead. 
 
proctor: then there is no good? 
 
abigail: aye, there is one. you are good. 
 
proctor: am i! how am i good? 
 
abigail: why, you taught me goodness, therefore you are good. it were a fire 
you walked me through, and all my ignorance was burned away. it were a fire, 
john, we lay in fire. and from that night no woman dare call me wicked any 
more but i knew my answer. i used to weep for my sins when the wind lifted up 
my skirts; and blushed for shame because some old rebecca called ,me loose. 
and then you burned my ignorance away. as bare as some december tree i saw 
them all - walking like saints to church, running to feed the sick, and hypocrites 
in their hearts! and god gave me strength to call them liars, and god made men 
to listen to me, and by god l will scrub the world clean for the love of him! oh, 
john, i will make you such a wife when the world is white again! she kisses his 
hand. you will be amazed to see me every day, a light of heaven in your house, 
a - he rises, backs away amazed. why are you cold? 
 
proctor: my wife goes to trial in the morning, abigail. 
 
abigail, distantly: your wife?

proctor: surely you knew of it? 
aaraaii.: i do remember it now. how - how - is she well? 
proctor: as well as she may be, thirty-six days in that place. 
aaroatr.: you said you came friendly. 
proctor: she will not be condemned, abby. 
abigail: you brought me from my bed to speak of her? 
 
proctor: i come to tell you, abby, what i will do tomorrow in the court. i would 
not take you by surprise, but give you all good time to think on what to do to 
save yourself. 
 
abigail: save myself! 
 
proctor: if you do not free my wife tomorrow, i am set and bound to ruin you, 
abby. 
 
abigail, her voice small - astonished: how - ruin me? 
 
proctor: i have rocky proof in documents that you knew that poppet were none 
of my wife’s; and that you yourself bade mary warren stab that needle into it. 
 
abigail  -  0  wildness  stirs  in  her,  a  child  is  standing  here  who  is  unutterably 
frustrated, denied her wish, but she is still grasping for her wits: 1 bade mary 
warren - ? 
 
proc tor: you know what you do, you are not so mad! 
 
abigail: oh, hypocrites! have you won him, too? john, why do you let them 
send you? 
 
proctor: i warn you, abby! 
 
abigail: they send you! they steal your honesty and - 
 
proctor: i have found my honesty! 
 
abigail: no, this is your wife pleading, your sniveling, envious

wife! this is rebecca’s voice, martha corey’s voice. you were no hypocrite! 
 
proctor: i will prove you for the fraud you are! 
 
abigail: and if they ask you why abigail would ever do so murderous a deed, 
what will you tell them? 
 
proctor: i will tell them why. 
 
aatoan,: what will you tell? you will confess to fornication? in the court? 
 
proctor: if you will have it so, so i will tell it! she utters a disbelieving laugh. i 
say i will! she laughs louder, now with more assurance he will never do it. he 
shakes  her  roughly.  if  you  can  still  hear,  hear  this!  can  you  hear!  she  is 
trembling, staring up at him as though he were out of his mind. you will tell the 
court you are blind to spirits; you cannot see them any more, and you will never 
cry witchery again, or i will make you famous for the whore you are! 
 
abigail,  grabs  him:  never  in  this  world!  i  know  you,  john  -  you  are  this 
moment singing secret hallelujahs that your wife will hang! 
 

proctor, throws her down: you mad, you murderous bitch! 
 
abigail: oh, how hard it is when pretense falls! but it falls, it falls! she wraps 
herself up as though to go. you have done your duty by hei. i hope it is your 
last hypocrisy. i pray you will come again with sweeter news for me. i know 
you will - now that your duty’s done. good night, john. she is backing away, 
raising  her  hand  in  farewell.  fear  naught.  i  will  save  you  tomorrow.  as  she 
turns and goes: from yourself i will save you. she is gone. proctor is left alone, 
amazed, in terror. takes up his lantern and slowly exits.
