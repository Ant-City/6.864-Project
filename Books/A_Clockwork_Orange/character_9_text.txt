â€œwhatâ€™s it going to be then, eh?â€

there was me, that is alex, and my three droogs, that is pete, georgie, and dim. dim being really dim, and we sat in the korova milkbar making up our rassoodocks what to do with the evening, a flip dark chill winter bastard though dry. the korova milkbar was a milk-plus mesto, and you may, o my brothers, have forgotten what these mestos were like, things changing so skorry these days and everybody very quick to forget, newspapers not being read much neither. well, what they sold there was milk plus something else. they had no licence for selling liquor, but there

the four of us were dressed in the height of fashion, which in those days was a pair of black very tight tights with the old jelly mould, as we called it, fitting on the crotch underneath the tights, this being to protect and also a sort of a design you could viddy clear enough in a certain light, so that i had one in the shape of a spider, pete had a rooker (a hand, that is), georgie had a very fancy one of a flower, and poor old dim had a very hound-and-horny one of a clownâ€™s litso (face, that is). dim not ever having much of an idea of things and being, beyond all shadow of a doubting thomas, the dimmest of we four. then we wore waisty jackets without lapels but with these very big built-up shoulders (â€˜pletchoesâ€™ we called them) which were a kind of a mockery of having real shoulders like that. then, my brothers, we had these off-white cravats which looked like whip

lled the music. i could feel the knives in the old moloko starting to prick, and now i was ready for a bit of twenty-to-one. so i yelped: â€œout out out out!â€ like a doggie, and then i cracked this veck who was sitting next to me and well away and burbling a horrorshow crack on the ooko or earhole, but he didnâ€™t feel it and went on with his â€œtelephonic hardware and when the farfarculule gets rubadubdub.â€ heâ€™d feel it all right when he came to, out of the land.

â€œwhere out?â€ said georgie.

â€œoh, just to keep walking,â€ i said, â€œand viddy what turns up, o my little brothers.â€

so we scatted out into the big winter nochy and walked down marghanita boulevard and then turned into boothby avenue, and there we found what we were pretty well looking for, a malenky jest to start off the evening with. there was a doddery starry schoolmaster type veck, glasses on and his rot open to the cold nochy air. he had books under his arm and a crappy umbrella and was coming round the co

ree books from him and handed them round real skorry.

being three, we all had one each to viddy at except for dim. the one i had was called â€˜elementary crystallography,â€™ so i opened it up and said: â€œexcellent, really first-class,â€ keeping turning the pages. then i said in a very shocked type goloss: â€œbut what is this here? what is this filthy slovo? i blush to look at this word. you disappoint me, brother, you do really.â€

â€œbut,â€ he tried, â€œbut, but.â€

â€œnow,â€ said georgie, â€œhere is what i should call real dirt. thereâ€™s one slovo beginning with an f and another with a c.â€ he had a book called â€˜the miracle of the snowflake.â€™

â€œoh,â€ said poor old dim, smotting over peteâ€™s shoulder and going too far, like he always did, â€œit says here what he done to her, and thereâ€™s a picture and all. why,â€ he said, â€œyouâ€™re nothing but a filthy-minded old skitebird.â€

â€œan old man of your age, brother,â€ i said, and i started to rip up the book iâ€™

when things were made to last like, but i managed to rip the pages up and chuck them in handfuls of like snowflakes, though big, all over this creeching old veck, and then the others did the same with theirs, old dim just dancing about like the clown he was. â€œthere you are,â€ said pete. â€œthereâ€™s the mackerel of the cornflake for you, you dirty reader of filth and nastiness.â€

â€œyou naughty old veck, you,â€ i said, and then we began to filly about with him. pete held his rookers and georgie sort of hooked his rot wide open for him and dim yanked out his false zoobies, upper and lower. he threw these down on the pavement and then i treated them to the old boot-crush, though they were hard bastards like, being made of some new horrorshow plastic stuff. the old veck began to make sort of chumbling shoomsâ€”â€œwuf waf wofâ€â€”so georgie let go of holding his goobers apart and just let him have one in the toothless rot with his ringy fist, and that made the old veck start moaning a lo

ee avenue, and there was this sweets and cancers shop still open. weâ€™d left them alone near three months now and the whole district had been very quiet on the whole, so the armed millicents or rozz patrols werenâ€™t round there much, being more north of the river these days. we put our maskies onâ€”new jobs these were, real horrorshow, wonderfully done really; they were like faces of historical personalities (they gave you the names when you bought) and i had disraeli, pete had elvis presley, georgie had henry viii and poor old dim had a poet veck called peebee shelley; they were a real like disguise, hair and all, and they were some very special plastic veshch so you could roll it up when youâ€™d done with it and hide it in your bootâ€”then three of us went in.

there were four of us to six of them, like i have already indicated, but poor old dim, for all his dimness, was worth three of the others in sheer madness and dirty fighting. dim had a real horrorshow length of oozy or chain round his waist, twice wound round, and he unwound this and began to swing it beautiful in the eyes or glazzies. pete and georgie had good sharp nozhes, but i for my own part had a fine starry horrorshow cut-throat britva which, at that time, i could flash and shine artistic. so there we were dratsing away in the dark, the old luna with men on it just coming up, the stars stabbing away as it might be knives anxious to join in the dratsing. with my britva i managed to slit right down the front of one of billyboyâ€™s droogâ€™s platties, very very neat and not even touching the plott under the cloth. then in the dratsing thi

we fillied round what was called the backtown for a bit, scaring old vecks and cheenas that were crossi

â€œwhat is this? who are you? how dare you enter my house without permission.â€ and all the time his goloss was trembling and his rookers too. so i said:

â€œnever fear. if fear thou hast in thy heart, o brother, pray banish it forthwith.â€ then georgie and pete went out to find the kitchen, while old dim waited for orders, standing next to me with his rot wide open. â€œwhat is this, then?â€ i said, picking up the pile like of typing from off of the table, and the horn-rimmed moodge said, dithering:

â€œthatâ€™s just what i want to know. what is this? what do you want? get out at once before i throw you out.â€ so poor old dim, masked like peebee shelley, had a good loud smeck at that, roaring like some animal.

k, first left fistie then right, so that our dear old droog the redâ€”red vino on tap and the same in all places, like itâ€™s put out by the same big firmâ€”started to pour and spot the nice clean carpet and the bits of this book that i was still ripping away at, razrez razrez. all this time this devotchka, his loving and faithful wife, just stood like froze by the fireplace, and then she started letting out little malenky creeches, like in time to the like music of old dimâ€™s fisty work. then georgie and pete came in from the kitchen, both munching away, though with their maskies on, you could do that with them on and no trouble. georgie with like a cold leg of something in one rooker and half a loaf of kleb with a big dollop of maslo on it in the other, and pete with a bottle of beer frothing its gulliver off and a horrorshow rookerful of like plum cake. they went haw haw haw, viddying old dim dancing round and fisting the writer veck so that the writer veck started to platch like his life

ther veshch, bog help us all.â€ so he did the strong-man on the devotchka, who was still creech creech creeching away in very horrorshow four-in-a-bar, locking her rookers from the back, while i ripped away at this and that and the other, the others going haw haw haw still, and real good horrorshow groodies they were that then exhibited their pink glazzies, o my brothers, while i untrussed and got ready for the plunge. plunging, i could slooshy cries of agony and this writer bleeding veck that georgie and pete held on to nearly got loose howling bezoomny with the filthiest of slovos that i already knew and others he was making up.

then after me it was right old dim should have his turn, which he did in a beasty snorty howly sort of a way with his peebee shelley maskie taking no notice, while i held on to her. then there was a changeover, dim and me grabbing the slobbering writer veck who was past struggling really, only just coming out with slack sort of slovos like he was in the land in

a milk-plus bar, and pete and georgie had theirs. then there was like quiet and we were full of like hate, so smashed what was left to be smashedâ€”typewriter, lamp, chairsâ€”and dim, it was typical of old dim, watered the fire out and was going to dung on the carpet, there being plenty of paper, but i said no. â€œout out out out,â€ i howled. the writer veck and his zheena were not really there, bloody and torn and making noises. but theyâ€™d live.

so we got into the waiting auto and i left it to georgie to take the wheel, me f

then we made for the station to ride the one stop to center, as the middle of the town was called. we paid our fares nice and polite and waited gentlemanly and quiet on the platform, old dim fillying with the slot machines, his carmans being full of small malenky coin, and ready if need be to distribute chocbars to the poor and starving, though there was none such about, and then the old espresso rapido came lumbering in and

but old dim, as soon as heâ€™d slooshied this dollop of song like a lomtick of redhot meat plonked on your plate, let off one of his vulgarities, which in this case was a lip-trump followed by a dog-howl followed by two fingers pronging twice at the air followed by a clowny guffaw. i felt myself all of a fever and like drowning in redhot blood, slooshying and viddying dimâ€™s vulgarity, and i said: â€œbastard. filthy drooling mannerless bastard.â€ then i leaned across georgie, who was between me and horrible dim, and fisted dim skorry on the rot. dim looked very surprised, his rot open, wiping the krovvy off of his goober with his rook and in turn looking surprised at the red flowing krovvy and at me. â€œwhat for did you do that for?â€ he said in his ignorant way. not many viddied what iâ€™d done, and those that viddied cared not. the stereo was on again and was playing a very sick electronic guitar veshch. i said:

â€œfor being a bastard with no manners and not

â€œif you donâ€™t like this and you wouldnâ€™t want that, then you know what to do, little brother.â€ georgie said, in a sharp way that made me look:

â€œall right. letâ€™s not be starting.â€

â€œthatâ€™s clean up to dim,â€ i said. â€œdim canâ€™t go on all his jeezny being as a little child.â€ and i looked sharp at georgie.

dim said, and the red krovvy was easing its flow now:

â€œwhat natural right does he have to think he can give the orders and tolchock me whenever he likes? yarbles is what i say to him, and iâ€™d chain his glazzies out as soon as look.â€

â€œoh now, donâ€™t, both of you malchicks. droogs, arenâ€™t we? it isnâ€™t right droogs should behave thiswise. see, there are some loose-lipped malchicks over there smecking at us, leering like. we mustnâ€™t let ourselves down.â€

â€œdim,â€ i said, â€œhas got to learn his place. right?â€

â€œwait,â€ said georgie. â€œwhat is all this about place? this is the first i ever hear about lewdies learning their place.â€

pete said: â€œif the truth is known, alex, you shouldnâ€™t have given old dim that uncalled-for tolchock. iâ€™ll say it once and no more. i say it with all respect, but if it had been me youâ€™d given it to youâ€™d have to answer. i say no more.â€ and he drowned his litso in his milk-glass.

â€œi think it best we go home now. dim has made a real horrorshow suggestion. if we donâ€™t meet day-wise, o my brothers, well thenâ€”same time same place tomorrow?â€

â€œoh yes,â€ said georgie. â€œi think that can be arranged.â€

â€œi might,â€ said dim, â€œbe just that malenky bit late. but same place and near same time tomorrow surely.â€ he was still wiping at his goober, though no krovvy flowed any longer now. â€œand,â€ he said, â€œit is to be hoped there wonâ€™t be no more of them singing ptitsas in here.â€ then he gave his old dim guff, a clowny big hohohohoho. it seemed like he was too dim to take much offence.

â€œoh?â€ i had an in-grin at that, papapa believing i had really reformed or believing he believed. and then i remembered my own dream, which was a dream of that morning, of georgie giving his generalâ€™s orders and old dim smecking around toothless as he wielded the whip. but dreams go by opposites i was once told. â€œnever worry about thine only son and heir, o my father,â€ i said. â€œfear not. he canst taketh care of himself, verily.â€

â€œi could have chained his glazzies real horrorshow,â€ said dim, and the old baboochkas were stil on with their â€œthanks, lads.â€

â€œit was this house, see,â€ said georgie. â€œthe one with the two lamps outside. the one with the gloopy name like.â€

â€œwhat gloopy name?â€

â€œthe mansion or the manse or some such piece of gloop. where this very starry ptitsa lives with her cats and all these very starry valuable veshches.â€

â€œsuch as?â€

â€œgold and silver and like jewels. it was will the english who like said.â€

and as we were going out the old baboochkas said: â€œweâ€™ll say nothing, lads. been here all the time you have, boys.â€ so i said: â€œgood old girls. back to buy more in ten minutes.â€ and so i led my three droogs out to my doom.

the floor, so you could tell there were plenty of mewing kots and koshkas writhing about down there. and we could viddy one or two, great fat scoteenas, jumping up on to the table with their rots open going mare mare mare. and you could viddy this old baboochka talking back to them, govoreeting in like scoldy language to her pussies. in the room you could viddy a lot of old pictures on the walls and starry very elaborate clocks, also some like vases and ornaments that looked starry and dorogoy. georgie whispered: â€œreal horrorshow deng to be gotten for them, brothers. will the english is real anxious.â€ pete said: â€œhow in?â€

now it was up to me, and skorry, before georgie started telling us how. â€œfirst veshch,â€ i whispered, â€œis to try the regular way, the front. i will go very polite and say that one of my droogs has had a like funny fainting turn on the street. georgie can be ready to show, when she opens, thatwise. then to ask for water or to phone the doc. then in easy.â€ ge

orgie said:

â€œshe may not open.â€ i said:

â€œweâ€™ll try it, yes?â€ and he sort of shrugged his pletchoes, making with a frogâ€™s rot. so i said to pete and old dim: â€œyou two droogies get either side of the door. right?â€ they nodded in the dark right right right. â€œso,â€ i said to georgie, and i made bold straight for the front door. there was a bellpush and i pushed, and brrrrrrr brrrrr sounded down the hall inside. alike sense of slooshying followed, as though the ptitsa and her koshkas all had their ears back at the brrrrrr brrrrrr, wondering. so i pushed the old zvonock a malenky bit more urgent. i then bent down to the letter-slit and called through in a refined like goloss: â€œhelp, madam, please. my friend has just had a funny turn on the street. let me phone a doctor, pl

ease.â€ then i could viddy a light being put on in the hall, and then i could hear the old baboochkaâ€™s nogas going flip flap in flip-flap slippers to nearer the front door, and i got the idea, i donâ€™t know why, that she had a big fat pussycat under each arm. then she called out in a very surprising deep like goloss:

â€œgo away. go away or i shoot.â€ georgie heard that and wanted to giggle. i said, with like suffering and urgency in my gentlemanâ€™s goloss:

â€œoh, please help, madam. my friendâ€™s very ill.â€

â€œgo away,â€ she called. â€œi know your dirty tricks, making me open the door and then buy things i donâ€™t want. go away. i tell you.â€ that was real lovely innocence, that was. â€œgo away,â€ she said again, â€œor iâ€™ll set my cats on to you.â€ a malenky bit bezoomny she was, you could tell that, through spending her jeezny all o

 door. me stand on dimâ€™s pletchoes. open that window and me enter, droogies. then to shut up that old ptitsa and open up for all. no trouble.â€ for i was like showing who was leader and the chelloveck with the ideas. â€œsee,â€ i said. â€œreal horrorshow bit of stonework over that door, a nice hold for my nogas.â€ they viddied all that, admiring perhaps i thought, and said and nodded right right right in the dark.

so back tiptoe to the door. dim was our heavy strong malchick and pete and georgie like heaved me up on to dimâ€™s bolshy manly pletchoes. all this time, o thanks to worldcasts on the gloopy tv and, more, lewdiesâ€™ night-fear through lack of night-police, dead lay the street. up there on dimâ€™s pletchoes i viddied that this stonework above the door would take my boots lovely. i kneed up, brothers, and there i was.

the window, as i had expected, was closed, but i outed with my britva and cracked the glass of the window smart with the bony handle thereof. all the time belo

we all look forward to a pleasant evening together, donâ€™t we not?â€ i said:

â€œhow do you know my name, you stinking vonny bully? may bog blast you to hell, grahzny bratchny as you are, you sod.â€ so they all had a smeck at that and i had my ooko like twisted by one of these stinking millicents at the back with me. the fat-necked not-driver said:

â€œeverybody knows little alex and his droogs. quite a famous young boy our alex has become.â€

â€œitâ€™s those others,â€ i creeched. â€œgeorgie and dim and pete. no droogs of mine, the bastards.â€

â€œwell,â€ said the fat-neck, â€œyouâ€™ve got the evening in front of you to tell the whole story of the daring exploits of those young gentlemen and how they led poor little innocent alex astray.â€ then there was the shoom of another like police siren passing this auto but going the other way.

â€œis that for those bastards?â€ i said. â€œare they being picked up by you bastards?â€

â€œthat,â€ said fat-neck, â€œis an ambulance. d

gs sometimes some starry prof type veck would give a talk on beetles or the milky way or the glorious wonders of the snowflake, and i had a good smeck at this last one, because it reminded me of that time of the tolchocking and sheer vandalism with that ded coming from the public biblio on a winterâ€™s night when my droogs were stil not traitors and i was like happy and free. of those droogs i had slooshied but one thing, and that was one day when my pee and em came to visit and i was told that georgie was dead. yes, dead, my brothers. dead as a bit of dog-cal on the road. georgie had led the other two into a like very rich chelloveckâ€™s house, and there they had kicked and tolchocked the owner on the floor, and then georgie had started to razrez the cushions and curtains, and then old dim had cracked at some very precious ornaments, like statues and so on, and this rich beat-up chelloveck had raged like real bezoomny and gone for them all with a very heavy iron bar. his being all razdraz ha

d given him some gigantic strength, and dim and pete had got out through the window, but georgie had tripped on the carpet and then brought this terrible swinging iron bar crack and splodge on the gulliver, and that was the end of traitorous georgie. the starry murderer had got off with self defence, as was really right and proper. georgie being killed, though it was more than one year after me being caught by the millicents, it all seemed right and proper and like fate.

â€œwhatâ€™s it going to be then, eh?â€

i was in the wing chapel, it being sunday morning, and the prison charlie was govoreeting the word of the lord. it was my rabbit to play the starry stereo, putting on solemn music before and after and in the middle too when hymns were sung. i was at the back of the wing chapel (there were four along here in staja 84f)

nder.â€ and they took me in a real strong grip and like walked me out of the biblio. there was a millicent patrol-car waiting outside, and this veck they called rex was the driver. they like tolchocked me into the back of this auto, and i couldnâ€™t help feeling it was all really like a joke, and that dim anyway would pull his shlem off his gulliver and go haw haw haw. but he didnâ€™t. i said, trying to fight the strack inside me:

â€œand old pete, what happened to old pete? it was sad about georgie,â€ i said. â€œi slooshied all about that.â€

â€œpete, oh yes, pete,â€ said dim. â€œi seem to remember like the name.â€ i could viddy we were driving out of town. i said:

â€œwhere are we supposed to be going?â€

billyboy turned round from the front to say: â€œitâ€™s light still. a little drive into the country, all winter-bare but lonely and lovely. it is not right, not always, for lewdies in the town to viddy too much of our summary punishments. streets must be kept clean in more th

rorshow, not the sort you would want to like throw down and give the old in-out in-out to, but with a horrorshow plott and litso and a smiling rot and very very fair voloss and all that cal. and then the veck with her, who had a hat on his gulliver and had his litso like turned away from me, swivelled round to viddy the bolshy big clock they had on the wall in this mesto, and then i viddied who he was and then he viddied who i was. it was pete, one of my three droogs from those days when it was georgie and dim and him and me. it was pete like looking a lot older though he could not now be more than nineteen and a bit, and he had a bit of a moustache and an ordinary day-suit and this baton. i said:

â€œwell well well, droogie, what gives? very very long time no viddy.â€ he said:

â€œitâ€™s little alex, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œnone other,â€ i said. â€œa long long long time since those dead and gone good days. and now poor georgie, they told me, is underground and old dim is a brutal millicen
