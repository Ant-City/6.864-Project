 pursuing french.
chaucer, who had been made prisoner at the siege of retters,
was among the captives in the possession of france when the
treaty of bretigny -- the "great peace" -- was concluded, in
may, 1360. returning to england, as we may suppose, at the
peace, the poet, ere long, fell into another and a pleasanter
captivity; for his marriage is generally believed to have taken
place shortly after his release from foreign durance.  he had
already gained the personal friendship and favour of john of
gaunt, duke of lancaster, the king's son; the duke, while earl
of richmond, had courted, and won to wife after a certain
delay, blanche, daughter and co-heiress of henry duke of
lancaster; and chaucer is by some believed to have written
"the assembly of fowls" to celebrate the wooing, as he wrote
"chaucer's dream" to celebrate the wedding, of his patron. the
marriage took place in 1359, the year of chaucer's expedition to
france; and as, in "the assembly of fowls," the formel or

 but that his future wife had also peculiar claims
on their regard.  she was the younger daughter of sir payne
roet, a native of hainault, who had, like many of his
countrymen, been attracted to england by the example and
patronage of queen philippa. the favourite attendant on the
lady blanche was her elder sister katherine: subsequently
married to sir hugh swynford, a gentleman of lincolnshire;
and destined, after the death of blanche, to be in succession
governess of her children, mistress of john of gaunt, and
lawfully-wedded duchess of lancaster. it is quite sufficient
proof that chaucer's position at court was of no mean
consequence, to find that his wife, the sister of the future
duchess of lancaster, was one of the royal maids of honour,
and even, as sir harris nicolas conjectures, a god-daughter of
the queen -- for her name also was philippa.

prisoner while bearing arms in france, and september 1366,

 we have
what seems evidence of chaucer's compliance with these terms
in "the house of fame", where, in the mouth of the eagle, the
poet describes himself, when he has finished his labour and
made his reckonings, as not seeking rest and news in social
intercourse, but going home to his own house, and there, "all so
dumb as any stone," sitting "at another book," until his look is
dazed; and again, in the record that in 1376 he received a grant
of l731, 4s. 6d., the amount of a fine levied on one john kent,
whom chaucer's vigilance had frustrated in the attempt to ship a
quantity of wool for dordrecht without paying the duty. the
seemingly derogatory condition, that the controller should
write out the accounts or rolls ("rotulos") of his office with his
own hand, appears to have been designed, or treated, as merely
formal; no records in chaucer's handwriting are known to exist
-- which could hardly be the case if, for the twelve years of his
controllership (1374-1386), he had duly complied w

iii., he was sent to flanders
with sir thomas percy, afterwards earl of worcester, for the
purpose of obtaining a prolongation of the truce; and in january
13738, he was associated with sir guichard d'angle and other
commissioners, to pursue certain negotiations for a marriage
between princess mary of france and the young king richard
ii., which had been set on foot before the death of edward iii.
the negotiation, however, proved fruitless; and in may 1378,
chaucer was selected to accompany sir john berkeley on a
mission to the court of bernardo visconti, duke of milan, with
the view, it is supposed, of concerting military plans against the
outbreak of war with france.  the new king, meantime, had
shown that he was not insensible to chaucer's merit  -- or to the
influence of his tutor and the poet's patron, the duke of
lancaster; for richard ii. confirmed to chaucer his pension of
twenty marks, along with an equal annual sum, for which the
daily pitcher of wine granted in 1374 had been com

muted.
before his departure for lombardy, chaucer -- still holding his
post in the customs -- selected two representatives or trustees,
to protect his estate against legal proceedings in his absence, or
to sue in his name defaulters and offenders against the imposts
which he was charged to enforce. one of these trustees was
called richard forrester; the other was john gower, the poet,
the most famous english contemporary of chaucer, with whom
he had for many years been on terms of admiring friendship --
although, from the strictures passed on certain productions of
gower's in the prologue to the man of law's tale,<6> it has
been supposed that in the later years of chaucer's life the
friendship suffered some diminution. to the "moral gower" and
"the philosophical strode," chaucer "directed" or dedicated his
"troilus and cressida;" <7> while, in the "confessio

her at richard's accession in 1377.  the change made in
chaucer's pecuniary position, by the loss of his offices and his
wife's pension, must have been very great. it would appear that
during his prosperous times he had lived in a style quite equal to
his income, and had no ample resources against a season of
reverse; for, on the 1st of may 1388, less than a year and a half
after being dismissed from the customs, he was constrained to
assign his pensions, by surrender in chancery, to one john
scalby.  in may 1389, richard ii., now of age, abruptly
resumed the reins of government, which, for more than two
years, had been ably but cruelly managed by gloucester. the
friends of lancaster were once more supreme in the royal
councils, and chaucer speedily profited by the change. on the
12th of july he was appointed clerk of the king's works at the
palace of westminster, the tower, the royal manors of
kennington, eltham, clarendon, sheen, byfleet, childern
langley, and feckenham, the castl

parks of clarendon, childern langley, and feckenham, and the
mews for the king's falcons at charing cross; he received a
salary of two shillings per day, and was allowed to perform the
duties by deputy. for some reason unknown, chaucer held this
lucrative office <10> little more than two years, quitting it
before the 16th of september 1391, at which date it had passed
into the hands of one john gedney. the next two years and a
half are a blank, so far as authentic records are concerned;
chaucer is supposed to have passed them in retirement,
probably devoting them principally to the composition of the
canterbury tales. in february 1394, the king conferred upon
him a grant of l20 a year for life; but he seems to have had no
other source of income, and to have become embarrassed by
debt, for frequent memoranda of small advances on his pension
show that his circumstances were, in comparis

it is true -- for similar
documents had been issued at the beginning of richard's reign;
but at that time chaucer's missions abroad, and his responsible
duties in the port of london, may have furnished reasons for
securing him against annoyance or frivolous prosecution, which
were wholly wanting at the later date.  in 1398, fortune began
again to smile upon him; he received a royal grant of a tun of
wine annually, the value being about l4. next year, richard ii
having been deposed by the son of john of gaunt <11>  --
henry of bolingbroke, duke of lancaster -- the new king, four
days after hits accession, bestowed on chaucer a grant of forty
marks (l26, 13s. 4d.) per annum, in addition to the pension of
l20 conferred by richard ii. in 1394.  but the poet, now
seventy-one years of age, and probably broken down by the
reverses of the past few years, was not destined long to enjoy
his renewed prosperity.  on christmas eve of 1399, he entered
on the possession of a house in the garden of the ch

of such power, that he was superior to all english poets of
preceding ages, not excepting his fellow-citizen chaucer."

2. see introduction to "the legend of good women".

3. called in the editions before 1597 "the dream of chaucer".
the poem, which is not included in the present edition, does
indeed, like many of chaucer's smaller works, tell the story of a
dream, in which a knight, representing john of gaunt, is found
by the poet mourning the loss of his lady; but the true "dream
of chaucer," in which he celebrates the marriage of his patron,
was published for the first time by speght in 1597. john of
gaunt, in the end of 1371, married his second wife, constance,
daughter to pedro the cruel of spain; so that "the book of the
duchess" must have been written between 1369 and 1371.

opinion that this poem was really produced in chaucer's mature
age. see the introductory notes to it and to the legend of good

8. the old biographers of chaucer, founding on what they took
to be autobiographic allusions in "the testament of love,"
assign to him between 1354 and 1389 a very different history
from that here given on the strength of authentic records
explored and quoted by sir h. nicolas. chaucer is made to
espouse the cause of john of northampton, the wycliffite lord
mayor of london, whose re-election in 1384 was so
vehemently opposed by the clergy, and who was imprisoned in
the sequel of the grave disorders that arose. the poet, it is said,
fled to the continent, taking with him a large sum of money,
which he spent in supporting companions in exile; then,
returning by stealth to england in quest of funds, he was
detected and sent to the tower, where he languished for three
years, being released only on the humiliating co

 "the commissioners appear to have commenced their
labours with examining the accounts of the officers employed in
the collection of the revenue; and the sequel affords a strong
presumption that the royal administration [under lancaster and
his friends] had been foully calumniated. we hear not of any
frauds discovered, or of defaulters punished, or of grievances
redressed." such is the testimony of lingard (chap. iv., 1386),
all the more valuable for his aversion from the wycliffite
leanings of john of gaunt. chaucer's department in the london
customs was in those days one of the most important and
lucrative in the kingdom; and if mercenary abuse of his post
could have been proved, we may be sure that his and his
patron's enemies would not have been content with simple
dismissal, but would have heavily amerced or imprisoned him.

second daughter and co-heiress of sir john burghersh, brother
of the bishop of lincoln, the chancellor and treasurer of
england. by this marriage thomas chaucer acquired great
estates in oxfordshire and elsewhere; and he figured
prominently in the second rank of courtiers for many years. he
was chief butler to richard ii.; under henry iv. he was
constable of wallingford castle, steward of the honours of
wallingford and st valery, and of the chiltern hundreds; and

notes to the man of law's tale


1. this tale is believed by tyrwhitt to have been taken, with no
material change, from the "confessio amantis" of john gower,
who was contemporary with chaucer, though somewhat his
senior.  in the prologue, the references to the stories of canace,
and of apollonius tyrius, seem to be an attack on gower, who
had given these tales in his book; whence tyrwhitt concludes
that the friendship between the two poets suffered some
interruption in the latter part of their lives.  gower was not the
inventor of the story, which he found in old french romances,
and it is not improbable that chaucer may have gone to the

30. tercelet: the "tassel," or male of any species of hawk; so
called, according to cotgrave, because he is one third ("tiers")
smaller than the female.

31. "and lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the
one adah, and the name of the other zillah" (gen. iv. 19).

32. galoche:  shoe; it seems to have been used in france, of a
"sabot," or wooden shoe.  the reader cannot fail to recall the
same illustration in john i. 27, where the baptist says of christ:
"he it is, who coming after me is preferred before me; whose
shoe's latchet i am not worthy to unloose."

33. byleve; stay; another form is "bleve;" from anglo-saxon,
"belitan," to remain.  compare german, "bleiben."

34. this sentiment, as well as the illustration of the bird which
follows, is taken from the third book of boethius, "de
consolatione philosophiae," metrum 2. it has thus been
rendered in chaucer's translation: "all things seek aye to their

proper course, and all things rejoice on their returning again to
their nature."

35. men love of proper kind newfangleness: men, by their own
-- their very -- nature, are fond of novelty, and prone to
inconstancy.

36. blue was the colour of truth, as green was that of
inconstancy.  in john stowe's additions to chaucer's works,
printed in 1561, there is "a balade whiche chaucer made
against women inconstaunt," of which the refrain is, "in stead of
blue, thus may ye wear all green."

37. unless we suppose this to be a namesake of the camballo
who was canace's brother -- which is not at all probable -- we
must agree with tyrwhitt that there is a mistake here; which no
doubt chaucer would have rectified, if the tale had not been
"left half-told," one manuscript reads "caballo;" and t

notes to the prologue to the nun's priest's tale


1. the request is justified by the description of monk in the
prologue as "an out-rider, that loved venery."

2. on this tyrwhitt remarks; "i know not how it has happened,
that in the principal modern languages, john, or its equivalent,
is a name of contempt or at least of slight.  so the italians use
'gianni,' from whence 'zani;' the spaniards 'juan,' as 'bobo
juan,' a foolish john; the french 'jean,' with various additions;
and in english, when we call a man 'a john,' we do not mean it
as a title of honour."  the title of "sir" was usually given by
courtesy to priests.

3. attamed: commenced, broached. compare french, "entamer",
to cut the first piece off a joint; thence to begin.

21. mulier est hominis confusio:  this line is taken from the
same fabulous conference between the emperor adrian and the
philosopher secundus, whence chaucer derived some of the
arguments in praise of poverty employed in the wife of bath's
tale proper. see note 14 to the wife of bath's tale.  the
passage transferred to the text is the commencement of a
description of woman. "quid est mulier? hominis confusio," &c.

not the same thing of which it is shadowed: right so fareth the
pain of hell; it is like death, for the horrible anguish; and why?
for it paineth them ever as though they should die anon; but
certes they shall not die. for, as saith saint gregory, "to
wretched caitiffs shall be given death without death, and end
without end, and default without failing; for their death shall
always live, and their end shall evermore begin, and their default
shall never fail." and therefore saith saint john the evangelist,
"they shall follow death, and they shall not find him, and they
shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them." and eke job
saith, that in hell is no order of rule. and albeit that god hath
created all things in right order, and nothing without order, but
all things be ordered and numbered, yet nevertheless they that
be damned be not in order, nor hold no order. for the earth
shall bear them no fruit (for, as the prophet david saith, "god

e of chaucer's poetry, had never been printed
before the year 1597, when it was included in the edition of
speght. before that date, indeed, a dream of chaucer had been
printed; but the poem so described was in reality "the book of
the duchess; or the death of blanche, duchess of lancaster" --
which is not included in the present edition. speght says that
"this dream, devised by chaucer, seemeth to be a covert report
of the marriage of john of gaunt, the king's son, with blanche,
the daughter of henry, duke of lancaster; who after long love
(during the time whereof the poet feigneth them to be dead)
were in the end, by consent of friends, happily married; figured
by a bird bringing in his bill an herb, which restored them to life
again. here also is showed chaucer's match with a certain
gentlewoman, who, although she was a stranger, was,
notwithstanding, so well liked and loved of the lady blanche
and her lord, as chaucer himself

also was, that gladly they
concluded a marriage between them." john of gaunt, at the age
of nineteen, and while yet earl of richmond, was married to the
lady blanche at reading in may 1359; chaucer, then a prisoner
in france, probably did not return to england till peace was
concluded in the following year; so that his marriage to philippa
roet, the sister of the duchess blanche's favourite attendant
katharine roet, could not have taken place till some time after
that of the duke. in the poem, it is represented to have
immediately followed; but no consequence n

eed be attached to
that statement. enough that it followed at no great interval of
time; and that the intimate relations which chaucer had already
begun to form with john of gaunt, might well warrant him in
writing this poem on the occasion of the duke's marriage, and
in weaving his own love-fortunes with those of the principal
figures. in the necessary abridgement of the poem for the
present edition, the subsidiary branch of the allegory, relating to
the poet's own love affair, has been so far as possible separated
from the main branch, which shadows forth the fortunes of john
and blanche. the poem, in full, contains, with an "envoy"
arbitrarily appended, 2233

notes to l'envoy of chaucer to bukton.


1. tyrwhitt, founding on the reference to the wife of bath,
places this among chaucer's latest compositions; and states that
one peter de bukton held the office of king's escheator for
yorkshire in 1397. in some of the old editions, the verses were
made the envoy to the book of the duchess blanche -- in very
bad taste, when we consider that the object of that poem was to
console john of gaunt under the loss of his wife.

marry than to burn."  1 cor. vii. 9
