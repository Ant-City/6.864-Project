â€”that model schoolboy, stephen said, would find hamletâ€™s musings about
the afterlife of his princely soul, the improbable, insignificant and
undramatic monologue, as shallow as platoâ€™s.

john eglinton, frowning, said, waxing wroth:

â€”upon my word it makes my blood boil to hear anyone compare aristotle
with plato.

â€”people do not know how dangerous lovesongs can be, the auric egg of

john eglinton looked in the tangled glowworm of his lamp.

â€”the world believes that shakespeare made a mistake, he said, and got
out of it as quickly and as best he could.

â€”bosh! stephen said rudely. a man of genius makes no mistakes. his
errors are volitional and are the portals of discovery.

portals of discovery opened to let in the quaker librarian,
softcreakfooted, bald, eared and assiduous.

â€”a shrew, john eglinton said shrewdly, is not a useful portal of
discovery, one should imagine. what useful discovery did socrates learn
from xanthippe?

â€”dialectic, stephen answered: and from his mother how to bring thoughts
into the world. what he learnt from his other wife myrto (absit nomen!),

enigmatic. we know nothing but that he lived and suffered. not even so
much. others abide our question. a shadow hangs over all the rest.

perhaps of our brilliancies of theorising. i hear that an actress played
hamlet for the fourhundredandeighth time last night in dublin. vining
