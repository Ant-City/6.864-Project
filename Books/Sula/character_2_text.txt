my my mymymy." when later that same year she
sent for a child who kept falling down off the porch across
the street, she said the same thing. somebody said, "but,
miss eva, you calls the other one dewey." "so? this here's
another one." when the third one was brought and eva said
"dewey" again, everybody thought she had simply run out
of names or that her faculties had finally softened. "how is
anybody going to tell them apart?" hannah asked her.
"what you need to tell them apart for? they's all deweys."
when hannah asked the question it didn't sound very
bright, because each dewey was markedly different from
the other two. dewey one was a deeply black boy with a
beautiful head and the golden eyes of chronic jaundice.
dewey two was light-skinned with freckles everywhere and
a head of tight red hair. dewey three was half mexican with
chocolate skin and black bangs. besides, they were one
and two years apart in age. it was eva saying things like,
"send one of them deweys out to get me some garr

et, if
they don't have garret, get buttercup," or, "tell them
deweys to cut out that noise," or, "come here, you dewey
you," and, "send me a dewey," that gave hannah's
question its weight. slowly each boy came out of whatever
cocoon he was in at the time his mother or somebody gave
him away, and accepted eva's view, becoming in fact as
well as in name a dewey--joining with the other two to
become a trinity with a plural name... inseparable, loving
nothing and no one but themselves. when the handle from
the icebox fell off, all the deweys got whipped, and in drye

ieving, for she had long ago given up
trying to fathom the ways of the colored people in town. so
when mrs. reed said that their names were dewey king,
that they were cousins, and all were six years old, the
teacher gave only a tiny sigh and wrote them in the record
book for the first grade. she too thought she would have no
problem distinguishing among them, because they looked
nothing alike, but like everyone else before her, she
gradually found that she could not tell one from the other.
the deweys would not allow it. they got all mixed up in her
head, and finally she could not literally believe her eyes.
they spoke with one voice, thought with one mind, and
maintained an annoying privacy. stouthearted, surly, and
wholly unpredictable, the deweys remained a mystery not
only during all of their lives in medallion but after as well.
the deweys came in 1921, but the year before eva had
given a small room off the kitchen to tar baby, a beautiful,
slight, quiet man who never spoke above a whis

. later he began to miss days at work
and frequently did not have his rent money. when he lost
his job altogether, he would go out in the morning, scrounge
around for money doing odd jobs, bumming or whatever,
and come home to drink. because he was no bother, ate
little, required nothing, and was a lover of cheap wine, no
one found him a nuisance. besides, he frequently went to
wednesday-night prayer meetings and sang with the
sweetest hill voice imaginable "in the sweet by-and-by."
he sent the deweys out for his liquor and spent most of his
time in a heap on the floor or sitting in a chair staring at the
wall. hannah worried about him a little, but only a very little.
for it soon became clear that he simply wanted a place to
die privately but not quite alone. no one thought of
suggesting to him that he pull himself together or see a
doctor or anything. even the women at prayer meeting who
cried when he sang "in the sweet by-and-by" never tried to
get him to participate in the church activit

ies. they just
listened to him sing, wept and thought very graphically of
their own imminent deaths. the people either accepted his
own evaluation of his life, or were indifferent to it. there
was, however, a measure of contempt in their indifference,
for they had little patience with people who took themselves
that seriously. seriously enough to try to die. and it was
natural that he, after all, became the first one to join
shadrack--tar baby and the deweys--on national suicide
day. under eva's distant eye, and prey to her
idiosyncrasies, her own children grew up stealthily: pearl
married at fourteen and moved to flint, michigan, from
where she posted frail letters to her mother with two dollars
folded into the writing paper. sad little nonsense letters
about minor troubles, her husband's job and who the
children favored. hannah married a laughing man named
rekus who died when their daughter sula was about three
years old, at which time hannah mov

stick about six inches long, lit it and threw it onto the bed
where the kerosene-soaked plum lay in snug delight.
quickly, as the _whoosh__ of flames engulfed him, she shut
the door and made her slow and painful journey back to the
top of the house. just as she got to the third landing she
could hear hannah and some child's voice. she swung
along, not even listening to the voices of alarm and the
cries of the deweys. by the time she got to her bed
someone was bounding up the stairs after her. hannah
opened the door. "plum! plum! he's burning, mamma! we
can't even open the door! mamma!" eva looked into
hannah's eyes. "is? my baby? burning?" the two women
did not speak, for the eyes of each were enough for the
other. then hannah closed hers and ran toward the voices
of neighbors calling for water.

sang the words like a small child saying a piece at easter,

basket on it; the bowl she tucked in the space between her
legs. eva, who was just sitting there fanning herself with the
cardboard fan from mr. hodges' funeral parlor, listened to
the silence that followed hannah's words, then said, "scat!"
to the deweys who were playing chain gang near the
window. with the shoelaces of each of them tied to the
laces of the others, they stumbled and tumbled out of eva's
room. "now," eva looked up across from her wagon at her
daughter. "give me that again. flat out to fit my head." "i

moved snail-like down her thigh toward her stump, but
stopped short of it to realign a pleat. "no. i don't reckon i

tomatoes and hot bread, she thought, that would be enough
for everybody, especially since the deweys didn't eat
vegetables no how and eva never made them and tar
baby was living off air and music these days. she picked
up the basket and stood with it and the bowl of beans over
her mother. eva's face was still asking her last question.
hannah looked into her mother's eyes. "but what about
plum? what'd you kill plum for, mamma?" it was a

kentucky wonders and float them to the top of the bowl.
she swirled them about with her fingers, poured the water
off and repeated the process. each time the green tubes
rose to the surface she felt elated and collected whole
handfuls at a time to drop in twos and threes back into the
water. through the window over the sink she could see the
deweys still playing chain gang; their ankles bound one to
the other, they tumbled, struggled back to their feet and
tried to walk single file. hens strutted by with one
suspicious eye on the deweys, another on the brick
fireplace where sheets and mason jars were boiled. only
the deweys could play in this heat. hannah put the kentucky
wonders over the fire and, struck by a sudden sleepiness,
she went off to lie down in the front room. it was even hotter
there, for the windows were shut to keep out the

buckland reed came by. later she would remember it as
the third strange thing. she had thought it odd even then,
but the red in the dream confused her. but she wasn't
certain that it was third or not because sula was acting up,
fretting the deweys and meddling the newly married couple.
because she was thirteen, everybody supposed her nature
was coming down, but it was hard to put up with her sulking
and irritation. the birthmark over her eye was getting
darker and looked more and more like a stem and rose.
she was dropping things and eating food that belonged to
the newly married couple and started in to worrying
everybody that the deweys needed a bath and she was
going to give it to them. the deweys, who went wild at the

left the house in search of music. hannah ignored them and
kept on bringing mason jars out of the cellar and washing
them. eva banged on the floor with her stick but nobody
came. by noon it was quiet. the deweys had escaped,
sula was either in her room or gone off somewhere. the
newly married couple, energized by their morning
lovemaking, had gone to look for a day's work happily
certain that they would find none. the air all over the bottom
got heavy with peeled fruit and boiling vegetables. fresh
corn, tomatoes, string beans, melon rinds. the women, the
children and the old men who had no jobs were putting up

lay there on the wooden sidewalk planks, twitching lightly
among the smashed tomatoes, her face a mask of agony
so intense that for years the people who gathered 'round
would shake their heads at the recollection of it. somebody
covered her legs with a shirt. a woman unwrapped her
head rag and placed it on hannah's shoulder. somebody
else ran to dick's fresh food and sundries to call the
ambulance. the rest stood there as helpless as sunflowers
leaning on a fence. the deweys came and stepped in the
tomatoes, their eyes raked with wonder. two cats sidled
through the legs of the crowd, sniffing the burned flesh. the
vomiting of a young girl finally broke the profound silence
and caused the women to talk to each other and to god. in
the midst of calling jesus they heard the hollow clang of the
ambulance bell struggling up the hill, but not the "help me,
ya'll" that the dying woman whispered. then somebody

handled most of the details very efficiently, capitalizing on
the fact that most people were anxious to please her since
she had lost her mamma only a few years back and they
still remembered the agony in hannah's face and the blood
on eva's. so they danced up in the bottom on the second
saturday in june, danced at the wedding where everybody
realized for the first time that except for their magnificent
teeth, the deweys would never grow. they had been fortyeight
inches tall for years now, and while their size was
unusual it was not unheard of. the realization was based on
the fact that they remained boys in mind. mischievous,
cunning, private and completely unhousebroken, their
games and interests had not changed since hannah had
them all put into the first grade together. nel and jude, who
had been the stars all during the wedding, were forgotten
finally as the reception melted into a dance, a feed, a

looking at his knees glistening just at the surface of the

"airplanes." "lindbergh know about you?" "go 'way." she
went and waited for him in eva's high bed, her head turned
to the boarded-up window. she was smiling, thinking how
like jude's was his craving to do the white man's work,
when two deweys came in with their beautiful teeth and
said, "we sick." sula turned her head slowly and
murmured, "get well." "we need some medicine." "look in
the bathroom." "ajax in there." "then wait." "we sick now."
sula leaned over the bed, picked up a shoe and threw it at
them. "cocksucker!" they screamed, and she leaped out of
the bed naked as a yard dog. she caught the redheaded

somebody is just like being mean to somebody. risky. you
don't get nothing for it." nel took her hands from the brass
railing. she was annoyed with herself. finally when she had
gotten the nerve to ask the question, the right question, it
made no difference. sula couldn't give her a sensible
answer because she didn't know. would be, in fact, the last
to know. talking to her about right and wrong was like
talking to the deweys. she picked at the fringe on sula's
bedspread and said softly, "we were friends." "oh, yes.
good friends," sula said. "and you didn't love me enough
to leave him alone. to let him love me. you had to take him
away." "what you mean take him away? i didn't kill him, i

"what you mean?" "imean maybe it wasn't you. maybe it
was me." nel took two steps out the door and closed it
behind her. she walked down the hall and down the four
flights of steps. the house billowed around her light then
dark, full of presences without sounds. the deweys, tar
baby, the newly married couples, mr. buckland reed,
patsy, valentine, and the beautiful hannah peace. where
were they? eva out at the old folks' home, the deweys living
anywhere, tar baby steeped in wine, and sula upstairs in
eva's bed with a boarded-up window and an empty
pocketbook on the dresser. * * * when nel closed the door,

so much; maybe the contrast between shadrack's doomy,

his bell and holding fast to his rope. the deweys with their
