Judge Stevens - 
                A mayor of Jefferson. Eighty years old, Judge Stevens attempts to delicately handle the complaints about the smell emanating from the Grierson property. To be respectful of Emily's pride and former position in the community, he and the aldermen decide to sprinkle lime on the property in the middle of the night.
