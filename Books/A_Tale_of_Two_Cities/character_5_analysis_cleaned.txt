[CHARACTER]
possessing a remorseless bloodlust, [CHARACTER] embodies
the chaos of the french revolution. the initial chapters of the
novel find her sitting quietly and knitting in the wine shop. however,
her apparent passivity belies her relentless thirst for vengeance.
with her stitches, she secretly knits a register of the names of
the revolution's intended victims. as the revolution breaks into
full force, [CHARACTER] reveals her true viciousness. she turns
on lucie in particular, and, as violence sweeps paris, she invades
lucie's physical and psychological space. she effects this invasion
first by committing the faces of lucie and her family to memory,
in order to add them to her mental "register" of those slated to
die in the revolution. later, she bursts into the young woman's
apartment in an attempt to catch lucie mourning darnay's imminent
execution.
dickens notes that [CHARACTER]'s hatefulness does not reflect
any inherent flaw, but rather results from the oppression and personal
tragedy that she has suffered at the hands of the aristocracy, specifically
the evremondes, to whom darnay is related by blood, and lucie by
marriage. however, the author refrains from justifying [CHARACTER]'s
policy of retributive justice. for just as the aristocracy's oppression
has made an oppressor of [CHARACTER] herself, so will her oppression,
in turn, make oppressors of her victims. [CHARACTER]'s death
by a bullet from her own gun--she dies in a scuffle with miss pross--symbolizes
dickens's belief that the sort of vengeful attitude embodied by
[CHARACTER] ultimately proves a self-damning one.
