"not to speak of," he said, and the sweat big as marbles running down his 
face and his face about the color of blotting paper. 
"course not," i said. "about next summer you can hobble around fine on 
this leg. then it wont bother you, not to speak of ... if you had anything you 
could call luck, you might say it was lucky this is the same leg you broke

it happened i am back of the prescription case, pouring up some chocolate sauce, 

when jody comes back and says, "say, skeet, there's a woman up front that wants 

to see the doctor and when i said what doctor you want to see, she said she 

wants to see the doctor that works here and when i said there aint any doctor 

works here, she just stood there, looking back this way." 

"what kind of a woman is it?" i says. "tell her to go upstairs to alford's 

office." 

"country woman," he says.
