my  mother  could  have  learned  it  from  a  book,  
 know  that  

maybe  from  her  mother.
households everywhere didn't use this particular roach-
ridding  method?  i stood  up and walked  over  to may.  i 
felt a trembly feeling at the back of my knees. i put my 
hand on her shoulder. okay, i thought, here goes. i said, 
"may, did you ever know a deborah? deborah fontanel? 
a white woman from virginia? it would have been a long 
time ago." 

there wasn't a trace of cunning in may, and you 
could depend on her not to overthink her answers. she 
didn't look up, didn't pause, just said, "oh, yes, deborah 
fontanel. she stayed out there in the honey house. she 
was the sweetest thing." 

and there it was. there it all was. 
for a moment i felt light-headed. i had to reach 
for the countertop to steady myself. down on the floor

ooked half alive. 
i  had  a  million  more  questions,  but  may  had 
started humming "oh! susanna." she set down the box 
of  crackers  and  got  up  slowly,  starting  to  sniffle. 
something about deborah fontanel had set her off. 

"i think i'll go out to the wall for a little while," 
she  said.  and  that's  how  she  left  me,  standing  in  the 
kitchen, hot and breathless, the world tilted under me.

walking  to  the  honey  house,  i  concentrated  on 
my  feet  touching  down  on  the  hard-caked  dirt  in  the 
driveway,  the  exposed  tree  roots,  fresh-watered  grass, 
how the earth felt beneath me, solid, alive, ancient, right 
there every time my foot came down. there and there

and there, always there. the things a mother should be. 
oh, yes, deborah fontanel. 

she  stayed  out  there  in  the  honey  house.  she 
was the sweetest thing. in the honey house i sat on the 
cot  with  my  knees  drawn  up,  hugging  them  with  my 
arms and making a shelf for the side of my face to rest 
on.  i looked at  the floor and the  walls with brand  new 
eyes. my mother had walked about in this room.

it  grew  so  quiet.  how  could  i  be  mad  at  her?  i  
had done  the same  thing.  held  back  what  i knew,  and 
my reasons were not the least bit noble like hers. 

"may told me," i said. 
"may told you what?" 
"i saw her making a trail of graham crackers and 
marshmallows for the roaches to follow. my father told 
me  once  that  my  mother  used  to  do  the  same  thing.  i  
figured she'd learned it from may. so i asked her, "did 
you ever know a deborah fontanel?"' and she said yes 
she did, that deborah had stayed in the honey house." 

august  shook  her  head.  "goodness,  there's  so 
much to tell. you remember how i told you i worked as a

my  mother's  house.  it  seemed  odd  to  think  of 
her  with  a  roof  over  her  head.  a  person  who  lay  on  a  
bed, ate food at a table, took baths in a tub.
