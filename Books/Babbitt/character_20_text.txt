nd quantitatively produced
alarm-clocks, with all modern attachments, including cathedral chime,
intermittent alarm, and a phosphorescent dial. babbitt was proud
of being awakened by such a rich device. socially it was almost as
creditable as buying expensive cord tires.

he sulkily admitted now that there was no more escape, but he lay and
detested the grind of the real-estate business, and disliked his family,
and disliked himself for disliking them. the evening before, he had
played poker at vergil gunch's till midnight, and after such holidays
he was irritable before breakfast. it may have been the tremendous
home-brewed beer of the prohibition-era and the cigars to which that
beer enticed him; it may have been resentment of return from this fine,
bold man-world to a restricted region of wives and stenographers, and of
suggestions not to smoke so much.

the lobby, with its thick pillars of porous caen stone, its pointed
vaulting, and a brown glazed-tile floor like well-baked bread-crust, is
a combination of cathedral-crypt and rathskellar. the members rush into
the lobby as though they were shopping and hadn't much time for it. thus
did babbitt enter, and to the group standing by the cigar-counter he
whooped, "how's the boys? how's the boys? well, well, fine day!"

jovially they whooped back--vergil gunch, the coal-dealer, sidney
finkelstein, the ladies'-ready-to-wear buyer for parcher & stein's
department-store, and professor joseph k. pumphrey, owner of the riteway
business college and instructor in public speaking, business english,
scenario writing, and commercial law. though babbitt admired this
savant, and appreciated sidney finkelstein as "a mighty smart buyer
and a good liberal spender," it was to vergil gunch that he turned with
enthusiasm. mr. gunch was president of the boosters' club,

'n a hundred miles on sunday and, uh--oh, i don't really think you
got stuck, george. in the long run, the best is, you might say, it's
unquestionably the cheapest."

"that's right," said vergil gunch. "that's the way i look at it. if a
fellow is keyed up to what you might call intensive living, the way you
get it here in zenith--all the hustle and mental activity that's going
on with a bunch of live-wires like the boosters and here in the z.a.c.,
why, he's got to save his nerves by having the best."

babbitt nodded his head at every fifth word in the roaring rhythm; and
by the conclusion, in gunch's renowned humorous vein, he was enchanted:

"still, at that, george, don't know's you can aff

ze." he perceived
that he had gifts of profligacy which had been neglected.

by the time the guests had come, including the inevitable late couple
for whom the others waited with painful amiability, a great gray
emptiness had replaced the purple swirling in babbitt's head, and he had
to force the tumultuous greetings suitable to a host on floral heights.

the guests were howard littlefield, the doctor of philosophy who
furnished publicity and comforting economics to the street traction
company; vergil gunch, the coal-dealer, equally powerful in the elks
and in the boosters' club; eddie swanson the agent for the javelin motor
car, who lived across the street; and orville jones, owner of the lily
white laundry, which justly announced itself "the biggest, busiest,
bulliest cleanerie shoppe in zenith." but, naturally, the most
distinguished of all was t. cholmondeley frink, who was not only the
author of "poemulations," which, syndicated daily in sixty-seven leading
newspapers, gave him one of the lar

with them were six wives, more or less--it was hard to tell, so early in
the evening, as at first glance they all looked alike, and as they all
said, "oh, isn't this nice!" in the same tone of determined liveliness.
to the eye, the men were less similar: littlefield, a hedge-scholar,
tall and horse-faced; chum frink, a trifle of a man with soft and
mouse-like hair, advertising his profession as poet by a silk cord on
his eye-glasses; vergil gunch, broad, with coarse black hair en brosse;
eddie swanson, a bald and bouncing young man who showed his taste
for elegance by an evening waistcoat of figured black silk with glass
buttons; orville jones, a steady-looking, stubby, not very memorable
person, with a hemp-colored toothbrush mustache. yet they were all so
well fed and clean, they all shouted "'evenin', georgie!" with such
robustness, that they seemed to be cousins, and the strange thing is
that the longer one knew the women, the less

 at me, georgie--"

"you got a little dividend coming," said babbitt to each of them, and
each intoned, "squeeze it, georgie, squeeze it!"

when, beyond hope, the pitcher was empty, they stood and talked about
prohibition. the men leaned back on their heels, put their hands in
their trousers-pockets, and proclaimed their views with the booming
profundity of a prosperous male repeating a thoroughly hackneyed
statement about a matter of which he knows nothing whatever.

"now, i'll tell you," said vergil gunch; "way i figure it is this, and
i can speak by the book, because i've talked to a lot of doctors and
fellows that ought to know, and the way i see it is that it's a good
thing to get rid of the saloon, but they ought to let a fellow have beer
and light wines."

howard littlefield observed, "what isn't generally realized is that it's
a dangerous prop'sition to invade the rights of personal liberty.
now, take this for instance: the king of--bavaria? i think it was
bavaria--yes, bavaria, it was--in

ock. the peasantry had
stood for overtaxation without the slightest complaint, but when this
proclamation came out, they rebelled. or it may have been saxony. but
it just goes to show the dangers of invading the rights of personal
liberty."

"that's it--no one got a right to invade personal liberty," said orville
jones.

"just the same, you don't want to forget prohibition is a mighty good
thing for the working-classes. keeps 'em from wasting their money and
lowering their productiveness," said vergil gunch.

"yes, that's so. but the trouble is the manner of enforcement," insisted
howard littlefield. "congress didn't understand the right system. now,
if i'd been running the thing, i'd have arranged it so that the drinker
himself was licensed, and then we could have taken care of the shiftless
workman--kept him from drinking--and yet not 've interfered with the
rights--with the personal liberty--of fellows like ourselves."

they bobbed their heads, looked admiringly at one another, and stated,
"tha

y, lemme

the shells from peas, and pour six gallons of water on a bushel of
shells and boil the mixture till--"

mrs. babbitt turned toward them with yearning sweetness; frink hastened
to finish even his best beer-recipe; and she said gaily, "dinner is
served."

there was a good deal of friendly argument among the men as to which
should go in last, and while they were crossing the hall from the
living-room to the dining-room vergil gunch made them laugh by
thundering, "if i can't sit next to myra babbitt and hold her hand under
the table, i won't play--i'm goin' home." in the dining-room they stood
embarrassed while mrs. babbitt fluttered, "now, let me see--oh, i was
going to have some nice hand-painted place-cards for you but--oh, let me
see; mr. frink, you sit there."

the dinner was in the best style of women's-magazine art, whereby the
salad was served in hollowed apples, and everything but the invincible

it on principle, but i don't propose to have
anybody telling me what i got to think and do. no american 'll ever
stand for that!"

but they all felt that it was rather in bad taste for orville jones--and
he not recognized as one of the wits of the occasion anyway--to say, "in
fact, the whole thing about prohibition is this: it isn't the initial
cost, it's the humidity."

not till the one required topic had been dealt with did the conversation
become general.

it was often and admiringly said of vergil gunch, "gee, that fellow can
get away with murder! why, he can pull a raw one in mixed company and
all the ladies 'll laugh their heads off, but me, gosh, if i crack
anything that's just the least bit off color i get the razz for fair!"
now gunch delighted them by crying to mrs. eddie swanson, youngest
of the women, "louetta! i managed to pinch eddie's doorkey out of his
pocket, and what say you and me sneak across the street when the folks
aren't looking? got something," with a gorgeous leer, "awful

 those main street burgs are slow, and you
fellows can't hardly appreciate what it means to be here with a bunch of
live ones!"

"you bet!" exulted orville jones. "they're the best folks on earth,
those small-town folks, but, oh, mama! what conversation! why, say,
they can't talk about anything but the weather and the ne-oo ford, by
heckalorum!"

"that's right. they all talk about just the same things," said eddie
swanson.

"don't they, though! they just say the same things over and over," said
vergil gunch.

"yes, it's really remarkable. they seem to lack all power of looking at
things impersonally. they simply go over and over the same talk about
fords and the weather and so on." said howard littlefield.

"still, at that, you can't blame 'em. they haven't got any intellectual
stimulus such as you get up here in the city," said chum frink.

"gosh, that's right," said babbitt. "i don't want you highbrows to get
stuck on yourselves but i must say it keeps a fellow right up on his
toes to sit in wit

us!"

chum frink agreed, "that's so. but what i mind is their lack of culture
and appreciation of the beautiful--if you'll excuse me for being
highbrow. now, i like to give a high-class lecture, and read some of my
best poetry--not the newspaper stuff but the magazine things. but say,
when i get out in the tall grass, there's nothing will take but a lot of
cheesy old stories and slang and junk that if any of us were to indulge
in it here, he'd get the gate so fast it would make his head swim."

vergil gunch summed it up: "fact is, we're mighty lucky to be living
among a bunch of city-folks, that recognize artistic things and
business-punch equally. we'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some
main street burg and tried to wise up the old codgers to the kind of
life we're used to here. but, by golly, there's this you got to say for
'em: every small american town is trying to get population and modern
ideals. and darn if a lot of 'em don't put it across! somebody starts

 bored. it was ecstasy to escape from the table,
from the torture of a straight chair, and loll on the davenport in the
living-room.

the others, from their fitful unconvincing talk, their expressions of
being slowly and painfully smothered, seemed to be suffering from the
toil of social life and the horror of good food as much as himself. all
of them accepted with relief the suggestion of bridge.

babbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled. he won at bridge.
he was again able to endure vergil gunch's inexorable heartiness. but
he pictured loafing with paul riesling beside a lake in maine. it was as
overpowering and imaginative as homesickness. he had never seen maine,
yet he beheld the shrouded mountains, the tranquil lake of evening.
"that boy paul's worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together," he
muttered; and, "i'd like to get away from--everything."

even louetta swanson did not rouse him.

mrs. swanson was pretty and pliant. babbitt was not an analyst of women,
except as to t

tt had a different worry. "suppose chum frink was really one of
these spiritualists! chum had, for a literary fellow, always seemed to
be a regular guy; he belonged to the chatham road presbyterian church
and went to the boosters' lunches and liked cigars and motors and racy
stories. but suppose that secretly--after all, you never could tell
about these darn highbrows; and to be an out-and-out spiritualist would
be almost like being a socialist!"

no one could long be serious in the presence of vergil gunch. "ask dant'
how jack shakespeare and old verg'--the guy they named after me--are
gettin' along, and don't they wish they could get into the movie game!"
he blared, and instantly all was mirth. mrs. jones shrieked, and eddie
swanson desired to know whether dante didn't catch cold with nothing on
but his wreath.

the pleased dante made humble answer.

but babbitt--the curst discontent was torturing him again, and heavily,
in the impersonal darkness, he pondered, "i don't--we're all so flip and

babbitt promised to become a recognized orator. he entertained a smoker
of the men's club of the chatham road presbyterian church with irish,
jewish, and chinese dialect stories.

but in nothing was he more clearly revealed as the prominent citizen
than in his lecture on "brass tacks facts on real estate," as delivered
before the class in sales methods at the zenith y.m.c.a.

the advocate-times reported the lecture so fully that vergil gunch said
to babbitt, "you're getting to be one of the classiest spellbinders in
town. seems 's if i couldn't pick up a paper without reading about your
well-known eloquence. all this guff ought to bring a lot of business
into your office. good work! keep it up!"

"go on, quit your kidding," said babbitt feebly, but at this tribute
from gunch, himself a man of no mean oratorical fame, he expanded with
delight and wondered how, before his vacation, he could have questioned

altogether perfect; the chairs were gently supercilious.

eathorne's inquiries as to the healths of mrs. babbitt, miss babbitt,
and the other children were softly paternal, but babbitt had nothing
with which to answer him. it was indecent to think of using the "how's
tricks, ole socks?" which gratified vergil gunch and frink and howard
littlefield--men who till now had seemed successful and urbane. babbitt
and frink sat politely, and politely did eathorne observe, opening his
thin lips just wide enough to dismiss the words, "gentlemen, before we
begin our conference--you may have felt the cold in coming here--so good
of you to save an old man the journey--shall we perhaps have a whisky
toddy?"

so well trained was babbitt in all the conversation that befits a good

the air was shrewd, the snow was deep in uncleared alleys, and beyond
the city, babbitt knew, were hillsides of snow-drift among wintry oaks,
and the curving ice-enchanted river.

he loved his city with passionate wonder. he lost the accumulated
weariness of business--worry and expansive oratory; he felt young and
potential. he was ambitious. it was not enough to be a vergil gunch,
an orville jones. no. "they're bully fellows, simply lovely, but they
haven't got any finesse." no. he was going to be an eathorne; delicately
rigorous, coldly powerful.

he had eaten a questionable clam. for two days he was languorous and

the shadow of the draw-rope was dense black, in an enticing ripple on

beheld, and half admitted that he beheld, his way of life as incredibly
mechanical. mechanical business--a brisk selling of badly built houses.
mechanical religion--a dry, hard church, shut off from the real life
of the streets, inhumanly respectable as a top-hat. mechanical golf and

ended the movies, and the days were blank of face
and silent.

in june, mrs. babbitt and tinka went east, to stay with relatives, and
babbitt was free to do--he was not quite sure what.

all day long after their departure he thought of the emancipated house
in which he could, if he desired, go mad and curse the gods without
having to keep up a husbandly front. he considered, "i could have a
reg'lar party to-night; stay out till two and not do any explaining
afterwards. cheers!" he telephoned to vergil gunch, to eddie swanson.
both of them were engaged for the evening, and suddenly he was bored by
having to take so much trouble to be riotous.

he was silent at dinner, unusually kindly to ted and verona, hesitating
but not disapproving when verona stated her opinion of kenneth escott's
opinion of dr. john jennison drew's opinion of the opinions of the
evolutionists. ted was working in a garage through the summer vacation,
and he related his daily triumphs: how he had found a cracked ball-race,

babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with joe paradise in the
wilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite
sure, on the night before he reached zenith, that neither he nor the
city would be the same again, ten days after his return he could not
believe that he had ever been away. nor was it at all evident to his
acquaintances that there was a new george f. babbitt, save that he was
more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the athletic club, and
once, when vergil gunch observed that seneca doane ought to be hanged,
babbitt snorted, "oh, rats, he's not so bad."

at home he grunted "eh?" across the newspaper to his commentatory wife,
and was delighted by tinka's new red tam o'shanter, and announced, "no
class to that corrugated iron garage. have to build me a nice frame
one."

verona and kenneth escott appeared really to be engaged. in
his newspaper escott had conducted a pure-food crusade against

"they got just as much right to march as anybody else! they own the
streets as much as clarence drum or the american legion does!" babbitt
grumbled. "of course, they're--they're a bad element, but--oh, rats!"

at the athletic club, babbitt was silent during lunch, while the others
fretted, "i don't know what the world's coming to," or solaced their
spirits with "kidding."

captain clarence drum came swinging by, splendid in khaki.

"how's it going, captain?" inquired vergil gunch.

"oh, we got 'em stopped. we worked 'em off on side streets and separated
'em and they got discouraged and went home."

"fine work. no violence."

"fine work nothing!" groaned mr. drum. "if i had my way, there'd be a
whole lot of violence, and i'd start it, and then the whole thing would
be over. i don't believe in standing back and wet-nursing these fellows
and letting the disturbances drag on. i tell you these strikers are

drum complained, "oh, you didn't, eh? well, maybe you'd like to take
charge of the strike! just tell colonel nixon what innocents the
strikers are! he'd be glad to hear about it!" drum strode on, while all
the table stared at babbitt.

"what's the idea? do you want us to give those hell-hounds love and
kisses, or what?" said orville jones.

"do you defend a lot of hoodlums that are trying to take the bread and
butter away from our families?" raged professor pumphrey.

vergil gunch intimidatingly said nothing. he put on sternness like a
mask; his jaw was hard, his bristly short hair seemed cruel, his silence
was a ferocious thunder. while the others assured babbitt that they must
have misunderstood him, gunch looked as though he had understood only
too well. like a robed judge he listened to babbitt's stammering:

the speaker must be the notorious freelance preacher, beecher ingram,

hair, weather-beaten cheeks, and worried eyes. he was pleading:

"--if those telephone girls can hold out, living on one meal a day,
doing their own washing, starving and smiling, you big hulking men ought

babbitt saw that from the sidewalk vergil gunch was watching him. in
vague disquiet he started the car and mechanically drove on, while
gunch's hostile eyes seemed to follow him all the way.

the assurance of tanis judique's friendship fortified babbitt's
self-approval. at the athletic club he became experimental. though
vergil gunch was silent, the others at the roughnecks' table came to
accept babbitt as having, for no visible reason, "turned crank." they
argued windily with him, and he was cocky, and enjoyed the spectacle
of his interesting martyrdom. he even praised seneca doane. professor
pumphrey said that was carrying a joke too far; but babbitt argued, "no!
fact! i tell you he's got one of the keenest intellects in the country.
why, lord wycombe said that--"

"oh, who the hell is lord wycombe? what you always luggin

"george ordered him from sears-roebuck. you can get those english

finkelstein.

"that's all right now! lord wycombe, he's one of the biggest intellects
in english political life. as i was saying: of course i'm conservative
myself, but i appreciate a guy like senny doane because--"

vergil gunch interrupted harshly, "i wonder if you are so conservative?
i find i can manage to run my own business without any skunks and reds
like doane in it!"

the grimness of gunch's voice, the hardness of his jaw, disconcerted
babbitt, but he recovered and went on till they looked bored, then
irritated, then as doubtful as gunch.

his arms yearned for her. "i've found her! i've dreamed of her all these

that, since he was making love to every woman possible, tanis was no
longer his one pure star, and he wondered whether she had ever been
anything more to him than a woman. and if bemis had spoken to him, were
other people talking about him? he suspiciously watched the men at the
athletic club that noon. it seemed to him that they were uneasy. they
had been talking about him then? he was angry. he became belligerent.
he not only defended seneca doane but even made fun of the y. m. c. a,
vergil gunch was rather brief in his answers.

afterward babbitt was not angry. he was afraid. he did not go to the
next lunch of the boosters' club but hid in a cheap restaurant, and,
while he munched a ham-and-egg sandwich and sipped coffee from a cup on
the arm of his chair, he worried.

four days later, when the bunch were having one of their best parties,
babbitt drove them to the skating-rink which had been laid out on the

gowns. perhaps she was too smart. every one in the gold and oak
restaurant of the thornleigh was staring at her as babbitt followed her
to a table. he uneasily hoped that the head-waiter would give them a
discreet place behind a pillar, but they were stationed on the center
aisle. tanis seemed not to notice her admirers; she smiled at babbitt
with a lavish "oh, isn't this nice! what a peppy-looking orchestra!"
babbitt had difficulty in being lavish in return, for two tables away he
saw vergil gunch. all through the meal gunch watched them, while babbitt
watched himself being watched and lugubriously tried to keep from
spoiling tanis's gaiety. "i felt like a spree to-day," she rippled. "i
love the thornleigh, don't you? it's so live and yet so--so refined."

he made talk about the thornleigh, the service, the food, the people he
recognized in the restaurant, all but vergil gunch. there did not

fluttering jests; he agreed

 with her that minnie sonntag was "so hard to
get along with," and young pete "such a silly lazy kid, really just no
good at all." but he himself had nothing to say. he considered telling
her his worries about gunch, but--"oh, gosh, it was too much work to go
into the whole thing and explain about verg and everything."

he was relieved when he put tanis on a trolley; he was cheerful in the
familiar simplicities of his office.

at four o'clock vergil gunch called on him.

babbitt was agitated, but gunch began in a friendly way:

"how's the boy? say, some of us are getting up a scheme we'd kind of
like to have you come in on."

"fine, verg. shoot."

"you know during the war we had the undesirable element, the reds and
walking delegates and just the plain common grouches, dead to rights,
and so did we for quite a while after the war, but folks forget about
the danger and that gives these cranks a chance to begin working
underground again, especiall

dilling the surgeon, charles mckelvey the contractor, and, most
dismaying of all, the white-bearded colonel rutherford snow, owner of
the advocate-times. in their whelming presence babbitt felt small and
insignificant.

"well, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'n i do for you?" he
babbled.

they neither sat nor offered observations on the weather.

"babbitt," said colonel snow, "we've come from the good citizens'
league. we've decided we want you to join. vergil gunch says you don't
care to, but i think we can show you a new light. the league is going to
combine with the chamber of commerce in a campaign for the open shop, so
it's time for you to put your name down."

in his embarrassment babbitt could not recall his reasons for not
wishing to join the league, if indeed he had ever definitely known them,
but he was passionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the
thought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even
these princes

too late. i'm not sure we'll want you then.
better think quick--better think quick!"

the three vigilantes, formidable in their righteousness, stared at him
in a taut silence. babbitt waited through. he thought nothing at all,
he merely waited, while in his echoing head buzzed, "i don't want to
join--i don't want to join--i don't want to."

"all right. sorry for you!" said colonel snow, and the three men
abruptly turned their beefy backs.

as babbitt went out to his car that evening he saw vergil gunch coming
down the block. he raised his hand in salutation, but gunch ignored it
and crossed the street. he was certain that gunch had seen him. he drove
home in sharp discomfort.

his wife attacked at once: "georgie dear, muriel frink was in this
afternoon, and she says that chum says the committee of this good
citizens' league especially asked you to join and you wouldn't. don't
you think it would be better? you know all the nicest people belong, and
the league stands for--"

"i know what the le

"now, george, you're talking exactly like the german furnace-man."

"oh, i am, am i! then, i won't talk at all!"

he longed, that evening, to see tanis judique, to be strengthened by
her sympathy. when all the family were up-stairs he got as far as
telephoning to her apartment-house, but he was agitated about it and
when the janitor answered he blurted, "nev' mind--i'll call later," and
hung up the receiver.

if babbitt had not been certain about vergil gunch's avoiding him, there
could be little doubt about william washington eathorne, next morning.
when babbitt was driving down to the office he overtook eathorne's car,
with the great banker sitting in anemic solemnity behind his chauffeur.
babbitt waved and cried, "mornin'!" eathorne looked at him deliberately,
hesitated, and gave him a nod more contemptuous than a direct cut.

babbitt's partner and father-in-law came in at ten:

"george, what's this i hear about some song and dance you gave colon

all his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. at the
athletic club they asked after her daily. club members whose names he
did not know stopped him to inquire, "how's your good lady getting on?"
babbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich
warm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.

one noon vergil gunch suggested, "you planning to be at the hospital
about six? the wife and i thought we'd drop in." they did drop in. gunch
was so humorous that mrs. babbitt said he must "stop making her laugh
because honestly it was hurting her incision." as they passed down the
hall gunch demanded amiably, "george, old scout, you were soreheaded
about something, here a while back. i don't know why, and it's none of
my business. but you seem to be feeling all hunky-dory again, and why
don't you come join us in th
