how vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if we can avoid it;
all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our prayers
and commit ourselves to uncertainties. so thoroughly and sincerely are
we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility
of change. this is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as
there can be drawn radii from one centre. all change is a miracle to
contemplate; but it is a miracle which is taking place every instant.
confucius said, "to know that we know what we know, and that we do not
know what we do not know, that is true knowledge." when one man has
reduced a fact of the imagination to be a fact to his understanding, i
foresee that all men at length establish their lives on that basis.

let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which
i have referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be
troubled, or at least careful. it would be some advantage to live
a primitive and frontie

that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their
hearts, and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer
sacrifices and oblations to their ancestors. it is an ocean of subtile
intelligences. they are everywhere, above us, on our left, on our right;
they environ us on all sides."

we are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting
to me. can we not do without the society of our gossips a little while
under these circumstances--have our own thoughts to cheer us? confucius
says truly, "virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan; it must of
necessity have neighbors."

with thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. by a
conscious effort of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their
consequences; and all things, good and bad, go by us like a torrent. we
are not wholly involved in nature. i may be either the driftwood in the
stream, or indra in the sky looking down on it. i _may_ be affected by a

akes it impossible for a man to live honestly,
and at the same time comfortably in outward respects. it will not be
worth the while to accumulate property; that would be sure to go again.
you must hire or squat somewhere, and raise but a small crop, and eat
that soon. you must live within yourself, and depend upon yourself
always tucked up and ready for a start, and not have many affairs. a
man may grow rich in turkey even, if he will be in all respects a
good subject of the turkish government. confucius said, "if a state is
governed by the principles of reason, poverty and misery are subjects
of shame; if a state is not governed by the principles of reason, riches
and honors are the subjects of shame." no: until i want the protection
of massachusetts to be extended to me in some distant southern port,
where my liberty is endangered, or until i am bent solely on building
up an estate at home by peaceful enterprise, i can afford to refuse
allegiance to massachusetts, and her right to my property
