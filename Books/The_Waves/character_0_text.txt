the sea blazed gold.

the light struck upon the trees in the garden, making one leaf transparent and then another. one bird chirped high up; there was a pause; another chirped lower down. the sun sharpened the walls of the house, and rested like the tip of a fan upon a white blind and made a blue finger-print of shadow under the leaf by the bedroom window. the blind stirred slightly, but all within was dim and unsubstantial. the birds sang their blank melody outside.







'i see a ring,' said bernard, 'hanging above me. it quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'

'i see a slab of pale yellow,' said susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'

'i hear a sound,' said rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'

'i see a globe,' said neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'

'i see a crimson tassel,' said jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'i hear something stamping,' said louis. 'a great beast's foot is chained. it stamps, and stamps,

 and stamps.'

'look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said bernard. 'it has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'

'the leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears,' said susan.

'a shadow falls on the path,' said louis, 'like an elbow bent.'

'islands of light are swimming on the grass,' said rhoda. 'they have fallen through the trees.'

'the birds' eyes are bright in the tunnels between the leaves,' said neville.

'the stalks are covered with harsh, short hairs,' said jinny, 'and drops of water have stuck to them.'

'a caterpillar is curled

in a green ring,' said susan, 'notched with blunt feet.'

'the grey-shelled snail draws across the path and flattens the blades behind him,' said rhoda.

'and burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said louis.

'stones are cold to my feet,' said neville. 'i feel each one, round or pointed, separately.'

'the back of my hand burns,' said jinny, 'but the palm is clammy and damp with dew.'

'now the cock crows like a spurt of hard, red water in the white tide,' said bernard.

'birds are singing up and down and in and out all round us,' said susan.

'the beast stamps; the elephant with its foot chained; the great brute on the beach stamps,' said louis.

'look at the house,' said jinny, 'with all its windows white with blinds.'

'cold water begins to run from the scullery tap,' said rhoda, 'over the mackerel in the bowl.'

'the walls are cracked with gold cracks,' said bernard, 'and there are blue, finger-shaped shadows of leaves beneath the windows.'

'the birds sang in chorus first,' said rhoda. 'now the scullery door is unbarred. off they fly. off they fly like a fling of seed. but one sings by the bedroom window alone.'

'bubbles form on the floor of the saucepan,' said jinny. 'then they rise, quicker and quicker, in a silver chain to the top.'

'now billy scrapes the fish-scales with a jagged knife on to a wooden board,' said neville.

'the dining-room window is dark blue now,' said bernard, 'and the air ripples above the chimneys.'

'a swallow is perched on the lightning-conductor,' said susan. 'and biddy has smacked down the bucket on the kitchen flags.'

'that is the first stroke of the church bell,' said louis. 'then the others follow; one, two; one, two; one, two.'

'look at the table-cloth, flying white along the table,' said rhoda. 'now there are rounds of white china, and silver streaks beside each plate.'

"is he dead?" i thought, and kissed you, with my heart jumping under my pink frock like the leaves, which go on moving, though there is nothing to move them. now i smell geraniums; i smell earth mould. i dance. i ripple. i am thrown over you like a net of light. i lie quiveri

'susan has passed us,' said bernard. 'she has passed the tool-house door with her handkerchief screwed into a ball. she was not crying, but her eyes, which are so beautiful, were narrow as cats' eyes before they spring. i shall follow her, neville. i shall go gently behind her, to be at hand, with my curiosity, to comfort her when she bursts out in a rage and thinks, "i am alone."

'i saw her kiss him,' said susan. 'i looked between the leaves and saw her. she danced in flecked with diamonds light as dust. and i am squat, bernard, i am short. i have eyes that look close to the ground and see insects in the grass. the yellow warmth in my side turned to stone when i saw jinny kiss louis. i shall eat grass and die in a ditch in the brown water where dead leaves have rotted.'

'i saw you go,' said bernard. 'as you passed the door of the tool-house i heard you cry "i am unhappy." i put down my knife. i was making boats out of firewood with neville. and my hair is untidy, because when mrs constable told me to brush it there w

'but when we sit together, close,' said bernard, 'we melt into each other with phrases. we are edged with mist. we make an unsubstantial territory.'

'where is bernard?' said neville. 'he has my knife. we were in the tool-shed making boats, and susan came past the door. and bernard dropped his boat and went after her taking my knife, the sharp one that cuts the keel. he is like a dangling wire, a broken bell-pull, always twangling. he is like the seaweed hung outside the window, damp now, now dry. he leaves me in the lurch; he follows susan; and if susan cries he will take my knife and tell her stories. the big blade is an emperor; the broken blade a negro. i

'there rhoda sits staring at the blackboard,' said louis, 'in the schoolroom, while we ramble off, picking here a bit of thyme, pinching here a leaf of southernwood while bernard tells a story. her shoulder-blades meet across her back like the wings of a small butterfly. and as she stares at the chalk figures, her mind lodges in those white circles, it steps through those white loops into emptiness, alone. they have no meaning for her. she has no answer for them. she has no body as the others have. and i, who speak with an australian accent, whose father is a banker in brisbane, do not fear her as i fear the others.'

'here is bernard,' said louis. 'he is composed; he is easy. he swings his bag as he walks. i will follow bernard, because he is not afraid. we are drawn through the booking-office on to the platform as a stream draws twigs and straws round the piers of a bridge. there is the very powerful, bottle-green engine without a neck, all back and thighs, breathing steam. the guard blows his whistle; the flag is dipped; without an effort, of its own momentum, like an avalanche started by a gentle push, we start forward.

'this is the final ceremony,' said bernard. this is the last of all our ceremonies. we are overcome by strange feelings. the guard holding his flag is about to blow his whistle; the train breathing steam in another moment is about to start. one wants to say something, to feel something, absolutely appropriate to the occasion. one's mind is primed; one's lips are pursed. and then a bee drifts in and hums round the flowers in the bouquet which lady hampton, the wife of the general, keeps smelling to show her appreciation of the compliment

'louis and neville,' said bernard, 'both sit silent. both are absorbed. both feel the presence of other people as a separating wall. but if i find myself in company with other people, words at once make smoke rings--see how phrases at once begin to wreathe off my lips. it seems that a match is set to a fire; something burns. an elderly and apparently prosperous man, a traveller, now gets in. and i at once wish to approach him; i instinctively dislike the sense of his presence, cold, unassimilated, among us. i do not believe in

'bernard has gone,' said neville, 'without a ticket. he has escaped us, making a phrase, waving his hand. he talked as easily to the horse-breeder or to the plumber as to us. the plumber accepted him with devotion. "if he had a son like that," he was thinking, "he would manage to send him to oxford." but what did bernard feel for the plumber? did he not only wish to continue the sequence of the story which he never stops telling himself? he began it when he rolled his bread into pellets as a child. one

'the complexity of things becomes more close,' said bernard, 'here at college, where the stir and pressure of life are so extreme, where the excitement of mere living becomes daily more urgent. every hour something new is unburied in the great bran pie. what am i? i ask. this? no, i am that. especially now, when i have left a room, and people talking, and the stone flags ring out with my solitary footsteps, and i behold the moon rising, sublimely, indifferently, over the ancient chapel--then it becomes clear that i am not one and simple, but complex and

'the truth is that i need the stimulus of other people. alone, over my dead fire, i tend to see the thin places in my own stories. the real novelist, the perfectly simple human being, could go on, indefinitely, imagining. he would not integrate, as i do. he would not have this devastating sense of grey ashes in a burnt-out grate. some blind flaps in my eyes. everything becomes impervious. i cease to invent.

'how strange,' said bernard, 'the willow looks seen together. i was byron, and the tree was byron's tree, lachrymose, down-showering, lamenting. now that we look at the tree together, it has a combined look, each branch distinct, and i will tell you what i feel, under the compulsion of your clarity.

 but now, how comfortable, how reassuring to feel that alien presence removed, that scrutiny darkened and hooded over! how grateful to draw the blinds, and admit no other presence; to feel returning from the dark corners in which they took refuge, those shabby inmates, those familiars, whom, with his superior force, he drove into hiding. the mocking, the observant spirits who, even in the crisis and stab of the moment, watched on my behalf now come flocking home again. with their addition, i am bernard; i am byron; i am this, that and the other. they darken the air and enrich me, as of old, with their antics, their comments, and cloud the fine simplicity of my moment of emotion. for i am more selves than neville thinks. we are not simple as our friends would have us to meet their needs. yet love is simple.

'how fair, how strange,' said bernard, 'glittering, many-pointed and many-domed london lies before me under mist. guarded by gasometers, by factory chimneys, she lies sleeping as we approach. she folds the ant-heap to her breast. all cries, all clamour, are softly enveloped in silence. not rome herself looks more majestic. but we are aimed at her. already her maternal somnolence is uneasy. ridges, fledged with houses rise from the mist. factories, cathedrals, glass domes, institutions and theatres erect themselves. the early train

'it is now five minutes to eight,' said neville. 'i have come early. i have taken my place at the table ten minutes before the time in order to taste every moment of anticipation; to see the door open and to say, "is it percival? no; it is not percival." there is a morbid pleasure in saying: "no, it is not percival." i have seen the door open and shut twenty times already; each time the suspense sharpens. this is the place to which he is coming. this is the table at which he will sit

'he has not come,' said neville. the door opens and he does not come. that is bernard. as he pulls off his coat he shows, of course, the blue shirt under his arm-pits. and then, unlike the rest of us, he comes in without pushing open a door, without knowing that he comes into a room full of strangers. he does not look in the glass. his hair is untidy, but he does not know it. he has no perception that we differ, or that this table is his goal. he hesitates on his way here. who is that? he asks himself, as he half knows a woman in an opera cloak. he half knows everybody; he knows

'here is percival,' said jinny. 'he has not dressed.'

'here is percival,' said bernard, 'smoothing his hair, not from vanity (he does not look in the glass), but to propitiate the god of decency. he is conventional; he is a hero. the little boys trooped after him across the playing-fields. they blew their noses as he blew his nose, but unsuccessfully, for he is percival. now, when he is about to leave us, to go to india, all these trifles come together. he is a hero. oh yes, that is not to be denied, and when he takes his seat by susan, whom he loves, the occasion is crowned. we

'now let us issue from the darkness of solitude,' said louis.

'and then,' said bernard, 'the cab came to the door, and, pressing our new bowler hats tightly over our eyes to hide our unmanly tears, we drove through streets in which even the housemaids looked at us, and our names painted in white letters on our boxes proclaimed to all the world that we were going to school with the regulation number of socks and drawers, on which our mothers for some nights previously had stitched our initials, in our boxes. a second severance from the body of our mother.'

'down from our heads veils fell,' said rhoda. 'we clasped the flowers with their green leaves rustling in garlands.'

'we changed, we became unrecognizable,' said louis. 'exposed to all these different lights, what we had in us (for we are all so different) came intermittently, in violent patches, spaced by blank voids, to the surface as if some acid had dropped unequally on the plate. i was this, neville that, rhoda different again, and bernard too.'

'then canoes slipped through palely tinted yellow branches,' said neville, 'and bernard, advancing in his casual way against breadths of green, against houses of very ancient foundation, tumbled in a heap on the ground beside me. in an access of emotion--winds are not more raving, nor lightning more sudden--i took my poem, i flung my poem, i slammed the door behind me.'

'i, however,' said louis, 'losing sight of you, sat in my office and tore the date from the calendar, and announced to

'the tiger leapt, and the swallow dipped her wings in dark pools on the other side of the world,' said rhoda.

'but here and now we are together,' said bernard. 'we have come together, at a particular time, to this particular spot. we are drawn into this communion by some deep, some common emotion. shall we call it, conveniently, "love"? shall we say "love of percival" because percival is going to india?

'no, that is too small, too particular a name. we cannot attach the width and spread of our feelings to so small a mark. we have come together (from the north, from the south, from susan's farm, from louis' house of business) to make one thing, not e

'but soon, too soon,' said bernard, 'this egotistic exultation fails. too soon the moment of ravenous identity is over, and the appetite for happiness, and happiness, and still more happiness is glutted. the stone is sunk; the moment is over. round me there spreads a wide margin of indifference. now open in my eyes a thousand eyes of curiosity. anyone now is at liberty to murder bernard, who is engaged to be married, so long as they leave untouched this margin of unknown territory, this forest of the unknown world. why, i ask (w

'that is the last drop and the brightest that we let fall like some supernal quicksilver into the swelling and splendid moment created by us from percival. what is to come? i ask, brushing the crumbs from my waistcoat, what is outside? we have proved, sitting eating, sitting talking, that we can add to the treasury of moments. we are not slaves bound to suffer incessantly unrecorded petty blows on our bent backs. we are not sheep either, following a master. we are creators. we too have made so

'such is the incomprehensible combination,' said bernard, 'such is the complexity of things, that as i descend the staircase i do not know which is sorrow, which joy. my son is born; percival is dead. i am upheld by pillars, shored up on either side by stark emotions; but which is sorrow, which is joy? i ask, and do not know, only that i need silence, and to be alone and to go out, and to save one hour to consider what has happened to my world, what death has done to my world.

'here am i shedding one of my life-skins, and all they will say is, "bernard is spending ten days in rome." here am i marching up and down this terrace alone, unoriented. but observe how dots and dashes are beginning, as i walk, to run themselves into continuous lines, how things are losing the bald, the separate identity that they had as i walked up those steps. the great red pot is now a reddish streak in a wave of yellowish green. the world is beginning to move past me like the banks of a hedge when the train starts, like the waves of the sea when a steamer moves. i

'now i shall go and lunch somewhere, i shall hold my glass up, i shall look through the wine, i shall observe with more than my usual detachment, and when a pretty woman enters the restaurant and comes down the room between the tables i shall say to myself, "look where she comes against a waste of waters." a meaningless observation, but to me, solemn, slate-coloured, with a fatal sound of ruining worlds and waters falling to destruction.

'so, bernard (i recall you, you the usual partner in my enterprises), let us begin this new chapter, and observe the formation of this new, this unknown, strange, altogether unidentified and terrifying experience--the new drop--which is about to shape itself. larpent is that man's name.'

'it is when spring comes, cold showery, with sudden yellow flowers--then as i look at the meat under the blue shade and press the heavy silver bags of tea, of sultanas, i remember how the sun rose, and the swallows skimmed the grass, and phrases that bernard made when we were children, and the leaves shook over us, many-folded, very light, breaking the blue of the sky, scattering wandering lights upon the skeleton roots of the beech trees where i sat, sobbing. the pigeon rose. i jumped up and ran after the words that trailed like the dangling string from an air ball, up and up, from branch to branch escaping. then like a cracked bowl the fixity of my morning broke, and putting down the bags of flour i thought, life stands round me like a glass roun

meanwhile the shadows lengthened on the beach; the blackness deepened. the iron black boot became a pool of deep blue. the rocks lost their hardness. the water that stood round the old boat was dark as if mussels had been steeped in it. the foam had turned livid and left here and there a white gleam of pearl on the misty sand.







'hampton court,' said bernard. 'hampton court. this is our meeting-place. behold the red chimneys, the square battlements of hampton court. the tone of my voice as i say "hampton court" proves that i am middle-aged. ten years, fifteen years ago, i should have said "hampton court?" with interrogation--what will it be like? will there be lakes, mazes? or with anticipation, what is going to happen to me here? whom shall i meet? now, hampton court--hampton court--the words beat a gong in the space which i have so laboriously cl

'now sitting side by side,' said neville, 'at this narrow table, now before the first emotion is worn smooth, what do we feel? honestly now, openly and directly as befits old friends meeting with difficulty, what do we feel on meeting? sorrow. the door will not open; he will not come. and we are laden. being now all of us middle-aged, loads are on us. let us put down our loads. what have you made of life, we ask, and i? you, bernard; you, susan; you, jinny; and rhoda and louis? the lists have been posted on the doors. before we break these rolls, and help ourselves to fish and salad, i feel in my private pocket and find my credentials--what i carry to prove my superiority. i have passed. i have papers in my private pocket that prove it. but your eyes, susan, full of turnips and cornfields, disturb me. these papers in my private pocket--the clamour that proves that i have passed--make a faint sound like that of a man clappi

'now we have clashed our antlers. this is the necessary prelude; the salute of old friends.'

'the gold has faded between the trees,' said rhoda, 'and a slice of green lies behind them, elongated like the blade of a knife seen in dreams, or some tapering island on which nobody sets foot. now the cars begin to wink and flicker, coming down the avenue. lovers can draw into the darkness now; the boles of the trees are swollen, are obscene with lovers.'

'it was different once,' said bernard. 'once we could break the current as we chose. how many telephone calls, how many post cards, are now needed to cut this hole through which we come together, united, at hampton court? how swift life runs from january to december! we are all swept on by the torrent of things grown so familiar that they cast no shade; we make no comparisons; think scarcely ever of i or of you; and in this unconsciousness attain the utmost freedom from friction and part the weeds that grow over the mouths of sunke

'but it is only my body--this elderly man here whom you call bernard--that is fixed irrevocably--so i desire to believe. i think more disinterestedly than i could when i was young and must dig furiously like a child rummaging in a bran-pie to discover my self. "look, what is this? and this? is this going to be a fine present? is that all?" and so on. now i know what the parcels hold; and do not care much. i throw my mind out in the air as a man throws seeds in great fan-flights, falling through the purple sunset, falling on the pressed and shining ploughland whi

'here in this dining-room you see the antlers and the tumblers; the salt-cellars; the yellow stains on the tablecloth. "waiter!" says bernard. "bread!" says susan. and the waiter comes; he brings bread. but i see the side of a cup like a mountain and only parts of antlers, and the brightness on the side of that jug like a crack in darkness with wonder and terror. your voices sound like trees creaking in a forest. so with your faces and their prominences and hollows. how beautiful, standing at a distance immobile at midnight against the railings of some square! behind you is a white crescent of foam, and fishermen on the verge of the

'drop upon drop,' said bernard, 'silence falls. it forms on the roof of the mind and falls into pools beneath. for ever alone, alone, alone,--hear silence fall and sweep its rings to the farthest edges. gorged and replete, solid with middle-aged content, i, whom loneliness destroys, let silence fall, drop by drop.

'as if the miracle had happened,' said jinny, 'and life were stayed here and now.'

'and,' said rhoda, 'we had no more to live.'

'but listen,' said louis, 'to the world moving through abysses of infinite space. it roars; the lighted strip of history is past and our kings and queens; we are gone; our civilization; the nile; and all life. our separate drops are dissolved; we are extinct, lost in the abysses of time, in the darkness.'

'silence falls; silence falls,' said bernard. 'but now listen; tick, tick; hoot, hoot; the world has hailed us back to it. i heard for one moment the howling winds of darkness as we passed beyond life. then tick, tick (the clock); then hoot, hoot (the cars). we are landed; we are on shore; we are sitting, six of us, at a table. it is the memory of my nose that recalls me. i rise; "fight," i cry, "fight!" remembering the shape of my own nose, and strike with this spoon upon this table pugnaciously.'

'they are saying to themselves,' said louis, '"it is time. i am still vigorous," they are saying. "my face shall be cut against the black of infinite space." they do not finish their sentences. "it is time," they keep saying. "the gardens will be shut." and going with them, rhoda, swept into their current, we shall perhaps drop a little behind.'

'like conspirators who have something to whisper,' said rhoda.)

'it is true, and i know for a fact,' said bernard, 'as we walk down this avenue, that a king, riding, fell over a molehill here. but how strange it seems to set against the whirling abysses of infinite space a little figure with a golden teapot on his head. soon one recovers belief in figures: but not at once in what they put on their heads. our english past--one inch of light. then people put teapots on their heads and say, "i am a king!" no, i try to recover, as we walk, the sense of time, but with that streaming darkness in my eyes i have l

'while we advance down this avenue,' said louis, 'i leaning slightly upon jinny, bernard arm-in-arm with neville, and susan with her hand in mine, it is difficult not to weep, calling ourselves little children, praying that god may keep us safe while we sleep. it is sweet to sing together, clasping hands, afraid of the dark, while miss curry plays the harmonium.'

'the still mood, the disembodied mood is on us,' said rhoda, 'and we enjoy this momentary alleviation (it is not often that one has no anxiety) when the walls of the mind become transparent. wren's palace, like the quartet played to the dry and stranded people in the stalls, makes an oblong. a square is stood upon the oblong and we say, "this is our dwelling-place. the structure is now visible. very little is left outside."'

'the flower,' said bernard, 'the red carnation that stood in the vase on the table of the restaurant when we dined together with percival, is become a six-sided flower; made of six lives.'

'a mysterious illumination,' said louis, 'visible against those yew trees.'

'built up with much pain, many strokes,' said jinny.

'now they vanish,' said louis. 'susan with bernard. neville with jinny. you and i, rhoda, stop for a moment by this stone urn. what song shall we hear now that these couples have sought the groves, and jinny, pointing with her gloved hand, pretends to notice the water-lilies, and susan, who has always loved bernard, says to him, "my ruined life, my wasted life." and neville, taking jinny's little hand, with the cherry-coloured finger-nails, by the lake, by the moonlit water, cries, "love, love," and she answers, imitating the bird, "love, love?" what song do we hear?'

'they vanish, towards the lake,' said rhoda. 'they slink away over the grass furtively, yet with assurance as if they asked of our pity their ancient privilege--not to be disturbed. the tide in the soul, tipped, flows that way; they cannot

'now,' said rhoda, 'as they pass that tree, they regain their natural size. they are only men, only women. wonder and awe change as they put off the draperies of the flowing tide. pity returns, as they emerge into the moonlight, like the relics of an army, our representatives, going every night (here or in greece) to battle, and coming back every night with their wounds, their ravaged faces. now light falls on them again. they have faces. they become susan and bernard, jinny and neville, people we know. now what a shrinkage takes place! now what a shrivelling, what an humiliation! the old shivers run through me, hatred and terror, as i feel myself grappled to one spot by these hooks they cast on us; these greetings, recognitions, pluckings of the finger and searchings of the eyes. yet they have only to speak, and their first words, with the remembered tone and the perpetual deviation from what one expects, and their hands moving and making a thousand past da

'we have destroyed something by our presence,' said bernard, 'a world perhaps.'

'yet we scarcely breathe,' said neville, 'spent as we are. we are in that passive and exhausted frame of mind when we only wish to rejoin the body of our mother from whom we have been severed. all else is distasteful, forced and fatiguing. jinny's yellow scarf is moth-coloured in this light; susan's eyes are quenched. we are scarcely to be distinguished from the river. one cigarette end is the

'after our fire,' said jinny, 'there is nothing left to put in lockets.'

'still i gape,' said susan, 'like a young bird, unsatisfied, for something that has escaped me.'

'let us stay for a moment,' said bernard, 'before we go. let us pace the terrace by the river almost alone. it is nearly bed-time. people have gone home. now how comforting it is to watch the lights coming out in the bedrooms of small shopkeepers on the other side of the river. there is one--there is another. what do you think their takings have been today? only just enough to pay for the rent, for light and food and the children's clothing. but just enough. what a sense of the tolerableness of life the lights in the bedrooms of small

'now to sum up,' said bernard. 'now to explain to you the meaning of my life. since we do not know each other (though i met you once, i think, on board a ship going to africa), we can talk freely. the illusion is upon me that something adheres for a moment, has roundness, weight, depth, is completed. this, for the moment, seems to be my life. if it were possible, i would hand it to you entire. i would break it off as one breaks off a bunch of grapes. i would say, "take it. this is my life."

 old friends committed to different careers. louis, the attic dweller; rhoda, the nymph of the fountain always wet; both contradicted what was then so positive to me; both gave the other side of what seemed to me so evident (that we marry, that we domesticate); for which i loved them, pitied them, and also deeply envied them their different lot.

'once i had a biographer, dead long since, but if he still followed my footsteps with his old flattering intensity he would here say, "about this time bernard married and bought a house . . . his friends observed in him a growing tendency to domesticity . . . the birth of children made it highly desirable that he should augment his income." that is the biographic style, and it does to tack together torn bits of stuff, stuff with raw edges. after all, one cannot find fault with the biographic style if one begins letters "dear sir", ends them "your faithfully"; one cannot despise these phrases laid like roman roads across the tumult of our lives, since

'i became, i mean, a certain kind of man, scoring my path across life as one treads a path across the fields. my boots became worn a little on the left side. when i came in, certain re-arrangements took place. "here's bernard!" how differently different people say that! there are many rooms--many bernards. there was the charming, but weak; the strong, but supercilious; the brilliant, but remorseless; the very good fellow, but, i make no doubt, the awful bore; the sympathetic, but cold; the shabby, but--go into the next room--the foppish, worldly, and too well dressed. what i was to myself was different; was none of these. i am inclined to pin myself down most firmly there before the loaf at breakfast with my wife, w

ment, and the other person coming along the road to the meeting-place dressed like this or that, with a stick or without, seemed to contradict it. i saw jinny look at susan's earthy fingers and then hide her own; i, considering neville, so neat and exact, felt the nebulosity of my own life blurred with all these phrases. he then boasted, because he was ashamed of one room and one person and his own success. louis and rhoda, the conspirators, the spies at table, who take notes, felt, "after all, bernard can make the waiter fetch us rolls--a contact denied us." we saw for a moment laid out among us the body of the complete human being whom we have failed to be, but at the same time, cannot forget. all that we might have been we saw; all that we had missed, and we grudged for a moment the other's claim, as children when the cake is cut, the one cake, the only cake, watch their slice diminishing.

"wait," i said, putting my arm in imagination (thus we consort with our friends) through her arm. "wait until these omnibuses have gone by. do not cross so dangerously. these men are your brothers." in persuading her i was also persuading my own soul. for this is not one life; nor do i always know if i am man or woman, bernard or neville, louis, susan, jinny, or rhoda--so strange is the contact of one with another.
