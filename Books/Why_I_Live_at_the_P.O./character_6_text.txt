why i live at the p.o.


i was getting along fine with mama, papa-daddy and uncle rondo until my sister stella-rondo just separated from her husband and came back home again. mr. whitaker! of course i went with mr. whitaker first, when he first appeared here in china grove, taking "pose yourself" photos, and stella-rondo broke us up. told him i was one-sided. bigger on one side than the other, which is a deliberate, calculated falsehood: i'm the same. stella-rondo is exactly twelve months to the day younger than i am and for that reason she's spoiled.
   she's always had anything in the world she wanted and then she'd throw it away. papa-daddy gave her this gorgeous add-a-pearl necklace when she was eight years ol

d and she threw it away playing baseball when she was nine, with only two pearls.
   so as soon as she got married and moved away from home the first thing she did was separate! from mr. whitaker! this photographer with the popeyes she said she trusted. came home from one of those towns up in illinois and to our complete surprise brought this child of two.
   mama said she like to made her drop dead for a second. "here you had this marvelous blonde child and never so much as wrote your mother a word about it," says mama. "i'm thoroughly ashamed of you." but of course she wasn't.
   stella-rondo just calmly takes off this hat, i wish you could see it. she says, "why, mama, shirley-t.'s a

 that oh, i didn't mean a thing, only that whoever shirley-t. was, she was the spit-image of papa-daddy if he'd cut off his beard, which of course he'd never do in the world. papa-daddy's mama's papa and sulks.
   stella-rondo got furious! she said, "sister, i don't need to tell you you got a lot of nerve and always did have and i'll thank you to make no future reference to my adopted child whatsoever."
   "very well," i said. "very well, very well. of course i noticed at once she looks like mr. whitaker's side too. that frown. she looks like a cross between mr. whitaker and papa-daddy."
   "well, all i can say is she isn't."
   "she looks exactly like shirley temple to me," says mama, but shirley-t. just ran away from her.
   so the first thing stella-rondo did at the table was turn papa-daddy against me.
   "papa-daddy," she says. he was trying to cut up his meat. "papa-daddy!" i was taken completely by surprise. papa-daddy is about a million years old and's got this long-long beard. "papa-da

 way she ate in cairo.
   so papa-daddy says, "i am going out and lie in the hammock, and you can all sit here and remember my words: i'll never cut off my beard as long as i live, even one inch, and i don't appreciate it in you at all." passed right by me in the hall and went straight out and got in the hammock.
   it would be a holiday. it wasn't five minutes before uncle rondo suddenly appeared in the hall in one of stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimonos, all cut on the bias, like something mr. whitaker probably thought was gorgeous.
   "uncle rondo!" i says. "i didn't know who that was! where are you going?"
   "sister," he says, "get out of my way, i'm poisoned."
   "if you're poisoned stay away from papa-daddy," i says. "keep out of the hammock. papa-daddy will certainly beat you on the head if you come within forty miles of him. he thinks i deliberately said he ought to cut off his beard after he got me the p.o., and i've told him and told him and told him, and he acts like he just don't h

-hot in the house, with all the windows shut and locked, everybody who cares to stay in their right mind will have to go out and get in the hammock before the fourth of july is over."
   "don't you notice anything different about uncle rondo?" asks stella-rondo.
   "why, no, except he's got on some terrible-looking flesh-colored contraption i wouldn't be found dead in, is all i can see," i says.
   "never mind, you won't be found dead in it, because it happens to be part of my trousseau, and mr. whitaker took several dozen photographs of me in it," says stella-rondo. "what on earth could uncle rondo mean  by wearing part of my trousseau out in the broad open daylight without saying so much as 'kiss my foot,' knowing  i only got home this morning after my separation and hung my negligee up on the bathroom door, just as nervous as i could be?"
   "i'm sure i don't know, and what do you expect me to do about it?" i says. "jump out the window?"
   "no, i expect nothing of the kind. i simply declare

dition, i must say. or poor little adopted shirley-t. shame on you!"
   that made me tired. i says, "well, stella-rondo had better thank her lucky stars it was her instead of me came trotting in with that very peculiar-looking child. now if it had been me that trotted in from illinois and brought a peculiar-looking child of two, i shudder to think of the reception i'd of got, much less controlled the diet of an entire family."
   "but you must remember, sister, that you were never married to mr. whitaker in the first place and didn't go up to illinois to live," says mama, shaking a spoon in my face. "if you had i would of been just as overjoyed to see you and your little adopted girl as i was to see stella-rondo, when you wound up with your separation and came on back home."
   ''you would not," i says.
   "don't contradict me, i would," says mama.
   but i said she couldn't convince me though she talked till she was blue in the face. then i said, "besides, you know as well as i do that that ch

ounds and has real tiny feet.
   just then something perfectly horrible occurred to me.
   "mama," i says, "can that child talk?" i simply had to whisper! "mama, i wonder if that child can be  -  you know  -  in any way? do you realize," i says, "that she hasn't spoken one single, solitary word to a human being up to this minute? this is the way she looks," i says, and i looked like this.
   well, mama and i just stood there and stared at each other. it was horrible!
   "i remember well that joe whitaker frequently drank like a fish," says mama. "i believed to my soul he drank chemicals."  and without another word she marches to the foot of the stairs and calls stella-rondo.
   "stella-rondo? o-o-o-o-o! stella-rondo!"
   "what?" says stella-rondo from upstairs. not even the grace to get up off the bed.
   "can that child of yours talk?" asks mama.
   stella-rondo says, "can she what?"
   "talk! talk!" says mama. "burdyburdyburdyburdy!"
   so stella-rondo yells back, "who says she can't talk?"

 you're so dead to see 'em."
   "not i! i'll never darken the door to that post office again if i live to be a hundred," mama says. "ungrateful child! after all the money we spent on you at the normal."
   "me either," says stella-rondo. "you can just let my mail lie there and rot,  for all i care. i'll never come and relieve you of a single, solitary piece."
   "i should worry," i says. "and who you think's going to sit down and write you all those big fat letters and postcards, by the way? mr. whitaker? just because he was the only man ever dropped down in china grove and you got him  -  unfairly  -  is he going to sit down and write you a lengthy correspondence after you come home giving no rhyme nor reason whatsoever for your separation and no explanation for the presence of that child? i may not have your brilliant mind, but i fail to see it."
   so mama says, "sister, i've told you a thousand times that stella-rondo simply got homesick, and this child is far too big to be hers," and she s

d have tried that yesterday. i'm going to the p.o. and the only way you can possibly see me is to visit me there."
   so papa-daddy says, "you'll never catch me setting foot in that post office, even if i should take a notion into my head to write a letter some place." he says, "i won't have you reachin' out of that little old window with a pair of shears and cuttin' off any beard of mine. i'm too smart for you!"
   "we all are," says stella-rondo.
   but i said, "if you're so smart, where's mr. whitaker?"
   so then uncle rondo says, "i'll thank you from now on to stop reading all the orders i get on postcards and telling everybody in china grove what you think is the matter with them," but i says, "i draw my own conclusions and will continue in the future to draw them." i says, "if people want to write their inmost secrets on penny postcards, there's nothing in the wide world you can do about it, uncle rondo."
   "and if you think we'll ever write  another postcard you're sadly mistaken," say

s mama.
   "cutting off your nose to spite your face then," i says. "but if you're all determined to have no more to do with the u.s. mail, think of this: what will stella-rondo do now, if she wants to tell mr. whitaker to come after her?"
   "wah!" says stella-rondo. i knew she'd cry. she had a conniption fit right there in the kitchen.
   "it will be interesting to see how long she holds out," i says. "and
now  -  i am leaving."
   "good-bye," says uncle rondo.
   "oh, i declare," says mama, "to think that a family of mine should quarrel on the fourth of july, or the day after, over stella-rondo leaving old mr. whitaker and having the sweetest little adopted child! it looks like we'd all be glad!"
   "wah!"

says stella-rondo, and has a fresh conniption fit.
   "he  left her   -  you mark my words," i says. "that's mr. whitaker. i know mr. whitaker. after all, i knew him first. i said from the beginning he'd up and leave her. i foretold every single thing that's happened."
   "where did he go?" asks mama.
   "probably to the north pole, if he knows what's good for him," i says.
   but stella-rondo just bawled and wouldn't say another word. she flew to her room and slammed the door.
   "now look what you've gone and done, sister," says mama. "you go apologize."
   "i haven't got time, i'm leaving," i says.
   "well, what are you waiting ar

 did tell stella-rondo good-bye.
   there was a girl going along on a little wagon right in front.
   "girl," i says, "come help me haul these things down the hill, i'm going to live in the post office."
   took her nine trips in her express wagon. uncle rondo came out on the porch and threw her a nickel.
   and that's the last i've laid eyes on any of my family or my family laid eyes on me for five solid days and nights. stella-rondo may be telling the most horrible tales in the world about mr. whitaker, but i haven't heard them. as i tell everybody, i draw my own conclusions.
   but oh, i like it here. it's ideal, as i've been saying. you see, i've got everything cater-cornered, the way i like it. hear the radio? all the war news. radio, sewing machine, book ends, ironing board and that great big piano lamp  -  peace, that's what i like. butter-bean vines planted all along the front where the strings are.
   of course, there's not much mail. my family are naturally the main people in china gr

he earth, for all the mail they get or the mail they write, why, i'm not going to open my mouth. some of the folks here in town are taking up for me and some turned against me. i know which is which. there are always people who will quit buying stamps just to get on the right side of papa-daddy.
   but here i am, and here i'll stay. i want the world to know i'm happy.
   and if stella-rondo should come to me this minute, on bended knees, and attempt  to explain the incidents of her life with mr. whitaker, i'd simply put my fingers in both my ears and refuse to listen.
