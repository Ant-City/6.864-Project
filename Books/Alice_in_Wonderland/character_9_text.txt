th fur. it
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself â€˜suppose it should be raving mad after all! i almost
wish iâ€™d gone to see the hatter instead!â€™




chapter vii. a mad tea-party

there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
march hare and the hatter were having tea at it: a dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. â€˜very
uncomfortable for the dormouse,â€™ thought alice; â€˜only, as itâ€™s asleep, i
suppose it doesnâ€™t mind.â€™

the table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: â€˜no room! no room!â€™ they cried out when they saw alice
coming. â€˜thereâ€™s plenty of room!â€™ said alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large ar

say what you mean,â€™ the march hare went on.

â€˜i do,â€™ alice hastily replied; â€˜at least--at least i mean what i
say--thatâ€™s the same thing, you know.â€™

â€˜not the same thing a bit!â€™ said the hatter. â€˜you might just as well say
that â€œi see what i eatâ€ is the same thing as â€œi eat what i seeâ€!â€™

â€˜you might just as well say,â€™ added the march hare, â€˜that â€œi like what i
getâ€ is the same thing as â€œi get what i likeâ€!â€™

â€˜you might just as well say,â€™ added the dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, â€˜that â€œi breathe when i sleepâ€ is the same thing
as â€œi sleep when i breatheâ€!â€™

â€˜it is the same thing with you,â€™ said the hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasnâ€™t much.

the hatter was the first to break the silence. â€˜what day of the month
is it?â€™ he said, turning to alice: he had taken his watch out o

t is!â€™

â€˜why should it?â€™ muttered the hatter. â€˜does your watch tell you what
year it is?â€™

â€˜of course not,â€™ alice replied very readily: â€˜but thatâ€™s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.â€™

â€˜which is just the case with mine,â€™ said the hatter.

alice felt dreadfully puzzled. the hatterâ€™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. â€˜i donâ€™t quite
understand you,â€™ she said, as politely as she could.

â€˜the dormouse is asleep again,â€™ said the hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, â€˜of course, of course; just what i was going to remark myself.â€™

â€˜have you guessed the riddle yet?â€™ the hatter said, turning to alice
again.

â€˜no, i give it up,â€™ alice replied: â€˜whatâ€™s the answer?â€™

â€˜i havenâ€™t the slightest idea,â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜nor i,â€™ said the march hare.

alice sighed wearily. â€˜i thi

e went mad, you know--â€™ (pointing
with his tea spoon at the march hare,) â€˜--it was at the great concert
given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing

     â€œtwinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     how i wonder what youâ€™re at!â€

you know the song, perhaps?â€™

â€˜iâ€™ve heard something like it,â€™ said alice.

â€˜it goes on, you know,â€™ the hatter continued, â€˜in this way:--

     â€œup above the world you fly,
     like a tea-tray in the sky.
         twinkle, twinkle--â€œâ€™

here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep â€˜twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--â€™ and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.

â€˜well, iâ€™d hardly finished the first verse,â€™ said the hatter, â€˜when the
queen jumped up and bawled out, â€œheâ€™s murdering the time! off with his
head!â€â€™

â€˜how dreadfully savage!â€™ exclaimed alice.

â€˜and ever since that,â€™ the hatter went on in a mournful tone, â€˜he wonâ€™t
do a thing i ask! itâ€™s always six oâ€™clock now.â€

me to wash the things between whiles.â€™

â€˜then you keep moving round, i suppose?â€™ said alice.

â€˜exactly so,â€™ said the hatter: â€˜as the things get used up.â€™

â€˜but what happens when you come to the beginning again?â€™ alice ventured
to ask.

â€˜suppose we change the subject,â€™ the march hare interrupted, yawning.
â€˜iâ€™m getting tired of this. i vote the young lady tells us a story.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m afraid i donâ€™t know one,â€™ said alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

â€˜then the dormouse shall!â€™ they both cried. â€˜wake up, dormouse!â€™ and
they pinched it on both sides at once.

the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. â€˜i wasnâ€™t asleep,â€™ he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: â€˜i heard every word you fellows were saying.â€™

â€˜tell us a story!â€™ said the march hare.

â€˜yes, please do!â€™ pleaded alice.

â€˜and be quick about it,â€™ added the hatter, â€˜or youâ€™ll be asleep again
before itâ€™s done.â€™

â€˜once upon a time there were three little sisters,â€™ the dormouse b

in a great hurry; â€˜and their names were elsie, lacie, and tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--â€™

â€˜what did they live on?â€™ said alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.

â€˜they lived on treacle,â€™ said the dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

â€˜they couldnâ€™t have done that, you know,â€™ alice gently remarked; â€˜theyâ€™d
have been ill.â€™

â€˜so they were,â€™ said the dormouse; â€˜very ill.â€™

alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: â€˜but
why did they live at the bottom of a well?â€™

â€˜take some more tea,â€™ the march hare said to alice, very earnestly.

â€˜iâ€™ve had nothing yet,â€™ alice replied in an offended tone, â€˜so i canâ€™t
take more.â€™

â€˜you mean you canâ€™t take less,â€™ said the hatter: â€˜itâ€™s very easy to take
more than nothing.â€™

â€˜nobody asked yo

ur opinion,â€™ said alice.

â€˜whoâ€™s making personal remarks now?â€™ the hatter asked triumphantly.

alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the dormouse, and
repeated her question. â€˜why did they live at the bottom of a well?â€™

the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, â€˜it was a treacle-well.â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s no such thing!â€™ alice was beginning very angrily, but the
hatter and the march hare went â€˜sh! sh!â€™ and the dormouse sulkily
remarked, â€˜if you canâ€™t be civil, youâ€™d better finish the story for
yourself.â€™

â€˜no, please go on!â€™ alice said very humbly; â€˜i wonâ€™t interrupt again. i
dare say there may be one.â€™

â€˜one, indeed!â€™ said the dormouse indignantly. however, he cons

ented to
go on. â€˜and so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--â€™

â€˜what did they draw?â€™ said alice, quite forgetting her promise.

â€˜treacle,â€™ said the dormouse, without considering at all this time.

â€˜i want a clean cup,â€™ interrupted the hatter: â€˜letâ€™s all move one place
on.â€™

he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him: the march hare
moved into the dormouseâ€™s place, and alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the march hare. the hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: â€˜but i donâ€™t understand. where did they draw the treacle
from?â€™

â€˜you can draw water out of a water-well,â€™ said the hatter; â€˜so i should
think you could dr

aw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?â€™

â€˜but they were in the well,â€™ alice said to the dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.

â€˜of course they wereâ€™, said the dormouse; â€˜--well in.â€™

this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

â€˜they were learning to draw,â€™ the dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; â€˜and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an m--â€™

â€˜why with an m?â€™ said alice.

â€˜why not?â€™ said the march hare.

alice was silent.

the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: â€˜--that begins with an m, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you

know you say
things are â€œmuch of a muchnessâ€--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?â€™

â€˜really, now you ask me,â€™ said alice, very much confused, â€˜i donâ€™t
think--â€™

â€˜then you shouldnâ€™t talk,â€™ said the hatter.

this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the dormouse into
the teapot.

â€˜at any rate iâ€™ll never go there again!â€™ said alice as she picked her
way through the wood. â€˜itâ€™s the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in all
my life!â€™

just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door
leading right i

e rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, â€˜first witness!â€™

the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. â€˜i beg pardon, your
majesty,â€™ he began, â€˜for bringing these in: but i hadnâ€™t quite finished
my tea when i was sent for.â€™

â€˜you ought to have finished,â€™ said the king. â€˜when did you begin?â€™

the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the dormouse. â€˜fourteenth of march, i think it
was,â€™ he said.

â€˜fifteenth,â€™ said the march hare.

â€˜sixteenth,â€™ added the dormouse.

â€˜write that down,â€™ the king said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

â€˜take off your hat,â€™ the king said to the hatter.

â€˜it isnâ€™t mine,â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜stolen!â€™ the king exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a

e other, looking uneasily at the queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.

â€˜i wish you wouldnâ€™t squeeze so.â€™ said the dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. â€˜i can hardly breathe.â€™

â€˜i canâ€™t help it,â€™ said alice very meekly: â€˜iâ€™m growing.â€™

â€˜youâ€™ve no right to grow here,â€™ said the dormouse.

â€˜donâ€™t talk nonsense,â€™ said alice more boldly: â€˜you know youâ€™re growing
too.â€™

â€˜yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace,â€™ said the dormouse: â€˜not in that
ridiculous fashion.â€™ and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court.

all this time the queen had never left off

 staring at the hatter, and,
just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, â€˜bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!â€™ on
which the wretched hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

â€˜give your evidence,â€™ the king repeated angrily, â€˜or iâ€™ll have you
executed, whether youâ€™re nervous or not.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m a poor man, your majesty,â€™ the hatter began, in a trembling voice,
â€˜--and i hadnâ€™t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the

â€˜it began with the tea,â€™ the hatter replied.

â€˜of course twinkling begins with a t!â€™ said the king sharply. â€˜do you
take me for a dunce? go on!â€™

â€˜iâ€™m a poor man,â€™ the hatter went on, â€˜and most things twinkled after
that--only the march hare said--â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t!â€™ the march hare interrupted in a great hurry.

â€˜you did!â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜i deny it!â€™ said the march hare.

â€˜he denies it,â€™ said the king: â€˜leave out that part.â€™

â€˜well, at any rate, the dormouse said--â€™ the hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

â€˜after that,â€™ continued the hatter, â€˜i cut some more bread-and-butter--â€™

â€˜but what did the dormouse say?â€™ one of the jury asked.

â€˜that i canâ€™t remember,â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜you must remember,â€™ remarked the king, â€˜or iâ€™ll have you executed.â€™

the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee.

nce,â€™ said the king.

â€˜shanâ€™t,â€™ said the cook.

the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a low voice,
â€˜your majesty must cross-examine this witness.â€™

â€˜well, if i must, i must,â€™ the king said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, â€˜what are tarts made of?â€™

â€˜pepper, mostly,â€™ said the cook.

â€˜treacle,â€™ said a sleepy voice behind her.

â€˜collar that dormouse,â€™ the queen shrieked out. â€˜behead that dormouse!
turn that dormouse out of court! suppress him! pinch him! off with his
whiskers!â€™

for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

â€˜never mind!â€™ said the king, with an air of great relief. â€˜call the next
witness.â€™ and he added in an undertone to the queen, â€˜really, my dear,
you must cross-examine the next witness. it quite
