lian states,
but by many passages in his poetry, from "the assembly of
fowls" to "the canterbury tales." in the opening of the first
poem  there is a striking parallel to dante's inscription on the
gate of hell.  the first song of troilus, in "troilus and
cressida", is a nearly literal translation of petrarch's 88th
sonnet. in the prologue to "the legend of good women",
there is a reference to dante which can hardly have reached the
poet at second- hand. and in chaucer's great work -- as in the
wife of bath's tale, and the monk's tale  -- direct reference by
name is made to dante, "the wise poet of florence," "the great
poet of italy," as the source whence the author has quoted.
when we consider the poet's high place in literature and at
court, which could not fail to make him free of the hospitalities
of the brilliant little lombard states; his familiarity with the
tongue and the works of italy's greatest bards, dead and living;
the reverential regard which he paid to the memory of great
poets, o

rds are put into the mouth, not of
the poet, but of the clerk; and meets it by the counter-
objection, that the clerk, being a purely imaginary personage,
could not have learned the story at padua from petrarch -- and
therefore that chaucer must have departed from the dramatic
assumption maintained in the rest of the dialogue. instances
could be adduced from chaucer's writings to show that such a
sudden "departure from the dramatic assumption" would not be
unexampled: witness the "aside" in the wife of bath's
prologue, where, after the jolly dame has asserted that "half so
boldly there can no man swear and lie as a woman can", the
poet hastens to interpose, in his own person, these two lines:

"i say not this by wives that be wise,
but if it be when they them misadvise."

and again, in the prologue to the "legend of good women,"
from a description of the daisy --

"she is the clearness and the very light,
that in this darke world me guides and leads,"

the poet, in the very next lines, slides into

"all ready, sir," quoth she, "right as you lest,*                *please

"yes, dame," quoth he, "tell forth, and i will hear."


notes to the prologue to the wife of bath's tale


1. among the evidences that chaucer's great work was left
incomplete, is the absence of any link of connexion between the
wife of bath's prologue and tale, and what goes before. this
deficiency has in some editions caused the squire's and the
merchant's tales to be interposed between those of the man of
law and the wife of bath; but in the merchant's tale there is
internal proof that it was told after the jolly dame's.  several
manuscripts contain verses designed to serve as a connexio

notes to the wife of bath's tale


1. it is not clear whence chaucer derived this tale. tyrwhitt
thinks it was taken from the story of florent, in the first book of
gower's "confessio amantis;" or perhaps from an older
narrative from which gower himself borrowed. chaucer has
condensed and otherwise improved the fable, especially by
laying the scene, not in sicily, but at the court of our own king
arthur.

2. limitours: begging friars. see note 18 to the prologue to the
tales.

3. thorpes: villages.  compare german, "dor

our host answered, "peace, no more of this."
and afterward he said unto the frere,
"tell forth your tale, mine owen master dear."


notes to the prologue to the friar's tale


1. on the tale of the friar, and that of the sompnour which
follows, tyrwhitt has remarked that they "are well engrafted
upon that of the wife of bath. the ill-humour which shows
itself between these two characters is quite natural, as no two
professions at that time were at more constant variance.  the
regular clergy, and particularly the mendicant friars, affected a
total exemption from all ecclesiastical jurisdiction,  except that
of the pope, which made them exceedingly obnoxious to the
bishops and of course to all the inferior officers of the national
hierarchy." both tales, whatever their origin, are bitter satires
on the greed and worl

22. these stories are all taken from the book of st jerome

many of her ancient instances. see note 1 to the prologue to the

in battle against his former alhes.  his wife, inconsolable at his
loss, slew herself immediately.

21. mulier est hominis confusio:  this line is taken from the
same fabulous conference between the emperor adrian and the
philosopher secundus, whence chaucer derived some of the
arguments in praise of poverty employed in the wife of bath's
tale proper. see note 14 to the wife of bath's tale.  the
passage transferred to the text is the commencement of a
description of woman. "quid est mulier? hominis confusio," &c.
("what is woman? a union with man", &c.)

22. col-fox: a blackish fox, so called because of its likeness to
coal, according to skinner; though more probably the prefix has
a reproachful meaning, and is in some way connected with the
word "cold" as, some forty lines below, it is applied to the
prejudicial counsel of wo

describe "sighs" and other tokens of grief, and "cares" or
"anxieties."

23. undern:  in this case, the meaning of "evening" or
"afternoon" can hardly be applied to the word, which must be
taken to signify some early hour of the forenoon. see also note
4 to the wife of bath's tale and note 5 to the clerk's tale.

24. ganilion: a traitor.  see note 9 to the shipman's tale and

note to the canon's yeoman's tale


1.  the tale of the canon's yeoman, like those of the wife of
bath and the pardoner, is made up of two parts; a long
general introduction, and the story proper. in the case of the
wife of bath, the interruptions of other pilgrims, and the
autobiographical nature of the discourse, recommend the
separation of the prologue from the tale proper; but in the
other cases the introductory or merely connecting matter
ceases wholly where the opening of "the tale" has been
marked in the text.

2. jupartie: jeopardy, hazard.  in froissart's french, "a jeu
partie" is used to signify a game or contest in which the
chances were exactly equal for both sides.

3. squames: scales; latin, "squamae."

notes to l'envoy of chaucer to bukton.


1. tyrwhitt, founding on the reference to the wife of bath,
places this among chaucer's latest compositions; and states that
one peter de bukton held the office of king's escheator for
yorkshire in 1397. in some of the old editions, the verses were
made the envoy to the book of the duchess blanche -- in
