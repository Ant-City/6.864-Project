    and he himself will answer.

  northumberland. what news, lord bardolph? every minute now
    should be the father of some stratagem.
    the times are wild; contention, like a horse
    full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
    and bears down all before him.
  lord bardolph. noble earl,
    i bring you certain news from shrewsbury.
  northumberland. good, an god will!
  lord bardolph. as good as heart can wish.
    the king is almost wounded to the death;
    and, in the fortune of my lord your son,
    prince harry slain outright; and both the blunts
    kill'd by the hand of douglas; young prince john,
    and westmoreland, and stafford, fled the field;
    and harry monmouth's brawn, the hulk sir john,
    is prisoner to your son. o, such a day,
    so fought, so followed, and so fairly won,
    came not till now to dignify the times,
    since cxsar's fortunes

  northumberland. how is this deriv'd?
    saw you the field? came you from shrewsbury?
  lord bardolph. i spake with one, my lord, that came from
thence;
    a gentleman well bred and of good name,
    that freely rend'red me these news for true.

                         enter travers

  northumberland. here comes my servant travers, whom i sent
    on tuesday last to listen after news.
  lord bardolph. my lord, i over-rode him on the way;
    and he is furnish'd with no certainties
    more than he haply may retail from me.
  northumberland. now, travers, what good tidings comes with you?
  travers. my lord, sir john umfrevile turn'd me back
    with joyful tidings; and, being better hors'd,
    out-rode me. after him came spurring hard
    a gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
    that stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
    he ask'd the way to chester; and of him

 told me that rebellion had bad luck,
    and that young harry percy's spur was cold.
    with that he gave his able horse the head
    and, bending forward, struck his armed heels
    against the panting sides of his poor jade
    up to the rowel-head; and starting so,
    he seem'd in running to devour the way,
    staying no longer question.
  northumberland. ha! again:
    said he young harry percy's spur was cold?
    of hotspur, coldspur? that rebellion
    had met ill luck?
  lord bardolph. my lord, i'll tell you what:
    if my young lord your son have not the day,
    upon mine honour, for a silken point
    i'll give my barony. never talk of it.
  northumberland. why should that gentleman that rode by travers
    give then such instances of loss?
  lord bardolph. who- he?
    he was some hilding fellow that had stol'n
    the horse he rode on and, upon my life,
    spoke at a venture. look, here comes more news.

                        enter morton

 say not that percy's dead.
    i see a strange confession in thine eye;
    thou shak'st thy head, and hold'st it fear or sin
    to speak a truth. if he be slain, say so:
    the tongue offends not that reports his death;
    and he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
    not he which says the dead is not alive.
    yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
    hath but a losing office, and his tongue
    sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
    rememb'red tolling a departing friend.
  lord bardolph. i cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
  morton. i am sorry i should force you to believe
    that which i would to god i had not seen;
    but these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
    rend'ring faint quittance, wearied and out-breath'd,
    to harry monmouth, whose swift wrath beat down
    the never-daunted percy to the earth,
    from whence with life he never more sprung up.
    in few, his death- whose spirit lent a fire
    even to the dullest peasant in his camp-

 approach
    the ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
    to frown upon th' enrag'd northumberland!
    let heaven kiss earth! now let not nature's hand
    keep the wild flood confin'd! let order die!
    and let this world no longer be a stage
    to feed contention in a ling'ring act;
    but let one spirit of the first-born cain
    reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
    on bloody courses, the rude scene may end
    and darkness be the burier of the dead!
  lord bardolph. this strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
  morton. sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
    the lives of all your loving complices
    lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
    to stormy passion, must perforce decay.
    you cast th' event of war, my noble lord,
    and summ'd the account of chance before you said
    'let us make head.' it was your pre-surmise
    that in the dole of blows your son might drop.
    you knew he walk'd o'er perils on an edge

,
    more likely to fall in than to get o'er;
    you were advis'd his flesh was capable
    of wounds and scars, and that his forward spirit
    would lift him where most trade of danger rang'd;
    yet did you say 'go forth'; and none of this,
    though strongly apprehended, could restrain
    the stiff-borne action. what hath then befall'n,
    or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth
    more than that being which was like to be?
  lord bardolph. we all that are engaged to this loss
    knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
    that if we wrought out life 'twas ten to one;
    and yet we ventur'd, for the gain propos'd
    chok'd the respect of likely peril fear'd;
    and since we are o'erset, venture again.
    come, we will put forth, body and goods.
  morton. 'tis more than time. and, my most noble lord,
    i hear for certain, and dare speak the truth:
    the gentle archbishop of york is up
    with well-appointe

york. the archbishop's palace

enter the archbishop, thomas mowbray the earl marshal, lord
hastings,
and lord bardolph

  archbishop. thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
    and, my most noble friends, i pray you all
    speak plainly your opinions of our hopes-
    and first, lord marshal, what say you to it?
  mowbray. i well allow the occasion of our amis;
    but gladly would be better satisfied
    how, in our means, we should advance ourselves
    to look with forehead bold and big enough
    upon the power and puissance of the king.
  hastings. our present musters grow upon the

    to five and twenty thousand men of choice;
    and our supplies live largely in the hope
    of great northumberland, whose bosom burns
    with an incensed fire of injuries.
  lord bardolph. the question then, lord hastings, standeth thus:
    whether our present five and twenty thousand
    may hold up head without northumberland?
  hastings. with him, we may.
  lord bardolph. yea, marry, there's the point;
    but if without him we be thought too feeble,
    my judgment is we should not step too far
    till we had his assistance by the hand;
    for, in a theme so bloody-fac'd as this,
    conjecture, expectation, and surmise
    of aids incertain, should not be admitted.
  archbishop. 'tis very true, lord bardolph; for indeed
    it was young hotspur's case at shrewsbury.
  lord bardolph. it was, my lord; who lin'd himself with hope,
    eating the air

and promise of supply,
    flatt'ring himself in project of a power
    much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts;
    and so, with great imagination
    proper to madmen, led his powers to death,
    and, winking, leapt into destruction.
  hastings. but, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
    to lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
  lord bardolph. yes, if this present quality of war-
    indeed the instant action, a cause on foot-
    lives so in hope, as in an early spring
    we see th' appearing buds; which to prove fruit
    hope gives not so much warrant, as despair
    that frosts will bite them. when we mean to build,
    we first survey the plot, then draw the model;
    and when we see the figure of the house,
    then we must rate the cost of the erection;
    which if we find outweighs ability,
    what do we then b

en instead of men;
    like one that draws the model of a house
    beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
    gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
    a naked subject to the weeping clouds
    and waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
  hastings. grant that our hopes- yet likely of fair birth-
    should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
    the utmost man of expectation,
    i think we are so a body strong enough,
    even as we are, to equal with the king.
  lord bardolph. what, is the king but five and twenty thousand?
  hastings. to us no more; nay, not so much, lord bardolph;
    for his divisions, as the times do brawl,
    are in three heads: one power against the french,
    and one against glendower; perforce a third
    must take up us. so is the unfirm king
    in three divided; and his coffers sound
    with hollow poverty and emptiness.
  archbishop. that he should draw his several strengths together
    and come against us in full puissance

    need not be dreaded.
  hastings. if he should do so,
    he leaves his back unarm'd, the french and welsh
    baying at his heels. never fear that.
  lord bardolph. who is it like should lead his forces hither?
  hastings. the duke of lancaster and westmoreland;
    against the welsh, himself and harry monmouth;
    but who is substituted against the french
    i have no certain notice.
  archbishop. let us on,
    and publish the occasion of our arms.
    the commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
    their over-greedy love hath surfeited.
    an habitation giddy and unsure
    hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.

  harcourt. from enemies heaven keep your majesty;
    and, when they stand against you, may they fall
    as those that i am come to tell you of!
    the earl northumberland and the lord bardolph,
    with a great power of english and of scots,
    are by the shrieve of yorkshire overthrown.

    will fortune never come with both hands full,
