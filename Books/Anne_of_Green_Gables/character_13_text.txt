and had to go out to alberta for his health and gilbert went with him.
they were there three years and gil didnâ€™t go to school hardly any
until they came back. you wonâ€™t find it so easy to keep head after this,
anne.â€

â€œiâ€™m glad,â€ said anne quickly. â€œi couldnâ€™t really feel proud of keeping
head of little boys and girls of just nine or ten. i got up yesterday
spelling â€˜ebullition.â€™ josie pye was head and, mind you, she peeped
in her book. mr. phillips didnâ€™t see her--he was looking at prissy
andrews--but i did. i just swept her a look of freezing scorn and she
got as red as a beet and spelled it wrong after all.â€

â€œthose pye girls are cheats all round,â€ said diana indignantly, as they
climbed the fence of the main road. â€œgertie pye actually went and put
her milk bottle in my place in the brook yesterday. did you ever? i
donâ€™t speak to her now.â€

anne stood there the rest of the afternoon with that legend above her.
she did not cry or hang her head. anger was still too hot in her heart
for that and it sustained her amid all her agony of humiliation. with
resentful eyes and passion-red cheeks she confronted alike dianaâ€™s
sympathetic gaze and charlie sloaneâ€™s indignant nods and josie pyeâ€™s
malicious smiles. as for gilbert blythe, she would not even look at him.
she would _never_ look at him again! she would never speak to him!!

when school was dismissed anne marched out with her red head held high.
gilbert blythe tried to intercept her at the porch door.

â€œiâ€™m awfully sorry i made fun of your hair, anne,â€ he whispered
contritely. â€œhonest i am. donâ€™t be mad for keeps, now.â€

anne swept by disdainfully, without look or sign of hearing. â€œoh
how could you, anne?â€

first of all carrie sloane dared ruby gillis to climb to a certain point
in the huge old willow tree before the front door; which ruby gillis,
albeit in mortal dread of the fat green caterpillars with which said
tree was infested and with the fear of her mother before her eyes if she
should tear her new muslin dress, nimbly did, to the discomfiture of the
aforesaid carrie sloane. then josie pye dared jane andrews to hop on her
left leg around the garden without stopping once or putting her right
foot to the ground; which jane andrews gamely tried to do, but gave out
at the third corner and had to confess herself defeated.

josieâ€™s triumph being rather more pronounced than good taste permitted,
anne shirley dared her to walk along the top of the board fence which
bounded the garden to the east. now, to â€œwalkâ€ board fences requires
more skill and steadiness of head and heel than o

ne might suppose who
has never tried it. but josie pye, if deficient in some qualities
that make for popularity, had at least a natural and inborn gift, duly
cultivated, for walking board fences. josie walked the barry fence with
an airy unconcern which seemed to imply that a little thing like that
wasnâ€™t worth a â€œdare.â€ reluctant admiration greeted her exploit, for
most of the other girls could appreciate it, having suffered many things
themselves in their efforts to walk fences. josie descended from her
perch, flushed with victory, and dart

â€œthen i dare you to do it,â€ said josie defiantly. â€œi dare you to climb
up there and walk the ridgepole of mr. barryâ€™s kitchen roof.â€

anne turned pale, but there was clearly only one thing to be done. she
walked toward the house, where a ladder was leaning against the kitchen
roof. all the fifth-class girls said, â€œoh!â€ partly in excitement, partly
in dismay.

â€œdonâ€™t you do it, anne,â€ entreated diana. â€œyouâ€™ll fall off and be
killed. never mind josie pye. it isnâ€™t fair to dare anybody to do
anything so dangerous.â€

â€œi must do it. my honor is at stake,â€ said anne solemnly. â€œi shall walk
that ridgepole, diana, or perish in the attempt. if i am killed you are
to have my pearl bead ring.â€

anne climbed the ladder amid breathless silence, gained the ridgepole,
balanced herself uprightly on that precarious footing, and started to
walk along it, dizzily conscious that she was uncomfortably high up
in the world and that walking ridgepoles w

nevertheless, when diana and the other
girls had rushed frantically around the house--except ruby gillis, who
remained as if rooted to the ground and went into hysterics--they found
anne lying all white and limp among the wreck and ruin of the virginia
creeper.

â€œanne, are you killed?â€ shrieked diana, throwing herself on her knees
beside her friend. â€œoh, anne, dear anne, speak just one word to me and
tell me if youâ€™re killed.â€

to the immense relief of all the girls, and especially of josie pye,
who, in spite of lack of imagination, had been seized with horrible
visions of a future branded as the girl who was the cause of anne
shirleyâ€™s early and tragic death, anne sat dizzily up and answered
uncertainly:

â€œno, diana, i am not killed, but i think i am rendered unconscious.â€

â€œwhere?â€ sobbed carrie sloane. â€œoh, where, anne?â€ before anne could
answer mrs. barry appeared on the scene. at sight of her anne tried to
scramble to her feet, but sank back again with a sharp littl

â€œand that is just why you should be sorry for me,â€ said anne, â€œbecause
the thought that it is all my own fault is what makes it so hard. if i
could blame it on anybody i would feel so much better. but what would
you have done, marilla, if you had been dared to walk a ridgepole?â€

â€œiâ€™d have stayed on good firm ground and let them dare away. such
absurdity!â€ said marilla.

anne sighed.

â€œbut you have such strength of mind, marilla. i havenâ€™t. i just felt
that i couldnâ€™t bear josie pyeâ€™s scorn. she would have crowed over me
all my life. and i think i have been punished so much that you neednâ€™t
be very cross with me, marilla. itâ€™s not a bit nice to faint, after all.
and the doctor hurt me dreadfully when he was setting my ankle. i wonâ€™t
be able to go around for six or seven weeks and iâ€™ll miss the new lady

times. isnâ€™t that something to be proud of, marilla? when a ministerâ€™s
wife has so many claims on her time! she is such a cheerful person to
have visit you, too. she never tells you itâ€™s your own fault and she
hopes youâ€™ll be a better girl on account of it. mrs. lynde always told
me that when she came to see me; and she said it in a kind of way that
made me feel she might hope iâ€™d be a better girl but didnâ€™t really
believe i would. even josie pye came to see me. i received her as
politely as i could, because i think she was sorry she dared me to walk
a ridgepole. if i had been killed she would had to carry a dark burden
of remorse all her life. diana has been a faithful friend. sheâ€™s been
over every day to cheer my lonely pillow. but oh, i shall be so glad
when i can go to school for iâ€™ve heard such exciting things about the
new teacher. the girls all think she is perfectly sweet. diana says she

has so little imagination. diana and ruby gillis and jane andrews are
preparing a dialogue, called â€˜a morning visit,â€™ for next friday. and the
friday afternoons they donâ€™t have recitations miss stacy takes them
all to the woods for a â€˜fieldâ€™ day and they study ferns and flowers
and birds. and they have physical culture exercises every morning and
evening. mrs. lynde says she never heard of such goings on and it all

flowing hair. iâ€™m to be hope, with my hands clasped--so--and my eyes
uplifted. iâ€™m going to practice my recitations in the garret. donâ€™t be
alarmed if you hear me groaning. i have to groan heartrendingly in one
of them, and itâ€™s really hard to get up a good artistic groan, marilla.
josie pye is sulky because she didnâ€™t get the part she wanted in
the dialogue. she wanted to be the fairy queen. that would have been
ridiculous, for who ever heard of a fairy queen as fat as josie? fairy
queens must be slender. jane andrews is to be the queen and i am to be
one of her maids of honor. josie says she thinks a red-haired fairy is
just as ridiculous as a fat one, but i do not let myself mind what josie
says. iâ€™m to have a wreath of white roses on my hair and ruby gillis

â€œi call it providential,â€ said diana. â€œyou wonâ€™t have to borrow rubyâ€™s

all the avonlea scholars were in a fever of excitement that day, for the
hall had to be decorated and a last grand rehearsal held.

little hall was crowded; all the performers did excellently well, but

lay awake and imagined the concert over and over again. thatâ€™s one
splendid thing about such affairs--itâ€™s so lovely to look back to them.â€

eventually, however, avonlea school slipped back into its old groove
and took up its old interests. to be sure, the concert left traces. ruby
gillis and emma white, who had quarreled over a point of precedence in
their platform seats, no longer sat at the same desk, and a promising
friendship of three years was broken up. josie pye and julia bell did
not â€œspeakâ€ for three months, because josie pye had told bessie wright
that julia bellâ€™s bow when she got up to recite made her think of a
chicken jerking its head, and bessie told julia. none of the sloanes
would have any dealings with the bells, because the bells had declared
that the sloanes had too much to do in the program, and the sloanes had
retorted that the bells were not capable of doing the little they had to
do properly. finally, charlie sloane fought moody

â€œruby gillis says she means to have a beau as soon as sheâ€™s fifteen,â€
 said diana.

â€œruby gillis thinks of nothing but beaus,â€ said anne disdainfully.
â€œsheâ€™s actually delighted when anyone writes her name up in a
take-notice for all she pretends to be so mad. but iâ€™m afraid that is an
uncharitable speech. mrs. allan says we should never make uncharitable
speeches; but they do slip out so often before you think, donâ€™t they? i
simply canâ€™t talk about josie pye without making an uncharitable speech,
so i never mention her at all. you may have noticed that. iâ€™m trying to
be as much like mrs. allan as i possibly can, for i think sheâ€™s perfect.
mr. allan thinks so too. mrs. lynde says he just worships the ground she
treads on and she doesnâ€™t really think it right for a minister to
set his affections so much on a mortal being. but then, diana, even
ministers are human and have their besetting sins just like everybody
else. i had such an interesting

ached in other respects.

â€œoh, marilla, what shall i do?â€ questioned anne in tears. â€œi can never
live this down. people have pretty well forgotten my other mistakes--the
liniment cake and setting diana drunk and flying into a temper with
mrs. lynde. but theyâ€™ll never forget this. they will think i am not
respectable. oh, marilla, â€˜what a tangled web we weave when first we
practice to deceive.â€™ that is poetry, but it is true. and oh, how josie
pye will laugh! marilla, i _cannot_ face josie pye. i am the unhappiest
girl in prince edward island.â€

anneâ€™s unhappiness continued for a week. during that time she went
nowhere and shampooed her hair every day. diana alone of outsiders knew
the fatal secret, but she promised solemnly never to tell, and it may
be stated here and now that she kept her word. at the end of the week
marilla said decidedly:

must be cut off; there is no other way. you canâ€™t go out with

 so many more things you can

their sojourn in town was something that anne and diana dated from for
years. from first to last it was crowded with delights.

on wednesday miss barry took them to the exhibition grounds and kept
them there all day.

â€œit was splendid,â€ anne related to marilla later on. â€œi never imagined
anything so interesting. i donâ€™t really know which department was the
most interesting. i think i liked the horses and the flowers and the
fancywork best. josie pye took first prize for knitted lace. i was
real glad she did. and i was glad that i felt glad, for it shows iâ€™m
improving, donâ€™t you think, marilla, when i can rejoice in josieâ€™s
success? mr. harmon andrews took second prize for gravenstein apples
and mr. bell took first prize for a pig. diana said she thought it was
ridiculous for a sunday-school superintendent to take a prize in pigs,
but i donâ€™t see why. do you? she said she would always think of it after
this when he was praying so so

history open on my desk lid and then tucked ben hur between the desk and
my knee. i just looked as if i were studying canadian history, you know,
while all the while i was reveling in ben hur. i was so interested in it
that i never noticed miss stacy coming down the aisle until all at
once i just looked up and there she was looking down at me, so
reproachful-like. i canâ€™t tell you how ashamed i felt, marilla,
especially when i heard josie pye giggling. miss stacy took ben hur
away, but she never said a word then. she kept me in at recess and
talked to me. she said i had done very wrong in two respects. first, i
was wasting the time i ought to have put on my studies; and secondly,
i was deceiving my teacher in trying to make it appear i was reading a
history when it was a storybook instead. i had never realized until that
moment, marilla, that what i was doing was deceitful. i was shocked. i
cried bitterly, and asked miss stacy to fo

 more interest than ever in my studies now,â€ said anne
blissfully, â€œbecause i have a purpose in life. mr. allan says everybody
should have a purpose in life and pursue it faithfully. only he says
we must first make sure that it is a worthy purpose. i would call it a
worthy purpose to want to be a teacher like miss stacy, wouldnâ€™t you,
marilla? i think itâ€™s a very noble profession.â€

the queenâ€™s class was organized in due time. gilbert blythe, anne
shirley, ruby gillis, jane andrews, josie pye, charlie sloane, and moody
spurgeon macpherson joined it. diana barry did not, as her parents
did not intend to send her to queenâ€™s. this seemed nothing short of a
calamity to anne. never, since the night on which minnie may had had the
croup, had she and diana been separated in anything. on the evening when
the queenâ€™s class first remained in school for the extra lessons and
anne saw diana go slowly out with the others, to walk home alone through
the birch path and violet vale, it was all

came into her throat, and she hastily retired behind the pages of her
uplifted latin grammar to hide the tears in her eyes. not for worlds

â€œbut, oh, marilla, i really felt that i had tasted the bitterness of
death, as mr. allan said in his sermon last sunday, when i saw diana go
out alone,â€ she said mournfully that night. â€œi thought how splendid it
would have been if diana had only been going to study for the entrance,

through, and then she intends to be married. jane says she will devote
her whole life to teaching, and never, never marry, because you are paid
a salary for teaching, but a husband wonâ€™t pay you anything, and growls
if you ask for a share in the egg and butter money. i expect jane speaks
from mournful experience, for mrs. lynde says that her father is a
perfect old crank, and meaner than second skimmings. josie pye says she
is just going to college for educationâ€™s sake, because she wonâ€™t have to
earn her own living; she says of course it is different with orphans who
are living on charity--_they_ have to hustle. moody spurgeon is going to
be a minister. mrs. lynde says he couldnâ€™t be anything else with a name
like that to live up to. i hope it isnâ€™t wicked of me, marilla, but
really the thought of moody spurgeon being a minister makes me laugh.

â€œbut youâ€™ve done good work this past year,â€ miss stacy told them on the
last evening, â€œand you deserve a good, jolly vacation. have the best
time you can in the out-of-door world and lay in a good stock of health

â€œare you going to be back next year, miss stacy?â€ asked josie pye.

josie pye never scrupled to ask questions; in this instance the rest of
the class felt grateful to her; none of them would have dared to ask
it of miss stacy, but all wanted to, for there had been alarming rumors
running at large through the school for some time that miss stacy was
not coming back the next year--that she had been offered a position
in the grade school of her own home district and meant to accept. the
queenâ€™s class listened in breathless suspense for her answer.

you can.â€™ after all, i dare say iâ€™ll be back next year. this is one
of the times i _know_ iâ€™m not going to pass. theyâ€™re getting alarmingly
frequent.â€

â€œwhy, you came out splendidly in the exams miss stacy gave.â€

â€œyes, but those exams didnâ€™t make me nervous. when i think of the real
thing you canâ€™t imagine what a horrid cold fluttery feeling comes round
my heart. and then my number is thirteen and josie pye says itâ€™s so
unlucky. i am _not_ superstitious and i know it can make no difference.
but still i wish it wasnâ€™t thirteen.â€

â€œi do wish i was going in with you,â€ said diana. â€œwouldnâ€™t we have
a perfectly elegant time? but i suppose youâ€™ll have to cram in the
evenings.â€

it would only tire and confuse us and we are to go out walking and not

â€œthis morning miss stacy came for me and we went to the academy, calling
for jane and ruby and josie on our way. ruby asked me to feel her hands
and they were as cold as ice. josie said i looked as if i hadnâ€™t slept
a wink and she didnâ€™t believe i was strong enough to stand the grind
of the teacherâ€™s course even if i did get through. there are times and
seasons even yet when i donâ€™t feel that iâ€™ve made any great headway in
learning to like josie pye!

â€œwhen we reached the academy there were scores of students there from
all over the island. the first person we saw was moody spurgeon sitting
on the steps and muttering away to himself. jane asked him what on earth
he was doing and he said he was repeating the multiplication table over
and over to steady his nerves and for pityâ€™s sake not to interrupt
him, because if he stopped for a moment he got frightened and forgot
everything he ever knew, but the multiplication table kept all his fac

xaminations. so had gilbert. they had met and passed each other on the
street a dozen times without any sign of recognition and every time anne
had held her head a little higher and wished a little more earnestly
that she had made friends with gilbert when he asked her, and vowed a
little more determinedly to surpass him in the examination. she knew
that all avonlea junior was wondering which would come out first; she
even knew that jimmy glover and ned wright had a bet on the question
and that josie pye had said there was no doubt in the world that gilbert
would be first; and she felt that her humiliation would be unbearable if
she failed.

but she had another and nobler motive for wishing to do well. she wanted
to â€œpass highâ€ for the sake of matthew and marilla--especially matthew.
matthew had declared to her his conviction that she â€œwould beat the
whole island.â€ that, anne felt, was something it would be foolish to
hope for even in the wildest dreams. but she did hope fervently that

but suddenly, as her dilated, frightened eyes gazed out over the
audience, she saw gilbert blythe away at the back of the room, bending
forward with a smile on his face--a smile which seemed to anne at once
triumphant and taunting. in reality it was nothing of the kind. gilbert
was merely smiling with appreciation of the whole affair in general and
of the effect produced by anneâ€™s slender white form and spiritual face
against a background of palms in particular. josie pye, whom he had
driven over, sat beside him, and her face certainly was both triumphant
and taunting. but anne did not see josie, and would not have cared if
she had. she drew a long breath and flung her head up proudly, courage
and determination tingling over her like an electric shock. she _would
not_ fail before gilbert blythe--he should never be able to laugh at her,
never, never! her fright and nervousness vanished; and she began her
recitation, her clear, sweet voice reaching to the farthest

she is a professional, and iâ€™m only a schoolgirl, with a little knack
of reciting. iâ€™m quite satisfied if the people just liked mine pretty
well.â€

â€œiâ€™ve a compliment for you, anne,â€ said diana. â€œat least i think it
must be a compliment because of the tone he said it in. part of it
was anyhow. there was an american sitting behind jane and me--such a
romantic-looking man, with coal-black hair and eyes. josie pye says he
is a distinguished artist, and that her motherâ€™s cousin in boston is
married to a man that used to go to school with him. well, we heard
him say--didnâ€™t we, jane?--â€˜who is that girl on the platform with the
splendid titian hair? she has a face i should like to paint.â€™ there now,
anne. but what does titian hair mean?â€

â€œbeing interpreted it means plain red, i guess,â€ laughed anne. â€œtitian
was a very famous artist who liked to paint red-haired women.â€

home by now--and marilla is at the gate, looking down the lane for
him--six--seven--eight--oh, thereâ€™s no use in counting them! theyâ€™re
coming in a flood presently. i canâ€™t cheer up--i donâ€™t _want_ to cheer up.
itâ€™s nicer to be miserable!â€

the flood of tears would have come, no doubt, had not josie pye appeared
at that moment. in the joy of seeing a familiar face anne forgot that
there had never been much love lost between her and josie. as a part of
avonlea life even a pye was welcome.

â€œiâ€™m so glad you came up,â€ anne said sincerely.

â€œyouâ€™ve been crying,â€ remarked josie, with aggravating pity. â€œi suppose
youâ€™re homesick--some people have so little self-control in that
respect. iâ€™ve no intention of being homesick, i can tell you. townâ€™s too

asked me who the red-headed girl was. i told him you were an orphan that
the cuthberts had adopted, and nobody knew very much about what youâ€™d

anne was wondering if, after all, solitude and tears were not more
satisfactory than josie pyeâ€™s companionship when jane and ruby appeared,
each with an inch of queenâ€™s color ribbon--purple and scarlet--pinned
proudly to her coat. as josie was not â€œspeakingâ€ to jane just then she
had to subside into comparative harmlessness.

â€œwell,â€ said jane with a sigh, â€œi feel as if iâ€™d lived many moons since

rose--why, itâ€™s a song and a hope and a prayer all in one. and itâ€™s _good_
to see you again, diana!â€

â€œi thought you liked that stella maynard better than me,â€ said
diana reproachfully. â€œjosie pye told me you did. josie said you were
_infatuated_ with her.â€

anne laughed and pelted diana with the faded â€œjune liliesâ€ of her
bouquet.

â€œstella maynard is the dearest girl in the world except one and you are
that one, diana,â€ she said. â€œi love you more than ever--and iâ€™ve so many
things to tell you. but just now i feel as if it were joy enough to sit
here and look at you. iâ€™m tired, i think--tired of being studious and
ambitious. i mean to spend at least two hours tomorrow lyi

orchard grass, thinking of absolutely nothing.â€

â€œyouâ€™ve done splendidly, anne. i suppose you wonâ€™t be teaching now that
youâ€™ve won the avery?â€

â€œno. iâ€™m going to redmond in september. doesnâ€™t it seem wonderful? iâ€™ll
have a brand new stock of ambition laid in by that time after three
glorious, golden months of vacation. jane and ruby are going to teach.
isnâ€™t it splendid to think we all got through even to moody spurgeon and
josie pye?â€

diana. â€œgilbert blythe is going to teach, too. he has to. his father
canâ€™t afford to send him to college next year, after all, so he means
to earn his own way through. i expect heâ€™ll get the school here if miss
ames decides to leave.â€

anne felt a queer little sensation of dismayed surprise. she had not

also. what would she do without their i

used to be to me--but i
donâ€™t laugh _much_, because it was a very real trouble then. i did suffer
terribly over my hair and my freckles. my freckles are really gone; and
people are nice enough to tell me my hair is auburn now--all but josie
pye. she informed me yesterday that she really thought it was redder
than ever, or at least my black dress made it look redder, and she asked
me if people who had red hair ever got used to having it. marilla, iâ€™ve
almost decided to give up trying to like josie pye. iâ€™ve made what i
would once have called a heroic effort to like her, but josie pye wonâ€™t
_be_ liked.â€

â€œjosie is a pye,â€ said marilla sharply, â€œso she canâ€™t help being
disagreeable. i suppose people of that kind serve some useful purpose in
society, but i must say i donâ€™t know what it is any more than i know the
use of thistles. is josie going to teach?â€

â€œno, she is going back to queenâ€™s next year. so are moody spurgeon and
charlie sloane. jane and ruby are going to teac
