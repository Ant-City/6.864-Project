ich such a visitation had fallen on a child. the case, i
may mention, was that of an apparition in just such an old house as had
gathered us for the occasion--an appearance, of a dreadful kind, to a
little boy sleeping in the room with his mother and waking her up in the
terror of it; waking her not to dissipate his dread and soothe him to
sleep again, but to encounter also, herself, before she had succeeded
in doing so, the same sight that had shaken him. it was this observation
that drew from douglas--not immediately, but later in the evening--a
reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention.
someone else told a story not particularly effective, which i saw he was
not following. this i took for a sign that he had himself something to
produce and that we should only have to wait. we waited in fact till two
nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out
what was in his mind.

“i quite agree--in regard to griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was--

that
its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a
particular touch. but it’s not the first occurrence of its charming
kind that i know to have involved a child. if the child gives the effect
another turn of the screw, what do you say to two children--?”

“we say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that they give two turns! also
that we want to hear about them.”

i can see douglas there before the fire, to which he had got up to
present his back, looking down at his interlocutor with his hands in
his pockets. “nobody but me, till now, has ever heard. it’s quite too
horrible.” this, naturally, was declared by several voices to give the
thing the utmost price, and our friend, with quiet art, prepared his
triumph by turning his eyes over the rest of us and going on: “it’s
beyond everything. nothing at all that i know touches it.”

“for sheer terror?” i remem

 then; after dinner--”

“you’ll all meet me here?” he looked us round again. “isn’t anybody
going?” it was almost the tone of hope.

“everybody will stay!”

“_i_ will”--and “_i_ will!” cried the ladies whose departure had been
fixed. mrs. griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more
light. “who was it she was in love with?”

“the story will tell,” i took upon myself to reply.

“oh, i can’t wait for the story!”

“the story won’t tell,” said douglas; “not in any literal, vulgar way.”

“more’s the pity, then. that’s the only way i ever understand.”

“won’t you tell, douglas?” somebody else inquired.

he sprang to his feet again. “yes--tomorrow. now i must go to bed.
good night.” and quickly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly
bewildered. from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on
the stair; whereupon mrs. griffin spoke. “well, if i don’t know who she
was in love with, i know who he was.”

fixed. then he became as communicative as we could desire and
indeed gave us his best reason for being so. we had it from him again
before the fire in the hall, as we had had our mild wonders of the
previous night. it appeared that the narrative he had promised to read
us really required for a proper intelligence a few words of prologue.
let me say here distinctly, to have done with it, that this narrative,
from an exact transcript of my own made much later, is what i shall
presently give. poor douglas, before his death--when it was in
sight--committed to me the manuscript that reached him on the third of
these days and that, on the same spot, with immense effect, he began
to read to our hushed little circle on the night of the fourth. the
departing ladies who had said they would stay didn’t, of course, thank
heaven, stay: they departed, in consequence of arrangements made, in a
rage of curiosity, as they professed, produced by the touches with
which he had already worked us up. but that on

irst a young lady whom they had had the
misfortune to lose. she had done for them quite beautifully--she was a
most respectable person--till her death, the great awkwardness of which
had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little miles.
mrs. grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as
she could for flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a
dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise
thoroughly respectable.

so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.
“and what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?”

our friend’s answer was prompt. “that will come out. i don’t
anticipate.”

“excuse me--i thought that was just what you are doing.”

“in her successor’s place,” i suggested, “i should have wished to learn
if the office brought with it--”

“necessary danger to life?” douglas completed my thought. “she did wish
to learn, and she did learn. you

 shall hear tomorrow what she learned.
meanwhile, of course, the prospect struck her as slightly grim. she was
young, untried, nervous: it was a vision of serious duties and little
company, of really great loneliness. she hesitated--took a couple of
days to consult and consider. but the salary offered much exceeded
her modest measure, and on a second interview she faced the music, she
engaged.” and douglas, with this, made a pause that, for the benefit of
the company, moved me to throw in--

“the moral of which was of course the seduction exercised by the
splendid young man. she succumbed to it.”

he got up and, as he had done the night before, went to the fire, gave
a stir to a log with his foot, then stood a moment with his back to us.
“she saw him only twice.”

“yes, but that’s just the beauty of her passion.”

a little to my surprise, on this, douglas turned round to me. “it w

never saw him again.”

“oh!” said the lady; which, as our friend immediately left us again, was
the only other word of importance contributed to the subject till, the
next night, by the corner of the hearth, in the best chair, he opened
the faded red cover of a thin old-fashioned gilt-edged album. the whole
thing took indeed more nights than one, but on the first occasion the
same lady put another question. “what is your title?”

“i haven’t one.”

“oh, _i_ have!” i said. but douglas, without heeding me, had begun to
read with a fine clearness that was like a rendering to the ear of the
beauty of his author’s hand.

i remember the whole beginning as a succession of flights and drops, a
little seesaw of the right throbs and the wrong. after rising, in town,
to meet his appeal, i had at all events a couple of very bad days--found
myself doubtful again, felt indeed sure i had made a mistake. in this
state of mind i spent the long hours of bumping, swinging coach that
