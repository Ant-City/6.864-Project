[CHARACTER] - 
      an athenian citizen and harried father, burdened by the debts his son, pheidippides, has incurred. [CHARACTER] is the "hero" of the play, but he is not very heroic. he is concerned instead with pursuing his dishonest aim: shirking his debts instead of taking responsibility for them. therefore, [CHARACTER] is more of an "anti-hero." he does not have the subtle, esoteric mind that it takes to succeed at the school, but rather frustrates socrates and the other students at the school with his stubbornness, his violence, and his limited, literal mind. he is a pragmatist, not a philosopher, and as such he is rooted in the physical world, happiest delivering a sound beating or masturbating. because of his bumbling, brutish physicality, he is a fitting foil to socrates's pure intellectualism.
