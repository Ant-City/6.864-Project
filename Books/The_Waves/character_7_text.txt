'i see a ring,' said bernard, 'hanging above me. it quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'

'i see a slab of pale yellow,' said susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'

'i hear a sound,' said rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'

'i see a globe,' said neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'

'i see a crimson tassel,' said jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'i hear something stamping,' said louis. 'a great beast's foot is chained. it stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'

'the leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears,' said susan.

'a shadow falls on the path,' said louis, 'like an elbow bent.'

'islands of light are swimming on the grass,' said rhoda. 'they have fallen through the trees.'

'the birds' eyes are bright in the tunnels between the leaves,' said neville.

'the stalks are covered with harsh, short hairs,' said jinny, 'and drops of water have stuck to them.'

'a caterpillar is curled in a green ring,' said susan, 'notched with blunt feet.'

'and burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said louis.

'stones are cold to my feet,' said neville. 'i feel each one, round or pointed, separately.'

'the back of my hand burns,' said jinny, 'but the palm is clammy and damp with dew.'

'now the cock crows like a spurt of hard, red water in the white tide,' said bernard.

'birds are singing up and down and in and out all round us,' said susan.

'the beast stamps; the elephant with its foot chained; the great brute on the beach stamps,' said louis.

'look at the house,' said jinny, 'with all its windows white with blinds.'

'cold water begins to run from the scullery tap,' said rhoda, 'over the mackerel in the bowl.'

'the walls are cracked with gold cracks,' said bernard, 'and there are blue, finger-shaped shadows of leaves beneath the windows.'

'bubbles form on the floor of the saucepan,' said jinny. 'then they rise, quicker and quicker, in a silver chain to the top.'

'now billy scrapes the fish-scales with a jagged knife on to a wooden board,' said neville.

'the dining-room window is dark blue now,' said bernard, 'and the air ripples above the chimneys.'

'a swallow is perched on the lightning-conductor,' said susan. 'and biddy has smacked down the bucket on the kitchen flags.'

'that is the first stroke of the church bell,' said louis. 'then the others follow; one, two; one, two; one, two.'

'look at the table-cloth, flying white along the table,' said rhoda. 'now there are rounds of white china, and silver streaks beside each plate.'

'suddenly a bee booms in my ear,' said neville. 'it is here; it is past.'

'i was running,' said jinny, 'after breakfast. i saw leaves moving in a hole in the hedge. i thought "that is a bird on its nest." i parted them and looked; but there was no bird on a nest. the leaves went on moving. i was frightened. i ran past susan, past rhoda, and neville and bernard in the tool-house talking. i cried as i ran, faster and faster. what moved the leaves? what moves my heart, my legs? and i dashed in here, seeing you green as a bush, like a branch, very still, louis, with your eyes fixed. "is he dead?" i thought, and kissed you, with my heart jumping under my pink frock like the leaves, which go on moving, though there is nothing to move them. now i smell geraniums; i smell earth mould. i dance. i ripple. i am thrown over y

'she has passed the tool-house door with her handkerchief screwed into a ball. she was not crying, but her eyes, which are so beautiful, were narrow as cats' eyes before they spring. i shall follow her, neville. i shall go gently behind her, to be at hand, with my curiosity, to comfort her when she bursts out in a rage and thinks, "i am alone."

'i saw her kiss him,' said susan. 'i looked between the leaves and saw her. she danced in flecked with diamonds light as dust. and i am squat, bernard, i am short. i have eyes that look close to the ground and see insects in the grass. the yellow warmth in my side turned to stone when i saw jinny kiss louis. i shall eat grass and die in a ditch in th

'i love,' said susan, 'and i hate. i desire one thing only. my eyes are hard. jinny's eyes break into a thousand lights. rhoda's are like those pale flowers to which moths come in the evening. yours grow full and brim and never break. but i am already set on my pursuit. i see insects in the grass. though my mother still knits white socks for me and hems pinafores and i am a child, i love and i hate.'

'but when we sit together, close,' said bernard, 'we melt into each other with phrases. we are edged with mist. we

'i see the beetle,' said susan. 'it is black, i see; it is green, i see; i am tied down with single words. but you wander off; you slip away; you rise up higher, with words and words in phrases.'

'now,' said bernard, 'let us explore. there is the white house lying among the trees. it lies down there ever so far beneath us. we shall sink like swimmers just touching the ground with the tips of their toes. we shall sink through the green air of the leaves, susan. we sink as we run. the waves close over us, the beech leaves meet above our heads. there is the stable clock with its gilt hands shining. those are the flats and heights of the roofs of the great house. there is the stable-boy clattering in the yard in rubber boots. that is elvedon.

'i see the lady writing. i see the gardeners sweeping,' said susan. 'if we died here, nobody would bury us.'

'run!' said bernard. 'run! the gardener with the black beard has seen us! we shall be shot! we shall be shot like jays and pinned to the wall! we are in a hostile country. we must escape to the beech wood. we must hide under the trees. i turned a twig as we came. there is a secret path. bend as low as you can. follow without looking back. they will think we are foxes. run!

'where is bernard?' said neville. 'he has my knife. we were in the tool-shed making boats, and susan came past the door. and bernard dropped his boat and went after her taking my knife, the sharp one that cuts the keel. he is like a dangling wire, a broken bell-pull, always twangling. he is like the seaweed hung outside the window, damp now, now dry. he leaves me in the lurch; he follows susan; and if susan cries he will take my knife and tell her stories. the big blade is an emperor; the broken blade a negro. i hate dangling things; i hate dampish things. i hate wandering and mixing things to

'those are white words,' said susan, 'like stones one picks up by the seashore.'

'we must form into pairs,' said susan, 'and walk in order, not shuffling our feet, not lagging, with louis going first to lead us, because louis is alert and not a wool-gatherer.'

'i saw florrie in the kitchen garden,' said susan, 'as we came back from our walk, with the washing blown out round her, the pyjamas, the drawers, the night-gowns blown tight. and ernest kissed her. he was in his green baize apron, cleaning silver; and his mouth was sucked like a purse in wrinkles and he seized her with the pyjamas blown out hard between them. he was blind as a bull, and she swooned in anguish, only little veins streaking her white cheeks red. now though they pass plates of bread and butter and cups of milk at tea-time i see a

'this is my first night at school,' said susan, 'away from my father, away from my home. my eyes swell; my eyes prick with tears. i hate the smell of pine and linoleum. i hate the wind-bitten shrubs and the sanitary tiles. i hate the cheerful jokes and the glazed look of everyone. i left my squirrel and my doves for the boy to look after. the kitchen door slams, and shot patters among the leaves when percy fires at the rooks. all here is false; all is meretricious. rhoda and jinny sit far off in brown serge, and look at miss lambert who sit

'i hate the small looking-glass on the stairs,' said jinny. 'it shows our heads only; it cuts off our heads. and my lips are too wide, and my eyes are too close together; i show my gums too much when i laugh. susan's head, with its fell look, with its grass-green eyes which poets will love, bernard said, because they fall upon close white stitching, put mine out; even rhoda's face, mooning, vacant, is completed, like those white petals she used to swim in her bowl. so i skip up the stairs past them, to the next landing, where the long glass hangs and i see myself entire. i see my body and head in one now; for even in this serge frock they are one, my body and my head. look, when i move my head i ripple al

'we are late,' said susan. we must wait our turn to play. we will pitch here in the long grass and pretend to watch jinny and clara, betty and mavis. but we will not watch them. i hate watching other people play games. i will make images of all the things i hate most and bury them in the ground. this shiny pebble is madame carlo, and i will bury her deep because of her fawning and ingratiating manners, because of the sixpence she gave me for keeping my knuckles flat when i played my scales. i buried her sixpence. i woul

'i have torn off the whole of may and june,' said susan, 'and twenty days of july. i have torn them off and screwed them up so that they no longer exist, save as a weight in my side. they have been crippled days, like moths with shrivelled wings unable to fly. there are only eight days left. in eight days' time i shall get out of the train and stand on the platform at six twenty five. then my freedom will unfurl, and all these restrictions that wrinkle and shrivel--hours and order and discipline, and being here and there exactly at the right moment-

'susan, i respect; because she sits stitching. she sews under a quiet lamp in a house where the corn sighs close to the window and gives me safety. for i am the weakest, the youngest of them all. i am a child looking at his feet and the little runnels that the stream has made in the gravel. that is a snail, i say; that is a leaf. i delight in the snails; i delight in the leaf, i am always the youngest, the most innocent, the most trustful. you are all protected. i am naked. when the waitress with the

'now the wind lifts the blind,' said susan, 'jars, bowls, matting and the shabby arm-chair with the hole in it are now become distinct. the usual faded ribbons sprinkle the wallpaper. the bird chorus is over, only one bird now sings close to the bedroom window. i will pull on my stockings and go quietly past the bedroom doors, and down through the kitchen, out through the garden past the greenhouse into the field. it is still early morning. the mist is on the marshes. the day is stark and stiff as a linen shroud. but it will soften; it

'the door opens, but he does not come. that is louis hesitating there. that is his strange mixture of assurance and timidity. he looks at himself in the looking-glass as he comes in; he touches his hair; he is dissatisfied with his appearance. he says, "i am a duke--the last of an ancient race." he is acrid, suspicious, domineering, difficult (i am comparing him with percival). at the same time he is formidable, for there is laughter in his eyes. he has seen me. here he is.'

'there is susan,' said louis. 'she does not see us. she has not dressed, because she despises the futility of london. she stands for a moment at the swing-door, looking about her like a creature dazed by the light of a lamp. now she moves. she has the stealthy yet assured movements (even among tables and chairs) of a wild beast. she seems to find her way by instinct in and out among these little tables, touching no one, disregarding waiters, yet comes straight to our table in the corner. when she sees us (nevi

'rhoda comes now, from nowhere, having slipped in while we were not looking. she must have made a tortuous course, taking cover now behind a waiter, now behind some ornamental pillar, so as to put off as long as possible the shock of recognition, so as to be secure for one more moment to r

'the door opens, the door goes on opening,' said neville, 'yet he does not come.'

'there is jinny,' said susan. 'she stands in the door. everything seems stayed. the waiter stops. the diners at the table by the door look. she seems to centre everything; round her tables, lines of doors, windows, ceilings, ray themselves, like rays round the star in the middle of a smashed window-pane. she brings things to a point, to order. now she sees us, and moves, and all the rays ripple and flow and waver over us, bringing in new tides of sensation. we change. louis puts his hand to his tie. neville, who sits waiti

'the swing-door goes on opening,' said rhoda. 'strangers keep on coming, people we shall never see again, people who brush us disagreeably with their familiarity, their indifference, and the sense of a world continuing without us. we cannot sink down, we cannot forget our faces. even i who have no face, who make no difference when i come in (susan and jinny change bodies and faces), flutter unattached, without anchorage anywhere, unconsolidated, incapable of composing any blankness or continuity or wall against which these bodies move. it is because of neville and his misery. the sharp breath of his misery scatters my being. nothing can settle; nothing can subside. every time the door opens he looks fixedly at the table--he dare not raise his eyes--then looks for one second and says, "he has not come." but here he is.'

'here is percival,' said bernard, 'smoothing his hair, not from vanity (he does not look in the glass), but to propitiate the god of decency. he is conventional; he is a hero. the little boys trooped after him across the playing-fields. they blew their noses as he blew his nose, but unsuccessfully, for he is percival. now, when he is about to leave us, to go to india, all these trifles come together. he is a hero. oh yes, that is not to be denied, and when he takes his seat by susan, whom he loves, the occasion is crowned. we who yelped like jackals biting at each other's heels now assume the sober and confident air of soldiers in the presence of their captain. we who have been separated by our youth (the oldest is not yet twenty-five), who have sung like eager birds each his own song and tapped with the remorseless and savage egotism of the young our own snail-shell till it cracked (i am engaged), or perched solitary outside some bedroom window and sang of love, of fame a

'now let us say, brutally and directly, what is in our minds,' said neville. 'our isolation, our preparation, is over. the furtive days of secrecy and hiding, the revelations on staircases, moments of terror and ecstasy.'

'old mrs constable lifted her sponge and warmth poured over us,' said bernard. 'we became clothed in this changing, this feeling garment of flesh.'

'the boot-boy made love to the scullery-maid in the kitchen garden,' said susan, 'among the blown-out washing.'

'the breath of the wind was like a tiger panting,' said rhoda.

'bells rang punctually,' said susan, 'maids scuffled and giggled. there was a drawing in of chairs and a drawing out of chairs on the linoleum. but from one attic there was a blue view, a distant view of a field unstained by the corruption of this regimented, unreal existence.'

'down from our heads veils fell,' said rhoda. 'we clasped the flowers with their green leaves rustling in garlands.'

'but here and now we are together,' said bernard. 'we have come together, at a particular time, to this particular spot. we are drawn into this communion by some deep, some common emotion. shall we call it, conveniently, "love"? shall we say "love of percival" because percival is going to india?

'no, that is too small, too particular a name. we cannot attach the width and spread of our feelings to so small a mark. we have come together (from the north, from the south, from susan's farm, from louis' house of business) to make one thing, not enduring--for what endures?--but seen by many eyes simultaneously. there is a red carnation in that vase. a single flower as we sat here waiting, but now a seven-sided flower, many-petalled, red, puce, purple-shaded, stiff with silver-tinted leaves--a whole flower to which every eye brings its own contribution.

'it is hate, it is love,' said susan. that is the furious coal-black stream that makes us dizzy if we look down into it. we stand on a ledge here, but if we look down we turn giddy.'

'it is love,' said jinny, 'it is hate, such as susan feels for me because i kissed louis once in the garden; because equipped as i am, i make her think when i come in, "my hands are red," and hide them. but our hatred is almost indistinguishable from our love.'

'yes, between your shoulders, over your heads, to a landscape,' said rhoda, 'to a hollow where the many-backed steep hills come down like birds' wings folded. there, on the short, firm turf, are bushes, dark leaved, and against their darkness i see a shape, white, but not of stone, moving, perhaps alive. but it is not you, it is not you, it is not you; not percival, susan, jinny, neville or louis. when the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright--a column; now a fountain, falling. it makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. behind it roars the sea. it is beyond our reach. yet there i venture. there i go to replenish my emptiness, to stretch my nights and fill them fuller and fuller with dreams. and for a second even now, even here, i reach my object and say, "wander no more. all else is trial and make-believe. here is the

'but his slippers?' said neville. 'and his voice downstairs in the hall? and catching sight of him when he does not see one? one waits and he does not come. it gets later and later. he has forgotten. he is with someone else. he is faithless, his love meant nothing. oh, then the agony--then the intolerable despair! and t

'how proudly we sit here,' said jinny, 'we who are not yet twenty-five! outside the trees flower; outside the women linger; outside the cabs swerve and sweep. emerged from the tentative ways, the obscurities and dazzle of youth, we look straight in front of us, ready for what may come (the door opens, the door keeps on opening). all is real; all is firm without shadow or illusion. beauty rides our brows. there is mine, there is susan's. our flesh is firm and cool. our differences are clear-cut as the shadows of rocks in full sunlight. beside us lie crisp rolls, yellow-glazed and hard; the table-cloth is white; and our hands lie half curled, ready to contract. days and days are to come; winter days, summer days; we have scarcely broken into our hoard. now the fruit is swollen beneath the leaf. the room is golden, and i say to him, "come".'

'for you,' said bernard, 'but yesterday i walked bang into a pillar-box. yesterday i became engaged.'

'how strange,' said susan, 'the little heaps of sugar look by the side of our plates. also the mottled peelings of pears, and the plush rims to the looking-glasses. i had not seen them before. everything is now set; everything is fixed. bernard is engaged. something irrevocable has happened. a circle has been cast on the waters; a chain is imposed. we shall never flow freely again.'

'they are immune,' said rhoda, 'from picking fingers and searching eyes. how easily they turn and glance; what poses they take of energy and pride! what life shines in jinny's eyes; how fell, how entire susan's glance is, searching for insects at the roots! their hair shines lustrous. their eyes burn like the eyes of animals brushing through leaves on the scent of the prey. the circle is destroyed. we are thrown asunder.'

'week-days are in it,' said susan, 'monday, tuesday, wednesday; the horses going up to the fields, and the horses returning; the rooks rising and falling, and catching the elm-trees in their net, whether it is april, whether it is november.'

'what is to come is in it,' said bernard. 'that is the last drop and the brightest that we let fall like some supernal quicksilver into the swelling and splendid moment created by us from percival. what is to come? i ask, brushing the crumbs from my waistcoat, what is outside? we have prov

"more than he loved susan?" susan, engaged to her farmer in the country, will stand for a second with the telegram before her, holding a plate; and then, with a kick of her heel, slam to the oven door. neville, after staring at the window through his tears, will see through his tears, and ask, "who passes the window?"--"what lovely boy?" this is my tribute to percival; withered violets, blackened violets.

'when someone comes in at breakfast, even the embroidered fruit on my curtain swells so that parrots can peck it; one can break it off between one's thumb and finger. the thin, skimmed milk of early morning turns opal, blue, rose. at that hour your husband--the man who slapped his gaiters, pointing with his whip at the barren cow--grumbles. you say nothing. you see nothing. custom blinds your eyes. at that hour your relationship is mute, null, dun-coloured. mine at that hour is warm and vario

'but there was another glory once, when we watched for the door to open, and percival came; when we flung ourselves unattached on the edge of a hard bench in a public room.'

'there was the beech wood,' said susan, 'elvedon, and the gilt hands of the clock sparkling among the trees. the pigeons broke the leaves. the changing travelling lights wandered over me. they escaped me. yet look, neville, whom i discredit in order to be myself, at my hand on the table. look at the gradations of healthy colour here on the knuckles, here on the palm. my body has been used daily, rightly, like a tool by a good workman, all over. the blade is clean, sharp, worn in the centre.

'here in this dining-room you see the antlers and the tumblers; the salt-cellars; the yellow stains on the tablecloth. "waiter!" says bernard. "bread!" says susan. and the waiter comes; he brings bread. but i see the side of a cup like a mountain and only parts of antlers, and the brightness on the side of that jug like a crack in darkness with wonder and terror. your voices sound like trees creaking in a forest. so with your faces and their prominences and hollows. how beautiful, standing at a distance immobile at midnight against the railings of some square! behind you is a white crescent of foam, and fishermen on the verge of the world are drawing in

('yet, louis,' said rhoda, 'how short a time silence lasts. already they are beginning to smooth their napkins by the side of their plates. "who comes?" says jinny; and neville sighs, remembering that percival comes no more. jinny has taken out her looking-glass. surveying her face like an artist, she draws a powder-puff down her nose, and after one moment of deliberation has given precisely that red to the lips that the lips need. susan, who feels scorn and fear at the sight of these preparations, fastens the top button of her coat, and unfastens it. what is she making ready for? for something, but something different.'

'they are saying to themselves,' said louis, '"it is time. i am still vigorous," they are saying. "my face shall be cut against the black of infinite space." they do not finish their sentences. "it is time," they keep saying. "the gardens will be shut." and going with them, rhoda, swept into their current, we

'while we advance down this avenue,' said louis, 'i leaning slightly upon jinny, bernard arm-in-arm with neville, and susan with her hand in mine, it is difficult not to weep, calling ourselves little children, praying that god may keep us safe while we sleep. it is sweet to sing together, clasping hands, afraid of the dark, while miss curry plays the harmonium.'

'the iron gates have rolled back,' said jinny. 'time's fangs have ceased their devouring. we have triumphed over the abysses of space, with rouge, with powder, with flimsy pocket-handkerchiefs.'

'we have destroyed something by our presence,' said bernard, 'a world perhaps.'

'yet we scarcely breathe,' said neville, 'spent as we are. we are in that passive and exhausted frame of mind when we only wish to rejoin the body of our mother from whom we have been severed. all else is distasteful, forced and fatiguing. jinny's yellow scarf is moth-coloured in this light; susan's eyes are quenched. we are scarcely to be distinguished from the river. one cigarett

'still i gape,' said susan, 'like a young bird, unsatisfied, for something that has escaped me.'

'that i observed even in the midst of my anguish when, twisting her pocket-handkerchief, susan cried, "i love; i hate." "a worthless servant," i observed, "laughs upstairs in the attic," and that little piece of dramatization shows how incompletely we are merged in our own experiences. on the outskirts of every agony sits some observant fellow who points; who whispers as he whispered to me that summer morning in the house where the corn comes up to the window, "the willow grows on the turf by the river. the gardeners sweep with great brooms and the lady sits writing." thus he directed me

d her love; and the squeak of trams mixed with her cry of delight and the rippling of leaves had to shade her languor, her delicious lassitude as she sank down cooled by all the sweetness of nature satisfied. our friends, how seldom visited, how little known--it is true; and yet, when i meet an unknown person, and try to break off, here at this table, what i call "my life", it is not one life that i look back upon; i am not one person; i am many people; i do not altogether know who i am--jinny, susan, neville, rhoda, or louis; or how to distinguish my life from theirs.

'so i thought that night in early autumn when we came together and dined once more at hampton court. our discomfort was at first considerable, for each by that time was committed to a statement, and the other person coming along the road to the meeting-place dressed like this or that, with a stick or without, seemed to contradict it. i saw jinny look at susan's earthy fingers and then hide her own; i, considering neville, so

'was this, then, this streaming away mixed with susan, jinny, neville, rhoda, louis, a sort of death? a new assembly of elements? some hint of what was to come? the note was scribbled, the book shut, for i am an intermittent student. i do not say my lessons by any means at the stated hour. later, walking down fleet street at the rush hour, i recalled that moment; i continued it.

"wait until these omnibuses have gone by. do not cross so dangerously. these men are your brothers." in persuading her i was also persuading my own soul. for this is not one life; nor do i always know if i am man or woman, bernard or neville, louis, susan, jinny, or rhoda--so strange is the contact of one with another.

'swinging my stick, with my hair newly cut and the nape of my neck tingling, i went past all those trays of penny toys imported from germany that men hold out in the street by st paul's--st paul's, the brooding hen with spread wings from whose shelter run omnibuses and streams of men and women at the rush hour. i thought how louis would mount those steps in his neat suit with his cane in his hand and his angular, rather detached

'thus when i come to shape here at this table between my hands the story of my life and set it before you as a complete thing, i have to recall things gone far, gone deep, sunk into this life or that and become part of it; dreams, too, things surrounding me, and the inmates, those old half-articulate ghosts who keep up their hauntings by day and night; who tu
