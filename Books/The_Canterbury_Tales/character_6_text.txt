there has been not the slightest attempt to "modernise"
chaucer, in the wider meaning of the phrase; to replace his
words by words which he did not use; or, following the example
of some operators, to translate him into english of the modern
spirit as well as the modern forms.  so far from that, in every
case where the old spelling or form seemed essential to metre,
to rhyme, or meaning, no change has been attempted.  but,
wherever its preservation was not essential, the spelling of the
monkish transcribers -- for the most ardent purist must now
despair of getting at the spelling of chaucer himself -- has been
discarded for that of the reader's own day.  it is a poor
compliment to the father of english poetry, to say that by such
treatment the bouquet and individuality of his works must be
lost.  if his masterpiece is valuable for one thing more than any
other, it is the vivid distinctness with which english men and
women of the fourteenth century are there painted, for the study

ages in his poetry, from "the assembly of
fowls" to "the canterbury tales." in the opening of the first
poem  there is a striking parallel to dante's inscription on the
gate of hell.  the first song of troilus, in "troilus and
cressida", is a nearly literal translation of petrarch's 88th
sonnet. in the prologue to "the legend of good women",
there is a reference to dante which can hardly have reached the
poet at second- hand. and in chaucer's great work -- as in the
wife of bath's tale, and the monk's tale  -- direct reference by
name is made to dante, "the wise poet of florence," "the great
poet of italy," as the source whence the author has quoted.
when we consider the poet's high place in literature and at
court, which could not fail to make him free of the hospitalities
of the brilliant little lombard states; his familiarity with the
tongue and the works of italy's greatest bards, dead and living;
the reverential regard which he paid to the memory of great
poets, of which we have examp

been supposed that in the later years of chaucer's life the
friendship suffered some diminution. to the "moral gower" and
"the philosophical strode," chaucer "directed" or dedicated his
"troilus and cressida;" <7> while, in the "confessio amantis,"
gower introduces a handsome compliment to his greater
contemporary, as the "disciple and the poet" of venus, with
whose glad songs and ditties, made in her praise during the
flowers of his youth, the land was filled everywhere.  gower,
however -- a monk and a conservative -- held to the party of
the duke of gloucester, the rival of the wycliffite and
innovating duke of lancaster, who was chaucer's patron, and
whose cause was not a little aided by chaucer's strictures on the
clergy; and thus it is not impossible that political differences
may have weakened the old bonds of personal friendship and
poetic esteem. returning from lombardy early in 1379,
chaucer seems to have been again sent abroad; for the records
exhibit no trace of him between ma

rks (l26, 13s. 4d.) per annum, in addition to the pension of
l20 conferred by richard ii. in 1394.  but the poet, now
seventy-one years of age, and probably broken down by the
reverses of the past few years, was not destined long to enjoy
his renewed prosperity.  on christmas eve of 1399, he entered
on the possession of a house in the garden of the chapel of the
blessed mary of westminster -- near to the present site of
henry vii.'s chapel -- having obtained a lease from robert
hermodesworth, a monk of the adjacent convent, for fifty-three
years, at the annual rent of four marks (l2, 13s. 4d.) until the
1st of march 1400, chaucer drew his pensions in person; then
they were received for him by another hand; and on the 25th of
october, in the same year, he died, at the age of seventy-two.
the only lights thrown by his poems on his closing days are
furnished in the little ballad called "good counsel of chaucer,"
-- which, though said to have been written when "upon his

great anguish, "breathes the very spirit of
courage, resignation, and philosophic calm; and by the
"retractation" at the end of the canterbury tales, which, if it
was not foisted in by monkish transcribers, may be supposed the
effect of chaucer's regrets and self-reproaches on that solemn
review of his life-work which the close approach of death
compelled. the poet was buried in westminster abbey; <12>
and not many years after his death a slab was  placed on a pillar
near his grave, bearing the lines, taken from an epitaph or
eulogy made by stephanus surigonus of milan, at the request of
caxton:

aucer seems to have followed an old french
story, which also formed the groundwork of the first story in
the eighth day of the "decameron."

2. "he must us clothe": so in all the manuscripts and from this
and the following lines, it must be inferred that chaucer had
intended to put the tale in  the mouth of a female speaker.

3. dan: a title bestowed on priests and scholars; from
"dominus," like the spanish "don".

4. bruges was in chaucer's time the great emporium of
european commerce.

5. the monk had been appointed by his abbot to inspect and
manage the rural property of the monastery.

6. malvesie or malmesy wine derived its name from malvasia, a
region of the morea near cape malea, where it was made, as it
also was on chios and some other greek islands. vernage was
"vernaccia", a sweet italian wine.

notes to the monk's tale


1. the monk's tale is founded in its main features on
bocccacio's work, "de casibus virorum illustrium;" ("stories
of illustrious men") but chaucer has taken the separate stories
of which it is composed from different authors, and dealt with
them after his own fashion.

 2. boccaccio opens his book with adam, whose story is told at
much greater length than here. lydgate, in his translation from
boccaccio, speaks of adam and eve as made  "of slime of the
erth in damascene the felde."

 but only the deeds of
fortune, that with an awkward stroke, overturneth the realms of
great nobley?'" --  in some manuscripts the four "tragedies" that
follow are placed between those of zenobia and nero; but
although the general reflection with which the "tragedy" of
croesus closes might most appropriately wind up the whole
series, the general chronological arrangement which is observed
in the other cases recommends the order followed in the text.
besides, since, like several other tales, the monk's tragedies
were cut short by the impatience of the auditors, it is more
natural that the tale should close abruptly, than by such a
rhetorical finish as these lines afford.

28. pedro the cruel, king of aragon, against whom his brother
henry rebelled. he was by false pretences inveigled into his
brother's tent, and treacherously slain. mr wright has remarked
that "the cause of pedro, though he was no better than a cruel
and reckless tyrant, was popular in england from the very

2. on this tyrwhitt remarks; "i know not how it has happened,
that in the principal modern languages, john, or its equivalent,

'gianni,' from whence 'zani;' the spaniards 'juan,' as 'bobo
juan,' a foolish john; the french 'jean,' with various additions;
and in english, when we call a man 'a john,' we do not mean it
as a title of honour."  the title of "sir" was usually given

notes to the prayer of chaucer


1. the genuineness and real significance of this "prayer of
chaucer," usually called his "retractation," have been warmly
disputed. on the one hand, it has been declared that the monks
forged the retractation. and procured its insertion among the
works of the man who had done so much to expose their abuses
and ignorance, and to weaken their hold on popular credulity:
on the other hand, chaucer himself at the close of his life, is
said to have greatly lamented the ribaldry and the attacks on the
clergy which marked especially "the canterbury tales," and to
have drawn up a formal retractation of which the "prayer" is
either a copy or an abridgment. the beginning and end of the

allegorical personification of the husband; and disdain suitably
represents the lover's corresponding difficulty from the side of
the lady.

16. in the knight's tale, emily's yellow hair is braided in a
tress, or plait, that hung a yard long behind her back; so that,
both as regards colour and fashion, a singular resemblance
seems to have existed between the female taste of 1369 and that

36. all the sin must on our friendes be: who made us take the
vows before they knew our own dispositions, or ability, to keep
them.

37. cope: the large vestment worn in singing the service in the
choir. in chaucer's time it seems to have been a distinctively
clerical piece of dress; so, in the prologue to the monk's tale,
the host, lamenting that so stalwart a man as the monk should
have gone into religion, exclaims, "alas! why wearest thou so
wide a cope?"

38. the three of fatal destiny: the three fates.

lethes." ("a stream of lethe's water issues from the base of the
rock")

4. see the account of the vision of croesus in the monk's tale.

5. the meaning of the allusion is not clear; but the story of the
pilgrims and the peas is perhaps suggested by the line following
