[CHARACTER] - 
                [CHARACTER] is leonce and edna's family physician.
he is a fairly enlightened man, who silently recognizes edna's dissatisfaction
with the restrictions placed on her by social conventions. when
leonce consults with him about edna's unconventional behavior, the
doctor suspects that edna is in love with another man, although
he keeps his suspicions to himself because he recognizes that there
is little leonce can do if edna is indeed in love with someone else
and that any further constraints imposed on her will only intensify
her revolt. [CHARACTER] offers edna his help and understanding
and is worried about the possible consequences of her defiance and independence.
