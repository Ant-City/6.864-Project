stately, plump buck mulligan came from the stairhead, bearing a bowl of
lather on which a mirror and a razor lay crossed. a yellow dressinggown,
ungirdled, was sustained gently behind him on the mild morning air. he
held the bowl aloft and intoned:

â€”introibo ad altare dei.

halted, he peered down the dark winding stairs and called out coarsely:

â€”come up, kinch! come up, you fearful jesuit!

solemnly he came forward and mounted the round gunrest. he faced about
and blessed gravely thrice the tower, the surrou

nding land and the
awaking mountains. then, catching sight of stephen dedalus, he bent
towards him and made rapid crosses in the air, gurgling in his throat
and shaking his head. stephen dedalus, displeased and sleepy, leaned
his arms on the top of the staircase and looked coldly at the shaking
gurgling face that blessed him, equine in its length, and at the light
untonsured hair, grained and hued like pale oak.

buck mulligan peeped an instant under the mirror and then covered the
bowl smartly.

â€”back to barracks! he said sternly.

he added in a preacherâ€™s tone:

â€”for this, o dearly beloved, is the genuine christine: body and soul and
blood and ouns. slow music, please. shut your eyes, gents. one moment. a
little trouble about those white corpuscles. silence, all.

he peered sideways up and gave a long slow whistle of call, then paused
awhile in rapt attention, his even white teeth glistening here and

a pleasant smile broke quietly over his lips.

â€”the mockery of it! he said gaily. your absurd name, an ancient greek!

he pointed his finger in friendly jest and went over to the parapet,
laughing to himself. stephen dedalus stepped up, followed him wearily
halfway and sat down on the edge of the gunrest, watching him still as
he propped his mirror on the parapet, dipped the brush in the bowl and
lathered cheeks and neck.

buck mulliganâ€™s gay voice went on.

â€”my name is absurd too: malachi mulligan, two dactyls. but it has a
hellenic ring, hasnâ€™t it? tripping and sunny like the buck himself.
we must go to athens. will you come if i can get the aunt to fork out
twenty quid?

he laid the brush aside and, laughing with delight, cried:

â€”will he come? the jejune jesuit!

ceasing, he began to shave with care.

â€”tell me, mulligan, stephen said quietly.

â€”yes, my love?

â€”how long is haines going to stay in this

 tower?

buck mulligan showed a shaven cheek over his right shoulder.

â€”god, isnâ€™t he dreadful? he said frankly. a ponderous saxon. he thinks
youâ€™re not a gentleman. god, these bloody english! bursting with money
and indigestion. because he comes from oxford. you know, dedalus, you
have the real oxford manner. he canâ€™t make you out. o, my name for you
is the best: kinch, the knife-blade.

he shaved warily over his chin.

â€”he was raving all night about a black panther, stephen said. where is

case?

â€”a woful lunatic! mulligan said. were you in a funk?

â€”i was, stephen said with energy and growing fear. out here in the dark
with a man i donâ€™t know raving and moaning to himself about shooting a
black panther. you saved men from drowning. iâ€™m not a hero, however. if
he stays on here i am off.

buck mulligan frowned at the lather on his razorblade. he hopped down
from his perch and began to search his trouser pockets hastily.

â€”scutter! he cried thickly.

he came over to the gunrest and, thrusting a hand into stephenâ€™s upper
pocket, said:

â€”lend us a loan of your noserag to wipe my razor.

stephen suffered him to pull out and hold up on show by its corner a
dirty crumpled handkerchief. buck mulligan wiped the razorblade neatly.
then, gazing over the handkerchief, he said:

â€”god! he said quietly. isnâ€™t the sea what algy calls it: a great sweet
mother? the snotgreen sea. the scrotumtightening sea. epi oinopa ponton.
ah, dedalus, the greeks! i must teach you. you must read them in the
original. thalatta! thalatta! she is our great sweet mother. come and
look.

stephen stood up and went over to the parapet. leaning on it he looked
down on the water and on the mailboat clearing the harbourmouth of
kingstown.

â€”our mighty mother! buck mulligan said.

he turned abruptly his grey searching eyes from the sea to stephenâ€™s
face.

â€”the aunt thinks you killed your mother, he said. thatâ€™s why she wonâ€™t
let me have anything to do with you.

â€”someone killed her, stephen said gloomily.

â€”you could have knelt down, damn it, kinch, when your dying mother asked
you, buck mulligan said. iâ€™m hyperborean as much as you. but to think of
your mother begging you with her last breath to kneel down and pray for
her. and you refused.

within its
loose brown graveclothes giving off an odour of wax and rosewood, her
breath, that had bent upon him, mute, reproachful, a faint odour of
wetted ashes. across the threadbare cuffedge he saw the sea hailed as a
great sweet mother by the wellfed voice beside him. the ring of bay
and skyline held a dull green mass of liquid. a bowl of white china had
stood beside her deathbed holding the green sluggish bile which she had
torn up from her rotting liver by fits of loud groaning vomiting.

buck mulligan wiped again his razorblade.

â€”ah, poor dogsbody! he said in a kind voice. i must give you a shirt and
a few noserags. how are the secondhand breeks?

â€”they fit well enough, stephen answered.

buck mulligan attacked the hollow beneath his underlip.

â€”the mockery of it, he said contentedly. secondleg they should be. god
knows what poxy bowsy left them off. i have a lovely pair with a hair
stripe, grey. youâ€™ll look spiffing in them. iâ€™m not joking, kinch. you

â€”thanks, stephen said. i canâ€™t wear them if they are grey.

â€”he canâ€™t wear them, buck mulligan told his face in the mirror.
etiquette is etiquette. he kills his mother but he canâ€™t wear grey
trousers.

he folded his razor neatly and with stroking palps of fingers felt the
smooth skin.

stephen turned his gaze from the sea and to the plump face with its
smokeblue mobile eyes.

â€”that fellow i was with in the ship last night, said buck mulligan, says
you have g. p. i. heâ€™s up in dottyville with connolly norman. general
paralysis of the insane!

he swept the mirror a half circle in the air to flash the tidings abroad
in sunlight now radiant on the sea. his curling shaven lips laughed and
the edges of his white glittering teeth. laughter seized all his strong
wellknit trunk.

â€”look at yourself, he said, you dreadful bard!

stephen bent forward and peered at the mirror held out to him, cleft by
a crooked crack. hair on end.

as he and others see me. who chose this
face for me? this dogsbody to rid of vermin. it asks me too.

â€”i pinched it out of the skivvyâ€™s room, buck mulligan said. it does her
all right. the aunt always keeps plainlooking servants for malachi. lead
him not into temptation. and her name is ursula.

laughing again, he brought the mirror away from stephenâ€™s peering eyes.

â€”the rage of caliban at not seeing his face in a mirror, he said. if
wilde were only alive to see you!

drawing back and pointing, stephen said with bitterness:

â€”it is a symbol of irish art. the cracked lookingglass of a servant.

buck mulligan suddenly linked his arm

â€”let him stay, stephen said. thereâ€™s nothing wrong with him except at
night.

â€”then what is it? buck mulligan asked impatiently. cough it up. iâ€™m
quite frank with you. what have you against me now?

they halted, looking towards the blunt cape of bray head that lay on the
water like the snout of a sleeping whale. stephen freed his arm quietly.

â€”do you wish me to tell you? he asked.

â€”yes, what is it? buck mulligan answered. i donâ€™t remember anything.

he looked in stephenâ€™s face as he spoke. a light wind passed his brow,
fanning softly his fair uncombed hair and stirring silver point

anxiety in his eyes.

stephen, depressed by his own voice, said:

â€”do you remember the first day i went to your house after my motherâ€™s
death?

buck mulligan frowned quickly and said:

â€”what? where? i canâ€™t remember anything. i remember only ideas and
sensations. why? what happened in the name of god?

â€”you were making tea, stephen said, and went across the landing to
get more hot water. your mother and some visitor came out of the
drawingroom. she asked you who was in your room.

â€”yes? buck mulligan said. what did i say? i forget.

â€”you said, stephen answered, o, itâ€™s only dedalus whose mother is
beastly dead.

a flush which ma

mulliganâ€™s cheek.

â€”did i say that? he asked. well? what harm is that?

he shook his constraint from him nervously.

â€”and what is death, he asked, your motherâ€™s or yours or my own? you
saw only your mother die. i see them pop off every day in the mater and
richmond and cut up into tripes in the dissectingroom. itâ€™s a beastly
thing and nothing else. it simply doesnâ€™t matter. you wouldnâ€™t kneel
down to pray for your mother on her deathbed when she asked you. why?
because you have th

didnâ€™t mean to offend the memory of your mother.

he had spoken himself into boldness. stephen, shielding the gaping
wounds which the words had left in his heart, said very coldly:

â€”i am not thinking of the offence to my mother.

â€”of what then? buck mulligan asked.

â€”of the offence to me, stephen answered.

buck mulligan swung round on his heel.

â€”o, an impossible person! he exclaimed.

he walked off quickly round the parapet. stephen stood at his post,
gazing over the calm sea towards the headland. sea and headland now grew
dim. pulses were beating in his eyes, veiling their sight, and he felt
the fever of his cheeks.

a voice within the tower called loudly:

â€”are you up there, mulligan?

â€”iâ€™m coming, buck mulligan answered.

ghoul! chewer of corpses!

no, mother! let me be and let me live.

â€”kinch ahoy!

buck mulliganâ€™s voice sang from within the tower. it came nearer up the
staircase, calling again. stephen, still trembling at his soulâ€™s cry,
heard warm running sunlight and in the air behind him friendly words.

â€”dedalus, come down, like a good mosey. breakfast is ready. haines is
apologising for waking us last night. itâ€™s all right.

â€”iâ€™m coming, stephen said, turning.

â€”do, for jesusâ€™ sake, buck mulligan said. for my sake and for all our
sakes.

â€”i told him your symbol of irish art. he says itâ€™s very clever. touch
him for a quid, will you? a guinea, i mean.

â€”i get paid this morning, stephen said.

â€”the school kip? buck mulligan said. how much? four quid? lend us one.

â€”if you want it, stephen said.

â€”four shining sovereigns, buck mulligan cried with delight. weâ€™ll have
a glorious drunk to astonish the druidy druids. four omnipotent
sovereigns.

he flung up his hands and tramped down the stone stairs, singing out of
tune with a cockney accent:

     o, wonâ€™t we have a merry time,
     drinking whisky, beer and wine!
     on coronation,
     coronation day!
     o, wonâ€™t we have a merry time
     on coronation day!

forgotten, on the parapet. why sho

he went over to it, held it in his hands awhile, feeling its coolness,
smelling the clammy slaver of the lather in which the brush was stuck.
so i carried the boat of incense then at clongowes. i am another now and
yet the same. a servant too. a server of a servant.

in the gloomy domed livingroom of the tower buck mulliganâ€™s gowned form
moved briskly to and fro about the hearth, hiding and revealing its
yellow glow. two shafts of soft daylight fell across the flagged floor
from the high barbacans: and at the meeting of their rays a cloud of
coalsmoke and fumes of fried grease floated, turning.

â€”weâ€™ll be choked, buck mulligan said. haines, open that door, will you?

stephen laid the shavingbowl on the locker. a tall figure rose from the
hammock where it had been sitting, went to the doorway and pul

the inner doors.

â€”have you the key? a voice asked.

â€”dedalus has it, buck mulligan said. janey mack, iâ€™m choked!

he howled, without looking up from the fire:

â€”kinch!

â€”itâ€™s in the lock, stephen said, coming forward.

the key scraped round harshly twice and, when the heavy door had been
set ajar, welcome light and bright air entered. haines stood at the
doorway, looking out. stephen haled his upended valise to the table and
sat down to wait. buck mulligan tossed the fry on to the dish beside
him. then he carried the dish and a large teapot over to the table, set
them down heavily and sighed with relief.

â€”iâ€™m melting, he said, as the candle remarked when... but, hush! not a
word more on that subject! kinch, wake up! bread, butter, honey. haines,
come in. the grub is ready. bless us, o lord, and these thy gifts.
whereâ€™s the sugar? o, jay, thereâ€™s no milk.

stephen fetched the loaf and the pot of honey and the buttercooler from

e locker. buck mulligan sat down in a sudden pet.

â€”what sort of a kip is this? he said. i told her to come after eight.

â€”we can drink it black, stephen said thirstily. thereâ€™s a lemon in the
locker.

â€”o, damn you and your paris fads! buck mulligan said. i want sandycove
milk.

haines came in from the doorway and said quietly:

â€”that woman is coming up with the milk.

â€”the blessings of god on you! buck mulligan cried, jumping up from his
chair. sit down. pour out the tea there. the sugar is in the bag. here,
i canâ€™t go fumbling at the damned eggs.

he hacked through the fry on the dish and slapped it out on three
plates, saying:

â€”in nomine patris et filii et spiritus sancti.

haines sat down to pour out the tea.

â€”iâ€™m giving you two lumps each, he said. but, i say, mulligan, you do
make strong tea, donâ€™t you?

buck mulligan, hewing thick slices from the loaf, said in an old womanâ€

wheedling voice:

â€”when i makes tea i makes tea, as old mother grogan said. and when i
makes water i makes water.

â€”by jove, it is tea, haines said.

buck mulligan went on hewing and wheedling:

â€”so i do, mrs cahill, says she. begob, maâ€™am, says mrs cahill, god send
you donâ€™t make them in the one pot.

he lunged towards his messmates in turn a thick slice of bread, impaled
on his knife.

â€”thatâ€™s folk, he said very earnestly, for your book, haines. five
lines of text and ten pages of notes about the folk and the fishgods of
dundrum. printed by the weird sisters in the year of the big wind.

he turned to stephen and asked in a fine puzzle

d voice, lifting his
brows:

â€”can you recall, brother, is mother groganâ€™s tea and water pot spoken of
in the mabinogion or is it in the upanishads?

â€”i doubt it, said stephen gravely.

â€”do you now? buck mulligan said in the same tone. your reasons, pray?

â€”i fancy, stephen said as he ate, it did not exist in or out of the
mabinogion. mother grogan was, one imagines, a kinswoman of mary ann.

buck mulliganâ€™s face smiled with delight.

â€”charming! he said in a finical sweet voice, showing his white teeth and
blinking his eyes pleasantly. do you think she was? quite charming!

then, suddenly overclouding all his features, he growled in a hoarsened
rasping voice as he hewed again vigorously at the loaf:

     â€”for old mary ann
     she doesnâ€™t care a damn.
     but, hising up her petticoats...

he crammed his mouth with fry and munched and droned.

the doorway was darkened by an ente

about her whom they knew, dewsilky cattle. silk of the kine and poor old
woman, names given her in old times. a wandering crone, lowly form of
an immortal serving her conqueror and her gay betrayer, their common
cuckquean, a messenger from the secret morning. to serve or to upbraid,
whether he could not tell: but scorned to beg her favour.

â€”it is indeed, maâ€™am, buck mulligan said, pouring milk into their cups.

â€”taste it, sir, she said.

he drank at her bidding.

â€”if we could live on good food like that, he said to her somewhat
loudly, we wouldnâ€™t have the country full of rotten teeth and rotten
guts. living in a bogswamp, eating cheap food and the streets paved with
dust, horsedung and consumptivesâ€™ spits.

â€”are you a medical student, sir? the old woman asked.

â€”i am, maâ€™am, buck mulligan answered.

is of her but her womanâ€™s unclean loins, of manâ€™s flesh made not in

her be silent with wondering unsteady eyes.

â€”do you understand what he says? stephen asked her.

â€”is it french you are talking, sir? the old woman said to haines.

haines spoke to her again a longer speech, confidently.

â€”irish, buck mulligan said. is there gaelic on you?

â€”i thought it was irish, she said, by the sound of it. are you from the
west, sir?

â€”i am an englishman, haines answered.

â€”heâ€™s english, buck mulligan said, and he thinks we ought to speak irish
in ireland.

â€”sure we ought to, the old woman said, and iâ€™m ashamed i donâ€™t speak the
language myself. iâ€™m told itâ€™s a grand language by them that knows.

â€”grand is no name for it, said buck mulligan. wonderful entirely. fill

â€”no, thank you, sir, the old woman said, slipping the ring of the
milkcan on her forearm and about to go.

haines said to her:

â€”have you your bill? we had better pay her, mulligan, hadnâ€™t we?

stephen filled again the three cups.

â€”bill, sir? she said, halting. well, itâ€™s seven mornings a pint at
twopence is seven twos is a shilling and twopence over and these three
mornings a quart at fourpence is three quarts is a shilling. thatâ€™s a
shilling and one and two is two and two, sir.

buck mulligan sighed and, having filled his mouth with a crust thickly
buttered on both sides, stretched forth his legs and began to search his
trouser pockets.

â€”pay up and look pleasant, haines said to him, smiling.

stephen filled a third cup, a spoonful of tea colouring faintly the
thick rich milk. buck mulligan brought up a florin, twisted it round in
his fingers and cried:

â€”a miracle!

he passed it along the table towards the old woman, saying:

â€”ask nothing more of me, sweet. all i can

 give you i give.

stephen laid the coin in her uneager hand.

â€”weâ€™ll owe twopence, he said.

â€”time enough, sir, she said, taking the coin. time enough. good morning,
sir.

she curtseyed and went out, followed by buck mulliganâ€™s tender chant:

     â€”heart of my heart, were it more,
     more would be laid at your feet.

he turned to stephen and said:

â€”seriously, dedalus. iâ€™m stony. hurry out to your school kip and bring
us back some money. today the bards must drink and junket. ireland
expects that every man this day will do his duty.

â€”that reminds me, haines said, rising, that i have to visit your
national library today.

â€”our swim first, buck mulligan said.

he turned to stephen and asked bla

â€”all ireland is washed by the gulfstream, stephen said as he let honey
trickle over a slice of the loaf.

loose collar of his tennis shirt spoke:

â€”i intend to make a collection of your sayings if you will let me.

speaking to me. they wash and tub and scrub. agenbite of inwit.

â€”that one about the cracked lookingglass of a servant being the symbol
of irish art is deuced good.

buck mulligan kicked stephenâ€™s foot under the table and said with warmth
of tone:

â€”wait till you hear him on hamlet, haines.

â€”well, i mean it, haines said, still speaking to stephen. i was just
thinking of it when that poor old creature came in.

â€”would i make any money by it? stephen asked.

haines laughed and, as he took his soft grey hat from the holdfast of
the hammock, said:

â€”i donâ€™t know, iâ€™m sure.

he strolled out to the doorway. buck mulligan bent across to stephen and
said

with coarse vigour:

â€”you put your hoof in it now. what did you say that for?

â€”well? stephen said. the problem is to get money. from whom? from the
milkwoman or from him. itâ€™s a toss up, i think.

â€”i blow him out about you, buck mulligan said, and then you come along
with your lousy leer and your gloomy jesuit jibes.

â€”i see little hope, stephen said, from her or from him.

buck mulligan sighed tragically and laid his hand on stephenâ€™s arm.

â€”from me, kinch, he said.

in a suddenly changed tone he added:

â€”to tell you the godâ€™s truth i think youâ€™re right. damn all else they
are good for. why donâ€™t you play them as i do? to hell with them all.
let us get out of the kip.

he stood up, gravely ungirdled and disrobed himself of his gown, saying
resignedly:

â€”mulligan is stripped of his garments.

he emptied his pockets on to the table.

his talking hands.

â€”and thereâ€™s your latin quarter hat, he said.

stephen picked it up and put it on. haines called to them from the
doorway:

â€”are you coming, you fellows?

â€”iâ€™m ready, buck mulligan answered, going towards the door. come out,
kinch. you have eaten all we left, i suppose. resigned he passed out
with grave words and gait, saying, wellnigh with sorrow:

â€”and going forth he met butterly.

stephen, taking his ashplant from its leaningplace, followed them out
and, as they went down the ladder, pulled to the slow iron door and
locked it. he put the huge key in his inner pocket.

at the foot of the ladder buck mulligan asked:

â€”did you bring the key?

â€”i have it, st

he walked on. behind him he heard buck mulligan club with his heavy
bathtowel the leader shoots of ferns or grasses.

â€”down, sir! how dare you, sir!

haines asked:

â€”do you pay rent for this tower?

â€”twelve quid, buck mulligan said.

â€”to the secretary of state for war, stephen added over his shoulder.

they halted while haines surveyed the tower and said at last:

â€”rather bleak in wintertime, i should say. martello you call it?

â€”billy pitt had them built, buck mulligan said, when the french were on
the sea. but ours is the omphalos.

â€”what is your idea of hamlet? haines asked stephen.

â€”no, no, buck mulligan shouted in pain. iâ€™m not equal to thomas aquinas

he turned to stephen, saying, as he pulled down neatly the peaks of his
primrose waistcoat:

â€”you couldnâ€™t manage it under three pints, kinch, could you?

â€”it has waited so long, stephen said listlessly, it can wait longer.

â€”you pique my curiosity, haines said amiably. is it some paradox?

â€”pooh! buck mulligan said. we have grown out of wilde and paradoxes.
itâ€™s quite simple. he proves by algebra that hamletâ€™s grandson is
shakespeareâ€™s grandfather and that he himself is the ghost of his own
father.

â€”what? haines said, beginning to point at stephen. he himself?

buck mulligan slung his towel stolewise round his neck and, bending in
loose laughter, said to stephenâ€™s ear:

â€”o, shade of kinch the elder! japhet in search of a father!

rather long to tell.

buck mulligan, walking forward again, raised his hands.

â€”the sacred pint alone can unbind the tongue of dedalus, he said.

â€”i mean to say, haines explained to stephen as they followed, this tower
and these cliffs here remind me somehow of elsinore. that beetles oâ€™er
his base into the sea, isnâ€™t it?

buck mulligan turned suddenly for an instant towards stephen but did not
speak. in the bright silent instant stephen saw his own image in cheap
dusty mourning between their gay attires.

â€”itâ€™s a wonderful tale, haines said, bringing them to halt again.

father.

buck mulligan at once put on a blithe broadly smiling face. he looked
at them, his wellshaped mouth open happily, his eyes, from which he had
suddenly withdrawn all shrewd sense, blinking with mad gaiety. he moved
a dollâ€™s head to and fro, the brims of his panama hat quivering, and
began to chant in a quiet happy foolish voice:

     â€”iâ€™m the queerest young fellow that ever you heard.

a stone, in shirtsleeves, his unclipped tie rippling over his shoulder.
a young man clinging to a spur of rock near him, moved slowly frogwise
his green legs in the deep jelly of the water.

â€”is the brother with you, malachi?

â€”down in westmeath. with the bannons.

â€”still there? i got a card from bannon. says he found a sweet young
thing down there. photo girl he calls her.

sagging loincloth.

buck mulligan made way for him to scramble past and, glancing at haines
and stephen, crossed himself piously with his thumbnail at brow and lips
and breastbone.

â€”seymourâ€™s back in town, the young man said, grasping again his spur of
rock. chucked medicine and going in for the army.

â€”ah, go to god! buck mulligan said.

â€”yes.

he nodded to himself as he drew off his trousers and stood up, saying
tritely:

he broke off in alarm, feeling his side under his flapping shirt.

â€”my twelfth rib is gone, he cried. iâ€™m the Ã¼bermensch. toothless kinch
and i, the supermen.

he struggled out of his shirt and flung it behind him to where his
clothes lay.

â€”are you going in here, malachi?

â€”yes. make room in the bed.

the young man shoved himself backward through the water and reached
the middle of the creek in two long clean strokes. haines sat down on a

stephen turned away.

â€”give us that key, kinch, buck mulligan said, to keep my chemise flat.

stephen handed him the key. buck mulligan laid it across his heaped
clothes.

â€”and twopence, he said, for a pint. throw it there.

stephen threw two pennies on the soft heap. dressing, undressing. buck
mulligan erect, with joined hands before him, said solemnly:

â€”he who stealeth from the poor lendeth to the lord. thus spake
zarathustra.

his plump body plunged.

and smiling at wild irish.

dead wife and bids his friends be kind to an old mistress (donâ€™t forget

of the charge of pederasty brought against the bard. he lifted his

of retribution. rather strange he should have just that fixed idea. does

her shapely limbs encased in finespun hose with highspliced heels and
wide garter tops. as for undies they were gertyâ€™s chief care and who

childhood days. nay, she had even witnessed in the home circle deeds of
violence caused by intemperance and had seen her own father, a prey to

the shavings and handed stephen the hat and ashplant and bucked him up
generally in orthodox samaritan fashion which he very badly needed. his

unsteady and on his expressed desire for some beverage to drink mr

available for their ablutions let alone drinking purposes hit upon an
expedient by suggesting, off the reel, the propriety of the cabmanâ€™s

practised eye, was not without perceiving that he had succumbed to the
blandiloquence of the other parasite. alluding to the encounter he said,
laughingly, stephen, that is:

â€”he is down on his luck. he asked me to ask you to ask somebody named
boylan, a billsticker, to give him a job as a sandwichman.

at this intelligence, in which he seemingly evinced little interest, mr
bloom gazed abstractedly for the space of a half a second or so in the
direction of a bucketdredger, rejoicing in the farfamed name of eblana,
moored alongside customhouse quay and quite possibly out of repair,
whereupon he observed evasively:

â€”everybody gets their own ration of luck, they say. now you mention it
his face was familiar to me. but, leaving that for the moment, how much
did you part with, he queried, if i am not too inquisitive?

literally astounded at this piece of intelligence bloom reflected.
though they didnâ€™t see eye to eye in everything a certain analogy there
somehow was as if both their minds were travelling, so to speak, in the
one train of thought. at his age when dabbling in politics roughly
some score of years previously when he had been a quasi aspirant to
parliamentary honours in the buckshot foster days he too recollected in
retrospect (which was a source of keen satisfaction in itself) he had
a sneaking regard for those same ultra ideas. for instance when the
evicted tenants question, then at its first inception, bulked largely in
peopleâ€™s mind though, it goes without saying, not contributing a copper
or pinning his faith absolutely to its dictums, some of which wouldnâ€™t
exactly hold water, he at the outset in principle at all events was in
thorough sympathy with peasant p
