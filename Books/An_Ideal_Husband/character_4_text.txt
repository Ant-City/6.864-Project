first act


scene


_the octagon room at sir robert chiltern’s house in grosvenor square_.

[_the room is brilliantly lighted and full of guests_.  _at the top of
the staircase stands_ lady chiltern, _a woman of grave greek beauty_,
_about twenty-seven years of age_.  _she receives the guests as they come
up_.  _over the well of the staircase hangs a great chandelier with wax
lights_, _which illumine a large eig

mason.  [_announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  mr. and
lady jane barford.  lord caversham.

[_enter_ lord caversham, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
riband and star of the garter_.  _a fine whig type_.  _rather like a
portrait by lawrence_.]

lord caversham.  good evening, lady chiltern!  has my good-for-nothing
young son been here?

lady chiltern.  [_smiling_.]  i don’t think lord goring has arrived yet.

mabel chiltern.  [_coming up to_ lord caversham.]  why do you call lord
goring good-for-nothing?

[mabel chiltern _is a perfect example of the english type of prettiness_,
_the apple-blossom type_.  _she has all the fragrance and freedom of a
flower_.  _there is ripple after ripple of sunlight in her hair_, _and
the little mouth_, _with its parted lips_, _is expectant_, _like the
mouth of a child_.  _she has the fascinating tyranny of youth_, _and the
astonishing courage of innocence_.  _to sane people she is

 not
reminiscent of any work of art_.  _but she is really like a tanagra
statuette_, _and would be rather annoyed if she were told so_.]

lord caversham.  because he leads such an idle life.

mabel chiltern.  how can you say such a thing?  why, he rides in the row
at ten o’clock in the morning, goes to the opera three times a week,
changes his clothes at least five times a day, and dines out every night
of the season.  you don’t call that leading an idle life, do you?

lord caversham.  [_looking at her with a kindly twinkle in his eyes_.]
you are a very charming young lady!

mabel chiltern.  how sweet of you to say that, lord caversham!  do come
to us more often.  you know we are always at hom

e on wednesdays, and you
look so well with your star!

lord caversham.  never go anywhere now.  sick of london society.
shouldn’t mind being introduced to my own tailor; he always votes on the
right side.  but object strongly to being sent down to dinner with my
wife’s milliner.  never could stand lady caversham’s bonnets.

mabel chiltern.  oh, i love london society!  i think it has immensely
improved.  it is entirely composed now of beautiful idiots and brilliant
lunatics.  just what society should be.

lord caversham.  hum!  which is goring?  beautiful idiot, or the other
thing?

mabel chiltern.  [_gravely_.]  i have been obliged for the present to put
lord goring into a class quite by himself.  but he is developing
charmingly!

lord caversham.  into what?

mabel chiltern.  [_with a little curtsey_.]  i hope to let you know ve

y.  he reflects every credit on the institution.

lord goring.  may i ask are you staying in london long?

mrs. cheveley.  that depends partly on the weather, partly on the
cooking, and partly on sir robert.

sir robert chiltern.  you are not going to plunge us into a european war,
i hope?

mrs. cheveley.  there is no danger, at present!

[_she nods to_ lord goring, _with a look of amusement in her eyes_, _and
goes out with_ sir robert chiltern.  lord goring _saunters over to_ mabel
chiltern.]

mabel chiltern.  you are very late!

lord goring.  have you missed me?

mabel chiltern.  awfully!

lord goring.  then i am sorry i did not stay away longer.  i like being
missed.

mabel chiltern.  how very selfish of you!

lord goring.  i am very selfish.

mabel chiltern.  you are always telling me of your bad qualities, lord
goring.

lord goring.  i have only told you half of them as yet, miss mabel!

mabel chiltern.  are the others very bad?

lord goring.  quite dreadful!  when i think of them at night i go

 to
sleep at once.

mabel chiltern.  well, i delight in your bad qualities.  i wouldn’t have
you part with one of them.

lord goring.  how very nice of you!  but then you are always nice.  by
the way, i want to ask you a question, miss mabel.  who brought mrs.
cheveley here?  that woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the
room with your brother?

mabel chiltern.  oh, i think lady markby brought her.  why do you ask?

lord goring.  i haven’t seen her for years, that is all.

mabel chiltern.  what an absurd reason!

lord goring.  all reasons are absurd.

mabel chiltern.  what sort of a woman is she?

lord goring.  oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!

mabel chiltern.  i dislike her already.

lord goring.  that shows your admirable good taste.

vicomte de nanjac.  [_approaching_.]  ah, the english young lady is the
dragon of good taste, is she not?  quite the dragon of good taste.

lord goring.  so the newspapers are always telling us.

vicomte de nanjac.  i read all

amusing.

lord goring.  then, my dear nanjac, you must certainly read between the
lines.

vicomte de nanjac.  i should like to, but my professor objects.  [_to_
mabel chiltern.]  may i have the pleasure of escorting you to the
music-room, mademoiselle?

mabel chiltern.  [_looking very disappointed_.]  delighted, vicomte,
quite delighted!  [_turning to_ lord goring.]  aren’t you coming to the
music-room?

lord goring.  not if there is any music going on, miss mabel.

mabel chiltern.  [_severely_.]  the music is in german.  you would not
understand it.

[_goes out with the_ vicomte de nanjac.  lord caversham _comes up to his
son_.]

lord caversham.  well, sir! what are you doing here?  wasting your life
as usual!  you should be in bed, sir.  you keep too lat

 not going to praise her.  i hear she went
to the opera on monday night, and told tommy rufford at supper that, as
far as she could see, london society was entirely made up of dowdies and
dandies.

lord goring.  she is quite right, too.  the men are all dowdies and the
women are all dandies, aren’t they?

mrs. marchmont.  [_after a pause_.]  oh! do you really think that is what
mrs. cheveley meant?

lord goring.  of course.  and a very sensible remark for mrs. cheveley to
make, too.

[_enter_ mabel chiltern.  _she joins the group_.]

mabel chiltern.  why are you talking about mrs. cheveley?  everybody is
talking about mrs. cheveley!  lord goring says—what did you say, lord
goring, about mrs. cheveley?  oh! i remember, that she was a genius in
the daytime and a beauty at night.

lady basildon.  what a horrid combination!  so very unnatural!

mrs. marchmont.  [_in her most dreamy manner_.]  i like looking at
geniuses, and listening to beautiful people.

lord goring.  ah! that is morbid of you, mrs

. marchmont!

mrs. marchmont.  [_brightening to a look of real pleasure_.]  i am so
glad to hear you say that.  marchmont and i have been married for seven
years, and he has never once told me that i was morbid.  men are so
painfully unobservant!

lady basildon.  [_turning to her_.]  i have always said, dear margaret,
that you were the most morbid person in london.

mrs. marchmont.  ah! but you are always sympathetic, olivia!

mabel chiltern.  is it morbid to have a desire for food?  i have a great
desire for food.  lord goring, will you give me some supper?

lord goring.  with pleasure, miss mabel.  [_moves away with her_.]

mabel chiltern.  how horrid you have been!  you have never talked to me
the whole evening!

lord goring.  how could i?  you went away with the child-diplomatist.

mabel chiltern.  you might have followed us.  pursuit would have been
only polite.  i don’t think i like you at all this evening!

lord goring.  i

 like you immensely.

mabel chiltern.  well, i wish you’d show it in a more marked way!  [_they
go downstairs_.]

mrs. marchmont.  olivia, i have a curious feeling of absolute faintness.
i think i should like some supper very much.  i know i should like some
supper.

lady basildon.  i am positively dying for supper, margaret!

mrs. marchmont.  men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these
things.

lady basildon.  men are grossly material, grossly material!

top of the staircase and looks down at them as they descend_.  _her
expression is troubled_.  _after a little time she is joined by some of
the guests_, _and passes with them into another reception-room_.]

mabel chiltern.  what a horrid woman!

lord goring.  you should go to bed, miss mabel.

mabel chiltern.  lord goring!

lord goring.  my father told me to go to bed an hour ago.  i don’t see
why i shouldn’t give you the same advice.  i always pass on good advice.
it is the only thing to do with it.  it is never of any use to oneself.

mabel chiltern.  lord goring, you are always ordering me out of the room.
i think it most courageous of you.  especially as i am not going to bed
for hours.  [_goes over to t

vels in scotch dialect.  they are not improving
subjects.  [_catches sight of something that is lying on the sofa half
hidden by the cushion_.]  what is this?  some one has dropped a diamond
brooch!  quite beautiful, isn’t it?  [_shows it to him_.]  i wish it was
mine, but gertrude won’t let me wear anything but pearls, and i am
thoroughly sick of pearls.  they make one look so plain, so good and so
intellectual.  i wonder whom the brooch belongs to.

lord goring.  i wonder who dropped it.

mabel chiltern.  it is a beautiful brooch.

lord goring.  it is a handsome bracelet.

mabel chiltern.  it isn’t a bracelet.  it’s a brooch.

lord goring.  it can be used as a bracelet.  [_takes it from her_, _and_,
_pulling out a green letter-case_, _puts the ornament carefully in it_,
_and replaces the whole thing in his breast-pocket with the most perfect
sang froid_.]

mabel chiltern.  what are you doing?

lord goring.  miss mabel, i am going to make a rather strange request to
you.

mabel chiltern.  [
 
 ___________________________
 
_eagerly_.]  oh, pray do!  i have been waiting for it
all the evening.

lord goring.  [_is a little taken aback_, _but recovers himself_.]  don’t
mention to anybody that i have taken charge of this brooch.  should any
one write and claim it, let me know at once.

mabel chiltern.  that is a strange request.

lord goring.  well, you see i gave this brooch to somebody once, years
ago.

mabel chiltern.  you did?

lord goring.  yes.

[lady chiltern _enters alone_.  _the other guests have gone_.]

mabel chiltern.  then i shall certainly bid you good-night.  good-night,
gertrude!  [_exit_.]

lady chiltern.  good-night, dear!  [_to_ lord goring.]  you saw whom lady
markby brought here to-night?

lord goring.  yes.  it was an unpleasant surprise.  what did she come
here for?

lady chiltern.  apparently to try and lure robert to uphold some
fraudulent scheme in which she is interested.  the argentine canal, in
fact.

lord goring.  she has mistaken her man, hasn’t she?

lady chiltern.  she is incapable of

want me, come to me for my assistance, and you shall have it.  come at
once to me.

lady chiltern.  [_looking at him in surprise_.]  lord goring, you are
talking quite seriously.  i don’t think i ever heard you talk seriously
before.

lord goring.  [_laughing_.]  you must excuse me, lady chiltern.  it won’t
occur again, if i can help it.

lady chiltern.  but i like you to be serious.

[_enter_ mabel chiltern, _in the most ravishing frock_.]

mabel chiltern.  dear gertrude, don’t say such a dreadful thing to lord
goring.  seriousness would be very unbecoming to him.  good afternoon
lord goring!  pray be as trivial as you can.

lord goring.  i should like to, miss mabel, but i am afraid i am . . . a
little out of practice this morning; and besides, i have to be going now.

have!  i am sure you were very badly brought up.

mabel chiltern.  i wish i had brought you up!

lord goring.  i am so sorry you didn’t.

mabel chiltern.  it is too late now, i suppose?

lord goring.  [_smiling_.]  i am not so sure.

mabel chiltern.  will you ride to-morrow morning?

lord goring.  yes, at ten.

mabel chiltern.  don’t forget.

lord goring.  of course i shan’t.  by the way, lady chiltern, there is no
list of your guests in _the morning post_ of to-day.  it has apparently
been crowded out by the county council, or the lambeth conference, or
something equally boring.  could you let me have a list?  i have a
particular reason for asking you.

lady chiltern.  i am sure mr. trafford will be able to give you one.

lord goring.  thanks, so much.

mabel chiltern.  tommy is the most useful person in london

mabel chiltern [_triumphantly_.]  i am.

lord goring.  how clever of you to guess it!  [_takes up his hat and
cane_.]  good-bye, lady chiltern!  you will remember what i said to you,
won’t you?

lady chiltern.  yes; but i don’t know why you said it to me.

lord goring.  i hardly know myself.  good-bye, miss mabel!

mabel chiltern [_with a little moue of disappointment_.]  i wish you were
not going.  i have had four wonderful adventures this morning; four and a
half, in fact.  you might stop and listen to some of them.

lord goring.  how very selfish of you to have four and a half!  there
won’t be any left for me.

mabel chiltern.  i don’t want you to have any.  they would not be good
for you.

lord goring.  that is the first unkind thing you have ever said to me.
how charmingly you said it!  ten to-morrow.

lord goring.  quite sharp.  but don’t bring mr. trafford.

mabel chiltern.  [_with a little toss of the head_.]  of course i shan’t
bring tommy trafford.  tommy trafford is in great disgrace.

lord goring.  i am delighted to hear it.  [_bows and goes out_.]

mabel chiltern.  gertrude, i wish you would speak to tommy trafford.

lady chiltern.  what has poor mr. trafford done this time?  robert says
he is the best secretary he has ever had.

mabel chiltern.  well, tommy has proposed to me again.  tommy really does
nothing but propose to me.  he proposed to me last night in the
music-room, when i was quite unprotected, as there was an elaborate trio
going on.  i didn’t dare to make the smallest repartee, i need hardly
tell you.  if i had, it would have stopped the music at once.  musical
people are so absurdly unreasonable.  they always want one to be
perfectly dumb at the very moment when one is longing to be absolutely
deaf.  then he proposed

  when tommy wants to be
romantic he talks to one just like a doctor.  i am very fond of tommy,
but his methods of proposing are quite out of date.  i wish, gertrude,
you would speak to him, and tell him that once a week is quite often
enough to propose to any one, and that it should always be done in a
manner that attracts some attention.

lady chiltern.  dear mabel, don’t talk like that.  besides, robert thinks
very highly of mr. trafford.  he believes he has a brilliant future
before him.

mabel chiltern.  oh! i wouldn’t marry a man with a future before him for
anything under the sun.

lady chiltern.  mabel!

mabel chiltern.  i know, dear.  you married a man with a future, didn’t
you?  but then robert was a genius, and you have a noble,
self-sacrificing character.  you can stand geniuses.  i have no character
at all, and robert is the only genius i could ever bear.  as a rule, i
think they are quite impossible.  geniuses talk so much, don’t they?

you know who is coming to see you?  that dreadful mrs. cheveley, in a
most lovely gown.  did you ask her?

lady chiltern.  [_rising_.]  mrs. cheveley!  coming to see me?
impossible!

mabel chiltern.  i assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life
and not nearly so natural.

lady chiltern.  you need not wait, mabel.  remember, lady basildon is
expecting you.

mabel chiltern.  oh! i must shake hands with lady markby.  she is
delightful.  i love being scolded by her.

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.  isn’t that miss chiltern?  i should like so much
to know her.

lady chiltern.  mabel, mrs. cheveley wishes to know you.

[mabel chiltern _gives a little nod_.]

mrs. cheveley [_sitting down_.]  i thought your frock so charming last
night, miss chiltern.  so simple and . . . suitable.

mabel chiltern.  really?  i must tell my dressmaker.  it will be such a
surprise to her.  good-bye, lady markby!

lady markby.  going already?

mabel chiltern.  i am so sorry but i am obliged to.  i am just off to
rehearsal.  i have got to stand on my head in some tableaux.

lady markby.  on your head, child?  oh! i hope not.  i believe it is most
unhealthy.  [_takes a seat on the sofa next_ lady chiltern.]

mabel chiltern.  but it is for an excellent charity: in aid of the

mrs. cheveley.  and what is lord goring?

mabel chiltern.  oh! lord goring is president.

mrs. cheveley.  the post should suit him admirably, unless he has
deteriorated since i knew him first.

lady markby.  [_reflecting_.]  you are remarkably modern, mabel.  a
little too modern, perhaps.  nothing is so dangerous as being too modern.
one is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  i have known many
instances of it.

mabel chiltern.  what a dreadful prospect!

lady markby.  ah! my dear, you need not be nervous.  you will always be
as pretty as possible.  that is the best fashion there is, and the only
fashion that england succeeds in setting.

mabel chiltern.  [_with a curtsey_.]  thank you so much, lady markby, for
england . . . and myself.  [_goes out_.]

lord caversham.  if she did accept you she would be the prettiest fool in
england.

lord goring.  that is just what i should like to marry.  a thoroughly
sensible wife would reduce me to a condition of absolute idiocy in less
than six months.

lord caversham.  you don’t deserve her, sir.

lord goring.  my dear father, if we men married the women we deserved, we
should have a very bad time of it.

i am never going to speak to you again.

in london i really like to have to listen to me.

him do.

mabel chiltern.  i am afraid that he has one of those terribly weak
natures that are not susceptible to influence.

lord caversham.  he is very heartless, very heartless.

what people say of you behind your back.

it is not the prime minster’s day for seeing the unemployed.

pleased about it.

lord goring.  i can’t help it.  i always look pleased when i am with you.

mabel chiltern.  [_sadly_.]  then i suppose it is my duty to remain with
you?

lord goring.  of course it is.

mabel chiltern.  well, my duty is a thing i neve

lord goring.  [_somewhat taken aback_.]  well, yes, it is—i am bound to
say it is.

mabel chiltern.  [_with a sigh of pleasure_.]  i am so glad.  that makes
the second to-day.

lord goring.  [_indignantly_.]  the second to-day?  what conceited ass
has been impertinent enough to dare to propose to you before i had
proposed to you?

mabel chiltern.  tommy trafford, of course.  it is one of tommy’s days
for proposing.  he always proposes on tuesdays and thursdays, during the
season.

lord goring.  you didn’t accept him, i hope?

mabel chiltern.  i make it a rule never to accept tommy.  that

nearly said yes.  it would have been an excellent lesson both for him and
for you if i had.  it would have taught you both better manners.

lord goring.  oh! bother tommy trafford.  tommy is a silly little ass.  i
love you.

mabel chiltern.  i know.  and i think you might have mentioned it before.
i am sure i have given you heaps of opportunities.

lord goring.  mabel, do be serious.  please be serious.

mabel chiltern.  ah! that is the sort of thing a man always says to a
girl before he has been married to her.  he never says it afterwards.

lord goring.  [_taking hold of her hand_.]  mabel, i have told you that i
love you.  can’t you love me a little in return?

mabel chiltern.  you silly arthur!  if you knew anything about . . .
anything, which you don’t, you would know that i adore you.  every one in
london knows it except you.  it is a public scandal the way i adore you.
i have been going about for t

he last six months telling the whole of
society that i adore you.  i wonder you consent to have anything to say
to me.  i have no character left at all.  at least, i feel so happy that
i am quite sure i have no character left at all.

lord goring.  [_catches her in his arms and kisses her_.  _then there is
a pause of bliss_.]  dear!  do you know i was awfully afraid of being
refused!

mabel chiltern.  [_looking up at him_.]  but you never have been refused
yet by anybody, have you, arthur?  i can’t imagine any one refusing you.

lord goring.  [_after kissing her again_.]  of course i’m not nearly good
enough for you, mabel.

mabel chiltern.  [_nestling close to him_.]  i am so glad, darling.  i
was afraid you were.

lord goring.  [_after some hesitation_.]  and i’m . . . i’m a little over
thirty.

mabel chiltern.  dear, you look weeks younger than that.

lord goring.  [_enthusiasti

cally_.]  how sweet of you to say so! . . .
and it is only fair to tell you frankly that i am fearfully extravagant.

mabel chiltern.  but so am i, arthur.  so we’re sure to agree.  and now i
must go and see gertrude.

lord goring.  must you really?  [_kisses her_.]

mabel chiltern.  yes.

lord goring.  then do tell her i want to talk to her particularly.  i
have been waiting here all the morning to see either her or robert.

mabel chiltern.  do you mean to say you didn’t come here expressly to
propose to me?

lord goring.  [_triumphantly_.]  no; that was a flash of genius.

mabel chiltern.  your first.

lord goring.  [_with determination_.]  my last.

mabel chiltern.  i am delighted to hear it.  now don’t stir.  i’ll be
back in five minutes.  and don’t fall into any temptations while i am
away.

lord goring.  dear mabel, while you are away, there are none.  it makes
me horribly dependent on you.

[_enter_ lady chiltern.]

lady chiltern.  good morning, dear!  how pretty you are looking!

mabel chiltern.  how pale you are looking, gertrude!  it is most
becoming!

lady chiltern.  good morning, lord goring!

lord goring.  [_bowing_.]  good morning, lady chiltern!

mabel chiltern.  [_aside to_ lord goring.]  i shall be in the
conservatory under the second palm tree on the left.

lord goring.  second on the left?

mabel chiltern.  [_with a look of mock surprise_.]  yes; the usual palm
tree.

[_blows a kiss to him_, _unobserved by_ lady chiltern, _and goes out_.]

lord goring.  lady chiltern, i have a certain amount of very good news to
tell you.  mrs. cheveley gave me up robert’s letter last night, and i
burned it.  robert is safe.

lady chiltern.  [_sinking on the sofa_.]  safe!  oh! i am so glad of
that.  what a good friend you are to him—to us!

lord goring.  there is only one person now that could be said to be

the brilliant mrs. cheveley does not seem to have noticed
that.  there should be a name.

lady chiltern.  let me write yours.  it is you i trust and need.  you and
none else.

lord goring.  well, really, lady chiltern, i think i should have back my
own letter.

lady chiltern.  [_smiling_.]  no; you shall have mabel.  [_takes the
letter and writes her husband’s name on it_.]

lord goring.  well, i hope she hasn’t changed her mind.  it’s nearly
twenty minutes since i saw her last.

[_enter_ mabel chiltern _and_ lord caversham.]

mabel chiltern.  lord goring, i think your father’s conversation much
more improving than yours.  i am only going to talk to lord caversham in
the future, and always under the usual palm tree.

lord goring.  darling!  [_kisses her_.]

lord caversham.  [_considerably taken aback_.]  what does this mean, sir?
you don’t mean to say that this charming, clever young lady has been so
foolish as to accept you?

lord goring.  certainly, father!  and chiltern’s been wise en

accept the seat in the cabinet.

lord caversham.  i am very glad to hear that, chiltern . . . i
congratulate you, sir.  if the country doesn’t go to the dogs or the
radicals, we shall have you prime minister, some day.

[_enter_ mason.]

mason.  luncheon is on the table, my lady!

[mason _goes out_.]

mabel chiltern.  you’ll stop to luncheon, lord caversham, won’t you?

lord caversham.  with pleasure, and i’ll drive you down to downing street
afterwards, chiltern.  you have a great future before you, a great
future.  wish i could say the same for you, sir.  [_to_ lord goring.]
but your career will have to be entirely domestic.

lord goring.  yes, father, i prefer it domestic.

lord caversham.  and if you don’t make this young lady an ideal husband,
i’ll cut you off with a shilling.

n.  an ideal husband!  oh, i don’t think i should like that.
it sounds like something in the next world.

lord caversham.  what do you want him to be then, dear?

mabel chiltern.  he can be what he chooses.  all i want is to be . . . to
be . . . oh! a real wife to him.

lord caversham.  upon my word, there is a good deal of common sense in
that, lady chiltern.

[_they all go out except_ sir robert chiltern.  _he sinks in a chair_,
_wrapt in thought_.  _after a little time_ lady chiltern _returns to look
for him_.]

lady chiltern.  [_leaning over the back of the chair_.]  aren’t you
coming in, robert?
