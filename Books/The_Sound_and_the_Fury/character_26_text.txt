      "well, i ought to," doc says. "i'd a saved money this year raising it at 
two cents a pound."  
      another report came in. it was down a point.  
      "jason's selling," hopkins says. "look at his face."  
      "that's all right about what i'm doing," i says. "you boys follow your 
own judgment. those rich new york jews have got to live like everybody 
else," i says.  
      i went on back to the store. earl was busy up front. i went on back to 
the desk and read lorraine's letter. "dear daddy wish you were here. no 
good parties when daddys out of town i miss my sweet daddy." i reckon 
she does. last time i gave her forty dollars. gave it to her. i never promise 
a woman anything nor let her know what i'm going to give her. that's the 
only way to manage them. always keep them guessing. if you cant think of 
any other way to surprise them, give them a bust in the jaw.  
      i tore it up and burned it over the spittoon. i make it a rule never to 
keep a scrap

of paper bearing a woman's hand, and i never write them at 
all. lorraine is always after me to write to her but i says anything i forgot 
to tell you will save till i get to memphis again but i says i dont mind you 
writing me now and then in a plain envelope, but if you ever try to call me 
up on the telephone, memphis wont hold you i says. i says when i'm up 
there i'm one of the boys, but i'm not going to have any woman calling me 
on the telephone. here i says, giving her the forty dollars. if you ever get 
drunk and take a notion to call me on the phone, just r

t even come down 
town anymore but just sat there all day with the decanter i could see the 

bottom of his nightshirt and his bare legs and hear the decanter clinking 
until finally t.p. had to pour it for him and she says you have no respect 
for your father's memory and i says i dont know why not it sure is 
preserved well enough to last only if i'm crazy too god knows what i'll do 
about it just to look at water makes me sick and i'd just as soon swallow 
gasoline as a glass of whiskey and lorraine telling them he may not drink 
but if you dont believe he's a man i can tell you how to find out she says if i 
catch you fooling with any of these whores you know what i'll do she says 
i'll whip her grabbing at her i'll whip her as long as i can find her she says

she'd have to work some to feed a few invalids and idiots and niggers, 
because how could i have the face to bring anybody there. i've too much 
respect for anybody to do that. i'm a man, i can stand it, it's my own flesh 
and blood and i'd like to see the color of the man's eyes that would speak 
disrespectful of any woman that was my friend it's these dam good women 
that do it i'd like to see the good, church-going woman that's half as square 
as lorraine, whore or no whore. like i say if i was to get married you'd go 
up like a balloon and you know it and she says i want you to be happy to 
have a family of your own not to slave your life away for us. but i'll be gone 

soon and then you can take a wife but you'll never find a woman who is 
worthy of you and i says yes i could. you'd get right up out of your grave 
you know you would. i says no thank you i have all the women i can take 
care of now if i married a wife she'd probably turn out t

camphor on sunday, while if he went on he could not be sure. but if he 
went back, he would be an hour and a half later in reaching mottson. 
"maybe i can drive slow," he said. "maybe i can drive slow, thinking of 
something else...."    

     he got in and started. "i'll think of something else," he said, so he 
thought about lorraine. he imagined himself in bed with her, only he was 
just lying beside her, pleading with her to help him, then he thought of the 
money again, and that he had been outwitted by a woman, a girl. if he 
could just believe it was the man who had robbed him. but to have been 
robbed of that which was to have compensated him for the lost job, which 
he had acquired through so much effort and risk, by the very symbol of the 
lost job itself, and worst of all, by a bitch of a girl. he drove on, shieldi
