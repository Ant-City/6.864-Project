Student - 
      A disciple at Socrates's school who shows Strepsiades the ropes with characteristic verbal flair and an air of secrecy worthy of the Free-Masons. The Student takes great, albeit serious, delight in the minutiae of Socrates's scientific investigations. He is, however, defensive of his school when Strepsiades drops by and he acts defensively, even a bit neurotically, in order to maintain the order and sanctity of their proceedings.
