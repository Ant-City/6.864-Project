the ymca the last night of the month.and if it's around
october twentieth and everything smoky-smelling and the sky orange and ash grey at twilight,
it seems hallowe'en will never come in a fall of broomsticks and a soft flap of bedsheets around
corners.
but one strange wild dark long year, hallowe'en came early.
one year hallowe'en came on october 24, three hours after midnight.
at that time, james nightshade of 97 oak street was thirteen years, eleven months,
twenty-three days old. next door, william halloway was thirteen years, eleven months and
twenty-four days old.both touched toward fourteen; it almost trembled in their hands.
and that was the october week when they grew up overnight, and were never so young any
more…

the seller of lightning-rods arrived just ahead of the storm. he came along the street of
green town, illinois, in the late cloudy october day, sneaking glances over his shoulder.

he empty trees.sunlight, breaking through a small rift in
the clouds, minted a last few oak leaves all gold.but the sun vanished, the coins were spent,
the air blew grey; the salesman shook himself from the spell.
the salesman edged slowly up the lawn.
'boy, ' he said. 'what's your name?'
and the first boy, with hair as blond-white as milk thistle, shut up one eye, tilted his head,
and looked at the salesman with a single eye as open, bright and clear as a drop of summer
rain.
'will,' he said. 'william halloway.'
the storm gentleman turned. 'and you?'
the second boy did not move, but lay stomach down on the autumn grass, debating as if he
might make up a name. his hair was wild, thick, and the glossy colour of waxed chestnuts. his
eyes, fixed to some distant point within himself, were mint rock-crystal green.at last he put a
blade of dry grass in his casual mouth.
'jim nightshade,' he said.
the storm salesman nodded as if he had known it all along.
'nightshade. that's quite a name.'
'and only fitting,

lien deserts slumbered. up front was the desk where the nice old lady, miss
watriss, purple-stamped your books, but down off away were tibet and antarctica, the congo.
there went miss wills, the other librarian, through outer mongolia, calmly toting fragments of
peiping and yokohama and the celebes. way down the third book corridor, an oldish man
whispered his broom along in the dark, mounding the fallen…
will stared.
it was always a surprise - that old man, his work, his name.
that's charles william halloway, thought will, not grand-father, not far-wandering, ancient
uncle, as some might think, but…my father.
so, looking back down the corridor, was dad shocked to see he owned a son who visited this
separate 20,000-fathoms-deep world? dad always seemed stunned when will rose up before
him, as if they had met a lifetime ago and one had grown old while the other stayed young, and
this fact stood between…
far off, the old man smiled.
they approached each other, carefully.
'is that you, will? grown

t there are times when we're all autumn people.'
'not you,' dad.
'not you, mr halloway!'
he turned quickly to see both appraising him, paleness next to paleness, hands on knees as
if to bolt.
'it's a way of speaking.easy, boys, i'm after the facts. will, do you really know your dad?
shouldn't you know me, and me you, if it's going to be us'ns against them'ns?'
'hey, yeah,' breathed jim. 'who are you?'
'we know who he is, darn it!' will protested.
'do we?' said will's father. 'let's see. charles william halloway. nothing extraordinary about
me except i'm fifty-four, which is always extraordinary to the man inside it.born in sweet
water, lived in chicago, survived in new york, brooded in detroit, floundered in lots of places,
arrived here late, after living in libraries around the country all those years because i liked being
alone, liked matching up in books what i'd seen on the roads. then in the middle of all the
running away, which i called travel, in my thirty-ninth year, your mother fixed me with

he peculiar gravity of a certain group of stacks tug him forward.
‘you here, jim…? or… over behind…?’
he shoved a trolley of books mindlessly off on rubber rollers to bump through the night.a
long way off, it crashed and spilled its contents to the floor like so many dead black ravens.
‘smart hide-and-seekers, both,’ said mr. dark. ‘but someone's smarter. did you hear the
carousel calliope tonight? did you know, someone dear to you was down to the carousel? will?
willy? william. william halloway. where's your mother tonight?’
silence.
‘she was out riding the night wind, willy-william.around. we put her on.around. we left her
on.around.you hear, willy? around, a year, another year, another, around, around!’
dad! thought will. where are you!
in the far room, charles halloway, seated, his heart pounding, heard and thought, he won't
find them, i won't move unless he does, he can't find them, they won't listen! they won't
believe! he'll go away!

his left hand,reaching the ninth shelf as he panted, grunted, encountered empty space - no
books.
‘boys, are you here on everest?’
silence.except for the faint sobbing, nearer now.
‘is it cold here? colder? coldest?’
the eyes of the illustrated man came abreast of the eleventh shelf.
like a corpse laid rigid out, face down just three inches away, was jim nightshade.
one shelf further up in the catacomb, eyes trembling with tears, lay william halloway.
‘well,’ said mr. dark.
he reached a hand to pat will's head.
‘hello,’ he said.

to will, the palm of the hand that drifted up was like a moon rising.
upon it was the fiery blue-inked portrait of himself. jim, too, saw a hand before his face.
his own picture looked back at him from the palm.
the hand with will's picture grabbed will.
the hand with jim's picture grabbed jim.

u! come back!’
and, far over away on the far side of the carousel, traveling, fast-traveling, jim fought with
his own hands, the pole, the empty wind-whipped journey, the growing night, the wheeling
stars. he let go the pole. he grabbed it.and still his right hand trailed down and out, begging
will's last full ounce of strength.
‘jim!’
jim came around. there, below, in the black-night station from which this train pulled away
forever in a flurry of ticket-punch confetti, he saw will-willy-william halloway, young pal, young
friend who would seem younger still at the end of this journey, and not just young but
unknown! vaguely remembered from some other time in some other year… but now that boy,
that friend, that younger friend,ran along by the train,reached up, asking passage? or
demanding he get off? which?!
‘jim! remember me?’
will lunged his final lunge. fingers touched fingers, palm touched palm.
jim's face, white cold, stared down.
