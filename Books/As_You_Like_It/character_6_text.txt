  rosalind. i would we could do so; for her benefits are mightily
    misplaced; and the bountiful blind woman doth most mistake in her
    gifts to women.

  celia. 'tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce makes
    honest; and those that she makes honest she makes very
    ill-favouredly.

  rosalind. nay; now thou goest from fortune's office to nature's:
    fortune reigns in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of
    nature.

                         enter touchstone


  celia. no; when nature hath made a fair creature, may she not by
    fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath given us wit to
    flout at fortune, hath not fortune sent in this fool to cut off
    the argument?

  rosalind. indeed, there is fortune too hard for nature, when
    fortune makes nature's natural the cutter-off of nature's wit.

  celia. peradventure this is not fortune's work neither, but
    nature's, who perceiveth our natural wits too dull to reason of

  such goddesses, and hath sent this natural for our whetstone; for
    always the dullness of the fool is the whetstone of the wits.
    how now, wit! whither wander you?

  touchstone. mistress, you must come away to your father.

  celia. were you made the messenger?

  touchstone. no, by mine honour; but i was bid to come for you.

  rosalind. where learned you that oath, fool?

  touchstone. of a certain knight that swore by his honour they were
    good pancakes, and swore by his honour the mustard was naught.
    now i'll stand to it, the pancakes were naught and the mustard
    was good, and yet was not the knight forsworn.

  celia. how prove you that, in the great heap of your knowledge?

  rosalind. ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

  touchstone. stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and swear
    by your beards that i am a knave.

  celia. by our bear

ds, if we had them, thou art.

  touchstone. by my knavery, if i had it, then i were. but if you
    swear by that that not, you are not forsworn; no more was this
    knight, swearing by his honour, for he never had any; or if he
    had, he had sworn it away before ever he saw those pancackes or
    that mustard.

  celia. prithee, who is't that thou mean'st?

  touchstone. one that old frederick, your father, loves.

  celia. my father's love is enough to honour him. enough, speak no
    more of him; you'll be whipt for taxation one of these days.

  touchstone. the more pity that fools may not speak wisely what wise
    men do foolishly.

  celia. by my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little wit that
    fools have was silenced, the little foolery that wise men have
    makes a great show. here comes monsieur le beau.

    monsieur le beau. what's the news?

  le beau. fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

  celia. sport! of what colour?

  le beau. what colour, madam? how shall i answer you?

  rosalind. as wit and fortune will.

  touchstone. or as the destinies decrees.

  celia. well said; that was laid on with a trowel.

  touchstone. nay, if i keep not my rank-

  rosalind. thou losest thy old smell.

  le beau. you amaze me, ladies. i would have told you of good
    wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

  rosalind. yet tell us the manner of the wrestling.

  le beau. i will tell you the beginning, and, if it please your
    ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is yet to do; and

    wrestler; which charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of
    his ribs, that there is little hope of life in him. so he serv'd
    the second, and so the third. yonder they lie; the poor old man,
    their father, making such pitiful dole over them that all the
    beholders take his part with weeping.

  rosalind. alas!

  touchstone. but what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies have
    lost?

  le beau. why, this that i speak of.

  touchstone. thus men may grow wiser every day. it is the first time
    that ever i heard breaking of ribs was sport for ladies.

  celia. or i, i promise thee.

    his sides? is there yet another dotes upon rib-breaking?

    home i was in a better place; but travellers must be content.

  corin. that is the way to make her scorn you still.

  silvius. o corin, that thou knew'st how i do love her!

  corin. i partly guess; for i have lov'd ere now.

  silvius. no, corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
    though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
    as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
    but if thy love were ever like to mine,

    sword upon a stone, and bid him take that for coming a-night to
    jane smile; and i remember the kissing of her batler, and the

    the wooing of peascod instead of her; from whom i took two cods,

  touchstone. truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
    life; but in respect that it is a shepherd's life, it is nought.
    in respect that it is solitary, i like it very well; but in
    respect that it is private, it is a very vile life. now in
    respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in respect
    it is not in the court, it is tedious. as it is a spare life,

t any philosophy in
    thee, shepherd?

  corin. no more but that i know the more one sickens the worse at
    ease he is; and that he that wants money, means, and content, is
    without three good friends; that the property of rain is to wet,
    and fire to burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep; and that a
    great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that he that hath
    learned no wit by nature nor art may complain of good breeding,
    or comes of a very dull kindred.

  touchstone. such a one is a natural philosopher. wast ever in
    court, shepherd?

  corin. no, truly.

  touchstone. then thou art damn'd.

  corin. nay, i hope.

  touchstone. truly, thou art damn'd, like an ill-roasted egg, all on
    one side.

  corin. for not being at court? your reason.

  touchstone. why, if thou never wast at court thou never saw'st good
    manners; if thou never saw'st good manners, then thy manners must
    be wicked; and wickedness is sin, and sin is damnatio

  corin. not a whit, touchstone. those that are good manners at the
    court are as ridiculous in the country as the behaviour of the
    country is most mockable at the court. you told me you salute not
    at the court, but you kiss your hands; that courtesy would be
    uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds.

  touchstone. instance, briefly; come, instance.

  corin. why, we are still handling our ewes; and their fells, you
    know, are greasy.

  touchstone. why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not the
    grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of a man?
    shallow, shallow. a better instance, i say; come.

  corin. besides, our hands are hard.

    piece of flesh indeed! learn of the wise, and perpend: civet is
    of a baser birth than tar- the very uncleanly flux of a cat.

  duke senior. i do remember in this shepherd boy
    some lively touches of my daughter's favour.

  orlando. my lord, the first time that i ever saw him
    methought he was a brother to your daughter.
    but, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
    and hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
    of many desperate studies by his uncle,
    whom he reports to be a great magician,
    obscured in the circle of this forest.

  jaques. there is, sure, another flood toward, and these couples are
    coming to the ark. here comes a pair of very strange beasts which
    in all tongues are call'd fools.

  touchstone. salutation and greeting to you all!

  jaques. good my lord, bid him welcome. this is the motley-minded
    gentleman that i have so often met in the forest. he hath been a
    courtier, he swears.

  touchstone. if any man doubt that, let him put me to my purgation.
    i have t

    three tailors; i have had four quarrels, and like to have fought
    one.

  jaques. and how was that ta'en up?

  touchstone. faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
    seventh cause.

  jaques. how seventh cause? good my lord, like this fellow.

  duke senior. i like him very well.

  touchstone. god 'ild you, sir; i desire you of the like. i press in
    here, sir, amongst the rest of the country copulatives, to swear
    and to forswear, according as marriage binds and blood breaks. a
    poor virgin, sir, an ill-favour'd thing, sir, but mine own; a
    poor humour of mine, sir, to take that that man else will.
    rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a poor house; as your pearl
    in your foul oyster.

  duke senior. by my faith, he is very swift and sententious.

touchstone. according to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet
    diseases.

  jaques. but, for the seventh cause: how did you find the quarrel on
    the seventh cause?

  touchstone. upon a lie seven times removed- bear your body more
    seeming, audrey- as thus, sir. i did dislike the cut of a certain
    courtier's beard; he sent me word, if i said his beard was not
    cut well, he was in the mind it was. this is call'd the retort
    courteous. if i sent him word again it was not well cut, he would
    send me word he cut it to please himself. this is call'd the quip
    modest. if again it was not well cut, he disabled my judgment.
    this is call'd the reply

 churlish. if again it was not well cut,
    he would answer i spake not true. this is call'd the reproof
    valiant. if again it was not well cut, he would say i lie.
    this is call'd the countercheck quarrelsome. and so to the lie
    circumstantial and the lie direct.

  jaques. and how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

  touchstone. i durst go no further than the lie circumstantial, nor
    he durst not give me the lie direct; and so we measur'd swords
    and parted.

  jaques. can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

  touchstone. o, sir, we quarrel in print by the book, as you have
    books for good manners. i will name you the degrees. the first,
    the retort courteous; the second, the quip modest; the third, the
    reply churlish; the fourth, the reproof valiant; the fifth, the
