uffled in and out of
the stores around it, took their time about everything. a day was twenty-four

hours long but seemed longer. there was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go,
nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries
of maycomb county. but it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people:
maycomb county had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.
we lived on the main residential street in townâ€” atticus, jem and i, plus
calpurnia our cook. jem and i found our father satisfactory: he played with us,
read to us, and treated us with courteous detachment.
calpurnia was something else again. she was all angles and bones; she was
nearsighted; she squinted; her hand was wide as a bed slat and twice as hard. she
was always ordering me out of the kitchen, asking me why i couldnâ€™t behave as
well as jem when she knew he was older, and calling me home when i wasnâ€™t
ready to come. our battles were epic and one-sided. calpurnia a

of their first year of marriage; four years later i was born, and two
years later our mother died from a sudden heart attack. they said it ran in her
family. i did not miss her, but i think jem did. he remembered her clearly, and
sometimes in the middle of a game he would sigh at length, then go off and play
by himself behind the car-house. when he was like that, i knew better than to
bother him.
when i was almost six and jem was nearly ten, our summertime boundaries
(within calling distance of calpurnia) were mrs. henry lafayette duboseâ€™s house
two doors to the north of us, and the radley place three doors to the south. we
were never tempted to break them. the radley place was inhabited by an
unknown entity the mere description of whom was enough to make us behave for
days on end; mrs. dubose was plain hell.
that was the summer dill came to us.
early one morning as we were beginning our dayâ€™s play in the back yard, jem and
i heard something next door in miss rachel haverfordâ€™s collard pa

se mr. radleyâ€™s posture was ramrod straight.
he never spoke to us. when he passed we would look at the ground and say,
â€œgood morning, sir,â€ and he would cough in reply. mr. radleyâ€™s elder son lived
in pensacola; he came home at christmas, and he was one of the few persons we
ever saw enter or leave the place. from the day mr. radley took arthur home,
people said the house died.
but there came a day when atticus told us heâ€™d wear us out if we made any noise
in the yard and commissioned calpurnia to serve in his absence if she heard a
sound out of us. mr. radley was dying.
he took his time about it. wooden sawhorses blocked the road at each end of the
radley lot, straw was put down on the sidewalk, traffic was diverted to the back
street. dr. reynolds parked his car in front of our house and walked to the
radleyâ€™s every time he called. jem and i crept around the yard for days. at last
the sawhorses were taken away, and we stood watching from the front porch
when mr. radley made his fi

nal journey past our house.
â€œthere goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into,â€ murmured calpurnia,
and she spat meditatively into the yard. we looked at her in surprise, for
calpurnia rarely commented on the ways of white people.
the neighborhood thought when mr. radley went under boo would come out,
but it had another think coming: booâ€™s elder brother returned from pensacola and
took mr. radleyâ€™s place. the only difference between him and his father was
their ages. jem said mr. nathan radley â€œbought cotton,â€ too. mr. nathan would
speak to us, however, when we said good morning, and sometimes we saw him
coming from town with a magazine in his hand.

seemed to be expected of us, and the class received these impressionistic
revelations in silence. i was bored, so i began a letter to dill. miss caroline
caught me writing and told me to tell my father to stop teaching me. â€œbesides,â€
she said. â€œwe donâ€™t write in the first grade, we print. you wonâ€™t learn to write
until youâ€™re in the third grade.â€
calpurnia was to blame for this. it kept me from driving her crazy on rainy days, i
guess. she would set me a writing task by scrawling the alphabet firmly across the
top of a tablet, then copying out a chapter of the bible beneath. if i reproduced
her penmanship satisfactorily, she rewarded me with an open-faced sandwich of
bread and butter and sugar. in calpurniaâ€™s teaching, there was no sentimentality: i
seldom pleased her and she seldom rewarded me.
â€œeverybody who goes home to lunch hold up your

breaking into my new grudge against calpurnia.
the town children did so, and she looked us over.
â€œeverybody who brings his lunch put it on top of his desk.â€
molasses buckets appeared from nowhere, and the ceiling danced with metallic
light. miss caroline walked up and down the rows peering and poking into lunch
containers, nodding if the contents pleased her, frowning a little at others. she
stopped at walter cunninghamâ€™s desk. â€œwhereâ€™s yours?â€ she asked.
walter cunninghamâ€™s face told everybody in the first grade he had hookw

em seemed to have little fear of boo radley now that walter and i walked beside
him. indeed, jem grew boastful: â€œi went all the way up to the house once,â€ he said
to walter.
â€œanybody who went up to the house once oughta not to still run every time he
passes it,â€ i said to the clouds above.
â€œand whoâ€™s runninâ€˜, miss priss?â€
â€œyou are, when ainâ€™t anybody with you.â€
by the time we reached our front steps walter had forgotten he was a
cunningham. jem ran to the kitchen and asked calpurnia to set an extra plate, we
had company. atticus greeted walter and began a discussion about crops neither
jem nor i could follow.
â€œreason i canâ€™t pass the first grade, mr. finch, is iâ€™ve had to stay out everâ€˜ spring
anâ€™ help papa with the choppinâ€˜, but thereâ€™s anotherâ€™n at the house now thatâ€™s

â€œdid you pay a bushel of potatoes for him?â€ i asked, but atticus shook his head at
me.
while walter piled food on his plate, he and atticus talked together like two men

to the wonderment of jem and me. atticus was expounding upon farm problems
when walter interrupted to ask if there was any molasses in the house. atticus
summoned calpurnia, who returned bearing the syrup pitcher. she stood waiting
for walter to help himself. walter poured syrup on his vegetables and meat with a
generous hand. he would probably have poured it into his milk glass had i not
asked what the sam hill he was doing.
the silver saucer clattered when he replaced the pitcher, and he quickly put his
hands in his lap. then he ducked his head.
atticus shook his head at me again. â€œbut heâ€™s gone and drowned his dinner in
syrup,â€ i protested. â€œheâ€™s pour

it was then that calpurnia requested my presence in the kitchen.
she was furious, and when she was furious calpurniaâ€™s grammar became erratic.
when in tranquility, her grammar was as good as anybodyâ€™s in maycomb. atticus
said calpurnia had more education than most colored folks.

when she squinted down at me the tiny lines around her eyes deepened. â€œthereâ€™s
some folks who donâ€™t eat like us,â€ she whispered fiercely, â€œbut you ainâ€™t called on
to contradict â€˜em at the table when they donâ€™t. that boyâ€™s yoâ€™ compâ€™ny and if he
wants to eat up the table cloth you let him, you hear?â€
â€œhe ainâ€™t company, cal, heâ€™s just a cunningham-â€

calpurnia sent me through the swinging door to the diningroom with a stinging
smack. i retrieved my plate and finished dinner in the kitchen, thankful, though,
that i was spared the humiliation of facing them again. i told calpurnia to just
wait, iâ€™d fix her: one of these days when she wasnâ€™t looking iâ€™d go off and drown
myself in barkerâ€™s eddy and then sheâ€™d be sorry. besides, i added, sheâ€™d already
gotten me in trouble once today: she had taught me to write and it was all her
fault. â€œhush

jem and walter returned to school ahead of me: staying behind to advise atticus
of calpurniaâ€™s iniquities was worth a solitary sprint past the radley place. â€œshe
likes jem betterâ€™n she likes me, anyway,â€ i concluded, and suggested that atticus
lose no time in packing her off.
â€œhave you ever considered that jem doesnâ€™t worry her half as much?â€ atticusâ€™s
voice was flinty. â€œiâ€™ve no intention of getting rid of her, now or ever. we couldnâ€™t
operate a single day without cal, have you ever thought of that? you think about
how much cal does for you, and you mind her, you

i returned to school and hated calpurnia steadily until a sudden shriek shattered
my resentments. i looked up to see miss caroline standing in the middle of the
room, sheer horror flooding her face. apparently she had revived enough to
persevere in her profession.
â€œitâ€™s alive!â€ she screamed.
the male population of the class rushed as one to her assistance. lord, i thought,

and writing made me think of running away.
by late afternoon most of my traveling plans were complete; when jem and i
raced each other up the sidewalk to meet atticus coming home from work, i
didnâ€™t give him much of a race. it was our habit to run meet atticus the moment

we saw him round the post office corner in the distance. atticus seemed to have
forgotten my noontime fall from grace; he was full of questions about school. my
replies were monosyllabic and he did not press me.
perhaps calpurnia sensed that my day had been a grim one: she let me watch her
fix supper. â€œshut your eyes and open your mouth and iâ€™ll give you a surprise,â€ she
said.
it was not often that she made crackling bread, she said she never had time, but
with both of us at school today had been an easy one for her. she knew i loved
crackling bread.
â€œi missed you today,â€ she said. â€œthe house got so lonesome â€˜long about two
oâ€™clock i had to turn on the radio.â€
â€œwhy? jemâ€™n me ainâ€™t ever in the hou

â€œi know,â€ she said, â€œbut one of youâ€™s always in callinâ€˜ distance. i wonder how
much of the day i spend just callinâ€™ after you. well,â€ she said, getting up from the
kitchen chair, â€œitâ€™s enough time to make a pan of cracklinâ€˜ bread, i reckon. you
run along now and let me get supper on the table.â€
calpurnia bent down and kissed me. i ran along, wondering what had come over
her. she had wanted to make up with me, that was it. she had always been too
hard on me, she had at last seen the error of her fractious ways, she was sorry and
too stubborn to say so. i was weary from the dayâ€™s crimes.
after supper, atticus sat down with the paper and called, â€œscout, ready to read?â€
the lord sent me more than i could bear, and i went to the front porch. atticus
followed me.
â€œsomething wrong, scout?â€

â€œspit it out right now!â€
i spat it out. the tang was fading, anyway. â€œiâ€™ve been chewinâ€˜ it all afternoon and
i ainâ€™t dead yet, not even sick.â€
jem stamped his foot. â€œdonâ€™t you know youâ€™re not supposed to even touch the
trees over there? youâ€™ll get killed if you do!â€
â€œyou touched the house once!â€
â€œthat was different! you go gargleâ€”right now, you hear me?â€
â€œainâ€™t neither, itâ€™ll take the taste outa my mouth.â€
â€œyou donâ€™t â€˜nâ€™ iâ€™ll tell calpurnia on you!â€
rather than risk a tangle with calpurnia, i did as jem told me. for some reason,
my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship:
calpurniaâ€™s tyranny, unfairness, and meddling in my business had faded to gentle
grumblings of general disapproval. on my part, i went to much trouble,
sometimes, not to provoke her.
summer was on the way; jem and i awaited it with impatience. summer was our
best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying

â€œhow can you keep from passing through one?â€
â€œyou canâ€™t,â€ said jem. â€œsometimes they stretch all the way across the road, but if
you hafta go through one you say, â€˜angel-bright, life-in-death; get off the road,
donâ€™t suck my breath.â€™ that keeps â€˜em from wrapping around you-â€
â€œdonâ€™t you believe a word he says, dill,â€ i said. â€œcalpurnia says thatâ€™s nigger-

jem scowled darkly at me, but said, â€œwell, are we gonna play anything or not?â€

â€œletâ€™s roll in the tire,â€ i suggested.
jem sighed. â€œyou know iâ€™m too big.â€
â€œyou câ€™n push.â€
i ran to the back yard and pulled an old car tire from under the house. i slapped it
up to the front yard. â€œiâ€™m first,â€ i said.

jem arbitrated, awarded me first push with an extra time for dill, and i folded

€œwhy donâ€™t you get it?â€ i screamed.
jem was silent.
â€œgo on, it ainâ€™t far inside the gate. why, you even touched the house once,

jem looked at me furiously, could not decline, ran down the sidewalk, treaded
water at the gate, then dashed in and retrieved the tire.
â€œsee there?â€ jem was scowling triumphantly. â€œnothinâ€˜ to it. i swear, scout,
sometimes you act so much like a girl itâ€™s mortifyinâ€™.â€
there was more to it than he knew, but i decided not to tell him.
calpurnia appeared in the front door and yelled, â€œlemonade time! you all get in
outa that hot sun â€˜fore you fry alive!â€ lemonade in the middle of the morning was
a summertime ritual. calpurnia set a pitcher and three glasses on the porch, then
went about her business. being out of jemâ€™s good graces did not worry me
especially. lemonade would restore his good humor.
jem gulped down his second glassful and slapped his chest. â€œi know what we are
going to play,â€ he announced. â€œsomething new, so

dill was a villainâ€™s villain: he could get into any character part assigned him, and
appear tall if height was part of the devilry required. he was as good as his worst
performance; his worst performance was gothic. i reluctantly played assorted
ladies who entered the script. i never thought it as much fun as tarzan, and i
played that summer with more than vague anxiety despite jemâ€™s assurances that
boo radley was dead and nothing would get me, with him and calpurnia there in
the daytime and atticus home at night.
jem was a born hero.
it was a melancholy little drama, woven from bits and scraps of gossip and
neighborhood legend: mrs. radley had been beautiful until she married mr.
radley and lost all her money. she also lost most of her teeth, her hair, and her
right forefinger (dillâ€™s contribution. boo bit it off one night when he couldnâ€™t find
any cats and squirrels to eat.); she sat in the livingroom and cried most of the
time, while boo slowly whitt

the three of us were the boys who got into trouble; i was the probate judge, for a
change; dill led jem away and crammed him beneath the steps, poking him with
the brushbroom. jem would reappear as needed in the shapes of the sheriff,
assorted townsfolk, and miss stephanie crawford, who had more to say about the
radleys than anybody in maycomb.
when it was time to play booâ€™s big scene, jem would sneak into the house, steal
the scissors from the sewing-machine drawer when calpurniaâ€™s back was turned,
then sit in the swing and cut up newspapers. dill would walk by, cough at jem,
and jem would fake a plunge into dillâ€™s thigh. from where i stood it looked real.
when mr. nathan radley passed us on his daily trip to town, we would stand still
and silent until he was out of sight, then wonder what he would do to us if he
suspected. our activities halted when any of the neighbors appeared, and once i

issuing public announcements, wedding invitations, setting off the fire siren, and
giving first-aid instructions when dr. reynolds was away.
when atticus finally called us to order and bade us look at our plates instead of
out the windows, jem asked, â€œhow do you make a snowman?â€
â€œi havenâ€™t the slightest idea,â€ said atticus. â€œi donâ€™t want you all to be
disappointed, but i doubt if thereâ€™ll be enough snow for a snowball, even.â€
calpurnia came in and said she thought it was sticking. when we ran to the back
yard, it was covered with a feeble layer of soggy snow.
â€œwe shouldnâ€™t walk about in it,â€ said jem. â€œlook, every step you takeâ€™s wasting
it.â€
i looked back at my mushy footprints. jem said if we waited until it snowed some
more we could scrape it all up for a snowman. i stuck out my tongue and caught a
fat flake. it burned.
â€œjem, itâ€™s hot!â€
â€œno it ainâ€™t, itâ€™s so cold it burns. now donâ€™t eat it, scout,

â€œsheâ€™s really impressed with yourâ€”accomplishments.â€
atticus strolled over to miss maudieâ€™s sidewalk, where they engaged in an arm-
waving conversation, the only phrase of which i caught was â€œâ€¦erected an
absolute morphodite in that yard! atticus, youâ€™ll never raise â€˜em!â€
the snow stopped in the afternoon, the temperature dropped, and by nightfall mr.
averyâ€™s direst predictions came true: calpurnia kept every fireplace in the house
blazing, but we were cold. when atticus came home that evening he said we
were in for it, and asked calpurnia if she wanted to stay with us for the night.
calpurnia glanced up at the high ceilings and long windows and said she thought
sheâ€™d be warmer at her house. atticus drove her home in the car.
before i went to sleep atticus put more coal on the fire in my room. he said the
thermometer registered sixteen, that it was the coldest night in his memory, and

my stomach turned to water and i nearly threw up when jem held out the blanket
and crept toward me. â€œhe sneaked out of the houseâ€”turn â€˜roundâ€”sneaked up,

atticus said dryly, â€œdo not let this inspire you to further glory, jeremy.â€
jem scowled, â€œi ainâ€™t gonna do anything to him,â€ but i watched the spark of fresh
adventure leave his eyes. â€œjust think, scout,â€ he said, â€œif youâ€™d just turned
around, youâ€™da seen him.â€
calpurnia woke us at noon. atticus had said we need not go to school that day,
weâ€™d learn nothing after no sleep. calpurnia said for us to try and clean up the

front yard.
miss maudieâ€™s sunhat was suspended in a thin layer of ice, like a fly in amber,
and we had to dig under the dirt for her hedge-clippers. we found her in her back
yard, gazing at her frozen charred azaleas. â€œweâ€™re bringing back your things,
miss maudie,â€ said jem. â€œweâ€™re awful sorry.â€

â€œof course they do, scout.â€
â€œthen why did cecil say you defended niggers? he made it sound like you were

atticus sighed. â€œiâ€™m simply defending a negroâ€”his nameâ€™s tom robinson. he
lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. heâ€™s a member of
calpurniaâ€™s church, and cal knows his family well. she says theyâ€™re clean-living
folks. scout, you arenâ€™t old enough to understand some things yet, but thereâ€™s
been some high talk around town to the effect that i shouldnâ€™t do much about

miss maudie straightened up and looked toward me. she said, â€œatticus, you are a

when atticus returned he told me to break camp. â€œdonâ€™t you ever let me catch
you pointing that gun at anybody again,â€ he said.
i wished my father was a devil from hell. i sounded out calpurnia on the subject.
â€œmr. finch? why, he can do lots of things.â€

calpurnia scratched her head. â€œwell, i donâ€™t rightly know,â€ she said.
jem underlined it when he asked atticus if he was going out for the methodists

â€œwhat for, jem? i canâ€™t come down the sidewalk every time you want me.â€
â€œthereâ€™s somethinâ€˜ wrong with an old dog down yonder.â€

calpurnia rinsed her hands and followed jem into the yard. â€œi donâ€™t see any dog,â€
she said.
she followed us beyond the radley place and looked where jem pointed. tim
johnson was not much more than a speck in the distance, but he was closer to us.
he walked erratically, as if his right legs were shorter than his left legs. he
reminded me of a car stuck in a sandbed.
â€œheâ€™s gone lopsided,â€ said jem.
calpurnia stared, then grabbed us by the shoulders and ran us home. she shut the

tim johnson reached the side street that ran in front of the radley place, and
what remained of his poor mind made him pause and seem to consider which road
he would take. he made a few hesitant steps and stopped in front of the radley
gate; then he tried to turn around, but was having difficulty.
atticus said, â€œheâ€™s within range, heck. you better get him before he goes down
the side streetâ€”lord knows whoâ€™s around the corner. go inside, cal.â€
calpurnia opened the screen door, latched it behind her, then unlatched it and held
onto the hook. she tried to block jem and me with her body, but we looked out

from beneath her arms.
â€œtake him, mr. finch.â€ mr. tate handed the rifle to atticus; jem and i nearly
fainted.
â€œdonâ€™t waste time, heck,â€ said atticus. â€œgo on.â€
â€œmr. finch, this is a one-shot job.â€
atticus shook his head vehemently: â€œdonâ€™t just stand there, heck! he wonâ€™t wait
all day for youâ€”â€
â€œfor godâ€™s sake, mr

ere he is! miss and youâ€™ll go straight into the
radley house! i canâ€™t shoot that well and you know it!â€
â€œi havenâ€™t shot a gun in thirty yearsâ€”â€
mr. tate almost threw the rifle at atticus. â€œiâ€™d feel mighty comfortable if you did
now,â€ he said.
in a fog, jem and i watched our father take the gun and walk out into the middle
of the street. he walked quickly, but i thought he moved like an underwater
swimmer: time had slowed to a nauseating crawl.
when atticus raised his glasses calpurnia murmured, â€œsweet jesus help him,â€
and put her hands to her cheeks.
atticus pushed his glasses to his forehead; they slipped down, and he dropped
them in the street. in the silence, i heard them crack. atticus rubbed his eyes and
chin; we saw him blink hard.
in front of the radley gate, tim johnson had made up what was left of his mind.
he had finally turned himself around, to pursue his original course up our street.
he made two steps forward, then stopped and raised his head. we saw his bo

rning up his pockets, so we
headed for town in the early afternoon. jem thought he had enough to buy a
miniature steam engine for himself and a twirling baton for me.
i had long had my eye on that baton: it was at v. j. elmoreâ€™s, it was bedecked
with sequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. it was then my burning ambition
to grow up and twirl with the maycomb county high school band. having
developed my talent to where i could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming
down, i had caused calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she
saw me with a stick in my hand. i felt that i could overcome this defect with a real
baton, and i thought it generous of jem to buy one for me.
mrs. dubose was stationed on her porch when we went by.
â€œwhere are you two going at this time of day?â€ she shouted. â€œplaying hooky, i
suppose. iâ€™ll just call up the principal and tell him!â€ she put her hands on the
wheels of her chair and executed a perfect right face.
â€œaw, itâ€™s saturday, mrs

bent my baton against his knee, snapped it in two and threw it down.
by that time i was shrieking. jem yanked my hair, said he didnâ€™t care, heâ€™d do it
again if he got a chance, and if i didnâ€™t shut up heâ€™d pull every hair out of my
head. i didnâ€™t shut up and he kicked me. i lost my balance and fell on my face.
jem picked me up roughly but looked like he was sorry. there was nothing to say.
we did not choose to meet atticus coming home that evening. we skulked
around the kitchen until calpurnia threw us out. by some voo-doo system
calpurnia seemed to know all about it. she was a less than satisfactory source of
palliation, but she did give jem a hot biscuit-and-butter which he tore in half and
shared with me. it tasted like cotton.
we went to the livingroom. i picked up a football magazine, found a picture of
dixie howell, showed it to jem and said, â€œthis looks like you.â€ that was the
nicest thing i could think to say to him, but it was no help. he sat by the windows,
hunched down

 and disturb him as little as possible.
this change in jem had come about in a matter of weeks. mrs. dubose was not
cold in her graveâ€”jem had seemed grateful enough for my company when he
went to read to her. overnight, it seemed, jem had acquired an alien set of values
and was trying to impose them on me: several times he went so far as to tell me
what to do. after one altercation when jem hollered, â€œitâ€™s time you started beinâ€˜ a
girl and acting right!â€ i burst into tears and fled to calpurnia.
â€œdonâ€™t you fret too much over mister jemâ€”â€ she began.
â€œmister jem?â€
â€œyeah, heâ€™s just about mister jem now.â€
â€œhe ainâ€™t that old,â€ i said. â€œall he needs is somebody to beat him up, and i ainâ€™t
big enough.â€
â€œbaby,â€ said calpurnia, â€œi just canâ€™t help it if mister jemâ€™s growinâ€˜ up. heâ€™s

the beginning of that summer boded well: jem could do as he pleased; calpurnia
would do until dill came. she seemed glad to see me when i appeared in the
kitchen, and by watching her i began to think there was some skill involved in
being a girl.
but summer came and dill was not there. i received a letter and a snapshot from
him. the letter said he had a new father whose picture was enclosed, and he
would have to stay in meridian because they planned to build a fishing boat. his
father was a lawyer like atticus, only much younger. dillâ€™s new father had a

wouldnâ€™t get done if nobody did â€™em.â€
â€œhuh?â€

in addition to jemâ€™s newly developed characteristics, he had acquired a
maddening air of wisdom.
â€œoh, scout, itâ€™s like reorganizing the tax systems of the counties and things. that
kind of thingâ€™s pretty dry to most men.â€
â€œhow do you know?â€
â€œoh, go on and leave me alone. iâ€™m readinâ€˜ the paper.â€
jem got his wish. i departed for the kitchen.
while she was shelling peas, calpurnia suddenly said, â€œwhat am i gonna do
about you allâ€™s church this sunday?â€
â€œnothing, i reckon. atticus left us collection.â€
calpurniaâ€™s eyes narrowed and i could tell what was going through her mind.
â€œcal,â€ i said, â€œyou know weâ€™ll behave. we havenâ€™t done anything in church in
years.â€
calpurnia evidently remembered a rainy sunday when we were both fatherless
and teacherless. left to its own devices, the class tied eunice ann simpson to a
chair and placed her in the furnace r

ning quietly to the sermon when a dreadful banging issued
from the radiator pipes, persisting until someone investigated and brought forth
eunice ann saying she didnâ€™t want to play shadrach any moreâ€”jem finch said
she wouldnâ€™t get burnt if she had enough faith, but it was hot down there.
â€œbesides, cal, this isnâ€™t the first time atticus has left us,â€ i protested.
â€œyeah, but he makes certain your teacherâ€™s gonna be there. i didnâ€™t hear him say
this timeâ€”reckon he forgot it.â€ calpurnia scratched her head. suddenly she
smiled. â€œhowâ€™d you and mister jem like to come to church with me tomorrow?â€
â€œreally?â€
â€œhow â€˜bout it?â€ grinned calpurnia.
if calpurnia had ever bathed me roughly before, it was nothing compared to her
supervision of that saturday nightâ€™s routine. she made me soap all over twice,
drew fresh water in the tub for each rinse; she stuck my head in the basin and
washed it with octagon soap and castile. she had trusted jem for years, but that

he invaded his privacy and provoked an outburst: â€œcanâ€™t anybody take a

next morning she began earlier than usual, to â€œgo over our clothes.â€ when
calpurnia stayed overnight with us she slept on a folding cot in the kitchen; that
morning it was covered with our sunday habiliments. she had put so much starch
in my dress it came up like a tent when i sat down. she made me wear a petticoat
and she wrapped a pink sash tightly around my waist. she went over my patent-
leather shoes with a cold biscuit until she saw her face in them.
â€œitâ€™s like we were goinâ€˜ to mardi gras,â€ said jem. â€œwhatâ€™s all this for, cal?â€
â€œi donâ€™t want anybody say

inâ€˜ i donâ€™t look after my children,â€ she muttered.
â€œmister jem, you absolutely canâ€™t wear that tie with that suit. itâ€™s green.â€
â€œâ€˜smatter with that?â€
â€œsuitâ€™s blue. canâ€™t you tell?â€
â€œhee hee,â€ i howled, â€œjemâ€™s color blind.â€
his face flushed angrily, but calpurnia said, â€œnow you all quit that. youâ€™re gonna
go to first purchase with smiles on your faces.â€
first purchase african m.e. church was in the quarters outside the southern
town limits, across the old sawmill tracks. it was an ancient paint-peeled frame
building, the only church in maycomb with a steeple and bell, called first
purchase because it was paid for from the first earnings of freed slaves. negroes
worshiped in it on sundays and white men gambled in it on weekdays.
the churchyard was

tombstones; newer ones were outlined with brightly colored glass and broken
coca-cola bottles. lightning rods guarding some graves denoted dead who rested
uneasily; stumps of burned-out candles stood at the heads of infant graves. it was
a happy cemetery.
the warm bittersweet smell of clean negro welcomed us as we entered the
churchyardâ€”hearts of love hairdressing mingled with asafoetida, snuff, hoytâ€™s
cologne, brownâ€™s mule, peppermint, and lilac talcum.

when they saw jem and me with calpurnia, the men stepped back and took off
their hats; the women crossed their arms at their waists, weekday gestures of
respectful attention. they parted and made a small pathway to the church door for
us. calpurnia walked between jem and me, responding to the greetings of her
brightly clad neighbors.
â€œwhat you up to, miss cal?â€ said a voice behind us.
calpurniaâ€™s hands went to our shoulders and we stopped and looked around:
standing in the path behind us was a tall negro woman. her weight was o

leg; she rested her left elbow in the curve of her hip, pointing at us with upturned
palm. she was bullet-headed with strange almond-shaped eyes, straight nose, and
an indian-bow mouth. she seemed seven feet high.
i felt calpurniaâ€™s hand dig into my shoulder. â€œwhat you want, lula?â€ she asked,
in tones i had never heard her use. she spoke quietly, contemptuously.
â€œi wants to know why you bringinâ€˜ white chillun to nigger church.â€
â€œtheyâ€™s my compâ€™ny,â€ said calpurnia. again i thought her voice strange: she was
talking like the rest of them.
â€œyeah, anâ€˜ i reckon youâ€™s compâ€™ny at the finch house durinâ€™ the week.â€
a murmur ran through the crowd. â€œdonâ€™t you fret,â€ calpurnia whispered to me,
but the roses on her hat trembled indignantly.
when lula came up the pathway toward us calpurnia said, â€œstop right there,
nigger.â€
lula stopped, but she said, â€œyou ainâ€™t got no business bringinâ€˜ white chillun here
â€”they got their church, we got o

urâ€™n. it is our church, ainâ€™t it, miss cal?â€
calpurnia said, â€œitâ€™s the same god, ainâ€™t it?â€
jem said, â€œletâ€™s go home, cal, they donâ€™t want us hereâ€”â€
i agreed: they did not want us here. i sensed, rather than saw, that we were being
advanced upon. they seemed to be drawing closer to us, but when i looked up at
calpurnia there was amusement in her eyes. when i looked down the pathway
again, lula was gone. in her place was a solid mass of colored people.
one of them stepped from the crowd. it was zeebo, the garbage collector. â€œmister
jem,â€ he said, â€œweâ€™re mighty glad to have you all here. donâ€™t pay no â€˜tention to

lula, sheâ€™s contentious because reverend sykes threatened to church her. sheâ€™s a
troublemaker from way back, got fancy ideas anâ€™ haughty waysâ€”weâ€™re mighty

with that, calpurnia led us to the church door where we were greeted by
reverend sykes, who led us to the front pew.
first purchase was unceiled and unpainted within. along its walls unlighted
kerosene lamps hung on brass brackets; pine benches served as pews. behind the
rough oak pulpit a faded pink silk banner proclaimed god is love, the churchâ€™s
only decoration except a rotogravure print of huntâ€™s the light of the world.
there was no sign of piano, organ, hymn-books, church programsâ€”the familiar

coolness slowly dispelled by the gathering congregation. at each seat was a cheap
cardboard fan bearing a garish garden of gethsemane, courtesy tyndalâ€™s
hardware co. (you-name-it-we-sell-it).
calpurnia motioned jem and me to the end of the row and placed herself between
us. she fished in her purse, drew out her handkerchief, and untied the hard wad of
change in its corner. she gave a dime to me and a dime to jem. â€œweâ€™ve got ours,â€
he whispered. â€œyou keep it,â€ calpurnia said, â€œyouâ€™re my company.â€ jemâ€™s face
showed brief indecision on the ethics of withholding his own dime, but his innate
courtesy won and he shifted his dime to his pocket. i did likewise with no qualms.

â€œsh-h!â€
i turned to calpurnia but was hushed before i opened my mouth. subdued, i fixed
my attention upon reverend sykes, who seemed to be waiting for me to settle
down. â€œwill the music superintendent lead us in the first hymn,â€ he said.
zeebo rose from his pew and walked down the center aisle, stopping in front of us
and facing the congregation. he was carrying a battered hymn-book. he opened it
and said, â€œweâ€™ll sing number two seventy-three.â€
this was too much for me. â€œhowâ€™re we gonna sing it if there ainâ€™

calpurnia smiled. â€œhush baby,â€ she whispered, â€œyouâ€™ll see in a minute.â€
zeebo cleared his throat and read in a voice like the rumble of distant artillery:
â€œthereâ€™s a land beyond the river.â€
miraculously on pitch, a hundred voices sang out zeeboâ€™s words. the last
syllable, held to a husky hum, was followed by zeebo saying, â€œthat we call the
sweet forever.â€
music again swelled around us; the last note lingered and zeebo met it with the
next line: â€œand we only reach that shore by fai

nt, reverend sykes emptied the can onto the table and raked the
coins into his hand. he straightened up and said, â€œthis is not enough, we must
have ten dollars.â€
the congregation stirred. â€œyou all know what itâ€™s forâ€”helen canâ€™t leave those
children to work while tomâ€™s in jail. if everybody gives one more dime, weâ€™ll
have itâ€”â€ reverend sykes waved his hand and called to someone in the back of
the church. â€œalec, shut the doors. nobody leaves here till we have ten dollars.â€
calpurnia scratched in her handbag and brought forth a battered leather coin
purse. â€œnaw cal,â€ jem whispered, when she handed him a shiny quarter, â€œwe can

put ours in. gimme your dime, scout.â€
the church was becoming stuffy, and it occurred to me that reverend sykes
intended to sweat the amount due out of his flock. fans crackled, feet shuffled,
tobacco-chewers were in agony.
reverend sykes startled me by saying sternly, â€œcarlow richardson, i havenâ€™t
seen you up this aisle yet.â€
a thin ma

n in khaki pants came up the aisle and deposited a coin. the
congregation murmured approval.
reverend sykes then said, â€œi want all of you with no children to make a sacrifice
and give one more dime apiece. then weâ€™ll have it.â€
slowly, painfully, the ten dollars was collected. the door was opened, and the
gust of warm air revived us. zeebo lined on jordanâ€™s stormy banks, and church
was over.
i wanted to stay and explore, but calpurnia propelled me up the aisle ahead of
her. at the church door, while she paused to talk with zeebo and his family, jem
and i chatted with reverend sykes. i was bursting with questions, but decided i
would wait and let calpurnia answer them.
â€œwe were â€˜specially glad to have you all here,â€ said reverend sykes. â€œthis
church has no better friend than your daddy.â€
my curiosity burst: â€œwhy were you all takinâ€˜ up collection for tom robinsonâ€™s

â€œdidnâ€™t you hear why?â€ asked re

children to deposit them in whatever shade there was while
their parents workedâ€”usually the babies sat in the shade between two rows of
cotton. those unable to sit were strapped papoose-style on their mothersâ€™ backs,
or resided in extra cotton bags.
reverend sykes hesitated. â€œto tell you the truth, miss jean louise, helenâ€™s
finding it hard to get work these daysâ€¦ when itâ€™s picking time, i think mr. link
deasâ€™ll take her.â€

â€œwhy not, reverend?â€
before he could answer, i felt calpurniaâ€™s hand on my shoulder. at its pressure i
said, â€œwe thank you for lettinâ€˜ us come.â€ jem echoed me, and we made our way
homeward.
â€œcal, i know tom robinsonâ€™s in jail anâ€˜ heâ€™s done somethinâ€™ awful, but why
wonâ€™t folks hire helen?â€ i asked.
calpurnia, in her navy voile dress and tub of a hat, walked between jem and me.
â€œitâ€™s because of what folks say tomâ€™s done,â€ she said. â€œfolks arenâ€™t anxious toâ€”
to have anything to do with any of his family.â€

they were absolute trashâ€”i never heard atticus talk about folks the way he talked
about the ewells. he said-â€

â€œheâ€™s just like our preacher,â€ said jem, â€œbut why do you all sing hymns that
way?â€
â€œlininâ€˜?â€ she asked.
â€œis that what it is?â€
â€œyeah, itâ€™s called lininâ€˜. theyâ€™ve done it that way as long as i can remember.â€
jem said it looked like they could save the collection money for a year and get
some hymn-books.
calpurnia laughed. â€œwouldnâ€™t do any good,â€ she said. â€œthey canâ€™t read.â€

â€œcanâ€™t read?â€ i asked. â€œall those folks?â€
â€œthatâ€™s right,â€ calpurnia nodded. â€œcanâ€™t but about four folks in first purchase
readâ€¦ iâ€™m one of â€˜em.â€
â€œwhereâ€™d you go to school, cal?â€ asked jem.
â€œnowhere. letâ€™s see now, who taught me my letters? it was miss maudie

â€œare you that old?â€
â€œiâ€™m older than mr. finch, even.â€ calpurnia grinned. â€

â€œbut cal,â€ jem protested, â€œyou donâ€™t look even near as old as atticus.â€
â€œcolored folks donâ€™t show their ages so fast,â€ she said.
â€œmaybe because they canâ€™t read. cal, did you teach zeebo?â€
â€œyeah, mister jem. there wasnâ€™t a school even when he was a boy. i made him
learn, though.â€
zeebo was calpurniaâ€™s eldest son. if i had ever thought about it, i would have
known that calpurnia was of mature yearsâ€”zeebo had half-grown childrenâ€”but
then i had never thought about it.
â€œdid you teach him out of a primer, like us?â€ i asked.
â€œno, i made him get a page of the bible every day, and there was a book miss
buford taught me out ofâ€”bet you donâ€™t know where i got it,â€ she said.
we didnâ€™t know.
calpurnia said, â€œyour granddaddy finch gave it to me.â€
â€œwere you from the landing?â€

jem was thunderstruck. â€œyou mean you taught zeebo outa that?â€

â€œthe rest of who?â€
â€œrest of the colored folks. cal, but you talked like they did in churchâ€¦â€
that calpurnia led a modest double life never dawned on me. the idea that she
had a separate existence outside our household was a novel one, to say nothing of
her having command of two languag

i looked over to the radley place, expecting to see its phantom occupant sunning
himself in the swing. the swing was empty.
â€œi mean our porch,â€ said jem.
i looked down the street. enarmored, upright, uncompromising, aunt alexandra
was sitting in a rocking chair exactly as if she had sat there every day of her life.

â€œput my bag in the front bedroom, calpurnia,â€ was the first thing aunt alexandra
said. â€œjean louise, stop scratching your head,â€ was the second thing she said.
calpurnia picked up auntyâ€™s heavy suitcase and opened the door. â€œiâ€™ll take it,â€
said jem, and took it. i heard the suitcase hit the bedroom floor with a thump. the
sound had a dull permanence about it. â€œhave you come for a visit, aunty?â€ i
asked. aunt alexandraâ€™s visits from the landing were rare, and she traveled in
state. she owned a bright green square buick

â€œuh, uh, uh.â€ miss rachel next door had aunty over for coffee in the afternoons,
and mr. nathan radley went so far as to come up in the front yard and say he was
glad to see her.
when she settled in with us and life resumed its daily pace, aunt alexandra
seemed as if she had always lived with us. her missionary society refreshments
added to her reputation as a hostess (she did not permit calpurnia to make the
delicacies required to sustain the society through long reports on rice christians);
she joined and became secretary of the maycomb amanuensis club. to all
parties present and participating in the life of the county, aunt alexandra was one
of the last of her kind: she had river-boat, boarding-school manners; let any moral
come along and she would uphold it; she was born in the objective case; she was
an incurable gossip. when aunt alexandra went to school, self-doubt could not

 was one obscure observation we met head on from a skinny gentleman
when he passed us. which reminded me that i had a question to ask atticus.
â€œwhatâ€™s rape?â€ i asked him that night.
atticus looked around from behind his paper. he was in his chair by the window.
as we grew older, jem and i thought it generous to allow atticus thirty minutes to
himself after supper.
he sighed, and said rape was carnal knowledge of a female by force and without
consent.
â€œwell if thatâ€™s all it is why did calpurnia dry me up when i asked her what it
was?â€
atticus looked pensive. â€œwhatâ€™s that again?â€
â€œwell, i asked calpurnia cominâ€˜ from church that day what it was and she said
ask you but i forgot to and now iâ€™m askinâ€™ you.â€
his paper was now in his lap. â€œagain, please,â€ he said.

enjoy it, but aunt alexandra, who was sitting in a corner quietly sewing, put
down her embroidery and stared at us.

ever knew. he was on his feet. â€œapologize to your aunt,â€ he said.
â€œi didnâ€™t ask her, i asked youâ€”â€
atticus turned his head and pinned me to the wall with his good eye. his voice
was deadly: â€œfirst, apologize to your aunt.â€
â€œiâ€™m sorry, aunty,â€ i muttered.
â€œnow then,â€ he said. â€œletâ€™s get this clear: you do as calpurnia tells you, you do
as i tell you, and as long as your auntâ€™s in this house, you will do as she tells you.

i understood, pondered a while, and concluded that the only way i could retire
with a shred of dignity was to go to the bathroom, where i stayed long enough to
make them think i had to go. returning, i lingered in the hall to hear a fierce
discussion going on in the livingroom. through the door i could see jem on the
sofa with a football magazine in front of his face, his he

â€œatticus, itâ€™s all right to be soft-hearted, youâ€™re an easy man, but you have a
daughter to think of. a daughter whoâ€™s growing up.â€
â€œthatâ€™s what i am thinking of.â€
â€œand donâ€™t try to get around it. youâ€™ve got to face it sooner or later and it might
as well be tonight. we donâ€™t need her now.â€
atticusâ€™s voice was even: â€œalexandra, calpurniaâ€™s not leaving this house until she
wants to. you may think otherwise, but i couldnâ€™t have got along without her all
these years. sheâ€™s a faithful member of this family and youâ€™ll simply have to
accept things the way they are. besides, sister, i donâ€™t want you working your
head off for usâ€”youâ€™ve no reason to do that. we still need cal as much as we
ever did.â€
â€œbut atticusâ€”â€
â€œbesides, i donâ€™t think the childrenâ€™ve suffered one bit from her having brought

aunt alexandra was worrying her embroidery. punk, punk, punk, her needle
broke the taut circle. she stopped, and pulled the cloth tighter: punk-punk-punk.
she was furious.
jem got up and padded across the rug. he motioned me to follow. he led me to
his room and closed the door. his face was grave.

â€œâ€”good night, atticusâ€™s gone all day and sometimes half the night and off in the
legislature and i donâ€™t know whatâ€”you donâ€™t want â€˜em around all the time, dill,
you couldnâ€™t do anything if they were.â€
â€œthatâ€™s not it.â€
as dill explained, i found myself wondering what life would be if jem were

different, even from what he was now; what i would do if atticus did not feel the
necessity of my presence, help and advice. why, he couldnâ€™t get along a day
without me. even calpurnia couldnâ€™t get along unless i was there. they needed
me.
â€œdill, you ainâ€™t telling me rightâ€”your folks couldnâ€™t do without you. they must
be just mean to you. tell you what to do about thatâ€”â€
dillâ€™s voice went on steadily in the darkness: â€œthe thing is, what iâ€™m tryinâ€˜ to say
isâ€”they do get on a lot better without me, i canâ€™t help them any. they ainâ€™t mean.
they buy me everything i want, but itâ€™s nowâ€”youâ€™ve-got-it-go-play-with-it.

â€œdillâ€™ll wanta come,â€ i whispered.
â€œso he will,â€ said jem gloomily.
we leaped over the driveway wall, cut through miss rachelâ€™s side yard and went
to dillâ€™s window. jem whistled bob-white. dillâ€™s face appeared at the screen,
disappeared, and five minutes later he unhooked the screen and crawled out. an
old campaigner, he did not speak until we were on the sidewalk. â€œwhatâ€™s up?â€
â€œjemâ€™s got the look-arounds,â€ an affliction calpurnia said all boys caught at his
age.
â€œiâ€™ve just got this feeling,â€ jem said, â€œjust this feeling.â€
we went by mrs. duboseâ€™s house, standing empty and shuttered, her camellias
grown up in weeds and johnson grass. there were eight more houses to the post
office corner.
the south side of the square was deserted. giant monkey-puzzle bushes bristled
on each corner, and between them an iron hitching rail glistened under the street
lights. a light shone in the county toilet, otherwise that side

â€œyou know, itâ€™s a funny thing about braxton,â€ said atticus. â€œhe despises
negroes, wonâ€™t have one near him.â€
local opinion held mr. underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose
father in a fey fit of humor christened braxton bragg, a name mr. underwood had
done his best to live down. atticus said naming people after confederate generals
made slow steady drinkers.
calpurnia was serving aunt alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at
what i thought was a pleading winning look. â€œyouâ€™re still too little,â€ she said.
â€œiâ€™ll tell you when you ainâ€™t.â€ i said it might help my stomach. â€œall right,â€ she
said, and got a cup from the sideboard. she poured one tablespoonful of coffee
into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk. i thanked her by sticking out my
tongue at it, and looked up to catch auntyâ€™s warning frown. but she was frowning

â€œtalk like what in front of whom?â€ he asked.
â€œlike that in front of calpurnia. you said braxton underwood despises negroes
right in front of her.â€
â€œwell, iâ€™m sure cal knows it. everybody in maycomb knows it.â€
i was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out
when he talked with aunt alexandra. it was a quiet digging in, never outright
irritation. there was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, â€œanything fit to
say at the tableâ€™s fit to say in front of calpurnia. she knows what she means to
this family.â€

atticusâ€™s voice had dropped, and as he turned away from the jury he said
something i did not catch. he said it more to himself than to the court. i punched
jem. â€œwhatâ€™d he say?â€
â€œâ€˜in the name of god, believe him,â€™ i think thatâ€™s what he said.â€
dill suddenly reached over me and tugged at jem. â€œlooka yonder!â€
we followed his finger with sinking hearts. calpurnia was making her way up the
middle aisle, walking straight toward atticus.

she stopped shyly at the railing and waited to get judge taylorâ€™s attention. she
was in a fresh apron and she carried an envelope in her hand.
judge taylor saw her and said, â€œitâ€™s calpurnia, isnâ€™t it?â€
â€œyes sir,â€ she said. â€œcould i just pass this note to mr. finch, please sir? it hasnâ€™t

judge taylor nodded and atticus took

atticus and calpurnia met us downstairs. calpurnia looked peeved, but atticus
looked exhausted.
jem was jumping in excitement. â€œweâ€™ve won, havenâ€™t we?â€
â€œiâ€™ve no idea,â€ said atticus shortly. â€œyouâ€™ve been here all afternoon? go home
with calpurnia and get your supperâ€”and stay home.â€
â€œaw, atticus, let us come back,â€ pleaded jem. â€œplease let us hear the verdict,
please sir.â€
â€œthe jury might be out and back in a minute, we donâ€™t knowâ€”â€ but we could tell
atticus was relenting. â€œwell, youâ€™ve heard it all, so you might as well hear the
rest. tell you what, you all can come back when youâ€™ve eaten your supperâ€”eat
slowly, now, you wonâ€™t miss anything importantâ€”and if the juryâ€™s still out, you
can wait with us. bu

â€œyou think theyâ€™ll acquit him that fast?â€ asked jem.
atticus opened his mouth to answer, but shut it and left us.
i prayed that reverend sykes would save our seats for us, but stopped praying
when i remembered that people got up and left in droves when the jury was outâ€”
tonight, theyâ€™d overrun the drugstore, the o.k. cafÃ© and the hotel, that is, unless
they had brought their suppers too.
calpurnia marched us home: â€œâ€”skin every one of you alive, the very idea, you
children listeninâ€˜ to all that! mister jem, donâ€™t you know betterâ€™n to take your
little sister to that trial? miss alexandraâ€™ll absolutely have a stroke of paralysis
when she finds out! ainâ€™t fittinâ€™ for children to hearâ€¦â€
the streetlights were on, and we glimpsed calpurniaâ€™s indignant profile as we
passed beneath them. â€œmister jem, i thought you was gettinâ€˜ some kinda head on
your shouldersâ€”the very

i was exhilarated. so many things had happened so fast i felt it would take years
to sort them out, and now here was calpurnia giving her precious jem down the
countryâ€”what new marvels would the evening bring?
jem was chuckling. â€œdonâ€™t you want to hear about it, cal?â€
â€œhush your mouth, sir! when you oughta be hanginâ€˜ your head in shame you go
along laughinâ€™â€”â€ calpurnia revived a series of rusty threats that moved jem to
little remorse, and she sailed up the front steps with her classic, â€œif mr. finch

jem went in grinning, and calpurnia nodded

him. â€œsheâ€™s run distracted lookinâ€˜ for youâ€”you watch out she donâ€™t ship you
back to meridian first thing in the morninâ€™.â€
aunt alexandra met us and nearly fainted when calpurnia told her where we
were. i guess it hurt her when we told her atticus said we could go back, because
she didnâ€™t say a word during supper. she just rearranged food on her plate,
looking at it sadly while calpurnia served jem, dill and me with a vengeance.
calpurnia poured milk, dished out potato salad and ham, muttering, â€œâ€˜shamed of

command.

but things are always better in the morning. atticus rose at his usual ungodly hour
and was in the livingroom behind the mobile register when we stumbled in.

jemâ€™s morning face posed the question his sleepy lips struggled to ask.
â€œitâ€™s not time to worry yet,â€ atticus reassured him, as we went to the diningroom.
â€œweâ€™re not through yet. thereâ€™ll be an appeal, you can count on that. gracious

calpurnia said, â€œtom robinsonâ€™s daddy sent you along this chicken this morning.
i fixed it.â€
â€œyou tell him iâ€™m proud to get itâ€”bet they donâ€™t have chicken for breakfast at the
white house. what are these?â€
â€œrolls,â€ said calpurnia. â€œestelle down at the hotel sent â€˜em.â€
atticus looked up at her, puzzled, and she said, â€œyou better step out here and see
whatâ€™s in the kitchen, mr. finch.â€
we followed him. the kitchen table was loaded with enough food to bury the

very grateful,â€ he said. â€œtell themâ€”tell them they must never do this again.

he left the kitchen, went in the diningroom and excused himself to aunt

heard dillâ€™s step in the hall, so calpurnia left atticusâ€™s uneaten breakfast on
the table. between rabbit-bites dill told us of miss rachelâ€™s reaction to last night,
which was: if a man like atticus finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall
itâ€™s his head.
â€œiâ€™da got her told,â€ growled dill, gnawing a chicken leg, â€œbut she didnâ€™t look
much like tellinâ€˜ this morning. said she was up half the night wonderinâ€™ where i
was, said sheâ€™da had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing.â€

a gun aroundâ€™s an invitation to somebody to shoot you.â€
â€œthis is different,â€ i said. â€œwe can ask him to borrow one.â€
we did, and he said, â€œnonsense.â€
dill was of the opinion that an appeal to atticusâ€™s better nature might work: after

all, we would starve if mr. ewell killed him, besides be raised exclusively by
aunt alexandra, and we all knew the first thing sheâ€™d do before atticus was
under the ground good would be to fire calpurnia. jem said it might work if i
cried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. that didnâ€™t work either. but when he
noticed us dragging around the neighborhood, not eating, taking little interest in
our normal pursuits, atticus discovered how deeply frightened we were. he
tempted jem with a new football magazine one night; when he saw jem flip the
pages and toss it aside, he said, â€œwhatâ€™s bothering you, son?â€
jem came to the point: â€œmr. ewell.â€
â€œwhat has happened?â€
â€œnothingâ€™s h

â€œaun-ty,â€ said jem, â€œshe ainâ€™t nine yet.â€
â€œshe may as well learn it now.â€
aunt alexandra had spoken. i was reminded vividly of the last time she had put
her foot down. i never knew why. it was when i was absorbed with plans to visit
calpurniaâ€™s houseâ€”i was curious, interested; i wanted to be her â€œcompany,â€ to
see how she lived, who her friends were. i might as well have wanted to see the
other side of the moon. this time the tactics were different, but aunt alexandraâ€™s
aim was the same. perhaps this was why she had come to live with usâ€”to help us
choose our friends. i would hold her off as long as i could: â€œif theyâ€™re good folks,
then why canâ€™t i be nice to walter?â€
â€œi didnâ€™t say not to be nice to him. you sh

why do they go out of their way to despise each other? scout, i think iâ€™m

calpurnia wore her stiffest starched apron. she carried a tray of charlotte. she
backed up to the swinging door and pressed gently. i admired the ease and grace
with which she handled heavy loads of dainty things. so did aunt alexandra, i
guess, because she had let calpurnia serve today.
august was on the brink of september. dill would be leaving for meridian
tomorrow; today he was off with jem at barkerâ€™s eddy. jem had discovered with
angry amazement that nobody had ever bothered to teach dill how to

creek, they said they were going in naked and i couldnâ€™t come, so i divided the
lonely hours between calpurnia and miss maudie.
today aunt alexandra and her missionary circle were fighting the good fight all
over the house. from the kitchen, i heard mrs. grace merriweather giving a
report in the livingroom on the squalid lives of the mrunas, it sounded like to me.
they put the women out in huts when their time came, whatever that was; they
had no sense of familyâ€”i knew thatâ€™d distress auntyâ€”they subjected children to
terrible ordeals when they were thirteen; they were crawling with yaws and

ms, they chewed up and spat out the bark of a tree into a communal pot
and then got drunk on it.
immediately thereafter, the ladies adjourned for refreshments.
i didnâ€™t know whether to go into the diningroom or stay out. aunt alexandra told
me to join them for refreshments; it was not necessary that i attend the business
part of the meeting, she said itâ€™d bore me. i was wearing my pink sunday dress,
shoes, and a petticoat, and reflected that if i spilled anything calpurnia would
have to wash my dress again for tomorrow. this had been a busy day for her. i
decided to stay out.
â€œcan i help you, cal?â€ i asked, wishing to be of some service.
calpurnia paused in the doorway. â€œyou be still as a mouse in that corner,â€ she
said, â€œanâ€˜ you can help me load up the trays when i come back.â€
the gentle hum of ladiesâ€™ voices grew louder as she opened the door: â€œwhy,

they became quiet, and i knew they had all been served. calpurnia returned and

she murmured, â€œthey donâ€™t make â€˜em these days.â€

well, neither of us was the mayor of birmingham, but i wished i was the
governor of alabama for one day: iâ€™d let tom robinson go so quick the
missionary society wouldnâ€™t have time to catch its breath. calpurnia was telling
miss rachelâ€™s cook the other day how bad tom was taking things and she didnâ€™t
stop talking when i came into the kitchen. she said there wasnâ€™t a thing atticus
could do to make being shut up easier for him, that the last thing he said to
atticus before they took him down to the prison camp was, â€œgood-bye, mr.
finch, there ainâ€™t nothinâ€˜ you can do now, so there ainâ€™t no use tryinâ€™.â€ calpurnia
said atticus told her that the day they took tom to prison he just gave up

she said atticus tried to explain things to him, and that he must do his best not to
lose hope because atticus was doing his best to get him free. miss rachelâ€™s cook

â€”seemed like thatâ€™d be a big comfort to tom. calpurnia said, â€œbecause you ainâ€™t

there ainâ€™t any definite answers to anything. mr. finch couldnâ€™t say somethinâ€™s so
when he doesnâ€™t know for sure itâ€™s so.â€
the front door slammed and i heard atticusâ€™s footsteps in the hall. automatically
i wondered what time it was. not nearly time for him to be home, and on
missionary society days he usually stayed downtown until black dark.

â€œexcuse me, ladies,â€ he said. â€œgo right ahead with your meeting, donâ€™t let me
disturb you. alexandra, could you come to the kitchen a minute? i want to borrow
calpurnia for a while.â€

he didnâ€™t go through the diningroom, but went down the back hallway and
entered the kitchen from the rear door. aunt alexandra and i met him. the
diningroom door opened again and miss maudie joined us. calpurnia had half
risen from her chair.
â€œcal,â€ atticus said, â€œi want you to go with me out to helen robinsonâ€™s houseâ€”â€
â€œwhatâ€™s the matter?â€ aunt alexandra asked, alarmed by the look on my fatherâ€™s
face.
â€œtomâ€™s dead.â€
aunt alexandra put her hands to her mouth.
â€œthey shot him,â€ said atticus. â€œhe was running. it was during their exercise
period. they said he just broke into a blind raving charge at the fence and started
climbing over. right in front of themâ€”â€
â€œdidnâ€™t

nâ€™t they give him any warning?â€ aunt
alexandraâ€™s voice shook.
â€œoh yes, the guards called to him to stop. they fired a few shots in the air, then to
kill. they got him just as he went over the fence. they said if heâ€™d had two good
arms heâ€™d have made it, he was moving that fast. seventeen bullet holes in him.
they didnâ€™t have to shoot him that much. cal, i want you to come out with me
and help me tell helen.â€
â€œyes sir,â€ she murmured, fumbling at her apron. miss maudie went to calpurnia
and untied it.
â€œthis is the last straw, atticus,â€ aunt alexandra said.
â€œdepends on how you look at it,â€ he said. â€œwhat was one negro, more or less,
among two hundred of â€˜em? he wasnâ€™t tom to them, he was an escaping
prisoner.â€
atticus leaned against the refrigerator, pushed up his glasses, and rubbed his eyes.
â€œwe had such a good chance,â€ he said. â€œi told him what i thought, but i couldnâ€™t

â€œyessir, mr. finch.â€
â€œthen letâ€™s go.â€

sat quite still; she was so quiet i wondered if she would faint. i heard miss
maudie breathing as if she had just climbed the steps, and in the diningroom the
ladies chattered happily.
i thought aunt alexandra was crying, but when she took her hands away from her
face, she was not. she looked weary. she spoke, and her voice was flat.
â€œi canâ€™t say i approve of everything he does, maudie, but heâ€™s my brother, and i

â€œyes maâ€™am.â€
â€œthen letâ€™s join the ladies,â€ she said grimly.
their voices swelled when miss maudie opened the door to the diningroom. aunt
alexandra was ahead of me, and i saw her head go up as she went through the
door.
â€œoh, mrs. perkins,â€ she said, â€œyou need some more coffee. let me get it.â€

and so they went, down the row of laughing women, around the diningroom,
refilling coffee cups, dishing out goodies as though their only regret was the
temporary domestic disaster of losing calpurnia. the gentle hum began again.

swimmers are careful not to stay too late.
according to dill, he and jem had just come to the highway when they saw
atticus driving toward them. he looked like he had not seen them, so they both
waved. atticus finally slowed down; when they caught up with him he said,
â€œyouâ€™d better catch a ride back. i wonâ€™t be going home for a while.â€ calpurnia
was in the back seat. jem protested, then pleaded, and atticus said, â€œall right, you
can come with us if you stay in the car.â€
on the way to tom robinsonâ€™s, atticus told them what had happened.
they turned off the highway, rode slowly by the dump and past the ewell
residence, down the narrow lane to the negro cabins. dill said a crowd of black
children were playing marbles in tomâ€™s front yard. atticus parked the car and got
out. calpurnia followed him through the front gate.

a little girl came to the cabin door and stood looking at atticus. dill said her hair
was a wad of tiny stiff pigtails, each ending in a bright bow. she grinned from ear
to ear and walked toward our father, but she was too small to navigate the steps.
dill said atticus went to her, took off his hat, and offered her his finger. she
grabbed it and he eased her down the steps. then he gave her to calpurnia.
sam was trotting behind his mother when they came up. dill said helen said,
â€œâ€˜eveninâ€™, mr. finch, wonâ€™t you have a seat?â€ but she didnâ€™t say any more.

neither did atticus.
â€œscout,â€ said dill, â€œshe just fell down in the dirt. just fell down in the dirt, like a
giant with a big foot just came along and stepped on her. just umpâ€”â€ dillâ€™s fat
foot hit the ground. â€œlike youâ€™d step on an ant.â€
dill said calpurnia and atticus lifted helen to her feet and half carried, h

the third thing happened to helen robinson, tomâ€™s widow. if mr. ewell was as
forgotten as tom robinson, tom robinson was as forgotten as boo radley. but
tom was not forgotten by his employer, mr. link deas. mr. link deas made a
job for helen. he didnâ€™t really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the
way things turned out. i never knew who took care of her children while helen
was away. calpurnia said it was hard on helen, because she had to walk nearly a
mile out of her way to avoid the ewells, who, according to helen, â€œchunked at
herâ€ the first time she tried to use the public road. mr. link deas eventually
received the impression that helen was coming to work each morning from the
wrong direction, and dragged the reason out of her. â€œjust let it be, mr. link,
please suh,â€ helen begged. â€œthe hell i will,â€ said mr. link. he told her to come

came.
â€œâ€˜s matter, aunty?â€ i asked.
â€œoh nothing, nothing,â€ she said, â€œsomebody just walked over my grave.â€ she put
away from her whatever it was that gave her a pinprick of apprehension, and
suggested that i give the family a preview in the livingroom. so jem squeezed me
into my costume, stood at the livingroom door, called out â€œpo-ork,â€ exactly as
mrs. merriweather would have done, and i marched in. atticus and aunt
alexandra were delighted.
i repeated my part for calpurnia in the kitchen and she said i was wonderful. i
wanted to go across the street to show miss maudie, but jem said sheâ€™d probably
be at the pageant anyway.
after that, it didnâ€™t matter whether they went or not. jem said he would take me.
thus began our longest journey together.
