Byron Hadley - 
                A prison guard. A tall man with thinning red hair, Hadley speaks loudly and uses the threat of violence to control the prisoners. Pessimistic, cynical, and paranoid, he feels the world is out to get him, even when he inherits $35,000 from a long-lost brother. Andy's offer to help Hadley avoid paying taxes on the money marks the beginning of Andy's career as the prison's financial wizard. Hadley eventually has a heart attack and retires.
