business in the united states. when strether fails in his ambassadorial
mission, she sends new ambassadors: her daughter, sarah; her daughter's husband,
jim; and jim's sister, mamie. mrs.[CHARACTER] represents the world
of woollett, massachusetts, and the life that strether has left
behind. strether thinks constantly about mrs.[CHARACTER], and she occupies
a large place in his conscience, since she asked strether to carry
out her wishes in europe and strether has failed to do so for complicated
reasons. through strether's eyes, mrs.[CHARACTER] is beautiful but
deliberately so, wise but incredibly stubborn, and kind but undeniably dominant
in relation to him. the interplay between mrs.[CHARACTER]'s wishes
and strether's evolving needs often drives the novel.
