  this tender child! these omens are your own,
  and you can yet restore the ruin'd town.

  "he said. the crackling flames appear on high.
  and driving sparkles dance along the sky.
  with vulcan's rage the rising winds conspire,
  and near our palace roll the flood of fire.
  'haste, my dear father, ('t is no time to wait,)
  and load my shoulders with a willing freight.
  whate'er befalls, your life shall be my care;
  one death, or one deliv'rance, we will share.
  my hand shall lead our little son; and you,
  my faithful consort, shall our steps pursue.

  approaching fights, and fields to float in blood.

  on the cool river's banks, retir'd alone.

  "behold," she said, "perform'd in ev'ry part,

  and there the rhine submits her swelling tides,

  the danes' unconquer'd offspring march behind,
  and morini, the last of humankind.

  these figures, on the shield divinely wrought,

  unknown the names, he yet admires the grace,

  one would have thought they paid enough before,
  to curse the costly sex, and durst offend no more.
  can they securely trust their feeble wall,
  a slight partition, a thin interval,
  betwixt their fate and them; when troy, tho' built
  by hands divine, yet perish'd by their guilt?
  lend me, for once, my friends, your valiant hands,
  to force from out their lines these dastard bands.
  less than a thousand ships will end this war,
  nor vulcan needs his fated arms prepare.
  let all the tuscans, all th' arcadians, join!
  nor these, nor those, shall frustrate my design.
  let them not fear the treasons of the night,
  the robb'd palladium, the pretended flight:
  our onset shall be made in open light.
  no wooden engine shall their town betray;
  fires they shall have around, but fires by day.

  and gave us life immortal in the seas.
  but young ascanius, in his camp distress'd,
  by your insulting foes is hardly press'd.
  th' arcadian horsemen, and etrurian host,
  advance in order on the latian coast:
  to cut their way the daunian chief designs,
  before their troops can reach the trojan lines.
  thou, when the rosy morn restores the light,
  first arm thy soldiers for th' ensuing fight:
  thyself the fated sword of vulcan wield,
  and bear aloft th' impenetrable shield.
  to-morrow's sun, unless my skill be vain,
  shall see huge heaps of foes in battle slain."

  for well she knew the way. impell'd behind,

  from teuthras and from tyres while he fled,
  the lance, athwart his body, laid him dead:
  roll'd from his chariot with a mortal wound,
  and intercepted fate, he spurn'd the ground.
  as when, in summer, welcome winds arise,
  the watchful shepherd to the forest flies,
  and fires the midmost plants; contagion spreads,
  and catching flames infect the neighb'ring heads;
  around the forest flies the furious blast,
  and all the leafy nation sinks at last,
  and vulcan rides in triumph o'er the waste;
  the pastor, pleas'd with his dire victory,
  beholds the satiate flames in sheets ascend the sky:
  so pallas' troops their scatter'd strength unite,
  and, pouring on their foes, their prince delight.

  halesus came, fierce with desire of blood;
  but first collected in his arms he stood:
  advancing then, he plied the spear so well,
  ladon, demodocus, and pheres fell.
  around his head he toss'd his glitt'ring brand,
  and from strymonius hew'd his better

  him the fierce trojan follow'd thro' the field:
  the holy coward fell; and, forc'd to yield,
  the prince stood o'er the priest, and, at one blow,
  sent him an off'ring to the shades below.
  his arms seresthus on his shoulders bears,
  design'd a trophy to the god of wars.

  vulcanian caeculus renews the fight,
  and umbro, born upon the mountains' height.
  the champion cheers his troops t' encounter those,
  and seeks revenge himself on other foes.
  at anxur's shield he drove; and, at the blow,
  both shield and arm to ground together go.
  anxur had boasted much of magic charms,
  and thought he wore impenetrable arms,

  had life secur'd, in vain, for length of years.

  the pious youth, resolv'd on death, below
  the lifted sword springs forth to face the foe;
  protects his parent, and prevents the blow.
  shouts of applause ran ringing thro' the field,
  to see the son the vanquish'd father shield.
  all, fir'd with gen'rous indignation, strive,
  and with a storm of darts to distance drive
  the trojan chief, who, held at bay from far,
  on his vulcanian orb sustain'd the war.

  as, when thick hail comes rattling in the wind,

  or hous'd, or safe in hollow caverns lie;
  but, that o'erblown, when heav'n above 'em smiles,

  fame says that turnus, when his steeds he join'd,
  hurrying to war, disorder'd in his mind,
  snatch'd the first weapon which his haste could find.
  't was not the fated sword his father bore,
  but that his charioteer metiscus wore.
  this, while the trojans fled, the toughness held;
  but, vain against the great vulcanian shield,
  the mortal-temper'd steel deceiv'd his hand:
  the shiver'd fragments shone amid the sand.

  surpris'd with fear, he fled along the field,
  and now forthright, and now in orbits wheel'd;
  for here the trojan troops the list surround,
  and there the pass is clos'd with pools and marshy ground.

  and oft his trembling knees their aid refuse-
