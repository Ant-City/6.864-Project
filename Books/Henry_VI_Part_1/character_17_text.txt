    four of their lords i'll change for one of ours.
    farewell, my masters; to my task will i;
    bonfires in france forthwith i am to make
    to keep our great saint george's feast withal.
    ten thousand soldiers with me i will take,
    whose bloody deeds shall make an europe quake.
  third messenger. so you had need; for orleans is besieg'd;
    the english army is grown weak and faint;
    the earl of salisbury craveth supply
    and hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
    since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
  exeter. remember, lords, your oaths to henry sworn,
    either to quell the dauphin utterly,
    or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
  bedford. i do remember it, and here take my leave
    to go about my preparation.                             exit

    at pleasure here we lie near orleans;
    otherwhiles the famish'd english, like pale ghosts,
    faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
  alencon. they want their porridge and their fat bull
    beeves.
    either they must be dieted like mules
    and have their provender tied to their mouths,
    or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
  reignier. let's raise the siege. why live we idly here?
    talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear;
    remaineth none but mad-brain'd salisbury,
    and he may well in fretting spend his gall
    nor men nor money hath he to make war.
  charles. sound, sound alarum; we will rush on them.
    now for the honour of the forlorn french!
    him i forgive my death that killeth me,
    when he sees me go back one foot or flee.             exeunt

  reignier. salisbury is a desperate homicide;
    he fighteth as one weary of his life.
    the other lords, like lions wanting food,
    do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
  alencon. froissart, a countryman of ours, records
    england all olivers and rowlands bred
    during the time edward the third did reign.
    more truly now may this be verified;
    for none but samsons and goliases

  talbot. the earl of bedford had a prisoner
    call'd the brave lord ponton de santrailles;
    for him was i exchang'd and ransomed.

    which i disdaining scorn'd, and craved death
    rather than i would be so vile esteem'd.
    in fine, redeem'd i was as i desir'd.
    but, o! the treacherous fastolfe wounds my heart
    whom with my bare fists i would execute,
    if i now had him brought into my power.
  salisbury. yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
  talbot. with scoffs, and scorns, and contumelious taunts,
    in open market-place produc'd they me
    to be a public spectacle to all;
    here, said they, is the terror of the french,
    the scarecrow that affrights our children so.
    then broke i from the officers that led me,
    and with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground

    in iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
    so great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread
    that they suppos'd i could rend bars of steel
    and spurn in pieces posts of adamant;
    wherefore a guard of chosen shot i had
    that walk'd about me every minute-while;
    and if i did but stir out of my bed,
    ready they were to shoot me to the heart.

  salisbury. i grieve to hear what torments you endur'd;
    but we will be reveng'd sufficiently.
    now it is supper-time in orleans:
    here, through this grate, i count each one
    and view the frenchmen how they fortify.
    let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
    sir thomas gargrave and sir william glansdale,
    let me have your express opinions
    where is best place to make our batt'ry next.

    how far'st thou, mirror of all martial men?
    one of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
    accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
    that hath contriv'd this woeful tragedy!

    henry the fifth he first train'd to the wars;

    sir thomas gargrave, hast thou any life?
    speak unto talbot; nay, look up to him.
    salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort,
    thou shalt not die whiles
    he beckons with his hand and smiles on me,
    as who should say 'when i am dead and gone,

    it irks his heart he cannot be reveng'd.

    your hearts i'll stamp out with my horse's heels
    and make a quagmire of your mingled brains.

    i must go victual orleans forthwith.

    o'ertake me if thou canst; i scorn thy strength.
