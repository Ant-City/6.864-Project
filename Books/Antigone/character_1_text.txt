the same as in oedipus the king, an open space before the royal palace, once that of oedipus, at thebes. the backscene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest is the principal entrance into the house. the time is at daybreak on the morning afte

no word of friends, antigone, gladsome or painful, hath come to me, since we two sisters were bereft of brothers twain, killed in one day by twofold blow; and since in this last night the argive host hath fled, know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or more grievous.

antigone
i knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee beyond the gates of the court, that thou mightest hear alone.

ismene
what is it? 'tis plain that thou art brooding on some dark tidings.

antigone
what, hath not creon destined our brothers, the one to honoured burial, the other to unburied shame? eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his honour among the dead below. but the hapless corpse of polyneices-as rumour saith, it hath been published to the town that none shall entomb him or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for the birds, as they espy him, to feast on at will. 

such, 'tis said, is the edict that the good creon hath set forth

antigone
consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.

ismene
in what venture? what can be thy meaning?

antigone
wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead?

ismene
thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to thebes?

antigone
i will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a brother. false to him will i never be found.

ismene
ah, over-bold! when creon hath forbidden?

antigone
nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own.

ismene
ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, amid hate and scorn, when sins bared by his own search had moved him to strike both eyes with self-blinding hand; then the mother wife, two names in one, with twisted noose did despite unto her life; and last, our two brothers in one day,-each shedding, hapless one, a kinsman's blood,-wrought out with mutual hands their common doom. and now we in turn-we two left all

but since victory of glorious name hath come to us, with joy responsive to the joy of thebe whose chariots are many, let us enjoy forgetfulness after the late wars, and visit all the temples of the gods with night-long dance and song; and may bacchus be our leader, whose dancing shakes the land of thebe.

but lo, the king of the land comes yonder, creon, son of menoeceus, our new ruler by the new fortunes that the gods have given; what counsel is he pondering, that he hath proposed this special conference of elders, summoned by his general mandate?
enter creon, from the central doors of the palace, in the garb of king, with two attendants.

such the spirit of my dealing; and never, by deed of mine, shall the wicked stand in honour before the just; but whoso hath good will to thebes, he shall be honoured of me, in his life and in his death.

leader of the chorus
such is thy pleasure, creon, son of menoeceus, touching this city's foe, and its friend; and thou hast power, i ween, to take what order thou wilt, both for the dead, and for all us who live.

creon

creon
in sooth, that is the meed; yet lucre hath oft ruined men through their hopes.
a guard enters from the spectators' left.

guard
my liege, i will not say that i come breathless from speed, or that have plied a nimble foot; for often did my thoughts make me pause, and wheel round in my path, to return. my mind was holding large discourse with me; 'fool, why goest thou to thy certain doom?' 'wretch, tarrying again? and if creon hears this from another, must not thou smart for it?' so debating, i went on my way with lagging steps, and thus a short road was made long. at last, however, it carried the day that i should come hither-to thee; and, though my tale be nought, yet will i tell it; for i come with a good grip on one hope,-that i can suffer nothing but what is my fate.

creon
and what is it that disquiets thee thus?

guard
i wish to tell thee first about myself-i did not do the deed-i did not see the doer-it were

not right that i should come to any harm.

creon
thou hast a shrewd eye for thy mark; well dost thou fence thyself round against the blame; clearly thou hast some strange thing to tell.

guard
aye, truly; dread news makes one pause long.

creon
then tell it, wilt thou, and so get thee gone?

guard
well, this is it.-the corpse-some one hath just given it burial, and gone away,-after sprinkling thirsty dust on the flesh, with such other rites as piety enjoins.

creon
what sayest thou? what living man hath dared this deed?

guard
i know not; no stroke of pickaxe was seen there, no earth thrown up by mattock; the ground was hard and dry, unbroken, without track of wheels; the doer was one who had left no trace. and when the first day-watchman showed it to us, sore wonder fell on all. the dead man was veiled from us; not shut within a tomb, but lightly strewn with dust, as by the hand of one who shunned a curse. and no sign met the eye as though any beast of p

 one spake, who made us all bend our faces on the earth in fear; for we saw not how we could gainsay him, or escape mischance if we obeyed. his counsel was that this deed must be reported to thee, and not hidden. and this seemed best; and the lot doomed my hapless self to win this prize. so here i stand,-as unwelcome as unwilling, well i wot; for no man delights in the bearer of bad news.

leader
o king, my thoughts have long been whispering, can this deed, perchance, be e'en the work of gods?

creon
cease, ere thy words fill me utterly with wrath, lest thou be found at once an old man and foolish. for thou sayest what is not to be borne, in saying that the gods have care for this corpse. was it for high reward of trusty service that they sought to hide his nakedness, who came to burn their pillared shrines and sacred treasures, to burn their land, and scatter its laws to the winds? or dost thou behold the gods honouring the wicked? it cannot be. no! from the first there were certain in the

what portent from the gods is this?-my soul is amazed. i know her-how can i deny that yon maiden is antigone? 

o hapless, and child of hapless sire,-of oedipus! what means this? thou brought a prisoner?-thou, disloyal to the king's laws, and taken in folly?

here she is, the doer of the deed:-caught this girl burying him:-but where is creon?

o king, against nothing should men pledge their word; for the after-thought belies the first intent. i could have vowed that i should not soon be here again,-scared by thy threats, with which i had just been lashed: but,-since the joy that surprises and transcends our hopes is like in fulness to no other pleasure,-i have

creon
and thy prisoner here-how and whence hast thou taken her?

guard
she was burying the man; thou knowest all.

creon
dost thou mean what thou sayest? dost thou speak aright?

guard
i saw her burying the corpse that thou hadst forbidden to bury. is that plain and clear?

creon
and how was she seen? how taken in the act?

guard
it befell on this wise. when we had come to the place,-with those dread menaces of thine upon us,-we swept away all the dust that covered the corpse, and bared the dank body well; and then sat us down on the brow of the hill, to windward, heedful that the smell from him should not strike

nds; and from a shapely ewer of bronze, held high, with thrice-poured drink-offering she crowned the dead. 

we rushed forward when we saw it, and at once dosed upon our quarry, who was in no wise dismayed. then we taxed her with her past and present doings; and she stood not on denial of aught,-at once to my joy and to my pain. to have escaped from ills one's self is a great joy; but 'tis painful to bring friends to ill. howbeit, all such things are of less account to me than mine own safety.

creon
thou-thou whose face is bent to earth-dost thou avow, or disavow, this deed?

i avow it; i make no denial.

yes; for it was not zeus that had published me that

so for me to meet this doom is trifling grief; but if i had suffered my mother's son to lie in death an unburied corpse, that would have grieved me; for this, i am not grieved. and if my present deeds are foolish in thy sight, it may be that a foolish judge arraigns my folly.

leader of the chorus
the maid shows herself passionate child of passionate sire, and knows not how to bend before troubles.

creon
yet i would have thee know that o'er-stubborn spirits are most often humbled; 'tis the stiffest iron, baked to hardness in the fire, that thou shalt oftenest see snapped and shivered; and i have known horses that show temper brought to order by a little curb; there is no room for pride when thou art thy neighbour's slave.-this girl was already versed in insolence when she transgressed the laws that had been set forth; and, that done, lo, a second insult,-to vaunt of this, and exult in her deed.

r kinsfolk shall not avoid a doom most dire; for indeed i charge that other with a like share in the plotting of this burial. 

and summon her-for i saw her e'en now within,-raving, and not mistress of her wits. so oft, before the deed, the mind stands self-convicted in its treason, when folks are plotting mischief in the dark. but verily this, too, is hateful,-when one who hath been caught in wickednes then seeks to make the crime a glory.

antigone
wouldst thou do more than take and slay me?

creon
no more, indeed; having that, i have all.

antigone
why then dost thou delay? in thy discourse there is nought that pleases me,-never may there be!-and so my words must needs be unpleasing to thee. and yet, for glory-whence could i have won a nobler, than by giving burial to mine own brother? all here would own that they thought it well, were not their lips sealed by fear. but royalty, blest in so much besides, hath the power to do and say what it will.

creon

antigone
these also share it; but they curb their tongues for thee.

creon
and art thou not ashamed to act apart from them?

antigone
no; there is nothing shameful in piety to a brother.

creon
was it not a brother, too, that died in the opposite cause?

antigone
brother by the same mother and the same sire.

creon
why, then, dost thou render a grace that is impious in his sight?

antigone
the dead man will not say that he so deems it.

yea, if thou makest him but equal in honour with the wicked.

and thou, who, lurking like a viper in my house, wast secretly draining my life-blood, while i knew not that i was nurturing two pests, to rise against my throne-come, tell me now, wilt thou also confess thy part in this burial, or wilt thou forswear all knowledge of it?

ismene
i have done the deed,-if she allows my claim,-and share the burden of the charge.

nay, justice will not suffer thee to do that: thou didst not consent to the deed, nor did i give thee part in it.

blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. for when a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is driven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of thracian sea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and there is sullen roar from wind-vexed headlands that front the blows of the storm.

old man, ye all shoot your shafts at me, as archers at the butts;-ye must needs practise on me with seer-craft also;-aye, the seer-tribe hath long trafficked in me, and made me their merchandise. gain your gains, drive your trade, if ye list, in the silver-gold of sardis and the gold of india; but ye shall not hide that man in the grave,-no, though the eagles of zeus should bear the carrion morsels to their master's throne-no, not for dread of that defilement will i suffer his burial:-for well

creon

teiresias
how precious, above all wealth, is good counsel.

creon
as folly, i think, is the worst mischief.

teiresias
yet thou art tainted with that distemper.

creon
i would not answer the seer with a taunt.

teiresias

creon
well, the prophet-tribe was ever fond of money.

teiresias
and the race bred of tyrants loves base gain.

i know it; for through me thou hast saved thebes.

teiresias
then know thou-aye, know it well-that thou shalt not live through many more courses of the sun's swift chariot, ere one begotten of thine own loins shall have been given by thee, a corpse for corpses; because thou hast thrust children of the sunlight to the shades, and ruthlessly lodged a living soul in the grave; but keepest in this world one who belongs to the gods infernal, a corpse unburied, unhonoured, all unhallowed. in such thou ha

the boy leads teiresias out.

leader of the chorus
the man hath gone, o king, with dread prophecies. and, since the hair on this head, once dark, hath been white, i know that he hath never been a false prophet to our city.

creon
i, too, know it well, and am troubled in soul. 'tis dire to yield; but, by resistance, to smite my pride with ruin-this, too, is a dire choice.

leader
son of menoeceus, it behoves thee to take wise counsel.

creon
what should i do then? speak and i will obey.

leader
go thou, and free the maiden from her rocky chamber, and make a tomb for the unburied dead.

creon
and this is thy counsel? thou wouldst have me yield?

creon
even as i am i'll go:-on, on, my servants, each and all of you,-take axes in your hands, and hasten to the ground that ye see yonder! since our judgment hath taken this turn, i will be present to unloose her, as myself bound her. my heart misgives me, 'tis best to keep the established laws, even to life's end.

dwellers by the house of cadmus and of amphion, there is no estate of mortal life that i would ever praise or blame as settled. fortune raises and fortune humbles the lucky or unlucky from day to day, and no one can prophesy to men concerning those things which are established. for 

creon was blest once, as i count bliss; he had saved this land of cadmus from its foes; he was clothed with sole dominion in the land; he reigned, the glorious sire of princely children. and now all hath been lost. for when a man hath forfeited his pleasures, i count him not as living,-i hold him but a breathing corpse. heap up riches in thy house, if thou wilt; live in kingly state; yet, if there be no gladness therewith, i would not give the shadow of a vapour for all the rest, compared with joy.

haemon hath perished; his blood hath been shed by no stranger.

by his own, in wrath with his sire for the murder.

o prophet, how true, then, hast thou proved thy word!

these things stand thus; ye must consider of the rest.

lo, i see the hapless eurydice, creon's wife, approaching; she comes from the house by chance, haply,-or because she knows the tidings of her son.

eurydice
people of thebes, i heard your words as i was going forth, to salute the goddess pallas with my prayers. even as i was loosing the fastenings of the gate, to open it, the message of a household woe smote on mine ear: i sank back, terror-stricken, into the arms of my handmaids, and my senses fled. but say again what the tidings were; i shall hear

ay unpitied. we prayed the goddess of the roads, and pluto, in mercy to restrain their wrath; we washed the dead with holy washing; and with freshly-plucked boughs we solemnly burned such relics as there were. we raised a high mound of his native earth; and then we turned away to enter the maiden's nuptial chamber with rocky couch, the caverned mansion of the bride of death. and, from afar off, one of us heard a voice of loud wailing at that bride's unhallowed bower; and came to tell our master creon. 

and as the king drew nearer, doubtful sounds of a bitter cry floated around him; he groaned, and said in accents of anguish, 'wretched that i am, can my foreboding be true? am i going on the wofullest way that ever i went? my son's voice greets me.-go, my servants,-haste ye nearer, and when ye have reached the tomb, pass through the gap, where the stones have been wrenched away, to the cell's very mouth,-and look. and see if 'tis haemon's voice that i know, or if mine ear is cheated by the g

i know not; but to me, at least, a strained silence seems to portend peril, no less than vain abundance of lament.

messenger
well, i will enter the house, and learn whether indeed she is not hiding some repressed purpose in the depths of a passionate heart. yea, thou sayest well: excess of silence, too, may have a perilous meaning.
the messenger goes into the palace. enter creon, on the spectators' left, with attendants, carrying the shrouded body of haemon on bier. the following lines between creon and the chorus are chanted responsively.

chorus
lo, yonder the king himself draws near, bearing that which tells too clear a tale,-the work of no stranger's madness,-if we may say it,-but of his own misdeeds.
