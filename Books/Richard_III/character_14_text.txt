    hath mov'd his highness to commit me now.
  gloucester. why, this it is when men are rul'd by women:
    'tis not the king that sends you to the tower;
    my lady grey his wife, clarence, 'tis she
    that tempers him to this extremity.
    was it not she and that good man of worship,
    antony woodville, her brother there,
    that made him send lord hastings to the tower,
    from whence this present day he is delivered?
    we are not safe, clarence; we are not safe.
  clarence. by heaven, i think there is no man is secure
    but the queen's kindred, and night-walking heralds
    that trudge betwixt the king and mistress shore.
    heard you not what an humble suppliant
    lord hastings was, for her delivery?
  gloucester. humbly complaining to her deity
    got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
    i'll tell you what-i think it is our

  hastings. no news so bad abroad as this at home:
    the king is sickly, weak, and melancholy,
    and his physicians fear him mightily.
  gloucester. now, by saint john, that news is bad indeed.

  hastings. how, wear the garland! dost thou mean the
    crown?
  catesby. ay, my good lord.

    shoulders

  catesby. ay, on my life; and hopes to find you forward
    upon his party for the gain thereof;
    and thereupon he sends you this good news,
    that this same very day your enemies,
    the kindred of the queen, must die at pomfret.
  hastings. indeed, i am no mourner for that news,
    because they have been still my adversaries;
    but that i'll give my voice on richard's side
    to bar my master's heirs in true descent,
    god knows i will not do it to the death.
  catesby. god keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
  hastings. but i shall laugh at this a twelve month hence,
    that they which brought me in my master's hate,
    i live to look upon their tragedy.
    well, catesby, ere a fortnight make me older,

    when men are unprepar'd and look not for it.
  hastings. o monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
    with rivers, vaughan, grey; and so 'twill do
    with some men else that think themselves as safe
    as thou and i, who, as thou knowest, are dear
    to princely richard and to buckingham.

    i would be so triumphant as i am?
  stanley. the lords at pomfret, when they rode from

    were jocund and suppos'd their states were sure,

    but yet you see how soon the day o'ercast.
