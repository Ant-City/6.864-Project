[CHARACTER] - 
                plato
divides his just society into three classes: the [CHARACTER], the
auxiliaries, and the guardians. the producing class is the largest
class of society; it is a catch-all group that includes all professions
other than warrior and ruler. framers and craftsmen are [CHARACTER],
as are merchants, doctors, artists, actors, lawyers, judges, and
so forth. in a just society, the [CHARACTER] have no share in ruling,
but merely obey what the rulers decree. they focus exclusively on producing
whatever it is that they are best suited to produce (whether that
be metal work, agriculture, shoes, or furniture).
