rocky--(considerately) sure, dat's all i meant, a tart.

pearl--(giggling) but he's right about de damned cows, margie. jees, i bet cora don't know which end of de cow has de horns! i'm goin' to ask her. (there is the noise of a door opening in the hall and the sound of a man's and woman's arguing voices.)

rocky--here's your chance. dat's dem two nuts now. (cora and chuck look in from the hallway and then come in. cora is a thin peroxide blonde, a few years older than pearl and margie, dressed in similar style, her round face showing more of the wear and tear of her trade than theirs, but still with traces of a doll-like prettiness. chuck is a tough, thick-necked, barrel-chested italian-american, with a fat, amiable, swarthy face. he has on a straw hat with a vivid band, a loud suit, tie and shirt, and yellow shoes. his eyes are clear and he looks healthy and strong as an ox.)

cora--(gaily) hello, bums. (she looks around.) jees, de morgue on a rainy sunday night! (she waves

rocky--(exasperatedly) aw, bury it! what are you, a voigin? (pearl stares at him, her face growing hard and bitter. so does margie.)

pearl--yuh mean you tink i'm a whore, too, huh?

d larry's shoulder and gives him an affectionate hug.) i've always liked you a lot, you old bastard! (he gets up and his manner changes to his bustling party excitement--glancing at his watch) well, well, not much time before twelve. let's get busy, boys and girls. (he looks over the table where the cake is.) cake all set. good. and my presents, and yours, girls, and chuck's, and rocky's. fine. harry'll certainly be touched by your thought of him. (he goes back to the girls.) you go in the bar, pearl and margie, and get the grub ready so it can be brought right in. there'll be some drinking and toasts first, of course. my idea is to use the wine for that, so get it all set. i'll go upstairs now and root everyone out. harry the last. i'll come back with him. somebody light the candles on the cake when you hear us coming, and you start playing harry's favorite tune, cora. hustle now, everybody. we want this to come off in style.

ee drink of whiskey left!

larry--(stung--furiously) look out how you try to taunt me back into life, i warn you! i might remember the thing they call justice there, and the punishment for--(he checks himself with an effort--then with a real indifference that comes from exhaustion) i'm old and tired. to hell with you! you're as mad as hickey, and as big a liar. i'd never let myself believe a word you told me.

parritt--(threateningly) the hell you won't! wait till hickey gets through with you! (pearl and margie come in from the bar. at the sight of them, parritt instantly subsides and becomes self-conscious and defensive, scowling at them and then quickly looking away.)

margie--(eyes him jeeringly) why, hello, tightwad kid. come to join de party? gee, don't he act bashful, poil?

pearl--yeah. especially wid his dough. (parritt slinks to a chair at the left end of the table, pretending he hasn't heard them. suddenly there is a noise of angry, cursing voices and a scuffle from the hall. pearl yells) he
