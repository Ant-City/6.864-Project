[CHARACTER] 

the unseen, unknown inspiration for all of don quixote's
exploits, dulcinea, we are told, is a simple peasant woman who has
no knowledge of the valorous deeds that don quixote commits in her name.
we never meet dulcinea in the novel, and on the two occasions when
it seems she might appear, some trickery keeps her away from the
action. in the first case, the priest intercepts sancho, who is on
his way to deliver a letter to dulcinea from don quixote. in the second
instance, sancho says that dulcinea has been enchanted and that
he thus cannot locate her.
despite her absence from the novel, dulcinea is an important force
because she epitomizes don quixote's chivalric conception of the
perfect woman. in his mind, she is beautiful and virtuous, and she
makes up for her lack of background and lineage with her good deeds.
don quixote describes her chiefly in poetic terms that do little
to specify her qualities. she is, therefore, important not for who she
is but for what her character represents and for what she indicates
about don quixote's character.
