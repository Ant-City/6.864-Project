and what is mine, my loue shall render him.
and she is mine, and all my right of her,
i do estate vnto demetrius

   lys. i am my lord, as well deriu'd as he,
as well possest: my loue is more then his:
my fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd
(if not with vantage) as demetrius:
and (which is more then all these boasts can be)
i am belou'd of beauteous hermia.
why should not i then prosecute my right?
demetrius, ile auouch it to his head,
made loue to nedars daughter, helena,
and won her soule: and she (sweet ladie) dotes,
deuoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
vpon this spotted and inconstant man

   the. i must confesse, that i haue heard so much,
and with demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof:
but being ouer-full of selfe-affaires,
my minde did lose it. but demetrius come,
and come egeus, you shall go with me,
i haue some priuate schooling for you both.
for you faire hermia, looke you arme your selfe,
to fit your fancies to your fathers will;
