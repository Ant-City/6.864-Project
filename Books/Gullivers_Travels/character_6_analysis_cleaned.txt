[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is a minor character, but he plays the important
role of showing the possibility of individual dissent within a brainwashed community.
while the inhabitants of lagado pursue their attempts to extract
sunbeams from cucumbers and to eliminate all verbs and adjectives
from their language, munodi is a rare example of practical intelligence.
having tried unsuccessfully to convince his fellows of their misguided
public policies, he has given up and is content to practice what
he preaches on his own estates. in his kindness to strangers, munodi
is also a counterexample to the contemptuous treatment that the
other laputians and lagadans show gulliver. he takes his guest on
a tour of the kingdom, explains the advantages of his own estates
without boasting, and is, in general, a figure of great common sense
and humanity amid theoretical delusions and impractical fantasizing.
as a figure isolated from his community, munodi is similar to gulliver,
though gulliver is unaware of his alienation while munodi suffers
acutely from his. indeed, in munodi we glimpse what gulliver could
be if he were wiser: a figure able to think critically about life
and society.
