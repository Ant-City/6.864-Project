 that business considerably, i can tell
you. after all, for a seaman, to scrape the bottom of the thing that’s
supposed to float all the time under his care is the unpardonable sin.
no one may know of it, but you never forget the thump--eh? a blow on the
very heart. you remember it, you dream of it, you wake up at night and
think of it--years after--and go hot and cold all over. i don’t pretend
to say that steamboat floated all the time. more than once she had to
wade for a bit, with twenty cannibals splashing around and pushing.
we had enlisted some of these chaps on the way for a crew. fine
fellows--cannibals--in their place. they were men one could work with,
and i am grateful to them. and, after all, they did not eat each other
before my face: they had brought along a provision of hippo-meat
which went rotten, and made the mystery of the wilderness stink in my
nostrils. phoo! i can sniff it now. i had the manager on board and three
or four pilgrims with their staves--all complete. somet
