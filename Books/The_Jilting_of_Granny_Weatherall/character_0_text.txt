 

the jilting of granny weatherall (1930) 
by katherine anne porter 

she flicked her wrist neatly out of doctor harry’s pudgy careful fingers and pulled 
the sheet up to her chin. the brat ought to be in knee breeches. doctoring around the 
country with spectacles on his nose! “get along now, take your schoolbooks and go. 
there’s nothing wrong with me.” 

doctor harry spread a warm paw like a cushion on her forehead where the forked 

green vein danced and made her eyelids twitch. “now, now, be a good girl, and we’

and sorry.” 

“don’t tell me what i’m going to be. i’m on my feet now, morally speaking. it’s 

cornelia. i had to go to bed to get rid of her.” 

her bones felt loose, and floated around in her skin, and doctor harry floated like 

a balloon around the foot of the bed. 

he floated and pulled down his waistcoat and swung his glasses on a cord. “well, 

stay where you are, it certainly can’t hurt you.” 

“get along and doctor your sick,” said granny weatherall. “leave a well woman 

alone. i’ll call for you when i want you… where were you forty years ago when i pulled 
through milk-leg2 and double pneumonia? you weren’t even born. don’t let cornelia 
lead you on,” she shouted, because doctor harry appeared to float up to the ceiling 
and out. “i pay my own bills, and i don’t throw my money away on nonsense!” 

she meant to wave good-by, but it was too much trouble. her eyes closed of 
themselves, it was like a dark curtain drawn aro

und the bed. the pillow rose and 
floated under her, pleasant as a hammock in a light wind. she listened to the leaves 
rustling outside the window. no, somebody was swishing newspapers: no, cornelia 
and doctor harry werewhisperingtogether. she leaped broad awake, thinking they 
whispered in her ear. 

“she was never like this, never like this!” “well, what can we expect?” “yes, 

eighty years old….”

well, and what if she was? she still had ears. it was like cornelia to whisper 
around doors. she always kept things secret in such a public way. she was always 
being tactful and kind. cornelia was dutiful; that was the trouble with her. dutiful and 
good: “so good and dutiful,” said granny, “that i’d like to spank her.” she saw herself 
spanking cornelia and making a fine job of it. 

“what’d you say, mother?” 

granny felt her face tying up in hard knots. 

“can’t

ng farewell trips to see her children and 
grandchildren! then she made her will and came down with a long fever. that was all 
just a notion like a lot of other things, but it was lucky too, for she had once for all got 
over the idea of dying for a long time. now she couldn’t be worried. she hoped she 
had better sense now. her father had lived to be one hundred and two years old and 
had drunk a noggin3 of strong hot toddy on his last birthday. he told the reporters it

was his daily habit, and he owed his long life to that. he had made quite a scandal and 
was very pleased about it. she believed she’d just plague cornelia a little. 

“cornelia! cornelia!” no footsteps, but a sudden hand on her cheek. “bless you, 

where have you been?” 

“here, mother.” 

“well, cornelia, i want a noggin of hot toddy.” 

“are you cold, darling?” 

“i’m chilly, cornelia. lying in bed stops the circulation. i must have told you that a

r if she saw him now. it seemed strange and there was something 
wrong in the idea. why, he couldn’t possibly recognize her. she had fenced in a 
hundred acres once, digging the post holes herself and clamping the wires with just a 
negro boy to help. that changed a woman. john would be looking for a young woman 
with the peaked spanish comb in her hair and the painted fan. digging post holes 
changed a woman. riding country roads in the winter when women had their babies

was another thing: sitting up nights with sick horses and sick negroes and sick children 
and hardly ever losing one. john, i hardly ever lost one of them! john would see that in 
a minute, that would be something he could understand, she wouldn’t have to explain 
anything! 

it made her feel like rolling up her sleeves and putting the whole place to rights 
again. no matter if cornelia was determined to be everywhere at once, there were a 
great many things left undone on this place.

rly rows. that was hell, she knew hell when 
she saw it. for sixty years she had prayed against remembering him and against losing 
her soul in the deep pit of hell, and now the two things were mingled in one and the 
thought of him was a smoking cloud from hell that moved and crept in her head when 
she had just got rid of doctor harry and was trying to rest a minute: wounded vanity, 
ellen, said a sharp voice in the top of her mind. don’t let your wounded vanity get the

upper hand of you. plenty of girls get jilted. you were jilted, weren’t you? then stand 
up to it. her eyelids wavered and let in streamers of blue-gray light like tissue paper 
over her eyes. she must get up and pull the shades down or she’d never sleep. she was 
in bed again and the shades were not down. how could that happen? better turn over, 
hide from the light, sleeping in the light gave you nightmares. “mother, how do you 
feel now?” and a stinging wetness on her forehead

and they danced and rattled. “mother, don’t mind, we’re going to give you a little 
hypodermic.” “look here, daughter, how do ants get in this bed? i saw sugar ants 
yesterday.” did you send for hapsy too? 

it was hapsy she really wanted. she had to go a long way back through a great 

many rooms to find hapsy standing with a baby on her arm. she seemed to herself to 
be hapsy also, and the baby on hapsy’s arm was hapsy and himself and herself, all at

once, and there was no surprise in the meeting. then hapsy melted from within and 
turned flimsy as gray gauze and baby was a gauzy shadow, and hapsy came up close 
and said, “i thought you’d never come,” and looked at her very searchingly and said, 
“you haven’t changed a bit!” they leaned forward to kiss, when cornelia began 
whispering from a long way off, “oh, is there anything you want to tell me? is there 
anything i can do for you?” 

yes, she had changed her mind

y felt easy about her soul. cornelia, where are your 
manners? give father connolly a chair. she had her secret, comfortable understanding 
with a few favorite saints who cleared a straight road to god for her. all as surely 
signed and sealed as the papers for the new forty acres. forever… heirs and assigns 
forever. since the day the wedding cake was not cut, but thrown out and wasted. the 
whole bottom dropped out of the world, and there she was blind and sweating with

nothing under her feet and the walls falling away. his hand caught her under the 
breast, she had not fallen, there was the freshly polished floor with the green rug on it, 
just as before. he had cursed like a sailor’s parrot and said, “i’ll kill him for you.” don’t 
lay a hand on him, for my sake leave something to god. “now, ellen, you must believe 
what i tell you…” 

so there was nothing, nothing to worry about any more, except sometimes in the 
night one of the chil

road where the trees leaned over and bowed to each 
other and a thousand birds were singing a mass. she felt like singing too, but she put 
her hand in the bosom of her dress and pulled out a rosary, and father connolly 
murmured latin in a very solemn voice and tickled her feet. my god, will you stop that 
nonsense? i’m a married woman. what if he did run away and leave me to face the 
priest by myself? i found another a whole world better. i wouldn’t have exchanged my

a thank you in the bargain. 

light flashed on her closed eyelids, and a deep roaring shook her. cornelia, is that 

lightning? i hear thunder. there’s going to be a storm. close all the windows. call the 
children in... “mother, where we are, all of us.” “is that you, hapsy?” “oh, no, i’m 
lydia. we drove as fast as we could.” their faces drifted above her, drifted away. the
