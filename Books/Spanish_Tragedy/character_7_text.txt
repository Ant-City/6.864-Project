[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:
    my name was don andrea; my descent,
    though not ignoble, yet inferior far

ness had not been.
    o earth, why didst thou not in time devour
    the vile profaner of this sacred bower?
    o poor horatio, what hadst thou misdone
    to leese thy life ere life was new begun?
    o wicked butcher, whatsoe'er thou wert,
    how could thou strangle virtue and desert?
    ay me, most wretched!  that have lost my joy
    in leesing my horatio, my sweet boy!

                enter isabell.

  isa.  my husband's absence makes my heart to throb.
    hieronimo!

  hiero.  here, isabella.  help me to lament;
    for sighs are stopp'd, and all my tears are spent.

  isa.  what world of grief--my son horatio!
    o where's the author of this endless woe?

  hiero.  to know the author were some ease of grief,
    for in revenge my heart would find relief.

  isa.  then is he gone?  and is my son gone too?
    o, gush out, tears!  fountains and floods of tears!
    blow, sighs, and raise an everlasting storm;
    for outrage fits our cursed wretchedness.

  hiero.  sweet lovely ros

re only my delight.

  hiero.  see'st thou this handkerchief besmear'd with blood?
    it shall not from me till i take revenge;
    see'st thou those wounds that yet are bleeding fresh?
    i'll not entomb them till i have reveng'd:
    then will i joy amidst my discontent,
    till then, my sorrow never shall be spent.

  isa.  the heav'ns are just, murder cannot be hid;
    time is the author of both truth and right,
    and time will bring this treachery to light.

  hiero.  meanwhile, good isabella, cease thy plaints,
    or, at the least, dissemble them awhile;
    so shall we sooner find the practise out,
    and learn by whom all this was brought about.
    come, isabell, now let us take him up.

                they take him up.

    and bear him in from out this cursed place.
    i'll say his dirge,--singing fits not this case.
    o aliquis mihi quas pulchrum ver educat herbas

                hieronimo sets his breast unto his sword.

    misceat, et nostro detur medicina dolori;

 be, i gave it never a wound;
    show me one drop of blood fall from the same!
    how is it possible i should slay it then?
    tush, no!  run after, catch me if you can!

                exeunt all but don bazulto.

                bazulto remains till hieronimo enters
                again, who, staring him in the face, speaks:

    and art thou come, horatio, from the depth,
    to ask for justice in this upper earth?
    to tell thy father thou art unreveng'd?
    to wring more tears from isabella's eyes,
    whose lights are dimm'd with over-long laments?
    go back, my son, complain to eacus;
    for here's no justice.  gentle boy, begone;
    for justice is exiled from the earth.
    hieronimo will bear thee company.
    thy mother cries on righteous radamant
    for just revenge against the murderers.

  bazulto.  alas, my lord, whence springs this troubled speech?

  hiero.  but let me look on my horatio:
    sweet boy, how art thou chang'd in death's black shade!

my lord, we must resolve,
    to soothe his humors up.

  bal.  on then, hieronimo; farewell till soon!

  hiero.  you'll ply this gear?

  lor.  i warrant you.

                exeuent all but hieronimo.

  hiero.  why, so!  now shall i see the fall of babylon
    wrought by the heav'ns in this confusion.
    and, if the world like not this tragedy,
    hard is the hap of old hieronimo.

                exit.




[act iv.  scene 2.]

                [hieronimo's garden.]

                enter isabella with a weapon.

  [isa.]  tell me no more!  o monstrous homicides!
    since neither piety nor pity moves
    the king to justice or compassion,
    i will revenge myself upon this place,
    where thus they murder'd my beloved son.

                she cuts down the arbour.

    down with these branches and these loathsome boughs
    on this unfortunate and fatal pine!
    down with them, isabella; rent them up,
    and burns the roots from whence the rest is sprung!
    i will leave not a roo

for a portingale!

                the trumpets sound a dead march, the king of spain
                mourning after his brother's body, and the king of
                portingal bearing the body of his son.


[chorus.]

                enter ghost and revenge.

  ghost.  aye; now my hopes have end in their effects,
    when blood and sorrow finish my desires:
    horatio murder'd in his father's bower,
    vile serberine by pedrigano slain,
    false pedrigano hang'd by quaint device,
    fair isabella by herself misdone,
    prince balthazar by bel-imperia stabb'd,
    the duke of castile and his wicked son
    both done to death by old hieronimo,
    my bel-imperia fallen as dido fell,
    and good hieronimo slain by himself!
    aye, these were spectacles to please my soul.
    now will i beg at lovely proserpine
    that, by the virtue of her princely doom,
    i may consort my friends in pleasing sort,
    and on my foes work just and sharp revenge.
    i'll lead my friend horatio throug

h those fields
    where never-dying wars are still inur'd;
    i'll lead fair isabella to that train
    where pity weeps but never feeleth pain;
    i'll lead my bel-imperia to those joys
    that vestal virgins and fair queens possess;
    i'll lead hieronimo where orpheus plays,
    adding sweet pleasure to eternal days.
    but say, revenge,--for thou must help or none,--
    against the rest how shall my hate be shown?

  revenge.  this hand shall hale them down to deepest hell,
    where none but furies, bugs and tortures dwell.

  ghost.  then, sweet revenge, do this at my
