 had obtained from a 
vendor. it had gotten very hot, although the sun had been unable to penetrate 
the layer of haze in the sky. lassitude immobilized the mind, while the senses 
were taking pleasure in the immense and deadening spectacle of the silent sea. to 
divine, to explore which name it might be that sounded a bit like "adgio" was 
considered by the earnest man a fitting and absolutely filling task and occupation. 
with the help of some polish remembrances he decided that it had to be "tadzio," 
short for "tadeusz" and "tadziu" in the vocative. tadzio was bathing. aschenbach, 
who had lost him from his sight, found his head, his arm, with which he made 
rowing motions, far away out on the sea; because it was quite shallow for a great 
distance. but immediately there was concern about him, female voices were calling 
out for him from the huts, exclaiming again that word which was like a password 
at the beach and that, with its soft sound and its drawn out "oo" sound at the 
end, had

backwards; and to witness how the lively figure, pretty and harsh in a not-yet- 
manly way, with dripping curls and handsome like a youthful god, ascended from 
the watery depths of sky and sea: that sight induced mythical connotations, he 
was like a poem about ancient times, the birth of form and the genesis of the gods. 
aschenbach intently listened to that song that came from inside; and again he 
thought that it was good to be here and that he wanted to stay.

later tadzio lay, exhausted from his bathing, on the sand, wrapped in white 
linen which was tucked under the right shoulder, resting with his head on his bare 
arm; and even when aschenbach was not looking at him but read a few pages in 
his book, he almost never forgot the recumbent and that he only had to turn his 
head slightly to the right to catch sight of the admirable. it almost seemed to him 
as if he was guarding the resting boy — occupied with his own things and yet with 
unwavering vigilance f

y-cut face. in that moment he thought of his 
fame, and how many people looked up to him for his ability to always find the 
right words and graceful phrases — he called to witness all the successes his gifts 
had given him that he could think of and even considered his knighthood. then he 
went down to the dining room and took a meal at his little table. when he entered 
the elevator afterwards, young people jostled into that tiny hovering cubbyhole, 
who were also coming from breakfast, and tadzio joined them. he stood very 
close to aschenbach, for the first time close enough that aschenbach was afforded 
a more intimate look with all details. someone addressed the lad, and while he 
replied with an unimaginably lovely smile, he already stepped out at the second 
floor, walking backwards, with downcast eyes. beauty makes one shy, thought 
aschenbach and mulled why this would be the case. he had in fact noticed that 
tadzio's teeth were not quite as pleasant; slightly jagged and pale, wi

 only to reappear five minutes 
later. the car could wait no longer. then he should drive away and take his 
luggage with him, aschenbach responded angrily. he himself would, in due time, 
use the public steamer and would take care of his departure himself. the employee 
bowed. aschenbach, relieved to have diverted the unwelcome exhortations, finished 
his meal unhurriedly, and even had the waiter bring him the daily newspaper. 
time had grown quite short when he arose. it just so happened that tadzio crossed 
the threshold that very moment. 

walking towards the table of his family, he crossed paths with aschenbach, cast 
down his glance before the gray-haired man, only to look at him softly in his lovely 
way and passed. "adieu, tadzio!" thought aschenbach. "it was all too brief." and 
as he, contrary to his usual habit, formed the words with his lips, he added: "god 
bless you!" — next he organized his departure, gave tips, was bid farewell by the 
little soft-spoken manager in the fren

his hand luggage in the room and sat down in an armchair next to the 
open window. the ocean had taken on a pale green color, the air seemed thinner 
and more pure, the beach with its boats and huts more colorful, even though the 
sky was still gray. aschenbach looked outside, his hands folded in his lap, content 
to be back, shaking his head about his fickleness, his lack of knowledge about his 
own desires. so he sat maybe for an hour, resting and lost in mindless reverie. at 
noon he spotted tadzio who, in a striped linen suit with a red bow, returned to 
the hotel via the wooden path. aschenbach immediately recognized him, before 
he had even really looked at him, and wanted to think of something like: "look, 
tadzio, there you are again!" but in the same moment he felt the casual greeting 
sink and become silent in the face of the truth of his heart — felt the excitement of 
his blood, the joy and pain in his soul and realized that the farewell had been so 
taxing because of tadzio.

ade the lights in the house go extinct, and the ravens, fed by him, landed on 
the branches of firs. then it appeared to him he was in elysium, at the bounds 
of earth where an easy life is granted people, where there is no snow nor winter 
nor storm nor deluge but always the softly-cooling breath of oceanus and the 
days take their course in blissful idleness, without effort, without struggle, and 
completely devoted to the sun and its feasts. 

often, almost constantly, aschenbach saw the boy tadzio; a limited space, a 
different order to everyone's life effected it that the arresting one was close to him 
most of the day, with short interruptions. he saw and met him everywhere: in 
the ground-floor rooms of the hotel, on the refreshing boat trips to the city and 
back, in the marvel of the square, and frequently in between on streets and paths 
if luck contributed. but mainly and with gratifying regularity the mornings at the 
beach gave him ample opportunity to study the beautiful figure

ork, and was at the 
beach before everyone else, when the sun was still mild and the sea lay blindingly 
white in morning dreams. he jovially greeted the man at the gate, also greeted 
the barefoot old man who had prepared his hut for him, deployed the canvas, and 
moved the furniture out onto the platform, and seated himself. the next three 
or four hours were his, in which the sun ascended and gained fearsome power, in 
which the blue of the ocean deepened, and in which he could lay eyes upon tadzio. 

he saw him arrive from the left, close to the seashore, saw him come out 
backwards from between the huts, and sometimes found to his surprise that he 
had completely missed his entry and that he was already there, in that blue-white 
bathing suit that was his only dress at the beach, and had resumed his usual 
frolicking on the sunny sand — that sweetly inane, idly vagrant life, which was 
play and rest, an ambling, wading, digging, catching, reclining, and swimming, 
guarded by the women

leness and is made for it, but in this stage of his 
condition the mind of the afflicted was set on production, the immediate cause was 
almost irrelevant. a question, an inspiration to make his position known about an 
important problem of culture and good taste had reached the traveler from the 
intellectual sphere. the subject was a familiar experience to him; his desire to see 
it take the glorious shape of words was unexpectedly irresistible. he wanted to

work in the presence of tadzio, to take the proportions of the boy as a template, 
to let his style flow like the curves of his body that seemed divine to him, to carry 
his beauty into the intellectual like the herder ganymede had been lifted to the 
skies by the eagle-like zeus. never had the joy of words seemed sweeter to him, 
never had he been so conscious of eros being in the words as in the dangerous and 
precious hours in which he, in full sight of his idol and under his canvas, worked 
on his little treatise — tho

ved; because knowledge of the artist's sources of 
inspiration might bewilder them, drive them away and in that way nullify the effect 
of the excellent work. strange hours! strangely unnerving exertion! strangely 
fertilizing intercourse between mind and body! when aschenbach put aside his 
work and left the beach, he felt exhausted, shattered even, and it was as if his 
conscience was accusing him as if after a debauchery. 

it was on the following morning that he, just leaving the hotel, saw tadzio 
already on his way to the ocean — alone. the wish to use this opportunity to meet 
and talk to the unknowing source of his emotional turmoil and inspiration, to 
enjoy his gaze and his replies seemed rather obvious. the beautiful one ambled 
leisurely, he could be overtaken and aschenbach sped up his pace. he reaches him 
on the boardwalk behind the huts, he wants to place his hand upon his crown or 
shoulder and address him with a little phrase in french perhaps: there he feels 
that his he

the stimulating salty breeze strengthened him for emotions and whereas he usually 
spent all the refreshment given to him by slumber, food, and nature on his work, 
he now let all that which the sun, idleness, and the marine air afforded him suffuse 
generously in intoxication and emotion. 

his sleep was short; the deliriously uniform days were separated by brief nights 
of happy listlessness. he went to bed early, since the day seemed finished to him 
as soon as tadzio had disappeared at around nine o'clock. but in the beginning 
dawn a tenderly penetrating fright awoke him, his heart remembered his adventure, 
he had to get up and so he did, and lightly clothed against the morning coolness 
he seated himself at the open window to expect the rising sun. that wondrous 
event filled his soul, consecrated by the sleep, with devotion. the sky, the earth 
and the ocean were still lying in glassy paleness; a lone star was still twinkling 
in the nothingness. but a

standing in troops in the sky, like grazing herds of the gods. the current of air 
became stronger and poseidon's horses where galloping along, also bulls belonging 
to the god, lowering their horns with a roar. between the boulders of the more 
distant beach the waves jumped up like goats. a divinely disfigured world full 
of pan's creatures surrounded the elated one, and his heart dreamed of tender 
fables. several times, when the sun set behind venice, he sat on a bench in the 
park to watch tadzio who, dressed in white and girded gaily, was playing ball on 
the flattened gravel court and it was hyacinth he deemed to see who had to die 
because two gods fell in love with him. yes, he felt zephyr's painful jealousy of his 
rival apollo, who neglected the delphi oracle, the bow, and the cithara to play 
instead with his beloved; he saw the horrid discus hit the lovely head, he caught, 
turning pale as him, the limp body and the flower, sprung from that sweet blood,

ly, even hourly and who keep up the impression of disinterest either because of 
morals or because of a mental abnormality. between them there is listlessness and 
pent-up curiosity, the hysteria of an unsatisfied, unnaturally suppressed need for 
communion and also a kind of tense respect. because man loves and honors man 
as long as he is not able to judge him, and desire is a product of lacking knowledge. 

some kind of relationship or acquaintance had to come about between asch- 
enbach and tadzio by necessity, and with penetrating joy the older one realized 
that concern and attention were not left entirely unanswered. what caused the 
beautiful lad, for example, to always enter the beach along aschenbach's hut, across 
the sand and sometimes unnecessarily close to him, almost touching his table and 
chair, instead of taking the boardwalk behind the huts? was this effected by the 
magnetism and fascination of a superior emotion on its tender and thoughtless 
object? daily aschenbach exp

ected tadzio's entry and sometimes he pretended to 
be occupied with something else when it happened and let him pass by apparently 
without taking notice. but at other times their gazes met. they were always deeply 
serious when that took place. nothing in the educated and dignified expression of 
the older one betrayed an inner motion; but in tadzio's eyes there was an inquiry, 
a pensive questioning, he hesitated in his walk, cast down his eyes, looked up again

in a lovely way, and when he had passed, something in his attitude suggested that 
only good manners were keeping him from turning around. 

but one evening it occurred differently. the polish children with their governess 
had been absent during dinner in the large hall — aschenbach had registered it with 
consternation. he took a walk after the meal, anxious about th

eir whereabouts, 
in his dinner jacket and straw hat, at the foot of the terrace, when suddenly the 
nunlike sisters with the governess and four steps behind them tadzio appeared 
in the light of the arc lights. obviously they were coming from the steamship 
landing, after they had dined in the city for some reason. it had been chilly on 
the water; tadzio was wearing a dark blue sailor's overcoat with golden buttons 
and an associated cap on his head. the sun and the marine air did not burn him, 
his skin had stayed marble-like yellowish as in the beginning; but he seemed more 
pale than usual, be it because of the cold or because of the blanching moonlight of 
the lamps. his symmetrical brows looked more defined, his eyes very dark. he was 
more beautiful than can be expressed in words and aschenbach again felt pain 
about the inability of word

s to truly describe beauty instead of just praising it. 

he had not recognized the dear figure, it came unexpectedly, so he did not 
have time to take on an expression of calm and dignity. joy, surprise, admiration 
could be read in it when his gaze met that of the missing one — and in that second 
it happened that tadzio smiled: smiled at him, familiarly, lovely, and openly, with 
lips that only slowly parted during the smile. it was the smile of narcissus who 
bends above the reflecting water, that deep, enchanting, protracted smile, with 
which he extends his arms towards the mirror image of his own beauty — a slightly 
distorted smile, distorted from the hopelessness of his longing to kiss the pretty 
lips of his shadow, flirtatious, curious and somewhat tormented, infatuating and 
infatuated.

not like everyday order and 
well-being and every slight undoing of the bourgeois system, every confusion and 
infestation of the world is welcome to it, because it can unconditionally expect to 
find its advantage in it. so aschenbach felt a somber content about the cover-up of 
the terrible happenings in the grimy streets of the city that merged with his own 
innermost secret, happenings in the covertness of which he also had an interest. 
because the lover was troubled by nothing except that tadzio might depart and 
realized with terror that he would not know how to go on in life in that event. 

as of late it was not enough for him to leave proximity and sight of the beautiful 
boy to chance or the daily schedule; he followed him around, he traced his steps. 
on sunday for example the poles never appeared at the beach; he guessed that 
they were attending mass in st mark's, he hastened there and entering from 
the fervent square into the golden dawn of the sanctuary, he found the needed

e stood in the back, on the jagged mosaic 
floor, among kneeling, murmuring people crossing themselves and the compact 
splendor of the oriental-looking temple rested heavily on his senses. in the front, 
the ornate priest was singing and wielding his utensils, incense was in the air, 
encompassing the weak flames of the candles on the altar and into that dull and 
honeyed sacrificial scent another one seemed to mix: that of the sickened city. but 
through the mist and brilliance aschenbach saw tadzio turn his head, look for 
him, and find him. 

when the crowds were exiting the church onto the gleaming square teeming 
with doves, the infatuated one hid himself in an ambush. he saw the poles come 
from the church, saw the children say goodbye to their mother ceremoniously and 
how she turned to the piazzetta on her way back to the hotel; he determined that 
the handsome lad, his nunlike sisters and the governess were taking the way right 
of the clock tower and into the merceria, and, puttin

and in dirty blind alleys and had to suffer expressions of mortal pain when they 
suddenly came towards him in a narrow passage where evasion was impossible. yet 
one could not say that he was suffering. his mind and his soul were intoxicated, 
and his steps were dictated by the demon who delights in destroying man's reason 
and dignity. 

at some point, tadzio and his took a gondola, and aschenbach, hidden from 
their sight by a well, did the same when they had left. he talked in an abrupt 
and muffled voice when he ordered the gondolier, promising a hefty tip, to follow 
discreetly that gondola that was just turning the corner; and he was overjoyed 
when the man, with the roguish servility of the opportunist, replied to him in the 
same tone that he would be served, and served well. 

so he floated, seated on soft black cushions, behind that other e

 wet his lips with a mixture of 
pomegranate juice and soda which glimmered ruby-red in his glass. he took in 
the squeaky music, the vulgar and pining melodies, because passion immobilizes 
good taste and seriously considers what soberly would be thought of as funny and 
to be resented. the clownish escapades had made him take on a fixed and almost 
hurting expression of amusement. he sat there in a relaxed way, while his interior 
was tense with attentiveness, because six paces apart from him tadzio was leaning 
against the stone railing.

he stood there in a white suit which he sometimes wore for dinner, in inevitable 
and inborn grace, the left forearm on the railing, feet crossed, the right hand on his 
hip and looked with an expression that was almost unsmiling, more like a distant 
curiosity, a courteous acceptance at the singers below. sometimes he straightened 
himself and pulled, with an elegant motion, his jacket through his leather belt. but

er man registered it with triumph, with a floundering of 
his reason and also with horror, he turned around, either hesitatingly and slowly 
or quickly and suddenly, as if to take by surprise, over his left shoulder towards the 
chair of his lover. he did not meet his eyes, because a frightened concern forced 
the other one to keep himself from looking. also on the terrace were the women 
who guarded tadzio and he he feared to have become conspicuous. indeed, he had 
noticed with a kind of torpidity that tadzio had been called away from him, at 
the beach, in the hotel, and at st mark's, that there was an attempt to keep them 
separate — and which implied a grave accusation which tormented him and which 
his conscience kept him from refuting. 

in the meantime the guitarist had begun a solo to his own accompaniment, a 
multi- verse song that was currently making its rounds through italy, in the

ed; he pointed with his finger at the merry society as if 
nothing could be funnier and finally everybody was laughing in the veranda and 
the garden, including the waiters, elevator attendants and servants in the door. 

aschenbach no longer reclined in his chair, he sat erect as if trying to fight or 
flee. but the laughter, the wafting hospital odor and the closeness of the beautiful 
boy immobilized him like an inescapable spell. in the general commotion and 
distraction he dared to look at tadzio and registered that the other one also 
remained serious when answering his gaze, as if their behavior and expressions 
were linked and as if he was not influenced by the general mood since his lover 
was evading it. this childlike obedience was so disarming, so overpowering that 
the gray-haired one found it hard not to bury his face in his hands. it had also

sighs, a tightness of the chest. "he is sickly, he will

them, and their leader did not fail to embellish his exit with jests. his bows and 
blowing of kissing were considered amusing, and so he redoubled them. when the 
others were already gone he pretended to run backwards into a lamp post, arriving 
at the gate in apparent pain. there he suddenly cast off his mask of the funny 
jinx, straightened himself up, stuck out his tongue at the guests on the terrace 
and disappeared into the darkness. the society of travelers dispersed; tadzio 
was no longer standing at the balustrade. but the loner continued to sit with his 
drink at his table for a long time to the astonishment of the waiters. the night 
proceeded, time itself withered. in his parents' house, many years ago, there had 
been an hourglass — he suddenly saw the frail and important device again as if it 
stood before his eyes. silently and finely the rust-colored sand traversed the glassy 
bottleneck, and since it was becoming less in the upper half, a small torrenti

handed to them. in febrile excitement, triumphantly in possession of the truth, 
with a taste of disgust on his tongue and fantastic horror in heart, the loner paced 
up and down on the flags of the square. he considered a cathartic and decent deed. 
he could approach the pearl-wearing woman after dinner and talk to her like this: 
"please allow this stranger, madam, to give you advice and warning, kept from 
you by selfishness. depart, depart right now, with tadzio and your daughters! 
venice is diseased!" then he could place his hand upon the crown of that tool of 
a taunting god, turn around and flee from this swamp. but he immediately felt 
he did not really want to take that step. it would lead him back, give his soul 
back to himself; but when one is frantic, the last thing one desires is to be oneself 
again. he recalled that white edifice, ornate with glistening inscriptions, in the 
iridescent mystery of which the mind wandered; that strange wande

 other people; 
their suspicion was no longer important to him. at any rate they were fleeing and 
departing; many beach huts stood empty, the dining room was not full, and in 
the city foreigners were only rarely seen. the truth seemed to have percolated 
and a panic unavoidable, despite the sticking-together of the interested parties. 
but the woman with the pearl necklace stayed, be it because the rumors did not 
get through to her or because she was too proud and unafraid to yield to them: 
tadzio stayed; and aschenbach sometimes thought that through departure or death 
everyone else could be removed so that he could remain alone with the beautiful 
boy on the island — when in the morning his looks rested heavily, irresponsibly, 
and continually on the desired one, when he followed him unworthily through he 
stinking streets with their air of death, this monstrosity seemed promising to him, 
and moral laws no longer applicable.

fected. 

following the handsome lad, aschenbach had ventured deeply into the labyrinth 
of the afflicted city. losing his orientation, since the little streets, canals, bridges 
and squares all looked too much alike, no longer sure about his bearing, he made an 
effort not to lose the desired idol from his sight and, forced into shameful delicacy, 
pressed against walls and taking cover behind other people, he did not realize 
how tired and exhausted his emotions and his suspense had made him. tadzio 
was walking behind the others, letting the governess and his nunlike sisters go 
first in the cramped space, and ambling solitarily he sometimes turned his head, 
looking with his strangely gray eyes to make sure that his lover was still in tow. 
he saw him and did not give him away. intoxicated by that knowledge, enticed to 
continue by those eyes, goaded by his passion, the inamorato traced an unsuitable 
hope — and still eventually had the sight taken away from him. the poles had

 response was: "after lunch." he nodded and 
went out towards the ocean. 

it was unwelcoming there. undulating ripples ran across the distant sea between 
the beach and the first sandbank. a sense of autumn lay over the place that had 
once been so lively and colorful, that was now almost abandoned and the beach of 
which was no longer kept clean. a camera, apparently unappropriated, stood at 
the shore on a tripod and the black cloth that was draped over it was flapping in 
the cold breeze. 

tadzio was playing at the right in front of their hut with the three or four 
comrades he had left and aschenbach watched him for a last time, with a blanket 
on his knees, seated about midway between the sea and the row of huts. the game, 
that was unsupervised, as the women were probably busy with the impending 
departure, seemed to be without rules and soon degenerated. the sturdy one called 
"jaschu" had been blinded by a throw of sand towards his eyes and had forced 
tadzio to wrestle, a fight th

his attempts to throw off the boy on his back slowly subsided. the horrified

aschenbach almost wanted to step in when the victim was finally released. tadzio, 
very pale, sat up and remained there for a few minutes unmoving and with dark 
eyes and disorderly hair. then he stood up and went away. he was called, at 
first heartily, then imploringly; but he did not respond. the black-haired one, 
who might have felt regret about his transgression, overtook him and tried to 
reconcile himself with him. a gesture of the shoulder rebuked him. tadzio walked 
diagonally towards the water. he was barefoot and wore his striped bathing suit 
with the red bow.
