ntic wars; and johnny got his gun was probably the last american novel written
about it before an entirely different affair called world war ii got under way.
the book has a weird political history. written in 1938 when pacifism was anathema
to the american left and most of the center, it went to the printers in the spring of 1939
and was published on september thirdâ€”ten days after the nazi-soviet pact, two days
after the start of world war ii.
shortly thereafter, on the recommendation of mr. joseph wharton lippincott (who
felt it would stimulate sales), serial rights were sold to the daily worker of new york
city. for months thereafter the book was a rally point for the left.
after pearl harbor its subject matter seemed as inappropriate to the times as the
shriek of bagpipes. mr. paul blanshard, speaking of army censorship in the right to
read (1955) says, "a few pro-axis foreign-language magazines had been banned, as well
as three books, including dalton trumbo's pacifist novel johnny

mbarrassed. they knew
that anyone who smelled the disinfectant knew they were bums on charity. they didn't
like that and how could you blame them? they were always humble and when they were
bright enough they worked hard. some of them weren't bright. some of them couldn't
even read the orders on the bins. one of them came from the turpentine country in
georgia. he'd never been to school at all. most of the lazy ones came from texas.
one night a porto rican came up from the mission. his name was jose. things were
always pretty scrambled up in the shipping room on friday nights with boxes and dollies
and racks scattered through the aisles and guys hollering and the conveyor belts rattling
away and the rotary ovens upstairs screeching as they moved on hot greaseless plates. it
was pretty much of a mess and most of the mission guys were confused when they first
came to work. but not jose. he looked over the place and listened quietly to instructions
and then went to work. he was tall with brow

n eyes and he was pretty good looking for a
mexican or porto rican or whatever he was. there was something about him that told
you he was a little different from the other mission guys or that maybe he had been a
little luckier than the rest.
on friday nights all the guys ate their lunches up in the men's can instead of going
out to a restaurant because there were benches and lockers there and you could sit down
on the benches and eat your lunch in a hurry and get back to work. jose hadn't brought
any lunch so the guys stole a pint of milk from the bakery ice-box and gave him a roll
with it. joe was very grateful. while he munched his roll and drank his milk he talked. he
said that california was a wonderful country. he said it was even more wonderful than
his porto rico. he said that it was getting spring now and soon he would be able to sleep
in the park. he said california was a great country for people who had no place to sleep
because it didn't get so cold and you cou

 but there should be many jobs for a young man like himself with ambition in a
business as great as the movies. he said that he thought he might like to work in the
research department at one of the studios. perhaps someone could give him some
information about getting a job in a studio yes?
the guys just looked at him and grunted. if any of them knew how to get work in a
studio wouldn't they have done it long ago instead of sticking around this lousy bakery?
no. nobody knew how to get work for jose in a studio.
jose just shrugged. it was pretty hard he said. when he came to new york things
were going very well for him and then a very rich girl fell in love with him and he had to
come away from there.
a rich girl fallen in love with you jose?
yes. he had got a job as chauffeur for a very rich family that lived on fifth avenue
and things were very well and then the daughter of the family took a liking to him so jose
and the daughter struck a bargain. the daughter wanted to learn spanish and

 jose wanted
to improve his english so they started trading lessons. and then the girl she fell in love
with him and wanted to marry him and so he had to come away from new york and he
came to california.
the guys sitting around in the can just looked at each other and didn't say anything.
everybody who came from the mission had a line. everybody had been way up in the
money and then wham something had happened and now they were in the mission. long
ago the guys at the bakery learned that it was no u

se to argue with guys from the mission.
no matter how closely you questioned them and no matter how many of their stories you
proved were lies they still stuck to them. they had to stick to them. their stories were
their only excuse for being what they were so in time the guys at the bakery came to
accept the stories told by the guys from the mission and to say nothing. so after jose got
through with his talking they grunted and went back to work again.
next week was easter and that meant hot cross buns and that meant there would
have to be lots of extra help because the shipping crew couldn't put out twenty or thirty
thousand dozen hot cross buns without extra men. so jody simmons offered jose a job
for the week and jose took it. he was such a good worker on hot cross buns that when
larruping larry quit jose got larry's job. he was very grateful and very quiet. he was
also
 
 ___________________________
 
 pleased that the weather was warmer. he was sleeping in the park and that was a
wonderful thing. you saved money and jose needed money for clothes. a man who is
going to work in the studios must be well dressed said jose.
then one day jose came in with a letter. he was very puzzled. he showed it to the
guys and asked their advice. americans were such strange people he said and you never
knew what their customs were exactly. so what should a gentleman do under these
circumstances?
the guys all read jose's letter. it was on a very expensive piece of stationery and
written in a woman's hand. at the top of the page was a tiny little engraved address on
fifth avenue in new york. it was a letter from the girl jose had been telling abou
 
 ___________________________
 
t. in the
letter she said she wished he would give her his address so she wouldn't have to be writing
him general delivery all the time. she had come into some money of her own just a
little over a half a million dollars and as soon as she found out where jose was living she
was coming to los angeles to marry him.
this gave the guys at the bakery something to think about. jose might be full of bull
like all the other mission bums but it began to look like this girl of his was the real thing.
jesus christ they said to jose don't be a damn fool marry the girl. send her your address
and let her come out just as fast as she can and let her bring all her jack with her and
marry her before she changes her mind. but jose shook his head. he said there wasn't any
danger of her changing her mind because like he had said the girl was crazy about him.
and certainly he had no obj
 
 ___________________________
 
ections to marrying a girl with money. in fact he thought the
only intelligent thing for a young man without money to do was to marry a young lady
who had money. but he wanted also to love the girl with money that he would marry
some day. this girl it was too bad but he didn't love her.
well i'm a sonofabitch said the guys at the bakery you can learn to love her can't
you? no said jose sorrowfully i cannot. he just wanted to know what the american
custom about such things was and how he could write the girl and explain to her. was it
polite for an american gentleman to tell an american girl he didn't love her? but no of
course not that would be ungallant. would it not be better to have a friend maybe one of
the people of the bakery write to the girl and explain to her that jose had shot himself because
of his love and now was cremated? jose was willing to do anything to make

it
right.
by this time all the guys figured jose was crazy. but they also figured he was kind of
smart crazy. when he told tall stories about his native porto rico the guys paid more attention
to him figuring that since his story about the girl was true there might be a fiftyfifty
chance that his stories about porto rico were also true. jose was a very funny guy
but then the bakery was full of funny guys and it was just as well not to question them too
closely. you took them as they came and said nothing.
after about a month of this jose came in one night with a very worried look on his
face.
what's the matter jose? why do you look so down in the dumps jose? jose sighed
and frowned. he had run into a very serious problem he said. what problem jose? he had
been out all day as usual he said looking for a job and he had found the job.
 
 ___________________________
 

they all got interested then because everybody at the bakery wanted a better job only
none of them ever found one. where did you get this better job jose? in a studio of course
said jose. that is why i came to california. didn't i tell you i came to find work in the
studios?
nobody said anything. they just stared at jose. from anybody else this would have
seemed like more bull but from jose they knew it was the truth. how did you like that?
as far as the guys at the bakery were concerned the studios might just as well be in china
as in hollywood. they paid good dough but nobody except an uncle or maybe a nephew
could crack them. yet jose just as calm as a cucumber had walked into one and got what
he wanted.
how did you get this job jose? i asked for it said jose. oh said the guys at the
bakery. then they sat around and stared at him some more. finally somebody spoke up
and said jo
 
 ___________________________
 
se what's all this about a problem and why are you so worried?
jose looked surprised. anybody should know that he said. he had come to california
and he had been without money and he had been full of disinfectant from the midnight
mission and he had been very unhappy. then this nice gentleman jody simmons had
accepted him into the bakery and given him a fine job. that made him indebted to jody
simmons no? very well. he was indebted to jody simmons and now he had found a job.
how was he to get out of the job jody simmons had given him in order to take the new
jo
 
 ___________________________
 
immons to shove the job up his ass. another one said just not to show up for work
tomorrow and jody simmons would catch on real quick. and there were several other
ways the guys at the bakery could think of. there ought to have been. they'd been
thinking of them for years. a lot of talent had gone to waste thinking of ways to tell jody
simmons you were quitting. here was a guy who was actually going to do it so naturally
everyone cooperated.
but when all of the solutions had been offered to him jose shook his head and his
eyes looked sadder than ever. he said no he must think of a better way. it would not be
gentlemanly to resign in any of the ways suggested. jody simmons was his benefactor
and one did not do such things to one's benefactor. even if it were an american custom to
do it differently still he would have to follow the customs of his native porto rico and in
porto rico one did not do such things if one were well born.
when you start work on this job jose? this morning said jose 
 
 ___________________________
 
and i am very tired
and now i am going to have to work all night and that will make me much tireder in the
morning for the other job and so it will go and it is a terrible problem and i don't know
what to do.
so jose worked all night and the guys in the bakery thought about it and it finally
became as puzzling to them as it was to jose. they would start to think of a way out for
jose and begin to speak and then they would shake their heads and say no that wouldn't
do it and then they would go on with their work thinking very hard. this guy jose was a
very queer duck and his ideas were crazy but everybody by this time wanted to find a
solution so it became a matter of deep interest to the whole night crew.
the night ended. all the guys in the crew went home and slept and then came back
to work that night wondering about jose. jose came back too. he was getting pale. he
said 
 
 ___________________________
 
aced
the first glare of sunlight outside the bakery he was a very weak looking man. all the next
day he worked for the studio and the next night when he came to work he was almost
tottering. he said please please think of some way i can quit this job because a man's
health will last only for so long and mine is breaking rapidly since i had no sleep at all
today and a man must have sleep if he is going to handle even one job in an honest
fashion.
then pinky carson happened to think of something. jose said pinky carson i'll tell
you what you do. about two in the morning when the pie run comes down you just pick
up six or eight pies in their boxes and walk over in front of where that little window is out
of jody's office so he can see you and you drop those damned pies. then jody'll fire you
and everything will be all right. jose thought for a little while. i do not like the use of
violence he said finally but i am a desperate man and if you think violence will work i
will use it. he thought 
 
 ___________________________
 
a little more and then said i can pay for these pies i have violated
yes? everybody said yes if he wanted to be a fool he could pay for the pies he violated.
so that night about two or three o'clock jose took six pies and stationed himself in
the direct line of jody's vision outside the window of jody's lean-to office. all the guys
were close around looking as if they were working but really watching jose. they were
watching for the minute when jody simmons would look out through that window from
his desk. when he looked pinky was to give a signal and then jose would dump the pies.
it seemed that it took jody longer to look out that window than it ever had before. but
finally he did and pinky carson gave the signal and jose dropped the pies.
jody came zipping out of his office like a bumblebee. he said what the hell is the
matter with you you clumsy bastard you turned all these pies over. they'r
 
 ___________________________
 
e ruined and
you'll have to pay for them. poor jose stood there almost melting with sadness. he turned
his big eyes on jody simmons and he said i am so sorry mister simmons that i have
violated pies. it was an accident i assure you and only a poor workman would have done
it and i am miserable about it and i will gladly pay for them and you will accept my
apologies yes?
jody simmons looked real hard at jose for a moment and then a smile broke over his
face and he said why sure jose we all make mistakes. you can pay for the pies. he said
jose you are a good conscientious workman and i don't mind if you make a mistake once
in a while. he said jose i wish i had more men like you now forget about the whole thing
and go back to work.
jose stood there kind of quivering all over and shaking his head as if he couldn't
believe such bad luck could happen to him. then he turned and looked at the guys in the
crew who had been watching. he looked at pinky carson like a dog that has be

betrayed by its master. then he turned and walked over in the first aisle and began to go
to work again.
pinky carson worked over toward him as soon as possible. look here jose he said
the idea was all right only it wasn't big enough. to quit a fine job like this you want to do
something very big. the pie run is all finished for tonight but don't give up hope jose
because we have a pie run every night and tomorrow you can get one of those big racks
of pies. you can get one of those racks that has a hundred and eighty pies just think of it
and you can put that rack in the same place and then you can push the rack over and it
will make a hell of a mess. oh boy oh boy what a mess and then jody simmons will fire
you sure.
jose looked at pinky carson and said the whole thing is very dishonorable but my
constitution will not stand very much more so i will do i
 
 ___________________________
 
t tomorrow night when the pie
run comes. then he staggered back to his work.
most of the guys couldn't sleep next day they were so anxious to see jose dump over
that rack. they all came to work early. jody simmons didn't get in until around ten
o'clock usually. but everybody was hoping he would be in early so they would have a
longer time to look at the face of a man who was going to see one hundred and eighty
pies turned over right in front of his office. but when they passed jody's office and
looked into it jody wasn't there. there was nothing but a big long box that looked like a
floral box lying on jody's desk. they all glanced at the box
 
 ___________________________
 
 and then went on upstairs and
changed for work and pretty soon jose came in. the first part of the night was the longest
any of them ever put in.
about ten o'clock jody simmons checked in. everybody watched because everybody
was curious about that box on his desk. jody walked into the office and stared at the box
like it might be a time bomb. he was a very tough man and anything unusual about the
place always aroused his suspicions. finally he must have decided the box was safe
because he began to open it very carefully. two dozen american beauty roses fell out

the bakeshop while
they were being boxed to check up on them. that night they had apple and vanilla cream
and blueberry and peach. pinky carson hefted each kind and tested its crust and the
thickness of the filling. the crew was well up on its work that night so they could catch
the pie run while it was still hot. pinky carson decided that the blueberry pies would run
the best if they were dumped. so he very carefully picked a rack of the hottest and
brought them down on the freight elevator to jose.
jose was trembling like a leaf. all the guys stationed near jody simmons' window
looked like they were working but they were really doing nothing but making motions.
very carefully pinky worked the pie rack over to the spot in front of jody simmons'
window. then he ducked to one side and began making signals to jose. jose came up
looking like a whipped dog. he went to the pie rack and put his hand up against the back
of it. it wouldn't take much of a push to knock it over. jose stood there jus

t leaning
against it and looking sad. everybody was waiting for jody simmons to look out of the
window. it seemed like hours. finally he did and pinky carson gave the signal. jose just
pushed a little harder with his hand and the rack went down with a hell of a crash. one
hundred and eighty hot blueberry pies spread all over the shipping room floor.
for a minute jody just sat in his chair and stared. he looked like he couldn't believe a
thing like this could ever happen to him. then it looked like someone gave him an
electrical shock because instead of pushing his chair back before getting up he shot
straight up like a man on a stove and came running and hollering out of
 
 ___________________________
 
 his office. jose
just stood there and looked at him. jose was much taller than jody simmons. he looked
down at jody and his eyes were the saddest things on earth. jody began screaming at him
you lousy spick bastard last night i gave you another chance and tonight what do you do?
you smash one hundred and eighty blueberry pies. you know what this means you
sonofabitch? this means you're through you're fired get out. get out and don't ever let me
see you again you lousy dirty spick get out.
jose stood for a minute and looked at jody simmons like he was forgiving him for
everything he said. then he turned and walked slowly up to the can. all the guys as quick
as they could sneaked up there after him. jose was almost talking to himself. this is the
first time i have ever done anything so dishonorable said jose. never have i thought i
would stoop to such trickery. mister simmons he is quite right. he is a fine gentleman
who gave me a job when i was in need. i have repaid him with ingratit
 
 ___________________________
 
ude. i am a wretch.
there is nothing more to be said no?
look here jose said rudy maybe you know something about those flowers on jody's
desk. jose nodded. yes he said but it is what you call it a secret. i have bought the flowers
this afternoon and sent them to mister simmons. well you damn fool said rudy how's he
going to know you sent them if you didn't put any name on them?
jose said that is not a matter for discussion. the important thing is that mr. simmons
he receives the flowers. flowers are beautiful. mister simmons is a gentleman and he
will enjoy them. that he should know where they came from that is quite beside the
point. i know that i have expressed my gratitude with something beautiful. i know that i
have tried to repay him for the splendid things he has done for me. it is not important that
mr. simmons he should know it. it is only important that he should 
 
 ___________________________
 
receive the roses yes?
jose put on his coat and walked out of the bakery and nobody ever saw him again.
next day he didn't show up for his check. instead jody simmons received through the
mail a money order from jose for nineteen dollars and eighty-seven cents which with his
pay-check would pay for the pies . . .
it seemed that jose was standing in front of him now weaving back and forth in a
kind of fog. he was talking to jose. he was saying how is everything with you jose how
are you doing? talk right up jose and tell me about how you are doing and how you ever
came out with that rich girl. talk louder jose because i don't seem to be hearing so well
lately. real loud jose. and come up close because i can't move much. later on yes but
right now you see i'm in bed. how's that jose how's that?
jose!
wait a minute wait a minute jose. excuse me. you see i thought we were all in the
bakery together again. i thought we were all there. but we're not. i must have been

himself. he had only heard it as his mother read it to him. he couldn't remember the
words but he could still see the pictures that used to come into his mind as his mother
read. he knew the story by heart.
all the people were going to bethlehem because it was tax time and they had to
appear at the court house and register and pay up. they had been pouring in all day long
and now it was night and the town was filled. among those coming in was a man by the
name of joseph who was a carpenter in the town of nazareth.
joseph had to do a lot of chores before he could start out and mary his wife was
pregnant and couldn't help him so they were late. it was already dark by the time they
came to the outskirts of bethlehem. joseph was leading their donkey and mary poor
wide-eyed girl was riding it and hoping they'd get settled soon because she was already
feeling her pains and knew they didn't have much time. it was her first baby and she
wasn't quite sure what to do 
 
 ___________________________
 
when the time came.
as soon as they got into the town joseph began making the rounds of cheap rooming
houses. he wasn't much of a success at making money and they only had enough to pay
their taxes and one night's rent. they went from rooming house to rooming house with
mary getting more frightened as her pains increased but the rooming houses were all
filled because there were plenty of poor people even then and they had all beaten joseph
to the bargain places. finally they counted their money and joseph decided they would
try the hotel. they could get a back bedroom and maybe he could do a little work around
the place in the morning if their money didn't quite stretch out.
but the hotel was filled too.
then joseph began to talk very seriously to the hotel manager. see here he said i've
come a long way and i've got my wife with me and she's going to have a baby. look at
her out there on the donkey you see she's just a kid and 
 
 ___________________________
 
 i couldn't get anybody to stay
with her overnight because they're all here paying their taxes. i've got to find a place for
her to sleep and that's all there is to it.
the hotel manager looked out into the darkness and saw mary's white anxious face
there. she's a pretty kid he thought and scared too like her husband says. it'll be an awful
mess if she has a baby on the premises people who can't afford them shouldn't have
babies anyway but what are you going to do about it? all right he said to joseph i guess i
can find a place for you. see that passageway over there? well go right on through it and
you'll come to the barn. there's a manger at the far end. i'll have one of the boys throw
down some hay and it'll be comfortable. i don't mind telling you i hope very much she
doesn't have her baby here tonight because it'll upset my guests if she screams and they're
all very high-class people including three roman congressmen. but go ahead.
joseph said thanks and started off toward mary. oh i

almost forgot yelled the hotel
keeper after him don't light any fires out there in the barn because in my insurance it says
they're forbidden and i can't afford to have my insurance cancelled. joseph hollered that
he would be careful and the hotel keeper went back into the warm and stood in front of
the fire and thought it's a shame people having kids all over the place it's good and chilly
tonight too i do hope she doesn't make a fuss.
back in the manger joseph lighted a lantern and fixed up a nice bed on the hay and
mary lay down on the bed and had her baby. it was a boy. they wrapped it up in a
blanket they had brought especially for it and mary who was a good strong girl held the
baby real tight against her. i was almost sure it would be a boy she said to joseph. what
are we going to name it? joseph asked her. i think i would like to name it jesus she said.
she looked quickly down at the baby and back to joseph the fright all gone from her eyes

but joseph staring down at the two of them didn't smile. mary noticed this and said
joseph what's the matter you don't look happy it's a fine baby look at its chubby hands
why don't you smile? and joseph said there's a light around the head of our baby a shine
that is soft like moonlight. mary nodded as if she weren't a bit surprised and said i think
there must be a light like that around the heads of all newborn babies they're so fresh
from heaven. and joseph said in a kind of sick voice as if he had suddenly lost something
there's a light around your head too mary.
out in the hills beyond bethlehem a sheep herder was trying to get a little rest. the
sheep were all lying down and there had been such a hub-bub in bethlehem from so
many people coming from all directions that he was sure the wolves were scared back
into the hills so there wasn't any risk in him getting forty winks. he lay there sleeping
when suddenly he woke up with a light shining i
