Papa-Daddy - 
                Sister's grandfather. With his long, shaggy beard, Papa-Daddy is the classic crotchety old man, whose deafness and salty attitude cut him off from active participation in family life. He is proud of his connections and the fact that he was able to get Sister her position at the post office, which he often lords over Sister during arguments.
