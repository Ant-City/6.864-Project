chapter 1. mr. sherlock holmes



mr. sherlock holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save
upon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated
at the breakfast table. i stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the
stick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. it was a
fine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as
a â€œpenang lawyer.â€ just under the head was a broad silver band nearly
an inch across. â€œto james mortimer, m.r.c.s., from his friends of the
c.c.h.,â€ was engraved upon it, with the date â€œ1884.â€ it was just such a
stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to carry--dignified,
solid, and reassuring.

â€œwell, watson, what do you make of it?â€

holmes was sitting with his back to me, and i had given him no sign of
my occupation.

â€œhow did you know what i was doing? i believe you have eyes in the back
of your head.â€

â€œi have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in

 front of
me,â€ said he. â€œbut, tell me, watson, what do you make of our visitorâ€™s
stick? since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and have no
notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of importance.
let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of it.â€

â€œi think,â€ said i, following as far as i could the methods of my
companion, â€œthat dr. mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,
well-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their
appreciation.â€

â€œgood!â€ said holmes. â€œexcellent!â€

â€œi think also that the probability is in favour of his being a country
practitioner who does a great deal of his visiting on foot.â€

â€œwhy so?â€

â€œbecause this stick, though originally a very handsome one has been so
knocked about that i can hardly imagine a town practitioner carrying it.
the thick-iron ferrule is worn down

â€™ what further inferences may we draw?â€

â€œdo none suggest themselves? you know my methods. apply them!â€

â€œi can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised
in town before going to the country.â€

â€œi think that we might venture a little farther than this. look at it
in this light. on what occasion would it be most probable that such a
presentation would be made? when would his friends unite to give him
a pledge of their good will? obviously at the moment when dr. mortimer
withdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start a practice
for himself. we know there has been a presentation. we believe there has
been a change from a town hospital to a country practice. is it, then,
stretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the
occasion of the change?â€

â€œit certainly seems probable.â€

â€œnow, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the
hospital, since only a man well-established in a london practice could

i laughed incredulously as sherlock holmes leaned back in his settee and
blew little wavering rings of smoke up to the ceiling.

â€œas to the latter part, i have no means of checking you,â€ said i, â€œbut
at least it is not difficult to find out a few particulars about the
manâ€™s age and professional career.â€ from my small medical shelf i took
down the medical directory and turned up the name. there were several
mortimers, but only one who could be our visitor. i read his record
aloud.

        â€œmortimer, james, m.r.c.s., 1882, grimpen, dartmoor, devon.

glanced up in surprise.

â€œmy dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?â€

â€œfor the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very
door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. donâ€™t move, i beg you,
watson. he is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be
of assistance to me. now is the dramatic moment of fate, watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether for good or ill. what does dr. james mortimer, the man
of science, ask of sherlock holmes, the specialist in crime? come in!â€

the appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since i had expected
a typical country practitioner. he was a very tall, thin man, with a
long nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes,
set closely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of
gold-rimmed glasses. he was clad in a professional but rather slovenly
fashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. thoug

towards it with an exclamation of joy. â€œi am so very glad,â€ said he.
â€œi was not sure whether i had left it here or in the shipping office. i
would not lose that stick for the world.â€

â€œa presentation, i see,â€ said holmes.

â€œyes, sir.â€

â€œfrom charing cross hospital?â€

â€œfrom one or two friends there on the occasion of my marriage.â€

â€œdear, dear, thatâ€™s bad!â€ said holmes, shaking his head.

dr. mortimer blinked through his glasses in mild astonishment. â€œwhy was
it bad?â€

â€œonly that you have disarranged our little deductions. your marriage,
you say?â€

â€œyes, sir. i married, and so left the hospital, and with it all hopes of
a consulting practice. it was necessary to make a home of my own.â€

â€œcome, come, we are not so far wrong, after all,â€ said holmes. â€œand now,
dr. james mortimer--â€

â€œmister, sir, mister--a humble m.r.c.s.â€

â€œand a man of precise mind, evidently.â€

â€œindeed, sir! may i inquire who has the honour to be the first?â€ asked
holmes with some asperity.

â€œto the man of precisely scientific mind the work of monsieur bertillon
must always appeal strongly.â€

â€œthen had you not better consult him?â€

â€œi said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. but as a practical man
of affairs it is acknowledged that you stand alone. i trust, sir, that i
have not inadvertently--â€

â€œjust a little,â€ said holmes. â€œi think, dr. mortimer, you would do
wisely if without more ado you would kindly tell me plainly what the
exact nature of the problem is in which you demand my assistance.â€




chapter 2. the curse of the baskervilles



â€œi have in my pocket a manuscript,â€ said dr. james mortimer.

â€œi observed it as you entered the room,â€ said holmes.

â€œit is an old manuscript.â€

â€œearly eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.â€

â€œhow can you say that, sir?â€

â€œyou have presented an inch or two of it to my ex

that you have been talking. it would be a poor expert who could not give
the date of a document within a decade or so. you may possibly have read
my little monograph upon the subject. i put that at 1730.â€

â€œthe exact date is 1742.â€ dr. mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.
â€œthis family paper was committed to my care by sir charles baskerville,
whose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much
excitement in devonshire. i may say that i was his personal friend as
well as his medical attendant. he was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,
practical, and as unimaginative as i am myself. yet he took this
document very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end
as did eventually overtake him.â€

holmes str

â€œbut i understand that it is something more modern and practical upon
which you wish to consult me?â€

â€œmost modern. a most practical, pressing matter, which must be decided
within twenty-four hours. but the manuscript is short and is intimately
connected with the affair. with your permission i will read it to you.â€

holmes leaned back in his chair, placed his finger-tips together, and
closed his eyes, with an air of resignation. dr. mortimer turned the
manuscript to the light and read in a high, cracking voice the following
curious, old-world narrative:

        â€œof the origin of the hound of the baskervilles there
        have been many statements, yet as i come in a direct
        line from hugo baskerville, and as i had the story from
        my father, who also had it from his, i have set it down
        with all belief that it occurred even as is here set
        forth.  and i would have you believe, my sons, that the

        crossing the moor in those dark hours when the powers of
        evil are exalted.

        â€œ[this from hugo baskerville to his sons rodger and john,
        with instructions that they say nothing thereof to their
        sister elizabeth.]â€

when dr. mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed
his spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at mr. sherlock
holmes. the latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the
fire.

â€œwell?â€ said he.

â€œdo you not find it interesting?â€

â€œto a collector of fairy tales.â€

dr. mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.

â€œnow, mr. holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. this
is the devon county chronicle of may 14th of this year. it is a shor

        husband acting as butler and the wife as housekeeper.
        their evidence, corroborated by that of several friends,
        tends to show that sir charlesâ€™s health has for some time
        been impaired, and points especially to some affection
        of the heart, manifesting itself in changes of colour,
        breathlessness, and acute attacks of nervous depression.
        dr. james mortimer, the friend and medical attendant of
        the deceased, has given evidence to the same effect.

        â€œthe facts of the case are simple.  sir charles baskerville
        was in the habit every night before going to bed of walking
        down the famous yew alley of baskerville hall.  the evidence
        of the barrymores shows that this had been his custom.
        on the fourth of may sir charles had declared his intention
        of starting next day for london, and had ordered barry

        the moor at no great distance at the time, but he appears
        by his own confession to have been the worse for drink.
        he declares that he heard cries but is unable to state
        from what direction they came.  no signs of violence were
        to be discovered upon sir charlesâ€™s person, and though
        the doctorâ€™s evidence pointed to an almost incredible
        facial distortion--so great that dr. mortimer refused at
        first to believe that it was indeed his friend and patient
        who lay before him--it was explained that that is a symptom
        which is not unusual in cases of dyspnoea and death from
        cardiac exhaustion.  this explanation was borne out by
        the post-mortem examination, which showed long-standing
        organic disease, and the coronerâ€™s jury returned a
        verdict in accordance with the medical evidence.  it is
        well that this is so, for it

t an end to the romantic stories which have been
        whispered in connection with the affair, it might have been
        difficult to find a tenant for baskerville hall.  it is
        understood that the next of kin is mr. henry baskerville,
        if he be still alive, the son of sir charles baskervilleâ€™s
        younger brother.  the young man when last heard of was
        in america, and inquiries are being instituted with a
        view to informing him of his good fortune.â€

dr. mortimer refolded his paper and replaced it in his pocket. â€œthose
are the public facts, mr. holmes, in connection with the death of sir
charles baskerville.â€

â€œi must thank you,â€ said sherlock holmes, â€œfor calling my attention to a
case which certainly presents some features of interest. i had observed
some newspaper comment at the time, but i was exceedingly preoccupied
by that little affair of the vatican cameos, and in my anxiety to oblige
the pope i lost touch with several interesting engl

article, you say, contains all the public facts?â€

â€œit does.â€

â€œthen let me have the private ones.â€ he leaned back, put his finger-tips
together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial expression.

â€œin doing so,â€ said dr. mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some
strong emotion, â€œi am telling that which i have not confided to anyone.
my motive for withholding it from the coronerâ€™s inquiry is that a man of
science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of seeming
to indorse a popular superstition. i had the further motive that
baskerville hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted
if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.
for both these reasons i thought tha

ms out, his fingers dug
into the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to
such an extent that i could hardly have sworn to his identity. there was
certainly no physical injury of any kind. but one false statement was
made by barrymore at the inquest. he said that there were no traces
upon the ground round the body. he did not observe any. but i did--some
little distance off, but fresh and clear.â€

â€œfootprints?â€

â€œfootprints.â€

â€œa manâ€™s or a womanâ€™s?â€

dr. mortimer looked strangely at us for an instant, and his voice sank
almost to a whisper as he answered.

â€œmr. holmes, they were the footprints of a gigantic hound!â€




chapter 3. the problem



i confess at these words a shudder passed through me. there was a thrill
in the doctorâ€™s voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by
that which he told us. holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his
eyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly
interested.

â€œi understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a gate?â€

â€œyes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.â€

â€œis there any other opening?â€

â€œnone.â€

â€œso that to reach the yew alley one either has to come down it from the
house or else to enter it by the moor-gate?â€

â€œthere is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.â€

â€œhad sir charles reached this?â€

â€œno; he lay about fifty yards from it.â€

â€œnow, tell me, dr. mortimer--and this is important--the marks which you
saw were on the path and not on the grass?â€

â€œno marks could show on the grass.â€

â€œwere they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?â€

â€œyes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the
moor-gate.â€

ks?â€

â€œhe had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. i could
discern no others.â€

sherlock holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient
gesture.

â€œif i had only been there!â€ he cried. â€œit is evidently a case of
extraordinary interest, and one which presented immense opportunities to
the scientific expert. that gravel page upon which i might have read so
much has been long ere this smudged by the rain and defaced by the clogs
of curious peasants. oh, dr. mortimer, dr. mortimer, to think that you
should not have called me in! you have indeed much to answer for.â€

â€œi could not call you in, mr. holmes, without disclosing these facts to
the world, and i have already given my reasons for not wishing to do so.
besides, besides--â€

â€œwhy do you hesitate?â€

â€œthere is a realm in which the most acute and most experienced of
detectives is helpless.â€

â€œyou mean that the thing is supernatural?â€

â€œi did not positively say so.â€

â€œno, but you evi

 not know what to believe.â€

holmes shrugged his shoulders. â€œi have hitherto confined my
investigations to this world,â€ said he. â€œin a modest way i have combated
evil, but to take on the father of evil himself would, perhaps, be too
ambitious a task. yet you must admit that the footmark is material.â€

â€œthe original hound was material enough to tug a manâ€™s throat out, and
yet he was diabolical as well.â€

â€œi see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. but now,
dr. mortimer, tell me this. if you hold these views, why have you come
to consult me at all? you tell me in the same breath that it is useless
to investigate sir charlesâ€™s death, and that you desire me to do it.â€

â€œi did not say that i desired you to do it.â€

â€œthen, how can i assist you?â€

â€œby advising me as to what i should do with sir henry baskerville, who
arrives at waterloo stationâ€--dr. mortimer looked at his watch--â€œin
exactly one hour and a quarter.â€

â€œhe being the heir?â€

at the young man will be as safe
in devonshire as in london. he comes in fifty minutes. what would you
recommend?â€

â€œi recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
scratching at my front door, and proceed to waterloo to meet sir henry
baskerville.â€

â€œand then?â€

â€œand then you will say nothing to him at all until i have made up my
mind about the matter.â€

â€œhow long will it take you to make up your mind?â€

â€œtwenty-four hours. at ten oâ€™clock tomorrow, dr. mortimer, i will be
much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be
of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring sir henry
baskerville with you.â€

â€œi will do so, mr. holmes.â€ he scribbled the appointment on his
shirt-cuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
fashion. holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

â€œonly one more question, dr. mortimer. you say that before sir charles
baskervilleâ€™s death several people saw this apparition upon the

about.â€

â€œa large-scale map, i presume?â€

â€œvery large.â€

he unrolled one section and held it over his knee. â€œhere you have the
particular district which concerns us. that is baskerville hall in the
middle.â€

â€œwith a wood round it?â€

â€œexactly. i fancy the yew alley, though not marked under that name, must
stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon the right
of it. this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen,
where our friend dr. mortimer has his headquarters. within a radius of
five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.
here is lafter hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. there is
a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
naturalist--stapleton, if i remember right, was his name. here are two
moorland farmhouses, high tor and foulmire. then fourteen miles away the
great convict prison of princetown. between and around these scattered
points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. thi

which we may help to play
it again.â€

â€œit must be a wild place.â€

â€œyes, the setting is a worthy one. if the devil did desire to have a
hand in the affairs of men--â€

â€œthen you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.â€

â€œthe devilâ€™s agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? there are
two questions waiting for us at the outset. the one is whether any crime
has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was
it committed? of course, if dr. mortimerâ€™s surmise should be correct,
and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of nature,
there is an end of our investigation. but we are bound to exhaust all
other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. i think weâ€™ll shut
that window again, if you donâ€™t mind. it is a singular thing, but i find
that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. i have
not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is
the logical outcome of my convictions.

 have you turned the case over in
your mind?â€

â€œyes, i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.â€

â€œwhat do you make of it?â€

â€œit is very bewildering.â€

â€œit has certainly a character of its own. there are points of
distinction about it. that change in the footprints, for example. what
do you make of that?â€

â€œmortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
the alley.â€

â€œhe only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. why should a
man walk on tiptoe down the alley?â€

â€œwhat then?â€

â€œhe was running, watson--running desperately, running for his life,
running until he burst his heart--and fell dead upon his face.â€

â€œrunning from what?â€

â€œthere lies our problem. there are indications that the man was crazed
with fear before ever he began to run.â€

â€œhow can you

gipsyâ€™s evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help in the
direction where help was least likely to be. then, again, whom was he
waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the yew alley
rather than in his own house?â€

â€œyou think that he was waiting for someone?â€

â€œthe man was elderly and infirm. we can understand his taking an evening
stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. is it natural
that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as dr. mortimer, with more
practical sense than i should have given him credit for, deduced from
the cigar ash?â€

â€œbut he went out every evening.â€

â€œi think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening. on
the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. that night he
waited there. it was the night before he made his departure for london.
the thing takes shape, watson. it becomes coherent. might i ask you to

chapter 4. sir henry baskerville



our breakfast table was cleared early, and holmes waited in his
dressing-gown for the promised interview. our clients were punctual to
their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when dr. mortimer
was shown up, followed by the young baronet. the latter was a small,
alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,
with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. he wore a
ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who
has spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something
in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated
the gentleman.

â€œthis is sir henry baskerville,â€ said dr. mortimer.

 which reached me this
morning.â€

he laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. it was of
common quality, grayish in colour. the address, â€œsir henry baskerville,
northumberland hotel,â€ was printed in rough characters; the post-mark
â€œcharing cross,â€ and the date of posting the preceding evening.

â€œwho knew that you were going to the northumberland hotel?â€ asked
holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

â€œno one could have known. we only decided after i met dr. mortimer.â€

â€œbut dr. mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?â€

â€œno, i had been staying with a friend,â€ said the doctor.

â€œthere was no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.â€

â€œhum! someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.â€ out
of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into four.
this he opened and spread flat upon the table. across the middle of it
a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting printed

rds upon it. it ran:

the word â€œmoorâ€ only was printed in ink.

â€œnow,â€ said sir henry baskerville, â€œperhaps you will tell me, mr.
holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes
so much interest in my affairs?â€

â€œwhat do you make of it, dr. mortimer? you must allow that there is
nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?â€

â€œno, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
that the business is supernatural.â€

â€œwhat business?â€ asked sir henry sharply. â€œit seems to me that all you
gentlemen know a great deal more than i do about my own affairs.â€

â€œyou shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, sir henry. i
promise you that,â€ said sherlock holmes. â€œwe will confine ourselves

     country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower the
     general conditions of life in this island.â€™

â€œwhat do you think of that, watson?â€ cried holmes in high glee, rubbing
his hands together with satisfaction. â€œdonâ€™t you think that is an
admirable sentiment?â€

dr. mortimer looked at holmes with an air of professional interest, and
sir henry baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

â€œi donâ€™t know much about the tariff and things of that kind,â€ said he,
â€œbut it seems to me weâ€™ve got a bit off the trail so far as that note is
concerned.â€

â€œon the contrary, i think we are particularly hot upon the trail, sir

â€œby thunder, youâ€™re right! well, if that isnâ€™t smart!â€ cried sir henry.

â€œif any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that â€˜keep

â€œwell, now--so it is!â€

â€œreally, mr. holmes, this exceeds anything which i could have imagined,â€
 said dr. mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. â€œi could understand
anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper; but that you should
name which, and add that it came from the leading article, is really one
of the most remarkable things which i have ever known. how did you do
it?â€

â€œi presume, doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from that
of an esquimau?â€

â€œmost certainly.â€

â€œbut how?â€

â€œbecause that is my special hobby. the differences are obvious. the

on the part of the cutter. on the whole i incline
to the latter view, since the matter was evidently important, and it
is unlikely that the composer of such a letter would be careless. if he
were in a hurry it opens up the interesting question why he should be
in a hurry, since any letter posted up to early morning would reach
sir henry before he would leave his hotel. did the composer fear an
interruption--and from whom?â€

â€œwe are coming now rather into the region of guesswork,â€ said dr.
mortimer.

â€œsay, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and choose
the most likely. it is the scientific use of the imagination, but we
have always some material basis on which to start our speculation. now,
you would call it a guess, no doubt, but i am almost certain that this
address has been written in a hotel.â€

â€œhow in the world can you say that?â€

â€œif you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the ink
have given the writer trouble. the pen has spluttered

ing else to report to us before we
go into this matter?â€

â€œwell, it depends upon what you think worth reporting.â€

â€œi think anything out of the ordinary routine of life well worth
reporting.â€

sir henry smiled. â€œi donâ€™t know much of british life yet, for i have
spent nearly all my time in the states and in canada. but i hope that to
lose one of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over
here.â€

â€œyou have lost one of your boots?â€

â€œmy dear sir,â€ cried dr. mortimer, â€œit is only mislaid. you will find
it when you return to the hotel. what is the use of troubling mr. holmes
with trifles of this kind?â€

â€œwell, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.â€

â€œexactly,â€ said holmes, â€œhowever foolish the incident may seem. you have
lost one of your boots, you say?â€

â€œwell, mislaid it, anyhow. i put them both outside my door last night,
and there was only one in the morning. i could get no sense out of the
chap who cleans them. the wor

st of it is that i only bought the pair
last night in the strand, and i have never had them on.â€

â€œif you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?â€

â€œthey were tan boots and had never been varnished. that was why i put
them out.â€

â€œthen i understand that on your arrival in london yesterday you went out
at once and bought a pair of boots?â€

â€œi did a good deal of shopping. dr. mortimer here went round with me.
you see, if i am to be squire down there i must dress the part, and
it may be that i have got a little careless in my ways out west. among
other things i bought these brown boots--gave six dollars for them--and
had one stolen before ever i had them on my feet.â€

â€œit seems a singularly useless thing to steal,â€ said sherlock holmes.
â€œi confess that i share dr. mortimerâ€™s belief that it will not be long
before the missing boot is found.â€

â€œand, now, gentlemen

,â€ said the baronet with decision, â€œit seems to me
that i have spoken quite enough about the little that i know. it is time
that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we are all
driving at.â€

â€œyour request is a very reasonable one,â€ holmes answered. â€œdr. mortimer,
i think you could not do better than to tell your story as you told it
to us.â€

thus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket
and presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before.
sir henry baskerville listened with the deepest attention and with an
occasional exclamation of surprise.

he when the long narrative was finished. â€œof course, iâ€™ve heard of the

though i never thought of taking it seriously before. but as to my
uncleâ€™s death--well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and i canâ€™t
get it clear yet. you donâ€™t seem quite to have made up your mind whether
itâ€™s a case for a policeman or a clergyman.â€

â€œprecisely.â€

â€œand now thereâ€™s this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. i suppose
that fits into its place.â€

â€œit seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on
upon the moor,â€ said dr. mortimer.

â€œand also,â€ said holmes, â€œthat someone is not ill-disposed towards you,
since they warn you of danger.â€

â€œor it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me away.â€

â€œwell, of course, that is possible also. i am very much indebted to you,
dr. mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents several
interesting alternatives. but the practical point which we now have to
decide, sir henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you to go to
baskerville hall.â

with pleasure,â€ said his companion.

â€œthen we meet again at two oâ€™clock. au revoir, and good-morning!â€

we heard the steps of our visitors descend the stair and the bang of the
front door. in an instant holmes had changed from the languid dreamer to
the man of action.

â€œyour hat and boots, watson, quick! not a moment to lose!â€ he rushed
into his room in his dressing-gown and was back again in a few seconds
in a frock-coat. we hurried together down the stairs and into the
street. dr. mortimer and baskerville were still visible about two
hundred yards ahead of us in the direction of oxford street.

â€œshall i run on and stop them?â€

â€œnot for the world, my dear watson. i am perfectly satisfied with your
company if you will tolerate mine. our friends are wise, for it is
certainly a very fine morning for a walk.â€

he quickened his pace until we had decreased the distance which divided
us by about half. then, still keeping a hundred yards behind, we
followed into oxford street and

â€œi have not an idea.â€

â€œa spy?â€

â€œwell, it was evident from what we have heard that baskerville has been
very closely shadowed by someone since he has been in town. how else
could it be known so quickly that it was the northumberland hotel which
he had chosen? if they had followed him the first day i argued that they
would follow him also the second. you may have observed that i twice
strolled over to the window while dr. mortimer was reading his legend.â€

â€œyes, i remember.â€

â€œi was looking out for loiterers in the street, but i saw none. we
are dealing with a clever man, watson. this matter cuts very deep, and
though i have not finally made up my mind whether it is a benevolent or
a malevolent agency which is in touch with us, i am conscious always of
power and design. when our friends left i at once followed them in the
hopes of marking down their invisible attendant. so wily was he that he

had followed baskerville home we should have had the opportunity of
playing his own game upon himself and seeing where he made for. as
it is, by an indiscreet eagerness, which was taken advantage of with
extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have betrayed
ourselves and lost our man.â€

we had been sauntering slowly down regent street during this
conversation, and dr. mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in
front of us.

â€œthere is no object in our following them,â€ said holmes. â€œthe shadow has
departed and will not return. we must see what further cards we have
in our hands and play them with decision. could you swear to that manâ€™s
face within the cab?â€

â€œi could swear only to the beard.â€

â€œand so could i--from which i gather that in all probability it was
a false one. a clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a

intentions.

â€œto go to baskerville hall.â€

â€œand when?â€

â€œat the end of the week.â€

â€œon the whole,â€ said holmes, â€œi think that your decision is a wise one.
i have ample evidence that you are being dogged in london, and amid the
millions of this great city it is difficult to discover who these people
are or what their object can be. if their intentions are evil they might
do you a mischief, and we should be powerless to prevent it. you did not
know, dr. mortimer, that you were followed this morning from my house?â€

dr. mortimer started violently. â€œfollowed! by whom?â€

â€œthat, unfortunately, is what i cannot tell you. have you among your
neighbours or acquaintances on dartmoor any man with a black, full
beard?â€

â€œno--or, let me see--why, yes. barrymore, sir charlesâ€™s butler, is a man
with a full, black beard.â€

â€œha! where is barrymore?â€

â€œhe is in charge of the hall.â€

barrymore is at his post in devonshire or not.â€

â€œthatâ€™s so,â€ said baskerville. â€œby the way, dr. mortimer, who is this
barrymore, anyhow?â€

â€œhe is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. they have looked after
the hall for four generations now. so far as i know, he and his wife are
as respectable a couple as any in the county.â€

â€œat the same time,â€ said baskerville, â€œitâ€™s clear enough that so long as
there are none of the family at the hall these people have a mighty fine
home and nothing to do.â€

â€œthat is true.â€

â€œhe and his wife had five hundred pounds each.â€

â€œha! did they know that they would receive this?â€

â€œyes; sir charles was very fond of talking about the provisions of his
will.â€

â€œthat is very interesting.â€

â€œi hope,â€ said dr. mortimer, â€œthat you do not look with suspicious eyes
upon everyone who received a legacy from sir charles, for i also had a
thousand pounds left to me.â€

â€œindeed! and anyone else?â€

â€œthere were many insignificant sums to individuals, and a large number
of public charities. the residue all went to sir henry.â€

â€œand how much was the residue?â€

â€œseven hundred and forty thousand pounds.â€

holmes raised his eyebrows in surprise. â€œi had no idea that so gigantic
a sum was involved,â€ sai

â€œsir charles had the reputation of being rich, but we did not know how
very rich he was until we came to examine his securities. the total
value of the estate was close on to a million.â€

â€œdear me! it is a stake for which a man might well play a desperate
game. and one more question, dr. mortimer. supposing that anything
happened to our young friend here--you will forgive the unpleasant
hypothesis!--who would inherit the estate?â€

â€œsince rodger baskerville, sir charlesâ€™s younger brother died unmarried,
the estate would descend to the desmonds, who are distant cousins. james
desmond is an elderly clergyman in westmoreland.â€

go together.â€

â€œquite so. well, sir henry, i am of one mind with you as to the
advisability of your going down to devonshire without delay. there is
only one provision which i must make. you certainly must not go alone.â€

â€œdr. mortimer returns with me.â€

â€œbut dr. mortimer has his practice to attend to, and his house is miles
away from yours. with all the goodwill in the world he may be unable to
help you. no, sir henry, you must take with you someone, a trusty man,
who will be always by your side.â€

â€œwould that suit dr. watson?â€

â€œperfectly.â€

â€œthen on saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at the
ten-thirty train from paddington.â€

we had risen to depart when baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and
diving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from
under a cabinet.

â€œmy missing boot!â€ he cried.

â€œmay all our difficulties vanish as easily!â€ said sherlock holmes.

â€œbut it is a very singular thing,â€ dr. mortimer remarked. â€œi searched
this room carefully before lunch.â€

â€œand so did i,â€ said baskerville. â€œevery inch of it.â€

â€œthere was certainly no boot in it then.â€

â€œin that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were
lunching.â€

the german was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter,
nor could any inquiry clear it up. another item had been added to that

chapter 6. baskerville hall



sir henry baskerville and dr. mortimer were ready upon the appointed
day, and we started as arranged for devonshire. mr. sherlock holmes
drove with me to the station and gave me his last parting injunctions
and advice.

â€œi will not bias your mind by suggesting theories or suspicions,
watson,â€ said he; â€œi wish you simply to report facts in the fullest
possible manner to me, and you can leave me to do the theorizing.â€

â€œwhat sort of facts?â€ i asked.

â€œanything which may seem to have a bearing however indirect upon the

â€œwould it not be well in the first place to get rid of this barrymore
couple?â€

â€œby no means. you could not make a greater mistake. if they are innocent
it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. no, no, we will
preserve them upon our list of suspects. then there is a groom at the
hall, if i remember right. there are two moorland farmers. there is our
friend dr. mortimer, whom i believe to be entirely honest, and there is
his wife, of whom we know nothing. there is this naturalist, stapleton,
and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.
there is mr. frankland, of lafter hall, who is also an unknown factor,
and there are one or two other neighbours. these are the folk who must
be your very special study.â€

â€œi will do my best.â€

â€œyes, i thought it as well to take them.â€

â€œmost certainly. keep

our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting
for us upon the platform.

â€œno, we have no news of any kind,â€ said dr. mortimer in answer to my
friendâ€™s questions. â€œi can swear to one thing, and that is that we
have not been shadowed during the last two days. we have never gone
out without keeping a sharp watch, and no one could have escaped our
notice.â€

â€œyou have always kept together, i presume?â€

â€œexcept yesterday afternoon. i usually give up one day to pure amusement
when i come to town, so i spent it at the museum of the college of
surgeons.â€

â€œand i went to look at the folk in the park,â€ said bas

some great misfortune will befall you if you do. did you get your other
boot?â€

â€œno, sir, it is gone forever.â€

â€œindeed. that is very interesting. well, good-bye,â€ he added as the
train began to glide down the platform. â€œbear in mind, sir henry, one of
the phrases in that queer old legend which dr. mortimer has read to us,
and avoid the moor in those hours of darkness when the powers of evil
are exalted.â€

i looked back at the platform when we had left it far behind and saw the
tall, austere figure of holmes standing motionless and gazing after us.

the journey was a swift and pleasant one, and i spent it in making the
more intimate acquaintance of my two companions and in playing with
dr. mortimerâ€™s spaniel. in a very few hours the brown earth had
become ruddy, the brick had changed to granit

spoke of a richer, if a damper, climate. young baskerville stared
eagerly out of the window and cried aloud with delight as he recognized
the familiar features of the devon scenery.

â€œiâ€™ve been over a good part of the world since i left it, dr. watson,â€
 said he; â€œbut i have never seen a place to compare with it.â€

â€œi never saw a devonshire man who did not swear by his county,â€ i
remarked.

â€œit depends upon the breed of men quite as much as on the county,â€ said
dr. mortimer. â€œa glance at our friend here reveals the rounded head of
the celt, which carries inside it the celtic enthusiasm and power
of attachment. poor sir charlesâ€™s head was of a very rare type, half
gaelic, half ivernian in its characteristics. but you were very young
when you last saw baskerville hall, were you not?â€

â€œi was a boy in my teens at the time of my fatherâ€™s death and had never
seen the hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the south coast.

moor.â€

â€œare you? then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first
sight of the moor,â€ said dr. mortimer, pointing out of the carriage
window.

over the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there
rose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged
summit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in
a dream. baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and i
read upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of
that strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long
and left their mark so deep. there he s

yellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we
passed. the rattle of our wheels died away as we drove through drifts of
rotting vegetation--sad gifts, as it seemed to me, for nature to throw
before the carriage of the returning heir of the baskervilles.

â€œhalloa!â€ cried dr. mortimer, â€œwhat is this?â€

a steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in
front of us. on the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue
upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle
poised ready over his forearm. he was watching the road along which we
travelled.

â€œwhat is this, perkins?â€ asked dr. mortimer.

our driver half turned in his seat. â€œthereâ€™s a convict escaped from
princetown, sir. heâ€™s been out three days now, and the warders

shone through heavy mullioned windows, and from the high
chimneys which rose from the steep, high-angled roof there sprang a
single black column of smoke.

â€œwelcome, sir henry! welcome to baskerville hall!â€

a tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of
the wagonette. the figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow
light of the hall. she came out and helped the man to hand down our
bags.

â€œyou donâ€™t mind my driving straight home, sir henry?â€ said dr. mortimer.
â€œmy wife is expecting me.â€

â€œsurely you will stay and have some dinner?â€

â€œno, i must go. i shall probably find some work awaiting me. i would
stay to show you over the house, but barrymore will be a better guide
than i. good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if i
can be of service.â€

the wheels died away down the drive while sir henry and i turned
into the hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. it was a fine

sir henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the
time was propitious for my excursion. it was a pleasant walk of four
miles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray
hamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and
the house of dr. mortimer, stood high above the rest. the postmaster,
who was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the
telegram.

â€œcertainly, sir,â€ said he, â€œi had the telegram delivered to mr.
barrymore exactly as directed.â€

â€œwho delivered it?â€

â€œmy boy here. james, you delivered that telegram to mr. barrymore at the
hall last week, did you not?â€

â€œyes, father, i delivered it.â€

no more complex case had come to him in all the long series of his
sensational investigations. i prayed, as i walked back along the gray,
lonely road, that my friend might soon be freed from his preoccupations
and able to come down to take this heavy burden of responsibility from
my shoulders.

suddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet
behind me and by a voice which called me by name. i turned, expecting to
see dr. mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing
me. he was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired
and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. a tin box for botanical specimens hung
over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his
hands.

â€œyou will, i am sure, excuse my presumption, dr. watson,â€ said he as he
came panting up to where i stood. â€œhere on the moor we are homely folk

the window of his surgery as you passed. as our road lay the same way i
thought that i would overtake you and introduce myself. i trust that sir
henry is none the worse for his journey?â€

â€œhe is very well, thank you.â€

man to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but i need

upon the imagination of sir charles, and i have no doubt that it led to
his tragic end.â€

â€œbut how?â€

â€œhis nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have
had a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. i fancy that he really
did see something of the kind upon that last night in the yew alley. i
feared that some disaster might occur, for i was very fond of the old
man, and i knew that his heart was weak.â€

â€œhow did you know that?â€

â€œmy friend mortimer told me.â€

â€œyou think, then, that some dog pursued sir charles, and that he died of
fright in consequence?â€

â€œhave you any better explanation?â€

â€œi have not come to any conclusion.â€

â€œhas mr. sherlock holmes?â€

the words took away my breath for an instant but a glance at the placid
face and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was
intended.

â€œit is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, dr. watson,â€
 said he. â€œthe records of your detective h

â€œi am afraid that i cannot answer that question.â€

â€œmay i ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?â€

attention.â€

he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got a prehistoric
skull which fills him with great joy. never was there such a
single-minded enthusiast as he! the stapletons came in afterwards, and
the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at sir henryâ€™s request to
show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. it is
a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped
hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. at the far end

kindly, good-natured person, and i
only mention him because you were particular that i should send some
description of the people who surround us. he is curiously employed
at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent
telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps
the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped
convict. if he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he intends to prosecute dr. mortimer for opening
a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the
neolithic skull in the barrow on long down. he helps to keep our lives
from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
needed.

and now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
stapletons, dr. mortimer, and frankland, of lafter hall, let me end on
that which is most important and tell you more about the barrymores, and
especially about the surprising development of last nig

actly the conditions of the family legend, and there
are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange
creature upon the moor. twice i have with my own ears heard the sound
which resembled the distant baying of a hound. it is incredible,
impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of
nature. a spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the
air with its howling is surely not to be thought of. stapleton may
fall in with such a superstition, and mortimer also, but if i have one
quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to
believe in such a thing. to do so would be to descend to the level of
these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must
needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.
holmes would not listen to such fancies, and i am his agent. but facts
are facts, and i have twice heard this crying upon the moor. suppose
that there were really some huge hound loose upon it;

low over the landscape, trailing in gray wreaths down the sides of the
fantastic hills. in the distant hollow on the left, half hidden by the
mist, the two thin towers of baskerville hall rose above the trees. they
were the only signs of human life which i could see, save only those
prehistoric huts which lay thickly upon the slopes of the hills. nowhere
was there any trace of that lonely man whom i had seen on the same spot
two nights before.

as i walked back i was overtaken by dr. mortimer driving in his dog-cart
over a rough moorland track which led from the outlying farmhouse of
foulmire. he has been very attentive to us, and hardly a day has passed
that he has not called at the hall to see how we were getting on. he
insisted upon my climbing into his dog-cart, and he gave me a lift
homeward. i found him much troubled over the disappearance of his little
spaniel. it had wandered on to the moor and had never come back. i
gave him such consolation as i might, but i thought of the

â€œby the way, mortimer,â€ said i as we jolted along the rough road, â€œi
suppose there are few people living within driving distance of this whom
you do not know?â€

â€œhardly any, i think.â€

â€œcan you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are l. l.?â€

he thought for a few minutes.

â€œno,â€ said he. â€œthere are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom
i canâ€™t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
initials are those. wait a bit though,â€ he added after a pause. â€œth

he wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but i managed to satisfy
his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. tomorrow morning i shall
find my way to coombe tracey, and if i can see this mrs. laura lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident in this chain of mysteries. i am certainly developing the
wisdom of the serpent, for when mortimer pressed his questions to an
inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type franklandâ€™s skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.
i have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing.

i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and
melancholy day. this was my conversation with barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which i can play in due time.

mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played e

 written to sir charles baskerville and made
an appointment with him at the very place and hour that he met his
death, the other that the lurking man upon the moor was to be found
among the stone huts upon the hillside. with these two facts in my
possession i felt that either my intelligence or my courage must be
deficient if i could not throw some further light upon these dark
places.

i had no opportunity to tell the baronet what i had learned about mrs.
lyons upon the evening before, for dr. mortimer remained with him at
cards until it was very late. at breakfast, however, i informed him
about my discovery and asked him whether he would care to accompany
me to coombe tracey. at first he was very eager to come, but on second
thoughts it seemed to both of us that if i went alone the results might
be better. the more formal we made the visit the less information we
might obtain. i left sir henry behind, therefore, not without some
prickings of conscience, and drove off upon my new quest.

it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
lifted. meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while
holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall. the story
of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took
the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had
loved. but the shock of the nightâ€™s adventures had shattered his nerves,
and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of
dr. mortimer. the two of them were destined to travel together round the
world before sir henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he
had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.

and now i come rapidly to the conclusion of this singular narrative, in
which i have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague
surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a
manner. on the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted

savage ally. a huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish
showed the position of an abandoned mine. beside it were the crumbling
remains of the cottages of the miners, driven away no doubt by the foul
reek of the surrounding swamp. in one of these a staple and chain with
a quantity of gnawed bones showed where the animal had been confined.
a skeleton with a tangle of brown hair adhering to it lay among the
debris.

will never see his pet again. well, i do not know that this place
contains any secret which we have not already fathomed. he could hide
his hound, but he could not hush its voice, and hence came those cries
which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. on an emergency he
could keep the hound in the out-house at merripit, but it was always a
risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end
of all his efforts, that he dared do it. this paste in the tin is no

red, was found six months later alive and married in new york.
my friend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended
a succession of difficult and important cases, so that i was able to
induce him to discuss the details of the baskerville mystery. i had
waited patiently for the opportunity for i was aware that he would never
permit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not
be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. sir
henry and dr. mortimer were, however, in london, on their way to that
long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his
shattered nerves. they had called upon us that very afternoon, so that
it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.

â€œthe whole course of events,â€ said holmes, â€œfrom the point of view of
the man who called himself stapleton was simple and direct, although
to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of
his actions and could only learn part o

state, and he was ready to use any tool
or run any risk for that end. his first act was to establish himself as
near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate
a friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbours.

â€œthe baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared
the way for his own death. stapleton, as i will continue to call him,
knew that the old manâ€™s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.
so much he had learned from dr. mortimer. he had heard also that sir
charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.
his ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could
be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the
guilt to the real murderer.

â€œhaving conceived the idea he proceeded to carry it out with
considerable finesse. an ordinary schemer would have been content
to work with a savage hound. the use of artificial means to make the
creature diabolical was a f

fficulties through the chance that sir
charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister
of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, mrs. laura lyons.
by representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence
over her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her
obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. his plans were
suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that sir charles was about
to leave the hall on the advice of dr. mortimer, with whose opinion he
himself pretended to coincide. he must act at once, or his victim might
get beyond his power. he therefore put pressure upon mrs. lyons to
write this letter, imploring the old man to give her an interview on
the evening before his departure for london. he then, by a specious
argument, prevented her from going, and so had the chance for which he
had waited.

â€œdriving back in the evening from coombe tracey he was in time to get

ul sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws
and blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. he fell dead at the end
of the alley from heart disease and terror. the hound had kept upon the
grassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track
but the manâ€™s was visible. on seeing him lying still the creature had
probably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned
away again. it was then that it left the print which was actually
observed by dr. mortimer. the hound was called off and hurried away to
its lair in the grimpen mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled
the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope of our observation.

â€œso much for the death of sir charles baskerville. you perceive the
devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make
a case against the real murderer. his only accomplice was one who could
never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature o

of the hound.
mrs. lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the
death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only
known to him. however, both of them were under his influence, and he had
nothing to fear from them. the first half of his task was successfully
accomplished but the more difficult still remained.

â€œit is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir
in canada. in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr.
mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of
henry baskerville. stapletonâ€™s first idea was that this young stranger
from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming
down to devonshire at all. he distrusted his wife ever since she had
refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not
leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence
over her. it was for this reason that he took her to london with him.

which was actually one of those called upon by my agent in search
of evidence. here he kept his wife imprisoned in her room while
he, disguised in a beard, followed dr. mortimer to baker street and
afterwards to the station and to the northumberland hotel. his wife had
some inkling of his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband--a
fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write to warn
the man whom she knew to be in danger. if the letter should fall into
stapletonâ€™s hands her own life would not be safe. eventually, as we
know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would
form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguise

 did so, and at the cost of a
severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and
driving stapleton to his destruction. that sir henry should have been
exposed to this is, i must confess, a reproach to my management of the
case, but we had no means of foreseeing the terrible and paralyzing
spectacle which the beast presented, nor could we predict the fog which
enabled him to burst upon us at such short notice. we succeeded in our
object at a cost which both the specialist and dr. mortimer assure me
will be a temporary one. a long journey may enable our friend to recover
not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings.
his love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part
of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.

â€œit only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.
there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her
which may have been love or may have been fear, or very p
