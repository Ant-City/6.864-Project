d to have braces on
their teeth. one girl, mary lou finney, said the most peculiar things, like out
of the blue she would say, 'omnipotent!' or 'beef brain!' i couldn't make any
sense of it. there were japanese twins (a brother and sister), who didn't
speak at all except to say 'yes, yes,' and 'yes, yes.' there were megan and
christy who jumped up and down like parched peas, moody beth ann, and
pink-cheeked alex. there was ben who drew cartoons all day long, and a
most peculiar teacher named mr. birkway.

   and then there was phoebe winterbottom. ben called her 'free-bee ice
bottom' and drew a picture of a bumble-bee with an ice cube on its bottom.
phoebe tore it up.

   phoebe was a quiet girl. she stayed mostly by herself and seemed quite
shy. she had the most pleasant face and huge, enormous sky-blue eyes.
around this pleasant round face, her hair curled in short ringlets as yellow as
a crow's foot.

   during that first week, when my father and i were at margaret's (we ate
dinner there th

   'i like your hair,' he said to me. 'can you sit on it?'

   'yes, if i want.'

   ben picked up a piece of paper from mary lou's desk, lay back down on
the bed and started drawing.

   mary lou asked phoebe what she had written in her journal. 'nothing
much,' phoebe said. the journals were a big topic of conversation at school.
at the end of the last school year, apparently, their english teacher asked
each of them to keep a journal for the summer. they had to turn these in to
mr. birkway, the new english teacher, on the first day of school. now
every- one seemed enormously curious as to what everyone else had written.
i was relieved that i had not had to submit one, since i was new at the school
and didn't know about the journal assignment.

   ben said, 'want to see?' and he held his drawing over the edge of the bed.
it was a picture of two figures. one was a lizard-like creature with long
black hair that, as it ran down the lizard's back and under its bottom, became

   gramps always ends this story by saying, 'that bed has been around my
whole entire life, and i'm going to die in that bed, and then that bed will
know every- thing there is to know about me.'

   so, each night on our trip out to idaho, gramps patted the bed in the motel
and said, 'well, this ain't our marriage bed, but it will do,' while i lay in the
next bed wondering if i would ever have a marriage bed like theirs.


13. bouncing birkway


   it was time to tell gram and gramps about mr. birkway.

   mr. birkway was mighty strange. he was an english teacher, and when i
met him on that first day in my new school, i didn't know what to make of
him. i thought he might have a few squirrels in the attic of his brain. he was
one of those energetic teachers who loved his subject half to death and
leaped about the room dramatically, waving his arms and clutching his chest
and patting people on the back.

   he said, 'brilliant!' and 'w
 
 ___________________________
 
onderful!' and 'terrific!' he was quite tall and
slim, and his bushy black hair made him look like a wild native at times, but
he had enormous deep brown cow like eyes that sparkled all over the place
(like ben's), and when he turned these eyes on you, you felt as if his whole
purpose in life was to stand there and listen to you, and you alone.

   midway through the first class, mr. birkway asked if we had our summer
journals. i hadn't a clue as to what he was talking about. some of the other
students started nodding like crazy, and mr. birkway spread out his arms
and said, 'wonderful! i'm blessed!' he flung himself up and down the aisles,
receiving the journals as if they were manna from heaven. 'thank you,' he
said to each journal-giver.

   i was extensively worried. i had no journal.

   on top of mary lou finney's desk were six journals. six. mr. birkway
said. 'heavens. mercy

. is it - can it be - shakespeare?' he counted the
journals. 'six! brilliant! magnificent!'


   christy and megan. two girls who had their own club called the ggp
(whatever that meant), were whispering over on the other side of the room
and casting malevolent looks in mary lou's direction. mary lou kept her
hand on top of the journals as mr. birkway reached for them. in a low voice
she said. 'i don't want you to read them.'

   'what?' mr. birkway boomed. 'not read them?' the whole room was
silent. mr. birkway scooped up mary lou's journals before she could even
blink. he said, 'don't worry, your thoughts are safe with me. brilliant!
thank you!'

   another girl, beth ann, looked as if she might cry. phoebe was sending
me little messages with her eye- brows that indicated that she was not too
pleased either. i think they were all hoping that mr. birkway was not
actually going to read these journals.

   mr. birkway went around the whole

room snatching people's journals.
alex cheevey's journal was covered with basketball stickers. christy's and
megan's were slathered over with pictures of male models. the cover of
ben's was a cartoon of a boy with a normal boy's head, but the arms and legs
were pencils, and out of the tips of the hands and feet were little bits of
words

   when he got to phoebe's desk, mr. birkway lifted up her plain journal and
peeked inside. phoebe was trying to slide down in her chair. 'i didn't write
much,' phoebe said. 'in fact. i can hardly remember what i wrote about at all.
mr. birkway only said, 'beautiful! and moved on.

   by the time he got to my desk, my heart was clobbering around so hard i
thought it might leap straight out of my chest.

   'deprived child,' he said. 'you didn't have a chance to write a journal.'

   'i'm new-'

   'new? how blessed,' he said. 'there's not

that is better than a new person!'

   'so, i didn't know about the journals--'


   'not to worry!' mr. birkway said. 'i'll think of something.'

   i wasn't sure what that meant. i thought maybe he would give me a whole
lot of extra homework or something. for the rest of the day you could see
little groups of people asking each other, 'did you write about me?' i was
very glad i hadn't written anything.

   after school, phoebe and i walked home with mary lou and ben, who
were excited about mr. birkway. 'isn't he terrific?' they said. at the corner of
my street, as i turned to leave, ben said to phoebe,

her house. then she sheared off the tops
of the hedge, which borders phoebe's yard. she moved on to a rhododendron
bush, which she was poking and prodding when a car pulled into her
driveway. a tall man with bushy black hair leaped out and, seeing her, he
practically skipped back to where she was. they hugged each other.

   'oh, no,' phoebe said. the man with the bushy black hair was mr.
birkway, our english teacher.

   mrs. cadaver pointed to the rhododendron bush and then at the axe, but
mr. birkway shook his head. he disappeared into the garage and returned
with two shovels then he and mrs. cadaver gouged and prodded and
tunnelled around in the dirt until the poor old rhododendron hopped onto its
side. mrs. cadaver and mr. birkway lugged the bush over to the opposite
side of the yard where there was a mound of dirt.

   phoebe's doorbell rang. 'come with me,' phoebe said.

   'but, i want to watch mrs. cadaver and mr. birkway.

   'i'm not answering the door alone,' phoebe said.

   i wen

t with her. we looked out the window.

   'no one's there,' i said.

   'we're not supposed to open the door.

   'but, no one's there.' 1 said. i flung open the door. no one was on the
porch. i put one foot on the porch and looked up and down the street.


   'quick!' phoebe said. 'get back in here! maybe someone is in the bushes'

   i pulled my foot back inside. we closed the door and locked it. by the time
we returned to phoebe's bedroom window, mrs. cadaver and mr. birkway
had re-planted the bush.

   'maybe there is something hidden under the bush, phoebe said.

   'like what?'

   'like a dead body. maybe mr. birkway helped her chop up her husband
and bury him and maybe they were getting worried and decided to disguise
the spot with a rhododendron bush.'

   i must have looked skeptical. phoebe said, 'sal, you never can tell. and,
sal, i don't think you or your father should go over there any more.'

   i certainly agreed with her on that one. dad and i had bee

gn.


   i listened for another few minutes to the tree in the hospital parking lot,
and then climbed in the car.

   as we swept on across south dakota toward the badlands, the whispers no
longer said, hurry, hurry or, rush, rush. they now said, slow down, slow
down. i could not figure this out. it seemed some sort of warning, but i did
not have too much time to think about it as i was busy talking about phoebe.



17. in the course of a lifetime


   a few days after phoebe and i had seen mr. birkway and mrs. cadaver
whacking away at the rhododendron, i walked home with phoebe after
school. she was as crotchety and sullen as a three-legged mule, and i was
not quite sure why. she had been asking me why i had not said anything to
my father about mrs. cadaver and mr. birkway, and i told her that i was
waiting for the right time.

   'your father was over there, yesterday,' phoebe said. 'i saw him. he'd
better watch out.'

   the truth is, i was getting worried. i promised myself that i would s

19. fish in the air


   gram said, 'where did we leave off with peeby? what was happening?'

   'what's the matter, gooseberry?' gramps said. 'did that snake bite your
brains?'

   'no,' she said. 'it did not bite my brains i was just trying to refresh my
memory.

   'let's see,' gramps said. 'mr. birkway and mrs. cadaver were whacking a
rhododendron, and they put it over the dead body, and then peeby's mother
burned the brownies--'

   gram said, 'and peeby and her sister were acting like spoiled chitlins, and
they got another message: "in the course of a lifetime, what does it matter?"
i like that message.

   gramps said, 'and didn't peeby want you to tell your daddy about mrs.
cadaver and mr. birkway hacking up her husband?'

   yes, that is what phoebe wanted, and it is what i tried to do. 
 
 ___________________________
 
y father, all those things that phoebe had said about mrs. cadaver seemed
foolish.

   'i'd like to explain about her,' my father said.

   'oh, never mind. just forget i mentioned her. i don't need any explanations'

   later, when i was doing my homework, i found myself doodling in the
margin of my english book. i had drawn a figure of a woman with wild hair
and evil eyes and a rope around her neck. i drew a tree, fastened the rope to
it, and hung her.

   the next day at school, i studied mr. birkway as he leaped and cavorted
about the classroom. if he was a murderer, he certainly was a lively one. i
had always pictured murderers as being mopey and sullen. i hoped mr.
birkway was in love with margaret cadaver and would marry her and take
her away so that my father and i could go back to bybanks

   what i found most surprising about mr. birkway was that he increasingly
reminded me of my mother - or. at least, of my mother before the sadness set
in. there was a liveliness to both mr. birkway
 
 ___________________________
 
 and my mother. and an
excitement - a passion - for words and for stories

   that day, mr. birkway talked about creek mythology and how exciting
and thrilling it was going to be to have the opportunity to study a slew of
wonderful creek stories. when mr. birkway passed out the new books, he
said, 'don't you love the smell of a new book?' and, 'treat them gently,
gently.' and, 'what treasures lie within.


   in the midst of this, i started day-dreaming about my mother, who loved
books almost as much as she loved all her outdoor treasures she liked to
carry little books in her pocket and sometimes when we were out in the
fields, she would flop down in the grass and start reading aloud.

   my mother especially liked native american (she said 'indian')

stories.
she knew legends from many tribes: navaho, sioux, seneca, net perce,
maidu, blackfoot, huron. she knew about thunder gods, earth makers, wise
crows, sly coyotes, and shadow souls her favourite stories were those about
people who came back, after death, as a bird or a river or a horse. she even
knew one story about an old warrior who came back as a potato.

   the next thing i knew, mr. birkway was saying, 'right phoebe? phoebe?
are you awake? you have the second report.

   'report?' phoebe said.

   'lucky you! we're letting you go second!'

   'report?'

   mr. birkway clutched his heart and said to the class, 'apparently, miss
phoebe winterbottom did not hear me explain about the reports perhaps you
can enlighten her, mr. finney.

   ben turned slowly around in his chair and cast his sparkling black eyes in
phoebe's direction. he said, 'i'm doing an oral report on prometheus this

friday. you're doing one on pandora next monday.'

   'lucky me,' phoebe muttered. mr. birkway asked me to stay after class for
a minute. phoebe sent me warning messages with her eyebrows. as
everyone else was leaving the room, phoebe said, 'i'll stay with you if you
want.'

   'why?'

   'because, sal, because.'

   'because of what?' i said.


   'because of him hacking up mr. cadaver, that's what. i don't think you
should be alone with him.'

   he did not hack me up. instead, he gave me a special assignment, a 'mini
journal'.

   'i don't know what that is,' i said. phoebe was breat

mr. birkway said i should write about something that interested me. 'like
what?' i said.

   'heavens!' he said. 'i don't know what interests you. anything you like.
anything at all.'

   phoebe said, 'could she write about murderers?'

   mr. birkway said, 'goodness! is that something that interests you, sal? or
is it something that interests you, phoebe?'

   'oh, no, sir,' phoebe said.

   'i think.' mr. birkway said, 'you should keep it more simple. write about
something you like  - a place, a room. a person - don't worry about it too
much. just write whatever comes to mind.'

   phoebe and i walked home with mary lou and ben. my brain was a mess,
what with trying not to flinch whenever ben brushed against me. when we
left ben and mary lou and turned the corner into phoebe's street, i wasn't
paying much attention. i suppose i was aware that someone was coming
along the sidewalk in our direction, but i

think she was more scared than
we were. she went around locking all the doors.

   nothing more happened that evening and, by the time i went home, the
lunatic did not seem quite so threatening. no one called the police, and, to
my knowledge, mrs. winterbottom had not yet told mr. winterbottom.
right before i left phoebe's house, phoebe said to me, 'if i see the lunatic
once more, i will phone the police myself'


20. the blackberry kiss


   that night, i tried to write the mini journal for mr. birkway. i had a
terrible time coming up with some- thing to write about. first, i made a list
of all the things i liked, and they were all things from bybanks - the trees,
the cows, the chickens, the pigs, the fields, the swimming hole. it was a
complete jumble of things, and when i tried to write about any one of those

things, i ended up writing about my mother, because everything was
connected to her. at last, 1 wrote about the black- berry kiss.

   one morning, on the farm, when i awoke and look
 
 ___________________________
 
ssed it firmly. to this day, i can smell the smell of the bark - a sweet,
woody smell - and feel its ridges, and taste that distinctive taste on my lips

   in my mini journal, i confessed that i had since kissed all different kinds of
trees, and each family of trees - oaks, maples, elms, birches - had a special
flavour all of its own. mixed in with each tree's own taste was the slight tang
of blackberries, and why this was so, i could not explain.

   the next day, i turned in this story to mr. birkway. he didn't read it or
even look at it, but he said, 'marvelous! brilliant!' as he slipped it into his
briefcase. 'i'll put it with the other journals'


   phoebe said, 'did you write about me?'

   ben said, 'did you write about me?'

   mr. birkway was bounding around the room as if the opportunity to teach
us was his notion of paradise. he threw open the windows and sucked in the
air. 'ah, september,' he said. he pulled out a book and read a poem by e. e,
cummings. the poem was titled 'the

and everything would be exactly as it used to

21. souls


   at school, the next day, phoebe wore a fixed expression: a sealed, thin
smile. it must have been difficult for her to maintain that smile, because by
the time english class came around, her chin was quivering from the strain.
she was extremely quiet all day. she didn't speak to anyone but me, and the
only thing she said to me was, 'stay at my house tomorrow night.' it wasn't a
question; it was a command.

   in english class, mr. birkway gave us a fifteen-second exercise. as fast as
we could, without thinking, we were to draw something. he would tell us
what we were to draw when everyone was ready. 'remember,' he said. 'don't
think. just draw. fifteen seconds. ready? draw your soul. go.'

   we all wasted five seconds staring blankly at him. when we saw that he
was serious and was watching the clock, our pencils hit the paper. i wasn't
thinking. there wasn't time to think.

   when mr. birkway called 'stop!', everyone looked up
 
 ___________________________
 
 with a dazed
blankness. then, we looked down at our papers a buzz went around the
room. we were surprised at what had come out of our pencils.

   mr. birkway was already zipping around, scooping up the papers. he
shuffled them and began tacking them up on the bulletin board. he said, 'we
now have everyone's soul captured.` we all crowded around.

   the first thing i noticed was that every single person had drawn a central
shape - a heart, circle, square, or triangle. i thought that was unusual. i mean,
no one drew a bus or a spaceship or a cow - they all drew these same shapes.
next, i noticed that inside each figure was a distinct design. at first
 
 ___________________________
 
 i didn't
want to wake up in the morning, and i was afraid to go to sleep at night..

   by lunchtime, people were coming at phoebe in all directions. 'how long
will your mother be in london?' mary lou asked. 'is she having tea with the
queen?'

   'tell her to go to convent garden,' christy said. 'my mother just loves
convent garden.'

   'it's covent garden, cabbage-head,' mary lou said. 'it isn't,' christy said.
'i'm sure it's convent garden.

   by the time we reached english class, even mr. birkway had heard the
news. 'i hear your mother's in london, phoebe,' he said. 'london, ah,
london - the globe theatre, shakespeare, dickens, ah...


   after school, we walked home with ben and mary lou. phoebe wouldn't
say a word. 'whatsa matter, free bee?' ben asked. 'talk.'

   out of the blue. i said. 'everyone has his own agenda.' ben tripped over
the kerb, and mary lou gave me a peculiar look. i kept hoping that phoebe's
mother would be home. even though the door was locked, i kept hoping.
'are

ost wanted to say
was, 'no! she isn't in london!  she disappeared!  she's been kid- napped!
she might be dead!'

   it was like that all day. by english class, her mother had not only been on
a day-trip to stratford, but she had also managed to visit scotland, wales
and ireland, and had had a lovely tour on a hovercraft. 'my,' beth ann said,
'your mother sure has been busy.'


   christy was cowering in a corner .'it's a wasp, sal - get it. kill it!' as i
ushered the wasp to an open window, mr. birkway asked ben to begin his
prometheus report. ben had to sit at mr. birkway's desk, facing the entire
class he could not stare down at his notes, because mr. birkway kept
saying, 'eye contact!' which meant ben had to look everyone directly in their
eyeballs. it was part of being a good speaker, mr. birkway said.

   ben was nervous he explained that prometheus stole fire from the sun and
gave it to man. zeus, the chief's god, was angry at man and at prometheus
for taking some of his precious sun. a

   that night she phoned me. she was whispering again. she said, 'it seems
ever so quiet here. i don't know what is the matter with me. i was lying on
my bed and i can't sleep. my bed's too hard.'


28. pandora's box


   on monday, the day that phoebe was supposed to give her oral report on
pandora, she was a wreck. when mr. birkway bounded into the room,
phoebe said that her heart was hurting and asked if she could see the nurse.
mr. birkway said, 'why don't you get started with your report, and if you
still don't feel well in a few minutes, you can stop and go to the nurse.

   'i'm not malingering,' she said.

   'malingering! what a magnificent word!' mr. birkway said.

   phoebe was afraid of mr. birkway. she was completely convinced that he
was a murderer. her hands shook as she picked up her notes and walked to
the 
 
 ___________________________
 
 topic, pandora, when he did his report on prometheus.' she
seemed relieved that prometheus came out correctly, and not as porpoises.
'however, ben made a few little mistakes about pandora.

   everyone turned around to stare at ben. 'i did not,' he said.

   'yes you did.' phoebe said. her lip trembled. 'as i was saying, ben made a
few tiny, little mistakes about pandora. pandora was not sent to man as a
punishment, but as a reward--'

   'was not,' ben said.

   'was too,' phoebe said.

   mr. birkway said, 'phoebe, if you please ...?'

   'as i was saying,' phoebe continued, 'zeus decided to give man a lovely
present, since man seemed a little lonely down there on earth, with only the
animals to keep him company. so, zeus made a sweet and beautiful woman,
and then he invited all the gods to dinner. it was a very civilized dinner, with
matching plates.'

   mary lou and ben exchanged an eyebrow message.

   'at this civilized dinner, zeus asked the gods to give the beautiful woman
presents -

knew it,' ben said. 'i knew she was going to open the box the minute that
you said she was not supposed to open it.'

   misako raised her hand.

   phoebe sighed. 'do you have a question?'

   'what is in the box?'

   'as i was about to say, before ben interrupted me, inside the box were all
the evils in the world.'

   'what is evils?' shigeru asked.

   'as i was about to explain, inside the box were all the evils of the world
such as hatred, envy, plagues, sickness, cholesterol...


   mr. birkway scratched his head. he looked as if he might interrupt, but he
didn't.

   phoebe continued. 'there were brain tumours and sadness there were
lunatics and kidnapping and murders ...' she glanced at mr. birkway before
rushing on,'...and all that kind of thing. pandora tried to close the lid, she
really tried when she saw all the horrible things that were coming out of it,
but she could not get it closed in time, and that is why there are all these
evils in the world. there was only one good thin

g in the box.'

   'what was it?' ben asked.

   'as i was about to explain, the only good thing in the box was hope.'

   'what is hope?' shigeru said.

   'hope?' phoebe said. 'hm. hope is... hope. it's hoping that... hmm. hope is
a little hard to explain.'

   'try,' said mr. birkway.

   everyone was staring at phoebe. 'it is a feeling that - a wish that -
something good might happen, and that is why, even though there are many
evils in the world, there is still a little hope.' she held up a picture she had
copied from a book. it was a picture of pandora opening up the box and a
whole shebang of gremlins floating out. pandora looked extensively
frightened.

   on the way home, i said, 'you must have been nervous'

   'about what?' phoebe said.

   'about the report, phoebe

'by golly, that sounds about right to me.'


30. the tide rises


   'did peeby's mother call?' gram said. 'did she come home? did peeby
phone the police? oh, i hope this isn't a sad story,' she said.

   phoebe did go to the police. it was on the day that mr. birkway read us the
poem about the tide and the traveller - a poem that upset both me and
phoebe, and i think it is what convinced her, finally, that she had to tell the
police about her mother.

   mr. birkway leaped through the doorway in his usual style, waving his
arms and saying, 'what a day!' and, 'isn't life glorious?'

   phoebe leaned over to me and said, 'he's faking it. he doesn't want anyone
to know he is a filthy murderer.

   mr. birkway read a poem by mr. longfellow. it was called 'the t

ide
rises, 'the tide falls' over and over in the poem is the line, 'the tide rises,
the tide falls,' and, the way mr. birkway read this poem, you could actually
hear the tide rising and falling, rising and falling. in the poem, a traveller is
hurrying toward a town, and it is getting darker and darker, and the sea calls
to the traveller. then the waves 'with their soft, white hands' wash out the
traveller's footprints. the next morning,



the day returns, but nevermore
returns the traveller to the shore.
and the tide rises, the tide falls.


   mr. birkway asked people for their reactions to this poem. megan said tha

n ben's mouth. it was a shivery thing
to consider.

   i made it through the rest of my classes without losing control of my lips.
the day seemed to be returning to normal - until english class, that is. mr.
birkway came sailing into class carrying our journals i had forgotten all
about them. he was leaping all over the place exclaiming, 'dynamite!

unbelievable! incredible!' he said he couldn't wait to share the journals with
the class.

   mary lou finney said, 'share with the class?'

   mr. birkway said, 'not to worry! everyone has something magnificent to
say. i haven't read through every page yet, but i was so impressed that i
wanted to share some of these passages with you right away.'

   people were squirming all over the room. i was trying to remember what i
had written. mary lou leaned over to me and said, 'well, i'm not worried. i
wrote a special note in the front of mine distinctly asking him not to read
mine. mine was private.'

   mr. birkway smiled all around the room at each

us face. 'you needn't
worry,' he said. change any names that you've used, and in case some of you
are nervous about sharing your thoughts and observations, i will fold this
piece of yellow paper over the cover of whichever journal i am reading, so
that you cannot possibly know whose it is.'

   ben asked if he could go to the bathroom. christy said she felt a little sick
and asked if she could go to the nurse. phoebe asked me to touch her
forehead because she was pretty sure she had a fever. mr. birkway looked
all around the room. usually he would let people go to the bathroom or to
the nurse, but this time he said, 'let's not malinger!' he picked up a journal,
slipping the yellow paper over it before anyone had a chance to examine the
cover for clues as to its author's identity. everyone took a deep breath. you
could see people poised nervously, waiting as tensely as if mr. birkway was
going to announce someone's execution. mr. birkway read:

   i think that betty [he changed the name, you co
 
 ___________________________
 
uld tell, because there was
no betty in our school] will go to hell because she always takes the lord's
name in vain. she says 'god!' every five seconds.

   mary lou finney was turning purple. 'who wrote that?' she said. 'did you,
christy? i'll bet you did.'

   christy stared down at her desk.


   'i do not say "god!" every five seconds. i do not. and i am not going to
hell.'

   mr. birkway tried to intervene. 'excuse--'

   'omnipotent,' mary lou said. 'that's what i say now i say, omnipotent!
and alpha and omega!'

   mr. birkway was desperately trying to explain what he had enjoyed about
that passage. he said that most of us are not aware that we might be using
words such as 'god!' which offend other people. mary lou leaned over to
me and said, 'is he serious? does he actually really and truly believe that
beef-brained christy is troubled by my saying "god" (which i do not, by 
 
 ___________________________
 
the
way, say any more anyway)? omnipotent.

   christy was wearing a pious look on her face, as if god himself had just
come down from heaven to sit on her desk.

   mr. birkway quickly selected another journal. he flipped it open and read:

   linda [there was no linda in our class either] is my best friend. i tell her
just about everything, and she tells me evertthing, even things i do not
want to know, like what she ate for breakfast and what her father wears to
bed and how much her new sweater cost. sometimes things like that are just
not interesting.

   mr. birkway was saying how much he liked this passage because it
showed that even though someone might be our b

est friend, he or she could
still drive us crazy. beth ann turned ail the way around in her seat and sent
wicked eyebrow-messages to mary lou.

   mr. birkway flipped ahead in the same journal to another passage. he
read:

   i think jeremiah [there was certainly no jeremiah in our school] is pig-
headed ... his skin is always pink ... and his hair is always clean and shiny ...
but he is really a jerk.

   i thought mary lou finney was going to fall out of her chair. alex was
bright, bright pink. he looked at mary lou as if she had recently plunged a

red hot stake into his heart. mary lou said, 'no - i - no, it isn't what you
think-i--

   misako s

aid, 'what is jerk?' about twenty times

   mr. birkway tried to explain that he liked this pas- sage because it showed
conflicting feelings about someone.

   'i'll say it does,' alex said.

   the bell rang. first, you could hear sighs of relief from the people whose
journals had not been read, and then people started talking a mile a minute.
'hey, mary lou, look at alex's pink skin,' and 'hey mary lou, what does
beth ann's father wear to bed?'

   beth ann was standing about one inch away from mary lou's face. 'i do
not talk on and on,' beth am s

ver you're going?'

   'oh, no, it's much too far for these legs jimmy's coming. he'll be here any
minute.' mrs. partridge continued down the front walk. i was amazed that
she didn't fall. she stepped out so confidently, barely using her cane at all. a
car pulled up in front of the house.

   'there he is' she said. she called out to the driver, 'i'm redible. i said i
would be, and here i am.'

   the driver leaped out of the car. 'sal?' he said.'i had no idea you two were
neighbours' it was mr. birkway.

   'we're not neighbours: i said. 'it's phoebe, actually, who is the neighbor.

   'is that right?' he said. he opened the car door for mrs. partridge. 'come
on, mom,' he said. 'let's get a move on.'

   'mom?' i said. i looked at mrs. partridge. 'this is your son? you're his
mother?'

   'why, of course,' mrs. partridge said.' this is my little jimmy.'

   'but, he's a birkway….?'

   mrs. partridge said, 'i was a birkway once. then i was a partridge. i'm still
a partridge.'

   'then, who
 
 ___________________________
 
 is mrs. cadaver?' i said.

   'my little margie,' she said. 'she was a birkway, too. now she's a cadaver.


   i said to mr. birkway, 'mrs. cadaver is your sister?'

   'we're twins' mr. birkway said.

   'they're just alike,' mrs. partridge said.

   when they had driven away, i knocked at phoebe's door. i knocked and
knocked. there was no answer. at home, i dialed phoebe's number over and
over. no answer.

   the next day at school, i was relieved to see phoebe. 'where were you?' i
said. 'i phoned and phoned - i have something to tell you...

   she turned away. 'i don't want to talk about it,' she said.

   'but, phoebe--'

   'i do not wish to discuss it,' she said.

   i could not
 
 ___________________________
 
 figure out what on earth was the matter with her. it was a
terrible day. we had tests in maths and science. in french, our teacher
lectured us for the entire class period about how sloppy our work was. at
lunch, phoebe ignored me. then came english.

   mr. birkway skipped into the room. people were gnawing on their fingers
and tapping their feet and wriggling around and generally getting ulcers,
wondering if mr. birkway was going to read from the journals. i just kept
staring at him. he and margaret cadaver were twins? was that possible?
the most disappointing part of that piece of knowledge was that he was not
going to fall in love with mrs. cadaver and marry her and take her away.

   mr. birkway opened a cupboard, pulled out the journals, slipped the
yellow paper over the cover of one and read:

   this is what i like about jane. [there was no jane, of course. he was
substituting a name.] she is smart, but 
 
 ___________________________
 
doesn't act like she knows everything.
she is cute. she smells good. she is cute. she makes laugh. she is cute. she
is friendly. and, did i mention that she is cute?


   while mr. birkway was reading, i got a prickly feeling up and down my
arms. i was wondering if ben had written this about me, but then i realized
that ben didn't even know me when he wrote his journal. a little buzz was
going around the room as people shifted in their seats. christy was smiling,
megan was smiling, beth am was smiling, mary lou was smiling. every in
the room was smiling. each girl thought that this had been written about her.

   i looked carefully at each of the boys. alex was gazing nonchalantl

y at
mr. birkway, shigeru was asleep in the back row, others were doodling, and
then i saw ben. he was sitting with his hands over his ears, staring down at
his desk. the prickly feeling travelled all the way up to my neck and then
went skipping down my spine. he did write that, but he did not write it about
me.

   mr. birkway exclaimed, 'ah, love, ah, life!' sighing, he pulled out another
journal and read:

   jane doesn't know the first thing about boys. she once asked me what
kisses taste like, so you could tell she hadn't ever kissed anyone. i told her
that they taste like chicken, and she believed me. she is so dumb sometimes.

   mary lou finney almost jumped straight out of her chair. 'you cabbage
head.' she said to beth ann. 'you beef brain.' beth ann was winding a strand
of hair around and around and around 
 
 ___________________________
 
her finger. mary lou stood up. 'i did
not believe you, and i do too know what they taste like, and it isn't chicken.

   mr. birkway looked astonished at this outburst. ben drew a cartoon. it
showed two stick-figures kissing. in the air over their heads was a cartoon
bubble with a chicken inside. the chicken was saying, 'bawk, bawwwk,
bawwwk.'

   mr. birkway turned a few pages in the same journal and read:

   i hate doing this. i hate to write. i hate to read. i hate journals. i especially
hate english where teachers only talk about idiot symbols. i hate that idiot
poem about the snowy woods, and i hate it when people say the woods in
that poem symbolize death or beauty or sex or any old thing you want. i hate
that. maybe the woods are just woods.


   beth ann stood up and stared defiantly around the room. 'mr. birkway,'
she said, 'i hate this. 
 
 ___________________________
 
i do hate school, i do hate books, i do hate english, i do
hate symbols, and i most especially hate these idiot journals.'

   there was a hush in the room. mr. birkway stared at beth ann for a
minute, and in that minute, i was reminded of mrs. cadaver. for that brief
time, his eyes looked just like hers i was afraid he was going to strangle
beth ann, but then he smiled and his eyes became friendly enormous cow
eyes once again. i think he hypnotized her, because beth ann sat down very
slowly. mr. birkway said. 'beth ann, i know exactly how you feel. exactly.
i love this passage.'

   'you do?' she said.

   'it's so honest.'

   i had to admit, you couldn't ge
 
 ___________________________
 
t more honest than beth ann telling her
english teacher that she hated symbols and english and idiot journals.

   mr. birkway said, 'i used to feel exactly like this.'

   'you did?'

   mr. birkway said, 'i could not understand what all the fuss was about
symbols' he rummaged around in his desk. 'i want to show you something.'
he was pulling papers out and hinging them around. finally, he held up a
picture. 'ah, here it is. dynamite!' he held the picture in front of ben. 'what
is this?' he asked ben.

   ben said, 'it's a vase. obviously.'

   mr. birkway held the drawing in front of beth ann, who looked as if she
might cry. mr. birkway said, 'beth ann, what do you see?' a little tear
dro
 
 ___________________________
 
pped down on her cheek. 'it's ok, beth am,' mr. birkway said. 'what do
you see?'

   'i don't see any idiot vase,' she said. 'i see two people. they're looking at
each other.

   'right,' mr. birkway said. 'brave!'


   'i'm right?' beth ann said. 'brave?'

   ben said, 'huh? ~o people?' i was thinking the same thing myself what
two people?

   mr. birkway said to ben, 'and you were right, too. brave!' he asked
everyone else, 'how many see a vase?' about half the class raised their
hands 'and how many see two faces?' the rest of the class raised their hands

   then mr. birkway pointed out how you could see both. if you looked only
at the white part in the centre you could clearly see the vase. if you looked
only at the dark parts on the side, you could see two profiles. the curvy
sides of the vase became the outline of the two heads facing each

other.

   people were saying, 'wow', and 'neat', and 'man', and 'cool'. shigeru and
misako were giggling away, with their hands covering their mouths. 'yes,
yes' they said. 'yes, yes'

   mr. birkway said that the drawing was a bit like symbols. maybe the artist
only intended to draw a vase, and maybe some people look at this picture
and see only that vase. that's fine, but if some people look at it and see
faces, what is wrong with that? it is faces to that person who is looking at it.
and, what is even more magnificent, you might see both.

   beth ann said, ''two for your money?'

   'isn't it interesting,' mr. birkway said, 'to find both? isn't it interesting to
discover that snowy wood

s could be death and beauty and even, i suppose,
sex? wow! literature!'

   'did he say sex?' ben said. he copied the drawing into his notebook.

   i thought mr. birkway was finished with the journals for that day, but he
said, 'let me find one or two more selections i'll take one off the bottom. i
haven't read this far yet. i'll choose randomly.' he made a great show of
closing his eyes, and pulling something from near the bottom of the stack.
with his eyes still closed, he slipped the yellow paper over it, but it was too
late. i knew it was mine, because 1 had not written in a blue booklet as

everyone else had. mine was on plain notebook paper. i wanted to

die. mr.
birkway read:



she popped the blackberries into her mouth.

then she looked all around-


   i could hardly bear it. i wanted him to stop. he didn't. he read on:


she took two quick steps up to the maple tree

and threw her arms around it, and kissed it soundly.


   people were giggling. oh, how i wanted mr. birkway to stop, but he did
not. he went on:


... i thought i could detect a small dark stain,

as from a blackberry kiss.



   ben looked at me from across the room. after mr. birkway read about my
mother's blackberry kiss, he read about how i kissed the tree and how i have
kissed all different kinds of trees since then and how each tree has a special
taste, all its own, and mixed in with that taste is the taste of blackberries.

   by now, because both ben and phoebe were staring at me, everyone el

stared too. 'she kisses trees?' megan said. i might have died right then and
there, if mr. birkway had not immediately picked up another journal. he
stabbed his finger into the middle of the page and read:

   i am very concerned about mrs.-

   mr. birkway stared down at the page. it looked as if he couldn't quite read
the writing, or maybe he was just trying to think of a name to substitute for
the real one. he started again.

   i am very concerned about mrs.-

   again he stopped. he cleared his throat and tried once more.

   i am very concerned about mrs., uh, mrs. corpse.


   her suspicious behaviour suggests that she has murdered her own
husband--

   mr. birkway stopped. phoebe was sitting quite still, but her eyes blinked
rapidly.

   
 
 ___________________________
 
'go on,' ben said. 'finish!'

   you could tell that mr. birkway was regretting that he had ever started this
business with the journals, but all around the room people were shouting,
'yes, finish!' and so he reluctantly continued.

   i believe she has buried him in her garden; the bell rang. people were
going berserk.

   'wow. a murder. who wrote that?'

   'is it real?'

   i am sure they continued along those lines, but i did not stay to listen. i
was out of that room faster than anything, chasing after phoebe. i heard mr.-
birkway call phoebe's name, b

still awake in our frontier cabin on the edge
of yellowstone national park. 'aren't you sleepy yet?' i said.

   gram said, 'i don't know what's the matter with me. i don't feel like going
to sleep at all. i want to know what happened to peeby.

   gramps said, 'those journals sure caused a mess of trouble - almost as
much trouble as the egg man's letter.

   'it was the only love letter i ever got,' gram sighed. 'tell us more about
peeby, but don't make it too sad.'

   'i'll tell you about mr. birkway's visit. then i'll stop for tonight.'


   i went over to phoebe's after dinner, on the day mr. birkway had read
from my journal about the black- berry kisses and from phoebe's about mrs.
cadaver and the body. phoebe, prudence and her father were still at the
dinner table. prudence was rattling on and on about cheerleading. she was
clapping her hands and reciting a new cheer: 'two-four-six-eight, who do we
appreciate?'

   'phoebe, aren't you going to eat anything?' her father asked.

   'two-
 
 ___________________________
 
four-six... prudence punched the air.

   'let's go upstairs,' phoebe said.

   in phoebe's bedroom, i said, 'i've got two important things to tell you--'

   the doorbell rang. phoebe said, 'shh.' we listened. 'that sounds like mr.
birkway.

   'that's one of the things i want to tell you,' i said. 'about mr. birkway--

   there was a tap on phoebe's door. her father said, 'phoebe? could you
come downstairs with me? sal, maybe you should come too.'

   i thought mr. birkway was going to be extensively angry at phoebe for
what she had written about his sister. the worst thing was that phoebe didn't
even know yet that mrs. cadaver was mr. birkway's sister. i felt like we
were lambs being led to the slaughter. take us, i thought. take us, and do
away with us quickly. we followed phoebe's father downstairs. there, on
the sofa, was mr. birkway, holding phoebe's journal and looking
embarrassed.

   'that is my own private journal,' phoebe said.

   mr. birkway nodded. '
 
 ___________________________
 
i know.' 'with my own private thoughts'

   'i know,' mr. birkway repeated, 'and i want to apologize for reading it
aloud.'


   apologize? that was a relief it was so quiet in the room that i could hear
the leaves being blown off the trees outside.

   mr. birkway coughed. 'i want to explain something,' he said. 'mrs.
cadaver is my sister.

   'your sister?' phoebe said.

   'and her husband is dead.'

   'i thought so,' phoebe said.

   'but, she didn't murder him,' mr. birkway said. 'her husband died when a
drunk driver rammed into his car. my mother - mrs. partridge - was also in
the car with mr. cadaver. she didn't die, as you know, but she lost her sight.

   'oh--' i said. phoebe stared at the floor.

   'my sister margaret was the nurse on duty in the emergency room when
they brought in her husband and our mother. margaret's husband died that
night.'

   the whole time mr. birkway was talking, phoebe's father was sitting
beside her with his hand resting on her s

houlder. it looked like the only thing
that was keeping phoebe from vaporizing into the air and disappearing was
his hand resting there.

   'i just wanted you to know, mr. birkway said, 'that mr. cadaver is not
buried in her garden. i've also just learned about your mother, phoebe, and
i'm sorry that she is gone, but i want to assure you that margaret would not
have kidnapped or murdered her.

   after mr. birkway left, phoebe and i sat on the front porch. phoebe said,
'if mrs. cadaver didn't kidnap or murder my mother, then where is she?
what can i do? where should i look?'

   'phoebe,' i said. 'there's something i've got to tell you.'

   'look, sal, if you're going to tell me she's not coming back, i don't want to
hear it. you might as well go home now. you might as well--'


   'no, phoebe, that isn't it. i know who the lunatic is. it's sergeant bickle's
son.

   and so we devised a plan.

 road's edge. i watched it plunge on,
eating up the road, defying those curves.

   gram sat quietly, with her hands folded on her lap. i thought she might
sleep, especially after staring awake all night, but she didn't. she wanted to
hear about peeby. so all day long, as i took in the scenery, and as i imagined
us in a thousand accidents and as i prayed underneath it all to any tree
whizzing by, i talked about peeby. i wanted to tell it all today. i wanted to
finish it.

   on the day after mr. birkway appeared at phoebe's house and told us
about mr. cadaver, phoebe and i were going to put our plan in motion. we
were going to track down sergeant bickle's son and, according to phoebe,
discover the whereabouts of phoebe's mother. i wasn't positive that sergeant
bickle's son was a lunatic, and i wasn't convinced he would lead us to
phoebe's mother, but enough of phoebe's tales had been transplanted into my
brain so that i was caught up in the plan. like phoebe, i was ready to take
some action.

hat kisses taste like chicken? did she really believe
you?' and they taunted me with, 'do you really kiss trees? didn't you know
you're supposed to kiss boys?'

   kisses were on my mind that day for other reasons. they were in the air.

   at lunch, my tray came in contact with ben's mouth. he might have been
aiming a kiss at my hand (a peculible thing for him to do), but he ended up
removing my bread crusts from his cheek and dashing out of the room.

   in english class, everyone badgered mr. birkway to finish reading the
journal entry that he had begun yesterday, the one about mrs. corpse and the
body in the garden, but mr. birkway did not read any more journals instead,
he apologized for hurting people's feelings by reading their private thoughts
aloud, and then he sent us to the library.

   there, ben trailed me for the next half-hour. if i looked at the fiction
section, he was right beside me. if i moved over to examine the magazines,
there he was flipping through one as well. once, hi

 ben sent me a valentine in the
middle of october that said,


roses are red

   there was a p. s. added: i've never written poetry before.

   i sent a valentine back that said:

is not in vain.


   i added a p.s. that said, i've never written any poetry either.

   ben and phoebe and mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge are all coming to
visit next month. there is a chance that mr. birkway might come as well,
but phoebe hopes not, as she does not think she could stand to be in a car for
that long with a teacher. my father and i have been scrubbing the house for
their visit. i can't wait to show phoebe and ben the swimming hole and the
fields, the hayloft and the trees, and the cows and the chickens blackberry,
the chicken that ben gave me, is queen of the coop, and i'll show ben her,
too. i am hoping, also, for some blackberry kisses between me and ben.
