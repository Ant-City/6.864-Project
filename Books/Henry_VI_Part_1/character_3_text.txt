    henry is dead and never shall revive.
    upon a wooden coffin we attend;
    and death's dishonourable victory
    we with our stately presence glorify,
    like captives bound to a triumphant car.
    what! shall we curse the planets of mishap
    that plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
    or shall we think the subtle-witted french
    conjurers and sorcerers, that, afraid of him,
    by magic verses have contriv'd his end?

    unto the french the dreadful judgment-day
    so dreadful will not be as was his sight.

  third messenger. my gracious lords, to add to your

    i must inform you of a dismal fight
    betwixt the stout lord talbot and the french.
  winchester. what! wherein talbot overcame? is't so?
  third messenger. o, no; wherein lord talbot was
    o'erthrown.
    the circumstance i'll tell you more at large.
    the tenth of august last this dreadful lord,
    retiring from the siege of orleans,
    having full scarce six thousand in his troop,
    by three and twenty thousand of the french
    was round encompassed and set upon.
    no leisure had he to enrank his men;
    he wanted pikes to set before his archers;

th grief
    the utter loss of all the realm of france.
  warwick. be patient, york. if we conclude a peace,
    it shall be with such strict and severe covenants
    as little shall the frenchmen gain thereby.

        enter charles, alencon, bastard, reignier, and others

  charles. since, lords of england, it is thus agreed
    that peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in france,
    we come to be informed by yourselves
    what the conditions of that league must be.
  york. speak, winchester; for boiling choler chokes
    the hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
    by sight of these our baleful enemies.
  cardinal. charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
    that, in regard king henry gives consent,
    of mere compassion and of lenity,
    to ease your country of distressful war,
    an suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
    you shall become true liegemen to his crown;
    and, charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
    to pay him tribute and submit thyself,
