 than she had ever hoped to find in this life.
she rose grandly to the occasion of motherhood--grateful,
deep down in her heart, that the child had not inherited the
great beauty that was hers: that her skin had dusk in it, that
her lashes were substantial but not undignified in their
length, that she had taken the broad flat nose of wiley
(although helene expected to improve it somewhat) and his
generous lips. under helene's hand the girl became
obedient and polite. any enthusiasms that little nel showed
were calmed by the mother until she drove her daughter's
imagination underground. helene wright was an
impressive woman, at least in medallion she was. heavy
hair in a bun, dark eyes arched in a perpetual query about
other people's manners. a woman who won all social
battles with presence and a conviction of the legitimacy of
her authority. since there was no catholic church in
medallion then, she joined the most conservative black
church. and held sway. it was helene who never turned he

1920. even in medallion there was a victorious swagger in
the legs of white men and a dull-eyed excitement in the
eyes of colored veterans. helene thought about the trip
south with heavy misgiving but decided that she had the
best protection: her manner and her bearing, to which she
would add a beautiful dress. she bought some deep-brown
wool and threefourths of a yard of matching velvet. out of
this she made herself a heavy but elegant dress with velvet
collar and pockets. nel watched her mother cutting the
pattern from newspapers and moving her eyes rapidly from
a magazine model to her own hands. she watched her turn
up the kerosene lamp at sunset to sew far into the night.
the day they were ready, helene cooked a smoked ham,
left a note for her lake-bound husband, in case he docked
early, and walked head high and arms stiff with luggage
ahead of her daughter to the train depot. it was a longer
walk than she remembered, and they saw the train
steaming up just as the

m. four or five black faces were watching,
two belonging to soldiers still in their shit-colored uniforms
and peaked caps. she saw their closed faces, their locked
eyes, and turned for compassion to the gray eyes of the
conductor. "we made a mistake, sir. you see, there wasn't
no sign. we just got in the wrong car, that's all. sir." "we
don't 'low no mistakes on this train. now git your butt on in
there." he stood there staring at her until she realized that
he wanted her to move aside. pulling nel by the arm, she
pressed herself and her daughter into the foot space in
front of a wooden seat. then, for no earthly reason, at least
no reason that anybody could understand, certainly no
reason that nel understood then or later, she smiled. like a
street pup that wags its tail at the very doorjamb of the
butcher shop he has been kicked away from only moments
before, helene smiled. smiled dazzlingly and coquettishly
at the salmon-colored face of the conductor. nel looked

the two black soldiers, who had been watching the scene
with what appeared to be indifference, now looked stricken.
behind nel was the bright and blazing light of her mother's
smile; before her the midnight eyes of the soldiers. she
saw the muscles of their faces tighten, a movement under
the skin from blood to marble. no change in the expression
of the eyes, but a hard wetness that veiled them as they
looked at the stretch of her mother's foolish smile. as the
door slammed on the conductor's exit, helene walked down
the aisle to a seat. she looked about for a second to see
whether any of the men would help her put the

fussily, her back toward the men. nel sat opposite, facing
both her mother and the soldiers, neither of whom she
could look at. she felt both pleased and ashamed to sense
that these men, unlike her father, who worshiped his
graceful, beautiful wife, were bubbling with a hatred for her
mother that had not been there in the beginning but had
been born with the dazzling smile. in the silence that
preceded the train's heave, she looked deeply at the folds
of her mother's dress. there in the fall of the heavy brown
wool she held her eye

travel upward for fear of seeing that the hooks and eyes in
the placket of the dress had come undone and exposed the
custard-colored skin underneath. she stared at the hem,
wanting to believe in its weight but knowing that custard
was all that it hid. if this tall, proud woman, this woman who
was very particular about her friends, who slipped into
church with unequaled elegance, who could quell a
roustabout with a look, if _she__ were really custard, then
there was a chance that nel was too. it was on that train,
shuffling toward cincinnati, that she resolved to be on
guard--always. she wanted to make certain that no man
ever looked at her that way. that no midnight eyes or
marbled flesh would ever accost her and turn her into jelly.

rain, turn to purple sunsets, and one night knotted on the
wooden seats (their heads on folded coats), trying not to
hear the snoring soldiers. when they changed trains in

times in the front room and once in the bedroom where
cecile's body lay. the old woman had died without seeing
or blessing her granddaughter. no one other than mr.
martin seemed to be in the house, but a sweet odor as of
gardenias told them that someone else had been. blotting
her lashes with a white handkerchief, helene walked
through the kitchen to the back bedroom where she had
slept for sixteen years. nel trotted along behind, enchanted
with the smell, the candles and the strangeness. when
helene bent to loosen the ribbons of nel's hat, a woman in
a yellow dress came out of the garden and onto the back
porch that opened into the bedroom. the two women
looked at each other. there was no recognition in the eyes
of either. then helene said, "this is your... grandmother,
nel." nel looked at her mother and then quickly back at the
door they had just come out of. "no. that was your greatgrandmother.

and stood there sweeping hair up from her neck back into
its halo-like roll, and wetting with spit the ringlets that fell
over her ears. "i been here, you know, most of the day. she

would have imagined her thin soft arms capable of. "'voir!

head to toe by her mother, nel ventured an observation.
"she smelled so nice. and her skin was so soft." helene
rinsed the cloth. "much handled things are always soft."

remembering the smell and the tight, tight hug of the woman
in yellow who rubbed burned matches over her eyes. late
that night after the fire was made, the cold supper eaten,
the surface dust removed, nel lay in bed thinking of her trip.
she remembered clearly the urine running down and into
her stockings until she learned how to squat properly; the
disgust on the face of the dead woman and the sound of
the funeral drums. it had been an exhilarating trip but a
fearful one. she had been frightened of the soldiers' eyes
on the train, the black wreath on the door, the custard
pudding she believed lurked under her mother's heavy
dress, the feel of unknown streets and unknown people. but

 on a real trip, and now she was different. she
got out of bed and lit the lamp to look in the mirror. there
was her face, plain brown eyes, three braids and the nose
her mother hated. she looked for a long time and suddenly
a shiver ran through her. "i'm me," she whispered. "me." nel
didn't know quite what she meant, but on the other hand she
knew exactly what she meant. "i'm me. i'm not their
daughter. i'm not nel. i'm me. me." each time she said the
word _me__ there was a gathering in her like power, like
joy, like fear. back in bed with her discovery, she stared out
the window at the dark leaves of the horse chestnut. "me,"
she murmured. and then, sinking deeper into the quilts, "i
want... iwant to be... wonderful. oh, jesus, make me
wonderful." the many experiences of her trip crowded in on
her. she slept. it was the last as well as the first time she
was ever to leave medallion. for days afterward sh

leaving medallion would be her goal. but that was before
she met sula, the girl she had seen for five years at
garfield primary but never played with, never knew,
because her mother said that sula's mother was sooty. the
trip, perhaps, or her new found me-ness, gave her the
strength to cultivate a friend in spite of her mother. when
sula first visited the wright house, helene's curdled scorn
turned to butter. her daughter's friend seemed to have none
of the mother's slackness. nel, who regarded the
oppressive neatness of her home with dread, felt
comfortable in it with sula, who loved it and would sit on the
red-velvet sofa for ten to twenty minutes at a time--still as
dawn. as for nel, she preferred sula's woolly house, where
a pot of something was always cooking on the stove; where
the mother, hannah, never scolded or gave directions;
where all sorts of people dropped in; where newspapers
were stacked in the hallway, and dirty dishes left for hours

business enterprises that lined the street. on sills, on
stoops, on crates and broken chairs they sat tasting their
teeth and waiting for something to distract them. every
passerby, every motorcar, every alteration in stance caught
their attention and was commented on. particularly they
watched women. when a woman approached, the older
men tipped their hats; the younger ones opened and closed
their thighs. but all of them, whatever their age, watched her
retreating view with interest. nel and sula walked through
this valley of eyes chilled by the wind and heated by the
embarrassment of appraising stares. the old men looked
at their stalklike legs, dwelled on the cords in the backs of
their knees and remembered old dance steps they had not
done in twenty years. in their lust, which age had turned to
kindness, they moved their lips as though to stir up the taste
of young sweat on tight skin. pig meat. the words were in
all their minds. and one of them, one of the young ones,

he seldom cursed, and the epithets he chose were dull,
even harmless. his reputation was derived from the way he
handled the words. when he said "hell" he hit the _h__ with
his lungs and the impact was greater than the achievement
of the most imaginative foul mouth in the town. he could say
"shit" with a nastiness impossible to imitate. so, when he
said "pig meat" as nel and sula passed, they guarded their
eyes lest someone see their delight. it was not really edna
finch's ice cream that made them brave the stretch of
those panther eyes. years later their own eyes would glaze
as they cupped their chins in remembrance of the inchworm
smiles, the squatting haunches, the track-rail legs
straddling broken chairs. the creamcolored trousers
marking with a mere seam the place where the mystery
curled. those smooth vanilla crotches invited them; those

thing that clotted their dreams. which was only fitting, for it
was in dreams that the two girls had first met. long before
edna finch's mellow house opened, even before they
marched through the chocolate halls of garfield primary
school out onto the playground and stood facing each other
through the ropes of the one vacant swing ("go on." "no.
you go."), they had already made each other's
acquaintance in the delirium of their noon dreams. they
were solitary little girls whose loneliness was so profound it
intoxicated them and sent them stumbling into
technicolored visions that always included a presence, a
someone, who, quite like the dreamer, shared the delight of
the dream. when nel, an only child, sat on the steps of her
back porch surrounded by the high silence of her mother's
incredibly orderly house, feeling the neatness pointing at
her back, she studied the poplars and fell easily into a
picture of herself lying on a flowered bed, tangled in her
own hair, waiting f

and the speed. so when they met, first in those chocolate
halls and next through the ropes of the swing, they felt the
ease and comfort of old friends. because each had
discovered years before that they were neither white nor
male, and that all freedom and triumph was forbidden to
them, they had set about creating something else to be.
their meeting was fortunate, for it let them use each other
to grow on. daughters of distant mothers and
incomprehensible fathers (sula's because he was dead;
nel's because he wasn't), they found in each other's eyes
the intimacy they were looking for. nel wright and sula
peace were both twelve in 1922, wishbone thin and easyassed.
nel was the color of wet sandpaper--just dark
enough to escape the blows of the pitch-black truebloods
and the contempt of old women who worried about such
things as bad blood mixtures and knew that the origins of a
mule and a mulatto were one and the same. had she been

thing like a stemmed rose. it gave her otherwise plain
face a broken excitement and blue-blade threat like the
keloid scar of the razored man who sometimes played
checkers with her grandmother. the birthmark was to grow
darker as the years passed, but now it was the same
shade as her gold-flecked eyes, which, to the end, were as
steady and clean as rain. their friendship was as intense
as it was sudden. they found relief in each other's
personality. although both were unshaped, formless things,
nel seemed stronger and more consistent than sula, who
could hardly be counted on to sustain any emotion for more
than three minutes. yet there was one time when that was
not true, when she held on to a mood for weeks, but even
that was in defense of nel. four white boys in their early
teens, sons of some newly arrived irish people,
occasionally entertained themselves in the afternoon by
harassing black schoolchildren. with shoes that pinched
and woolen knickers that made red rings on their calves,

 scorned them. the one exception
was the black community. although some of the negroes
had been in medallion before the civil war (the town didn't
even have a name then), if they had any hatred for these
newcomers it didn't matter because it didn't show. as a
matter of fact, baiting them was the one activity that the
white protestant residents concurred in. in part their place
in this world was secured only when they echoed the old
residents' attitude toward blacks. these particular boys
caught nel once, and pushed her from hand to hand until
they grew tired of the frightened helpless face. because of
that incident, nel's route home from school became
elaborate. she, and then sula, managed to duck them for
weeks until a chilly day in november when sula said, "let's
us go on home the shortest way." nel blinked, but
acquiesced. they walked up the street until they got to the
bend of carpenter's road where the boys lounged on a
disused well. spotting their prey, the boys sauntered

the four boys stared open-mouthed at the wound and the
scrap of flesh, like a button mushroom, curling in the cherry
blood that ran into the corners of the slate. sula raised her
eyes to them. her voice was quiet. "if i can do that to
myself, what you suppose i'll do to you?" the shifting dirt
was the only way nel knew that they were moving away; she
was looking at sula's face, which seemed miles and miles
away. but toughness was not their quality--
adventuresomeness was--and a mean determination to
explore everything that interested them, from one-eyed
chickens high-stepping in their penned yards to mr.

in the safe harbor of each other's company they could afford
to abandon the ways of other people and concentrate on
their own perceptions of things. when mrs. wright
reminded nel to pull her nose, she would do it
enthusiastically but without the least hope in the world.
"while you sittin' there, honey, go 'head and pull your nose."
"it hurts, mamma." "don't you want a nice nose when you
grow up?" after she met sula, nel slid the clothespin under
the blanket as soon as she got in the bed. and although

boys who dotted the landscape like jewels, split the air with
their shouts in the field, and thickened the river with their
shining wet backs. even their footsteps left a smell of
smoke behind. it was in that summer, the summer of their
twelfth year, the summer of the beautiful black boys, that
they became skittish, frightened and bold--all at the same
time. in that mercury mood in july, sula and nel wandered
about the bottom barefoot looking for mischief. they
decided to go down by the river where the boys sometimes
swam. nel waited on the porch of 7 carpenter's road while
sula ran into the house to go to the toilet. on the way up the
stairs, she passed the kitchen where hannah sat with two
friends, patsy and valentine. the two women were fanning
themselves and watching hannah put down some dough,

she only heard hannah's words, and the pronouncement
sent her flying up the stairs. in bewilderment, she stood at
the window fingering the curtain edge, aware of a sting in
her eye. nel's call floated up and into the window, pulling
her away from dark thoughts back into the bright, hot
daylight. they ran most of the way. heading toward the
wide part of the river where trees grouped themselves in
families darkening the earth below. they passed some
boys swimming and clowning in the water, shrouding their
words in laughter. they ran in the sunlight, creating their
own breeze, which pressed their dresses into their damp
skin. reaching a kind of square of four leaf-locked trees

shade to taste their lip sweat and contemplate the
wildness that had come upon them so suddenly. they lay in
the grass, their foreheads almost touching, their bodies
stretched away from each other at a 180-degree angle.
sula's head rested on her arm, an undone braid coiled
around her wrist. nel leaned on her elbows and worried
long blades of grass with her fingers. underneath their
dresses flesh tightened and shivered in the high coolness,
their small breasts just now beginning to create some
pleasant discomfort when they were lying on their
stomachs. sula lifted her head and joined nel in the grass
play. in concert, without ever meeting each other's eyes,
they stroked the blades up and down, up and down. nel

sula looked about and found one too. when both twigs
were undressed nel moved easily to the next stage and
began tearing up rooted grass to make a bare spot of
earth. when a generous clearing was made, sula traced
intricate patterns in it with her twig. at first nel was content
to do the same. but soon she grew impatient and poked
her twig rhythmically and intensely into the earth, making a
small neat hole that grew deeper and wider with the least
manipulation of her twig. sula copied her, and soon each
had a hole the size of a cup. nel began a more strenuous
digging and, rising to her knee, was careful to scoop out
the dirt as she made her hole deeper. together they
worked until the two holes were one and the same. when

bottle cap and tossed it in as well. each then looked around
for more debris to throw into the hole: paper, bits of glass,
butts of cigarettes, until all of the small defiling things they
could find were collected there. carefully they replaced the
soil and covered the entire grave with uprooted grass.

picking. "come up here and say that." "leave him 'lone,

"naw." "you scared we gone take your bugger away?"
"leave him 'lone, i said. come on, chicken. look. i'll help

pointing to--a big double beech with low branches and lots
of bends for sitting. he moved slowly toward her. "come

wide, he came to where they were standing. sula took him
by the hand and coaxed him along. when they reac

"go on. go on. i got you." she followed the boy, steadying
him, when he needed it, with her hand and her reassuring
voice. when they were as high as they could go, sula
pointed to the far side of the river. "see? bet you never saw
that far before, did you?" "uh uh." "now look down there."
they both leaned a little and peered through the leaves at
nel standing below, squinting up at them. from their height
she looked small and foreshortened. chicken little
laughed. "y'all better come on down before you break your
neck," nel hollered. "i ain't never coming down," the boy
hollered back. "yeah. we better. come on, chicken."

hands and swung him outward then around and around. his

the birds and the fat grasshoppers. when he slipped from

still hear his bubbly laughter. the water darkened and

crossed the river to shadrack's house. there was no path.

feeling his gaze turning, turning with her. at the edge of the
porch, gathering the wisps of courage that were fast leaving
her, she turned once more to look at him, to ask him... had
he...? he was smiling, a great smile, heavy with lust and
time to come. he nodded his head as though answering a
question, and said, in a pleasant conversational tone, a
tone of cooled butter, "always." sula fled down the steps,
and shot through the greenness and the baking sun back to
nel and the dark closed place in the water. there she
collapsed in tears. nel quieted her. "sh, sh. don't, don't.

lying on the table in the basement of the mortuary, her
mouth snapped shut, and when she saw his body her mouth
flew wide open again and it was seven hours before she
was able to close it and make the first sound. so the coffin
was closed. the junior choir, dressed in white, sang
"nearer mygod to thee" and "precious memories," their
eyes fastened on the songbooks they did not need, for this
was the first time their voices had presided at a real-life
event. nel and sula did not touch hands or look at each
other during the funeral. there was a space, a
separateness, between them. nel's legs had turned to
granite and she expected the sheriff or reverend deal's
pointing finger at any moment. although she knew she had
"done nothing," she felt convicted and hanged right there in
the pew--two rows down from her parents in the children's
section. sula simply cried. soundlessly and with no heaving

the cemetery, they sank chicken little in between his
grandfather and an aunt. butterflies flew in and out of the
bunches of field flowers now loosened from the top of the
bier and lying in a small heap at the edge of the grave. the
heat had gone, but there was still no breeze to lift the hair of
the willows. nel and sula stood some distance away from
the grave, the space that had sat between them in the pews
had dissolved. they held hands and knew that only the
coffin would lie in the earth; the bubbly laughter and the
press of fingers in the palm would stay aboveground
forever. at first, as they stood there, their hands were
clenched together. they relaxed slowly until during the walk
back home their fingers were laced in as gentle a clasp as
that of any two young girlfriends trotting up the road on a

wonders and saying, "mamma, did you ever love us?" she
sang the words like a small child saying a piece at easter,
then knelt to spread a newspaper on the floor and set the
basket on it; the bowl she tucked in the space between her
legs. eva, who was just sitting there fanning herself with the
cardboard fan from mr. hodges' funeral parlor, listened to
the silence that followed hannah's words, then said, "scat!"
to the deweys who were playing chain gang near the
window. with the shoelaces of each of them tied to the
laces of the others, they stumbled and tumbled out of eva's
room. "now," eva looked up across from her

been to a big wedding; they simply assumed it was rather
like a funeral except afterward you didn't have to walk all the
way out to beechnut cemetery. this wedding offered a
special attraction, for the bridegroom was a handsome,
well-liked man--the tenor of mount zion's men's quartet,
who had an enviable reputation among the girls and a
comfortable one among men. his name was jude greene,
and with the pick of some eight or ten girls who came
regularly to services to hear him sing, he had chosen nel
wright. he wasn't really aiming to get married. he was
twenty then, and although his job as a waiter at the hotel
medallion was a blessing to his parents and their seven
other children, it wasn't nearly enough to support a wife. he
had brought the subject up first on the day the word got out
that the town was building a new road, tarmac, that would
wind through medallion on down to the river, where a great
new bridge was to be built to connect medallion to porter's
landing, the town on the othe

prosperity was still around. in a state of euphoria, with a
hunger for more and more, the council of founders cast its
eye toward a future that would certainly include trade from
cross-river towns. towns that needed more than a house
raft to get to the merchants of medallion. work had already
begun on the new river road (the city had always meant to
name it something else, something wonderful, but ten years
later when the bridge idea was dropped for a tunnel it was
still called the new river road). along with a few other
young black men, jude had gone down to the shack where
they were hiring. three old colored men had already been
hired, but not for the road work, just to do the picking up,
food bringing and other small errands. these old men were
close to feeble, not good for much else, and everybody was
pleased they were taken on; still it was a shame to see
those white men laughing with the grandfathers but shying
away from the young black men w

in the restaurant, where a good day's work was marked by
the number of dirty plates and the weight of the garbage
bin. "i built that road." people would walk over his sweat for
years. perhaps a sledge hammer would come crashing
down on his foot, and when people asked him how come
he limped, he could say, "got that building the new road."
it was while he was full of such dreams, his body already
feeling the rough work clothes, his hands already curved to
the pick handle, that he spoke to nel about getting married.
she seemed receptive but hardly anxious. it was after he
stood in lines for six days running and saw the gang boss
pick out thin-armed white boys from the virginia hills and
the bull-necked greeks and italians and heard over and
over, "nothing else today. come back tomorrow," that he
got the message. so it was rage, rage and a determination
to take on a man's role anyhow that made him press nel
about settling down. he needed some of his appetites

someone sweet, industrious and loyal to shore him up. and
in return he would shelter her, love her, grow old with her.
without that someone he was a waiter hanging around a
kitchen like a woman. with her he was head of a household
pinned to an unsatisfactory job out of necessity. the two of
them together would make one jude. his fears lest his
burst dream of road building discourage her were never
realized. nel's indifference to his hints about marriage
disappeared altogether when she discovered his pain.
jude could see himself taking shape in her eyes. she
actually wanted to help, to soothe, and was it true what ajax
said in the time and a half pool hall? that "all they want,
man, is they own misery. ax em to die for you and they
yours for life." whether he was accurate in general, ajax
was right about nel. except for an occasional leadership
role with sula, she had no aggression. her parents had

ceeded in rubbing down to a dull glow any sparkle or
splutter she had. only with sula did that quality have free
rein, but their friendship was so close, they themselves had
difficulty distinguishing one's thoughts from the other's.
during all of her girlhood the only respite nel had had from
her stern and undemonstrative parents was sula. when
jude began to hover around, she was flattered--all the girls
liked him--and sula made the enjoyment of his attentions
keener simply because she seemed always to want nel to
shine. they never quarreled, those two, the way some
girlfriends did over boys, or competed against each other
for them. in those days a compliment to one was a
compliment to the other, and cruelty to one was a challenge
to the other. nel's response to jude's

saturday in june, danced at the wedding where everybody
realized for the first time that except for their magnificent
teeth, the deweys would never grow. they had been fortyeight
inches tall for years now, and while their size was
unusual it was not unheard of. the realization was based on
the fact that they remained boys in mind. mischievous,
cunning, private and completely unhousebroken, their
games and interests had not changed since hannah had
them all put into the first grade together. nel and jude, who
had been the stars all during the wedding, were forgotten
finally as the reception melted into a dance, a feed, a
gossip session, a playground and a love nest. for the first
time that day they relaxed and looked at each other, and
liked what they saw. they began to dance, pressed in
among the others, and each one turned his thoughts to the
night that was coming on fast. they had taken a
housekeeping room with one of jude's aunts (over the
protest of mrs. wright, who had rooms to s

didn't want to make love to her husband in her mother's
house) and were getting restless to go there. as if reading
her thoughts, jude leaned down and whispered, "me too."
nel smiled and rested her cheek on his shoulder. the veil
she wore was too heavy to allow her to feel the core of the
kiss he pressed on her head. when she raised her eyes to
him for one more look of reassurance, she saw through the
open door a slim figure in blue, gliding, with just a hint of a
strut, down the path toward the road. one hand was
pressed to the head to hold down the large hat against the
warm june breeze. even from the rear nel could tell that it
was sula and that she was smiling; t

but it did no good. in april two men came with a stretcher
and she didn't even have time to comb her hair before they
strapped her to a piece of canvas. when mr. buckland
reed came by to pick up the number, his mouth sagged at
the sight of eva being carried out and sula holding some
papers against the wall, at the bottom of which, just above
the word "guardian," she very carefully wrote miss sula
mae peace. * * * nel alone noticed the peculiar quality of
the may that followed the leaving of the birds. it had a
sheen, a glimmering as of green, rain-soaked saturday
nights (lit by the excitement of newly installed street lights);
of lemonyellow afternoons bright with iced drinks and
splashes of daffodils. it showed in the damp faces of her
children and the river-smoothness of their voices. even her
own body was not immune to the magic. she would sit on
the floor to sew as she had done as a girl, fold her legs

head. there were easy sun-washed days and purple dusks
in which tar baby sang "abide with me" at prayer
meetings, his lashes darkened by tears, his silhouette limp
with regret against the whitewashed walls of greater saint
matthew's. nel listened and was moved to smile. to smile
at the sheer loveliness that pressed in from the windows
and touched his grief, making it a pleasure to behold.
although it was she alone who saw this magic, she did not
wonder at it. she knew it was all due to sula's return to the
bottom. it was like getting the use of an eye back, having a
cataract removed. her old friend had come home. sula.

new eyes, in whose presence she felt clever, gentle and a

inadequacy was mere idiosyncrasy, a character trait rather
than a deficiency? anyone who left behind that aura of fun
and complicity? sula never competed; she simply helped
others define themselves. other people seemed to turn
their volume on and up when sula was in the room. more
than any other thing, humor returned. she could listen to the
crunch of sugar underfoot that the children had spilled
without reaching for the switch; and she forgot the tear in
the living-room window shade. even nel's love for jude,
which over the years had spun a steady gray web around
her heart, became a bright and easy affection, a
playfulness that was reflected in their lovemaking. sula
would come by of an afternoon, walking along with her fluid
stride, wearing a plain yellow dress the same way her
mother, hannah, had worn those too-big house dresses--
with a distance, an absence of a relationship to clothes
which emphasized everything the fabric covered. when she

inside, the dishes piled in the sink looked as though they
belonged there; the dust on the lamps sparkled; the hair
brush lying on the "good" sofa in the living room did not
have to be apologetically retrieved, and nel's grimy
intractable children looked like three wild things happily
insouciant in the may shine. "hey, girl." the rose mark over
sula's eye gave her glance a suggestion of startled
pleasure. it was darker than nel remembered. "hey
yourself. come on in here." "how you doin'?" sula moved a
pile of ironed diapers from a chair and sat down. "oh, i ain't
strangled nobody yet so i guess i'm all right." "well, if you
change your mind call me." "somebody need killin'?" "half
this town need it." "and the other half?" "a drawn-out

head onto crossed arms while tears of laughter dripped
into the warm diapers. laughter that weakened her knees
and pressed her bladder into action. her rapid soprano
and sula's dark sleepy chuckle made a duet that frightened
the cat and made the children run in from the back yard,
puzzled at first by the wild free sounds, then delighted to
see their mother stumbling merrily toward the bathroom,
holding on to her stomach, fairly singing through the
laughter: "aw. aw. lord. sula. stop

cupboards, picking up pots and ice picks... " "you sure

in the water spread before them. nel put the iron on the
stove. the situation was clear to her now. sula, like always,
was incapable of making any but the most trivial decisions.
when it came to matters of grave importance, she behaved
emotionally and irresponsibly and left it to others to
straighten out. and when fear struck her, she did
unbelievable things. like that time with her finger. whatever
those hunkies did, it wouldn't have been as bad as what
she did to herself. but sula was so scared she had

the entrance of their father. jude opened the back door and
walked into the kitchen. he was still a very good-looking
man, and the only difference sula could see was the thin
pencil mustache under his nose, and a part in his hair.
"hey, jude. what you know good?" "white man running it--
nothing good." sula laughed while nel, high-tuned to his
moods, ignored her husband's smile saying, "bad day,
honey?" "same old stuff," he replied and told them a brief
tale of some personal insult done him by a customer and
his boss--a whiney tale that peaked somewhere between
anger and a lapping desire for comfort. he ended it with the
observation that a negro man had a hard row to hoe in this
world. he expected his story to dovetail into milkwarm
commiseration, but before nel could excrete it, sula said
she didn't know about tha

saying, "well, if that's the only way they got to show it--cut
off my balls and throw me in jail--i'd just as soon they left me
alone." but thinking that sula had an odd way of looking at
things and that her wide smile took some of the sting from
that rattlesnake over her eye. a funny woman, he thought,
not that bad-looking. but he could see why she wasn't

good taste was out of place in the company of death, death
itself was the essence of bad taste. and there must be
much rage and saliva in its presence. the body must move
and throw itself about, the eyes must roll, the hands should
have no peace, and the throat should release all the
yearning, despair and outrage that accompany the stupidity
of loss. "the real hell of hell is that it is forever." sula said
that. she said doing anything forever and ever was hell. nel
didn't understand it then, but now in the bathroom, trying to
feel, she thought, "if i could be sure that i could stay here in
this small white room with the dirty tile and water gurgling in
the pipes and my head on the cool rim of this bathtub and
never have to go out the door, iwould be happy. if i could be

had twisted her into a curve on the floor and flayed her
would be gone. she would lose that too. "why, even in hate
here i am thinking of what sula said." hunched down in the
small bright room nel waited. waited for the oldest cry. a
scream not for others, not in sympathy for a burnt child, or a
dead father, but a deeply personal cry for one's own pain. a
loud, strident: "why me?" she waited. the mud shifted, the
leaves stirred, the smell of overripe green things enveloped
her and announced the beginnings of her very own howl.
but it did not come. the odor evaporated; the leaves were
still, the mud settled. and finally there was nothing, just a

she wanted to see the person's face change rapidly. she
was completely free of ambition, with no affection for
money, property or things, no greed, no desire to command
attention or compliments--no ego. for that reason she felt
no compulsion to verify herself--be consistent with herself.
she had clung to nel as the closest thing to both an other
and a self, only to discover that she and nel were not one
and the same thing. she had no thought at all of causing
nel pain when she bedded down with jude. they had
always shared the affection of other people: compared how
a boy kissed, what line he used with one and then the other.

ill prepared for the possessiveness of the one person she

jealous of other women; that they were only afraid of losing
their jobs. afraid their husbands would discover that no
uniqueness lay between their legs. nel was the one person
who had wanted nothing from her, who had accepted all

the moonshine fighting to pierce their corners. if they were
touched by the snake's breath, however fatal, they were
merely victims and knew how to behave in that role (just as
nel knew how to behave as the wronged wife). but the free

the reasons she had drifted back to medallion, that and the
boredom she found in nashville, detroit, new orleans, new

like any artist with no art form, she became dangerous. she
had lied only once in her life--to nel about the reason for
putting eva out, and she could lie to her only because she
cared about her. when she had come back home, social
conversation was impossible for her because she could not
lie. she could not say to those old acquaintances, "hey,

irony and outrage in lying under someone, in a position of
surrender, feeling her own abiding strength and limitless
power. but the cluster did break, fall apart, and in her panic
to hold it together she leaped from the edge into
soundlessness and went down howling, howling in a
stinging awareness of the endings of things: an eye of
sorrow in the midst of all that hurricane rage of joy. there, in
the center of that silence was not eternity but the death of
time and a loneliness so profound the word itself had no
meaning. for loneliness assumed the absence of other
people, and the solitude she found in that desperate terrain
had never admitted the possibility of other people. she
wept then. tears for the deaths of the littlest things: the
castaway shoes of children; broken stems of marsh grass
battered and drowned by the sea; prom photographs of
dead women she never knew; wedding rings in pawnshop
windows; the tidy bodies of cornish hens in a nest of rice.

words, in her voice, was a sound he knew well. for the first

the gleaming kitchen and the table set for two and detected
the scent of the nest. every hackle on his body rose, and he
knew that very soon she would, like all of her sisters before
her, put to him the death-knell question "where you been?"

to know his name so how could he help but leave me since
he was making love to a woman who didn't even know his
name. "when iwas a little girl the heads of my paper dolls
came off, and it was a long time before i discovered that my
own head would not fall off if i bent my neck. i used to walk
around holding it very stiff because i thought a strong wind
or a heavy push would snap my neck. nel was the one who
told me the truth. but she was wrong. i did not hold my head
stiff enough when imet him and so i lost it just like the dolls.
"it's just as well he left. soon iwould have torn the flesh from
his face just to see if iwas right about the gold and nobody
would have understood that kind of curiosity. they would
have believed that iwanted to hurt him just like the little boy

her stomach. she would be facing the black rose that jude
had kissed and looking at the nostrils of the woman who
had twisted her love for her own children into something so
thick and monstrous she was afraid to show it lest it break
loose and smother them with its heavy paw. a cumbersome
bear-love that, given any rein, would suck their breath away
in its crying need for honey. because jude's leaving was so
complete, the full responsibility of the household was nel's.
there were no more fifty dollars in brown envelopes to
count on, so she took to cleaning rather than fret away the
tiny seaman's pension her parents lived on. and just this
past year she got a better job working as a chambermaid
in the same hotel jude had worked in. the tips were only
fair, but the hours were good--she was home when the
children got out of school. at thirty her hot brown eyes had
turned to agate, and her skin had taken on the sheen of

wanted it to have: free of delight or a lip-smacking "i told

received up in the bottom--free of the least hint of
retribution. now she stood in eva's old bedroom, looking
down at that dark rose, aware of the knife-thin arms sliding
back and forth over the quilt and the boarded-up window
eva had jumped out of. sula looked up and without a
second's pause followed nel's example of leaving out the

of a snarl. nel took the piece of paper and picked up her
own purse, saying, "ok. i'll be right back." as soon as the
door was shut, sula breathed through her mouth. while nel
was in the room the pain had increased. now that this new
pain killer, the one she had been holding in reserve, was on
the way her misery was manageable. she let a piece of her
mind lay on nel. it was funny, sending nel off to that
drugstore right away like that, after she had not seen her to
speak to for years. the drugstore was where edna finch's

they sat in that cool room with the marble-top tables and ate

going back there alone and sula was waiting for the
medicine the doctor said not to take until the pain got really
bad. and she supposed "really bad" was now. although you
could never tell. she wondered for an instant what nellie
wanted; why she had come. did she want to gloat? make
up? following this line of thought required more
concentration than she could muster. pain was greedy; it
demanded all of her attention. but it was good that this new
medicine, the reserve, would be brought to her by her old
friend. nel, she remembered, always thrived on a crisis.

then on she had let her emotions dictate her behavior. she
could hear nel's footsteps long before she opened the door
and put the medicine on the table near the bed. as sula
poured the liquid into a sticky spoon, nel began the
sickroom conversation. "you look fine, sula." "you lying,

realized that sula was probably just showing off. no telling
what shape she was really in, but there was no point in
saying anything other than what was the truth. "i always
understood how you could take a man. now i understand
why you can't keep none." "is that what i'm supposed to do?

rail of the bed. now she would ask her. "how come you did
it, sula?" there was a silence but nel felt no obligation to fill
it. sula stirred a little under the covers. she looked bored
as she sucked her teeth. "well, there was this space in front
of me, behind me, in my head. some space. and jude
filled it up. that's all. he just filled up the space." "you mean
you didn't even love him?" the feel of the brass was in nel's

what did you take him for if you didn't love him and why

sula, why don't that matter?" sula turned her head away
from the boarded window. her voice was quiet and the
stemmed rose over her eye was very dark. "it matters, nel,
but only to you. not to anybody else. being good to
somebody is just like being mean to somebody. risky. you
don't get nothing for it." nel took her hands from the brass
railing. she was annoyed with herself. finally when she had
gotten the nerve to ask the question, the right question, it
made no difference. sula couldn't give her a sensible
answer because she didn't know. would be, in fact, the last
to know. talking to her about right and wrong was like
talking to the deweys. she picked at t

and thought of the wind pressing her dress between her
legs as she ran up the bank of the river to four leaf-locked
trees and the digging of holes in the earth. embarrassed,
irritable and a little bit ashamed, nel rose to go. "goodbye,
sula. i don't reckon i'll be back." she opened the door and
heard sula's low whisper. "hey, girl." nel paused and
turned her head but not enough to see her. "how you
know?" sula asked. "know what?" nel still wouldn't look at
her. "about who was good. how you know it was you?"
"what you mean?" "imean maybe it wasn't you. maybe it
was me." nel took two steps out the door and closed it
behind her. she walked down the hall and down the four
flights of steps. the house billowed

were they? eva out at the old folks' home, the deweys living
anywhere, tar baby steeped in wine, and sula upstairs in
eva's bed with a boarded-up window and an empty
pocketbook on the dresser. * * * when nel closed the door,
sula reached for more medicine. then she turned the pillow
over to its cool side and thought about her old friend. "so
she will walk on down that road, her back so straight in that
old green coat, the strap of her handbag pushed back all
the way to the elbow, thinking how much i have cost her and
never remember the days when we were two throats and
one eye and we had no price." pictures drifted through her
head as lightly as dandelion spores: the blue eagle that

dream again. the clabber girl baking powder lady was
smiling and beckoning to her, one hand under her apron.
when sula came near she disintegrated into white dust,
which sula was hurriedly trying to stuff into the pockets of
her blue-flannel housecoat. the disintegration was awful to
see, but worse was the feel of the powder--its starchy
slipperiness as she tried to collect it by handfuls. the more
she scooped, the more it billowed. at last it covered her,
filled her eyes, her nose, her throat, and she woke gagging
and overwhelmed with the smell of smoke. pain took hold.

n planks with the steel rod slanting across
them was the only peace she had. the sealed window
soothed her with its sturdy termination, its unassailable
finality. it was as though for the first time she was
completely alone--where she had always wanted to be--free
of the possibility of distraction. it would be here, only here,
held by this blind window high above the elm tree, that she
might draw her legs up to her chest, close her eyes, put her
thumb in her mouth and float over and down the tunnels, just
missing the dark walls, down, down until she met a rain
scent and would know the water was near, and she would
curl into its heavy softness and it would envelop her, carry
her, and wash her tired flesh always. always. who said
that? she tried hard to think. who was it that had promised
her a sleep of water always? the effort to recall was too
great; it loosened a knot in her chest that turned her
thoughts again to the pain. while in this state of weary
anticipation, she noticed that she

was not breathing, that
her heart had stopped completely. a crease of fear touched
her breast, for any second there was sure to be a violent
explosion in her brain, a gasping for breath. then she
realized, or rather she sensed, that there was not going to
be any pain. she was not breathing because she didn't
have to. her body did not need oxygen. she was dead.
sula felt her face smiling. "well, i'll be damned," she
thought, "it didn't even hurt. wait'll i tell nel."

the death of sula peace was the best news folks up in the
bottom had had since the promise of work at the tunnel. of
the few who were not afraid to witness the burial of a witch
and who had gone to the cemetery, some had come just to
verify her being put away but stayed to sing "shall we
gather at the river" for politeness' sake, quite unaware of
the bleak promise of their song. others came to see that
nothing went awry, that the shallowminded and smallhearted
kept their meanness at bay,

who came--not to the white funeral parlor but to the colored
part of the beechnut cemetery--felt that either _because__
sula was dead or just _after__ she was dead a brighter
day was dawning. there were signs. the rumor that the
tunnel spanning the river would use negro workers became
an announcement. planned, abandoned and replanned for
years, this project had finally begun in 1937. for three
years there were rumors that blacks would work it, and
hope was high in spite of the fact that the river road
leading to the tunnel had encouraged similar hopes in but
had ended up being built entirely by white labor--hillbillies
and immigrants taking even the lowest jobs. but the tunnel
itself was another matter. the craft work--no, th

even a definite and witnessed interview of four colored
men (and the promise of more in the spring) at the tunnel
site could not break the cold vise of that lean and bitter
year's end. christmas came one morning and haggled
everybody's nerves like a dull ax--too shabby to cut clean
but too heavy to ignore. the children lay wall-eyed on
creaking beds or pallets near the stove, sucking
peppermint and oranges in between coughs while their
mothers stomped the floors in rage at the cakes that did not
rise because the stove fire had been so stingy; at the curled
bodies of men who chose to sleep the day away rath

forget whatever it was he could not remember. now he
could not remember that he had ever forgotten anything.
perhaps that was why for the first time after that cold day in
france he was beginning to miss the presence of other
people. shadrack had improved enough to feel lonely. if he
was lonely before, he didn't know it because the noise he
kept up, the roaring, the busyness, protected him from
knowing it. now the compulsion to activity, to filling up the
time when he was not happily fishing on the riverbank, had
dwindled. he sometimes fell asleep before he got drunk;
sometimes spent whole days looking at the river and the
sky; and more and more he relinquished the military habits
of cleanliness in his shack. once a bird flew into his door--

hour. when the bird found the window and flew away,
shadrack was grieved and actually waited and watched for
its return. during those days of waiting, he did not make his
bed, or sweep, or shake out the little rag-braid rug, and
almost forgot to slash with his fish knife the passing day on
his calendar. when he did return to housekeeping, it was
not with the precision he had always insisted upon. the
messier his house got, the lonelier he felt, and it was harder
and harder to conjure up sergeants, and orderlies, and
invading armies; harder and harder to hear the gunfire and
keep the platoon marching in time. more frequently now he
looked at and fondled the one piece of evidence that he
once had a visitor in his house: a child's purple-and-white
belt. the one the little girl left behind when she came to see
him. shadrack remembered the scene clearly. he had
stepped into the door and there was a tear-stained face

made by its long life on a nail. it was pleasant living with that
sign of a visitor, his only one. and after a while he was able
to connect the belt with the face, the tadpole-overthe-eyeface
that he sometimes saw up in the bottom. his visitor,
his company, his guest, his social life, his woman, his
daughter, his friend--they all hung there on a nail near his
bed. now he stared at the tiny moon floating high over the
ice-choked river. his loneliness had dropped down
somewhere around his ankles. some other feeling
possessed him. a feeling that touched his eyes and made
him blink. he had seen her again months? weeks? ago.
raking leaves for mr. hodges, he had gone into the cellar
for two bushel baskets to put them in. in the hallway he
passed an open door leading to a small room. she lay on a

to where the sidewalk started, some of them stopped and
decided to turn back, too embarrassed to enter the white
part of town whooping like banshees. but except for three
or four, the fainthearted were put to shame by the more
aggressive and abandoned, and the parade danced down
main street past woolworth's and the old poultry house,
turned right and moved on down the new river road. at
the mouth of the tunnel excavation, in a fever pitch of
excitement and joy, they saw the timber, the bricks, the
steel ribs and the tacky wire gate that glittered under ice
struck to diamond in the sun. it dazzled them, at first, and
they were suddenly quiet. their hooded eyes swept over
the place where their hope had lain since 1927. there was
the promise: leaf-dead. the teeth unrepaired, the coal
credit cut off, the chest pains unattended, the school shoes
unbought, the rush-stuffed mattresses, the broken toilets,

ribs and smashed the bricks they would never fire in
yawning kilns, split the sacks of limestone they had not
mixed or even been allowed to haul; tore the wire mesh,
tipped over wheelbarrows and rolled forepoles down the
bank, where they sailed far out on the icebound river. old
and young, women and children, lame and hearty, they
killed, as best they could, the tunnel they were forbidden to
build. they didn't mean to go in, to actually go down into the
lip of the tunnel, but in their need to kill it all, all of it, to wipe
from the face of the earth the work of the thin-armed
virginia boys, the bull-necked greeks and the knife-faced
men who waved the leaf-dead promise, they went too
deep, too far... a lot of them died there. the earth, now
warm, shifted; the first forepole slipped; loose rock fell from
the face of the tunnel and caused a shield to give way.

mouth the ice she had craved all her life. tar baby, dessie,

brothers and the deweys (at least it was supposed; their
bodies were never found)--all died there. mr. buckland
reed escaped, so did patsy and her two boys, as well as
some fifteen or twenty who had not gotten close enough to
fall, or whose timidity would not let them enter an unfinished
tunnel. and all the while shadrack stood there. having

there was another old people's home. look like this town
just kept on building homes for old people. every time they
built a road they built a old folks' home. you'd think folks
was living longer, but the fact of it was, they was just being

recent one yet, but it was her turn in circle number 5 to visit
some of the old women there. the pastor visited them
regularly, but the circle thought private visits were nice too.

was true that eva was foolish in the head, but not so bad as
to need locking up. nel was more than a little curious to see
her. she had been really active in church only a year or
less, and that was because the children were grown now
and took up less time and less space in her mind. for over
twenty-five years since jude walked out she had pinned
herself into a tiny life. she spent a little time trying to marry
again, but nobody wanted to take her on with three children,
and she simply couldn't manage the business of keeping
boyfriends. during the war she had had a rather long

because the bottom had been a real place. these young

now there weren't any places left, just separate houses with
separate televisions and separate telephones and less and
less dropping by. these were the same thoughts she
always had when she walked down into the town. one of
the last true pedestrians, nel walked the shoulder road
while cars slipped by. laughed at by her children, she still
walked wherever she wanted to go, allowing herself to
accept rides only when the weather required it. now she
went straight through the town and turned left at its farthest
end, along a tree-lined walk that turned into a country road
farther on and passed the cemetery, beechnut park. when
she got to sunnydale, the home for the aged, it was already

she imagined a college dormitory to be. the lobby was
luxurious--modern--but the rooms she peeped into were
sterile green cages. there was too much light everywhere;
it needed some shadows. the third door, down the hall,
had a little name tag over it that read eva peace. nel
twisted the knob and rapped a little on the door at the same
time, then listened a moment before she opened it. at first
she couldn't believe it. she seemed so small, sitting at that
table in a black-vinyl chair. all the heaviness had gone and
the height. her once beautiful leg had no stocking and the
foot was in a slipper. nel wanted to cry-not for eva's milkdull
eyes or her floppy lips, but for the once proud foot

shoe, now stuffed grace

and dreaming of stairwells. she had neither iron nor clothes
but did not stop her fastidious lining up of pleats or
pressing out of wrinkles even when she acknowledged
nel's greeting. "howdy. sit down." "thank you." nel sat on
the edge of the little bed. "you've got a pretty room, a real
pretty room, miss peace." "you eat something funny
today?" "ma'am?" "some chop suey? think back." "no,
ma'am." "no? well, you gone be sick later on." "but i didn't
have no chop suey." "you think i come all the way over here
for you to tell me that? i can't make visits too often. you
should have some respect for old people." "but miss
peace, i'm visiting _you__. this is _your__ room." nel
smiled. "what you say your name was?" "

nel greene."
"wiley wright's girl?" "uh huh. you do remember. that
makes me feel good, miss peace. you remember me and
my father." "tell me how you killed that little boy." "what?
what little boy?" "the one you threw in the water. i got
oranges. how did you get him to go in the water?" "i didn't
throw no little boy in the river. that was sula." "you. sula.
what's the difference? you was there. you watched, didn't
you? me, i never would've watched." "you're confused, miss
peace. i'm nel. sula's dead." "it's awful cold in the water.
fire is warm. how did you get him in?" eva wet her
forefinger and tested the iron's heat. "who told you all these
lies? miss peace? who told you? why are you telling lies
on me?" "i got oranges. i don't drink they old orange juice.
they puts something in it." "why are you trying to make out
like i did it?" eva stopped ironing and looked at nel. for
the first time her eyes looked sane. "you think i'm guilty?"
nel was whispering. eva whispered back, "

who would
know that better than you?" "iwant to know who you been
talking to." nel forced herself to speak normally. "plum.
sweet plum. he tells me things." eva laughed a light, tinkly
giggle--girlish. "i'll be going now, miss peace." nel stood.
"you ain't answered me yet." "i don't know what you're
talking about." "just alike. both of you. never was no
difference between you. want some oranges? it's better for
you than chop suey. sula? i got oranges." nel walked
hurriedly down the hall, eva calling after her, "sula?" nel
couldn't see the other women today. that woman had upset
her. she handed her pass back to the lady, avoiding her
look of surprise. outside she fastened her coat against the
rising wind. the top button was missing so she covered her
throat with her hand. a bright space opened in her head
and memory seeped into it. standing on the riverbank in a
purple-and-white dress, sula swinging chicken little
around and around. his laughter b

efore the hand-slip and
the water closing quickly over the place. what had she felt
then, watching sula going around and around and then the
little boy swinging out over the water? sula had cried and
cried when she came back from shadrack's house. but nel
had remained calm. _"shouldn't we tell?"__ _"did he
see?"__ _"i don't know. no."__ _"let's go. we can't bring
him back."__ what did old eva mean by _you watched?__
how could she help seeing it? she was right there. but eva
didn't say _see,__ she said _watched.__ "i did not watch it.
i just saw it." but it was there anyway, as it had always
been, the old feeling and the old question. the good feeling
she had had when chicken's hands slipped. she hadn't
wondered about that in years. "why didn't i

she went in. sula was buried there along with
plum, hannah and now pearl. with the same disregard for
name changes by marriage that the black people of
medallion always showed, each flat slab had one word
carved on it. together they read like a chant: peace
1895–1921, peace 1890– 1923, peace 1910–1940,
peace 1892–1959. they were not dead people. they
were words. not even words. wishes, longings. all these
years she had been harboring good feelings about eva;
sharing, she believed, her loneliness and unloved state as
no one else could or did. she, after all, was the only one
who really understood why eva refused to attend sula's
funeral. the others thought they knew; thought the
grandmother's reasons were the same as their own--that to
pay respect to someone who had caused them so much
pain was beneath them. nel, who did go, believed eva's
refusal was not due to pride or vengeance but to a plain
unwillingness to see the swallowing of her own flesh into the
dirt, a determination not

 to let the eyes see what the heart
could not hold. now, however, after the way eva had just
treated her, accused her, she wondered if the townspeople
hadn't been right the first time. eva _was__ mean. sula had
even said so. there was no good reason for her to speak
so. feebleminded or not. old. whatever. eva knew what
she was doing. always had. she had stayed away from
sula's funeral and accused nel of drowning chicken little
for spite. the same spite that galloped all over the bottom.
that made every gesture an offense, every off-center smile
a threat, so that even the bubbles of relief that broke in the
chest of practically everybody when sula died did not
soften their spite and allow them to go to mr. hodges'
funeral parlor or send flowers from the church or bake a
yellow cake. she thought about nathan opening the
bedroom door the day she had visited her, and finding the
body. he said h

" when they heard. the day
passed and no one came. the night slipped into another
day and the body was still lying in eva's bed gazing at the
ceiling trying to complete a yawn. it was very strange, this
stubbornness about sula. for even when china, the most
rambunctious whore in the town, died (whose black son
and white son said, when they heard she was dying, "she
ain't dead yet?"), even then everybody stopped what they
were doing and turned out in numbers to put the fallen sister
away. it was nel who finally called the hospital, then the
mortuary, then the police, who were the ones to come. so
the white people took over. they came in a police van and
carried the body down the steps past the four pear trees
and into the van for all the world as with hannah. when the
police asked questions nobody gave them any information.
it took them hours to find out the dead woman's first name.
the call was for a miss peace at 7 carpenter's road. so
they left with that: a body, a name and an address.

the
white people had to wash her, dress her, prepare her and
finally lower her. it was all done elegantly, for it was
discovered that she had a substantial death policy. nel
went to the funeral parlor, but was so shocked by the closed
coffin she stayed only a few minutes. the following day nel
walked to the burying and found herself the only black
person there, steeling her mind to the roses and pulleys. it
was only when she turned to leave that she saw the cluster
of black folk at the lip of the cemetery. not coming in, not
dressed for mourning, but there waiting. not until the white
folks left--the gravediggers, mr. and mrs. hodges, and their
young son who assisted them--did those black people from
up in the bottom enter with hooded hearts and filed eyes to
sing "shall we gather at

 the river" over the curved earth
that cut them off from the most magnificent hatred they had
ever known. their question clotted the october air, shall
we gather at the river? the beautiful, the beautiful river?
perhaps sula answered them even then, for it began to
rain, and the women ran in tiny leaps through the grass for
fear their straightened hair would beat them home. sadly,
heavily, nel left the colored part of the cemetery. further
along the road shadrack passed her by. a little shaggier, a
little older, still energetically mad, he looked at the woman
hurrying along the road with the sunset in her face. he
stopped. trying to remember where he had seen her
before. the effort of recollection was too much for him and
he moved on. he had to haul some trash out at sunnydale
and it would be good and dark before he got home. he
hadn't sold fish in a long time now. the river had kill

all. no more silver-gray flashes, no more flat, wide,
unhurried look. no more slowing down of gills. no more
tremor on the line. shadrack and nel moved in opposite
directions, each thinking separate thoughts about the past.
the distance between them increased as they both
remembered gone things. suddenly nel stopped. her eye
twitched and burned a little. "sula?" she whispered, gazing
at the tops of trees. "sula?" leaves stirred; mud shifted;
there was the smell of overripe green things. a soft ball of
fur broke and scattered like dandelion spores in the
breeze. "all that time, all that time, i thought iwas missing
jude." and the loss pressed down on her chest and came
up into her throat. "we was girls together," she said as
though explaining something. "o lord, sula," she cried,
"girl, girl, girlgi
