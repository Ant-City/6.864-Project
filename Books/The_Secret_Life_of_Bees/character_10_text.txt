ot hungry," i said, and walked out the back 

door. 

crossing the back porch, i heard rosaleen say to 

him, "have you registered yourself to vote?"

on  sunday  i  thought  they  would  go  to  church, 
but no, they held a special service in the pink house, and 
people  came  to  them.  it  was  a  group  called  the  
daughters of mary, which august had organized.

the daughters of mary started showing up in the 
parlor before 10:00 a.m. first was an old woman named 
queenie  and  her  grown  daughter,  violet.  they  were 
dressed  alike in  bright yellow  skirts  and white  blouses, 
though  they  wore  different  hats,  at  least.  next  came 
lunelle,  mabelee,  and  cressie,  who  wore  the  fanciest 
hats i'd ever laid eyes on. 

it turned out lunelle was a hatmaker without the 
least bit of shyness. i'm talking about purple felt the size 
of  a  sombrero  with  fake  fruit  on  the  back.  that  was 
lunelle's. 

mabelee  wore  a  creation  of  tiger  fur  w

august  and  june,  hatless,  gloveless,  earbobless, 
looked  practically  poverty-stricken  next  to  them,  but 
may, good old may, had tied on a  bright blue hat with 
the brim up on one side and down on the other. 

august had brought in chairs and arranged them 
in a semicircle facing the wooden statue of mary. when 
we  were  all seated,  she  lit  the candle and june  played 
the cello. we said the hail marys together, queenie and 
violet  moving  strings  of  wooden  beads  through  their 
fingers. 

august  stood  up and said  she  was  glad me  and 
rosaleen were with them; then she opened a bible and 
read,  "and  mary  said…  behold,  from  henceforth  all 
generations shall call me blessed. for he that is mighty 
hath  done  to  me  great  things…  he  hath  scattered  the 
proud… he hath put down the mighty from their seats, 
and  exalted  them  of  low  degree.  he  hath  filled  the 
hungry  with  good

seaweed  on  the  ocean  floor.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat. 

when  they  swung  back  by,  queenie  and  violet 
joined them, then sugar-girl.  i wanted  to be  part of it, 
too,  but  i only watched,  and  so  did rosaleen and otis. 
june seemed to play faster and faster. i fanned my face, 
trying to get a little air, feeling light-headed. when the 
dance  ended,  the  daughters  stood  panting  in  a  half 
circle before our lady of chains, and what they did next

took  my  breath  away.  one  at  a  time  they  went  and  
touched the statue's fading red heart.

way into life." 

i leaned back in my chair, gazing at the sky, how 
endless  it  was,  the  way  it  fit  down  over  the  world  like 
the lid of a hive. i wished more than anything we could 
bury  may  in  a  beehive  tomb.  that  i  could,  myself,  lie  
down in one and be reborn.

when  the  daughters  of  mary  showed  up,  they 
were  loaded  down  with  food.  the  last  time  i'd  seen 
them,  queenie  and  her  daughter,  violet,  had  on  the 
smallest hats in the group, and this time they'd left them 
off completely. i think it was because queenie hated to 
cover the whiteness of her hair, which she was proud to 
have, and violet, who had to be forty at least, couldn't 
bring herself to wear a hat if her mother wasn't wearing 
one.  if  queenie  went  into  the  kitchen  and  stuck  her 
head in the oven, violet would go stick hers in, too.

  the  parlor  and  sat  with  may.  the  
daughters  passed  around  a  wooden  bowl  full  of 
something  they  called  manna.  a  salted  mixture  of 
sunflower,  sesame,  pumpkin,  and  pomegranate  seeds 
drizzled with honey and baked to perfection. they ate it 
by  the  handfuls,  saying  they  wouldn't  dream  of  sitting 
with  the  dead  without  eating  seeds.  seeds  kept  the 
living from despair, they explained. 

mabelee  said,  "she  looks  so  good—doesn't  she 

look good?" 

queenie snorted. "if she looks that good, maybe 
we ought to put her on display in the drive-by window at 
the funeral home." 

"oh, queenie!" cried mabelee. 
cressie noticed rosaleen and me sitting there in 
the  dark  and  said,  "the  funeral  home  in  town  has  a 
drive-by window. it used to be a bank." 

"nowadays they put the open casket right up in 
the window where we used to drive through and get our 
checks cashed," said queenie. "people can drive through 
and  pay  their  respects  without

sign." 

"you ain't serious," said rosaleen. 
"oh, yeah," queenie said. "we're serious." 
they might've been speaking the truth, but they 
didn't  look  serious.  they  were  falling  on  each  other 
laughing, and there was may, dead. 

lunelle  said,  "i  drove  in  there  one  time  to  see  
mrs. lamar after she passed, since i used to work for her 
way  back  when.  the  woman  who  sat  in  the  window 
beside her casket used to be the bank teller there, and 
when i drove off, she said, 'you have a nice day now.'" 

i  turned  to  august,  who  was  wip

thing  i'd  had  lots  of  experience  doing.  waiting  for  the 
girls  at  school  to  invite  me  somewhere.  for  t.  ray  to  
change his ways. for the police to show up and drag us

off  to  the  everglades  prison.  for  my  mother  to  send  a 
sign of love. 

zach  and  i  had  hung  around  outside  till  the 
daughters  of  mary  finished  in  the  honey  house.  we'd 
helped them clean up the mess in the yard, me stacking 
plates and cups and zach folding up card tables. queenie 
had smiled and said, "how come you two left before we 
finished?" 

"it got too long," said zach. 
"so that's what it was," she teased, and cressie 

giggled. 

when  zach  left,  i  slipped  back  into  the  honey 
house  and  retrieved  my  mother's  photograph  and  her 
black  mary  picture 
from  underneath  my  pillow. 
clutching them in my hands, i glided past the daughters 
as they finished up the dishes in the kitchen. they called 
to me, "where're you going, lily?"

got honey all in her hair, but it was lunelle who took the

cake with honey dripping off the ends of her elbows. she 
kept  trying  to  lick  it  off,  but  of  course  her  tongue  
couldn't reach that far. 

the ants started a single-file parade up the side 
of  our  lady,  drawn  by  the  honey,  and  not  to  be 
outdone, a handful of scout bees showed up and landed 
on our lady's head. let somebody bring out the honey 
and the insect kingdom will be there in no time. 

queenie said, "next i guess the honey bears will 

be joining us." 

i  actually  laughed  and,  spotting  a  honey-free 
place  near  the  base  of  the  statue,  worked  to  get  it  
covered up. 

our lady was covered with hands, every shade of 
brown and black, going in their own directions, but then 
the strangest thing started happening. gradually all our 
hands fell into the same movement, sliding up and down 
the  statue  in  long,  slow  strokes,  then  changing  to  a 
sideways motion, like a

aisle  of  rose  petals,  wearing  a  white 
rayon  suit  with  frog  closings  that  mabelee  was  sewing 
for  her.  i  could  not  picture  frog  closings.  june  drew  a 
picture of one on a tablet, and afterward i still could not 
picture them. lunelle had been commissioned to make 
her a wedding hat, which i thought was very courageous 
of  june.  there  was  no  telling  what  she  would  end  up 
with on her head. 

rosaleen  offered  to  bake  the  wedding  cake 
layers, and violet and queenie were going to decorate it 
with a "rainbow theme." 

again, all i can say is how brave june was. 
one  afternoon  i  went  to  the  kitchen  in  the 
middle of the afternoon, nearly dying of thirst, wanting 
to fill a jug with water and take it back to the river, and 
found  june  and  august  clinging  to  each  other  in  the 
middle of the floor. 

i  stood  outside  the  door  and  watched,  even 
though it was a private moment. june gripped august's 
back, and her hands trembled. 

"may  w

 i don't even know these damn people." he seemed 
to  struggle  to  make  his  words  forceful  enough.  the 
anger had been washed out of him when he'd dropped 
the knife. 

"i  know  them,"  i  said.  "august  boatwright  is  a 

good person." 

"what makes you think she would even want you 

here?"

"lily  can  have  a  home  here  for  as  long  as  she  
wants,"  august  said,  stepping  into  the  room,  rosaleen 
right beside her. i went and stood with them. outside, i 
heard  queenie's  car  pull  into  the  driveway.  it  had  a 
muffler  you  couldn't  mistake.  apparently  august  had 
called the daughters. 

"lily said you'd run off," t. ray said to rosaleen. 
"well, i guess i'm back now," she said. 
"i don't care where the hell you are or where you 

end up," he said to her. "but lily's coming with me." 

even as he said it, i could tell he didn't want me, 
didn't  want  me  back  on  the  farm,  didn't  want  to  be 
reminded of her. another part of him—the good par

it  was  pride  now,  all  pride.  how  could  he  back  

down? 

the  front  door  opened,  and  queenie,  violet, 
lunelle,  and  mabelee  stumbled  into  the  house,  all 
wound  up  and  looking  like  they  had  their  clothes  on 
backward. queenie stared at my cheek. 

"everybody all right?" she said, out of breath. 
"we're all right," said august. "this is mr. owens, 

lily's father. he came for a visit." 

"i didn't get an answer at sugar-girl's or cressie's 

house,"

us,  clutching their  pocketbooks  up against their  bodies 
like they might have to use them to beat the living hell 
out of somebody. 

i wondered how we must look to him. a bunch of 
women—mabelee four

straight  up  on  her  head  begging  to  be  braided,  violet 
muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenie—tough  old 
queenie—with her hands on her hips and her lip shoved 
out, every inch of her saying, i double-dog dare you to 
take this girl. 

t. ray sniffed hard and looked at the ceiling. his 
resolve  was  crumbling  all  around  him.  you  could 
practically see bits of it flaking off. 

august  saw 

it,  too.  she  stepped  forward. 
sometimes i forgot how tall she was. "mr. owens, you

in the autumn south carolina changed her color 
to  ruby  red  and  wild  shades  of  orange.  i  watch  them 
now from my upstairs room, the room june left behind 
when  she  got  married  last  month.  i  could  not  have 
dreamed such a room. august bought me a new bed and 
a dressing table, white french provincial from the sears 
and  roebuck  catalog.  violet  and  queenie  donated  a 
flowered rug that had been laying around in their extra 
room  going  to  waste,  and  mabelee  sewed  blue-and-
white  polka  dot  curtains  for  the  windows  with  fringe 
balls along the hem. cressie crocheted four eight-legged 
octopuses out of various colors of yarn to sit on the bed. 
one  octopus  would  have  been  enough  for  me,  but  it's 
the only handicraft cressie knows how to do, so she just 
keeps doing it. 

lunelle created me a hat that outdid every other 
hat
