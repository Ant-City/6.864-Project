one summer afternoon mrs oedipa maas came home from a tupperware party whose hostess had put perhaps too much 
kirsch in the fondue to find that she, oedipa, had been named executor, or she supposed executrix, of the estate of one 
pierce inverarity, a california real estate mogul who had once lost two million collars in his spare time but still had assets 
numerous and tangled enough to make the job of sorting it all out more than honorary. oedipa stood in the living room, 
stared at by the greenish dead eye of the tv tube, spoke the name of god, tried to feel as drunk as possible. but this did not 
work. she thought of a hotel room in mazatlan whose door had just been slammed, it seemed forever, waking up two 
hundred birds down in the l

timately the books and the business, go through probate, collect all 

debts, inventory the assets, get an appraisal of the estate, decide what to liquidate and 
what to hold on to, pay off claims, square away taxes, distribute legacies . . . 

"hey," said oedipa, "can't i get somebody to do it forme?" 
"me," said roseman, "some of it, sure. but aren't you even interested?" 

"in what?" 
"in what you might find out." 

as things developed, she was to have all manner of revelations. hardly about pierce inverarity, or herself; but about what 
remained yet had somehow, before this, stayed away. there had hung the sense of buffering, insulation, she had noticed the 
absence of an intensity, as if watching a movie, just perceptibly out of focus, that the projectionist refused to fix. and had also 
gently conned herself into the curious, rapunzel-like role of a pensive girl somehow, magically, prisoner among the pines and salt 
fogs of kinneret, looking for somebody to say hey, let down your hair. when it tu

had been typically hollywood: they didn't look or act a bit alike. 

"so," said di presso, "who's tony jaguar. very big in cosa nostra, is who." 
"you're an actor," said metzger. "how are you in with them?" 
"i'm a lawyer again," di presso said. "that pilot will never be bought, metz, not unless you go out and do something really 

darrowlike, spectacular. arouse public interest, maybe with a sensational defense." 
"like what." 

"like win the litigation i'm bringing against the estate of pierce inverarity." metzger, as much as cool metzger could, goggled. 

di presso laughed and punched metzger in the shoulder. "that's right, good buddy." 

"who wants what? you better talk to the other executor too." he introduced oedipa, di presso tipping his shades politely. the 
air suddenly went cold, the sun was blotted out. the three looked up in alarm to see looming over them and about to collide the pale 
green social hall, its towering pointed windows, wrought-iron floral embellishments, solid silence,

ok. it's unavoidable, isn't it? every access route to the tristero could be traced also back to the inverarity estate. even 
emory bortz, with his copy of blobb's peregrinations (bought, she had no doubt he'd tell her in the event she asked, also at 
zapf's), taught now at san narciso college, heavily endowed by the dead man. 

meaning what? that bortz, along with metzger, cohen, driblette, koteks, the tattooed sailor in san francisco, the 
w.a.s.t.e. carriers she'd seen—that all of them were pierce inverarity's men? bought? or loyal, for free, for fun, to some 
grandiose practical joke he'd cooked up, all for her embarrassment, or terrorizing, or moral improvement? 

change your name to miles, dean, serge, and /or leonard, baby, she advised her reflection in the hall; light of that 

afternoon's vanity mirror. either way, they'll call it paranoia. they. either you have stumbled indeed, without the aid of lsd 
or other indole alkaloids, onto a secret richness and concealed density of dream; onto a ne

 and tried to face toward the sea. but she'd lost her bearings. she turned, pivoting on one stacked heel, could find no 
mountains either. as if there could be no barriers between herself and the rest of the land. san narciso at that moment lost (the 
loss pure, instant, spherical, the sound of a stainless orchestral chime held among the stars and struck lightly), gave up its 
residue of uniqueness for her; became a name again, was assumed back into the american continuity of crust and mantle. 
pierce inverarity was really dead. 
she walked down a stretch of railroad track next the highway. spurs ran off here and there into factory property. pierce may have 
owned these factories too. but did it matter now if he'd owned all of san narciso? san narciso was a name; an incident among our 
climatic records of dreams and what dreams became among our accumulated daylight, a moment's squall-line or tornado's touchdown 
among the higher, more continental solemnities—storm-systems of group suffering and need,
