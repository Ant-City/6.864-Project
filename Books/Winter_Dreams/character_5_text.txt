lways on tap for the thursday or saturday parties and who filled in at dinners with the younger married set. already he was playing with the idea of going east to new york. he wanted to take judy jones with him. no disillusion as to the world in which she had grown up could cure his illusion as to her desirability.

remember that--for only in the light of it can what he did for her be understood.

eighteen months after he first met judy jones he became engaged to another girl. her name was irene scheerer, and her father was one of the men who had always believed in dexter. irene was light-haired and sweet and honorable, and a little stout, and she had two suitors whom she pleasantly relinquished when dexter formally asked her to marry him.

summer, fall, winter, spring, another summer, another fall--so much he had given of his active life to the incorrigible lips of judy jones. she had treated him with interest, with encouragement, with malice, with indifference, with contempt. she had inflicte

ed hard and late, and at night he went to his office and plotted out his years.

at the end of a week he went to a dance and cut in on her once. for almost the first time since they had met he did not ask her to sit out with him or tell her that she was lovely. it hurt him that she did not miss these things--that was all. he was not jealous when he saw that there was a new man to-night. he had been hardened against jealousy long before.

he stayed late at the dance. he sat for an hour with irene scheerer and talked about books and about music. he knew very little about either. but he was beginning to be master of his own time now, and he had a rather priggish notion that he--the young and already fabulously successful dexter green--should know more about such things.

that was in october, when he was twenty-five. in january, dexter and irene became engaged. it was to be announced in june, and they were to be married three months later.

the minnesota winter prolonged itself interminably, and it

lmost may when the winds came soft and the snow ran down into black bear lake at last. for the first time in over a year dexter was enjoying a certain tranquility of spirit. judy jones had been in florida, and afterward in hot springs, and somewhere she had been engaged, and somewhere she had broken it off. at first, when dexter had definitely given her up, it had made him sad that people still linked them together and asked for news of her, but when he began to be placed at dinner next to irene scheerer people didn't ask him about her any more--they told him about her. he ceased to be an authority on her.

may at last. dexter walked the streets at night when the darkness was damp as rain, wondering that so soon, with so little done, so much of ecstasy had gone from him. may one year back had been marked by judy's poignant, unforgivable, yet forgiven turbulence--it had been one of those rare times when he fancied she had grown to care for him. that old penny's worth of happiness he had spent fo

r balanced for a few days on the thin bridge that led to deep summer he turned in one night at irene's house. their engagement was to be announced in a week now--no one would be surprised at it. and to-night they would sit together on the lounge at the university club and look on for an hour at the dancers. it gave him a sense of solidity to go with her--she was so sturdily popular, so intensely "great."

he mounted the steps of the brownstone house and stepped inside.

"irene," he called.

mrs. scheerer came out of the living-room to meet him.

"dexter," she said, "irene's gone up-stairs with a splitting headache. she wanted to go with you but i made her go to bed."

"nothing serious, i--"

"oh, no. she's going to play golf with you in the morning. you can spare her for just one night, can't you, dexter?"

her smile was kind. she and dexter liked each other. in the living-room he talked for a moment before he said good-night.

returning to the university club, where he had rooms, he stood in t

 or pugilistic youth lounged in front of pool halls. the clink of glasses and the slap of hands on the bars issued from saloons, cloisters of glazed glass and dirty yellow light.

she was watching him closely and the silence was embarrassing, yet in this crisis he could find no casual word with which to profane the hour. at a convenient turning he began to zigzag back toward the university club.

"have you missed me?" she asked suddenly.

"everybody missed you."

he wondered if she knew of irene scheerer. she had been back only a day--her absence had been almost contemporaneous with his engagement.

"what a remark!" judy laughed sadly--without sadness. she looked at him searchingly. he became absorbed in the dashboard.

"you're handsomer than you used to be," she said thoughtfully. "dexter, you have the most rememberable eyes."

he could have laughed at this, but he did not laugh. it was the sort of thing that was said to sophomores. yet it stabbed at him.

"i'm awfully tired of everything, dar

 not a matter of any moment but rather something to be brushed aside lightly.

"of course you could never love anybody but me," she continued. "i like the way you love me. oh, dexter, have you forgotten last year?"

"no, i haven't forgotten."

"neither have i!"

was she sincerely moved--or was she carried along by the wave of her own acting?

"i wish we could be like that again," she said, and he forced himself to answer:

"i don't think we can."

"i suppose not. . . . i hear you're giving irene scheerer a violent rush."

there was not the faintest emphasis on the name, yet dexter was suddenly ashamed.

"oh, take me home," cried judy suddenly; "i don't want to go back to that idiotic dance--with those children."

then, as he turned up the street that led to the residence district, judy began to cry quietly to herself. he had never seen her cry before.

the dark street lightened, the dwellings of the rich loomed up around them, he stopped his coup√© in front of the great white bulk of the mortim

"won't you come in?" he heard her draw in her breath sharply.

"all right," his voice was trembling, "i'll come in."



v



it was strange that neither when it was over nor a long time afterward did he regret that night. looking at it from the perspective of ten years, the fact that judy's flare for him endured just one month seemed of little importance. nor did it matter that by his yielding he subjected himself to a deeper agony in the end and gave serious hurt to irene scheerer and to irene's parents, who had befriended him. there was nothing sufficiently pictorial about irene's grief to stamp itself on his mind.

dexter was at bottom hard-minded. the attitude of the city on his action was of no importance to him, not because he was going to leave the city, but because any outside attitude on the situation seemed superficial. he was completely indifferent to popular opinion. nor, when he had seen that it was no use, that he did not possess in himself the power to move
