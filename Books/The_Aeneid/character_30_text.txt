  what first aeneas this place beheld,
  reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.
  for while, expecting there the queen, he rais'd
  his wond'ring eyes, and round the temple gaz'd,
  admir'd the fortune of the rising town,
  the striving artists, and their arts' renown;
  he saw, in order painted on the wall,
  whatever did unhappy troy befall:
  the wars that fame around the world had blown,
  all to the life, and ev'ry leader known.
  there agamemnon, priam here, he spies,
  and fierce achilles, who both kings defies.
  he stopp'd, and weeping said: "o friend! ev'n here
  the monuments of trojan woes appear!
  our known disasters fill ev'n foreign lands:
  see there, where old unhappy priam stands!
  ev'n the mute walls relate the warrior's fame,
  and trojan griefs the tyrians' pity claim."
  he said (his tears a ready passage find),
  devouring what he saw so well design'd,
  and with an empty picture fed his mind:
  for there he saw the fainting grecians yield,

ling trojans quit the field,
  pursued by fierce achilles thro' the plain,
  on his high chariot driving o'er the slain.
  the tents of rhesus next his grief renew,
  by their white sails betray'd to nightly view;
  and wakeful diomede, whose cruel sword
  the sentries slew, nor spar'd their slumb'ring lord,
  then took the fiery steeds, ere yet the food
  of troy they taste, or drink the xanthian flood.
  elsewhere he saw where troilus defied
  achilles, and unequal combat tried;
  then, where the boy disarm'd, with loosen'd reins,
  was by his horses hurried o'er the plains,
  hung by the neck and hair, and dragg'd around:
  the hostile spear, yet sticking in his wound,
  with tracks of blood inscrib'd the dusty ground.
  meantime the trojan dames, oppress'd with woe,
  to pallas' fane in long procession go,
  in hopes to reconcile their heav'nly foe.
  they weep, they beat their breasts, they rend their hair,
  and rich embroider'd vests for

  but the stern goddess stands unmov'd with pray'r.
  thrice round the trojan walls achilles drew
  the corpse of hector, whom in fight he slew.
  here priam sues; and there, for sums of gold,
  the lifeless body of his son is sold.
  so sad an object, and so well express'd,
  drew sighs and groans from the griev'd hero's breast,
  to see the figure of his lifeless friend,
  and his old sire his helpless hand extend.
  himself he saw amidst the grecian train,
  mix'd in the bloody battle on the plain;
  and swarthy memnon in his arms he knew,
  his pompous ensigns, and his indian crew.

  with peals of shouts the tyrians praise the song:
  those peals are echo'd by the trojan throng.
  th' unhappy queen with talk prolong'd the night,
  and drank large draughts of love with vast delight;
  of priam much enquir'd, of hector more;
  then ask'd what arms the swarthy memnon wore,
  what troops he landed on the trojan shore;
  the steeds of diomede varied the discourse,
  and fierce achilles, with his matchless force;
  at length, as fate and her ill stars requir'd,
  to hear the series of the war desir'd.
  "relate at large, my godlike guest," she said,
  "the grecian stratagems, the town betray'd:
  the fatal issue of so long a war,
  your flight, your wand'rings, and your woes, declare;
  for, since on ev'ry sea, on ev'ry coast,
  your men have been distress'd, your navy toss'd,

  with eyes dejected, in a lowly tone,
  after a modest pause she thus begun:

  nor this the chariot where achilles rode;
  nor venus' veil is here, near neptune's shield;
  thy fatal hour is come, and this the field."
  thus liger vainly vaunts: the trojan peer
  return'd his answer with his flying spear.

  prone to the wheels, and his left foot protends,
