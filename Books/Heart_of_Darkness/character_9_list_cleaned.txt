[CHARACTER] - 
a fiercely beautiful woman loaded with jewelry who
appears on the shore when marlow's steamer arrives at and leaves
the inner station. she seems to exert an undue influence over both
kurtz and the natives around the station, and the russian trader points
her out as someone to fear. like kurtz, she is an enigma: she never
speaks to marlow, and he never learns anything more about her.
