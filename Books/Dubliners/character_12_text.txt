ade awkward not merely because allusions of that kind always made her awkward but also because she did not wish it to be thought that in her wise innocence she had divined the intention behind her mother’s tolerance.
mrs mooney glanced instinctively at the little gilt clock on the mantelpiece as soon as she had become aware through her revery that the bells of george’s church had stopped ringing. it was seventeen minutes past eleven: she would have lots of time to have the matter out with mr doran and then catch short twelve at marlborough street. she was sure she would win. to begin with she had all the weight of social opinion on her side: she was an outraged mother. she had allowed him to live beneath her roof, assuming that he was a man of honour, and he had simply abused her hospitality. he was thirty-four or thirty-five years of age, so that youth could not be pleaded as his excuse; nor could ignorance be his excuse since he was a man who had seen something of the world. he had sim

ration would he make?
there must be reparation made in such cases. it is all very well for the man: he can go his ways as if nothing had happened, having had his moment of pleasure, but the girl has to bear the brunt. some mothers would be content to patch up such an affair for a sum of money; she had known cases of it. but she would not do so. for her only one reparation could make up for the loss of her daughter’s honour: marriage.
she counted all her cards again before sending mary up to mr doran’s room to say that she wished to speak with him. she felt sure she would win. he was a serious young man, not rakish or loud-voiced like the others. if it had been mr sheridan or mr meade or bantam lyons her task would have been much harder. she did not think he would face publicity. all the lodgers in the house knew something of the affair; details had been invented by some. besides, he had been employed for thirteen years in a great catholic wine-merchant’s office and publicity would mean

 for him, perhaps, the loss of his job. whereas if he agreed all might be well. she knew he had a good screw for one thing and she suspected he had a bit of stuff put by.
nearly the half-hour! she stood up and surveyed herself in the pier-glass. the decisive expression of her great florid face satisfied her and she thought of some mothers she knew who could not get their daughters off their hands.
mr doran was very anxious indeed this sunday morning. he had made two attempts to shave but his hand had been so unsteady that he had been obliged to desist. three days’ reddish beard fringed his jaws and every two or three minutes a mist gathered on his glasses so that he had to take them off and polish them with his pocket-handkerchief. the recollection of his confession of the night before was a cause of acute pain to him; the priest had drawn out every ridiculous detail of the affair and in the en

d had so magnified his sin that he was almost thankful at being afforded a loophole of reparation. the harm was done. what could he do now but marry her or run away? he could not brazen it out. the affair would be sure to be talked of and his employer would be certain to hear of it. dublin is such a small city: everyone knows everyone else’s business. he felt his heart leap warmly in his throat as he heard in his excited imagination old mr leonard calling out in his rasping voice: “send mr doran here, please.”
all his long years of service gone for nothing! all his industry and diligence thrown away! as a young man he had sown his wild oats, of course; he had boasted of his free-thinking and denied the existence of god to his companions in public-houses. but that was all passed and done with ... nearly. he still bought a copy of reynolds’s newspaper every week but he attended to his religious duties and for nine-tenths of the year lived a regular life. he had money enough to settle

rie. there was no longer any perturbation visible on her face.
she waited on patiently, almost cheerfully, without alarm, her memories gradually giving place to hopes and visions of the future. her hopes and visions were so intricate that she no longer saw the white pillows on which her gaze was fixed or remembered that she was waiting for anything.
at last she heard her mother calling. she started to her feet and ran to the banisters.
“polly! polly!”
“yes, mamma?”
“come down, dear. mr doran wants to speak to you.”
then she remembered what she had been waiting for.




a little cloud

eight years before he had seen his friend off at the north wall and wished him godspeed. gallaher had got on. you could tell that at once by his travelled air, his well-cut tweed suit, and fearless accent. few fellows had talents like his and fewer still could remain unspoiled by such success. gallaher’s heart was in the right place and he had deserved to win. it was something to have a friend lik
