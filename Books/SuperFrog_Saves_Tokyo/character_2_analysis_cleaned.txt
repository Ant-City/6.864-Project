[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is the enemy in "super-frog saves tokyo," but he's not a true villain. frog knows that [CHARACTER] must be stopped to save the citizens of tokyo, but he doesn't necessarily believe that [CHARACTER] is evil or that [CHARACTER] doesn't have a right to exist. even though he has a frightful appearance and is prone to violence, [CHARACTER] is as morally neutral as an actual earthquake. in fact, frog's description of [CHARACTER]'s awakening seems to place some of the blame on human beings, because it is the clamor and tumult of the city itself that produces [CHARACTER]'s rage. the figure of [CHARACTER] evokes the two tragedies japan suffered in 1995, both of which took place deep underground. frog claims that the kobe earthquake in january 1995 pushed [CHARACTER]'s patience over the limit, while the pointed comparison of [CHARACTER] and a commuter train evokes the aum shirinkyo subway tragedy of march 1995.
