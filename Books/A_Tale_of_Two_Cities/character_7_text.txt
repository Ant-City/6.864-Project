what are you up to? at it again?”

his wife explained that she had merely “asked a blessing.”

“don’t do it!” said mr. crunches looking about, as if he rather expected
to see the loaf disappear under the efficacy of his wife’s petitions. “i
ain’t a going to be blest out of house and home. i won’t have my wittles
blest off my table. keep still!”

exceedingly red-eyed and grim, as if he had been up all night at a party
which had taken anything but a convivial turn, jerry cruncher worried
his breakfast rather than ate it, growling over it like any four-footed
inmate of a menagerie. towards nine o’clock he smoothed his ruffled
aspect, and, presenting as respectable and business-like an exterior as
he could overlay his natural self with, issued forth to the occupation
of the day.

it could scarcely be called a trade, in spite of his favourite
description of himself as “a honest tradesman.” his stock consisted of
a wooden stool, made out of a broken-backed ch

nd out the door he sought, and handed in
his letter through a trap in it. for, people then paid to see the play
at the old bailey, just as they paid to see the play in bedlam--only the
former entertainment was much the dearer. therefore, all the old bailey
doors were well guarded--except, indeed, the social doors by which the
criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.

after some delay and demur, the door grudgingly turned on its hinges a
very little way, and allowed mr. jerry cruncher to squeeze himself into
court.

“what’s on?” he asked, in a whisper, of the man he found himself next
to.

“nothing yet.”

“what’s coming on?”

“the treason case.”

“the quartering one, eh?”

“ah!” returned the man, with a relish; “he’ll be drawn on a hurdle to
be half hanged, and then he’ll be taken down and sliced before his own
face, and then his inside will be taken out and burnt while he looks on,
and then his head will be chopped off, and

y had already got the length of opening the hearse to take the coffin
out, when some brighter genius proposed instead, its being escorted to
its destination amidst general rejoicing. practical suggestions being
much needed, this suggestion, too, was received with acclamation, and
the coach was immediately filled with eight inside and a dozen out,
while as many people got on the roof of the hearse as could by any
exercise of ingenuity stick upon it. among the first of these volunteers
was jerry cruncher himself, who modestly concealed his spiky head from
the observation of tellson’s, in the further corner of the mourning
coach.

the officiating undertakers made some protest against these changes in
the ceremonies; but, the river being alarmingly near, and several voices
remarking on the efficacy of cold immersion in bringing refractory
members of the profession to reason, the protest was faint and brief.
the remodelled procession started, with a chimney-sweep driving the

mr. lorry) had become their daily retainer, and had his bed there every
night.

it was an ordinance of the republic one and indivisible of liberty,
equality, fraternity, or death, that on the door or doorpost of every
house, the name of every inmate must be legibly inscribed in letters
of a certain size, at a certain convenient height from the ground. mr.
jerry cruncher’s name, therefore, duly embellished the doorpost down
below; and, as the afternoon shadows deepened, the owner of that name
himself appeared, from overlooking a painter whom doctor manette had
employed to add to the list the name of charles evremonde, called
darnay.

in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. in the doctor’s little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
