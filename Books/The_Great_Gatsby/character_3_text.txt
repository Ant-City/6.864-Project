know mr. gatsby it was a mansion inhabited by a gentleman of that name. my own house was an eye-sore, but it was a small eye-sore, and it had been overlooked, so i had a view of the water, a partial view of my neighbor's lawn, and the consoling proximity of millionaires--all for eighty dollars a month.

across the courtesy bay the white palaces of fashionable east egg glittered along the water, and the history of the summer really begins on the evening i drove over there to have dinner with the tom buchanans. daisy was my second cousin once removed and i'd known tom in college. and just after the war i spent two days with them in chicago.

her husband, among various physical accomplishments, had been one of the most powerful ends that ever played football at new haven--a national figure in a way, one of those men who reach such an acute limited excellence at twenty-one that everything afterward savors of anti-climax. his family were enormously wealthy--even in college his freedom with money was a

 was even more elaborate than i expected, a cheerful red and white georgian colonial mansion overlooking the bay. the lawn started at the beach and ran toward the front door for a quarter of a mile, jumping over sun-dials and brick walks and burning gardens--finally when it reached the house drifting up the side in bright vines as though from the momentum of its run. the front was broken by a line of french windows, glowing now with reflected gold, and wide open to the warm windy afternoon, and tom buchanan in riding clothes was standing with his legs apart on the front porch.

he had changed since his new haven years. now he was a sturdy, straw haired man of thirty with a rather hard mouth and a supercilious manner. two shining, arrogant eyes had established dominance over his face and gave him the appearance of always leaning aggressively forward. not even the effeminate swank of his riding clothes could hide the enormous power of that body--he seemed to fill those glistening boots until he stra

d rug, making a shadow on it as wind does on the sea.

the only completely stationary object in the room was an enormous couch on which two young women were buoyed up as though upon an anchored balloon. they were both in white and their dresses were rippling and fluttering as if they had just been blown back in after a short flight around the house. i must have stood for a few moments listening to the whip and snap of the curtains and the groan of a picture on the wall. then there was a boom as tom buchanan shut the rear windows and the caught wind died out about the room and the curtains and the rugs and the two young women ballooned slowly to the floor.

the younger of the two was a stranger to me. she was extended full length at her end of the divan, completely motionless and with her chin raised a little as if she were balancing something on it which was quite likely to fall. if she saw me out of the corner of her eyes she gave no hint of it--indeed, i was almost surprised into murmuring an ap

how a dozen people had sent their love through me.

"do they miss me?" she cried ecstatically.

"the whole town is desolate. all the cars have the left rear wheel painted black as a mourning wreath and there's a persistent wail all night along the north shore."

"how gorgeous! let's go back, tom. tomorrow!" then she added irrelevantly, "you ought to see the baby."

"i'd like to."

"she's asleep. she's two years old. haven't you ever seen her?"

"never."

"well, you ought to see her. she's----"

tom buchanan who had been hovering restlessly about the room stopped and rested his hand on my shoulder.

"what you doing, nick?"

"i'm a bond man."

"who with?"

i told him.

"never heard of them," he remarked decisively.

this annoyed me.

"you will," i answered shortly. "you will if you stay in the east."

"oh, i'll stay in the east, don't you worry," he said, glancing at daisy and then back at me, as if he were alert for something more. "i'd be a god damned fool to live anywhere else."

g cadet. her grey sun-strained eyes looked back at me with polite reciprocal curiosity out of a wan, charming discontented face. it occurred to me now that i had seen her, or a picture of her, somewhere before.

"you live in west egg," she remarked contemptuously. "i know somebody there."

"i don't know a single----"

"you must know gatsby."

"gatsby?" demanded daisy. "what gatsby?"

before i could reply that he was my neighbor dinner was announced; wedging his tense arm imperatively under mine tom buchanan compelled me from the room as though he were moving a checker to another square.

slenderly, languidly, their hands set lightly on their hips the two young women preceded us out onto a rosy-colored porch open toward the sunset where four candles flickered on the table in the diminished wind.

"why candles?" objected daisy, frowning. she snapped them out with her fingers. "in two weeks it'll be the longest day in the year." she looked at us all radiantly. "do you always watch for the longest day

nd then sank down himself into eternal blindness or forgot them and moved away. but his eyes, dimmed a little by many paintless days under sun and rain, brood on over the solemn dumping ground.

the valley of ashes is bounded on one side by a small foul river, and when the drawbridge is up to let barges through, the passengers on waiting trains can stare at the dismal scene for as long as half an hour. there is always a halt there of at least a minute and it was because of this that i first met tom buchanan's mistress.

the fact that he had one was insisted upon wherever he was known. his acquaintances resented the fact that he turned up in popular restaurants with her and, leaving her at a table, sauntered about, chatting with whomsoever he knew. though i was curious to see her i had no desire to meet her--but i did. i went up to new york with tom on the train one afternoon and when we stopped by the ashheaps he jumped to his feet and taking hold of my elbow literally forced me from the car.

ilson emerged with two chairs from his office door.

we waited for her down the road and out of sight. it was a few days before the fourth of july, and a grey, scrawny italian child was setting torpedoes in a row along the railroad track.

"terrible place, isn't it," said tom, exchanging a frown with doctor eckleburg.

"awful."

"it does her good to get away."

"doesn't her husband object?"

"wilson? he thinks she goes to see her sister in new york. he's so dumb he doesn't know he's alive."

so tom buchanan and his girl and i went up together to new york--or not quite together, for mrs. wilson sat discreetly in another car. tom deferred that much to the sensibilities of those east eggers who might be on the train.

she had changed her dress to a brown figured muslin which stretched tight over her rather wide hips as tom helped her to the platform in new york. at the news-stand she bought a copy of "town tattle" and a moving-picture magazine and, in the station drug store, some cold cream and a sma

from over her eyes and looked back at us with a brilliant smile. mr. mckee regarded her intently with his head on one side and then moved his hand back and forth slowly in front of his face.

"i should change the light," he said after a moment. "i'd like to bring out the modelling of the features. and i'd try to get hold of all the back hair."

"i wouldn't think of changing the light," cried mrs. mckee. "i think it's----"

her husband said "sh! " and we all looked at the subject again whereupon tom buchanan yawned audibly and got to his feet.

"you mckees have something to drink," he said. "get some more ice and mineral water, myrtle, before everybody goes to sleep."

"i told that boy about the ice." myrtle raised her eyebrows in despair at the shiftlessness of the lower orders. "these people! you have to keep after them all the time."

she looked at me and laughed pointlessly. then she flounced over to the dog, kissed it with ecstasy and swept into the kitchen, implying that a dozen chefs awaited

ir with his fists clenched in his lap, like a photograph of a man of action. taking out my handkerchief i wiped from his cheek the remains of the spot of dried lather that had worried me all the afternoon.

the little dog was sitting on the table looking with blind eyes through the smoke and from time to time groaning faintly. people disappeared, reappeared, made plans to go somewhere, and then lost each other, searched for each other, found each other a few feet away. some time toward midnight tom buchanan and mrs. wilson stood face to face discussing in impassioned voices whether mrs. wilson had any right to mention daisy's name.

"daisy! daisy! daisy!" shouted mrs. wilson. "i'll say it whenever i want to! daisy! dai----"

making a short deft movement tom buchanan broke her nose with his open hand.

then there were bloody towels upon the bathroom floor, and women's voices scolding, and high over the confusion a long broken wail of pain. mr. mckee awoke from his doze and started in a daze toward

all i would have thought of it as a thing that merely happened, the end of some inevitable chain. it never occurred to me that one man could start to play with the faith of fifty million people--with the single-mindedness of a burglar blowing a safe.

"how did he happen to do that?" i asked after a minute.

"he just saw the opportunity."

"why isn't he in jail?"

"they can't get him, old sport. he's a smart man."

i insisted on paying the check. as the waiter brought my change i caught sight of tom buchanan across the crowded room.

"come along with me for a minute," i said. "i've got to say hello to someone."

when he saw us tom jumped up and took half a dozen steps in our direction.

"where've you been?" he demanded eagerly. "daisy's furious because you haven't called up."

"this is mr. gatsby, mr. buchanan."

they shook hands briefly and a strained, unfamiliar look of embarrassment came over gatsby's face.

"how've you been, anyhow?" demanded tom of me. "how'd you happen to come up this far to

ork and say goodbye to a soldier who was going overseas. she was effectually prevented, but she wasn't on speaking terms with her family for several weeks. after that she didn't play around with the soldiers any more but only with a few flat-footed, short-sighted young men in town who couldn't get into the army at all.

by the next autumn she was gay again, gay as ever. she had a debut after the armistice, and in february she was presumably engaged to a man from new orleans. in june she married tom buchanan of chicago with more pomp and circumstance than louisville ever knew before. he came down with a hundred people in four private cars and hired a whole floor of the seelbach hotel, and the day before the wedding he gave her a string of pearls valued at three hundred and fifty thousand dollars.

i was bridesmaid. i came into her room half an hour before the bridal dinner, and found her lying on her bed as lovely as the june night in her flowered dress--and as drunk as a monkey. she had a bottle o

her into a cold bath. she wouldn't let go of the letter. she took it into the tub with her and squeezed it up into a wet ball, and only let me leave it in the soap dish when she saw that it was coming to pieces like snow.

but she didn't say another word. we gave her spirits of ammonia and put ice on her forehead and hooked her back into her dress and half an hour later when we walked out of the room the pearls were around her neck and the incident was over. next day at five o'clock she married tom buchanan without so much as a shiver and started off on a three months' trip to the south seas.

i saw them in santa barbara when they came back and i thought i'd never seen a girl so mad about her husband. if he left the room for a minute she'd look around uneasily and say "where's tom gone?" and wear the most abstracted expression until she saw him coming in the door. she used to sit on the sand with his head in her lap by the hour rubbing her fingers over his eyes and looking at him with unfathomable

hrase began to beat in my ears with a sort of heady excitement: "there are only the pursued, the pursuing, the busy and the tired."

"and daisy ought to have something in her life," murmured jordan to me.

"does she want to see gatsby?"

"she's not to know about it. gatsby doesn't want her to know. you're just supposed to invite her to tea."

we passed a barrier of dark trees, and then the facade of fifty-ninth street, a block of delicate pale light, beamed down into the park. unlike gatsby and tom buchanan i had no girl whose disembodied face floated along the dark cornices and blinding signs and so i drew up the girl beside me, tightening my arms. her wan, scornful mouth smiled and so i drew her up again, closer, this time to my face.

ing and nothing about him. so i take advantage of this short halt, while gatsby, so to speak, caught his breath, to clear this set of misconceptions away.

it was a halt, too, in my association with his affairs. for several weeks i didn't see him or hear his voice on the phone--mostly i was in new york, trotting around with jordan and trying to ingratiate myself with her senile aunt--but finally i went over to his house one sunday afternoon. i hadn't been there two minutes when somebody brought tom buchanan in for a drink. i was startled, naturally, but the really surprising thing was that it hadn't happened before.

they were a party of three on horseback--tom and a man named sloane and a pretty woman in a brown riding habit who had been there previously.

"i'm delighted to see you," said gatsby standing on his porch. "i'm delighted that you dropped in."

as though they cared!

"sit right down. have a cigarette or a cigar." he walked around the room quickly, ringing bells. "i'll have something to

its senselessness into forms.

"i've heard of making a garage out of a stable," tom was saying to gatsby, "but i'm the first man who ever made a stable out of a garage."

"who wants to go to town?" demanded daisy insistently. gatsby's eyes floated toward her. "ah," she cried, "you look so cool."

their eyes met, and they stared together at each other, alone in space. with an effort she glanced down at the table.

"you always look so cool," she repeated.

she had told him that she loved him, and tom buchanan saw. he was astounded. his mouth opened a little and he looked at gatsby and then back at daisy as if he had just recognized her as some one he knew a long time ago.

"you resemble the advertisement of the man," she went on innocently. "you know the advertisement of the man----"

"all right," broke in tom quickly, "i'm perfectly willing to go to town. come on--we're all going to town."

he got up, his eyes still flashing between gatsby and his wife. no one moved.

"come on!" his temper cracked

y she was again keeping half a dozen dates a day with half a dozen men and drowsing asleep at dawn with the beads and chiffon of an evening dress tangled among dying orchids on the floor beside her bed. and all the time something within her was crying for a decision. she wanted her life shaped now, immediately--and the decision must be made by some force--of love, of money, of unquestionable practicality--that was close at hand.

that force took shape in the middle of spring with the arrival of tom buchanan. there was a wholesome bulkiness about his person and his position and daisy was flattered. doubtless there was a certain struggle and a certain relief. the letter reached gatsby while he was still at oxford.


it was dawn now on long island and we went about opening the rest of the windows downstairs, filling the house with grey turning, gold turning light. the shadow of a tree fell abruptly across the dew and ghostly birds began to sing among the blue leaves. there was a slow pleasant movemen

"you said a bad driver was only safe until she met another bad driver? well, i met another bad driver, didn't i? i mean it was careless of me to make such a wrong guess. i thought you were rather an honest, straightforward person. i thought it was your secret pride."

"i'm thirty," i said. "i'm five years too old to lie to myself and call it honor."

she didn't answer. angry, and half in love with her, and tremendously sorry, i turned away.


one afternoon late in october i saw tom buchanan. he was walking ahead of me along fifth avenue in his alert, aggressive way, his hands out a little from his body as if to fight off interference, his head moving sharply here and there, adapting itself to his restless eyes. just as i slowed up to avoid overtaking him he stopped and began frowning into the windows of a jewelry store. suddenly he saw me and walked back holding out his hand.

"what's the matter, nick? do you object to shaking hands with me?"

"yes. you know what i think of you."
