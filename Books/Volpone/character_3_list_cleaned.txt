[CHARACTER]  - 
      one of the three legacy hunters or carrion-birds--the legacy hunters continually circle around volpone, giving him gifts in the hope that he will choose them as his heir. [CHARACTER] is a lawyer by profession, and, as a result, he is adept in the use of words and, by implication, adept in deceit, something he proves during the course of the play. he is also something of a social climber, conscious of his position in his society and resentful at being overtaken by others on the way up.
