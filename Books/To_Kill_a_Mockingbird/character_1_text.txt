as self-sufficient:
modest in comparison with the empires around it, the landing nevertheless
produced everything required to sustain life except ice, wheat flour, and articles
of clothing, supplied by river-boats from mobile.
simon would have regarded with impotent fury the disturbance between the north
and the south, as it left his descendants stripped of everything but their land, yet
the tradition of living on the land remained unbroken until well into the twentieth
century, when my father, atticus finch, went to montgomery to read law, and his
younger brother went to boston to study medicine. their sister alexandra was the
finch who remained at the landing: she married a taciturn man who spent most
of his time lying in a hammock by the river wondering if his trot-lines were full.
when my father was admitted to the bar, he returned to maycomb and began his
practice. maycomb, some twenty miles east of finchâ€™s landing, was the county

jem brushed his hair back to get a better look. â€œwhy donâ€™t you come over,

â€œâ€˜s not any funnierâ€™n yours. aunt rachel says your nameâ€™s jeremy atticus finch.â€
jem scowled. â€œiâ€™m big enough to fit mine,â€ he said. â€œyour nameâ€™s longerâ€™n you
are. bet itâ€™s a foot longer.â€
â€œfolks call me dill,â€ said dill, struggling under the fence.
â€œdo better if you go over it instead of under it,â€ i said. â€œwhereâ€™d you come from?â€
dill was from meridian, mississippi, was spending the summer with his aunt,
miss rachel, and would be spending every summer in maycomb from now on.
his family was from maycomb county originally, his mother worked

understand it,â€ she said, â€œbut sometimes the bible in the hand of one man is worse
than a whiskey bottle in the hand ofâ€”oh, of your father.â€
i was shocked. â€œatticus doesnâ€™t drink whiskey,â€ i said. â€œhe never drunk a drop in
his lifeâ€”nome, yes he did. he said he drank some one time and didnâ€™t like it.â€
miss maudie laughed. â€œwasnâ€™t talking about your father,â€ she said. â€œwhat i
meant was, if atticus finch drank until he was drunk he wouldnâ€™t be as hard as
some men are at their best. there are just some kind of men whoâ€”whoâ€™re so
busy worrying about the next world theyâ€™ve never learned to live in this one, and
you can look down the street and see the results.â€
â€œdo you think theyâ€™re true, all those things they say about bâ€”mr. arthur?â€

â€œyou reckon heâ€™s crazy?â€
miss maudie shook her head. â€œif heâ€™s not he should be by now. the things that
happen to people we never really know. what happens in houses behind closed
doors, what secrets-â€
â€œatticus donâ€™t ever do anything to jem and me in the house that he donâ€™t do in the
yard,â€ i said, feeling it my duty to defend my parent.
â€œgracious child, i was raveling a thread, wasnâ€™t even thinking about your father,

but now that i am iâ€™ll say this: atticus finch is the same in his house as he is on
the public streets. howâ€™d you like some fresh poundcake to take home?â€
i liked it very much.

next morning when i awakened i found jem and dill in the back yard deep in
conversation. when i joined them, as usual they said go away.
â€œwill not. this yardâ€™s as much mine as it is yours, jem finch. i got just as much
right to play in it as you have.â€
dill and jem emerged from a brief huddle: â€œif you stay youâ€™ve got to do what we
tell you,â€ dill war

can talk real pretty sometimes. one time i asked her to have a chew and she said
no thanks, thatâ€”chewing gum cleaved to her palate and rendered her speechless,â€
said jem carefully. â€œdoesnâ€™t that sound nice?â€
â€œyeah, she can say nice things sometimes. she wouldnâ€™t have a watch and chain
anyway.â€
â€œdear sir,â€ said jem. â€œwe appreciate theâ€”no, we appreciate everything which
you have put into the tree for us. yours very truly, jeremy atticus finch.â€
â€œhe wonâ€™t know who you are if you sign it like that, jem.â€
jem erased his name and wrote, â€œjem finch.â€ i signed, â€œjean louise finch
(scout),â€ beneath it. jem put the note in an envelope.
next morning on the way to school he ran ahead of me and stopped at the tree.
jem was facing me when he looked up, and i saw him go stark white.
â€œscout!â€
i ran to him.
someone had filled our knot-hole with cement.

benefit of your fatherâ€™s age. if your father was thirty youâ€™d find life quite
different.â€
â€œi sure would. atticus canâ€™t do anythingâ€¦â€
â€œyouâ€™d be surprised,â€ said miss maudie. â€œthereâ€™s life in him yet.â€
â€œwhat can he do?â€
â€œwell, he can make somebodyâ€™s will so airtight canâ€™t anybody meddle with it.â€
â€œshootâ€¦â€
â€œwell, did you know heâ€™s the best checker-player in this town? why, down at the
landing when we were coming up, atticus finch could beat everybody on both
sides of the river.â€

â€œgood lord, miss maudie, jem and me beat him all the time.â€
â€œitâ€™s about time you found out itâ€™s because he lets you. did you know he can play
a jewâ€™s harp?â€
this modest accomplishment served to make me even more ashamed of him.
â€œwellâ€¦â€ she said.
â€œwell, what, miss maudie?â€
â€œwell nothing. nothingâ€”it seems with all that youâ€™d be proud of him. canâ€™t

â€œhush, heck,â€ said atticus, â€œletâ€™s go back to town.â€
when they drove away, jem and i went to miss stephanieâ€™s front steps. we sat
waiting for zeebo to arrive in the garbage truck.
jem sat in numb confusion, and miss stephanie said, â€œuh, uh, uh, whoâ€™da thought
of a mad dog in february? maybe he wadnâ€™t mad, maybe he was just crazy. iâ€™d

hate to see harry johnsonâ€™s face when he gets in from the mobile run and finds

miss maudie said miss stephanieâ€™d be singing a different tune if tim johnson
was still coming up the street, that theyâ€™d find out soon enough, theyâ€™d send his
head to montgomery.
jem became vaguely articulate: â€œâ€˜d you see him, scout? â€™d you see him just

 mrs.
dubose,â€ i would receive for an answer, â€œdonâ€™t you say hey to me, you ugly girl!
you say good afternoon, mrs. dubose!â€
she was vicious. once she heard jem refer to our father as â€œatticusâ€ and her
reaction was apoplectic. besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who
ever passed her way, we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not
remarried after our motherâ€™s death. a lovelier lady than our mother never lived,
she said, and it was heartbreaking the way atticus finch let her children run wild.
i did not remember our mother, but jem didâ€”he would tell me about her
sometimesâ€”and he went livid when mrs. dubose shot us this message.
jem, having survived boo radley, a mad dog and other terrors, had concluded
that it was cowardly to stop at miss rachelâ€™s front steps and wait, and had
decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet
atticus coming from work. countless evenings atticus would find jem furious at

dark. a larger square of stores surrounded the courthouse square; dim lights
burned from deep within them.
atticusâ€™s office was in the courthouse when he began his law practice, but after
several years of it he moved to quieter quarters in the maycomb bank building.
when we rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the
bank. â€œheâ€™s in there,â€ said jem.
but he wasnâ€™t. his office was reached by a long hallway. looking down the hall,
we should have seen atticus finch, attorney-at-law in small sober letters against
the light from behind his door. it was dark.
jem peered in the bank door to make sure. he turned the knob. the door was
locked. â€œletâ€™s go up the street. maybe heâ€™s visitinâ€˜ mr. underwood.â€
mr. underwood not only ran the maycomb tribune office, he lived in it. that is,
above it. he covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his
upstairs window. the office building was on the northwest corner of the square,

 the live oaks on the square. attentive critics of courthouse
business, atticus said they knew as much law as the chief justice, from long
years of observation. normally, they were the courtâ€™s only spectators, and today
they seemed resentful of the interruption of their comfortable routine. when they
spoke, their voices sounded casually important. the conversation was about my
father.
â€œâ€¦thinks he knows what heâ€™s doing,â€ one said.
â€œoh-h now, i wouldnâ€™t say that,â€ said another. â€œatticus finchâ€™s a deep reader, a
mighty deep reader.â€
â€œhe reads all right, thatâ€™s all he does.â€ the club snickered.
â€œlemme tell you somethinâ€˜ now, billy,â€ a third said, â€œyou know the court
appointed him to defend this nigger.â€
â€œyeah, but atticus aims to defend him. thatâ€™s what i donâ€™t like about it.â€
this was news, news that put a different light on things: atticus had to, whether
he wanted to or not. i thought it odd that he hadnâ€™t said anything to us about itâ€”

the witness stand, to see mr. gilmer half-sitting, half-standing at his table. the
jury was watching him, one man was leaning forward with his hands over the
railing.
â€œwhatâ€™s so interestinâ€˜?â€ he asked.
â€œyouâ€™re left-handed, mr. ewell,â€ said judge taylor. mr. ewell turned angrily to
the judge and said he didnâ€™t see what his being left-handed had to do with it, that
he was a christ-fearing man and atticus finch was taking advantage of him.
tricking lawyers like atticus finch took advantage of him all the time with their
tricking ways. he had told them what happened, heâ€™d say it again and againâ€”
which he did. nothing atticus asked him after that shook his story, that heâ€™d
looked through the window, then ran the nigger off, then ran for the sheriff.
atticus finally dismissed him.
mr. gilmer asked him one more question. â€œabout your writing with your left
hand, are you ambidextrous, mr. ewell?â€

he left the kitchen, went in the diningroom and excused himself to aunt
alexandra, put on his hat and went to town.
we heard dillâ€™s step in the hall, so calpurnia left atticusâ€™s uneaten breakfast on
the table. between rabbit-bites dill told us of miss rachelâ€™s reaction to last night,
which was: if a man like atticus finch wants to butt his head against a stone wall
itâ€™s his head.
â€œiâ€™da got her told,â€ growled dill, gnawing a chicken leg, â€œbut she didnâ€™t look
much like tellinâ€˜ this morning. said she was up half the night wonderinâ€™ where i
was, said sheâ€™da had the sheriff after me but he was at the hearing.â€
â€œdill, youâ€™ve got to stop goinâ€˜ off without tellinâ€™ her,â€ said jem. â€œit just

judge taylor might have had his reasons for naming him?â€
this was a thought. court-appointed defenses were usually given to maxwell
green, maycombâ€™s latest addition to the bar, who needed the experience.
maxwell green should have had tom robinsonâ€™s case.
â€œyou think about that,â€ miss maudie was saying. â€œit was no accident. i was sittinâ€˜
there on the porch last night, waiting. i waited and waited to see you all come

down the sidewalk, and as i waited i thought, atticus finch wonâ€™t win, he canâ€™t
win, but heâ€™s the only man in these parts who can keep a jury out so long in a case
like that. and i thought to myself, well, weâ€™re making a stepâ€”itâ€™s just a baby-
step, but itâ€™s a step.â€
â€œâ€˜tâ€™s all right to talk like thatâ€”canâ€™t any christian judges anâ€™ lawyers make up for

atticus didnâ€™t bat an eye, just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and
stood there and let mr. ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to
repeat. mr. ewell was a veteran of an obscure war; that plus atticusâ€™s peaceful
reaction probably prompted him to inquire, â€œtoo proud to fight, you nigger-lovinâ€˜
bastard?â€ miss stephanie said atticus said, â€œno, too old,â€ put his hands in his
pockets and strolled on. miss stephanie said you had to hand it to atticus finch,
he could be right dry sometimes.
jem and i didnâ€™t think it entertaining.
â€œafter all, though,â€ i said, â€œhe was the deadest shot in the county one time. he
couldâ€”â€

lls hollered at them,
but dill didnâ€™t catch what they said.
maycomb was interested by the news of tomâ€™s death for perhaps two days; two
days was enough for the information to spread through the county. â€œdid you hear
about?â€¦ no? well, they say he was runninâ€˜ fit to beat lightninâ€™â€¦â€ to maycomb,
tomâ€™s death was typical. typical of a nigger to cut and run. typical of a niggerâ€™s
mentality to have no plan, no thought for the future, just run blind first chance he
saw. funny thing, atticus finch mightâ€™ve got him off scot free, but waitâ€”? hell
no. you know how they are. easy come, easy go. just shows you, that robinson
boy was legally married, they say he kept himself clean, went to church and all
that, but when it comes down to the line the veneerâ€™s mighty thin. nigger always
comes out in â€˜em.

â€œagnes, is your father home? oh god, where is he? please tell him to come over
here as soon as he comes in. please, itâ€™s urgent!â€
there was no need for aunt alexandra to identify herself, people in maycomb
knew each otherâ€™s voices.
atticus came out of jemâ€™s room. the moment aunt alexandra broke the
connection, atticus took the receiver from her. he rattled the hook, then said,
â€œeula may, get me the sheriff, please.â€
â€œheck? atticus finch. someoneâ€™s been after my children. jemâ€™s hurt. between
here and the schoolhouse. i canâ€™t leave my boy. run out there for me, please, and

do. got to go now. thanks, heck.â€
â€œatticus, is jem dead?â€
