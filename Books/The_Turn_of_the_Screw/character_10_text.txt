this observation
that drew from douglas--not immediately, but later in the evening--a
reply that had the interesting consequence to which i call attention.
someone else told a story not particularly effective, which i saw he was
not following. this i took for a sign that he had himself something to
produce and that we should only have to wait. we waited in fact till two
nights later; but that same evening, before we scattered, he brought out
what was in his mind.

“i quite agree--in regard to griffin’s ghost, or whatever it was--that
its appearing first to the little boy, at so tender an age, adds a
particular touch. but it’s not the first occurrence of its charming
kind that i know to have involved a child. if the child gives the effect
another turn of the screw, what do you say to two children--?”

“we say, of course,” somebody exclaimed, “that they give two turns! also
that we want to hear about them.”

 summer afternoon.
it wasn’t a scene for a shudder; but oh--!” he quitted the fire and
dropped back into his chair.

“you’ll receive the packet thursday morning?” i inquired.

“probably not till the second post.”

“well then; after dinner--”

“you’ll all meet me here?” he looked us round again. “isn’t anybody
going?” it was almost the tone of hope.

“everybody will stay!”

“_i_ will”--and “_i_ will!” cried the ladies whose departure had been
fixed. mrs. griffin, however, expressed the need for a little more
light. “who was it she was in love with?”

“the story will tell,” i took upon myself to reply.

“oh, i can’t wait for the story!”

“the story won’t tell,” said douglas; “not in any literal, vulgar way.”

“more’s the pity, then. that’s the only way i ever understand.”

“won’t you tell, douglas?” somebody else inquired.

he sprang to his feet again. “yes--tomorrow. now i must go to bed.
good night.” and quick

ly catching up a candlestick, he left us slightly
bewildered. from our end of the great brown hall we heard his step on
the stair; whereupon mrs. griffin spoke. “well, if i don’t know who she
was in love with, i know who he was.”

“she was ten years older,” said her husband.

“raison de plus--at that age! but it’s rather nice, his long reticence.”

“forty years!” griffin put in.

“with this outbreak at last.”

“the outbreak,” i returned, “will make a tremendous occasion of thursday
night;” and everyone so agreed with me that, in the light of it, we lost
all attention for everything else. the last story, however incomplete
and like the mere opening of a serial, had been told; we handshook and
“candlestuck,” as somebody said, and went to bed.

i knew the next day that a letter containing the key had, by the first
post, gone off to his london apart
