 his usual nap, put on his evening clothes and drove to ivan ilych's 
house.  
 
at the entrance stood a carriage and two cabs. leaning against the wall in the 
hall downstairs near the cloak stand was a coffin-lid covered with cloth of gold, 
ornamented with gold cord and tassels, which had been polished up with metal 
powder. two ladies in black were taking off their fur cloaks. peter ivanovich 
recognized one of them as ivan ilych's sister, but the other was a stranger to him. 
his colleague schwartz was just coming downstairs, but on seeing peter 
ivanovich enter he stopped and winked at him, as if to say: "ivan ilyich has made 
a mess of things -- not like you and me."  
 
schwartz's face with his piccadilly whiskers, and his slim figure in evening dress, 
had as usual an air of elegant solemnity which contrasted with the playfulness of 
his character and had a special piquancy here, or so it seemed to peter 
ivanovich.  
 
peter ivanovich allowed the ladies to precede him and slowly foll

upstairs. schwartz did not come down but remained where he was, and peter 
ivanovich understood that he wanted to arrange where they should play bridge 
that evening. the ladies went upstairs to the widow's room, and schwartz with 
seriously compressed lips but a playful looking his eyes, indicated by a twist of 
his eyebrows the room to the right where the body lay.  
 
peter ivanovich, like everyone else on such occasions, entered feeling uncertain 
what he would have to do. all he knew was that at such times it is always safe to 
cross oneself. but he was not quite sure whether one should make obeisance 
while doing so. he therefore adopted a middle course. on entering the room he 
began crossing himself and made

fied than when he was alive. the 
expression on the face said that what was necessary had been accomplished, 
and accomplished rightly. besides this there was in that expression a 
reproach and a warning to the living. this warning seemed to peter ivanovich 
out of place, or at least not applicable to him. he felt a certain discomfort and so 
he hurriedly crossed himself once more and turned and went out of the door -- 
too hurriedly and too regardless of propriety, as he himself was aware.  
 
schwartz was waiting for him in the adjoining room with legs spread wide apart 
and both hands toying with his top hat behind his back. the mere sight of that 
playful, well-groomed, and elegant figure refreshed peter ivanovich. he felt that 
schwartz was above all these happenings and would not surrender to any 
depressing influences. his very look said that this incident of a church service for 
ivan ilyich could not be a sufficient reason for infringing the order of the session -

 to play 
bridge that evening. praskovya fedorovna (a short, fat woman who despite all 
efforts to the contrary had continued to broaden steadily from her shoulders 
downwards and who had the same extraordinarily arched eyebrows as the lady 
who had been standing by the coffin), dressed all in black, her head covered with 
lace, came out of her own room with some other ladies, conducted them to the 
room where the dead body lay, and said: "the service will begin immediately. 
please go in."  
 
schwartz, making an indefinite bow, stood still, evidently neither accepting nor 
declining this invitation. praskovya fedorovna recognizing peter ivanovich, 
sighed, went close up to him, took his hand, and said: "i know you were a true 
friend to ivan ilyich..." and looked at him awaiting some suitable response. and 
peter ivanovich knew that, just as it had been the right thing to cross himself in 
that room, so what he had to do here was to press her hand, sigh, and say, 
"believe me..." so he did a

ll this and as he did it felt that the desired result had 
been achieved: that both he and she were touched.  
 

"come with me. i want to speak to you before it begins," said the widow. "give 
me your arm."  
 
peter ivanovich gave her his arm and they went to the inner rooms, passing 
schwartz who winked at peter ivanovich compassionately.  
 
"that does for our bridge! don's object if we find another player. perhaps you 
can cut in when you do escape," said his playful look.  
 
peter ivanovich sighed still more deeply and despondently, and praskovya 
fedorovna pressed his arm gratefully. when they reached the drawing room, 
upholstered in pink cretonne and lighted by a dim lamp, they sat down at the 
table -- she on a sofa and peter ivanovich on a low pouf, the springs of which

 pressing down on the lip, and felt afraid for himself.  
 
"three days of frightful suffering and the death! why, that might suddenly, at any 
time, happen to me," he thought, and for a moment felt terrified. but -- he did 
not himself know how -- the customary reflection at once occurred to him 
that this had happened to ivan ilyich and not to him, and that it should not 
and could not happen to him, and that to think that it could would be 
yielding to depressing which he ought not to do, as schwartz's expression 
plainly showed. after which reflection peter ivanovich felt reassured, and 
began to ask with interest about the details of ivan ilych's death, as though 
death was an accident natural to ivan ilyich but certainly not to himself.  
 
after many details of the really dreadful physical sufferings ivan ilyich had 
endured (which details he learnt only from the effect those sufferings had 
produced on praskovya fedorovna's nerves) the widow apparently found it 
necessary to get to bus

 the law courts too, ivan ilyich noticed, or thought he noticed, a strange attitude 
towards himself. it sometimes seemed to him that people were watching him 
inquisitively as a man whose place might soon be vacant. then again, his friends 
would suddenly begin to chaff him in a friendly way about his low spirits, as if the 
awful, horrible, and unheard-of thing that was going on within him, incessantly 
gnawing at him and irresistibly drawing him away, was a very agreeable subject 
for jests. schwartz in particular irritated him by his jocularity, vivacity, and savoir-
faire, which reminded him of what he himself had been ten years ago.  
 
friends came to make up a set and they sat down to cards. they dealt, bending 
the new cards to soften them, and he sorted the diamonds in his hand and found 
he had seven. his partner said "no trumps" and supported him with two 
diamonds. what more could be wished for? it ought to be jolly and lively. they 
would make a grand slam. but suddenly ivan ilyi
