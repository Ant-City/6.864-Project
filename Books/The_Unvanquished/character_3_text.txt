they were back in the trees; it looked like four or five men had taken each rail and
tied it around a tree like you knot a green cornstalk around a wagon stake, and ringo was
hollering, too, now.

look when bobolink came up the road out of the trees and went across the railroad and
into the trees again like a bird, with cousin drusilla riding astride like a man and sitting
straight and light as a willow branch in the wind. they said she was the best woman rider in
the country.

since hope of that was gone, but at least for prolongation, which it served. but that meant
nothing to us. we didn't hear, we didn't even listen; we sat there in that cabin and waited

warned by that grapevine of the oppressed, deprived of everything now save the will and
the ability to deceive, turning inscrutable and impassive secret faces to the blue enemies
who lived among them. because they knew it was going to happen; drusilla told that too:
how they seemed to know somehow the very moment when the engine left atlanta; it was
as if the gray generals themselves had sent the word, had told them, "you have suffered
for three years; now we will give to you and your children a glimpse of that for which you

more than a year. i don't think it was intended to do that. it was like a meeting between
two iron knights of the old time, not for material gain but for principle--honor denied with
honor, courage denied with courage--the deed done not for the end but for the sake of
the doing--put to the ultimate test and proving nothing save the finality of death and the
vanity of all endeavor. we saw it, we were there, as if drusilla's voice had transported us to
the wandering light-ray in space in which was still held the furious shadow--the brief section
of track which existed inside the scope of a single pair of eyes and nowhere else, coming
from nowhere and having, needing, no destination, the engine not coming into view but
arrested in human sight in thunderous yet dreamy fury, lonely, inviolate and forlorn, wailing
through its whistle precious steam which could have meant seconds at the instant of

could hear it again, like we had in the wagon--the hurrying feet, the sound like they were
singing in panting whispers, hurrying on past the gate and dying away up the road. "that's

reached the river, where the cavalry was holding them back from the bridge. it was just a
sound at first, like wind, like it might be in the dust itself. we didn't even know what it was
until we saw drusilla holding bobolink reined back, her face turned toward us wan and
small above the dust and her mouth open and crying thinly: "look out, aunt rosa! oh, look
out!"

it was like we all heard it at the same time--we in the wagon and on the horse, they
all around us in the sweat-caking dust. they made a kind of long wailing sound, and then i
felt the whole wagon lift clear of the ground and begin to rush forward. i saw our old rib-

heads with his sabre, with his little bloody shrieking face and all. i don't know where he
went anymore than i know where he came from: he just vanished still holding onto the
wagon and flailing about him with the sabre, and then cousin drusilla was there on
bobolink; she had our nigh horse by the head-stall and was trying to turn the wagon
sideways. i started to jump down to help. "stay in the wagon," she said. she didn't shout;
she just said it. "take the lines and turn them." when we got the wagon turned sideways we
stopped. and then for a minute i thought we were going backward, until i saw it was the
niggers. then i saw that the cavalry had broken; i saw the whole mob of it--horses and

clap of wind hit me on the back of the head. i didn't hear anything at all. i just sat there in
the wagon with a funny buzzing in my ears and a funny taste in my mouth, and watched
little toy men and horses and pieces of plank floating along in the air above the water. but
i didn't hear anything at all; i couldn't even hear cousin drusilla. she was right beside the
wagon now, leaning toward us, her mouth urgent and wide and no sound coming out of it
at all.

"stay in the wagon!"
"i can't hear you!" i said. that's what i said, that's what i was thinking; i didn't realise

faces that couldn't see or hear either. cousin drusilla had the nigh horse by the bridle
again, and i dragged at them, too, and granny was standing up in the wagon and
beating at the faces with mrs. compson's parasol, and then the whole rotten bridle came

when i think of that day, of father's old troop on their horses drawn up facing the house,
and father and drusilla on the ground with that carpet bagger voting box in front of them,
and opposite them the women--aunt louisa, mrs. habersham and all the others--on the
porch and the two sets of them, the men and the women, facing one another like they
were both waiting for a bugle to sound the charge, i think i know the reason. i think it was
because father's troop (like all the other southern soldiers too), even though they had
surrendered and said that they were whipped, were still soldiers. maybe from the ol

to quit that world: maybe the danger and the fighting are the reasons, because men have
been pacifists for every reason under the sun except to avoid danger and fighting. and so
now father's troop and all the other men in jefferson, and aunt louisa and mrs.
habersham and all the women in jefferson were actually enemies for the reason that the
men had given in and admitted that they belonged to the united states but the women
had never surrendered.

the envelope was worn and dirty and it had been opened once and then glued
back, but we could still make out hawkhurst, gihon county, alabama on it even though
we did not recognise aunt louisa's hand at first. it was addressed to granny; it was six
pages cut with scissors from wallpaper and written on both sides with pokeberry juice and i
thought of that night eighteen months ago when drusilla and i stood outside the cabin at
hawkhurst and listened to the niggers passing in the road, the night when she told me
about the dog, about keeping the dog quiet, and then asked me to ask father to let her
join his troop and ride with him. but i didn't tell father. maybe i forgot it. then the yankees
went away, and father and his troop went away too. then, six months later, we had a
letter from him about how they were fighting in carolina, and a month after that we had
one from aunt louisa that
 
 ___________________________
 
 drusilla was gone too, a short letter on the wallpaper that you
could see where aunt louisa had cried in the pokeberry juice about how she did not know
where drusilla was but that she had expected the worst ever since drusilla had
deliberately tried to unsex herself by refusing to feel any natural grief at the death in battle
not only of her affianced husband but of her own father and that she took it for granted
that drusilla was with us and though she did not expect drusilla to take any steps herself to
relieve a mother's anxiety, she hoped that granny would. but we didn't know where
drusilla was either.

not only taken along with them all living men blue and gray and white and black, but
even one young girl who had happened to try to look and act like a man after her
sweetheart was killed.

so then the next letter came. only granny wasn't there to read it because she was
dead then (it was the time when grumby doubled back past jefferson and so ringo and i

of courageous men and spotless women looking down from heaven upon a daughter
who had deliberately cast away that for which he died, and when i think of my half-
orphan son who will one day ask of me why his martyred father's sacrifice was not enough
to preserve his sister's good name--

while he had to light another pineknot and all the farther we had got was how when
gavin breckbridge was killed at shiloh before he and drusilla had had time to marry, there
had been reserved for drusilla the highest destiny of a southern woman--to be the bride--
widow of a lost cause--and how drusilla had not only thrown that away, she had not only
become a lost woman and a shame to her father's memory but she was now living in a
word that aunt louisa would not even repeat but that granny knew what it was, though
at least thank god that father and drusilla were not actually any blood kin, it being
father's wife who was drusilla's cousi

n by blood and not father himself. so then ringo lit the
other pine-knot and then we put the sheets of wallpaper down on the floor and then we
found out what it was: how drusilla had been gone for six months and no word from her
except she was alive, and then one night she walked into the cabin where aunt louisa
and denny were (and now it had a line drawn under it, like this:) in the garments not alone
of a man but of a common private soldier and told them how she had been a member of
father's troop for six months, bivouacking at night surrounded by sleeping men and not
even bothering to put up the tent for her and father except when the weather was bad,

a not only showed neither shame nor remorse but actually pretended she
did not even know what aunt louisa was talking about; how when aunt louisa told her
that she and father must marry at once, drusilla said, "can't you understand that i am tired
of burying husbands in this war? that i am riding in cousin john's troop not to find a man
but to hurt yankees?" and how aunt louisa said:

the third letter did not come to us at all. it came to mrs. compson. drusilla and father were
home then. it was in the spring and the war was over now, and we were busy getting the
cypress and oak out of the bottom to build the house and drusilla working with joby and
ringo and father and me like another man, with her hair shorter than it had been at
hawkhurst and her face sunburned from riding in the weather and her body thin from living
like soldiers lived. after granny died ringo and louvinia and i all slept in the cabin, but

father and i slept on ringo's and my pallet and drusilla slept in the bed behind the quilt
curtain where granny used to sleep. and so one night i remembered aunt louisa's letter
and i showed it to drusilla and father, and father found out that drusilla had not written to
tell aunt louisa where she was and father said she must, and so one day mrs. compson
came out with the third letter. drusilla and ringo and louvinia too were down in the
bottom at the sawmill and i saw that one too, on the wallpaper with the pokeberry juice
and the juice not cried on this time either, and this the first time mrs. compson had come
out since granny died and not even getting out of her surrey but sitting there holding to

drusilla would come out of the house or from around the corner it would not be just a thin
sunburned girl in a man's shirt and pants but maybe something like a tame panther or

stranger to herself but not a stranger to granny and that there were times when the good

strange to women: that it is just one continuous monotonous thing full of the repeated
follies of their menfolks. mrs. compson was sitting in granny's chair, still holding the parasol
and drawn up under her shawl and looking like she had finally seen whatever it was she
had expected to see, and it had been the panther. it was mrs. habersham who was
holding back the quilt for the others to go in and look at the bed where drusilla slept and

peeping out from behind her with their eyes round and bright, looking at drusilla standing
there in the sawdust and shavings, in her dirty sweated overalls and shirt and brogans, with
her face sweat-streaked with sawdust and her short hair yellow with it. "i am martha

she said, "you poor child."

kind of waving her hand at the mules that hadn't stopped and at joby and ringo
goggling at her and the three others still peeping around her at drusilla. "--to offer you not
only our help, but our sympathy."

"oh. oh. oh," standing there, and then she was running. she began to run like a deer, that
starts to run and then decides where it wants to go; she turned right in the air and came
toward me, running light over the logs and planks, with her mouth open, saying "john,
john" not loud; for a minute it was like she thought i was father until she waked up and
found i was not; she stopped without even ceasing to run, like a bird stops in the air,

i came out of the bottom, i couldn't see her. but the surreys and buggies
were still in front of the cabin and i could see mrs. compson and the other ladies on the
porch, looking out across the pasture toward the bottom, so i did not go there. but before i
came to the other cabin, where louvinia and joby and ringo lived, i saw louvinia come
up the hill from the spring, carrying her cedar water bucket and singing. then she went into
the cabin and the singing stopped short off and so i knew where drusilla was. but i didn't
hide. i went to the window and looked in and saw drusilla just turning from where she had
been leaning her head in her arms on the mantel when louvinia came in with the water
bucket and a gum twig in her mouth and father's old hat on top of her head rag. drusilla
was crying. "that's what it is, then," she said. "coming down there to the mill and telling me
that in my condition--sympathy and help--strangers; i never saw any of them before and i
don't care a damn what they--but

back and lay flat on the belly of drusilla's overalls, then louvinia was holding drusilla in her
arms like she used to hold me and drusilla was crying hard. "that john and i--that we--and
gavin dead at shiloh and john's home burned and his plantation ruined, that he and i--
we went to the war to hurt yankees, not hunting women!"
"i knows you ain't," louvinia said. "hush now. hush."

made mrs. compson send for aunt louisa or whether aunt louisa just gave them a
deadline and then came herself. because we were busy, drusilla and joby and ringo and
me at the mill, and father in town; we wouldn't see him from the time he would ride away
in the morning until when he would get back, sometimes late at night. because they were
strange times then. for four years we had lived for just one thing, even the women and
children who could not fight: to get yankee troops out of the country; we thought that
when that happened, it would be all over. and now that had happened, and then before
the summer began i heard father say to d

federal troops from the country. now it was as though we had not surrendered at all, we
had joined forces with the men who had been our enemies against a new foe whose
means we could not always fathom but whose aim we could always dread. so he was
busy in town all day long. they were building jefferson back, the courthouse and the
stores, but it was more than that which father and the other men were doing; it was
something which he would not let drusilla or me or ringo go into town to see. then one
day ringo slipped off and went to town and came back and he looked at me with his
eyes rolling a little.


he wasn't a nigger any more and he showed me what he had in his hand. it was a new

busy; we just saw father at night and sometimes then ringo and i and even drusilla would
take one look at him and we wouldn't ask him any questions. so it didn't take them long,
because drusilla was already beaten; she was just marking time without knowing it from
that afternoon when the fourteen ladies got into the surreys and buggies and went back
to town until one afternoon about two months later when we heard denny hollering even
before the wagon came in the gates, and aunt louisa sitting on one of the trunks (that's

laying down the umbrella or taking her bonnet off, looking at the pallet where father and
i slept and then at the quilt nailed to the rafter to make a room for drusilla, dabbing at her
mouth with a handkerchief that made the whole cabin smell like dead roses. and then
drusilla came in from the mill, in the muddy brogans and the sweaty shirt and overalls and
her hair sunburned and full of sawdust, and aunt louisa looked at her once and began to
cry again, saying, "lost, lost. thank god in his mercy that dennison hawk was taken before
he lived to see what i see."

still sitting in granny's chair with the handkerchief before her mouth. "this is a pleasant
surprise, miss louisa," father said.

suppose i cannot call it surprise. but it is still a shock." so father came out too and we went
down to the spring and found drusilla hiding behind the big beech, crouched down like
she was trying to hide the skirt from father even while he raised her up. "what's a dress?" he
said. "it don't matter. come. get up, soldier."

come down to the log-yard any more, and now that father and i slept in the cabin with
joby and ringo, i didn't even see drusilla except at mealtime. and we were busy getting
the timber out, and now everybody was talking

 about the election and how father had
told the two burdens before all the men in town that the election would never be held with
cash benbow or any other nigger in it and how the burdens had dared him to stop it. and
besides, the other cabin would be full of jefferson ladies all day; you would have thought
that drusilla was mrs. habersham's daughter and not aunt louisa's. they would begin to
arrive right after breakfast and stay all day, so that at supper aunt louisa would sit in her
black mourning except for the bonnet and umbrella, with a wad of some kind of black
knitting she carried around with her and that never got finished and the folded
handkerchief handy in her belt (only she ate fine; she ate more than father even because
the election was just a week off and i reckon he was thinking about the burdens

had beat them both until that night when aunt louisa went behind her back and chose a
game she couldn't beat. i was coming up to supper; i heard them inside the cabin before i
could stop: "can't you believe me?" drusilla said. "can't you understand that in the troop i

just another mouth for john to feed, just a cousin of john's wife and not much older than

at father, thrust back in granny's chair (the only chair we had) in her black dress, the black

that the husband whom i have lost and the man son which i have not would demand,
perhaps at the point of a pistol.--will you marry my daughter?"

i got out. i moved fast; i heard the light sharp sound when drusilla's head went
down between her flungout arms on the table, and the sound the bench made when
father got up too; i passed him standing beside drusilla with his hand on her head. "they
have beat you, drusilla," he said.

mrs. habersham got there before we had finished breakfast the next morning. i don't

saying, "of course. you poor thing. a public wedding now, after a year, would be a public
notice of the . . ." so they decided it would be a reception, because mrs. habersham said
how a reception could be held for a bridal couple at any time, even ten years later. so
drusilla was to ride into town, meet father and be married as quick and quiet as possible,
with just me and one other for witnesses to make it legal; none of the ladies themselves
would even be present. then they would come back home and we would have the
reception.

the porch. but i didn't know that ringo was missing when we started, not even when i
heard aunt louisa hollering for benny while we rode down the drive. it was louvinia that
told about it, about how after we left the ladies set and decorated the table and spread
the wedding breakfast and how they were all watching the gate and aunt louisa still
hollering for benny now and then when they saw ringo and benny come up the drive

because we didn't have time. maybe drusilla and father would have, but when we
came into the square we saw the crowd of niggers kind of huddled beyond the hotel door
with six or eight strange white men herding them, and then all of a sudden i saw the
jefferson men, the men that i knew, that father knew, running across the square toward
the hotel with each one holding his hip like a man runs with a pistol in his pocket. and then
i saw the men who were father's troop lined up before the hotel door, blocking it off. and

them, with the northern white men herding them together. father put his hat on and took
the ballot box from drusilla and helped her back onto her horse and handed the ballot
box up to her. then he looked around again,' at all of them. "this election will be held out
at my home," he said. "i hereby appoint drusilla hawk voting commissioner until the votes
are cast and counted. does any man here object?" but he stopped them again with his
hand before it had begun good. "not now, boys," he said. he turned to drusilla. "go home,

went on; we turned in the gates with drusilla in front, the ballot box on her pommel--us and
father's men and about a hundred more, and rode on up to the cabin where the buggies
and surreys were standing, and drusilla passed the ballot box to me and got down and
took the box again and was walking toward the cabin when she stopped dead still. i
reckon she and i both remembered at the same time and i reckon that even the others,
the men, knew all of a sudden that something was wrong. because like father said, i
reckon women don't ever surrender: not only victory, but not even defeat. because that's
how we were stopped when aunt louisa and the other ladies came out on the porch, and
then father shoved past me a

looked at him.
"so you are not married," she said.

"i forgot," drusilla said.

"you forgot? you forgot?"

"i . . ." drusilla said. "we . . ."


now aunt louisa looked at us; she looked along the line of us sitting there in our
saddles; she looked at me too just like she did at the others, like she had never seen me
before. "and who are these, pray? your wedding train of forgetters? your groomsmen of
murder and robbery?"
"they came to vote," drusilla said.

but drusilla didn't move, standing there in her torn dress and the ruined veil and the twisted

know what she was going to do: we just sat there and watched her snatch the polling box

pokeberry juice and an old piece of window shade, and they cut it into ballots. "let all
who want the honorable cassius q. benbow to be marshal of jefferson write yes on his
ballot; opposed, no," father said.
"and i'll do the writing and save some more time," george wyatt said. so he made

a pack of the ballots and wrote them against his saddle and fast as he would write them
the men would take them and drop them into the box and drusilla would call their names

morning father too had relinquished along with the pipe which ringo said he was smoking,
which slipped from his hand as he fell. we rode on, toward the house where he would be
lying in the parlor now, in his regimentals (sabre too) and where drusilla would be waiting
for me beneath all the festive glitter of the chandeliers, in the yellow ball gown and the
sprig of verbena in her hair, holding the two loaded pistols (i could see that too, who had
had no presentiment; i could see her, in the formal brilliant room arranged formally for

just twenty then: that summer before i entered the university to take the law degree which

and made him sign father's peace bond for killing the two carpet baggers, and took
father and drusilla to the minister herself and saw that they were married. and father had
rebuilt the house too, on the same blackened spot, over the same cellar, where the other

dream just as a bride's trousseau and veil, the aura of hers. and aunt jenny had come to
live with us now so we had the garden (drusilla would no more have bothered with flowers
than father himself would have, who even now, even four years after it was over, still
seemed to exist, breathe, in that last year of it while she had ridden in man's clothes and

were still friends, which as george wyatt said was easily a record for father, and he would
leave the house at daybreak on jupiter, riding up and down the unfinished line with two
saddlebags of gold coins borrowed on friday to pay the men on saturday, keeping just
two cross-ties ahead of the sheriff as aunt jenny said. so we walked in the dusk, slowly
between aunt jenny's flower beds while drusilla (in a dress now, who still would have worn
pants all the time if father had let her) leaned lightly on my arm and i smelled the verbena
in her hair as i had smelled the rain in it and in father's beard that night four years ago
when he and drusilla and uncle buck mccaslin found grumby and then came home and

a landslide for father. and it was, and we thought he was satisfied. maybe he thought so
himself, as the drunkard believes that he is done with drink; and it was that afternoon and

the women of her generation and class in the south into a type and how it had failed--the
suffering, the identical experience (hers and aunt jenny's had been almost the same
except that aunt jenny had spent a few nights with her husband before they brought him
back home in an ammunition wagon while gavin breckbridge was just drusilla's fiance)

many men who return from wars to live on government reservations like so many steers,
emasculate and empty of all save an identical experience which they cannot forget and
dare not, else they would cease to live at that moment, almost interchangeable save for
the old habit of answering to a given name.

verbena in her hair, standing there motionless yet emanating something louder than the

guiding me without pressure, and entered the parlor. then for the first time i realised it--the

jenny who had just risen from a chair behind which louvinia stood. she was father's sister,

the war, by a shell from a federal frigate at fort moultrie, come to us from carolina six
years ago. ringo and i went to tennessee junction in the wa

 a fanlight about one of the drawing room windows for her--who came up
the drive and father (home now from the railroad) went down the steps and lifted her
from the wagon and said, "well, jenny," and she said, "well, johnny," and began to cry.
she stood too, looking at me as i approached--the same hair, the same high nose, the
same eyes as father's except that they were intent and very wise instead of intolerant. she
said nothing at all, she just kissed me, her hands light on my shoulders. then drusilla spoke,
as if she had been waiting with a sort of dreadful patience for the empty ceremony to be
done, in a voice like a bell: clear, unsentient, on a single pitch, silvery and triumphant:
"come, bayard."

it was just as i had imagined it--sabre, plumes, and all--but with that alteration, that
irrevocable difference which i had known to expect yet had not realised, as you can put

to have performed the fatal actions which forever afterward he must have waked and
slept with and maybe was glad to lay down at last--those curious appendages clumsily
conceived to begin with yet with which man has taught himself to do so much, so much
more than they were intended to do or could be forgiven for doing, which had now
surrendered that life to which his intolerant heart had fiercely held; and then i knew that in
a minute i would begin to pant. so drusilla must have spoken twice before i heard her and
turned and saw in the instant aunt jenny and louvinia watching us, hearing drusilla now,
the unsentient bell quality gone now, her voice whispering into that quiet death-filled room
with a passionate and dying fall: "bayard." she faced me, she was quite near; again the
scent of the verbena in her hair seemed to have increased a hundred times as she stood
holding out to me, one in either hand, the two duelling pistols. "take them, bayard," she
said,

then her eyes filled with an expression of bitter and passionate
betrayal. "why, he's not--" she said. "he's not--and i kissed his hand," she said in an aghast
whisper; "i kissed his hand!" beginning to laugh, the laughter, rising, becoming a scream yet
still remaining laughter, screaming with laughter, trying herself to deaden the sound by
putting her hand over her mouth, the laughter spilling between her fingers like vomit, the
incredulous betrayed eyes still watching me across the hand.

and drusilla turned her face to louvinia.
"i kissed his hand, louvinia!" she cried. "did you see it? i kissed his hand!" the laughter

rising again, becoming the scream again yet still remaining laughter, she still trying to hold
it back with her hand like a small child who has filled its mouth too full.

"take her upstairs," aunt jenny said. but they were already moving toward the door,
louvinia half-carrying drusilla, the laughter diminishing as they neared the door as though
it waited for the larger spac

after a while the whippoorwills stopped and i heard the first day bird, a mockingbird. it
had sung all night too but now it was the day song, no longer the drowsy moony fluting.
then they all began--the sparrows from the stable, the thrush that lived in aunt jenny's
garden, and i heard a quail too from the pasture and now there was light in the room. but i
didn't move at once. i still lay on the bed (i hadn't undressed) with my hands under my
head and the scent of drusilla's verbena faint from where my coat lay on a chair,
watching the light grow, watching it turn rosy with the sun. after a while i heard louvinia
come up across the back yard and go into the kitchen; i heard the door and then the
long crash of her armful of stovewood into the box. soon they would begin to arrive--the
carriages and buggies in the drive--but not for a while yet because they too would wait
first to see what i was going to do. so the house was quiet when i went down to the
diningroom,

smoke from a cigar. then george wyatt was beside me (i don't know where he came
from) and five or six others of father's old troop a few yards behind, george's hand on my
arm, drawing me into a doorway out of the avid eyes like caught breaths.

know it's right. here." he was already fumbling the pistol into my pocket, then the same
thing seemed to happen to him that happened to drusilla last night when she kissed my
hand--something communicated by touch straight to the simple code by which he lived,
without going through the brain at all: so that he too stood suddenly back, the pistol in his
hand, staring at me with his pale outraged eyes and speaking in a whisper thin with fury:
"who are you? is your name sartoris? by god, if you don't kill him, i'm going to." now it was
not panting, it was a terrible desire to laugh, to laugh as drusilla had, and say, "that's what

forehead. then i raised my head; the little room was full of men. "my god!" george wyatt
cried. "you took the pistol away from him and then missed him, missed him twice?" then he
answered himself--that same rapport for violence which drusilla had and which in
george's case was actual character judgment: "no; wait. you walked in here without
even a pocket knife and let him miss you twice. my god in heaven." he turned, shouting:
"get to hell out of here! you, white, ride out to sartoris and tell his folks it's all over and he's
all right. ride!" so they departed, went away; presently only george was left, watching me
with that pale bleak stare which was speculative yet not at all ratiocinative. "well by god,"
he said. "--do you want a

el in wet sand. there was just one light in the hall now and so it was all over
though i could still smell the flowers even above the verbena in my coat. i had not looked
at him again. i had started to before i left the house but i did not, i did not see him again
and all the pictures we had of him were bad ones because a picture could no more have
held him dead than the house could have kept his body. but i didn't need to see him
again because he was there, he would always be there; maybe what drusilla meant by his
dream was not something which he possessed but something which he had bequeathed
us which we could never forget, which would even assume the corporeal shape of him
whenever any of us, black or white, closed our eyes. i went into the house. there was no
light in the drawing room except the last of the afterglow which came through the western
window where aunt jenny's colored glass was; i was about to go on up stairs when i saw
her sitting there beside the window. she didn't call me

and i didn't speak drusilla's name, i
just went to the door and stood there. "she's gone," aunt jenny said. "she took the evening
train. she has gone to montgomery, to dennison." denny had been married about a year
now; he was living in montgomery, reading law.

"i see," i said. "then she didn't--" but there wasn't any use in that either; jed white
must have got there before one o'clock and told them. and besides, aunt jenny didn't
answer. she could have lied to me but she didn't, she said, "come here." i went to her

watched them come up as though she were trying to stop them; i felt them on my
shoulders as if they had a separate life of their own and were trying to do something which
for my sake she was trying to restrain, prevent. then she gave up or she was not strong
enough because they came up and took my face between them, hard, and suddenly the
tears sprang and streamed down her face like drusilla's laughing had. "oh, damn you
sartorises!" she said. "damn you! damn you!"

louvinia laying the table for supper. so the stairs were lighted quite well. but the upper hall
was dark. i saw her open door (that unmistakable way in which an open door stands open
when nobody lives in the room any more) and i realised i had not believed that she was
really gone. so i didn't look into the room. i went on to mine and entered. and then for a
long moment i thought it was the verbena in my lapel which i s
