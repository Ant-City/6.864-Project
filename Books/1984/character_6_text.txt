n in his
panic he had not wanted to smudge the creamy paper by shutting the book
while the ink was wet.

he drew in his breath and opened the door. instantly a warm wave of relief
flowed through him. a colourless, crushed-looking woman, with wispy hair
and a lined face, was standing outside.

'oh, comrade,' she began in a dreary, whining sort of voice, 'i thought i
heard you come in. do you think you could come across and have a look at
our kitchen sink? it's got blocked up and----'

it was mrs parsons, the wife of a neighbour on the same floor. ('mrs' was
a word somewhat discountenanced by the party--you were supposed to call
everyone 'comrade'--but with some women one used it instinctively.) she was
a woman of about thirty, but looking much older. one had the impression
that there was dust in the creases of her face. winston followed her down
the passage. these amateur repair jobs were an almost daily irritation.
victory mansions were old flats, built in 1930 or thereabouts, and were

the pipes burst in every hard frost, the roof leaked whenever there was
snow, the heating system was usually running at half steam when it was not
closed down altogether from motives of economy. repairs, except what you
could do for yourself, had to be sanctioned by remote committees which
were liable to hold up even the mending of a window-pane for two years.

'of course it's only because tom isn't home,' said mrs parsons vaguely.

the parsons' flat was bigger than winston's, and dingy in a different
way. everything had a battered, trampled-on look, as though the
place had just been visited by some large violent animal. games
impedimenta--hockey-sticks, boxing-gloves, a burst football, a pair of
sweaty shorts turned inside out--lay all over the floor, and on the
table there was a litter of dirty dishes and dog-eared exercise-books.
on the walls were scarlet banners of the youth league and the spies, and
a full-s

ized poster of big brother. there was the usual boiled-cabbage
smell, common to the whole building, but it was shot through by a sharper
reek of sweat, which--one knew this at the first sniff, though it was
hard to say how--was the sweat of some person not present at the moment.
in another room someone with a comb and a piece of toilet paper was
trying to keep tune with the military music which was still issuing
from the telescreen.

'it's the children,' said mrs parsons, casting a half-apprehensive glance
at the door. 'they haven't been out today. and of course----'

she had a habit of breaking off her sentences in the middle. the kitchen
sink was full nearly to the brim with filthy greenish water which smelt
worse than ever of cabbage. winston knelt down and examined the angle-joint
of the pipe. he hated using his hands, and he hated bending down, which was
always liable to start him coughing. mrs parsons looked on helplessly.

'of course if tom was home he'd

 put it right in a moment,' she said.
'he loves anything like that. he's ever so good with his hands, tom is.'

parsons was winston's fellow-employee at the ministry of truth. he was
a fattish but active man of paralysing stupidity, a mass of imbecile
enthusiasms--one of those completely unquestioning, devoted drudges on
whom, more even than on the thought police, the stability of the party
depended. at thirty-five he had just been unwillingly evicted from the
youth league, and before graduating into the youth league he had managed to
stay on in the spies for a year beyond the statutory age. at the ministry

s campaigns, and voluntary
activities generally. he would inform you with quiet pride, between whiffs
of his pipe, that he had put in an appearance at the community centre every
evening for the past four years. an overpowering smell of sweat, a sort of
unconscious testimony to the strenuousness of his life, followed him about
wherever he went, and even remained behind him after he had gone.

'have you got a spanner?' said winston, fiddling with the nut on the
angle-joint.

'a spanner,' said mrs parsons, immediately becoming invertebrate. 'i don't
know, i'm sure. perhaps the children----'

there was a trampling of boots and another blast on the comb as the
children charged into the living-room. mrs parsons brought the spanner.
winston let out the water and disgustedly removed the clot of human hair
that had blocked up the pipe. he cleaned his fingers as best he could in
the cold water from the tap and went back into the other room.

'up with your hands!' yelled a savage voice.

enly they were both leaping round him, shouting 'traitor!' and
'thought-criminal!' the little girl imitating her brother in every
movement. it was somehow slightly frightening, like the gambolling of
tiger cubs which will soon grow up into man-eaters. there was a sort of
calculating ferocity in the boy's eye, a quite evident desire to hit or
kick winston and a consciousness of being very nearly big enough to do so.
it was a good job it was not a real pistol he was holding, winston thought.

mrs parsons' eyes flitted nervously from winston to the children, and back
again. in the better light of the living-room he noticed with interest
that there actually was dust in the creases of her face.

'they do get so noisy,' she said. 'they're disappointed because they
couldn't go to see the hanging, that's what it is. i'm too busy to take
them. and tom won't be back from work in time.'

'why can't we go and see the hanging?' roared the boy in his huge voice.

anging!' chanted the little
girl, still capering round.

some eurasian prisoners, guilty of war crimes, were to be hanged in the
park that evening, winston remembered. this happened about once a month,
and was a popular spectacle. children always clamoured to be taken to see
it. he took his leave of mrs parsons and made for the door. but he had not
gone six steps down the passage when something hit the back of his neck an
agonizingly painful blow. it was as though a red-hot wire had been jabbed
into him. he spun round just in time to see mrs parsons dragging her son
back into the doorway while the boy pocketed a catapult.

'goldstein!' bellowed the boy as the door closed on him. but what most
struck winston was the look of helpless fright on the woman's greyish face.

used to gather there before they were finally purged. goldstein himself,
it was said, had sometimes been seen there, years and decades ago. syme's
fate was not difficult to foresee. and yet it was a fact that if syme
grasped, even for three seconds, the nature of his, winston's, secret
opinions, he would betray him instantly to the thought police. so would
anybody else, for that matter: but syme more than most. zeal was not
enough. orthodoxy was unconsciousness.

syme looked up. 'here comes parsons,' he said.

something in the tone of his voice seemed to add, 'that bloody fool'.
parsons, winston's fellow-tenant at victory mansions, was in fact threading
his way across the room--a tubby, middle-sized man with fair hair and a
froglike face. at thirty-five he was already putting on rolls of fat at
neck and waistline, but his movements were brisk and boyish. his whole
appearance was that of a little boy grown large, so much so that although
he was wearing the regulation overalls, it was almos

t impossible not to
think of him as being dressed in the blue shorts, grey shirt, and red
neckerchief of the spies. in visualizing him one saw always a picture of
dimpled knees and sleeves rolled back from pudgy forearms. parsons did,
indeed, invariably revert to shorts when a community hike or any other
physical activity gave him an excuse for doing so. he greeted them both
with a cheery 'hullo, hullo!' and sat down at the table, giving off an
intense smell of sweat. beads of moisture stood out all over his pink face.
his powers of sweating were extraordinary. at the community centre you
could always tell when he had been playing table-tennis by the dampness of
the bat handle. syme had produced a strip of paper on whic

long column of words, and was studying it with an ink-pencil between his
fingers.

'look at him working away in the lunch hour,' said parsons, nudging
winston. 'keenness, eh? what's that you've got there, old boy? something
a bit too brainy for me, i expect. smith, old boy, i'll tell you why i'm
chasing you. it's that sub you forgot to give me.'

'which sub is that?' said winston, automatically feeling for money. about
a quarter of one's salary had to be earmarked for voluntary subscriptions,
which were so numerous that it was difficult to keep track of them.

'for hate week. you know--the house-by-house fund. i'm treasurer for our

winston found and handed over two creased and filthy notes, which parsons
entered in a small notebook, in the neat handwriting of the illiterate.

'by the way, old boy,' he said. 'i hear that little beggar of mine let fly
at you with his catapult yesterday. i gave him a good dressing-down for it.
in fact i told him i'd take the catapult away if he does it again.'

'i think he was a little upset at not going to the execution,' said
winston.

'ah, well--what i mean to say, shows the right spirit, doesn't it?

all they think about is the spies, and the war, of course. d'you know what
that little girl of mine did last saturday, when her troop was on a hike
out berkhamsted way? she got two other girls to go with her, slipped off
from the hike, and spent the whole afternoon following a strange man. they
kept on his tail for two hours, right through the woods, and then, when
they got into amersham, handed him over to the patrols.'

'what did they do that for?' said winston, somewhat taken aback. parsons
went on triumphantly:

'my kid made sure he was some kind of enemy agent--might have been dropped
by parachute, for instance. but here's the point, old boy. what do you
think put her on to him in the first place? she spotted he was wearing a
funny kind of shoes--said she'd never seen anyone wearing shoes like that
before. so the chances were he was a foreigner. pretty smart for a nipper
of seven, eh?'

'what happened to the man?' said winston.

'ah, that i couldn't say, of course. but i wouldn'

for the explosion.

'good,' said syme abstractedly, without looking up from his strip of paper.

'of course we can't afford to take chances,' agreed winston dutifully.

'what i mean to say, there is a war on,' said parsons.

as though in confirmation of this, a trumpet call floated from the
telescreen just above their heads. however, it was not the proclamation of
a military victory this time, but merely an announcement from the ministry
of plenty.

'comrades!' cried an eager youthful voice. 'attention, comrades! we have
glorious news for you. we have won the battle for production! returns now
completed of the output of all classes of consumption goods show that the
standard of living has risen by no less than 20

 per cent over the past
year. all over oceania this morning there were irrepressible spontaneous
demonstrations when workers marched out of factories and offices and
paraded through the streets with banners voicing their gratitude to big
brother for the new, happy life which his wise leadership has bestowed
upon us. here are some of the completed figures. foodstuffs----'

the phrase 'our new, happy life' recurred several times. it had been a
favourite of late with the ministry of plenty. parsons, his attention
caught by the trumpet call, sat listening with a sort of gaping solemnity,
a sort of edified boredom. he could not follow the figures, but he was
aware that they were in some way a cause for satisfaction. he had lugged
out a huge and filthy pipe which was already half full of charred tobacco.
with the tobacco ration at 100 grammes a week it was seldom possible to
fill a pipe to the top. winston was smoking a victory cigarette which he
held carefully horizontal. the new ration did

nly four cigarettes left. for the moment he had shut his ears to
the remoter noises and was listening to the stuff that streamed out of the
telescreen. it appeared that there had even been demonstrations to thank
big brother for raising the chocolate ration to twenty grammes a week. and
only yesterday, he reflected, it had been announced that the ration was
to be reduced to twenty grammes a week. was it possible that they could
swallow that, after only twenty-four hours? yes, they swallowed it. parsons
swallowed it easily, with the stupidity of an animal. the eyeless creature
at the other table swallowed it fanatically, passionately, with a furious
desire to track down, denounce, and vaporize anyone who should suggest that
last week the ration had been thirty grammes. syme, too--in some more
complex way, involving doublethink, syme swallowed it. was he, then, alone
in the possession of a memory?

the fabulous statistics continued to pour out of the telescreen. as
compared with last year there

o far as he could judge, the majority of people
in airstrip one were small, dark, and ill-favoured. it was curious how that
beetle-like type proliferated in the ministries: little dumpy men, growing
stout very early in life, with short legs, swift scuttling movements, and
fat inscrutable faces with very small eyes. it was the type that seemed to
flourish best under the dominion of the party.

the announcement from the ministry of plenty ended on another trumpet call
and gave way to tinny music. parsons, stirred to vague enthusiasm by the
bombardment of figures, took his pipe out of his mouth.

'the ministry of plenty's certainly done a good job this year,' he said
with a knowing shake of his head. 'by the way, smith old boy, i suppose
you haven't got any razor blades you can let me have?'

'not one,' said winston. 'i've been using the same blade for six weeks
myself.'

'ah, well--just thought i'd ask you, old boy.'

'sorry,' said winston.

the quacking voice from the next table, temporarily s

ilenced during the
ministry's announcement, had started up again, as loud as ever. for some
reason winston suddenly found himself thinking of mrs parsons, with her
wispy hair and the dust in the creases of her face. within two years those
children would be denouncing her to the thought police. mrs parsons would
be vaporized. syme would be vaporized. winston would be vaporized. o'brien
would be vaporized. parsons, on the other hand, would never be vaporized.
the eyeless creature with the quacking voice would never be vaporized.
the little beetle-like men who scuttle so nimbly through the labyrinthine
corridors of ministries they, too, would never be vaporized. and the girl
with dark hair, the girl from the fiction department--she would never be
vaporized either. it seemed to him that he knew instinctively who would
survive and who would perish: though just what it was that made for
survival, it was not

s it was coincidence that she had sat so
close to him two days running. his cigarette had gone out, and he laid it
carefully on the edge of the table. he would finish smoking it after work,
if he could keep the tobacco in it. quite likely the person at the next
table was a spy of the thought police, and quite likely he would be in the
cellars of the ministry of love within three days, but a cigarette end
must not be wasted. syme had folded up his strip of paper and stowed it
away in his pocket. parsons had begun talking again.

'did i ever tell you, old boy,' he said, chuckling round the stem of his
pipe, 'about the time when those two nippers of mine set fire to the old
market-woman's skirt because they saw her wrapping up sausages in a poster
of b.b.? sneaked up behind her and set fire to it with a box of matches.

they were beneath suspicion. as the party slogan put it: 'proles and
animals are free.'

winston reached down and cautiously scratched his varicose ulcer. it
had begun itching again. the thing you invariably came back to was the
impossibility of knowing what life before the revolution had really been
like. he took out of the drawer a copy of a children's history textbook
which he had borrowed from mrs parsons, and began copying a passage into
the diary:


   in the old days (it ran), before the glorious revolution, london was
not the beautiful city that we know today. it was a dark, dirty, miserable
place where hardly anybody had enough to eat and where hundreds and
thousands of poor people had no boots on their feet and not even a roof to
sleep under. children no older than you had to work twelve hours a day for
cruel masters who flogged them with whips if they worked too slowly and
fed them on not

in perfect unity, all thinking the
same thoughts and shouting the same slogans, perpetually working, fighting,
triumphing, persecuting--three hundred million people all with the same
face. the reality was decaying, dingy cities where underfed people shuffled
to and fro in leaky shoes, in patched-up nineteenth-century houses that
smelt always of cabbage and bad lavatories. he seemed to see a vision of
london, vast and ruinous, city of a million dustbins, and mixed up with it
was a picture of mrs parsons, a woman with lined face and wispy hair,
fiddling helplessly with a blocked waste-pipe.

he reached down and scratched his ankle again. day and night the
telescreens bruised your ears with statistics proving that people today
had more food, more clothes, better houses, better recreations--that they
lived longer, worked shorter hours, were bigger, healthier, stronger,
happier, more intelligent, better educated, than the people of fifty years
ago. not a word of it could ever be proved or disprove

ist reading it once
again, just to make sure that the words were really there.

for the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. what was even
worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the
need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. he felt as though a
fire were burning in his belly. lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled
canteen was torment. he had hoped to be alone for a little while during
the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile parsons flopped
down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of
stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for hate week.
he was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mache model of big
brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by
his daughter's troop of spies. the irritating thing was that in the racket
of voices winston could hardly hear what parsons was saying, and was
constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be rep

urs.

the new tune which was to be the theme-song of hate week (the hate song,
it was called) had already been composed and was being endlessly plugged
on the telescreens. it had a savage, barking rhythm which could not exactly
be called music, but resembled the beating of a drum. roared out by
hundreds of voices to the tramp of marching feet, it was terrifying. the
proles had taken a fancy to it, and in the midnight streets it competed
with the still-popular 'it was only a hopeless fancy'. the parsons children
played it at all hours of the night and day, unbearably, on a comb and a
piece of toilet paper. winston's evenings were fuller than ever. squads of
volunteers, organized by parsons, were preparing the street for hate week,
stitching banners, painting posters, erecting flagstaffs on the roofs, and
perilously slinging wires across the street for the reception of streamers.
parsons boasted that victory mansions alone would display four hundred
metres of bunting. he was in his native eleme

what seemed like a long time passed. the pain in winston's belly had
revived. his mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball
falling again and again into the same series of slots. he had only six
thoughts. the pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the
screaming; o'brien; julia; the razor blade. there was another spasm in his
entrails, the heavy boots were approaching. as the door opened, the wave
of air that it created brought in a powerful smell of cold sweat. parsons
walked into the cell. he was wearing khaki shorts and a sports-shirt.

this time winston was startled into self-forgetfulness.

'you here!' he said.

parsons gave winston a glance in which there was neither interest nor
surprise, but only misery. he began walking jerkily up and down, evidently
unable to keep still. each time he straightened his pudgy knees it was
apparent that they were trembling. his eyes had a wide-open, staring look,
as though he could not prevent himself from gazing at some

thing in the
middle distance.

'what are you in for?' said winston.

'thoughtcrime!' said parsons, almost blubbering. the tone of his voice
implied at once a complete admission of his guilt and a sort of incredulous
horror that such a word could be applied to himself. he paused opposite
winston and began eagerly appealing to him: 'you don't think they'll shoot
me, do you, old chap? they don't shoot you if you haven't actually done
anything--only thoughts, which you can't help? i know they give you a fair
hearing. oh, i trust them for that! they'll know my record, won't they?

could make himself pretty useful in a labour-camp. they wouldn't shoot me
for going off the rails just once?'

'are you guilty?' said winston.

'of course i'm guilty!' cried parsons with a servile glance at the
telescreen. 'you don't think the party would arrest an innocent man,
do you?' his frog-like face grew calmer, and even took on a slightly
sanctimonious expression. 'thoughtcrime is a dreadful thing, old man,'
he said sententiously. 'it's insidious. it can get hold of you without
your even knowing it. do you know how it got hold of me? in my sleep! yes,
that's a fact. there i was, working away, trying to do my bit--never knew
i had any bad stuff in my mind at all. an

he sank his voice, like someone who is obliged for medical reasons to
utter an obscenity.

'"down with big brother!" yes, i said that! said it over and over again,
it seems. between you and me, old man, i'm glad they got me before it went
any further. do you know what i'm going to say to them when i go up before
the tribunal? "thank you," i'm going to say, "thank you for saving me
before it was too late."'

'who denounced you?' said winston.

'it was my little daughter,' said parsons with a sort of doleful pride.
'she listened at the keyhole. heard what i was saying, and nipped off to
the patrols the very next day. pretty smart for a nipper of seven, eh?
i don't bear her any grudge for it. in fact i'm proud of her. it shows i
brought her up in the right spirit, anyway.'

he made a few more jerky movements up and down, several times, casting a
longing glance at the lavatory pan. then he suddenly ripped down his
shorts.

'excuse me, old man,' he said. 'i can't help it. it's t

he waiting.'

he plumped his large posterior into the lavatory pan. winston covered his
face with his hands.

'smith!' yelled the voice from the telescreen. '6079 smith w.! uncover your
face. no faces covered in the cells.'

winston uncovered his face. parsons used the lavatory, loudly and
abundantly. it then turned out that the plug was defective and the cell
stank abominably for hours afterwards.

parsons was removed. more prisoners came and went, mysteriously. one, a
woman, was consigned to 'room 101', and, winston noticed, seemed to shrivel
and turn a different colour when she heard the words. a time came when, if
it had been morning when he was brought here, it would be afternoon; or if
it had been afternoon, then it would be midnight. there were six prisoners
in the cell, men and women. all sat very still. opposite winston there sat
a man with a chinless, toothy face exactly like that of som
