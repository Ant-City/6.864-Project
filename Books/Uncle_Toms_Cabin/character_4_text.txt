ambo; “but i do believe!--i
can’t help it! lord jesus, have mercy on us!”

“poor critters!” said tom, “i’d be willing to bar all i have, if it’ll
only bring ye to christ! o, lord! give me these two more souls, i pray!”

that prayer was answered!

the young master


two days after, a young man drove a light wagon up through the avenue of
china trees, and, throwing the reins hastily on the horse’s neck, sprang
out and inquired for the owner of the place.

it was george shelby; and, to show how he came to be there, we must go
back in our story.

the letter of miss ophelia to mrs. shelby had, by some unfortunate
accident, been detained, for a month or two, at some remote post-office,
before it reached its destination; and, of course, before it was
received, tom was already lost to view among the distant swamps of the
red river.

mrs. shelby read the intelligence with the deepest concern; but
any immediate action upon it was an impossibility. she was then in
attendance

changed from a boy to a tall young man, was her constant and faithful
assistant, and her only reliance in superintending his father’s affairs.
miss ophelia had taken the precaution to send them the name of the
lawyer who did business for the st. clares; and the most that, in the
emergency, could be done, was to address a letter of inquiry to him.
the sudden death of mr. shelby, a few days after, brought, of course, an
absorbing pressure of other interests, for a sea

she stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she had noticed trunks
for sale, and purchased a handsome one. this she requested the man to
send along with her. and, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling
her trunk, and emmeline behind her, carrying her carpet-bag and sundry
bundles, she made her appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of
consideration.

the first person that struck her, after her arrival, was george shelby,
who was staying there, awaiting the next boat.

cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret, and
seen him bear away the body of tom, and observed with secret exultation,
his rencontre with legree. subsequently she had gathered, from the
conversations she had overheard among the negroes, as she glided about
in her ghostly disguise, after nightfall, who he was, and in what
relation he stood to tom. she, therefore, felt an immediate accession of
confidence, when she found tha

poor cassy! when she recovered, turned her face to the wall, and wept
and sobbed like a child,--perhaps, mother, you can tell what she was
thinking of! perhaps you cannot,--but she felt as sure, in that hour,
that god had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,--as
she did, months afterwards,--when--but we anticipate.

the rest of our story is soon told. george shelby, interested, as any
other young man might be, by the romance of the incident, no less than
by feelings of humanity, was at the pains to send to cassy the bill
of sale of eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own
knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity
of her child. it remained now only for her to trace out the path of the
fugitives.

madame de thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence
of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to

george, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for africa,
some few weeks after. if we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear
from him there.

of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except
a word relating to miss ophelia and topsy, and a farewell chapter, which
we shall dedicate to george shelby.

miss ophelia took topsy home to vermont with her, much to the surprise
of the grave deliberative body whom a new englander recognizes under
the term “_our folks_.” “our folks,” at first, thought it an odd and
unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but,
so thoroughly efficient was miss ophelia in her conscientious endeavor
to do her duty by her _élève_, that the child rapidly grew in grace and
in favor with the family and neighborhood. at the age of womanh

p.s.--it will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that
some inquiries, which were set on foot by madame de thoux, have resulted
recently in the discovery of cassy’s son. being a young man of energy,
he had escaped, some years before his mother, and been received and
educated by friends of the oppressed in the north. he will soon follow
his family to africa.

the liberator


george shelby had written to his mother merely a line, stating the day
that she might expect him home. of the death scene of his old friend
he had not the heart to write. he had tried several times, and only
succeeded in half choking himself; and invariably finished by tearing up
the paper, wiping his eyes, and rushing somewhere to get quiet.

there was a pleased bustle all though the shelby mansion, that day, in
expectation of the arrival of young mas’r george.

mrs. shelby was seated in her comfortable p
