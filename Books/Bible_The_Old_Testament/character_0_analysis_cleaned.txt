[CHARACTER]
in the old testament, [CHARACTER] is unique, sovereign, and unchanging.
he differs from greek [CHARACTER]s, whose faults and quarrels cause events.
his unchanging nature is hinted at by his names. in biblical hebrew, [CHARACTER]
is called "yahweh," meaning "to be." this
title is similar to the title [CHARACTER] uses with moses, "i
am who i am." however, the [CHARACTER] presented in old testament
does contradict himself at times. in the course of two chapters
in exodus, [CHARACTER] threatens to destroy the israelites, relents, and
then pronounces himself loving, forgiving, and slow to anger. [CHARACTER]
grants himself the power of self-description; he is whoever he says
he is.

each biblical writer gives [CHARACTER] human characteristics.
for example, [CHARACTER] speaks. we do not know how his listeners recognize
that it is he who is speaking or what he sounds like, but [CHARACTER] certainly embraces
the ability to articulate his intentions through the human convention
of language. also, [CHARACTER] assumes human form. he appears as an angel,
as a group of three men, and as a mysterious army commander. in
a sense, [CHARACTER] takes on human qualities like a costume that can also
be taken off, since his specific appearances do not offer a complete
picture of him. still, these manifestations suggest that there is
a fundamental humanity to the personality of the hebrew [CHARACTER]. [CHARACTER]
casually walks in the garden with adam and eve. he even physically
wrestles jacob and allows jacob to beat him. these humble and endearing
qualities of [CHARACTER] contrast his later appearances as a pillar of fire
and a thunderous mountain. the more extreme manifestations are,
like the human manifestations, only a part of [CHARACTER]'s character rather
than his sole mode of existence.
[CHARACTER]'s initial interaction with humankind is unsolicited.
noah, abraham, and moses do not ask [CHARACTER] to form a relationship with them.
even when [CHARACTER] is unseen, his immense power over human fate lurks
beneath the events of the old testament narrative. on the surface,
the characters' experiences are filled with suspense. the characters
submit to chance and have a desperate, irrational faith in [CHARACTER].
when [CHARACTER] speaks or appears, we realize he has been in control all
along, and the fear or suspense seems unfounded, trite, or comical.
amidst the gravity of human events, [CHARACTER]'s willingness to cause momentous
events in order to teach a lesson shows him to be a strangely playful
character.
