as already a fresh
departure for me. i was not used to get things that way, you know. i
always went my own road and on my own legs where i had a mind to go. i
wouldn’t have believed it of myself; but, then--you see--i felt somehow
i must get there by hook or by crook. so i worried them. the men said
‘my dear fellow,’ and did nothing. then--would you believe it?--i tried
the women. i, charlie marlow, set the women to work--to get a job.
heavens! well, you see, the notion drove me. i had an aunt, a dear
enthusiastic soul. she wrote: ‘it will be delightful. i am ready to do
anything, anything for you. it is a glorious idea. i know the wife of a
very high personage in the administration, and also a man who has lots
of influence with,’ etc. she was determined to make no end of fuss to
get me appointed skipper of a river steamboat, if such was my fancy.

“i got my appointment--of course; and i got it very quick. it appears
the company had received news that one of their captains had

i was not in the least typical.
‘if i were,’ said i, ‘i wouldn’t be talking like this with you.’ ‘what
you say is rather profound, and probably erroneous,’ he said, with a
laugh. ‘avoid irritation more than exposure to the sun. _adieu_. how do
you english say, eh? good-bye. ah! good-bye. _adieu_. in the tropics one
must before everything keep calm.’... he lifted a warning forefinger....
‘_du calme, du calme_.’

“one thing more remained to do--say good-bye to my excellent aunt. i
found her triumphant. i had a cup of tea--the last decent cup of tea for
many days--and in a room that most soothingly looked just as you would
expect a lady’s drawing-room to look, we had a long quiet chat by the
fireside. in the course of these confidences it became quite plain to me
i had been represented to the wife of the high dignitary, and goodness
knows to how many more people besides, as an exceptional and gifted
creature--a piece of good fortune for the company--a man you don’t

_he_ comes here, a special being, as you ought to
know.’ ‘why ought i to know?’ i interrupted, really surprised. he paid
no attention. ‘yes. today he is chief of the best station, next year he
will be assistant-manager, two years more and... but i dare-say you
know what he will be in two years’ time. you are of the new gang--the
gang of virtue. the same people who sent him specially also recommended
you. oh, don’t say no. i’ve my own eyes to trust.’ light dawned upon me.
my dear aunt’s influential acquaintances were producing an unexpected
effect upon that young man. i nearly burst into a laugh. ‘do you read
the company’s confidential correspondence?’ i asked. he hadn’t a word
to say. it was great fun. ‘when mr. kurtz,’ i continued, severely, ‘is
general manager, you won’t have the opportunity.’

“he blew the candle out suddenly, and we went outside. the moon had
risen. black figures strolled about listlessly, pouring water on
the glow, whence proceede

ng on tall spears, stood in the sunlight under
fantastic head-dresses of spotted skins, warlike and still in statuesque
repose. and from right to left along the lighted shore moved a wild and
gorgeous apparition of a woman.

“she walked with measured steps, draped in striped and fringed cloths,
treading the earth proudly, with a slight jingle and flash of barbarous
ornaments. she carried her head high; her hair was done in the shape of
a helmet; she had brass leggings to the knee, brass wire gauntlets to
the elbow, a crimson spot on her tawny cheek, innumerable necklaces of
glass beads on her neck; bizarre things, charms, gifts of witch-men,
that hung about her, glittered and trembled at every step. she must have
had the value of several elephant tusks upon her. she was savage and
superb, wild-eyed and magnificent; there was something ominous and
stately in her deliberate progress. and in the hush that had fallen
suddenly upon the whole sorrowful land, the immense wilderness, the
colossa

’ the pilgrims looked upon me with disfavour. i was,
so to speak, numbered with the dead. it is strange how i accepted this
unforeseen partnership, this choice of nightmares forced upon me in the
tenebrous land invaded by these mean and greedy phantoms.

“kurtz discoursed. a voice! a voice! it rang deep to the very last. it
survived his strength to hide in the magnificent folds of eloquence the
barren darkness of his heart. oh, he struggled! he struggled! the wastes
of his weary brain were haunted by shadowy images now--images of wealth
and fame revolving obsequiously round his unextinguishable gift of noble
and lofty expression. my intended, my station, my career, my
ideas--these were the subjects for the occasional utterances of elevated
sentiments. the shade of the original kurtz frequented the bedside of
the hollow sham, whose fate it was to be buried presently in the mould
of primeval earth. but both the diabolic love and the unearthly hate of
the mysteries it had penetrated fough

ttle money from each other, to devour
their infamous cookery, to gulp their unwholesome beer, to dream their
insignificant and silly dreams. they trespassed upon my thoughts. they
were intruders whose knowledge of life was to me an irritating pretence,
because i felt so sure they could not possibly know the things i knew.
their bearing, which was simply the bearing of commonplace individuals
going about their business in the assurance of perfect safety, was
offensive to me like the outrageous flauntings of folly in the face of
a danger it is unable to comprehend. i had no particular desire to
enlighten them, but i had some difficulty in restraining myself from
laughing in their faces so full of stupid importance. i daresay i was
not very well at that time. i tottered about the streets--there were
various affairs to settle--grinning bitterly at perfectly respectable
persons. i admit my behaviour was inexcusable, but then my temperature
was seldom normal in these days. my dear aunt’s endea
