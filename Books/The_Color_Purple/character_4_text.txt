hang crooked, the curtains torn. the bed look like the stuffing pulled out. they don't notice. they fight. he try to slap her.
what he do that for? she reach down and grab a piece of stove wood and whack him cross the eyes. he punch her in the
stomach, she double over groaning but come up with both hands lock right under his privates. he roll on the floor.

children by the creek, walk back on up home.

saturday morning early, us hear the wagon. harpo, sofia, the two babies be going off for the week-end, to visit sofia
sister.


dear god,

i pray she don't find out, but she do.

she say. all my life i had to fight. i had to fight my daddy. i had to fight my brothers. i had to fight my cousins and my
uncles. a girl child ain't safe in a family of men. but i never thought i'd have to fight in my own house. she let out her
breath. i loves harpo, she say. god knows i do. but i'll kill him dead before i let him beat me. now if you want a dead son-
in-law you just keep on advising him like you doing. she put her hand on her hip. i used to hunt game with a bow and
arrow, she say.

i stop the little trembling that started when i saw her coming. i'm so shame of myself, i say. and the lord he done whip

what about all them funny voices you hear singing in church? shug say. what about all them sounds that sound good but
they not the sounds you thought folks could make? what bout that? then she start moaning. sound like d

 it raise the hair on the back of your neck. but it really sound sort of like panthers
would sound if they could sing.

i tell you something else, shug say to mary agnes, listening to you sing, folks git to thinking bout a good screw.

aw, miss shug, say mary agnes, changing color.

shug say. what, too shamefaced to put singing and dancing and fucking together? she laugh. that's the reason they call
what us sing the devil's music. devils love to fuck. listen, she say. let's go sing one night at harpo place. be like old times
for me. and if i bring you before the crowd, they better listen with respect. niggers don't know how to act, but if you git
through the first half of one song, you got 'em.

you reckon that's the truth? say mary agnes. she all big eyed and delight.

i don't know if i want her to sing, say harpo.

how come? ast shug. that woman you got singing now can't git her ass out the church. folks don't know whether to
dance or creep to the mourner's bench. plus, you dress mary agn

little room up under the house, but it was better than prison. flies, maybe, but no rats.

anyhow, they kept her eleven and a half years, give her six months off for good behavior so she could come home early to
her family. her bigger children married and gone, and her littlest childr

have the nerve to try to act in front of me.

besides, she say. you not my maid. i didn't bring you to memphis to be that. i brought you here to love you and help you

dear nettie,


the first thing i notice bout mr. is how clean he is. his skin shine. his hair brush back.

when he walk by the casket to review sofia mother's body he stop, whisper something to her. pat her shoulder. on his
way back to his seat he look over at me. i raise my fan and look off the other way.

us went back to harpo's after the funeral.

i know you won't believe this. miss celie, say sofia, but mr. act like he trying to git religion.

big a devil as he is, i say, trying is bout all he can do.

he don't go to church or nothing, but he not so quick to judge. he work real hard too.

i don't say nothing.

they put her away nice, he say.

they sure did, i say.

and so many grandchildren, he say. well. twelve children, all busy multiplying. just the family enough to fill the church.
yeah, i say. that's the truth.

how long you here for? he say.

you know harpo and sofia baby girl real sick? he say.

naw, i didn't, i say. i point to henrietta in the crowd. there she is over there, i say. she look just fine.

yeah, she look fine, he say, but she got some kind of blood disease. blood sort of clot up in her veins every once in a
while, make her sick as a dog. i don't think she gon make it, he say.

great goodness of life, i say.

yeah, he say. it hard for sofia. she still have to try to prop up that white gal she raise. now her mama dead. her health

africa. seem like to me she mention something bout blood clots. i try to remember what she say african peoples do, but i
can't. talking to mr. such a surprise i can't think of nothing. not even nothing else to say.

mr. stand waiting for me to say something, looking off up to his house. finally he say. good evening, and walk

away.

sofia say after i left, mr. live like a pig. shut up in the house so much it stunk. wouldn't let nobody in until finally

harpo force his way in. clean the house, got food. give his daddy a bath. mr. too weak to fight back. plus, too far

gone to care.

he couldn't sleep, she say. at night he thought he heard bats outside the door. other things rattling in the chimney. but
the worse part was having to listen to his own heart. it did pretty well as long as there was daylight, but soon as night
come, it went crazy. beating so loud it shook the room. sound like drums.

harpo went up there plenty nights to sleep with him, s

big and stout harpo is. well, one night i walked up to tell harpo somethingâ€” and the two of them was just laying there on
the bed fast asleep. harpo holding his daddy in his arms.

after that, i start to feel again for harpo, sofia say. and pretty soon us start work on our new house. she laugh. but did i
say it been easy? if i did, god would make me cut my own switch.

what make him pull through? i ast.

oh, she say, harpo made him send you the rest of your sister's letters. right after that he start to improve. you know

like its full of little white men with hammers.

sometime i meet up with mr. visiting henrietta. he dream up his own little sneaky recipes. for instance, one time

he hid the yams in peanut butter. us sit by the fire with harpo and sofia and play a hand or two of bid whist, while suzie

there so long, it look just like him. two straight chairs always on the porch, turned against the wall. porch railings with
flower cans on them. he keep it painted now though. fresh and white. and guess what he collect just cause he like them?
he collect shells. all kinds of shells. tarrapin, snail and all kinds of

r two reasons. one, he love shug.
and two, shug use to love him. plus, look like he trying to make something out of himself. i don't mean just that he work
and he clean up after himself and he appreciate some of the things god was playful enough to make. i mean when you
talk to him now he really listen, and one time, out of nowhere in the conversation us was having, he said celie, i'm
satisfied this the first time i ever lived on earth as a natural man. it feel like a new experience.

sofia and harpo always try to set me up with some man. they know i love shug but they think womens love just by

accident, anybody handy likely to do. everytime i go to harpo's some little policy salesman git all up in my face. mr.

have to come to the rescue. he tell the man. this lady my wife. the man vanish out the door.

us sit, have a cold drink. talk about our days together with shug. talk about the time she come home sick. the little
crooked song she use to sing. all our fine evenings down at harpo's.


 
 ___________________________
 
 them both welcome, or die trying. who am i to tell her
who to love? my job just to love her good and true myself.

mr. ast me the other day what it is i love so much bout shug. he say he love her style. he say to tell the truth, shug

act more manly than most men. i mean she upright, honest. speak her mind and the devil take the hindmost, he say. you
know shug will fight, he say. just like sofia. she bound to live her life and be herself no matter what.

mr. think all this is stuff men do. but harpo not like this, i tell him. you not like this. what shug got is womanly it

seem like to me. specially since she and sofia the ones got it.

sofia and shug not like men, he say, but they not like women either.

you mean they not like you or me.

they hold they own, he say. and it's different

what i love best bout shug is what she been through, i say. when you look in shug's eyes you know she been where she
been, seen what she seen, did what she did. and now she know.

that's the truth, say mr.

ored cause they never had nobody in a store to wait on 'em before and nobody in a store to treat 'em nice. sofia real
good at selling stuff too cause she act like she don't care if you buy or not. no skin off her nose. and then if you decide to
buy anyhow, well, she might exchange a few pleasant words with you. plus, she scare that white man. anybody else
colored he try to call 'em auntie or something. first time he try that with sofia she ast him which colored man his mama
sister marry.

i ast harpo do he mind if sofia work.

what i'm gon mind for? he say. it seem to make her happy. and i can take care of anything come up at home. anyhow, he
say, sofia got me a little help for when henrietta need anything special to eat or git sick.

yeah, say sofia. miss eleanor jane gon look in on henrietta and every other day promise to cook her something she'll eat.

things, you learn about the little ones, almost by accident. but you never know nothing more about the big things than
you start out with. the more i wonder, he say, the more i love.


and people start to love you back, i bet, i say.

they do, he say, surprise. harpo seem to love me. sofia and the children. i think even ole evil henrietta love me a little bit,
but that's cause she know she just as big a mystery to me as the man in the moon.

mr. is busy patterning a shirt for folks to wear with my pants.

got to have pockets, he say. got to have loose sleeves. and definitely you not spose to wear it with no tie. folks wearing
