 we shall be pitied someday. it is still impossible for man to organize his social 
life  without  repressions,  and  the  balance  has  yet  to  be  struck  between  order  and 
freedom. 

the witch-hunt was not, however, a mere repression. it was also, and as importantly, 
a long overdue opportunity for every-one so inclined to express publicly his guilt and 
sins, under the cover of accusations against the victims. it suddenly became possible - 
and patriotic and holy - for a man to say that martha corey had come into his bedroom 
at night, and that, while his wife was sleeping at his side, martha laid herself down on 
his  chest  and  “nearly  suffocated  him.”  of  course  it  was  her  spirit  only,  but  his 
satisfaction at confessing himself was no lighter than if it had been martha herself. one 
could not ordinarily speak such things in public. 

long-held  hatreds  of  neighbors  could  now  be  openly  ex-pressed,  and  vengeance 
taken,  despite  the  bible’s  charitable

than martha. 
 
hale: how is rebecca charged, mr. nurse? 
 
francis,  with  a  mocking,  half-hearted  laugh:  for  murder,  she’s  charged! 
mockingly quoting the warrant: “for the marvelous and supernatural murder of 
goody putnam’s babies.” what am i to do, mr. hale?

there is a plain bench at the left, and another at the right. in the center a rather 
long meeting table, with stools and a con-siderable armchair snugged up to it. 
 
through the partitioning wall at the right we hear a prosecutor’s voice, judge 
hathorne’s,  asking  a  question;  then  a  woman’s  voice,  martha  corey’s, 
replying. 
 
hathorne's voice: now, martha corey, there is abundant evidence in our hands 
to show that you have given yourself to the reading of fortunes, do you deny it? 
 
martha corey’s voice: i am innocent to a witch. i know not what a witch 
is.

proctor? and i beg you be clear, open as the sky, and honest. 
 
proctor, as he takes out several papers: i am no lawyer, so i'll - 
 
danforth: the pure in heart need no lawyers. proceed as you will. 
 
proctor, handing danforth a paper: will you read this first, sir? it’s a sort of 
testament. the people signing it declare their good opinion of rebecca, and my 
wife, and martha corey. danforth looks down at the paper. 
 
parris, to enlist danforth’s sarcasm: their good opinion! but danforth goes on 
reading, and proctor is heartened. 
 
proctor: these are all landholding farmers, members of the church. delicately, 
trying to point out a paragraph: if you’ll notice, sir - they’ve known the women 
many years and never saw no sign they had dealings with the devil. 
 

parris nervously moves over and reads over dan forth’s shoulder.

parris,  prayerfully  holding  up  his  hands:  excellency,  hear  me.  it  is  a  providence. 
reverend hale has returned to bring rebecca nurse to god. 
 
danforth, surprised: he bids her confess? 
 
parris, sitting: hear me. rebecca have not given me a word this three month since she 
came. now she sits with him, and her sister and martha corey and two or three others, 
and he pleads with them, confess their crimes and save their lives. 
 
danforth: why - this is indeed a providence. and they soften, they soften? 
 
parris: not yet, not yet. but i thought to summon you, sir, that we might think on 
whether it be not wise, to - he dares not’

danforth: mr. proctor. when the devil came to you did you see rebecca nurse in his 
company? proctor is silent. come, man, take courage - did you ever see her with the 
devil? 
 
proctor, almost inaudibly: no. 
 
daiforth, now sensing trouble, glances at john and goes to the table, and picks up a 
sheet - the list of condemned. 
 
danforth: did you ever see her sister, mary easty, with the devil? 
 
proctor: no, i did not. 
 
danforth, his eyes narrow on proctor: did you ever see martha corey with the devil? 
 
proctor: i did not. 
 
danforth, realizing, slowly putting the sheet down: did you ever see anyone with the 
devil? 
 
proctor: i did not. 
 
danforth: proctor, you mistake me. i am not empowered to trade your life for a lie. you 
have most certainly seen some person with the devil. proctor is silent. mr. proctor, a 
score of people have already testified they saw this woman with the devil. 
 
proctor: then it is proved. why must i say it?
