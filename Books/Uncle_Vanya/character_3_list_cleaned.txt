[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER])  - 
      the play's brooding and deliberate philosopher, astrov is an overworked country doctor who feels ruined by provincial life. he is almost always deep in introspection, finding himself numb to the world, unable to want and love, and dejected at the thought that he will be forgotten in the course of time. continually described as "eccentric" and "strange," he nevertheless is something of a visionary in his passion for conversation, decrying the degeneration of the land and destructive impulse he finds in man and hoping to leave his legacy to future generations. according to critic eugene bristow, astrov's name suggests the word for "stars," which bristow perhaps simplistically reads as in keeping with his high moral purpose.
