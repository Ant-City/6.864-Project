no, let me speak; and let me rail so high

provok'd by my offence.

cleopatra.

antony.
gentle, hear me:

cleopatra.
my resolution and my hands i'll trust;
none about caesar.

the miserable change now at my end
lament nor sorrow at: but please your thoughts
in feeding them with those my former fortunes
wherein i liv'd, the greatest prince o' the world,
the noblest; and do now not basely die,
not cowardly put off my helmet to
my countryman, a roman by a roman
valiantly vanquish'd. now my spirit is going:
i can no more.

cleopatra.
my desolation does begin to make
a better life. 'tis paltry to be caesar;
not being fortune, he's but fortune's knave,
a minister of her will: and it is great
to do that thing that ends all other deeds;
which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
the beggar's nurse and caesar's.

[enter, to the gates of the monument, proculeius, gallus, and

proculeius.
caesar sends greetings to the queen of egypt;
and bids thee study on what fair demands
thou mean'st to have him grant thee.

cleopatra.
what's thy name?

proculeius.
my name is proculeius.

cleopatra.
antony
did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
i do not greatly care to be deceiv'd,
that have no use for trusting. if your master
would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him
that majesty, to keep decorum, must
no less beg than a ki

be of good cheer;
you are fallen into a princely hand; fear nothing:
make your full reference freely to my lord,
who is so full of grace that it flows over
on all that need: let me report to him
your sweet dependency; and you shall find
a conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness
where he for grace is kneel'd to.
