Cat Lady / Mrs. Weathers - 
Played by Miriam Karlin
                The woman Alex
goes to prison for murdering, and the one victim who fights back.
When the cat lady sees Alex in her home, she doesn't cower. Instead,
she attacks him with a bust of Beethoven. She is wealthy, haughty,
and unafraid, and she has filled her home with dozens if not hundreds
of cats. Alex finds her in an exercise room, which she has decorated
with modern, almost cartoonlike paintings of women in sexual and
sadistic poses.
