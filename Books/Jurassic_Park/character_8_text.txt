ory building, it
opened with a security card. ed regis slipped the card in the slot; the light blinked; and the door
opened.
inside, tim saw a small room bathed in green light. four technicians in lab coats were peering
into double-barreled stereo microscopes, or looking at images on high resolution video screens.
the room was filled with yellow stones. the stones were in glass shelves; in cardboard boxes; in
large pull-out trays. each stone was tagged and numbered in black ink.
regis introduced henry wu, a slender man in his thirties. "dr. wu is our chief geneticist. i'll let
him explain what we do here."
henry wu smiled. "at least i'll try," he said. "genetics is a bit complicated. but you're probably
wondering where our dinosaur dna comes from."
"it crossed my mind," grant said. 
"as a matter of fact," wu said, "there are two possible sources. using the loy antibody
extraction technique, we can sometimes get dna directly from dinosaur bones."
"what kind of a yield?" grant asked.
"well, most

well, these dinosaurs must be even more reluctant than lions and tigers. after all, they come
from a time before human beings-or even large mammals-existed at all. god knows what they
think when they see us. so i wonder: have they learned, somewhere along the line, that humans
are easy to kill?"
the group fell silent as they walked.
"in any case," malcolm said, "i shall be extremely interested to see the control room now." 
version 4.4
"was there any problem with the group?" hammond asked.
"no," henry wu said, "there was no problem at all."
"they accepted your explanation?"
"why shouldn't they?" wu said. "it's all quite straightforward, in the broad strokes. it's only the
details that get sticky. and i wanted to talk about the details with you today. you can think of it as
a matter of aesthetics."
john hammond wrinkled his nose, as if he smelled something disagreeable. "aesthetics?" he
repeated.
they were standing in the living room of hammond's elegant bungalow, set back among palm
trees in th

lain this to hammond?
hammond hardly ever visited the island. and it was a peculiar situation that wu was trying to
convey. "right now, as we stand here, almost no one in the world has ever seen an actual
dinosaur. nobody knows what they're really like."
"yes . . ."
"the dinosaurs we have now are real," wu said, pointing to the screens around the room, "but
in certain ways they are unsatisfactory, unconvincing. i could make them better."
"better in what way?"
"for one thing, they move too fast," henry wu said. "people aren't accustomed to seeing large
animals that are so quick. i'm afraid visitors will think the dinosaurs look speeded up, like film
running too fast."
"but, henry, these are real dinosaurs. you said so yourself."
"i know," wu said. "but we could easily breed slower, more domesticated dinosaurs."
"domesticated dinosaurs?" hammond snorted. "nobody wants domesticated dinosaurs,
henry. they want the real thing."
"but that's my point," wu said. "i don't think they do. they want to see

missiles and laser-guided devices?"
"let's leave muldoon out of this," hammond said. "i'm not worried. it's just a zoo, henry."
the phone rang, and hammond went to answer it. wu tried to think of another way to press his
case. but the fact was that, after five long years, jurassic park was nearing completion, and john
hammond lust wasn't listening to him any more.
there had been a time when hammond listened to wu very attentively. especially when he had
first recruited him, back in the days when henry wu was a twenty-eight-year-old graduate
student getting his doctorate at stanford in norman atherton's tab.
atherton's death had thrown the lab into confusion as well as mourning; no one knew what
would happen to the funding or the doctoral programs. there was a lot of uncertainty; people
worried about their careers.
two weeks after the funeral, john hammond came to see wu. everyone in the lab knew that
atherton had had some association with hammond, although the details were never clear. but

ning, once they began to understand that dinosaurs were so
similar to birds. it was avian cloning, a very different proposition. much more difficult. and for the
last two years, wu had been primarily an administrator, supervising teams of researchers and
banks of computer-operated gene sequencers. administration wasn't the kind of work he
relished. it wasn't what he had bargained for.
still, he had succeeded. he had done what nobody really believed could be done, at least in so
short a time. and henry wu thought that he should have some rights, some say in what
happened, by virtue of his expertise and his efforts. instead, he found his influence waning with
each passing day. the dinosaurs existed. the procedures for obtaining them were worked out to
the point of being routine. the technologies were mature. and john hammond didn't need henry
wu any more.
"that should be fine," hammond said, speaking into the phone. he listened for a while, and
smiled at wu. "fine. yes. fine." he hung up. "where

hands. the dinosaur had torn him open. his guts had fallen out.
nedry fell to the ground and landed on something scaly and cold, it was the animal's foot, and
then there was new pain on both sides of his head. the pain grew worse, and as he was lifted to
his feet he knew the dinosaur had his head in its jaws, and the horror of that realization was
followed by a final wish, that it would all be ended soon.

"more coffee?" hammond asked politely.
"no, thank you," henry wu said, leaning back in his chair. "i couldn't eat anything more." they
were sitting in the dining room of hammond's bungalow, in a secluded corner of the park not far
from the labs. wu had to admit that the bungalow hammond had built for himself was elegant,
with sparse, almost japanese lines. and the dinner had been excellent, considering the dining
room wasn't fully staffed yet.
but there was something about hammond that wu found troubling. the old man was different in
some way . . . subtly di

arkness. it was another
ten minutes before they saw the welcoming lights of the safari lodge. and as harding pulled to a
stop in front of the visitor center, they saw muldoon coming toward them. he was shouting, and
waving his arms.
"god damn it, arnold, you son of a bitch! god damn it, get this park back on track! now! get my
grandkids back here! now!" john hammond stood in the control room, screaming and stamping
his little feet. he had been carrying on this way for the last two minutes, while henry wu stood in
the corner, looking stunned.
"well, mr. hammond," arnold said, "muldoon's on his way out right now, to do exactly that."
arnold turned away, and lit another cigarette. hammond was like every other management guy
arnold had ever seen. whether it was disney or the navy, management guys always behaved
the same. they never understood the technical issues; and they thought that screaming was the
way to make things happen. and maybe it was, if you were shouting at your secretaries to get

 again. "look, donald," hammond said. "let's not get carried away. we've had a
little breakdown from the storm or whatever, and as a result we've suffered a regrettable,
unfortunate accident. and that's all that's happened. we're dealing with it. arnold will get the
computers cleaned up. muldoon will pick up the kids, and i have no doubt he'll be back with them
by the time we finish this ice cream. so let's just wait and see what develops, shall we?"
"whatever you say, sir," gennaro said.
"why?" henry wu said, looking at the console screen.
"because i think nedry did something to the code," arnold said. "that's why i'm checking it."
"all right," wu said. "but have you tried your options?" "like
what?" arnold said.
"i don't know. aren't the safety systems still running?" wu said. "keychecks? all that?"
"jesus," arnold said, snapping his fingers. "they must be. safety systems can't be turned off
except at the main panel."
"well," wu said, "if keycheeks is active, you can trace what he did."
