ng was all right.
after luncheon the divers and the norths and rosemary
went to the franco-american films, to be joined by collis
clay, her young man from new haven, to whom she had
telephoned. he was a georgian, with the peculiarly regular,
even stencilled ideas of southerners who are educated in the
north. last winter she had thought him attractive—once
they held hands in an automobile going from new haven to
new york; now he no longer existed for her.
in the projection room she sat between collis clay and
dick while the mechanic mounted the reels of daddy’s girl

and a french executive fluttered about her trying to talk
american slang. ‘yes, boy,’ he said when there was trouble
with the projector, ‘i have not any benenas.’ then the lights
went out, there was the sudden click and a flickering noise
and she was alone with dick at last. they looked at each
other in the half darkness.
‘dear rosemary,’ he murmured. their shoulders
touched. nicole

nicole and mary urged him ironically to seize the opportunity;
they teased him, both faintly annoyed at not having
been asked for a sitting. but dick closed the subject with a
somewhat tart discussion of actors: ‘the strongest guard is
placed at the gateway to nothing,’ he said. ‘maybe because
the condition of emptiness is too shameful to be divulged.’
in the taxi with dick and collis clay—they were dropping
collis, and dick was taking rosemary to a tea from
which nicole and the norths had resigned in order to do the
things abe had left undone till the last—in the taxi rosemary
reproached him.
‘i thought if the test turned out to be good i could take it
to california with me. and then maybe if they liked it you’d
come out and be my leading man in a picture.’
he was overwhelmed. ‘it was a darn sweet thought, but
i’d rather look at you. you were about the nicest sight

but always there was dick. rosemary assured the image
of her mother, ever carried with her, that never, never had
she known any one so nice, so thoroughly nice as dick was
that night. she compared him with the two englishmen,
whom abe addressed conscientiously as ‘major hengest
and mr. horsa,’ and with the heir to a scandinavian throne
and the novelist just back from russia, and with abe, who
was desperate and witty, and with collis clay, who joined
them somewhere and stayed along—and felt there was no
comparison. the enthusiasm, the selflessness behind the
whole performance ravished her, the technic of moving
many varied types, each as immobile, as dependent on supplies
of attention as an infantry battalion is dependent on
rations, appeared so effortless that he still had pieces of his
own most personal self for everyone.

he was profoundly unhappy and the subsequent increase of
egotism tended momentarily to blind him to what was going
on round about him, and deprive him of the long groundswell
of imagination that he counted on for his judgments.
after mary north left them, accompanied by the italian
singing teacher who had joined them for coffee and was taking
her to her train, rosemary, too, stood up, bound for an
engagement at her studio: ‘meet some officials.’
‘and oh—‘ she proposed ‘—if collis clay, that southern
boy—if he comes while you are still sitting here, just tell
him i couldn’t wait; tell him to call me to-morrow.’
too insouciant, in reaction from the late disturbance,
she had assumed the privileges of a child—the result being

also that, except
while their children were being born, dick had not spent
a night apart from her since their marriage. on the other
hand, there was a pleasingness about him that simply had
to be used—those who possessed that pleasingness had to
keep their hands in, and go along attaching people that they
had no use to make of.
now dick hardened himself and let minutes pass without
making any gesture of confidence, any representation of
constantly renewed surprise that they were one together.
collis clay out of the south edged a passage between the

closely packed tables and greeted the divers cavalierly. such
salutations always astonished dick—acquaintances saying
‘hi!’ to them, or speaking only to one of them. he felt so intensely
about people that in moments of apathy he preferred
to remain concealed; that one could parade a casualness into
his presence was a challenge to the key on which he lived.

change taking place within him. only the image of a third

rosemary was needed to throw him off his balance and
send through him waves of pain, misery, desire, desperation.
the vividly pictured hand on rosemary’s cheek, the

collis clay was now speaking about fraternity politics at
new haven, in the same tone, with the same emphasis. dick
had gathered that he was in love with rosemary in some curious
way dick could not have understood. the affair with

rosemary returned to her desk and finished a letter to
her mother.
‘—i only saw him for a little while but i thought he was
wonderful looking. i fell in love with him (of course i do
love dick best but you know what i mean). he really is
going to direct the picture and is leaving immediately for
hollywood, and i think we ought to leave, too. collis clay
has been here. i like him all right but have not seen much of
him because of the divers, who really are divine, about the
nicest people i ever knew. i am feeling not very well to-day
and am taking the medicine, though see no need for it. i’m
not even going to try to tell you all that’s happened until
i see you!!! so when you get this letter wire, wire,
wire! are you coming north or shall i come south with
the divers?’
at six dick called nicole.
‘have you any special plans?’ he asked.

‘control yourself, nicole!’
‘i never expected you to love me—it was too late—only
don’t come in the bathroom, the only place i can go for privacy,
dragging spreads with red blood on them and asking
me to fix them.’
‘control yourself. get up—‘
rosemary, back in the salon, heard the bathroom door
bang, and stood trembling: now she knew what violet
mckisco had seen in the bathroom at villa diana. she answered
the ringing phone and almost cried with relief when
she found it was collis clay, who had traced her to the divers’
apartment. she asked him to come up while she got her
hat, because she was afraid to go into her room alone.

in the spring of 1917, when doctor richard diver first arrived
in zurich, he was twenty-six years old, a fine age for a

that swung a casual inch below. after sleep, his face had resumed
the ruddy brown of many riviera summers, and to
limber himself up he stood on his hands on a chair until his
fountain pen and coins fell out. at three he called rosemary
and was bidden to come up. momentarily dizzy from his acrobatics,
he stopped in the bar for a gin-and-tonic.
‘hi, doctor diver!’
only because of rosemary’s presence in the hotel did
dick place the man immediately as collis clay. he had
his old confidence and an air of prosperity and big sudden
jowls.
‘do you know rosemary’s here?’ collis asked.
‘i ran into her.’
‘i was in florence and i heard she was here so i came
down last week. you’d never know mama’s little girl.’ he
modified the remark, ‘i mean she was so carefully brought
up and now she’s a woman of the world—if you know what

ed forum of an undetermined period of the
decadence. rosemary took a cocktail and a little wine, and
dick took enough so that his feeling of dissatisfaction left
him. afterward they drove back to the hotel, all flushed and
happy, in a sort of exalted quiet. she wanted to be taken and
she was, and what had begun with a childish infatuation on
a beach was accomplished at last.

rosemary had another dinner date, a birthday party for
a member of the company. dick ran into collis clay in the
lobby, but he wanted to dine alone, and pretended an engagement
at the excelsior. he drank a cocktail with collis
and his vague dissatisfaction crystallized as impatience—
he no longer had an excuse for playing truant to the clinic.
this was less an infatuation than a romantic memory. nicole
was his girl—too often he was sick at heart about her,
yet she was his girl. time with rosemary was self-indulgence—
time with collis was nothing plus nothing.

‘why not? i should think you could work there as well as

he sat back and looked at her. if she had ever suspected
the rotted old truth, the real reason for nicole’s illness, she
had certainly determined to deny it to herself, shoving it
back in a dusty closet like one of the paintings she bought
by mistake.
they continued the conversation in the ulpia, where
collis clay came over to their table and sat down, and a
gifted guitar player thrummed and rumbled ‘suona fanfara
mia’ in the cellar piled with wine casks.
‘it’s possible that i was the wrong person for nicole,’ dick
said. ‘still she would probably have married some one of
my type, some one she thought she could rely on—indefinitely.’
‘you think she’d be happier with somebody else?’ baby

he was a gruff red bird and instinctively she drew away
from him as his unjustified jealousy began to snow over the
qualities of consideration and understanding with which
she felt at home.
‘i want to know the truth,’ he said.
‘yes, then. we’re a lot together, he wants to marry me,
but i don’t want to. what of it? what do you expect me to
do? you never asked me to marry you. do you want me to
play around forever with half-wits like collis clay?’
‘you were with nicotera last night?’
‘that’s none of your business,’ she sobbed. ‘excuse me,
dick, it is your business. you and mother are the only two
people in the world i care about.’
‘how about nicotera?’
‘how do i know?’
she had achieved the elusiveness that gives hidden significance
to the least significant remarks.

there were five people in the quirinal bar after dinner, a
highclass italian frail who sat on a stool making persistent
conversation against the bartender’s bored: ‘si ... si ... si,’ a
light, snobbish egyptian who was lonely but chary of the
woman, and the two americans.
dick was always vividly conscious of his surroundings,
while collis clay lived vaguely, the sharpest impressions
dissolving upon a recording apparatus that had early atrophied,
so the former talked and the latter listened, like a
man sitting in a breeze.
dick, worn away by the events of the afternoon, was taking
it out on the inhabitants of italy. he looked around the
bar as if he hoped an italian had heard him and would resent
his words.

him to its approximate locality, where she dismounted
and explored a labyrinth of familiar alleys. but the buildings
and the alleys all looked alike. emerging from one trail
into the piazzo d’espagna she saw the american express
company and her heart lifted at the word ‘american’ on the
sign. there was a light in the window and hurrying across
the square she tried the door, but it was locked, and inside
the clock stood at seven. then she thought of collis clay.
she remembered the name of his hotel, a stuffy villa
sealed in red plush across from the excelsior. the woman
on duty at the office was not disposed to help her—she had
no authority to disturb mr. clay, and refused to let miss
warren go up to his room alone; convinced finally that this
was not an affair of passion she accompanied her.
collis lay naked upon his bed. he had come in tight and,
awakening, it took him some moments to realize his nudity.
