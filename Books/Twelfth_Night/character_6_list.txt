Sir Toby - 
                	Olivia's
uncle. Olivia lets Sir Toby Belch live with her, but she does not
approve of his rowdy behavior, practical jokes, heavy drinking,
late-night carousing, or friends (specifically the idiotic Sir Andrew).
Sir Toby also earns the ire of Malvolio. But Sir Toby has an ally, and
eventually a mate, in Olivia's sharp-witted waiting-gentlewoman,
Maria. Together they bring about the triumph of chaotic spirit,
which Sir Toby embodies, and the ruin of the controlling, self-righteous
Malvolio.
