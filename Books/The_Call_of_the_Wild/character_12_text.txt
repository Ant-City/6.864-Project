ecome because of
their insular situation. but he had saved himself by not becoming a mere
pampered house-dog. hunting and kindred outdoor delights had kept down
the fat and hardened his muscles; and to him, as to the cold-tubbing
races, the love of water had been a tonic and a health preserver.

and this was the manner of dog buck was in the fall of 1897, when the
klondike strike dragged men from all the world into the frozen north.
but buck did not read the newspapers, and he did not know that manuel,
one of the gardener’s helpers, was an undesirable acquaintance. manuel
had one besetting sin. he loved to play chinese lottery. also, in his
gambling, he had one besetting weakness--faith in a system; and this
made his damnation certain. for to play a system requires money, while
the wages of a gardener’s helper do not lap over the needs of a wife and
numerous progeny.

manuel’s treachery. no one saw him and buck go off through the orchard
on what buck imagined was merely a stroll. and with the exception of a
solitary man, no one saw them arrive at the little flag station known
as college park. this man talked with manuel, and money chinked between
them.

“you might wrap up the goods before you deliver ‘m,” the stranger said
gruffly, and manuel doubled a piece of stout rope around buck’s neck
under the collar.

“twist it, an’ you’ll choke ‘m plentee,” said manuel, and the stranger
grunted a ready affirmative.

buck had accepted the rope with quiet dignity. to be sure, it was an
unwonted performance: but he had learned to trust in men he knew, and to
give them credit for a wisdom that outreached his own. but when the ends
of the rope were placed in the stranger’s hands, he growled menacingly.

vilized dog, and of his own experience knew no trap and so
could not of himself fear it. the muscles of his whole body contracted
spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders
stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into
the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. ere he
landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew
where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went
for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night
before.

a shout from francois hailed his appearance. “wot i say?” the dog-driver
cried to perrault. “dat buck for sure learn queek as anyt’ing.”

perrault nodded gravely. as courier for the canadian government, bearing
important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was
particularly gladdened by the possession of buck.

star and howled long and wolflike, it was his ancestors, dead and dust,
pointing nose at star and howling down through the centuries and through
him. and his cadences were their cadences, the cadences which voiced
their woe and what to them was the meaning of the stiffness, and the
cold, and dark.

thus, as token of what a puppet thing life is, the ancient song surged
through him and he came into his own again; and he came because men had
found a yellow metal in the north, and because manuel was a gardener’s
helper whose wages did not lap over the needs of his wife and divers
small copies of himself.




chapter iii. the dominant primordial beast


the dominant primordial beast was strong in buck, and under the fierce
conditions of trail life it grew and grew. yet it was a secret growth.
his newborn cunning gave him poise and control. he was too busy
adjusting himself to the new life to feel at ease, and not only did
he not pick fights, but he avoided them whenever possible. a ce
