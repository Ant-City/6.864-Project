â€œwhat, no wine?â€ said dantÃ¨s, turning pale, and looking alternately at
the hollow cheeks of the old man and the empty cupboards. â€œwhat, no
wine? have you wanted money, father?â€

â€œi want nothing now that i have you,â€ said the old man.

â€œyet,â€ stammered dantÃ¨s, wiping the perspiration from his brow,--â€œyet i
gave you two hundred francs when i left, three months ago.â€

â€œyes, yes, edmond, that is true, but you forgot at that time a little
debt to our neighbor, caderousse. he reminded me of it, telling me if i
did not pay for you, he would be paid by m. morrel; and so, you see,
lest he might do you an injuryâ€--

â€œwell?â€

â€œwhy, i paid him.â€

â€œbut,â€ cried dantÃ¨s, â€œit was a hundred and forty francs i owed
caderousse.â€

â€œyes,â€ stammered the old man.

â€œand you paid him out of the two hundred francs i left you?â€

the old man nodded.

â€œso that you have lived for three months on sixty francs,â€ muttered
edmond.

â€œyou know how little i req

will use your purse moderately, for they would say, if they saw me buy
too many things at a time, that i had been obliged to await your return,
in order to be able to purchase them.â€

â€œdo as you please; but, first of all, pray have a servant, father. i
will not have you left alone so long. i have some smuggled coffee and
most capital tobacco, in a small chest in the hold, which you shall have
tomorrow. but, hush, here comes somebody.â€

â€œâ€˜tis caderousse, who has heard of your arrival, and no doubt comes to
congratulate you on your fortunate return.â€

â€œah, lips that say one thing, while the heart thinks another,â€ murmured
edmond. â€œbut, never mind, he is a neighbor who has done us a service on
a time, so heâ€™s welcome.â€

as edmond paused, the black and bearded head of caderousse appeared at
the door. he was a man of twenty-five or six, and held a piece of cloth,
which, being a tailor, he was about to make into a coat-lining.

â€œwhat,

 is it you, edmond, back again?â€ said he, with a broad
marseillaise accent, and a grin that displayed his ivory-white teeth.

â€œyes, as you see, neighbor caderousse; and ready to be agreeable to you
in any and every way,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, but ill-concealing his coldness
under this cloak of civility.

â€œthanks--thanks; but, fortunately, i do not want for anything; and it
chances that at times there are others who have need of me.â€ dantÃ¨s made
a gesture. â€œi do not allude to you, my boy. no!--no! i lent you money,
and you returned it; thatâ€™s like good neighbors, and we are quits.â€

â€œwe are never quits with those who oblige us,â€ was dantÃ¨sâ€™

t owe them money, we owe them gratitude.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s the use of mentioning that? what is done is done. let us talk of
your happy return, my boy. i had gone on the quay to match a piece of
mulberry cloth, when i met friend danglars. â€˜you at marseilles?â€™--â€˜yes,â€™
says he.

â€œâ€˜i thought you were at smyrna.â€™--â€˜i was; but am now back again.â€™

â€œâ€˜and where is the dear boy, our little edmond?â€™

â€œâ€˜why, with his father, no doubt,â€™ replied danglars. and so i came,â€
 added caderousse, â€œas fast as i could to have the pleasure of shaking
hands with a friend.â€


â€œworthy caderousse!â€ said the old man, â€œhe is so much attached to us.â€

â€œyes, to be sure i am. i love and esteem you, because honest folks are
so rare. but it seems you have come back rich, my boy,â€ continued the
tailor, looking askance at the handful of gold and silver which dantÃ¨s
had thrown on the table.

the young man remarked the greedy glance which shone in the dark eyes of
his neighbor. â€œeh,â€
 
 ___________________________
 
 he said, negligently, â€œthis money is not mine. i was
expressing to my father my fears that he had wanted many things in my
absence, and to convince me he emptied his purse on the table. come,
fatherâ€ added dantÃ¨s, â€œput this money back in your box--unless neighbor
caderousse wants anything, and in that case it is at his service.â€

â€œno, my boy, no,â€ said caderousse. â€œi am not in any want, thank god, my
living is suited to my means. keep your money--keep it, i say;--one
never has too much;--but, at the same time, my boy, i am as much obliged
by your offer as if i took advantage of it.â€

â€œit was offered with good will,â€ said dantÃ¨s.

â€œno doubt, my boy; no doubt. well, you stand well with m. morrel i
hear,--you insinuating dog, you!â€

â€œm. morrel has always been exceedingly kind to me,â€ replied dantÃ¨s.

â€œthen you were wrong to refuse to di

ne with him.â€

â€œwhat, did you refuse to dine with him?â€ said old dantÃ¨s; â€œand did he
invite you to dine?â€

â€œyes, my dear father,â€ replied edmond, smiling at his fatherâ€™s
astonishment at the excessive honor paid to his son.

â€œand why did you refuse, my son?â€ inquired the old man.

â€œthat i might the sooner see you again, my dear father,â€ replied the
young man. â€œi was most anxious to see you.â€

â€œbut it must have vexed m. morrel, good, worthy man,â€ said caderousse.
â€œand when you are looking forward to be captain, it was wrong to annoy
the owner.â€

â€œbut i explained to him the cause of my refusal,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, â€œand i
hope he fully understood it.â€

â€œyes, but to be captain one must do a little flattery to oneâ€™s patrons.â€

â€œi hope to be captain without that,â€ said dantÃ¨s.

â€œso much the better--so much the better! nothing will give greater
pleasure to all your old friends; and i know one down there behind the
saint nicolas citadel

 who will not be sorry to hear it.â€

â€œmercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€ said the old man.

â€œyes, my dear father, and with your permission, now i have seen you, and
know you are well and have all you require, i will ask your consent to
go and pay a visit to the catalans.â€

â€œgo, my dear boy,â€ said old dantÃ¨s: â€œand heaven bless you in your wife,
as it has blessed me in my son!â€

â€œhis wife!â€ said caderousse; â€œwhy, how fast you go on, father dantÃ¨s;
she is not his wife yet, as it seems to me.â€

â€œno, but according to all probability she soon will be,â€ replied edmond.

â€œyes--yes,â€ said caderousse; â€œbut you were right to return as soon as
possible, my boy.â€

â€œand why?â€

â€œbecause mercÃ©dÃ¨s is a very fine girl, and fine girls never lack
followers; she particularly has them by dozens.â€

â€œreally?â€ answered edmond, with a smile which had in it traces of slight
uneasiness.

œah, yes,â€ continued caderousse, â€œand capital offers, too; but you know,
you will be captain, and who could refuse you then?â€

â€œmeaning to say,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, with a smile which but ill-concealed
his trouble, â€œthat if i were not a captainâ€--

â€œeh--eh!â€ said caderousse, shaking his head.

â€œcome, come,â€ said the sailor, â€œi have a better opinion than you of
women in general, and of mercÃ©dÃ¨s in particular; and i am certain that,
captain or not, she will remain ever faithful to me.â€

â€œso much the better--so much the better,â€ said caderousse. â€œwhen one is
going to be married, there is nothing like implicit confidence; but
never mind that, my boy,--go and announce your arrival, and let her know
all your hopes and prospects.â€

â€œi will go directly

,â€ was edmondâ€™s reply; and, embracing his father, and
nodding to caderousse, he left the apartment.

caderousse lingered for a moment, then taking leave of old dantÃ¨s, he
went downstairs to rejoin danglars, who awaited him at the corner of the
rue senac.

â€œwell,â€ said danglars, â€œdid you see him?â€

â€œi have just left him,â€ answered caderousse.

â€œdid he allude to his hope of being captain?â€

â€œhe spoke of it as a thing already decided.â€

â€œindeed!â€ said danglars, â€œhe is in too much hurry, it appears to me.â€

â€œwhy, it seems m. morrel has promised him the thing.â€

â€œso that he is quite elated about it?â€

â€œwhy, yes, he is actually insolent over the matter--has already offered
me his patronage, as if he were a grand personage, and proffered me a
loan of money, as though he were a banker.â€

â€œwhich you refused?â€
 
 ___________________________
 


â€œmost assuredly; although i might easily have accepted it, for it was i
who put into his hands the first silver he ever earned; but now m.
dantÃ¨s has no longer any occasion for assistance--he is about to become
a captain.â€

â€œpooh!â€ said danglars, â€œhe is not one yet.â€

â€œ_ma foi!_ it will be as well if he is not,â€ answered caderousse; â€œfor
if he should be, there will be really no speaking to him.â€

â€œif we choose,â€ replied danglars, â€œhe will remain what he is; and
perhaps become even less than he is.â€

â€œwhat do you mean?â€

â€œnothing--i was speaking to myself. and is he still in love with the
catalane?â€

â€œover head and ears; but, unless i am much mistaken, there will be a
storm in that quarter.â€


â€œexplain yourself.â€

â€œwhy should i?â€

â€œit is more important than you think, perhaps. you do not l

â€œreally; and you think this cousin pays her attentions?â€

â€œi only suppose so. what else can a strapping chap of twenty-one mean
with a fine wench of seventeen?â€

â€œand you say that dantÃ¨s has gone to the catalans?â€

â€œhe went before i came down.â€

â€œlet us go the same way; we will stop at la rÃ©serve, and we can drink a
glass of la malgue, whilst we wait for news.â€

â€œcome along,â€ said caderousse; â€œbut you pay the score.â€

â€œof course,â€ replied danglars; and going quickly to the designated
place, they called for a bottle of wine, and two glasses.

pÃ¨re pamphile had seen dantÃ¨s pass not ten minutes before; and assured
that he was at the catalans, they sat down under the budding foliage of
the planes and sycamores, in the branches of which the birds were
singing their welcome to one of the first days of spring.

was broken against the strong ascendancy which mercÃ©dÃ¨s exercised over
him. scarcely, however, had he touched edmondâ€™s hand than he felt he had
done all he could do, and rushed hastily out of the house.

â€œoh,â€ he exclaimed, running furiously and tearing his hair--â€œoh, who
will deliver me from this man? wretched--wretched that i am!â€

â€œhallo, catalan! hallo, fernand! where are you running to?â€ exclaimed a
voice.

the young man stopped suddenly, looked around him, and perceived
caderousse sitting at table with danglars, under an arbor.

â€œwellâ€, said caderousse, â€œwhy donâ€™t you come? are you really in such a
hurry that you have no time to pass the time of day with your friends?â€

â€œparticularly when they have still a full bottle before them,â€ added
danglars. fernand looked at them both with a stupefied air, but did not
say a word.

â€œhe seems besotted,â€ said danglars, pushing caderousse with his knee.
â€œare we mistaken, and is dantÃ¨s triumphant in spite of all we

 have
believed?â€

â€œwhy, we must inquire into that,â€ was caderousseâ€™s reply; and turning
towards the young man, said, â€œwell, catalan, canâ€™t you make up your
mind?â€

fernand wiped away the perspiration steaming from his brow, and slowly
entered the arbor, whose shade seemed to restore somewhat of calmness to
his senses, and whose coolness somewhat of refreshment to his exhausted
body.

â€œgood-day,â€ said he. â€œyou called me, didnâ€™t you?â€ and he fell, rather
than sat down, on one of the seats which surrounded the table.

â€œi called you because you

 were running like a madman, and i was afraid
you would throw yourself into the sea,â€ said caderousse, laughing. â€œwhy,
when a man has friends, they are not only to offer him a glass of wine,
but, moreover, to prevent his swallowing three or four pints of water
unnecessarily!â€

fernand gave a groan, which resembled a sob, and dropped his head into
his hands, his elbows leaning on the table.

â€œwell, fernand, i must say,â€ said caderousse, beginning the
conversation, with that brutality of the common people in which
curiosity destroys all diplomacy, â€œyou look uncommonly like a rejected
lover;â€ and he burst into a hoarse laugh.

â€œbah!â€ said danglars, â€œa lad of his make was not born to be unhappy in
love. you are laughing at him, caderousse.â€

â€œno,â€ he replied, â€œonly hark how he sighs! come, come, fernand,â€ said
caderousse, â€œhold up your head, and answer us. itâ€™s not polite not to
reply to friends who ask n

ews of your health.â€

â€œmy health is well enough,â€ said fernand, clenching his hands without
raising his head.

â€œah, you see, danglars,â€ said caderousse, winking at his friend, â€œthis
is how it is; fernand, whom you see here, is a good and brave catalan,
one of the best fishermen in marseilles, and he is in love with a very
fine girl, named mercÃ©dÃ¨s; but it appears, unfortunately, that the fine
girl is in love with the mate of the _pharaon_; and as the _pharaon_
arrived today--why, you understand!â€

â€œno; i do not understand,â€ said danglars.

â€œpoor fernand has been dismissed,â€ continued caderousse.

â€œwell, and what then?â€ said f

ernand, lifting up his head, and looking at
caderousse like a man who looks for someone on whom to vent his anger;
â€œmercÃ©dÃ¨s is not accountable to any person, is she? is she not free to
love whomsoever she will?â€

â€œoh, if you take it in that sense,â€ said caderousse, â€œit is another
thing. but i thought you were a catalan, and they told me the catalans
were not men to allow themselves to be supplanted by a rival. it was
even told me that fernand, especially, was terrible in his vengeance.â€

fernand smiled piteously. â€œa lover is never terrible,â€ he said.

â€œpoor fellow!â€ remarked danglars, affecting to pity the young man from
the bottom of his heart. â€œwhy, you see, he did not expect to see dantÃ¨s
return so suddenly--he thought he was dead, perh

aps; or perchance
faithless! these things always come on us more severely when they come
suddenly.â€

â€œah, _ma foi_, under any circumstances,â€ said caderousse, who drank as
he spoke, and on whom the fumes of the wine began to take effect,--
â€œunder any circumstances fernand is not the only person put out by the
fortunate arrival of dantÃ¨s; is he, danglars?â€

â€œno, you are right--and i should say that would bring him ill-luck.â€

â€œwell, never mind,â€ answered caderousse, pouring out a glass of wine for
fernand, and filling his own for the eighth or ninth time, while
danglars had merely sipped his. â€œnever mind--in the meantime he marries
mercÃ©dÃ¨s--the lovely mercÃ©dÃ¨s--at least he returns to do that.â€

during this time danglars fixed his piercing glance on the young man, on
whose heart caderousseâ€™s words fell like molten lead.

â€œand when is the wedding to be?â€ he asked.

â€œoh, it is not yet fixed!â€ murmured fernand.

â€œno, but it will be,â€ sa

id caderousse, â€œas surely as dantÃ¨s will be
captain of the _pharaon_--eh, danglars?â€

danglars shuddered at this unexpected attack, and turned to caderousse,
whose countenance he scrutinized, to try and detect whether the blow was
premeditated; but he read nothing but envy in a countenance already
rendered brutal and stupid by drunkenness.

â€œwell,â€ said he, filling the glasses, â€œlet us drink to captain edmond
dantÃ¨s, husband of the beautiful catalane!â€

caderousse raised his glass to his mouth with unsteady hand, and
swallowed the contents at a gulp. fernand dashed his on the ground.

â€œeh, eh, eh!â€ stammered caderousse. â€œwhat do i see down there by the
wall, in the direction of the catalans? look, fernand, your eyes are
better than mine. i believe i see double. you know wine is a deceiver;
but i should say it was two lovers walking side by side, and hand in
hand. heaven forgive me, they do not know that we can see them, and they

danglars did not lose one pang that fernand endured.

â€œdo you know them, fernand?â€ he said.

â€œyes,â€ was the reply, in a low voice. â€œit is edmond and mercÃ©dÃ¨s!â€

â€œah, see there, now!â€ said caderousse; â€œand i did not recognize them!
hallo, dantÃ¨s! hello, lovely damsel! come this way, and let us know when
the wedding is to be, for fernand here is so obstinate he will not tell
us.â€

â€œhold your tongue, will you?â€ said danglars, pretending to restrain
caderousse, who, with the tenacity of drunkards, leaned out of the
arbor. â€œtry to stand upright, and let the lovers make love without
interruption. see, look at fernand, and follow his example; he is well-
behaved!â€


fernand, probably excited beyond bearing, pricked by danglars, as the
bull is by the bandilleros, was about to rush out; for he had risen from
his seat, and seemed to be collecting himself to dash headlong upon his
rival, when mercÃ©dÃ¨s, smiling and graceful, lifted up her lovely head,

unquestionably, edmondâ€™s star is in the ascendant, and he will marry the
splendid girl--he will be captain, too, and laugh at us all, unlessâ€--a
sinister smile passed over danglarsâ€™ lips--â€œunless i take a hand in the
affair,â€ he added.

â€œhallo!â€ continued caderousse, half-rising, and with his fist on the
table, â€œhallo, edmond! do you not see your friends, or are you too proud
to speak to them?â€

â€œno, my dear fellow!â€ replied dantÃ¨s, â€œi am not proud, but i am happy,
and happiness blinds, i think, more than pride.â€

â€œah, very well, thatâ€™s an explanation!â€ said caderousse. â€œhow do you do,
madame dantÃ¨s?â€

mercÃ©dÃ¨s courtesied gravely, and said--â€œthat is not my name, and in my
country it bodes ill fortune, they say, to call a young g

â€œwe must excuse our worthy neighbor, caderousse,â€ said dantÃ¨s, â€œhe is so
easily mistaken.â€

â€œso, then, the wedding is to take place immediately, m. dantÃ¨s,â€ said
danglars, bowing to the young couple.

â€œas soon as possible, m. danglars; today all preliminaries will be
arranged at my fatherâ€™s, and tomorrow, or next day at latest, the
wedding festival here at la rÃ©serve. my friends will be there, i hope;
that is to say, you are invited, m. danglars, and you, caderousse.â€

â€œand fernand,â€ said caderousse with a chuckle; â€œ

â€œmy wifeâ€™s brother is my brother,â€ said edmond; â€œand we, mercÃ©dÃ¨s and i,
should be very sorry if he were absent at such a time.â€

fernand opened his mouth to reply, but his voice died on his lips, and
he could not utter a word.

â€œtoday the preliminaries, tomorrow or next day the ceremony! you are in
a hurry, captain!â€

â€œdanglars,â€ said edmond, smiling, â€œi will say to you as mercÃ©dÃ¨s said
just now to caderousse, â€˜do not give me a title which does not belong to
meâ€™; that may bring me bad luck.â€

â€œyour pardon,â€ replied danglars, â€œi merely said you seemed in a hurry,
and we have lots of time; the _pharaon_ cannot be under weigh again in
less than three months.â€

â€œwe are always in a hurry to be happy, m. danglars; for when we have
suffered a long time, we have great difficulty in believing in good
fortune. but it is not selfishness alone that makes me thus in haste; i
must go to paris.â€

n turning towards edmond, who was walking away, â€œa
pleasant journey,â€ he cried.

â€œthank you,â€ said edmond with a friendly nod, and the two lovers
continued on their way, as calm and joyous as if they were the very
elect of heaven.



chapter 4. conspiracy

danglars followed edmond and mercÃ©dÃ¨s with his eyes until the two lovers
disappeared behind one of the angles of fort saint nicolas, then turning
round, he perceived fernand, who had fallen, pale and trembling, into
his chair, while caderousse stammered out the words of a drinking-song.

â€œwell, my dear sir,â€ said danglars to fernand, â€œhere is a marriage which
does not appear to make everybody happy.â€

â€œit drives me to despair,â€ said fernand.

â€œdo you, then, love mercÃ©dÃ¨s?â€

â€œi adore her!â€

â€œfor long?â€

â€œas long as i have known her--always.â€

â€œand you sit there, tearing your hair, instead of seeking to remedy your
condition; i did not think that was the way of your people.â€

â€œwhat would you have me

â€œpooh! women say those things, but never do them.â€

â€œyou do not know mercÃ©dÃ¨s; what she threatens she will do.â€

â€œidiot!â€ muttered danglars; â€œwhether she kill herself or not, what
matter, provided dantÃ¨s is not captain?â€

â€œbefore mercÃ©dÃ¨s should die,â€ replied fernand, with the accents of
unshaken resolution, â€œi would die myself!â€

â€œthatâ€™s what i call love!â€ said caderousse with a voice more tipsy than
ever. â€œthatâ€™s love, or i donâ€™t know what love is.â€

â€œcome,â€ said danglars, â€œyou appear to me a good sort of fellow, and hang
me, i should like to help you, butâ€--

â€œyes,â€ said caderousse, â€œbut how?â€

â€œmy dear fellow,â€ replied danglars, â€œyou are three parts drunk; finish

with what we are discussing, for that requires all oneâ€™s wit and cool
judgment.â€

more such bottles; they are no bigger than cologne flasks. pÃ¨re

â€œyou were saying, sirâ€--said fernand, awaiting with great anxiety the
end of this interrupted remark.

â€œwhat was i saying? i forget. this drunken caderousse has made me lose
the thread of my sentence.â€

â€œdrunk, if you like; so much the worse for those who fear wine, for it
is because they have bad thoughts which they are afraid the liquor will
extract from their hearts;â€ and caderousse began to sing the two last
lines of a song very popular at the time,--

â€œdeath alone can separate them,â€ remarked fernand.

he lay under a tombstone.â€


â€œyes; but one gets out of prison,â€ said caderousse, who, with what sense
was left him, listened eagerly to the conversation, â€œand when one gets
out and oneâ€™s name is edmond dantÃ¨s, one seeks revengeâ€--

â€œwhat matters that?â€ muttered fernand.

â€œand why, i should like to know,â€ persisted caderousse, â€œshould they put
dantÃ¨s in prison? he has not robbed or killed or murdered.â€

â€œhold your tongue!â€ said danglars.

â€œi wonâ€™t hold my tongue!â€ replied caderousse; â€œi say i want to know why
they should put dantÃ¨s in prison; i like dantÃ¨s; dantÃ¨s, your health!â€
 and he swallowed another glass of wine.


danglars saw in the muddled look of the tailor the progress of his
intoxication, and turning towards fernand, said, â€œwell, you understand
there is no need to kill him.â€

feeling or not against dantÃ¨s. i hate him! i confess it openly. do you
find the means, i will execute it, provided it is not to kill the man,
for mercÃ©dÃ¨s has declared she will kill herself if dantÃ¨s is killed.â€

caderousse, who had let his head drop on the table, now raised it, and
looking at fernand with his dull and fishy eyes, he said,--â€œkill dantÃ¨s!
who talks of killing dantÃ¨s? i wonâ€™t have him killed--i wonâ€™t! heâ€™s my
friend, and this morning offered to share his money with me, as i shared
mine with him. i wonâ€™t have dantÃ¨s killed--i wonâ€™t!â€

â€œand who has said a word about killing him, muddlehead?â€ replied
danglars. â€œwe were merely joking; drink to his health,â€ he added,
filling cade

rousseâ€™s glass, â€œand do not interfere with us.â€

â€œyes, yes, dantÃ¨sâ€™ good health!â€ said caderousse, emptying his glass,
â€œhereâ€™s to his health! his health--hurrah!â€

â€œbut the means--the means?â€ said fernand.

â€œhave you not hit upon any?â€ asked danglars.

â€œno!--you undertook to do so.â€

â€œtrue,â€ replied danglars; â€œthe french have the superiority over the
spaniards, that the spaniards ruminate, while the french invent.â€

â€œdo you invent, then,â€ said fernand impatiently.

â€œwaiter,â€ said danglars, â€œpen, ink, and paper.â€

â€œpen, ink, and paper,â€ muttered fern

and.

â€œyes; i am a supercargo; pen, ink, and paper are my tools, and without
my tools i am fit for nothing.â€

â€œpen, ink, and paper, then,â€ called fernand loudly.

â€œthereâ€™s what you want on that table,â€ said the waiter.

â€œbring them here.â€ the waiter did as he was desired.


â€œwhen one thinks,â€ said caderousse, letting his hand drop on the paper,
â€œthere is here wherewithal to kill a man more sure than if we waited at
the corner of a wood to assassinate him! i have always had more dread of
a pen, a bottle of ink, and a sheet of paper, than of a sword or
pistol.â€

â€œthe fellow is not so drunk as he appears to be,â€ said danglars. â€œgive
him some more wine, fernand.â€ fernand filled caderousseâ€™s glass, who,
like the confirmed toper he was, lifted his hand from the paper and
seized the glass.

the catalan watched him until caderousse, almost overcome by this fresh
assault on his senses, rested, or rather dropped, his glass upon the
table.

â€œwell!â€ resumed the catalan, as he saw the final glimmer of caderousseâ€™s
reason vanishing before the last glass of wine.

â€œwell, then, i should say, for instance,â€ resumed danglars, â€œthat if
after a voyage such as dantÃ¨s has just made, in which he touched at the
island of elba, someone were to denounce him to the kingâ€™s procureur as
a bonapartist agentâ€--

â€œi will denounce him!â€ exclaimed the young man hastily.

â€œyes, but they will make you then sign your declaration, and confront
you with him you have denounced; i will supply you with the means

 the
letter will be found upon him, or at his fatherâ€™s, or in his cabin on
board the _pharaon_.â€

â€œvery good,â€ resumed danglars; â€œnow your revenge looks like common
sense, for in no way can it revert to yourself, and the matter will thus
work its own way; there is nothing to do now but fold the letter as i am
doing, and write upon it, â€˜to the kingâ€™s attorney,â€™ and thatâ€™s all
settled.â€ and danglars wrote the address as he spoke.

â€œyes, and thatâ€™s all settled!â€ exclaimed caderousse, who, by a last
effort of intellect, had followed the reading of the letter, and
instinctively comprehended all the misery which such a denunciation must
entail. â€œyes, and thatâ€™s all settled; only it will be an infamous
shame;â€ and he stretched out his hand to reach the letter.

â€œyes,â€ said danglars, taking it from beyond his reach; â€œand as what i
say and do is merely in jest, and i, amongst the first and foremost,
should be sorry if anything happened to dantÃ¨s--the worthy dantÃ¨s-

it into a corner of the arbor.

â€œall right!â€ said caderousse. â€œdantÃ¨s is my friend, and i wonâ€™t have him
ill-used.â€

â€œand who thinks of using him ill? certainly neither i nor fernand,â€ said
danglars, rising and looking at the young man, who still remained
seated, but whose eye was fixed on the denunciatory sheet of paper flung
into the corner.

â€œin this case,â€ replied caderousse, â€œletâ€™s have some more wine. i wish
to drink to the health of edmond and the lovely mercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œyou have had too much already, drunkard,â€ said danglars; â€œand if you
continue, you will be compelled to sleep here, because unable to stand
on your legs.â€

â€œi?â€ said caderousse, rising with all the offended dignity of a drunken
man, â€œi canâ€™t keep on my legs? why, iâ€™ll wager i can go up into the
belfry of the accoules, and without staggering, too!â€

â€œdone!â€ said dangla

rs, â€œiâ€™ll take your bet; but tomorrow--today it is
time to return. give me your arm, and let us go.â€

â€œvery well, let us go,â€ said caderousse; â€œbut i donâ€™t want your arm at
all. come, fernand, wonâ€™t you return to marseilles with us?â€

â€œno,â€ said fernand; â€œi shall return to the catalans.â€

â€œyouâ€™re wrong. come with us to marseilles--come along.â€

â€œi will not.â€

â€œwhat do you mean? you will not? well, just as you like, my prince;
thereâ€™s liberty for all the world. come along, danglars, and let the
young gentleman return to the catalans if he chooses.â€

danglars took advantage of caderousseâ€™s temper at th

e moment, to take
him off towards marseilles by the porte saint-victor, staggering as he
went.

when they had advanced about twenty yards, danglars looked back and saw
fernand stoop, pick up the crumpled paper, and putting it into his
pocket then rush out of the arbor towards pillon.

â€œwell,â€ said caderousse, â€œwhy, what a lie he told! he said he was going
to the catalans, and he is going to the city. hallo, fernand!â€

â€œoh, you donâ€™t see straight,â€ said danglars; â€œheâ€™s gone right enough.â€

â€œwell,â€ said caderousse, â€œi should have said not--how treacherous wine
is!â€

â€œcome, come,â€ said danglars to himself, â€œnow the thing is at work and it
will effect its purpose unassisted.â€



chapter 5. the marriage feast

the morningâ€™s sun rose clear and resplendent, touching the f

ored part of the crew of the _pharaon_, and other
personal friends of the bridegroom, the whole of whom had arrayed
themselves in their choicest costumes, in order to do greater honor to
the occasion.

various rumors were afloat to the effect that the owners of the
_pharaon_ had promised to attend the nuptial feast; but all seemed
unanimous in doubting that an act of such rare and exceeding
condescension could possibly be intended.

danglars, however, who now made his appearance, accompanied by
caderousse, effectually confirmed the report, stating that he had
recently conversed with m. morrel, who had himself assured him of his
intention to dine at la rÃ©serve.

in fact, a moment later m. morrel appeared and was saluted with an
enthusiastic burst of applause from the crew of the _pharaon_, who
hailed the visit of the shipowner as a sure indication that the man
whose wedding feast he thus delighted to honor would ere long be first
in command of the ship; and as dantÃ¨s was universally beloved on

board
his vessel, the sailors put no restraint on their tumultuous joy at
finding that the opinion and choice of their superiors so exactly
coincided with their own.

with the entrance of m. morrel, danglars and caderousse were despatched
in search of the bridegroom to convey to him the intelligence of the
arrival of the important personage whose coming had created such a
lively sensation, and to beseech him to make haste.

danglars and caderousse set off upon their errand at full speed; but ere
they had gone many steps they perceived a group advancing towards them,
composed of the betrothed pair, a party of young girls in attendance on
the bride, by whose side walked dantÃ¨sâ€™ father; the whole brought up by
fernand, whose lips wore their usual sinister smile.

neither mercÃ©dÃ¨s nor edmond observed the strange expression of his
countenance; they were so happy that they were conscious only of the
sunshine and the presence of each other

.

having acquitted themselves of their errand, and exchanged a hearty
shake of the hand with edmond, danglars and caderousse took their places
beside fernand and old dantÃ¨s,--the latter of whom attracted universal
notice. the old man was attired in a suit of glistening watered silk,
trimmed with steel buttons, beautifully cut and polished. his thin but
wiry legs were arrayed in a pair of richly embroidered clocked
stockings, evidently of english manufacture, while from his three-
cornered hat depended a long streaming knot of white and blue ribbons.
thus he came along, supporting himself on a curiously carved stick,

 his
aged countenance lit up with happiness, looking for all the world like
one of the aged dandies of 1796, parading the newly opened gardens of
the tuileries and luxembourg. beside him glided caderousse, whose desire
to partake of the good things provided for the wedding-party had induced
him to become reconciled to the dantÃ¨s, father and son, although there
still lingered in his mind a faint and unperfect recollection of the
events of the preceding night; just as the brain retains on waking in
the morning the dim and misty outline of a dream.


as danglars approached the disappointed lover, he cast on him a look of
deep meaning, while fernand, as he slowly paced behind the happy pair,

fact, that are cast up by the wash of waters on the sandy beach, and
styled by the grateful fishermen â€œfruits of the sea.â€

â€œa pretty silence truly!â€ said the old father of the bridegroom, as he
carried to his lips a glass of wine of the hue and brightness of the
topaz, and which had just been placed before mercÃ©dÃ¨s herself. â€œnow,
would anybody think that this room contained a happy, merry party, who
desire nothing better than to laugh and dance the hours away?â€

â€œah,â€ sighed caderousse, â€œa man cannot always feel happy because he is
about to be married.â€

â€œthe truth is,â€ replied dantÃ¨s, â€œthat i am too happy for noisy mirth; if
that is what you meant by your observation, my worthy friend, you are
right; joy takes a strange effect at times, it seems to oppress us
almost the same as sorrow.â€

danglars looked towards fernand, whose excitable nature received and
betrayed each fresh impression.

â€œwhy, what ails you?â€ asked he of edmond. â€œdo you fear any approachin
 
 ___________________________
 
 thing that alarms me,â€ returned dantÃ¨s. â€œman does
not appear to me to be intended to enjoy felicity so unmixed; happiness
is like the enchanted palaces we read of in our childhood, where fierce,
fiery dragons defend the entrance and approach; and monsters of all
shapes and kinds, requiring to be overcome ere victory is ours. i own
that i am lost in wonder to find myself promoted to an honor of which i
feel myself unworthy--that of being the husband of mercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œnay, nay!â€ cried caderousse, smiling, â€œyou have not attained that honor
yet. mercÃ©dÃ¨s is not yet your wife. just assume the tone and manner of a
husband, and see how she will remind you that your hour is not yet
come!â€

the bride blushed, while fernand, restless and uneasy, seemed to start
at every fresh sound, and from time to time wiped away the large drops
of perspiration that gathered on his brow.

â€œwell, never mind that, neighbor caderousse; it is not worthwhile to
contradict me for such a trifle as that. â€˜

s. everybody talked at once, without waiting for a
reply and each one seemed to be contented with expressing his or her own
thoughts.

fernandâ€™s paleness appeared to have communicated itself to danglars. as
for fernand himself, he seemed to be enduring the tortures of the
damned; unable to rest, he was among the first to quit the table, and,
as though seeking to avoid the hilarious mirth that rose in such
deafening sounds, he continued, in utter silence, to pace the farther
end of the salon.

caderousse approached him just as danglars, whom fernand seemed most
anxious to avoid, had joined him in a corner of the room.

â€œupon my word,â€ said caderousse, from whose mind the friendly treatment
of dantÃ¨s, united with the effect of the excellent wine he had partaken
of, had effaced every feeling of envy or jealousy at dantÃ¨sâ€™ good
fortune,--â€œupon my word, dantÃ¨s is a downright good fellow, and when i
see him sitting there beside his pretty wife that is so soon to be. i
cannot help thinking

 it would have been a great pity to have served him
that trick you were planning yesterday.â€

â€œoh, there was no harm meant,â€ answered danglars; â€œat first i certainly
did feel somewhat uneasy as to what fernand might be tempted to do; but
when i saw how completely he had mastered his feelings, even so far as
to become one of his rivalâ€™s attendants, i knew there was no further
cause for apprehension.â€ caderousse looked full at fernand--he was
ghastly pale.

â€œcertainly,â€ continued danglars, â€œthe sacrifice was no trifling one,
when the beauty of the bride is concerned. upon my soul, that future
captain of mine is a lucky dog! gad, i only wish he would let me take
his place.â€

â€œshall we not set forth?â€ asked the sweet, silvery voice of mercÃ©dÃ¨s;
â€œtwo oâ€™clock has just struck, and you know we are expected in a quarter
of an hour.â€


â€œto be sure!--to be sure!â€ cried dantÃ¨s, eagerly q

 supplicated in terms so moving, that even the officer was
touched, and, although firm in his duty, he kindly said, â€œmy worthy
friend, let me beg of you to calm your apprehensions. your son has
probably neglected some prescribed form or attention in registering his
cargo, and it is more than probable he will be set at liberty directly
he has given the information required, whether touching the health of
his crew, or the value of his freight.â€

â€œwhat is the meaning of all this?â€ inquired caderousse, frowningly, of
danglars, who had assumed an air of utter surprise.


â€œhow can i tell you?â€ replied he; â€œi am, like yourself, utterly
bewildered at all that is going on, and cannot in the least make out
what it is about.â€ caderousse then looked around for fernand, but he had
disappeared.

the scene of the previous night now came back to his mind with startling
clearness. the painful catastrophe he had just witnessed appeared
effectually to have rent away the veil which the intoxication

tween himself and his memory.

â€œso, so,â€ said he, in a hoarse and choking voice, to danglars, â€œthis,
then, i suppose, is a part of the trick you were concerting yesterday?
all i can say is, that if it be so, â€˜tis an ill turn, and well deserves
to bring double evil on those who have projected it.â€

â€œnonsense,â€ returned danglars, â€œi tell you again i have nothing whatever
to do with it; besides, you know very well that i tore the paper to
pieces.â€

â€œno, you did not!â€ answered caderousse, â€œyou merely threw it by--i saw
it lying in a corner.â€

â€œhold your tongue, you fool!--what should you know about it?--why, you
were drunk!â€

â€œwhere is fernand?â€ inquired caderousse.

â€œhow do i know?â€ replied danglars; â€œgone, as every prudent man ought to
be, to look after his own affairs, most likely. never mind where he is,
let you and i go and see what is to be done for our poor friends.â€

during this conversation, dantÃ¨s, after having exchanged a cheerful
shake of the ha

ushed into each otherâ€™s
arms.

meanwhile fernand made his appearance, poured out for himself a glass of
water with a trembling hand; then hastily swallowing it, went to sit
down at the first vacant place, and this was, by mere chance, placed
next to the seat on which poor mercÃ©dÃ¨s had fallen half fainting, when
released from the warm and affectionate embrace of old dantÃ¨s.
instinctively fernand drew back his chair.

â€œhe is the cause of all this misery--i am quite sure of it,â€ whispered
caderousse, who had never taken his eyes off fernand, to danglars.

â€œi donâ€™t think so,â€ answered the other; â€œheâ€™s too stupid to imagine such
a scheme. i only hope the mischief will fall upon the head of whoever
wrought it.â€

â€œyou donâ€™t mention those who aided and abetted the deed,â€ said
caderousse.

â€œsurely,â€ answered danglars, â€œone cannot be held responsible for every
chance arrow shot into the air.â€

â€œyou can, indeed, when the arrow lights point downward on somebodyâ€™s
head.

.â€

â€œoh, indeed--indeed, sir, he is innocent!â€ sobbed forth mercÃ©dÃ¨s.

â€œthat i believe!â€ answered m. morrel; â€œbut still he is chargedâ€--

â€œwith what?â€ inquired the elder dantÃ¨s.

â€œwith being an agent of the bonapartist faction!â€ many of our readers
may be able to recollect how formidable such an accusation became in the
period at which our story is dated.

a despairing cry escaped the pale lips of mercÃ©dÃ¨s; the old man sank
into a chair.

â€œah, danglars!â€ whispered caderousse, â€œyou have deceived me--the trick
you spoke of last night has been played; but i cannot suffer a poor old
man or an innocent girl to die of grief through your fault. i am
determined to tell them all about it.â€

â€œbe silent, you simpleton!â€ cried danglars, grasping him by the arm, â€œor
i will not answer even for your own safety. who can tell whether dantÃ¨s
be innocent or guilty? the vessel did touch at elba, where he quitted
it, and passed a whole day in the island. now, should any lett

ers or
other documents of a compromising character be found upon him, will it
not be taken for granted that all who uphold him are his accomplices?â€

with the rapid instinct of selfishness, caderousse readily perceived the
solidity of this mode of reasoning; he gazed, doubtfully, wistfully, on
danglars, and then caution supplanted generosity.

â€œsuppose we wait a while, and see what comes of it,â€ said he, casting a
bewildered look on his companion.

â€œto be sure!â€ answered danglars. â€œlet us wait, by all means. if he be
innocent, of course he will be set at liberty; if guilty, why, it is no
use involving ourselves in a conspiracy.â€

â€œlet us go, then. i cannot stay here any longer.

the rumor of edmondâ€™s arrest as a bonapartist agent was not slow in
circulating throughout the city.

â€œcould you ever have credited such a thing, my dear danglars?â€ asked m.
morrel, as, on his return to the port for the purpose of gleaning fresh
tidings of dantÃ¨s, from m. de villefort, the assistant procureur, he
overtook his supercargo and caderousse. â€œcould you have believed such a
thing possible?â€

â€œwhy, you know i told you,â€ replied danglars, â€œthat i considered the
circumstance of his having anchored at the island of elba as a very
suspicious circumstance.â€

â€œand did you mention these suspicions to any person beside myself?â€


â€œcertainly not!â€ returned danglars. then added in a low whisper, â€œyou
understand that, on account of your uncle, m. policar morrel, who served
under the _other_ government, and who does not al

of you, and if he should have any reluctance to continue you in your
post, for somehow i have perceived a sort of coolness between you.â€

â€œand what was his reply?â€

â€œthat he certainly did think he had given you offence in an affair which
he merely referred to without entering into particulars, but that
whoever possessed the good opinion and confidence of the shipâ€™s owner
would have his preference also.â€

â€œthe hypocrite!â€ murmured danglars.

â€œpoor dantÃ¨s!â€ said caderousse. â€œno one can deny his being a noble-
hearted young fellow.â€

â€œbut meanwhile,â€ continued m. morrel, â€œhere is the _pharaon_ without a
captain.â€

â€œoh,â€ replied danglars, â€œsince we cannot leave this port for the next
three months, let us hope that ere the expiration of that period dantÃ¨s
will be set at liberty.â€

â€œno doubt; but in the meantime?â€

â€œi am entirely at your service, m. morrel,â€ answered danglars. â€œyou know
that i am as capable of managing a ship as the mos

 spite of that, and of his being kingâ€™s attorney, he is
a man like ourselves, and i fancy not a bad sort of one.â€

â€œperhaps not,â€ replied danglars; â€œbut i hear that he is ambitious, and
thatâ€™s rather against him.â€

â€œwell, well,â€ returned m. morrel, â€œwe shall see. but now hasten on
board, i will join you there ere long.â€ so saying, the worthy shipowner
quitted the two allies, and proceeded in the direction of the palais de
justice.


â€œyou see,â€ said danglars, addressing caderousse, â€œthe turn things have
taken. do you still feel any desire to stand up in his defence?â€

â€œnot the slightest, but yet it seems to me a shocking thing that a mere
joke should lead to such consequences.â€

â€œbut who perpetrated that joke, let me ask? neither you nor myself, but
fernand; you knew very well that i threw the paper into a corner of the
room--indeed, i fancied i had destroyed it.â€

â€œoh, no,â€ replied caderousse, â€œthat i can answer for, you did not. i
only wish i could se

fernand picked it up, and
either copied it or caused it to be copied; perhaps, even, he did not
take the trouble of recopying it. and now i think of it, by heavens, he
may have sent the letter itself! fortunately, for me, the handwriting
was disguised.â€

â€œthen you were aware of dantÃ¨s being engaged in a conspiracy?â€

â€œnot i. as i before said, i thought the whole thing was a joke, nothing
more. it seems, however, that i have unconsciously stumbled upon the
truth.â€

â€œstill,â€ argued caderousse, â€œi would give a great deal if nothing of the
kind had happened; or, at least, that i had had no hand in it. you will
see, danglars, that it will turn out an unlucky job for both of us.â€

â€œnonsense! if any harm come of it, it should fall on the guilty person;
and that, you know, is fernand. how can we be implicated in any way? all
we have got to do is, to keep our own counsel, and remain perfectly
quiet, not breathing a word to any living soul; and you will see that
the storm will pass aw

ay without in the least affecting us.â€

â€œamen!â€ responded caderousse, waving his hand in token of adieu to
danglars, and bending his steps towards the allÃ©es de meillan, moving
his head to and fro, and muttering as he went, after the manner of one
whose mind was overcharged with one absorbing idea.

â€œso far, then,â€ said danglars, mentally, â€œall has gone as i would have
it. i am, temporarily, commander of the _pharaon_, with the certainty of
being permanently so, if that fool of a caderousse can be persuaded to
hold his tongue. my only fear is the chance of dantÃ¨s being released.
but, there, he is in the hands of justice; and,â€ added he with a smile,
â€œshe will take her own.â€ so saying, he leaped into a boat, desiring to
be rowed on board the _pharaon_, where m. morrel had agreed to meet him.

had not readily given up the fight. he had learned that dantÃ¨s
had been taken to prison, and he had gone to all his friends, and the
influential persons of the city; but the report was already in
circulation that dantÃ¨s was arrested as a bonapartist agent; and as the
most sanguine looked upon any attempt of napoleon to remount the throne
as impossible, he met with nothing but refusal, and had returned home in
despair, declaring that the matter was serious and that nothing more
could be done.

caderousse was equally restless and uneasy, but instead of seeking, like
m. morrel, to aid dantÃ¨s, he had shut himself up with two bottles of
black currant brandy, in the hope of drowning reflection. but he did not
succeed, and became too intoxicated to fetch any more drink, and yet not
so intoxicated as to forget what had happened. with his elbows on the
table he sat between the two empty bottles, while spectres danced in the
light of the unsnuffed candle--spectres such as hoffmann strews over his

seemed so barren, and the sea that had never seemed so vast. bathed in
tears she wandered about the catalan village. sometimes she stood mute
and motionless as a statue, looking towards marseilles, at other times
gazing on the sea, and debating as to whether it were not better to cast
herself into the abyss of the ocean, and thus end her woes. it was not
want of courage that prevented her putting this resolution into
execution; but her religious feelings came to her aid and saved her.

caderousse was, like fernand, enrolled in the army, but, being married
and eight years older, he was merely sent to the frontier. old dantÃ¨s,
who was only sustained by hope, lost all hope at napoleonâ€™s downfall.
five months after he had been separated from his son, and almost at the
hour of his arrest, he breathed his last in mercÃ©dÃ¨sâ€™ arms. m. morrel
paid the expenses of his funeral, and a few small debts the poor old man
had contracted.

â€œto have seen them both sitting at table together under an arbor at pÃ¨re

earnest conversation. danglars was joking in a friendly way, but fernand
looked pale and agitated.â€

â€œwere they alone?â€

â€œthere was a third person with them whom i knew perfectly well, and who
had, in all probability made their acquaintance; he was a tailor named
caderousse, but he was very drunk. stay!--stay!--how strange that it
should not have occurred to me before! now i remember quite well, that
on the table round which they were sitting were pens, ink, and paper.
oh, the heartless, treacherous scoundrels!â€ exclaimed dantÃ¨s, pressing
his hand to his throbbing brows.

â€œis there anything else i can assist you in discovering, besides the
villany of your friends?â€ inquired the abbÃ© with a laugh.

â€œyes, yes,â€ replied dantÃ¨s eagerly; â€œi would beg of

kindly refrained from questioning him as to its cause, while, with
instinctive delicacy, they left him to indulge his sorrow alone.


when he withdrew from the scene of his painful recollections, they both
accompanied him downstairs, reiterating their hope that he would come
again whenever he pleased, and assuring him that their poor dwelling
would ever be open to him. as edmond passed the door on the fourth
floor, he paused to inquire whether caderousse the tailor still dwelt
there; but he received, for reply, that the person in question had got
into difficulties, and at the present time kept a small inn on the route

his naturally dark complexion had assumed a still further shade of brown
from the habit the unfortunate man had acquired of stationing himself
from morning till eve at the threshold of his door, on the lookout for
guests who seldom came, yet there he stood, day after day, exposed to
the meridional rays of a burning sun, with no other protection for his
head than a red handkerchief twisted around it, after the manner of the
spanish muleteers. this man was our old acquaintance, gaspard
caderousse.

his wife, on the contrary, whose maiden name had been madeleine radelle,
was pale, meagre, and sickly-looking. born in the neighborhood of arles,
she had shared in the beauty for which its women are proverbial; but
that beauty had gradually withered beneath the devastating influence of
the slow fever so prevalent among dwellers by the ponds of aiguemortes
and the marshes of camargue. she remained nearly always in her second-
floor chamber, shivering in her chair, or stretched languid and feeb

against fate; to all of which her husband would calmly return an
unvarying reply, in these philosophic words:--

â€œhush, la carconte. it is godâ€™s pleasure that things should be so.â€

the sobriquet of la carconte had been bestowed on madeleine radelle from
the fact that she had been born in a village, so called, situated
between salon and lambesc; and as a custom existed among the inhabitants
of that part of france where caderousse lived of styling every person by
some particular and distinctive appellation, her husband had bestowed on
her the name of la carconte in place of her sweet and euphonious name of
madeleine, which, in all probability, his rude gutteral language would
not have enabled him to pronounce. still, let it not be supposed that
amid this affected resignation to the will of providence, the
unfortunate innkeeper did not writhe under the double misery of seeing
the hateful canal carry off his customers and

upon grand occasions by the inhabitants of the
south of france, bearing equal resemblance to the style adopted both by
the catalans and andalusians; while la carconte displayed the charming
fashion prevalent among the women of arles, a mode of attire borrowed
equally from greece and arabia. but, by degrees, watch-chains,
necklaces, parti-colored scarves, embroidered bodices, velvet vests,
elegantly worked stockings, striped gaiters, and silver buckles for the
shoes, all disappeared; and gaspard caderousse, unable to appear abroad
in his pristine splendor, had given up any further participation in the
pomps and vanities, both for himself and wife, although a bitter feeling
of envious discontent filled his mind as the sound of mirth and merry
music from the joyous revellers reached even the miserable hostelry to
which he still clung, more for the shelter than the profit it afforded.

caderousse, then, was, as usual, at his place of observation before the
door, his eyes glancing listlessly from a p

to turn up some grain or insect suited to their palate--to the deserted
road, which led away to the north and south, when he was aroused by the
shrill voice of his wife, and grumbling to himself as he went, he
mounted to her chamber, first taking care, however, to set the entrance
door wide open, as an invitation to any chance traveller who might be
passing.

at the moment caderousse quitted his sentry-like watch before the door,
the road on which he so eagerly strained his sight was void and lonely
as a desert at midday. there it lay stretching out into one interminable
line of dust and sand, with its sides bordered by tall, meagre trees,
altogether presenting so uninviting an appearance, that no one in his
senses could have imagined that any traveller, at liberty to regulate
his hours for journeying, would choose to expose himself in such a
formidable sahara. nevertheless

, had caderousse but retained his post a
few minutes longer, he might have caught a dim outline of something
approaching from the direction of bellegarde; as the moving object drew
nearer, he would easily have perceived that it consisted of a man and
horse, between whom the kindest and most amiable understanding appeared
to exist. the horse was of hungarian breed, and ambled along at an easy
pace. his rider was a priest, dressed in black, and wearing a three-
cornered hat; and, spite of the ardent rays of a noo

ge black dog came
rushing to meet the daring assailant of his ordinarily tranquil abode,
snarling and displaying his sharp white teeth with a determined
hostility that abundantly proved how little he was accustomed to
society. at that moment a heavy footstep was heard descending the wooden
staircase that led from the upper floor, and, with many bows and
courteous smiles, the host of the pont du gard besought his guest to
enter.


â€œyou are welcome, sir, most welcome!â€ repeated the astonished
caderousse. â€œnow, then, margotin,â€ cried he, speaking to the dog, â€œwill
you be quiet? pray donâ€™t heed him, sir!--he only barks, he never bites.
i make no doubt a glass of good wine would be acceptable this dreadfully
hot day.â€ then perceiving for the first time the garb of the traveller
he had to entertain, caderousse hastily exclaimed: â€œa thousand pardons!
i really did not observe whom i had the honor to receive under my poor
roof. what would the abbÃ© please to have? what refreshment can i o

have is at his service.â€

the priest gazed on the person addressing him with a long and searching
gaze--there even seemed a disposition on his part to court a similar
scrutiny on the part of the innkeeper; then, observing in the
countenance of the latter no other expression than extreme surprise at
his own want of attention to an inquiry so courteously worded, he deemed
it as well to terminate this dumb show, and therefore said, speaking
with a strong italian accent, â€œyou are, i presume, m. caderousse?â€

â€œyes, sir,â€ answered the host, even more surprised at the question than
he had been by the silence which had preceded it; â€œi am gaspard
caderousse, at your service.â€

â€œgaspard caderousse,â€ rejoined the priest. â€œyes,--christian and surname
are the same. you formerly lived, i believe in the allÃ©es de meillan, on
the fourth floor?â€


â€œi did.â€

â€œand you followed the business of a tailor?â€

â€œtrue, i was a tailor, till the trade fell off. it is so hot at

nothing i can offer you by way of refreshment?â€

â€œyes; let me have a bottle of your best wine, and then, with your
permission, we will resume our conversation from where we left off.â€

â€œas you please, sir,â€ said caderousse, who, anxious not to lose the
present opportunity of finding a customer for one of the few bottles of
cahors still remaining in his possession, hastily raised a trap-door in
the floor of the apartment they were in, which served both as parlor and
kitchen. upon issuing forth from his subterranean retreat at the
expiration of five minutes, he found the abbÃ© seated upon a wooden
stool, leaning his elbow on a table, while margotin, whose animosity
seemed appeased by the unusual command of the trav

refreshments, had crept up to him, and had established himself very
comfortably between his knees, his long, skinny neck resting on his lap,
while his dim eye was fixed earnestly on the travellerâ€™s face.

â€œare you quite alone?â€ inquired the guest, as caderousse placed before
him the bottle of wine and a glass.

â€œquite, quite alone,â€ replied the man--â€œor, at least, practically so,
for my poor wife, who is the only person in the house besides myself, is
laid up with illness, and unable to render me the least assistance, poor
thing!â€

â€œyou are married, then?â€ said the priest, with a show of interest,
glancing round as he spoke at the scanty furnishings of the apartment.

innkeeper, fairly sustaining the scrutiny of the abbÃ©â€™s gaze; â€œi can
boast with truth of being an honest man; and,â€ continued he
significantly, with a hand on his breast and shaking his head, â€œthat is
more than everyone can say nowadays.â€

â€œso much the better for you, if what you assert be true,â€ said the abbÃ©;
â€œfor i am firmly persuaded that, sooner or later, the good will be
rewarded, and the wicked punished.â€


â€œsuch words as those belong to your profession,â€ answered caderousse,
â€œand you do well to repeat them; but,â€ added he, with a bitter
expression of countenance, â€œone is free to believe them or not, as one
pleases.â€

â€œyou are wrong to speak thus,â€ said the abbÃ©; â€œand perhaps i may, in my
own person, be able to prove to you how completely you are in error.â€

â€œwhat mean you?â€ inquired caderousse with a look of surprise.

â€œin the first place, i must be satisfied that you are the person i am in
search of.â€

â€œwhat proofs do you require?â€

€œdid you, in the year 1814 or 1815, know anything of a young sailor
named dantÃ¨s?â€

â€œdantÃ¨s? did i know poor dear edmond? why, edmond dantÃ¨s and myself were
intimate friends!â€ exclaimed caderousse, whose countenance flushed
darkly as he caught the penetrating gaze of the abbÃ© fixed on him, while
the clear, calm eye of the questioner seemed to dilate with feverish
scrutiny.

â€œyou remind me,â€ said the priest, â€œthat the young man concerning whom i
asked you was said to bear the name of edmond.â€

â€œsaid to bear the name!â€ repeated caderousse, becoming excited and
eager. â€œwhy, he was so called as truly as i myself bore the appellation
of gaspard caderousse; but tell me, i pray,

what has become of poor
edmond? did you know him? is he alive and at liberty? is he prosperous
and happy?â€

â€œhe died a more wretched, hopeless, heart-broken prisoner than the
felons who pay the penalty of their crimes at the galleys of toulon.â€

a deadly pallor followed the flush on the countenance of caderousse, who
turned away, and the priest saw him wiping the tears from his eyes with
the corner of the red handkerchief twisted round his head.

â€œpoor fellow, poor fellow!â€ murmured caderousse. â€œwell, there, sir, is
another proof that good people are never rewarded on this earth, and
that none but the wicked prosper. ah,â€ continued caderousse, speaking in
the highly colored language of the south, â€œthe world grows worse and
worse. why does not god, if he really hates the wicked, as he is said to
do, send down brimstone and fire, and consume them altogether?â€

â€œyou speak as though you had loved this young dantÃ¨s,â€ observed the
abbÃ©, without taking any notice of his compan

ionâ€™s vehemence.

â€œand so i did,â€ replied caderousse; â€œthough once, i confess, i envied
him his good fortune. but i swear to you, sir, i swear to you, by
everything a man holds dear, i have, since then, deeply and sincerely
lamented his unhappy fate.â€ there was a brief silence, during which the
fixed, searching eye of the abbÃ© was employed in scrutinizing the
agitated features of the innkeeper.

â€œyou knew the poor lad, then?â€ continued caderousse.

â€œi was called to see him on his dying bed, that i might administer to
him the consolations of religion.â€

â€œand of what did he die?â€ asked caderousse in a choking voice.

â€œof what, think you, do young and strong men die in prison, when they
have scarcely numbered their thirtieth year, unless it be of
imprisonment?â€ caderousse wiped away the large beads of perspiration
that gathered on his brow.

â€œbut the strangest part of the story is,â€ resumed the abbÃ©, â€œthat
dantÃ¨s, even

in his dying moments, swore by his crucified redeemer, that
he was utterly ignorant of the cause of his detention.â€


â€œand so he was,â€ murmured caderousse. â€œhow should he have been
otherwise? ah, sir, the poor fellow told you the truth.â€

â€œand for that reason, he besought me to try and clear up a mystery he
had never been able to penetrate, and to clear his memory should any
foul spot or stain have fallen on it.â€

and here the look of the abbÃ©, becoming more and more fixed, seemed to
rest with ill-concealed satisfaction on the gloomy depression which was
rapidly spreading over the countenance of caderousse.

â€œa rich englishman,â€ cont

gratitude for the kindness and brotherly care with which dantÃ¨s had
nursed him in a severe illness he underwent during his confinement.
instead of employing this diamond in attempting to bribe his jailers,
who might only have taken it and then betrayed him to the governor,
dantÃ¨s carefully preserved it, that in the event of his getting out of
prison he might have wherewithal to live, for the sale of such a diamond
would have quite sufficed to make his fortune.â€

â€œthen, i suppose,â€ asked caderousse, with eager, glowing looks, â€œthat it
was a stone of immense value?â€

â€œwhy, everything is relative,â€ answered the abbÃ©. â€œto one in edmondâ€™s
position the diamond certainly was of great value. it was estimated at
fifty thousand francs.â€

â€œbless me!â€ exclaimed caderousse, â€œfifty thousand francs! surely the
diamond was as large as a nut to be worth all that.â€

â€œno,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œit was not of such a size as that; but you
shall judge for yourself. i have it with me

the sharp gaze of caderousse was instantly directed towards the priestâ€™s
garments, as though hoping to discover the location of the treasure.
calmly drawing forth from his pocket a small box covered with black
shagreen, the abbÃ© opened it, and displayed to the dazzled eyes of
caderousse the sparkling jewel it contained, set in a ring of admirable
workmanship. â€œand that diamond,â€ cried caderousse, almost breathless
with eager admiration, â€œyou say, is worth fifty thousand francs?â€

â€œit is, without the setting, which is also valuable,â€ replied the abbÃ©,
as he closed the box, and returned it to his pocket, while its brilliant
hues seemed still to dance before the eyes of the fascinated innkeeper.

â€œbut how comes the diamond in your possession, sir? did edmond make you
his heir?â€

â€œno, merely his testamentary executor. â€˜i once possessed four dear and

shivered.

the emotion of caderousse, â€œâ€˜is called danglars; and the third, in spite
of being my rival, entertained a very sincere affection for me.â€™â€ a
fiendish smile played over the features of caderousse, who was about to
break in upon the abbÃ©â€™s speech, when the latter, waving his hand, said,
â€œallow me to finish first, and then if you have any observations to
make, you can do so afterwards. â€˜the third of my friends, although my
rival, was much attached to me,--his name was fernand; that of my
betrothed wasâ€™--stay, stay,â€ continued the abbÃ©, â€œi have forgotten what

cÃ©dÃ¨s it was.â€

â€œgo on,â€ urged caderousse.

â€œbring me a _carafe_ of water,â€ said the abbÃ©.

caderousse quickly performed the strangerâ€™s bidding; and after pouring
some into a glass, and slowly swallowing its contents, the abbÃ©,
resuming his usual placidity of manner, said, as he placed his empty
glass on the table,--â€œwhere did we leave off?â€

â€œthe name of edmondâ€™s betrothed was mercÃ©dÃ¨s.â€

â€œto be sure. â€˜you will go to marseilles,â€™ said dantÃ¨s,--for you

â€œbut why into five parts?â€ asked caderousse; â€œyou only mentioned four
persons.â€

â€œbecause the fifth is dead, as i hear. the fifth sharer in edmondâ€™s
bequest, was his own father.â€

â€œtoo true, too true!â€ ejaculated caderousse, almost suffocated by the
contending passions which assailed him, â€œthe poor old man did die.â€

â€œi learned so much at marseilles,â€ replied the abbÃ©, making a strong
effort to appear indifferent; â€œbut from the length of time that has
elapsed since the death of the elder dantÃ¨s, i was unable to obtain any
particulars of his end. can you enlighten me on that point?â€

â€œi do not know who could if i could not,â€ said caderousse. â€œwhy, i lived

acquaintances say he died of grief; but i, who saw him in his dying
moments, i say he died of----â€

caderousse paused.

â€œof what?â€ asked the priest, anxiously and eagerly.

â€œwhy, of downright starvation.â€

â€œstarvation!â€ exclaimed the abbÃ©, springing from his seat. â€œwhy, the
vilest animals are not suffered to die by such a death as that. the very
dogs that wander houseless and homeless in the streets find some pitying
hand to cast them a mouthful of bread; and that a man, a christian,
should be allowed to perish of hunger in the midst of other men who call
themselves christians, is too hor

â€œand you are a fool for having said anything about it,â€ said a voice
from the top of the stairs. â€œwhy should you meddle with what does not
concern you?â€

the two men turned quickly, and saw the sickly countenance of la
carconte peering between the baluster rails; attracted by the sound of
voices, she had feebly dragged herself down the stairs, and, seated on
the lower step, head on knees, she had listened to the foregoing
conversation. â€œmind your own business, wife,â€ replied cader

esume the conversation, but remaining so as to be able to
hear every word they uttered. again the abbÃ© had been obliged to swallow
a draught of water to calm the emotions that threatened to overpower
him. when he had sufficiently recovered himself, he said, â€œit appears,
then, that the miserable old man you were telling me of was forsaken by
everyone. surely, had not such been the case, he would not have perished
by so dreadful a death.â€

â€œwhy, he was not altogether forsaken,â€ continued caderousse, â€œfor
mercÃ©dÃ¨s the catalan and monsieur morrel were very kind to him; but
somehow the poor old man had contracted a profound hatred for fernand--
the very person,â€ added caderousse with a bitter smile, â€œthat you named
just now as being one of dantÃ¨sâ€™ faithful and attached friends.â€

â€œand was he not so?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œgaspard, gaspard!â€ murmured the woman, from her seat on the stairs,
â€œmind what you are saying!â€ caderousse made no reply to these words,

tly irritated and annoyed by the interruption, but,
addressing the abbÃ©, said, â€œcan a man be faithful to another whose wife
he covets and desires for himself? but dantÃ¨s was so honorable and true
in his own nature, that he believed everybodyâ€™s professions of
friendship. poor edmond, he was cruelly deceived; but it was fortunate
that he never knew, or he might have found it more difficult, when on
his deathbed, to pardon his enemies. and, whatever people may say,â€
 continued caderousse, in his native language, which was not altogether
devoid of rude poetry, â€œi cannot help being more frightened at the idea
of the malediction of the dead than the hatred of the living.â€

â€œimbecile!â€ exclaimed la carconte.

â€œdo you, then, know in what manner fernand injured dantÃ¨s?â€ inquired the
abbÃ© of caderousse.

â€œdo i? no one better.â€

â€œspeak out then, say what it was!â€

â€œgaspard!â€ cried la carconte, â€œdo as you will; you are master--but if

â€œwell, wife,â€ replied caderousse, â€œi donâ€™t know but what youâ€™re right!â€

â€œso you will say nothing?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œwhy, what good would it do?â€ asked caderousse. â€œif the poor lad were
living, and came to me and begged that i would candidly tell which were
his true and which his false friends, why, perhaps, i should not
hesitate. but you tell me he is no more, and therefore can have nothing
to do with hatred or revenge, so let all such feeling be buried with
him.â€

â€œyou prefer, then,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œthat i should bestow on men you say
are false and treacherous, the reward intended for faithful friendship?â€

â€œthat is true enough,â€ retur

ned caderousse. â€œyou say truly, the gift of
poor edmond was not meant for such traitors as fernand and danglars;
besides, what would it be to them? no more than a drop of water in the
ocean.â€

â€œremember,â€ chimed in la carconte, â€œthose two could crush you at a
single blow!â€

â€œhow so?â€ inquired the abbÃ©. â€œare these persons, then, so rich and
powerful?â€

â€œdo you not know their history?â€

â€œi do not. pray relate it to me!â€

caderousse seemed to reflect for a few moments, then said, â€œno, truly,
it would take up too much time.â€

â€œwell, my good friend,â€ returned the abbÃ©, in a tone that indicated
utter indifference on his part, â€œyou are at liberty, either to speak or
be silent, just as you please; for my own part, i respect your scruples
and admire your sentiments; so let the matter end. i shall do my duty as
conscientiously as i can, and fulfil my promise to the dying man. my

again drew the small box from his pocket, opened it, and contrived to
hold it in such a light, that a bright flash of brilliant hues passed
before the dazzled gaze of caderousse.

â€œwife, wife!â€ cried he in a hoarse voice, â€œcome here!â€

â€œdiamond!â€ exclaimed la carconte, rising and descending to the chamber
with a tolerably firm step; â€œwhat diamond are you talking about?â€

â€œwhy, did you not hear all we said?â€ inquired caderousse. â€œit is a
beautiful diamond left by poor edmond dantÃ¨s, to be sold, and the money
divided between his father, mercÃ©dÃ¨s, his betrothed bride, fernand,
danglars, and myself. the jewel is worth at least fifty thousand
francs.â€

â€œoh, what a magnificent jewel!â€ cried the astonished woman.

â€œthe fifth part of the profits from this stone belongs to us then, does
it not?â€ asked caderousse.

â€œit does,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œwith the addition of an equal division of
that part intended

â€œand why among us four?â€ inquired caderousse.

â€œas being the friends edmond esteemed most faithful and devoted to him.â€

â€œi donâ€™t call those friends who betray and ruin you,â€ murmured the wife
in her turn, in a low, muttering voice.

â€œof course not!â€ rejoined caderousse quickly; â€œno more do i, and that
was what i was observing to this gentleman just now. i said i looked
upon it as a sacrilegious profanation to reward treachery, perhaps
crime.â€

â€œremember,â€ answered the abbÃ© calmly, as he replaced the jewel and its
case in the pocket of his cassock, â€œit is your fault, not mine, that i
do so. you will have the goodness to furnish me with the address of both
fernand and danglars, in order that i may execute edmondâ€™s last wishes.â€

his seat and go towards the door, as though to ascertain if his horse
were sufficiently refreshed to continue his journey, caderousse and his
wife exchanged looks of deep meaning.

â€œthere, you see, wife,â€ said the former, â€œthis splendid diamond might
all be ours, if we chose!â€

â€œdo you believe it?â€

â€œwhy, surely a man of his holy profession would not deceive us!â€

â€œwell,â€ replied la carconte, â€œdo as you like. for my part, i wash my
hands of the affair.â€ so saying, she once more climbed the staircase
leading to her chamber, her body convulsed with chills, and her teeth
rattling in her head, in spite of

ked the abbÃ©, as he returned to the apartment below, â€œwhat
have you made up your mind to do?â€

â€œto tell you all i know,â€ was the reply.

â€œi certainly think you act wisely in so doing,â€ said the priest. â€œnot
because i have the least desire to learn anything you may please to
conceal from me, but simply that if, through your assistance, i could
distribute the legacy according to the wishes of the testator, why, so
much the better, that is all.â€

â€œi hope it may be so,â€ replied caderousse, his face flushed with
cupidity.

â€œi am all attention,â€ said the abbÃ©.

â€œstop a minute,â€ answered caderousse; â€œwe might be interrupted in the
most interesting part of my story, which would be a pity; and it is as
well that your visit hither should be made known only to ourselves.â€
 with these words he went stealthily to the door, which he closed, and,
by way of still greater precaution, bolted and barred it, as he was
accustomed to do at night. during this time the abbÃ© had chosen

 his
place for listening at his ease. he removed his seat into a corner of
the room, where he himself would be in deep shadow, while the light
would be fully thrown on the narrator; then, with head bent down and
hands clasped, or rather clenched together, he prepared to give his
whole attention to caderousse, who seated himself on the little stool,
exactly opposite to him.

â€œremember, this is no affair of mine,â€ said the trembling voice of la
carconte, as though through the flooring of her chamber she viewed the
scene that was enacting below.

â€œenough, enough!â€ replied caderousse; â€œsay no more about it; i will take
all the consequences upon myself.â€ and he began his story.

out, in a fitting manner, the last wishes of our friend. speak, then,
without reserve, as without hatred; tell the truth, the whole truth; i

besides, i am an italian, and not a frenchman, and belong to god, and
not to man, and i shall shortly retire to my convent, which i have only
quitted to fulfil the last wishes of a dying man.â€ this positive
assurance seemed to give caderousse a little courage.

â€œwell, then, under these circumstances,â€ said caderousse, â€œi will, i
even believe i ought to undeceive you as to the friendship which poor
edmond thought so sincere and unquestionable.â€

â€œbegin with his father, if you please.â€ said the abbÃ©; â€œedmond talked to
me a great deal about the old man for whom he had the deepest love.â€

â€œthe history is a sad one, sir,â€ said caderousse, shaking his head;
â€œperhaps you know all the earlier part of it?â€

â€œyes.â€

he will come and see me the first thing, and what would he think if i

anxious that mercÃ©dÃ¨s should persuade the old man to accompany her, for
his footsteps over my head night and day did not leave me a momentâ€™s
repose.â€

â€œbut did you not go upstairs and try to console the poor old man?â€ asked
the abbÃ©.

â€œah, sir,â€ replied caderousse, â€œwe cannot console those who will not be
consoled, and he was one of these; besides, i know not why, but he
seemed to dislike seeing me. one night, however, i heard his sobs, and i
could not resist my desire to go up to him, but when i reached his door
he was no longer weeping but praying. i cannot now repeat to you, sir,
all the eloquent words and imploring language he made use of; it was
more than piety, it was more than grief, and i, who am no canter, and

m. morrel bringing a doctor, and the doctor said it was inflammation of
the bowels, and ordered him a limited diet. i was there, too, and i
never shall forget the old manâ€™s smile at this prescription. from that
time he received all who came; he had an excuse for not eating any more;
the doctor had put him on a diet.â€ the abbÃ© uttered a kind of groan.
â€œthe story interests you, does it not, sir?â€ inquired caderousse.

â€œyes,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œit is very affecting.â€

â€œmercÃ©dÃ¨s came again, and she found him so altered that she was even
more anxious than before to have him taken to her own home. this was m.
morrelâ€™s wish also, who would fain have conveyed the old man against his
consent; but the old man resisted, and cried so that they were actually
frightened. mercÃ©dÃ¨s remained, therefore, by his bedside, and m. morrel
went away, making a sign to the catalan that he had left his purse on

man would not take any sustenance; at length (after nine days of despair
and fasting), the old man died, cursing those who had caused his misery,
and saying to mercÃ©dÃ¨s, â€˜if you ever see my edmond again, tell him i die
blessing him.â€™â€ the abbÃ© rose from his chair, made two turns round the
chamber, and pressed his trembling hand against his parched throat. â€œand
you believe he died----â€

â€œof hunger, sir, of hunger,â€ said caderousse. â€œi am as certain of it as
that we two are christians.â€

the abbÃ©, with a shaking hand, seized a glass of water that was standing
by him half-full, swallowed it at one gulp, and then resumed his seat,
with red eyes and pale cheeks. â€œthis was, indeed, a horrid event.â€ said
he in a hoarse voice.

â€œthe more so, sir, as it was menâ€™s and not godâ€™s doing.â€

â€œtell me of those men,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œand remember too,â€ he added in
an almost menacing tone, â€œyou have promised to

â€œthey denounced edmond as a bonapartist agent.â€

â€œwhich of the two denounced him? which was the real delinquent?â€

â€œboth, sir; one with a letter, and the other put it in the post.â€

â€œand where was this letter written?â€

â€œat la rÃ©serve, the day before the betrothal feast.â€

â€œâ€˜twas so, then--â€˜twas so, then,â€ murmured the abbÃ©. â€œoh, faria, faria,
how well did you judge men and things!â€

â€œwhat did you please to say, sir?â€ asked caderousse.

â€œnothing, nothing,â€ replied the priest; â€œgo on.â€

â€œit was danglars who wrote the denunciation with his left hand, that his
writing might not be recognized, and fernand who put it in the post.â€

â€œbut,â€ exclaimed the abbÃ© suddenly, â€œyou were there yourself.â€

â€œi!â€ said caderousse, astonished; â€œwho told you i was there?â€

the abbÃ© saw he had overshot the mark, and he added quickly,--â€œno one;
but in order to have known everything so well, you must have been an

â€œtrue, true!â€ said caderousse in a choking voice, â€œi was there.â€

â€œand did you not remonstrate against such infamy?â€ asked the abbÃ©; â€œif
not, you were an accomplice.â€

â€œsir,â€ replied caderousse, â€œthey had made me drink to such an excess
that i nearly lost all perception. i had only an indistinct
understanding of what was passing around me. i said all that a man in
such a state could say; but they both assured me that it was a jest they
were carrying on, and perfectly harmless.â€

â€œnext day--next day, sir, you must have seen plain enough what they had
been doing, yet you said nothing, though you were present when dantÃ¨s
was arrested.â€

confess i had my fears, in the state in which politics then were, and i
held my tongue. it was cowardly, i confess, but it was not criminal.â€


â€œi understand--you allowed matters to take their course, that was all.â€

â€œyes, sir,â€ answered caderousse; â€œand remorse preys on me night and day.
i often ask pardon of god, i swear to you, because this action, the only
one with which i have seriously to reproach myself in all my life, is no
doubt the cause of my abject condition. i am expiating a moment of
selfishness, and so i always say to la carconte, when she complains,
â€˜hold your tongue, woman; it is the will of god.â€™â€ and caderousse bowed
his head with every sign of real repentance.

â€œwell, sir,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œyou have spoke

n unreservedly; and thus to
accuse yourself is to deserve pardon.â€

â€œunfortunately, edmond is dead, and has not pardoned me.â€

â€œhe did not know,â€ said the abbÃ©.

â€œbut he knows it all now,â€ interrupted caderousse; â€œthey say the dead
know everything.â€ there was a brief silence; the abbÃ© rose and paced up
and down pensively, and then resumed his seat. â€œyou have two or three
times mentioned a m. morrel,â€ he said; â€œwho was he?â€

â€œthe owner of the _pharaon_ and patron of dantÃ¨s.â€

â€œand what part did he play in this sad drama?â€ inquired the abbÃ©.

â€œthe part of an honest man, full of courage and real regard. twenty
times he interceded for edmond. when the emperor returned, he wrote,

. ten times, as i told
you, he came to see dantÃ¨sâ€™ father, and offered to receive him in his
own house; and the night or two before his death, as i have already
said, he left his purse on the mantelpiece, with which they paid the old
manâ€™s debts, and buried him decently; and so edmondâ€™s father died, as he
had lived, without doing harm to anyone. i have the purse still by me--a
large one, made of red silk.â€

â€œand,â€ asked the abbÃ©, â€œis m. morrel still alive?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied caderousse.

â€œin that case,â€ replied the abbÃ©, â€œhe should be rich, happy.â€

caderousse smiled bitterly. â€œyes, happy as myself,â€ said he.

â€œwhat! m. morrel unhappy?â€ exclaimed the abbÃ©.

â€œhe is reduced almost to the last extremity--nay, he is almost at the
point of dishonor.â€

â€œhow?â€

â€œyes,â€ continued caderousse, â€œso it is; after five and twenty years of
labor, after having acquired a most honorable name in the trade of
marseilles, m. morrel is utterly ruined; he has lost fi

all this, instead of lessening, only augments his sorrows. if he were
alone in the world he would blow out his brains, and there would be an
end.â€

â€œhorrible!â€ ejaculated the priest.

â€œand it is thus heaven recompenses virtue, sir,â€ added caderousse. â€œyou
see, i, who never did a bad action but that i have told you of--am in
destitution, with my poor wife dying of fever before my very eyes, and i
unable to do anything in the world for her; i shall die of hunger, as
old dantÃ¨s did, while fernand and danglars are rolling in wealth.â€

â€œhow is that?â€

â€œbecause their deeds have brought them good fortune, while honest men
have been reduced to misery.â€

it was stated that the comte de morcerf (this was the name he bore) had
entered the service of ali pasha with the rank of instructor-general.
ali pasha was killed, as you know, but before he died he recompensed the
services of fernand by leaving him a considerable sum, with which he
returned to france, when he was gazetted lieutenant-general.â€


â€œso that now----?â€ inquired the abbÃ©.

â€œso that now,â€ continued caderousse, â€œhe owns a magnificent house--no.

moment, then, making an effort at self-control, he said, â€œand mercÃ©dÃ¨s--

â€œdisappeared,â€ said caderousse, â€œyes, as the sun disappears, to rise the
next day with still more splendor.â€

â€œhas she made a fortune also?â€ inquired the abbÃ©, with an ironical
smile.

seems less astonishing than it otherwise might.â€

â€œmercÃ©dÃ¨s was at first in the deepest despair at the blow which deprived
her of edmond. i have told you of her attempts to propitiate m. de

despair, a new affliction overtook her. this was the departure of

at his first coming he had not said a word of love to mercÃ©dÃ¨s; at the
second he reminded her that he loved her. mercÃ©dÃ¨s begged for six months
more in which to await and mourn for edmond.â€

â€œso that,â€ said the abbÃ©, with a bitter smile, â€œthat makes eighteen
months in all. what more could the most devoted lover desire?â€ then he
murmured the words of the english poet, â€œâ€˜frailty, thy name is woman.â€™â€

â€œsix months afterwards,â€ continued caderousse, â€œthe marriage took place
in the church of accoules.â€

â€œthe very church in which she was to have married edmond,â€ murmured the
priest; â€œthere was only a change of bridegrooms.â€

â€œwell, mercÃ©dÃ¨s was married,â€ proceeded caderousse; â€œbut although in the
eyes of the world she appeared calm, she nearly fainted as she passed la

celebrated with him whom she might have known she still loved, had she

e was in constant dread of edmondâ€™s
return--fernand was very anxious to get his wife away, and to depart
himself. there were too many unpleasant possibilities associated with
the catalans, and eight days after the wedding they left marseilles.â€

â€œdid you ever see mercÃ©dÃ¨s again?â€ inquired the priest.

â€œyes, during the spanish war, at perpignan, where fernand had left her;
she was attending to the education of her son.â€ the abbÃ© started. â€œher
son?â€ said he.

â€œyes,â€ replied caderousse, â€œlittle albert.â€

â€œbut, then, to be able to instruct her child,â€ continued the abbÃ©, â€œshe
must have received an education herself. i understood from edmond that
she was the daughter of a simple fisherman, beautiful but uneducated.â€

â€œoh,â€ replied caderousse, â€œdid he know so little of his lovely
betrothed? mercÃ©dÃ¨s might have been a queen, sir, if the crown were to
be placed on the heads of the loveliest and most intelligent. fernandâ€™s

between ourselves, she did this in order to distract her mind, that she
might forget; and she only filled her head in order to alleviate the
weight on her heart. but now her position in life is assured,â€ continued
caderousse; â€œno doubt fortune and honors have comforted her; she is
rich, a countess, and yet----â€

caderousse paused.

â€œand yet what?â€ asked the abbÃ©.

â€œyet, i am sure, she is not happy,â€ said caderousse.

â€œwhat makes you believe this?â€

â€œwhy, when i found myself utterly destitute, i thought my old friends
would, perhaps, assist me. so i went to danglars, who would not even
receive me. i called on fernand, who sent me a hundred francs by his
valet-de-chambre.â€

â€œthen you did not see either of them?â€

â€œno, but madame de morcerf saw me.â€

â€œhow was that?â€

â€œas i went away a

has been as lucky as the rest; no doubt he is as rich as danglars, as
high in station as fernand. i only, as you see, have remained poor,
wretched, and forgotten.â€

â€œyou are mistaken, my friend,â€ replied the abbÃ©; â€œgod may seem sometimes
to forget for a time, while his justice reposes, but there always comes
a moment when he remembers--and behold--a proof!â€ as he spoke, the abbÃ©
took the diamond from his pocket, and giving it to caderousse, said,--
â€œhere, my friend, take this diamond, it is yours.â€

â€œwhat, for me only?â€ cried caderousse, â€œah, sir, do not jest with me!â€

â€œthis diamond was to have been shared among his friends. edmond had one
friend only, and thus it cannot be divided. take the diamond, then, and
sell it; it is worth fifty thousand francs, and i repeat my wish that
this sum may suffice to release you from your wretchedness.â€

â€œoh, sir,â€ said caderousse, putting out one hand timidly, and with the

other wiping away the perspiration which bedewed his brow,--â€œoh, sir, do
not make a jest of the happiness or despair of a man.â€


â€œi know what happiness and what despair are, and i never make a jest of
such feelings. take it, then, but in exchange----â€

caderousse, who touched the diamond, withdrew his hand. the abbÃ© smiled.
â€œin exchange,â€ he continued, â€œgive me the red silk purse that m. morrel
left on old dantÃ¨sâ€™ chimney-piece, and which you tell me is still in
your hands.â€ caderousse, more and more astonished, went toward a large
oaken cupboard, opened it, and gave the abbÃ© a long purse of faded red
silk, round which were two copper runners that had once been gilt. the
abbÃ© took it, and in return gave caderousse the diamond.

â€œoh, you

are a man of god, sir,â€ cried caderousse; â€œfor no one knew that
edmond had given you this diamond, and you might have kept it.â€

â€œwhich,â€ said the abbÃ© to himself, â€œyou would have done.â€ the abbÃ© rose,
took his hat and gloves. â€œwell,â€ he said, â€œall you have told me is
perfectly true, then, and i may believe it in every particular.â€

â€œsee, sir,â€ replied caderousse, â€œin this corner is a crucifix in holy
wood--here on this shelf is my wifeâ€™s testament; open this book, and i
will swear upon it with my hand on the crucifix. i will swear to you by
my soulâ€™s salvation, my faith as a christian, i have told everything to
you as it occurred, and as the recording angel will tell it to the ear
of god at the day of the last judgment!â€

â€œâ€˜tis well,â€ said the abbÃ©, convinced by his manner and tone that
caderousse spoke the truth. â€œâ€˜tis well, and may

abbÃ© with difficulty got away from the enthusiastic thanks of
caderousse, opened the door himself, got out and mounted his horse, once
more saluted the innkeeper, who kept uttering his loud farewells, and
then returned by the road he had travelled in coming. when caderousse
turned around, he saw behind him la carconte, paler and trembling more
than ever. â€œis, then, all that i have heard really true?â€ she inquired.

â€œwhat? that he has given the diamond to us only?â€ inquired caderousse,
half bewildered with joy; â€œyes, nothing more true! see, here it is.â€ the
woman gazed at it a moment, and then said, in a gloomy voice, â€œsuppose
itâ€™s false?â€ caderousse started and turned pale. â€œfalse!â€ he muttered.

caderousse remained for a moment aghast under the weight of such an
idea. â€œoh!â€ he said, taking up his hat, which he placed on the red
handkerchief tied round his head, â€œwe will soon find out.â€

â€œin what way?â€

â€œwhy, the fair is on at beaucaire, there are always jewellers from paris
there, and i will show it to them. look after the house, wife, and i
shall be back in two hours,â€ and caderousse left the house in haste, and
ran rapidly in the direction opposite to that which the priest had
taken. â€œfifty thousand francs!â€ muttered la carconte when left alone;
â€œit is a large sum of money, but it is not a fortune.â€

place on the road between bellegarde and beaucaire, a man of about
thirty or two and thirty, dressed in a bright blue frock coat, nankeen
trousers, a

recisely,â€ answered bertuccio; â€œbut he had, seven or eight years
before this period, sold his establishment to a tailor at marseilles,
who, having almost ruined himself in his old trade, wished to make his
fortune in another. of course, we made the same arrangements with the
new landlord that we had with the old; and it was of this man that i
intended to ask shelter.â€

â€œwhat was his name?â€ inquired the count, who seemed to become somewhat
interested in bertuccioâ€™s story.

â€œgaspard caderousse; he had married a woman from the village of
carconte, and whom we did not know by any other name than that of her
village. she was suffering from malarial fever, and seemed dying by
inches. as for her husband, he was a strapping fellow of forty, or five
and forty, who had more than once, in time of danger, given ample proof
of his presence of mind and courage.â€

â€œand you say,â€ interrupted monte cristo â€œthat this took place towards
the year----â€

â€œ1829, your excellency.â€

â€œin wha

â€œjune.â€

â€œthe beginning or the end?â€

â€œthe evening of the 3d.â€


â€œah,â€ said monte cristo â€œthe evening of the 3d of june, 1829. go on.â€

â€œit was from caderousse that i intended demanding shelter, and, as we
never entered by the door that opened onto the road, i resolved not to
break through the rule, so climbing over the garden-hedge, i crept
amongst the olive and wild fig trees, and fearing that caderousse might
have some guest, i entered a kind of shed in which i had often passed
the night, and which was only separated from the inn by a partition, in
which holes had been made in order to enable us to watch an opportunity
of announcing our presence. my intention was, if caderousse was alone,
to acquaint him with my presence, finish the meal the custom-house
officers had interrupted, and profit by the threatened storm to return
to the rhÃ´ne, and ascertain the state of our vessel and its crew. i

tepped into the shed, and it was fortunate i did so, for at that moment
caderousse entered with a stranger.

â€œi waited patiently, not to overhear what they said, but because i could
do nothing else; besides, the same thing had occurred often before. the
man who was with caderousse was evidently a stranger to the south of
france; he was one of those merchants who come to sell jewellery at the
beaucaire fair, and who during the month the fair lasts, and during
which there is so great an influx of merchants and customers from all
parts of europe, often have dealings to the amount of 100,000 to 150,000
francs. caderousse entered hastily. then, seeing that the room was, as
usual, empty, and only guarded by the dog, he called to his wife,
â€˜hello, carconte,â€™ said he, â€˜the

of the inn and the apparent poverty of
the persons who were about to sell him a diamond that seemed to have
come from the casket of a prince. â€˜relate your story, madame,â€™ said he,
wishing, no doubt, to profit by the absence of the husband, so that the
latter could not influence the wifeâ€™s story, to see if the two recitals
tallied.

â€œâ€˜oh,â€™ returned she, â€˜it was a gift of heaven. my husband was a great
friend, in 1814 or 1815, of a sailor named edmond dantÃ¨s. this poor
fellow, whom caderousse had forgotten, had not forgotten him, and at his
death he bequeathed this diamond to him.â€™--â€˜but how did he obtain it?â€™
asked the jeweller; â€˜had he it before he was imprisoned?â€™--â€˜no,
monsieur; but it appears that in prison he made the acquaintance of a
rich englishman, and as in prison he fell sick, and dantÃ¨s took the same
care of him as if he had been his brother, the englishman, when he was
set free, gave this stone to dantÃ¨s, who, less fortunate, died, and, in
his turn, left

it to us, and charged the excellent abbÃ©, who was here
this morning, to deliver it.â€™--â€˜the same story,â€™ muttered the jeweller;
â€˜and improbable as it seemed at first, it may be true. thereâ€™s only the
price we are not agreed about.â€™--â€˜how not agreed about?â€™ said
caderousse. â€˜i thought we agreed for the price i asked.â€™--â€˜that is,â€™
replied the jeweller, â€˜i offered 40,000 francs.â€™--â€˜forty thousand,â€™
cried la carconte; â€˜we will not part with it for that sum. the abbÃ© told
us it was worth 50,000. without the setting.â€™

â€œâ€˜what was the abbÃ©â€™s name?â€™ asked the indefatigable questioner.--â€˜the
abbÃ© busoni,â€™ said la carconte.--â€˜he was a foreigner?â€™--â€˜an italian,
from the neighborhood of mantua, i believe.â€™--â€˜let me see this diamo

again,â€™ replied the jeweller; â€˜the first time you are often mistaken as
to the value of a stone.â€™ caderousse took from his pocket a small case
of black shagreen, opened, and gave it to the jeweller. at the sight of
the diamond, which was as large as a hazel-nut, la carconteâ€™s eyes
sparkled with cupidity.â€

â€œand what did you think of this fine story, eavesdropper?â€ said monte
cristo; â€œdid you credit it?â€

â€œyes, your excellency. i did not look on caderousse as a bad man, and i
thought him incapable of committing a crime, or even a theft.â€

â€œthat did more honor to your heart than to your experience, m.
bertuccio. had you known this edmond dantÃ¨s, of whom they spoke?â€

â€œno, your excellency, i had never heard of him before, and never but
once afterwards, and that was from the abbÃ© busoni himself, when i saw
him in the prison at nÃ®mes.â€

â€œgo on.â€

â€œthe jeweller took the ring, and drawing from his pocket a pair of steel
pliers and a

small set of copper scales, he took the stone out of its
setting, and weighed it carefully. â€˜i will give you 45,000,â€™ said he,
â€˜but not a sou more; besides, as that is the exact value of the stone, i
brought just that sum with me.â€™--â€˜oh, thatâ€™s no matter,â€™ replied
caderousse, â€˜i will go back with you to fetch the other 5,000 francs.â€™--
â€˜no,â€™ returned the jeweller, giving back the diamond and the ring to
caderousse--â€˜no, it is worth no more, and i am sorry i offered so much,
for the stone has a flaw in it, which i had not seen. however, i will
not go back on my word, and i will give 45,000.â€™--â€˜at least, replace the
diamond in the ring,â€™ said la carconte sharply.--â€˜ah, true,â€™ replied the
jeweller, and he reset the stone.--â€˜no matter,â€™ observed caderousse,
replacing the box in his pocket, â€˜someone else will purchase it.â€™--

prison; if at the end of three or four months you are set at liberty,
the ring will be lost, or a false stone, worth three francs, will be
given you, instead of a diamond worth 50,000 or perhaps 55,000 francs;
from which you must allow that one runs considerable risk in
purchasing.â€™ caderousse and his wife looked eagerly at each other.--
â€˜no,â€™ said caderousse, â€˜we are not rich enough to lose 5,000 francs.â€™--
â€˜as you please, my dear sir,â€™ said the jeweller; â€˜i had, however, as you
see, brought you the money in bright coin.â€™ and he drew from his pocket
a handful of gold, and held it sparkling before the dazzled eyes of the
innkeeper, and in the other hand he held a packet of bank-notes.

think of this?â€™ he asked in a low voice.--â€˜let him have it--let him have
it,â€™ she said. â€˜if he returns to beaucaire without the diamond, he will
inform against us, and, as he says, who knows if we shall ever again see
the abbÃ© busoni?--in all probability we shall never see him.â€™--â€˜well,
then, so i will!â€™ said caderousse; â€˜so you may have the diamond for
45,000 francs. but my wife wants a gold chain, and i want a pair of
silver buckles.â€™ the jeweller drew from his pocket a long flat box,
which contained several samples of the articles demanded. â€˜here,â€™ he
said, â€˜i am very straightforward in my dealings--take your choice.â€™ the
woman selected a gold chain worth about five louis, and the husband a
pair of buckles, worth perhaps fifteen francs.--â€˜i hope you will not
complain now?â€™ said the jeweller.

â€œâ€˜the abbÃ© told me it was worth 50,000 francs,â€™ muttered caderousse.
â€˜come, come--give it to me! what a strange fellow you are,â€™ said the
jeweller, taking the diamond from his hand. â€˜i give you 45,000 francs--
that is, 2,500 livres of income,--a fortune such as i wish i had myself,
and you are not satisfied!â€™--â€˜and the five and forty thousand francs,â€™
inquired caderousse in a hoarse voice, â€˜where are they? come--let us see
them.â€™--â€˜here they are,â€™ replied the jeweller, and he counted out upon
the table 15,000 francs in gold, and 30,000 francs in bank-notes.

â€œâ€˜wait while i light the lamp,â€™ said la carconte; â€˜it is growing dark,
and there may be some mistake.â€™ in fact, night had come on during this
conversation, and with night the storm which had been threatening for
the last half-hour. the thunder growled in the distance; but it was

absorbed as they were all three with the demon of gain. i myself felt; a
strange kind of fascination at the sight of all this gold and all these
bank-notes; it seemed to me that i was in a dream, and, as it always
happens in a dream, i felt myself riveted to the spot. caderousse
counted and again counted the gold and the notes, then handed them to
his wife, who counted and counted them again in her turn. during this
time, the jeweller made the diamond play and sparkle in the lamplight,
and the gem threw out jets of light which made him unmindful of those
which--precursors of the storm--began to play in at the windows. â€˜well,â€™
inquired the jeweller, â€˜is the cash all right?â€™

â€œâ€˜yes,â€™ said caderousse. â€˜give me the pocket-book, la carconte, and find

â€œla carconte went to a cupboard, and returned with an old leathern
pocket-book and a bag. from the former she took some greasy letters, and
put in their place the bank-notes, and from the bag took two or three
crowns of six livres each, which, in all probability, formed the entire
fortune of the miserable couple. â€˜there,â€™ said caderousse; â€˜and now,
although you have wronged us of perhaps 10,000 francs, will you have
your supper with us? i invite you with good-will.â€™--â€˜thank you,â€™ replied
the jeweller, â€˜it must be getting late, and i must return to beaucaire--
my wife will be getting uneasy.â€™ he drew out his watch, and exclaimed,
â€˜_morbleu!_ nearly nine oâ€™clock--why, i shall not get back to beaucaire
before midnight! good-night, my friends. if the abbÃ© busoni should by
any accident return, think of me.â€™--â€˜in

â€˜true, but that makes no difference. write to me at paris, to m.
joannes, in the palais royal, arcade pierre, no. 45. i will make the
journey on purpose to see him, if it is worth while.â€™ at this moment
there was a tremendous clap of thunder, accompanied by a flash of
lightning so vivid, that it quite eclipsed the light of the lamp.


â€œâ€˜see here,â€™ exclaimed caderousse. â€˜you cannot think of going out in
such weather as this.â€™--â€˜oh, i am not afraid of thunder,â€™ said the
jeweller.--â€˜and then there are robbers,â€™ said la carconte. â€˜the road is
never very safe during fair time.â€™--â€˜oh, as to the robbers,â€™ said
joannes, â€˜here is something for them,â€™ and he drew from his pocket a
pair of small pistols, loaded to the muzzle. â€˜here,â€™ said he, â€˜are dogs
who bark and bite at the same time, they are for the two first who shall
have a longing

â€œcaderousse and his wife again interchanged a meaning look. it seemed as
though they were both inspired at the same time with some horrible
thought. â€˜well, then, a good journey to you,â€™ said caderousse.--
â€˜thanks,â€™ replied the jeweller. he then took his cane, which he had
placed against an old cupboard, and went out. at the moment when he
opened the door, such a gust of wind came in that the lamp was nearly
extinguished. â€˜oh,â€™ said he, â€˜this is very nice weather, and two leagues
to go in such a storm.â€™--â€˜remain,â€™ said caderousse. â€˜you can sleep
here.â€™--â€˜yes; do stay,â€™ added la carconte in a tremulous voice; â€˜we will
take every care of you.â€™--â€˜no; i must sleep at

good-night.â€™ caderousse followed him slowly to the threshold. â€˜i can see
neither heaven nor earth,â€™ said the jeweller, who was outside the door.
â€˜do i turn to the right, or to the left hand?â€™--â€˜to the right,â€™ said
caderousse. â€˜you cannot go wrong--the road is bordered by trees on both
sides.â€™--â€˜good--all right,â€™ said a voice almost lost in the distance.
â€˜close the door,â€™ said la carconte; â€˜i do not like open doors when it
thunders.â€™--â€˜particularly when there is money in the house, eh?â€™
answered caderousse, double-locking the door.


â€œhe came into the room, went to the cupboard, took out the bag and
pocket-book, and both began, for the third time, to count their gold and
bank-notes. i never saw

 such an expression of cupidity as the flickering
lamp revealed in those two countenances. the woman, especially, was
hideous; her usual feverish tremulousness was intensified, her
countenance had become livid, and her eyes resembled burning coals.
â€˜why,â€™ she inquired in a hoarse voice, â€˜did you invite him to sleep here
tonight?â€™--â€˜why?â€™ said caderousse with a shudder; â€˜why, that he might
not have the trouble of returning to beaucaire.â€™--â€˜ah,â€™ responded the
woman, with an expression impossible to describe; â€˜i thought it was for
something else.â€™--â€˜woman, woman--why do you have such ideas?â€™ cried
caderousse; â€˜or, if you have them, why donâ€™t you keep them to
yourself?â€™--â€˜well,â€™ said la carconte, after a momentâ€™s pause, â€˜you are
not a man.â€™--â€˜what do you mean?â€™ added caderousse.--â€˜if you had been a

should not have reached beaucaire.â€™--â€˜woman!â€™--â€˜the road takes a turn--
he is obliged to follow it--while alongside of the canal there is a
shorter road.â€™--â€˜woman!--you offend the good god. there--listen!â€™ and at
this moment there was a tremendous peal of thunder, while the livid
lightning illumined the room, and the thunder, rolling away in the
distance, seemed to withdraw unwillingly from the cursed abode. â€˜mercy!â€™
said caderousse, crossing himself.


â€œat the same moment, and in the midst of the terrifying silence which
usually follows a clap of thunder, they heard a knocking at the door.
caderousse and his wife started and looked aghast at each other. â€˜whoâ€™s
there?â€™ cried caderousse, rising, and drawing up in a heap the gold and
notes scattered over the table, and which he covered with his two
hands.--â€˜it is i,â€™ shouted a voice.--â€˜and who are you?â€™--â€˜eh, _pardieu!_
joannes, the jeweller.â€™--â€˜well, a

said la carconte with a horrid smile. â€˜why, the good god sends him back
again.â€™ caderousse sank pale and breathless into his chair. la carconte,
on the contrary, rose, and going with a firm step towards the door,
opened it, saying, as she did so--â€˜come in, dear m. joannes.â€™--â€˜_ma
foi_,â€™ said the jeweller, drenched with rain, â€˜i am not destined to
return to beaucaire tonight. the shortest follies are best, my dear
caderousse. you offered me hospitality, and i accept it, and have
returned to sleep beneath your friendly roof.â€™ caderousse stammered out
something, while he wiped away the sweat that started to his brow. la
carconte double-locked the door behind the jeweller.â€



chapter 45. the rain of blood

as the jeweller returned to the apartment, he cast around him a
scrutinizing glance--but there was nothing to excite suspicion, if it
did not exist, or to confirm it, if it were already awakened.

 hands still grasped the gold and bank-notes, and la
carconte called up her sweetest smiles while welcoming the reappearance
of their guest. â€˜well, well,â€™ said the jeweller, â€˜you seem, my good
friends, to have had some fears respecting the accuracy of your money,
by counting it over so carefully directly i was gone.â€™--â€˜oh, no,â€™
answered caderousse, â€˜that was not my reason, i can assure you; but the
circumstances by which we have become possessed of this wealth are so
unexpected, as to make us scarcely credit our good fortune, and it is
only by placing the actual proof of our riches before our eyes that we
can persuade ourselves that the whole affair is not a dream.â€™ the
jeweller smiled.--â€˜have you any other guests in your house?â€™ inquired
he.--â€˜nobody but ourselves,â€™ replied caderousse; â€˜the fact is, we do not

would think of stopping here.â€™--â€˜then i am afraid i shall very much
inconvenience you.â€™--â€˜inconvenience us? not at all, my dear sir,â€™ said
la carconte in her most gracious manner. â€˜not at all, i assure you.â€™--
â€˜but where will you manage to stow me?â€™--â€˜in the chamber overhead.â€™--
â€˜surely that is where you yourselves sleep?â€™--â€˜never mind that; we have
a second bed in the adjoining room.â€™ caderousse stared at his wife with
much astonishment.

â€œthe jeweller, meanwhile, was humming a song as he stood warming his
back at the fire la carconte had kindled to dry the wet garments of her
guest; and this done, she next occupied herself in arranging his supper,
by spreading a napkin at the end of the table, and placing on it the
slender remains of their dinner, to which she added three or four fresh-
laid eggs. caderousse had once more parted with his treasure--the
banknotes were replaced in the

g, and the whole carefully locked in the cupboard. he then began
pacing the room with a pensive and gloomy air, glancing from time to
time at the jeweller, who stood reeking with the steam from his wet
clothes, and merely changing his place on the warm hearth, to enable the
whole of his garments to be dried.

â€œâ€˜there,â€™ said la carconte, as she placed a bottle of wine on the table,
â€˜supper is ready whenever you are.â€™--â€˜and you?â€™ asked joannes.--â€˜i donâ€™t
want any supper,â€™ said caderousse.--â€˜we dined so very late,â€™ hastily
interposed la carconte.--â€˜then it seems i am to eat alone,â€™ remarked the
jeweller.--â€˜oh, we shall have the pleasure of waiting upon you,â€™
answered la carconte, with an eager attention she was not accustomed to
manifest even to guests who paid for what they took.

â€œfrom time to time caderousse darted on his wife keen, searching
glances, but rapid as the lightning flash. the storm still continued.
â€˜there, there,â€™ said la carconte; â€˜do you hea

r that? upon my word, you
did well to come back.â€™--â€˜nevertheless,â€™ replied the jeweller, â€˜if by
the time i have finished my supper the tempest has at all abated, i
shall make another start.â€™--â€˜itâ€™s the mistral,â€™ said caderousse, â€˜and it
will be sure to last till tomorrow morning.â€™ he sighed heavily.--â€˜well,â€™
said the jeweller, as he placed himself at table, â€˜all i can say is, so
much the worse for those who are abroad.â€™--â€˜yes,â€™ chimed in la carconte,
â€˜they will have a wretched night of it.â€™

â€œthe jeweller began eating his supper, and the woman, who was ordinarily
so querulous and indifferent to all who approached her, was suddenly
transformed into the most smiling and attentive hostess. had the u

man on whom she lavished her assiduities been previously acquainted with
her, so sudden an alteration might well have excited suspicion in his
mind, or at least have greatly astonished him. caderousse, meanwhile,
continued to pace the room in gloomy silence, sedulously avoiding the
sight of his guest; but as soon as the stranger had completed his
repast, the agitated innkeeper went eagerly to the door and opened it.
â€˜i believe the storm is over,â€™ said he. but as if to contradict his
statement, at that instant a violent clap of thunder seemed to shake the
house to its very foundation, while a sudden gust of wind, mingled with
rain, extinguished the lamp he held in his hand. trembling and

struck, caderousse hastily shut the door and returned to his guest,
while la carconte lighted a candle by the smouldering ashes that
glimmered on the hearth. â€˜you must be tired,â€™ said she to the jeweller;
â€˜i have spread a pair of white sheets on your bed; go up when you are
ready, and sleep well.â€™

â€œjoannes stayed for a while to see whether the storm seemed to abate in
its fury, but a brief space of time sufficed to assure him that, instead
of diminishing, the violence of the rain and thunder momentaril

increased; resigning himself, therefore, to what seemed inevitable, he
bade his host good-night, and mounted the stairs. he passed over my head
and i heard the flooring creak beneath his footsteps. the quick, eager
glance of la carconte followed him as he ascended, while caderousse, on
the contrary, turned his back, and seemed most anxiously to avoid even
glancing at him.

â€œall these circumstances did not strike me as painfully at the time as
they have since done; in fact, all that had happened (with the exception
of the story of the diamond, which certainly did wear an air of
improbability), appeared natural enough, and called for neither
apprehension nor mistrust; but, worn out as i was with fatigue, and
fully purposing to proceed onwards directly the tempest abated,

determined to obtain a few hoursâ€™ sleep. overhead i could accurately
distinguish every movement of the jeweller, who, after making the best
arrangements in his power for passing a comfortable night, threw himself
on his bed, and i could hear it creak and groan beneath his weight.
insensibly my eyelids grew heavy, deep sleep stole over me, and having
no suspicion of anything wrong, i sought not to shake it off. i looked
into the kitchen once more and saw caderousse sitting by the side of a
long table upon one of the low wooden stools which in country places are
frequently used instead of chairs; his back was turned towards me, so
that i could not see the expression of his countenance--neither should i
have been able to do so had he been placed differently, as his head was
buried between his two hands. la carconte continued to gaze on him for
some time, then shrugging her shoulders, she took her seat immediately
opposite to him. at this moment the expiring

 embers threw up a fresh
flame from the kindling of a piece of wood that lay near, and a bright
light flashed over the room. la carconte still kept her eyes fixed on
her husband, but as he made no sign of changing his position, she
extended her hard, bony hand, and touched him on the forehead.


â€œcaderousse shuddered. the womanâ€™s lips seemed to move, as though she
were talking; but because she merely spoke in an undertone, or my senses
were dulled by sleep, i did not catch a word she uttered. confused
sights and sounds seemed to float before me, and gradually i fell into a
deep, heavy slumber. how long i had been in this unconscious state i
know not, when i was suddenly aroused by the report of a pistol,
followed by a fearful cry. weak and tottering footsteps resounded across
the chamber above m

as if the rain must
have penetrated through the flooring of the room above, for some kind of
moisture appeared to fall, drop by drop, upon my forehead, and when i
passed my hand across my brow, i felt that it was wet and clammy.

â€œto the fearful noises that had awakened me had succeeded the most
perfect silence--unbroken, save by the footsteps of a man walking about
in the chamber above. the staircase creaked, he descended into the room
below, approached the fire and lit a candle. the man was caderousse--he
was pale and his shirt was all bloody. having obtained the light, he
hurried upstairs again, and once more i heard his rapid and uneasy
footsteps. a moment later he came down again, holding in his hand the
small shagreen case, which he opened, to assure himself it contained the
diamond,--seemed to hesitate as to which pocket he should put it in,
then, as if dissatisfied with the security of either pocket, he
deposited it in his red handkerchief, which he carefully rolled round
his head. aft

; feeling certain that i intended to pass the night there, he
had returned to summon his comrades, who just arrived in time to hear
the report of the pistol, and to take me in the midst of such
circumstantial proofs of my guilt as rendered all hopes of proving my
innocence utterly futile. one only chance was left me, that of
beseeching the magistrate before whom i was taken to cause every inquiry
to be made for the abbÃ© busoni, who had stopped at the inn of the pont
du gard on that morning. if caderousse had invented the story relative
to the diamond, and there existed no such person as the abbÃ© busoni,
then, indeed, i was lost past redemption, or, at least, my life hung
upon the feeble chance of caderousse himself being apprehended and
confessing the whole truth. two months passed away in hopeless
expectation on my part, while i must do the magistrate the justice to
say that he used every means to obtain information of the person i
declared could exculpate me if he would. caderousse still eva

that of which i stood accused. when he quitted me,
he bade me be of good courage, and to rely upon his doing all in his
power to convince my judges of my innocence.

â€œi had speedy proofs that the excellent abbÃ© was engaged in my behalf,
for the rigors of my imprisonment were alleviated by many trifling
though acceptable indulgences, and i was told that my trial was to be
postponed to the assizes following those now being held. in the interim
it pleased providence to cause the apprehension of caderousse, who was
discovered in some distant country, and brought back to france, where he
made a full confession, refusing to make the fact of his wifeâ€™s having
suggested and arranged the murder any excuse for his own guilt. the
wretched man was sentenced to the galleys for life, and i was
immediately set at liberty.â€

â€œand then it was, i presume,â€ said monte cristo â€œthat you came to me as
the bearer of a letter from the abbÃ© busoni?â€

â€œlet me ask you why you deceived me?â€

â€œhow have i deceived you?â€

â€œâ€˜how,â€™ do you ask? when we parted at the pont du var, you told me you
were going to travel through piedmont and tuscany; but instead of that,
you come to paris.â€

â€œhow does that annoy you?â€

â€œit does not; on the contrary, i think it will answer my purpose.â€

â€œso,â€ said andrea, â€œyou are speculating upon me?â€

â€œwhat fine words he uses!â€

â€œi warn you, master caderousse, that you are mistaken.â€

â€œwell, well, donâ€™t be angry, my boy; you know well enough what it is to
be unfortunate; and misfortunes make us jealous. i thought you were
earning a living in tuscany or piedmont by acting as _facchino_ or
_cicerone_, and i pitied you sincerely, as i would a child of my own.
you know i always did call you my child.â€

â€œcome, come, what then?â€

â€œpatience--patience!â€

â€œi am patient, but go on.â€

â€œhow can i help that, my boy? i speak to you when i can catch you. you
have a quick horse, a light tilbury, you are naturally as slippery as an
eel; if i had missed you tonight, i might not have had another chance.â€

â€œyou see, i do not conceal myself.â€

â€œyou are lucky; i wish i could say as much, for i do conceal myself; and
then i was afraid you would not recognize me, but you did,â€ added
caderousse with his unpleasant smile. â€œit was very polite of you.â€

â€œcome,â€ said andrea, â€œwhat do you want?â€

â€œyou do not speak affectionately to me, benedetto, my old friend, that
is not right--take care, or i may become troublesome.â€ this menace
smothered the young manâ€™s passion. he urged the horse again into a trot.
â€œyou should not speak so to an old friend like me, caderousse, as you
said just now; you are a native of marseilles, i am----â€

â€œdo you know then now what you are?â€

â€œno, but i was brought up in corsica; you are old and obstinate, i am

has frowned on you, has been kind to me?â€

â€œfortune has been kind to you, then? your tilbury, your groom, your
clothes, are not then hired? good, so much the better,â€ said caderousse,
his eyes sparkling with avarice.

â€œoh, you knew that well enough before speaking to me,â€ said andrea,
becoming more and more excited. â€œif i had been wearing a handkerchief
like yours on my head, rags on my back, and worn-out shoes on my feet,
you would not have known me.â€

â€œwhat an appetite you used to have! is it as good now?â€

â€œoh, yes,â€ replied andrea, laughing.

â€œhow did you come to be dining with that prince whose house you have
just left?â€

â€œhe is not a prince; simply a count.â€

â€œa count, and a rich one too, eh?â€

â€œyes; but you had better not have anything to say to him, for he is not
a very good-tempered gentleman.â€

â€œoh, be easy! i have no design upon your count, and you shall have him
all to yourself. but,â€ said caderousse, again smiling with the
disagreeable expression he had before assumed, â€œyou must pay for it--you
understand?â€

â€œwell, what do you want?â€

â€œi think that with a hundred francs a month----â€

â€œwell?â€

â€œi could live----â€

â€œupon a hundred francs!â€

â€œcome--you understand me; but that with----â€

â€œwith a hundred and fifty francs i should be quite happy.â€

hand of caderousse.

nothing could be better.â€

â€œdo you think so, m. bossuet? and you--what will you become? a peer of
france?â€

â€œah,â€ said andrea, â€œwho knows?â€

â€œmajor cavalcanti is already one, perhaps; but then, hereditary rank is
abolished.â€

â€œno politics, caderousse. and now that you have all you want, and that
we understand each other, jump down from the tilbury and disappear.â€

â€œnot at all, my good friend.â€

â€œhow? not at all?â€

â€œwhy, just think for a moment; with this red handkerchief on my head,
with scarcely any shoes, no papers, and ten gold napoleons in my pocket,
without reckoning what was there before--making in all about two hundred
francs,--why, i should certainly be arrested at the barriers. then, to
justify myself, i should say that

nd i should then be escorted back to the shores of the
mediterranean. then i should become simply no. 106, and good-bye to my
dream of resembling the retired baker! no, no, my boy; i prefer
remaining honorably in the capital.â€ andrea scowled. certainly, as he
had himself owned, the reputed son of major cavalcanti was a wilful
fellow. he drew up for a minute, threw a rapid glance around him, and
then his hand fell instantly into his pocket, where it began playing
with a pistol. but, meanwhile, caderousse, who had never taken his eyes
off his companion, passed his hand behind his back, and opened a long
spanish knife, which he always carried with him, to be ready in case of
need. the two friends, as we see, were worthy of and understood one
another. andreaâ€™s hand left his pocket inoffensively, and was carried up
to the red moustache, which it played with for some time. â€œgood
caderousse,â€ he said, â€œhow happy you will be.â€

â€œi will do my best,â€ said the innkeeper of the pont du gard,

 shutting up
his knife.

â€œwell, then, we will go into paris. but how will you pass through the
barrier without exciting suspicion? it seems to me that you are in more
danger riding than on foot.â€

â€œwait,â€ said caderousse, â€œwe shall see.â€ he then took the great-coat
with the large collar, which the groom had left behind in the tilbury,
and put it on his back; then he took off cavalcantiâ€™s hat, which he
placed upon his own head, and finally he assumed the careless attitude
of a servant whose master drives himself.

â€œbut, tell me,â€ said andrea, â€œam i to remain bareheaded?â€

â€œpooh,â€ said caderousse; â€œit is so windy that your hat can easily appear
to have blown off.â€

â€œwhat are you waiting for?â€ said caderousse. â€œi hope i am not the
cause.â€

â€œhush,â€ said andrea. they passed the barrier without accident. at the
first cross street andrea stopped his horse, and caderousse leaped out.

â€œwell!â€ said andrea,--â€œmy servantâ€™s coat and my hat?â€

â€œah,â€ said caderousse, â€œyou would not like me to risk taking cold?â€

â€œbut what am i to do?â€

â€œyou? oh, you are young while i am beginning to get old. _au revoir_,
benedetto;â€ and running into a court, he disappeared.

â€œalas,â€ said andrea, sighing, â€œone cannot be completely happy in this
world!â€

thousand francs.â€

â€œat ten oâ€™clock then, if you please; i should like it early, as i am
going into the country tomorrow.â€

â€œvery well, at ten oâ€™clock; you are still at the hÃ´tel des princes?â€

â€œyes.â€

the following morning, with the bankerâ€™s usual punctuality, the eighty
thousand francs were placed in the young manâ€™s hands as he was on the
point of starting, after having left two hundred francs for caderousse.
he went out chiefly to avoid this dangerous enemy, and returned as late
as possible in the evening. but scarcely had he stepped out of his
carriage when the porter met him with a parcel in his hand.

â€œsir,â€ said he, â€œthat man has been here.â€

â€œwhat man?â€ said andrea carelessly, apparently forgetting him whom he
but too well recollected.

â€œhim to whom your excellency pays that little annuity.â€

â€œoh,â€ said andrea, â€œmy fatherâ€™s old servant. well, you gave him the two

ly, to ascertain if the letter had been
opened, or if any indiscreet eyes had seen its contents; but it was so
carefully folded, that no one could have read it, and the seal was
perfect. â€œvery well,â€ said he. â€œpoor man, he is a worthy creature.â€ he
left the porter to ponder on these words, not knowing which most to
admire, the master or the servant. â€œtake out the horses quickly, and
come up to me,â€ said andrea to his groom. in two seconds the young man
had reached his room and burnt caderousseâ€™s letter. the servant entered
just as he had finished. â€œyou are about my height, pierre,â€ said he.

â€œi have that honor, your excellency.â€

â€œyou had a new livery yesterday?â€

â€œyes, sir.â€

â€œi have an engagement with a pretty little girl for this evening, and do
not wish to be known; lend me your livery till tomorrow. i may sleep,
perhaps, at an inn.â€

pierre obeyed. five minutes after, andrea left the hotel, completely
disguised, took a cabriolet, and ordered the driver to t

bsence. â€œfor whom are you
looking, my fine fellow?â€ asked the fruiteress on the opposite side.

â€œmonsieur pailletin, if you please, my good woman,â€ replied andrea.

â€œa retired baker?â€ asked the fruiteress.

â€œexactly.â€

â€œhe lives at the end of the yard, on the left, on the third story.â€
 andrea went as she directed him, and on the third floor he found a
hareâ€™s paw, which, by the hasty ringing of the bell, it was evident he
pulled with considerable ill-temper. a moment after caderousseâ€™s face
appeared at the grating in the door. â€œah, you are punctual,â€ said he, as
he drew back the door.

â€œconfound you and your punctuality!â€ said andrea, throwing himself into
a chair in a manner which implied that he would rather have flung it at
the head of his host.

â€œcome, come, my little fellow, donâ€™t be angry. see, i have thought about
you--look at the good breakfast we are going to have; nothing but what
you are fond of.â€ andrea, indeed, inhaled the scent of something coo

all, the pungent smell of musk
and cloves. these odors escaped from two deep dishes which were covered
and placed on a stove, and from a copper pan placed in an old iron pot.
in an adjoining room andrea saw also a tolerably clean table prepared
for two, two bottles of wine sealed, the one with green, the other with
yellow, a supply of brandy in a decanter, and a measure of fruit in a
cabbage-leaf, cleverly arranged on an earthenware plate.


â€œwhat do you think of it, my little fellow?â€ said caderousse. â€œay, that
smells good! you know i used to be a famous cook; do you recollect how
you used to lick your fingers? you were among the first who tasted any
of my dishes, and i think you relished them tolerably.â€ while speaking,
caderousse went on peeling a fresh supply of onions.

â€œbut,â€ said andrea, ill-temperedly, â€œby my faith, if it was only to
breakfast with you, that you disturbed me, i wish the devil had taken
you!â€

â€œmy boy,â€ said caderousse sententiously, â€œone can talk wh

then, you ungrateful being, you are not pleased to see an old friend? i
am weeping with joy.â€ he was truly crying, but it would have been
difficult to say whether joy or the onions produced the greatest effect
on the lachrymal glands of the old innkeeper of the pont-du-gard. â€œhold
your tongue, hypocrite,â€ said andrea; â€œyou love me!â€

â€œyes, i do, or may the devil take me. i know it is a weakness,â€ said
caderousse, â€œbut it overpowers me.â€

â€œand yet it has not prevented your sending for me to play me some
trick.â€

â€œcome,â€ said caderousse, wiping his large knife on his apron, â€œif i did
not like you, do you think i should endure the wretched life you lead
me? think for a moment. you have your servantâ€™s clothes on--you
therefore keep a servant; i have none, and am obliged to prepare my own
meals. you abuse my cookery because you dine at the table dâ€™hÃ´te of the

why do i not? because i would not annoy my little benedetto. come, just
acknowledge that i could, eh?â€ this address was accompanied by a look
which was by no means difficult to understand. â€œwell,â€ said andrea,
â€œadmitting your love, why do you want me to breakfast with you?â€

â€œthat i may have the pleasure of seeing you, my little fellow.â€

â€œwhat is the use of seeing me after we have made all our arrangements?â€

â€œeh, dear friend,â€ said caderousse, â€œare wills ever made without
codicils? but you first came to breakfast, did you not? well, sit down,
and let us begin with these pilchards, and this fresh butter; which i
have put on some vine-leaves to please you, wicked one. ah, yes; you
look at my room, my four straw chairs, my images, three francs each. but
what do you expect? this is not the hÃ´tel des princes.â€

â€œcome, you are growing discontented, you are no longer happy; you, who
only wish to live like a retired baker.â€ caderou

sse sighed. â€œwell, what
have you to say? you have seen your dream realized.â€

â€œi can still say it is a dream; a retired baker, my poor benedetto, is
rich--he has an annuity.â€

â€œwell, you have an annuity.â€

â€œi have?â€


â€œyes, since i bring you your two hundred francs.â€ caderousse shrugged
his shoulders. â€œit is humiliating,â€ said he, â€œthus to receive money
given grudgingly,--an uncertain supply which may soon fail. you see i am
obliged to economize, in case your prosperity should cease. well, my
friend, fortune is inconstant, as the chaplain of the regiment said. i
know your prosperity is great, you rascal; you are to marry the daughter
of danglars.â€

â€œwhat? of danglars?â€

â€œyes, to be sure; must i say baron danglars? i might as well say count

to the good m. morrel. i have dined many times with him and the count of
morcerf, so you see i have some high connections and were i to cultivate
them a little, we might meet in the same drawing-rooms.â€

â€œcome, your jealousy represents everything to you in the wrong light.â€

â€œthat is all very fine, benedetto mio, but i know what i am saying.
perhaps i may one day put on my best coat, and presenting myself at the
great gate, introduce myself. meanwhile let us sit down and eat.â€
 caderousse set the example and attacked the breakfast with good
appetite, praising each dish he set before his visitor. the latter
seemed to have resigned himself; he drew the corks, and partook largely
of the fish with the garlic and fat. â€œah, mate,â€ said caderousse, â€œyou
are getting on better terms with your old landlord!â€

â€œfaith, yes,â€ replied andrea, whose hunger prevailed over every other
feeling.

â€œso you like it, you rogue?â€

â€œso much that i wonder how a man who can cook thus can

 complain of hard
living.â€

â€œdo you see,â€ said caderousse, â€œall my happiness is marred by one
thought?â€

â€œwhat is that?â€

â€œthat i am dependent on another, i who have always gained my own
livelihood honestly.â€

â€œdo not let that disturb you, i have enough for two.â€

â€œno, truly; you may believe me if you will; at the end of every month i
am tormented by remorse.â€

â€œgood caderousse!â€

â€œso much so, that yesterday i would not take the two hundred francs.â€

â€œyes, you wished to speak to me; but was it indeed remorse, tell me?â€

â€œtrue remorse; and, besides, an idea had struck me.â€ andrea shuddered;
he always did so at caderousseâ€™s ideas. â€œit is miserable--do you see?--
always to wait till the end of the month.â€--â€œoh,â€ said andrea
philosophically, determined to watch his companion narrowly, â€œdoes not
life pass in waiting? do i, for instance, fare bette

r? well, i wait
patiently, do i not?â€

â€œyes; because instead of expecting two hundred wretched francs, you
expect five or six thousand, perhaps ten, perhaps even twelve, for you
take care not to let anyone know the utmost. down there, you always had
little presents and christmas-boxes which you tried to hide from your
poor friend caderousse. fortunately he is a cunning fellow, that friend
caderousse.â€

â€œthere you are beginning again to ramble, to talk again and again of the
past! but what is the use of teasing me with going all over that again?â€

â€œah, you are only one and twenty, and can forget the past; i am fifty,
and am obliged to recollect it. but let us return to business.â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œi was going to say, if i were in your place----â€

â€œwell.â€

â€œi would realize----â€

â€œhow would you realize?â€

â€œi would ask for six monthsâ€™ in advance, under pretence of bei

â€œwell, well,â€ said andrea, â€œthat isnâ€™t a bad idea.â€

â€œmy dear friend,â€ said caderousse, â€œeat of my bread, and take my advice;
you will be none the worse off, physically or morally.â€

â€œbut,â€ said andrea, â€œwhy do you not act on the advice you gave me? why
do you not realize a six monthsâ€™, a yearâ€™s advance even, and retire to
brussels? instead of living the retired baker, you might live as a
bankrupt, using his privileges; that would be very good.â€

â€œbut how the devil would you have me retire on twelve hundred francs?â€

â€œthe appetite grows by what it feeds on,â€ said caderousse, grinning and
showing his teeth, like a monkey laughing or a tiger growling. â€œand,â€
 added he, biting off with his large white teeth an enormous mouthful of
bread, â€œi have formed a plan.â€ caderousseâ€™s plans alarmed andrea still
more than his ideas; ideas were but the germ, the plan was reality. â€œlet
me see your plan; i dare say it is a pretty one.â€

â€œwhy not? who formed the plan by which we left the establishment of m---

â€œi do not say,â€ replied andrea, â€œthat you never make a good one; but let

â€œwell,â€ pursued caderousse, â€œcan you without expending one sou, put me

 of getting fifteen thousand francs? no, fifteen thousand are
not enough,--i cannot again become an honest man with less than thirty
thousand francs.â€

â€œno,â€ replied andrea, dryly, â€œno, i cannot.â€

â€œi do not think you understand me,â€ replied caderousse, calmly; â€œi said
without your laying out a sou.â€

â€œdo you want me to commit a robbery, to spoil all my good fortune--and
yours with mine--and both of us to be dragged down there again?â€

â€œit would make very little difference to me,â€ said caderousse, â€œif i
were retaken, i am a poor creature to live alone, and sometimes pine for
my old comrades; not like you, heartless creature, who would be glad
never to see them again.â€ andrea did more than tremble this time, he
turned pale.

â€

â€œdonâ€™t alarm yourself, my little benedetto, but just point out to me
some means of gaining those thirty thousand francs without your
assistance, and i will contrive it.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™ll see--iâ€™ll try to contrive some way,â€ said andrea.

â€œmeanwhile you will raise my monthly allowance to five hundred francs,
my little fellow? i have a fancy, and mean to get a housekeeper.â€

â€œbah,â€ said caderousse, â€œwhen you have access to countless stores.â€ one
would have said andrea anticipated his companionâ€™s words, so did his eye
flash like lightning, but it was but for a moment. â€œtrue,â€ he replied,
â€œand my protector is very kind.â€

â€œthat dear protector,â€ said caderousse; â€œand how much does he give you
monthly?â€

â€œfive thousand francs.â€

â€œas many thousands as you give me hundreds! truly, it is only bastards
who are thus fortunate. five thousand francs per month! what the devil
can you do with all that?â€

â€œoh, it is no trouble to spend that; and i am like you, i want capital.â€

â€œcapital?--yes--i understand--everyone would like capital.â€

â€œwho will give it to you--your prince?â€

â€œfor his death.â€

â€œthe death of your prince?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œhow so?â€

â€œbecause he has made his will in my favor.â€

â€œindeed?â€

â€œon my honor.â€

â€œfor how much?â€

â€œfor five hundred thousand.â€

â€œonly that? itâ€™s little enough.â€

â€œbut so it is.â€

â€œno it cannot be!â€

â€œare you my friend, caderousse?â€

â€œyes, in life or death.â€

â€œwell, i will tell you a secret.â€

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œbut rememberâ€--

â€œah! _pardieu!_ mute as a carp.â€

â€œwell, i thinkâ€--andrea stopped and looked around.

â€œyou think? do not fear; _pardieu!_ we are alone.â€

â€œi think i have discovered my father.â€

â€œyour true father?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œah, truly? and you say that by his will----â€

â€œhe leaves me five hundred thousand livres.â€

â€œare you sure of it?â€

â€œhe showed it me; but that is not all--there is a codicil, as i said
just now.â€

â€œprobably.â€

â€œand in that codicil he acknowledges me.â€

â€œoh, the good father, the brave father, the very honest father!â€ said
caderousse, twirling a plate in the air between his two hands.

â€œnow say if i conceal anything from you?â€

â€œno, and your confidence makes you honorable in my opinion; and your
princely father, is he rich, very rich?â€

â€œyes, he is that; he does not himself know the amount of his fortune.â€

â€œis it possible?â€

â€œit is evident enough to me, who am always at his house. the other day a
bankerâ€™s clerk brought him fifty thousand francs in a portfolio about
the size of your plate; yesterday his

banker brought him a hundred

manâ€™s words sounded to him like metal, and he thought he could hear the
rushing of cascades of louis. â€œand you go into that house?â€ cried he
briskly.

â€œwhen i like.â€

caderousse was thoughtful for a moment. it was easy to perceive he was
revolving some unfortunate idea in his mind. then suddenly,--â€œhow i
should like to see all that,â€ cried he; â€œhow beautiful it must be!â€

â€œit is, in fact, magnificent,â€ said andrea.

â€œand does he not live in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es?â€

â€œyes, no. 30.â€

â€œah,â€ said caderousse, â€œno. 30.â€

â€œyes, a fine house standing alone, between a courtyard and a garden,--
you must know it.â€

â€œpossibly; but it is not the exte

â€œno.â€

â€œwell, it surpasses that.â€

â€œit must be worth oneâ€™s while to stoop, andrea, when that good m. monte

â€œit is not worthwhile to wait for that,â€ said andrea; â€œmoney is as
plentiful in that house as fruit in an orchard.â€

â€œbut you should take me there one day with you.â€

â€œhow can i? on what plea?â€

â€œyou are right; but you have made my mouth water. i must absolutely see
it; i shall find a way.â€

â€œno nonsense, caderousse!â€

â€œi will offer myself as floor-polisher.â€

â€œthe rooms are all carpeted.â€

â€œwell, then, i must be contented to imagine it.â€

â€œthat is the best plan, believe me.â€

â€œtry, at least, to give me an idea of what it is.â€

â€œhow can i?â€

â€œnothing is easier. is it large?â€

â€œmiddling.â€

â€œhow is it arranged?â€

â€œfaith, i should require pen, ink, and paper to make a plan.â€

â€œthey are all here,â€ said caderousse, briskly. he fetched from an old
secretary desk a sh

caderousse, â€œdraw me all that on the paper, my boy.â€ andrea took the pen
with an imperceptible smile and began. â€œthe house, as i said, is between
the court and the garden; in this way, do you see?â€ andrea drew the
garden, the court and the house.


â€œhigh walls?â€

â€œnot more than eight or ten feet.â€

â€œthat is not prudent,â€ said caderousse.

â€œin the court are orange-trees in pots, turf, and clumps of flowers.â€

â€œand no steel-traps?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œthe stables?â€

â€œare on either side of the gate, which you see there.â€ and andrea
continued his plan.

â€œlet us see the ground floor,â€ said caderousse.

â€œon the ground floor, dining-room, two drawing-rooms, billiard-room,
staircase in the hall, and a little back staircase.â€

â€œwindows?â€

see, there is the anteroom and the drawing-room; to the right of the
drawing-room, a library and a study; to the left, a bedroom and a
dressing-room. the famous secretary desk is in the dressing-room.â€

â€œis there a window in the dressing-room?â€

â€œtwo,--one here and one there.â€ andrea sketched two windows in the room,
which formed an angle on the plan, and appeared as a small square added
to the rectangle of the bedroom. caderousse became thoughtful. â€œdoes he
often go to auteuil?â€ added he.

â€œtwo or three times a week. tomorrow, for instance, he is going to spend
the day and night there.â€

â€œare you sure of it?â€

â€œhe has invited me to dine there.â€

â€œthereâ€™s a life for you,â€ said caderousse; â€œa town house and a country
house.â€

â€œthat is what it is to be rich.â€

â€œand shall you dine there?â€

â€œprobably.â€

â€œwhen you dine there, do you sleep there?â€

â€œif i like; i am at home there.â€

caderousse looked at the young man, as
if to get at the truth from the bottom of his heart. but andrea drew a
cigar-case from his pocket, took a havana, quietly lit it, and began
smoking. â€œwhen do you want your twelve hundred francs?â€ said he to
caderousse.

â€œnow, if you have them.â€ andrea took five and twenty louis from his
pocket.

â€œyellow boys?â€ said caderousse; â€œno, i thank you.â€

â€œoh, you despise them.â€

â€œon the contrary, i esteem them, but will not have them.â€

â€œyou can change them, idiot; gold is worth five sous.â€

â€œexactly; and he who changes them will follow friend caderousse, lay
hands on him, and demand what farmers pay him their rent in gold. no
nonsense, my good fellow; silver simply, round coins with the head of
some monarch or other on them. anybody may possess a five-franc piece.â€

â€œbut do you suppose i carry five hu

â€œwell, leave them with your porter; he is to be trusted. i will call for

â€œno, tomorrow; i shall not have time today.â€

â€œwell, tomorrow i will leave them when i go to auteuil.â€

â€œmay i depend on it?â€

â€œcertainly.â€

â€œbecause i shall secure my housekeeper on the strength of it.â€

â€œnow see here, will that be all? eh? and will you not torment me any
more?â€

â€œnever.â€ caderousse had become so gloomy that andrea feared he should be
obliged to notice the change. he redoubled his gayety and carelessness.
â€œhow sprightly you are,â€ said caderousse; â€œone would say you were
already in possession of your property.â€

â€œno, unfortunately; but when i do obtain it----â€

â€œwell?â€

â€œi shall remember old friends, i can tell you that.â€

â€œyes, since you have such a good memory.â€

â€œwhat do you want? it looks as if you were trying to fleece me?â€

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œto leave behind you the diamond you have on your finger. we shall both

â€œhow so?â€ said andrea.

â€œhow? you put on a livery, you disguise yourself as a servant, and yet
keep a diamond on your finger worth four or five thousand francs.â€

â€œyou guess well.â€

â€œi know something of diamonds; i have had some.â€

â€œyou do well to boast of it,â€ said andrea, who, without becoming angry,
as caderousse feared, at this new extortion, quietly resigned the ring.
caderousse looked so closely at it that andrea well knew that he was
examining to see if all the edges were perfect.

â€œit is a false diamond,â€ said caderousse.

â€œyou are joking now,â€ replied andrea.

â€œdo not be angry, we can try it.â€ caderousse went to the window, touched
the glass with it, and found it would cut.

â€œ_confiteor!_â€ said caderousse, putting the diamond on his little

will try to cure myself of my ambition.â€

â€œbut take care the same thing does not happen to you in selling the
diamond you feared with the gold.â€

â€œi shall not sell it--do not fear.â€

â€œnot at least till the day after tomorrow,â€ thought the young man.

â€œhappy rogue,â€ said caderousse; â€œyou are going to find your servants,
your horses, your carriage, and your betrothed!â€

â€œyes,â€ said andrea.

â€œwell, i hope you will make a handsome wedding-present the day you marry
mademoiselle danglars.â€

â€œi have already told you it is a fancy you have taken in your head.â€

â€œwhat fortune has she?â€

â€œbut i tell you----â€

â€œit is not worthwhile.â€

â€œyes, it is.â€

â€œwhy?â€

â€œbecause there is a little secret, a precaution i thought it desirable
to take, one of huret & fichetâ€™s locks, revised and improved by gaspard
caderousse; i will manufacture you a similar one when you are a
capitalist.â€

â€œthank you,â€ said andrea; â€œi will let you know a week beforehand.â€ they
parted. caderousse remained on the landing until he had not only seen
andrea go down the three stories, but also cross the court. then he
returned hastily, shut his door carefully, and began to study, like a
clever architect, the plan andrea had left him.

directly on his face. the door opened so quietly that the thief heard no
sound; but, to his astonishment, the room was suddenly illuminated. he
turned.

â€œah, good-evening, my dear m. caderousse,â€ said monte cristo; â€œwhat are
you doing here, at such an hour?â€


â€œthe abbÃ© busoni!â€ exclaimed caderousse; and, not knowing how this
strange apparition could have entered when he had bolted the doors, he
let fall his bunch of keys, and remained motionless and stupefied. the
count placed himself between caderousse and the window, thus cutting off
from the thief his only chance of retreat. â€œthe abbÃ© busoni!â€ repeated
caderousse, fixing his haggard gaze on the count.

â€œyes, undo

ubtedly, the abbÃ© busoni himself,â€ replied monte cristo. â€œand
i am very glad you recognize me, dear m. caderousse; it proves you have
a good memory, for it must be about ten years since we last met.â€ this
calmness of busoni, combined with his irony and boldness, staggered
caderousse.

â€œthe abbÃ©, the abbÃ©!â€ murmured he, clenching his fists, and his teeth
chattering.

â€œso you would rob the count of monte cristo?â€ continued the false abbÃ©.

â€œreverend sir,â€ murmured caderousse, seeking to regain the window, which
the count pitilessly blocked--â€œreverend sir, i donâ€™t know--believe me--i
take my oath----â€

â€œa pane of glass out,â€ continued the count, â€œa dark lantern, a bunch of
false keys, a secretary desk half forced--it is tolerably evident----â€

caderousse was choking; he looked around for some corner to hide in,
some way of escape.

â€œcome, come,â€ continued the count, â€œi see you are still the same,--an
assassin.â€

â€œreverend sir, since you know

there?â€

â€œno, reverend sir; i have been liberated by someone.â€

â€œthat someone has done society a great kindness.â€

â€œah,â€ said caderousse, â€œi had promised----â€

â€œand you are breaking your promise!â€ interrupted monte cristo.

â€œalas, yes!â€ said caderousse very uneasily.

â€œa bad relapse, that will lead you, if i mistake not, to the place de
grÃ¨ve. so much the worse, so much the worse--_diavolo!_ as they say in
my country.â€

â€œreverend sir, i am impelled----â€

â€œevery criminal says the same thing.â€

â€œpoverty----â€

loaf of bread at a bakerâ€™s door, but not cause him to open a secretary
desk in a house supposed to be inhabited. and when the jeweller johanne

â€œpardon, reverend sir,â€ said caderousse; â€œyou have saved my life once,
save me again!â€

â€œthat is but poor encouragement.â€

â€œare you alone, reverend sir, or have you there soldiers ready to seize
me?â€

â€œi am alone,â€ said the abbÃ©, â€œand i will again have pity on you, and
will let you escape, at the risk of the fresh miseries my weakness may
lead to, if you tell me the truth.â€

â€œah, reverend sir,â€ cried caderousse, clasping his hands, and drawing
nearer to monte cristo, â€œi may indeed say you are my deliverer!â

â€œbenedetto.â€

â€œis that his christian name?â€

â€œhe had no other; he was a foundling.â€

â€œthen this young man escaped with you?â€

â€œhe did.â€

â€œin what way?â€

â€œwe were working at saint-mandrier, near toulon. do you know saint-

â€œi do.â€

â€œin the hour of rest, between noon and one oâ€™clock----â€

â€œgalley-slaves having a nap after dinner! we may well pity the poor
fellows!â€ said the abbÃ©.

â€œnay,â€ said caderousse, â€œone canâ€™t always work--one is not a dog.â€

â€œso much the better for the dogs,â€ said monte cristo.

â€œwhile the rest slept, then, we went away a short distance; we severed
our fetters with a file the englishman had given us, and swam away.â€

â€œand what is become of this benedetto?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know.â€

â€œyou ought to know.â€

â€œno, in truth; we parted at hyÃ¨res.â€ and, to give more weight to his
protestation, caderousse advanced another step towards the abbÃ©, who

ed motionless in his place, as calm as ever, and pursuing his
interrogation. â€œyou lie,â€ said the abbÃ© busoni, with a tone of
irresistible authority.

â€œreverend sir!â€

â€œyou lie! this man is still your friend, and you, perhaps, make use of
him as your accomplice.â€


â€œoh, reverend sir!â€

â€œsince you left toulon what have you lived on? answer me!â€

â€œon what i could get.â€

â€œyou lie,â€ repeated the abbÃ© a third time, with a still more imperative
tone. caderousse, terrified, looked at the count. â€œyou have lived on the
money he has given you.â€

â€œtrue,â€ said caderousse; â€œbenedetto has become the son of a great lord.â€

â€œhow can he be the son of a great lord?â€

â€œa natural son.â€

â€œand what is that great lordâ€™s name?â€

â€œthe count of monte cristo, the very same in whose house we are.â€

â€œbenedetto the countâ€™s son?â€ replied monte cristo, astonished in his
turn.

â€œwell, i should think so, since the count has found him a false

â€œah, yes,â€ said the factitious abbÃ©, who began to understand; â€œand what

â€œandrea cavalcanti.â€

â€œis it, then, that young man whom my friend the count of monte cristo
has received into his house, and who is going to marry mademoiselle
danglars?â€

â€œexactly.â€

â€œand you suffer that, you wretch--you, who know his life and his crime?â€

â€œwhy should i stand in a comradeâ€™s way?â€ said caderousse.

â€œyou are right; it is not you who should apprise m. danglars, it is i.â€

â€œdo not do so, reverend sir.â€

â€œwhy not?â€

â€œbecause you would bring us to ruin.â€

â€œand you think that to save such villains as you i will become an
abettor of their plot, an accomplice in their crimes?â€

â€œreverend sir,â€ said caderousse, drawing still nearer.

â€œi will expose all.â€

â€œto whom?â€

â€œto m. danglars.â€

and striking the count in the breast, â€œyou shall disclose nothing,
reverend sir!â€ to caderousseâ€™s great astonishment, the knife, instead of
piercing the countâ€™s breast, flew back blunted. at the same moment the
count seized with his left hand the assassinâ€™s wrist, and wrung it with
such strength that the knife fell from his stiffened fingers, and
caderousse uttered a cry of pain. but the count, disregarding his cry,
continued to wring the banditâ€™s wrist, until, his arm being dislocated,
he fell first on his knees, then flat on the floor. the count then
placed his foot on his head, saying, â€œi know not what restrains me from
crushing thy skull, rascal.â€


â€œah, mercy--mercy!â€ cried caderousse. the count withdrew his foot.
â€œrise!â€ said he. caderousse rose.

â€œoh!â€ said caderousse, groaning with pain.

â€œtake this pen and paper, and write what i dictate.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know how to write, reverend sir.â€

â€œyou lie! take this pen, and write!â€ caderousse, awed by the superior
power of the abbÃ©, sat down and wrote:--

intend to marry your daughter, is a felon who escaped with me from
confinement at toulon. he was no. 59, and i no. 58. he was called
benedetto, but he is ignorant of his real name, having never known his
parents.

â€œsign it!â€ continued the count.

â€œbut would you ruin me?â€

â€œif i sought your ruin, fool, i should drag you to the first guard-

caderousse signed it. â€œthe address, â€˜to monsieur the baron danglars,

abbÃ© took the note. â€œnow,â€ said he, â€œthat suffices--begone!â€

â€œwhich way?â€

â€œthe way you came.â€

â€œyou wish me to get out at that window?â€

â€œyou got in very well.â€

â€œoh, you have some design against me, reverend sir.â€

â€œidiot! what design can i have?â€

â€œwhy, then, not let me out by the door?â€

â€œwhat would be the advantage of waking the porter?â€

have turned out a murderer.â€

â€œoh, monsieur,â€ said caderousse, â€œmake one more attempt--try me once
more!â€

â€œi will,â€ said the count. â€œlisten--you know if i may be relied on.â€

â€œyes,â€ said caderousse.

â€œif you arrive safely at home----â€

â€œwhat have i to fear, except from you?â€

â€œif you reach your home safely, leave paris, leave france, and wherever
you may be, so long as you conduct yourself well, i will send you a
small annuity; for, if you return home safely, then----â€


â€œthen?â€ asked caderousse, shuddering.

â€œthen i shall believe god has forgiven you, and i will forgive you too.â€

â€œnow begone,â€ said the count, pointing to the window.

caderousse, scarcely yet relying on this promise, put his legs out of
the window and stood on the ladder. â€œnow go down,â€ said the abbÃ©,
folding his arms. understanding he had nothing more to fear from him,
caderousse began to go down. then the count brought the taper to the
window, that it might be seen in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es that a man was
getting out of the window while another held a light.

â€œwhat are you doing, reverend sir? suppose a watchman should pass?â€ and
he blew out the light. he then descended, but it was only when he felt
his foot touch the ground that he was satisfied of his safety.

monte cristo returned to his bedroom, and, glancing rapidly from the
garden to the street, he saw first ca

derousse, who after walking to the
end of the garden, fixed his ladder against the wall at a different part
from where he came in. the count then looking over into the street, saw
the man who appeared to be waiting run in the same direction, and place
himself against the angle of the wall where caderousse would come over.
caderousse climbed the ladder slowly, and looked over the coping to see
if the street was quiet. no one could be seen or heard. the clock of the
invalides struck one. then caderousse sat astride the coping, and
drawing up his ladder passed it over the wall; then he began to descend,
or rather to slide down by the two stanchions, which he did with an ease
which proved how accustomed he was to the exercise. but, once started,
he could not stop. in vain did he see a man start from the shadow when
he was halfway down--in vain did he see an arm raised as he touched the
ground. before he could defend himself that arm struck him so violently
in the back that he let go the ladder,

crying, â€œhelp!â€ a second blow
struck him almost immediately in the side, and he fell, calling, â€œhelp,
murder!â€ then, as he rolled on the ground, his adversary seized him by
the hair, and struck him a third blow in the chest. this time caderousse
endeavored to call again, but he could only utter a groan, and he
shuddered as the blood flowed from his three wounds. the assassin,
finding that he no longer cried out, lifted his head up by the hair; his
eyes were closed, and the mouth was distorted. the murderer, supposing
him dead, let fall his head and disappeared. then caderousse, feeling
that he was leaving him, raised himself on his elbow, and with a dying
voice cried with great effort, â€œmurder! i am dying! help, reverend sir,-
-help!

this mournful appeal pierced the darkness. the door of the back-
staircase opened, then the side-gate of the garden, and ali and his
master were on the spot with lights.



chapter 83. the hand of god

caderousse continued to call piteously, â€œhelp, reverend sir, help!â€

â€œwhat is the matter?â€ asked monte cristo.

â€œhelp,â€ cried caderousse; â€œi am murdered!â€

â€œwe are here;--take courage.â€

â€œah, itâ€™s all over! you are come too late--you are come to see me die.
what blows, what blood!â€ he fainted. ali and his master conveyed the
wounded man into a room. monte cristo motioned to ali to undress him,
and he then examined his dreadful wounds. â€œmy god!â€ he exclaimed, â€œthy
vengeance is sometimes delayed, but only that it may fall the more
effectually.â€ ali looked at his master for further instructions. â€œbring

who had not yet revived.

when the wretched man again opened his eyes, the count looked at him
with a mournful expression of pity, and his lips moved as if in prayer.
â€œa surgeon, reverend sir--a surgeon!â€ said caderousse.

â€œi have sent for one,â€ replied the abbÃ©.

â€œi know he cannot save my life, but he may strengthen me to give my
evidence.â€

â€œagainst my murderer.â€

â€œhimself.â€

â€œi have also sent for the procureur.â€

â€œhe will not come in time; i feel my life fast ebbing.â€

â€œwait a moment,â€ said monte cristo. he left the room, and returned in
five minutes with a phial. the dying manâ€™s eyes were all the time
riveted on the door, through which he hoped succor would arrive.
â€œhasten, reverend sir, hasten! i shall faint again!â€ monte cristo
approached, and dropped on his purple lips three or four drops of the
contents of the phial. caderousse drew a deep breath. â€œoh,â€ said he,
â€œthat is life to me; more, more!â€

â€œtwo drops more would kill you,â€ replied the abbÃ©.

â€œoh, send for someone to whom i can denounce the wretch!â€

â€œshall i write your deposition? you can sign it.â€

â€œyes, yes,â€ said caderousse; and his eyes glistened at the thought of
this posthumous revenge. monte cristo wrote:--

signed it, and fell back on his bed, saying: â€œyou will relate all the
rest, reverend sir; you will say he calls himself andrea cavalcanti. he
lodges at the hÃ´tel des princes. oh, i am dying!â€ he again fainted. the
abbÃ© made him smell the contents of the phial, and he again opened his
eyes. his desire for revenge had not forsaken him.

â€œah, you will tell all i have said, will you not, reverend sir?â€

â€œyes, and much more.â€

â€œwhat more will you say?

â€

â€œi will say he had doubtless given you the plan of this house, in the
hope the count would kill you. i will say, likewise, he had apprised the
count, by a note, of your intention, and, the count being absent, i read
the note and sat up to await you.â€

â€œand he will be guillotined, will be not?â€ said caderousse. â€œpromise me
that, and i will die with that hope.â€

â€œi will say,â€ continued the count, â€œthat he followed and watched you the
whole time, and when he saw you leave the house, ran to the angle of the
wall to conceal himself.â€

â€œdid you see all that?â€

â€œremember my words: â€˜if you return home safely, i shall believe god has

â€œno; for i saw godâ€™s justice placed in the hands of benedetto, and
should have thought it sacrilege to oppose the designs of providence.â€

â€œgodâ€™s justice! speak not of it, reverend sir. if god were just, you
know how many would be punished who now escape.â€

â€œpatience,â€ said the abbÃ©, in a tone which made the dying man shudder;
â€œhave patience!â€ caderousse looked at him with amazement. â€œbesides,â€
 said the abbÃ©, â€œgod is merciful to all, as he has been to you; he is
first a father, then a judge.â€

â€œdo you then believe in god?â€ said caderousse.

â€œhad i been so unhappy as not to believe in him until now,â€ said monte
cristo, â€œi must believe on seeing you.â€ caderousse raised his clenched
hands towards heaven.

â€œlisten,â€ said the abbÃ©, extending his hand over the wounded man, as if
to command him to believe; â€œthis is what th

rarely granted so abundantly, this has been your course--you have given
yourself up to sloth and drunkenness, and in a fit of intoxication have
ruined your best friend.â€

â€œhelp!â€ cried caderousse; â€œi require a surgeon, not a priest; perhaps i
am not mortally wounded--i may not die; perhaps they can yet save my
life.â€

â€œyour wounds are so far mortal that, without the three drops i gave you,
you would now be dead. listen, then.â€

no longer when you once possessed it; you wished to double it, and how?-

brought you to justice.â€

â€œit was not i who wished to kill the jew,â€ said caderousse; â€œit was la

justice would have slain you,--but god, in his mercy, spared your life.â€

â€œ_pardieu!_ to transport me for life, how merciful!â€

â€œyou thought it a mercy then, miserable wretch! the coward who feared

â€œno one, i tell you, will escape; benedetto will be punished.â€

â€œthen, you, too, will be punished, for you did not do your duty as a

face. â€œwell, the abbÃ©--the abbÃ© busoni.â€ monte cristo took off the wig
which disfigured him, and let fall his black hair, which added so much
to the beauty of his pallid features. â€œoh?â€ said caderousse,
thunderstruck, â€œbut for that black hair, i should say you were the

â€œyes, caderousse, you have seen me; you knew me once.â€

â€œwho, then, are you? and why, if you knew me, do you let me die?â€

â€œbecause nothing can save you; your wounds are mortal. had it been

count had watched the approach of death. he knew this was the last
struggle. he approached the dying man, and, leaning over him with a calm
and melancholy look, he whispered, â€œi am--i am----â€

and his almost closed lips uttered a name so low that the count himself
appeared afraid to hear it. caderousse, who had raised himself on his
knees, and stretched out his arm, tried to draw back, then clasping his
hands, and raising them with a desperate effort, â€œo my god, my god!â€
 said he, â€œpardon me for having denied thee; thou dost exist, thou art

the daring attempt to rob the count was the topic of conversation
throughout paris for the next fortnight. the dying man had signed a
deposition declaring benedetto to be the assassin. the police had orders
to make the strictest search for the murderer. caderousseâ€™s knife, dark
lantern, bunch of keys, and clothing, excepting the waistcoat, which
could not be found, were deposited at the registry; the corpse was
conveyed to the morgue. the count told everyone that this adventure had
happened during his absence at auteuil, and that he only knew what was

requested to pass the night in his house, to examine some valuable books
in his library. bertuccio alone turned pale whenever benedettoâ€

â€œtrue,â€ said beauchamp; â€œi saw it in the paper. who is this caderousse?â€

â€œsome provenÃ§al, it appears. m. de villefort heard of him at marseilles,
and m. danglars recollects having seen him. consequently, the procureur
is very active in the affair, and the prefect of police very much
interested; and, thanks to that interest, for which i am very grateful,
they send me all the robbers of paris and the neighborhood, under
pretence of their being caderousseâ€™s murderers, so that in three months,
if this continues, every robber and assassin in france will have th

€ replied monte cristo; â€œthe waistcoat and
the letter were both what is termed circumstantial evidence; i therefore
sent them to the kingâ€™s attorney. you understand, my dear baron, that
legal methods are the safest in criminal cases; it was, perhaps, some
plot against you.â€ andrea looked steadily at monte cristo and
disappeared in the second drawing-room.


â€œpossibly,â€ said danglars; â€œwas not this murdered man an old galley-
slave?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the count; â€œa felon named caderousse.â€ danglars turned
slightly pale; andrea reached the anteroom beyond the little drawing-
room.

â€œbut go on signing,â€ said monte cristo; â€œi perceive that my story has
caused a general emotion, and i beg to apologize to you, baroness, and
to mademoiselle danglars.â€ the baroness, who had signed, returned the
pen to the notary. â€œprince cavalcanti,â€ said the latter; â€œprince
cavalcanti, where are you?â€

â€œandrea, andrea,â€ repeated several young people, who were already on
sufficie

€œwhich of you gentlemen,â€ asked the magistrate, without replying to the
count, â€œanswers to the name of andrea cavalcanti?â€ a cry of astonishment
was heard from all parts of the room. they searched; they questioned.
â€œbut who then is andrea cavalcanti?â€ asked danglars in amazement.

â€œa galley-slave, escaped from confinement at toulon.â€

â€œand what crime has he committed?â€

â€œhe is accused,â€ said the commissary with his inflexible voice, â€œof
having assassinated the man named caderousse, his former companion in
prison, at the moment he was making his escape from the house of the
count of monte cristo.â€ monte cristo cast a rapid glance around him.
andrea was gone.



chapter 97. the departure for belgium

a few minutes after the scene of confusion produced in the salons of m.
danglars by the unexpected appearance of the brigade of soldiers, and by
the disclosure which had followed, the mansion was deserted with as much
rapidity as if a case of plague or of cholera morbus had

f escape. at this precise time, the first gendarme andrea had
noticed walked upstairs, preceded by the commissary of police, and
supported by the second gendarme who guarded the staircase and was
himself re-enforced by the one stationed at the door.

andrea was indebted for this visit to the following circumstances. at
daybreak, the telegraphs were set at work in all directions, and almost
immediately the authorities in every district had exerted their utmost
endeavors to arrest the murderer of caderousse. compiÃ¨gne, that royal
residence and fortified town, is well furnished with authorities,
gendarmes, and commissaries of police; they therefore began operations
as soon as the telegraphic despatch arrived, and the bell and bottle
being the best-known hotel in the town, they had naturally directed
their first inquiries there.


now, besides the reports of the sentinels guarding the hÃ´tel de ville,
which is next door to the bell and bottle, it had been stated by others
that a number of traveller

in which a handkerchief is filled with sand, pebbles, and two-sous

the head and shoulders of the unhappy sufferer. â€œlet us horsewhip the
fine gentleman!â€ said others.

but andrea, turning towards them, winked his eyes, rolled his tongue
around his cheeks, and smacked his lips in a manner equivalent to a
hundred words among the bandits when forced to be silent. it was a
masonic sign caderousse had taught him. he was immediately recognized as
one of them; the handkerchief was thrown down, and the iron-heeled shoe
replaced on the foot of the wretch to whom it belonged. some voices were
heard to say that the gentleman was right; that he intended to be civil,
in his way, and that they would set the example of liberty of
conscience,--and the mob retired. the keeper was so stupefied at this
scene that he took andrea by the hands and began examining his person,
attributing the sudden submis

anged;
another valet was engaged for himself, a new servant for noirtier, two
women had entered madame de villefortâ€™s service,--in fact, everywhere,
to the concierge and coachmen, new faces were presented to the different
masters of the house, thus widening the division which had always
existed between the members of the same family.

the assizes, also, were about to begin, and villefort, shut up in his
room, exerted himself with feverish anxiety in drawing up the case
against the murderer of caderousse. this affair, like all those in which
the count of monte cristo had interfered, caused a great sensation in
paris. the proofs were certainly not convincing, since they rested upon
a few words written by an escaped galley-slave on his death-bed, and who
might have been actuated by hatred or revenge in accusing his companion.
but the mind of the procureur was made up; he felt assured that
benedetto was guilty, and he hoped by his skill in conducting this
aggravated case to flatter his self-love,

_, i have called three times without once seeing him. still, his
sister did not seem uneasy, and told me that though she had not seen him
for two or three days, she was sure he was well.â€

â€œah, now i think of it, the count of monte cristo cannot appear in the
hall,â€ said beauchamp.

â€œwhy not?â€

â€œbecause he is an actor in the drama.â€

â€œhas he assassinated anyone, then?â€

â€œno, on the contrary, they wished to assassinate him. you know that it
was in leaving his house that m. de caderousse was murdered by his
friend benedetto. you know that the famous waistcoat was found in his
house, containing the letter which stopped the signature of the
marriage-contract. do you see the waistcoat? there it is, all blood-
stained, on the desk, as a testimony of the crime.â€

â€œah, very good.â€

â€œhush, gentlemen, here is the court; let us go back to our places.â€ a
noise was heard in the hall; the sergeant called his two patrons with an
energetic â€œhem!â€ and the door-keeper appearing,
