hard to displease me with a bride; and deeply will i hold myself bound
to your highness for a good deed, which will fulfil all promises made in
favour of your servant and vassal.â€

â€œwe will not forget it,â€ said prince john; â€œand that we may instantly go
to work, command our seneschal presently to order the attendance of the
lady rowena and her company--that is, the rude churl her guardian, and
the saxon ox whom the black knight struck down in the tournament, upon
this eveningâ€™s banquet.--de bigot,â€ he added to his seneschal, â€œthou
wilt word this our second summons so courteously, as to gratify the
pride of these saxons, and make it impossible for them again to refuse;
although, by the bones of becket, courtesy to them is casting pearls
before swine.â€

prince john had proceeded thus far, and was about to give the signal for
retiring from the lists, when a small billet was put into his hand.

what he had been devouring, and that he had taken the contents of the
karum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas they were in fact beccaficoes
and nightingales, his ignorance brought him in for an ample share of the
ridicule which would have been more justly bestowed on his gluttony.

the long feast had at length its end; and, while the goblet circulated
freely, men talked of the feats of the preceding tournament,--of
the unknown victor in the archery games, of the black knight, whose
self-denial had induced him to withdraw from the honours he had
won,--and of the gallant ivanhoe, who had so dearly bought the honours
of the day. the topics were treated with military frankness, and the
jest and laugh went round the hall. the brow of prince john alone was
overclouded during these discussions; some overpowering care seemed
agitating his mind, and it was only when he received occasional hints
from his attendants, that he seemed to take interest in what was passing

some place in which they might spend the night, which was now fast
approaching.

the place where the traveller found himself seemed unpropitious for
obtaining either shelter or refreshment, and he was likely to be reduced
to the usual expedient of knights-errant, who, on such occasions, turned
their horses to graze, and laid themselves down to meditate on their
lady-mistress, with an oak-tree for a canopy. but the black knight
either had no mistress to meditate upon, or, being as indifferent
in love as he seemed to be in war, was not sufficiently occupied by
passionate reflections upon her beauty and cruelty, to be able to
parry the effects of fatigue and hunger, and suffer love to act as
a substitute for the solid comforts of a bed and supper. he felt
dissatisfied, therefore, when, looking around, he found himself deeply
involved in woods, through which indeed there were many open glades,
and some paths, but such as

se arches remained, though the roof
had fallen down betwixt them; over the others it remained entire. the
entrance to this ancient place of devotion was under a very low round
arch, ornamented by several courses of that zig-zag moulding, resembling
sharkâ€™s teeth, which appears so often in the more ancient saxon
architecture. a belfry rose above the porch on four small pillars,
within which hung the green and weatherbeaten bell, the feeble sounds of
which had been some time before heard by the black knight.

the whole peaceful and quiet scene lay glimmering in twilight before
the eyes of the traveller, giving him good assurance of lodging for the
night; since it was a special duty of those hermits who dwelt in
the woods, to exercise hospitality towards benighted or bewildered
passengers.

accordingly, the knight took no time to consider minutely the
particulars which we have detailed, but thanking saint julian (the
patron of travellers) who had sent him good harbourage, he leaped from
his horse a

the hermit could scarcely forbear from smiling at his guestâ€™s reply.

and of counsel; and moreover, i see that my poor monastic fare likes

â€œwho is he?â€ answered the hermit; â€œi tell thee he is a friend.â€

â€œbut what friend?â€ answered the knight; â€œfor he may be friend to thee
and none of mine?â€

â€œwhat friend?â€ replied the hermit; â€œthat, now, is one of the questions
that is more easily asked than answered. what friend?--why, he is, now

the priest; â€œsomething there is of a whizzing in my brain, and of

so saying, he stepped to the stone basin, in which the waters of
the fountain as they fell formed bubbles which danced in the white
moonlight, and took so long a drought as if he had meant to exhaust the
spring.

â€œwhen didst thou drink as deep a drought of water before, holy clerk of
copmanhurst?â€ said the black knight.

â€œnever since my wine-butt leaked, and let out its liquor by an illegal
vent,â€ replied the friar, â€œand so left me nothing to drink but my
patronâ€™s bounty here.â€

then plunging his hands and head into the fountain, he washed from them
all marks of the midnight revel.

thus refreshed and sobered, the jolly priest twirled his heavy partisan
round his head with three fingers, as if he had been balancing a reed,
exclaiming at the same time, â€œwhere be those false ravishers, who carry

the kingâ€™s highway the kingâ€™s liege subjects?--is he turned thief and
oppressor?â€

â€œoppressor he ever was,â€ said locksley.

â€œand for thief,â€ said the priest, â€œi doubt if ever he were even half so
honest a man as many a thief of my acquaintance.â€

â€œmove on, priest, and be silent,â€ said the yeoman; â€œit were better you

templar, thou shalt return an answer to this bold challenge.â€

â€œi would rather do it at the swordâ€™s point than at that of the pen,â€
 said bois-guilbert; â€œbut be it as you will.â€

he sat down accordingly, and indited, in the french language, an epistle
of the following tenor:--â€œsir reginald front-de-boeuf, with his noble
and knightly allies and confederates, receive no defiances at the hands
of slaves, bondsmen, or fugitives. if the person calling himself the
black knight have indeed a claim to the honours of chivalry, he ought
to know that he stands degraded by his present association, and has no
right to ask reckoning at the hands of good men of noble blood. touching
the prisoners we have made, we do in christian charity require you to
send a man of religion, to receive their confession, and reconcile them
with god; since it is our fixed intention to execute them this morning
before noon, so that their heads being placed on the battlements,

this letter being folded, was delivered to the squire, and by him to
the messenger who waited without, as the answer to that which he had
brought.

the yeoman having thus accomplished his mission, returned to the
head-quarters of the allies, which were for the present established
under a venerable oak-tree, about three arrow-flights distant from the
castle. here wamba and gurth, with their allies the black knight and
locksley, and the jovial hermit, awaited with impatience an answer to
their summons. around, and at a distance from them, were seen many a
bold yeoman, whose silvan dress and weatherbeaten countenances showed
the ordinary nature of their occupation. more than two hundred had
already assembled, and others were fast coming in. those whom they
obeyed as leaders were only distinguished from the others by a feather

to wamba. the jester looked at each of the four corners of the paper
with such a grin of affected intelligence as a monkey is apt to assume
upon similar occasions, then cut a caper, and gave the letter to
locksley.

â€œif the long letters were bows, and the short letters broad arrows, i
might know something of the matter,â€ said the brave yeoman; â€œbut as the
matter stands, the meaning is as safe, for me, as the stag thatâ€™s at
twelve miles distance.â€

â€œi must be clerk, then,â€ said the black knight; and taking the letter
from locksley, he first read it over to himself, and then explained the
meaning in saxon to his confederates.

â€œexecute the noble cedric!â€ exclaimed wamba; â€œby the rood, thou must be
mistaken, sir knight.â€

â€œnot i, my worthy friend,â€ replied the knight, â€œi have explained the
words as they are here set down.â€

â€œthen, by st thomas of canterbury,â€ replied gurth, â€œwe will have the
castle, should we tear it down with our hands!â€

â€œwe have nothing else

â€œâ€˜tis but a contrivance to gain time,â€ said locksley; â€œthey dare not do
a deed for which i could exact a fearful penalty.â€

â€œi would,â€ said the black knight, â€œthere were some one among us who
could obtain admission into the castle, and discover how the case stands
with the besieged. methinks, as they require a confessor to be sent,
this holy hermit might at once exercise his pious vocation, and procure
us the information we desire.â€

â€œa plague on thee, and thy advice!â€ said the pious hermit; â€œi tell thee,
sir slothful knight, that when i doff my friarâ€™s frock, my priesthood,

of father confessor?â€

all looked on each other, and were silent.

he hath wanted wit to turn his folly to account.â€

retiring; â€œthe archery must in some degree have ceased, since they are
now fighting hand to hand.--look again, there is now less danger.â€

rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, â€œholy

progress of the strife--heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed

cedric, although not greatly confident in ulricaâ€™s message, omitted not
to communicate her promise to the black knight and locksley. they were
well pleased to find they had a friend within the place, who might, in
the moment of need, be able to facilitate their entrance, and readily
agreed with the saxon that a storm, under whatever disadvantages, ought
to be attempted, as the only means of liberating the prisoners now in
the hands of the cruel front-de-boeuf.

â€œthe royal blood of alfred is endangered,â€ said cedric.

heavy halberd to play around his head as a shepherd boy flourishes his
light crook.

â€œtrue, holy clerk,â€ said the black knight, â€œtrue as if saint dunstan

noble cedric should assume the direction of this assault?â€

â€œnot a jot i,â€ returned cedric; â€œi have never been wont to study either

â€œsince it stands thus with noble cedric,â€ said locksley, â€œi am most
willing to take on me the direction of the archery; and ye shall hang
me up on my own trysting-tree, an the defenders be permitted to show
themselves over the walls without being stuck with as many shafts as
there are cloves in a gammon of bacon at christmas.â€

â€œwell said, stout yeoman,â€ answered the black knight; â€œand if i be
thought worthy to have a charge in these matters, and can find among
these brave men as many as are willing to follow a true english knight,
for so i may surely call myself, i am ready, with such skill as my
experience has taught me, to lead them to the attack of these walls.â€

the parts being thus distributed to the leaders, they commenced the
first assault, of which the reader has already heard the issue.

when the barbican was carried, the sable knight sent notice of the

and the habitual use of weapons.

the knight employed the interval in causing to be constructed a sort of
floating bridge, or long raft, by means of which he hoped to cross the
moat in despite of the resistance of the enemy. this was a work of some
time, which the leaders the less regretted, as it gave ulrica leisure to
execute her plan of diversion in their favour, whatever that might be.

when the raft was completed, the black knight addressed the
besiegers:--â€œit avails not waiting here longer, my friends; the sun is
descending to the west--and i have that upon my hands which will not
permit me to tarry with you another day. besides, it will be a marvel if
the horsemen come not upon us from york, unless we speedily accomplish
our purpose. wherefore, one of ye go to locksley, and bid him commence a
discharge of arrows on the opposite side of the castle, and move forward
as if about to assault it; and you, true english hear

 open the door, and
launch the floating bridge.â€

the portal, which led from the inner-wall of the barbican to the moat,
and which corresponded with a sallyport in the main wall of the castle,
was now suddenly opened; the temporary bridge was then thrust forward,
and soon flashed in the waters, extending its length between the castle
and outwork, and forming a slippery and precarious passage for two men
abreast to cross the moat. well aware of the importance of taking the
foe by surprise, the black knight, closely followed by cedric, threw
himself upon the bridge, and reached the opposite side. here he began to
thunder with his axe upon the gate of the castle, protected in part from
the shot and stones cast by the defenders by the ruins of the former
drawbridge, which the templar had demolished in his retreat from the
barbican, leaving the counterpoise still attached to the upper part of
the portal. the followers of the knight had no such shelter; two were
instantly shot with cross-bow bolts, an

the others retreated back into the barbican.

the situation of cedric and of the black knight was now truly dangerous,
and would have been still more so, but for the constancy of the
archers in the barbican, who ceased not to shower their arrows upon
the battlements, distracting the attention of those by whom they were
manned, and thus affording a respite to their two chiefs from the
storm of missiles which must otherwise have overwhelmed them. but their
situation was eminently perilous, and was becoming more so with every
moment.

â€œshame on ye all!â€ cried de bracy to the soldiers a

within--see yonder flag, it is the appointed signal--torquilstone is
ours!--think of honour, think of spoil--one effort, and the place is
ours!â€

with that he bent his good bow, and sent a shaft right through the
breast of one of the men-at-arms, who, under de bracyâ€™s direction, was
loosening a fragment from one of the battlements to precipitate on the
heads of cedric and the black knight. a second soldier caught from the
hands of the dying man the iron crow, with which he heaved at and
had loosened the stone pinnacle, when, receiving an arrow through his
head-piece, he dropped from the battlements into the moat a dead man.
the men-at-arms were daunted, for no armour seemed proof against the
shot of this tremendous archer.

â€œdo you give ground, base knaves!â€ said de bracy; â€œâ€˜mount joye saint

and, snatching it up, he again assailed the l

â€œit is well thought upon,â€ said de bracy; â€œi will play my part--templar,
thou wilt not fail me?â€

â€œhand and glove, i will not!â€ said bois-guilbert. â€œbut haste thee, in
the name of god!â€

de bracy hastily drew his men together, and rushed down to the
postern-gate, which he caused instantly to be thrown open. but scarce
was this done ere the portentous strength of the black knight forced his
way inward in despite of de bracy and his followers. two of the foremost
instantly fell, and the rest gave way notwithstanding all their leaderâ€™s
efforts to stop them.

â€œdogs!â€ said de bracy, â€œwill ye let two men win our only pass for
safety?â€

â€œhe is the devil!â€ said a veteran man-at-arms, bearing back from the
blows of their sable antagonist.

â€œand if he be the devil,â€ replied de bracy, â€œwould you fly from him into
the mouth of hell?--the castle burns behind us,

 villains!--let despair
give you courage, or let me forward! i will cope with this champion
myself.â€

and well and chivalrous did de bracy that day maintain the fame he had
acquired in the civil wars of that dreadful period. the vaulted passage
to which the postern gave entrance, and in which these two redoubted
champions were now fighting hand to hand, rung with the furious blows
which they dealt each other, de bracy with his sword, the black knight
with his ponderous axe. at length the norman received a blow, which,
though its force was partly parried by his shield, for otherwise never
more would de bracy have again moved limb, descended yet with such
violence on his crest, that he measured his length on the paved floor.

â€œyield thee, de bracy,â€ said the black champion, stooping over him, and
holding against the bars of his helmet the fatal poniard with which the
knights dispatched their enemies, (and which was called the dagger of
me

but a dead man.â€

â€œi will not yield,â€ replied de bracy faintly, â€œto an unknown conqueror.
tell me thy name, or work thy pleasure on me--it shall never be said
that maurice de bracy was prisoner to a nameless churl.â€

the black knight whispered something into the ear of the vanquished.

â€œi yield me to be true prisoner, rescue or no rescue,â€ answered the
norman, exchanging his tone of stern and determined obstinacy for one of
deep though sullen submission.

â€œgo to the barbican,â€ said the victor, in a tone of authority, â€œand
there wait my further orders.â€

â€œyet first, let me say,â€ said de bracy, â€œwhat it imports thee to know.

â€œwilfred of ivanhoe!â€ exclaimed the black knight--â€œprisoner, and

â€œascend yonder winding stair,â€ said de bracy; â€œit leads to his
apartment--wilt thou not accept my guidance?â€ he added, in a submissive
voice.

â€œno. to the barbican, and there wait my orders. i trust thee not, de

so saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with
her shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her
cries, and without regarding the menaces and defiance which ivanhoe
thundered against him. â€œhound of the temple--stain to thine order--set
free the damsel! traitor of bois-guilbert, it is ivanhoe commands
thee!--villain, i will have thy heartâ€™s blood!â€

â€œi had not found thee, wilfred,â€ said the black knight, who at that
instant entered the apartment, â€œbut for thy shouts.â€

â€œif thou beâ€™st true knight,â€ said wilfred, â€œthink not of me--pursue yon
ravisher--save the lady rowena--look to the noble cedric!â€

â€œin their turn,â€ answered he of the fetterlock, â€œbut thine is first.â€

and seizing upon ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the
templar had carried off rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and
having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again

the place of rendezvous was an aged oak; not however the same to which
locksley had conducted gurth and wamba in the earlier part of the story,

seat--a throne of turf erected under the twisted branches of the huge
oak, and the silvan followers were gathered around him. he assigned to
the black knight a seat at his right hand, and to cedric a place upon

â€œi have but to say,â€ added the saxon, â€œthat, during the funeral rites

of the funeral banqueting; and, i speak in name of the noble edith,

was set apart for the church, and for pious uses; a portion was next
allotted to a sort of public treasury; a part was assigned to the widows
and children of those who had fallen, or to be expended in masses for
the souls of such as had left no surviving family. the rest was divided
amongst the outlaws, according to their rank and merit, and the judgment
of the chief, on all such doubtful questions as occurred, was delivered
with great shrewdness, and received with absolute submission. the
black knight was not a little surprised to find that men, in a state so
lawless, were nevertheless among themselves so regularly and equitably
governed, and all that he observed added to his opinion of the justice
and judgment of their leader.

when each had taken his own proportion of the booty, and while the
treasurer, accompanied by four tall yeomen, was transporting that
belonging to the state to some place of concealment or of security, the
portion devoted to the church still remained unappropriated.

â€œso help me the promise, fair sirs,â€ said isaac, even more alarmed than
before, â€œas no such sounds ever crossed my lips! alas! i am an aged
beggarâ€™d man--i fear me a childless--have ruth on me, and let me go!â€

â€œnay,â€ said the friar, â€œif thou dost retract vows made in favour of holy
church, thou must do penance.â€

accordingly, he raised his halberd, and would have laid the staff of
it lustily on the jewâ€™s shoulders, had not the black knight stopped the
blow, and thereby transferred the holy clerkâ€™s resentment to himself.

â€œwere many of front-de-boeufâ€™s men taken?â€ demanded the black knight.

â€œnone of note enough to be put to ransom,â€ answered the captain; â€œa

master--enough had been done for revenge and profit; the bunch of them
were not worth a cardecu. the prisoner i speak of is better booty--a

and wearing apparel.--here cometh the worthy prelate, as pert as a

advice:--â€œbe liberal of thine offers, isaac, and spare not thy purse for
thy daughterâ€™s safety. credit me, that the gold thou shalt spare in
her cause, will hereafter give thee as much agony as if it were poured
molten down thy throat.â€

isaac acquiesced with a deep groan, and set forth on his journey,
accompanied by two tall foresters, who were to be his guides, and at the
same time his guards, through the wood.

the black knight, who had seen with no small interest these various
proceedings, now took his leave of the outlaw in turn; nor could he
avoid expressing his surprise at having witnessed so much of civil
policy amongst persons cast out from all the ordinary protection and
influence of the laws.

â€œgood fruit, sir knight,â€ said the yeoman, â€œwill sometimes grow on a
sorry tree; and evil times are not always productive of evil alone and
unmixed. amongst those who are drawn into this lawless state, there

rupture with his superior, and to renew, from time to time, the various
arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as
champion on this occasion, bois-guilbert, without either accelerating or
ensuring the fate of rebecca, would follow the only course by which he
could save himself from degradation and disgrace.

     shadows avaunt!--richardâ€™s himself again.
     richard iii

when the black knight--for it becomes necessary to resume the train of
his adventures--left the trysting-tree of the generous outlaw, he held
his way straight to a neighbouring religious house, of small extent
and revenue, called the priory of saint botolph, to which the wounded
ivanhoe had been removed when the castle was taken, under the guidance
of the faithful gurth, and the magnanimous wamba. it is unnecessary at
present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt wilfred
and his deliverer; suffice it to

say, that after long and grave
communication, messengers were dispatched by the prior in several
directions, and that on the succeeding morning the black knight was
about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester wamba, who
attended as his guide.

â€œwe will meet,â€ he said to ivanhoe, â€œat coningsburgh, the castle of the
deceased athelstane, since there thy father cedric holds the funeral
feast for his noble relation. i would see your saxon kindred together,
sir wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore.
thou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy
father.â€

so saying, he took an affec

anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. but the black knight would
not listen to the proposal.

â€œrest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength enough to travel on the
next. i will have no guide with me but honest wamba, who can play priest
or fool as i shall be most in the humour.â€

â€œand i,â€ said wamba, â€œwill attend you with all my heart. i would fain
see the feasting at the funeral of athelstane; for, if it be not full
and frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and
cupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. always, sir

knight in managing her.

â€œshe is at the most dangerous period for maidens as well as mares,â€ said
the old man, laughing at his own jest, â€œbeing barely in her fifteenth
year.â€

ivanhoe, who had other web to weave than to stand canvassing a palfreyâ€™s
paces with its owner, lent but a deaf ear to the priorâ€™s grave advices
and facetious jests, and having leapt on his mare, and commanded his
squire (for such gurth now called himself) to keep close by his side, he
followed the track of the black knight into the forest, while the
prior stood at the gate of the convent looking after him, and
ejaculating,--â€œsaint mary! how prompt and fiery be these men of war!
i would i had not trusted malkin to his keeping, for, crippled as i
am with the cold rheum, i am undone if aught but good befalls her. and
yet,â€ said he, recollecting himself, â€œas i would not spare my own old
and disabled limbs in the good cause of old england, so malkin must eâ€™en
run her hazard on the same venture; and it may be t

the knight undid the clasp of the baldric, and indulged his
fellow-traveller, who immediately hung the bugle round his own neck.

â€œtra-lira-la,â€ said he, whistling the notes; â€œnay, i know my gamut as
well as another.â€

â€œhow mean you, knave?â€ said the knight; â€œrestore me the bugle.â€

â€œcontent you, sir knight, it is in safe keeping. when valour and folly
travel, folly should bear the horn, because she can blow the best.â€

â€œnay but, rogue,â€ said the black knight, â€œthis exceedeth thy
license--beware ye tamper not with my patience.â€

â€œurge me not with violence, sir knight,â€ said the jester, keeping at a
distance from the impatient champion, â€œor folly will show a clean pair
of heels, and leave valour to find out his way through the wood as best
he may.â€

â€œnay, thou hast hit me there,â€ said the knight; â€œand, sooth to say, i

shield which hung around his neck.

â€œthanks, trusty armourers,â€ said the knight.--â€œwamba, let us close with
them,â€--and he rode straight to the thicket. he was met by six or seven
men-at-arms, who ran against him with their lances at full career. three
of the weapons struck against him, and splintered with as little effect
as if they had been driven against a tower of steel. the black knightâ€™s
eyes seemed to flash fire even through the aperture of his visor. he
raised himself in his stirrups with an air of inexpressible dignity, and
exclaimed, â€œwhat means this, my masters!â€--the men made no other reply
than by drawing their swords and attacking him on every side, crying,
â€œdie, tyrant!â€

â€œha! saint edward! ha! saint george!â€ said the black knight, striking
down a man at every invocation; â€œhave we traitors here?â€

his opponents, desperate as they were, bore back fro

carried death in every blow, and it seemed as if the terror of his
single strength was about to gain the battle against such odds, when a
knight, in blue armour, who had hitherto kept himself behind the other
assailants, spurred forward with his lance, and taking aim, not at the
rider but at the steed, wounded the noble animal mortally.

â€œthat was a felon stroke!â€ exclaimed the black knight, as the steed fell
to the earth, bearing his rider along with him.

and at this moment, wamba winded the bugle, for the whole had passed so
speedily, that he had not time to do so sooner. the sudden sound made
the murderers bear back once more, and wamba, though so imperfectly
weaponed, did not hesitate to rush in and assist the black knight to
rise.

â€œshame on ye, false cowards!â€ exclaimed he in the blue harness, who
seemed to lead the assailants, â€œdo ye fly from the empty blast of a hor

animated by his words, they attacked the black knight anew, whose best
refuge was now to place his back against an oak, and defend himself with
his sword. the felon knight, who had taken another spear, watching the
moment when his formidable antagonist was most closely pressed, galloped
against him in hopes to nail him with his lance against the tree, when
his purpose was again intercepted by wamba. the jester, making up by
agility the want of strength, and little noticed by the men-at-arms, who
were busied in their more important object, hovered

ressed close by several men completely
armed, and began to be fatigued by the violent exertions necessary
to defend himself on so many points at nearly the same moment, when
a grey-goose shaft suddenly stretched on the earth one of the most
formidable of his assailants, and a band of yeomen broke forth from the
glade, headed by locksley and the jovial friar, who, taking ready and
effectual part in the fray, soon disposed of the ruffians, all of whom
lay on the spot dead or mortally wounded. the black knight thanked his
deliverers with a dignity they had not observed in his former bearing,
which hitherto had seemed rather that of a blunt bold soldier, than of a
person of exalted rank.

â€œit concerns me much,â€ he said, â€œeven before i express my full gratitude
to my ready friends, to discover, if i may, who have been my unprovoked
enemies.--open the visor of that blue knight, wamba, who seems the chief
of these villains.â€

expect to have seen under such circumstances.

â€œwaldemar fitzurse!â€ he said in astonishment; â€œwhat could urge one of
thy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?â€

â€œrichard,â€ said the captive knight, looking up to him, â€œthou knowest
little of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can
lead every child of adam.â€

â€œrevenge?â€ answered the black knight; â€œi never wronged thee--on me thou
hast nought to revenge.â€

â€œmy daughter, richard, whose alliance thou didst scorn--was that no
injury to a norman, whose blood is noble as thine own?â€

â€œthy daughter?â€ replied the black knight; â€œa proper cause of enmity, and
followed up to a bloody issue!--stand back, my masters, i would speak

running loose, and let him depart unharmed.â€

â€œbut that i judge i listen to a voice whose behests must not be
disputed,â€ answered the yeoman, â€œi would send a shaft after the skulking
villain that should spare him the labour of a long journey.â€

â€œthou bearest an english heart, locksley,â€ said the black knight, â€œand
well dost judge thou art the more bound to obey my behest--i am richard
of england!â€

at these words, pronounced in a tone of majesty suited to the high rank,
and no less distinguished character of coeur-de-lion, the yeomen at once
kneeled down before him, and at the same time tendered their allegiance,
and implored pardon for their offences.

them with a countenance in which his habitual good-humour had already

the astonishment of ivanhoe was beyond bounds, when he saw his master
besprinkled with blood, and six or seven dead bodies lying around in
the little glade in which the battle had taken place. nor was he less
surprised to see richard surrounded by so many silvan attendants, the
outlaws, as they seemed to be, of the forest, and a perilous retinue
therefore for a prince. he hesitated whether to address the king as the
black knight-errant, or in what other manner to demean himself towards
him. richard saw his embarrassment.

â€œfear not, wilfred,â€ he said, â€œto address richard plantagenet as
himself, since thou seest him in the company of true english hearts,
although it may be they have been urged a few steps aside by warm
english blood.â€

assurances can add nothing to those of our sovereign; yet, let me say
somewhat proudly, that of men

coningsburgh.

having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in
which the obsequies of athelstane were celebrated under different forms,
cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them,
for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight
connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to join those
who were immediately effected by the unhappy event. he assured them of
every accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the black knight
took his hand.

â€œi crave to remind you, noble thane,â€ he said, â€œthat when we last
parted, you promised, for the service i had the fortune to render you,
to grant me a boon.â€

â€œit is granted ere named, noble knight,â€ said cedric; â€œyet, at this sad
moment---â€

â€œof that also,â€ said the king, â€œi have bethought me--but my time is
brief--neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave on
the noble athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and
hasty

opinions.â€

â€œsir knight of the fetterlock,â€ said cedric, colouring, and interrupting
the king in his turn, â€œi trust your boon regards yourself and no other;
for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce fitting
that a stranger should mingle.â€

â€œnor do i wish to mingle,â€ said the king, mildly, â€œunless in so far as
you will admit me to have an interest. as yet you have known me but as
the black knight of the fetterlock--know me now as richard plantagenet.â€

â€œrichard of anjou!â€ exclaimed cedric, stepping backward with the utmost
astonishment.

â€œno, noble cedric--richard of england!--whose deepest interest--whose
deepest wish, is to see her sons united with each other.--and, how now,
worthy thane! hast thou no knee for thy prince?â€

â€œto norman blood,â€ said cedric, â€œit hath never bended.â€

â€œreserve thine homage then,â€ said the monarch, â€œuntil i shall prove my
right to it

â€œi will,â€ said the spectre, very composedly, â€œwhen i have collected

alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which
seem three ages--yes, bread and water, father cedric! by heaven, and all
saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong
days, and by godâ€™s providence it is that i am now here to tell it.â€

â€œwhy, noble athelstane,â€ said the black knight, â€œi myself saw you struck
down by the fierce templar towards the end of the storm at torquilstone,
and as i thought, and wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the
teeth.â€

â€œyou thought amiss, sir knight,â€ said athelstane, â€œand wamba lied. my
teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find--no

the blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good

obsequies be private, as becomes those of a man who died in an unjust
quarrel.--and for the maiden--â€

he was interrupted by a clattering of horsesâ€™ feet, advancing in such
numbers, and so rapidly, as to shake the ground before them; and the
black knight galloped into the lists. he was followed by a numerous band
of men-at-arms, and several knights in complete armour.

â€œi am too late,â€ he said, looking around him. â€œi had doomed
bois-guilbert for mine own property.--ivanhoe, was this well, to take on
thee such a venture, and thou scarce able to keep thy saddle?â€

â€œheaven, my liege,â€ answered ivanhoe, â€œhath taken this proud man for its
victim. he was not to be honoured in dying as your will had designed.â€

and hurrying his daughter in his turn, he conducted her from the lists,
and by means of conveyance which he had provided, transported her safely
to the house of the rabbi nathan.

the jewess, whose fortunes had formed the principal interest of the
day, having now retired unobserved, the attention of the populace was
transferred to the black knight. they now filled the air with â€œlong life
to richard with the lionâ€™s heart, and down with the usurping templars!â€

â€œnotwithstanding all this lip-loyalty,â€ said ivanhoe to the earl of
essex, â€œit was well the king took the precaution to bring thee with him,
noble earl, and so many of thy trusty followers.â€

the earl smiled and shook his head.

yet suspect him of taking so wise a precaution! i was drawing tow
