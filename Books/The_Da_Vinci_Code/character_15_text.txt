phone rang.

it was fache. "interpol got a tip," he said. "forget the train. langdon and neveu just walked into
the paris branch of the depository bank of zurich. i want your men over there right away."

"any leads yet on what sauniere was trying to tell agent neveu and robert langdon?"

fache's tone was cold. "if you arrest them, lieutenant collet, then i can ask them personally."

collet took the hint. "twenty-four rue haxo. right away, captain." he hung up and radioed his
men.



chapter 43

andre vernet — president of the paris branch of the depository bank of zurich — lived in a lavish
flat above the bank. despite his plush accommodations, he had always dreamed of owning a
riverside apartment on l'lle saint-louis, where he could rub shoulders with the true cognoscenti,
rather than here, where he simply met the filthy rich.

when i retire, vernet told himself, / will fill my cellar with rare bordeaux, adorn my salon with a

d indeed walked into his bank as reported, but because they
were not clients and had no account number, they were turned away. he wished the damned
watchman had not called interpol. discretion was apparently not part of the vocabulary of a 15-
euro-per-hour watchman.

stopping at the doorway, he took a deep breath and loosened his muscles. then, forcing a balmy
smile, he unlocked the door and swirled into the room like a warm breeze.

"good evening," he said, his eyes finding his clients. "i am andre vernet. how can i be of serv — "
the rest of the sentence lodged somewhere beneath his adam's apple. the woman before him was
as unexpected a visitor as vernet had ever had.



"i'm sorry, do we know each other?" sophie asked. she did not recognize the banker, but he for a
moment looked as if he'd seen a ghost.

"no...," the bank president fumbled. "i don't... believe so. our services are anonymous." he
exhaled and forced a calm smile. "my assistant tells me you have a gold key but no account

this key?"

"my grandfather gave it to me," sophie replied, watching the man closely. his uneasiness seemed
more evident now.



"really? your grandfather gave you the key but failed to give you the account number?"

"i don't think he had time," sophie said. "he was murdered tonight."

her words sent the man staggering backward. "jacques sauniere is dead?" he demanded, his eyes
filling with horror. "but... how?!"

now it was sophie who reeled, numb with shock. "you knew my grandfather?"

banker andre vernet looked equally astounded, steadying himself by leaning on an end table.
"jacques and i were dear friends. when did this happen?"

"earlier this evening. inside the louvre."

vernet walked to a deep leather chair and sank into it. "i need to ask you both a very important
question." he glanced up at langdon and then back to sophie. "did either of you have anything to
do with his death?"

"no!" sophie declared. "absolutely not."

vernet's face was grim, and he paused, pondering. "your pictures are

something unexpected happened. the box let out an odd gurgling sound.

langdon did a double take. there's liquid inside?

sophie looked equally confused. "did you just hear...?"

langdon nodded, lost. "liquid."

reaching forward, sophie slowly unhooked the clasp and raised the lid.

the object inside was unlike anything langdon had ever seen. one thing was immediately clear to
both of them, however. this was definitely not the cup of christ.



chapter 45

"the police are blocking the street," andre vernet said, walking into the waiting room. "getting
you out will be difficult." as he closed the door behind him, vernet saw the heavy-duty plastic
case on the conveyor belt and halted in his tracks. my god! they accessed sauniere's account?

sophie and langdon were at the table, huddling over what looked to be a large wooden jewelry
box. sophie immediately closed the lid and looked up. "we had the account number after all," she
said.

vernet was speechless. this changed everything. he respectfully d

. sophie shot langdon an
uneasy look, hastily closing the cryptex box and latching it. langdon slipped his jacket back on.

when the truck came to a stop, the engine remained idling as the locks on the rear doors began to
turn. when the doors swung open, langdon was surprised to see they were parked in a wooded
area, well off the road. vernet stepped into view, a strained look in his eye. in his hand, he held a
pistol.



'i'm sorry about this," he said. "i really have no choice.



chapter 49

andre vernet looked awkward with a pistol, but his eyes shone with a determination that langdon
sensed would be unwise to test.

"i'm afraid i must insist," vernet said, training the weapon on the two of them in the back of the
idling truck. "set the box down."

sophie clutched the box to her chest. "you said you and my grandfather were friends."

"i have a duty to protect your grandfather's assets," vernet replied. "and that is exactly what i am
doing. now set the box on the floor."

on or who was involved. the black audi outside had been rented in a false name with false credit
card numbers, and the prints in the car matched nothing in the interpol database.

another agent hurried into the living room, his eyes urgent. "where's captain fache?"

collet barely looked up from the burning embers. "he's on the phone."

"i'm off the phone," fache snapped, stalking into the room. "what have you got?"

the second agent said, "sir, central just heard from andre vernet at the depository bank of
zurich. he wants to talk to you privately. he is changing his story."



"oh?" fache said.

now collet looked up.

"vernet is admitting that langdon and neveu spent time inside his bank tonight."

"we figured that out," fache said. "why did vernet lie about it?"

"he said he'll talk only to you, but he's agreed to cooperate fully."

"in exchange for what?"



"for our keeping his bank's name out of the news and also for helping him recover some stolen
property. it soun

prieure de sion ? collet wondered.

"lieutenant?" another agent stuck his head in. "the switchboard has an urgent call for captain
fache, but they can't reach him. will you take it?"

collet returned to the kitchen and took the call.

it was andre vernet.

the banker's refined accent did little to mask the tension in his voice. "i thought captain fache said
he would call me, but i have not yet heard from him."

"the captain is quite busy," collet replied. "may i help you?"

"i was assured i would be kept abreast of your progress tonight."

for a moment, collet thought he recognized the timbre of the man's voice, but he couldn't quite
place it. "monsieur vernet, i am currently in charge of the paris investigation. my name is
lieutenant collet."

 understood why the banker had hung up so quickly. vernet had remembered the name
lieutenant collet — the officer he blatantly lied to earlier tonight.



collet pondered the implications of this bizarre development. vernet is involved. instinctively, he
knew he should call fache. emotionally, he knew this lucky break was going to be his moment to
shine.

he immediately called interpol and requested every shred of information they could find on the
depository bank of zurich and its president, andre vernet.



chapter 80

"seat belts, please," teabing's pilot announced as the hawker 731 descended into a gloomy
morning drizzle. "we'll be landing in five minutes."

teabing felt a joyous sense of homecoming when he saw the misty hills of kent spreading wide
beneath the descending plane. england was less than an hour from paris, and yet a world away.

silas was backing up now, keeping langdon and sophie at gunpoint as remy pulled leigh toward
the exit, his crutches dragging behind him.

sophie's voice was unwavering. "who are you working for?"

the question brought a smirk to the departing remy's face. "you would be surprised,
mademoiselle neveu."



chapter 87

the fireplace in chateau villette's drawing room was cold, but collet paced before it nonetheless
as he read the faxes from interpol.

not at all what he expected.

andre vernet, according to official records, was a model citizen. no police record — not even a
parking ticket. educated at prep school and the sorbonne, he had a cum laude degree in
international finance. interpol said vernet's name appeared in the newspapers from time to time,
but always in a positive light. apparently the man had helped design the security parameters that
kept the depository bank of zurich a leader in the ultramodern world of electronic security.

 said, motioning to langdon's hand.

"oh, thank you." langdon held out his empty coffee cup.

she stared at him. "i was referring to your other hand, mr. langdon."

langdon looked down and realized he was holding sauniere's papyrus. he had taken it from the
cryptex once again in hopes of seeing something he had missed earlier. "of course, i'm sorry."

marie looked amused as she took the paper. "i know of a man at a bank in paris who is probably
very eager to see the return of this rosewood box. andre vernet was a dear friend of jacques, and
jacques trusted him explicitly. andre would have done anything to honor jacques's requests for the
care of this box."



including shooting me, langdon recalled, deciding not to mention that he had probably broken the
poor man's nose. thinking of paris, langdon flashed on the three senechaux who had been killed
the night before. "and the priory? what happens now?"

"the wheels are already in motion, mr. langdon. the brotherhood has endured for centuries, and it
