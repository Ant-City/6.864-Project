[CHARACTER] - 
                giants
whom gulliver meets on his second voyage.
[CHARACTER] are basically a reasonable and kindly people governed
by a sense of justice. even the farmer who abuses gulliver at the
beginning is gentle with him, and politely takes the trouble to
say good-bye to him upon leaving him. the farmer's daughter, glumdalclitch,
gives gulliver perhaps the most kindhearted treatment he receives
on any of his voyages. the [CHARACTER] do not exploit him for personal
or political reasons, as the lilliputians do, and his life there
is one of satisfaction and quietude. but the [CHARACTER] do
treat gulliver as a plaything. when he tries to speak seriously
with the king of brobdingnag about england, the king dismisses the english
as odious vermin, showing that deep discussion is not possible for
gulliver here.
