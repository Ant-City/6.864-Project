margie--sure, he's aces. (rocky beams complacently and takes the glasses back to the bar. margie whispers) yuh sap, don't yuh know enough not to kid him on dat? serve yuh right if he beat yuh up!

pearl--(admiringly) jees, i'll bet he'd give yuh an awful beatin', too, once he started. ginnies got awful tempers.

margie--anyway, we wouldn't keep no pimp, like we was reg'lar old whores. we ain't dat bad.

pearl--no. we're tarts, but dat's all.

rocky--(rinsing glasses behind the bar) cora got back around three o'clock. she woke up chuck and dragged him outa de hay to go to a chop suey joint. (disgustedly) imagine him standin' for dat stuff!

margie--(disgustedly) i'll bet dey been sittin' around kiddin' demselves wid dat old pipe dream about gettin' married and settlin' down on a farm. jees, when chuck's on de wagon, dey never lay off dat dope! dey give yuh an earful every time yuh talk to 'em!

(then seriously) no, i wasn't either. but i didn't mean booze. i meant save you from pipe dreams. i know now, from my experience, they're the things that really poison and ruin a guy's life and keep him from finding any peace. if you knew how free and contented i feel now. i'm like a new man. and the cure for them is so damned simple, once you have the nerve. just the old dope o

cora--yuh can see dey're pretty, can't yuh, yuh big dummy?

willie--(stares at a bottle greedily, tempted for a moment--then bitterly) that's fine advice! i thought you were my friend!

(she begins to play through the chorus again. don parritt enters from the hall. there is a frightened look on his face. he slinks in furtively, as if he were escaping from someone. he looks relieved when he sees larry and comes and slips into the chair on his right. larry pretends not to notice his coming, but he instinctively shrinks wi

mcgloin--i'm telling you, ed, it's serious this time. that bastard, hickey, has got harry on the hip. (as he talks, margie, pearl, rocky and chuck prick up their ears and gather round. cora, at the piano, keeps running through the tune, with soft pedal, and singing the chorus half under her breath, with joe still correcting her mistakes. at the table, larry, parritt, willie, wetjoen and lewis sit motionless, staring in front of them. hugo seems asleep in his habitual position.) and you know it isn't going to do us no good if he gets him to take that walk tomorrow.

(with rising anger, to the others) and all you bums! what the hell you trying to do, yelling and raising the roof? want the cops to close the joint and get my license taken away?

pearl--it was hickey got it.
