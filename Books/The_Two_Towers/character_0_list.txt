Frodo, a lowly Hobbit, has accepted the tremendously dangerous task
of returning the Ring to the fires of Mordor in which it was created--the
only place where it can be destroyed. In the later stages of the
novel, the Ring becomes a difficult burden for Frodo, who relies
increasingly on his friend, Sam, 
for support.
