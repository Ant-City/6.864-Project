,” laughed the other, “that’s what they say.”

he did not look to be over twenty-two or three, though, as jurgis found
afterward, he was thirty. he spoke like a man of education, like what
the world calls a “gentleman.”

“is that what you’re here for?” jurgis inquired.

“no,” was the answer. “i’m here for disorderly conduct. they were mad
because they couldn’t get any evidence.

“what’s your name?” the young fellow continued after a pause. “my name’s
duane--jack duane. i’ve more than a dozen, but that’s my company one.”
 he seated himself on the floor with his back to the wall and his legs
crossed, and went on talking easily; he soon put jurgis on a friendly
footing--he was evidently a man of the world, used to getting on, and
not too proud to hold conversation with a mere laboring man. he drew
jurgis out, and heard all about his life all but the one unmentionable
thing; and then he told stories about his own life. he was a great
one for stories, not a

 struck hard. he was striking all the time--there was
war between him and society. he was a genial freebooter, living off the
enemy, without fear or shame. he was not always victorious, but then
defeat did not mean annihilation, and need not break his spirit.

withal he was a goodhearted fellow--too much so, it appeared. his story
came out, not in the first day, nor the second, but in the long hours
that dragged by, in which they had nothing to do but talk and nothing
to talk of but themselves. jack duane was from the east; he was a
college-bred man--had been studying electrical engineering. then his
father had met with misfortune in business and killed himself; and there
had been his mother and a younger brother and sister. also, there was an
invention of duane’s; jurgis could not understand it clearly, but it had
to do with telegraphing, and it was a very important thing--there were
fortunes in it, millions upon millions of dollars. and duane had been
robbed of it by a great company, and got

thoughts would take flight; and then the tears would come into his
eyes--and he would be called back by the jeering laughter of his
companions.

he spent a week in this company, and during all that time he had no word
from his home. he paid one of his fifteen cents for a postal card, and
his companion wrote a note to the family, telling them where he was
and when he would be tried. there came no answer to it, however, and at
last, the day before new year’s, jurgis bade good-by to jack duane. the
latter gave him his address, or rather the address of his mistress, and
made jurgis promise to look him up. “maybe i could help you out of a
hole some day,” he said, and added that he was sorry to have him go.
jurgis rode in the patrol wagon back to justice callahan’s court for
trial.

one of the first things he made out as he entered the room was teta
elzbieta and little kotrina, looking pale and frightened, seated far in
the rear. his heart began to pound, but he did not dare to tr

 months before to hustle out a record-breaking vote as
a testimonial to the magistrate, who had been made the target of odious
kid-gloved reformers.

jurgis was driven out to the bridewell for the second time. in his
tumbling around he had hurt his arm again, and so could not work, but
had to be attended by the physician. also his head and his eye had to
be tied up--and so he was a pretty-looking object when, the second
day after his arrival, he went out into the exercise court and
encountered--jack duane!

the young fellow was so glad to see jurgis that he almost hugged him.
“by god, if it isn’t ‘the stinker’!” he cried. “and what is it--have you
been through a sausage machine?”

“no,” said jurgis, “but i’ve been in a railroad wreck and a fight.” and
then, while some of the other prisoners gathered round he told his wild
story; most of them were incredulous, but duane knew that jurgis could
never have made up such a yarn as that.

“hard luck, old man,” he said, when

 were weaker, or
younger and inexperienced, gathered round and listened in admiring
silence. the last time he was there, jurgis had thought of little but
his family; but now he was free to listen to these men, and to realize
that he was one of them--that their point of view was his point of view,
and that the way they kept themselves alive in the world was the way he
meant to do it in the future.

and so, when he was turned out of prison again, without a penny in his
pocket, he went straight to jack duane. he went full of humility and
gratitude; for duane was a gentleman, and a man with a profession--and
it was remarkable that he should be willing to throw in his lot with a
humble workingman, one who had even been a beggar and a tramp. jurgis
could not see what help he could be to him; but he did not understand
that a man like himself--who could be trusted to stand by any one who
was kind to him--was as rare among criminals as among any other class of
men.

the address jurgis had was a garret ro

to a place just around the corner and offered herself, and they made her
give up her clothes before they would give her a bite to eat!”

marija sat for a minute or two, brooding somberly. “tell me about
yourself, jurgis,” she said, suddenly. “where have you been?”

so he told her the long story of his adventures since his flight from
home; his life as a tramp, and his work in the freight tunnels, and the
accident; and then of jack duane, and of his political career in the
stockyards, and his downfall and subsequent failures. marija listened
with sympathy; it was easy to believe the tale of his late starvation,
for his face showed it all. “you found me just in the nick of time,” she
said. “i’ll stand by you--i’ll help you till you can get some work.”

“i don’t like to let you--” he began.

“why not? because i’m here?”

“no, not that,” he said. “but i went off and left you--”

“nonsense!” said
