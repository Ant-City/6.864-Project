Richmond - 
                	A
member of a branch of the Lancaster royal family. Richmond gathers
a force of rebels to challenge Richard for the throne. He is meant
to represent goodness, justice, and fairness--all the things Richard does
not. Richmond is portrayed in such a glowing light in part because
he founded the Tudor dynasty, which still ruled England in Shakespeare's
day.
