the [CHARACTER] - 
                	the
old man known in the community as the receiver of memory. the [CHARACTER]
has held the community's collective memory for many years and uses
his wisdom to help the committee of elders make important decisions,
even though he is racked by the pain his memories give him and believes
that perhaps those memories belong in the minds of everyone in the community.
