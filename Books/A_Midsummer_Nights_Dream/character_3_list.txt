Lysander - 
                A
young man of Athens, in love with Hermia. Lysander's relationship
with Hermia invokes the theme of love's difficulty: he cannot marry
her openly because Egeus, her father, wishes her to wed Demetrius;
when Lysander and Hermia run away into the forest, Lysander becomes
the victim of misapplied magic and wakes up in love with Helena.
