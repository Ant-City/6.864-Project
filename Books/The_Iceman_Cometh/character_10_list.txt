Piet Wetjoen - 
      A huge Boer in his fifties whose once strapping frame has drowned in a blubbering mass of "flaccid tallow." He is Lewis's drinking partner and dreams of returning to South Africa, having left in disgrace for his cowardice during the Boer war. He is distinguished by his comic accent.
