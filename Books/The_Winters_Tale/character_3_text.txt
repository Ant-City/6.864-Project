hearts fresh: they that went on crutches ere he was born desire

camillo.
yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to
live.

archidamus.
if the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches
till he had one.

without a burden: time as long again

yet standing in rich place, i multiply
with one we-thank-you many thousands more

i am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
or breed upon our absence; that may blow
no sneaping winds at home, to make us say,
'this is put forth too truly.' besides, i have stay'd
to tire your royalty.

we were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun

was innocence for innocence; we knew not
the doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd

and our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
with stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
boldly 'not guilty,' the imposition clear'd

three crabb√®d months had sour'd themselves to death,

'i am yours for ever.'

hermione.
                       it is grace indeed.

of thousands that had struck anointed kings
and flourish'd after, i'd not do't; but since
nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one,

i will prove so, sir, to my power.

clown.
ay, by any means, prove a tall fellow: if i do not wonder how
thou darest venture to be drunk, not being a tall fellow, trust
me not.--hark! the kings and the princes, our kindred, are going
to see the queen's picture. come, follow us: we'll be thy good
masters.

scene iii. the same. a room in paulina's house.

[enter leontes, polixenes, florizel, perdita, camillo, paulina,
lords and attendants.]

leontes.
o grave and good paulina, the great comfort
that i have had of thee!

paulina.
                         what, sovereign sir,
i did not well, i meant well. all my services
you have paid home: but that you have vouchsaf'd,
with your crown'd brother and these your contracted
heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
it is a surplus of your grace which never
my life may last to answer.

leontes.

i like your silence,--it the more shows off
your wonder: but yet speak;--first, you, my liege.
comes it not something near?

leontes.
                             her natural posture!--
chide me, dear stone, that i may say indeed
thou art hermione; or rather, thou art she
in thy not chiding; for she was as tender
as infancy and grace.--but yet, paulina,
hermione was not so much wrinkled; nothing
so ag√®d, as this seems.

polixenes.
                        o, not by much!

paulina.
so much the more our carver's excellence;
which lets go by some sixteen years, and makes her
as she liv'd now.

leontes.
                  as now she might have done,
so much to my good comfort, as it is
now piercing to my soul. o, thus she stood,
even with such life of majesty,--warm life,
as now it coldly stands,--when first i woo'd her!
i am asham'd: does not the stone rebuke me
for being more stone than it?--o royal piece,

and do not say 'tis superstition, that
i kneel, and then implore her blessing.--lady,
dear queen, that ended when i but began,
give me that hand of yours to kiss.

paulina.
                                    o, patience!
the statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's
not dry.

camillo.
my lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
so many summers dry; scarce any joy
did ever so long live; no sorrow
but kill'd itself much sooner.

polixenes.
                               dear my brother,
let him that was the cause of this have power
to take off so much grief from you as he
will piece up in himself.

paulina.
                          indeed, my lord,
if i had thought the sight of my poor image
would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine,--
i'd not have show'd it.

leontes.
                        do not draw the curtain.

paulina.
no longer shall you gaze on't; lest your fancy
may think anon it moves.

the fixture of her eye has motion in't,
as we are mock'd with art.

                           i'll draw the curtain:
my lord's almost so far transported that
he'll think anon it lives.

                           o sweet paulina,
make me to think so twenty years together!
no settled senses of the world can match
the pleasure of that madness. let't alone.
