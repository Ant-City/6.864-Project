     midnight.

     strepsiades (sitting up in his bed). ah me! ah me! o
     king jupiter, of what a terrible length the nights are!
     will it never be day? and yet long since i heard the
     cock. my domestics are snoring; but they would not have
     done so heretofore! may you perish then, o war! for many

 persuade people
     that it is an oven, and that it encompasses us, and that
     we are the embers. these men teach, if one give them
     money, to conquer in speaking, right or wrong.

     phid. who are they?

     strep. i do not know the name accurately. they are
     minute philosophers, noble and excellent.

     phid. bah! they are rogues; i know them. you mean the
     quacks, the pale-faced wretches, the bare-footed
     fellows, of whose numbers are the miserable socrates and
     chaerephon.

     strep. hold! hold! be silent! do not say anything
     foolish. but, if you have any concern for your father's
     patrimony, become one of them, having given up your
     horsemanship.

     phid. i would not, by bacchus, even if you were to give
     me the pheasants which leogoras  rears!

     strep. go, i entreat you, dearest of men, go and be
     taught.

     phid. why, what shall i learn?

     strep. they say that among them are both the two
     causes--the better cause, whic

   against the door so very carelessly, and have caused the
     miscarriage of an idea which i had conceived.

     strep. pardon me; for i dwell afar in the country. but
     tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry.

     dis. it is not lawful to mention it, except to
     disciples.

     strep. tell it, then, to me without fear; for i here am
     come as a disciple to the thinking-shop.

     dis. i will tell you; but you must regard these as
     mysteries. socrates lately asked chaerephon  about a
     flea, how many of its own feet it jumped; for after
     having bit the eyebrow of chaerephon, it leaped away
     onto the head of socrates.

     strep. how then did he measure this?

     dis. most cleverly. he melted some wax; and then took
     the flea and dipped its feet in the wax; and then a pair
     of persian slippers stuck to it when cooled. having
     gently loosened these, he measured back the distance.

     strep. o king jupiter! what subtlety of thought!

is. what then would you say if you heard another
     contrivance of socrates?

     strep. of what kind? tell me, i beseech you!

     dis. chaerephon the sphettian asked him whether he
     thought gnats buzzed through the mouth or the breech.

     strep. what, then, did he say about the gnat?

     dis. he said the intestine of the gnat was narrow and
     that the wind went forcibly through it, being slender,
     straight to the breech; and then that the rump, being
     hollow where it is adjacent to the narrow part,
     resounded through the violence of the wind.

     strep. the rump of the gnats then is a trumpet! oh,
     thrice ha

le, i call witnesses to prove it; then
     again, after a short interval, i go to law.

     soc. come, then, lay down your cloak.

     strep. have i done any wrong?

     soc. no; but it is the rule to enter naked.

     strep. but i do not enter to search for stolen goods.

     soc. lay it down. why do you talk nonsense?

     strep. now tell me this, pray. if i be diligent and
     learn zealously, to which of your disciples shall i
     become like?

     soc. you will no way differ from chaerephon in
     intellect.

     strep. ah me, unhappy! i shall become half-dead.

     soc. don't chatter; but quickly follow me hither with
     smartness.

     strep. then give me first into my hands a honeyed cake;
     for i am afraid of descending within, as if into the
     cave of trophonius.

     soc. proceed; why do you keep poking about the door?

     [exeunt socrates and strepsiades]

     cho. well, go in peace, for the sake of this your
     valour. may prosperity attend the man, becau

     which you will be a man. but see that you do not teach
     this to any one.

     phid. well, what is it?

     strep. you swore now by jupiter.

     phid. i did.

     strep. seest thou, then, how good a thing is learning?
     there is no jupiter, o phidippides!

     phid. who then?

     strep. vortex reigns, having expelled jupiter.

     phid. bah! why do you talk foolishly?

     strep. be assured that it is so.

     phid. who says this?

     strep. socrates the melian, and chaerephon, who knows
     the footmarks of fleas.

     phid. have you arrived at such a pitch of frenzy that
     you believe madmen?

     strep. speak words of good omen, and say nothing bad of
     clever men and wise; of whom, through frugality, none
     ever shaved or anointed himself, or went to a bath to
     wash himself; while you squander my property in bathing,
     as if i were already dead. but go as quickly as possible
     and learn instead of me.

     phid. what good could any one lear

    strep. why, pray, did you not tell me this, then, but
     excited with hopes a rustic and aged man?

     cho. we always do this to him whom we perceive to be a
     lover of wicked courses, until we precipitate him into
     misfortune, so that he may learn to fear the gods.

     strep. ah me! it is severe, o clouds! but it is just;
     for i ought not to have withheld the money which i
     borrowed. now, therefore, come with me, my dearest son,
     that you may destroy the blackguard chaerephon and
     socrates, who deceived you and me.

     phid. i will not injure my teachers.

     strep. yes, yes, reverence paternal jove.

     phid. "paternal jove" quoth'a! how antiquated you are!
     why, is there any jove?

     strep. there is.

     phid. there is not, no; for vortex reigns having
     expelled jupiter.

     strep. he has not expelled him; but i fancied this, on
     account of this vortex here. ah me, unhappy man! when i
     even took you who are of earthenware for a god
