rtensio. tarry, petruchio, i must go with thee,
    for in baptista's keep my treasure is.
    he hath the jewel of my life in hold,
    his youngest daughter, beautiful bianca;
    and her withholds from me, and other more,
    suitors to her and rivals in my love;
    supposing it a thing impossible-
    for those defects i have before rehears'd-
    that ever katherina will be woo'd.
    therefore this order hath baptista ta'en,
    that none shall have access unto bianca
    till katherine the curst have got a husband.
  grumio. katherine the curst!
    a title for a maid of all titles the worst.
  hortensio. now shall my friend petruchio do me grace,
    and offer me disguis'd in sober robes
    to old baptista as a schoolmaster
    well seen in music, to instruct bianca;
    that so i may by this device at least
    have leave and leisure to make love to her,
    and unsuspected court her by herself.

        enter gremio with lucentio disguised as cambio

    so shall i no whit be behind in duty
    to fair bianca, so beloved of me.
  gremio. beloved of me- and that my deeds shall prove.
  grumio. and that his bags shall prove.
  hortensio. gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love.
    listen to me, and if you speak me fair
    i'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
    here is a gentleman whom by chance i met,
    upon agreement from us to his liking,
    will undertake to woo curst katherine;
    yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
  gremio. so said, so done, is well.
    hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
  petruchio. i know she is an irksome brawling scold;
    if that be all, masters, i hear no harm.
  gremio. no, say'st me so, friend? what countryman?
  petruchio. born in verona, old antonio's son.
    my father dead, my fortune lives for me;
    and i do hope good days and long to see.
  gremio. o sir, such a life with such a wife were strange!

    his name is licio, born in mantua.
  baptista. y'are welcome, sir, and he for your good sake;
    but for my daughter katherine, this i know,
    she is not for your turn, the more my grief.
  petruchio. i see you do not mean to part with her;
    or else you like not of my company.
  baptista. mistake me not; i speak but as i find.
    whence are you, sir? what may i call your name?
  petruchio. petruchio is my name, antonio's son,
    a man well known throughout all italy.
  baptista. i know him well; you are welcome for his sake.

    if she do bid me pack, i'll give her thanks,

    when i shall ask the banns, and when be married.
    but here she comes; and now, petruchio, speak.

    good morrow, kate- for that's your name, i hear.
  katherina. well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
    they call me katherine that do talk of me.
  petruchio. you lie, in faith, for you are call'd plain kate,
    and bonny kate, and sometimes kate the curst;
    but, kate, the prettiest kate in christendom,
    kate of kate hall, my super-dainty kate,
    for dainties are all kates, and therefore, kate,
    take this of me, kate of my consolation-
    hearing thy mildness prais'd in every town,
    thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
    yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
    myself am mov'd to

  petruchio. did ever dian so become a grove
    as kate this chamber with her princely gait?
    o, be thou dian, and let her be kate;
    and then let kate be chaste, and dian sportful!
  katherina. where did you study all this goodly speech?
  petruchio. it is extempore, from my mother wit.
  katherina. a witty mother! witless else her son.
  petruchio. am i not wise?
  katherina. yes, keep you warm.
  petruchio. marry, so i mean, sweet katherine, in thy bed.
    and therefore, setting all this chat aside,
    thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
    that you shall be my wife your dowry greed on;
    and will you, nill you, i will marry you.
    now, kate, i am a husband for your turn;
    for, by this light, whereby i see thy beauty,
    thy beauty that doth make me like thee well,
    thou must be married to no man but me;

  baptista. now, signior petruchio, how speed you with my
daughter?
  petruchio. how but well, sir? how but well?
    it were impossible i should speed amiss.
  baptista. why, how now, daughter katherine, in your dumps?
  katherina. call you me daughter? now i promise you
    you have show'd a tender fatherly regard

    o, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,

    by your firm promise; gremio is out-vied.
  baptista. i must confess your offer is the best;
    and let your father make her the assurance,
    she is your own. else, you must pardon me;
    if you should die before him, where's her dower?
  tranio. that's but a cavil; he is old, i young.
  gremio. and may not young men die as well as old?
  baptista. well, gentlemen,
    i am thus resolv'd: on sunday next you know
    my daughter katherine is to be married;
    now, on the sunday following shall bianca
    be bride to you, if you make this assurance;
    if not, to signior gremio.

  baptista.  [to tranio]  signior lucentio, this is the 'pointed
day
    that katherine and petruchio should be married,
    and yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
    what will be said? what mockery will it be
    to want the bridegroom when the priest attends
    to speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
    what says lucentio to this shame of ours?
  katherina. no shame but mine; i must, forsooth, be forc'd
    to give my hand, oppos'd against my heart,
    unto a mad-brain rudesby, full of spleen,
    who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.

    and, to be noted for a merry man,
    he'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
    make friends invited, and proclaim the banns;
    yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
    now must the world point at poor katherine,
    and say 'lo, there is mad petruchio's wife,
    if it would please him come and marry her!'
  tranio. patience, good katherine, and baptista too.
    upon my life, petruchio means but well,
    whatever fortune stays him from his word.
    though he be blunt, i know him passing wise;
    though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
  katherina. would katherine had never seen him though!

    for such an injury would vex a very saint;
    much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.

  gremio. a bridegroom, say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
    a grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
  tranio. curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
  gremio. why, he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
  tranio. why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
  gremio. tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool, to him!
    i'll tell you, sir lucentio: when the priest
    should ask if katherine should be his wife,
    'ay, by gogs-wouns' quoth he, and swore so loud
    that, all amaz'd, the priest let fall the book;
    and as he stoop'd again to take it up,
    this mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
    that down fell priest and book, and book and priest.
    'now take them up,' quoth he 'if any list.'
  tranio. what said the wench, when he rose again?
  gremio. trembled and shook, for why he stamp'd and swore
    as if the vicar meant to cozen him.
