[CHARACTER]  - 
      will is jim's best friend, and at the beginning of the book he is much more of a thinker than his friend, who favors action. but as the story unfolds will finds that, much like charles halloway, he is capable of quick and decisive action once he has made a critical decision. he saves jim several times and saves his father another time because, although he is only a thirteen year old boy, he is certain of his knowledge and believes that he is doing the right thing. will cares deeply about doing what is right, and, unlike jim, he favors inaction when the alternative is harmful or destructive. will is selfless, and he runs tremendous risks to save jim even when jim himself does not necessarily want to be saved.
