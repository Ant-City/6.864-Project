a man of far greater lineage and power, though he is not called a king. but he will speak most to you, and question you much, since you can tell him of his son boromir. he loved him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. but under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you rather than from me. do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of frodo’s errand. i will deal with that in due time. and say nothing about aragorn either, unless you must.’
‘why not? what is wrong with strider?’ pippin whispered. ‘he meant to come here, didn’t he? and he’ll be arriving soon himself anyway.’
‘maybe, maybe,’ said gandalf. ‘though if he comes, it is likely to be in some way that no one expects, not even denethor. it will be better so. at least he should come unheralded by us.’
gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. ‘see, master pippin, there is no time to instruct you now in the history

 was a white rod with a golden knob. he did not look up. solemnly they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his footstool. then gandalf spoke.
‘hail, lord and steward of minas tirith, denethor son of ecthelion! i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.’
then the old man looked up. pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of boromir as of aragorn. ‘dark indeed is the hour,’ said the old man, ‘and at such times you are wont to come, mithrandir. but though all the signs forebode that the doom of gondor is drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness. it has been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. is this he?’
‘it is,’ said gandalf. ‘one of the twain. the other is with théoden of rohan and may come hereafter. halflings they are, as you see, yet this is not he of whom the omens sp

arn of you also. for never before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in any tale that we know. moreover you are a friend of mithrandir. do you know him well?’
‘well,’ said pippin. ‘i have known of him all my short life, as you might say; and lately i have travelled far with him. but there is much to read in that book, and i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few. aragorn was the only one of our company, i think, who really knew him.’
‘aragorn?’ said beregond. ‘who is he?’
‘oh,’ stammered pippin, ‘he was a man who went about with us. i think he is in rohan now.’
‘you have been in rohan, i hear. there is much that i would ask you of that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. but i am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. what would you know, master peregrin?’

‘but the night will be too short,’ said gandalf. ‘i have come back here, for i must have a little peace, alone. you should sleep, in a bed while you still may. at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again. no, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. the darkness has begun. there will be no dawn.’

chapter 2

the passing of the grey company

gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night, when merry came back to aragorn. he had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at parth galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard. hasufel was already saddled. legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by.
‘so four of the company still remain,’ said aragorn. ‘we will ride on together. but we shall not go alone, as i thought. the king is now determined to set out at once. since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the hills under cover of

 night.’
‘and then whither?’ said legolas.
‘i cannot say yet,’ aragorn answered. ‘as for the king, he will go to the muster that he commanded at edoras, four nights from now. and there, i think, he will hear tidings of war, and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith. but for myself, and any that will go with me . . .’
‘i for one!’ cried legolas. ‘and gimli with him!’ said the dwarf.
‘well, for myself,’ said aragorn, ‘it is dark before me. i must go down also to minas tirith, but i do not yet see the road. an hour long prepared approaches.’
‘don’t leave me behind!’ said merry. ‘i have not been of much use yet; but i don’t want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. i don’t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now. though, of course, the king did say that i was to sit by him when he came to his house and tell him all about the shire.’
‘yes,’ said

 aragorn, ‘and your road lies with him, i think, merry. but do not look for mirth at the ending. it will be long, i fear, ere théoden sits at ease again in meduseld. many hopes will wither in this bitter spring.’
soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with gimli behind legolas, and merry in front of aragorn. presently they were riding swiftly through the night. they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen, when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line.
‘my lord,’ he said to the king, ‘there are horsemen behind us. as we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them. now we are sure. they are overtaking us, riding hard.’
théoden at once called a halt. the riders turned about and seized their spears. aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground, and drawing his sword he

ed their weapons. at ten paces the man stopped. he was tall, a dark standing shadow. then his clear voice rang out.
‘rohan? rohan did you say? that is a glad word. we seek that land in haste from long afar.’
‘you have found it,’ said éomer. ‘when you crossed the fords yonder you entered it. but it is the realm of théoden the king. none ride here save by his leave. who are you? and what is your haste?’
‘halbarad dúnadan, ranger of the north i am,’ cried the man. ‘we seek one aragorn son of arathorn, and we heard that he was in rohan.’
‘and you have found him also!’ cried aragorn. giving his reins to merry, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. ‘halbarad!’ he said. ‘of all joys this is the least expected!’
merry breathed a sigh of relief. he had thought that this was some last trick of saruman’s, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in théoden’s defence, not yet at any rate. he shea

thed his sword.
‘all is well,’ said aragorn, turning back. ‘here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt. but why they come, and how many they be, halbarad shall tell us.’
‘i have thirty with me,’ said halbarad. ‘that is all of our kindred that could be gathered in haste; but the brethren elladan and elrohir have ridden with us, desiring to go to the war. we rode as swiftly as we might when your summons came.’
‘but i did not summon you,’ said aragorn, ‘save only in wish. my thoughts have often turned to you, and seldom more than tonight; yet i have sent no word. but come! all such matters must wait. you find us riding in haste and danger. ride with us now, if the king will give his leave.’
théoden was indeed glad of the news. ‘it is well!’ he said. ‘if these kinsmen be in any way like to yourself, my lord aragorn, thirty such knights will be a strength that cannot be counted by heads.’
then the riders set out again, and aragorn

 for a while rode with the dúnedain; and when they had spoken of tidings in the north and in the south, elrohir said to him:
‘i bring word to you from my father: the days are short. if thou art in haste, remember the paths of the dead.’
‘always my days have seemed to me too short to achieve my desire,’ answered aragorn. ‘but great indeed will be my haste ere i take that road.’
‘that will soon be seen,’ said elrohir. ‘but let us speak no more of these things upon the open road!’
and aragorn said to halbarad: ‘what is that that you bear, kinsman?’ for he saw that instead of a spear he bore a tall staff, as it were a standard, but it was close-furled in a black cloth bound about with many thongs.
‘it is a gift that i bring you from the lady of rivendell,’ answered halbarad. ‘she wrought it

in secret, and long was the making. but she also sends word to you: the days now are short. either our hope cometh, or all hopes end. therefore i send thee what i have made for thee. fare well, elfstone!’
and aragorn said: ‘now i know what you bear. bear it still for me a while!’ and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars, and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night’s journey lasted.
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from deeping-coomb and came back to the hornburg. there they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel.
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli. ‘the sun is high,’ said legolas. ‘all others ar

aid the elf. ‘do not spoil the wonder with haste! i have given you my word to return hither with you, if a day of peace and freedom comes again. but it is now near to noon, and at that hour we eat, and then set out again, i hear.’
merry got up and yawned. his few hours’ sleep had not been nearly enough; he was tired and rather dismal. he missed pippin, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand. ‘where is aragorn?’ he asked.
‘in a high chamber of the burg,’ said legolas. ‘he has neither rested nor slept, i think. he went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take thought, and only his kinsman, halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.’
‘they are a strange company, these newcomers,’ said gimli. ‘stout men and lordly they are, and the riders of rohan look almost as boys beside them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, ev

en as aragorn himself; and they are silent.’
‘but even as aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.’ said legolas. ‘and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir? less sombre is their gear than the others’, and they are fair and gallant as elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell.’
‘why have they come? have you heard?’ asked merry. he had now dressed, and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out together towards the ruined gate of the burg.
‘they answered

 a summons, as you heard,’ said gimli. ‘word came to rivendell, they say: aragorn has need of his kindred. let the dúnedain ride to him in rohan! but whence this message came they are now in doubt. gandalf sent it, i would guess.’
‘nay, galadriel,’ said legolas. ‘did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of the grey company from the north?’
‘yes, you have it,’ said gimli. ‘the lady of the wood! she read many hearts and desires. now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk, legolas?’
legolas stood before the gate and turned his bright eyes away

 king; and laying his long old hands upon the brown hair of the hobbit; he blessed him. ‘rise now, meriadoc, esquire of rohan of the household of meduseld!’ he said. ‘take your sword and bear it unto good fortune!’
‘as a father you shall be to me,’ said merry.
‘for a little while,’ said théoden.
they talked then together as they ate, until presently éomer spoke. ‘it is near the hour that we set for our going, lord,’ he said. ‘shall i bid men sound the horns? but where is aragorn? his place is empty and he has not eaten.’
‘we will make ready to ride,’ said théoden; ‘but let word be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh.’
the king with his guard and merry at his side passed down from the gate of the burg to where the riders were assembling on the green. many were already mounted. it would be a great company; for the king was leaving only a small garrison in the burg, and all who could be spared were riding to the weapontake at edoras. a thousand spear

s had indeed already ridden away at night; but still there would be some five hundred more to go with the king, for the most part men from the fields and dales of westfold.
a little apart the rangers sat, silent, in an ordered company, armed with spear and bow and sword. they were clad in cloaks of dark grey, and their hoods were cast now over helm and head. their horses were strong and of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there without a rider, aragorn’s own horse that they had brought from the north; roheryn was his name. there was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness: nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star.
the king mounted his horse, snowmane, and merry sat beside him on his pony: stybba was his name. presently éomer came out from the gate, and with him was aragorn, and halbarad bearing

 the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old so much alike were they, the sons of elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. behind them walked legolas and gimli. but merry had eyes only for aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head. grim was his face, grey-hued and weary.
‘i am troubled in mind, lord,’ he said, standing by the king’s horse. ‘i have heard strange words, and i see new perils far off. i have laboured long in thought, and now i fear that i must change my purpose. tell me, théoden, you ride now to dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?’
‘it is now a full hour past noon,’ said éomer.

 ‘before the night of the third day from now we should come to the hold. the moon will then be one night past his full, and the muster that the king commanded will be held the day after. more speed we cannot make, if the strength of rohan is to be gathered.’
aragorn was silent for a moment. ‘three days,’ he murmured, ‘and the muster of rohan will only be begun. but i see that it cannot now be hastened.’ he looked up, and it seemed that he had made some decision; his face was less troubled. then, by our leave, lord, i must take new counsel for myself and my kindred. we must ride our own road, and no longer in secret. for me the time of stealth has passed. i will ride east by the swiftest way, and i will take the paths of the dead.’
‘the paths of
 
 ___________________________
 
 the dead!’ said théoden, and trembled. ‘why do you speak of them?’ éomer turned and gazed at aragorn, and it seemed to merry that the faces of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. ‘if there be in truth such paths,’ said théoden, ‘their gate is in dunharrow; but no living man may pass it.’
‘alas! aragorn my friend!’ said éomer. ‘i had hoped that we should ride to war together; but if you seek the paths of the dead, then our parting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the sun.’
‘that road i will take, nonetheless,’ said aragorn. ‘but i say to you, éomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of mordor should stand between.’
‘you will do as you will, my lord aragorn,’ said théoden. ‘it is your doom, maybe, to tread stran

ge paths that others dare not. this parting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now i must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer. farewell!’
‘farewell, lord!’ said aragorn. ‘ride unto great renown! farewell, merry! i leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn. legolas and gimli will still hunt with me, i hope; but we shall not forget you.’
‘good-bye!’ said merry. he could find no more to say. he felt very small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin. the riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start

arid get it over.
now théoden spoke to éomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word the riders set forth. they rode over the dike and down the coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view. aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the king’s men were far down the coomb. then he turned to halbarad.
‘there go three that i love, and the smallest not the least,’ he said. ‘he knows not to what end he rides; yet if he knew, he still would go on.’
‘a little people, but of great worth are the shire-folk,’ said halbarad. ‘little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet i grudge it not.’
‘and now our fates are woven together,’ said aragorn

. ‘and yet, alas! here we must part. well, i must eat a little, and then we also must hasten away. come, legolas and gimli! i must speak with you as i eat.’
together they went back into the burg; yet for some time aragorn sat silent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to speak. ‘come!’ said legolas at last. ‘speak and be comforted, and shake off the shadow! what has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey morning?’
‘a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the hornburg,’ answered aragorn. ‘i have looked in the stone of orthanc, my friends.’
‘you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry!’ exclaimed gimli with fear and astonishment

in his face. ‘did you say aught to - him? even gandalf feared that encounter.’
‘you forget to whom you speak,’ said aragorn sternly, and his eyes glinted. ‘did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors of edoras? what do you fear that i should say to him? nay, gimli,’ he said in a softer voice, and the grimness left his face, and he looked like one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights. ‘nay, my friends, i and the lawful master of the stone, and i had both the right and the strength to use it, or so i judged. the right cannot be doubted. the strength was enough - barely.’
he drew a deep br

t not till now. the eyes in orthanc did not see through the armour of théoden; but sauron has not forgotten isildur and the sword of elendil. now in the very hour of his great designs the heir of isildur and the sword are revealed; for l showed the blade re-forged to him. he is not so mighty yet that he is above fear; nay, doubt ever gnaws him.’
‘but he wields great dominion, nonetheless,’ said gimli; ‘and now he will strike more swiftly.’
‘the hasty stroke goes oft astray,’ said aragorn. ‘we must press our enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. see my friends, when i had mastered the stone, i learned many things. a grave peril i saw coming unlooked-for upon gondor from the south that will draw off great strength from the defence of minas tirith. if it is not countered swiftly, i deem that the city will be lost ere ten days be gone.’
‘then lost it must be,’ said gimli. ‘for what help is there to send thither, and how could it come there in time?’
‘i have

 no help to send, therefore i must go myself,’ said aragorn. ‘but there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the coastlands before all is lost. that is the paths of the dead.’
‘the paths of the dead!’ said gimli. ‘it is a fell name; and little to the liking to the men of rohan, as i saw. can the living use such a road and not perish? and even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter the strokes of mordor?’
‘the living have never used that road since the coming of the rohirrim,’ said aragorn, ‘for i

t is closed to them. but in this dark hour the heir of isildur may use it, if he dare. listen! this is the word that the sons of elrond bring to me from their father in rivendell, wisest in lore: bid aragorn remember the words of the seer, and the paths of the dead.’
‘and what may be the words of the seer?’ said legolas.
“thus spoke malbeth the seer, in the days of arvedui, last king at fornost,’ said aragorn:
over the land there lies a long shadow,
westward reaching wings of darkness.
the tower trembles; to the tombs of kings
doom approaches. the dead awaken;
for the hour is come for the oathbreakers;
at the stone of erech they shall stand again
and hear there a horn in the hills ringing.
whose shall the horn be? who shall call them
from the prey twilight, the forgotten people?
the heir of him to whom the oath they swore.
from the north shall he come, need shall drive him:
he shall pass the door to

 the paths of the dead.
‘dark ways doubtless, said gimli, but no darker than these staves are to me.’
‘if you would understand them better, then i bid you come with me,’ said aragorn; ‘for that way i now shall take. but i do not go gladly; only need drives me. therefore, only of your free will would i have you come, for you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.’
‘i will go with you even on the paths of the dead, and to whatever, end they may lead,’ said gimli.
‘i also will come,’ said legolas, ‘for i do not fear the dead.’
‘i hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight,’ said gimli; ‘for otherwise i see not why we

 should trouble them.’
‘that we shall know if ever we come to erech,’ said aragorn. ‘but the oath that they broke was to fight against sauron, and they must fight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought, it was said, from númenor by isildur; and it was set upon a hill, and upon it the king of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of gondor. but when sauron returned and grew in might again, isildur summoned the men of the mountains to fulfil their oath, and they would not: for they had w

s and had no dealings with other men, but slowly dwindled in the barren hills. and the terror of the sleepless dead lies about the hill of erech and all places where that people lingered. but that way i must go, since there are none living to help me.’
he stood up. ‘come!’ he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed in the twilit hall of the burg. ‘to the stone of erech! i seek the paths of the dead. come with me who will!’
legolas and gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed aragorn from the hall. on the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded rangers. legolas and gimli mounted. aragorn sprang upon roheryn. then halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in helm’s deep; and with that they leapt away, riding down the coomb like thunder, while all the men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze.
and while théoden went by slow paths in the hills, the grey company passed swiftly over the plain, and on the next day in the afternoon they came to

edoras; and there they halted only briefly, ere they passed up the valley, and so came to dunharrow as darkness fell.
the lady éowyn greeted them and was glad of their coming; for no mightier men had she seen than the dúnedain and the fair sons of elrond; but on aragorn most of all her eyes rested. and when they sat at supper with her, they talked together, and she heard of all that had passed since théoden rode away, concerning which only hasty tidings had yet reached her; and when she heard of the battle in helm’s deep and the great slaughter of their foes, and of the charge of théoden and his knights, then her eyes shone.
but at last she said: ‘lords, you are weary and shall now go to your beds with such ease as can be contrived in haste. but tomorrow
 
 ___________________________
 
 fairer housing shall be found for you.’
but aragorn said: ‘nay, lady, be not troubled for us! if we may lie here tonight and break our fast tomorrow, it will be enough. for i ride on an errand most urgent, and with the first light of morning we must go.’
she smiled on him and said: ‘then it was kindly done, lord, to ride so many miles out of your way to bring tidings to éowyn, and to speak with her in her exile.’
‘indeed no man would count such a journey wasted,’ said aragorn; ‘and yet, lady, i could not have come hither, if it were not that the road which i must take leads me to dunharrow.’
and she answered as one that likes not what is said: “then, lord, you are astray; for out of harrowdale no road runs east or south; and you had best return as you came.’
‘nay, lady,’ said he, ‘i am not astray; for i walked in this land ere you were born to grace it. there is a road out of this valley, and that road i shall take. tomorrow i shall ride by the paths o

f the dead.’
then she stared at him as one that is stricken, and her face blanched, and for long she spoke no more, while all sat silent. ‘but, aragorn,’ she said at last, ‘is it then your errand to seek death? for that is all that you will find on that road. they do not suffer the living to pass.’
‘they may suffer me to pass,’ said aragorn; ‘but at the least i will adventure it. no other road will serve.’
‘but this is madness,’ she said. ‘for here are men of renown and prowess, whom you should not take into the shadows, but should lead to war, where men are needed. i beg you to remain and ride with my brother; for then all our hearts will be gladdened, and our hope be the brighter.’
‘it is not madness, lady,’ he answered; ‘for i go on a path appointed. but those who follow me do so of their free will; and if the

y wish now to remain and ride with the rohirrim, they may do so. but i shall take the paths of the dead, alone, if needs be.’
then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. at length they arose, and took their leave of the lady, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest.
but as aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and gimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the lady éowyn after him and called to him. he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire.
‘aragorn,’ she said, ‘why will you go on this deadly road?’
‘because i must,’ he said. ‘only so can i see any hope of doing my part in the war against sauron. i do not choose paths of peril, éowyn. were i to go where my heart dwe

rd may win renown and victory. i would not see a thing that is high and excellent cast away needlessly.’
‘nor would i,’ he said. ‘therefore i say to you, lady: stay! for you have no errand to the south.’
‘neither have those others who go with thee. they go only because they would not be parted from thee - because they love thee.’ then she turned and vanished into the night.
when the light of day was come into the sky but the sun was not yet risen above the high ridges in the east, aragorn made ready to depart. his company was all mounted, and he was about to leap into the saddle, when the lady éowyn came to bid them farewell. she was clad as a rider and girt with a sword. in her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to aragorn, and he drank, and he said: ‘farewell, lady of rohan! i drink to the fortunes of your house, and of you, and of all your people. say to your brother: beyond the shadows we

may meet again!’
then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were nearby that she wept, and in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous. but she said: ‘aragorn, wilt thou go?’
‘i will,’ he said.
‘then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as i have asked?’
‘i will not, lady,’ he said. ‘for that i could not grant without leave of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until tomorrow. but i count now every hour, indeed every minute. farewell!’
then she fell on her knees, saying: ‘i beg thee!’
‘nay, lady,’ he said, and taking her by the hand he raised her. then he kissed her hand, and sprang into the saddl

h of night. signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour.
the company halted, and there was not a heart among them that did not quail, unless it were the heart of legolas of the elves, for whom the ghosts of men have no terror.
‘this is an evil door,’ said halbarad, ‘and my death lies beyond it. i will dare to pass it nonetheless; but no horse will enter.’
‘but we must go in, and therefore the horses must go too,’ said aragorn. ‘for if ever we come through this darkness, many leagues lie beyond, and every hour that is lost there will bring the triumph of sauron nearer. follow me!’
then aragorn led the way, and such was the strength of his will in that hour that all the dúnedain and their horses followed him. and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were willing to face even the terror of the door, if their masters’ hearts were steady as they walked beside

ft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and legolas passed in. and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alone.
his knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. ‘here is a thing unheard of!’ he said. ‘an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not!’ with that he plunged in. but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came upon him, even upon gimli glóin’s son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world.
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow, and now he went ahead bearing one aloft; and elladan with another went at the rear, and gimli, stumbling behind, strove to overtake him. he could see nothing but the dim flame of the torches; but if the company halted, there seemed an endless whisper of voices all about him, a murmur of words in no tongue that he had ever heard before.
nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage, and yet steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on: most of all

because he knew now that there could be no turning back; all the paths behind were thronged by an unseen host that followed in the dark.
so time unreckoned passed, until gimli saw a sight that he was ever afterwards loth to recall. the road was wide, as far as he could judge, but now the company came suddenly into a great empty space, and there were no longer any walls upon either side. the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk. away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragorn’s torch drew near. then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be.
‘does he feel no fear?’ muttered the dwarf. ‘in any other cave gimli glóin’s son would have been the first to run to the gleam of gold. but not here! let it lie!’
nonetheless he drew near, and saw aragorn kneeling, while elladan held aloft both torches. before him were the bones of a mighty man. he had been clad in mail, and still his harness lay there whole; for the cavern’s air was as dry as dust, and his

 hauberk was gilded. his belt was of gold and garnets, and rich with gold was the helm upon his bony head face downward on the floor. he had fallen near the far wall of the cave, as now could be seen, and before him stood a stony door closed fast: his finger-bones were still clawing at the cracks. a notched and broken sword lay by him, as if he had hewn at the rock in his last despair.
aragorn did not touch him, but after gazing silently for a while he rose and sighed. ‘hither shall the flowers of simbelmynë come never unto world’s end,’ he murmured. ‘nine mounds and seven there are now green with grass, and through all the long years he has lain at the door that he could not unlock. whither does it lead? why would he pass? none shall ever know!
‘for that is not my errand!’ he cried, turning back and speaking to the whispering darkness behind. ‘keep your hoards and you

 uprising of the morthond, the long chill river that flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of dol amroth. you will not need to ask hereafter how comes its name: blackroot men call it.’
the morthond vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains. its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all was grey in that hour, for the sun had gone, and far below lights twinkled in the homes of men. the vale was rich and many folk dwelt there.
then without turning aragorn cried aloud so that all could hear: ‘friends, forget your weariness! ride now, ride! we must come to the stone of erech ere this day passes, and long still is the way.’ so without looking back they rode the mountain-fields, until they came to a bridge over the growing torrent and found a road that went down into the land.
lights went out in house and hamlet as they came, and doors were shut, and folk that were afield cried in terror and ran wild like hunted deer. ever there rose the same cr

y in the gathering night: ‘the king of the dead! the king of the dead is come upon us!’
bells were ringing far below, and all men fled before the face of aragorn; but the grey company in their haste rode like hunters, until their horses were stumbling with weariness. and thus, just ere midnight, and in a darkness as black as the caverns in the mountains, they came at last to the hill of erech.
long had the terror of the dead lain upon that hill and upon the empty fields about it. for upon the top stood a black stone, round as a great globe, the height of a man, though its half was buried in the ground. unearthly it looked, as though it had fallen from t

he sky, as some believed; but those who remembered still the lore of westernesse told that it had been brought out of the ruin of númenor and there set by isildur at his landing. none of the people of the valley dared to approach it, nor would they dwell near; for they said that it was a trysting-place of the shadow-men, and there they would gather in times of fear, thronging round the stone and whispering.
to that stone the company came and halted in the dead of night. then elrohir gave to aragorn a silver horn, and he blew upon it and it seemed to those that stood near that they heard a sound of answering horns, as if it was an echo in deep caves far away. no other sound they heard, and yet they were aware of a great host gathered all about the hill on which they stood; and a chill wind like the breath of ghosts came down from the mountains. but aragorn dismounted, and standing by the stone he cried in a great voice:
‘oathbreakers, why have ye come?’
and a voice was heard out of the

 night that answered him, as if from far away:
‘to fulfil our oath and have peace.’
then aragorn said: ‘the hour is come at last. now i go to pelargir upon anduin, and ye shall come after me. and when all this land is clean of the servants of sauron, i will hold the oath fulfilled, and ye shall have peace and depart for ever. for i am elessar, isildur’s heir of gondor.’
and with that he bade halbarad unfurl the great standard which he had brought; and behold! it was black, and if there was any device upon it, it was hidden in the darkness. then there was silence, and not a whisper no

r a sigh was heard again all the long night. the company camped beside the stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round.
but when the dawn came, cold and pale, aragorn rose at once, and he led the company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them had known, save he alone, and only his will held them to go on. no other mortal men could have endured it, none but the dúnedain of the north, and with them gimli the dwarf and legolas of the elves.
they passed tarlang’s neck and came into lamedon; and the shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to calembel upon ciril, and the sun went down like blo

 behind him using. it was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire, yet he could not piece the words together. at times some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.
all the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day’s end. he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to; and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli. then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of frodo and sam. ‘i am forgetting them!’ he said to himself reproachfully. ‘and yet they are more important than all the rest of us. and i came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away, if they are still alive.’ he shivered.
‘harrowdale at last!’ said éomer. ‘our journey is almost at an end.’ they halted. the paths out of the narrow gorge fell steeply. only a glimpse, as through a t

to merry that her voice belied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping, if that could be believed of one so stern of face. ‘all is well. it was a weary road for the people to take, torn suddenly from their homes. there were hard words, for it is long since war has driven us from the green fields; but there have been no evil deeds. all is now ordered, as you see. and your lodging is prepared for you; for i have had full tidings of you and knew the hour of your coming.’
‘so aragorn has come then,’ said éomer. ‘is he still here?’
‘no, he is gone,’ said éowyn turning away and looking at the mountains dark against the east and south.
‘whither did he go?’ asked éomer.
‘i do not know,’ she answered. ‘he came at night, and rode away yestermorn, ere the sun had climbed over the mountain-tops. he is gone.’
‘you are grieved, daughter,’ said théoden. ‘what has happened? tell me, did he speak of that road?’ he pointed away along the darkening lines

room was made for the hobbit at the king’s left hand, but no one called for any tale. there was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the most part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage, merry asked the question that was tormenting him.
‘twice now, lord, i have heard of the paths of the dead,’ he said. ‘what are they? and where has strider, i mean the lord aragorn where has he gone?’
the king sighed, but no one answered, until at last éomer spoke. ‘we do not know, and our hearts are heavy,’ he said. ‘but as for the paths of the dead, you have yourself walked on their first steps. nay. i speak no words of ill omen! the road that we have climbed is the approach to the door, yonder in the dimholt. but what lies beyond no man knows.’
‘no man knows,’ said théoden: ‘yet ancient legend, now seldom spoken, has somewhat to report. if these old t

d down the stony road. then the people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and shroud their windows and are afraid. but the dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death.’
‘yet it is said in harrowdale,’ said éowyn in a low voice. ‘that in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed by. whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.’
‘then why has aragorn gone that way?’ asked merry. ‘don’t you know anything that would explain it?’
‘unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,’ said éomer, ‘none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.’
‘greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw him first in the king’s house,’ said éowyn: ‘grimmer, older. fey i thought him, and like one whom the dead call.’
‘maybe he was called,’ said théoden; ‘and my heart tells me that i shall not see h

then they halted and looked at him and saw that he lived still; but he did not look at them. the way is shut, his voice said again it was made by those who are dead, and the dead keep it, until the time comes. the way is shut.
‘and when will that time be? said baldor. but no answer did he ever get. for the old man died in that hour and fell upon his face; and no other tidings of the ancient dwellers in the mountains have our folk ever learned. yet maybe at last the time foretold has come, and aragorn may pass.’
‘but how shall a man discover whether that time be come or no, save by daring the door?’ said éomer. ‘and that way i would not go though all the hosts of mordor stood before me, and i were alone and had no other refuge. alas that a fey mood should fall on a man so greathearted in this hour of need! are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the earth? war is at hand.’
he paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man’s voice crying th

, even if i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.’
théoden smiled. ‘rather than that i would bear you with me on snowmane,’ he said. ‘but at the least you shall ride with me to edoras and look on meduseld; for that way i shall go. so far stybba can bear you: the great race will not begin till we reach the plains.’
then éowyn rose up. ‘come now, meriadoc!’ she said. ‘i will show you the gear that i have prepared fur you.’ they went out together. ‘this request only did aragorn make to me,’ said éowyn, as they passed among the tents, ‘that you should be armed for battle. i have granted it, as i could. for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.’
now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of the king’s guard and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and other gear.
‘no mail have we to fit you,’ said éowyn, ‘nor any time for the forging of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather,

breath. it was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother boromir - whom pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man’s lordly but kindly manner. yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. here was one with an air of high nobility such as aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the kings of men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the elder race. he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love. he was a captain that men would follow, that he would follow, even under the shadow of the black wings.
‘faramir!’ he cried aloud with the others. ‘faramir!’ and faramir catching his strange voice among the clamour of the men of the city, turned and looked

gandalf stood for a moment in thought. ‘maybe,’ he muttered. ‘maybe even your foolishness helped, my lad. let me see: some five days ago now he would discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone. still what of that? we could not use it to much purpose, or without his knowing. ah! i wonder. aragorn? his time draws near. and he is strong and stern underneath, pippin; bold, determined, able to take his own counsel and dare great risks at need. that may be it. he may have used the stone and shown himself to the enemy, challenging him, for this very purpose. i wonder. well, we shall not know the answer till the riders of rohan come, if they do not come too late. there are evil days ahead. to sleep while we may!’
‘but,’ said pippin.
‘but what?’ said gandalf. ‘only one but will i al

d his gaze, and behold! upon the foremost ship a great standard broke, and the wind displayed it as she turned towards the harlond. there flowered a white tree, and that was for gondor; but seven stars were about it, and a high crown above it, the signs of elendil that no lord had borne for years beyond count. and the stars flamed in the sunlight, for they were wrought of gems by arwen daughter of elrond; and the crown was bright in the morning, for it was wrought of mithril and gold.
thus came aragorn son of arathorn, elessar, isildur’s heir, out of the paths of the dead, borne upon a wind from the sea to the kingdom of gondor; and the mirth of the rohirrim was a torrent of laughter and a flashing of swords, and the joy and wonder of the city was a music of trumpets and a ringing of bells. but the hosts of mordor were seized with bewilderment, and a great wizardry it seemed to them that their own ships should be filled with their foes; and a black dread fell on them, knowing that the tides

he sunlight. south strode éomer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the harlond and swept north like a storm. there came legolas, and gimli wielding his axe, and halbarad with the standard, and elladan and elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed dúnedain, rangers of the north, leading a great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and the fiefs of the south. but before all went aragorn with the flame of the west, andúril like a new fire kindled, narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the star of elendil.
and so at length éomer and aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and they leaned on their swords and looked on one another and were glad.
‘thus we meet again, though all the hosts of mordor lay between us,’ said aragorn. ‘did i not say so at the hornburg?’
‘so you spoke,’ said éomer, ‘but hope oft deceives, and i knew not then that you

were a man foresighted. yet twice blessed is help unlooked for, and never was a meeting of friends more joyful.’ and they clasped hand in hand. ‘nor indeed more timely,’ said éomer. ‘you come none too soon, my friend. much loss and sorrow has befallen us.’
‘then let us avenge it, ere we speak of it!’ said aragorn, and they rode back to battle together.
hard fighting and long labour they had still; for the southrons were bold men and grim, and fierce in despair; and the easterlings were strong and war-hardened and asked for no quarter. and so in this place and that, by burned homestead or barn, upon hillock or mound, under wall or on field, still they gathered and rallied and fought until the day wore away.
then the sun went at last behind mindolluin and filled all the sky with a great burning, so that t

hills and the mountains were dyed as with blood; fire glowed in the river, and the grass of the pelennor lay red in the nightfall. and in that hour the great battle of the field of gondor was over; and not one living foe was left within the circuit of the rammas. all were slain save those who fled to die, or to drown in the red foam of the river. few ever came eastward to morgul or mordor; and to the land of the haradrim came only a tale from far off: a rumour of the wrath and terror of gondor.
aragorn and éomer and imrahil rode back towards the gate of the city, and they were now weary beyond joy or sorrow. these three were unscathed, for such was their fortune and the skill and might of their arms, and few indeed had dared to abide them or look on their faces in the hour of their wrath. but many others were hurt or maimed or dead upon the field. the axes hewed forlong as he fought alone and unhorsed; and both duilin of morthond and his brother were trampled to death when they assailed the

aybe a king has indeed returned to gondor; or have you not heard the strange tidings that have come to the city?’
‘i have been too busy with this and that to heed all the crying and shouting,’ she answered. ‘all i hope is that those murdering devils do not come to this house and trouble the sick.’
then gandalf went out in haste, and already the fire in the sky was burning out, and the smouldering hills were fading, while ash-grey evening crept over the fields.
now as the sun went down aragorn and éomer and imrahil drew near the city with their captains and knights; and when they came before the gate aragorn said:
‘behold the sun setting in a great fire! it is a sign of the end and fall of many things, and a change in the tides of the world. but this city and realm has rested in the charge of the stewards for many long years, and i fear that if i enter it unbidden, then doubt and debate may arise, which should not be while this war is fought. i will not enter in, nor make any clai

m, until it be seen whether we or mordor shall prevail. men shall pitch my tents upon the field, and here i will await the welcome of the lord of the city.’
but éomer said: ‘already you have raised the banner of the kings and displayed the tokens of elendil’s house. will you suffer these to be challenged?’
‘no,’ said aragorn. ‘but i deem the time unripe; and i have no mind for strife except with our enemy and his servants.’
and the prince imrahil said. your words, lord, are wise, if one who is a kinsman of the lord denethor may counsel you in this matter. he is strong-willed and proud, but old; and his mood has been strange since his son was stricken down. yet i would not have you remain like a beggar at the door.’
‘not a beggar,’ said aragorn. ‘say a captain of the rangers, who are unused to cities and

in and is not dead, but is near death. but the lord faramir was wounded by an evil dart, as you have heard, and he is now the steward; for denethor has departed, and his house is in ashes.’ and they were filled with grief and wonder at the tale that he told.
but imrahil said: ‘so victory is shorn of gladness, and it is bitter bought, if both gondor and rohan are in one day bereft of their lords. éomer rules the rohirrim. who shall rule the city meanwhile? shall we not send now for the lord aragorn?’
and the cloaked man spoke and said: ‘he is come.’ and they saw as he stepped into the light of the lantern by the door that it was aragorn, wrapped in the grey cloak of lórien above his mail, and bearing no other token than the green stone of galadriel. ‘i have come because gandalf begs me to do so,’ he said. ‘but for the present i am but the captain of the dúnedain of arnor; and the lord of dol amroth shall rule the city until faramir awakes. but it is my counsel that gandalf s

hould rule us all in the days that follow and in our dealings with the enemy.’ and they agreed upon that.
then gandalf said: ‘let us not stay at the door, for the time is urgent. let us enter! for it is only in the coming of aragorn that any hope remains for the sick that lie in the house. thus spake ioreth, wise-woman of gondor: the hands of the king are the hands of a healer, and so shall the rightful king be known.’
then aragorn entered first and the others followed. and there at the door were two guards in the livery of the citadel: one tall, but the other scarce the height of a boy; and when he saw them he cried aloud in surprise and joy.
‘strider! how splendid! do you know, i guessed it was you in the black ships. but they were all shouting corsairs and wouldn’t listen to me. how did you do it?’
aragorn laughed, and took the hobbit by the hand. ‘well met indeed!’ he said. ‘but there is not time yet for t

ravellers’ tales.’
but imrahil said to éomer: ‘is it thus that we speak to our kings? yet maybe he will wear his crown in some other name!’
and aragorn hearing him, turned and said: ‘verily, for in the high tongue of old i am elessar, the elfstone, and envinyatar, the renewer’: and he lifted from his breast the green stone that lay there. ‘but strider shall be the name of my house, if that be ever established. in the high tongue it will not sound so ill, and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body.’
and with that they passed into the house; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended gandalf told of the deeds

 of éowyn and meriadoc. ‘for,’ he said, ‘long have i stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. also it is given to me to see many things far off.’
aragorn went first to faramir, and then to the lady éowyn, and last to merry. when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. ‘here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,’ he said. ‘would that elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, and has the greater power.’
and éomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: ‘first you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?’
but aragorn answered: ‘nay, for these three, an

rd,’ she answered; ‘but not enough, i reckon, for all that will need them. but i am sure i do not know where we shall find more; for all things are amiss in these dreadful days, what with fires and burnings, and the lads that run errands so few, and all the roads blocked. why, it is days out of count since ever a carrier came in from lossarnach to the market! but we do our best in this house with what we have, as i am sure your lordship will know.’
‘i will judge that when i see,’ said aragorn. ‘one thing also is short time for speech. have you athelas?’
‘i do not know, i am sure, lord,’ she answered, ‘at least not by that name. i will go and ask of the herb-master; he knows all the old names.’
‘it is also called kingsfoil,’ said aragorn; ‘and maybe you know it by that name, for so the country-folk call it in these latter days.’ ‘oh that!’ said ioreth. ‘well, if your lordship had named it at first i could have told you. no, we have none of it, i am sure. why

‘wholesome verily,’ said aragorn. ‘and now, dame, if you love the lord faramir, run as quick as your tongue and get me kingsfoil, if there is a leaf in the city.’
‘and if not,’ said gandalf, ‘i will ride to lossarnach with ioreth behind me, and she shall take me to the woods, but not to her sisters. and shadowfax shall show her the meaning of haste.’
when ioreth was gone, aragorn bade the other women to make water hot. then he took faramir's hand in his, and laid the other hand upon the sick man’s brow. it was dr

enched with sweat; but faramir did not move or make any sign, and seemed hardly to breathe.
‘he is nearly spent,’ said aragorn turning to gandalf. ‘but this comes not from the wound. see! that is healing. had he been smitten by some dart of the nazgûl, as you thought, he would have died that night. this hurt was given by some southron arrow, i would guess. who drew it forth? was it kept?’
‘i drew it forth,’ said imrahil, ‘and staunched the wound. but i did not keep the arrow, for we had much to do. it was, as i remember, just such a dart as the southrons use. yet i believed that it came from the shadows abov

e, for else his fever and sickness were not to be understood; since the wound was not deep or vital. how then do you read the matter?’
‘weariness, grief for his father’s mood, a wound, and over all the black breath,’ said aragorn. ‘he is a man of staunch will, for already he had come close under the shadow before ever he rode to battle on the out-walls. slowly the dark must have crept on him, even as he fought and strove to hold his outpost. would that i could have been here sooner!’
thereupon the herb-master entered. ‘your lordship asked for kingsfoil, as the rustics name it, he said; or athelas in the noble tongue, or to those who know somewhat of the valinorean. . .’
‘i do so,’ said aragorn, ‘and i care

‘then in the name of the king, go and find some old man of less lore and more wisdom who keeps some in his house!’ cried gandalf.
now aragorn knelt beside faramir, and held a hand upon his brow. and those that watched felt that some great struggle was going on. for aragorn’s face grew grey with weariness; and ever and anon he called the name of faramir, but each time more faintly to their hearing, as if aragorn himself was removed from them, and walked afar in some dark vale, calling for one that was lost.
and at last bergil came running in, and he bore six leaves in a cloth. ‘it is kingsfoil, sir,’ he said; ‘but not fresh, i

 fear. it must have been culled two weeks ago at the least. i hope it will serve, sir?’ then looking at faramir he burst into tears.
but aragorn smiled. ‘it will serve,’ he said. ‘the worst is now over. stay and be comforted!’ then taking two leaves, he laid them on his hands and breathed on them, and then he crushed them, and straightway a living freshness filled the room, as if the air itself awoke and tingled, sparkling with joy. and then he cast the leaves into the bowls of steaming water that were brought to him, and at once all hearts were lightened. for the fragrance that came to each was like a memory of dewy mornings of

 unshadowed sun in some land of which the fair world in spring is itself but a fleeting memory. but aragorn stood up as one refreshed, and his eyes smiled as he held a bowl before faramir’s dreaming face.
‘well now! who would have believed it?’ said ioreth to a woman that stood beside her. ‘the weed is better than i thought. it reminds me of the roses of imloth melui when i was a lass, and no king could ask for better.’
suddenly faramir stirred, and he opened his eyes, and he looked on aragorn who bent over him; and a light of knowledge and love was kindled in his eyes, and he spoke softly.
 
 ___________________________
 
 ‘my lord, you called me. i come. what does the king command?’
‘walk no more in the shadows, but awake!’ said aragorn. ‘you are weary. rest a while, and take food, and be ready when i return.’
‘i will, lord,’ said faramir. ‘for who would lie idle when the king has returned?’
‘farewell then for a while!’ said aragorn. ‘i must go to others who need me.’ and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil; but beregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. as he followed gandalf and shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim:
‘king! did you hear that? what did i say? the hands of a healer, i said.’ and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran through the city.
but aragorn came to éowyn, and h

y lord, if your sister’s love for you, and her will still bent to her duty, had not restrained her lips; you might have heard even such things as these escape them. but who knows what she spoke to the darkness, alone, in the bitter watches of the night, when all her life seemed shrinking, and the walls of her bower closing in about her, a hutch to trammel some wild thing in?’
then éomer was silent, and looked on his sister, as if pondering anew all the days of their past life together. but aragorn said: ‘i saw also what you saw, éomer. few other griefs amid the ill chances of this world have more bitterness and shame for a man’s heart than to behold the love of a lady so fair and brave that cannot be returned sorrow and pity have followed me ever since i left her desperate in dunharrow and rode to the paths of the dead; and no fear upon that way was so present as the fear for what might befall her. and yet, éomer, i say to you that she loves you more truly than me; for you she love

s and knows; but in me she loves only a shadow and a thought: a hope of glory and great deeds, and lands far from the fields of rohan.
‘i have, maybe, the power to heal her body, and to recall her from the dark valley. but to what she will awake: hope, or forgetfulness, or despair, i do not know. and if to despair, then she will die, unless other healing comes which i cannot bring. alas! for her deeds have set her among the queens of great renown.’
then aragorn stooped and looked in her face, and it was indeed white as a lily, cold as frost, and hard as graven stone. but he bent and kissed her on the brow, and called her softly, saying:
‘éowyn éomund’s daughter, awake! for your enemy has passed away!’
she did not stir, but now she began again to breathe deeply, so that her breast rose and fell beneath the white linen of the sheet. once more aragorn bruised two leaves of athelas and cast them into steaming water; and he laved her brow with it,

then, whether aragorn had indeed some forgotten power of westernesse, or whether it was but his words of the lady éowyn that wrought on them, as the sweet influence of the herb stole about the chamber it seemed to those who stood by that a keen wind blew through the window, and it bore no scent, but was an air wholly fresh and clean and young, as if it had not before been breathed by any living thing and came new-made from snowy mountains high beneath a dome of stars, or from shores of silver far away washed by sea

s of foam.
‘awake, éowyn, lady of rohan!’ said aragorn again, and he took her right hand in his and felt it warm with life returning. ‘awake! the shadow is gone and all darkness is washed clean!’ then he laid her hand in éomer’s and stepped away. ‘call her!’ he said, and he passed silently from the chamber.
‘éowyn, éowyn!’ cried éomer amid his tears. but she opened her eyes and said: ‘éomer! what joy is this? for they said that you were slain. nay, but that was only the dark voices in my dream. how long have i been dreaming?’

‘to health?’ said éowyn. ‘it may be so. at least while there is an empty saddle of some fallen rider that i can fill, and there are deeds to do. but to hope? i do not know.’
gandalf and pippin came to merry’s room, and there they found aragorn standing by the bed. ‘poor old merry!’ cried pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized pippin that merry would die.
‘do not be afraid,’ said aragorn. ‘i came in time, and i have called him back. he is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the lady éowyn, daring to smite that deadly thing. but these evils can be amended, so

 strong and gay a spirit is in him. his grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.’
then aragorn laid his hand on merry’s head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly merry awoke, and he said:
‘i am hungry. what is the time?’
‘past supper-time now,’ said pippin; ‘though i daresay i could bring you something, if they will let me.’
‘they will indeed,’ said gandalf. ‘and any

‘why not?’ said pippin.
‘well,’ answered merry slowly. ‘he is dead. it has brought it all back to me. he said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore with me. almost the last thing he ever said. i shan’t ever be able to smoke again without thinking of him, and that day, pippin, when he rode up to isengard and was so polite.’
‘smoke then, and think of him!’ said aragorn. ‘for he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair morning. though your service to him was brief, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.’
merry smiled. ‘well then,’ he said, ‘if strider will provide what is needed, i will smoke and think. i had some of saruman’s best in my pack, but what became of it in the battle, i am sure i don’t know.’
‘master meriadoc,’ said aragorn, ‘if you think

n such a bed as this, since i rode from dunharrow, nor eaten since the dark before dawn.’
merry seized his hand and kissed it. ‘i am frightfully sorry,’ he said. ‘go at once! ever since that night at bree we have been a nuisance to you. but it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than they mean. we fear to say too much. it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place.’
‘i know that well, or i would not deal with you in the same way ‘ said aragorn. ‘may the shire live for ever unwithered!’ and kissing merry he went out, and gandalf went with him.
pippin remained behind. ‘was there ever any one like him?’ he said. ‘except gandalf, of course. i think they must be related. my dear ass, your pack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when i met you. he saw it all the time, of course. and anyway i have some stuff of my own. come on now! longbottom leaf it is. fill up while i run and see about some food. and then let’s

aragorn and gandalf went now to the warden of the houses of healing, and they counselled him that faramir and éowyn should remain there and still be tended with care for many days.
‘the lady éowyn,’ said aragorn, ‘will wish soon to rise and depart; but she should not be permitted to do so, if you can in any way restrain her, until at least ten days be passed.’
‘as for faramir,’ said gandalf, ‘he must soon learn that his father is dead. but the full tale of the madness of denethor should

and the other perian meriadoc who is under my care, what of him?’ said the warden.
‘it is likely that he will be fit to arise tomorrow, for a short while,’ said aragorn. ‘let him do so, if he wishes. he may walk a little in the care of his friends.’
‘they are a remarkable race,’ said the warden, nodding his head. ‘very tough in the fibre, i deem.’
at the doors of the houses many were already gathered to see aragorn, and they followed after him; and when at last he had supped, men came and prayed that he would heal their kinsmen or their friends whose lives were in peril through hurt or wound, or who lay under the black shadow. and aragorn arose and

together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning; but gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him.
‘there is some good stone-work here,’ he said as he looked at the walls; ‘but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better contrived. when aragorn comes into his own, i shall offer him the service of stonewrights of the mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.’
‘they need more gardens,’ said legolas. ‘the houses are dead, and there is too little here that grows and is glad. if aragorn comes into his own, the people of the wood shall bring him birds that sing and trees that do not die.’
at length they came to the prince imrahil, and legolas looked at him and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elv

‘so it is said in the lore of my land,’ said the prince; ‘yet never has one of the fair folk been seen there for years beyond count. and i marvel to see one here now in the midst of sorrow and war. what do you seek?’
‘i am one of the nine companions who set out with mithrandir from imladris, said legolas and with this dwarf, my friend, i came with the lord aragorn. but now we wish to see our friends. meriadoc and peregrin, who are in your keeping, we are told.’
‘you will find them in the houses of healing, and i will lead you thither,’ said imrahil.
‘it will be enough if you send one to guide us, lord,’ said legolas. ‘for aragorn sends this message to you. he does not wish to enter the city again at this time. yet there is need for the captains to hold council at once, and he prays that you and éomer of rohan will come down to his tents, as

i want to hear more about you all. come, gimli! you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a dozen times already this morning. but you haven’t told me anything about it.’
‘the sun may shine here,’ said gimli, ‘but there are memories of that road that i do not wish to recall out of the darkness. had i known what was before me, i think that not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead.’
‘the paths of the dead?’ said pippin. ‘i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean. won’t you tell us some more?’
‘not willingly,’ said gimli. ‘for upon that road i was put to shame: gimli glóin’s son, who had deemed himself more tough than men, and hardier under earth than any elf. but neither did i prove; and i was held to the road only by the will of aragorn.’
‘and by the love of him also,’ said legolas. ‘for all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the roh

s and three, to pelargir on anduin. ‘four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from the black stone,’ he said. ‘and lo! in the darkness of mordor my hope rose; for in that gloom the shadow host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible to look upon. some i saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same great speed. silent they were, but there was a gleam in their eyes. in the uplands of lamedon they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would have passed us by, if aragorn had not forbidden them.
‘at his command they fell back. “even the shades of men are obedient to his will,” i thought. “they may serve his needs yet! “
‘one day of light we rode, and then came the day without dawn, and still we rode on, and ciril and ringló we crossed; and on the third day we came to linhir above the mouth of gilrain. and there men of lamedon contested the fords with fell folk of umbar and harad who had sailed up the river. but defenders and foes alike gave up the b

attle and fled when we came, crying out that the king of the dead was upon them. only angbor, lord of lamedon, had the heart to abide us; and aragorn bade him gather his folk and come behind, if they dared, when the grey host had passed.
‘ “at pelargir the heir of isildur will have need of you,” he said.
‘thus we crossed over gilrain, driving the allies of mordor in rout before us; and then we rested a while. but soon aragorn arose, saying: “lo! already minas tirith is assailed. i fear that it will fall ere we come to its aid.” so we mounted again before night had passed and went on with all the speed that our horses could endure over the plains of lebennin.’
legolas paused and sighed, and turning his eyes southward softly he sang:

in the green fields of lebennin!

the white lilies sway,

gir lay the main fleet of umbar, fifty great ships and smaller vessels beyond count. many of those that we pursued had reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some of the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the river or to reach the far shore; and many of the smaller craft were ablaze. but the haradrim, being now driven to the brink, turned at bay, and they were fierce in despair; and they laughed when they looked on us, for they were a great army still.
‘but aragorn halted and cried with a great voice: “now come! by the black stone i call you! “ and suddenly the shadow host that had hung back at the last came up like a grey tide, sweeping all away before it. faint cries i heard, and dim horns blowing, and a murmur as of countless far voices: it was like the echo of some forgotten battle in the dark years long ago. pale swords were drawn; but i know not whether their blades would still bite, for the dead needed no longer any weapon but fear. none would

withstand them.
‘to every ship they came that was drawn up, and then they passed over the water to those that were anchored; and all the mariners were filled with a madness of terror and leaped overboard, save the slaves chained to the oars. reckless we rode among our fleeing foes, driving them like leaves, until we came to the shore. and then to each of the great ships that remained aragorn sent one of the dúnedain, and they comforted the captives that were aboard, and bade them put aside fear and be free.
‘ere that dark day ended none of the enemy were left to resist us all were drowned, or were flying south in the hope to find their own lands upon foot. strange and wonderful i thought it that the designs of mordor should be overthrown by such wraiths of fear and darkness. with its own weapons was it worsted!’
‘strange indeed,’ said legolas. ‘in that hour i looked on a

ragorn and thought how great and terrible a lord he might have become in the strength of his will, had he taken the ring to himself. not for naught does mordor fear him. but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron; for is he not of the children of lúthien? never shall that line fail, though the years may lengthen beyond count.’
‘beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings,’ said gimli. ‘but mighty indeed was aragorn that day. lo! all the black fleet was in his hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy; and the shadow host withdrew to the shore. there they stood silent, hardly to be seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were burning. and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead men, crying:

r of lamedon came up with all the horsemen that he could muster. now that the fear of the dead was removed they came to aid us and to look on the heir of isildur; for the rumour of that name had run like fire in the dark.
‘and that is near the end of our tale. for during that evening and night many ships were made ready and manned; and in the morning the fleet set forth. long past it now seems, yet it was but the morn of the day ere yesterday, the sixth since we rode from dunharrow. but still aragorn was driven by fear that time was too short.
‘ “it is forty leagues and two from pelargir to the landings at the harlond,” he said. “yet to the harlond we must come tomorrow or fail utterly.”
‘the oars were now wielded by free men, and manfully they laboured; yet slowly we passed up the great river, for we strove against its stream, and though that is not swift down in the south, we had no help of wind. heavy would my heart have been, for all our victory at the havens, if legolas had

 not laughed suddenly.
‘ “up with your beard, durin’s son! “ he said. “for thus is it spoken: oft hope is born, when all is forlorn.” but what hope he saw from afar he would not tell. when night came it did but deepen the darkness, and our hearts were hot, for away in the north we saw a red glow under the cloud, and aragorn said: “minas tirith is burning.”
‘but at midnight hope was indeed born anew. sea-crafty men of the ethir gazing southward spoke of a change coming with a fresh wind from the sea. long ere day the masted ships hoisted sail; and our speed grew, until dawn whitened the foam at our prows. and so it was, as you know, that we came in the third hour of the morning with a fair wind and the sun unveiled, and we unfurled the great standard in battle. it was a great day and a great hour, whatever ma

‘follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,’ said legolas. ‘great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead, and great it shall remain, though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come.’
‘and that may well befall,’ said gimli. ‘for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave. much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below. for my part, like merry, i wish that with our victory the war was now over. yet whatever is still to do, i hope to have a part in it, for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain.’
‘and i for the folk of the great wood,’ said legolas, ‘and for the love of the lord of the white tree.’

ghts, while the captains debated.
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli, at once he sent for éomer; and he went down with him from the city, and they came to the tents of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where king théoden had fallen. and there they took counsel together with gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond.
‘my lords,’ said gandalf, ‘listen to the words of the steward of gondor before he died: you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day, but against the power that has now arisen there is no victory. i do not bid you despair, as he did, but to ponder the truth in these words.
‘the stones of seeing do not lie, and not even the lord of barad-dûr can make them do so. he can, maybe, by his will choose what things shall be seen by weaker minds, or cause them

are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till. what weather they shall have is not ours to rule.
‘now sauron knows all this, and he knows that this precious thing which he lost has been found again; but he does not yet know where it is, or so we hope. and therefore he is now in great doubt. for if we have found this thing, there are some among us with strength enough to wield it. that too he knows. for do i not guess rightly, aragorn, that you have shown yourself to him in the stone of orthanc?’
‘i did so ere i rode from the hornburg,’ answered aragorn. ‘i deemed that the time was ripe, and that the stone had come to me for just such a purpose. it was then ten days since the ring-bearer went east from rauros, and the eye of sauron, i thought, should be drawn out from his own land. too seldom has he been challenged since he returned to his tower. though if i had foreseen how swift would be his onset in answer, maybe

s we speak here. his eye is now straining towards us, blind almost to all else that is moving. so we must keep it. therein lies all our hope. this, then, is my counsel. we have not the ring. in wisdom or great folly it has been sent away to be destroyed, lest it destroy us. without it we cannot by force defeat his force. but we must at all costs keep his eye from his true peril. we cannot achieve victory by arms, but by arms we can give the ring-bearer his only chance, frail though it be.
‘as aragorn has begun, so we must go on. we must push sauron to his last throw. we must call out his hidden strength, so that he shall empty his land. we must march out to meet him at once. we must make ourselves the bait, though his jaws should close on us. he will take that bait, in hope and in greed, for he will think that in such rashness he sees the pride of the new ringlord: and he will say: “so! he pushes out his neck too soon and too far. let him come on, and behold i will have him in a trap from

again for ever.”
‘we must walk open-eyed into that trap, with courage, but small hope for ourselves. for, my lords, it may well prove that we ourselves shall perish utterly in a black battle far from the living lands; so that even if barad-dûr be thrown down, we shall not live to see a new age. but this, i deem, is our duty. and better so than to perish nonetheless - as we surely shall, if we sit here - and know as we die that no new age shall be.’
they were silent for a while. at length aragorn spoke. ‘as i have begun, so i will go on. we come now to the very brink, where hope and despair are akin. to waver is to fall. let none now reject the counsels of gandalf, whose long labours against sauron come at last to their test. but for him all would long ago have been lost. nonetheless i do not yet claim to command any man. let others choose as they will.’
then said elrohir: ‘from the north we came with this purpose, and from elrond our father we brought this very counsel. we will n

‘as for myself,’ said éomer, ‘i have little knowledge of these deep matters; but i need it not. this i know, and it is enough, that as my friend aragorn succoured me and my people, so i will aid him when he calls. i will go.’
‘as for me,’ said imrahil, ‘the lord aragorn i hold to be my liege-lord, whether he claim it or no. his wish is to me a command. i will go also. yet for a while i stand in the place of the steward of gondor, and it is mine to think first of its people. to prudence some heed must still be given. for we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. now, it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, gondor must be protected. i would not have us return with victory to a city in ruins and a land ravaged behind

ns: what force could we muster and lead out in two days’ time at the latest? and they must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril.’
‘all are weary, and very many have wounds light or grievous,’ said éomer, ‘and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is ill to bear. if we must ride soon, then i cannot hope to lead even two thousands, and yet leave as many for the defence of the city.’
‘we have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field ‘ said aragorn. ‘new strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now that the coasts have been rid. four thousands i sent marching from pelargir through lossarnach two days ago; and angbor the fearless rides before them. if we set out in two days more, they will draw nigh ere we depart. moreover many were bidden to follow me up the river in any craft they could gather; and with this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already come to the harlond. i judge that we could lead out seve

n thousands of horse and foot, and yet leave the city in better defence than it was when the assault began.’
‘the gate is destroyed,’ said imrahil, ‘and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?’
‘in erebor in the kingdom of dáin there is such skill,’ said aragorn; ‘and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time i will send gimli glóin’s son to ask for wrights of the mountain. but men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our enemy if men desert it.’
this then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. aragorn should find

‘no, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting,’ said gandalf. ‘and there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad knights apiece. no, he will not smile.’
‘neither shall we,’ said aragorn. ‘if this be jest, then it is too bitter for laughter. nay, it is the last move in a great jeopardy, and for one side or the other it will bring the end of the game.’ then he drew andúril and held it up glittering in the sun. ‘you shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought;’ he said.

scattered by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be. scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross-roads of the fallen king. all now was ready for the last throw.
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the company of aragorn and gandalf, who went in the van with the dúnedain and the sons of elrond. but merry to his shame was not to go with them.
‘you are not fit for such a journey,’ said aragorn. ‘but do not be ashamed. if you do no more in this war, you have already earned great honour. peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk; and do not grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match your deed. but in truth all now are in like danger. tho

he great ring of trees, and all was silent. no sign of any enemy had they seen, no cry or call had been heard, no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the way, yet ever as they went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase. tree and stone, blade and leaf were listening. the darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was on the vale of anduin, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the ephel dúath.
then aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the ring of trees, and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds cried aloud: ‘the lords of gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they take back.’ the hideous orc-head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down and broken in pieces, and the old king’s head was raised and set in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers: and men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs

ir had brought. for if the ring-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not draw the eye of mordor thither. so the next day when the main host came up, they set a strong guard upon the cross-roads to make some defence, if mordor should send a force over the morgul pass, or should bring more men up from the south. for that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting of the ways. but gandalf and aragorn rode with the vanguard to the entrance of morgul vale and looked on the evil city.
it was dark and lifeless; for the orcs and lesser creatures of mordor that had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle, and the nazgûl were abroad. yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity. then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed.
the day after, being the third day since they set out from minas tirith, the army began its northward march along the roa

faramir had waylaid the men of harad, and the road went in a deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward hills. but the captains of the west were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from henneth annûn led by mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. for horsemen went wide about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and they were destroyed or driven east into the hills.
but the victory did little to enhearten the captains. ‘it is but a feint,’ said aragorn; ‘and its chief purpose, i deem, was rather to draw us on by a false guess of our enemy’s weakness than to do us much hurt, yet.’ and from that evening onward the nazgûl came and followed every move of the army. they still flew high and out of sight of all save legolas, and yet their presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun; and though the ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and were silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be sh

opeless journey wore away. upon the fourth day from the cross-roads and the sixth from minas tirith they came at last to the end of the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation that lay before the gates of the pass of cirith gorgor; and they could descry the marshes and the desert that stretched north and west to the emyn muil. so desolate were those places and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the host were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor ride further north.
aragorn looked at them, and there was pity in his eyes rather than wrath; for these were young men from rohan, from westfold far away, or husbandmen from lossarnach, and to them mordor had been from childhood a name of evil, and yet unreal, a legend that had no part in their simple life; and now they walked like men in a hideous dream made true, and they understood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass.
‘go!’ said aragorn. ‘but keep what honour you may, and do not run! and the

than would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall alone. yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about the morannon were filled with hidden foes, and the shadowy defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things. and as they stood they saw all the nazgûl gathered together, hovering above the towers of the teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. but still the enemy made no sign.
no choice was left them but to play their part to its end. therefore aragorn now set the host in such array as could best be contrived; and they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of labour. before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. when all was ordered, the captains rode forth towards the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. there was gandalf as chief herald, and aragorn with the sons of elrond, and éomer of rohan,

he it was that now rode out, and with him came only a small company of black-harnessed soldiery, and a single banner, black but bearing on it in red the evil eye. now halting a few paces before the captains of the west he looked them up and down and laughed.
‘is there anyone in this rout with authority to treat with me?’ he asked. ‘or indeed with wit to understand me? not thou at least!’ he mocked, turning to aragorn with scorn. ‘it needs more to make a king than a piece of elvish glass, or a rabble such as this. why, any brigand of the hills can show as good a following!’
aragorn said naught in answer, but he took the other’s eye and held it, and for a moment they strove thus; but soon, though aragorn did not stir nor move hand to weapon, the other quailed and gave back as if menaced with a blow. ‘i am a herald and ambassador, and may not be assailed!’ he cried.

 rose smothering the air, as from nearby there marched up an army of easterlings that had waited for the signal in the shadows of ered lithui beyond the further tower. down from the hills on either side of the morannon poured orcs innumerable. the men of the west were trapped, and soon. all about the grey mounds where they stood, forces ten times and more than ten times their match would ring them in a sea of enemies. sauron had taken the proffered bait in jaws of steel.
little time was left to aragorn for the ordering of his battle. upon the one hill he stood with gandalf, and there fair and desperate was raised the banner of the tree and stars. upon the other hill hard by stood the banners of rohan and dol amroth, white horse and silver swan. and about each hill a ring was made facing all ways, bristling with spear and sword. but in the front towards mordor where the first bitter assault would come there stood the sons of elrond on the left with the dúnedain about them, and on the right th

‘i wonder if they think of us at all,’ he said, ‘and what is happening to them all away there.’ he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to shelob’s tunnel, not west. out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire-reckoning. and even now aragorn was leading the black fleet from pelargir, and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain valley, while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor. yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam. they were not forgotten. but they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise hamfast’s son; he was utterly alone.

chapter 4

the field of cormallen

all about the hills the hosts of mordor raged. the captains of the west were foundering in a gathering sea. the sun gleamed red, and under the wings of the nazgûl the shadows of death fell dark upon the earth. aragorn stood beneath his banner, silent and stern, as one lost in thought of things long past or far away; but his eyes gleamed like stars that shine the brighter as the night deepens. upon the hill-top stood gandalf, and he was white and cold and no shadow fell on him. the onslaught of mordor broke like a wave on the beleaguered hills, voices roaring like a tide amid the wreck and crash of arms.
as if to his eyes some sudden vision had been given, gandalf stirred; and he turned, looking back north wh

pe. but the men of rhûn and of harad, easterling and southron, saw the ruin of their war and the great majesty and glory of the captains of the west. and those that were deepest and longest in evil servitude, hating the west, and yet were men proud and bold, in their turn now gathered themselves for a last stand of desperate battle. but the most part fled eastward as they could; and some cast their weapons down and sued for mercy.
then gandalf, leaving all such matters of battle and command to aragorn and the other lords, stood upon the hill-top and called; and down to him came the great eagle, gwaihir the windlord, and stood before him.
‘twice you have borne me, gwaihir my friend,’ said gandalf. ‘thrice shall pay for all, if you are willing. you will not find me a burden much greater than when you bore me from zirak-zigil, where my old life burned away.’
‘i would bear you,’ answered gwaihir, ‘whither you will, even were you made of stone.’
‘then come, and let your brother

owered upon a sable field beneath a shining crown and seven glittering stars. on the throne sat a mail-clad man, a great sword was laid across his knees, but he wore no helm. as they drew near he rose. and then they knew him, changed as he was, so high and glad of face, kingly, lord of men, dark-haired with eyes of grey.
frodo ran to meet him, and sam followed close behind. ‘well, if that isn’t the crown of all!’ he said. ‘strider, or i’m still asleep!’
‘yes, sam, strider,’ said aragorn. ‘it is a long way, is it not, from bree, where you did not like the look of me? a long way for us all but yours has been the darkest road.’
and then to sam’s surprise and utter confusion he bowed his knee before them; and taking them by the hand, frodo upon his right and sam upon his left, he led them to the throne, and setting them upon it, he turned to the men and captains who stood by and spoke, so that his voice rang over all the host, crying:
‘praise them with great praise!’

 like silver and gold, and all men were hushed. and he sang to them, now in the elven-tongue, now in the speech of the west, until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness.
and at the last, as the sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the trees lengthened, he ended. ‘praise them with great praise!’ he said and knelt. and then aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted.
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen was given to them. then gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in mordor. for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, an

and she said: ‘do you not know?’
but he answered: ‘two reasons there may be, but which is true, l do not know.’
and she said: ‘i do not wish to play at riddles. speak plainer!’
‘then if you will have it so, lady,’ he said: ‘you do not go, because only your brother called for you, and to look on the lord aragorn, elendil’s heir, in his triumph would now bring you no joy. or because i do not go, and you desire still to be near me. and maybe for both these reasons, and you yourself cannot choose between them. éowyn, do you not love me, or will you not?’
‘i wished to be loved by another,’ she answered. ‘but i desire no man’s pity.’
‘that i know,’ he said. ‘you desired to have the love of the lord aragorn. because he was high and puissant, and you wished to have renown and glory and to

 marshal and many knights of the mark; and upon either side of the gate was a great press of fair people in raiment of many colours and garlands of flowers.
so now there was a wide space before the walls of minas tirith, and it was hemmed in upon all sides by the knights and the soldiers of gondor and of rohan, and by the people of the city and of all parts of the land. a hush fell upon all as out from the host stepped the dúnedain in silver and grey; and before them came walking slow the lord aragorn. he was clad in black mail girt with silver, and he wore a long mantle of pure white clasped at the throat with a great jewel of green that shone from afar; but his head was bare save for a star upon his forehead bound by a slender fillet of silver. with him were éomer of rohan, and the prince imrahil, and gandalf robed all in white, and four small figures that many men marvelled to see.
‘nay, cousin! they are not boys,’ said ioreth to her kinswoman from imloth melui, who stood beside her.

 it was all discovered. and mithrandir, he said to me: “ioreth, men will long remember your words”, and-‘
but ioreth was not permitted to continue the instruction of her kinswoman from the country, for a single trumpet rang, and a dead silence followed. then forth from the gate went faramir with húrin of the keys, and no others, save that behind them walked four men in the high helms and armour of the citadel, and they bore a great casket of black lebethron bound with silver.
faramir met aragorn in the midst of those there assembled, and he knelt, and said: ‘the last steward of gondor begs leave to surrender his office.’ and he held out a white rod; but aragorn took the rod and gave it back, saying: ‘that office is not ended, and it shall be thine and thy heirs’ as long as my line shall last. do now thy office!’
then faramir stood up and spoke in a clear voice: ‘men of gondor hear now the steward of this realm! behold! one has come to claim the kingship again at last. here

and all the host and all the people cried yea with one voice.
and ioreth said to her kinswoman: ‘this is just a ceremony such as we have in the

 the guards stepped forward, and faramir opened the casket, and he held up an ancient crown. it was shaped like the helms of the guards of the citadel, save that it was loftier, and it was all white, and the wings at either side were wrought of pearl and silver in the likeness of the wings of a sea-bird, for it was the emblem of kings who came over the sea; and seven gems of adamant were set in the circlet, and upon its summit was set a single jewel the light of which went up like a flame.
then aragorn took the crown and held it up and said:
et eärello endorenna utúlien. sinome maruvan ar hildinyar tenn’ ambar-metta!
and those were the words that elendil spoke when he came up out of the sea on the wings of the wind: ‘out of the great sea to middle-earth i am come. in this place will i abide, and my heirs, unto the ending of the world.’
then to the wonder of many aragorn did not put the crown upon his head, but gave it back to faramir, and said: ‘by the labour and valour of many i ha

then frodo came forward and took the crown from faramir and bore it to gandalf; and aragorn knelt, and gandalf set the white crown upon his head, and said:
‘now come the days of the king, and may they be blessed while the thrones of the valar endure!’
but when aragorn arose all that beheld him gazed in silence, for it seemed to them that he was revealed to them now for the first time. tall as the sea-kings of old, he stood above all that were near; ancient of days he seemed and yet in the flower of manhood; and wisdom sat upon his brow, and strength and healing were in his hands,

lood left beregond’s face, and he was stricken to the heart and bowed his head. but the king said.:
‘so it must be, for you are appointed to the white company, the guard of faramir, prince of ithilien, and you shall be its captain and dwell in emyn arnen in honour and peace, and in the service of him for whom you risked all, to save him from death.’
and then beregond, perceiving the mercy and justice of the king, was glad, and kneeling kissed his hand, and departed in joy and content. and aragorn gave to faramir ithilien to be his princedom, and bade him dwell in the hills of emyn arnen within sight of the city.
‘for,’ said he, ‘minas ithil in morgul vale shall be utterly destroyed, and though it may in time to come be made clean, no man may dwell there for many long years.’
and last of all aragorn greeted éomer of rohan, and they embraced, and aragorn said: ‘between us there can be no word of giving or taking, nor of reward; for we are brethren. in happy hour did eorl ride f

the hobbits still remained in minas tirith, with legolas and gimli; for aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. ‘at last all such things must end,’ he said, ‘but i would have you wait a little while longer: for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. a day draws near that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood, and when it comes i would have my friends beside me.’ but of that day he would say no more.
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house with gandalf, and they went to and fro as they w

‘as for bilbo,’ said gandalf, ‘he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you. and as for the passing of the days, it is now only may and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if an age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year since you set out.’
‘pippin,’ said

 frodo, ‘didn’t you say that gandalf was less close than of old? he was weary of his labours then, i think. now he is recovering.’
and gandalf said: ‘many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder. and aragorn himself waits for a sign.’
there came a day when gandalf could not be found, and the companions wondered what was going forward. but gandalf took aragorn out from the city by night, and he brought him to the southern feet of mount mindolluin; and there they found a path made in ages past that few now dared to tread. for it led up on to the mountain to a high hallow where only the kings had been wont to go. and they went up by steep ways, until they came to a high field below the snows that cl

‘i know it well, dear friend,’ said aragorn; ‘but i would still have your counsel.’
‘not for long now,’ said gandalf. ‘the third age was my age. i was the enemy of sauron; and my work is finished. i shall go soon. the burden must lie now upon you and your kindred.’
‘but i shall die,’ said aragorn. ‘for i am a mortal man, and though being what i am and of the race of the west unmingled, i shall have life far longer than other men, yet that is but a little while; and when those who are now in the wombs of women are born a

‘turn your face from the green world, and look where all seems barren and cold!’ said gandalf.
then aragorn turned. and there was a stony slope behind him running down from the skirts of the snow; and as he looked he was aware that alone there in the waste a growing thing stood. and he climbed to it, and saw that out of the very edge of the snow there sprang a sapling tree no more than three foot high. already it had put forth young leaves long and shapely, dark above and silver beneath, and upon its slender crown it bore one small cluster of flowers whose white petals shone like the sunlit snow.

and gandalf coming looked at it, and said: ‘verily this is a sapling of the line of nimloth the fair; and that was a seedling of galathilion, and that a fruit of telperion of many names, eldest of trees. who shall say how it comes here in the appointed hour? but this is an ancient hallow, and ere the kings failed or the tree withered in t

then aragorn laid his hand gently to the sapling, and lo! it seemed to hold only lightly to the earth, and it was removed without hurt; and aragorn bore it back to the citadel. then the withered tree was uprooted, but with reverence; and they did not burn it, but laid it to rest in the silence of rath dínen. and aragorn planted the new tree in the court by the fountain, and swiftly and gladly it began to grow; and when the month of june entered in it was laden with blossom.

then the king welcomed his guests, and they alighted; and elrond surrendered the sceptre, and laid the hand of his daughter in the hand of the king, and together they went up into the high city, and all the stars flowered in the sky. and aragorn the king elessar wedded arwen undómiel in the city of the kings upon the day of midsummer, and the tale of their long waiting and labours was come to fulfilment.

when the days of rejoicing were over at last the companions thought of returning to their own homes. and frodo went to the king as he was sitting with the queen arwen by the fountain, and she sang a song of valinor, while the tree grew and blossomed. they welcomed frodo and rose to greet him; and aragorn sai

‘do you wonder at that, ring-bearer?’ said arwen. ‘for you know the power of that thing which is now destroyed; and all that was done by that power is now passing away. but your kinsman possessed this thing longer than you. he is ancient in years now, according to his kind; and he awaits you, for he will not again make any long journey save one.’
‘then i beg leave to depart soon,’ said frodo.
‘in seven days we will go,’ said aragorn. ‘for we shall ride with you far on the road, even as far as the country of rohan. in three days now éomer will return hither to bear théoden back to rest in the mark, and we shall ride with him to honour the fallen. but now before you go i will confirm the words that faramir spoke to you, and you are made free for ever of the realm of gondor; and all your companions likewise. and if there were any gifts that i could give to match with your deeds you should have them; but whatever you desir

for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with théoden thengel’s son to the land of his home.

‘behold the king elessar is come! the forest of drúadan he gives to ghân-buri-ghân and to his folk, to be their own for ever; and hereafter let no man enter it without their leave!’
then the drums rolled loudly, and were silent.

and faramir and éowyn stood forth and set hand in hand; and all there drank to them and were glad. ‘thus,’ said éomer, ‘is the friendship of the mark and of gondor bound with a new bond, and the more do i rejoice.’
‘no niggard are you, éomer,’ said aragorn, ‘to give thus to gondor the fairest thing in your realm!’
then éowyn looked in the eyes of aragorn, and she said: ‘wish me joy, my liege-lord and healer!’
and he answered: ‘i have wished thee joy ever since first i saw thee. it heals my heart to see thee now in bliss.’
when the feast was over, those who were to go took leave of king éomer. aragorn and his knights, and the people of lórien and of rivendell, made ready to ride; but faramir and imrahil remained at edoras; and arwen

‘and these same foul creatures were more than surprised to meet us out on the wold, for they had not heard of us before; though that might be said also of better folk. and not many will remember us, for not many escaped us alive, and the river had most of those. but it was well for you, for if they had not met us, then the king of the grassland would not have ridden far, and if he had there would have been no home to return to.’
‘we know it well,’ said aragorn, ‘and never shall it be forgotten in minas tirith or in edoras.’
‘never is too long a word even for me,’ said treebeard. ‘not while your kingdoms last, you mean; but they will have to last long indeed to seem long to ents.’
‘the new age begins,’ said gandalf, ‘and in this age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you, fangorn my friend. but now come tell me: what of the task that i set you? how is saruman? is he not weary of orthanc yet? for i do not suppose

‘you may be right,’ said gandalf; ‘but this snake had still one tooth left, i think. he had the poison of his voice, and i guess that he persuaded you, even you treebeard, knowing the soft spot in your heart. well, he is gone, and there is no more to be said. but the tower of orthanc now goes back to the king, to whom it belongs. though maybe he will not need it.’
‘that will be seen later,’ said aragorn. ‘but i will give to ents all this valley to do with as they will, so long as they keep a watch upon orthanc and see that none enter it without my leave.’
‘it is locked,’ said treebeard. ‘i made saruman lock it and give me the keys. quickbeam has them.’
quickbeam bowed like a tree bending in the wind and handed to aragorn two great black keys of intricate shape, joined by a ring of steel. ‘now i thank you once more,’ said aragorn, ‘and i bid you farewell. may your forest grow

treebeard’s face became sad. ‘forests may grow,’ he said. ‘woods may spread. but not ents. there are no entings.’
‘yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,’ said aragorn. ‘lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.’
but treebeard shook his head and said: ‘it is far to go. and there are too many men there in these days. but i am forgetting my manners! will you stay here and rest a while? and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so shorten their road home?’ he looked at celeborn and galadriel.
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart, either south or west. ‘com

e, gimli!’ said legolas. ‘now by fangorn’s leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in middle-earth. you shall come with me and keep your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond.’ to this gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.
‘here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the ring,’ said aragorn. ‘yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help that you promised.’
‘we will come, if our own lords allow it,’ said gimli. ‘well, farewell. my hobbits! you should come safe to your own homes now, and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril. we will send word when we may, and some of us may yet meet at times; but i fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever again.’
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed three times sl

‘well, good-bye!’ he said. ‘and don’t forget that if you hear any news of the entwives in your land, you will send word to me.’ then he waved his great hands to all the company and went off into the trees.
the travellers now rode with more speed, and they made their way towards the gap of rohan; and aragorn took leave of them at last close to that very place where pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc. the hobbits were grieved at this parting; for aragorn had never failed them and he had been their guide through many perils.
‘i wish we could have a stone that we could see all our friends in,’ said pippin, ‘and that we could speak to them from far away!’
‘only one now remains that you could use,’ answered aragorn for you would not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would s

then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel; and the lady said to him: ‘elfstone, through darkness you have come to your hope, and have now all your desire. use well the days!’
but celeborn said: ‘kinsman, farewell! may your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!’
with that they parted, and it was then the time of sunset; and when after a while they turned and looked back, they saw the king of the west sitting upon his horse with his knights about him; and the f

soon the dwindling company, following the isen, turned west and rode through the gap into the waste lands beyond, and then they turned northwards, and passed over the borders of dunland. the dunlendings fled and hid themselves, for they were afraid of elvish folk, though few indeed ever came to their country; but the travellers did not heed them, for they were still a great company and were well provided with all th

 he seldom failed to wake up in time for them. sitting round the fire they told him in turn all that they could remember of their journeys and adventures. at first he pretended to take some notes; but he often fell asleep; and when he woke he would say: ‘how splendid! how wonderful! but where were we?’ then they went on with the story from the point where he had begun to nod.
the only part that seemed really to rouse him and hold his attention was the account of the crowning and marriage of aragorn. ‘i was invited to the wedding of course,’ he said. ‘and i have waited for it long enough. but somehow, when it came to it, i found i had so much to do here; and packing is such a bother.’
when nearly a fortnight had passed frodo looked out of his window and saw that there had been a frost in the night, and the cobwebs were like white nets. then suddenly he knew that he must go, and say good-bye to bilbo. the weather was still calm and fair, after one of the most lovely summers that peo
