neat, his clothes are dirty and much slept in. his gray flannel shirt, open at the neck, has the appearance of having never been washed. from the way he methodically scratches himself with his long-fingered, hairy hands, he is lousy and reconciled to being so. he is the only occupant of the room who is not asleep. he stares in front of him, an expression of tired tolerance giving his face the quality of a pitying but weary old priest's.

all four chairs at the middle table, front, are occupied. joe mott sits at left front of the table, facing front. behind him, facing right-front, is piet wetjoen ("the general"). at center of the table, rear, james cameron ("jimmy tomorrow") sits facing front. at right of table, opposite joe, is cecil lewis ("the captain").

joe mott is a negro, about fifty years old, brown-skinned, stocky, wearing a light suit that had once been flashily sporty but is now about to fall apart. his pointed tan buttoned shoes, faded pink shirt and bright tie belong to the same v

owing the bottle to larry--indignantly) jees, look! he's killed a half pint or more! (he turns on willie angrily, but willie has closed his eyes and is sitting quietly, shuddering, waiting for the effect.)

larry--(with a pitying glance) leave him be, the poor devil. a half pint of that dynamite in one swig will fix him for a while--if it doesn't kill him.

rocky--(shrugs his shoulders and sits down again) aw right by me. it ain't my booze. (behind him, in the chair at left of the middle table, joe mott, the negro, has been waking up.)

joe--(his eyes blinking sleepily) whose booze? gimme some. i don't care whose. where's hickey? ain't he come yet? what time's it, rocky?

rocky--gettin' near time to open up. time you begun to sweep up in de bar.

joe--(lazily) never mind de time. if hickey ain't come, it's time joe goes to sleep again. i was dreamin' hickey come in de door, crackin' one of dem drummer's jokes, wavin' a big bankroll and we was all goin' be drunk for two weeks. wake up and no lu

folk ballad which i picked up at harvard amid the debris of education. (he sings in a boisterous baritone, rapping on the table with his knuckles at the indicated spots in the song.)



"jack, oh, jack, was a sailor lad
and he came to a tavern for gin.
he rapped and he rapped with a (rap, rap, rap)
but never a soul seemed in."



(the drunks at the tables stir. rocky gets up from his chair in the bar and starts back for the entrance to the back room. hope cocks one irritable eye over his specs. joe mott opens both of his and grins. willie interposes some drunken whimsical exposition to larry.) the origin of this beautiful ditty is veiled in mystery, larry. there was a legend bruited about in cambridge lavatories that waldo emerson composed it during his uninformative period as a minister, while he was trying to write a sermon. but my own opinion is, it goes back much further, and jonathan edwards was the author of both words and music. (he sings)



"he rapped and rapped, and tapped and tapped

of the two is impressed either by his insults or his threats. they grin hangover grins of tolerant affection at him and wink at each other. harry fumes) yeah, grin! wink, bejees! fine pair of sons of bitches to have glued on me for life! (but he can't get a rise out of them and he subsides into a fuming mumble. meanwhile, at the middle table, captain lewis and general wetjoen are as wide awake as heavy hangovers permit. jimmy tomorrow nods, his eyes blinking. lewis is gazing across the table at joe mott, who is still chuckling to himself over willie's song. the expression on lewis's face is that of one who can't believe his eyes.)

lewis--(aloud to himself with a muzzy wonder) good god! have i been drinking at the same table with a bloody kaffir?

joe--(grinning) hello, captain. you comin' up for air? kaffir? who's he?

wetjoen--(blurrily) kaffir, dot's a nigger, joe. (joe stiffens and his eyes narrow. wetjoen goes on with heavy jocosity.) dot's joke on him, joe. he don't know you. he's still

jimmy--(as if reminded of something--with a pathetic attempt at a brisk, no-more-nonsense air) tomorrow, yes. it's high time i straightened out and got down to business again. (he brushes his sleeve fastidiously.) i must have this suit cleaned and pressed. i can't look like a tramp when i--

joe--(who has been brooding--interrupts) yes, suh, white folks always said i was white. in de days when i was flush, joe mott's de only colored man dey allows in de white gamblin' houses. "you're all right, joe, you're white," dey says. (he chuckles.) wouldn't let me play craps, dough. dey know i could make dem dice behave. "any odder game and any limit you like, joe," dey says. man, de money i lost! (he chuckles--then with an underlying defensiveness) look at de big chief in dem days. he knew i was white. i'd saved my dough so i could start my own gamblin' house. folks in de know tells me, see de man at de top, den y

lordly manner to rocky.) do your duty, brother rocky. bring on the rat poison! (rocky grins and goes behind the bar to get drinks amid an approving cheer from the crowd. hickey comes forward to shake hands with hope--with affectionate heartiness) how goes it, governor?

hope--(enthusiastically) bejees, hickey, you old bastard, it's good to see you! (hickey shakes hands with mosher and mcgloin; leans right to shake hands with margie and pearl; moves to the middle table to shake hands with lewis, joe mott, wetjoen and jimmy; waves to willie, larry and hugo. he greets each by name with the same affectionate heartiness and there is an interchange of "how's the kid?" "how's the old scout?" "how's the boy?" "how's everything?" etc., etc. rocky begins setting out drinks, whiskey glasses with chasers, and a bottle for each table, starting with larry's table. hope says) sit down, hickey. sit down. (hickey takes the chair, facing front, at the front of the table in the second row which is half between h

and rocky enter carrying a big wicker basket) look! there it comes! unveil it, boys. (they pull off a covering burlap bag. the basket is piled with quarts of champagne.)

pearl--(with childish excitement) it's champagne! jees, hickey, if you ain't a sport! (she gives him a hug, forgetting all animosity, as do the other girls.)

margie--i never been soused on champagne. let's get stinko, poil.

pearl--you betcha my life! de bot' of us! (a holiday spirit of gay festivity has seized them all. even joe mott is standing up to look at the wine with an admiring grin, and hugo raises his head to blink at it.)

joe--you sure is hittin' de high spots, hickey. (boastfully) man, when i runs my gamblin' house, i drinks dat old bubbly water in steins! (he stops guiltily and gives hickey a look of defiance.) i's goin' to drink it dat way again, too, soon's i make my stake! and dat ain't no pipe dream, neider! (he sits down where he was, his back turned to them.)

rocky--what'll we drink it outa, hickey? dere

ed arrangement of act one. of these, we see one in the front row with five chairs at left of the barroom table, another with five chairs at left-rear of it, a third back by the rear wall with five chairs, and finally, at extreme left-front, one with four chairs, partly on and partly off stage, left.

it is around the middle of the morning of hope's birthday, a hot summer day. there is sunlight in the street outside, but it does not hit the windows and the light in the back-room section is dim.

joe mott is moving around, a box of sawdust under his arm, strewing it over the floor. his manner is sullen, his face set in gloom. he ignores everyone. as the scene progresses, he finishes his sawdusting job, goes behind the lunch counter and cuts loaves of bread. rocky is behind the bar, wiping it, washing glasses, etc. he wears his working clothes, sleeves rolled up. he looks sleepy, irritable and worried. at the barroom table, front, larry sits in a chair, facing right-front. he has no drink in fron
