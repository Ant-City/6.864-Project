by malcolm mcdowell
                a young hoodlum and
the antihero of the film. murderously aggressive and also good-natured
and innocent, alex is both horrible and likable. he commits numerous
acts of brutality. he speaks in a slang influenced by russian, slavic,
gypsy, shakespearean english, rhymes, and baby talk, and he addresses
the audience directly as "my brothers and only friends." he loves
classical music, particularly beethoven, though the music elicits images
of violence and depravity for him.
