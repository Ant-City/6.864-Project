the baron's lady weighed about three hundred and fifty pounds, and was therefore a person of great consideration, and she did the honours of the house with a dignity that commanded still greater respect. her daughter cunegonde was seventeen years of age, fresh-coloured, comely, plump, and desirable. the baron's son seemed to be in every respect worthy of his father. the preceptor pangloss[1] was the oracle of the family, and little candide heard his lessons with all the good faith of his age and character.

pangloss was professor of metaphysico-theologico-cosmolo-nigology. he proved admirably that there is no effect without a cause, and that, in this best of all possible worlds, the baron's castle was the most magnificent of castles, and his lady the best of all possible baronesses.

"it is demonstrable," said he, "that things cannot be otherwise than as they are; for all being

candide listened attentively and believed innocently; for he thought miss cunegonde extremely beautiful, though he never had the courage to tell her so. he concluded that after the happiness of being born of baron of thunder-ten-tronckh, the second degree of happiness was to be miss cunegonde, the third that of seeing her every day, and the fourth that of hearing master pangloss, the greatest philosopher of the whole province, and consequently of the whole world.

one day cunegonde, while walking near the castle, in a little wood which they called a park, saw between the bushes, dr. pangloss giving a lesson in experimental natural philosophy to her mother's chamber-maid, a little brown wench, very pretty and very docile. as miss cunegonde had a great disposition for the sciences, she breathlessly observed the repeated experiments of which she was a witness; she clearly

"oh, sir," said one of the blues to him, "people of your appearance and of your merit never pay anything: are you not five feet five inches high?"

"yes, sir, that is my height," answered he, making a low bow.

"come, sir, seat yourself; not only will we pay your reckoning, but we will never suffer such a man as you to want money; men are only born to assist one another."

"you are right," said candide; "this is what i was always taught by mr. pangloss, and i see plainly that all is for the best."

they begged of him to accept a few crowns. he took them, and wished to give them his note; they refused; they seated themselves at table.

"love you not deeply?"

"oh yes," answered he; "i deeply love miss cunegonde."

"no," said one of the gentlemen, "we ask you if you do not deeply love the king of the bulgarians?"

"not at all," said he; "for i have never seen him."

, heavens! to what excess does religious zeal carry the ladies.

a man who had never been christened, a good anabaptist, named james, beheld the cruel and[pg 12] ignominious treatment shown to one of his brethren, an unfeathered biped with a rational soul, he took him home, cleaned him, gave him bread and beer, presented him with two florins, and even wished to teach him the manufacture of persian stuffs which they make in holland. candide, almost prostrating himself before him, cried:

"master pangloss has well said that all is for the best in this world, for i am infinitely more touched by your extreme generosity than with the inhumanity of that gentleman in the black coat and his lady."

the next day, as he took a walk, he met a beggar all covered with scabs, his eyes diseased, the end of his nose eaten away, his mouth distorted, his teeth black, choking in his throat, tormented with a violent cough, and spitting out a tooth at each effort.[pg 13]

oss, and what happened to them.

candide, yet more moved with compassion than with horror, gave to this shocking beggar the two florins which he had received from the honest anabaptist james. the spectre looked at him very earnestly, dropped a few tears, and fell upon his neck. candide recoiled in disgust.

"alas!" said one wretch to the other, "do you no longer know your dear pangloss?"

"what do i hear? you, my dear master! you in this terrible plight! what misfortune has happened to you? why are you no longer in the most magnificent of castles? what has become of miss cunegonde, the pearl of girls, and nature's masterpiece?"

"i am so weak that i cannot stand," said pangloss.

upon which candide carried him to the anabaptist's stable, and gave him a crust of bread. as soon as pangloss had refreshed himself a little:

"well," said candide, "cunegonde?"[pg 14]

"she is dead,

" replied the other.

candide fainted at this word; his friend recalled his senses with a little bad vinegar which he found by chance in the stable. candide reopened his eyes.

"cunegonde is dead! ah, best of worlds, where art thou? but of what illness did she die? was it not for grief, upon seeing her father kick me out of his magnificent castle?"

"no," said pangloss, "she was ripped open by the bulgarian soldiers, after having been violated by many; they broke the baron's head for attempting to defend her; my lady, her mother, was cut in pieces; my poor pupil was served just in the same manner as his sister; and as for the castle, they have not left one stone upon another, not a barn, nor a sheep, nor a duck, nor a tree; but we have had our revenge, for the abares have done the very same thing to a neighbouring barony, which belonged to a bulgarian lord."

at this discourse candide fainted again; but coming to himself, and having said all that it became him to say, inquired into the cause and effect, as well as into the sufficient reason that had reduced pangloss to so miserable a plight.

"alas!" said the other, "it was love; love, the comfort of the human species, the preserver of the universe, the soul of all sensible beings, love, tender love."[pg 15]

"alas!" said candide, "i know this love, that sovereign of hearts, that soul of our souls; yet it never cost me more than a kiss and twenty kicks on the backside. how could this beautiful cause produce in you an effect so abominable?"

pangloss made answer in these terms: "oh, my dear candide, you rem

"oh, pangloss!" cried candide, "what a strange genealogy! is not the devil the original stock of it?"

"not at all," replied this great man, "it was a thing unavoidable, a necessary ingredient in the best of worlds; for if columbus had not in an island of america caught this disease, which contaminates the source of life, frequently even[pg 16] hinders generation, and which is evidently opposed to the great end of nature, we should have neither chocolate nor cochineal. we are also to observe that upon our co

"well, this is wonderful!" said candide, "but you must get cured."

"alas! how can i?" said pangloss, "i have not a farthing, my friend, and all over the globe there is no letting of blood or taking a glister, without paying, or somebody paying for you."

these last words determined candide; he went and flung himself at the feet of the charitable anabaptist james, and gave him so touching a picture of the state to which his friend was reduced, that the good man did not scruple to take dr. pangloss into his house, and had[pg 17] him cured at his expense. in the cure pangloss lost only an eye an

"it is more likely," said he, "mankind have a little corrupted nature, for they were not born wolves, and they have become wolves; god has given them neither cannon of four-and-twenty pounders, nor bayonets; and yet they have made cannon and bayonets to destroy one another. into this account i might throw not only bankrupts, but justice which seizes on the effects of bankrupts to chea

"all this was indispensable," replied the one-eyed doctor, "for private misfortunes make the general good, so that the more private misfortunes there are the greater is the general good."

"what can be the sufficient reason of this phenomenon?" said pangloss.

"this is the last day!" cried candide.

the sailor ran among the ruins, facing death to find money; finding it, he took it, got drunk,[pg 20] and having slept himself sober, purchased the favours of the first good-natured wench whom he met on the ruins of the destroyed houses, and in the midst of the dying and the dead. pangloss pulled him by the sleeve.

some falling stones had wounded candide. he lay stretched in the street covered with rubbish.

"alas!" said he to pangloss, "get me a little wine and oil; i am dying."

"this concussion of the earth is no new thing," answered pangloss. "the city of lima, in america, experienced the same convulsions last year; the same cause, the same effects; there is certainly a train of sulphur under ground from lima to lisbon."

"nothing more probable," said candide; "but for the love of god a little oil and wine."

"how, probable?" replied the philosopher. "i maintain that the point is capable of being demonstrated."

candide fainted away, and pangloss fetched[pg 21] him some water from a neighbouring fountain. the following day they rum

"for," said he, "all that is is for the best. if there is a volcano at lisbon it cannot be elsewhere. it is impossible that things should be other than they are; for everything is right."

a little man dressed in black, familiar of the inquisition, who sat by him, politely took up his word and said:

"your excellency will excuse me," said pangloss;[pg 22] "liberty is consistent with absolute necessity, for it was necessary we should be free; for, in short, the determinate will——"

pangloss was in the middle of his sentence, when the familiar beckoned to his footman, who gave him a glass of wine from porto or opporto.[pg 23]

candide, terrified, amazed, desperate, all bloody, all palpitating, said to himself:

"what, is it you?" said candide, "you live? i find you again in portugal? then you have not been ravished? then they did not rip open your belly as doctor pangloss informed me?"

"yes, they did," said the beautiful cunegonde; "but those two accidents are not always mortal."

"but were your father and mother killed?"

"it is but too true," answered cunegonde, in tears.

"and your brother?"

"my brother also was killed."

"and why are you in portugal? and how did you know of my being here? and by what strange adventure did you contrive to bring me to this house?"

candide respectfully obeyed her, and though he was still in a surprise, though his voice was feeble and trembling, though his back still pained him, yet he gave her a most ingenuous account of everything that had befallen him since the moment of their separation. cunegonde lifted up her eyes to heaven; shed tears upon hearing of the death of the good anabaptist and of pangloss; after which she spoke as follows to candide, who did not lose a word and devoured her with his eyes.[pg 30]

the history of cunegonde.

"i was in bed and fast asleep when it pleased god to send the bulgarians to our delightful castle of thunder-ten-tronckh; they slew my father and brother, and cut my mother in pieces. a tall bulgarian, six feet high, perceiving that i had fainted away at this sight, began to ravish me; this made me recover; i regained my senses, i cried, i struggled, i b

"agitated, lost, sometimes beside myself, and sometimes ready to die of weakness, my mind was filled with the massacre of my father, mother, and brother, with the insolence of the ugly bulgarian soldier, with the stab that he gave me, with my servitude under the bulgarian captain, with my hideous don issachar, with my abominable inquisitor, with the execution of doctor pangloss, with the grand miserere to[pg 34

"holy virgin!" cried she, "what will become of us? a man killed in my apartment! if the officers of justice come, we are lost!"

"had not pangloss been hanged," said candide, "he would give us good counsel in this[pg 36] emergency, for he was a profound philosopher. failing him let us consult the old woman."

"who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels?" said cunegonde, all bathed in tears. "how shall we live? what shall we do? where find inquisitors or jews who will give me more?"

"alas!" said the old woman, "i have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend grey friar, who stayed last night in the same inn with us at badajos. god preserve me from judging rashly, but he came into our room twice, and he set out upon his journey long before us."

"alas!" said candide, "dear pangloss has often demonstrated to me that the goods of this world are common to all men, and that each has an equal right to them. but according to these principles the grey friar ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. have you nothing at all left, my dear cunegonde?"

"not a farthing," said she.

"what then must we do?" said candide.

during their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor pangloss.

"we are going into another world," said candide; "and surely it must be there that all is for the best. for i must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in[pg 40] our world in regard to both natural and moral philosophy."

"i love you with all my heart," said cunegonde; "but my soul is still full of fright at that which i have seen and experienced."

how candide was forced away from his fair cunegonde and the old woman.

the beautiful cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her all the civilities due to a person of her rank and merit. she likewise accepted her proposal, and engaged all the passengers, one after the other, to relate their adventures; and then both she and candide allowed that the old woman was in the right.

"it is a great pity," said candide, "that the sage pangloss was hanged contrary to custom at an auto-da-fé; he would tell us most amazing things in regard to the physical and moral evils that overspread earth and sea, and i should be able, with due respect, to make a few objections."

while each passenger was recounting his story, the ship made her way. they landed at buenos ayres. cunegonde, captain candide, and the old woman, waited on the governor, don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza. this nobleman had a statelines

"oh! heavens! is it possible?" cried the commandant.

"what a miracle!" cried candide.

"is it really you?" said the commandant.

"it is not possible!" said candide.

they drew back; they embraced; they shed rivulets of tears.

"what, is it you, reverend father? you, the brother of the fair cunegonde! you, that was slain by the bulgarians! you, the baron's son! you, a jesuit in paraguay! i must confess this is a strange world that we live in. oh, pangloss! pangloss! how glad you would be if you had not been hanged!"

the commandant sent away the negro slaves and the paraguayans, who served them with[pg 63] liquors in goblets of rock-crystal. he thanked god and st. ignatius a thousand times; he clasped candide in his arms; and their faces were all bathed with tears.

"you will be more surprised, more affected, and transported," said candide, "when i tell you that cunegonde, your sister, whom you believe to have been ripped open, is in perfect hea

"you insolent!" replied the baron, "would you have the impudence to marry my sister who has seventy-two quarterings! i find thou hast[pg 66] the most consummate effrontery to dare to mention so presumptuous a design!"

candide, petrified at this speech, made answer:

"reverend father, all the quarterings in the world signify nothing; i rescued your sister from the arms of a jew and of an inquisitor; she has great obligations to me, she wishes to marry me; master pangloss always told me that all men are equal, and certainly i will marry her."

"we shall see that, thou scoundrel!" said the jesuit baron de thunder-ten-tronckh, and that instant struck him across the face with the flat of his sword. candide in an instant drew his rapier, and plunged it up to the hilt in the jesuit's belly; but in pulling it out reeking hot, he burst into tears.

"the sweethearts! is it possible? you are jesting, cacambo, i can never believe it!"

"dear master," replied cacambo; "you are surprised at everything. why should you think it so strange that in some countries there are monkeys which insinuate themselves into the good graces of the ladies; they are a fourth part human, as i am a fourth part spaniard."

"alas!" replied candide, "i remember to have heard master pangloss say, that formerly such accidents used to happen; that these mixtures were productive of centaurs, fauns, and satyrs; and that many of the ancients had seen such monsters, but i looked upon the whole as fabulous."

"you ought now to be convinced," said cacambo, "that it is the truth, and you see what use is made of those creatures, by persons that have not had a proper education; all i fear is that those ladies will play us some ugly trick."

these sound reflections induced candide to leave the

"a jesuit! a jesuit! we shall be revenged, we shall have excellent cheer, let us eat the jesuit, let us eat him up!"

"i told you, my dear master," cried cacambo sadly, "that those two girls would play us some ugly trick."

candide seeing the cauldron and the spits, cried:

"we are certainly going to be either roasted or boiled. ah! what would master pangloss say, were he to see how pure nature is formed? everything is right, may be, but i declare it is very hard to have lost miss cunegonde and to be put upon a spit by oreillons."

cacambo never lost his head.

"do not despair," said he to the disconsolate candide, "i understand a little of the jargon of these people, i will speak to them."

"be sure," said candide, "to represent to them[pg 72] how frightfully inhuman it is to cook men, and how very un-christian."

"gentlemen," said cacambo, "you re

cacambo explained this whole discourse with great astonishment to candide, who was as greatly astonished to hear it.

"what sort of a country then is this," said they to one another; "a country unknown to all the rest of the world, and where nature is of a kind so different from ours? it is probably the country where all is well; for there absolutely must be one such place. and, whatever master pangloss might say, i often found that things went very ill in westphalia."[pg 80]

cacambo expressed his curiosity to the landlord, who made answer:

"i am very ignorant, but not the worse on that account. however, we have in this neighbourhood an old man retired from court who is the most learned and most communicative person in the kingdom."

at once he took cacambo to the old man. candide acted now only a second character, and accompanied his valet.

"what! have you no monks who teach, who dispute, who govern, who cabal, and who burn people that are not of their opinion?"

"we must be mad, indeed, if that were the case," said the old man; "here we are all of one opinion, and we know not what you mean by monks."

during this whole discourse candide was in raptures, and he said to himself:

"this is vastly different from westphalia and the baron's castle. had our friend pangloss seen el dorado he would no longer have said that the castle of thunder-ten-tronckh was the finest upon earth. it is evident that one must travel."

after this long conversation the old man ordered a coach and six sheep to be got ready, and twelve of his domestics to conduct the travellers to court.

"oh, pangloss!" cried candide, "thou hadst not guessed at this abomination; it is the end. i must at last renounce thy optimism."

"what is this optimism?" said cacambo.

they sat until four o'clock in the morning. candide, in listening to all their adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in their voyage to buenos ayres, and of her wager that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. he dreamed of pangloss at every adventure told to him.

"this pangloss," said he, "would be puzzled to demonstrate his system. i wish that he were here. certainly, if all things are good, it is in el dorado and not in the rest of the world."

at length he made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten years for the booksellers of amsterdam. he judged that there was not in the whole world a trade which could disgust one more.

ne great advantage over martin, in that he always hoped to see miss cunegonde; whereas martin had nothing at all to hope. besides, candide was possessed of money and jewels, and though he had lost one hundred large red sheep, laden with the greatest treasure upon earth; though the knavery of the dutch skipper still sat heavy upon his mind; yet when he reflected upon what he had still left, and when he mentioned the name of cunegonde, especially towards the latter end of a repast, he inclined to pangloss's doctrine.

"but you, mr. martin," said he to the philosopher,[pg 99] "what do you think of all this? what are your ideas on moral and natural evil?"

"sir," answered martin, "our priests accused me of being a socinian, but the real fact is i am a manichean."[21]

"you jest," said candide; "there are no longer manicheans in the world."

"i am one," said martin. "i cannot help it; i know not how to think otherwise."

"surely you must be possessed by the devil," said candide.

"he is a scholar," said the lady, "who does not play, whom the abbé sometimes brings to supper; he is perfectly at home among tragedies and books, and he has written a tragedy which was hissed, and a book of which nothing has[pg 114] ever been seen outside his bookseller's shop excepting the copy which he dedicated to me."

"the great man!" said candide. "he is another pangloss!"

then, turning towards him, he said:

"sir, you think doubtless that all is for the best in the moral and physical world, and that nothing could be otherwise than it is?"

"i, sir!" answered the scholar, "i know nothing of all that; i find that all goes awry with me; that no one knows either what is his rank, nor what is his condition, what he does nor what he ought to do; and that except supper, which is always gay, and where there appears to be enough concord, all the rest of the time is pa

candide and martin touched upon the coast of england, and what they saw there.

"ah, pangloss! pangloss! ah, martin! martin! ah, my dear cunegonde, what sort of a world is this?" said candide on board the dutch ship.

"something very foolish and abominable," said martin.

"you know england? are they as foolish there as in france?"

"it is another kind of folly," said martin. "you know that these two nations are at war for a few acres of snow in canada,[31] and that they spend over this beautiful war much more than canada is worth. to tell you exactly, whether there are more people fit t

"ah! mr. candide does not know paquette again."

candide had not viewed her as yet with attention, his thoughts being entirely taken up with cunegonde; but recollecting her as she spoke.

"alas!" said he, "my poor child, it is you who reduced doctor pangloss to the beautiful condition in which i saw him?"

"alas! it was i, sir, indeed," answered paquette. "i see that you have heard all. i have been informed of the frightful disasters that befell the family of my lady baroness, and[pg 128] the fair cunegonde. i swear to you that my fate has been scarcely less sad. i was very innocent when you knew me. a grey friar, who was my confessor, easily seduced me. the consequences were terrible. i was obliged to quit the castle some time after the baron had

candide disputed the point a little, but with discretion. martin was entirely of the senator's opinion.

"there," said he, "is a book that was once the delight of the great pangloss, the best philosopher in germany."

"it is not mine," answered pococurante coolly. "they used at one time to make me believe that i took a pleasure in reading him. but that continual repetition of battles, so extremely like one another; those gods that are always active without doing anything decisive; that helen who is the cause of the war, and who yet scarcely appears[pg 136] in the piece; that troy, so long besieged without being taken; all these together caused me great weariness. i have so

"you see," said candide to martin on the way, "we supped with six dethroned kings, and of those six there was one to whom i gave charity. perhaps there are many other princes yet more unfortunate. for my part, i have only lost a hundred sheep; and now i am flying into cunegonde's arms. my dear martin, yet once more pangloss was right: all is for the best."

"i wish it," answered martin.

"but," said candide, "it was a very strange adventure we met with at venice. it has never before been seen or heard that six dethroned kings have supped together at a public inn."

"it is not more extraordinary," said martin, "than most of the things that have happened to us. it is a very common thing for kings to be[pg 149] dethroned; and as for the honour we have had of supping in their company, it is a trifle not worth our atte

"what a series of shocking calamities!" cried candide. "but after all, i have some diamonds left; and i may easily pay cunegonde's ransom. yet it is a pity that she is grown so ugly."

then, turning towards martin: "who do you think," said he, "is most to be pitied—the sultan achmet, the emperor ivan, king charles edward, or i?"

"how should i know!" answered martin. "i must see into your hearts to be able to tell."

"ah!" said candide, "if pangloss were here, he could tell."

"i know not," said martin, "in what sort of scales your pangloss would weigh the misfortunes of mankind and set a just estimate on their sorrows. all that i can presume to say is, that there are millions of people upon earth who have a hundred times more to complain of than king charles edward, the emperor ivan, or the sultan achmet."

"that may well be," said candide.

on board a galley, in order to search on the banks of the propontis for his cunegonde, however ugly she might have become.

among the crew there were two slaves who rowed very badly, and to whose bare shoulders the levantine captain would now and then apply blows from a bull's pizzle. candide, from a natural impulse, looked at these two slaves more attentively than at the other oarsmen, and approached them with pity. their features though greatly disfigured, had a slight resemblance to those of pangloss and the unhappy jesuit and westphalian baron, brother to miss cunegonde. this moved and saddened him. he looked at them still more attentively.

"indeed," said he to cacambo, "if i had not seen master pangloss hanged, and if i had not had the misfortune to kill the baron, i should think it was they that were rowing."

at the names of the baron and of pangloss, the two galley-slaves uttered a loud cry, held fast by the seat, and let drop their oars. the captain ran up to them and redoubled his b

"stop! stop! sir," cried candide. "i will give you what money you please."[pg 152]

"what! it is candide!" said one of the slaves.

"what! it is candide!" said the other.

"do i dream?" cried candide; "am i awake? or am i on board a galley? is this the baron whom i killed? is this master pangloss whom i saw hanged?"

"it is we! it is we!" answered they.

"well! is this the great philosopher?" said martin.

"ah! captain," said candide, "what ransom will you take for monsieur de thunder-ten-tronckh, one of the first barons of the empire, and for monsieur pangloss, the profoundest metaphysician in germany?"

"dog of a christian," answered the levantine captain, "since these two dogs of christian slaves are barons and metaphysicians, which i doubt not are high dignities in their country, yo

u shall give me fifty thousand sequins."

"you shall have them, sir. carry me back at once to constantinople, and you shall receive the money directly. but no; carry me first to miss cunegonde."

upon the first proposal made by candide, however, the levantine captain had already tacked about, and made the crew ply their oars quicker than a bird cleaves the air.

candide embraced the baron and pangloss a hundred times.

"and how happened it, my dear baron, that[pg 153] i did not kill you? and, my dear pangloss, how came you to life again after being hanged? and why are you both in a turkish galley?"

"and it is true that my dear sister is in this country?" said the baron.

"yes," answered cacambo.

"then i behold, once more, my dear candide," cried pangloss.

"but is it indeed possible that my sister can be in turkey?" said he.

"nothing is more possible," said cacambo, "since she scours the dishes in the service of a transylvanian prince."

"say no more about it," answered the baron. "i was a little too hasty, i own, but since you wish to know by what fatality i came to be a galley-slave i will inform you. after i had been cured by the surgeon of the college of the wound you gave me, i was attacked and carried off by a party of spanish troops, who confined me in prison at buenos ayres at th

"but you, my dear pangloss," said candide, "how can it be that i behold you again?"

"it is true," said pangloss, "that you saw me hanged. i should have been burnt, but you may remember it rained exceedingly hard when they were going to roast me; the storm was so violent that they despaired of lighting the fire, so i was hanged because they could do no better. a surgeon purchased my body, carried me home, and dissected me. he began with making a crucial incision on me from the navel to the clavicula. one could not have b

"well, my dear pangloss," said candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"

"i am still of my first opinion," answered pangloss, "for i am a philosopher and i cannot[pg 158] retract, especially as leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."[pg 159]

while candide, the baron, pangloss, martin, and cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the banks of the propontis. the first objects which met their sight were cunegonde and the old woman hanging towels out to dry.

"thou mayest kill me again," said the baron, "but thou shalt not marry my sister, at least whilst i am living."[pg 161]

the conclusion.

at the bottom of his heart candide had no wish to marry cunegonde. but the extreme impertinence of the baron determined him to conclude the match, and cunegonde pressed him so strongly that he could not go from his word. he consulted pangloss, martin, and the faithful cacambo. pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the baron had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she might marry candide with her left hand. martin was for throwing the baron into the sea; cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship. this advice was well

received, the old woman approved it; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a jesuit, and punishing the pride of a german baron.[pg 162]

it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married, and living with the philosopher pangloss, the philosopher martin, the prudent cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas, must have led a very happy life. but he was so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde. cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to constantinople, was fatigued with

hard work, and cursed his destiny. pangloss was in despair at not shining in some german university. for martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. candide, martin, and pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics. they often saw passing under the windows of their farm boats full of effendis, pashas, and cadis, who were going into banishment to lemnos, mitylene, or erzeroum. and they saw other cadis, pashas, and effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their turn. they saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the sublime porte. such spectacles as these increased the number[pg 163] of their dissertations; and when the

un the gauntlet among the bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an auto-da-fé, to be dissected, to row in the galleys—in short, to go through all the miseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?"

"it is a great question," said candide.

this discourse gave rise to new reflections, and martin especially concluded that man was born to live either in a state of distracting inquietude or of lethargic disgust. candide did not quite agree to that, but he affirmed nothing. pangloss owned that he had always suffered horribly, but as he had once asserted that everything went wonderfully well, he asserted it still, though he no longer believed it.

what helped to confirm martin in his detestable principles, to stagger candide more than ever, and to puzzle pangloss, was that one day they saw paquette and friar giroflée land at the farm in extreme misery. they had soon squandered their three thousand piastres, parted, were reconciled, quarrelled again, were thrown[pg 164] int

o gaol, had escaped, and friar giroflée had at length become turk. paquette continued her trade wherever she went, but made nothing of it.

"i foresaw," said martin to candide, "that your presents would soon be dissipated, and only make them the more miserable. you have rolled in millions of money, you and cacambo; and yet you are not happier than friar giroflée and paquette."

"ha!" said pangloss to paquette, "providence has then brought you amongst us again, my poor child! do you know that you cost me the tip of my nose, an eye, and an ear, as you may see? what a world is this!"

and now this new adventure set them philosophising more than ever.

in the neighbourhood there lived a very famous dervish who was esteemed the best philosopher in all turkey, and they went to consult him. pangloss was the speaker.

"master," said he, "we come to beg you to tell why so strange an animal as man

 was made."

"with what meddlest thou?" said the dervish; "is it thy business?"

"but, reverend father," said candide, "there is horrible evil in this world."

"what signifies it," said the dervish, "whether there be evil or good? when his highness sends[pg 165] a ship to egypt, does he trouble his head whether the mice on board are at their ease or not?"

"what, then, must we do?" said pangloss.

"hold your tongue," answered the dervish.

"i was in hopes," said pangloss, "that i should reason with you a little about causes and effects, about the best of possible worlds, the origin of evil, the nature of the soul, and the pre-established harmony."

at these words, the dervish shut the door in their faces.

during this conversation, the news was spread that two viziers and the mufti had been strangled at constantinople, and that several of their friends had been impaled. this catastrophe made a great noise for some hours. pangloss, candide, and martin, returning

 to the little farm, saw a good old man taking the fresh air at his door under an orange bower. pangloss, who was as inquisitive as he was argumentative, asked the old man what was the name of the strangled mufti.

"i do not know," answered the worthy man, "and i have not known the name of any mufti, nor of any vizier. i am entirely ignorant of the event you mention; i presume in general that they who meddle with the administration of public affairs die sometimes miserably, and that they deserve it; but i never trouble my head[pg 166] about what is transacting at constantinople; i content myself w

rated with the bad coffee of batavia or the american islands. after which the two daughters of the honest mussulman perfumed the strangers' beards.

"you must have a vast and magnificent estate," said candide to the turk.

"i have only twenty acres," replied the old man; "i and my children cultivate them; our labour preserves us from three great evils—weariness, vice, and want."

candide, on his way home, made profound reflections on the old man's conversation.

"this honest turk," said he to pangloss and martin, "seems to be in a situation far preferable to that of the six kings with whom we had the honour of supping."

"grandeur," said pangloss, "is extremely dangerous according to the testimony of philosophers. for, in short, eglon, king of moab,[pg 167] was assassinated by ehud; absalom was hung by his hair, and pierced with three darts; king nadab, the son of jeroboam, was killed by baasa; king ela by zimri; ahaziah by jehu; athaliah by jehoiada; the kings jehoiakim, jeconiah, and zedek

"i know also," said candide, "that we must cultivate our garden."

"you are right," said pangloss, "for when man was first placed in the garden of eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, that he might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."

"let us work," said martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable."

the whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent pastry cook; paquette w

"all that is very well," answered candide, "but let us
