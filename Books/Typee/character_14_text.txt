 from the chase.

this incident opened my eyes to a new danger; and i now felt convinced
that in some luckless hour i should be disfigured in such a manner as
never more to have the face to return to my countrymen, even should an
opportunity offer.

these apprehensions were greatly increased by the desire which king
mehevi and several of the inferior chiefs now manifested that i should
be tattooed. the pleasure of the king was first signified to me some
three days after my casual encounter with karky the artist. heavens!
what imprecations i showered upon that karky. doubtless he had plotted a
conspiracy against me and my countenance, and would never rest until his
diabolical purpose was accomplished. several times i met him in various
parts of the valley, and, invariably, whenever he descried me, he came
running after me with his mallet and chisel, flourishing them about my
face as if he longed to begin. what an object he would have made of me!

when the king first expressed his wish to me,

ared my willingness to have both
arms tattooed from just above the wrist to the shoulder. his majesty was
greatly pleased at the proposition, and i was congratulating myself with
having thus compromised the matter, when he intimated that as a thing of
course my face was first to undergo the operation. i was fairly driven
to despair; nothing but the utter ruin of my ‘face divine’, as the
poets call it, would, i perceived, satisfy the inexorable mehevi and his
chiefs, or rather, that infernal karky, for he was at the bottom of it
all.

the only consolation afforded me was a choice of patterns: i was at
perfect liberty to have my face spanned by three horizontal bars, after
the fashion of my serving-man’s; or to have as many oblique stripes
slanting across it; or if, like a true courtier, i chose to model my
style on that of royalty, i might wear a sort of freemason badge upon
my countenance in the shape of a mystic triangle. however, i would have
none of these, though the king most earn

diffusing the sweetest perfume. this elegant little odorous globe would
not be out of place even upon the toilette of a queen. its merits as a
preparation for the hair are undeniable--it imparts to it a superb gloss
and a silky fineness.

apprehensions of evil--frightful discovery--some remarks
on cannibalism--second battle with the happars--savage
spectacle--mysterious feast--subsequent disclosures

from the time of my casual encounter with karky the artist, my life was
one of absolute wretchedness. not a day passed but i was persecuted by
the solicitations of some of the natives to subject myself to the odious
operation of tattooing. their importunities drove me half wild, for i
felt how easily they might work their will upon me regarding this or
anything else which they took into their heads. still, however, the
behaviour of the islanders towards me was as kind as ever. fayaway was
quite as engaging; kory-kory as devoted; and mehevi t
