gathered here in
your heart, literally in your heart, as cancer survivors. you and
you alone know us as we know ourselves. guide us to life
and the light through our times of trial. we pray for isaac's
eyes, for michael's and jamie's blood, for augustus's bones,
for hazel's lungs, for james's throat. we pray that you
might heal us and that we might feel your love, and your
peace, which passes all understanding. and we remember in
our hearts those whom we knew and loved who have gone
home to you: maria and kade and joseph and haley and
abigail and angelina and taylor and gabriel and . . ."

that list, all the way at the end when everyone had stopped
listening.

when patrick was finished, we said this stupid mantra
