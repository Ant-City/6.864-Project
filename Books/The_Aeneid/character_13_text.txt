 fields
  with swords, and pointed spears, and clatt'ring shields;
  of argives, and of old sicanian bands,
  and those who plow the rich rutulian lands;
  auruncan youth, and those sacrana yields,
  and the proud labicans, with painted shields,
  and those who near numician streams reside,
  and those whom tiber's holy forests hide,
  or circe's hills from the main land divide;
  where ufens glides along the lowly lands,
  or the black water of pomptina stands.

  last, from the volscians fair camilla came,
  and led her warlike troops, a warrior dame;
  unbred to spinning, in the loom unskill'd,
  she chose the nobler pallas of the field.
  mix'd with the first, the fierce virago fought,
  sustain'd the toils of arms, the danger sought,
  outstripp'd the winds in speed upon the plain,
  flew o'er the fields, nor hurt the bearded grain:
  she swept the seas, and, as she skimm'd along,
  her flying feet unbath'd on billows hung.

  he swims luxuriant in the liquid plain,
  and o'er his shoulder flows his waving mane:
  he neighs, he snorts, he bears his head on high;
  before his ample chest the frothy waters fly.

  soon as the prince appears without the gate,
  the volscians, with their virgin leader, wait
  his last commands. then, with a graceful mien,
  lights from her lofty steed the warrior queen:
  her squadron imitates, and each descends;
  whose common suit camilla thus commends:
  "if sense of honor, if a soul secure
  of inborn worth, that can all tests endure,
  can promise aught, or on itself rely
  greatly to dare, to conquer or to die;
  then, i alone, sustain'd by these, will meet
  the tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.
  ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:
  you, gen'ral, stay behind, and guard the town:"

  turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,
  and on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;
  then thus return'd: "o grace of it

  for, on the right and left, is room to press
  the foes at hand, or from afar distress;
  to drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour
  on their descending backs a stony show'r.
  thither young turnus took the well-known way,
  possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.

  meantime latonian phoebe, from the skies,
  beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,
  and call'd the light-foot opis to her aid,
  her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;
  then with a sigh began: "camilla goes
  to meet her death amidst her fatal foes:
  the nymphs i lov'd of all my mortal train,
  invested with diana's arms, in vain.
  nor is my kindness for the virgin new:
  't was born with her; and with her years it grew.

  from old privernum, for tyrannic sway,

  he clos'd the child within the hollow space;
  with twigs of bending osier bound the case;
  then pois'd the spear, heavy with human weight,
  and thus invok'd my favor for the freight:
  'accept, great goddess of the woods,' he said,
  'sent by her sire, this dedicated maid!
  thro' air she flies a suppliant to thy shrine;
  and the first weapons that she knows, are thine.'
  he said; and with full force the spear he threw:
  above the sounding waves camilla flew.
  then, press'd by foes, he stemm'd the stormy tide,
  and gain'd, by stress of arms, the farther side.
  his fasten'd spear he pull'd from out the ground,
  and, victor of his vows, his infant nymph unbound;
  nor, after that, in towns which walls inclose,
  would trust his hunted life amidst his foes;
  but, rough, in open air he chose to lie;
  earth was his couch, his cov'ring was the sky.

  and, o! i wish, contented with my cares
  of salvage spoils, she had not sought the wars!
  then had she been of my celestial train,
  and shunn'd the fate that dooms her to be slain.
  but since, opposing heav'n's decree, she goes
  to find her death among forbidden foes,
  haste with these arms, and take thy steepy flight.
  where, with the gods, averse, the latins fight.
  this bow to thee, this quiver i bequeath,
  this chosen arrow, to revenge her death:
  by whate'er hand camilla shall be slain,
  or of the trojan or italian train,
  let him not pass unpunish'd from the plain.
  then, in a hollow cloud, myself will aid
  to bear the breathless body of my maid:
  unspoil'd shall be her arms, and unprofan'd
  her holy limbs with any human hand,
  and in a marble tomb laid in her native land."

  she said. the faithful nymph descends from high
  with rapid flight, and cuts the sounding sky:
  black clouds and stormy winds around her body fly.

  press forward on their bits, and shift their ground.
  shields, arms, and spears flash horribly from far;
  and the fields glitter with a waving war.
  oppos'd to these, come on with furious force
  messapus, coras, and the latian horse;
  these in the body plac'd, on either hand
  sustain'd and clos'd by fair camilla's band.
  advancing in a line, they couch their spears;
  and less and less the middle space appears.
  thick smoke obscures the field; and scarce are seen
  the neighing coursers, and the shouting men.
  in distance of their darts they stop their course;
  then man to man they rush, and horse to horse.
  the face of heav'n their flying jav'lins hide,

  his neck and throat unarm'd, his head was bare,
  but shaded with a length of yellow hair:
  secure, he fought, expos'd on ev'ry part,
  a spacious mark for swords, and for the flying dart.
  across the shoulders came the feather'd wound;
  transfix'd he fell, and doubled to the ground.
  the sands with streaming blood are sanguine dyed,
  and death with honor sought on either side.

  resistless thro' the war camilla rode,
  in danger unappall'd, and pleas'd with blood.
  one side was bare for her exerted breast;
  one shoulder with her painted quiver press'd.
  now from afar her fatal jav'lins play;
  now with her ax's edge she hews her way:
  diana's arms upon her shoulder sound;
  and when, too closely press'd, she quits the ground,
  from her bent bow she sends a backward wound.

  he clench'd within his hand an iron prong,
  and tower'd above the rest, conspicuous in the throng.
  him soon she singled from the flying train,
  and slew with ease; then thus insults the slain:
  "vain hunter, didst thou think thro' woods to chase
  the savage herd, a vile and trembling race?
  here cease thy vaunts, and own my victory:
  a woman warrior was too strong for thee.
  yet, if the ghosts demand the conqu'ror's name,
  confessing great camilla, save thy shame."
  then butes and orsilochus she slew,
  the bulkiest bodies of the trojan crew;
  but butes breast to breast: the spear descends
  above the gorget, where his helmet ends,
  and o'er the shield which his left side defends.
  orsilochus and she their courses ply:
  he seems to follow, and she seems to fly;
  but in a narrower ring she makes the race;
  and then he flies, and she pursues the chase.

  th' unhappy virgin, tho' concern'd the most,
  was only deaf; so greedy was she bent

  a shout, that struck the golden stars, ensued;
  despair and rage the languish'd fight renew'd.
  the trojan troops and tuscans, in a line,
  advance to charge; the mix'd arcadians join.

  but cynthia's maid, high seated, from afar
  surveys the field, and fortune of the war,
  unmov'd a while, till, prostrate on the plain,
  welt'ring in blood, she sees camilla slain,
  and, round her corpse, of friends and foes a fighting train.
  then, from the bottom of her breast, she drew
  a mournful sigh, and these sad words ensue:
  "too dear a fine, ah much lamented maid,
  for warring with the trojans, thou hast paid!
  nor aught avail'd, in this unhappy strife,
  diana's sacred arms, to save thy life.

  high o'er the field there stood a hilly mound,
  sacred the place, and spread with oaks around,
  where, in a marble tomb, dercennus lay,
  a king that once in latium bore the sway.
  the beauteous opis thither bent her flight,
  to mark the traitor aruns from the height.
  him in refulgent arms she soon espied,
  swoln with success; and loudly thus she cried:
  "thy backward steps, vain boaster, are too late;
  turn like a man, at length, and meet thy fate.
  charg'd with my message, to camilla go,
  and say i sent thee to the shades below,
  an honor undeserv'd from cynthia's bow."

  she said, and from her quiver chose with speed
  the winged shaft, predestin'd for the deed;
  then to the stubborn yew her strength applied,
  till the far distant horns approach'd on either side.
  the bowstring touch'd her breast, so strong she drew;
  whizzing in air the fatal arrow flew.

  meantime to turnus, ambush'd in the shade,
  with heavy tidings came th' unhappy maid:
  "the volscians overthrown, camilla kill'd;
  the foes, entirely masters of the field,
  like a resistless flood, come rolling on:
  the cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town."
