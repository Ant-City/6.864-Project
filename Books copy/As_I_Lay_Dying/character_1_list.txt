Anse Bundren - 
                 The
head of the Bundren family. Anse is a poor farmer afflicted with
a hunchback, whose instincts are overwhelmingly selfish. His poor
childrearing skills seem to be largely responsible for his children's
various predicaments. Alternately hated and disrespected by his
children, Anse nonetheless succeeds in achieving his two greatest
goals in one fell swoop: burying his dead wife in her hometown of
Jefferson, and acquiring a new set of false teeth.
