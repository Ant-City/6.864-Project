doubt it will be a girl. i have a presentiment that it must be a girl.
now child, from the moment of the birth of this girl--’

‘perhaps boy,’ my mother took the liberty of putting in.

‘i tell you i have a presentiment that it must be a girl,’ returned miss
betsey. ‘don’t contradict. from the moment of this girl’s birth, child,
i intend to be her friend. i intend to be her godmother, and i beg
you’ll call her betsey trotwood copperfield. there must be no mistakes
in life with this betsey trotwood. there must be no trifling with her
affections, poor dear. she must be well brought up, and well guarded
from reposing any foolish confidences where they are not deserved. i
must make that my care.’

there was a twitch of miss betsey’s head, after each of these sentences,
as if her own old wrongs were working within her, and she repressed any
plainer reference to them by strong constraint. so my mother suspecte

‘david copperfield?’ said mr. dick, who did not appear to me to
remember much about it. ‘david copperfield? oh yes, to be sure. david,
certainly.’

‘well,’ said my aunt, ‘this is his boy--his son. he would be as like his
father as it’s possible to be, if he was not so like his mother, too.’

‘his son?’ said mr. dick. ‘david’s son? indeed!’

‘yes,’ pursued my aunt, ‘and he has done a pretty piece of business.
he has run away. ah! his sister, betsey trotwood, never would have run
away.’ my aunt shook her head firmly, confident in the character and
behaviour of the girl who never was born.

‘oh! you think she wouldn’t have run away?’ said mr. dick.

‘bless and save the man,’ exclaimed my aunt, sharply, ‘how he talks!
don’t i know she wouldn’t? she would have lived with her god-mother,
and we should have been devoted to one another. where, in the name of
wonder, should his sister, betsey trotwood, have run from, or to?’

ke to know! she had had one husband. she had seen david
copperfield out of the world, who was always running after wax dolls
from his cradle. she had got a baby--oh, there were a pair of babies
when she gave birth to this child sitting here, that friday night!--and
what more did she want?’

mr. dick secretly shook his head at me, as if he thought there was no
getting over this.

‘she couldn’t even have a baby like anybody else,’ said my aunt. ‘where
was this child’s sister, betsey trotwood? not forthcoming. don’t tell
me!’

mr. dick seemed quite frightened.

‘that little man of a doctor, with his head on one side,’ said my aunt,
‘jellips, or whatever his name was, what was he about? all he could do,
was to say to me, like a robin redbreast--as he is--“it’s a boy.” a boy!
yah, the imbecility of the whole set of ‘em!’

the heartiness of the ejaculation startled mr. dick exceedingly; and me,
too, if i am to tell the truth.

‘and then, as if this wa

s not enough, and she had not stood sufficiently
in the light of this child’s sister, betsey trotwood,’ said my aunt,
‘she marries a second time--goes and marries a murderer--or a man with
a name like it--and stands in this child’s light! and the natural
consequence is, as anybody but a baby might have foreseen, that he
prowls and wanders. he’s as like cain before he was grown up, as he can
be.’

mr. dick looked hard at me, as if to identify me in this character.

‘and then there’s that woman with the pagan name,’ said my aunt, ‘that

‘well, child,’ said my aunt, when i went downstairs. ‘and what of mr.
dick, this morning?’

i informed her that he sent his compliments, and was getting on very
well indeed.

‘what do you think of him?’ said my aunt.

i had some shadowy idea of endeavouring to evade the question, by
replying that i thought him a very nice gentleman; but my aunt was
not to be so put off, for she laid her work down in her lap, and said,
folding her hands upon it:

‘come! your sister betsey trotwood would have told me what she thought
of anyone, directly. be as like your sister as you can, and speak out!’

‘is he--is mr. dick--i ask because i don’t know, aunt--is he at all out
of his mind, then?’ i stammered; for i felt i was on dangerous ground.

‘not a morsel,’ said my aunt.

‘oh, indeed!’ i observed faintly.

‘if there is anything in the world,’ said my aunt, with great decision
and force of manner, ‘that mr. dick is not, it’s that.’

i had nothing

‘he has been called mad,’ said my aunt. ‘i have a selfish pleasure in
saying he has been called mad, or i should not have had the benefit of
his society and advice for these last ten years and upwards--in fact,
ever since your sister, betsey trotwood, disappointed me.’

‘so long as that?’ i said.

‘and nice people they were, who had the audacity to call him mad,’
pursued my aunt. ‘mr. dick is a sort of distant connexion of mine--it
doesn’t matter how; i needn’t enter into that. if it hadn’t been for me,
his own brother would have shut him up for life. that’s all.’

i am afraid it was hypocritical in me, but seeing that my aunt felt
strongly on the subject, i tried to look as if i felt strongly too.

i pitied him with all my heart.

while i advanced in friendship and intimacy with mr. dick, i did not
go backward in the favour of his staunch friend, my aunt. she took
so kindly to me, that, in the course of a few weeks, she shortened my
adopted name of trotwood into trot; and even encouraged me to hope, that
if i went on as i had begun, i might take equal rank in her affections
with my sister betsey trotwood.

‘trot,’ said my aunt one evening, when the backgammon-board was placed
as usual for herself and mr. dick, ‘we must not forget your education.’

this was my only subject of anxiety, and i felt quite delighted by her
referring to it.

‘should you like to go to school at canterbury?’ said my aunt.

i replied that i should like it very much, as it was so near her.

‘good,’ said my aunt. ‘should you like to go tomorrow?’

sweet expression of face, who was looking at me.

i believe i was turning about in search of uriah’s picture, when, a door
at the farther end of the room opening, a gentleman entered, at sight of
whom i turned to the first-mentioned portrait again, to make quite sure
that it had not come out of its frame. but it was stationary; and as the
gentleman advanced into the light, i saw that he was some years older
than when he had had his picture painted.

‘miss betsey trotwood,’ said the gentleman, ‘pray walk in. i was engaged
for a moment, but you’ll excuse my being busy. you know my motive. i
have but one in life.’

miss betsey thanked him, and we went into his room, which was furnished
as an office, with books, papers, tin boxes, and so forth. it looked
into a garden, and had an iron safe let into the wall; so immediately
over the mantelshelf, that i wondered, as i sat down, how the sweeps got
round it when they swept the chimney.

her nose, for she could never thoroughly forgive peggotty for being so
called.

‘of all things in the world, aunt, i should like it best!’

‘well,’ said my aunt, ‘that’s lucky, for i should like it too. but
it’s natural and rational that you should like it. and i am very
well persuaded that whatever you do, trot, will always be natural and
rational.’

‘i hope so, aunt.’

‘your sister, betsey trotwood,’ said my aunt, ‘would have been as
natural and rational a girl as ever breathed. you’ll be worthy of her,
won’t you?’

‘i hope i shall be worthy of you, aunt. that will be enough for me.’

‘it’s a mercy that poor dear baby of a mother of yours didn’t live,’
said my aunt, looking at me approvingly, ‘or she’d have been so vain
of her boy by this time, that her soft little head would have been
completely turned, if there was anything of it left to turn.’ (my a

resources of that man’s intellect, except myself!’

she stopped for a moment to take my hand between hers, and went on:

‘it’s in vain, trot, to recall the past, unless it works some influence
upon the present. perhaps i might have been better friends with your
poor father. perhaps i might have been better friends with that poor
child your mother, even after your sister betsey trotwood disappointed
me. when you came to me, a little runaway boy, all dusty and way-worn,
perhaps i thought so. from that time until now, trot, you have ever been
a credit to me and a pride and a pleasure. i have no other claim upon
my means; at least’--here to my surprise she hesitated, and was
confused--‘no, i have no other claim upon my means--and you are my
adopted child. only be a loving child to me in my age, and bear with my
whims and fancies; and you will do more for an old woman w

body was smoking. we were all smoking. i was smoking, and trying
to suppress a rising tendency to shudder. steerforth had made a speech
about me, in the course of which i had been affected almost to tears.
i returned thanks, and hoped the present company would dine with me
tomorrow, and the day after--each day at five o’clock, that we might
enjoy the pleasures of conversation and society through a long evening.
i felt called upon to propose an individual. i would give them my aunt.
miss betsey trotwood, the best of her sex!

somebody was leaning out of my bedroom window, refreshing his forehead
against the cool stone of the parapet, and feeling the air upon his
face. it was myself. i was addressing myself as ‘copperfield’, and
saying, ‘why did you try to smoke? you might have known you couldn’t
do it.’ now, somebody was unsteadily contemplating his features in the
looking-glass. that was i too. i was very pale in the looking-glass;
my eyes had a vacant appearance; and my hai

seemed to have her there; how trustfully, although she was so young and
inexperienced, my aunt confided in her; how strong she was, indeed, in
simple love and truth.

we began to talk about my aunt’s losses, and i told them what i had
tried to do that morning.

‘which was injudicious, trot,’ said my aunt, ‘but well meant. you are
a generous boy--i suppose i must say, young man, now--and i am proud of
you, my dear. so far, so good. now, trot and agnes, let us look the case
of betsey trotwood in the face, and see how it stands.’

i observed agnes turn pale, as she looked very attentively at my aunt.
my aunt, patting her cat, looked very attentively at agnes.

‘betsey trotwood,’ said my aunt, who had always kept her money matters
to herself. ‘--i don’t mean your sister, trot, my dear, but myself--had
a certain property. it don’t matter how much; enough to live on. more;
for she had saved a little, and added to it. betsey funded her property
for some time, and the

‘well, wickfield!’ said my aunt; and he looked up at her for the first
time. ‘i have been telling your daughter how well i have been disposing
of my money for myself, because i couldn’t trust it to you, as you were
growing rusty in business matters. we have been taking counsel together,
and getting on very well, all things considered. agnes is worth the
whole firm, in my opinion.’

‘if i may umbly make the remark,’ said uriah heep, with a writhe, ‘i
fully agree with miss betsey trotwood, and should be only too appy if
miss agnes was a partner.’

‘you’re a partner yourself, you know,’ returned my aunt, ‘and that’s
about enough for you, i expect. how do you find yourself, sir?’

in acknowledgement of this question, addressed to him with extraordinary
curtness, mr. heep, uncomfortably clutching the blue bag he carried,
replied that he was pretty well, he thanked my aunt, and hoped she was
the same.

‘and you, master--i should say, mister copperfield,’

 he watched me.

‘you are not going, papa?’ said agnes, anxiously. ‘will you not walk
back with trotwood and me?’

he would have looked to uriah, i believe, before replying, if that
worthy had not anticipated him.

‘i am bespoke myself,’ said uriah, ‘on business; otherwise i should
have been appy to have kept with my friends. but i leave my partner to
represent the firm. miss agnes, ever yours! i wish you good-day, master
copperfield, and leave my umble respects for miss betsey trotwood.’

with those words, he retired, kissing his great hand, and leering at us
like a mask.

we sat there, talking about our pleasant old canterbury days, an hour
or two. mr. wickfield, left to agnes, soon became more like his former
self; though there was a settled depression upon him, which he never
shook off. for all that, he brightened; and had an evident pleasure in
hearing us recall the little incidents of our old life, many of which he
remembered very well. he said it was like th

my dear, your future is between you two. no one can assist you; you are
to work it out for yourselves. this is marriage, trot; and heaven bless
you both, in it, for a pair of babes in the wood as you are!’

my aunt said this in a sprightly way, and gave me a kiss to ratify the
blessing.

‘now,’ said she, ‘light my little lantern, and see me into my bandbox by
the garden path’; for there was a communication between our cottages in
that direction. ‘give betsey trotwood’s love to blossom, when you come
back; and whatever you do, trot, never dream of setting betsey up as a
scarecrow, for if i ever saw her in the glass, she’s quite grim enough
and gaunt enough in her private capacity!’

with this my aunt tied her head up in a handkerchief, with which she was
accustomed to make a bundle of it on such occasions; and i escorted her
home. as she stood in her garden, holding up her little lantern to light

neighbourhood in her face, are fainter (though they glitter still);
but her rough forefinger, which i once associated with a pocket
nutmeg-grater, is just the same, and when i see my least child catching
at it as it totters from my aunt to her, i think of our little parlour
at home, when i could scarcely walk. my aunt’s old disappointment is set
right, now. she is godmother to a real living betsey trotwood; and dora

there is something bulky in peggotty’s pocket. it is nothing smaller
than the crocodile book, which is in rather a dilapidated condition by
this time, with divers of the leaves torn and stitched across, but which
peggotty exhibits to the children as a precious relic. i find it very
curious to see my own infant face, looking up at me from the crocodile
stories; and to be reminded by it of my old acquaintance brooks of
sheffield.
