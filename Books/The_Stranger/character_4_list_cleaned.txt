the [CHARACTER]  - 
                a
priest who attends to the religious needs of condemned men, the
[CHARACTER] acts as a catalyst for meursault's psychological and philosophical development.
after meursault is found guilty of premeditated murder and sentenced
to death, he repeatedly refuses to see the [CHARACTER]. the [CHARACTER] visits
meursault anyway, and nearly demands that he take comfort in god.
the [CHARACTER] seems threatened by meursault's stubborn atheism. eventually,
meursault becomes enraged and angrily asserts that life is meaningless
and that all men are condemned to die. this argument triggers meursault's
final acceptance of the meaninglessness of the universe.
