[CHARACTER]
the leader of the wampanoags, known as [CHARACTER] by the british, plays a
large but ambiguous role in mary rowlandson's narrative. though as a leader he
has power and status, philip often seems removed from the politics and violence
of his people and seems distant even from the war that bears his name. when he
first meets rowlandson, he is courteous, offering her some of his tobacco in a
gesture of friendship. far from being a demanding ruler with a sense of
entitlement, philip engages rowlandson in his culture on an economic level by
offering her money or food for her services as a seamstress. this exchange,
however small it may be, suggests philip's decency and humanity. rowlandson may
be a captive of his tribe, but she is still a person, and she is not a slave.
despite this basic decency and kindness, philip does not set rowlandson
free, though as a leader, he might have had the power to do so. when the general
court of the indians meets to discuss freeing her, philip refuses to attend,
prolonging rowlandson's captivity through his petty, immature action. he offers
rowlandson her freedom in exchange for clothing, money, and food, but rowlandson
distrusts him, fearing he'll go back on his word. this mention of philip's
possibly false offer, and his childish sulking, is the last rowlandson says of
him in her story.
