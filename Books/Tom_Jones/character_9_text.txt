o you, it is but an office of charity
to keep her from him; and i am sure it would be unpardonable in me to
do otherwise, who have tasted so bitterly of the misfortunes attending
such marriages.‚Äù

here she was interrupted by the arrival of a visitor, which was no
other than his lordship; and as nothing passed at this visit either
new or extraordinary, or any ways material to this history, we shall
here put an end to this chapter.



chapter iii.

a project of mrs fitzpatrick, and her visit to lady bellaston.


when mrs fitzpatrick retired to rest, her thoughts were entirely taken
up by her cousin sophia and mr jones. she was, indeed, a little
offended with the former, for the disingenuity which she now
discovered. in which meditation she had not long exercised her
imagination before the following conceit suggested itself; that could
she possibly become the means of preserving sophia from this man, and
of restoring her to her father, she should, in all human probability,
by so great a service to th

emained but to consider of proper
methods to accomplish her scheme. to attempt to reason the case with
sophia did not appear to her one of those methods: for as betty had
reported from mrs honour, that sophia had a violent inclination to
jones, she conceived that to dissuade her from the match was an
endeavour of the same kind, as it would be very heartily and earnestly
to entreat a moth not to fly into a candle.

if the reader will please to remember that the acquaintance which
sophia had with lady bellaston was contracted at the house of mrs
western, and must have grown at the very time when mrs fitzpatrick
lived with this latter lady, he will want no information, that mrs
fitzpatrick must have been acquainted with her likewise. they were,
besides, both equally her distant relations.

after much consideration, therefore, she resolved to go early in the
morning to that lady, and endeavour to see her, unknown to sophia, and
to acquaint her with the whole affair. for she did not in the least
doubt, b

ut that the prudent lady, who had often ridiculed romantic
love, and indiscreet marriages, in her conversation, would very
readily concur in her sentiments concerning this match, and would lend
her utmost assistance to prevent it.

this resolution she accordingly executed; and the next morning before
the sun, she huddled on her cloaths, and at a very unfashionable,
unseasonable, unvisitable hour, went to lady bellaston, to whom she
got access, without the least knowledge or suspicion of sophia, who,
though not asleep, lay at that time awake in her bed, with honour
snoring by her side.

mrs fitzpatrick made many apologies for an early, abrupt visit, at an
hour when, she said, ‚Äúshe should not have thought of disturbing her
ladyship, but upon business of the utmost consequence.‚Äù she then
opened the whole affair, told all she had heard from betty; and did
not forget the visit which jones had paid to herself t

he preceding
evening.

lady bellaston answered with a smile, ‚Äúthen you have seen this
terrible man, madam; pray, is he so very fine a figure as he is
represented? for etoff entertained me last night almost two hours with
him. the wench i believe is in love with him by reputation.‚Äù here the
reader will be apt to wonder; but the truth is, that mrs etoff, who
had the honour to pin and unpin the lady bellaston, had received
compleat information concerning the said mr jones, and had faithfully
conveyed the same to her lady last night (or rather that morning)
while she was undressing; on which accounts she had been detained in
her office above the space of an hour and a half.

the lady indeed, though generally well enough pleased with the
narratives of mrs etoff at those seasons, gave an extraordinary
attention to her account of jones; for honour had described him as a
very handsome fellow, and mrs eto

ff, in her hurry, added so much to
the beauty of his person to her report, that lady bellaston began to
conceive him to be a kind of miracle in nature.

the curiosity which her woman had inspired was now greatly increased
by mrs fitzpatrick, who spoke as much in favour of the person of jones
as she had before spoken in dispraise of his birth, character, and
fortune.

when lady bellaston had heard the whole, she answered gravely,
‚Äúindeed, madam, this is a matter of great consequence. nothing can
certainly be more commendable than the part you act; and i shall be
very glad to have my share in the preservation of a young lady of so
much merit, and for whom i have so much esteem.‚Äù

‚Äúdoth not your ladyship think,‚Äù says mrs fitzpatrick eagerly, ‚Äúthat it
would be the best way to write immediately to my uncle, and acquaint
him where my cousin is?‚Äù

the lady pondered a litt

bellaston replied, ‚Äúshe would come the moment she could get from
dinner, which she supposed would be by seven at farthest; for that it
was absolutely necessary she should be acquainted with his person.
upon my word, madam,‚Äù says she, ‚Äúit was very good to take this care of
miss western; but common humanity, as well as regard to our family,
requires it of us both; for it would be a dreadful match indeed.‚Äù

mrs fitzpatrick failed not to make a proper return to the compliment
which lady bellaston had bestowed on her cousin, and, after some
little immaterial conversation, withdrew; and, getting as fast as she
could into her chair, unseen by sophia or honour, returned home.



chapter iv.

which consists of visiting.


mr jones had walked within sight of a certain door during the whole
day, which, though one of the shortest, appeared to him to be one of
the longest in the whole year. at length, the clock having struck
five, he returned to mrs fitzpatrick, who, though it was a full hour
ea

he priests of cybele do not so rattle their sounding brass.

in short, a footman knocked, or rather thundered, at the door. jones
was a little surprized at the sound, having never heard it before; but
mrs fitzpatrick very calmly said, that, as some company were coming,
she could not make him any answer now; but if he pleased to stay till
they were gone, she intimated she had something to say to him.

the door of the room now flew open, and, after pushing in her hoop
sideways before her, entered lady bellaston, who having first made a
very low courtesy to mrs fitzpatrick, and as low a one to mr jones,
was ushered to the upper end of the room.

we mention these minute matters for the sake of some country ladies of
our acquaintance, who think it contrary to the rules of modesty to
bend their knees to a man.

the company were hardly well settled, before the arrival of the peer
lately mentioned, caused a fresh disturbance, and a repetition of
ceremonials.

these being over, the conversation began to be (

ndeed, this mental repast is a dainty, of
which those who are excluded from polite assemblies must be contented
to remain as ignorant as they must of the several dainties of french
cookery, which are served only at the tables of the great. to say the
truth, as neither of these are adapted to every taste, they might both
be often thrown away on the vulgar.

poor jones was rather a spectator of this elegant scene, than an actor
in it; for though, in the short interval before the peer‚Äôs arrival,
lady bellaston first, and afterwards mrs fitzpatrick, had addressed
some of their discourse to him; yet no sooner was the noble lord
entered, than he engrossed the whole attention of the two ladies to
himself; and as he took no more notice of jones than if no such person
had been present, unless by now and then staring at him, the ladies
followed his example.

the company had now staid so long, that mrs fitzpatrick plainly
perceived they all designed to stay out each other. she therefore
resolved to rid herse

inted the lady herself with it particularly, and soon after very
ceremoniously withdrew.

he was no sooner gone than the great personages, who had taken no
notice of him present, began to take much notice of him in his
absence; but if the reader hath already excused us from relating the
more brilliant part of this conversation, he will surely be very ready
to excuse the repetition of what may be called vulgar abuse; though,
perhaps, it may be material to our history to mention an observation
of lady bellaston, who took her leave in a few minutes after him, and
then said to mrs fitzpatrick, at her departure, ‚Äúi am satisfied on the
account of my cousin; she can be in no danger from this fellow.‚Äù

our history shall follow the example of lady bellaston, and take leave
of the present company, which was now reduced to two persons; between
whom, as nothing passed, which in the least concerns us or our reader,
we shall not suffer ourselves to be diverted by it from matters which
must seem of more conseq

voice, said she was surprized at her friend, who must absolutely have
forgot her appointment; at which, after venting much resentment, she
suddenly exprest some apprehension from jones, and asked him what the
world would think of their having been alone together in a house at
that time of night? but instead of a direct answer to so important a
question, jones began to be very importunate with the lady to unmask;
and at length having prevailed, there appeared not mrs fitzpatrick,
but the lady bellaston herself.

it would be tedious to give the particular conversation, which
consisted of very common and ordinary occurrences, and which lasted
from two till six o‚Äôclock in the morning. it is sufficient to mention
all of it that is anywise material to this history. and this was a
promise that the lady would endeavour to find out sophia, and in a few
days bring him to an interview with her, on condition that he would
then take his leave of her. when this was thoroughly settled, and a
second meeti

ough, when he came to reflect farther, it raised in
him some suspicions not very advantageous to the honour of his master:
to these the dreadful idea he had of the masquerade, the disguise in
which his master had gone out and returned, and his having been abroad
all night, contributed. in plain language, the only way he could
possibly find to account for the possession of this note, was by
robbery: and, to confess the truth, the reader, unless he should
suspect it was owing to the generosity of lady bellaston, can hardly
imagine any other.

to clear, therefore, the honour of mr jones, and to do justice to the
liberality of the lady, he had really received this present from her,
who, though she did not give much into the hackney charities of the
age, such as building hospitals, &c., was not, however, entirely void
of that christian virtue; and conceived (very rightly i think) that a
young fellow of merit, without a shilling in the world, was no
improper object of this virtue.

desiring to exhibit such pictures to the public, that i would wish to
draw a curtain over those that have been lately set forth in certain
french novels; very bungling copies of which have been presented us
here under the name of translations.

jones grew still more and more impatient to see sophia; and finding,
after repeated interviews with lady bellaston, no likelihood of
obtaining this by her means (for, on the contrary, the lady began to
treat even the mention of the name of sophia with resentment), he
resolved to try some other method. he made no doubt but that lady
bellaston knew where his angel was, so he thought it most likely that
some of her servants should be acquainted with the same secret.
partridge therefore was employed to get acquainted with those
servants, in order to fish this secret out of them.

few situations can be imagined

more uneasy than that to which his poor
master was at present reduced; for besides the difficulties he met
with in discovering sophia, besides the fears he had of having
disobliged her, and the assurances he had received from lady bellaston
of the resolution which sophia had taken against him, and of her
having purposely concealed herself from him, which he had sufficient
reason to believe might be true; he had still a difficulty to combat
which it was not in the power of his mistress to remove, however kind
her inclination might have been. this was the exposing of her to be
disinherited of all her father‚Äôs estate, the almost inevitable
consequence of their coming together without a consent, which he had
no hopes of ever obtaini

add to all these the many obligations which lady bellaston, whose
violent fondness we can no longer conceal, had heaped upon him; so
that by her means he was now become one of the best-dressed men about
town; and was not only relieved from those ridiculous distresses we
have before mentioned, but was actually raised to a state of affluence
beyond what he had ever known.

now, though there are many gentlemen who very well reconcile it to
their consciences to possess themselves of the whole fortune of a
woman, without making her any kind of return; yet t

 jones, with whom she promised herself two or
three hours of uninterrupted conversation after her return from the
place where she dined, which was at a friend‚Äôs house in a pretty
distant part of the town, near her old place of assignation, where she
had engaged herself before she was well apprized of the revolution
that had happened in the mind and morals of her late confidante.



chapter x.

a chapter which, though short, may draw tears from some eyes.


mr jones was just dressed to wait on lady bellaston, when mrs miller
rapped at his door; and, being admitted, very earnestly desired his
company below-stairs, to drink tea in the parlour.

upon his entrance into the room, she presently introduced a person to
him, saying, ‚Äúthis, sir, is my cousin, who hath been so greatly
beholden to your goodness, for which he begs to return you his
sincerest thanks.‚Äù

the man had scarce entered upon that speech which mrs miller had so
kindly prefaced, when both jones and he, looking stedfastly at each
other

om, where he had not been many minutes before the
door opened, and in came----no other than sophia herself, who had left
the play before the end of the first act; for this, as we have already
said, being, a new play, at which two large parties met, the one to
damn, and the other to applaud, a violent uproar, and an engagement
between the two parties, had so terrified our heroine, that she was
glad to put herself under the protection of a young gentleman who
safely conveyed her to her chair.

as lady bellaston had acquainted her that she should not be at home
till late, sophia, expecting to find no one in the room, came hastily
in, and went directly to a glass which almost fronted her, without
once looking towards the upper end of the room, where the statue of
jones now stood motionless.---in this glass it was, after
contemplating her own lovely face, that she first discovered the said
statue; when, instantly turning about, she perceived the reality of
the vision: upon which she gave a violent scream

that day to this; and never
intend or desire to see her again.‚Äù sophia, in her heart, was very
glad to hear this; but forcing into her face an air of more coldness
than she had yet assumed, ‚Äúwhy,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúmr jones, do you take the
trouble to make a defence where you are not accused? if i thought it
worth while to accuse you, i have a charge of unpardonable nature
indeed.‚Äù--‚Äúwhat is it, for heaven‚Äôs sake?‚Äù answered jones, trembling
and pale, expecting to hear of his amour with lady bellaston. ‚Äúoh,‚Äù
 said she, ‚Äúhow is it possible! can everything noble and everything
base be lodged together in the same bosom?‚Äù lady bellaston, and the
ignominious circumstance of having been kept, rose again in his mind,
and stopt his mouth from any reply. ‚Äúcould i have expected,‚Äù proceeded
sophia, ‚Äúsuch treatment from you? nay, from any gentleman, from any
man of honour? to have my name traduced in public; in inns, among the
meanest vulgar! to have any little favours that my unguarded he
 
 ___________________________
 
 for some moments, she allowed him to do without any resistance;
but then recollecting herself, gently withdrew out of his arms; and,
to turn the discourse from a subject too tender, and which she found
she could not support, bethought herself to ask him a question she
never had time to put to him before, ‚Äúhow he came into that room?‚Äù he
began to stammer, and would, in all probability, have raised her
suspicions by the answer he was going to give, when, at once, the door
opened, and in came lady bellaston.

having advanced a few steps, and seeing jones and sophia together, she
suddenly stopt; when, after a pause of a few moments, recollecting
herself with admirable presence of mind, she said--though with
sufficient indications of surprize both in voice and countenance--‚Äúi
thought, miss western, you had been at the play?‚Äù

though sophia had no opportunity of learning of jones by what means he
had discovered her, yet, as she had not the least suspicion of the
real truth, or that jones and lady
 
 ___________________________
 
 bellaston were acquainted, so she
was very little confounded; and the less, as the lady had, in all
their conversations on the subject, entirely taken her side against
her father. with very little hesitation, therefore, she went through
the whole story of what had happened at the play-house, and the cause
of her hasty return.

the length of this narrative gave lady bellaston an opportunity of
rallying her spirits, and of considering in what manner to act. and as
the behaviour of sophia gave her hopes that jones had not betrayed
her, she put on an air of good humour, and said, ‚Äúi should not have
broke in so abruptly upon you, miss western, if i had known you had
company.‚Äù

lady bellaston fixed her eyes on sophia whilst she spoke these words.
to which that poor young lady, having her face overspread with blushes
and confusion, answered, in a stammering voice, ‚Äú

i am sure, madam, i
shall always think the honour of your ladyship‚Äôs company----‚Äù ‚Äúi hope,
at least,‚Äù cries lady bellaston, ‚Äúi interrupt no business.‚Äù--‚Äúno,
madam,‚Äù answered sophia, ‚Äúour business was at an end. your ladyship
may be pleased to remember i have often mentioned the loss of my
pocket-book, which this gentleman, having very luckily found, was so
kind to return it to me with the bill in it.‚Äù

jones, ever since the arrival of lady bellaston, had been ready to
sink with fear. he sat kicking his heels, playing with his fingers,
and looking more like a fool, if it be possible, than a young booby
squire, when he is first introduced into a polite assembly. he began,
however, now to recover himself; and taking a hint from the behaviour
of lady bellaston, who he saw did not intend to claim any acquaintance
with him, he resolved as entirely to affect the stranger on his part.
he said, ‚Äúever since he had the pocket-book in his possession

r, that you found out to
whom the note belonged.‚Äù

‚Äúoh, madam,‚Äù cries jones, ‚Äúit was enclosed in a pocket-book, in which
the young lady‚Äôs name was written.‚Äù

‚Äúthat was very fortunate, indeed,‚Äù cries the lady:--‚Äúand it was no
less so, that you heard miss western was at my house; for she is very
little known.‚Äù

jones had at length perfectly recovered his spirits; and as he
conceived he had now an opportunity of satisfying sophia as to the
question she had asked him just before lady bellaston came in, he
proceeded thus: ‚Äúwhy, madam,‚Äù answered he, ‚Äúit was by the luckiest
chance imaginable i made this discovery. i was mentioning what i had
found, and the name of the owner, the other night to a lady at the
masquerade, who told me she believed she knew where i might see miss
western; and if i would come to her house the next morning she would
inform me, i went according to her appointment, but she was not at
home; nor could i ever meet with her till this morning, when she
directed

this, he
said, ‚Äúi believe, madam, it is customary to give some reward on these
occasions;--i must insist on a very high one for my honesty;--it is,
madam, no less than the honour of being permitted to pay another visit
here.‚Äù

‚Äúsir,‚Äù replied the lady, ‚Äúi make no doubt that you are a gentleman,
and my doors are never shut to people of fashion.‚Äù

jones then, after proper ceremonials, departed, highly to his own
satisfaction, and no less to that of sophia; who was terribly alarmed
lest lady bellaston should discover what she knew already but too
well.

upon the stairs jones met his old acquaintance, mrs honour, who,
notwithstanding all she had said against him, was now so well bred to
behave with great civility. this meeting proved indeed a lucky
circumstance, as he communicated to her the house where he lodged,
with which sophia was unacquainted.



chapter xii.

in which the thirteenth book is concluded.


the elegant lord shaftesbury somewhere objects to telling too much
truth: by which 
 
 ___________________________
 
 deviation from truth, as young women in the affair
of love; for which they may plead precept, education, and above all,
the sanction, nay, i may say the necessity of custom, by which they
are restrained, not from submitting to the honest impulses of nature
(for that would be a foolish prohibition), but from owning them.

we are not, therefore, ashamed to say, that our heroine now pursued
the dictates of the above-mentioned right honourable philosopher. as
she was perfectly satisfied then, that lady bellaston was ignorant of
the person of jones, so she determined to keep her in that ignorance,
though at the expense of a little fibbing.

jones had not been long gone, before lady bellaston cryed, ‚Äúupon my
word, a good pretty young fellow; i wonder who he is; for i don‚Äôt
remember ever to have seen his face before.‚Äù

‚Äúnor i neither, madam,‚Äù cries sophia. ‚Äúi must say he behaved very
handsomely in relation to my note.‚Äù

‚Äúyes; and he is a very handsome fellow,‚Äù said the lady: ‚Äúdon‚Äôt y

think so?‚Äù

‚Äúi did not take much notice of him,‚Äù answered sophia, ‚Äúbut i thought
he seemed rather awkward, and ungenteel than otherwise.‚Äù

‚Äúyou are extremely right,‚Äù cries lady bellaston: ‚Äúyou may see, by his
manner, that he hath not kept good company. nay, notwithstanding his
returning your note, and refusing the reward, i almost question
whether he is a gentleman.----i have always observed there is a
something in persons well born, which others can never acquire.----i
think i will give orders not to be at home to him.‚Äù

‚Äúnay, sure, madam,‚Äù answered sophia, ‚Äúone can‚Äôt suspect after what he
hath done;--besides, if your ladyship observed him, there was an
elegance in

 his discourse, a delicacy, a prettiness of expression

‚Äúi confess,‚Äù said lady bellaston, ‚Äúthe fellow hath words----and

‚Äúi forgive your ladyship!‚Äù said sophia.

‚Äúyes, indeed you must,‚Äù answered she, laughing; ‚Äúfor i had a horrible
suspicion when i first came into the room----i vow you must forgive
it; but i suspected it was mr jones himself.‚Äù

‚Äúdid your ladyship, indeed?‚Äù cries sophia, blushing, and affecting a
laugh.

‚Äúyes, i vow i did,‚Äù answered she. ‚Äúi can‚Äôt imagine what put it into my

think, dear sophy, is not commonly the case with your friend.‚Äù

‚Äúthis raillery,‚Äù cries sophia, ‚Äúis a little cruel, lady bellaston,
after my promise to your ladyship.‚Äù

‚Äúnot at all, child,‚Äù said the lady;----‚Äúit would have been cruel
before; but after you have promised me never to marry without your
father‚Äôs consent, in which you know is implied your giving up jones,
sure you can bear a little raillery on a passion which was pardonable
enough in a young girl in the country, and of which you tell me you
have so entirely got the better. what must i think, my dear sophy, if
you cannot bear a little ridicule even on

‚Äúwhom, pray?‚Äù cried the lady hastily.

‚Äúmr jones,‚Äù answered sophia;--and immediately recollecting herself,
‚Äúmr jones!--no, no; i ask your pardon;--i mean the gentleman who was
just now here.‚Äù

‚Äúo sophy! sophy!‚Äù cries the lady; ‚Äúthis mr jones, i am afraid, still
runs in your head.‚Äù

‚Äúthen, upon my honour, madam,‚Äù said sophia, ‚Äúmr jones is as entirely
indifferent to me, as the gentleman who just now left us.‚Äù

‚Äúupon my honour,‚Äù said lady bellaston, ‚Äúi believe it. forgive me,
therefore, a little innocent raillery; but i promise you i will never
mention his name any more.‚Äù

and now the two ladies separated, infinitely more to the delight of
sophia than of lady bellaston, who would willingly have tormented her
rival a little longer, had not business of more importance called her
away. as for sophia, her mind was not perfectly easy under this first
practice of deceit; upon which, when she retired to her chamber, she
reflected with the hi

some there are, however, of this rank upon whom passion exercises its
tyranny, and hurries them far beyond the bounds which decorum
prescribes; of these the ladies are as much distinguished by their
noble intrepidity, and a certain superior contempt of reputation, from
the frail ones of meaner degree, as a virtuous woman of quality is by
the elegance and delicacy of her sentiments from the honest wife of a
yeoman and shopkeeper. lady bellaston was of this intrepid character;
but let not my country readers conclude from her, that this is the
general conduct of women of fashion, or that we mean to represent them
as such. they might as well suppose that every clergyman was
represented by thwackum, or every soldier by ensign northerton.

there is not, indeed, a greater error than that which universally
prevails among the vulgar, who, borrowing their opinion from some
ignorant satirists, have affixed the character of lewdness to these

  ‚Äú_p.s._--come immediately.‚Äù

to the men of intrigue i refer the determination, whether the angry or
the tender letter gave the greatest uneasiness to jones. certain it
is, he had no violent inclination to pay any more visits that evening,
unless to one single person. however, he thought his honour engaged,
and had not this been motive sufficient, he would not have ventured to
blow the temper of lady bellaston into that flame of which he had
reason to think it susceptible, and of which he feared the consequence
might be a discovery to sophia, which he dreaded. after some
discontented walks therefore about the room, he was preparing to
depart, when the lady kindly prevented him, not by another letter, but
by her own presence. she entered the room very disordered in her
dress, and very discomposed in her looks, and threw herself into a
chair, where, having recovered her breath, she said--‚Äúyou see, si

she was my own sister. lord have mercy upon you, if you don‚Äôt make her
a good husband! and to be sure, if you do not, nothing can be bad
enough for you.‚Äù jones begged her only to whisper, for that there was
a lady dying in the next room. ‚Äúa lady!‚Äù cries she; ‚Äúay, i suppose one
of your ladies.--o mr jones, there are too many of them in the world;
i believe we are got into the house of one, for my lady bellaston i
darst to say is no better than she should be.‚Äù--‚Äúhush! hush!‚Äù cries
jones, ‚Äúevery word is overheard in the next room.‚Äù ‚Äúi don‚Äôt care a
farthing,‚Äù cries honour, ‚Äúi speaks no scandal of any one; but to be
sure the servants make no scruple of saying as how her ladyship meets
men at another place--where the house goes under the name of a poor
gentlewoman; but her ladyship pays the rent, and many‚Äôs the good thing
besides, they say, she hath of her.‚Äù--here jones, after express

yet i have heard some servants say----but i am sure you will do me the
justice to own i never saw the colour of your money.‚Äù here jones
hastily took the letter, and presently after slipped five pieces into
her hand. he then returned a thousand thanks to his dear sophia in a
whisper, and begged her to leave him to read her letter: she presently
departed, not without expressing much grateful sense of his
generosity.

lady bellaston now came from behind the curtain. how shall i describe
her rage? her tongue was at first incapable of utterance; but streams
of fire darted from her eyes, and well indeed they might, for her
heart was all in a flame. and now as soon as her voice found way,
instead of expressing any indignation against honour or her own
servants, she began to attack poor jones. ‚Äúyou see,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúwhat i
have sacrificed to you; my reputation, my honour--gone for ever! and
what return have i found? neglec

that a man with whom the secrets of a lady are not safe must be the
most contemptible of wretches.‚Äù--‚Äúvery well,‚Äù said she--‚Äúi need not
insist on your becoming this contemptible wretch in your own opinion;
for the inside of the letter could inform me of nothing more than i
know already. i see the footing you are upon.‚Äù--here ensued a long
conversation, which the reader, who is not too curious, will thank me
for not inserting at length. it shall suffice, therefore, to inform
him, that lady bellaston grew more and more pacified, and at length
believed, or affected to believe, his protestations, that his meeting
with sophia that evening was merely accidental, and every other matter
which the reader already knows, and which, as jones set before her in
the strongest light, it is plain that she had in reality no reason to
be angry with him.

she was not, however, in her heart perfectly satisfied with his
refusal to show her the letter; so deaf are we to the clearest reason,
when it argues again

these visits to the account of sophia; and that she herself would be
considered as the person imposed upon.

this scheme was contrived by the lady, and highly relished by jones,
who was indeed glad to have a prospect of seeing his sophia at any
rate; and the lady herself was not a little pleased with the
imposition on sophia, which jones, she thought, could not possibly
discover to her for his own sake.

the next day was appointed for the first visit, and then, after proper
ceremonials, the lady bellaston returned home.

containing various matters.


jones was no sooner alone than he eagerly broke open his letter, and
read as follows:--

  ‚Äúsir, it is impossible to express what i have suffered since you
  left this house; and as i have reason to think you intend coming
  here again, i have sent honour, though so late at night, as she
  tells me she knows your lodgings, to prevent you. i charge you, by
  all the regard you have for me, not to think of visiting here; for
  it wil

 from her ladyship, that she is not already
  without some suspicion. something favourable perhaps may happen; we
  must wait with patience; but i once more entreat you, if you have
  any concern for my ease, do not think of returning hither.‚Äù

this letter administered the same kind of consolation to poor jones,
which job formerly received from his friends. besides disappointing
all the hopes which he promised to himself from seeing sophia, he was
reduced to an unhappy dilemma, with regard to lady bellaston; for
there are some certain engagements, which, as he well knew, do very
difficultly admit of any excuse for the failure; and to go, after the
strict prohibition from sophia, he was not to be forced by any human
power. at length, after much deliberation, which during that night
supplied the place of sleep, he determined to feign himself sick: for
this suggested itself as the only means of failing the appointed
visit, without incensing lady bellaston, which he had more than one
reason of desirin

g to avoid.

the first thing, however, which he did in the morning, was, to write
an answer to sophia, which he inclosed in one to honour. he then
despatched another to lady bellaston, containing the above-mentioned
excuse; and to this he soon received the following answer:--

  ‚Äúi am vexed that i cannot see you here this afternoon, but more
  concerned for the occasion; take great care of yourself, and have
  the best advice, and i hope there will be no danger.--i am so
  tormented all this morning with fools, that i have scarce a moment‚Äôs
  time to write to you. adieu.

  ‚Äú_p.s._--i will endeavour to call on you this evening, at nine.--be
  sure to be alone.‚Äù

mr j

pted her; for,
as the hour of assignation now drew nigh, he began to stipulate for a
second interview with the lady that evening, which he promised should
be the last at her house; swearing, at the same time, that she was one
of great distinction, and that nothing but what was intirely innocent
was to pass between them; and i do firmly believe he intended to keep
his word.

mrs miller was at length prevailed on, and jones departed to his
chamber, where he sat alone till twelve o‚Äôclock, but no lady bellaston
appeared.

as we have said that this lady had a great affection for jones, and as
it must have appeared that she really had so, the reader may perhaps
wonder at the first failure of her appointment, as she apprehended him
to be confined by sickness, a season when friendship seems most to
require such visits. this behaviour, therefore, in the lady, may, by
some, be condemned as unnatural; but that is not our fault; for our
business is only to record truth.



chapter vi.

containing a scene whic

h we doubt not will affect all our readers.


mr jones closed not his eyes during all the former part of the night;
not owing to any uneasiness which he conceived at being disappointed
by lady bellaston; nor was sophia herself, though most of his waking
hours were justly to be charged to her account, the present cause of
dispelling his slumbers. in fact, poor jones was one of the
best-natured fellows alive, and had all that weakness which is called
compassion, and which distinguishes this imperfect character from that
noble firmness of mind, which rolls a man, as it were, within himself,
and like a polished bowl, enables him to run through the world without
being once stopped by the calamities

a wise old gentleman who used to say, ‚Äúwhen children are
doing nothing, they are doing mischief.‚Äù i will not enlarge this
quaint saying to the most beautiful part of the creation in general;
but so far i may be allowed, that when the effects of female jealousy
do not appear openly in their proper colours of rage and fury, we may
suspect that mischievous passion to be at work privately, and
attempting to undermine, what it doth not attack above-ground.

this was exemplified in the conduct of lady bellaston, who, under all
the smiles which she wore in her countenance, concealed much
indignation against sophia; and as she plainly saw that this young
lady stood between her and the full indulgence of her desires, she
resolved to get rid of her by some means or other; nor was it long
before a very favourable opportunity of accomplishing this presented
itself to her.

the reader may be pleased to remember, that when sophia was thrown
into that consternation at the playhouse, by the wit and humour of a

set of young gentlemen who call themselves the town, we informed him,
that she had put herself under the protection of a young nobleman, who
had very safely conducted her to her chair.

this nobleman, who frequently visited lady bellaston, had more than
once seen sophia there, since her arrival in town, and had conceived a
very great liking to her; which liking, as beauty never looks more
amiable than in distress, sophia had in this fright so encreased, that
he might now, without any great impropriety, be said to be actually in
love with her.

it may easily be believed, that he would not suffer so handsome an
occasion of improving his acquaintance with the beloved object as now
offered itself to elapse, when even good breeding a

stance alone would have
alarmed sophia, who was somewhat more a mistress of computation at
present; she had indeed much more pregnant evidence from the eyes of
her lover of what past within his bosom; nay, though he did not make
any open declaration of his passion, yet many of his expressions were
rather too warm, and too tender, to have been imputed to complacence,
even in the age when such complacence was in fashion; the very reverse
of which is well known to be the reigning mode at present.

lady bellaston had been apprized of his lordship‚Äôs visit at his first
arrival; and the length of it very well satisfied her, that things
went as she wished, and as indeed she had suspected the second time
she saw this young couple together. this business, she rightly i think
concluded, that she should by no means forward by mixing in the
company while they were together; she therefore ordered her servants,
that when my lord was going, they should tell him she desired to speak
with him; and employed the inte

accomplish a scheme, which she made no doubt but his lordship would
very readily embrace the execution of.

lord fellamar (for that was the title of this young nobleman) was no
sooner introduced to her ladyship, than she attacked him in the
following strain: ‚Äúbless me, my lord, are you here yet? i thought my
servants had made a mistake, and let you go away; and i wanted to see
you about an affair of some importance.‚Äù----‚Äúindeed, lady bellaston,‚Äù
 said he, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt wonder you are astonished at the length of my
visit; for i have staid above two hours, and i did not think i had
staid above half-a-one.‚Äù----‚Äúwhat am i to conclude from thence, my
lord?‚Äù said she. ‚Äúthe company must be very agreeable which can make
time slide away so very deceitfully.‚Äù----‚Äúupon my honour,‚Äù said he,
‚Äúthe most agreeable i ever saw. pray tell me, lady bellaston, who is
this blazing star which you have produced among us all of a
sudden?‚Äù-

ne i would jest with your ladyship in an
affair of this kind.‚Äù ‚Äúindeed, then,‚Äù said the lady, ‚Äúi will most
readily propose your lordship to her father; and i can, i believe,
assure you of his joyful acceptance of the proposal; but there is a
bar, which i am almost ashamed to mention; and yet it is one you will
never be able to conquer. you have a rival, my lord, and a rival who,
though i blush to name him, neither you, nor all the world, will ever
be able to conquer.‚Äù ‚Äúupon my word, lady bellaston,‚Äù cries he, ‚Äúyou
have struck a damp to my heart, which hath almost deprived me of
being.‚Äù ‚Äúfie, my lord,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúi should rather hope i had struck

imagined you would have asked your rival‚Äôs name, that you might have

 ‚Äúindeed, madam,‚Äù replied my lord, ‚Äúyour cousin is of too immense a

 ‚Äúalas!‚Äù cries she, ‚Äúmy lord, how can it be prevented? the family have
already done all in their power; but the girl is, i think,
intoxicated, and nothing less than ruin will content her. and to deal
more openly with you, i expect every day to hear she is run away with
him.‚Äù ‚Äúwhat you tell me, lady bellaston,‚Äù answered his lordship,
‚Äúaffects me most tenderly, and only raises my compassion, instead of
lessening my adoration of your cousin. some means must be found to
preserve so inestimable a jewel. hath your ladyship endeavoured to
reason with her?‚Äù here the lady affected a laugh, and cried, ‚Äúmy dear
lord, sure you know us better than to talk of reasoning a young woman
out of her inclinations? these inestimable jewels are as deaf as the
jewels they wear: time, my lord, time is the only medi

take; nay, i live in hourly horrors on her account. in short, nothing
but violent methods will do.‚Äù ‚Äúwhat is to be done?‚Äù cries my lord;
‚Äúwhat methods are to be taken?--is there any method upon earth?--oh!
lady bellaston! there is nothing which i would not undertake for such
a reward.‚Äù----‚Äúi really know not,‚Äù answered the lady, after a pause;
and then pausing again, she cried out--‚Äúupon my soul, i am at my
wit‚Äôs end on this girl‚Äôs account.--if she can be preserved, something
must be done immediately; and, as i say, nothing but violent methods
will do.----if your lordship hath really this attachment to my cousin

made proper compliments, accepted the invitation, and then they
parted to dress, it being now past three in the morning, or to reckon
by the old style, in the afternoon.



chapter iii.

a further explanation of the foregoing design.


though the reader may have long since concluded lady bellaston to be a
member (and no inconsiderable one) of the great world; she was in
reality a very considerable member of the little world; by which
appellation was distinguished a very worthy and honourable society
which not long since flourished in this kingdom.

among other good principles upon which this society was founded, there
was one very remarkable; for, as it was a rule of an honourable club
of heroes, who assembled at the close of the late war, that all the
members should every day fight once

ome from the
society themselves. as, that the devil was the president; and that he
sat in person in an elbow-chair at the upper end of the table; but,
upon very strict enquiry, i find there is not the least truth in any
of those tales, and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of
very good sort of people, and the fibs which they propagated were of a
harmless kind, and tended only to produce mirth and good humour.

edwards was likewise a member of this comical society. to him
therefore lady bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her
purpose, and furnished him with a fib, which he was to vent whenever
the lady gave him her cue; and this was not to be till the evening,
when all the company but lord fellamar and himself were gone, and
while they were engaged in a rubber at whist.

to this time then, which was between seven and eight in the evening,
we will convey our reader; when lady bellaston, lord fellamar, miss
western, and tom, being engaged at whist, and in the last game of
their r

ubbers, tom received his cue from lady bellaston, which was, ‚Äúi
protest, tom, you are grown intolerable lately; you used to tell us
all the news of the town, and now you know no more of the world than
if you lived out of it.‚Äù

mr edwards then began as follows: ‚Äúthe fault is not mine, madam: it
lies in the dulness of the age, that doth nothing worth talking
of.----o la! though now i think on‚Äôt there hath a terrible accident
befallen poor colonel wilcox.----poor ned.----you know him, my lord,
everybody knows him; faith! i am very much c

oncerned for him.‚Äù

‚Äúwhat is it, pray?‚Äù says lady bellaston.

‚Äúwhy, he hath killed a man this morning in a duel, that‚Äôs all.‚Äù

his lordship, who was not in the secret, asked gravely, whom he had
killed? to which edwards answered, ‚Äúa young fellow we none of us know;
a somersetshire lad just came to town, one jones his name is; a near
relation of one mr allworthy, of whom your lordship i believe hath
heard. i saw the lad lie dead in a coffee-house.--upon my soul, he is
one of the finest corpses i ever saw in my life!‚Äù

sophia, who had just began

 had he arrived at the latter
part of the story than she began to deal again; and having dealt three
cards to one, and seven to another, and ten to a third, at last dropt
the rest from her hand, and fell back in her chair.

the company behaved as usually on these occasions. the usual
disturbance ensued, the usual assistance was summoned, and sophia at
last, as it is usual, returned again to life, and was soon after, at
her earnest desire, led to her own apartment; where, at my lord‚Äôs
request, lady bellaston acquainted her with the truth, attempted to
carry it off as a jest of her own, and comforted her with repeated
assurances, that neither his lordship nor tom, though she had taught
him the story, were in the true secret of the affair.

there was no farther evidence necessary to convince lord fellamar how
justly the case had been represented to him by lady bellaston; and
now, at her return into the room, a scheme was laid between these two
noble persons, which, though it appeared in no very heino

us light to
his lordship (as he faithfully promised, and faithfully resolved too,
to make the lady all the subsequent amends in his power by marriage),
yet many of our readers, we doubt not, will see with just detestation.

the next evening at seven was appointed for the fatal purpose, when
lady bellaston undertook that sophia should be alone, and his lordship
should be introduced to her. the whole family were to be regulated for
the purpose, most of the servants despatched out of the house; and for
mrs honour, who, to prevent suspicion, was to be left with her
mistress till his lordship‚Äôs arrival, lady bellaston herself was to
engage her in an apartment as distant as possible from the scene of
the intended mischief, and out of the hearing of sophia.

matters being thus agreed on, his lordship

hint of this design, especially as it came from a relation of
the lady, yet when that friend to reflection, a pillow, had placed the
action itself in all its natural black colours before his eyes, with
all the consequences which must, and those which might probably attend
it, his resolution began to abate, or rather indeed to go over to the
other side; and after a long conflict, which lasted a whole night,
between honour and appetite, the former at length prevailed, and he
determined to wait on lady bellaston, and to relinquish the design.

lady bellaston was in bed, though very late in the morning, and sophia
sitting by her bed-side, when the servant acquainted her that lord
fellamar was below in the parlour; upon which her ladyship desired him
to stay, and that she would see him presently; but the servant was no
sooner departed than poor sophia began to intreat her cousin not to
encourage the visits of that odious lord (so she called him, though a
little unjustly) upon her account. ‚Äúi see his de

sign,‚Äù said she; ‚Äúfor
he made downright love to me yesterday morning; but as i am resolved
never to admit it, i beg your ladyship not to leave us alone together
any more, and to order the servants that, if he enquires for me, i may
be always denied to him.‚Äù

‚Äúla! child,‚Äù says lady bellaston, ‚Äúyou country girls have nothing but
sweethearts in your head; you fancy every man who is civil to you is
making love. he is one of the most gallant young fellows about town,
and i am convinced means no more than a little gallantry. make love to
you indeed! i wish with all my heart he would, and you must be an
arrant mad woman to refuse him.‚Äù

‚Äúbut as i shall certainly be that mad woman,‚Äù cries sophia, ‚Äúi hope
his visits shall not be intruded upon me.‚Äù

‚Äúo child!‚Äù said lady bell

 to my
father‚Äôs inclinations.‚Äù

‚Äúwell, miss western,‚Äù said the lady, ‚Äúif you are not in a humour to
see company this morning, you may retire to your own apartment; for i
am not frightened at his lordship, and must send for him up into my
dressing-room.‚Äù

sophia thanked her ladyship, and withdrew; and presently afterwards
fellamar was admitted upstairs.



chapter iv.

by which it will appear how dangerous an advocate a lady is when she
applies her eloquence to an ill purpose.


when lady bellaston heard the young lord‚Äôs scruples, she treated them
with the same disdain with which one of those sages of the law, called
newgate solicitors, treats the qualms of conscience in a young
witness. ‚Äúmy dear lord,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúyou certainly want a cordial. i
must send to lady edgely for one of her best drams. fie upon it! have
more resolution. are you frightened by the word rape? or are you
apprehensive----? well! if the story of helen was modern, i should
think it unnatural. i mean the behavi

 not even persuade her to fling herself away upon an
empty title. she should not upbraid me hereafter with having lost a
man of spirit; for that his enemies allow this poor young fellow to
be.‚Äù

let those who have had the satisfaction of hearing reflections of this
kind from a wife or a mistress, declare whether they are at all
sweetened by coming from a female tongue. certain it is, they sunk
deeper into his lordship than anything which demosthenes or cicero
could have said on the occasion.

lady bellaston, perceiving she had fired the young lord‚Äôs pride, began
now, like a true orator, to rouse other passions to its assistance.
‚Äúmy lord,‚Äù says she, in a graver voice, ‚Äúyou will be pleased to
remember, you mentioned this matter to me first; for i would not
appear to you in the light of one who is endeavouring to put off my
cousin upon you. fourscore thousand pounds do not stand in need of an
advocate to recommend them.‚Äù ‚Äúnor doth miss western,‚Äù said he,
‚Äúrequire any recommendation f

ou more.‚Äù ‚Äúthen, madam,‚Äù cries
his lordship, ‚Äúi must make the best use of this moment; for i cannot
live, nor will i live without you.‚Äù----‚Äúwhat do you mean, my lord?‚Äù
 said sophia; ‚Äúi will raise the family.‚Äù ‚Äúi have no fear, madam,‚Äù
 answered he, ‚Äúbut of losing you, and that i am resolved to prevent,
the only way which despair points to me.‚Äù--he then caught her in his
arms: upon which she screamed so loud, that she must have alarmed some
one to her assistance, had not lady bellaston taken care to remove all
ears.

but a more lucky circumstance happened for poor sophia; another noise
now broke forth, which almost drowned her cries; for now the whole
house rang with, ‚Äúwhere is she? d--n me, i‚Äôll unkennel her this
instant. show me her chamber, i say. where is my daughter? i know
she‚Äôs in the house, and i‚Äôll see her if she‚Äôs above-ground. show me
where she is.‚Äù--at which last words the door flew open, and in came
squire western, with his parson and a set of myrmido

‚Äúlet me intreat you, sir, to be a little more moderate,‚Äù said the
parson; ‚Äúyou frighten the young lady so, that you deprive her of all

‚Äúpower of mine a--,‚Äù answered the squire. ‚Äúyou take her part then,
you do? a pretty parson, truly, to side with an undutiful child! yes,
yes, i will gee you a living with a pox. i‚Äôll gee un to the devil
sooner.‚Äù

‚Äúi humbly crave your pardon,‚Äù said the parson; ‚Äúi assure your worship
i meant no such matter.‚Äù

my lady bellaston now entered the room, and came up to the squire, who
no sooner saw her, than, resolving to follow the instructions of his
sister, he made her a very civil bow, in the rural manner, and paid
her some of his best compliments. he then immediately proceeded to his
complaints, and said, ‚Äúthere, my lady cousin; there stands the most
undutiful child in the world; she hankers after a beggarly rascal, and
won‚Äôt marry one of the greatest matches in all england, that we have
provided for her.‚Äù

my cousin. i am sure she hath a better understanding. i am convinced
she will not refuse what she must be sensible is so much to her
advantage.‚Äù

this was a wilful mistake in lady bellaston, for she well knew whom mr
western meant; though perhaps she thought he would easily be
reconciled to his lordship‚Äôs proposals.

‚Äúdo you hear there,‚Äù quoth the squire, ‚Äúwhat her ladyship says? all
your family are for the match. come, sophy, be a good girl, and be
dutiful, and make your father happy.‚Äù

‚Äúif my death will make you happy, sir,‚Äù answered sophia, ‚Äúyou will
shortly be so.‚Äù

squire.

she knows it was her aunt proposed it to me first.--come, sophy, once
more let me beg you to be a good girl, and gee me your consent before
your cousin.‚Äù

‚Äúlet me give him your hand, cousin,‚Äù said the lady. ‚Äúit is the fashion

‚Äúresent my a--,‚Äù quoth the squire. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think i am afraid of such a

side. lay by your spit, and i‚Äôll give thee enough of meddling with
what doth not belong to thee. i‚Äôll teach you to father-in-law me. i‚Äôll

‚Äúit‚Äôs very well, sir,‚Äù said my lord, ‚Äúi shall make no disturbance

his lordship was no sooner gone, than lady bellaston, coming up to mr
western, said, ‚Äúbless me, sir, what have you done? you know not whom
you have affronted; he is a nobleman of the first rank and fortune,
and yesterday made proposals to your daughter; and such as i am sure
you must accept with the highest pleasure.‚Äù

to which the squire answered--‚Äúwhy, that‚Äôs kind--and i would do as
much for your ladyship. to be sure relations should do for one
another. so i wish your ladyship a good night.--come, madam, you must
go along with me by fair means, or i‚Äôll have you carried down to the
coach.‚Äù

sophia said she would attend him without force; but begged to go in a
chair, for she said she should not be able to ride any other way.

contrive no more escapes, i promise you.‚Äù he then packed up his
daughter and the parson into the hackney coach, after which he mounted
himself, and ordered it to drive to his lodgings. in the way thither
he suffered sophia to be quiet, and entertained himself with reading a
lecture to the parson on good manners, and a proper behaviour to his
betters.

it is possible he might not so easily have carried off his daughter
from lady bellaston, had that good lady desired to have detained her;
but, in reality, she was not a little pleased with the confinement
into which sophia was going; and as her project with lord fellamar had
failed of success, she was well contented that other violent methods
were now going to be used in favour of another man.

  inform you, that she is now with lady bellaston, whom i have seen,

woman of figure is to be attacked by warrants and brutal justices of
the peace? i will inform you how to proceed. as soon as you arrive in
town, and have got yourself into a decent dress (for indeed, brother,
you have none at present fit to appear in), you must send your
compliments to lady bellaston, and desire leave to wait on her. when
you are admitted to her presence, as you certainly will be, and have
told her your story, and have made proper use of my name (for i think
you just know one another only by sight, though you are relations), i
am confident she will withdraw her protection from my niece, who hath

stress, he took (as is
common enough) the worst course, and, instead of exposing her to the
lady, which would have been of little consequence, he chose to expose
the lady to her; he therefore resolved to hide honour, whom he had but
just time to convey behind the bed, and to draw the curtains.

the hurry in which jones had been all day engaged on account of his
poor landlady and her family, the terrors occasioned by mrs honour,
and the confusion into which he was thrown by the sudden arrival of
lady bellaston, had altogether driven former thoughts out of his head;
so that it never once occurred to his memory to act the part of a sick
man; which, indeed, neither the gaiety of his dress, nor the freshness

he received her ladyship therefore rather agreeably to her desires
than to her expectations, with all the good humour he could muster in
his countenance, and without any real or affected appearance of the
least disorder.

distemper would have suffered you to come abroad: nay, i suppose you
have not sat in your chamber all day drest up like a fine lady to see
company after a lying-in; but, however, don‚Äôt think i intend to scold
you; for i never will give you an excuse for the cold behaviour of a
husband, by putting on the ill-humour of a wife.‚Äù

‚Äúnay, lady bellaston,‚Äù said jones, ‚Äúi am sure your ladyship will not
upbraid me with neglect of duty, when i only waited for orders. who,
my dear creature, hath reason to complain? who missed an appointment
last night, and left an unhappy man to expect, and wish, and sigh, and
languish?‚Äù

‚Äúdo not mention it, my dear mr jones,‚Äù cried she. ‚Äúif you knew the
occasion, you would pity me. in short, it is impossible to conceive
what women of condition are obliged to suffer from the impertinence of

there are certain words of provocation which men of honour hold can
properly be answered only by a blow. among lovers possibly there may
be some expressions which can be answered only by a kiss. now the
compliment which lady bellaston now made jones seems to be of this
kind, especially as it was attended with a look, in which the lady
conveyed more soft ideas than it was possible to express with her
tongue.

jones was certainly at this instant in one of the most disagreeable
and distressed situations imaginable; for, to carry on the comparison
we made use of before, though the provocation was given by the lady,
jones could not receive satisfaction, nor so much as offer to ask it,
in the presence of a third person; seconds in

being according to the law of arms. as this objection did not occur to
lady bellaston, who was ignorant of any other woman being there but
herself, she waited some time in great astonishment for an answer from
jones, who, conscious of the ridiculous figure he made, stood at a
distance, and, not daring to give the proper answer, gave none at all.
nothing can be imagined more comic, nor yet more tragical, than this
scene would have been if it had lasted much longer. the lady had
already changed colour two or three times; had got up from the bed and
sat down again, while jones was

nightingale had in reality mistaken jones‚Äôs apartment for that in
which himself had lodged; he therefore strongly insisted on coming in,
often swearing that he would not be kept from his own bed. jones,
however, prevailed over him, and delivered him into the hands of
partridge, whom the noise on the stairs soon summoned to his master‚Äôs
assistance.

and now jones was unwillingly obliged to return to his own apartment,
where at the very instant of his entrance he heard lady bellaston
venting an exclamation, though not a very loud one; and at the same
time saw her flinging herself into a chair in a vast agitation, which
in a lady of a tender constitution would have been an hysteric fit.

in reality the lady, frightened with the struggle between the two men,
of which she did not know what would be the issue, as she heard
nightingale swear many oaths he would come to his own bed, attempted
to retire to her known place of hiding, which to her great confusion
she found already o

concealment--‚Äúmarry come up!----wretch forsooth?----as poor a wretch

say.‚Äù

jones, instead of applying himself directly to take off the edge of
mrs honour‚Äôs resentment, as a more experienced gallant would have
done, fell to cursing his stars, and lamenting himself as the most
unfortunate man in the world; and presently after, addressing himself
to lady bellaston, he fell to some very absurd protestations of
innocence. by this time the lady, having recovered the use of her
reason, which she had as ready as any woman in the world, especially
on such occasions, calmly replied: ‚Äúsir, you need make no apologies, i
see now who the person is; i did not at first know mrs honour: but now
i do, i can suspect nothing wrong between her and you; and i am sure
she is a woman of too good sense to put any wrong constructions upon

therefore, lady bellaston assume the soft tone, she likewise softened

jones had just read over these three billets when mr nightingale came
into the room. ‚Äúwell, tom,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúany news from lady bellaston,
after last night‚Äôs adventure?‚Äù (for it was now no secret to any one in
that house who the lady was). ‚Äúthe lady bellaston?‚Äù answered jones
very gravely.----‚Äúnay, dear tom,‚Äù cries nightingale, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt be so

moved all esteem for her from the breast
of jones; and his gratitude was lessened in proportion. indeed, he
began to look on all the favours he had received rather as wages than
benefits, which depreciated not only her, but himself too in his own
conceit, and put him quite out of humour with both. from this disgust,
his mind, by a natural transition, turned towards sophia; her virtue,
her purity, her love to him, her sufferings on his account, filled all
his thoughts, and made his commerce with lady bellaston appear still
more odious. the result of all was, that, though his turning himself
out of her service, in which light he now saw his affair with her,
would be the loss of his bread; yet he determined to quit her, if he
could but find a handsome pretence: which being communicated to his
friend, nightingale considered a little, and then said, ‚Äúi have it, my
boy! i have found out a sure method; propose marriage to her, and i
would venture hanging upon the success.‚Äù ‚Äúmarriage?‚Äù cries jones.

on, jones, upon the strength of this assurance,
consented; but, as he swore he wanted the confidence to propose the
matter to her face, he wrote the following letter, which nightingale
dictated:--

  ‚Äúmadam,

  ‚Äúi am extremely concerned, that, by an unfortunate engagement
  abroad, i should have missed receiving the honour of your ladyship‚Äôs
  commands the moment they came; and the delay which i must now suffer
  of vindicating myself to your ladyship greatly adds to this
  misfortune. o, lady bellaston! what a terror have i been in for fear
  your reputation should be exposed by these perverse accidents! there
  is one only way to secure it. i need not name what that is. only
  permit me to say, that as your honour is as dear to me as my own, so
  my sole ambition is to have the glory of laying my liberty at your
  feet; and believe me when i assure you, i can never be made
  completely happy without you generously bestow on me a legal right
  of calling you mine for ever.--i am,

jones, by the advice of his privy-council, replied:

  ‚Äúmadam,

  ‚Äúit is impossible to express how much i am shocked at the suspicion
  you entertain of me. can lady bellaston have conferred favours on a
  man whom she could believe capable of so base a design? or can she
  treat the most solemn tie of love with contempt? can you imagine,
  madam, that if the violence of my passion, in an unguarded moment,
  overcame the tenderness which i have for your honour, i would think
  of indulging myself in the continuance of an intercourse which could
  not possibly escape long the notice of the world; and which, when
  discovered, must prove so fatal to your reputation? if

various were the conjectures which jones entertained on this step of
lady bellaston; who, in reality, had little farther design than to
secure within her own house the repository of a secret, which she
chose should make no farther progress than it had made already; but
mostly, she desired to keep it from the ears of sophia; for though
that young lady was almost the only one who would never have repeated
it again, her ladyship could not persuade herself of this; since, as
she now hated poor sophia with most implacable hatred, she conceived a
reciprocal hatred to herself to be l

a discovery made by partridge.


while jones was exulting in the consciousness of his integrity,
partridge came capering into the room, as was his custom when he
brought, or fancied he brought, any good tidings. he had been
despatched that morning by his master, with orders to endeavour, by
the servants of lady bellaston, or by any other means, to discover
whither sophia had been conveyed; and he now returned, and with a
joyful countenance told our heroe that he had found the lost bird. ‚Äúi
have seen, sir,‚Äù says he, ‚Äúblack george, the gamekeeper, who is one of
the servants whom the squire hath brought with him to town. i knew him
presently, though i have not seen him these several years; but you
know, sir, he is a very remarkable man, or, to use a purer phrase, he

l the squire, with the distressed
situation of sophia.


we must now convey the reader to mr western‚Äôs lodgings, which were in
piccadilly, where he was placed by the recommendation of the landlord
at the hercules pillars at hyde park corner; for at the inn, which was
the first he saw on his arrival in town, he placed his horses, and in
those lodgings, which were the first he heard of, he deposited
himself.

here, when sophia alighted from the hackney-coach, which brought her
from the house of lady bellaston, she desired to retire to the
apartment provided for her; to which her father very readily agreed,
and whither he attended her himself. a short dialogue, neither very
material nor pleasant to relate minutely, then passed between them, in
which he pressed her vehemently to give her consent to the marriage
with blifil, who, as he acquainted her, was to be in town in a few
days; but, instead of complying, she gave a more peremptory and
resolute refusal than she had ever done before. this so incens

 of this kind without danger of any imputation
on his honour. all he desires, therefore, is, that you will before me
make some acknowledgment; the slightest in the world will be
sufficient; and he intends this afternoon to pay his respects to you,
in order to obtain your leave of visiting the young lady on the
footing of a lover.‚Äù

‚Äúi don‚Äôt understand much of what you say, sir,‚Äù said the squire; ‚Äúbut
i suppose, by what you talk about my daughter, that this is the lord
which my cousin, lady bellaston, mentioned to me, and said something
about his courting my daughter. if so be that how that be the
case--you may give my service to his lordship, and tell un the girl is
disposed of already.‚Äù

‚Äúperhaps, sir,‚Äù said the gentleman, ‚Äúyou are not sufficiently apprized
of the greatness of this offer. i believe such a person, title, and
fortune would be nowhere refused.‚Äù

as to the former, he imputed the whole behaviour of his sister to her
humour only, and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in
the visit; but blifil saw a little deeper into things. he suspected
somewhat of more consequence, from two or three words which dropt from
the lady; and, to say the truth, he suspected right, as will appear
when i have unfolded the several matters which will be contained in
the following chapter.

schemes of lady bellaston for the ruin of jones.


love had taken too deep a root in the mind of lord fellamar to be
plucked up by the rude hands of mr western. in the heat of resentment
he had, indeed, given a commission to captain egglane, which the
captain had far exceeded in the execution; nor had it been executed at
all, had his lordship been able to find the captain after he had seen
lady bellaston, which was in the afternoon of the day after he had
received the affront; but so industrious was the captain in the
d
 
 ___________________________
 
ischarge of his duty, that, having after long enquiry found out the
squire‚Äôs lodgings very late in the evening, he sat up all night at a
tavern, that he might not miss the squire in the morning, and by that
means missed the revocation which my lord had sent to his lodgings.

in the afternoon then next after the intended rape of sophia, his
lordship, as we have said, made a visit to lady bellaston, who laid
open so much of the character of the squire, that his lordship plainly
saw the absurdity he had been guilty of in taking any offence at his
words, especially as he had those honourable designs on his daughter.
he then unbosomed the violence of his passion to lady bellaston, who
readily undertook the cause, and encouraged him with certain assurance
of a most favourable reception from all the elders of the family, and
from the father himself when he should be sober, and should be made
a
 
 ___________________________
 
a _carte blanche_, and would settle his
fortune in almost any manner they should require. and after uttering
many ecstasies and raptures concerning sophia, he took his leave and
departed, but not before he had received the strongest charge to
beware of jones, and to lose no time in securing his person, where he
should no longer be in a capacity of making any attempts to the ruin
of the young lady.

the moment mrs western was arrived at her lodgings, a card was
despatched with her compliments to lady bellaston; who no sooner
received it than, with the impatience of a lover, she flew to her
cousin, rejoiced at this fair opportunity, which beyond her hopes
offered itself, for she was much better pleased with the prospect of
making the proposals to a woman of sense, and who knew the world, than
to a gentleman whom she honoured with the appellation of hottentot;
though, indeed, from him she apprehended no danger of a refusal.

nding of her niece, who, though she would not give up her
affection in favour of blifil, will, i doubt not, says she, soon be
prevailed upon to sacrifice a simple inclination to the addresses of a
fine gentleman, who brings her both a title and a large estate: ‚Äúfor,
indeed,‚Äù added she, ‚Äúi must do sophy the justice to confess this
blifil is but a hideous kind of fellow, as you know, bellaston, all
country gentlemen are, and hath nothing but his fortune to recommend
him.‚Äù

‚Äúnay,‚Äù said lady bellaston, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt then so much wonder at my cousin;
for i promise you this jones is a very agreeable fellow, and hath one
virtue, which the men say is a great recommendation to us. what do you
think, mrs western--i shall certainly make you laugh; nay, i can
hardly tell you myself for laughing--will you believe that the fellow
hath had the assurance to make love to me? but if you should be
inclined to disbelieve it, here is evidence enough, his own
handwriting, i assure you.‚Äù she then delivered he

r cousin the letter
with the proposals of marriage, which, if the reader hath a desire to
see, he will find already on record in the xvth book of this history.

‚Äúupon my word i am astonished,‚Äù said mrs western; ‚Äúthis is, indeed, a
masterpiece of assurance. with your leave i may possibly make some use
of this letter.‚Äù ‚Äúyou have my full liberty,‚Äù cries lady bellaston, ‚Äúto
apply it to what purpose you please. however, i would not have it
shewn to any but miss western, nor to her unless you find occasion.‚Äù
 ‚Äúwell, and how did you use the fellow?‚Äù returned mrs western. ‚Äúnot as
a husband,‚Äù said the lady; ‚Äúi am not married, i promise you, my dear.
you know, bell, i have tried the comforts once already; and once, i
think, is enough for any reasonable woman.‚Äù

this letter lady bellaston thought would certainly turn the balance
against jones in the

mind of sophia, and she was emboldened to give it
up, partly by her hopes of having him instantly dispatched out of the
way, and partly by having secured the evidence of honour, who, upon
sounding her, she saw sufficient reason to imagine was prepared to
testify whatever she pleased.

but perhaps the reader may wonder why lady bellaston, who in her heart
hated sophia, should be so desirous of promoting a match which was so
much to the interest of the young lady. now, i would desire such
readers to look carefully into human nature, page almost the last, and
there he will find, in scarce legible characters, that women,
notwithstanding the preposterous behaviour of mothers, aunts, &c., in
matrimonial matters, do in reality think it so great a misfortune to
have their inclinations in love thwarted, that they imagine they ought

return with us to mr jones,
who, at the appointed hour, attended on mrs fitzpatrick; but before we
relate the conversation which now past it may be proper, according to
our method, to return a little back, and to account for so great an
alteration of behaviour in this lady, that from changing her lodging
principally to avoid mr jones, she had now industriously, as hath been
seen, sought this interview.

and here we shall need only to resort to what happened the preceding
day, when, hearing from lady bellaston that mr western was arrived in
town, she went to pay her duty to him, at his lodgings at piccadilly,
where she was received with many scurvy compellations too coarse to be
repeated, and was even threatened to be kicked out of doors. from
hence, an old servant of her aunt western, with whom she was well
acquainted, conducted her to the lodgings of that lady, who treated
her not more kindly, but more politely; or, to say the truth, with
rudeness in another way. in short, she returned from both, p

arrived that mr fitzpatrick was dead, the poor fellow apprehended
every minute that his ghost would enter the room. at last he delivered
him a letter, which he had like to have forgot, and which came from
sophia by the hands of black george.

jones presently dispatched every one out of the room, and, having
eagerly broke open the letter, read as follows:--

  ‚Äúyou owe the hearing from me again to an accident which i own
  surprizes me. my aunt hath just now shown me a letter from you to
  lady bellaston, which contains a proposal of marriage. i am
  convinced it is your own hand; and what more surprizes me is, that

  fact. all i desire is, that your name may never more be mentioned

 upon the table no longer than till mrs miller was out
of sight; for then sophia opened and read it.

this letter did very little service to his cause; for it consisted of
little more than confessions of his own unworthiness, and bitter
lamentations of despair, together with the most solemn protestations
of his unalterable fidelity to sophia, of which, he said, he hoped to
convince her, if he had ever more the honour of being admitted to her
presence; and that he could account for the letter to lady bellaston
in such a manner, that, though it would not entitle him to her
forgiveness, he hoped at least to obtain it from her mercy. and
concluded with vowing that nothing was ever less in his thoughts than
to marry lady bellaston.

though sophia read the letter twice over with great attention, his
meaning still remained a riddle to her; nor could her invention
suggest to her any means to excuse jones. she certainly remained very
angry with him, though indeed lady bellaston took up so much of her

sophia would have gladly been excused from all, but would not
disoblige her aunt; and as to the arts of counterfeiting illness, she
was so entirely a stranger to them, that it never once entered into
her head. when she was drest, therefore, down she went, resolved to
encounter all the horrors of the day, and a most disagreeable one it
proved; for lady bellaston took every opportunity very civilly and
slily to insult her; to all which her dejection of spirits disabled
her from making any return; and, indeed, to confess the truth, she was
at the very best but an indifferent mistress of repartee.

another misfortune which befel poor sophia was the company of lord
fellamar, whom she met at the opera, and who attended her to the drum.
and though both places were too publick to admit of any
particularities, and she was farther relieved by the musick at the

containing various matters.


before we return to mr jones, we will take one more view of sophia.

though that young lady had brought her aunt into great good humour by
those soothing methods which we have before related, she had not
brought her in the least to abate of her zeal for the match with lord
fellamar. this zeal was now inflamed by lady bellaston, who had told
her the preceding evening, that she was well satisfied from the
conduct of sophia, and from her carriage to his lordship, that all
delays would be dangerous, and that the only way to succeed was to
press the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should
have no time to reflect, and be obliged to consent while she scarce
knew what she did; in which manner, she said, one-half of the
marriages among people of condition were brought about. a fact very
probably true, and

mrs western, many ardent professions of
passion which nothing could conquer, and many assurances of
perseverance, which mrs western highly encouraged, took his leave for
this time.

before we relate what now passed between mrs western and sophia, it
may be proper to mention an unfortunate accident which had happened,
and which had occasioned the return of mrs western with so much fury,
as we have seen.

the reader then must know that the maid who at present attended on
sophia was recommended by lady bellaston, with whom she had lived for
some time in the capacity of a comb-brush: she was a very sensible
girl, and had received the strictest instructions to watch her young
lady very carefully. these instructions, we are sorry to say, were
communicated to her by mrs honour, into whose favour lady bellaston
had now so ingratiated herself, that the violent affection which the
good waiting-woman had formerly borne to sophia was entirely
obliterated by that great attachment which she had to her new
mistres

between him and sophia, at which he testified great
surprize.

the squire was silent a moment, and looked wild with astonishment at
this account.--at last he cried out, ‚Äúwhy, what can be the meaning of
this, neighbour allworthy? vond o‚Äôun she was, that i‚Äôll be sworn
to.----odzookers! i have hit o‚Äôt. as sure as a gun i have hit o‚Äô the

certain--but d--n me if he shall ha her--i‚Äôll ha no lords nor
courtiers in my vamily.‚Äù

allworthy now made a long speech, in which he repeated his resolution
to avoid all violent measures, and very earnestly recommended gentle
methods to mr western, as those by which he might be assured of
succeeding best with his daughter. he then took his leave, and
returned back to mrs miller, but was forced to comply with the earnest
entreaties of the squi

more than once; but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his
pardon for an offence he had been guilty of towards him, occasioned,
he said, entirely by his ignorance who he was.

now the reality of the case, with which jones was not acquainted till
afterwards, was this:--the lieutenant whom lord fellamar had employed,
according to the advice of lady bellaston, to press jones as a
vagabond into the sea-service, when he came to report to his lordship
the event which we have before seen, spoke very favourably of the
behaviour of mr jones on all accounts, and strongly assured that lord
that he must have mistaken the person, for that jones was certainly a
gentleman; insomuch that his lordship, who was strictly a man of
honour, and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the
world in general would have condemned, began to be much concerned f

jones,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúi may almost depend on your own justice, and leave
it to yourself to pass sentence on your own conduct.‚Äù--‚Äúalas! madam,‚Äù
 answered he, ‚Äúit is mercy, and not justice, which i implore at your
hands. justice i know must condemn me.--yet not for the letter i sent
to lady bellaston. of that i most solemnly declare you have had a true
account.‚Äù he then insisted much on the security given him by
nightingale of a fair pretence for breaking off, if, contrary to their
expectations, her ladyship should have accepted his offer; but confest
that he had been guilty of a great indiscretion to put such a letter
as that into her power, ‚Äúwhich,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúi have dearly paid for, in
