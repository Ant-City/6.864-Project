Enter antigone and ismene 

ANTIGONE: 

Dear sister! Dear Ismene! How many evils 

Our father, Oedipus, bequeathed to us! 

And is there one of them— do you know of one 

That Zeus has not showered down upon our heads? 

I have seen pain, dishonor, shame, and ruin, 

I have seen them all, in what we have endured. 

And now comes this new edict by the King 

Proclaimed throughout the city. Have you heard? 

Do you not know, even yet, our friends are threatened? 

They are to meet the fate of enemies. 10 

ISMENE: 

Our friends, Antigone? No, I have heard 

Nothing about them either good or bad. 

I have no news except that we two sisters 

Lost our two brothers when they killed each other. 

I know the Argive army fled last night, 

But what that means, or whether it makes my life 

Harder or easier, I cannot tell. 

ANTIGONE: 

This I was sure of. So I brought you here 
Beyond the palace gates to talk alone. 

ISMENE: 

What is the matter? I know you are deeply troubled. 20 

ANTIGONE: 

Yes, for our brothers' fate. Creon has given 

An honored burial to one, to the other 

Only unburied shame. Eteocles 

Is laid in the earth with all the rites observed 

That give him his due honor with the dead. 

But the decree concerning Polyneices 

Published through Thebes is that his wretched body 

Shall lie unmourned, unwept, unsepulchered. 

Sweet will he seem to the vultures when they find him, 

A welcome feast that they are eager for. 30 

This is the edict the good Creon uttered 

For your observance and for mine— ves, mine. 

He is coming here himself to make it plain 

To those who have not heard. Nor does he think it

To give him burial! Against the law? 

\N lK.DNl : 

He is our brother. I will do my duty, 
Yours too, perhaps. 1 never will be false. 
bmene: 

Creon forbids it! You are too rash, too headstrong. 

ANTIGONE: 

He has no right to keep me from my own. 

ISM EN E: 

Antigone! Think! Think how our father perished 

In scorn and hatred when his sins, that he 50 

Himself discovered, drove him to strike blind 

His eyes by his own hand. Think how his mother, 

His wife— both names were hers— ended her life 

Shamefully hanging in a twisted noose. 

Think of that dreadful day when our two brothers, 

Our wretched brothers, fought and fell together, 

Each slayer and each slain. And now we too, 

Left all alone, think how in turn we perish, 

If, in defiance of the law, we brave 

The power of the commandment of a king. 60 

think Antigone! We who are women 
Should not contend with men; we who are weak 
Are ruled by the stronger, so that we must obey 
In this and in matters that are yet more bitter. 
And so I pray the dead to pardon me 

If I obey our rulers, since I must. 

To be too bold in what we do is madness. 

ANTIGONE: 

1 will not urge vou. And I would not thank you 
For any help that you might care to give me. 

Do what you please, but I will bury him, 70

ANTIGONE 

And if I die for that, I shall be happy. 
Loved, I shall rest beside the one I loved. 
My crime is innocence, for I owe the dead 
Longer allegiance than I owe the living. 
With the dead I lie forever. Live, if you choose, 
Dishonoring the laws the gods have hallowed. 
ismene: 

No, I dishonor nothing. But to challenge 
Authority— I have not strength enough. 

ANTIGONE: 

Then make that vour excuse. I will go heap 

The earth above the brother that I love. 80 

ISMENE: 

Sister, Sister! How I fear for you! 

ANTIGONE: 

No, not for me. Set your own life in order. 
ismene: 

Well then, at least, tell no one of your plan. 
Keep it close hidden, as I too will keep it. 

ANTIGONE: 

Oh! Publish it! Proclaim it to the world! 
Then I will hate you less than for your silence. 

ISMENE: 

Your heart is hot for deeds that chill the blood. 

ANTIGONE: 

1 know that I give pleasure where I should. 
ismene: 

Yes, if you can, but you will try in vain. 

ANTIGONE: 

When my strength fails, then I shall try no longer. 90 

ismene: 

A hopeless task should never be attempted. 

ANTIGONE: 

Your words have won their just reward: my hatred 
And the long-lasting hatred of the dead. 
But leave me and the folly that is mine 
To undergo the worst that can befall me. 
I shall not suffer an ignoble death. 

ISMENE: 

Go then, Antigone, if you must go. 

And yet remember, though your act is foolish, 

That those who love you do so with all their hearts. 

Exeunt antigone and ismene. Enter chorus

BOP HO CLE! 

Dawned on our foes, w ho had come enflamed by the quarrel of 
Polj neices, 
Shone on their guttering arms, made swifter their headlong flight. 
Prom Argos they came with their white shields flashing, 

1 heir helmets, crested with horsehair, agleam: 
An army that Hem like a snow-white eagle 

Across our borders with shrilling scream. 

Above OUT roofs it soared, at our gares with greedy jaws it was gaping; 
But before their spears tasted our blood, and before our circle of 

towers 

Felt the flame of their torches, thev turned to flight. The foes of the 
Theban dragon no 

Found the surge and clamor of battle too fierce for their feebler 
powers. 
For Zeus, who abhors a proud tongue's boasting, 

Seeing their river of armor flow 
Clashing and golden, struck with his lightning 
To silence the shout of our foremost foe. 

He crashed to the earth with his torch, who had scaled the top of our 
ramparts, 
Raging in frenzy against us, breathing tempestuous hate, 
Raging and threatening in vain. And mighty Ares, our ally, 

Dealing havoc around him, apportioned to other foemen their fate. 
For at seven portals, their seven leaders, 120 

Down to the earth their bronze arms threw 
In tribute to Zeus, the lord of the battle; 

Save the fated brothers, the wretched two, 
Who went to their common doom together, 
Each wielding a spear that the other slew. 

Now glorious Victory smiles upon jubilant Thebes rich in chariots. 

Let us give free rein to our joy, forgetting our late-felt war; 
Let us visit in night-long chorus the temples of all the immortals, 
With Bacchus, who shakes the land in the dances, going before. 
But behold! The son of Monoeceus approaches, 130 

Creon, the new-crowned King of the land, 
Made King by new fortunes the gods have allotted. 
What step has he pondered? What has he planned 
To lav before us, his council of elders, 

Who have gathered together at his command? 

Enter creon 

CREON : 

Elders of Thebes, our city has been tossed 



ANTIGONE 

By a tempestuous ocean, but the gods 

Have steadied it once more and made it safe. 

You, out of all the citizens, I have summoned, 

Because I knew that you once reverenced 140 

The sovereignty of Laius, and that later, 

When Oedipus was King and when he perished, 

Your steadfast loyalty upheld his children. 

And now his sons have fallen, each one stained 

By his brother's blood, killed by his brother's hand, 

So that the sovereignty devolves on me, 

Since I by birth am nearest to the dead. 

Certainly no man can be fully known, 

Known in his soul, his will, his intellect, 

Until he is tested and has proved himself 150 

In statesmanship. Because a city's ruler, 

Instead of following the wisest counsel, 

May through some fear keep silent. Such a man 

I think contemptible. And one whose friend 

Has stronger claims upon him than his country, 

Him I consider worthless. As for me, 

I swear by Zeus, forever all-beholding, 

That I would not keep silence, if I saw 

Ruin instead of safety drawing near us; 

Nor would I think an enemy of the state 160 

Could be my friend. For I remember this: 

Our country bears us all securely onward, 

And only while it sails a steady course 

Is friendship possible. Such are the laws 

By which I guard the greatness of the city. 

And kindred to them is the proclamation 

That I have made to all the citizens 

Concerning the two sons of Oedipus: 

Eteocles, who has fallen in our defence, 

Bravest of warriors, shall be entombed 170 

With every honor, every offering given 

That may accompany the noble dead 

Down to their rest. But as for Polyneices, 

He came from exile eager to consume 

The city of his fathers with his fire 

And all the temples of his fathers' gods, 

Eager to drink deep of his kindred's blood, 

Eager to drag us off to slavery. 

To this man, therefore, nothing shall be given. 

None shall lament him, none shall do him honor. 180 

He shall be left without a grave, his corpse 

Devoured by birds and dogs, a loathsome sight. 



IOPHOCLBI 

Such is 1 1 in- will. For never shall the wicked 

Be raven more approval than the past, 
If I ha\ e p«>u cr to stop ir. Hut whoever 
Feels in Ins heart affection tor his city 
Shall be rewarded both in life and death. 
chorus:

So to pass judgment <>n our friend and foe. 

And you may gi v <-' commands to all of us, ioo 

The living and the dead. Your will is law.

Then see that this command is carried out. 

CHORUS:

Then what additional duty would you give us? 

CREON : 

Never to countenance the disobedient.

Have often been destroyed by hope of gain.

My Lord, I cannot say that I have hurried, 200 

Or that my running has made me lose my breath. 

I often stopped to think, and turned to go back. 

I stood there talking to myself: 'You fool,' 

I said, 'Why do you go to certain death?' 

And then: 'You idiot, are you still delaying? 

If someone else tells Creon, you will suffer.' 

I changed my mind this way, getting here slowly, 

Making a short road long. But still, at last, 

I did decide to come. And though mv story 

Is nothing much to tell, yet I will tell it. 210 

One thing I know. I must endure my fate, 

But nothing more than that can happen to me. 

What is the matter? What is troubling you? 

Please let me tell you first about myself.

ANTIGONE 

I did not do it. I did not see who did. 

It is not right for me to be punished for it. 

You take good care not to expose yourself. 
Your news must certainly be something strange. 

Yes, it is strange— dreadful. I cannot speak. 

Oh, tell it, will you? Tell it and go away! 220 

Well, it is this. Someone has buried the body, 
Just now, and gone— has sprinkled it with dust 
And given it other honors it should have. 

What are you saying? Who has dared to do it? 

I cannot tell. Nothing was to be seen: 
No mark of pickaxe, no spot where a spade 
Had turned the earth. The ground was hard and dry, 
Unbroken— not a trace of any wheels- 
No sign to show who did it. When the sentry 
On the first watch discovered it and told us, 230 

We were struck dumb with fright. For he was hidden 
Not by a tomb but a light coat of dust, 
As if a pious hand had scattered it. 
There were no tracks of any animal, 
A dog or wild beast that had come to tear him. 
We all began to quarrel, and since no one 
Was there to stop us, nearly came to blows. 
Everyone was accused, and everyone 
Denied his guilt. We could discover nothing. 
We were quite willing to handle red-hot iron, 240 

To walk through fire, to swear by all the gods 
That we were innocent of the deed itself, 
And innocent of taking any part 
In planning it or doing it. At last 
One of us spoke. We trembled and hung our heads, 
For he was right; we could not argue with him, 
Yet his advice was bound to cause us trouble. 
He told us all this had to be reported, 
Not kept a secret. We all agreed to that. 

We drew lots for it, and I had no luck. 250 

I won the prize and was condemned to come. 
So here I stand, unwilling, because I know 
The bringer of bad news is never welcome. 



SOPHOCLES 

Sir, as he spoke, I have been wondering. 
( an this be, possibly, the work of gods?

CREON: 



Be silent' Before you madden me! You are old. 

Would VOU l>e senseless also? What you sav 

Is unendurable. You sav the gods 

( ared for this corpse. Then was it for reward, 

Mighty to match his mighty services, 260 

That the gods covered him? 1 le \\ h<> came to burn 

Their pillared temples and their votive offerings, 

Ravage their land, and trample down the state. 

Or is it your opinion that the gods 

Honor the wicked? Inconceivable! 

1 low ever, from the first, some citizens 

Who found it difficult to endure this edict, 

Muttered against me, shaking their heads in secret, 

Instead of bowing down beneath the yoke, 

Obedient and contented with my rule. 270 

These are the men who are responsible, 

For I am certain thev have bribed the guards 

To burv him. Nothing is worse than money. 

Money lavs waste to cities, banishes 

Men from their homes, indoctrinates the heart, 

Perverting honesty to works of shame, 

Showing men how to practice villainy, 

Subduing them to every godless deed. 

But all those men who got their pav for this 

Need have no doubt their turn to pay will come. 280 

(to the guard) Now, you. As I still honor Zeus the King, 

I tell you, and I swear it solemnlv, 

Either vou find the man who did this thing, 

The very man, and bring him here to me, 

Or you will not just die. Before you die. 

You will be tortured until you have explained 

This outrage; so that later when vou steal 

You will know better where to look for money 

And not expect to find it everywhere. 

Ill-gotten wealth brings ruin and not safety. 290 

Sir, may I speak? Or shall I merely go? 

You can say nothing that is not offensive. 

Do I offend your hearing or vour heart? 

Is it your business to define the spot?

But you will say that treachery leads to sorrow 
Unless you find the man and show him to me.

Finding him is the best thing that could happen. 
Fate will decide. But however that may be,

Exit GUARD 
chorus: 

Many the marvelous things; but none that can be 

More of a marvel than man! This being that braves 
With the south wind of winter the whitened streaks of the sea, 3 10 

Threading his way through the troughs of engulfing waves. 
And the earth most ancient, the eldest of all the gods, 

Earth, undecaying, unwearied, he wears away with his toil; 
Forward and back with his plowshare, year after year, he plods, 
With his horses turning the soil. 

Man in devising excels. The birds of the air, 

That light-minded race, he entangles fast in his toils. 
Wild creatures he catches, casting about them his snare, 

And the salt-sea brood he nets in his woven coils. 
The tireless bull he has tamed, and the beast whose lair 320 

Is hidden deep in the wilds, who roams in the wooded hills. 
He has fitted a yoke that the neck of the shaggy-maned horse 
will bear; 

He is master of all through his skills. 

He has taught himself speech, and wind-like thought, and the lore 
Of ruling a town. He has fled the arrows of rain, 

The searching arrows of frost he need fear no more, 
That under a starry sky are endured with pain.

Make him a liar. I vowed not to hurrv back. 350 

I had been battered by vour storm of threats. 

But when a joy comes that exceeds our hopes, 

No other happiness can equal it. 

So I have broken my vow. I have returned, 

Bringing this girl along. She was discovered 

Busv with all the rites of burial. 

There was no casting lots, no, not this time! 

Such luck as this was mine and no one else's. 

Now sir, take her vourself, examine her.

CREON: 

This is the girl you caught? How? Where was she?

Burying the dead man, just as I have told you. 

CREON: 

Do you mean that? Or have you lost your mind? 
guard: 

Your order was that he should not be buried. 
I saw her bury him. Is that all clear? 



CREON: 

guard: 



How was she seen? You caught her in the act? 



This was what happened. When we had gotten back, 
W 7 ith your threats following us, we swept away 
The dust that covered him. We left him bare, 370 

A rotting corpse. And then we sat to windward, 
Up on the hillside, to avoid the stench. 
All of us were alert, and kept awake 
Threatening each other. No one could get careless. 
So the time passed, until the blazing sun 
Stood at the zenith, and the heat was burning. 
Then suddenly the wind came in a blast, 
Lifting a cloud of dust up from the earth, 
Troubling the sky and choking the whole plain, 
Stripping off all the foliage of the woods, 380 

Filling the breadth of heaven. We closed our eyes 
And bore the affliction that the gods had sent us. 
When it had finally stopped, we saw this girl. 
She wailed aloud with a sharp, bitter cry, 
The cry a bird gives seeing its empty nest 
Robbed of its brood. And she too, when she saw 
The naked body, was loud in her lament 
And cursed the men who had uncovered him. 
Quickly she sprinkled him with dust, and then 
Lifting a pitcher, poured out three libations 390 

To do him honor. When we ran and caught her, 
She was unterrified. When we accused her 
Both of her earlier and her present act, 
She made no effort to deny the charges. 
I am part glad, part sorry. It is good 
To find that you yourself have gotten clear, 
But to bring trouble on your friends is hard. 
However, nothing counts except my safety.

Now you, 
Answer this question. Make your answer brief. 
i .iu knew there was a law forbidding this? 

ANTICOM : 

Of course 1 knew it. Why nor? It was public. 

CREON : 

And vim have dared to disobey the law? 

ANTIGON1 

Yes. lor this law was not proclaimed by Zeus, 

Or by the gods who rule the world below. 

I do not think your edicts have such power 

That they can override the laws of heaven, 410 

Unwritten and unfailing, laws whose life 

Belongs not to today or yesterday 

But to time everlasting; and no man 

Knows the first moment that they had their being. 

If I transgressed these laws because I feared 

The arrogance of man, how to the gods 

Could I make satisfaction? Well I know, 

Being a mortal, that I have to die, 

Even without your proclamations. Yet 

If I must die before my time is come, 420 

That is a blessing. Because to one who lives, 

As I live, in the midst of sorrows, death 

Is of necessity desirable. 

For me, to face death is a trifling pain 

That does not trouble me. But to have left 

The body of my brother, my own brother, 

Lying unburied would be bitter grief. 

And if these acts of mine seem foolish to you, 

Perhaps a fool accuses me of folly. 

CHORUS: 

The violent daughter of a violent father, 430 

She cannot bend before a storm of evils. 

CREON (tO ANTIGONE ): 

Stubborn? Self-willed? People like that, I tell you, 
Are the first to come to grief. The hardest iron, 
Baked in the fire, most quickly flies to pieces. 
An unruly horse is taught obedience 
By a touch of the curb. How can you be so proud? 

14 



ANTIGONE 

You, a mere slave? (to chorus) She was well schooled already 

In insolence, when she defied the law. 

And now look at her! Boasting, insolent, 

Exulting in what she did. And if she triumphs 

And goes unpunished, I am no man— she is. 440 

If she were more than niece, if she were closer 

Than anyone who worships at my altar, 

She would not even then escape her doom, 

A dreadful death. Nor would her sister. Yes, 

Her sister had a share in burying him. 

(to attendant) Go bring her here. I have just seen her, raving, 

Beside herself. Even before they act, 

Traitors who plot their treason in the dark 

Betray themselves like that. Detestable! 

(to antigone) But hateful also is an evil-doer 450 

Who, caught red-handed, glorifies the crime. 

ANTIGONE: 

Now you have caught me, will you do more than kill me? 
creon: 

No, only that. With that I am satisfied. 

ANTIGONE: 

Then why do you delay? You have said nothing 

I do not hate. I pray you never will. 

And you hate what I say. Yet how could I 

Have won more splendid honor than by giving 

Due burial to my brother? All men here 

Would grant me their approval, if their lips 

Were not sealed up in fear. But you, a king, 460 

Blessed by good fortune in much else besides, 

Can speak and act with perfect liberty. 

CREON: 

All of these Thebans disagree with you. 

ANTIGONE: 

No. They agree, but they control their tongues. 

CREON: 

You feel no shame in acting without their help? 

ANTIGONE: 

I feel no shame in honoring a brother. 

CREON: 

Another brother died who fought against him. 

ANTIGONE: 

Two brothers. The two sons of the same parents.

Blessed the life that has no evil known, 

For the gods, striking, strike down a whole race- 
Doomed parent and doomed child both overthrown. 

As when the fierce breath of the winds of Thrace 
Across the darkness of the sea has blown 

A rushing surge; black sand from deep below 540 

Games boiling up; wind-beaten headlands moan, 

Fronting the full shock of the billow's blow. 

The race of Oedipus, from days of old, 
To long dead sorrows add new sorrows' weight. 

Some god has sent them sufferings manifold. 
None may release another, for their fate 

Through generations loosens not its hold. 
Now is their last root cut, their last light fled, 

Because of frenzy's curse, words overbold, 
And dust, the gods' due, on the bloodstained dead. 550 

O Zeus, what human sin restricts thy might? 
Thou art unsnared by all-ensnaring sleep 

Or tireless months. Unaging thou dost keep 
Thy court in splendor of Olympian light. 

And as this law was true when time began, 
Tomorrow and forever it shall be: 

Naught beyond measure in the life of man 
From fate goes free.

ANTIGONE 

For hope, wide-ranging, that brings good to some, 
To many is a false lure of desire 560 

Lijjht-minded, giddy; and until the fire 
Scorches their feet, they know not what will come. 

Wise is the famous adage: that to one 
Whom the gods madden, evil, soon or late, 

Seems good; then can he but a moment shun 
The stroke of fate. 

But Haemon comes, of your two sons the last. 
Is his heart heavy for the sentence passed 

Upon Antigone, his promised bride, 
And for his hope of marriage now denied? 570 

Enter haemon 
creon: 

We soon shall know better than seers could tell us. 

My son, Antigone is condemned to death. 

Nothing can change my sentence. Have you learned 

Her fate and come here in a storm of anger, 

Or do you love me and support my acts? 
haemon: 

Father, I am your son. Your greater knowledge 

Will trace the pathway that I mean to follow. 

My marriage cannot be of more importance 

Than to be guided always by your wisdom. 



CREON: 



Yes, Haemon, this should be the law vou live by! 580 

In all things to obey your father's will. 

Men pray for children round them in their homes 

Only to see them dutiful and quick 

With hatred to requite their father's foe, 

With honor to repav their father's friend. 

But what is there to say of one whose children 

Prove to be valueless? That he has fathered 

Grief for himself and laughter for his foes. 

Then, Haemon, do not, at the lure of pleasure, 

Unseat your reason for a woman's sake. 500 

This comfort soon grows cold in your embrace: 

A wicked wife to share your bed and home. 

Is there a deeper wound than to find worthless 

The one vou love? Turn from this girl with loathing, 

As from an enemv, and let her go 

To get a husband in the world below. 

For I have found her openly rebellious, 

Her only out of all the city. Therefore, 

19 



SOPHOCLES 

1 w ill not break the oath that 1 have sworn. 

I will have her killed. Vainly she will invoke 600 

The bond of kindred blood the gods make sacred. 

If 1 permit disloyalty to breed 

In my own house, 1 nurture it in strangers. 

lb- w ho is righteous w ith his kin is righteous 

In the state also. Therefore, 1 cannot pardon 

One who does violence to the laws or thinks 

To dictate to his rulers; for whoe\ er 

May be the man appointed by the city, 

That man must be obeyed in e\ erything, 

Little or great, just or unjust. And surely 610 

He who was thus obedient would be found 

As good a ruler as he was a subject; 

And in a storm of spears he would stand fast 

With loyal courage at his comrade's side. 

But disobedience is the worst of evils. 

For it is this that ruins cities; this 

.Makes our homes desolate; armies of allies 

Through this break up in rout. But most men find 

Their happiness and safety in obedience. 

Therefore we must support the law, and never 620 

Be beaten by a woman. It is better 

To fall by a man's hand, if we must fall, 

Than to be known as weaker than a girl. 
chorus: 

We may in our old age have lost our judgment, 

And yet to us you seem to have spoken wisely. 
haemon: 

The gods have given men the gift of reason, 

Greatest of all things that we call our own. 

I have no skill, nor do I wish to have it, 

To show where you have spoken wrongly. Yet 

Some other's thought, beside your own, might prove 630 

To be of value. Therefore it is my duty, 

My natural duty as your son, to notice, 

On your behalf, all that men say, or do. 

Or find to blame. For your frown frightens them, 

So that the citizen dares not say a word 

That would offend you. I can hear, however, 

Murmurs in darkness and laments for her. 

They say: 'No woman ever less deserved 

Her doom, no woman ever was to die 

So shamefully for deeds so glorious. 640 

For when her brother fell in bloody battle, 

She would not let his body lie unburied 

20 



ANTIGONE 

To be devoured by carrion dogs or birds. 

Does such a woman not deserve reward, 

Reward of golden honor?' This I hear, 

A rumor spread in secrecy and darkness. 

Father, I prize nothing in life so highly 

As your well-being. How can children have 

A nobler honor than their father's fame 

Or father than his son's? Then do not think 650 

Your mood must never alter; do not feel 

Your word, and yours alone, must be correct. 

For if a man believes that he is right 

And only he, that no one equals him 

In what he says or thinks, he will be found 

Empty when searched and tested. Because a man 

Even if he be wise, feels no disgrace 

In learning many things, in taking care 

Not to be over-rigid. You have seen 

Trees on the margin of a stream in winter: 660 

Those yielding to the flood save every twig, 

And those resisting perish root and branch. 

So, too, the mariner who never slackens 

His taut sheet overturns his craft and spends 

Keel uppermost the last part of his voyage. 

Let your resentment die. Let yourself change. 

For I believe— if I, a younger man, 

May have a sound opinion— it is best 

That men by nature should be wise in all things. 

But most men find they cannot reach that goal; 670 

And when this happens, it is also good 

To learn to listen to wise counselors.

Sir, when his words are timely, you should heed them. 

And Haemon, you should profit by his words. 

Each one of you has spoken reasonably.

How to behave by men as young as he?

Not to do wrong. If I am young, ignore

That sin brought death upon me. But if the sin 
Lies in my judges, I could wish for them 

No harsher fate than they have decreed for me. 860

You elders, you leaders of Thebes, behold me, behold!

But naught from the terrible power of fate is free- 
Neither war, nor city walls high-towered, 
Nor wealth, nor black ships beaten by the sea. 

He too bowed down beneath his doom, 
The son of Dryas, swift-angered Edonian king, 

Shut fast in a rockv prison's gloom.

Grasping the pointed shuttle that pierced through

ANTIGONE 

I could no longer understand their language. 

It was drowned out in a strange, savage clamor, 

Shrill, evil, frenzied, inarticulate. 

The whirr of wings told me their murderous talons 

Tore at each other. Filled with dread, I then 

Made trial of burnt sacrifice. The altar 

Was fully kindled, but no clear, bright flame 

Leaped from the offering; only fatty moisture 930 

Oozed from the flesh and trickled on the embers, 

Smoking and sputtering. The bladder burst, 

And scattered in the air. The folds of fat 

Wrapping the thigh-bones melted and left them bare. 

Such was the failure of the sacrifice, 

That did not yield the sign that I was seeking. 

I learned these things from this boy's observation; 

He is my guide as I am guide to others. 

Your edict brings this suffering to the city, 

For every hearth of ours has been defiled 940 

And every altar. There the birds and dogs 

Have brought their carrion, torn from the corpse 

Of ill-starred Polyneices. Hence, the gods 

Refuse our prayers, refuse our sacrifice, 

Refuse the flame of our burnt-offerings. 

No birds cry clearly and auspiciously, 

For they are glutted with a slain man's blood. 

Therefore, my son, consider what has happened. 

All men are liable to grievous error; 950 

But he who, having erred, does not remain 

Inflexible, but rather makes amends 

For ill, is not unwise or unrewarded. 

Stubborn self-will incurs the charge of folly. 

Give to the fallen the honors he deserves 

And do not stab him. Are you being brave 

When you inflict new death upon the dead? 

Your good I think of; for your good I speak, 

And a wise counselor is sweet to hear 

When the advice he offers proves of value. 

Old man, all of you shoot your arrows at me 960 

Like archers at a target. You have used 

Even the art of prophecy in your plotting. 

Long have the tribe of prophets traded in me, 

Like a ship's cargo. Drive whatever bargain 

May please you, buy, sell, heap up for yourself 

Silver of Sardis, gold of India. Yet

A time will come, and will not linger coming, 
That will awaken in your house the wailing 
Of men and women. Hatred shakes the cities, 
Hatred of you. Their sons are mangled corpses, ioio 

Hallowed with funeral rites by dogs or beasts 
Or birds who bear the all-polluting stench 
To every city having hearth or altar. 
You goaded me, and therefore like an archer 
I shoot my angry arrows at your heart, 
Sure arrows; you shall not escape their sting.

On younger men, and let him learn to speak 
With a more temperate tongue, and school his heart 
To feelings finer than his present mood. 1020

Thou art known by many a name. 

O Bacchus! To thee we call. 

Cadmean Semcle's glory and pride, 
Begotten of Zeus, whose terrible lightnings flame, 

Whose thunders appall. 
Bacchus, thou dost for us all in thy love provide. 

Over Icaria thou dost reign, 1050 

And where the worshippers journey slow 

To the rites of Eleusis, where mountains shield 
The multitudes crossing Demeter's welcoming plain. 
Thou makest this mother-city of maenads thine own, 

A city beside the rippling flow 
Of the gentle river, beside the murderous field 

Where the teeth of the dragon were sown. 

In the torches' wind-blown flare 

Thou art seen, in their flicker and smoke. 

Where the two- fold peaks of Parnassus gleam, 1060 

Corycian nymphs, as they move through the ruddy glare, 

Thee, Bacchus, invoke. 
They move in their dance beside the Castalian stream. 

O Bacchus, guardian divine! 

Down from the slopes of Nysa's hills 

Where a mantle of ivy covers the ground, 
From headlands rich with the purple grape and the vine, 
Thou comest to us, thou comest. O be not long! 

Thy triumph the echoing citv fills. 
The streets are loud with thy praises; the highways 

resound, 1070 

Resound with immortal song. 

Thou honorest highly our Theban city, 
Thou, and thy mother by lightning slain.

Our people sicken. O Bacchus have pity! 

Across the strait with its moaning wave, 
Down from Parnassus, come thou again! 

Come with thy healing feet, and save!

Jubilant stars with their breath of fire, 
Offspring of Zeus, appear before us! 1080 

Lord of the tumult of night, appear! 
With the frenzied dance of thy maenad choir, 

Bacchus, thou giver of good, draw near!

You of the house of Cadmus and Amphion, 

No man's estate can ever be established 

Firmly enough to warrant praise or blame. 

Fortune, from day to day, exalts the lucky 

And humbles the unlucky. No one knows 

Whether his present lot can long endure. 

For Creon once was blest, as I count blessings; 1090 

He had saved this land of Cadmus from its foes; 

He was the sovereign and ruled alone, 

The noble father of a royal house. 

And now, all has been lost. Because a man 

Who has forfeited his joy is not alive, 

He is a living corpse. Heap, if you will, 

Your house with riches; live in regal pomp.

Are worth not even the shadow of a vapor 

Put in the balance against joy alone. 1100

1 l B.YDH i : 

Thebans, 1 heard you talking here Together 
When 1 was on my way to greet the goddess, 
Pallas Athene, and to pray to her. 
Just as 1 loosed the fastening of the door, 
The words that told of my calamity 
Struck heavily upon my ear. In terror 
1 fell back fainting in my women's arms. 
But now, repeat your storv. 1 shall hear it 

As one who is not ignorant of grief. 1120 

messenger: 

My Ladv, 1 will bear witness to what I saw, 

And will omit no syllable of the truth. 

Why should 1 comfort you with words that later 

Would prove deceitful? Truth is always best. 

Across the plain 1 guided my Lord Creon 

To where unpitied Polyneices lay, 

A corpse mangled by dogs. Then we besought 

Hecate, goddess of the roads, and Pluto 

To moderate their wrath, and to show mercy. 

We washed the dead with ceremonial water. 1 1 30 

Gathering the scattered fragments that remained. 

With fresh-cut boughs we burned them. We heaped up 

A mound of native earth above his ashes. 

Then we approached the cavern of Death's bride, 

The rock-floored marriage-chamber. W'hile as yet 

We were far distant, someone heard the sound 

Of loud lament in that unhallowed place, 

And came to tell our master. As the King 

Drew near, there floated through the air a voice, 

Faint, indistinct, that uttered a bitter cry. 1140 

The King burst out in anguish: 'Can it be 

That I, in my misery, have become a prophet? 

Will this be the saddest road I ever trod? 

Mv son's voice greets me. Quickly, slaves! Go quickly! 

When you have reached the sepulcher, get through 

The opening where the stones are wrenched away, 

Get to the mouth of the burial chamber. Look, 

See if I know his voice— Haemon's, my son's— 

Or if I am deluded by the gods.' 

34 



ANTIGONE 

We followed our despairing master's bidding 1150 

And in the farthest recess of the tomb 

We found Antigone, hanging, with her veil 

Noosed round her neck. And with her we found Haemon, 

His arms flung round her waist, grieving aloud 

For his bride lost in death, his ruined marriage, 

His father's deeds. But when his father saw him, 

Creon cried piteously and going in, 

Called to him brokenly: 'My son, my son, 

What have you done? What are you thinking of? 

What dreadful thing has driven you out of your mind? 1 160 

Son, come away. I beg you. I beseech you.' 

But Haemon glared at him with furious eyes 

Instead of answering, spat in his face, 

And drew his sword. His father turned to fly 

So that he missed his aim. Immediately, 

In bitter self-reproach, the wretched boy 

Leaned hard against his sword, and drove it deep 

Into his side. Then while his life yet lingered, 

With failing strength he drew Antigone close; 

And as he lay there gasping heavily, n 70 

Over her white cheek his blood ebbed away. 

The dead lie clasped together. He is wedded, 

Not in this world but in the house of Death. 

He has borne witness that of all the evils 

Afflicting man, the worst is lack of wisdom. 

Exit EURYDICE 
CHORUS: 

What does that mean? Who can interpret it? 

The Queen has gone without a single word. 
messenger: 

It startles me. And yet I hope it means 

That hearing these dreadful things about her son, 

She will not let herself show grief in public 1 1 80 

But will lament in private with her women. 

Schooled in discretion, she will do no wrong. 
chorus: 

How can we tell? Surely too great a silence 

Is no less ominous than too loud lament.

Then I will enter. Perhaps she is concealing 

Some secret purpose in her passionate heart. 

I will find out, for you are right in saying 

Too great a silence may be ominous.

OEDIPUS THE KING 

Scene: Before the doors of the palace of oedipus at Thebes. 
A crowd of citizens are seated next to the two altars 
at the sides. In front of one of the altars stands the 

PRIEST OF ZEUS. 

Enter oedipus 

OEDIPUS: 

Why are you here as suppliants, my children, 

You in whose veins the blood of Cadmus flows? 

What is the reason for your boughs of olive, 

The fumes of incense, the laments and prayers 

That fill the city? Because I thought it wrong, 

My children, to depend on what was told me, 

I have come to you myself, I, Oedipus, 

Renowned in the sight of all. {to priest) Tell me— you are 

Their natural spokesman— what desire or fear 

Brings vou before me? I will gladly give you 10 

Such help as is in my power. It would be heartless 

Not to take pity on a plea like this. 



priest: 



King Oedipus, you see us, young and old, 

Gathered about your altars: some, mere fledglings 

Not able yet to fly; some, bowed with age; 

Some, priests, and I the priest of Zeus among them; 

And these, who are the flower of our young manhood. 

The rest of us are seated— the whole city— 

With our wreathed branches in the market places, 

Before the shrines of Pallas, before the fire 20 

By which we read the auguries of Apollo. 

Thebes, as you see yourself, is overwhelmed 

By the waves of death that break upon her head. 

No fruit comes from her blighted buds; her cattle 

Die in the fields; her wives bring forth dead children. 

A hideous pestilence consumes the city, 

Striking us down like a god armed with fire, 

Emptying the house of Cadmus, filling full 

The dark of Hades with loud lamentation. 

I and these children have not thronged your altars 30 

Because we hold you equal to the immortals, 

But because we hold you foremost among men, 

41 



SOPHOCLES 

Both in the happenings of daily life 

And when some > iMtat ion ot the gods 

I nfronts us. I or we know that when you came here, 

Vou freed us from our bondage, the bitter tribute 

1 Ik Sphinx wrung from us by her sorceries. 

And w e know too I hat \ ou accomplished this 

Without foreknov ledge, or clue that vt e could furnish. 

\\ e think, indeed, some god befriended you, 40 

When \ ou renewed our lues. Therefore, great king, 

( ilorious in all men's eyes, we now beseech you 

To find some way of helping us, your suppliants, 

Some way the gods themselves have told you of, 

Or one that lies within our mortal power; 

For the words of men experienced in evil 

Are mighty and effectual. Oedipus! 

Rescue our city and preserve vour honor, 

Since the land hails you as her savior now 

For your past service. Never let us say 50 

That when you ruled us, we were lifted up 

Only to be thrown down. Restore the state 

And keep it forever steadfast. Bring again 

The happiness and good fortune you once brought us. 

If you are still to reign as you reign now, 

Then it is better to have men for subjects 

Than to be king of a mere wilderness, 

Since neither ship nor town has any value 

Without companions or inhabitants. 

OEDIPUS: 

I pity you, my children. Well I know 60 

What hopes have brought vou here, and well 1 know 

That all of vou are suffering. Yet your grief, 

However great, is not so great as mine. 

Each of vou suffers for himself alone, 

But my heart feels the heaviness of my sorrow, 

Your sorrow, and the sorrow of all the others. 

You have not roused me, I have not been sleeping. 

No. I have wept, wept long and bitterly, 

Treading the devious paths of anxious thought; 

And I have taken the only hopeful course 70 

That I could find. I have sent mv kinsman, Creon, 

Son of Menoeceus, to the Pvthian home 

Of Phoebus Apollo to find what word or deed 

Of mine might save the city. He has delayed 

Too long already, his absence troubles me; 

But when he comes, I pledge mvself to do 

My utmost to obev the god's command.

OEDIPUS THE KING 
PRIEST: 

Your words are timelv, for even as vou speak 
They sign to me that Creon is drawing near. 

OEDIPUS: 

O Lord Apollo! Grant he may bring to us 80 

Fortune as smiling as his smiling face. 

PRIliST: 

Surely he brings good fortune. Look! The crown 
Of bay leaves that he wears is full of berries. 

OEDIPUS: 

We shall know soon, for he is close enough 

To hear us. Brother, son of Monoeceus, speak! 

\\ 'hat news? What news do you bring us from the god? 



Enter creon 

CREON: 

Good news. If we can find the fitting way 
To end this heavy scourge, all will be well. 

OEDIPUS: 

That neither gives me courage nor alarms me. 

What does the god say? What is the oracle? 90 

CREON: 

If vou wish me to speak in public, I will do so. 
Otherwise let us go in and speak alone. 

OEDIPUS: 

Speak here before everyone. I feel more sorrow 
For their sakes than I feel for my own life. 
creon: 

Then I will give the message of Lord Phoebus: 
A plain command to drive out the pollution 
Here in our midst, and not to nourish it 
Till our disease has grown incurable. 

OEDIPUS: 

W 7 hat rite will purge us? How are we corrupted? 
creon: 

We must banish a man, or have him put to death 100 

To atone for the blood he shed, for it is blood 
That has brought this tempest down upon the city. 

OEDIPUS: 

Who is the victim whose murder is revealed? 

CREON: 

King Laius, who was our lord before you came 
To steer the city on its proper course. 

OEDIPUS: 

I know his name well, but I never saw him.

No one appeared to avenge the death of Laius.

On the dead King's behalf. So I will take

Not for a stranger will I dispel this taint, 

But for my own sake, since the murderer, 140 

Whoever he is, may strike at me as well. 

Therefore in helping Laius I help myself. 

Come, children, come! Rise from the altar steps, 

And carry away those branches. Summon here

Nothing undone. So with Apollo's aid 

We may at last be saved— or meet destruction.

You have been praving. If you heed my words 

And seek the remedy for your own disease, 

The gods will hear vour prayers, and you will find 

Relief and comfort. I myself know nothing 

About this story, nothing about the murder, 

So that unaided and without a clue 

I could not have tracked it down for any distance. 210 

And because I have onlv recently been received 

Among you as a citizen, to you all, 

And to all the rest, I make this proclamation: 

Whoever knows the man who killed King Laius, 

Let him declare his knowledge openly. 

46 



OEDIPUS THE KING 

If he himself is guilty, let him confess 

And go unpunished, except for banishment. 

Or if he knows the murderer was an alien, 

Let him by speaking earn his due reward, 

And thanks as well. But if he holds his tongue, 220 

Hoping to save himself or save a friend, 

Then let him hear what I, the King, decree 

For all who live in Thebes, the land I rule. 

No one shall give this murderer shelter. No one 

Shall speak to him. No one shall let him share 

In sacrifice or prayer or lustral rites. 

The door of every house is barred against him. 

The god has shown me that he is polluted. 

So by this edict I ally myself 

With Phoebus and the slain. As for the slayer, 230 

Whether he had accomplices or not, 

This is my solemn prayer concerning him: 

May evil come of evil; may he live 

A wretched life and meet a wretched end. 

And as for me, if I should knowingly 

Admit him as a member of my household, 

May the same fate which I invoked for others 

Fall upon me. Make my words good, I charge you, 

For love of me, Apollo, and our country 

Blasted by the displeasure of the gods. 240 

You should not have left this guilt unpurified, 

Even without an oracle to urge you, 

When a man so noble, a man who was your King, 

Had met his death. Rather, it was your duty 

To seek the truth. But now, since it is I 

Who hold the sovereignty that once was his, 

I who have wed his wife, who would have been 

Bound to him by the tie of having children 

Born of one mother, if he had had a child 

To be a blessing, if fate had not struck him down— 250 

Since this is so, I intend to fight his battle 

As though he were my father. I will leave 

Nothing undone to find his murderer, 

Avenging him and all his ancestors. 

And I pray the gods that those who disobey 

May suffer. Mav their fields bring forth no harvest, 

Their wives no children; mav the present plague, 

Or one yet worse, consume them. But as for you, 

All of you citizens who are loyal to me, 

May Justice, our champion, and all the gods 260 

Show you their favor in the days to come.

And you, great prophet, you alone can save us. 290

OEDIPUS THE KING 

Phoebus has sent an answer to our question, 
An answer that the messengers may have told you, 
Saying there was no cure for our condition 
Until we found the killers of King Laius 
And banished them or had them put to death. 
Therefore, Tiresias, do not begrudge your skill 
In the voice of birds or other prophecy, 
But save yourself, save me, save the whole city, 
Save everything that the pestilence defiles. 
We are at your mercy, and man's noblest task 300 

Is to use all his powers in helping others. 
tiresias: 

How dreadful a thing, how dreadful a thing is wisdom, 
When to be wise is useless! This I knew 
But I forgot, or else I would never have come. 

OEDIPUS: 

What is the matter? Why are you so troubled? 
tiresias: 

Oedipus, let me go home. Then you will bear 
Your burden, and I mine, more easily. 

OEDIPUS: 

Custom entitles us to hear your message. 

By being silent you harm your native land. 
tiresias: 

You do not know when, and when not to speak. 310 

Silence will save me from the same misfortune. 
oedipus: 

If you can be of help, then all of us 

Kneel and implore you not to turn away. 
tiresias: 

I refuse to pain you. I refuse to pain myself. 

It is useless to ask me. I will tell you nothing. 
oedipus: 

You utter scoundrel! You would enrage a stone! 

Is there no limit to your stubbornness? 
tiresias: 

You blame my anger and forget your own. 
oedipus: 

No one could help being angry when he heard 

How you dishonor and ignore the state. 320 

tiresias: 

What is to come will come, though I keep silent 
oedipus: 

If it must come, your duty is to speak. 

TIRESIAS: 

I will say no more. Rage to your heart's content.

To me or anyone else who sees the day?

Creon is guiltless. The evil is in you. 360 

oedipus: 

How great is the envy roused by wealth, by kingship, 

By the subtle skill that triumphs over others 

In life's hard struggle! Creon, who has been 

For years my trusted friend, has stealthily 

Crept in upon me anxious to seize my power, 

The unsought gift the city freely gave me. 

Anxious to overthrow me, he has bribed 

This scheming mountebank, this fraud, this trickster, 

Blind in his art and in everything but money! 

Your art of prophecy! When have you shown it? 370 

Not when the watch-dog of the gods was here, 

Chanting her riddle. Why did you say nothing, 

When you might have saved the city? Yet her puzzle 

Could not be solved by the first passer-by. 

A prophet's skill was needed, and you proved 

That you had no such skill, either in birds 

Or any other means the gods have given. 

But I came, I, the ignorant Oedipus, 

And silenced her. I had no birds to help me. 

I used my brains. And it is I you now 380 

Are trying to destrov in the hope of standing 

Close beside Creon's throne. You will regret 

This zeal of yours to purify the land, 

You and vour fellow-plotter. You seem old; 

Otherwise you would pay for your presumption.

In his own household he shall be shown to be 440

Whose deeds are too shameful to tell, whose murderous hands

Let his feet be swifter now than hooves of horses racing

For Zeus's son, Apollo, leaps in anger upon him, 

Armed with lightning to strike and slay, 
And the terrible Fates, unflagging, relentless, 
Follow the track of their prey. 

The words of the god have flashed from the peaks of snowy Parnassus, 

Commanding us all to seek this killer as yet unknown. 
Deep in the tangled woods, through rocks and caves he is roaming 

Like a savage bull, alone. 
On his lonely path he journeys, wretched, broken by sorrow, 

Seeking to flee from the fate he fears; 460 

But the voice from the center of earth that doomed him 
Inescapably rings in his ears.

A coward or a fool? Did you suppose

Or when I saw it, would not counter it? 

How stupid you were to reach for royal power 

Without a troop of followers or rich friends!

OEDIPUS THE KING

And yet as king I should have many duties 
That went against the grain. Then how could rule 
Be sweeter than untroubled influence? 560

Except the ones that bring me solid good. 
Now all men welcome me and wish me joy. 
Now all your suitors ask to speak with me, 
Knowing they cannot otherwise succeed. 
Why should I throw away a life like this 
For a king's life? No one is treacherous 
Who knows his own best interests. To conspire 
With other men, or to be false myself, 

Is net my nature. Put me to the test. 570 

First, go to Delphi. Ask if I told the truth 
About the oracle. Then if you find 
I have had dealings with Tiresias, kill me. 
My voice will echo yours in passing sentence. 
But base your verdict upon something more 
Than mere suspicion. Great injustice comes 
From random judgments that bad men are good 
And good men bad. To throw away a friend 
Is, in effect, to throw away your life, 

The prize you treasure most. All this, in time, 580 

Will become clear to you, for time alone 
Proves a man's honesty, but wickedness 
Can be discovered in a single day.

Sir, that is good advice, if one is prudent. 
Hasty decisions always lead to danger.

I must move quickly to retaliate. 
If I sat still and let my enemy act, 
I would lose everything that he would gain.

What do you mean? What was your accusation? 

OEDIPUS: 

He says I am the murderer of King Laius. 
jocasta: 

Did he speak from first-hand knowledge or from hearsay? 

OEDIPUS: 

He did not speak at all. His lips are pure. 

He bribed Tiresias, and that scoundrel spoke. 670 

jocasta: 

Then you can rid your mind of any fear 

That you are guiltv. Listen to me. No mortal 

Shares in the gods' foreknowledge. I can give you 

Clear proof of that. There came once to King Laius 

An oracle— I will not say from Phoebus, 

But from his priest— saying it was his fate 

That he should be struck down by his own child, 

His child and mine. But Laius, as we know, 

Was killed by foreign robbers at a place 

Where three roads came together. As for the child, 680 

When it was only three days old, its father 

Pierced both its ankles, pinned its feet together, 

And then gave orders that it be abandoned 

On a wild mountainside. So in this case 

Phoebus did not fulfill his oracle. The child 

Was not its father's murderer, and Laius 

Was not the victim of the fate he feared, 

Death at his son's hands, although just that fate 

Was what the seer predicted. Pay no heed 

To prophecies. Whatever may be needful 690 

The god himself can show us easily.

I did. That was the story, and still is. 

OEDIPUS: 

Where was it that this murder was committed?

In Phocis, where the road from Thebes divides, 

Meeting the roads from Daulia and Delphi. 700

A curse on my own head unknowingly.

But tell me one thing more, and I will know.

How did he travel? With a few men only, 
Or with his guards and servants, like a prince?

There were five of them in all, with one a herald. 
They had one carriage in which King Laius rode. 

OEDIPUS: 

It is too clear, too clear! Who told you this?

The only servant who escaped alive. 

OEDIPUS: 

And is he still here now, still in the palace?

Of Corinth was my father. Merope, 

A Dorian, was my mother. I myself 

Was foremost among all the citizens, 

Till something happened, strange, but hardly worth 

My feeling such resentment. As we sat 740 

One dav at dinner, a man who had drunk too much 

Insulted me by saying I was not 

My father's son. In spite of being angrv, 

I managed to control myself. Next day 

I asked my parents, who were both indignant 

That he had leveled such a charge against me. 

This was a satisfaction, yet the thing 

Still rankled, for the rumor grew widespread. 

At last I went to Delphi secretly. 

Apollo gave no answer to my question 750 

But sent me off, anguished and terrified, 

With fearful prophecies that I was fated 

To be mv mother's husband, to bring forth 

Children whom men could not endure to see, 

And to take my father's life. When I heard this 

I turned and fled, hoping to find at length 

Some place where I would know of Corinth only 

As a far distant land beneath the stars, 

Some place where I would never have to see 

The infamies of this oracle fulfilled. 760 

And as I went on, I approached the spot 

At which vou tell me Laius met his end. 

Now this, Jocasta, is the absolute truth. 

When I had come to where the three roads fork, 

62 



OEDIPUS THE KING 

A herald met me, walking before a carriage, 
Drawn by two colts, in which a man was seated, 
Just as you said. The old man and the herald 
Ordered me off the road with threatening gestures. 
Then as the driver pushed me to one side, 

I struck him angrily. And seeing this, 770 

The old man, as I drew abreast, leaned out 
And brought his driver's two-pronged goad down hard 
Upon my head. He paid a heavy price 
For doing that. With one blow of my staff 
I knocked him headlong from his chariot 
Flat on his back. Then every man of them 
I killed. Now if the blood of Laius flowed 
In that old stranger's veins, what mortal man 
Could be more wretched, more accursed than I? 
I whom no citizen or foreigner 780 

Mav entertain or shelter, I to whom 
No one may speak, I, I who must be driven 
From every door. No other man has cursed me, 
I have brought down this curse upon myself. 
The hands that killed him now pollute his bed! 
Am I not vile, foul, utterly unclean? 
For I must fly and never see again 
My people or set foot in my own land, 
Or else become the husband of my mother 

And put to death my father Polybus, 790 

To whom I owe my life and my upbringing. 
Men would be right in thinking that such things 
Have been inflicted by some cruel fate. 
May the gods' high and holy majesty 
Forbid that I should see that day. No! No! 
Rather than be dishonored by a doom 
So dreadful may I vanish from the earth. 
chorus: 

Sir, these are terrible things, but there is hope 
Until you have heard what the one witness says. 

OEDIPUS: 

That is the one remaining hope I have, 800 

To wait for the arrival of the shepherd. 
jocasta: 

And when he has arrived, what can he do? 

OEDIPUS: 

He can do this. If his account agrees 
With yours, I stand acquitted of this crime. 

JOCASTA: 

Was what I said of any consequence?

CHORUS: 

May piety and reverence mark my actions; 

May every thought be pure through all my days. 
May those great laws whose dwelling is in heaven 

Approve my conduct with their crown of praise: 830 

Offspring of skies that overarch Olympus, 

Laws from the loins of no mere mortal sprung, 
Unslumbering, unfailing, unforgetting, 

Filled with a godhead that is ever young. 

Pride breeds the tyrant. Insolent presumption, 

Big with delusive wealth and false renown, 
Once it has mounted to the highest rampart 

Is headlong hurled in utter ruin down. 
But pour out all thy blessings, Lord Apollo, 

Thou who alone hast made and kept us great, 840 

On all whose sole ambition is unselfish, 

Who spend themselves in service to the state. 

64 



OEDIPUS THE KING 

Let that man be accursed who is proud, 
In act unscrupulous, in thinking base, 

Whose knees in reverence have never bowed, 
In whose hard heart justice can find no place, 

Whose hands profane life's holiest mysteries, 
How can he hope to shield himself for long 

From the gods' arrows that will pierce him through? 
If evil triumphs in such ways as these, 850 

Why should we seek, in choric dance and song, 
To give the gods the praise that is their due? 

I cannot go in full faith as of old, 
To sacred Delphi or Olympian vale, 

Unless men see that what has been foretold 
Has come to pass, that omens never fail. 

All-ruling Zeus, if thou art King indeed, 
Put forth thy majesty, make good thy word, 

Faith in these fading oracles restore! 
To priest and prophet men pay little heed; 860 

Hymns to Apollo are no longer heard; 
And all religion soon will be no more.

Elders of Thebes, I thought that I should visit 

The altars of the gods to offer up 

These wreaths I carry and these gifts of incense. 

The King is overanxious, overtroubled. 

He is no longer calm enough to judge 

The present by the lessons of the past, 

But trembles before anyone who brings 

An evil prophecy. I cannot help him. 870 

Therefore, since thou art nearest, bright Apollo, 

I bring these offerings to thee. O, hear me! 

Deliver us from this defiling curse. 

His fear infects us all, as if we were 

Sailors who saw their pilot terrified.

The scales of life tip easily for the old.

That is to say he died of some disease. 

MESSENGER: 

Yes, of disease, and merely of old age. 

OEDIPUS: 

Hear that, Jocasta! Why should anyone 

Give heed to oracles from the Pythian shrine, 

Or to the birds that shriek above our heads? 

They prophesied that I must kill my father. 

But he is dead; the earth has covered him. 

And I am here, I who have never raised 

My hand against him— unless he died of grief, 920 

Longing to see me. Then I might be said 

To have caused his death. But as they stand, at least, 

The oracles have been swept away like rubbish. 

They are with Polybus in Hades, dead.

Long ago, Oedipus, I told you that.

You did, but I was blinded by my terror.

Now you need take these things to heart no longer.

And no one can foresee the future, no one. 930 

We live best when we live without a purpose 

From one day to the next. Forget your fear 

Of marrying your mother. That has happened 

To many men before this in their dreams. 

We find existence most endurable 

When such things are neglected and forgotten.

Is not enough to give me reassurance.

She killed herself. You have been spared the worst, 

Not being witnesses. Vet you shall learn 

What her fate was, so far as I remember. 

When she came in, almost beside herself, 

Clutching her hair with both her hands, she rushed 

Straight to her bedroom and slammed shut the doors i ioo 

Behind her, screaming the name of Laius— 

Laius long dead, but not her memory 

Of their own child, the son who killed his father, 

The son by whom his mother had more children. 

She cursed the bed in which she had conceived 

Husband by husband, children by her child, 

A dreadful double bond. Beyond this much 

I do not know the manner of her death, 

For with a great crv Oedipus burst in, 

Preventing us from following her fate 1200 

To its dark end. On him our gaze was fixed, 

As in a frenzy he ran to and fro, 

Calling: 'Give me a sword! Give me a sword! 

W T here is that wife who is no wife, that mother, 

That soil where I was sower and was sown?' 

And as he raved, those of us there did nothing, 

Some more than mortal power directed him. 

With a wild shriek, as though he had some sign, 

He hurled himself against the double doors, 

Forcing the bars out of their loosened sockets, 12 10 

And broke into his room. There was the Queen, 

Hanged in a noose, still swinging back and forth. 

When he saw this, the King cried out in anguish, 

Untied the knotted cord in which she swung, 

And laid the wretched woman on the ground. 

What happened then was terrible to see. 

He tore the golden brooches from her robe, 

Lifted them up as high as he could reach,

Shrieking, 'No more, no more shall my eyes see 1220

What I have suffered. They have looked too long 
On those whom they ought never to have seen. 
They never knew those whom I longed to see. 
Blind, blind! Let them be blind!' With these wild words 
He stabbed and stabbed his eyes. At every blow, 
The dark blood dyed his beard, not sluggish drops, 
But a great torrent like a shower of hail. 
A two-fold punishment of two-fold sin 

Broke on the heads of husband and of wife. 1230 

Their happiness was once true happiness, 
But now disgrace has come upon them, death, 
Sorrow, and ruin, every earthly ill

Would bring down his own curse upon his house. 1240 

He has no guide and no strength of his own. 

His pain is unendurable. This too 

You will see. They are drawing back the bars. 

The sight is loathsome and yet pitiful.

Hideous, hideous! I have seen nothing so dreadful, 
Ever before! 
I can look no more. 
Oedipus, Oedipus! What madness has come upon you? 
What malignant fate 

Has leaped with its full weight, 1250 

Has struck you down with an irresistible fury, 
And born you off as its prey? 

Poor wretch! There is much that I yearn 
To ask of you, much I would learn; 
But I cannot. The sight of you fills me with horror! 
I shudder and turn away.

How could vou put out your eyes, still another infamous deed? 
What god, what demon, induced you to quench their light?

Apollo who crushed me beneath this unbearable burden; 

But it was my hand, mine, that struck the blow. 
Why should I see? What sight could have given me pleasure?

oedipus: What is there now to love? What greeting can cheer me? 
Lead me away, 
Quicklv, quickly! O lead me out of the country 

To a distant land! I am bevond redemption 
Accursed, bevond hope lost, the one man living 
Whom all the gods most hate.

Your fruitless wisdom and your wretched fate. 



oedipus: Mv curses be upon him, whoever freed 1290

chorus: I too would have had it so. 

Oedipus: Then would I never have been my father's killer. 
Now all men know 
That I am the infamous son who defiled his mother, 

That I shared the bed of the father who gave me being. 
And if there is sorrow beyond any mortal sorrow, 

I have brought it upon my head. 1300 

chorus: I cannot say that you have acted wisely. 

Alive and blind? You would be better dead. 



OEDIPUS: 

Give me no more advice, and do not tell me 

That I was wrong. What I have done is best. 

For if I still had eyesight when I went 

Down to the underworld, how could I bear 

To see my father and my wretched mother? 

After the terrible wrong I did them both, 

It would not have been punishment enough 

If I had hanged myself. Or do you think 13 10 

That I could find enjoyment in the sight 

Of children born as mine were born? No! No! 

Nor in the sight of Thebes with its towered walls 

And sacred statues of the gods. For I— 

Who is so wretched?— I, the foremost Theban, 

Cut myself off from this by my own edict 

That ordered everyone to shun the man 

Polluting us, the man the gods have shown 

To be accursed, and of the house of Laius. 

Once I laid bare my shame, could I endure 1320 

To look my fellow-citizens in the face? 

Never! Never! If I had found some way 

Of choking off the fountain of my hearing, 

I would have made a prison of my body, 

Sightless and soundless. It would be sweet to live 

Beyond the reach of sorrow. Oh, Cithaeron! 

Why did you give me shelter rather than slay me 

As soon as I was given to you? Then 

No one would ever have heard of my begetting. 

Polybus, Corinth, and the ancient house 1330 

I thought mv forebears'! You reared me as a child. 

My fair appearance covered foul corruption, 

I am impure, born of impurity. 

Oh, narrow crossroad where the three paths meet!

CREON: 



I have not come to mock you, Oedipus, 

Or to reproach you for any evil-doing. 1360 

(to attendants) You there. If you have lost all your respect 

For men, revere at least the Lord Apollo, 

Whose flame supports all life. Do not display 

So nakedly pollution such as this, 

Evil that neither earth nor holy rain 

Nor light of day can welcome. Take him in, 

Take him in, quickly. Piety demands 

That only kinsmen share a kinsman's woe. 

OEDIPUS: 

Creon, since you have proved my fears were groundless, 
Since you have shown such magnanimity 1370 

To one so vile as I, grant my petition. 
I ask you not for my sake but your own.

CREON: 

What is it that you beg so urgently? 
oedipus: 

Drive me away at once. Drive me far off. 

Let me not hear a human voice again.

I have delayed only because I wished 

To have the god reveal to me my duty. 
oedipus: 

But his command was certain: put to death 

The unholy parricide. And I am he. 
creon: 

True. But as things are now, it would be better 1 380 

To find out clearly what we ought to do. 
oedipus: 

An oracle for a man so miserable? 
creon: 

Yes. Even you will now believe the god. 
oedipus: 

I will. Creon, I charge you with this duty. 

Accept it, I entreat you. Give to her 

Who lies within such burial as you wish, 

For she belongs to you. You will perform 

The proper obsequies. But as for me, 

Let not my presence doom my father's city, 

But send me to the hills, to Mount Cithaeron, 1390 

My mountain, which my mother and my father 

Chose for my grave. So will I die at last 

By the decree of those who sought to slay me. 

And yet I know I will not die from sickness 

Or anything else. I was preserved from death 

To meet some awful, some mysterious end. 

My own fate does not matter, only my children's. 

Creon, my sons need give you no concern, 

For they are men, and can find anywhere 

A livelihood. But Creon, my two girls! 1400 

How lost, how pitiable! They always ate 

Their daily bread with me, at my own table, 

And had their share of everything I touched. 

Take care of them! O Creon, take care of them! 

And one thing more— if I could only touch them 

And with them weep. O prince, prince, grant me this! 

Grant it, O noble Creon! If I touched them, 

I could believe I saw them once again.

Scene: The countryside. In the background there is a thick 
grove of trees, on the edge of which stands a large rock. 



Enter oedipus in rags, guided by antigone 

OEDIPUS: 

Antigone, where is your blind old father? 

Still in the countryside, or near some city? 

Who is it that will give his grudging gifts, 

His scanty hospitality, today 

To wandering Oedipus? I ask for little. 

Though I get less than little, it is enough; 

For hardship and the years that have been my lot, 

The long years, and nobility of mind 

Have taught me patience. Daughter, if you can see 

A place of rest, either unhallowed ground 10 

Or sacred grove, help me to find a seat. 

For we must ask some citizen where we are, 

And we must do whatever we are bidden. 
antigone: 

Father, the walls and towers that I see 

Guarding the city seem to be far away, 

And this spot where we stand is surely sacred. 

For laurels, vines, and olives grow profusely, 

And deep within, a throng of nightingales 

Pour out their eloquence. So rest here, Father. 

There is a natural seat here in the rock. 20 

You have come a long, long way, and you are old. 
oedipus: 

Then seat the blind man and take care of him. 
antigone: 

If time can teach me, I have learned that lesson. 
oedipus: 

Where have we come to, Daughter? Can you tell me? 
antigone: 

Athens I know well, but this place is strange. 

OEDIPUS: 

You say what everyone we met has said.

Hearing from her of your most timely coming 
To give us aid in our perplexity— 

COUNTRYMAN: 

Speak not a word more. Let your story wait 
Till you have come from that forbidden ground. 
oedipus: 

Forbidden ground? To which god is it sacred? 

COUNTRYMAN: 

Holy and unapproachable, it belongs 40 

To the terrible daughters of Darkness and of Earth. 

OEDIPUS: 

Whose awful name am I to hear and pray to? 

COUNTRYMAN: 

We call them the Eumenides, the all-seeing, 
The Goddesses Benignant. But elsewhere 
Men do them honor under other names. 
oedipus: 

May they receive their suppliant graciously! 
This is the seat that I will never leave.

Not to refuse to tell me what I ask.

Speak. You will find that I shall not refuse you.

OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 
OEDIPUS: 

Then what is the name of the place that we have entered? 
countryman: 

You shall hear everything that I can tell you. 

The whole vicinity is hallowed ground, 

Held by august Poseidon and the Titan, 

Prometheus the fire-bringing god. The spot 

On which you stand is the mainstay of Athens, 60 

Known as the Brazen Threshold of the land. 

The neighboring fields claim for their founding lord 

Colonus the horseman, and the people bear 

His name as well. Now you may understand 

This is a country honored not in legend 

But in the hearts of its inhabitants. 

OEDIPUS: 

Then it is true that men are living here? 
countryman: 

It is. They are the namesakes of the hero. 

OEDIPUS: 

Have they a king? Or do they rule themselves? 

COUNTRYMAN: 

The city's king is the ruler of this region. 70 

OEDIPUS: 

Who is this man, sovereign in word and act? 

COUNTRYMAN: 

Theseus, the son of Aegeus, king before him. 

OEDIPUS: 

And could a messenger be sent to him? 
countryman: 

What should the man say? Urge the King to come? 

OEDIPUS: 

By a small service the King will profit greatly. 

COUNTRYMAN: 

How, in your blindness, can you bring him profit? 

OEDIPUS: 

In every word I utter there shall be vision. 

COUNTRYMAN: 

Sir, let me teach you how to save yourself, 

For it appears to me your birth is noble 

In spite of your ill-fortune. Stay where you are, 80 

Where you first showed yourself, until I tell 

The people of Colonus, not of Athens, 

All that has happened here. They will decide 

Whether you are to leave or to remain. 

Exit COUNTRYMAN

Tell me, Antigone, is the stranger gone?

OEDIPUS: 

queens, O goddesses, terrible to behold! 
Since my first refuge was this shrine of yours, 

(.'lose not VOUT hearts tu Phoebus and to me. 90 

When by his oracle the god proclaimed 
The many evils that have come upon me, 
This too he promised: that after many years 

1 should at length attain my final rest, 
Rest from mv sorrow and my weariness, 

When in some land that made a stranger welcome 

I found the shrine of the Dread Goddesses; 

And that my presence in the land would bring 

A blessing upon those who sheltered me, 

But upon those who banished me a curse. 100 

The god forewarned that signs of this would come, 

Perhaps in earthquake, thunder, or the flash 

Of Zeus's lightning. Now it is clear to me 

That in my journey some sure prompting led me 

On to this grove— your prompting, goddesses. 

How else could 1 have come upon you here, 

When first I set my foot within the land, 

I who live sparely, you whom wine delights not? 

How else could I have found this holy seat 

Not hewn by mortal hands? Then, goddesses, no 

According to the prophecy of Apollo, 

Grant that I may forthwith attain my goal, 

The close of my life's course, unless I seem 

Unworthy of such grace, I who have been 

Slave to the heaviest ills that men endure. 

Hear me, kind daughters of primeval Darkness! 

Hear me, O city held in highest honor: 

Athens, the city of the mighty Pallas! 

Have pity on this poor phantom, for in truth 

I am no more the Oedipus of old. 120 

ANTIGONE: 

Hush, Father, hush. Some old men, white with years, 
Have come to seek you in your sanctuary. 

OEDIPUS: 

I will say nothing. Hide me among the trees 

Till I discover what those men will say, 

For we are safe only when we have knowledge. 

Exeunt. Enter the chorus

OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 

Search for him! Search! Beware! 
Where is he? Where has he fled? 

Where is he hidden, where? 
This man without shame, without dread. 
Surely he must be a stranger— not one of our race. 

Wandering here from afar has the old man come. 
Who else would enter the sacred, untrodden place? 
All-powerful maidens, whose name we tremble to say! 
We pass your shrine turning our eyes away, 
Breathing our words of devotion with lips that are dumb. 
But now we have learned that an impious man is here, 
Whose heart is untouched with awe in this holy spot. 
Closely I search, for I know he is hidden near, 
Yet I find him not.

Hear me! Give heed! Rashly, profanely you tread 
The inviolate grove where water and honey flow 
In libations together. Too far, too far you go! 
Can you hear us, old man? Do our voices reach you there? 

Come back to us here, where speech is allowed to all. 
Then you may say what you will; but speak not a word 
Until you have left that ground where no foot may fall, 
No voice may be heard.

Have pity, then, on me! 
On me, here pleading with you face to face. 

My eyes are as clear as yours are; I might be 
A child of your own race. 
For my father, only for him I plead. 

Be mindful of him in his need. 
You are like gods to us. We stand before you 

In supplication and in fear. 

By your wife, your child, by the god whom you revere, 
By your most prized possession I implore you: 

Grant us your mercy, let us hear 
Words that we scarcely hope to have you say. 

What mortal is there who can disobey 
A god who leads the way? 

Truly, my child, we pity both of you 
For both have suffered; but because we fear 
The judgment of the gods, we can say nothing 
Beyond what we have said to you already. 



What is fame worth or golden reputation, 
When no good comes of it? Men say that Athens, 
Above all cities, reverences the gods, 
Above all cities, shelters the afflicted,

Helps to spread rumors. When they reach the King, 

You can be certain that he will not linger, 

For every land has learned your name, old man. 

Even if he is resting or asleep, 

When once he hears of you he will come quickly.

Ever since you outgrew the childish years 

That needed care, and came to womanhood, 

You led me, old and weary, on my journeys. 

Time after time you roamed the savage forest, 

Hungry and barefoot. Time after time you suffered 

From drenching rain and the fierce heat of the sun, 

Giving no thought to home with all its comforts 

So that your father might not be neglected. 

Ismene, you stole out of Thebes unnoticed, 330 

Bringing the oracles that the gods had uttered 

Concerning me. And you assumed the office 

Of faithful sentinel on my behalf, 

When I was being driven from the land.

You are not empty-handed. I am certain 

You have a message that 1 dread to hear.

Your ill-starred sons— this is the news I bring. 

At first, when they considered in cold blood 

The ancestral curse that had not loosed its hold 

On your unhappy house, they were content 

To give the throne to Creon, that the city 

Might not become unclean. But now, some god 

And their own evil minds have maddened them, 

Rousing them to a sinful rivalry 

For the title and authority of king. 350

Polyneices has been driven from his throne, 

And from the country, by his younger brother. 

And it is rumored that he now has fled 

For refuge to the vale of Argos. There 

He makes a new alliance by his marriage 

And raises up an army of new friends. 

He means to have proud Argos conquer Thebes 

Or lift up Thebes triumphant to the stars. 

This is not idle fancy; they have done 

These fearful deeds. But where the gods will bring 360

Appoint a time for my deliverance?

OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 

On that first day, was shaken by a tempest, 
When death by stoning was my dearest wish, 
I could find none to give me what I longed for. 
And later when my anguish was allayed, 
And I began to feel that my misdeeds 
Had been too heavily punished by my passion, 
Then was it that the city, long delaying, 
Drove me away by force. And my two sons, 
Who could have helped their father, would not help him, 
Would not so much as speak a single word, 420 

But let me wander forth, from that time forward 
A homeless outcast brought to beggary. 
These two, these daughters, have done everything 
That women could do. They have given me 
Food, a safe shelter, filial loyalty: 

While their two brothers, turning against their father, 
Snatched at the throne and scepter of a king. 
Never shall they win Oedipus for an ally! 
Never shall any benefit come to them 

From ruling over Thebes! That I am sure of 430 

Now that I hear Ismene's oracles, 
And now that I consider those of old, 
Those that Apollo has fulfilled at last. 
Therefore, let them send Creon after me, 
Creon or any Theban who has power. 
Because if you are willing to assist me— 
You, strangers, with your great protectresses, 
The dreadful goddesses who guard your land— 
You will secure deliverance for yourselves 
And bring disaster on my enemies. 440

To your own kindred, if I get hold of you—

You will soon suffer. There are other ways.

How? Through your daughters: one has been seized already 790 
And sent away; the other will soon be taken.

And yet you have slighted our authority, 

Burst in upon us, seized and carried away 

Whoever took your fancy, as if you thought 

That there were no men left within my city, 

Or only slaves, and I was a mere nothing. 

Thebes did not teach you this outrageous conduct. 

To breed rebellious sons is not her custom; 

Nor would she praise you if she saw you now, 

Robbing me, yes, robbing the gods themselves 

By kidnapping their wretched suppliants. 890 

If I were standing now on Theban soil, 

I would not drag off anything by force, 

However just my claim to it might be, 

Without your ruler's sanction. I would know 

How I, as a foreigner, should live among you.

OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 

You bring dishonor upon an innocent city, 

Your own Thebes; and although you have lived long, 

You are still stupid. I have told you once, 

And I tell you again now: bring his daughters back 

Without delay, unless you wish to live 900 

Among us as an alien, a forced guest. 

These are not merely words. My heart is in them. 

CHORUS: 

You hear that, stranger? That is our judgment of you; 
Your land is noble and your deeds are base. 
creon: 

Theseus, how could I ever think that Athens 

Lacked manliness or wisdom? I supposed 

Her citizens would never be so eager 

To serve my kinsmen as to shelter them 

Against my will. This country, I was certain, 

Would show no hospitality to a man 910 

Steeped in pollution: the slayer of his father, 

And partner of an unholy marriage-bed, 

Mother with son. Knowing the Hill of Ares 

Makes wise decisions and does not allow 

Such vagabonds to stay here, I felt free 

To seize this prize. Yet I would not have touched him 

If he had not called down a bitter curse 

On me and on my race, an injury 

Which justified, I thought, my giving back 

Evil for evil. Anger does not grow old; 920 

Only the dead escape the sting of it. 

You can, of course, act any way you choose, 

For I am helpless, though my cause is just. 

Yet I will do my best, old as I am, 

To follow the example that you set me. 

OEDIPUS: 

What bare-faced insolence, Creon! Whose old age 

Do you think has been dishonored, yours or mine? 

You have poured out a stream of accusations: 

Murder and incest, all the disastrous things 

That my hard fate has forced me to endure. 930 

So the gods willed it, nursing their long displeasure, 

Doubtless, against my house. For I myself 

Cannot be charged with any deliberate crime 

For which, as retribution, I was driven 

To sin against my parents and myself. 

Tell me. If through some oracle my father 

Was destined to be slain by his own son, 

Could I be justly blamed— I, not yet born,

Or strike hack instantly? Loving your life, 
You would, I am sure, repay him blow for blow 
Without a long search for Your legal sanction. 
Yet that was the catastrophe I encountered, 
Led by the gods. If he could live again, 
My father himself would not deny the truth 
Of what I say. But you— lacking all sense 
Of fitness, babbling, making no distinction 

Between what should and what should not be talked of— 970 
You, here in public, heap your insults on me. 
And this, you think, is the proper time to flatter 
The famous Theseus and to proclaim how well 
The Athenian state is governed. Yet in giving 
Such lavish praises, you forget that Athens 
Exxels in reverent worship of the gods; 
For you had planned to abduct me, an old man 
Who had sought the gods' protection. You have seized 
My daughters and have tried to seize me also. 
Hence, I invoke these goddesses, with prayers 980 

Beseeching them to come to my assistance, 
To fight in my defence, that you may learn 
What manner of men they are who guard this city.

Has snared the hunter; no ill-gotten gains 

Can be kept long. But do not expect your helper; 

For daring and insolent though you are, I know 

You did not undertake this singlehanded. 

No, you had some accomplice whom you trusted 1000 

When you came here. He must be hunted down. 

Athens must be the master and not he. 

Can you grasp any part of what I have said? 

Or do you think you can ignore my words, 

As you ignored those warnings that you heard 

When you first put your scheming into practice?

Rest there, for you were forced away, forlorn 

And desolate. Tell me what happened, briefly.

And he should be the one to tell the story.

Sir, do not wonder that I give my daughters 

A welcome so prolonged, so deeply felt. 

They were restored when I had lost all hope 

Of seeing them again. You, you alone 1080 

Made this joy possible. You, you alone 

Have rescued them. May all the gods reward you, 

You and your country, even as I would do; 

For only here in Athens have I found 

Truth, piety, and justice. I can give 

Only these words by way of recompense: 

All that I have I have from you alone. 

Stretch forth your hand, O King, that I may touch it, 

And kiss your cheek, if such an act is lawful. 

No! No! What have I said? How could I hope 1090

As to the fight, why should I boast of it, 

When these two girls will tell you how it was won? 

But, Oedipus, advise me on a matter 

Which I have just been told of, as I came here. 

It seems a trifling thing, vet it is strange; 

And men, being mortal, should treat nothing lightly. 

OEDIPUS: 

I have not heard what happened. Let me know. i

A man has rushed up to Poseidon's altar, 

Where I was sacrificing when I first 

Came hurrving here to help vou. There he sits, 

A suppliant of the god. He seems to be 

Your kinsman, Oedipus, though not a Theban.

Where does he come from? What does he want of me? 

THESEUS: 

He onlv asks a few brief words with you. 
You have no need, he says, to feel concerned.

Then why does he need the safety of the altar? 

THESEUS:

And then go back unharmed the way he came. 

OEDIPUS: 

W'ho can he be who has sought the god's protection?

Surelv you know of someone who might seek 

This favor of you, some kinsman of yours from Argos. 

OEDIPUS: 

No more, no more, my friend! th.: What is it troubles you? 
oedipus: 

Do not ask that of me! th.: Ask what? Come, tell me.

OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 
OEDIPUS: 

I know the suppliant now from what you have said. 

THESEUS: 

Who is he? How could I object to him? 

OEDIPUS: 

He is my hated son. No one on earth 

Could speak to me whom I would loathe so much. 1130 

THESEUS: 

He cannot force you to act against your will. 
Can you be hurt by merely listening to him? 

OEDIPUS: 

I hate the very sound of my son's voice. 
Do not compel me to yield to you in this. 

THESEUS: 

Does not his being a suppliant compel you? 
Consider, sir. You must respect the god. 

ANTIGONE: 

Father, I am young, I know, to give advice, 

But listen to me. Let the King satisfy 

His conscience and do honor to the god, 

And let my brother and Ismene's come. 1 140 

You need not fear that anything he might say 

To injure you could shake your resolution. 

To hear him speak— what harm could come of that? 

For wickedness is betrayed by what is spoken. 

He is your son. Whatever wrong he did you, 

However impious or infamous, 

You cannot, cannot do him wrong yourself! 

Let him come, Father! Others besides you 

Have evil children and are quick to anger; 

But they can be persuaded, and their friends 1 150 

Cast a charm over them that melts their mood. 

Think of the past. Think of your father and mother, 

And what you have endured because of them. 

You know the evil consequence that follows 

From evil anger. How could you forget, 

Blind as you are? Do not refuse us, Father! 

Those who ask justice should not have to beg. 

Men should repay the benefits they receive. 

OEDIPUS: 

The benefit you ask of me is bitter, 

Antigone. But be it as you wish. 1 160 

Yet if that man must come, take care, my friend, 

To keep this life of mine out of his clutches.

Beyond Ins fitting season, pain and grief,

And jov is but a phantom of the past. 

Then soon or late the doom of Hades, death, 
Comes with no dance, no lyre, no marriage song,

Incomparably best is not to be. 
And next to this, once a man sees the day, 

Is with all speed to hasten whence he came; 
After youth's trifling joy, he is not free, 
He must endure his lot as best he may:

His scraps of food to stay his pitiful hunger 

No better than all the rest. This I have learned 

Too late, too late. No man alive has been 

So vile as I have in neglecting you. 

I will bear witness to my own misdeeds. 

Yet Zeus himself, in everything he does, 

Has mercy seated by him on his throne. 

May she then come and stand beside you also. 

There may be remedy for the wrongs I did you. 1210 

They can be made no worse. Why are you silent? 

Speak to me, Father! Do not turn away! 

What! Send me off? Dishonor me? Not a word 

To explain your anger? Sisters, he is your father. 

Get him to change his mind. Get him to break 

His stern, forbidding silence. Do not let him 

Dismiss a suppliant in disgrace, unanswered. 

ANTIGONE:

Has brought you here. Something in your appeal 
May kindle happiness within his heart, 1220

Before whose altar I was found. Your King

And leave unharmed. I beg you Father, Sisters, 

Strangers— I beg you all to keep this promise 

Inviolate. Now, Father, let me tell you 

Why I have come. I am a fugitive 1230 

Because I claimed my right, as first-born son, 

To assume your kingship. Therefore my young brother 

Drove me away. Eteocles was victorious 

Neither by argument nor by force of arms, 

But by persuading Thebes to take his part. 

The Furies brought this curse upon your house. 

So I supposed, and so the oracles told me 

In Dorian Argos. There it was I swore 

A solemn oath with the most famous warriors 

Of all the Apian land to join with them 1240 

In leading a seven-fold army against Thebes, 

And either dying in a righteous cause, 

Or driving out that scoundrel from the country.

As your brother is today, you were the one 

122 



OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 

Who forced me into exile, your own father. 

You robbed me of my country; you compelled me 1290 

To wear the tatters that you weep to see, 

Now that you live in wretchedness like mine. 

I have long since ceased to weep. I bear this burden 

As long as my life lasts, and never, never 

Do I forget that you are a murderer. 

For it is you who have dragged me down to this: 

You who have thrust me from my home; you, you 

Who are responsible for my wandering, 

My begging strangers for my daily bread. 

I might have died for all you did to help me, 1300 

Except for these two daughters. They have nursed me, 

Preserved me, tended me, shared in mv hardships 

Like men and not like women. As for you, 

You and your brother are no sons of mine. 

The god of vengeance sees you, but his gaze 

Will grow yet fiercer if in truth those armies 

Are marching against Thebes. For you will never 

Capture that city. Rather you will die 

Bathed in Eteocles' blood, and he in yours. 

I cursed you two. I curse you now again. 1 3 10 

For you, unlike your sisters, must be taught 

To honor parenthood, taught not to scorn 

So utterly as you have your sightless father. 

Scorn from such sons! My curses have control 

Over your suppliance and your talk of thrones, 

If truly ancient Justice sits with Zeus 

Under the sanction of the eternal laws. 

No man on earth could be as vile as you! 

I cast you off with loathing, I disown you. 

Go! With this final curse called down upon you. 1320 

I pray the gods that you may never conquer 

Your people or their city, never return 

Alive to the vale of Argos. May you kill 

The brother who has driven you from your country, 

And die vourself, struck down by your brother's hand. 

I call on Darkness, the primeval father, 

To bring you to the hateful gloom of Hades. 

I call on the dread goddesses of this place. 

I call on Ares the destrover, he 

Who put this bitter hatred in your hearts. 1330 

Now go, since I have spoken to vou. Go 

Publish these words of mine to all the Thebans, 

And tell your trusty allies these are the honors 

That Oedipus has bestowed upon his sons.

Let me not be dishonored, bury me, 

Give me the funeral rites that I should have. 

You have been praised already for what you did 

To help your father, and what you do for me 

Will win you added praise no less deserved. 1350 

ANTIGONE: 

Brother, I ask only one thing of you. 

POLYNEICES: 

Dearest Antigone, what is it? Tell me.

Turn back your army to Argos. Now. At once. 
Do not destroy yourself and ruin Thebes. 

POLYNEICES: 

Impossible. How could I ever again 

Command that army once I had proved a coward? 

ANTIGONE: 

But why should you grow angry ever again? 
What would you gain by laying waste your city? 

POLYNEICES: 

My life is shameful. I am an exile, mocked 

By my younger brother— I, the eldest born. 1360 

ANTIGONE: 

Do you see you are making your father's words come true? 
He has foretold that you will kill each other. 

POLYNEICES: 

Because he wishes it. I cannot yield. 

ANTIGONE: 

Brother! Brother! But who will dare to follow 
When he has heard what has been prophesied? 

POLYNEICES: 

I will tell no one. A good leader's duty 

Is to reveal what helps and not what hinders. 

ANTIGONE: 

Are you determined to do this, Polyneices? 
124 



OEDIPUS AT COLONUS 
POLYNEICES: 

Yes. Do not hold me back. My time has come 

To take that dark, ill-fated journey, cursed 1370 

By my father and his Furies. As for you two, 

May Zeus be gracious to you, if you give me 

My rightful honors after I am dead, 

Since while I live you can do nothing more. 

Now, Sister, let me go. Bid me good-bye. 

You will not see me alive again, an.: No! No! 

POLYNEICES: 

Do not shed tears for me. an.: Who would not weep 
To see you hurrying open-eyed to death? 

POLYNEICES: 

If I must die, I must, an.: Oh Brother, listen! 

POLYNEICES: 

Only to what is right, an.: I cannot bear 1380 

The thought of losing you. poly.: Fate will decide 
One way or the other. But I pray the gods 
You two at least may meet with no misfortune. 
No one believes that you deserve to suffer. 

Exit POLYNEICES 



chorus: 

Even now we have heard the sightless stranger 
Call down new curses heavy with pain. 

Or it may be that fate on its course is keeping, 
For the gods' decrees are not uttered in vain. 

They are watched forever by time unsleeping- 
Time, breaking today some fortunes asunder, 1390 

And raising others tomorrow on high.

It splits the sky!

Is there a messenger? The King should be here.

Enter theseus 

THESEUS: 

I have heard your summons, Oedipus, and yours, 

Men of Colonus. Why are you so anxious? 

Is it the thunder or a burst of hail? 

For all of us have reason to be fearful 

When heaven sends down a storm like this upon us. 

OEDIPUS: 

Welcome, King Theseus! I have been longing for you. 
The gods will bless you for your coming here. 1440 

theseus: 

What is it, son of Laius? What has happened? 

OEDIPUS: 

I have reached life's utmost verge. Before I die 
I wish to keep the promise that I made you. 
theseus: 

How can you be so certain of your fate? 

OEDIPUS: 

The gods themselves have heralded their tidings. 
They have fulfilled what they long since foretold. 
theseus: 

What are the signs that have made their purpose clear? 

OEDIPUS: 

Long peals of thunder; flash after flash of lightning, 
Hurled by the hand of strength invincible. 
theseus: 

I cannot doubt you. I have already heard you 1450 

Prophesy truly. Tell me what I must do. 

OEDIPUS: 

Your city, son of Aegeus, will store up 

What I am now to show you as a treasure 

Beyond the reach of time. I need no guide, 

For I, unaided, will lead you to the place 

Where I must die. Never to mortal man 

Make known its secret, so that forevermore 

It may safeguard you better than a wall 

Of native shields, better than alien spears 

Of neighboring allies. There, a mystery, 1460 

Too sacred to be given utterance, 

Will be unfolded only to you King Theseus. 

I cannot tell your people or my children, 

Dear though they are to me. No, you alone 

Must guard this revelation till your life 

Draws to a close, and then to your successor, 

To him, alone, disclose it. Let him likewise 

Instruct his heir, and so through future ages.

Where destiny has decreed that I be buried. 

Come here! Come here! Hermes and the great goddess 

Ruling in Hades lead me on. O light,

For the last time my living body feels you, 

As the dark underworld envelops me.

Not sorrowful, not suffering from his doom, 

Down to the dead below, 
Down to the Stvgian fields' enshrouding gloom. 

From his unmerited misery 1500 

May the gods now in justice set him free. 

Avenging Furies in your dark domain, 

Have pity on his pain! 
Unconquered Cerberus, who dost lie in wait 
Guarding that wide and ever-welcoming gate, 

Snarling within thy lair, 
Thou mighty monster, be thou good to us! 

O Death, hear thou our praver, 
Thou terrible son of Earth and Tartarus! 

Make clear his pathway to the deep 15 10 

O thou, the giver of eternal sleep.

OEDIPUS AT COLON US 

Enter MESSENGER 

messsenger: 

My friends, this is the substance of my message: 
Oedipus is no more. But the whole story 
Of all that has taken place cannot be brief. 

chorus: 

He is no longer suffering? He is dead? 

messsenger: 

You may be certain his last day has come. 

chorus: 

What did the gods decree? A painless doom? 

messsenger: 

Wonderful things have happened. You all know, 

Since you were here yourselves, how Oedipus left you 

With no one guiding him, for he himself 1520 

Showed us the way. Now when he reached the chasm 

Where the bronze steps lead down precipitously, 

He paused by one of many branching paths 

By the rock-basin, the memorial 

Of the unbroken pact Peirithous 

Made with King Theseus. There he stood midway 

Between this basin, the Thorician stone, 

The hollow pear-tree, and the marble tomb. 

Then he sat down, loosened his sordid garments, 

And summoning his daughters, bade them bring him 1530 

Water from some pure spring, that he might wash 

And pour out a drink-offering to the dead. 

So from Demeter's hillside, close at hand, 

Quickly they brought all that their father asked for, 

Washed him, and clothed him as is customary, 

Neglecting nothing that could satisfy him. 

Then the god thundered, Zeus of the world of darkness. 

The two girls, shuddering, fell at their father's knees, 

Burst into tears, and beat their breasts, lamenting 

Loudly and long. At their sharp, sudden cry 1540 

He folded them in his arms. 'Children,' he said, 

'You have no father now. My life is over, 

And your sad task of tending me is done, 

A heavy burden, I know, for you to bear. 

Yet there is one word— love— that makes the hardships 

That you have suffered seem of no importance. 

No one has given you love as great as mine. 

Now you must live without me through the years 

That are before you.' So in the utmost grief 

They all embraced. At last their tears ceased flowing, 1550 

Their loud sobs died away, and there was silence. 

129 



SOPHOCLES 

1 hen suddenl) a terrifying voice, 
\ god s voice echoing and re-echoing, 
Standing their hair on end, rang out in summons: 
'Oedipus, Oedipus, why do we delay? 
AJread) you have lingered here too long.' 
Knowing .1 god had called him, Oedipus 
Asked I heseus to draw near, and .it his coining 
S.iid to him, 'Dearest friend, here arc- my daughters. 
Givel hem your hand— and children, give him yours— 1560 

Promise me always to be kind to them, 
Always to do vi hat you think best for them.' 
Checking his grief, high-minded as he is, 
King Theseus made this promise. Thereupon, 
Oedipus, groping blindly for his daughters, 
Said to them, 'Children, courage! You must go. 
Do not ask to see or hear forbidden things. 
Leave this place quickly, but let the King remain, 
Whose right it is to witness what will happen.' 
1 baring him speak these words, we turned away 1570 

With the two women, weeping bitterly. 
And then, a little later, we looked back. 
There was no sign of Oedipus to be seen, 
And Theseus stood with his hand before his face, 
Shielding his eyes, like one who beheld some sight 
So awful as to be unendurable. 
Then he began to pray, bowing in worship 
Of earth and of the heavens. In what manner 
Oedipus met his doom no mortal knows 

Other than Theseus. In that final moment, 1580 

No flash of lightning made an end of him, 
Nor sudden tempest springing from the sea. 
Either some messenger of the gods arrived, 
Or the foundations of the earth split open 
To take him without pain, indulgently. 
His going was not marked by lamentation, 
Sickness, or suffering. No one has ever met 
An end so marvelous. If anyone here 
Feels that such things are unbelievable, 

I will not try to persuade him of their truth. 1590 

chorus: 

Where are the women now? Where are their friends? 

MESSSENGER: 

They are not far away. The sounds of mourning, 
Broken and indistinct, tell they are coming.

Gone! Gone! He is gone! Most miserable are we, 

Wailing with grief's full flood 
The fatal heritage of our father's blood. 

For his sake, in the past, 
Of his unending pain we endured our share. 

And now, now at the last, 
Beyond belief is the sight we have had to see, 1600 

Beyond belief the loss we have had to bear. 
What loss, my child? an.: That we can never know. 

Then he is gone? an.: As you would want him to go. 
For not in battle, not in the salt sea wave, 

Did he cease to be; 
But strangely and swiftly he was snatched away 

To those dim fields far from the light of day. 
We are in darkness, the darkness of the grave! 

How shall we live, in our extremity 
Evermore wandering over land and sea? 16 10 

I do not know. Would that my life might end, 
End in the depths of Hades, with my father! 

The life that lies ahead cannot be borne. 
Kindest and best of daughters, you have been blameless. 

Do not too long, too passionately mourn. 
Men must accept what fate the gods may send. 



antigone: Ah! Now at length I have come to find it true: 
We long to have again 
The vanished past, in spite of all its pain. 

To hold him in my embrace 1620 

Was to find happiness at the heart of woe. 

Though we see no more your face, 
Still, Father, still our love goes out to you, 

Even to the darkness of the world below. 
The world below? an.: At long last he is there. 

He has found rest? an.: Rest in the shadowed air 
That he has yearned for, in the nether deep, 

Where the dead abide. 
And I abide here in mv bitter grief! 

When from this anguish will I find relief? 1630 

O Father! Father! when will I cease to weep? 

You had your wish: in a strange land you died. 
But I was not there! Not there! Not at your side! 

What new misfortunes are before us still, 
Now we are left alone, homeless, and orphaned?
