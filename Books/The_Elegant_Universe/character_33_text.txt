y  of  these  responses.  but  the  case  for  supersymmetry  is  strengthened

immensely when we consider its role in string theory.

supersymmetry in string theory

the original string theory that emerged from veneziano's work in the late 1960s incorporated all of
the symmetries discussed at the beginning of this chapter, but it did not incorporate supersymmetry
(which  had  not  yet  been  discovered).  this  first  theory  based  on  the  string  concept  was,  more
precisely,  called  the bosonic string theory.  the  name bosonic  indicates  that  all  of  the  vibrational
patterns of the bosonic string have spins that are a whole numberâ€”there are no fermionic patterns,
that is, no patterns with spins differing from a whole number by a half unit. this led to two problems.
first,  if  string  theory  was  to  describe  all  forces  and  all  matter,  it  would  somehow  have  to
incorporate  fermionic  vibrational  patterns,  since  the  known  matter  particles  all  have  spin-1/2.
second, and far

ame chirality), whereas in the type iia theory, they spin in both
directions  (they  have  both  chiralities).  nevertheless,  each  theory  incorporates  supersymmetry.  the
two  heterotic  theories  differ  in  a  similar  but  more  dramatic  way.  each  of  their  clockwise  string
vibrations looks like those of the type ii string (when focusing on just the clockwise vibrations, the
type iia and type iib theories are the same), but their counterclockwise vibrations are those of the
original bosonic string theory. although the bosonic string has insurmountable problems when chosen
for  both  clockwise  and  counterclockwise  string  vibrations,  in  1985  david  gross,  jeffrey  harvey,
emil martinec, and ryan rhom (all then at princeton university and dubbed the "princeton string
quartet") showed that a perfectly sensible theory emerges if it is used in combination with the type ii
string.  the  really  odd  feature  of  this  union  is  that  it  has  been  known  since  the  work  of  claude
