[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
powerful nobleman in the country of illyria. [CHARACTER] is lovesick
for the beautiful lady olivia, but becomes more and more fond of
his handsome new page boy, cesario, who is actually a woman--viola.
[CHARACTER] is a vehicle through which the play explores the absurdity of
love: a supreme egotist, [CHARACTER] mopes around complaining how heartsick
he is over olivia, when it is clear that he is chiefly in love with
the idea of being in love and enjoys making a spectacle of himself.
his attraction to the ostensibly male cesario injects sexual ambiguity
into his character.
