'i see a ring,' said bernard, 'hanging above me. it quivers and hangs in a loop of light.'

'i see a slab of pale yellow,' said susan, 'spreading away until it meets a purple stripe.'

'i hear a sound,' said rhoda, 'cheep, chirp; cheep chirp; going up and down.'

'i see a globe,' said neville, 'hanging down in a drop against the enormous flanks of some hill.'

'i see a crimson tassel,' said jinny, 'twisted with gold threads.'

'i hear something stamping,' said louis. 'a great beast's foot is chained. it stamps, and stamps, and stamps.'

'look at the spider's web on the corner of the balcony,' said bernard. 'it has beads of water on it, drops of white light.'

'the leaves are gathered round the window like pointed ears,' said susan.

'and burning lights from the window-panes flash in and out on the grasses,' said louis.

'stones are cold to my feet,' said neville. 'i feel each one, round or pointed, separately.'

'the back of my hand burns,' said jinny, 'but the palm is clammy and damp with dew.'

'when the smoke rises, sleep curls off the roof like a mist,' said louis.

'the birds sang in chorus first,' said rhoda. 'now the scullery door is unbarred. off they fly. off they fly like a fling of seed. but one sings by the bedroom window alone.'

'bubbles form on the floor of the saucepan,' said jinny. 'then they rise, quicker and quicker, in a silver chain to the top.'

"is he dead?" i thought, and kissed you, with my heart jumping under my pink frock like the leaves, which go on moving, though there is nothing to move them. now i smell geraniums; i smell earth mould. i dance. i ripple. i am thrown over you like a net of light. i lie quivering flung over you.'

'people go on passing,' said louis. they pass the window of this eating-shop incessantly. motor-cars, vans, motor-omnibuses; and again motor-omnibuses, vans, motor-cars--they pass the window. in the background i perceive shops and houses; also the grey spires of a city church. in the foreground are glass shelves set with plates of buns and ham sandwiches. all is somewhat obscured by steam from a tea-urn. a meaty, va

'how strange,' said jinny, 'that people should sleep, that people should put out the lights and go upstairs. they have taken off their dresses, they have put on white nightgowns. there are no lights in any of these houses. there is a line of chimney-pots against the sky; and a street lamp or two burning, as lamps burn when nobody needs them. the only people in the streets are poor people hurrying. there is no one coming or going in this street; the day is over. a few policemen stand at the

 of the final statement and prevents it from forming. i cannot seat myself in some sordid eating-house and order the same glass day after day and imbue myself entirely in one fluid--this life. i make my phrase and run off with it to some furnished room where it will be lit by dozens of candles. i need eyes on me to draw out these frills and furbelows. to be myself (i note) i need the illumination of other people's eyes, and therefore cannot be entirely sure what is my self. the authentics, like louis, like rhoda, exist most completely in solitude. they resent illumination, reduplication. they toss their pictures once painted face downward on the field. on louis' words the ice is packed thick. his words issue pressed, condensed, enduring.

'i wish, then, after this somnolence to sparkle, many-faceted under the light of my friends' faces. i have been traversing the sunless territory of non-identity. a strange land. i have heard in my moment of appeasement, in my moment of obliterating satisfa

'the door opens, but he does not come. that is louis hesitating there. that is his strange mixture of assurance and timidity. he looks at himself in the looking-glass as he comes in; he touches his hair; he is dissatisfied with his appearance. he says, "i am a duke--the last of an ancient race." he is acrid, suspicious, domineering, difficult (i am comparing him with percival). at the same time he is formidable, for there is laughter in his eyes. he has seen me. here he is.'

'there is jinny,' said susan. 'she stands in the door. everything seems stayed. the waiter stops. the diners at the table by the door look. she seems to centre everything; round her tables, lines of doors, windows, ceilings, ray themselves, like rays round the star in the middle of a smashed window-pane. she brings things to a point, to order. now she sees us, and moves, and all the rays ripple and flow and waver over us, bringing in new tides of sensation. we change. louis puts his hand to his tie. neville, who sits waiting with agonized intensity, nervously straightens the forks in front of him. rhoda sees her with surprise, as if on some far horizon a fire blazed. and i, though i pile my mind with damp grass, with wet fields, with the sound of rain on the roof and the gusts of wind that batter at the house in winter and so protect my soul against her, feel her derision steal round me, feel her laughter curl its tongues of fire round me and light up unsparingly

'now let us issue from the darkness of solitude,' said louis.

'now let us say, brutally and directly, what is in our minds,' said neville. 'our isolation, our preparation, is over. the furtive days of secrecy and hiding, the revelations on staircases, moments of terror and ecstasy.'

'old mrs constable lifted her sponge and warmth poured over us,' said bernard. 'we became clothed in this changing, this feeling garment of flesh.'

'from these close-furled balls of string we draw now every filament,' said louis, 'remembering, when we meet.'

'bells rang punctually,' said susan, 'maids scuffled and giggled. there was a drawing in of chairs and a drawing out of chairs on the linoleum. but from one attic there was a blue view, a distant view of a field unstained by the corruption of this regimented, unreal existence.'

'down from our heads veils fell,' said rhoda. 'we clasped the flowers with their green leaves rustling in garlands.'

'we changed, we became unrecognizable,' said louis. 'exposed to all these different lights, what we had in us (for we are all so different) came intermittently, in violent patches, spaced by blank voids, to the surface as if some acid had dropped unequally on the plate. i was this, neville that, rhoda different again, and bernard too.'

'then canoes slipped through palely tinted yellow branches,' said neville, 'and bernard, advancing in his casual way against breadths of green, against houses of very ancient foundation, tumbled in a heap on the

'i, however,' said louis, 'losing sight of you, sat in my office and tore the date from the calendar, and announced to the world of ship-brokers, corn-chandlers and actuaries that friday the tenth, or tuesday the eighteenth, had dawned on the city of london.'

'then,' said jinny, 'rhoda and i, exposed in bright dresses, with a few precious stones nestling on a cold ring round our throats, bowed, shook hands and took a sandwich from a plate with a smile.'

'but here and now we are together,' said bernard. 'we have come together, at a particular time, to this particular spot. we are drawn into this communion by some deep, some common emotion. shall we call it, conveniently, "love"? shall we say "love of percival" because percival is going to india?

'no, that is too small, too particular a name. we cannot attach the width and spread of our feelings to so small a mark. we have come together (from the north, from the south, from susan's farm, from louis' house of business) to make one thing, not enduring--for what endures?--but seen by many eyes simultaneously. there is a red carnation in that vase. a single flower as we sat here waiting, but now a seven-sided flower, many-petalled, red, puce, purple-shaded, stiff with silver-tinted leaves--a whole flower to which every eye brings its own contribution.

'yes,' said jinny, 'our senses have widened. membranes, webs of nerve that lay white and limp, have filled and spread themselves and float round us like filaments, making the air tangible and catching in them far-away sounds unheard before.'

'the roar of london,' said louis, 'is round us. motor-cars, vans, omnibuses pass and repass continuously. all are merged in one turning wheel of single sound. all separate sounds--wheels, bells, the cries of drunkards, of merrymakers--are churned into one sound, steel blue, circular. then a siren hoots. at that shores slip away, chimneys flatten themselves, the ship makes for the open sea.'

'it is percival,' said louis, 'sitting silent as he sat among the tickling grasses when the breeze parted the clouds and they formed again, who makes us aware that these attempts to say, "i am this, i am that," which we make, coming together, like separated parts of one body and soul, are false. something has been left out from fear. something has been altered, from vanity. we have tried to accentuate differences. from the desire to be separate we have laid stress upon our faults, and what is particular to us. but there is

'it is love,' said jinny, 'it is hate, such as susan feels for me because i kissed louis once in the garden; because equipped as i am, i make her think when i come in, "my hands are red," and hide them. but our hatred is almost indistinguishable from our love.'

'yet these roaring waters,' said neville, 'upon which we build our crazy platforms are more stable than the wild, the weak and inconsequent cries that we utter when, trying to speak, we rise; when we reason and jerk out these false sayings, "i am this; i am that!" speech is false.

'yes, between your shoulders, over your heads, to a landscape,' said rhoda, 'to a hollow where the many-backed steep hills come down like birds' wings folded. there, on the short, firm turf, are bushes, dark leaved, and against their darkness i see a shape, white, but not of stone, moving, perhaps alive. but it is not you, it is not you, it is not you; not percival, susan, jinny, neville or louis. when the white arm rests upon the knee it is a triangle; now it is upright--a column; now a fountain, falling. it makes no sign, it does not beckon, it does not see us. behind it roars the sea. it is beyond our reach. yet there i venture. there i go to replenish my emptiness, to stretch my nights and fill them fuller and fuller with dreams. and for a second even now, even here, i reach my object and say, "wander no more. all else is trial and make-believe. here is the end." but these pilgrimag

'ripping gold, i say to him, "come",' said jinny. 'and he comes; he crosses the room to where i sit, with my dress like a veil billowing round me on the gilt chair. our hands touch, our bodies burst into fire. the chair, the cup, the table--nothing remains unlit. all quivers, all kindles, all burns clear.'

('look, rhoda,' said louis, 'they have become nocturnal, rapt. their eyes are like moths' wings moving so quickly that they do not seem to move at all.'

'horns and trumpets,' said rhoda, 'ring out. leaves unfold; the stags blare in the thicket. there is a dancing and a drumming, like the dancing and the drumming of naked men with assegais.'

'like the dance of savages,' said louis, 'round the camp-fire. they are savage; they are ruthless. they dance in a circle, flapping bladders. the flames leap over their painted face

'the flames of the festival rise high,' said rhoda. 'the great procession passes, flinging green boughs and flowering branches. their horns spill blue smoke; their skins are dappled red and yellow in the torchlight. they throw violets. they deck the beloved with garlands and with laurel leaves, there on the ring of turf where the steep-backed hills come down. the procession passes. and while it passes, louis, we are aware of downfalling, we forebode decay. the shadow slants. we who are conspirators, withdrawn together to lean over some cold urn, note how the purple flame flows downwards.'

'death is woven in with the violets,' said louis. 'death and again death.')

'for one moment only,' said louis. 'before the chain breaks, before disorder returns, see us fixed, see us displayed, see us held in a vice.

'but now the circle breaks. now the current flows. now we rush faster than before. now passions that lay in wait down there in the dark weeds which grow at the bottom rise and pound us with their waves. pain and jealousy, envy and desire, and something deeper than they are, stronger than love and more subterranean. the voice of action speaks. listen, rhoda (for we are conspirators, with o

'now once more,' said louis, 'as we are about to part, having paid our bill, the circle in our blood, broken so often, so sharply, for we are so different, closes in a ring. something is made. yes, as we rise and fidget, a little nervously, we pray, holding in our hands this common feeling, "do not move, do not let the swing door cut to pieces the thing that we have made, that globes itself here, among these lights, these peelings, this litter of bread crumbs and people passing. do not move, do not go. hold it for ever."'

t? now, hampton court--hampton court--the words beat a gong in the space which i have so laboriously cleared with half a dozen telephone messages and post cards, give off ring after ring of sound, booming, sonorous: and pictures rise--summer afternoons, boats, old ladies holding their skirts up, one urn in winter, some daffodils in march--these all float to the top of the waters that now lie deep on every scene.

there at the door by the inn, our meeting-place, they are already standing--susan, louis, rhoda, jinny and neville. they have come together already. in a moment, when i have joined them, another arrangement will form, another pattern. what now runs to waste, forming scenes profusely, will be checked, stated. i am reluctant to suffer that compulsion. already at fifty yards distance i feel the order of my being changed. the tug of the magnet of their society tells upon me. i come nearer. they do not see me. now rhoda sees me, but she pretends, with her horror of the shock of meeting,

'now sitting side by side,' said neville, 'at this narrow table, now before the first emotion is worn smooth, what do we feel? honestly now, openly and directly as befits old friends meeting with difficulty, what do we feel on meeting? sorrow. the door will not open; he will not come. and we are laden. being now all of us middle-aged, loads are on us. let us put down our loads. what have you made of life, we ask, and i? you, bernard; you, susan; you, jinny; and rhoda and louis? the lists have been posted on the doors. before we break these rolls, and help ourselves to fish and salad, i feel in my private pocket and find my credentials--what i carry to prove my superiority. i have passed. i have papers in my private pocket that prove it. but your eyes, susan, full of turnips and cornfields, disturb me. these papers in my private pocket--the clamour that proves that i have passed--make a faint sound like that of a man clapping in an empty field to scare away rooks. now

'it breaks,' said louis, 'the thread i try to spin; your laughter breaks it, your indifference, also your beauty. jinny broke the thread when she kissed me in the garden years ago. the boasting boys mocked me at school for my australian accent and broke it. "this is the meaning," i say; and then start with a pang--vanity. "listen," i say, "to the nightingale, who

'in this silence,' said susan, 'it seems as if no leaf would ever fall, or bird fly.'

'as if the miracle had happened,' said jinny, 'and life were stayed here and now.'

'and,' said rhoda, 'we had no more to live.'

'but listen,' said louis, 'to the world moving through abysses of infinite space. it roars; the lighted strip of history is past and our kings and queens; we are gone; our civilization; the nile; and all life. our separate drops are dissolved; we are extinct, lost in the abysses of time, in the darkness.'

('yet, louis,' said rhoda, 'how short a time silence lasts. already they are beginning to smooth their napkins by the side of their plates. "who comes?" says jinny; and neville sighs, remembering that percival comes no more. jinny has taken out her looking-glass. surveying her face like an artist, she draws a powder-puff down her nose, and after one moment of deliberation has given precisely that red to the lips that the lips need. susan, who feels scorn and fear at the sight of these preparations, fastens

'they are saying to themselves,' said louis, '"it is time. i am still vigorous," they are saying. "my face shall be cut against the black of infinite space." they do not finish their sentences. "it is time," they keep saying. "the gardens will be shut." and going with them, rhoda, swept into their current, we shall perhaps drop a little behind.'

'like conspirators who have something to whisper,' said rhoda.)

'while we advance down this avenue,' said louis, 'i leaning slightly upon jinny, bernard arm-in-arm with neville, and susan with her hand in mine, it is difficult not to weep, calling ourselves little children, praying that god may keep us safe while we sleep. it is sweet to sing together, clasping hands, afraid of the dark, while miss curry plays the harmonium.'

'a mysterious illumination,' said louis, 'visible against those yew trees.'

'built up with much pain, many strokes,' said jinny.

'a bird flies homeward,' said louis. 'evening opens her eyes and gives one quick glance among the bushes before she sleeps. how shall we put it together, the confused and composite message that they send back to us, and not they only, but many dead, boys and girls, grown men and women, who have wandered here, under one king or another?'

'something flickers and dances,' said louis.

"hullo," one says, "there's jinny. that's neville. that's louis in grey flannel with a snake belt. that's rhoda." she had a basin in which she sailed petals of white flowers. it was susan who cried, that day when i was in the tool-house with neville; and i felt my indifference melt. neville did not melt.

'yet i was preserved from these excesses and have survived many of my friends, am a little stout, grey, rubbed on the thorax as it were, because it is the panorama of life, seen not from the roof, but from the third-storey window, that delights me, not what one woman says to one man, even if that man is myself.

how could i be bullied at school therefore? how could they make things hot for me? there was the doctor lurching into chapel, as if he trod a battleship in a gale of wind, shouting out his commands through a megaphone, since people in authority always become melodramatic--i did not hate him like neville, or revere him like louis. i took notes as we sat together in chapel. there were pillars, shadows, memorial brasses, boys scuffling and swopping stamps behind prayer books; the sound of a rusty pump; the doctor booming, about immortality and quitting ourselves like men; and percival scratching his thigh. i made notes for stories; drew portraits in the margin of my pocket-book and thus became still more separate. here are one or two of the figures i saw.

leaden waste of waters. nothing would happen to lift that weight of intolerable boredom. the terms went on. we grew; we changed; for, of course, we are animals. we are not always aware by any means; we breathe, eat, sleep automatically. we exist not only separately but in undifferentiated blobs of matter. with one scoop a whole brakeful of boys is swept up and goes cricketing, footballing. an army marches across europe. we assemble in parks and halls and sedulously oppose any renegade (neville, louis, rhoda) who sets up a separate existence. and i am so made that, while i hear one or two distinct melodies, such as louis sings, or neville, i am also drawn irresistibly to the sound of the chorus chanting its old, chanting its almost wordless, almost senseless song that comes across courts at night; which we hear now booming round us as cars and omnibuses take people to theatres.

'was this, then, this streaming away mixed with susan, jinny, neville, rhoda, louis, a sort of death? a new assembly of elements? some hint of what was to come? the note was scribbled, the book shut, for i am an intermittent student. i do not say my lessons by any means at the stated hour. later, walking down fleet street at the rush hour, i recalled that moment; i continued it.
