 aimed at atticus. but this was the first one coming from an adult.
except for her remarks about atticus, mrs. duboseâ€™s attack was only routine.
there was a hint of summer in the airâ€”in the shadows it was cool, but the sun
was warm, which meant good times coming: no school and dill.
jem bought his steam engine and we went by elmoreâ€™s for my baton. jem took no
pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside
me toward home. on the way home i nearly hit mr. link deas, who said, â€œlook
out now, scout!â€ when i missed a toss, and when we approached mrs. duboseâ€™s

house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.
she was not on the porch.
in later years, i sometimes wondered exactly what made jem do it, what made
him break the bonds of â€œyou just be a gentleman, son,â€ and the phase of self-
conscious rectitude he had recently entered. jem had probably stood as much guff
about atticus lawing for niggers as had i, and i too

â€œdonâ€™t be foolish, heck,â€ atticus said. â€œthis is maycomb.â€
â€œâ€¦said i was just uneasy.â€
â€œheck, weâ€™ve gotten one postponement of this case just to make sure thereâ€™s
nothing to be uneasy about. this is saturday,â€ atticus said. â€œtrialâ€™ll probably be
monday. you can keep him one night, canâ€™t you? i donâ€™t think anybody in
maycombâ€™ll begrudge me a client, with times this hard.â€
there was a murmur of glee that died suddenly when mr. link deas said,
â€œnobody around hereâ€™s up to anything, itâ€™s that old sarum bunch iâ€™m worried
aboutâ€¦ canâ€™t you get aâ€”what is it, heck?â€
â€œchange of venue,â€ said mr. tate. â€œnot much point in that, now is it?â€
atticus said something inaudible. i turned to jem, who waved me to silence.
â€œâ€”besides,â€ atticus was saying, â€œyouâ€™re not scared of that crowd, are you?â€
â€œâ€¦know how they do when they get shinnied up.â€
â€œthey donâ€™t usually drink on sunday, they go to church most

atticus said.
â€œthis is a special occasion, thoughâ€¦â€ someone said.
they murmured and buzzed until aunty said if jem didnâ€™t turn on the livingroom
lights he would disgrace the family. jem didnâ€™t hear her.
â€œâ€”donâ€™t see why you touched it in the first place,â€ mr. link deas was saying.
â€œyouâ€™ve got everything to lose from this, atticus. i mean everything.â€
â€œdo you really think so?â€
this was atticusâ€™s dangerous question. â€œdo you really think you want to move
there, scout?â€ bam, bam, bam, and the checkerboard was swept clean of my men.
â€œdo you really think that, son? then read this.â€ jem would struggle the rest of an
evening through the speeches of henry w. grady.
â€œlink, that boy might go to the chair, but heâ€™s not going till the truthâ€™s tol

â€œyes,â€ said atticus. â€œyou were both convicted?â€
â€œyes suh, i had to serve â€˜cause i couldnâ€™t pay the fine. other fellow paid hisâ€™n.â€
dill leaned across me and asked jem what atticus was doing. jem said atticus
was showing the jury that tom had nothing to hide.
â€œwere you acquainted with mayella violet ewell?â€ asked atticus.

â€œyes suh, i had to pass her place goinâ€˜ to and from the field every day.â€
â€œwhose field?â€
â€œi picks for mr. link deas.â€
â€œwere you picking cotton in november?â€
â€œno suh, i works in his yard fall anâ€˜ wintertime. i works pretty steady for him all
year round, heâ€™s got a lot of pecan treesâ€™n things.â€
â€œyou say you had to pass the ewell place to get to and from work. is there any
other way to go?â€
â€œno suh, noneâ€™s i know of.â€
â€œtom, did she ever speak to you?â€
â€œwhy, yes suh, iâ€™d tip mâ€™hat when iâ€™d go by, and one day she asked me to come
inside the fence and bust up a chiffarobe for

ighta said somethinâ€˜, but i werenâ€™t thereâ€”â€
â€œthatâ€™ll do,â€ atticus cut in sharply. â€œwhat you did hear, who was he talking to?â€
â€œmr. finch, he were talkinâ€˜ and lookinâ€™ at miss mayella.â€
â€œthen you ran?â€
â€œi shoâ€˜ did, suh.â€
â€œwhy did you run?â€

â€œi was scared, suh.â€
â€œwhy were you scared?â€
â€œmr. finch, if you was a nigger like me, youâ€™d be scared, too.â€
atticus sat down. mr. gilmer was making his way to the witness stand, but before
he got there mr. link deas rose from the audience and announced:
â€œi just want the whole lot of you to know one thing right now. that boyâ€™s worked
for me eight years anâ€˜ i ainâ€™t had a speck oâ€™trouble outa him. not a speck.â€
â€œshut your mouth, sir!â€ judge taylor was wide awake and roaring. he was also
pink in the face. his speech was miraculously unimpaired by his cigar. â€œlink

and at the proper time, but until then you ge

ut them. i looked at jem, but jem shook his
head. â€œit ainâ€™t like one of the jurymen got up and started talking,â€ he said. â€œi think
itâ€™d be different then. mr. link was just disturbinâ€˜ the peace or something.â€
judge taylor told the reporter to expunge anything he happened to have written
down after mr. finch if you were a nigger like me youâ€™d be scared too, and told
the jury to disregard the interruption. he looked suspiciously down the middle
aisle and waited, i suppose, for mr. link deas to effect total departure. then he
said, â€œgo ahead, mr. gilmer.â€
â€œyou were given thirty days once for disorderly conduct, robinson?â€ asked mr.
gilmer.
â€œyes suh.â€
â€œwhatâ€™d the nigger look like when you got through with him?â€
â€œhe beat me, mr. gilmer.â€
â€œyes, but you were convicted, werenâ€™t you?â€
atticus raised his head. â€œit was a misdemeanor and itâ€™s in the record, judge.â€ i
thought he sounded tired.

â€œwitnessâ€™ll answer, though,â€ said judge taylor, just as w

d started crying and couldnâ€™t stop;
quietly at first, then his sobs were heard by several people in the balcony. jem
said if i didnâ€™t go with him heâ€™d make me, and reverend sykes said iâ€™d better go,
so i went. dill had seemed to be all right that day, nothing wrong with him, but i
guessed he hadnâ€™t fully recovered from running away.
â€œainâ€™t you feeling good?â€ i asked, when we reached the bottom of the stairs.
dill tried to pull himself together as we ran down the south steps. mr. link deas
was a lonely figure on the top step. â€œanything happeninâ€˜, scout?â€ he asked as we
went by. â€œno sir,â€ i answered over my shoulder. â€œdill here, heâ€™s sick.â€
â€œcome on out under the trees,â€ i said. â€œheat got you, i expect.â€ we chose the
fattest live oak and we sat under it.
â€œit was just him i couldnâ€™t stand,â€ dill said.
â€œwho, tom?â€
â€œthat old mr. gilmer doinâ€˜ him thataway, talking so hateful to himâ€”â€
â€œdill, thatâ€™s his job. why, if we didnâ€™t have prosecut

s maudie on a jury would be impressive. i thought of old
mrs. dubose in her wheelchairâ€”â€œstop that rapping, john taylor, i want to ask
this man something.â€ perhaps our forefathers were wise.
atticus was saying, â€œwith people like usâ€”thatâ€™s our share of the bill. we
generally get the juries we deserve. our stout maycomb citizens arenâ€™t interested,
in the first place. in the second place, theyâ€™re afraid. then, theyâ€™reâ€”â€
â€œafraid, why?â€ asked jem.
â€œwell, what ifâ€”say, mr. link deas had to decide the amount of damages to
award, say, miss maudie, when miss rachel ran over her with a car. link
wouldnâ€™t like the thought of losing either ladyâ€™s business at his store, would he?
so he tells judge taylor that he canâ€™t serve on the jury because he doesnâ€™t have
anybody to keep store for him while heâ€™s gone. so judge taylor excuses him.
sometimes he excuses him wrathfully.â€
â€œwhatâ€™d make him think either one of â€˜emâ€™d stop trading with him?â€ i asked.
jem said, â€

 to the back porch to let ann out and found the screen door
swinging open. a shadow on the corner of the house caught his eye, and that was
all he saw of his visitor. mrs. taylor came home from church to find her husband
in his chair, lost in the writings of bob taylor, with a shotgun across his lap.
the third thing happened to helen robinson, tomâ€™s widow. if mr. ewell was as
forgotten as tom robinson, tom robinson was as forgotten as boo radley. but
tom was not forgotten by his employer, mr. link deas. mr. link deas made a
job for helen. he didnâ€™t really need her, but he said he felt right bad about the
way things turned out. i never knew who took care of her children while helen
was away. calpurnia said it was hard on helen, because she had to walk nearly a
mile out of her way to avoid the ewells, who, according to helen, â€œchunked at
herâ€ the first time she tried to use the public road. mr. link deas eventually
received the impression that helen was coming to work each morning from th

ewell: if i hear one more peep outa my girl helen about not beinâ€™ able to walk
this road iâ€™ll have you in jail before sundown!â€ mr. link spat in the dust and
walked home.
helen went to work next morning and used the public road. nobody chunked at
her, but when she was a few yards beyond the ewell house, she looked around
and saw mr. ewell walking behind her. she turned and walked on, and mr. ewell
kept the same distance behind her until she reached mr. link deasâ€™s house. all
the way to the house, helen said, she heard a soft voice behind her, crooning foul
words. thoroughly frightened, she telephoned mr. link at his store, which was
not too far from his house. as mr. link came out of his store he saw mr. ewell
leaning on the fence. mr. ewell said, â€œdonâ€™t you look at me, link deas, like i
was dirt. i ainâ€™t jumped yourâ€”â€
â€œfirst thing you can do, ewell, is get your stinkinâ€˜ carcass off my property.
youâ€™re leaninâ€™ on it anâ€˜ i canâ€™t

afford fresh paint for it. second thing you can do
is stay away from my cook or iâ€™ll have you up for assaultâ€”â€
â€œi ainâ€™t touched her, link deas, and ainâ€™t about to go with no nigger!â€
â€œyou donâ€™t have to touch her, all you have to do is make her afraid, anâ€˜ if assault
ainâ€™t enough to keep you locked up awhile, iâ€™ll get you in on the ladiesâ€™ law, so
get outa my sight! if you donâ€™t think i mean it, just bother that girl again!â€
mr. ewell evidently thought he meant it, for helen reported no further trouble.
â€œi donâ€™t like it, atticus, i donâ€™t like it at all,â€ was aunt alexandraâ€™s assessment of
these events. â€œ
