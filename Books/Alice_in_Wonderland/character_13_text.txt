iers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among
them alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the king’s
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came the king and queen of hearts.

alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; ‘and besides, what would be the use of
a procession,’ thought she, ‘if people had all to lie down upon their

obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

‘consider your verdict,’ the king said to the jury.

‘not yet, not yet!’ the rabbit hastily interrupted. ‘there’s a great

‘call the first witness,’ said the king; and the white rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, ‘first witness!’

the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘i beg pardon, your
