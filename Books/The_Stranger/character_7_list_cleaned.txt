the [CHARACTER] - 
                 a
worker at the old persons' home where meursault's mother spent the
three years prior to her death. during the vigil meursault holds
before his mother's funeral, the [CHARACTER] chats with meursault
in the mortuary. they drink coffee and smoke cigarettes next to
the coffin, gestures that later weigh heavily against meursault
as evidence of his monstrous indifference to his mother's death.
it is peculiar that the court does not consider the [CHARACTER]'s
smoking and coffee drinking in the presence of the coffin to be similarly
monstrous acts.
