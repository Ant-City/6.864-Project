h; no more;
't is not so sweet now as it was before.
o spirit of love, how quick and fresh art thou!
that, notwithstanding thy capacity
receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
of what validity and pitch soe'er,
but falls into abatement and low price,
even in a minute! so full of shapes is fancy
that it alone is high fantastical.

duke.
why, so i do, the noblest that i have.
o, when mine eyes did see olivia first,
methought she purg'd the air of pestilence!
that instant was i turn'd into a hart;
and my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
e'er since pursue me.

[enter valentine.]

how now! what news from her?

valentine.
so please my lord, i might not be admitted,
but from her handmaid do return this answer:
the element itself, till seven years' heat,
shall not behold her face at ample view;
but, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
and water once a day her chamber round

viola.
who governs here?

captain.
a noble duke, in nature as in name.

viola.
what is his name?

captain.
orsino.

viola.
orsino! i have heard my father name him;
he was a bachelor then.

captain.
and so is now, or was so very late;
for but a month ago i went from hence,
and then 'twas fresh in murmur--as, you know,
what great ones do the less will prattle of--
that he did seek the love of fair olivia.

viola.
what's she?

captain.
a virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
that died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
in the protection of his son, her brother,
who shortly also died; for whose dear love,
they say, she hath abjur'd the company
and sight of men.

viola.
o that i serv'd that lady,
and might not be delivered to the world,
till i had made mine own occasion mellow,
what my estate is!

captain.
that were hard to compass,
because she will admit no kind of sui

ise as haply shall become
the form of my intent. i'll serve this duke:
thou shalt present me as an eunuch to him;
it may be worth thy pains, for i can sing
and speak to him in many sorts of music
that will allow me very worth his service.
what else may hap, to time i will commit;
only shape thou silence to my wit.

captain.
be you his eunuch, and your mute i'll be;
when my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.

viola.
i thank thee; lead me on.

sir toby.
what a plague means my niece, to take the death of her brother
thus? i am sure care's an enemy to life.

maria.
by my troth, sir toby, you must come in earlier o' nights; your
cousin, my lady, takes great exceptions to your ill hours.

sir toby.
why, let her except before excepted.

maria.
ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest limits of
order.

sir toby.
confine! i'll confine myself no finer than i am. thes

nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or i will not open my

will hang thee for thy absence.

olivia.
take the fool away.

clown.
do you not hear, fellows? take away the lady.

olivia.
go to, you're a dry fool; i'll no more of you: besides, you grow
dishonest.

clown.
two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for,
give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry: bid the
dishonest man mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer
dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. any thing

if that this simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
what remedy? as there is no true cuckold but calamity, so
beauty's a flower. the lady bade take away the fool; therefore, i
say again, take her away.

olivia.
sir, i bade them take away you.

clown.
misprision in the highest degree! lady, cucullus non facit
monachum; that's as much to say as i wear not motley in my brain.
good madonna, give me leave to prove you a fool.

olivia.
can you do it?

clown.
dexteriously, good madonna.

olivia.
make your proof.

clown.
i must catechize you for it, madonna; good my mouse of virtue,
answer me.

well, sir, for want of other idleness, i'll bide your proof.

 why mourn'st thou?

olivia.
good fool, for my brother's death.

clown.
i think his soul is in hell, madonna.

olivia.
i know his soul is in heaven, fool.

clown.
the more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in
heaven. take away the fool, gentlemen.

olivia.
what think you of this fool, malvolio? doth he not mend?

malvolio.
yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. infirmity,
that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.

clown.
god send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing
your folly! sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox; but he will
not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.

olivia.
how say you to that, malvolio?

malvolio.
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren

rascal; i
saw him put down the other day with an ordinary fool that has no
more brain than a stone. look you now, he's out of
his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,
he is gagg'd. i protest, i take these wise men, that crow so at
these set kind of fools, no better than the fools' zanies.

olivia.
o, you are sick of self-love, malvolio, and taste with a
distemper'd appetite. to be generous, guiltless, and of free
disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem
cannon bullets. there is no slander in an allow'd fool, though he
do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man,
though he do nothing but reprove.

clown.
now mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well of
fools!

who of my people hold him in delay?

sir toby, madam, your kinsman.

fetch him off, i pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: fie on
him! [exit maria.] go you, malvolio: if it be a suit from the
count, i am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
[exit malvolio.] now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,
and people dislike it.

let him be the devil, and he will, i care not; give me faith, say
i. well, it's all one.

olivia.
what's a drunken man like, fool?

clown.
like a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat
makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns him.

olivia.
go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz; for he's
in the third degree of drink, he's drown'd: go look after him.

malvolio.
madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. i told
him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much,  and
therefore comes to speak with you. i told him you were asleep; he
seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to
speak with you. what is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified
against any denial.

olivia.
tell him he shall not speak with me.

malvolio.
has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door like a
sheriff's post, and be the supporter to a bench, but he'll speak
with you.

olivia.
what kind o' man is he?

malvolio.
why, of mankind.

olivia.
what manner of man?

malvolio.
of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

olivia.
of what personage and years is he?

malvolio.
not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a
squash is

the least sinister usage.

olivia.
whence came you, sir?

viola.
i can say little more than i have studied, and that question's
out of my part. good gentle one, give me modest assurance if you
be the lady of the house, that i may proceed in
my speech.

olivia.
are you a comedian?

viola.
no, my profound heart; and yet, by the very fangs of malice i
swear, i am not that i play. are you the lady of the house?

olivia.
if i do not usurp myself, i am.

viola.
most certain, if you are she, you do usurp yourself; for what is
yours to bestow is not yours to reserve. but this is from my
commission. i will on with my speech in your praise, and then
show you the heart of my message.

rather to wonder at you than to hear you. if you be not mad, be

taxation of homage: i hold the olive in my hand; my words are as
full of peace as matter.

olivia.
yet you began rudely. what are you? what would you?

viola.
the rudeness that hath appear'd in me have i learn'd from my
entertainment. what i am, and what i would, are as secret as
maidenhead; to your ears, divinity; to any other's, profanation.

olivia.
give us the place alone; we will hear this divinity.

viola.
good madam, let me see your face.

olivia.
have you any commission from your lord to negotiate with my face?
you are now out of your text; but we will draw the curtain, and
show you the picture. look you, sir, such a one i was this

o, sir, i will not be so hard-hearted; i will give out divers
schedules of my beauty. it shall be inventoried, and every
particle and utensil labell'd to my will: as, item, two lips,
indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to them; item,
one neck, one chin, and so forth. were you sent hither to praise
me?

but, if you were the devil, you are fair.

with groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.

olivia.
your lord does know my mind; i cannot love him:
yet i suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
in voices well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant;
and, in dimension and the shape of nature,
a gracious person: but yet i cannot love him;
he might have took his answer long ago.

viola.
if i did love you in my master's flame,
with such a suffering, such a deadly life,
in your denial i would find no sense;
i would not understand it.

fear not, cesario; take thy fortunes up;

o thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be

or will not else thy craft so quickly grow
that thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet

of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
that i am viola: which to confirm,
i 'll bring you to a captain in this town,
where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
i was preserv'd to serve this noble count.

hath been between this lady and this lord.

sebastian.
[to olivia] so comes it, lady, you have been mistook;

you would have been contracted to a maid;
nor are you therein, by my life, deceiv'd,
you are betroth'd both to a maid and man.

the captain that did bring me first on shore
hath my maid's garments; he, upon some action,
is now in durance, at malvolio's suit,
a gentleman and follower of my lady's.

e condition of this present hour,
which i have wond'red at.  in hope it shall not,
most freely i confess myself and toby
set this device against malvolio here,
upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
we had conceiv'd against him.  maria writ
the letter at sir toby's great importance;
in recompense whereof he hath married her.
how with a sportful malice it was follow'd
may rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
if that the injuries be justly weigh'd
that have on both sides pass'd.

olivia.
alas, poor fool, how have they baffl'd thee!

clown.
why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some have
greatness thrown upon them.' i was one, sir, in this interlude;
one sir topas, sir; but that 's all one. 'by the lord,
fool, i am not mad'; but do you remember? 'madam, why laugh you
at such a barren rascal? and you smile not, he 's gagg'd': and
thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.

malvolio.
i 'll be reveng'd on the whole pack of you.
