re's only twenty. here's our control room. the entire park is controlled from here."
they paused before windows and peered into a darkened room that looked like a small version
of mission control. there was a vertical glass see-through map of the park, and facing it a bank
of glowing computer consoles- some of the screens displayed data, but most of them showed
video images from around the park. there were just two people inside, standing and talking.
"the man on the left is our chief engineer, john arnold"-regis pointed to a thin man in a
button-down short-sleeve shirt and tie, smoking a cigarette-"and next to him, our park warden,
mr. robert muldoon, the famous white bunter from nairobi." muldoon was a burly man in khaki,
sunglasses dangling from his shirt pockct. he glanced out at the group, gave a brief nod, and
turned back to the computer screens. "i'm sure you want to see this room," ed regis said, "but
first, let's see how we obtain dinosaur dna."
the sign on the door said extractions and,

feeling for computers, an intuition.
grant never felt that. he found computers to be alien, mystifying machines. even the fundamental
distinction between an operating system and an application left him confused and disheartened,
literally lost in a foreign geography he didn't begin to comprehend. but he noticed that gennaro
was perfectly comfortable, and malcolm seemed to be in his element, making little sniffing
sounds, like a bloodhound on a trail.
"you want to know about control mechanisms?" john arnold said, turning in his chair in the
control room. the head engineer was a thin, tense, chain-smoking man of forty-five. he squinted
at the others in the room. "we have unbelievable control mechanisms," arnold said, and lit
another cigarette.
"for example," gennaro said.
"for example, animal tracking." arnold pressed a button on his console, and the vertical glass
map lit up with a pattern of jagged blue lines. "that's our juvenile t-rex. the little rex. all his
movements within the park over the

 at the unexpected
sound, the herd of hypsilophodonts suddenly leapt into the air and bounded above the grass like
kangaroos, showing their full bodies with massive hind limbs and long tails in the afternoon
sunlight. in a few leaps, they were gone.
"now that we've had a look at these fascinating herbivores, we will go on to some dinosaurs
that are a little larger. quite a bit larger, in fact."
the land cruisers continued onward, moving south through jurassic park.

"gears are grinding," john arnold said, in the darkened control room. "have maintenance check
the electric clutches on vehicles bb4 and bb5 when they come back."
"yes, mr. arnold," replied the voice on the intercom.
"a minor detail," hammond said, walking in the room. looking out, he could see the two land
cruisers moving south through the park. muldoon stood in the corner, silently watching.
arnold pushed his chair back from the central console at the control panel. "there are no minor
details, mr. hammond," he said, and he li

t another cigarette. nervous at most times, arnold was
especially edgy now. he was only too aware that this was the first time visitors had actually
toured the park. in fact, arnold's team didn't often go into the park. harding, the vet, sometimes
did. the animal handlers went to the individual feeding houses. but otherwise they watched the
park from the control room. and now, with visitors out there, he worried about a hundred details.
john arnold was a systems engineer who had worked on the polaris submarine missile in the
late 1960s, until he had his first child and the prospect of making weapons became too
distasteful. meanwhile, disney had started to create amusement park rides of great technological
sophistication, and they employed a lot of aerospace people. arnold helped build disney world in
orlando, and had gone on to implement major parks at magic mountain in california, old
country in virginia, and astroworld in houston.

sounded which could not be turned off.
and so it went, page after page of errors.
when he had arrived, dennis nedry had been under the impression that he could make all the
fixes himself over the weekend. he had paled when he saw the full listing. now he was calling his
office in cambridge, telling his staff programmers they were going to have to cancel their
weekend plans and work overtime until monday. and he had told john arnold that he would need
to use every telephone link between isla nublar and the mainland just to transfer program data
back and forth to his programmers. 
while nedry worked, arnold punched up a new window in his own monitor. it allowed him to
see what nedry was doing at the corner console. not that he didn't trust nedry. but arnold just
liked to know what was going on.
he looked at the graphics display on his right-hand console, which showed the progress of the
electric land cruisers. they were fol

tim picked up his goggles as grant grabbed both the children's hands and began to run.

in the night, the compys scurried along the side of the road. harding's jeep followed a short
distance behind. ellie pointed farther up the road. "is that a light?"
"could be," harding said. "looks almost like headlights."
the radio suddenly bummed and crackled. they heard john arnold say,
"-you there?"
"ah, there he is," harding said. "finally." he pressed the button. "yes, john, we're here. we're
near the river, following the compys. it's quite interesting."
more crackling. then: "-eed your car-"
"what'd he say?" gennaro said.
"something about a car," ellie said. at grant's dig in montana, ellie was the one who operated
the radiophone. after years of experience, she had become skilled at picking up garbled
transmissions. "i think he said he needs your car."

the bite pattern," muldoon said. "see those little ones there?" he pointed along the belly.
"those are from the othys. those bites haven't bled. they're postmortem, from scavengers.
othys did that. but the hadro was brought down by a bite on the neck-you see the big slash
there, above the shoulder blades-and that's the t-rex, no question."
gennaro bent over the carcass, staring at the awkward, trampled limbs with a sense of
unreality. beside him, muldoon flicked on his radio. "control. "
"yes," john arnold said, over the radio. 
"we got another hadro dead. juvenile." muldoon bent down among the flies and checked the
skin on the sole of the right foot. a number was tattooed there, "specimen is number hd/09."
the radio crackled. "i've got something for you," arnold said.
"oh? what's that?"
"i found nedry."
the jeep burst through the line of palm trees along the east road and came out into a narrower
service road, leading toward the jungle river. it was hot in this area of the park, the jungle close

"you want to stop?" tim said.
"maybe there's a phone. or motion sensors." grant steered toward the shore. "we need to try
to contact the control room. it's getting late."
they clambered out, slipping on the muddy bank, and grant hauled the raft out of the water.
then he tied the rope to a tree and they set off, through a dense forest of palm trees.

"i just don't understand," john arnold said, speaking into the phone. "i don't see the rex, and i
don't see grant and the kids anywhere, either."
he sat in front of the consoles and gulped another cup of coffee. all around him, the control
room was strewn with paper plates and half-eaten sandwiches. arnold was exhausted. it was
8:00 a.m. on saturday. in the fourteen hours since nedry destroyed the computer that ran
jurassic park, arnold had patiently pulled systems back on line, one after another. "all the park
systems are back, and

make it simple," malcolm said. "a karate master does not kill people with his bare hands.
he does not lose his temper and kill his wife. the person who kills is the person who has no
discipline, no restraint, and who has purchased his power in the form of a saturday night special.
and that is the kind of power that science fosters, and permits. and that is why you think that to
build a place like this is simple."
"it was simple," hammond insisted.
"then why did it go wrong?"
dizzy with tension, john arnold threw open the door to the maintenance shed and stepped into
the darkness inside. jesus, it was black. he should have realized the lights would be out. he felt
the cool air, the cavernous dimensions of the space, extending two floors below him. he had to
find the catwalk. he had to be careful, or he'd break his neck.
the catwalk.
he groped like a blind man until he realized it was futile. somehow he had to get light into the
shed, he went back to the door and cracked it open four inches. that g

time they would solve those
problems. that was how progress occurred. by solving problems.
as he thought about it, he concluded that wu had not really been the man for the job. wu had
obviously been sloppy, too casual with his great undertaking. and wu had been too preoccupied
with the idea of making improvements. instead of making dinosaurs, he had wanted to improve
on them. hammond suspected darkly that was the reason for the downfall of the park.
wu was the reason.
also, he had to admit that john arnold was ill suited for the job of chief engineer. arnold had
impressive credentials, but at this point in his career he was tired, and he was a fretful worrier. he
hadn't been organized, and he had missed things. important things. 
in truth, neither wu nor arnold had had the most important characteristic, hammond decided.
the characteristic of vision. that great sweeping act of imagination which evoked a marvelous
park, where children pressed against the fences, wondering at the extraordinary creat
