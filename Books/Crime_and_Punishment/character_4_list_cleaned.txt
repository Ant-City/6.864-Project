[CHARACTER] - 
raskolnikov's friend. a poor ex-student, he responds
to his poverty not by taking from others but by working even harder.
razumikhin is raskolnikov's foil, illustrating through his kindness and
amicability the extent to which raskolnikov has alienated himself
from society. to some extent, he even serves as raskolnikov's replacement,
stepping in to advise and protect pulcheria alexandrovna and dunya.
his name comes from the russian word razum, which
means "reason" or "intelligence."
