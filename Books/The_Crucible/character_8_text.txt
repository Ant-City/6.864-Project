mrs. putnam: mark it for a sign, mark it! 
 
rebecca  nurse,  seventy-two,  enters.  she  is  white-haired,  leaning  upon  her 
walking-stick. 
 
putnam, pointing at the whimpering betty: that is a notorious sign of witchcraft 
afoot, goody nurse, a prodigious sign! 
 
mrs. putnam: my mother told me that! when they cannot bear to hear the name 
of - 
 
parris, trembling: rebecca, rebecca, go to her, we’re lost. she suddenly cannot 
bear to hear the lord’s - 
 
giles corey, eighty-three, enters. he is knotted with muscle, canny, inquisitive, 
and still powerful. 
 
rebecca: there is hard sickness here, giles corey, so please to keep the quiet. 
 
giles: i’ve not said a word. no one here can testify i’ve said a word. is she 
going to fly again? i hear she flies. 
 
putnam: man, be quiet now! 
 
everything  is  quiet.  rebecca  walks  across  the  room  to  the  bed.  gentleness 
exudes from her. betty is quietly whimpering, eyes shut, rebecca simply stands

putnam, pleased: it does not seem to help us today, mr. hale. we look to you to

hale: your child ails too? 
 
mrs. putnam: her soul, her soul seems flown away. she sleeps and yet she 
walks... 
 
putnam: she cannot eat. 
 
hale: cannot eat! thinks on it, then, to proctor and giles corey: do you men 
have addicted children? 
 
parris: no, no, these are farmers. john proctor - 
 
giles corey: he don’t believe in witches. 
 
proctor, to hale: i never spoke on witches one way or the other. will you come, 
giles? 
 
giles: no - no, john, i think not. i have some few queer questions of my own to 
ask this fellow.

proctor watches from the doorway. the clank of chain is heard. 
 
proctor:  herrick!  herrick,  don’t  chain  her!  he  rushes  out  the  door.  from 
outside: damn you, man, you will not chain her! off with them! i’ll not have it! 
i will not have her chained! 
 
there  are  other  men's  voices  against  his.  hale,  in  a  fever  of  guilt  and 
uncertainty,  turns  from  the  door  to  avoid  the  sight;  mary  warren  bursts  into 
tears and sits weeping. giles corey calls to hale. 
 
giles:  and  yet  silent,  minister?  it  is  fraud,  you  know  it  is  fraud!  %hat  keeps 
you, man? 
 
proctor is half braced, half pushed into the room by two deputies and herrick. 
 
proctor: i’ll pay you, herrick, i will surely pay you! 
 
herrick, panting: in god’s name, john, i cannot help myself. i must chain them 
all.  now  let  you  keep  inside  this  house  till  1  am  gone!  he  goes  out  with  his 
deputies.

francis, struck by hate’s mood: i never heard no murder done in salem. 
 
proctor - he has been reached by hale’s words: leave me, francis, leave me. 
giles, shaken: john - tell me, are we lost? 
proctor: go home now, giles, we’ll speak on it tomorrow. 
giles: let you think on it. we’ll come early, eh? 
proctor: aye. go now, giles. 
giles: good night, then.

enter deputy governor danforth and, behind him, ezekiel cheever and parris. 
on his appearance, silence falls. danforth is a grave man in his sixties, of some 
humor and sophistication that does not, however, interfere with an exact loyalty 
to his position and his cause. he comes down to giles, who awaits his wrath. 
 
danforth, looking directly at giles: who is this man? 
 
parris: giles corey, sir, and a more contentious - 
 
giles, to parris: i am asked the question, and i am old enough to answer it! to 
danforth,  who  impresses  him  and  to  whom  he  smiles  through  his  strain:  my 
name  is  corey,  sir,  giles  corey.  i  have  six  hundred  acres,  and  timber  in 
addition. it is my wife you be condemning now. he indicates the courtroom. 
 
danforth: and how do you imagine to help her cause with such contemptuous 
riot? now be gone. your old age alone keeps you out of jai

danforth: peace, judge hathorne. do you know who i am, mr. nurse?

are. 
 
danforth:  and  do  you  know  that  near  to  four  hundred  are  in  the  jails  from 
marblehead to lynn, and upon my signature? 
 
francis: i - 
 
danforth: and seventy-two condemned to hang by that signature? 
 
francis: excellency, i never thought to say it to such a weighty judge, but you 
are deceived. 
 
enter giles corey from left. all turn to see as he beckons in mary warren with 
proctor.  mary  is  keeping  her  eyes  to  the  ground;  proctor  has  her  elbow  as 
though she were near collapse. 
 
parris, on seeing her, in shock: mary warren! he goes directly to bend close to 
her face. what are you about here? 
 
proctor,  pressing  parris  away  from  her  with  a  gentle  but  burnt  motion  of 
protectiveness: she would speak with the deputy governor. 
 
danforth, shocked by this, turns to herrick: did

hale: but it does not follow that everyone accused is part of it. 
 
danforth; no uncorrupted man may fear this court, mr. hale! none! to giles: 
you  are  under  arrest  in  contempt  of  this  court.  now  sit  you  down  and  take 
counsel with yourself, or you will be set in the jail until you decide to answer all 
questions. 
 
giles corey makes a rush for putnam. proctor lunges and holds him. 
 
proctor: no, giles! 
 
giles, over proctor’s shoulder at putnam: i’ll cut your throat, putnam, i’ll kill 
you yet! 
 
proctor,  forcing  him  into  a  chair:  peace,  giles,  peace.  re-leasing  him.  we’ll 
prove ourselves. now we will. he starts to turn to danforth. 
 
giles: say nothin’ more, john. pointing at danforth: he’s only playin’ you! he 
means to hang us all!

proctor: press? 
 
elizabeth: great stones they lay upon his chest until he plead aye or nay. with a 
tender  smile  for  the  old  man:  they  say  he  give  them  but  two  words.  “more

proctor, numbed - a thread to weave into his agony: “more weight,”
