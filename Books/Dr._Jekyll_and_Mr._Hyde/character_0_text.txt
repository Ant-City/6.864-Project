utterson, though he took charge of it now that it
was made, had refused to lend the least assistance in the making of
it; it provided not only that, in case of the decease of henry
jekyll, m.d., d.c.l., l.l.d., f.r.s., etc., all his possessions were
to pass into the hands of his "friend and benefactor edward hyde,"

exceeding three calendar months," the said edward hyde should step
into the said henry jekyll's shoes without further delay and free
from any burthen or obligation, beyond the payment of a few small
sums to the members of the doctor's household. this document had
long been the lawyer's eyesore. it offended him both as a lawyer and
as a lover of the sane and customary sides of life, to whom the
fanciful was the immodest. and hitherto it was his ignorance of mr.
hyde that had swelled his indignation; now, by a sudden turn, it was
his knowledge. it was already bad enough when the na

feeling. for these two were old friends, old mates both at school
and college, both thorough respecters of themselves and of each
other, and, what does not always follow, men who thoroughly enjoyed
each other's company.

after a little rambling talk, the lawyer led up to the subject
which so disagreeably pre-occupied his mind.

"i suppose, lanyon," said he "you and i must be the two oldest
friends that henry jekyll has?"

"i wish the friends were younger," chuckled dr. lanyon. "but i
suppose we are. and what of that? i see little of him now."


"indeed?" said utterson. "i thought you had a bond of common
interest."

"we had," was the reply. "but it is more than ten years since henry
jekyll became too fanciful for me. he began to go wrong, wrong in

lighted up with professional ambition. "this will make a deal of
noise," he said. "and perhaps you can help us to the man." and he
briefly narrated what the maid had seen, and showed the broken
stick.

mr. utterson had already quailed at the name of hyde; but when the
stick was laid before him, he could doubt no longer; broken and
battered as it was, he recognised it for one that he had himself
presented many years before to henry jekyll.

"is this mr. hyde a person of small stature?" he inquired.

"particularly small and particularly wicked-looking, is what the
maid calls him," said the officer.

mr. utterson reflected; and then, raising his head, "if you will
come with me in my cab," he said, "i think i can take you to his
house."

it was by this time about nine in the morning, and the first fog of
the season. a great chocolate-coloured pall lowered over heaven, but

little and showed him a dingy street, a gin palace, a low french
eating-house, a shop for the retail of penny numbers and twopenny
salads, many ragged children huddled in the doorways, and many
women of different nationalities passing out, key in hand, to have a
morning glass; and the next moment the fog settled down again upon
that part, as brown as umber, and cut him off from his blackguardly
surroundings. this was the home of henry jekyll's favourite; of a
man who was heir to a quarter of a million sterling.

an ivory-faced and silvery-haired old woman opened the door. she
had an evil face, smoothed by hypocrisy; but her manners were
excellent. yes, she said, this was mr. hyde's, but he was not at
home; he had been in that night very late,

the lawyer dreaded to behold the contents. "i have buried one
friend to-day," he thought: "what if this should cost me
another?" and then he condemned the fear as a disloyalty, and
broke the seal. within there was another enclosure, likewise
sealed, and marked upon the cover as "not to be opened till the
death or disappearance of dr. henry jekyll." utterson could not
trust his eyes. yes, it was disappearance; here again, as in the
mad will which he had long ago restored to its author, here again
were the idea of a disappearance and the name of henry jekyll
bracketed. but in the will, that idea had sprung from the
sinister suggestion of

in every step of it! but hark again, a little closer--put your
heart in your ears, mr. utterson, and tell me, is that the
doctor's foot?"

the steps fell lightly and oddly, with a certain swing, for all
they went so slowly; it was different indeed from the heavy
creaking tread of henry jekyll. utterson sighed. "is there never
anything else?" he asked.

poole nodded. "once," he said. "once i heard it weeping!"

"weeping? how that?" said the lawyer, conscious of a sudden chill
of horror.

each closet needed but a glance, for all were empty, and all, by
the dust that fell from their doors, had stood long unopened. the
cellar, indeed, was filled with crazy lumber, mostly dating from
the times of the surgeon who was jekyll's predecessor; but even
as they opened the door they were advertised of the uselessness
of further search, by the fall of a perfect mat of cobweb which
had for years sealed up the entrance. nowhere was there any trace
of henry jekyll, dead or alive.

poole stamped on the flags of the corridor. "he must be buried
here," he said, hearkening to the sound.

"or he may have fled," said utterson, and he turned to examine
the door in the by-street. it was locked; and lying near by on
the flags, they found the key, already stained with rust.

"this does not look like use," observed the lawyer.

"use!" echoed poole. "do you not see, sir, it is broken? much as
if a man had stamped on it."

they went out, locking the door of the theatre behind them; and
utterson, once more leaving the servants gathered about the fire
in the hall, trudged back to his office to read the two
narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.

                          dr. lanyon's narrative

on the ninth of january, now four days ago, i received by the
evening delivery a registered envelope, addressed in the hand of
my colleague and old school-companion, henry jekyll. i was a good
deal surprised by this; for we were by no means in the habit of
correspondence; i had seen the man, dined with him, indeed, the
night before; and i could imagine nothing in our intercourse that
should justify formality of registration. the contents increased
my wonder; for this is how the letter ran:

                                 "10th december, 18---

"dear lanyon, you are one of my oldest friends; and although we
may have differed at times on scientific questions,

upon my soul. it is possible that the postoffice may fail me, and

dear lanyon, do my errand when it shall be most convenient for
you in the course of the day; and once more expect my messenger
at midnight. it may then already be too late; and if that night
passes without event, you will know that you have seen the last
of henry jekyll."


upon the reading of this letter, i made sure my colleague was
insane; but till that was proved beyond the possibility of doubt,
i felt bound to do as he requested. the less i understood of this
farrago, the less i was in a position to judge of its importance;
and an appeal so worded could not be set aside without a grave
responsibility. i rose accordingly from table, got into a hansom,
and drove straight to jekyll's house. the butler was awaiting my
arrival; he had received by the

and i showed him an example, and sat down myself in my customary
seat and with as fair an imitation of my ordinary manner to a
patient, as the lateness of the hour, the nature of my
pre-occupations, and the horror i had of my visitor, would suffer
me to muster.

"i beg your pardon, dr. lanyon," he replied civilly enough. "what
you say is very well founded; and my impatience has shown its
heels to my politeness. i come here at the instance of your
colleague, dr. henry jekyll, on a piece of business of some
moment; and i under-

see, in spite of his collected manner, that he was wrestling
against the approaches of the hysteria--"i understood, a
drawer..."

but here i took pity on my visitor's suspense, and some perhaps
on my own growing curiosity.

"there it is, sir," said i, pointing to the drawer, where it lay
on the floor behind a table and still covered with the sheet.

looked there came, i thought, a change--he seemed to swell--
his face became suddenly black and the features seemed to melt
and alter--and the next moment, i had sprung to my feet and
leaped back against the wall, my arm raised to shield me from
that prodigy, my mind submerged in terror.

"o god!" i screamed, and "o god!" again and again; for there
before my eyes--pale and shaken, and half-fainting, and groping
before him with his hands, like a man restored from death--
there stood henry jekyll!

what he told me in the next hour, i cannot bring my mind to set
on paper. i saw what i saw, i heard what i heard, and my soul
sickened at it; and yet now when that sight has faded from my
eyes, i ask myself if i believe it, and i cannot answer. my life
is shaken to its roots; sleep has left me; the deadliest terror
sits by me at all hours of the day and night; i feel that my days
are numbered, and that i

i will say but one thing, utterson, and that (if you can bring
your mind to credit it) will be more than enough. the creature
who crept into my house that night was, on jekyll's own
confession, known by the name of hyde and hunted for in every
corner of the land as the murderer of carew.

i was born in the year 18--- to a large fortune, endowed besides
with excellent parts, inclined by nature to industry, fond of the
respect of the wise and good among my fellow-men, and thus, as
might have been supposed, with every guarantee of an honourable
and distinguished future. and indeed the worst of my faults was a
certain impatient gaiety of disposition, such as has made the
happiness of many, but such as i found it hard to reconcile with

but that which i suppose to be most probable. the evil side of my
nature, to which i had now transferred the stamping efficacy, was
less robust and less developed than the good which i had just
deposed. again, in the course of my life, which had been, after
all, nine-tenths a life of effort, virtue, and control, it had
been much less exercised and much less exhausted. and hence, as i
think, it came about that edward hyde was so much smaller,

slighter, and younger than henry jekyll. even as good shone upon
the countenance of the one, evil was written broadly and plainly
on the face of the other. evil besides (which i must still
believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that body an
imprint of deformity and decay. and yet when i looked upon that
ugly idol in the glass, i was conscious of no repugnance, rather
of a leap of welcome. this, too, was myself. it seemed natural
and human. in my eyes it bore a livelier image of the spirit, it
seemed more express an

i lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and conclusive
experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained to be seen if
i had lost my identity beyond redemption and must flee before
daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and hurrying back
to my cabinet, i once more prepared and drank the cup, once more
suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came to myself once more
with the character, the stature, and the face of henry jekyll.

that night i had come to the fatal cross-roads. had i approached
my discovery in a more noble spirit, had i risked the experiment
while under the empire of generous or pious aspirations, all must
have been otherwise, and from these agonies of death and birth, i
had come forth an angel instead of a fiend. the drug had no
discriminating action; it was neither diabolical nor divine; it

at that time my virtue slumbered; my evil, kept awake by
ambition, was alert and swift to seize the occasion; and the
thing that was projected was edward hyde. hence, although i had
now two characters as well as two appearances, one was wholly
evil, and the other was still the old henry jekyll, that
incongruous compound of whose reformation and improvement i had
already learned to despair. the movement was thus wholly toward
the worse.

even at that time, i had not yet conquered my aversion to the
dryness of a life of study. i would still be merrily disposed at
times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified,
and i was not only well known and highly considered, but growing
toward the elderly man, this incoherency of my life was daily
growing more unwelcome. i

the stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead,
quietly at home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man
who could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be henry jekyll.

the pleasures which i made haste to seek in my disguise were, as
i have said, undignified; i would scarce use a harder term. but
in the hands of edward hyde, they soon began to turn toward the
monstrous. when i would come back from these excursions, i was
often plunged into a kind of wonder at my vicarious depravity.

alone to do his good pleasure, was a being inherently malign and

times aghast before the acts of edward hyde; but the situation
was apart from ordinary laws, and insidiously relaxed the grasp
of conscience. it was hyde, after all, and hyde alone, that was
guilty. jekyll was no worse; he woke again to his good qualities
seemingly unimpaired; he would even make haste, where it was
possible, to undo the evil done by hyde. and thus his conscience

met with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, i
shall no more than mention. an act of cruelty to a child aroused
against me the anger of a passer-by, whom i recognised the other
day in the person of your kinsman; the doctor and the child's
family joined him; there were moments when i feared for my life;
and at last, in order to pacify their too just resentment, edward
hyde had to bring them to the door, and pay them in a cheque
drawn in the name of henry jekyll. but this danger was easily
eliminated from the future, by opening an account at another bank
in the name of edward hyde himself; and when, by sloping my own
hand backward, i had supplied my double with a signature, i
thought i sat beyond the reach of fate.

breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and
bounding from my bed, i rushed to the mirror. at the sight that
met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely thin

lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on
my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet
still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of
the avenger. hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded the
draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man. the pangs of
transformation had not done tearing him, before henry jekyll,
with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse, had fallen upon
his knees and lifted his clasped hands to god. the veil of
self-indulgence was rent from head to foot, i saw my life as a
whole: i followed it up from the days of childhood, when i had
