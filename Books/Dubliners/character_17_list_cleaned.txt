[CHARACTER] - 
the
quiet and prim maid and protagonist from "clay" who goes to visit
joe donnelly, the man she nursed when he was a boy. [CHARACTER] is precise
and dedicated to detail. she moves through most of the narrative
with content satisfaction and laughter. her happiness, however,
faces challenges in the smallest of events, and her disproportionate
reactions to small troubles suggest a remote detachment from life.
