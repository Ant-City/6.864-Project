Sir Arthur Eddington (1882-1944) - 
An English physicist. Eddington tested Einstein's
theory of general relativity during a 1919 total solar eclipse and
found that the bending of light rays that Einstein predicted actually occurred.
(Eddington's conclusions were later called into question, but at
the time they turned Einstein into an international celebrity.)
