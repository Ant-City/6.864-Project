him. while she waited, tapping a long, precise pencil-point on the
desk-tablet, he half identified her with the fairy girl of his dreams.
he imagined their eyes meeting with terrifying recognition; imagined
touching her lips with frightened reverence and--she was chirping,
"any more, mist' babbitt?" he grunted, "that winds it up, i guess," and
turned heavily away.

for all his wandering thoughts, they had never been more intimate than
this. he often reflected, "nev' forget how old jake offutt said a wise
bird never goes love-making in his own office or his own home. start
trouble. sure. but--"

in twenty-three years of married life he had peered uneasily at every
graceful ankle, every soft shoulder; in thought he had treasured them;
but not once had he hazarded respectability by adventuring. now, as
he calculated the cost of repapering the styles house, he was restless
again, discontented about nothing and everything, ashamed of his
discontentment, and lonely for the fairy girl.

ot very agreeably, while the avonlea cesspool
was a waring septic tank.

the whole of the glen oriole project was a suggestion that babbitt,
though he really did hate men recognized as swindlers, was not too
unreasonably honest. operators and buyers prefer that brokers should
not be in competition with them as operators and buyers themselves,
but attend to their clients' interests only. it was supposed that the
babbitt-thompson company were merely agents for glen oriole, serving
the real owner, jake offutt, but the fact was that babbitt and thompson
owned sixty-two per cent. of the glen, the president and purchasing
agent of the zenith street traction company owned twenty-eight per
cent., and jake offutt (a gang-politician, a small manufacturer,
a tobacco-chewing old farceur who enjoyed dirty politics, business
diplomacy, and cheating at poker) had only ten per cent., which
babbitt and the traction officials had given to him for "fixing" health
inspectors and fire inspectors and a member of the s

the entrance lobby of the athletic club was gothic, the washroom roman
imperial, the lounge spanish mission, and the reading-room in
chinese chippendale, but the gem of the club was the dining-room, the
masterpiece of ferdinand reitman, zenith's busiest architect. it was
lofty and half-timbered, with tudor leaded casements, an oriel, a
somewhat musicianless musicians'-gallery, and tapestries believed
to illustrate the granting of magna charta. the open beams had
been hand-adzed at jake offutt's car-body works, the hinge; were of
hand-wrought iron, the wainscot studded with handmade wooden pegs, and
at one end of the room was a heraldic and hooded stone fireplace which
the club's advertising-pamphlet asserted to be not only larger than any
of the fireplaces in european castles but of a draught incomparably more
scientific. it was also much cleaner, as no fire had ever been built in
it.

half of the tables were mammoth slabs which seated twenty or thirty men.

"it is not, and i have lift in most of them," murmured dr. yavitch.

"well, matter of taste. personally, i prefer a city with a future so
unknown that it excites my imagination. but what i particularly want--"

"you," said dr. yavitch, "are a middle-road liberal, and you haven't
the slightest idea what you want. i, being a revolutionist, know exactly
what i want--and what i want now is a drink."

at that moment in zenith, jake offutt, the politician, and henry t.
thompson were in conference. offutt suggested, "the thing to do is to
get your fool son-in-law, babbitt, to put it over. he's one of these
patriotic guys. when he grabs a piece of property for the gang, he makes
it look like we were dyin' of love for the dear peepul, and i do love to
buy respectability--reasonable. wonder how long we can keep it up, hank?

ed man, in tan silk shirt, checked vest hanging open, and
burning brown trousers--mr. healey hanson. mr. hanson said only "yuh?"
but his implacable and contemptuous eyes queried babbitt's soul, and he
seemed not at all impressed by the new dark-gray suit for which (as he
had admitted to every acquaintance at the athletic club) babbitt had
paid a hundred and twenty-five dollars.

"glad meet you, mr. hanson. say, uh--i'm george babbitt of the
babbitt-thompson realty company. i'm a great friend of jake offutt's."

"well, what of it?"

"say, uh, i'm going to have a party, and jake told me you'd be able to
fix me up with a little gin." in alarm, in obsequiousness, as hanson's
eyes grew more bored, "you telephone to jake about me, if you want to."

hanson answered by jerking his head to indicate the entrance to the
back room, and strolled away. babbitt melodramatically crept into
an apartment containing four round tables, eleven chairs, a brewery
calendar, and a smell. he waited. thrice he saw healey h

liable conrad lyte, the merry miser,
conrad lyte, appeared, and babbitt suggested his buying a parcel of land
in the new residential section of dorchester, lyte said hastily, too
hastily, "no, no, don't want to go into anything new just now."

a week later babbitt learned, through henry thompson, that the officials
of the street traction company were planning another real-estate coup,
and that sanders, torrey and wing, not the babbitt-thompson company,
were to handle it for them. "i figure that jake offutt is kind of
leery about the way folks are talking about you. of course jake is a
rock-ribbed old die-hard, and he probably advised the traction fellows
to get some other broker. george, you got to do something!" trembled
thompson.

and, in a rush, babbitt agreed. all nonsense the way people misjudged
him, but still--he determined to join the good citizens' league the
next time he was asked, and in furious resignation he waited. he wasn't
asked. they ignored him. he did not have the courage to go

he knew by the cheer that he was secure again and popular; he knew that
he would no more endanger his security and popularity by straying from
the clan of good fellows.

henry thompson dashed into the office, clamoring, "george! big news!
jake offutt says the traction bunch are dissatisfied with the way
sanders, torrey and wing handled their last deal, and they're willing to
dicker with us!"

babbitt was pleased in the realization that the last scar of his
rebellion was healed, yet as he drove home he was annoyed by such
background thoughts as had never weakened him in his days of belligerent
conformity. he discovered that he actually did not consider the traction
group quite honest. "well, he'd carry out one more deal for them, but
