ued;
    where valiant talbot, above human thought,
    enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
    hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
    here, there, and everywhere, enrag'd he slew
    the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
    all the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
    his soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
    'a talbot! a talbot!' cried out amain,
    and rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
    here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
    if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward.
    he, being in the vaward plac'd behind
    with purpose to relieve and follow them-
    cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke;
    hence grew the general wreck and massacre.
    enclosed were they with their enemies.
    a base walloon, to win the dauphin's grace,
    thrust talbot with a spear into the back;
    whom all france, with their chief assembled strength,
    durst not presume to look once in the face.
  bedford. is talbot slain?

  of edward king, the third of that descent;
    during whose reign the percies of the north,
    finding his usurpation most unjust,
    endeavour'd my advancement to the throne.
    the reason mov'd these warlike lords to this
    was, for that-young richard thus remov'd,
    leaving no heir begotten of his body--
    i was the next by birth and parentage;
    for by my mother i derived am
    from lionel duke of clarence, third son
    to king edward the third; whereas he
    from john of gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
    being but fourth of that heroic line.
    but mark: as in this haughty great attempt
    they laboured to plant the rightful heir,
    i lost my liberty, and they their lives.
    long after this, when henry the fifth,
    succeeding his father bolingbroke, did reign,
    thy father, earl of cambridge, then deriv'd
    from famous edmund langley, duke of york,
    marrying my sister, that thy mother was,
    again, in pity of my hard distress,

ornets, were in talbot's place!
    so should we save a valiant gentleman

    mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep

  york. he dies; we lose; i break my warlike word.
    we mourn: france smiles. we lose: they daily get-

  lucy. then god take mercy on brave talbot's soul,
    and on his son, young john, who two hours since
    i met in travel toward his warlike father.
    this seven years did not talbot see his son;
    and now they meet where both their lives are done.
  york. alas, what joy shall noble talbot have
    to bid his young son welcome to his grave?
    away! vexation almost stops my breath,
    that sund'red friends greet in the hour of death.
    lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can

  talbot. o young john talbot! i did send for thee
    to tutor thee in stratagems of war,
    that talbot's name might be in thee reviv'd
    when sapless age and weak unable limbs
    should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
    but, o malignant and ill-boding stars!
    now thou art come unto a feast of death,
    a terrible and unavoided danger;
    therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse,
    and i'll direct thee how thou shalt escape

    the world will say he is not talbot's blood
    that basely fled when noble talbot stood.
  talbot. fly to revenge my death, if i be slain.
  john. he that flies so will ne'er return again.
  talbot. if we both stay, we both are sure to die.
  john. then let me stay; and, father, do you fly.
    your loss is great, so your regard should be;
    my worth unknown, no loss is known in me;
    upon my death the french can little boast;
    in yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
    flight cannot stain the honour you have won;
    but mine it will, that no exploit have done;
    you fled for vantage, every one will swear;
    but if i bow, they'll say it was for fear.
    there is no hope that ever i will stay

  talbot. upon my blessing i command thee go.
  john. to fight i will, but not to fly the foe.
  talbot. part of thy father may be sav'd in thee.
  john. no part of him but will be shame in me.
  talbot. thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.
  john. yes, your renowned name; shall flight abuse it?
  talbot. thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.
  john. you cannot witness for me, being slain.
    if death be so apparent, then both fly.
  talbot. and leave my followers here to fight and die?
    my age was never tainted with such shame.
  john. and shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
    no more can i be severed from your side
    than can yourself yourself yourself in twain divide.

om thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
    of thy first fight, i soon encountered
    and, interchanging blows, i quickly shed
    some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace
    bespoke him thus: 'contaminated, base,
    and misbegotten blood i spill of thine,
    mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
    which thou didst force from talbot, my brave boy.'
    here purposing the bastard to destroy,
    came in strong rescue. speak, thy father's care;
    art thou not weary, john? how dost thou fare?
    wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
    now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
    fly, to revenge my death when i am dead:
    the help of one stands me in little stead.
    o, too much folly is it, well i wot,
    to hazard all our lives in one small boat!
    if i to-day die not with frenchmen's rage,
    to-morrow i shall die with mickle age.
    by me they nothing gain an if i stay:
    'tis but the short'ning of my life one day.

  john. the sword of orleans hath not made me smart;
