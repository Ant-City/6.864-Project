[CHARACTER] - 
                a
surreal figure who never appears in the book except by reputation.
[CHARACTER] possesses a seemingly infinite number of identities, among
them pimp, bookie, and preacher who speaks on the subject of "invisibility." when
the narrator wears dark glasses in harlem one day, many people mistake
him for [CHARACTER]. the narrator realizes that [CHARACTER]'s shape-shifting capacity
represents a life of extreme freedom, complexity, and possibility.
he also recognizes that this capacity fosters a cynical and manipulative inauthenticity.
[CHARACTER] thus figures crucially in the book's larger examination
of the problem of identity and self-conception.
