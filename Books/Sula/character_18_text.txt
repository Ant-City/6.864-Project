radually found that she could not tell one from the other.
the deweys would not allow it. they got all mixed up in her
head, and finally she could not literally believe her eyes.
they spoke with one voice, thought with one mind, and
maintained an annoying privacy. stouthearted, surly, and
wholly unpredictable, the deweys remained a mystery not
only during all of their lives in medallion but after as well.
the deweys came in 1921, but the year before eva had
given a small room off the kitchen to tar baby, a beautiful,
slight, quiet man who never spoke above a whisper. most
people said he was half white, but eva said he was all
white. that she knew blood when she saw it, and he didn't
have none. when he first came to medallion, the people
called him pretty johnnie, but eva looked at his milky skin
and cornsilk hair and out of a mixture of fun and meanness
called him tar baby. he was a mountain boy who stayed to
himself, bothering no one, intent solely on drinking himself
to death. at first he wo

" never tried to
get him to participate in the church activities. they just
listened to him sing, wept and thought very graphically of
their own imminent deaths. the people either accepted his
own evaluation of his life, or were indifferent to it. there
was, however, a measure of contempt in their indifference,
for they had little patience with people who took themselves
that seriously. seriously enough to try to die. and it was
natural that he, after all, became the first one to join
shadrack--tar baby and the deweys--on national suicide
day. under eva's distant eye, and prey to her
idiosyncrasies, her own children grew up stealthily: pearl
married at fourteen and moved to flint, michigan, from
where she posted frail letters to her mother with two dollars
folded into the writing paper. sad little nonsense letters
about minor troubles, her husband's job and who the
children favored. hannah married a laughing man named
rekus who died when their daughter sula was about three
years old, at which

et back to medallion until
1920. he wrote letters from new york, washington, d.c.,
and chicago full of promises of homecomings, but there
was obviously something wrong. finally some two or three
days after christmas, he arrived with just the shadow of his
old dip-down walk. his hair had been neither cut nor
combed in months, his clothes were pointless and he had
no socks. but he did have a black bag, a paper sack, and a
sweet, sweet smile. everybody welcomed him and gave
him a warm room next to tar baby's and waited for him to
tell them whatever it was he wanted them to know. they
waited in vain for his telling but not long for the knowing. his
habits were much like tar baby's but there were no bottles,
and plum was sometimes cheerful and animated. hannah
watched and eva waited. then he began to steal from
them, take trips to cincinnati and sleep for days in his room
with the record player going. he got even thinner, since he
ate only snatches of things at beginnings or endings of
meals. it wa

was quiet. "if i can do that to
myself, what you suppose i'll do to you?" the shifting dirt
was the only way nel knew that they were moving away; she
was looking at sula's face, which seemed miles and miles
away. but toughness was not their quality--
adventuresomeness was--and a mean determination to
explore everything that interested them, from one-eyed
chickens high-stepping in their penned yards to mr.
buckland reed's gold teeth, from the sound of sheets
flapping in the wind to the labels on tar baby's wine bottles.
and they had no priorities. they could be distracted from
watching a fight with mean razors by the glorious smell of
hot tar being poured by roadmen two hundred yards away.
in the safe harbor of each other's company they could afford
to abandon the ways of other people and concentrate on
their own perceptions of things. when mrs. wright
reminded nel to pull her nose, she would do it
enthusiastically but without the least hope in the world.

nights (lit by the excitement of newly installed street lights);
of lemonyellow afternoons bright with iced drinks and
splashes of daffodils. it showed in the damp faces of her
children and the river-smoothness of their voices. even her
own body was not immune to the magic. she would sit on
the floor to sew as she had done as a girl, fold her legs up
under her or do a little dance that fitted some tune in her
head. there were easy sun-washed days and purple dusks
in which tar baby sang "abide with me" at prayer
meetings, his lashes darkened by tears, his silhouette limp
with regret against the whitewashed walls of greater saint
matthew's. nel listened and was moved to smile. to smile
at the sheer loveliness that pressed in from the windows
and touched his grief, making it a pleasure to behold.
although it was she alone who saw this magic, she did not
wonder at it. she knew it was all due to sula's return to the
bottom. it was like getting the use of an eye back, having a

"well, give me the real one." "i don't know the real one. she
just didn't belong in that house. digging around in the
cupboards, picking up pots and ice picks... " "you sure
have changed. that house was always full of people
digging in cupboards and carrying on." "that's the reason,
then." "sula. come on, now." "you've changed too. i didn't
used to have to explain everything to you." nel blushed.
"who's feeding the deweys and tar baby? you?" "sure
me. anyway tar baby don't eat and the deweys still crazy."
"i heard one of 'em's mamma came to take him back but
didn't know which was hern." "don't nobody know." "and
eva? you doing the work for her too?" "well, since you
haven't heard it, let me tell you. eva's real sick. i had her put
where she could be watched and taken care of." "where
would that be?" "out by beechnut." "you mean that home

other appointment. the
ribbon-tying was followed by other activity, and when ajax
came that evening, bringing her a reed whistle he had
carved that morning, not only was the green ribbon still in
her hair, but the bathroom was gleaming, the bed was
made, and the table was set for two. he gave her the reed
whistle, unlaced his shoes and sat in the rocking chair in
the kitchen. sula walked toward him and kissed his mouth.
he ran his fingers along the nape of her neck. "i bet you
ain't even missed tar baby, have you?" he asked.
"missed? no. where is he?" ajax smiled at her delicious
indifference. "jail." "since when?" "last saturday."
"picked up for drunk?" "little bit more than that," he
answered and went ahead to tell her about his own
involvement in another of tar baby's misfortunes. on
saturday afternoon tar baby had stumbled drunk into traffic
on the new river road. a woman driver swerved to avoid
him and hit another car. when the police came, they
recognized the woman as the mayor's niece a

men went to the station to see about him. at first they
wouldn't let them in. but they relented after ajax and the
other two just stood around for one hour and a half and
repeated their request at regular intervals. when they finally
got permission to go in and looked in at him in the cell, he
was twisted up in a corner badly beaten and dressed in
nothing but extremely soiled underwear. ajax and the other
men asked the officer why tar baby coul

do that, nellie. it's going to be all right." "what ails you?
have they said?" sula licked the corners of her lips. "you
want to talk about that?" nel smiled, slightly, at the
bluntness she had forgotten. "no. no, i don't, but you sure
you should be staying up here alone?" "nathan comes by.

through the phlegm. "what you talking about? i like my own

"what you mean?" "imean maybe it wasn't you. maybe it
was me." nel took two steps out the door and closed it
behind her. she walked down the hall and down the four
flights of steps. the house billowed around her light then
dark, full of presences without sounds. the deweys, tar
baby, the newly married couples, mr. buckland reed,
patsy, valentine, and the beautiful hannah peace. where
were they? eva out at the old folks' home, the deweys living
anywhere, tar baby steeped in wine, and sula upstairs in
eva's bed with a boarded-up window and an empty
pocketbook on the dresser. * * * when nel closed the door,
sula reached for more medicine. then she turned the pillow
over to its cool side and thought about her old friend. "so
she will walk on down that road, her back so straight in that
old green coat, the strap of her handbag pushed back all
the way to the elbow, thinking how much i have cost her and

magnificent teeth ran out from number 7 and danced a little
jig around the befuddled shadrack, then cut into a wild
aping of his walk, his song and his bell-ringing. by now
women were holding their stomachs, and the men were
slapping their knees. it was mrs. jackson, who ate ice, who
tripped down off her porch and marched--actually marchedalong
behind him. the scene was so comic the people
walked into the road to make sure they saw it all. in that way
the parade started. everybody, dessie, tar baby, patsy,
mr. buckland reed, teapot's mamma, valentine, the
deweys, mrs. jackson, irene, the proprietor of the palace of
cosmetology, reba, the herrod brothers and flocks of
teen-agers got into the mood and, laughing, dancing,
calling to one another, formed a pied piper's band behind
shadrack. as the initial group of about twenty people
passed more houses, they called to the people standing in
doors and leaning out of windows to join them; to help them

pressed up against steel ribs and timber blocks young
boys strangled when the oxygen left them to join the water.
outside, others watched in terror as ice split and earth
shook beneath their feet. mrs. jackson, weighing less than
100 pounds, slid down the bank and met with an open
mouth the ice she had craved all her life. tar baby, dessie,
ivy, valentine, the herrod boys, some of ajax's younger
brothers and the deweys (at least it was supposed; their
bodies were never found)--all died there. mr. buckland
reed escaped, so did patsy and her two boys, as well as
some fifteen or twenty who had not gotten close enough to
fall, or whose timidity would not let them enter an unfinished
tunnel. and all the while shadrack stood there. having
forgotten his song and his rope, he just stood there high up
on the bank ringing, ringing
