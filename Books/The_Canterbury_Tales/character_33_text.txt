when that the first cock crowed had, anon

for thereby thought he to be gracious.

dark was the night as pitch or as the coal,
and at the window she put out her hole,
and absolon him fell ne bet ne werse,
but with his mouth he kiss'd her naked erse
full savourly. when he was ware of this,
aback he start, and thought it was amiss;
for well he wist a woman hath no beard.
he felt a thing all rough, and long y-hair'd,

and said; "undo, gerveis, and that anon."

"what? absolon, what? christe's sweete tree*,                     *cross

now nicholas was risen up to piss,
