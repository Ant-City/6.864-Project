we must.

is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding
and watching?

what do you mean?

i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake
the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught
him, they have to fight with him.

all these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.

well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?

certainly.

and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog
or any other animal? have you never observed how invincible and
unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any
creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?

i have.

then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are
required in the guardian.

true.

and also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?

yes.

but are not these spirited natures apt to be savage with one another,
and with everybody else?

a difficulty

 by no means easy to overcome, he replied.

whereas, i said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and gentle
to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting
for their enemies to destroy them.

true, he said.

what is to be done then? i said; how shall we find a gentle nature which
has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?

true.

he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two
qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and
hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.

i am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.

here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded.--my
friend, i said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost
sight of the image which we had before us.

wh

s gifted with those opposite
qualities.

and where do you find them?

many animals, i replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog
is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to
their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.

yes, i know.

then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our
finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?

certainly not.

would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited
nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?

i do not apprehend your meaning.

the trait of which i am speaking, i replied, may be also seen in the
dog, and is remarkable in the animal.

what trait?

why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,
he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the
other any good. did this never strike you as curious?

the matter never struck me before; but i quite recognise the truth of
your remark.

and s

 what he likes and dislikes by the test
of knowledge and ignorance?

most assuredly.

and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?

they are the same, he replied.

and may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be
gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of
wisdom and knowledge?

that we may safely affirm.

then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will
require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and
strength?

undoubtedly.

then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,
how are they to be reared and educated? is not this an enquiry which
may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final
end--how do justice and injustice grow up in states? for we do not want
either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an
inconvenient length.

adeimantus thought that the enquiry would be of great service to us.

, and let the censors receive any tale of fiction which is good,
and reject the bad; and we will desire mothers and nurses to tell their
children the authorised ones only. let them fashion the mind with such
tales, even more fondly than they mould the body with their hands; but
most of those which are now in use must be discarded.

of what tales are you speaking? he said.

you may find a model of the lesser in the greater, i said; for they are
necessarily of the same type, and there is the same spirit in both of
them.

very likely, he replied; but i do not as yet know what you would term
the greater.

those, i said, which are narrated by homer and hesiod, and the rest of
the poets, who have ever been the great story-tellers of mankind.

but which stories do you mean, he said; and what fault do you find with
them?

a fault which is most serious, i said; the fault of telling a lie, and,
what is more, a bad lie.

but when is this fault committed?

whenever an erroneous representation is made of

is unholy, and that never up to this time has there been any quarrel
between citizens; this is what old men and old women should begin by

to compose for them in a similar spirit. but the narrative of hephaestus
binding here his mother, or how on another occasion zeus sent him flying
for taking her part when she was being beaten, and all the battles of
the gods in homer--these tales must not be admitted into our state,
whether they are supposed to have an allegorical meaning or not. for
a young person cannot judge what is allegorical and what is literal;
anything that he receives into his mind at that age is likely to become
indelible and unalterable; and therefore it i

tate, which not long ago we termed luxurious.

and we have done wisely, he replied.

then let us now finish the purgation, i said. next in order to
harmonies, rhythms will naturally follow, and they should be subject to
the same rules, for we ought not to seek out complex systems of metre,
or metres of every kind, but rather to discover what rhythms are the
expressions of a courageous and harmonious life; and when we have found
them, we shall adapt the foot and the melody to words having a like
spirit, not the words to the foot and melody. to say what these rhythms
are will be your duty--you must teach me them, as you have already
taught me the harmonies.

but, indeed, he replied, i cannot tell you. i only know that there
are some three principles of rhythm out of which metrical systems are
framed, just as in sounds there are four notes (i.e. the four notes of
the tetrachord.) out of which all the harmonies are composed; that is
an observation which i have made. but of what sort of lives the

most assuredly.

and when a beautiful soul harmonizes with a beautiful form, and the two
are cast in one mould, that will be the fairest of sights to him who has
an eye to see it?

the fairest indeed.

and the fairest is also the loveliest?

that may be assumed.

and the man who has the spirit of harmony will be most in love with the
loveliest; but he will not love him who is of an inharmonious soul?

that is true, he replied, if the deficiency be in his soul; but if there
be any merely bodily defect in another he will be patient of it, and
will love all the same.

i perceive, i said, that you have or have had experiences of this sort,
and i agree. but let me ask you another question: has excess of pleasure
any affinity to temperance?

how can that be? he replied; pleasure deprives a

that is clearly the best thing both for the patients and for the state.

and thus our youth, having been educated only in that simple music
which, as we said, inspires temperance, will be reluctant to go to law.

clearly.

and the musician, who, keeping to the same track, is content to practise
the simple gymnastic, will have nothing to do with medicine unless in
some extreme case.

that i quite believe.

the very exercises and tolls which he undergoes are intended to
stimulate the spirited element of his nature, and not to increase his
strength; he will not, like common athletes, use exercise and regimen to
develope his muscles.

very right, he said.

neither are the two arts of music and gymnastic really designed, as is
often supposed, the one for the training of the soul, the other for the
training of the body.

what then is the real object of them?

i believe, i said, that the teachers of both have in view chiefly the
improvement of the soul.

how can that be? he asked.

did

 you never observe, i said, the effect on the mind itself of
exclusive devotion to gymnastic, or the opposite effect of an exclusive
devotion to music?

in what way shown? he said.

the one producing a temper of hardness and ferocity, the other of
softness and effeminacy, i replied.

yes, he said, i am quite aware that the mere athlete becomes too much of
a savage, and that the mere musician is melted and softened beyond what
is good for him.

yet surely, i said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is
liable to become hard and brutal.

that i quite think.

on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.
and this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if
educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.

true.

and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?

assuredly.

and both should be in harmony?

beyond question.

and the harmonious soul is both t

emperate and courageous?

yes.

and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?

very true.

and, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul
through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs
of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in
warbling and the delights of song; in the first stage of the process
the passion or spirit which is in him is tempered like iron, and made
useful, instead of brittle and useless. but, if he carries on the
softening and soothing process, in the next stage he begins to melt and
waste, until he has wasted away his spirit and cut out the sinews of his
soul; and he becomes a feeble warrior.

very true.

if the element of spirit is naturally weak in him the change is speedily
accomplished, but if he have a good deal, then the power of music
weakening the spirit renders him excitable;--on t

exactly.

and so in gymnastics, if a man takes violent exercise and is a great
feeder, and the reverse of a great student of music and philosophy, at
first the high condition of his body fills him with pride and spirit,
and he becomes twice the man that he was.

certainly.

and what happens? if he do nothing else, and holds no converse with the
muses, does not even that intelligence which there may be in him, having
no taste of any sort of learning or enquiry or thought or culture,
grow feeble and dull and blind, his mind never waking up or receiving
nourishment, and his senses not being purged of their mists?

true, he said.

and he ends by becoming a hater of philosophy, uncivilized, never using

of persuasion,--he is like a wild beast, all violence and
fierceness, and knows no other way of dealing; and he lives in all
ignorance and evil conditions, and has no sense of propriety and grace.

that is quite true, he said.

and as there are two principles of human nature, one the spirited
and the other the philosophical, some god, as i should say, has given
mankind two arts answering to them (and only indirectly to the soul
and body), in order that these two principles (like the strings of
an instrument) may be relaxed or drawn tighter until they are duly
harmonized.

that appears to be the intention.

and he who mingles music with gymnastic in the fairest proportions, and
best attempers them to the soul, may be rightly called the true musician

him;--he says that when modes of music change, the
fundamental laws of the state always change with them.

yes, said adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to damon's and your
own.

then, i said, our guardians must lay the foundations of their fortress
in music?

yes, he said; the lawlessness of which you speak too easily steals in.

yes, i replied, in the form of amusement; and at first sight it appears
harmless.

why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by
little this spirit of licence, finding a home, imperceptibly penetrates
into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades
contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and
constitutions, in utter recklessness, ending at last, socrates, by an
overthrow of all rights, private as well as public.

is that true? i said.

that is my belief, he replied.

then, as i was saying, our youth should be trained from the first in
a stricter system, for if amusements become lawless, and

solution not below the level of the previous enquiry.

may we not be satisfied with that? he said;--under the circumstances, i
am quite content.

i too, i replied, shall be extremely well satisfied.

then faint not in pursuing the speculation, he said.

must we not acknowledge, i said, that in each of us there are the same
principles and habits which there are in the state; and that from the
individual they pass into the state?--how else can they come there? take
the quality of passion or spirit;--it would be ridiculous to imagine
that this quality, when found in states, is not derived from the
individuals who are supposed to possess it, e.g. the thracians,
scythians, and in general the northern nations; and the same may be said
of the love of knowledge, which is the special characteristic of our
part of the world, or of the love of money, which may, with equal truth,
be attributed to the phoenicians and egyptians.

exactly so, he said.

there is no difficulty in understanding this.

n

 that they are two, and that they differ from
one another; the one with which a man reasons, we may call the rational
principle of the soul, the other, with which he loves and hungers and
thirsts and feels the flutterings of any other desire, may be termed
the irrational or appetitive, the ally of sundry pleasures and
satisfactions?

yes, he said, we may fairly assume them to be different.

then let us finally determine that there are two principles existing in
the soul. and what of passion, or spirit? is it a third, or akin to one
of the preceding?

i should be inclined to say--akin to desire.

well, i said, there is a story which i remember to have heard, and in
which i put faith. the story is, that leontius, the son of aglaion,
coming up one day from the piraeus, under the north wall on the outside,
observed some dead bodies lying on the ground at the place of execution.
he felt a desire to see them, and also a dread and abhorrence of them;
for a time he struggled and covered his eyes, bu
 
 ___________________________
 
k, ye wretches, take your fill of the fair sight.

i have heard the story myself, he said.

the moral of the tale is, that anger at times goes to war with desire,
as though they were two distinct things.

yes; that is the meaning, he said.

and are there not many other cases in which we observe that when a man's
desires violently prevail over his reason, he reviles himself, and is
angry at the violence within him, and that in this struggle, which is
like the struggle of factions in a state, his spirit is on the side of
his reason;--but for the passionate or spirited element to take part
with the desires when reason decides that she should not be opposed,
is a sort of thing which i believe that you never observed occurring in
yourself, nor, as i should imagine, in any one else?

certainly not.

suppose that a man thinks he has done a wrong to another, the nobler
he is the less able is he to feel indignant at any suffering, such as
hunger, or cold, or any other pain which the injured person ma

y inflict
upon him--these he deems to be just, and, as i say, his anger refuses to
be excited by them.

true, he said.

but when he thinks that he is the sufferer of the wrong, then he boils
and chafes, and is on the side of what he believes to be justice; and
because he suffers hunger or cold or other pain he is only the more
determined to persevere and conquer. his noble spirit will not be
quelled until he either slays or is slain; or until he hears the voice
of the shepherd, that is, reason, bidding his dog bark no more.

the illustration is perfect, he replied; and in our state, as we were
saying, the auxiliaries were to be dogs, and to hear the voice of the
rulers, who are their shepherds.

i perceive, i said, that you quite understand me; there is, however, a
further point which i wish you to consider.

what point?

you remember that passion or spirit appeared at 
 
 ___________________________
 
first sight to be a kind
of desire, but now we should say quite the contrary; for in the conflict
of the soul spirit is arrayed on the side of the rational principle.

most assuredly.

but a further question arises: is passion different from reason also, or
only a kind of reason; in which latter case, instead of three principles
in the soul, there will only be two, the rational and the concupiscent;
or rather, as the state was composed of three classes, traders,
auxiliaries, counsellors, so may there not be in the individual soul a
third element which is passion or spirit, and when not corrupted by bad
educat
 
 ___________________________
 
ion is the natural auxiliary of reason?

yes, he said, there must be a third.

yes, i replied, if passion, which has already been shown to be different
from desire, turn out also to be different from reason.

but that is easily proved:--we may observe even in young children that
they are full of spirit almost as soon as they are born, whereas some
of them never seem to attain to the use of reason, and most of them late
enough.

excellent, i said, and you may see passion equally in brute animals,
which is a further proof of the truth of what you are saying. and we may
once more appeal to the words of homer, which have been already quoted
by us,

'he smote his breast, and thus rebuked his soul,'

for in this verse homer has clearly supposed the power which reasons
about the better and worse to 
 
 ___________________________
 
llows, of course.

we cannot but remember that the justice of the state consisted in each
of the three classes doing the work of its own class?

we are not very likely to have forgotten, he said.

we must recollect that the individual in whom the several qualities of
his nature do their own work will be just, and will do his own work?

yes, he said, we must remember that too.

and ought not the rational principle, which is wise, and has the care of
the whole soul, to rule, and the passionate or spirited principle to be
the subject and ally?

certainly.

and, as we were saying, the united influence of music and gymnastic will
bring them into accord, nerving and sustaining the reason with noble
words and lessons, and moderating and soothing and civilizing the
wildness of passion by harmony and rhythm?

quite true, he said.

and these two, thus nurtured and educated, and having learned truly to
know their own functions, will rule over the concupiscent, which in each
of us is the largest part of
 
 ___________________________
 
as they are termed, the concupiscent
soul, no longer confined to her own sphere, should attempt to enslave
and rule those who are not her natural-born subjects, and overturn the
whole life of man?

very true, he said.

both together will they not be the best defenders of the whole soul and
the whole body against attacks from without; the one counselling, and
the other fighting under his leader, and courageously executing his
commands and counsels?

true.

and he is to be deemed courageous whose spirit retains in pleasure and
in pain the commands of reason about what he ought or ought not to fear?

right, he replied.

and him we call wise who has in him that little part which rules, and
which proclaims these commands; that part too being supposed to have a
knowledge of what is for the interest of each of the three parts and of
the whole?

assuredly.

and would you not say that he is temperate who has these same elements
in friendly harmony, in whom the one ruling principle of reason, and
the 
 
 ___________________________
 
two subject ones of spirit and desire are equally agreed that reason
ought to rule, and do not rebel?

certainly, he said, that is the true account of temperance whether in
the state or individual.

and surely, i said, we have explained again and again how and by virtue
of what quality a man will be just.

that is very certain.

and is justice dimmer in the individual, and is her form different, or
is she the same which we found her to be in the state?

there is no difference in my opinion, he said.

because, if any doub

 saying?--that different natures ought to have the same
pursuits,--this is the inconsistency which is charged upon us.

precisely.

verily, glaucon, i said, glorious is the power of the art of
contradiction!

why do you say so?

because i think that many a man falls into the practice against his
will. when he thinks that he is reasoning he is really disputing, just
because he cannot define and divide, and so know that of which he is
speaking; and he will pursue a merely verbal opposition in the spirit of
contention and not of fair discussion.

yes, he replied, such is very often the case; but what has that to do
with us and our argument?

a great deal; for there is certainly a danger of our getting
unintentionally into a verbal opposition.

in what way?

why we valiantly and pugnaciously insist upon the verbal truth, that
different natures ought to have different pursuits, but we never
considered at all what was the meaning of sameness or difference of
nature, or why we distinguished them wh

suits of women
also, but in all of them a woman is inferior to a man.

very true.

then are we to impose all our enactments on men and none of them on
women?

that will never do.

one woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and
another has no music in her nature?

very true.

and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and
another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?

certainly.

and one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;
one has spirit, and another is without spirit?

that is also true.

then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. was
not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of
this sort?

yes.

men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they
differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.

obviously.

and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the
companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom
they resemble

enefit
to the state and to the guardians. first of all, then, if you have no
objection, i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of
the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.

i have no objection; proceed.

first, i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy
of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the
one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves
obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any
details which are entrusted to their care.

that is right, he said.

you, i said, who are their legislator, having selected the men, will now
select the women and give them to them;--they must be as far as possible
of like natures with them; and they must live in common houses and meet
at common meals. none of them will have anything specially his or her
own; they will be together, and will be brought up together, and
will associate at gymnastic exercises. and so they will be dra

 these duties to be regarded as an
impious and unrighteous person who is not likely to receive much good
either at the hands of god or of man? are these to be or not to be the
strains which the children will hear repeated in their ears by all the
citizens about those who are intimated to them to be their parents and
the rest of their kinsfolk?

these, he said, and none other; for what can be more ridiculous than for
them to utter the names of family ties with the lips only and not to act
in the spirit of them?

then in our city the language of harmony and concord will be more often
heard than in any other. as i was describing before, when any one is
well or ill, the universal word will be 'with me it is well' or 'it is
ill.'

most true.

and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?

yes, and so they will.

and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will
alike call 'my own,' and having t

very properly.

still, the dangers of war cannot be always foreseen; there is a good
deal of chance about them?

true.

then against such chances the children must be at once furnished with
wings, in order that in the hour of need they may fly away and escape.

what do you mean? he said.

i mean that we must mount them on horses in their earliest youth, and
when they have learnt to ride, take them on horseback to see war: the
horses must not be spirited and warlike, but the most tractable and yet
the swiftest that can be had. in this way they will get an excellent
view of what is hereafter to be their own business; and if there is
danger they have only to follow their elder leaders and escape.

i believe that you are right, he said.

next, as to war; what are to be the relations of your soldiers to one
another and to their enemies? i should be inclined to propose that the
soldier who leaves his rank or throws away his arms, or is guilty of a

e.

certainly, he replied.

i think, i said, that there might be a reform of the state if only one
change were made, which is not a slight or easy though still a possible
one.

what is it? he said.

now then, i said, i go to meet that which i liken to the greatest of
the waves; yet shall the word be spoken, even though the wave break and
drown me in laughter and dishonour; and do you mark my words.

proceed.

i said: 'until philosophers are kings, or the kings and princes of this
world have the spirit and power of philosophy, and political greatness
and wisdom meet in one, and those commoner natures who pursue either
to the exclusion of the other are compelled to stand aside, cities
will never have rest from their evils,--nor the human race, as i
believe,--and then only will this our state have a possibility of life
and behold the light of day.' such was the thought, my dear glaucon,
which i would fain have uttered if it had not seemed too extravagant;
for to be convinced that in no other st

imate or soil,
in proportion to their vigour, are all the more sensitive to the want of
a suitable environment, for evil is a greater enemy to what is good than
to what is not.

very true.

there is reason in supposing that the finest natures, when under alien
conditions, receive more injury than the inferior, because the contrast
is greater.

certainly.

and may we not say, adeimantus, that the most gifted minds, when they
are ill-educated, become pre-eminently bad? do not great crimes and
the spirit of pure evil spring out of a fulness of nature ruined by
education rather than from any inferiority, whereas weak natures are
scarcely capable of any very great good or very great evil?

there i think that you are right.

and our philosopher follows the same analogy--he is like a plant which,
having proper nurture, must necessarily grow and mature into all virtue,
but, if sown and planted in an alien soil, becomes the most noxious of
all weeds, unless he be preserved by some divine power. do yo

e so ordered as not to be
the ruin of the state: all great attempts are attended with risk; 'hard
is the good,' as men say.

still, he said, let the point be cleared up, and the enquiry will then
be complete.

i shall not be hindered, i said, by any want of will, but, if at all,
by a want of power: my zeal you may see for yourselves; and please to
remark in what i am about to say how boldly and unhesitatingly i declare
that states should pursue philosophy, not as they do now, but in a
different spirit.

in what manner?

at present, i said, the students of philosophy are quite young;
beginning when they are hardly past childhood, they devote only the time
saved from moneymaking and housekeeping to such pursuits; and even those
of them who are reputed to have most of the philosophic spirit, when
they come within sight of the great difficulty of the subject, i mean
dialectic, take themselves off. in after life when invited by some one
else, they may, perhaps, go and hear a lecture, and about th

of the state, we are ready to assert to the
death, that this our constitution has been, and is--yea, and will be
whenever the muse of philosophy is queen. there is no impossibility in
all this; that there is a difficulty, we acknowledge ourselves.

my opinion agrees with yours, he said.

but do you mean to say that this is not the opinion of the multitude?

i should imagine not, he replied.

o my friend, i said, do not attack the multitude: they will change their
minds, if, not in an aggressive spirit, but gently and with the view
of soothing them and removing their dislike of over-education, you show
them your philosophers as they really are and describe as you were just
now doing their character and profession, and then mankind will see that
he of whom you are speaking is not such as they supposed--if they view
him in this new light, they will surely change their notion of him, and
answer in another strain. who can be at enmity with one who loves them,
who that is himself gentle and free f

e dare to say--that the perfect guardian must be a
philosopher.

yes, he said, let that be affirmed.

and do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which
were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly
found in shreds and patches.

what do you mean? he said.

you are aware, i replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,
cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that
persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and
magnanimous are not so constituted by nature as to live orderly and in a
peaceful and settled manner; they are driven any way by their impulses,
and all solid principle goes out of them.

very true, he said.

on the other hand, those steadfast natures which can better be depended
upon, which in a battle are impregnable to fear and immovable, are
equally immovable when there is anything to be learned; they are
always in a torpid state, and are apt to yawn and go to sleep over any

wherefore each of you, when his turn comes, must go down to the general
underground abode, and get the habit of seeing in the dark. when you
have acquired the habit, you will see ten thousand times better than the
inhabitants of the den, and you will know what the several images are,
and what they represent, because you have seen the beautiful and just
and good in their truth. and thus our state, which is also yours, will
be a reality, and not a dream only, and will be administered in a spirit
unlike that of other states, in which men fight with one another about
shadows only and are distracted in the struggle for power, which in
their eyes is a great good. whereas the truth is that the state in which
the rulers are most reluctant to govern is always the best and most
quietly governed, and the state in which they are most eager, the worst.

quite true, he replied.

and will our pupils, when they hear this, refuse to take their turn at
the toils of state, when they are allowed to spen

herself; and because this will be the easiest way for her to pass from
becoming to truth and being.

that is excellent, he said.

yes, i said, and now having spoken of it, i must add how charming the
science is! and in how many ways it conduces to our desired end, if
pursued in the spirit of a philosopher, and not of a shopkeeper!

how do you mean?

i mean, as i was saying, that arithmetic has a very great and elevating
effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and
rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into
the argument. you know how steadily the masters of the art repel and
ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is
calculating, and if you divide, they multiply (meaning either (1)

nd extending and applying and the
like--they confuse the necessities of geometry with those of daily life;
whereas knowledge is the real object of the whole science.

certainly, he said.

then must not a further admission be made?

what admission?

that the knowledge at which geometry aims is knowledge of the eternal,
and not of aught perishing and transient.

that, he replied, may be readily allowed, and is true.

then, my noble friend, geometry will draw the soul towards truth,
and create the spirit of philosophy, and raise up that which is now
unhappily allowed to fall down.

nothing will be more likely to have such an effect.

then nothing should be more sternly laid down than that the inhabitants
of your fair city should by all means learn geometry. moreover the
science has indirect effects, which are not small.

of what kind? he said.

there are the military advantages of which you spoke, i said; and in all
departments of knowledge, as experience proves, any one who has studied

ed you by my hurry; the ludicrous state of solid
geometry, which, in natural order, should have followed, made me pass
over this branch and go on to astronomy, or motion of solids.

true, he said.

then assuming that the science now omitted would come into existence
if encouraged by the state, let us go on to astronomy, which will be
fourth.

the right order, he replied. and now, socrates, as you rebuked the
vulgar manner in which i praised astronomy before, my praise shall
be given in your own spirit. for every one, as i think, must see that
astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world
to another.

every one but myself, i said; to every one else this may be clear, but
not to me.

and what then would you say?

i should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy
appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.

what do you mean? he asked.

you, i replied, have in your mind a truly sublime conception of our
knowledge of the things above. and i

enquire about harmony.
for they too are in error, like the astronomers; they investigate the
numbers of the harmonies which are heard, but they never attain to
problems--that is to say, they never reach the natural harmonies of
number, or reflect why some numbers are harmonious and others not.

that, he said, is a thing of more than mortal knowledge.

a thing, i replied, which i would rather call useful; that is, if sought
after with a view to the beautiful and good; but if pursued in any other
spirit, useless.

very true, he said.

now, when all these studies reach the point of inter-communion and
connection with one another, and come to be considered in their mutual
affinities, then, i think, but not till then, will the pursuit of them
have a value for our objects; otherwise there is no profit in them.

i suspect so; but you are speaking, socrates, of a vast work.

what do you mean? i said; the prelude or what? do you not know that all
this is but the prelude to the actual strain which we

n this way: you know that there are certain principles about justice
and honour, which were taught us in childhood, and under their parental
authority we have been brought up, obeying and honouring them.

that is true.

there are also opposite maxims and habits of pleasure which flatter and
attract the soul, but do not influence those of us who have any sense of
right, and they continue to obey and honour the maxims of their fathers.

true.

now, when a man is in this state, and the questioning spirit asks what
is fair or honourable, and he answers as the legislator has taught him,
and then arguments many and diverse refute his words, until he is driven
into believing that nothing is honourable any more than dishonourable,
or just and good any more than the reverse, and so of all the notions
which he most valued, do you think that he will still honour and obey
them as before?

impossible.

and when he ceases to think them honourable and natural as heretofore,

not by gentle influences but by force, for they have neglected her
who is the true muse, the companion of reason and philosophy, and have
honoured gymnastic more than music.

undoubtedly, he said, the form of government which you describe is a
mixture of good and evil.

why, there is a mixture, i said; but one thing, and one thing only, is
predominantly seen,--the spirit of contention and ambition; and these
are due to the prevalence of the passionate or spirited element.

assuredly, he said.

such is the origin and such the character of this state, which has been
described in outline only; the more perfect execution was not required,
for a sketch is enough to show the type of the most perfectly just and
most perfectly unjust; and to go through all the states and all the
characters of men, omitting none of them, would be an interminable
labour.

very true, he r

eplied.

now what man answers to this form of government-how did he come into
being, and what is he like?

i think, said adeimantus, that in the spirit of contention which
characterises him, he is not unlike our friend glaucon.

perhaps, i said, he may be like him in that one point; but there are
other respects in which he is very different.

in what respects?

he should have more of self-assertion and be less cultivated, and yet
a friend of culture; and he should be a good listener, but no speaker.
such a person is apt to be rough with slaves, unlike the educated man,
who is too proud for that; and he will also be courteous to freemen, and

fear has taught him to knock ambition and passion headforemost from his

and miserly savings and hard work gets a fortune together. is not such
an one likely to seat the concupiscent and covetous element on the
vacant throne and to suffer it to play the great king within him, girt
with tiara and chain and scimitar?

most true, he replied.

and when he has made reason and spirit sit down on the ground obediently
on either side of their sovereign, and taught them to know their place,
he compels the one to think only of how lesser sums may be turned into
larger ones, and will not allow the other to worship and admire anything
but riches and rich men, or to be ambitious of anything so much as the
acquisition of wealth and the means of acquiring it.

of all changes, he said, there is none so speedy or so sure as the
conversion of the ambitious youth into the avaricious one

arise? is it not on this wise?--the good at which such a state aims is
to become as rich as possible, a desire which is insatiable?

what then?

the rulers, being aware that their power rests upon their wealth, refuse
to curtail by law the extravagance of the spendthrift youth because
they gain by their ruin; they take interest from them and buy up their
estates and thus increase their own wealth and importance?

to be sure.

there can be no doubt that the love of wealth and the spirit of
moderation cannot exist together in citizens of the same state to any
considerable extent; one or the other will be disregarded.

that is tolerably clear.

and in oligarchical states, from the general spread of carelessness and
extravagance, men of good family have often been reduced to beggary?

yes, often.

and still they remain in the city; there they are, ready to sting and
fully armed, and some of them owe money, some have forfeited their
citizenship; a third class are in both predicame

a way of life which for the moment is supremely delightful?

for the moment, yes.

and is not their humanity to the condemned in some cases quite charming?
have you not observed how, in a democracy, many persons, although they
have been sentenced to death or exile, just stay where they are and walk
about the world--the gentleman parades like a hero, and nobody sees or
cares?

yes, he replied, many and many a one.

see too, i said, the forgiving spirit of democracy, and the 'don't
care' about trifles, and the disregard which she shows of all the fine
principles which we solemnly laid down at the foundation of the city--as
when we said that, except in the case of some rarely gifted nature,
there never will be a good man who has not from his childhood been used
to play amid things of beauty and make of them a joy and a study--how
grandly does she trample all these fine notions of ours under her feet,
never giving a thought to the pursuits which

yes, she is of a noble spirit.

these and other kindred characteristics are proper to democracy, which
is a charming form of government, full of variety and disorder, and
dispensing a sort of equality to equals and unequals alike.

we know her well.

consider now, i said, what manner of man the individual is, or rather
consider, as in the case of the state, how he comes into being.

very good, he said.

is not this the way--he is the son of the miserly and oligarchical
father who has trained him in his own habits?

exactly.

thin him, that which is akin and alike again
helping that which is akin and alike?

certainly.

and if there be any ally which aids the oligarchical principle within
him, whether the influence of a father or of kindred, advising or
rebuking him, then there arises in his soul a faction and an opposite
faction, and he goes to war with himself.

it must be so.

and there are times when the democratical principle gives way to the
oligarchical, and some of his desires die, and others are banished;
a spirit of reverence enters into the young man's soul and order is
restored.

yes, he said, that sometimes happens.

and then, again, after the old desires have been driven out, fresh ones
spring up, which are akin to them, and because he their father does not
know how to educate them, wax fierce and numerous.

yes, he said, that is apt to be the way.

they draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse with
them, breed and multiply in him.

them forth until he has purged away temperance and brought in madness to

yes, he said, that is the way in which the tyrannical man is generated.

and is not this the reason why of old love has been called a tyrant?

i should not wonder.

further, i said, has not a drunken man also the spirit of a tyrant?

he has.

and you know that a man who is deranged and not right in his mind, will
fancy that he is able to rule, not only over men, but also over the
gods?

that he will.

and the tyrannical man in the true sense of the word comes into being
when, either under the influence of nature, or habit, or both, he
becomes drunken, lustful, passionate? o my friend, is not that so?

assuredly.

such is the man and such is his origin. and next, how does he live?

their pleasures are mixed with pains--how can they be otherwise? for
they are mere shadows and pictures of the true, and are coloured by
contrast, which exaggerates both light and shade, and so they implant
in the minds of fools insane desires of themselves; and they are fought
about as stesichorus says that the greeks fought about the shadow of
helen at troy in ignorance of the truth.

something of that sort must inevitably happen.

and must not the like happen with the spirited or passionate element
of the soul? will not the passionate man who carries his passion into
action, be in the like case, whether he is envious and ambitious, or
violent and contentious, or angry and discontented, if he be seeking
to attain honour and victory and the satisfaction of his anger without
reason or sense?

yes, he said, the same will happen with the spirited element also.

clearly.

and men are blamed for pride and bad temper when the lion and serpent
element in them disproportionately grows and gains strength?

yes.

and luxury and softness are blamed, because they relax and weaken this
same creature, and make a coward of him?

very true.

and is not a man reproached for flattery and meanness who subordinates
the spirited animal to the unruly monster, and, for the sake of money,
of which he can never have enough, habituates him in the days of his
youth to be trampled in the mire, and from being a lion to become a
monkey?

true, he said.

and why are mean employments and manual arts a reproach? only because
they imply a natural weakness of the higher principle; the individual is
unable to control the creatures within him, but has to court them, and
his great study is how to flatter them.

hen she appears in homer?

yes, indeed, i am greatly charmed.

shall i propose, then, that she be allowed to return from exile, but
upon this condition only--that she make a defence of herself in lyrical
or some other metre?

certainly.

and we may further grant to those of her defenders who are lovers of
poetry and yet not poets the permission to speak in prose on her behalf:
let them show not only that she is pleasant but also useful to states
and to human life, and we will listen in a kindly spirit; for if this
can be proved we shall surely be the gainers--i mean, if there is a use
in poetry as well as a delight?

certainly, he said, we shall be the gainers.

if her defence fails, then, my dear friend, like other persons who are
enamoured of something, but put a restraint upon themselves when they
think their desires are opposed to their interests, so too must we after
the manner of lovers give her up, though not without a struggle. we too
are inspired by that love of poetry which the edu

guilty of any other evil behaviour, for each and all of their offences
they received punishment ten times over, and the rewards of beneficence
and justice and holiness were in the same proportion. i need hardly
repeat what he said concerning young children dying almost as soon
as they were born. of piety and impiety to gods and parents, and of
murderers, there were retributions other and greater far which he
described. he mentioned that he was present when one of the spirits
asked another, 'where is ardiaeus the great?' (now this ardiaeus lived
a thousand years before the time of er: he had been the tyrant of
some city of pamphylia, and had murdered his aged father and his elder
brother, and was said to have committed many other abominable crimes.)
the answer of the other spirit was: 'he comes not hither and will never
come. and this,' said he, 'was one of the dreadful sights which we
ourselves witnessed. we were at the mouth of the cavern, and, having
completed a

 side, carding them on thorns like wool, and declaring
to the passers-by what were their crimes, and that they were being taken
away to be cast into hell.' and of all the many terrors which they had
endured, he said that there was none like the terror which each of them
felt at that moment, lest they should hear the voice; and when there was
silence, one by one they ascended with exceeding joy. these, said er,
were the penalties and retributions, and there were blessings as great.

now when the spirits which were in the meadow had tarried seven days,
on the eighth they were obliged to proceed on their journey, and, on the
fourth day after, he said that they came to a place where they could
see from above a line of light, straight as a column, extending right
through the whole heaven and through the earth, in colour resembling the
rainbow, only brighter and purer; another day's journey brought them to
the place, and there, in the midst of the light, they saw the ends of
the chains of heaven l

and atropos, who accompany with their voices the harmony of the
sirens--lachesis singing of the past, clotho of the present, atropos of

hand the revolution of the outer circle of the whorl or spindle, and
atropos with her left hand touching and guiding the inner ones, and
lachesis laying hold of either in turn, first with one hand and then
with the other.

when er and the spirits arrived, their duty was to go at once to
lachesis; but first of all there came a prophet who arranged them in
order; then he took from the knees of lachesis lots and samples of
lives, and having mounted a high pulpit, spoke as follows: 'hear the
word of lachesis, the daughter of necessity. mortal souls, behold a new
cycle of life and mortality. your genius will not be allotted to you,
but you will choose your genius; and let him who draws the first lot
have the first choice, and the life which
