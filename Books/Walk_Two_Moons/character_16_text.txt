' (that's what they called it) with a long
fringe which they repeatedly shook out of their eyes. we once had a horse
who did that.

   everybody kept touching my hair. 'don't you ever cut it?' they said. 'can
you sit on it? how do you wash it? is it naturally black, like that? do you
use conditioner?' i couldn't tell if they liked my hair or if they thought i
looked like a whang-doodle.

   they all seemed to talk quite a lot, and everyone seemed to have braces on
their teeth. one girl, mary lou finney, said the most peculiar things, like out
of the blue she would say, 'omnipotent!' or 'beef brain!' i couldn't make any
sense of it. there were japanese twins (a brother and sister), who didn't
speak at all except to say 'yes, yes,' and 'yes, yes.' there were megan and
christy who jumped up and down like parched peas, moody beth ann, and
pink-cheeked alex. there was ben who drew cartoons all day long, and a
most peculiar teacher named mr. birkway.

   and then there was phoebe winterbottom. ben

phoebe, and nearly every- one else in my new class did not have much
fondness for these creatures.

   on the first day of class, when a dignified black spider was investigating
my desk, i cupped my hands around it, carried it to the open window, and set
it outside on the ledge. mary lou finney said, 'alpha and omega, will you
look at that!' beth am. was as white as milk. all around the room, people
were acting as if i had single-handedly taken on a fire-breathing dragon.

   during that next week, if an innocent spider was crawling toward

window for a peek around the room, they said, 'sal, it's a wasp, get it!' and

, she nodded politely, she smiled a small, polite smile after
everything she said.

   it all seemed peculiar. they acted so thumpingly tidy and respectable.

   at the end of the dinner, mrs. winterbottom brought in the blackberry pie.
i ate it, even though the black- berries did not have as much flavour as they
did in bybanks, kentucky. mr. winterbottom asked phoebe who was in her
class at school. she started naming everyone, and when she got to mary lou
finney, mr. winterbottom said, 'finney? finney?' he turned to mrs.
winterbottom. 'norma, is mr. finney the one who wears blue jeans? the
one who is always throwing that football?'

   'yes george.'

   to phoebe, he said, 'is mary lou the one who goes around saying
'omnipotent!'?

   phoebe said, 'yes.'

   mrs. winterbottom said, 'i suppose - they probably don't seem - they
probably appear a bit odd-'

   mr. winterbottom said, 'norma, i wouldn't want to judge.' but he was
judging, i could tell. he didn't like the finneys, or maybe he was

   'well, gol-dang, i was only asking--'

   'seems to me,' gram said, 'you've got enough to worry about,
concentrating on these roads, without worrying about gloria.

   gramps winked at me in the rear-view mirror. 'i think our gooseberry is
jealous' he said.

   'i am not,' gram said. 'tell about peeby, chickabiddy.'

   i didn't want gram and gramps to get in a fight over gloria, so i was
happy to continue telling phoebe's story. i was at phoebe's one saturday
morning when mary lou finney called and invited us over to her house.
phoebe's father was off playing golf, and phoebe's mother had just left for
the grocery store.

   phoebe went all around the house checking to make sure that the doors and
windows were locked. her mother had already done this, but she made
phoebe promise to do it as well. 'just in case,' mrs. winterbottom had said. i
was not sure 'just in case' what - maybe in case someone had stuck in and
opened all the windows and unlocked all the doors in the fifteen

steps and on down the street. we waited until he had turned the corner

young man was going to ambush us. honestly. like i said, she has a vivid
imagination.


9. the message


   just before we reached mary lou's house, phoebe said, 'mary lou's family
is not nearly as civilized as ours.'

   'in what way?' i asked.

   'oh, you'll see,' phoebe said.

   mary lou finney and ben finney were both in our class at school. at first,
i thought mary lou and ben were sister and brother, but phoebe told me
they were cousins ben was living with mary lou's family temporarily.
apparently, there was always at least one stray relative living at the finneys
temporarily.

   it was complete pandemonium at the finneys mary lou had an older sister
and three brothers. in addition, there were her parents and ben. there were
footballs and basketballs lying all over the place, and

boys sliding down the
banister and leaping over tables and talking with their mouths full and
interrupting everyone with endless questions. phoebe took one look around
and whispered to me, 'my parents are ever so organized, but mary lou's
parents do not seem to have much control over things' phoebe could sound a
bit prissy sometimes

   mr. finney was lying in the bathtub, with all his clothes on, reading a
book. from mary lou's bedroom window i saw mrs. finney lying on top of
the garage. she had a pillow under her head. 'what's she doing?' i asked
mary lou.


   mary lou peered out the window. 'king of kings! she's taking a nap.'

   when mr. finney got out of the bathtub, he went out in the back yard and
started throwing a football around with dennis and dougie, two of mary
lou's brothers. mr. finney shouted. 'over here!' and 'thataway!' and 'way to
go!'

   the previous weekend, we had had a school sports day. parents were
watching their children

show off at gymnastics and running, and there were
even some events for the parents to do, such as the three-legged race and
pass-the-grapefruit. my father could not come, but mary lou's parents were
there and so were phoebe's

   phoebe had said, 'the games are a little childish sometimes, which is why
my parents don't usually participate.' her parents stood on the sidelines
while mr. and mrs. finney ran around shouting, 'over here!' and 'way-ta-
go!' and pouring cups of water on each other's heads. in the three-legged
race, the finneys kept falling over.

   phoebe said to me, 'i wonder if mary lou is embarrassed because of the
way her parents are acting.'

   i didn't think it was embarrassing. i thought it was nice, but i didn't say so
to phoebe. i think that deep down phoebe thought it was nice too, and she
wished her own parents would act more like the finneys. she couldn't admit

e room.

   did he actually kiss my collarbone? and if he did, why did he do that? if i
had not turned when i did, would the kiss have ended up somewhere else,
like on my mouth, for example? that was a rather chilling thought. the
more i thought about it, the more i wondered if i had imagined that it even

happened at all. maybe he merely brushed against me as he was rolling off
the bed.

   on the way home from mary lou's that day, phoebe said, 'wasn't it ever
so-so-so loud there?'

   'at the finneys?' i said.

   'yes, at the finneys' she said. 'where did you think i meant?'

   'you're just jealous' i said.

   'i am not. i'm just telling you that it seemed awfully loud over there.'

   'i didn't mind,' i said. i was thinking of something my father once said to
my mother: 'we'll fill the house up with children! we'll fill it right up to the
brim!' but they hadn't filled it up. it was just me and them, and then it was
just me and my father.

   when we got back to phoebe's house, her moth

n to you, and you alone.

   midway through the first class, mr. birkway asked if we had our summer
journals. i hadn't a clue as to what he was talking about. some of the other
students started nodding like crazy, and mr. birkway spread out his arms
and said, 'wonderful! i'm blessed!' he flung himself up and down the aisles,
receiving the journals as if they were manna from heaven. 'thank you,' he
said to each journal-giver.

   i was extensively worried. i had no journal.

   on top of mary lou finney's desk were six journals. six. mr. birkway
said. 'heavens. mercy. is it - can it be - shakespeare?' he counted the
journals. 'six! brilliant! magnificent!'


   christy and megan. two girls who had their own club called the ggp
(whatever that meant), were whispering over on the other side of the room
and casting malevolent looks in mary lou's direction. mary lou kept her
hand on top of the journals as mr. birkway reached for them. in a low voice
she said. 'i don't want you to read them.'

back, after death, as a bird or a river or a horse. she even
knew one story about an old warrior who came back as a potato.

   the next thing i knew, mr. birkway was saying, 'right phoebe? phoebe?
are you awake? you have the second report.

   'report?' phoebe said.

   'lucky you! we're letting you go second!'

   'report?'

   mr. birkway clutched his heart and said to the class, 'apparently, miss
phoebe winterbottom did not hear me explain about the reports perhaps you
can enlighten her, mr. finney.

   ben turned slowly around in his chair and cast his sparkling black eyes in
phoebe's direction. he said, 'i'm doing an oral report on prometheus this
friday. you're doing one on pandora next monday.'

   'lucky me,' phoebe muttered. mr. birkway asked me to stay after class for
a minute. phoebe sent me warning messages with her eyebrows. as
everyone else was leaving the room, phoebe said, 'i'll stay with you if you
want.'

   'why?'

   'because, sal, because.'

   'because of what?' i said.

ing around his head.'

   mary lou invited both me and phoebe to dinner that night. when phoebe
started to hedge around, mary lou said, 'your mother's in london, anyway.
your father won't mind if you come over.

   phoebe was trying madly to think of excuses, i could tell, but in the end,
she agreed. my father, when i phoned him, did not seem to mind. i knew he
wouldn't. all he said was,' 'that will be nice for you, sal. maybe i'll go eat
over at margaret's.'


25. cholesterol


   dinner at the finneys was an experience. when we arrived, mary lou's
brothers were running around like crazed animals, jumping over the
furniture and tossing footballs. mary lou's older sister, maggie, was talking
on the telephone and plucking her eyebrows at the same time. mr. finney
was cooking something in the kitchen, with the help of four-year-old
tommy phoebe whispered, 'i am not too optimistic about the possibilities of
this meal.'

   when mrs. finney straggled in the door at six o'clock, tommy and dougie
a

nd dennis tugged at various parts of her, all of them talking at once. 'look

at this' and 'mom, mom, mom.' and 'me first!' she made her way into the
kitchen, trailing all three of them like a fish hook that has snagged a tangle
of old tyres and boots and other miscellaneous rubbish. she gave mr. finney
a sloppy kiss on the lips, and he slipped a piece of cucumber into her mouth.

   mary lou and i set the table, although i think it was largely a wasted
effort. everyone descended on the table in one huge, chaotic flurry,
knocking over glasses and sending forks onto the floor and picking up plates
(which did not match, phoebe pointed out to me) and saying, 'that's my
plate. i want the daisy plate,' and, 'give me the blue one! it's my turn for the
blue plate.

   phoebe and i sat between mary lo
 
 ___________________________
 
u and ben. in the centre of the table was
a huge platter of fried chicken. phoebe said, 'chicken? fried? i can't eat fried
foods i have a sensitive stomach.' she glanced over at ben's plate. he had
taken three pieces of chicken. 'you really shouldn't eat that, ben. fried foods
are not good for you.  first of all, there's the cholesterol ...

   phoebe removed two pieces of chicken from ben's plate and put them back
on the serving platter. mr. finney coughed. mrs. finney said, 'you're not
going to eat the chicken then, phoebe?'

   phoebe smiled. 'oh, no, mrs. finney. i couldn't possibly. actually, mr.
finney shouldn't be eating it either. i don't know if you are aware of this; but
men should really be careful about their cholesterol.'

   mr. finney stared down at his chicken. mrs. finney was rolling her lips
around peculiarly. by this time, the beans had been passed to phoebe, who
examined them carefully. 'did you put butter on these beans, mrs. finney?'

   
 
 ___________________________
 
'yes, i did. is there something wrong with butter?'

   'cholesterol,' phoebe said. 'cho-les-ter-ol. in the butter.

   'ah,' mrs. finney said. 'cholesterol.' she looked at her husband. 'be
careful, dear. there's cholesterol on the beans.'

   i stared at phoebe. i am sure i was not the only one in the room who
wanted to strangle her.


   ben pushed his beans to one side of his plate. maggie picked up a bean
and examined it. when the potatoes came around, phoebe explained that she
was on a diet and could not eat starch. the rest of us looked glumly down at
our plates. there was nothing at all on phoebe's plate. mrs. finney said

. 'so
what do you eat, phoebe?'

   'my mother makes special vegetarian meals. low calorie and no
cholesterol. we eat a lot of salads and vegetables. my mother's an excellent
cook.

   she never mentioned the cholesterol in all those pies and brownies her
mother made. i wanted to jump up and say, 'phoebe's mother has
disappeared and that is why phoebe is acting like a complete donkey,' but i
didn't.

   phoebe repeated, 'a truly excellent cook.

   'marvelous' mrs. finney said.

   'do you have any unadulterated vegetables?'

   'unadulterated?' mrs. finney said.

   'it means unspoiled, without any butter or stuff added--'

   'i know what it means, phoebe,' mrs. finney said.

   'i can eat unadulterated vegetables or, if you have any red bean salad
handy, or stuffed cabbage leaves? broccoli and lentil casserole? macaroni
and cheese? vegetarian spaghetti?'

   one by one, everyone at the table turned to stare at phoebe. mrs. finney
got up from the table and wen

t into the kitchen. we heard her opening and
closing cupboards she returned to the doorway. 'muesli?' she asked phoebe.
'can you eat muesli?'

   phoebe said, 'oh, yes, i eat muesli. for breakfast.' mrs. finney disappeared
again and returned with a bowl of dried-up muesli and a bottle of milk.


   'for dinner?' phoebe asked. she gazed down at the bowl. 'i usually eat it
with yoghurt - not milk,' she said.

   mrs. finney turned to mr. finney. 'dear.' she asked, 'did you buy yoghurt
this week?' 'gosh, no, i must have forgotten. blast it! how could i forget the
yoghurt?'

   phoebe ate her dried up muesli without milk. all through dinner, i kept
thinking of bybanks and what it was like when we went to my grandparents'
house for dinner. there were always tons of people - relatives and
neighbours - and lots of confusion. it was a friendly sort of confusion, and it
was like that at the finneys tommy spilled two glasses of milk, dennis

 a migraine or a potential brain tumour.

   in my book was a picture of a tree. i drew a round head with curly hair, put
a rope around the neck, and attached it to that tree.

   it went on and on like that. i hated her that day. i didn't care how upset she
was about her mother, i really hated her, and i wanted her to leave. i
wondered if this was how my father felt when i threw all those temper
tantrums. maybe he hated me for a while.

   after dinner, we walked over to mary lou's mr. and mrs. finney were
rolling around on the front lawn in a pile of leaves with tommy and dougie,
and ben was sitting on the porch. i sat down beside him while phoebe went
looking for mary lou.

   ben said, 'phoebe's driving you crazy, isn't she?' i liked the way he looked
right in your eyes when he talked to you.

   'extensively.' i said.

   'her mother isn't really in london, is she?'

   'what makes you say that?'

   he looked a bit sad. 'i don't know. i expect phoebe is just feeling lonely.

know what came over me, but i almost reached up and touched his
face. my heart was thumping so loudly that i thought he would be able to
hear it.  i went into the house. from there, i could see out the back window.
mrs. finney had gone around the back and was climbing a ladder placed
against the garage. on the roof she took off her jacket and spread it out. a
few minutes later, mr. finney came around the back of the house and
climbed up the ladder. he took off his jacket and spread it out next to her.
he lay down on the roof and put his arm around her. he kissed her.


   on the roof in the wide-open air, they lay there kissing each other. it made
me feel peculiar. they reminded me of my parents, before the stillborn baby,
before the operation.

   ben came into the kitchen. as he reached into the cupboard for a glass, he
stopped and looked at me. again i had that odd sensation

phone. then i visualized her dial- ling the phone. i visualized our phone
number clicking through the wires. i visualized the phone ringing.

   it did not ring.

   i visualized her riding the bus back to bybanks. i visualized her walking
up the driveway. 1 visualized her opening the door.

   it did not happen.

   while i was thinking about all of this that night after phoebe and i crept
into mrs. cadaver's house, i also thought about ben. i had the sudden urge
to run over to the finneys and ask him where his own mother was, but it was
too late. the finneys would be asleep.

   instead, i lay there thinking of the poem about the traveller, and i could see
the tide rising and falling, and those horrid little white hands snatching the
traveller. how could it be normal, that traveller dying? and how could such
a thing be normal and terrible both at the same time?

   i stayed awake the whole night. i knew that if i closed my eyes, i would
see the tide and the white hands. i thoug

the day seemed to be returning to normal - until english class, that is. mr.
birkway came sailing into class carrying our journals i had forgotten all
about them. he was leaping all over the place exclaiming, 'dynamite!

unbelievable! incredible!' he said he couldn't wait to share the journals with
the class.

   mary lou finney said, 'share with the class?'

   mr. birkway said, 'not to worry! everyone has something magnificent to
say. i haven't read through every page yet, but i was so impressed that i
wanted to share some of these passages with you right away.'

   people were squirming all over the room. i was trying to remember what i
had written. mary lou leaned over to me and said, 'well, i'm not worried. i
wrote a special note in the front of mine distinctly asking him not to read
mine. mine was private.'

ping the yellow paper over it before anyone had a chance to examine the
cover for clues as to its author's identity. everyone took a deep breath. you
could see people poised nervously, waiting as tensely as if mr. birkway was
going to announce someone's execution. mr. birkway read:

   i think that betty [he changed the name, you could tell, because there was
no betty in our school] will go to hell because she always takes the lord's
name in vain. she says 'god!' every five seconds.

   mary lou finney was turning purple. 'who wrote that?' she said. 'did you,
christy? i'll bet you did.'

   christy stared down at her desk.


   'i do not say "god!" every five seconds. i do not. and i am not going to
hell.'

   mr. birkway tried to intervene. 'excuse--'

   'omnipotent,' mary lou said. 'that's what i say now i say, omnipotent!
and alpha and omega!'

   mr. birkway was desperately trying to explain what he had enjoyed about
that passage. he said that most of us are not aware that we might be u

d this passage because it
showed that even though someone might be our best friend, he or she could
still drive us crazy. beth ann turned ail the way around in her seat and sent
wicked eyebrow-messages to mary lou.

   mr. birkway flipped ahead in the same journal to another passage. he
read:

   i think jeremiah [there was certainly no jeremiah in our school] is pig-
headed ... his skin is always pink ... and his hair is always clean and shiny ...
but he is really a jerk.

   i thought mary lou finney was going to fall out of her chair. alex was
bright, bright pink. he looked at mary lou as if she had recently plunged a

red hot stake into his heart. mary lou said, 'no - i - no, it isn't what you
think-i--

   misako said, 'what is jerk?' about twenty times

   mr. birkway tried to explain that he liked this pas- sage because it showed
conflicting feelings about someone.

   'i'll say it does,' alex said.

   the bell rang. first, you could hear sighs of relief from the people whose
journal

 at
his desk. the prickly feeling travelled all the way up to my neck and then
went skipping down my spine. he did write that, but he did not write it about
me.

   mr. birkway exclaimed, 'ah, love, ah, life!' sighing, he pulled out another
journal and read:

   jane doesn't know the first thing about boys. she once asked me what
kisses taste like, so you could tell she hadn't ever kissed anyone. i told her
that they taste like chicken, and she believed me. she is so dumb sometimes.

   mary lou finney almost jumped straight out of her chair. 'you cabbage
head.' she said to beth ann. 'you beef brain.' beth ann was winding a strand
of hair around and around and around her finger. mary lou stood up. 'i did
not believe you, and i do too know what they taste like, and it isn't chicken.

   mr. birkway looked astonished at this outburst. ben drew a cartoon. it
showed two stick-figures kissing. in the air over their heads was a cartoon
bubble with a chicken inside. the chicken was saying, 'bawk, ba

38. a kiss


   phoebe was stunned and angry, but she was braver than i was. she could
watch, but i could not. i started running. i assumed that phoebe would flee
too, but i didn't look back. i tore down the street, trying to remember where
the bus stop was i did not realize i had passed it until i saw the hospital. i
ducked inside, and it was only then that i realized that phoebe was not
behind me.

   what i did next was an impulse. a hunch. i asked the receptionist if i
could see mrs. finney. she flipped through a roster. 'are you a family
member?' she said.

   'no.'


   'i'm afraid you can't go up then,' she said. 'mrs. finney is on the
psychiatric ward. it says "family only" on this list.'

   'i was looking for her son. he came here to visit her.

   'maybe they went outside. you could look out back.'

   behind the hospital was a wide, sloping lawn, bordered by flower gardens
scattered across the lawn were benches and chairs, most of them occupied
with patients and their vis
