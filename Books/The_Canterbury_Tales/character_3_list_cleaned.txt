the [CHARACTER] - 
                    [CHARACTER]s
granted papal indulgences--reprieves from penance in exchange for
charitable donations to the church. many [CHARACTER]s, including this
one, collected profits for themselves. in fact, chaucer's [CHARACTER]
excels in fraud, carrying a bag full of fake relics--for example,
he claims to have the veil of the virgin mary. the [CHARACTER] has
long, greasy, yellow hair and is beardless. these characteristics
were associated with shiftiness and gender ambiguity in chaucer's
time. the [CHARACTER] also has a gift for singing and preaching whenever
he finds himself inside a church.
