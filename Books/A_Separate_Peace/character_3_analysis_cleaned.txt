[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is, in many ways, a foil (a character whose
actions or emotions contrast with, and thereby highlight, those
of another character) to finny. also charismatic and a leader of
the devon boys, brinker wields a power comparable but opposite to
finny's. whereas finny is spontaneous, mischievous, and vibrant,
brinker is stolid and conservative, a guardian of law and order.
finny, with his anarchic spirit and innocence, comes to be associated
symbolically with the summer session at devon, with its permissive
atmosphere and warm, edenic weather. brinker, on the other hand,
with his devotion to rules and his suspicious mind, is conceptually
connected to the winter session, when the usual headmaster returns
to restore discipline, the severe weather puts a damper on the boys'
play, and the distant war intensifies, looming ever blacker on the
students' horizons.
in many ways, brinker represents the positive sense of
responsibility that comes with adulthood. when he convinces gene
to enlist in the army, gene moves toward accepting obligations and
leaving the carefree realm of childhood behind. yet brinker also
embodies the cynicism and jadedness of adolescence. he suspects
the worst of gene in contemplating his involvement in finny's fall.
only at the end of the novel does brinker fully come into maturity:
his earlier support of the war is, in many ways, as naive as finny's
insistence that the war is a big conspiracy; now however, he begins
to resent the war for its injustice and madness.
