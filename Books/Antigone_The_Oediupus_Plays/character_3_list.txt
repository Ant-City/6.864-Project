Creon - 
                	Oedipus's
brother-in-law, Creon appears more than any other character in the
three plays combined. In him more than anyone else we see the gradual
rise and fall of one man's power. Early in Oedipus the King, Creon claims
to have no desire for kingship. Yet, when he has the opportunity
to grasp power at the end of that play, Creon seems quite eager.
We learn in Oedipus at Colonus that he is willing
to fight with his nephews for this power, and in Antigone Creon
rules Thebes with a stubborn blindness that is similar to Oedipus's
rule. But Creon never has our sympathy in the way Oedipus does,
because he is bossy and bureaucratic, intent on asserting his own
authority.
