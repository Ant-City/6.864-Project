                        prologue

    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments
    of cruel war. sixty and nine that wore
    their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
    put forth toward phrygia; and their vow is made
    to ransack troy, within whose strong immures
    the ravish'd helen, menelaus' queen,
    with wanton paris sleeps-and that's the quarrel.
    to tenedos they come,
    and the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
    their war-like fraughtage. now on dardan plains
    the fresh and yet unbruised greeks do pitch
    their brave pavilions: priam's six-gated city,
    dardan, and tymbria, helias, chetas, troien,
    and antenorides, with massy staples
    and corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
    sperr up the sons of troy.

  aeneas. troilus, by menelaus.
  troilus. let paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
    paris is gor'd with menelaus' horn.
