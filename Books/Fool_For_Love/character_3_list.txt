Martin - 
      A simple, innocent, and kind man who lives in a town near May's hotel. Martin is a large man who works maintenance for places around town like the high school stadium. Martin's innocence to sexual affairs and the kind of volatile passion that May and Eddie exhibit before his entrance creates a dream-like quality to his appearance. It is as if Martin has stumbled into May and Eddie's surreal landscape and does not know why he is there or how he fits in. He is an audience to their conflicting stories and an involuntary sufferer to their verbal abuse and power struggle. Martin represents the hopeful, but dull life ahead of May if she chooses to let go of Eddie for good. He is also an unknowing competitor to Eddie. By nature Martin is uncompetitive, even offering to leave Eddie and May alone, he makes Eddie's personality appear all the more absurd and ridiculous. The play ends with Martin looking out of the window at the fiery ball of Eddie's truck. He seems like a lost traveler swept up briefly in the storm of Eddie and May's life and dropped back to the ground suddenly and alone to sort out for himself the tumult that just brushed his own, simple life for a night.
