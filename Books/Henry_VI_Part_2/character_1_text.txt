acious soueraigne

   king. welcome lord somerset: what newes from
france?
  som. that all your interest in those territories,
is vtterly bereft you: all is lost

   king. cold newes, lord somerset: but gods will be
done

   yorke. cold newes for me: for i had hope of france,
as firmely as i hope for fertile england.
thus are my blossomes blasted in the bud,
and caterpillers eate my leaues away:
but i will remedie this geare ere long,
or sell my title for a glorious graue.
enter gloucester.

  glost. all happinesse vnto my lord the king:
pardon, my liege, that i haue stay'd so long

   suff. nay gloster, know that thou art come too soone,
vnlesse thou wert more loyall then thou art:
i doe arrest thee of high treason here

   glost. well suffolke, thou shalt not see me blush,
nor change my countenance for this arrest:
a heart vnspotted, is not easily daunted.
the purest spring is not so free from mudde,
as i am cleare from treason to my soueraigne.
who can accuse me?
