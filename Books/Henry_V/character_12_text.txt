 our courage be.
god morrow brother bedford: god almightie,
there is some soule of goodnesse in things euill,
would men obseruingly distill it out.
for our bad neighbour makes vs early stirrers,
which is both healthfull, and good husbandry.
besides, they are our outward consciences,
and preachers to vs all; admonishing,
that we should dresse vs fairely for our end.
thus may we gather honey from the weed,
and make a morall of the diuell himselfe.

good morrow old sir thomas erpingham:
a good soft pillow for that good white head,
were better then a churlish turfe of france

   erping. not so my liege, this lodging likes me better,
since i may say, now lye i like a king

   king. 'tis good for men to loue their present paines,
vpon example, so the spirit is eased:
and when the mind is quickned, out of doubt
the organs, though defunct and dead before,
breake vp their drowsie graue, and newly moue
with casted slough, and fresh legeritie.
lend me thy cloake sir thom
