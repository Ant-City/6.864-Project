[CHARACTER] - 
 an alpha lecturer at the college of emotional engineering,
helmholtz is a prime example of his caste, but feels that his work
is empty and meaningless and would like to use his writing abilities
for something more meaningful. he and bernard are friends because they
find common ground in their discontent with the world state, but
helmholtz's criticisms of the world state are more philosophical
and intellectual than bernard's more petty complaints. as a result, helmholtz
often finds bernard's boastfulness and cowardice tedious.
