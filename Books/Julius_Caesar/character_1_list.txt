[CHARACTER] - 
                 a
great roman general and senator, recently returned to rome in triumph
after a successful military campaign. while his good friend brutus
worries that caesar may aspire to dictatorship over the roman republic,
caesar seems to show no such inclination, declining the crown several
times. yet while caesar may not be unduly power-hungry, he does
possess his share of flaws. he is unable to separate his public
life from his private life, and, seduced by the populace's increasing
idealization and idolization of his image, he ignores ill omens
and threats against his life, believing himself as eternal as the
north star.
