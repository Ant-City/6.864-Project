    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments
    of cruel war. sixty and nine that wore
    their crownets regal fro

    art. look you, who comes here?
  achilles. come, patroclus, i'll speak with nobody. come in with me,
    thersites.

  thersites. here is such patchery, such juggling, and such knavery.
    all the argument is a whore and a cuckold-a good quarrel to draw
    emulous factions and bleed to death upon. now the dry serpigo on
    the subject, and war and lechery confound all!

                   ajax, and calchas

  agamemnon. where is achilles?
  patroclus. within his tent; but ill-dispos'd, my lord.
  agamemnon. let it be known to him that we are here.
    he shent our messengers; and we lay by
    our appertainings, visiting of him.
    let him be told so; lest, perchance, he think
    we dare not move the question of our place
    or know not what we are.
  patroclus. i shall say so to him.
exit
  ulysses. we saw him at the opening of his tent.
    he is not sick.
  ajax. yes, lion-sic

menelaus, and calchas

  calchas. now, princes, for the service i have done,
    th' advantage of the time prompts me aloud
    to call for recompense. appear it to your mind
    that, through the sight i bear in things to come,
    i have abandon'd troy, left my possession,
    incurr'd a traitor's name, expos'd myself
    from certain and possess'd conveniences
    to doubtful fortunes, sequest'ring from me all
    that time, acquaintance, custom, and condition,
    made tame and most familiar to my nat

ure;
    and here, to do you service, am become
    as new into the world, strange, unacquainted-
    i do beseech you, as in way of taste,
    to give me now a little benefit
    out of those many regist'red in promise,
    which you say live to come in my behalf.
  agamemnon. what wouldst thou of us, troyan? make demand.
  calchas. you have a troyan prisoner call'd antenor,
    yesterday took; troy holds him very dear.
    oft have you-often have you thanks therefore-
    desir'd my cressid in right great exchange,
    whom troy hath still denied; but this antenor,
    i know, is such a wrest in their affairs
    that their negotiations all must slack
    wanting his manage; and they will almost
    give us a prince of blood, a son of priam,
    in change of him. let him be sent, great princes,
    and he shall

 buy my daughter; and her presence
    shall quite strike off all service i have done
    in most accepted pain.
  agamemnon. let diomedes bear him,
    and bring us cressid hither. calchas shall have
    what he requests of us. good diomed,
    furnish you fairly for this interchange;
    withal, bring word if hector will to-morrow
    be answer'd in his challenge. ajax is ready.
  diomedes. this shall i undertake; and 'tis a burden
    which i am proud to bear.

    with every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
  aeneas. we know each other well.
  diomedes.we do; and long to know each other worse.
  paris. this is the most despiteful'st gentle greeting
    the noblest hateful love, that e'er i heard of.
    what business, lord, so early?
  aeneas. i was sent for to the king; but why, i know not.
  paris. his purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this greek
    to calchas' house, and there to render him,
    for the enfreed antenor, the fair cressid.
    let's have your company; or, if you please,
    haste there before us. i constantly believe-
    or rather call my thought a certain knowledge-
    my brother troilus lodges there to-night.
    rouse him and give him note of our approach,
    with the whole quality wherefore; i fear
    we shall be much unwelcome.

    than c

  ajax. thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
    now crack thy lungs and split thy brazen pipe;

    out-swell the colic of puff aquilon'd.
    come, stretch thy chest, and let thy eyes spout blood:
    thou blowest for hector.           [trumpet sounds]

    he rises on the toe. that spirit of his

  agamemnon. is this the lady cressid?
  diomedes. even she.
  agamemnon. most dearly welcome to the greeks, sweet lady.
  nestor. our general doth salute you with a kiss.

    'twere better she were kiss'd in general.

    so much for nestor.

  hector. thy hand upon that match.
  agamemnon. first, all you peers of greece, go to my tent;
    there in the full convive we; afterwards,
    as hector's leisure and your bounties shall
    concur together, severally entreat him.
    beat loud the tambourines, let the trumpets blow,
    that this great soldier may his welcome know.

  troilus. my lord ulysses, tell me, i beseech you,
    in what place of the field doth calchas keep?
  ulysses. at menelaus' tent, most princely troilus.
    there diomed doth feast with him to-night,
    who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
    but gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
    on the fair cressid.
  troilus. shall i, sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
    after we part from agamemnon's tent,
    to bring me thither?
  ulysses. you shall command me, sir.
    as gentle tell me of what honour was
    this cressida in troy? had she no lover there

    that go or tarry.

    the tide whereof is now. good night, great hector.
  hector. give me your hand.
  ulysses. [aside to troilus] follow his torch; he goes to
    calchas' tent; i'll keep you company.
  troilus. sweet sir, you honour me.

  thersites. that same diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most unjust
