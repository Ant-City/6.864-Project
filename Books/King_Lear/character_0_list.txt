[CHARACTER] - 
                the
aging king of britain and the protagonist of the play. lear is used
to enjoying absolute power and to being flattered, and he does not
respond well to being contradicted or challenged. at the beginning
of the play, his values are notably hollow--he prioritizes the appearance
of love over actual devotion and wishes to maintain the power of
a king while unburdening himself of the responsibility. nevertheless,
he inspires loyalty in subjects such as gloucester, kent, cordelia, and
edgar, all of whom risk their lives for him.
