hing dismal about this northern spring, just as he knew there was something gorgeous about the fall. fall made him clinch his hands and tremble and repeat idiotic sentences to himself, and make brisk abrupt gestures of command to imaginary audiences and armies. october filled him with hope which november raised to a sort of ecstatic triumph, and in this mood the fleeting brilliant impressions of the summer at sherry island were ready grist to his mill. he became a golf champion and defeated mr. t. a. hedrick in a marvellous match played a hundred times over the fairways of his imagination, a match each detail of which he changed about untiringly--sometimes he won with almost laughable ease, sometimes he came up magnificently from behind. again, stepping from a pierce-arrow automobile, like mr. mortimer jones, he strolled frigidly into the lounge of the sherry island golf club--or perhaps, surrounded by an admiring crowd, he gave an exhibition of fancy diving from the spring-board of the club raft.

in the next he was impressed by the tremendous superiority he felt toward mr. t. a. hedrick, who was a bore and not even a good golfer any more.

then, because of a ball mr. hart lost near the fifteenth green, an enormous thing happened. while they were searching the stiff grasses of the rough there was a clear call of "fore!" from behind a hill in their rear. and as they all turned abruptly from their search a bright new ball sliced abruptly over the hill and caught mr. t. a. hedrick in the abdomen.

"by gad!" cried mr. t. a. hedrick, "they ought to put some of these crazy women off the course. it's getting to be outrageous."

"do you mind if we go through?"

"you hit me in the stomach!" declared mr. hedrick wildly.
