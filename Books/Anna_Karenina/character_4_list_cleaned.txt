ekaterina alexandrovna shcherbatskaya
([CHARACTER]) - 
                 a beautiful young woman who
is courted by both levin and vronsky, and who ultimately marries
levin. modeled on tolstoy's real-life wife, [CHARACTER] is sensitive and
perhaps a bit overprotected, shocked by some of the crude realities
of life, as we see in her horrified response to levin's private
diaries. but despite her indifference to intellectual matters, [CHARACTER]
displays great courage and compassion in the face of death when
caring for levin's dying brother nikolai.
