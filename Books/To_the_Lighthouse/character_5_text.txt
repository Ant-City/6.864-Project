own curiosity, and become what with her untrained mind she greatly
admired, an investigator, elucidating the social problem.

insoluble questions they were, it seemed to her, standing there, holding
james by the hand. he had followed her into the drawing-room, that young
man they laughed at; he was standing by the table, fidgeting with
something, awkwardly, feeling himself out of things, as she knew without
looking round. they had all gone--the children; minta doyle and paul
rayley; augustus carmichael; her husband--they had all gone. so she
turned with a sigh and said, "would it bore you to come with me,
mr. tansley?"

she had a dull errand in the town; she had a letter or two to write; she
would be ten minutes perhaps; she would put on her hat. and, with her
basket and her parasol, there she was again, ten minutes later, giving out
a sense of being ready, of being equipped for a jaunt, which, however, she
must interrupt for a moment, as they passed the t

e kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep
up, and suddenly she should find her picture looked at. but now, with all
her senses quickened as they were, looking, straining, till the colour of
the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes, she was aware of
someone coming out of the house, coming towards her; but somehow divined,
from the footfall, william bankes, so that though her brush quivered, she
did not, as she would have done had it been mr. tansley, paul rayley,
minta doyle, or practically anybody else, turn her canvas upon the grass,
but let it stand. william bankes stood beside her.

they had rooms in the village, and so, walking in, walking out, parting
late on door-mats, had said little things about the soup, about the
children, about one thing and another which made them allies; so that when
he stood beside her now in his judicial way (he was old enough to be her
father too, a botanist, a widower, smelling of soap, very scrupulous and
clean) she just stood th

essage would cam give the cook? mrs. ramsay wondered. and indeed it
was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in
the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that
mrs. ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up
mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one
waited, in a colourless singsong. shifting from foot to foot, cam
repeated the words, "no, they haven't, and i've told ellen to clear away
tea."

minta doyle and paul rayley had not come back then. that could only
mean, mrs. ramsay thought, one thing. she must accept him, or she must
refuse him. this going off after luncheon for a walk, even though
andrew was with them--what could it mean? except that she had decided,
rightly, mrs. ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of minta), to
accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought
mrs. ramsay, realising that james was tugging at her, to make her go on
reading aloud the fi

her left hand, and her mother said, "haven't they come back yet?"
whereupon the spell was broken. mr. ramsay felt free now to laugh out
loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman
rescued him on condition he said the lord's prayer, and chuckling to
himself he strolled off to his study. mrs. ramsay, bringing prue back
into throwing catches again, from which she had escaped, asked,

"did nancy go with them?"

(certainly, nancy had gone with them, since minta doyle had asked it
with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as nancy made off, after
lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family life. she
supposed she must go then. she did not want to go. she did not want to
be drawn into it all. for as they walked along the road to the cliff
minta kept on taking her hand. then she would let it go. then she
would take it again. what was it she wanted? nancy asked herself.
there was something, of course, that people wanted; for when minta took
her hand and

e, trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration,
compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn, when solidity suddenly
vanished, and such vast spaces lay between them; and now the same
effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room, and
the uncurtained windows, and the bright mask-like look of faces seen by
candlelight. some weight was taken off them; anything might happen,
she felt. they must come now, mrs. ramsay thought, looking at the door,
and at that instant, minta doyle, paul rayley, and a maid carrying a
great dish in her hands came in together. they were awfully late; they
were horribly late, minta said, as they found their way to different
ends of the table.

"i lost my brooch--my grandmother's brooch," said minta with a sound of
lamentation in her voice, and a suffusion in her large brown eyes,
looking down, looking up, as she sat by mr. ramsay, which roused his
chivalry so that he bantered her.

how could she be such a goose, he asked, as to scramble abou

 the other temperament, which
must have praise, which must have encouragement, naturally you began
(and she knew that mr. ramsay was beginning) to be uneasy; to want
somebody to say, oh, but your work will last, mr. ramsay, or something
like that. he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying, with
some irritation, that, anyhow, scott (or was it shakespeare ?) would
last him his lifetime. he said it irritably. everybody, she thought,
felt a little uncomfortable, without knowing why. then minta doyle,
whose instinct was fine, said bluffly, absurdly, that she did not
believe that any one really enjoyed reading shakespeare. mr. ramsay
said grimly (but his mind was turned away again) that very few people
liked it as much as they said they did. but, he added, there is
considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless, and mrs. ramsay
saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow; he would laugh at
minta, and she, mrs. ramsay saw, realising his extreme anxiety about
himself, would, in
