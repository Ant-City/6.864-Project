you straight.

  rom. there is thy gold- worse poison to men's souls,
    doing more murther in this loathsome world,
    than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
    i sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
    farewell. buy food and get thyself in flesh.
    come, cordial and not poison, go with me
    to juliet's grave; for there must i use thee.
                                                         exeunt.

  john. holy franciscan friar, brother, ho!

  laur. this same should be the voice of friar john.
    welcome from mantua. what says romeo?
    or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.

  john. going to find a barefoot brother out,
    one of our order, to associate me
    here in this city visiting the sick,

    suspecting that we both were in a house

e the infectious pestilence did reign,
    seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth,
    so that my speed to mantua there was stay'd.

  laur. who bare my letter, then, to romeo?

  john. i could not send it- here it is again-
    nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
    so fearful were they of infection.

  laur. unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
    the letter was not nice, but full of charge,
    of dear import; and the neglecting it
    may do much danger. friar john, go hence,
    get me an iron crow and bring it straight
    unto my cell.

  john. brother, i'll go and bring it thee.                 exit.

  laur. now, must i to the monument alone.
    within this three hours will fair juliet wake.
    she will beshrew me much that romeo
    hath had no notice of these accidents;
    but i will write again to mantua,
    and keep her at my cell till romeo come-
    poor living corse, clos'd in a dead man's tomb!        exit.

with wild looks bid me devise some mean
    to rid her from this second marriage,
    or in my cell there would she kill herself.
    then gave i her (so tutored by my art)
    a sleeping potion; which so took effect
    as i intended, for it wrought on her
    the form of death. meantime i writ to romeo
    that he should hither come as this dire night
    to help to take her from her borrowed grave,
    being the time the potion's force should cease.
    but he which bore my letter, friar john,
    was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
    return'd my letter back. then all alone
    at the prefixed hour of her waking
    came i to take her from her kindred's vault;
    meaning to keep her closely at my cell
    till i conveniently could send to romeo.
    but when i came, some minute ere the time
    of her awaking, here untimely lay
    the noble paris and true romeo dead.
    she wakes; and i entreated her come forth
    and bear this work of heaven with patience;
