he then explained to nathan the pressing cause of his journey. the rabbi
listened with interest, and testified his sympathy after the fashion of
his people, rending his clothes, and saying, “ah, my daughter!--ah, my
daughter!--alas! for the beauty of zion!--alas! for the captivity of
israel!”

“thou seest,” said isaac, “how it stands with me, and that i may not
tarry. peradventure, the presence of this lucas beaumanoir, being the
chief man over them, may turn brian de bois-guilbert from the ill which
he doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter
rebecca.”

“go thou,” said nathan ben israel, “and be wise, for wisdom availed
daniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well
with thee, even as thine heart wisheth. yet, if thou canst, keep thee
from the presence of the grand master, for to do foul scorn to our
people is his morning and evening delight. it may be i

they passed each other, if they chanced to meet, with a slow, solemn,
and mute greeting; for such was the rule of their order, quoting
thereupon the holy texts, “in many words thou shalt not avoid sin,” and
“life and death are in the power of the tongue.” in a word, the
stern ascetic rigour of the temple discipline, which had been so long
exchanged for prodigal and licentious indulgence, seemed at once to have
revived at templestowe under the severe eye of lucas beaumanoir.

isaac paused at the gate, to consider how he might seek entrance in the
manner most likely to bespeak favour; for he was well aware, that to his
unhappy race the reviving fanaticism of the order was not less dangerous
than their unprincipled licentiousness; and that his religion would be
the object of hate and persecution in the one case, as his wealth
would have exposed him in the other to the extortions of unrelenting
oppression.

meantime lucas beaumanoir walked in a small garden belonging

r been so unexpectedly sudden,
he would have seen nothing at templestowe which might have appeared to
argue any relaxation of discipline. and, even although surprised, and,
to a certain extent, detected, albert malvoisin listened with such
respect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his superior, and made
such haste to reform the particulars he censured,--succeeded, in fine,
so well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been
lately devoted to license and pleasure, that lucas beaumanoir began to
entertain a higher opinion of the preceptor’s morals, than the first
appearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.

but these favourable sentiments on the part of the grand master were
greatly shaken by the intelligence that albert had received within a
house of religion the jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the
paramour of a brother of the order; and when albert appeared before him,
he was regarded with unwonted sternness.

“there is in this mansion, dedicated

“the devil,” said the preceptor, “i think, possessed you both. how oft
have i preached to you caution, if not continence? did i not tell you
that there were enough willing christian damsels to be met with, who
would think it sin to refuse so brave a knight ‘le don d’amoureux
merci’, and you must needs anchor your affection on a wilful, obstinate
jewess! by the mass, i think old lucas beaumanoir guesses right, when he
maintains she hath cast a spell over you.”

“lucas beaumanoir!”--said bois-guilbert reproachfully--“are these your
precautions, malvoisin? hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that
rebecca is in the preceptory?”

“how could i help it?” said the preceptor. “i neglected nothing that
could keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the
devil or no, the devil only can tell. but i have turned the matter as i
could; you are safe if you renoun

“she shall not, by heaven!” said bois-guilbert.

“by heaven, she must and will!” said malvoisin. “neither you nor any
one else can save her. lucas beaumanoir hath settled that the death of
a jewess will be a sin-offering sufficient to atone for all the amorous
indulgences of the knights templars; and thou knowest he hath both the
power and will to execute so reasonable and pious a purpose.”

“will future ages believe that such stupid bigotry ever existed!” said
bois-guilbert, striding up and down the apartment.

“what they may believe, i know not,” said malvoisin, calmly; “but i know
well, that in this our day, clergy and laymen, take ni

she took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before
the grand master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which
excited universal surprise and admiration.

even lucas beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance
of rebecca. he was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but
with passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of
duty, his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he
pursued, the supreme power which he enjoyed, and the supposed necessity
of subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy, which he conceived
peculiarly incumbent on him. his features relaxed in their usual
severity as he gazed upon the beau

ned to a deserved doom?”

“say to the grand master,” replied rebecca, “that i maintain my
innocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest i become guilty
of mine own blood. say to him, that i challenge such delay as his forms
will permit, to see if god, whose opportunity is in man’s extremity,
will raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed,
may his holy will be done!” the herald retired to carry this answer to
the grand master.

“god forbid,” said lucas beaumanoir, “that jew or pagan should impeach
us of injustice!--until the shadows be cast from the west to the
eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this
unfortunate woman. when the day is so far passed, let her prepare for
death.”

the herald communicated the words of the grand master to rebecca, who
bowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards
heaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce
promise herself from man. during this awfu
