[CHARACTER] - 
      
        [CHARACTER] is not one of timon's friends, but he attends timon's feasts anyway, looking for an opportunity to scorn athenian citizens. he always scoffs at timon's greetings, promising he will never be polite to timon's friendly words. while timon's other friends receive gifts, timon withholds them from [CHARACTER] until he should choose to be more sociable. [CHARACTER] thinks timon's friends are all flatterers and false money-grubbers. when timon's luck changes, and he leaves athens, [CHARACTER] is delighted, and follows timon to the wilderness merely to remind him that his villainous friends refused to loan him money. the two insult each other heartily and seem to dislike each other, yet they form a curious bond. [CHARACTER]'s poor upbringing makes him used to suffering while timon is new to it, says timon. but they are finally in the same boat, hating mankind together. yet timon still shoos him away from his forest home.
