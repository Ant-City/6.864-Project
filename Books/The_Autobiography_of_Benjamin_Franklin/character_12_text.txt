iladelphia, advised my
return to my business; and keimer tempted me, with an offer of large
wages by the year, to come and take the management of his
printing-house, that he might better attend his stationer's shop. i
had heard a bad character of him in london from his wife and her
friends, and was not fond of having any more to do with him. i tri'd
for farther employment as a merchant's clerk; but, not readily meeting
with any, i clos'd again with keimer. i found in his house these
hands: hugh meredith, a welsh pennsylvanian, thirty years of age, bred
to country work; honest, sensible, had a great deal of solid
observation, was something of a reader, but given to drink. stephen
potts, a young countryman of full age, bred to the same, of uncommon
natural parts, and great wit and humor, but a little idle. these he
had agreed with at extream low wages per week to be rais'd a shilling
every three months, as they would deserve by improving in their
business; and the expectation of these high wages

, to come on
hereafter, was what he had drawn them in with. meredith was to work at
press, potts at book-binding, which he, by agreement, was to teach
them, though he knew neither one nor t'other. john----, a wild
irishman, brought up to no business, whose service, for four
years, keimer had purchased from the captain of a ship; he, too, was
to be made a pressman. george webb, an oxford scholar, whose time for
four years he had likewise bought, intending him for a compositor, of
whom more presently; and david harry, a country boy, whom he had taken
apprentice.

words, that nettled me the more for their publicity,
all the neighbours who were looking out on the same occasion being
witnesses how i was treated. he came up immediately into the
printing-house, continu'd the quarrel, high words pass'd on both
sides, he gave me the quarter's warning we had stipulated, expressing
a wish that he had not been oblig'd to so long a warning. i told him
his wish was unnecessary, for i would leave him that instant; and so,
taking my hat, walk'd out of doors, desiring meredith, whom i saw
below, to take care of some things i left, and bring them to my
lodgings.

meredith came accordingly in the evening, when we talked my affair
over. he had conceiv'd a great regard for me, and was very unwilling
that i should leave the house while he remain'd in it. he dissuaded me
from returning to my native country, which i began to think of; he
reminded me that keimer was in debt for all he possess'd; that his
creditors began to be uneasy; that he kept his shop miserably, sold
oft

 in the meantime i was to get
work, if i could, at the other printing-house. but i found no vacancy
there, and so remained idle a few days, when keimer, on a prospect of
being employ'd to print some paper money in new jersey, which would
require cuts and various types that i only could supply, and
apprehending bradford might engage me and get the jobb from him, sent
me a very civil message, that old friends should not part for a few
words, the effect of sudden passion, and wishing me to return.
meredith persuaded me to comply, as it would give more opportunity for
his improvement under my daily instructions; so i return'd, and we
went on more smoothly than for some time before. the new jersey jobb
was obtained, i contriv'd a copperplate press for it, the first that
had been seen in the country; i cut several ornaments and checks for
the bills. we went together to burlington, where i executed the whole
to satisfaction; and he received so large a sum for the work as to be
enabled thereby to keep

but my giving this account of it here is to show something of the
interest i had, everyone of these exerting themselves in recommending
business to us. breintnal particularly procur'd us from the quakers
the printing forty sheets of their history, the rest being to be done
by keimer; and upon this we work'd exceedingly hard, for the price was
low. it was a folio, pro patria size, in pica, with long primer
notes.[55] i compos'd of it a sheet a day, and meredith worked it off
at press; it was often eleven at night, and sometimes later, before i
had finished my distribution for the next day's work, for the little
jobbs sent in by our other friends now and then put us back. but so
determin'd i was to continue doing a sheet a day of the folio, that
one night, when, having impos'd[56] my forms, i thought my day's work
over, one of them by accident was broken, and two pages reduced to
pi,[57] i immediately distribut'd and composed it over again before i

ridicul'd, were disregarded. he began his paper, however, and, after
carrying it on three quarters of a year, with at most only ninety
subscribers, he offered it to me for a trifle; and i, having been
ready some time to go on with it, took it in hand directly; and it
prov'd in a few years extremely profitable to me.

i perceive that i am apt to speak in the singular number, though our
partnership still continu'd; the reason may be that, in fact, the
whole management of the business lay upon me. meredith was no
compositor, a poor pressman, and seldom sober. my friends lamented my
connection with him, but i was to make the best of it.

[illustration: "i see him still at work when i go home from club"]

our first papers made a quite different appearance from any before in
the province; a better type, and better printed; but some spirited
remarks of my writing, on the dispute then going on between governor
burnet and the massachusetts assembly, struck the principal people,
occasioned the paper and

    [58] i got his son once Â£500.--_marg. note_.

mr. vernon, about this time, put me in mind of the debt i ow'd him,
but did not press me. i wrote him an ingenuous letter of
acknowledgment, crav'd his forbearance a little longer, which he
allow'd me, and as soon as i was able, i paid the principal with
interest, and many thanks; so that erratum was in some degree
corrected.

but now another difficulty came upon me which i had never the least
reason to expect. mr. meredith's father, who was to have paid for our
printing-house, according to the expectations given me, was able to
advance only one hundred pounds currency, which had been paid; and a
hundred more was due to the merchant, who grew impatient, and su'd us
all. we gave bail, but saw that, if the money could not be rais'd in
time, the suit must soon come to a judgment and execution, and our
hopeful prospects must, with us, be ruined, as the press and letters
must be sold for payment, perhaps at half price.

in this distress two true friends, whose kindness i have never
forgotten, nor ever shall forget while i can remember any thing, came
to me separately, unknown to each other, and, without any application
from me, offering each of them to advance me all the money that should
be necessary to enable me to take the whole business upon myself, if
that should be practicable; but they did not like my continuing the
partnership with meredith, who, as they said, was often seen drunk in
the streets, and playing at low games in alehouses, much to our
discredit. these two friends were william coleman and robert grace. i
told them i could not propose a separation while any prospect remain'd
of the meredith's fulfilling their part of our agreement, because i
thought myself under great obligations to them for what they had done,
and would do if they could; but, if they finally fail'd in their
performance, and our partnership must be disso
