[CHARACTER] - 
                a
jewish moneylender in venice. angered by his mistreatment at the
hands of venice's christians, particularly antonio, [CHARACTER] schemes
to eke out his revenge by ruthlessly demanding as payment a pound of
antonio's flesh. although seen by the rest of the play's characters
as an inhuman monster, [CHARACTER] at times diverges from stereotype
and reveals himself to be quite human. these contradictions, and
his eloquent expressions of hatred, have earned [CHARACTER] a place
as one of shakespeare's most memorable characters.
