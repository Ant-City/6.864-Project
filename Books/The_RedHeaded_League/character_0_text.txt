the red-headed league


i had called upon my friend, mr. sherlock holmes, one day in the autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very stout, florid-faced, elderly gentleman with fiery red hair. with an apology for my intrusion, i was about to withdraw when holmes pulled me abruptly into the room and closed the door behind me.

"you could not possibly have come at a better time, my dear watson," he said cordially.

"i was afraid that you were engaged."

"so i am. very much so."

"then i can wait in the next room."

"not at all. this gentleman, m

 rather baggy gray shepherd's check trousers, a not over-clean black frock-coat, unbuttoned in the front, and a drab waistcoat with a heavy brassy albert chain, and a square pierced bit of metal dangling down as an ornament. a frayed top-hat and a faded brown overcoat with a wrinkled velvet collar lay upon a chair beside him. altogether, look as i would, there was nothing remarkable about the man save his blazing red head, and the expression of extreme chagrin and discontent upon his features.

sherlock holmes's quick eye took in my occupation, and he shook his head with a smile as he noticed my questioning glances. "beyond the obvious facts that he has at some time done manual labour, that he takes snuff, that he is a freemason, that he has been in china, and that he has done a considerable amount of writing lately, i can deduce nothing else."

mr. jabez wilson started up in his chair, with his forefinger upon the paper, but his eyes upon my companion.

"how, in the name of good-fortune, did you kno

ed and wriggled in his chair, as was his habit when in high spirits. "it is a little off the beaten track, isn't it?" said he. "and now, mr. wilson, off you go at scratch and tell us all about yourself, your household, and the effect which this advertisement had upon your fortunes. you will first make a note, doctor, of the paper and the date."

"it is the morning chronicle of april 27, 1890. just two months ago."

"very good. now, mr. wilson?"

"well, it is just as i have been telling you, mr. sherlock holmes," said jabez wilson, mopping his forehead; "i have a small pawnbroker's business at coburg square, near the city. it's not a very large affair, and of late years it has not done more than just give me a living. i used to be able to keep two assistants, but now i only keep one; and i would have a job to pay him but that he is willing to come for half wages so as to learn the business."

"what is the name of this obliging youth?" asked sherlock holmes.

"his name is vincent spaulding, and he's no

th my writings. and then suddenly the whole business came to an end."

"to an end?"

"yes, sir. and no later than this morning. i went to my work as usual at ten o'clock, but the door was shut and locked, with a little square of card-board hammered on to the middle of the panel with a tack. here it is, and you can read for yourself."

he held up a piece of white card-board about the size of a sheet of note-paper. it read in this fashion:

dissolved.

october 9, 1890.

sherlock holmes and i surveyed this curt announcement and the rueful face behind it, until the comical side of the affair so completely overtopped every other consideration that we both burst out into a roar of laughter.

"i cannot see that there is anything very funny," cried our client, flushing up to the roots of his flaming head. "if you can do nothing better than laugh at me, i can go elsewhere."

"no, no," cried holmes, shoving him back into the chair from which he had half risen. "i really wouldn't miss

singular story which we had listened to in the morning. it was a poky, little, shabby-genteel place, where four lines of dingy two-storied brick houses looked out into a small railed-in enclosure, where a lawn of weedy grass and a few clumps of faded laurel-bushes made a hard fight against a smoke-laden and uncongenial atmosphere. three gilt balls and a brown board with "jabez wilson" in white letters, upon a corner house, announced the place where our red-headed client carried on his business. sherlock holmes stopped in front of it with his head on one side and looked it all over, with his eyes shining brightly between puckered lids. then he walked slowly up the street, and then down again to the corner, still looking keenly at the houses. finally he returned to the pawnbroker's, and, having thumped vigorously upon the pavement with his stick two or three times, he went up to the door and knocked. it was instantly opened by a bright-looking, clean-shaven young fellow, who asked him to step in.

day being saturday rather complicates matters. i shall want your help to-night."

"at what time?"

"ten will be early enough."

"i shall be at baker street at ten."

"very well. and, i say, doctor, there may be some little danger, so kindly put your army revolver in your pocket." he waved his hand, turned on his heel, and disappeared in an instant among the crowd.

i trust that i am not more dense than my neighbors, but i was always oppressed with a sense of my own stupidity in my dealings with sherlock holmes. here i had heard what he had heard, i had seen what he had seen, and yet from his words it was evident that he saw clearly not only what had happened but what was about to happen, while to me the whole business was still confused and grotesque. as i drove home to my house in kensington i thought over it all, from the extraordinary story of the red-headed copier of the encyclopaedia down to the visit to saxe-coburg square, and the ominous words with which he had parted from me. what was this no

a little too theoretical and fantastic, but he has the makings of a detective in him. it is not too much to say that once or twice, as in that business of the sholto murder and the agra treasure, he has been more nearly correct than the official force."

"oh, if you say so, mr. jones, it is all right," said the stranger with deference. "still, i confess that i miss my rubber. it is the first saturday night for seven-and-twenty years that i have not had my rubber."

"i think you will find," said sherlock holmes, "that you will play for a higher stake to-night than you have ever done yet, and that the play will be more exciting. for you, mr. merryweather, the stake will be some 30,000 pounds; and for you, jones, it will be the man upon whom you wish to lay your hands."

"john clay, the murderer, thief, smasher, and forger. he's a young man, mr. merryweather, but he is at the head of his profession, and i would rather have my bracelets on him than on any criminal in london. he's a remarkable man, is you

"i hope that i may have the pleasure of introducing you to-night. i've had one or two little turns also with mr. john clay, and i agree with you that he is at the head of his profession. it is past ten, however, and quite time that we started. if you two will take the first hansom, watson and i will follow in the second."

sherlock holmes was not very communicative during the long drive and lay back in the cab humming the tunes which he had heard in the afternoon. we rattled through an endless labyrinth of gas-lit streets until we emerged into farrington street.

"we are close there now," my friend remarked. "this fellow merryweather is a bank director, and personally interested in the matter. i thought it as well to have jones with us also. he is not a bad fellow, though an absolute imbecile in his profession. he has one positi

dge there peeped a clean-cut, boyish face, which looked keenly about it, and then, with a hand on either side of the aperture, drew itself shoulder-high and waist-high, until one knee rested upon the edge. in another instant he stood at the side of the hole and was hauling after him a companion, lithe and small like himself, with a pale face and a shock of very red hair.

"it's all clear," he whispered. "have you the chisel and the bags? great scott! jump, archie, jump, and i'll swing for it!"

sherlock holmes had sprung out and seized the intruder by the collar. the other dived down the hole, and i heard the sound of rending cloth as jones clutched at his skirts. the light flashed upon the barrel of a revolver, but holmes's hunting crop came down on the man's wrist, and the pistol clinked upon the stone floor.

"it's no use, john clay," said holmes blandly. "you have no chance at all."

"so i see," the other answered with the utmost coolness. "i fancy that my pal is all right, though i see you have
