s
also the year okonkwo broke the peace, and was punished, as was
the custom, by ezeani, the priest of the earth goddess.

okonkwo was provoked to justifiable anger by his youngest wife,
who went to plait her hair at her friend's house and did not return
early enough to cook the afternoon meal. okonkwo did not know
at first that she was not at home. after waiting in vain for her dish
he went to her hut to see what she was doing. there was nobody in
the hut and the fireplace was cold.

"where is ojiugo?" he asked his second wife, who came out of her
hut to draw water from a gigantic pot in the shade of a small tree in
the middle of the compound.

"she has gone to plait her hair."

okonkwo bit his lips as anger welled up within him.



"where are her children? did she take them?" he asked with
unusual coolness and restraint.

"they are here," answered his first wife, nwoye's mother.
okonkwo bent down and looked into her hut. ojiugo's children
were eating with the children of his first wife.

"did she ask you to feed them before she went?"

"yes," lied nwoye's mother, trying to minimize ojiugo's
thoughtlessness.

okonkwo knew she was not speaking the truth. he walked back to
his obi to await ojiugo's return. and when she returned he beat her
very heavily. in his anger he had forgotten that it was the week of
peace. his first two wives ran out in great alarm pleading with him
that it was the sacred week.

but okonkwo was not the man to stop beating somebody half-way
through, not even for fear of a goddess.

okonkwo's neighbors heard his wife crying and sent their voices
over the compound walls to ask what was the matter. some of
them came over to see for themselves. it was unheard of to be

s hastily eaten and women and
children began to gather at obierika's compound to help the bride's
mother in her difficult but happy task of cooking for a whole
village.

okonkwo's family was astir like any other family in the
neighborhood. nwoye's mother and okonkwo's youngest wife
were ready to set out for obierika's compound with all their
children. nwoye's mother carried a basket of coco-yams, a cake of
salt and smoked fish which she would present to obierika's wife.
okonkwo's youngest wife, ojiugo, also had a basket of plantains
and coco-yams and a small pot of palm-oil. their children carried
pots of water.

ekwefi was tired and sleepy from the exhausting experiences of
the previous night. it was not very long since they had returned.
the priestess, with ezinma sleeping on her back, had crawled out
of the shrine on her belly like a snake. she had not as much as

walked back to the village. okonkwo and his wife followed at a
respectful distance. they thought the priestess might be going to
her house, but she went to okonkwo's compound, passed through
his obi and into ekwefi's hut and walked into her bedroom. she
placed ezinma carefully on the bed and went away without saying
a word to anybody.

ezinma was still sleeping when everyone else was astir, and
ekwefi asked nwoye's mother and ojiugo to explain to obierika's
wife that she would be late. she had got ready her basket of coco-
yams and fish, but she must wait for ezinma to wake.

"you need some sleep yourself," said nwoye's mother. "you look
very tired."

as they spoke ezinma emerged from the hut, rubbing her eyes and
stretching her spare frame. she saw the other children with their
water-pots and remembered that they were going to fetch water for
obierika's wife. she went back to the hut and brought her pot.

"have you slept

enough?" asked her mother.

"yes," she replied. "let us go."

"not before you have had your breakfast," said ekwefi. and she
went into her hut to warm the vegetable soup she had cooked last
night.

"we shall be going," said nwoye's mother. "i will tell obierika's
wife that you are coming later." and so they all went to help
obierika's wifeâ€”nwoye's mother with her four children and
ojiugo with her two.



as they trooped through okonkwo's obi he asked: "who will
prepare my afternoon meal?"



"i shall return to do it," said ojiugo.

okonkwo was also feeling tired, and sleepy, for although nobody
else knew it, he had not slept at all last night. he had felt very
anxious but did not show it. when ekwefi had followed the
priestess, he had allowed what he regarded as a reasonable and
manly interval to pass and then gone with his machete to the shrine,
where he thought they must be.

faint shadow. the rainbow was called the python of the sky.

okonkwo called his three wives and told them to get things
together for a great feast. "i must thank my mother's kinsmen
before i go," he said.

ekwefi still had some cassava left on her farm from the previous
year. neither of the other wives had. it was not that they had been



lazy, but that they had many children to feed. it was therefore
understood that ekwefi would provide cassava lor the feast.
nwoye's mother and ojiugo would provide the  other things like
smoked fish, palm-oil and pepper for the soup. okonkwo would
take care of meat and yams.



ekwefi rose early on the following morning and went to her farm
with her daughter, ezinma, and ojiugo's daughter, obiageli, to
harvest cassava tubers. each of them carried a long cane basket, a
machete for cutting down the soft cassava stem, and a little hoe for
digging out the tuber. fortunately, a light rain had fallen during the
night and the soil would not be very
