[CHARACTER]	 - 
                othello's
servant. although the [CHARACTER] appears only in two short scenes, his
appearances reflect and distort the action and words of the main
plots: his puns on the word "lie" in act iii, scene iv, for example,
anticipate othello's confusion of two meanings of that word in act
iv, scene i.
