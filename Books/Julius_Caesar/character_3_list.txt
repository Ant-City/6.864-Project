Cassius - 
                A
talented general and longtime acquaintance of Caesar. Cassius dislikes
the fact that Caesar has become godlike in the eyes of the Romans.
He slyly leads Brutus to believe that Caesar has become too powerful
and must die, finally converting Brutus to his cause by sending
him forged letters claiming that the Roman people support the death
of Caesar. Impulsive and unscrupulous, Cassius harbors no illusions
about the way the political world works. A shrewd opportunist, he
proves successful but lacks integrity.
