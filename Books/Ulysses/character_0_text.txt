mr leopold bloom ate with relish the inner organs of beasts and fowls.
he liked thick giblet soup, nutty gizzards, a stuffed roast heart,
liverslices fried with crustcrumbs, fried hencods’ roes. most of all
he liked grilled mutton kidneys which gave to his palate a fine tang of
faintly scented urine.

kidneys were in his mind as he moved about the kitchen softly, righting

piteous protest, of shy reproach under which he coloured like a girl. he
was leaning back against the rock behind. leopold bloom (for it is he)

brute he had been! at it again? a fair unsullied soul had called to him

recorded in the court directory (bloom, leopold p., m. p., p. c., k. p.,

statements of satisfaction (his grandfather having seen maria theresia,
empress of austria, queen of hungary), with commercial advice (having
taken care of pence, the pounds having taken care of themselves).
leopold bloom (aged 6) had accompanied these narrations by constant
consultation of a geographical map of europe (political) and by
