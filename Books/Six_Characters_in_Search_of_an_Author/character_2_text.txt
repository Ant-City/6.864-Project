he who is known as the father is a man of about 50: hair, reddish in colour, thin at the temples; he is not bald, however; thick moustaches, falling over his still fresh mouth, which often opens in an empty and uncertain smile. he is fattish, pale; with an especially wide forehead. he has blue, oval-shaped eyes, very clear and piercing. wears light trousers and a dark jacket. he is alternatively mellifluous and violent in his manner.

the mother seems crushed and terrified as if by an intolerable weight of shame and abasement. she is dressed in modest black and wears a thick widow's veil of crêpe. when she lifts this, she reveals a wax-like face. she always keeps her eyes downcast.

the step-daughter, is dashing, almost impudent, beautiful. she wears mourning too, but with great elegance. she shows contempt for the timid half-frightened manner of the wretched boy (14 years old, and also dressed in black); on the other hand, she displa

[takes the child by the hand and leads her to the manager.] isn't she a dear? [takes her up and kisses her.] darling! darling! [puts her down again and adds feelingly.] well, when god suddenly takes this dear little child away from that poor mother there; and this imbecile here [seizing hold of the boy roughly and pushing him forward.] does the stupidest things, like the fool he is, you will see me run away. yes, gentlemen, i shall be off. but the moment hasn't arrived yet. after what has taken place between him and me [indicates the father with a horrible wink.] i can't remain any longer in this society, to have to witness the anguish of this mother here for that fool . . .

the father. he isn't here you see, not because he is dead. he isn't here -- look at her a moment and you will understand -- because her drama isn't a drama of the love of two men for whom she was incapable of feeling anything except possibly a little gratitude -- gratitude not for me but for the other. she isn't a woman, she is a mother, and her drama -- powerful

 sir, i assure you -- lies, as a matter of fact, all in these four children she has had by two men.

the mother. i had them? have you got the courage to say that i wanted them? [to the company.] it was his doing. it was he who gave me that other man, who forced me to go away with him.

the step-daughter. it isn't true.

the mother [startled]. not true, isn't it?

the step-daughter. no, it isn't true, it just isn't true.

the mother. and what can you know about it?

the step-daughter. it isn't true. don't believe it. [to manager.] do you know why she says so? for that fellow there. [indicates the son.] she tortures herself, destroys herself on account of the neglect of that son there; and she wants him to believe that if she abandoned him when he was only two years old, it was because he [indicates the father.] made her do so.

the mother [vigorously]. he forced me to it, and i call god to witness it. [to the manager.] ask

the mother. no, i don't deny it . . .

the step-daughter. he was always full of affection and kindness for you. [to the boy, angrily.] it's true, isn't it? tell them! why don't you speak, you little fool?

the mother. leave the poor boy alone. why do you want to make me appear ungrateful, daughter? i don't want to offend your father. i have answered him that i didn't abandon my house and my son through any fault of mine, nor from any wilful passion.

the mother. but you drove me away.

juvenile lead. this is something quite new.

l'ingénue. most interesting!

leading lady. yes, for the people who like that kind of thing. [casts a glance at leading man.]

the manager [to father]. you must please explain yourself quite clearly. [sits down.]

the father. very well then: listen! i had in my service a poor man, a clerk, a secretary of mine, full of devotion, who became friends with her. [indicating the mother.] they understood one another, were kindred souls in fact, without, however, the least suspicion of any evil existing. they were incapable even of thinking of it.

the step-daughter. so he thought of it -- for them!

the father. that's not true. i meant to do good to them -- and to myself, i confess, at the same time. things had come to the point that i could not say a word to either of them without their making a mute appeal, one to the other, with their eyes. i could see them silently asking

the manager. and why didn't you send him away then -- this secretary of yours?

the father. precisely what i did, sir. and then i had to watch this poor woman drifting forlornly about the house like an animal without a master, like an animal one has taken in out of pity.

the mother. ah yes . . .

the father [suddenly turning to the mother]. it's true about the son anyway, isn't it?

the mother. he took my son away from me first of all.

the father. but not from cruelty. i did it so that he should grow up healthy and strong by living in the country.

the step-daughter [pointing to him ironically]. as one can see.

the manager. yes, please stop it, for heaven's sake.

the step-daughter. but imagine moral sanity from him, if you please -- the client of certain ateliers like that of madame pace!

the father. fool! that is the proof that i am a man! this seeming contradiction, gentlemen, is the strongest proof that i stand here a live man before you. why, it is just for this very incongruity in my nature that i have had to suffer what i have. i could not live by the side of that woman [indicating the mother.] any longer; but not so much for the boredom she inspired me with as for the pity i felt for her.

the mother. and so he turned me out -- -.

the father. -- well provided for! yes, i sent her to that man, gentlemen . . . to let her go free of me.

the mother. and to free himself.

[then excitedly to manager explaining.] after she [indicating mother.] went away, my house seemed suddenly empty. she was my incubus, but she filled my house. i was like a dazed fly alone in the empty rooms. this boy here [indicating the son.] was educated away from home, and when he came back, he seemed to me to be no more mine. with no mother to stand between him and me, he grew up entirely for himself, on his own, apart, with no tie of intellect or affection binding him to me. and then -- strange but true -- i was driven, by curiosity at first and then by som

the step-daughter. yes, yes. true. he used to follow me in the street and smiled at me, waved his hand, like this. i would look at him with interest, wondering who he might be. i told my mother, who guessed at once. [the mother agrees with a nod.] then she didn't want to send me to school for some days; and when i finally went back, there he was again -- looking so ridiculous -- with a paper parcel in his hands. he came close to me, caressed me, and drew out a fine straw hat from the parcel, with a bouquet of flowers -- all for me!

the manager. let's come to the point. this is only discussion.

the father. very good, sir! but a fact is like a sack which won't stand up when it is empty. in order that it may stand up, one has to put into it the reason and sentiment which have caused it to exist. i couldn't possibly know that after the death of that man, they had decided to return here, that they were in misery, and that she [pointing to the mother.] had gone to work as a modiste, and at a shop of the type of that of madame pace.

the step-daughter. a real high-class modiste, you must know, gentlemen. in appearance, she works for the leaders of the best society; but she arranges matters so that these elegant ladies serve her purpose . . . without prejudice to other ladies who are . . . well . . . only so so.

the step-daughter. poor mamma! do you know, sir, what that woman did when i brought her back the work my mother had finished? she would point out to me that i had torn one of my frocks, and she would give it back to my mother to mend. it was i who paid for it, always i; while this poor creature here believed she was sacrificing herself for me and these two children here, sitting up at night sewing madame pace's robes.

the manager. and one day you met there . . .

the step-daughter. him, him. yes sir, an old client. there's a scene for you to play! superb!

you not deny us, with your behaviour, i won't say the intimacy of home, but even that mere hospitality which makes guests feel at their ease? we were intruders who had come to disturb the kingdom of your legitimacy. i should like to have you witness, mr. manager, certain scenes between him and me. he says i have tyrannized over everyone. but it was just his behaviour which made me insist on the reason for which i had come into the house, -- this reason he calls "vile" -- into his house, with my mother who is his mother too. and i came as mistress of the house.

the son. it's easy for them to put me always in the wrong. but imagine, gentlemen, the position of a son, whose fate it is to see arrive one day at his home a young woman of impudent bearing, a young woman who inquires for his father, with whom who knows what business she has. this young man has then to witness her return bolder than ever, accompanied by that child there. he is obliged to watch her treat his father in an equivocal and

the father. but i have, as a matter of fact, this obligation. i owe it to your mother.

the son. how should i know? when had i ever seen or heard of her? one day there arrive with her [indicating step-daughter.] that lad and this baby here. i am told: "this is your mother too, you know." i divine from her manner [indicating step-daughter again.] why it is they have come home. i had rather not say what i feel and think about it. i shouldn't even care to confess to myself. no action can therefore be hoped for from me in this affair. believe me, mr. manager, i am an "unrealized" character, dramatically speaking; and i find myself not at all at ease in their company. leave me out of it, i beg you.

 how do you know what i am like? when did you ever bother your head about me?

[pointing out the mother to the manager.] see, she's crying!

the step-daughter [angrily, stamping her foot]. like a fool!

the father [indicating step-daughter]. she can't stand him you know. [then referring again to the son.] he says he doesn't come into the affair, whereas he is really the hinge of the whole action. look at that lad who is always clinging to his mother, frightened and humiliated. it is on account of this fellow here. possibly his situation is the most painful of all. he feels himself a stranger more

the manager. oh, we'll cut him out. you've no notion what a nuisance boys are on the stage . . .

the father. he disappears soon, you know. and the baby too. she is the first to vanish from the scene. the drama consists finally in this: when that mother re-enters my house, her family born outside of it, and shall we say superimposed on the original, ends with the death of the little girl, the tragedy of the boy and the flight of the elder daughter. it cannot go on, because it is foreign to its surroundings. so after much torment, we three remain: i, the mother, that son. then, owing to the disappearance of that extraneous family, we too find ourselves strange to one another. we find we are living in an atmosphere of mortal desolation which is

the mother. it's taking place now. it happens all the time. my torment isn't a pretended one. i live and feel every minute of my torture. those two children there -- have you heard them speak? they can't speak any more. they cling to me to keep up my torment actual and vivid for me. but for themselves, they do not exist, they aren't any more. and she [indicating the step-daughter.] has run away, she has left me, and is lost. if i now see her here before me, it is only to renew for me the tortures i have s

uffered for her too.

the father. the eternal moment! she [indicating the step-daughter.] is here to catch me, fix me, and hold me eternally in the stocks for that one fleeting and shameful moment of my life. she can't give it up! and you sir, cannot either fairly spare me it.

the manager. i never said i didn't want to act it. it will form, as a matter of fact, the nucleus of the whoie first act right up to her surprise. [indicates the mother.]

the father. just so! this is my punishment: the passion in all of us that must culminate in her final cry.

the step-daughter. i can hear it still in my ears. it's driven me mad, that cry! -- you can put me on as you like; it doesn't matter. fully dressed, if you like -- provided i have at least the arm bare; because, standing like this [she goes close to the father and leans her head on his breast.] with my head so, and my arms round his neck, i saw a vein pulsing in my arm here; and then,

as if that live vein had awakened disgust in me, i closed my eyes like this, and let my head sink on his breast. [turning to the mother.] cry out mother! cry out! [buries head in father's breast, and with her shoulders raised as if to prevent her hearing the cry, adds in tones of intense emotion.] cry out as you did then!

the mother [coming forward to separate them]. no! my daughter, my daughter! [and after having pulled her away from him.] you brute! you brute! she is my daughter! don't you see she's my daughter?

the manager [walking backwards towards footlights]. fine! fine! damned good! and then, of course -- curtain!

the father [going towards him excitedly]. yes, of course, because that's the way it really happened.

the manager [convinced and pleased]. oh, yes, no doubt about it. curtain here, curtain!

e goes and lets it down in earnest. [to the father, while he pulls the curtain back to go on to the stage again.] yes, yes, it.'s all right. effect certain! that's the right ending. i'll guarantee the first act at any rate.



act iii

when the curtain goes up again, it is seen that the stage hands have shifted the bit of scenery used in the last part, and have rigged up instead at the back of the stage a drop, with some trees, and one or two wings. a portion of a fountain basin is visible. the mother is sitting on the right with the two children by her side. the son is on the same side, but away from the others. he seems bored, angry, and full of shame. the father and the step-daughter are also seated towards the right front. on the other side (left) are the actors, much in the positions they occupied before the curtain was lowered. only the manager is standing up in the middle of the stage, with his hand closed over his mouth in the act of meditating.

the manager [shaking his shoulders af

ter a brief pause]. ah yes: the second act! leave it to me, leave it all to me as we arranged, and you'll see! it'll go fine!

the step-daughter. our entry into his house [indicates father.] in spite of him . . . [indicates the son.]

the manager [out of patience]. leave it to me, i tell you!

the step-daughter. do let it be clear, at any rate, that it is in spite of my wishes.

the mother [from her corner, shaking her head]. for all the good that's come of it . . .

the step-daughter [turning towards her quickly]. it doesn't matter. the more harm done us, the more remorse for him.

the manager [impatiently]. i understand! good heavens! i understand! i'm taking it into account.

the mother [supplicatingly]. i beg you, sir, to let it appear quite plain that for conscience' sake i did try in every way . . .

the step-daughter [interrupting indignantly and continuing for the mother]

ther. what is there then to marvel at in us? imagine such a misfortune for characters as i have described to you: to be born of an author's fantasy, and be denied life by him; and then answer me if these characters left alive, and yet without life, weren't right in doing what they did do and are doing now, after they have attempted everything in their power to persuade him to give them their stage life. we've all tried him in turn, i, she [indicating the step-daughter.] and she. [indicating the mother.]

the step-daughter. it's true. i too have sought to tempt him, many, many times, when he has been sitting at his writing table, feeling a bit melancholy, at the twilight hour. he would sit in his armchair too lazy to switch on the light, and all the shadows that crept into his room were full of our presence coming to tempt him. [as if she saw herself still there by the writing table, and was annoyed by the presence of the actors.] oh, if you would only go away, go away and leave us alone -- m

! [turning to step-daughter.] suppose the little girl there were to surprise him as he looks round,, and run over to him, so we could give him a word or two to say?

the step-daughter. it's useless to hope he will speak, as long as that fellow there is here . . . [indicates the son.] you must send him away first.

the son [jumping up]. delighted! delighted! i don't ask for anything better. [begins to move away.]

the manager [at once stopping him]. no! no! where are you going? wait a bit!

[the mother gets up alarmed and terrified at the thought that he is really about to go away. instinctively she lifts her arms to prevent him, without, however, leaving her seat.]

the son [to manager who stops him]. i've got nothing to do with this affair. let me go please! let me go!

the manager. what do you mean by saying you've got nothing to do with this?

the step-daughter [calmly, with irony]. don't bother to stop him: he won't go away.

the father. he has to act the terrible scene in the garden wit

the son [suddenly resolute and with dignity]. i shall act nothing at all. i've said so from the very beginning. [to the manager.] let me go!

the step-daughter [going over to the manager]. allow me? [puts down the manager's arm which is restraining the son.] well, go away then, if you want to! [the son looks at her with contempt and hatred. she laughs and says.] you see, he can't, he can't go away! he is obliged to stay here, indissolubly bound to the chain. if i, who fly off when that happen

s which has to happen, because i can't bear him -- if i am still here and support that face and expression of his, you can well imagine that he is unable to move. he has to remain here, has to stop with that nice father of his, and that mother whose only son he is. [turning to the mother.] come on, mother, come along! [turning to manager to indicate her.] you see, she was getting up to keep him back. [to the mother, beckoning her with her hand.] come on! come on! [then to manager.] you can imagine how little she wants to show these actors of yours what she really feels; but so eager is she to get near him that . . . there, you see? she is willing to act her part. [and in fact, the mother approaches him; and as soon as the step-daughter has finished speaking, opens her arms to signify that she consents.]

the son [suddenly]. no! no! if i can't go away, then i'll stop here; but i repeat: i act nothing!

 father [to manager excitedly]. you can force him, sir.

the son. nobody can force me.

the father. i can.

the step-daughter. wait a minute, wait . . . first of all, the baby has to go to the fountain . . . [runs to take the child and leads her to the fountain.]

the manager. yes, yes of course; that's it. both at the same time.

[the second lady lead and the juvenile lead at this point separate themselves from the group of actors. one watches the mother attentively; the other moves about studying the movements and manner of the son whom he will have to act.]

the son [to manager]. what do you mean by both at the same time? it isn't right. there was no scene between me and her. [indicates the mother.] ask her how it was!

the mother. yes, it's true. i had come into his room . . .

the son. into my room, do you understand? nothing to do with the garden.

the manager. it doesn't matter. haven't i told you we've got to group the action?

the son [

observing the juvenile lead studying him]. what do you want?

the juvenile lead. nothing! i was just looking at you.

the son [turning towards the second lady lead]. ah! she's at it too: to re-act her part! [indicating the mother.]

the manager. exactly! and it seems to me that you ought to be grateful to them for their interest.

the son. yes, but haven't you yet perceived that it isn't possible to live in front of a mirror which not only freezes us with the image of ourselves, but throws our likeness back at us with a horrible grimace?

the father. that is true, absolutely true. you must see that.

the manager [to second lady lead and juvenile lead]. he's right! move away from them!

the son. do as you like. i'm out o

f this!

the manager. be quiet, you, will you? and let me hear your mother! [to mother.] you were saying you had entered . . .

the mother. yes, into his room, because i couldn't stand it any longer. i went to empty my heart to him of all the anguish that tortures me . . . but as soon as he saw me come in . . .

the son. nothing happened! there was no scene. i went away, that's all! i don't care for scenes!

the mother. it's true, true. that's how it was.

the manager. well now, we've got to do this bit between you and him. it's indispensable.

the mother. i'm ready . . . when you are ready. if you could only find a chance for me to tell him what i feel here in my heart.

the father [going to son in a great rage]. you'll do this for your mother, for your mother, do you understand?

the son [quite determined]. i do nothing!

the father [taking hold of him and shaking him]. for god's sake, do as i tell you! don

the son [taking hold of the father]. no! no! and for god's sake stop it, or else . . . [general agitation.]

[the mother, frightened, tries to separate them.]

the mother [pleading]. please! please!

the father [not leaving hold of the son]. you've got to obey, do you hear?

the son [almost crying from rage]. what does it mean, this madness you've got? [they separate.] have you no decency, that you insist on showing everyone our shame? i won't do it! i won't! and i stand for the will of our author in this. he didn't want to put us on the stage, after all!

the manager. well, tell me then what did happen. you went out of your room without saying a word?

the son. without a word, so as to avoid a scene!

the manager. and then what did you do?

the son. nothing . . . walking in the garden . . . [hesitates for a moment with expression of gloom.]

the manager [coming closer to him, interested by his extraordinary reserve]. well, well . . . walking in the garden . . .

the son [exasperated]. why on earth do you insist? it's horrible! [the mother trembles, sobs, and looks towards the fountain.]

the manager [slowly observing the glance and turning towards the son with increasing apprehension]. the baby?

the son. there in the fountain . . .

the father [pointing with tender pity to the mother]. she was following him at the moment . . .

the manager [to the son anxiously]. and then you . . .

the son. i ran over to her; i was jumping in to drag her out when i saw something that froze my blood . . . the boy standing stock still, with eyes

the mother [with a cry of terror runs over in that direction together with several of the actors amid general confusion]. my son! my son! [then amid the cries and exclamations one hears her voice.] help! help!

the manager [pushing the actors aside while they lift up the boy and carry him off.] is he really wounded?

some actors. he's dead! dead!

other actors. no, no, it's only make believe, it's only pretence!

the father [with a terrible cry]. pretence? reality, sir, reality!

the manager. pretence? re
