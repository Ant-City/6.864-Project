bust of jay gould that pierce kept over the bed on a shelf so narrow for it she'd always had the hovering fear it would someday topple 
on them. was that how he'd died, she wondered, among dreams, crushed by the only ikon in the house? that only made her laugh, 
out loud and helpless: you're so sick, oedipa, she told herself, or the room, which knew. 

the letter was from the law firm of warpe, wist-full, kubitschek and mcmingus, of los angeles, and signed by 

somebody named metzger. it said pierce had died back in the spring, and they'd only just now found the will. metzger was to act 
as co-executor and special counsel in the event of any involved litigation. oedipa had been named also to execute the will in a 
codicil dated a year ago. she tried to think back to whether anything unusual had happened around then. through the rest of 
the afternoon, through her trip to the market in downtown kinneret-among-the-pines to buy ricotta and listen to the muzak

face, body, things he'd given her, things she had now and then pretended not to've heard him say. it took him over, and to the 
verge of being forgotten. the shadow waited a year before visiting. but now there was metzger's letter. had pierce called last 
year then to tell her about this codicil? or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and mucho's in-
difference? she felt exposed, finessed, put down. she had never executed a will in her life, didn't know where to begin, 
didn't know how to tell the law firm in l. a. that she didn't know where to begin. 

"mucho, baby," she cried, in an access of helplessness. 
mucho maas, home, bounded through the screen door. "today was another defeat,"

she left kinneret, then, with no idea she was moving toward anything new. mucho maas, enigmatic, whistling "i want to kiss your 
feet," a new recording by sick dick and the volkswagens (an english group he was fond of at that time but did not believe in), 
stood with hands in pockets while she explained about going down to san narciso for a while to look into pierce's books and records 
and confer with metzger, the co-executor. mucho was sad to see her go, but not desperate, so after telling him to hang up if dr hilarius 

called and look after the oregano in the garden, which had contracted a. strange mold, she went. 

 

san narciso lay further south, near l.a. like many named places in california it was less an identifiable city than a 

grouping of concepts—census tracts, special purpose bond-issue districts, shopping nuclei, all overlaid with access roads to its 
own freeway. but it had been

nearest weapon, which happened to be the rabbit-ear antenna off the tv in the corner. "oh," said miles, stopping. "you 
hate me too." eyes bright through his bangs. 
"you are a paranoid," oedipa said. "i have a smooth young body," said miles, "i thought you older chicks went for that." he 
left after shaking her down for four bits for carrying the bags. 

that night the lawyer metzger showed up. he turned out to be so good-looking that oedipa thought at first they, 

somebody up there, were putting her on. it had to be an actor. he stood at her door, behind him the oblong pool shimmering 
silent in a mild diffusion of light from the nighttime sky, saying, "mrs maas," like a reproach. his enormous eyes, lambent, 
extravagantly lashed, smiled out at her wickedly; she looked around him for reflectors, microphones, camera cabling, but 
there was only himself and a debonair bottl

"so hey," he murmured, "after scouring motels all day to find you, i can come in there, can't i?" 
oedipa had planned on nothing more involved that evening than watching bonanza on the tube. she'd shifted into 

stretch denim slacks and a shaggy black sweater, and had her hair all the way down. she knew she looked pretty good. "come 
in," she said, "but i only have one glass." 

"i," the gallant metzger let her know, "can drink out of the bottle." he came in and sat on the floor, in his suit. opened the 
bottle, poured her a drink, began to talk. it presently came out that oedipa hadn't been so far off, thinking it was an actor. some 
twenty-odd years ago, metzger had been one of those child movie stars, performing under the name of baby igor. "my 
mother," he announced bitterly, "was really out to kasher me, boy, like a piece of beef on the sink, she wanted me drained

"you certainly don't look," oedipa began, then had second thoughts. 
metzger flashed her a big wry couple rows of teeth. "looks don't mean a thing any more," he said. "i live inside my looks, 

and i'm never sure. the possibility haunts me." 

"and how often," oedipa inquired, now aware it was all words, "has that line of approach worked for you, baby igor?" 
"do you know," metzger said, "inverarity only mentioned you to me once." "were you close?" "no. i drew up his will. don't

o the screen bloomed the image of a child of indeterminate sex, 
its bare legs pressed awkward together, its shoulder-length curls mingling with the shorter hair of a st bernard, whose long 
tongue, as oedipa watched, began to swipe at the child's rosy cheeks, making the child wrinkle up its nose appealingly and say, 
"aw, murray, come on, now, you're getting me all wet." 

"that's me, that's me," cried metzger, staring, "good god." 

"which one?" asked oedipa. "that movie was called," metzger snapped his fingers, "cashiered." 
"about you and your mother." "about this kid and his father, who's drummed out of the british army for cowardice, only he's 
covering up for a friend, see, and to redeem himself he and the kid follow the old regiment to gallipoli, where the father

his aging double, over oedipa's protests, sang harmony.

all part of a plot, an elaborate, seduction, plot. o metzger. "you didn't sing along," he observed. "i didn't know," oedipa smiled.

breath, metzger on the chance it might be for him looked over. but she'd only been reminded of her look downhill this noontime. 
some immediacy was there again, some promise of hierophany: printed circuit, gently curving streets, private access to the 
water, book of the dead. . . .

oedipa refilled her wine glass. they lay now, staring at the screen, flanks just lightly touching. there came from the tv set a 
terrific explosion. "mines!" cried metzger, covering his head and rolling away from her. "daddy," blubbered the metzger in the tube,

"a cash nexus," brooded oedipa, "you and perry mason, two of a kind, it's all you know about, you

"you're in trouble," oedipa told him, staring at the tube, conscious of his thigh, warm through his suit and her slacks. presently: 
"the turks are up there with searchlights," he said, pouring more tequila, watching the little submarine fill up, "patrol

"of course not," said oedipa, "the movie's made." he only smiled back. "one of your endless repetitions." 

"but you still don't know," metzger said. "you haven't seen it." into the commercial break now roared a deafening ad for 

beaconsfield cigarettes, whose attractiveness lay in their filter's use of bone charcoal, the very best kind. 
"bones of what?" wondered oedipa. 

"inverarity knew. he owned 51% of the filter process."

impatient for the movie to come back on.

to carrion for the fish at the bottom of the dardanelles, your daddy, your doggie, and you." 

"fair enough," drawled metzger, taking her hand as if to shake on the bet and kissing its palm instead, sending the dry end of his 

tongue to graze briefly among her fate's furrows, the changeless salt hatchings of her identity. she wondered then if this were really 
happening in the same way as, say, her first time in bed with pierce, the dead man. but then the movie came back.

"golly," metzger said, "they must have got the reels screwed up." 

"is this before or after?" she asked, reaching for the tequila bottle, a move that put her left breast in the region  of metzger's  nose. the 
irrepressibly comic metzger made cross-eyes before replying, "that would be telling." 

"come on." she nudged his nose with the padded tip of her bra cup and poured booze. "or the bet's off." 

"nope," metzger said. 

"at least tell me if that's his old regiment, there." 
"go ahead," said metzger, "ask questions. but for each answer, you'll have to take something off. we'll call it strip botticelli."

blood. they don't show that." oedipa skipped into the bathroom, which happened also to have a walk-in closet, quickly undressed 
and began putting on as much as she could of the clothing she'd brought with her: six pairs of panties in assorted colors, girdle, three 
pairs of nylons, three brassieres, two pairs stretch slacks, four half-slips, one black sheath, two summer dresses, half dozen a-li

it all seemed to take hours to put on and she could hardly walk when she was finished. she made the mistake of looking at herself in the 
full-length mirror, saw a beach ball with feet, and laughed so violently she fell over, taking a can of hair spray on the sink with her. 
the can hit the floor, something broke, and with a great outsurge of pressure the stuff com- 
menced atomizing, propelling the can swiftly about the bathroom. metzger rushed in to find oedipa rolling around, trying to get 
back on her feet, amid a great sticky miasma of fragrant lacquer. "oh, for pete's sake," he said in his baby igor voice. the can, hissing 
malignantly, bounced off the toilet and whizzed by metzger's right ear, missing by maybe a quarter of an inch. metzger hit the deck 
and cowered with oedipa as the can continued its high-speed caroming; from the other room came a slow, deep crescendo of naval 
bombardment,   machine-gun,  howitzer  and

his eyelids, into the staring ceiling light, her field of vision cut across by wild, flashing overflights of the can, whose pressure seemed 
inexhaustible. she was scared but nowhere near sober. the can knew where it was going, she sensed, or something fast enough, 
god or a digital machine, might have computed in advance the complex web of its travel; but she wasn't fast enough, and knew 
only that it might hit them at any moment, at whatever clip it was doing, a hundred miles an hour. "metzger," she moaned, and sank 
her teeth into his upper arm, through the sharkskin. everything smelled like hair spray. the can collided with a mirror and bounced 
away, leaving a silvery, reticulated bloom of glass to hang a second before it all fell jingling into the sink; zoomed over to the 
enclosed shower, where it crashed into and totally destroyed a panel of frosted glass; thence around the three tile walls, up to the 
ceiling, past the light, over the two prostrate bodies, amid its own whoosh

and the buzzing, distorted uproar from the tv set. she 
could imagine no end to it; yet presently the can did give up in mid-flight and fall to the floor, about a foot from oedipa's nose. she 
lay watching it. 

"blimey," somebody remarked. "coo." oedipa took her teeth out of metzger, looked around and saw in the doorway miles, 
the kid with the bangs and mohair suit, now multiplied by four. it seemed to be the group he'd mentioned, the paranoids. she couldn't 
tell them apart, three of them were carrying electric guitars, they all had their mouth open. there also appeared a number of girls' 
faces, gazing through armpits and around angles of knees. "that's kinky," said one of the girls. 
"are you from london?" another wanted to know: "is that a london thing you're doing?"

"i'm sure this pales by comparison," said oedipa, who'd succeeded in rolling over, "so why don't you all just, you know, go 

outside. and sing. none of this works without mood music. serenade us." 

"maybe later," invited one of the other paranoids shyly, "you could join us in the pool." 
"depends how hot it gets in here, gang," winked jolly oedipa. the kids filed out, after plugging extension cords into all 

available outlets in the other room and leading them in a bundle out a window. 

metzger helped her stagger to her feet. "anyone for strip botticelli?" in the other room the tv was 

blaring a commercial for a turkish bath in downtown san narciso, wherever downtown was, called hogan's seraglio. "inverarity 
owned that too," metzger said. "did you know that?" 

"sadist," oedipa yelled, "say it once more, i'll wrap the tv tube around your head," 

"you're really mad," he smiled. 

she wasn't, really. she said, "what the hell didn't he own?" 

metzger cocked an eyebrow at her. "you te

if she was going to she got no chance, for outside, all in a shuddering deluge of thick guitar chords, the paranoids had broken into 
song. their drummer had set up precariously on the diving board, the others were invisible. metzger came up behind her with some idea 
of cupping his hands around her breasts, but couldn't immediately find them because of all the clothes. they stood at the window and 
heard the paranoids singing.

"now then," oedipa shivered brightly. 

"first question," metzger reminded her. from the tv set the st bernard was barking. oedipa looked and saw baby igor, 

disguised as a turkish beggar lad, skulking with the dog around a set she took to be constantinople. 
"another early reel," she said hopefully. 

"i can't allow that question," metzger said. on the doorsill the paranoids, as we leave milk to propitiate the leprechaun, had 

set a fifth of jack daniels. 

"oboy," said oedipa. she poured a drink. "did baby igor get to constantinople in the good submarine

"no," said metzger. oedipa took off an earring. "did he get there in, what did you call them, in an e class submarine." 

"no," said metzger. oedipa took off another earring. 
"did he get there overland, maybe through asia minor?" 
"maybe," said metzger. oedipa took off another earring. 

"another earring?" said metzger. "if i answer that, will you take something off?" "i'll do it without an answer," roared metzger, 
shucking out of his coat. oedipa refilled her glass, metzger had another snort from the bottle. oedipa then sat five minutes 
watching the tube, forgetting she was supposed to ask questions. metzger took his trousers off, earnestly. the father seemed to 
be up before a court-martial, now. 
"so," she said, "an early reel. this is where he gets cashiered, ha, ha." 

"maybe it's a flashback," metzger said. "or maybe he gets it twice." oedipa removed a bracelet. so it went: the succession of

tireless shivaree, of voices and guitars from out by the pool. now and then a commercial would come in, each time metzger would 
say, "inverarity's," or "big block of shares," and later settled for nodding and smiling. oedipa would scowl back, growing 
more and more certain, while a headache began to flower behind her eyes, that they among all possible combinations of new 
lovers had found a way to make time itself slow down. things grew less and less clear. at some point she went into the bath-
room,  tried  to  find her image in  the  mirror and couldn't. she had a moment of nearly pure terror. then remembered t

took the occasion to blunder, almost absently, into another slip and skirt, as well as a long-leg girdle and a couple pairs of knee 
socks. it struck her that if the sun ever came up metzger would disappear. she wasn't sure if she wanted him to. she came 
back in to find metzger wearing only a pair of boxer shorts and fast asleep with a harden and his head under the couch. she 
noticed also a fat stomach the suit had hidden. on the screen new zealanders and turks were impaling one another on 
bayonets. with a cry oedipa rushed to him, fell on him, began kissing him to wake him up. his radiant eyes flew open, 
pierced her, as if she could feel the sharpness somewhere vague between her breasts. she sank with an enormous sigh that

a sexual crescendo in progress, like a cut to a scene where the camera's already moving. outside a fugue of guitars had begun, 
and she counted each electronic voice as it came in, till she reached six or so and recalled only three of the paranoids played 
guitars; so others must be plugging in. 

which indeed they were. her climax and metzger's, when it came, coincided with every light in the place, including the 
tv tube, suddenly going out, dead, black. it was a curious experience. the paranoids had blown a fuse. when the lights came on 
again, and she and metzger lay twined amid a wall-to-wall scatter of clothing and spilled bourbon, the tv tube revealed the father, 
dog and baby igor trapped inside the darkening "justine," as the water level inexorably rose. the dog was first to drown, in a great

swelled that strange 30's movie music with the massive sax section, in faded the legend the

oedipa had leaped to her feet and run across to the other wall to turn and glare at metzger. "they didn't make it!" she yelled. 

"you bastard, i won." 
"you won me," metzger smiled. 
"what did inverarity tell you about me," she asked 
finally.

she began to cry.

night's infidelity with metzger would logically be the starting point for it; logically. that's what would come to haunt her most, perhaps:

around her. much of the revelation was to come through the

after all could the mute stamps have told her, remaining then as they would've only ex-rivals, cheated as she by death, about to be 
broken up into lots, on route to any number of new masters? 

it got seriously under way, this sensitizing, either with the letter from mucho or the evening she and metzger drifted into a 

strange bar known as the scope. looking back she forgot which had come first. the letter itself had nothing much to say, had 
come in response to one of her dutiful, more or less rambling, twice-a-week notes to him, in which she was not confessing to her scene

it may have been an intuition that the letter would be newsless inside that made oedipa look more closely at its outside, when it 

arrived. at first she didn't see. it was an ordinary muchoesque envelope, swiped from the station, ordinary airmail stamp, to the left 
of the cancellation a blurb put on by the government, report all obscene mail to your potsmaster. idly, she began to skim back 
through mucho's letter after reading it to see if there were any dirty words. "metzger," it occurred to her, "what is a 
pots-master?"

gunboats, dutch ovens . . ." 
she threw a brassiere in at him and said, "i'm 
 
supposed to report all obscene mail to my pots-master."

plant. every now and again, like this evening, echo courts became impossible, either because of the stillness of the pool and 
the blank windows that faced on it, or a prevalence of teenage voyeurs, who'd all had copies of miles's passkey made so they 
could check in at whim on any bizarre sexual action. this would grow so bad oedipa and metzger got in the habit of dragging a 
mattress into the walk-in closet, where metzger would then move the chest of drawers up against the door, remove the bottom drawer and 
put it on top, insert his legs in the empty space, this being the only way he could lie full length in this closet, by which point he'd 
usually lost interest in the whole thing. 

the scope proved to be a haunt for electronics assembly people from yoyodyne. the green neon sign outside ingeniously 

depicted the face of an oscilloscope tube, over which flowed an ever-changing dance of lissajous figures. toda

ne sais quoi about the scope crowd: they all wore glasses and stared at you, 
 
silent. except for a couple-three nearer the door, who were engaged in a nose-picking contest, seeing how far they could flick it 
across the room. 

a sudden chorus of whoops and yibbles burst from a kind of juke box at the far end of the room. everybody quit talking. the 

bartender tiptoed back, with the drinks.

"they put it on the tape, here, live, fella. we got a whole back room full of your audio oscillators, gunshot machines, contact

"you one of these right-wing nut outfits?" inquired the diplomatic metzger. 
fallopian twinkled. "they accuse us of being paranoids." 

"they?" inquired metzger, twinkling also. 
"us?" asked oedipa. 

the peter pinguid society was named for the commanding officer of the confederate man-of-war "disgruntled," who 
early in 1863 had set sail with the daring plan of bringing a task force around cape horn to attack san francisco and thus open 
a second front in the war for southern independence. storms and scurvy managed to destroy or discourage every vessel in this 
armada except the game little "disgruntled," which showed up off the coast of california ab

much worse, to fallopian's mind. after the confrontation, appalled at what had to be some military alliance between 

abolitionist russia (nicholas having freed the serfs in 1861) and a union that paid lip-service to abolition while it kept its own 
industrial laborers in a kind of wage-slavery, peter pinguid stayed in his cabin for weeks, brooding. 

"but that sounds," objected metzger, "like he was against industrial capitalism. wouldn't that disqualify him as any kind of 

anti-communist figure?" 
 
"you think like a bircher," fallopian said. "good guys and bad guys. you never get to any of the underlying truth. sure he was against 
industrial capitalism. so are we. didn't it lead, inevitably, to marxism? underneath, both are part of the same creeping horror." 
"industrial anything," hazarded metzger. 
"there you go," nodded fallopian. 

"what happened to peter pinguid?" oe

a great shout went up near the doorway, bodies flowed toward a fattish pale young man who'd appeared carrying a leather mailsack 

over his shoulder. 

"mail call," people were yelling. sure enough, it was, just like in the army. the fat kid, looking harassed, climbed up on the bar and 

started calling names and throwing envelopes into the crowd. fallopian excused himself and joined the others. 

metzger had taken out a pair of glasses and was squinting through them at the kid on the bar. "he's  

  
wearing a yoyodyne badge. what do you make of that?" 
"some inter-office mail run," oedipa said. 
"this time of night?" 

"maybe a late shift?" but metzger only frowned. "be back," oedipa shrugged, heading for the ladies' room. 
on the latrine wall, among lipsticked obscenities, she noticed the following message, neatly indited in engineering

"you weren't supposed to see that," he told them. he had an envelope. oedipa could see, instead of a postage stamp, the 

handstruck initials pps.

fallopian gave them a wry smile. "it's not as rebellious as it looks. we use yoyodyne's inter-office

so began, for oedipa, the languid, sinister blooming of the tristero. or rather, her attendance at some unique performance, 

prolonged as if it were the last of the night, something a little extra for whoever'd stayed this late. as if the breakaway gowns, net bras, 
jeweled garters and g-strings of historical figuration that would fall away were layered dense as oedipa's own street-clothes in that 
game with metzger in front of the baby igor movie; as if a plunge toward dawn indefinite black hours long would indeed be necessary 
before the tristero could be revealed in its terrible nakedness. would its smile, then, be coy, and would it flirt away harmlessly backstage, 
say good night with a bourbon street bow and leave her in peace? or would it instead, the dance ended, come back down the runway, 
its luminous stare locked to oedipa's, smile gone malign and pitiless; bend to her alone among the desolate ro

the beginning of that performance was  clear enough. it was while she and metzger were waiting for ancillary letters to be 

granted representatives in arizona, texas, new york and florida, where inverarity had developed real estate, and in delaware, 
where he'd been incorporated. the two of them, followed by a convertibleful of the paranoids miles, dean, serge and leonard and 
their chicks, had decided to spend the day out at fangoso lagoons, one of inverarity's last big projects. the trip out was uneventful

rarity. out in it, on a round 
island of fill among blue wavelets, squatted the social hall, a chunky, ogived and verdigrised, art nouveau reconstruction of 
some european pleasure-casino. oedipa fell in love with it. the paranoid element piled out of their car, carrying musical 
instruments and looking around as if for outlets under the trucked-in white sand to plug into. oedipa from the impala's trunk 
took a basket filled with cold eggplant parmigian' sandwiches from an italian drive-in, and metzger came up with an 
enormous thermos of tequila sours. they wandered all in a loose pattern down the beach toward a small marina for what 
boat owners didn't have lots directly on the water. 

"hey, blokes," yelled dean or perhaps serge, "let's pinch a boat." 
"hear, hear," cried the girls. metzger closed his eyes and tripped over an old anchor. "why are you walking around," 

inquired oedipa, "with your eyes closed, metzger?" 

"larceny," metzger said, "maybe they'll need a lawyer." a snarl rose

along with some smoke from among pleasure 
boats strung like piglets along the pier, indicating the paranoids had indeed started someone's outboard. "come on, then," they 
called. suddenly, a dozen boats away, a form, covered with a blue polyethylene tarp, rose up and said, "baby igor, i need help." 
"i know that voice," said metzger. 

"quick," said the blue tarp, "let me hitch a ride with you guys." 

"hurry, hurry," called the paranoids. 

"manny di presso," said metzger, seeming less than delighted. 

"your actor/lawyer friend," oedipa recalled. 

"not so loud, hey," said di presso, skulking as best a polyethylene cone can along the landing towards them. "they're 
watching. with binoculars." metzger handed oedipa aboard the about-to-be-hijacked vessel, a ly-foot aluminum trimaran 
known as the "godzilla ii," and gave di presso what he intended to be a hand also, but he had grabbed, it seemed, only empty 
plastic, and when he pulled, the entire covering came aw

ay and there stood di presso, in a skin-diving suit and wraparound shades. 
"i can explain," he said. 

"hey," yelled a couple voices, faintly, almost in unison, from up the beach a ways. a squat man with a crew cut, intensely 
tanned and also with shades, came out in the open running, one arm doubled like a wing with the hand at chest level, inside the 
jacket. 
"are we on camera?" asked metzger dryly. 

"this is real," chattered di presso, "come on." the paranoids cast off, backed the "godzilla h" out from the pier, turned 

and with a concerted whoop took off like a bat out of hell, nearly sending di presso over the fantail. oedipa, looking back, 
could see their pursuer had been joined by another man about the same build. both wore gray suits. she couldn't see if they 
were holding anything like guns. 
"i left my car on the other side of the lake," di presso said, "but i know he has

"who does," metzger asked. 

"anthony giunghierrace," replied ominous di presso, "alias tony jaguar."

"eh, sfacim'," shrugged di presso, and spat into their wake. the paranoids were singing, to the tune of "adestefideles":

 as metzger claimed, the casting 
had been typically hollywood: they didn't look or act a bit alike. 

"so," said di presso, "who's tony jaguar. very big in cosa nostra, is who." 
"you're an actor," said metzger. "how are you in with them?" 
"i'm a lawyer again," di presso said. "that pilot will never be bought, metz, not unless you go out and do something really 

darrowlike, spectacular. arouse public interest, maybe with a sensational defense." 
"like what." 

"like win the litigation i'm bringing against the estate of pierce inverarity." metzger, as much as cool metzger could, goggled. 

di presso laughed and punched metzger in the shoulder. "that's right, good buddy."

air suddenly went cold, the sun was blotted out. the three looked up in alarm to see looming over them and about to collide the pale 
green social hall, its towering pointed windows, wrought-iron floral embellishments, solid silence, air somehow of waiting for them. 
dean, the paranoid at the helm, brought the boat around neatly to a small wooden dock, everybody got out, di presso heading 
nervously for an outside staircase. "i want to check on my car," he said. oedipa and metzger, carrying picnic stuff, followed up 
the stairs, along a balcony, out of the building's shadow, up a metal ladder finally to the roof. it was like walking on the head of a 
drum: they could hear their reverberations inside the hollow building beneath, and the delighted yelling of the paranoids. di presso, 
scuba suit glistening, scrambled up the side of a cupola. oedipa spread a blanket and poured booze into cups made of white, crushed, 
plastic foam. "it's still there," said di presso, descend

"you ran from clients?" oedipa asked. "you flee ambulances?"

up to show cause to the local table why he shouldn't be in for some discipline there. that kind of grief i do not need." 
oedipa glared. "you're a selfish schmuck." 

"all the time cosa nostra is watching," soothed metzger, "watching. it does not do to be seen helping those the 

organization does not want helped." 

"i have relatives in sicily," said di presso, in comic broken english. paranoids and their chicks appeared against the bright 
sky, from behind turrets, gables, ventilating ducts, and moved in on the eggplant sandwiches in the basket. metzger sat on the 
jug of booze so they couldn't get any. the wind had risen. 

"tell me about the lawsuit," metzger said, trying with both hands to keep his hair in p

"you've been into inverarity's books," di presso said. "you know the beaconsfield filter thing." metzger made a 

noncommittal moue. 
"bone charcoal," oedipa remembered. 

"yeah, well tony jaguar, my client, supplied some bones," said di presso, "he alleges. inverarity never paid him. that's what 

it's about." 

"offhand," metzger said, "it doesn't sound like inverarity. he was scrupulous about payments like that. unless it was a 
bribe. i only did his legal tax deductions, so i wouldn't have seen it if it was. what construction firm did your client work for?"

metzger looked around. the paranoids and their chicks may have been out of earshot. "human bones, right?" di presso 
nodded yes. "all right, that's how he got them. different highway outfits in the area, ones inverarity

"how," inquired oedipa, "are road builders in any position to sell bones, pray?"

no right to be there, so we just barrelled on through, no sweat."

"about a company," said manny di presso. lago di pieta was near the tyrrhenian coast, somewhere between naples and 
rome, and had been the scene of a now ignored (in 1943 tragic) battle of attrition in a minor pocket developed during the 
advance on rome. for weeks, a handful of american troops, cut off and without communications, huddled on the narrow shore

known these days as cosa nostra. he was right. an import-export firm bought the bones, sold them to a fertilizer enterprise, 
which may have used one or two femurs for laboratory tests but eventually decided to phase entirely into menhaden instead 
and transferred the remaining several tons to a holding company, which stored them in a warehouse outside of fort wayne, 
indiana, for maybe a year before bea-consfield got interested. 

"aha," metzger leaped. "so it was beaconsfield bought them. not inverarity. the only shares he held were in 

osteolysis, inc., the company they set up to develop the filter. never in beaconsfield itself." 

"you know, blokes," remarked one of the girls, a long-waisted, brown-haired lovely in a black knit leotard and pointed 

sneakers, "this all has a most bizarre resemblance to that ill, ill jacobean revenge play we went to last week."

laughter. but no joke: for leonard the drummer now reached into the pocket of his beach robe 
and produced a fistful of marijuana cigarettes and distributed them among his chums. metzger closed his eyes, turned his head, 
muttering, "possession." 

"help," said di presso, looking back with a wild eye and open mouth across the lake. another runabout had appeared and 
was headed toward them. two figures in gray suits crouched behind its windshield. "metz, i'm running for it. if he stops by here 
don't bully him, he's my client." and he disappeared down the ladder. oedipa with a sigh collapsed on her back and stared

of the courier's tragedy, by richard wharfinger, related near to unintelligible by eight memories unlooping progressively into 
regions as strange to map as their rising coils and clouds of pot smoke. it got so confusing that next day oedipa decided to go see 
the play itself, and even conned metzger into taking her. 
the courier's tragedy was being put on by a san narciso group known as the tank players, the tank being a small arena theatre 
located out between a traffic analysis firm and a wildcat transistor outfit that hadn't been there last year and wouldn't be this 
coming but meanwhile was underselling even the japanese and hauling in loot by the steamshovelful. oedipa and a reluctant

torture and eventual murder of a prince of the church who prefers martyrdom to sanctioning francesca's marriage to her son. the

there was an intermission. metzger lurched into the undersized lobby to smoke, oedipa headed for the ladies' room. she 

looked idly around for the symbol she'd seen the other night in the scope, but all the walls, surprisingly, were blank. she 
could not say why, exactly, but felt threatened by this absence of even the marginal try at communication latrines are known 
for.

the fifth act, entirely an anticlimax, is taken up by the bloodbath gennaro visits on the court of squamuglia. every mode of 

violent death available to renaissance man, including a lye pit, land mines, a trained falcon with envenom'd talons, is 
employed. it plays, as metzger remarked later, like a road runner cartoon in blank verse. at the end of it about the only 
character left alive in a stage dense with corpses is the colorless administrator, gennaro. 

according to the program, the courier's tragedy had been directed by one randolph driblette. he had also played the 

part of gennaro the winner. "look, metzger," oedipa said, "come on backstage with me." 
"you know one of them?" said metzger, anxious to 
leave.

feeling helpless.

"i don't know," she said, a little desperate. "metzger, don't harass me. be on my side."

wondered how accidental it had been. 

metzger had been listening to the car radio. she got in and rode with him for two miles before realizing that the whimsies of 

nighttime reception were bringing them kcuf down from kinneret, and that the disk jockey talking was her husband, mucho.  

though she saw mike fallopian again, and did trace the text of the courier's tragedy a certain distance, these follow-ups were no

metzger, who'd come along to the scope that evening, wanted to argue. "you're so right-wing you're left-wing," he 

protested. "how can you be against a corporation that wants a worker to waive his patent rights. that sounds like the surplus

jacobean revenge plays. 

"it's been very much in demand," zapf told her. the skull on the cover watched them, through the dim 

light. 
did he only mean driblette? she opened her mouth to ask, but didn't. it was to be the first of many demurs. 

back at echo courts, metzger in l.a. for the day on other business, she turned immediately to the single mention of the word 

trystero. opposite the line she read, in pencil, cf. variant, 1687 ed. put there maybe by some student. in a way, it cheered her. another 
reading of that line might help light further the dark face of the word. according to a short preface, the text had been taken from a 
folio edition, undated. oddly, the preface was unsigned. she checked the copyright page and found that the original hardcover

ns were brutal." 

"couldn't it have been a rival carrier?" 

fallopian shrugged. oedipa showed him the waste symbol, and he shrugged again. 
"it was in the ladies' room, right here in the scope, mike." 
"women," he only said. "who can tell what goes on with them?" 

if she'd thought to check a couple lines back in the wharfinger play, oedipa might have made the next connection by herself. 
as it was she got an assist from one genghis cohen, who is the most eminent philatelist in the l.a. area. metzger, acting on 
instructions in the will, had retained this amiable, slightly adenoidal expert, for a percent of his valuation, to inventory and 
appraise inverarity's stamp collection. 

one rainy morning, with mist rising off the pool, metzger again away, the paranoids off somewhere to a recording session, 

oedipa got rung up by this genghis cohen, who even over the phone she could tell was disturbed. 

"there are some irregularities, miz maas," he said. "could you come over?" 

she was somehow

 sure, driving in on the slick freeway, that the "irregularities" would tie in with the word trystero. 

metzger had taken the stamp albums to cohen from safe-deposit storage a week ago in oedipa's impala, and then she hadn't even 
been interested enough to look inside them. but now it came to her, as if the rain whispered it, that what fallopian had not 
known about private carriers, cohen might. 

 

when he opened the door of his apartment/office she saw him framed in a long succession or train of doorways, room 

after room receding in the general direction of santa monica, all soaked in rain-light. g

 such a seizure may already have visited, or how to grasp it 
should it visit again. perhaps even in this last second—but there was no way to tell. she glanced down the corridor of cohen's 
rooms in the rain and saw, for the very first time, how far it might be possible to get lost in this. 

"i have taken the liberty," genghis cohen was saying, "of getting in touch with an expert committee. i haven't yet 

forwarded them the stamps in question, pending your own authorization and of course mr metzger's. however, all fees, i am 
sure, can be charged to the estate." 
"i'm not sure i understand," oedipa said. 

"allow me." he rolled over to her a small table, and from a plastic folder lifted with tweezers, delicately, a u. s. 

commemorative stamp, the pony ex-

magnifying glass.

though her next move should have been to contact randolph driblette again, she decided instead to drive up to berkeley. she wanted 
to find out where richard wharfinger had got his information about trystero. possibly also take a look at how the inventor john 
nefastis picked up his mail. 

as with mucho when she'd left kinneret, metzger did not seem desperate at her going. she debated, driving north, whether to 

stop off at home on the way to berkeley or coming back. as it turned out she missed the exit for kinneret and that solved it. she 
purred along up the east side of the bay, presently climbed into the berkeley hills and arrived close to midnight at a sprawling, 
many-leveled, german-baroque hotel, carpeted in deep green, going in for curved corridors and ornamental chandeliers. a sign in the 
lobby said welcome califor

records. mucho came downstairs carrying his copy, a serenity about him she'd never seen. he used to hunch his shoulders and 
have a rapid eyeblink rate, and both now were gone, "wait," he smiled, and dwindled down the hall. she scrutinized him from 
behind, trying to see iridescences, auras. 

they had some time before he was on. they drove downtown to a pizzeria and bar, and faced each other through the fluted 

gold lens of a beer pitcher. 
"how are you getting on with metzger?" he said. "there's nothing," she said. "not any more, at least," said mucho. "i could tell that 
when you were talking into the mike." 

"that's pretty good," oedipa said. she couldn't figure the expression on his face. 
"it's extraordinary," said mucho, "everything's been—wait. listen." she heard nothing unusual. "there are seventeen 
violins on that cut," mucho said, "and one of them—i can't tell where he was because it's monaural here, damn." it dawned on 
her that he was talking about

when she got back to echo courts, she found miles, dean, serge and leonard arranged around and on the diving board at the end of 
the swimming pool with all their instruments, so composed and motionless that some photographer, hidden from oedipa, might 
have been shooting them for an album illustration. 
"what's happening?" said oedipa. 

"your young man," replied miles, "metzger, really put it to serge, our counter-tenor. the lad is crackers with grief." 

"he's right, missus," said serge. "i even wrote a song about it, whose arrangement features none other than me, and it goes like this."

well, as long as she's gone away-yay, 
i've had to find somebody new,

i had a date last night with an eight-year-old, 
and she's a swinger just like me, 
so you can find us any night up on the football field,

and it's as groovy as it can be. 
"you're   trying   to   tell   me   something,"   said oedipa. 

they gave it to her then in prose. metzger and serge's chick had run off to nevada, to get married. serge, on close 

questioning, admitted the bit about the eight-year-old was so far only imaginary, but that he was hanging diligently around playgrounds 
and should have some news for them any day. on top of the tv set in her room metzger had left a note telling her not to worry 
about the estate, that he'd turned over his execu-torship to somebody at warpe, wistfull, kubitschek and mcmingus, and they 
should be in touch with her, and it

 was all squared with the probate court also. no word to recall that oedipa and metzger had 
ever been more than co-executors. 

which must mean, thought oedipa, that that's all we were. she should have felt more classically scorned, but had other 

things on her mind. first thing after unpacking she was on the horn to randolph driblette, the director. after about ten rings 
an elderly lady answered. "i'm sorry, we've nothing to say." 
"well who's this," oedipa said. 

sigh. "this is his mother. there'll be a statement at noon tomorrow. our lawyer will read it." she hung up. now w

your walk into the sea had anything to do with tristero. if they got rid of you for the reason they got rid of hilarius and

that memory, and you can live with me for whatever time i've got. she remembered his head, floating in the shower, saying, you 
could fall in love with me. but could she have saved him? she looked over at the girl who'd given her the news of his death. had 
they been in love? did she know why driblette had put in those two extra lines that night? had he even known why? no one could

book a slip of paper had been pasted in. the stamp, designated 16311,1, was reproduced, under the title "tristero rapid post, 
san francisco, california," and should have been inserted between local listings 139 (the third avenue post office, of new 
york) and 140 (union post, also of new york). oedipa, off on a kind of intuitive high, went immediately to the end-paper in 
back and found the sticker of zapf's used books. 

"sure," cohen protested. "i drove out there one day to see mr. metzger, while you were up north. this is the scott 

specialized, you see, for american stamps, a catalogue i don't generally keep up on. my field being european and colonial. 
but my curiosity had been 
aroused, so——" 

"sure," oedipa said. anybody could paste in an addendum. she drove back to san narciso to have another look at the 

list of inverarity's assets. sure enough, the whole shopping center that housed zapf's used books and tremaine's surplus 
place had been owned by pierce. not only

also. 

ok, oedipa told herself, stalking around the room, her viscera hollow, waiting on something truly terrible, 

 

ok. it's unavoidable, isn't it? every access route to the tristero could be traced also back to the inverarity estate. even 
emory bortz, with his copy of blobb's peregrinations (bought, she had no doubt he'd tell her in the event she asked, also at 
zapf's), taught now at san narciso college, heavily endowed by the dead man. 

meaning what? that bortz, along with metzger, cohen, driblette, koteks, the tattooed sailor in san francisco, the 
w.a.s.t.e. carriers she'd seen—that all of them were pierce inverarity's men? bought? or loyal, for free, for fun, to some 
grandiose practical joke he'd cooked up, all for her embarrassment, or terrorizing, or moral improvement?

"this is arnold snarb," she said, choking up. 

 

"i was in the little boys' room," he said. "the men's room was full." 
she told him, quickly, using up no more than a minute, what she'd learned about the tristero, what 

had happened to hilarius, mucho, metzger, driblette, fallopian. "so you are," she said, "the only one i have. i don't know your 
name, don't want to. but i have to know whether they arranged it with you. to run into me by accident, and tell me your
