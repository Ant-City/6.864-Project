 breaks down due to
quantum fluctuations when pushed to the small.

the  basic  principles  of  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics  allow  us  to  calculate  the
approximate  distance  scales  below  which  one  would  have  to  shrink  in  order  for  the  pernicious
phenomenon of figure 5.1 to become apparent. the smallness of planck's constant—which governs
the strength of quantum effects—and the intrinsic weakness of the gravitational force team up to yield
a result called the planck length, which is small almost beyond imagination: a millionth of a billionth
of  a  billionth  of  a  billionth  of  a  centimeter  (10-33  centimeter).7  the  fifth  level  in  figure  5.1  thus
schematically  depicts  the  ultramicroscopic,  sub–planck  length  landscape  of  the  universe.  to  get  a
sense of scale, if we were to magnify an atom to the size of the known universe, the planck length
would barely expand to the height of an average tree.

and  so  we  see  that  the  incompatability

becomes apparent only in a rather esoteric realm of the universe. for this reason you might well ask
whether it's worth worrying about. in fact, the physics community does not speak with a unified voice
when  addressing  this  issue.  there  are  those  physicists  who  are  willing  to  note  the  problem,  but
happily go about using quantum mechanics and general relativity for problems whose typical lengths
far exceed the planck length, as their research requires. there are other physicists, however, who are
deeply unsettled by the fact that the two foundational pillars of physics as we know it are at their core
fundamentally  incompatible,  regardless  of  the  ultramicroscopic  distances  that  must  be  probed  to
expose the problem. the incompatibility, they argue, points to an essential flaw in our understanding
of  the  physical  universe.  this  opinion  rests  on  an  unprovable  but  profoundly  felt  view  that  the

composed of molecules and atoms, the strings of string theory are purported to lie deep within the
heart  of  matter.  the  theory  proposes  that they  are  ultramicroscopic  ingredients  making  up  the
particles  out  of  which  atoms  themselves  are  made.  the  strings  of  string  theory  are  so  small—on
average they are about as long as the planck length—that they appear pointlike even when examined
with our most powerful equipment.

yet  the  simple  replacement  of  point  particles  with  strands  of  string  as  the  fundamental
ingredients of everything has far-reaching consequences. first and foremost, string theory appears to
resolve the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. as we shall see, the spatially

the greeks' atoms, again?

as we mentioned at the outset of this chapter and as illustrated in figure 1.1, string theory claims that
if  the  presumed  point-particles  of  the  standard  model  could  be  examined  with  a  precision
significantly beyond our present capacity, each would be seen to be made of a single, tiny, oscillating
loop of string.

for reasons that will become clear, the length of a typical string loop is about the planck length,
about a hundred billion billion (1020) times smaller than an atomic nucleus. it is no wonder that our
present-day experiments are unable to resolve the microscopic stringy nature of matter: strings are
minute even on the scales set by subatomic particles. we would need an accelerator to slam matter
together with energies some million billion times more powerful than any previously constructed in
order to reveal directly that a string is not a point-particle.

but history surely has taught us that every time our understanding of the universe deepens, we find yet
smaller  microscopic  ingredients  constituting  a  finer  level  of  matter.  and  so  another  possibility,
should strings fail to be the final theory, is that they are one more layer in the cosmic onion, a layer
that becomes visible at the planck length, although not the final layer. in this case, strings could be
made up of yet-smaller structures. string theorists have raised and continue to pursue this possibility.
to date there are intriguing hints in theoretical studies that strings may have further substructure, but
there is as yet no definitive evidence. only time and intense research will supply the final word on
this question.

pared with more familiar examples. this has three important consequences.

three consequences of stiff strings

first, whereas the ends of a violin or a piano string are pinned down, ensuring that they have a fixed
length, no analogous constraining frame pins down the size of a fundamental string. instead, the huge
string tension causes the loops of string theory to contract to a minuscule size. detailed calculation
reveals that being under planck tension translates into a typical string having planck length—10-33
centimeters—as previously mentioned.8

second, because of the enormous tension, the typical energy of a vibrating loop in string theory
is extremely high. to understand this, we note that the greater the tension a string is under, the harder
it is to get it to vibrate. for instance, it's far easier to pluck a violin string and set it vibrating than it is
to pluck a piano string. two strings, therefore, that are under different tension and are vibrating in
precisely the same way will n

nt paul mende showed that
when quantum mechanics is taken into account, continually increasing the energy of a string does not
continually increase its ability to probe finer structures, in direct contrast with what happens for a
point particle. they found that when the energy of a string is increased, it is at first able to probe
shorter-scale structures, just like an energetic point particle. but when its energy is increased beyond
the value required for probing structures on the scale of the planck length, the additional energy does
not sharpen the string probe. rather, the energy causes the string to grow in size, thereby diminishing
its short-distance sensitivity. in fact, although the size of a typical string is the planck length, if we
pumped enough energy into a string—an amount of energy beyond our wildest imaginings but one that
would likely have been attained by the big bang—we could cause it to grow to a macroscopic size, a
clumsy probe of the microcosmos indeed! it's as if a string

billionth of a meter. so long as an extra dimension is curled up to a size less than this tiny distance, it
is too small for us to detect. in 1926 klein combined kaluza's initial suggestion with some ideas from
the  emerging  field  of  quantum  mechanics.  his  calculations  indicated  that  the  additional  circular
dimension might be as small as the planck length, far shorter than experimental accessibility. since
then, physicists have called the possibility of extra tiny space dimensions kaluza-klein theory.2

the road to experiment

without monumental technological breakthroughs, we will never be able to focus on the tiny length
scales necessary to see a string directly. physicists can probe down to a billionth of a billionth of a
meter  with  accelerators  that  are  roughly  a  few  miles  in  size.  probing  smaller  distances  requires
higher energies and this means larger machines capable of focusing that energy on a single particle.
as the planck length is some 17 orders of magnitude smaller than what we can currently access, using
today's technology we would need an accelerator the size of the galaxy to see individual strings. in
fact,  shmuel  nussinov  of  tel  aviv  university  has  shown  that  this  rough  estimate  based  on
straightforward  scaling  is  likely  to  be  overly  optimistic;  his  more  careful  study  indicates  that  we
would require an accelerator the size of the whole universe. (the energy required to probe matter at

for string theory.

some longer shots

there are yet other ways in which evidence for string theory might be found. for example, witten has
pointed out the long-shot possibility that astronomers might one day see a direct signature of string
theory in the data they collect from observing the heavens. as encountered in chapter 6, the size of a
string is typically the planck length, but strings that are more energetic can grow substantially larger.
the energy of the big bang, in fact, would have been high enough to produce a few macroscopically
large  strings  that,  through  cosmic  expansion,  might  have  grown  to  astronomical  scales.  we  can

theory once again sets a lower limit to physically accessible distance scales and, in a remarkably
novel way, proclaims that the universe cannot be squeezed to a size shorter than the planck length in
any of its spatial dimensions.

based on the familiarity you now have with string theory, you might be tempted to hazard a guess
as to how this comes about. after all, you might argue that no matter how many points you pile up on

and is decreasing are absolutely identical to physical processes in which the circular dimension is
longer  than  the  planck  length  and  increasing!  this  means  that  as  the  circular  dimension  tries  to
collapse through the planck length and head toward ever smaller size, its attempts are made futile by

george  and  gracie,  after  being  flattened  out  into  two-dimensional  beings,  take  up  residence  as
physics professors in the garden-hose universe. after setting up their competing laboratories, each
claims  to  have  determined  the  size  of  the  circular  dimension.  surprisingly,  although  each  has  a
reputation  for  carrying  out  research  with  great  precision,  their  conclusions  do  not  agree.  george
claims that the circular radius is r = 10 times the planck length, while gracie claims that the circular
radius is r = 1/10 times the planck length.

"gracie,"  says  george,  "based  on  my  string  theory  calculations,  i  know  that  if  the  circular

three questions

at this point you might say, "look, if i was a little being in the garden-hose universe i would simply
measure the circumference of the hose with a tape measure and thereby unambiguously determine the
radius—no ifs, ands, or buts. so what is this nonsense about two indistinguishable possibilities with
different radii? furthermore, doesn't string theory do away with sub-planck distances, so why are we
even talking about circular dimensions with radii that are a fraction of the planck length? and finally,
while we are at it, who really cares about the two-dimensional garden-hose universe—what does all
this add up to when we include all dimensions?"

let's begin with the last question, as the answer will force us to come face to face with the first

two.

although our discussion has taken place in the garden-hose universe, we restricted ourselves to
one extended and one curled-up spatial dimension merely for simplicity. if we have three extended

off the deep end. how can this possibly be true? how can a six-foot tall human being "fit" inside such
an unbelievably microscopic universe? how can such a speck of a universe be physically identical to
the great expanse we view in the heavens? furthermore, we are now led forcefully to the second of
our initial three questions: string theory was supposed to eliminate the ability to probe sub-planck
distances. but if a circular dimension has radius r whose length is larger than the planck length, its
reciprocal 1/r is necessarily a fraction of the planck length. so what is going on? the answer, which
will also address the first of our three questions, highlights an important and subtle aspect of space
and distance.

two interrelated notions of distance in string theory

distance is such a basic concept in our understanding of the world that it is easy to underestimate the
depth of its subtlety. with the surprising effects that special and general relativity have had on our

 have  seen  that  wound  strings  have  minimum  energy
proportional  to r;  as  probes  of  distances  the  uncertainty  principle  tells  us  that  they  are  therefore
sensitive to the reciprocal of this value, 1/r. the mathematical embodiment of this idea shows that if
each  is  used  to  measure  the  radius  of  a  circular  dimension  of  space,  unwound  string  probes  will
measure r while wound strings will measure 1/r, where, as before, we are measuring distances in
multiples of the planck length. the result of each experiment has an equal claim to being the radius of
the circle—what we learn from string theory is that using different probes to measure distance can
result in different answers. in fact, this property extends to all measurements of lengths and distances,
not just to determining the size of a circular dimension. the results obtained by wound and unwound
string probes will be inversely related to one another.4

if string theory describes our universe, why have we not enco

operational definitions proves extremely difficult to carry out while the other proves extremely easy
to carry out. in essence, we have always carried out the easy approach, completely unaware of there
being another possibility.

the discrepancy in difficulty between the two approaches is due to the very different masses of
the  probes  used—high-winding-energy/low-vibration-energy,  and  vice  versa—if  the  radius r  (and
hence 1/r as well) differs significantly from the planck length (that is, r = 1). "high" energy here, for
radii  that  are  vastly  different  from  the  planck  length,  corresponds  to  incredibly  massive  probes—
billions and billions of times heavier than the proton, for instance—while "low" energy corresponds
to probe masses at most a speck above zero. in such circumstances, there is a monumental difference
in difficulty between the two approaches, since even producing the heavy-string configurations is an
undertaking that, at present, is beyond o

nforms and hence meshes with our intuition.

putting  issues  of  practicality  aside,  in  a  universe  governed  by  string  theory  one  is  free  to
measure  distances  using  either  of  the  two  approaches.  when  astronomers  measure  the  "size  of  the
universe" they do so by examining photons that have traveled across the cosmos and have happened to
enter their telescopes. no pun intended, photons are the light string modes in this situation. the result
obtained is the 1061 times the planck length quoted earlier. if the three familiar spatial dimensions are
in fact circular and string theory is right, astronomers using vastly different (and currently nonexistent)
equipment, in principle, should be able to measure the extent of the heavens with heavy wound-string
modes and find a result that is the reciprocal of this huge distance. it is in this sense that we can think
of the universe as being either huge, as we normally do, or terribly minute. according to the light

string  modes,  the

modes is asking a meaningless question—it's comparing apples and oranges. since we now have two
concepts of distance—using light or heavy string probes—we must compare measurements made in
the same manner.

a minimum size

it's been a bit of a trek, but we are now set for the key point. if one does stick to measuring distances
"the easy way"—that is, using the lightest of the string modes instead of the heavy ones—the results
obtained will always be larger than the planck length. to see this, let's think through the hypothetical
big crunch for the three extended dimensions, assuming them to be circular. for argument's sake, let's
say that at the beginning of our thought experiment, unwound string modes are the light ones and by
using them it is determined that the universe has an enormously large radius and that it is shrinking in
time. as it shrinks, these unwound modes get heavier and the winding modes get lighter. when the
radius shrinks all the way to the planck le

roaches to measuring distance become equally
difficult to carry out and, moreover, each would yield the same result since 1 is its own reciprocal.

as the radius continues to shrink, the winding modes become lighter than the unwound modes
and hence, since we are always opting for the "easier approach," they should now be used to measure
distances. according to this method of measurement, which yields the reciprocal of that measured by
the  unwound  modes, the radius is larger than one times the planck length and increasing.  this
simply reflects that as r—the quantity measured by unwound strings—shrinks to 1 and continues to
get smaller, 1/r—the quantity measured by wound strings—grows to 1 and gets larger. therefore, if
one takes care to always use the light string modes—the "easy" approach to measuring distance—the
minimal value encountered is the planck length.

in  particular,  a  big  crunch  to  zero  size  is  avoided,  as  the  radius  of  the  universe  as  measured
using light
 
 ___________________________
 
 string-mode probes is always larger than the planck length. rather than heading through the
planck length on to ever smaller size, the radius, as measured by the lightest string modes, decreases
to the planck length and then immediately starts to increase. the crunch is replaced by a bounce.

using light string modes to measure distances aligns with our conventional notion of length—the
one  that  was  around  long  before  the  discovery  of  string  theory.  it  is  according  to this  notion  of
distance, as seen in chapter 5, that we encountered insurmountable problems with violent quantum
undulations  if  sub-planck-scale  distances  play  a  physical  role.  we  once  again  see,  from  this
comple

a
concept  of  distance  that  meshes  with  both  our  intuition  and  with  general  relativity  when  distance
scales are large, but that differs from them dramatically when distance scales get small. specifically,
sub-planck-scale distances are inaccessible.

as this discussion is quite subtle, let's re-emphasize one central point. if we were to spurn the
distinction between "easy" and "hard" approaches to measuring length and, say, continue to use the
unwound modes as r shrinks through the planck length, it might seem that we would indeed be able to
encounter a sub-planck-length distance. but the paragraphs above inform us that the word "distance"
in the last sentence must be carefully interpreted, since it can have two different meanings, only one of
which conforms to our traditional notion. and in this case, when r shrinks to sub-planck length but
we continue to use the unwound strings (even though they have now become heavier than the wound
strings),  we  are  employing  the  "hard"  approa

ch  to  measuring  distance,  and  hence  the  meaning  of
"distance" does not conform to our standard usage. however, the discussion is far more than one of
semantics  or  even  of  convenience  or  practicality  of  measurement.  even  if  we  choose  to  use  the
nonstandard notion of distance and thereby describe the radius as being shorter than the planck length,
the physics we encounter—as discussed in previous sections—will be identical to that of a universe
in which the radius, in the conventional sense of distance, is larger than the planck length (as attested
to, for example, by the exact correspondence between tables 10.1 and 10.2). and it is physics, not
language, that really matters.

brandenberger, vafa, and other physicists have made use of these ideas to suggest a rewriting of

in the beginning there was a planck-sized nugget

in the late 1980s, robert brandenberger and cumrun vafa made the first important strides toward
understanding how the application of these string theoretic features modifies the conclusions of the
standard  cosmological  framework.  they  came  to  two  important  realizations.  first,  as  we  run  the
clock backward in time toward the beginning, the temperature continues to rise until the size of the
universe is about the planck length in all directions. but then, the temperature hits a maximum  and
begins to decrease. the intuitive reason behind this is not hard to come by. imagine for simplicity (as
brandenberger and vafa did) that all of the space dimensions of the universe are circular. as we run
the clock backward and the radius of each of these circles shrinks, the temperature of the universe
increases. but as each of the radii collapses toward and then through the planck length, we know that,
within string theory, this

 is physically identical to the radii shrinking to the planck length and then
bouncing  back  toward  increasing  size.  since  temperature  goes  down  as  the  universe  expands,  we
would  expect  that  the  futile  attempt  to  squeeze  the  universe  to  sub-planck  size  means  that  the
temperature stops rising, hits a maximum, and then begins to decrease. through detailed calculations,
brandenberger and vafa explicitly verified that indeed this is the case.

this led brandenberger and vafa to the following cosmological picture. in the beginning, all of

roughly the planck length. the temperature and energy are high, but not infinite, since string theory has

moment of the universe, all the spatial dimensions of string theory are on completely equal footing—
they  are  completely  symmetric—all  curled  up  into  a  multidimensional,  planck-sized  nugget.  then,

scales larger than the planck length, physicists have shown that our conventional notion of space does
re-emerge. it is likely that the framework of noncommutative geometry is still some significant steps
away  from  the  blank-slate  state  anticipated  above,  but  it  does  give  us  a  hint  of  what  the  more

we have seen glimpses of a strange new domain of the universe lurking beneath the planck length,
possibly one in which there is no notion of time or space. at the opposite extreme, we have also seen
that our universe may merely be one of the innumerable frothing bubbles on the surface of a vast and
turbulent cosmic ocean called the multiverse. these ideas are at the current edge of speculation, but
they may presage the next leap in our understanding of the universe.

infinite answers do not crop up, regardless of how extreme the physical system being analyzed might
be.

involves gravitational and spacetime inputs (g and c) and has a quantum mechanical dependence ( )
as well, it sets the scale for measurements—the natural unit of length—in any theory that attempts to
merge general relativity and quantum mechanics. when we use the term "planck length" in the text, it
is often meant in an approximate sense, indicating a length that is within a few orders of magnitude of
10–33 centimeters.

8. currently, in addition to string theory, two other approaches for merging general relativity and
quantum mechanics are being pursued vigorously. one approach is led by roger penrose of oxford
university and is known as twistor theory. the other approach—inspired in part by penrose's work
—is  led  by abhay ashtekar  of  pennsylvania  state  univer

fact that the energies are of the form v/r +

wr, where v is the vibration number and w is the winding number. this equation is invariant under the
simultaneous  interchange  of v  and w  as  well  as r and 1/r—i.e., under the interchange of vibration
and winding numbers and inversion of the radius. in our discussion we are working in planck units,
but we can work in more conventional units by rewriting the energy formula in terms of  —the so-
called string scale—whose value is about the planck length, 10-33 centimeter. we can then express
string energies as v/r + wr/
/r,
where the latter two are now expressed in terms of conventional units of distance.

4. you  may  be  wondering  how  it's  possible  for  a  string  that  stretches  all  the  way  around  a
circular dimension of radius r to nevertheless measure the radius to be 1/r. although a thoroughly
justifiable concern, its resolution actually lies in the imprecise p

planck energy. about 1,000 kilowatt hours. the energy necessary to probe to distances as small as
the planck length. the typical energy of a vibrating string in string theory.
planck length. about 10-33 centimeters. the scale below which quantum fluctuations in the fabric of
spacetime would become enormous. the size of a typical string in string theory.
planck  mass.  about  ten  billion  billion  times  the  mass  of  a proton;  about  one-hundredth  of  a

noted  by  the  symbol h,  planck's  constant  is  a  fundamental  parameter  in
quantum mechanics. it determines the size of the discrete units of energy, mass, spin, etc. into which
the microscopic world is partitioned. its value is 1.05 × 10-27 grams-cm/sec.
planck tension. about 1039 tons. the tension on a typical string in string theory.
planck time. about 10-43 seconds. time at which the size of the universe was roughly the planck
