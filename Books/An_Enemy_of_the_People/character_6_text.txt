mrs. stockmann. you see, if you come an hour late, mr. billing, you have to put up with cold meat.

billing (as he eats). it is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.

billing. that doesn't affect me a bit. indeed, i almost think i enjoy a meal all the better when i can sit down and eat all by myself, and undisturbed.

mrs. stockmann. oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. (turns to the hall door, listening.) i expect that is mr. hovstad coming too.

billing. very likely.

(peter stockmann comes in. he wears an overcoat and his official hat, and carries a stick.)

peter stockmann. good evening, katherine.

mrs. stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). ah, good evening—is it you? how good of you to come up and see us!

peter stockmann. i happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the dining-room). but you have company with you, i see.

mrs. stockmann (coming from the dining-room). has he gone?

dr. stockmann. yes, and in such a bad temper.

mrs. stockmann. but, dear thomas, what have you been doing to him again?

dr. stockmann. nothing at all. and, anyhow, he can't oblige me to make my report before the proper time.

mrs. stockmann. what have you got to make a report to him about?

dr. stockmann. hm! leave that to me, katherine. it is an extraordinary thing that the postman doesn't come.

(hovstad, billing and horster have got up from the table and come into the sitting-room. ejlif and morten come in after them.)

billing (stretching himself). ah!—one feels a new man after a meal like that.

hovstad. the mayor wasn't in a very sweet temper tonight, then.

dr. stockmann. it is his stomach; he has wretched digestion.

hovstad. i rather think it was us two of the "people's messenger" that he couldn't digest.

mrs. stockmann. i thought you came out of it pretty well with him.

hovstad. oh yes; but

dr. stockmann. we must remember that peter is a lonely man, poor chap. he has no home comforts of any kind; nothing but everlasting business. and all that infernal weak tea wash that he pours into himself! now then, my boys, bring chairs up to the table. aren't we going to have that toddy, katherine?

mrs. stockmann (who sits knitting). do you sail soon, captain horster?

horster. i expect to be ready to sail next week.

mrs. stockmann. i suppose you are going to america?

horster. yes, that is the plan.

mrs. stockmann. then you won't be able to take part in the coming election?

horster. is there going to be an election?

billing. didn't you know?

horster. no, i don't mix myself up with those things.

billing. but do you not take an interest in public affairs?

horster. no, i don't know anything about politics.

billing. all the same, one ought to vote, at any rate.

horster. even if one doesn't know anything about what is going on?

billing. doesn't know! what do you mean by that? a community is like a ship; everyone ought to be prepared to take the helm.

horster. maybe that is all very well on shore; but on board sh

hovstad. it is astonishing how little most sailors care about what goes on on shore.

billing. very extraordinary.

dr. stockmann. sailors are like birds of passage; they feel equally at home in any latitude. and that is only an additional reason for our being all the more keen, hovstad. is there to be anything of public interest in tomorrow's "messenger"?

hovstad. nothing about municipal affairs. but the day after tomorrow i was thinking of printing your article—

dr. stockmann. ah, devil take it—my article! look here, that must wait a bit.

dr. stockmann. good evening, petra; come along.

(mutual greetings; petra takes off her things and puts them down on a chair by the door.)

petra. and you have all been sitting here enjoying yourselves, while i have been out slaving!

dr. stockmann. well, come and enjoy yourself too!

billing. may i mix a glass for you?

petra (coming to the table). thanks, i would rather do it; you always mix it too strong. but i forgot, father—i have a letter for you. (goes to the chair where she has laid her things.)

dr. stockmann. a letter? from whom?

petra (looking in her coat pocket). the postman gave it to me just as i was going out.

dr. stockmann (getting up and going to her). and you only give to me now!

petra. i really had not time to run up again. there it is!

dr. stockmann. yes, it is. i must go to my room now and— where shall i get a light, katherine? is there no lamp in my room again?

mrs. stockmann. yes, your lamp is already lit on your desk.

dr. stockmann. good, good. excuse me for a moment—, (goes into his study.)

petra. what do you suppose it is, mother?

mrs. stockmann. i don't know; for the last day or two he has always been asking if the postman has not been.

billing. probably some country patient.

petra. poor old dad!—he will overwork himself soon. (mixes a glass for herself.) there, that will taste good!

hovstad. have you been teaching in the evening school again today?

petra (sipping from her glass). two hours.

billing. and four hours of school in the morning?

petra. five hours.

mrs. stockmann. and you have still got exercises to correct, i see.

petra. a whole heap, yes.

horster. you are pretty full up with work too, it seems to me.

petra. yes

billing. do you like that?

petra. yes, because one sleeps so well then.

morten. you must be dreadfully wicked, petra.

petra. wicked?

morten. yes, because you work so much. mr. rorlund says work is a punishment for our sins.

ejlif. pooh, what a duffer, you are, to believe a thing like that!

mrs. stockmann. come, come, ejlif!

billing (laughing). that's capital!

hovstad. don't you want to work as hard as that, morten?

morten. no, indeed i don't.

hovstad. what do you want to be, then?

morten. i should like best to be a viking,

ejlif. you would have to be a pagan then.

morten. well, i could become a pagan, couldn't i?

billing. i agree with you, morten! my sentiments, exactly.

mrs. stockmann (signalling to him). i am sure that is not true, mr. billing.

billing. yes, i swear it is! i am a pagan, and i am proud of it. be

mrs. stockmann. you must go to your room now, boys; i am sure you have some lessons to learn for tomorrow.

ejlif. i should like so much to stay a little longer—

mrs. stockmann. no, no; away you go, both of you, (the boys say good night and go into the room on the left.)

hovstad. do you really think it can do the boys any harm to hear such things?

mrs. stockmann. i don't know; but i don't like it.

petra. but you know, mother, i think you really are wrong about

mrs. stockmann. maybe, but i don't like it—not in our own home.

petra. there is so much falsehood both at home and at school. at home one must not speak, and at school we have to stand and tell lies to the children.

horster. tell lies?

petra. yes, don't you suppose we have to teach them all sorts of things that we don't believe?

billing. that is perfectly true.

petra. if only i had the means, i would start a school of my own; and it would be conducted on very different lines.

billing. oh, bother the means—!

horster. well if you are thinking of that, miss stockmann, i shall be delighted to provide you with a schoolroom. the great big old house my father left me is standing almost empty; there is an immense dining-room downstairs—

petra (laughing). thank you very much; but i am afraid nothing will come of it.

hovstad. no, miss petra is much more likely to take to journalism, i expect. by the way, have you had time to do anything with that english story you promised to

dr. stockmann (waving the letter). well, now the town will have something new to talk about, i can tell you!

billing. something new?

mrs. stockmann. what is this?

dr. stockmann. a great discovery, katherine.

hovstad. really?

mrs. stockmann. a discovery of yours?

dr. stockmann. a discovery of mine. (walks up and down.) just let them come saying, as usual, that it is all fancy and a crazy man's imagination! but they will be careful what they say this time, i can tell you!

dr. stockmann. yes, yes—only give me time, and you shall know all about it. if only i had pe

mrs. stockmann. yes, but my dear thomas—

dr. stockmann. and we have been recommending it and praising it—i have written and written, both in the "messenger" and in pamphlets...

hovstad. well, what then?

dr. stockmann. and the baths—we have called them the "main artery of the town's life-blood," the "nerve-centre of our town," and the devil knows what else—

billing. "the town's pulsating heart" was the expression i once used on an important occasion.

dr. stockmann. quite so. well, do you know what they really are, these great, splendid, much praised baths, that have cost so much money—do you know what they are?

hovstad. no, what are they?

mrs. stockmann. yes, what are they?

dr. stockmann. the whole place is a pest-house!

petra. the baths, father?

mrs. stockmann (at the same time), our baths?

hovstad. but, doctor—

billing. absolutely incredible

dr. stockmann. what is there for him to say? i should think he would be very glad that such an important truth has been brought to light.

hovstad. will you let me print a short note about your discovery in the "messenger?"

dr. stockmann. i shall be very much obliged if you will.

hovstad. it is very desirable that the public should be informed of it without delay.

dr. stockmann. certainly.

mrs. stockmann (coming back). she has just gone with it.

billing. upon my soul, doctor, you are going to be the foremost man in the town!

dr. stockmann (walking about happily). nonsense! as a matter of
fact i have done nothing more than my duty. i have only made a lucky find—that's all. still, all the same...

billing. hovstad, don't you think the town ought to give dr. stockmann some sort of testimonial?

hovstad. i will suggest it, anyway.

billing. and i will speak to aslaksen about it.

dr. stockmann. no, my good friends, don't let us have any of that

mrs. stockmann. you are quite right, thomas.

petra (lifting her glass). your health, father!

hovstad and billing. your health, doctor! good health!

horster (touches glasses with dr. stockmann). i hope it will bring you nothing but good luck.

dr. stockmann. thank you, thank you, my dear fellows! i feel tremendously happy! it is a splendid thing for a man to be able to feel that he has done a service to his native town and to his fellow-citizens. hurrah, katherine!

hovstad (to the doctor). you see!

dr. stockmann. i shall be very grateful to you, but—

hovstad (still writing). have you read it through?

billing (laying the ms. on the desk). yes, indeed i have.

hovstad. don't you think the doctor hits them pretty hard?

hovstad. yes, but they are not the people to throw up the sponge at the first blow.

hovstad. yes, and if the mayor doesn't like it—

billing. that will be the devil of a nuisance.

hovstad. well, fortunately we can turn the situation to good account, whatever happens. if the mayor will not fall in with the doctor's project, he will have all the small tradesmen down on him—the

 whole of the householders' association and the rest of them. and if he does fall in with it, he will fall out with the whole crowd of large shareholders in the baths, who up to now have been his most valuable supporters—

billing. yes, because they will certainly have to fork out a pretty penny—

hovstad. yes, you may be sure they will. and in this way the ring will be broken up, you see, and then in every issue of the paper we will enlighten the public on the mayor's incapability on one point and another, and make it clear that all the positions of trust in the town, the whole control of municipal affairs, ought to be put in the hands of the liberals.

dr. stockmann. you may set to work and print it, mr. hovstad!

hovstad. has it come to that, then?

billing. hurrah!

dr. stockmann. yes, print away. undoubtedly it has come to that. now they must take what they get. there is going to be a fight in the town, mr. billing!

billing. war to the knife, i hope! we will get our knives to their throats, doctor!

dr. stockmann. this article is only a beginning. i have already got four or five more sketched out in my head. where is aslaksen?

billing (calls into the printing-room). aslaksen, just come here for a minute!

hovstad. four or five more articles, did you say? on the same subject?

dr. stockmann. no—far from it, my dear fellow. no, they are about quite another matter. but they all spring from the question of the wate

aslaksen (coming in). pulled down? you are not thinking of pulling down the baths surely, doctor?

hovstad. far from it, don't be afraid.

dr. stockmann. no, we meant something quite different. well, what do you think of my article, mr. hovstad?

hovstad. i think it is simply a masterpiece.

dr. stockmann. do you really think so? well, i am very pleased, very pleased.

hovstad. it is so clear and

aslaksen. and every prudent man too, i hope?

billing. the prudent and the imprudent—almost the whole town.

aslaksen. in that case we may venture to print it.

dr. stockmann. i should think so!

hovstad. we will put it in tomorrow morning.

dr. stockmann. of course—you must not lose a single day. what i wanted to ask you, mr. aslaksen, was if you would supervise the printing of it yourself.

aslaksen. with pleasure.

dr. stockmann. take care of it as if it were a treasure! no misprints—every word is important. i will look in again a little

billing. burst upon them—yes, like a flash of lightning!

dr. stockmann. —and to have it submitted to the judgment of my intelligent fellow townsmen. you cannot imagine what i have gone through today. i have been threatened first with one thing and then with another; they have tried to rob me of my most elementary rights as a man—

billing. what! your rights as a man!

dr. stockmann. —they have tried to degrade me, to make a coward of me, to force me to put personal interests before my most sacred convictions.

billing. that is too much—i'm damned if it isn't.

hovstad. oh, you mustn't be surprised at anything from that quarter.

dr. stockmann. well, they will get the worst of it with me; they may assure themselves of that. i shall consider the "people's messenger" my sheet-anchor now, and every single day i will bombard them

dr. stockmann. i shall smite them to the ground—i shall crush them—i shall break down all their defenses, before the eyes of the honest public! that is what i shall do!

aslaksen, yes, but in moderation, doctor—proceed with moderation.

billing. not a bit of it, not a bit of it! don't spare the dynamite!

dr. stockmann. because it is not merely a question of water-supply and drains now, you know. no—it is the whole of our social life that we have got to purify and disinfect—

billing. spoken like a deliverer!

dr. stockmann. all the incapables must be turned out, you understand—and that in every walk of life! endless vistas have opened themselves to my mind's eye today. i cannot see it all quite clearly yet, but i shall in time.

hovstad. for my part i think we have now a prospect of getting the municipal authority into the hands where it should lie.

billing. take my word for it, aslaksen, dr. stockmann is a friend of the people.

aslaksen. i fancy the householders' association will make use of that expression before long.

dr. stockmann (affected, grasps their hands). thank you, thank you, my dear staunch friends. it is very refreshing to me to hear you say that; my brother called me something quite different. by jove, he shall have it back, with interest! but now i must be off to see a poor devil—i will come back, as i said. keep a very careful

hovstad. he may prove an invaluably useful man to us.

aslaksen. yes, so long as he confines himself to this matter of the baths. but if he goes farther afield, i don't think it would be advisable to follow him.

hovstad. hm!—that all depends—

billing. you are so infernally timid, aslaksen!

aslaksen. timid? yes, when it is a question of the local authorities, i am timid, mr. billing; it is a lesson i have learned in the school of experience, let me tell you. but try me in higher politics, in matters that concern the government itself, and then see if i am timid.

billing. no, you aren't, i admit. but this is simply contradicting yourself.

aslaksen. i am a man with a conscience, and that is the whole matter. if you attack the government, yo

hovstad. but what of the education of citizens by self government—don't you attach any importance to that?

aslaksen. when a man has interests of his own to protect, he cannot think of everything, mr. hovstad.

hovstad. then i hope i shall never have interests of my own to protect!

billing. hear, hear!

aslaksen (with a smile). hm! (points to the desk.) mr. sheriff stensgaard was your predecessor at that editorial desk.

billing (spitting). bah! that turncoat.

hovstad. i am not a weathercock—and never will be.

aslaksen. a politician should never be too certain of anything, mr. hovstad. and as for you, mr. billing, i should think it is time for you to be taking in a reef or two in your sails, seeing that you are applying for the post of secretary to the bench.

billing. oughtn't we to try and get rid of him, hovstad?

hovstad. do you know anyone else who will advance the money for our paper and printing bill?

billing. it is an infernal nuisance that we don't possess some capital to trade on.

hovstad (sitting down at his desk). yes, if we only had that, then—

billing. suppose you were to apply to dr. stockmann?

hovstad (turning over some papers). what is the use? he has got nothing.

billing. no, but he has got a warm man in the background, old morten kiil—"the badger," as they call him.

hovstad (writing). are you so sure he has got anything?

billing. good lord, of course he has! and some of it must come to the stockmanns. most probably he will do something for the children, at all events.

billing. do you think i am not quite aware of that? my object is precisely not to get it. a slight of that kind stimulates a man's fighting power—it is like getting a supply of fresh bile—and i am sure one needs that badly enough in a hole-and-corner place like this, where it is so seldom anything happens to stir one up.

hovstad (writing). quite so, quite so.

billing. ah, i shall be heard of yet!—now i shall go and write the appeal to the householders' association. (goes into the room on the right.)

petra. for shame! you would never go and set a snare like that for your readers; you are not a spider!

hovstad (smiling). thank you for having such a good opinion of me. no; as a matter of fact that is billing's idea and not mine.

hovstad. oh, billing is a many-sided man. he is applying for the post of secretary to the bench, too, i hear.

ckmann. ran away without his stick or his—. fiddlesticks! peter doesn't run away and leave his belongings behind him. but what the deuce have you done with him? ah!—in there, of course. now you shall see, katherine!

mrs. stockmann. thomas—please don't—!

aslaksen. don't be rash, doctor.

(dr. stockmann has put on the mayor's hat and taken his stick in his hand. he goes up to the door, opens it, and stands with his hand to his hat at the salute. peter stockmann comes in, red with anger. billing follows him.)

peter stockmann. what does this tomfoolery mean?

dr. stockmann. be respectful, my good peter. i am the chief authority in the town now. (walks up and down.)

mrs. stockmann (almost in tears). really, thomas!

peter stockmann (following him about). give me my hat and stick.

dr. stockmann (in the same tone as before). if you are chief constable, let me tell you that i am the mayor—i am the master of the whole town, please understand!

peter stockmann. take off my hat, i tell yo

u. remember it is part of an official uniform.

dr. stockmann. pooh! do you think the newly awakened lionhearted people are going to be frightened by an official hat? there is going to be a revolution in the town tomorrow, let me tell you. you thought you could turn me out; but now i shall turn you out—turn you out of all your various offices. do you think i cannot? listen to me. i have triumphant social forces behind me. hovstad and billing will thunder in the "people's messenger," and aslaksen will take the field at the head of the whole householders' association—

aslaksen. that i won't, doctor.

dr. stockmann. of course you will—

peter stockmann. ah!—may i ask then if mr. hovstad intends to join this agitation?

hovstad. no, mr. mayor.

aslaksen. no, mr. hovstad is not such a fool as to go and ruin his paper and himself for the sake of an imaginary grievance.

dr. stockmann (looking round him). what does this mean?

tad. you have represented your case in a false light, doctor, and therefore i am unable to give you my support.

billing. and after what the mayor was so kind as to tell me just now, i—

dr. stockmann. a false light! leave that part of it to me. only print my article; i am quite capable of defending it.

hovstad. i am not going to print it. i cannot and will not and dare not print it.

dr. stockmann. you dare not? what nonsense!—you are the editor; and an editor controls his paper, i suppose!

aslaksen. no, it is the subscribers, doctor.

peter stockmann. fortunately, yes.

aslaksen. it is public opinion—th

pinion. you will not get it printed anywhere in the town.

dr. stockmann. then give it me back.

hovstad (giving him the ms.). here it is.

dr. stockmann (taking his hat and stick). it shall be made public all the same. i will read it out at a mass meeting of the townspeople. all my fellow-citizens shall hear the voice of truth!

peter stockmann. you will not find any public body in the town that will give you the use of their hall for such a purpose.

aslaksen. not a single one, i am certain.

billing. no, i'm damned if you will find one.

mrs. stockmann. but this is too shameful! why should every one turn against you like that?

dr. stockmann (angrily). i will tell you why. it is because all the men in this town are old women—like you; they all think of nothing but their families, and never of the community.

mrs. stockmann (putting her arm into his). then i will show them that an old woman can be a man for once. i am going to stand by you, thomas!

dr. stockmann. bravely said, katherine!

 it shall be made public—as i am a living soul! if i can't hire a hall, i shall hire a drum, and parade the town with it and read it at every street-corner.

peter stockmann. you are surely not such an errant fool as that!

dr. stockmann. yes, i am.

aslaksen. you won't find a single man in the whole town to go with you.

billing. no, i'm damned if you will.

mrs. stockmann. don't give in, thomas. i will tell the boys to go with you.

dr. stockmann. that is a splendid idea!

mrs. stockmann. morten will be delighted; and ejlif will do whatever he does.

dr. stockmann. yes, and petra!—and you too, katherine!

mrs. stockmann. no, i won't do that; but i will stand at the window and watch you, that's what i will do.

dr. stockmann (puts his arms round her and kisses her). thank you, my dear! now you and i are going to try

nn. for various reasons, which you will easily understand, i must beg to be excused. but fortunately we have amongst us a man who i think will be acceptable to you all. i refer to the president of the householders' association, mr. aslaksen.

several voices. yes—aslaksen! bravo aslaksen!

(dr. stockmann takes up his ms. and walks up and down the platform.)

aslaksen. since my fellow-citizens choose to entrust me with this duty, i cannot refuse.

(loud applause. aslaksen mounts the platform.)

billing (writing), "mr. aslaksen was elected with enthusiasm."

aslaksen. and now, as i am in this position, i should like to say a few brief words. i am a quiet and peaceable man, who believes in discreet moderation, and—and—in moderate discretion. all my friends can bear witness to that.

several voices. that's right! that's right, aslaksen!

aslaksen. i have learned in the school of life and experience that moderation is the most valuable virtue a citizen can possess—

ay from here; and exile, longing and memories cast as it were an additional halo over both the town and its inhabitants. (some clapping and applause.) and there i stayed, for many years, in a horrible hole far away up north. when i came into contact with some of the people that lived scattered about among the rocks, i often thought it would of been more service to the poor half-starved creatures if a veterinary doctor had been sent up there, instead of a man like me. (murmurs among the crowd.)

billing (laying down his pen). i'm damned if i have ever heard—!

hovstad. it is an insult to a respectable population!

dr. stockmann. wait a bit! i do not think anyone will charge me with having forgotten my native town up there. i was like one of the eider-ducks brooding on its nest, and what i hatched was the plans for these baths. (applause and protests.) and then when fate at last decreed for me the great happiness of coming home again—i assure you, gentlemen, i thought i had nothing more in

e most dangerous enemy of truth and freedom amongst us is the compact majority—yes, the damned compact liberal majority—that is it! now you know! (tremendous uproar. most of the crowd are shouting, stamping and hissing. some of the older men among them exchange stolen glances and seem to be enjoying themselves. mrs. stockmann gets up, looking anxious. ejlif and morten advance threateningly upon some schoolboys who are playing pranks. aslaksen rings his bell and begs for silence. hovstad and billing both talk at once, but are inaudible. at last quiet is restored.)

aslaksen. as chairman, i call upon the speaker to withdraw the ill-considered expressions he has just used.

dr. stockmann. never, mr. aslaksen! it is the majority in our community that denies me my freedom and seeks to prevent my speaking the truth.

hovstad. the majority always has right on its side.

billing. and truth too, by god!

dr. stockmann. the majority never has right on its side. never, i say! that is one of these so

hovstad. and that is—?

dr. stockmann. that is, the doctrine you have inherited from your forefathers and proclaim thoughtlessly far and wide—the doctrine that the public, the crowd, the masses, are the essential part of the population—that they constitute the people—that the common folk, the ignorant and incomplete element in the community, have the same right to pronounce judgment and to, approve, to direct and to govern, as the isolated, intellectually superior personalities in it.

billing. well, damn me if ever i—

hovstad (at the same time, shouting out). fellow-citizens, take good note of that!

a number of voices (angrily). oho!—we are not the people! only the superior folk are to govern, are they!

a workman. turn the fellow out for talking such rubbish!

another. out with him!

another (calling out). blow your horn, evensen!

(a horn is blown loudly, amidst hisses and an angry uproar.)

dr. stockmann (when the noise has somewhat abated). be reasonable! can't you stand h

atter, if it lives on lies? it ought to be razed to the ground. i tell you— all who live by lies ought to be exterminated like vermin! you will end by infecting the whole country; you will bring about such a state of things that the whole country will deserve to be ruined. and if things come to that pass, i shall say from the bottom of my heart: let the whole country perish, let all these people be exterminated!

voices from the crowd. that is talking like an out-and-out enemy of the people!

billing. there sounded the voice of the people, by all that's holy!

the whole crowd (shouting). yes, yes! he is an enemy of the people! he hates his country! he hates his own people!

aslaksen. both as a citizen and as an individual, i am profoundly disturbed by what we have had to listen to. dr. stockmann has shown himself in a light i should never have dreamed of. i am unhappily obliged to subscribe to the opinion which i have just heard my estimable fellow-citizens utter; and i propose that we shou

e. a number of men surround the doctor and hiss him. mrs. stockmann and petra have got up from their seats. morten and ejlif are fighting the other schoolboys for hissing; some of their elders separate them.)

dr. stockmann (to the men who are hissing him). oh, you fools! i tell you that—

aslaksen (ringing his bell). we cannot hear you now, doctor. a formal vote is about to be taken; but, out of regard for personal feelings, it shall be by ballot and not verbal. have you any clean paper, mr. billing?

billing. i have both blue and white here.

aslaksen (going to him). that will do nicely; we shall get on more quickly that way. cut it up into small strips—yes, that's it. (to the meeting.) blue means no; white means yes. i will come round myself and collect votes. (peter stockmann leaves the hall. aslaksen and one or two others go round the room with the slips of paper in their hats.)

1st citizen (to hovstad). i say, what has come to the doctor? what are we to think of it?

hovstad. oh, y

ou know how headstrong he is.

2nd citizen (to billing). billing, you go to their house—have you ever noticed if the fellow drinks?

billing. well i'm hanged if i know what to say. there are always spirits on the table when you go.

3rd citizen. i rather think he goes quite off his head sometimes.

1st citizen. i wonder if there is any madness in his family?

billing. i shouldn't wonder if there were.

4th citizen. no, it is nothing more than sheer malice; he wants to get even with somebody for something or other.

billing. well certainly he suggested a rise in his salary on one occasion lately, and did not get it.

the citizens (together). ah!—then it is easy to understand how it is!

the drunken man (who has got among the audience again). i want a blue one, i do! and i want a white one too!

voices. it's that drunken chap again! turn him out!

the votes of every one here except one person—

a young man. that is the drunk chap!

aslaksen. by the votes of everyone here except a tipsy man, this meeting of citizens declares dr. thomas stockmann to be an enemy of the people. (shouts and applause.) three cheers for our ancient and honourable citizen community! (renewed applause.) three cheers for our able and energetic mayor, who has so loyally suppressed the promptings of family feeling! (cheers.) the meeting is dissolved. (gets down.)

billing. three cheers for the chairman!

the whole crowd. three cheers for aslaksen! hurrah!

dr. stockmann. my hat and coat, petra! captain, have you room on your ship for passengers to the new world?

horster. for you and yours we will make room, doctor.

dr. stockmann (as petra helps him into his coat), good. come, katherine! come, boys!

mrs. stockmann (in an undertone). thomas, dear, let us go out by the back way.

dr. stockmann. no back ways for me, katherine, (raising his voice.) you will hear m

ore of this enemy of the people, before he shakes the dust off his shoes upon you! i am not so forgiving as a certain person; i do not say: "i forgive you, for ye know not what ye do."

aslaksen (shouting). that is a blasphemous comparison, dr. stockmann!

billing. it is, by god! it's dreadful for an earnest man to listen to.

a coarse voice. threatens us now, does he!

other voices (excitedly). let's go and break his windows! duck him in the fjord!

another voice. blow your horn, evensen! pip, pip!

(horn-blowing, hisses, and wild cries. dr. stockmann goes out through the hall with his family, horster elbowing a way for them.)
