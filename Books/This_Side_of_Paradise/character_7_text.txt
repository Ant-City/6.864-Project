the gray-eyed man decided to introduce himself.

â€œmy nameâ€™s holiday.â€

â€œblaineâ€™s my name.â€

they shook hands with the fashionable low swoop. amory grinned.

â€œwhereâ€™d you prep?â€

â€œandover--where did you?â€

â€œst. regisâ€™s.â€

â€œoh, did you? i had a cousin there.â€

they discussed the cousin thoroughly, and then holiday announced that he
was to meet his brother for dinner at six.

â€œcome along and have a bite with us.â€

â€œall right.â€

at the kenilworth amory met burne holiday--he of the gray eyes was
kerry--and during a limpid meal of thin soup and anaemic vegetables they
stared at the other freshmen, who sat either in small groups looking
very ill at ease, or in large groups seeming very much at home.

â€œi hear commons is pretty bad,â€ said amory.

â€œthatâ€™s the rumor. but youâ€™ve got to eat there--or pay anyways.â€

â€œcrime!â€

â€œimposition!â€

â€œoh, at princeton youâ€™ve got to swallow everything the first year. itâ€™s
like a damned prep school.â€

he following year, but spring was too rare to
let anything interfere with their colorful ramblings. in may amory was
elected to the sophomore prom committee, and when after a long
eveningâ€™s discussion with alec they made out a tentative list of class
probabilities for the senior council, they placed themselves among the
surest. the senior council was composed presumably of the eighteen most
representative seniors, and in view of alecâ€™s football managership and
amoryâ€™s chance of nosing out burne holiday as princetonian chairman,
they seemed fairly justified in this presumption. oddly enough, they
both placed dâ€™invilliers as among the possibilities, a guess that a year
before the class would have gaped at.

all through the spring amory had kept up an intermittent correspondence
with isabelle borge, punctuated by violent squabbles and chiefly
enlivened by his attempts to find new words for love. he discovered
isabelle to be discreetly and aggravatingly unsentimental in letters,
but he hoped ag

â€œquestâ€ book the hero set off in life armed with the best weapons and
avowedly intending to use them as such weapons are usually used, to push
their possessors ahead as selfishly and blindly as possible, but the
heroes of the â€œquestâ€ books discovered that there might be a more
magnificent use for them. â€œnone other gods,â€ â€œsinister street,â€ and â€œthe
research magnificentâ€ were examples of such books; it was the latter
of these three that gripped burne holiday and made him wonder in the
beginning of senior year how much it was worth while being a diplomatic
autocrat around his club on prospect avenue and basking in the high
lights of class office. it was distinctly through the channels of
aristocracy that burne found his way. amory, through kerry, had had a
vague drifting acquaintance with him, but not until january of senior
year did their friendship commence.

 air he always wore after a successful conversational
bout.

â€œno. somebody flunked out? or another ship sunk?â€

â€œworse than that. about one-third of the junior class are going to
resign from their clubs.â€

â€œwhat!â€

â€œactual fact!â€

â€œwhy!â€

â€œspirit of reform and all that. burne holiday is behind it. the club
presidents are holding a meeting to-night to see if they can find a
joint means of combating it.â€

â€œwell, whatâ€™s the idea of the thing?â€

â€œoh, clubs injurious to princeton democracy; cost a lot; draw social
lines, take time; the regular line you get sometimes from disappointed
sophomores. woodrow thought they should be abolished and all that.â€

â€œbut this is the real thing?â€

â€œabsolutely. i think itâ€™ll go through.â€

launched into argument with tom, he looked at this revolutionary
more carefully than he ever had before. broad-browed and strong-chinned,
with a fineness in the honest gray eyes that were like kerryâ€™s,
burne was a man who gave an immediate impression of bigness and
security--stubborn, that was evident, but his stubbornness wore no
stolidity, and when he had talked for five minutes amory knew that this
keen enthusiasm had in it no quality of dilettantism.

the intense power amory felt later in burne holiday differed from the
admiration he had had for humbird. this time it began as purely a
mental interest. with other men of whom he had thought as primarily
first-class, he had been attracted first by their personalities, and
in burne he missed that immediate magnetism to which he usually
swore allegiance. but that night amory was struck by burneâ€™s intense
earnestness, a quality he was accustomed to associate only with the
dread stupidity, and by the great enthusiasm that struck dead chords in

and the â€˜kreutzer sonataâ€™ of course, but tolstoi is mostly in the
original russian as far as iâ€™m concerned.â€

â€œheâ€™s the greatest man in hundreds of years,â€ cried burne
enthusiastically. â€œdid you ever see a picture of that shaggy old head of
his?â€

they talked until three, from biology to organized religion, and when
amory crept shivering into bed it was with his mind aglow with ideas
and a sense of shock that some one else had discovered the path he might
have followed. burne holiday was so evidently developing--and amory
had considered that he was doing the same. he had fallen into a deep
cynicism over what had crossed his path, plotted the imperfectability of
man and read shaw and chesterton enough to keep his mind from the edges
of decadence--now suddenly all his mental processes of the last year and
a half seemed stale and futile--a petty consummation of himself... and
like a sombre background lay that incident of the spring before, that
filled half his nights with a dr

â€œi do,â€ amory admitted.

â€œwell, i began analyzing it--my imagination persisted in sticking
horrors into the dark--so i stuck my imagination into the dark instead,
and let it look out at me--i let it play stray dog or escaped convict
or ghost, and then saw myself coming along the road. that made it all
right--as it always makes everything all right to project yourself
completely into anotherâ€™s place. i knew that if i were the dog or the
convict or the ghost i wouldnâ€™t be a menace to burne holiday any more
than he was a menace to me. then i thought of my watch. iâ€™d better go
back and leave it and then essay the woods. no; i decided, itâ€™s
better on the whole that i should lose a watch than that i should turn
back--and i did go into them--not only followed the road through them,
but walked into them until i wasnâ€™t frightened any more--did it until
one night i sat down and dozed off in there; then i knew i was through
being afraid of the dark.â€

before you get this letter i shall be on the ocean; then will come your

blustering and tremulo-heroism to the middle classes; they do it so much
better.

do you remember that week-end last march when you brought burne holiday
from princeton to see me? what a magnificent boy he is! it gave me a
frightful shock afterward when you wrote that he thought me splendid;
how could he be so deceived? splendid is the one thing that neither you
nor i are. we are many other things--weâ€™re extraordinary, weâ€™re clever,
we could be said, i suppose, to be brilliant. we can attract people,
we can make atmosphere, we can almost lose our celtic souls in celtic

once he had been miraculously able to scent evil as a horse detects a
broken bridge at night, but the man with the queer feet in phoebeâ€™s
room had diminished to the aura over jill. his instinct perceived the
fetidness of poverty, but no longer ferreted out the deeper evils in
pride and sensuality.

there were no more wise men; there were no more heroes; burne holiday
was sunk from sight as though he had never lived; monsignor was dead.
amory had grown up to a thousand books, a thousand lies; he had listened
eagerly to people who pretended to know, who knew nothing. the mystical
reveries of saints that had once filled him with awe in the still hours
of night, now vaguely repelled him. the byrons and brookes who had
defied life from mountain tops were in the end but flaneurs and poseurs,
at best mistaking the shadow of courage for the substance of wisdom.
