[CHARACTER] - 
      the protagonist of the play. [CHARACTER]'s name means "the fox" in italian. he is lustful, lecherous, and greedy for pleasure. he is also energetic and has an unusual gift for rhetoric, mixing the sacred and the profane to enunciate a passionate commitment to self-gratification. he worships his money, all of which he has acquired through cons, such as the one he now plays on voltore, corbaccio, and corvino. [CHARACTER] has no children, but he has something of a family: his parasite, mosca, his dwarf, nano, his eunuch, castrone, and his hermaphrodite, androgyno. mosca is his only true confidante, and he begins to lust feverishly after celia upon first setting eyes on her.
