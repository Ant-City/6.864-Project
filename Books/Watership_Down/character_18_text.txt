but he's getting old. wait here, will you?"
     bigwig went a little way down the run and stopped at the entrance to a large
burrow. after speaking a few words that hazel could not catch, he was evidently
called inside. the two rabbits waited in silence, broken only by the continual
nervous fidgeting of fiver.
     the chief rabbit's name and style was threarah, meaning "lord rowan tree."
for some reason he was always referred to as "the threarah" -- perhaps because
there happened to be only one threar, or rowan, near the warren, from which he
took his name. he had won his position not only by strength in his prime, but
also by level-headedness and a certain self-contained detachment, quite unlike
the impulsive behavior of most rabbits. it was well known that he never let
himself become excited by rumor or danger. he had coolly -- some even said
coldl

mass emigration and enforced complete isolation on the warren, thereby almost
certainly saving it from extinction. it was he, too, who had once dealt with a
particularly troublesome stoat by leading it down among the pheasant coops and
so (at the risk of his own life) onto a keeper's gun. he was now, as bigwig said,
getting old, but his wits were still clear enough. when hazel and fiver were
brought in, he greeted them politely. owsla like toadflax might threaten and
bully. the threarah had no need.
     "ah, walnut. it is walnut, isn't it?"
     "hazel," said hazel.
     "hazel, of course. how very nice of you to come and see me. i knew your
mother well. and your friend--"

can tell where a wire's been set. and now he says he can sense a bad danger
coming upon the warren."
     "a bad danger. yes, i see. how very upsetting," said the chief rabbit, looking
anything but upset. "now, what sort of danger, i wonder?" he looked at fiver.
     "i don't know," said fiver. "b-but it's bad. it's so b-bad that -- it's very bad," he
concluded miserably.
     the threarah waited politely for a few moments and then he said, "well, now,
and what ought we to do about it, i wonder?"
     "go away," said fiver instantly. "go away. all of us. now. threarah, sir, we
must all go away."
     the threarah waited again. then, in an extremely understanding voice, he
said, "well, i never did! that's rather a tall order, isn't it? what do you think
yourself?"
     "well, sir," said hazel, "my brother doesn't really think about these feelings he
gets. he just has the feelings,

you think they'll say? all delighted, eh?"
     "they'd take it from you," said fiver suddenly.
     "that's very nice of you," said the threarah again. "well, perhaps they would,
perhaps they would. but i should have to consider it very carefully indeed. a most
serious step, of course. and then--"
     "but there's no time, threarah, sir," blurted out fiver. "i can feel the danger
like a wire round my neck -- like a wire -- hazel, help!" he squealed and rolled
over in the sand, kicking frantically, as a rabbit does in a snare. hazel held him
down with both forepaws and he grew quieter.
     "i'm awfully sorry, chief rabbit," said hazel.

think over all you've said most carefully, you can be quite sure of that. bigwig,
just wait a moment, will you?"
     as hazel and fiver made their way dejectedly down the run outside the
threarah's burrow, they could just hear, from inside, the chief rabbit's voice
assuming a rather sharper note, interspersed with an occasional "yes, sir," "no,
sir."
     bigwig, as he had predicted, was getting his head bitten off.

  it was evening once more and hazel and fiver were feeding outside the wood
with two friends. blackberry, the rabbit with tipped ears who had been startled by
fiver the night before, had listened carefully to hazel's description of the notice
board, remarking that he had always felt sure that men left these things about to
act as signs or messages of some kind, in the same way that rabbits left marks on
runs and gaps. it was another neighbor, dandelion, who had now brought the
talk back to the threarah and his indifference to fiver's fear.
     "i don't know what i expected," said hazel. "i'd never been near the chief
rabbit before. but i thought, 'well, even if he won't listen, at least no one can say
afterward that we didn't do our best to warn him.'"
     "you're sure, then, that there's really something to be afraid of?"
     "i'm quite certain. i've always known fiver, you see."

his way up from the ditch. it was bigwig.
     "hello, bigwig," said hazel. "you're off duty?"
     "off duty" said bigwig, "and likely to remain off duty."
     "how do you mean?"
     "i've left the owsla, that's what i mean."
     "not on our account?"
     "you could say that. the threarah's rather good at making himself unpleasant
when he's been woken up at ni-frith for what he considers a piece of trivial
nonsense. he certainly knows how to get under your skin. i dare say a good many
rabbits would have kept quiet and thought about keeping on the right side of the
chief, but i'm afraid i'm not much good at that. i told him that the owsla's
privileges didn't mean all that much to me in any case and that a strong rabbit
could always do just as well by leaving the warren. he told m

     "i think there are one or two in the owsla who might be worth sounding," said
bigwig. "if i can talk them over, they'll be with me when i join you tonight. but
they won't come because of fiver. they'll be juniors, discontented fellows like me.
you need to have heard fiver yourself to be convinced by him. he's convinced
me. it's obvious that he's been sent some kind of message, and i believe in these
things. i can't think why he didn't convince the threarah."
     "because the threarah doesn't like anything he hasn't thought of for himself,"
answered hazel. "but we can't bother with him any more now. we've got to try to
collect some more rabbits and meet again here, fu inlé. and we'll start fu inlé,
too: we can't wait longer. the danger's coming closer all the time -- whatever it is

and left it at that."
     "i don't blame you," said hazel. "knowing toadflax, i'm surprised he didn't

grass. at last hazel heard what he was listening for; a rabbit -- or was it two? --
approaching from the wood.
     a few moments later bigwig was in the ditch. behind him came a hefty, brisk-
looking rabbit something over twelve months old. he was well known by sight to
all the warren, for his fur was entirely gray, with patches of near-white that now
caught the moonlight as he sat scratching himself without speaking. this was

silver, a nephew of the threarah, who was serving his first month in the owsla.
     hazel could not help feeling relieved that bigwig had brought only silver -- a
quiet, straightforward fellow who had not yet really found his feet among the
veterans. when bigwig had spoken earlier of sounding out the owsla, hazel had
been in two minds. it was only too likely that they would encounter dangers
beyond the warren and that they would stand in need of some good fighters.

e like toadflax.
     "wherever we settle down in the end," thought hazel, "i'm determined to see
that pipkin and fiver aren't sat on and cuffed around until they're ready to run
any risk just to get away. but is bigwig going to see it like that?"
     "you know silver, don't you?" asked bigwig, breaking in on his thoughts.
"apparently some of the younger fellows in the owsla have been giving him a thin
time -- teasing him about his fur, you know, and saying he only got his place
because of the threarah. i thought i was going to get some more, but i suppose
nearly all the owsla feel they're very well off as they are."
     he looked about him. "i say, there aren't many here, are there? do you think
it's really worth going on with this idea?"
     silver seemed about to speak when suddenly there was a pattering in the
undergrowth above and three more rabbits came over the bank from the wood.
their movement was direct and purposeful, quite unlike the earlier, haphazard
approach of those who were

s is a nice surprise, hazel," said bigwig at length. "or were you
expecting this when you took us into the wood?"
     hazel realized wearily that bigwig was probably going to be troublesome. he
was certainly no coward, but he was likely to remain steady only as long as he
could see his way clear and be sure of what to do. to him, perplexity was worse
than danger; and when he was perplexed he usually grew angry. the day before,
fiver's warning had troubled him, and he had spoken in anger to the threarah
and left the owsla. then, while he was in an uncertain mood about the idea of
leaving the warren, captain holly had appeared in capital time to be attacked and
to provide a perfect reason for their departure. now, at the sight of the river,
bigwig's assurance was leaking again and unless he, hazel, could restore it in
some way, they were likely to be in for trouble. he thought of the threarah and
his wily courtesy.
     "i don't know what we should have done without you just now, bigwig," he

like. always glad to

     without the slightest hesitation, he took two hops to the water, waded in and
swam across the deep, still pool. they watched him pull himself out beside a
flowering clump of figwort, gripping one of the tough stems in his teeth, shake a
shower of drops out of his fur and scutter into the alder bushes. a moment later,
between the nut trees, they saw him running off into the field.
     "i'm glad he's with us," said hazel to silver. again he thought wryly of the
threarah. "he's the fellow to find out all we need to know. oh, i say, look, he's
coming back already."
     bigwig was racing back across the field, looking more agitated than he had at
any time since the encounter with captain holly. he ran into the water almost
headlong and paddled over fast, leaving an arrowhead ripple on the calm brown
surface. he was speaking as he jerked himself out on the sandy foreshore.
     "well, hazel, if i were you i shouldn't wait until ni-frith. i should go now. in

     "there's a road there, then," he said. "that'll give some of them a surprise,
won't it?"
     "a road?" said hazel, thinking of the lane by the notice board. "how do you
know?"
     "well, how do you suppose a hrududu can go that fast? besides, can't you smell
it?"
     the smell of warm tar was now plain on the evening air.
     "i've never smelled that in my life," said hazel with a touch of irritation.
     "ah," said bigwig, "but then you were never sent out stealing lettuces for the
threarah, were you? if you had been, you'd have learned about roads. there's
nothing to them, really, as long as you let them alone by night. they're elil then,
all right."
     "you'd better teach me, i think," said hazel. "i'll go up with you and we'll let
the others follow."
     they ran on and crept through the hedge. hazel looked down at the road in
astonishment. for a moment he thought that he was looking at another river --
black, smooth and straight between its banks. then he saw the gravel emb

many more than he was bringing. all had the same rich, opulent smell as cowslip.
     cowslip himself was at the other end of the hall and hazel realized that he was
waiting for him to reply. his own companions were still coming out of the
entrance burrow one by one and there was a good deal of scrabbling and
shuffling. he wondered if he ought to be very formal. whether or not he could
call himself a chief rabbit, he had had no experience of this sort of thing. the
threarah would no doubt have risen to the occasion perfectly. he did not want to
appear at a loss or to let his followers down. he decided that it would be best to
be plain and friendly. after all, there would be plenty of time, as they settled
down in the warren, to show these strangers that they were as good as
themselves, without risking trouble by putting on airs at the start.
     "we're glad to be out of the bad weather," he said. "we're like all rabbits --

     the great burrow was less crowded than when they had left it. nildro-hain was
the first rabbit they met. she was among a group of three or four fine does who
were talking quietly together and seemed to be feeding as well. there was a smell
of greenstuff. evidently some kind of food was available underground, like the

threarah's lettuce. hazel stopped to speak to nildro-hain. she asked whether he
had gone as far as the well pit and the el-ahrairah of laburnum.
     "yes, we did," said hazel. "it's something quite strange to me, i'm afraid. but
i'd rather admire you and your friends than stones on a wall."
     as he said this, he noticed that cowslip had joined them and that strawberry
was talking to him quietly. he caught the words "never been near a shape" and a
moment later cowslip replied, "well, it makes no diff

     in the sandleford warren, holly had been a rabbit of consequence. he was
greatly relied upon by the threarah and had more than once carried out difficult
orders with a good deal of courage. during the early spring, when a fox had
moved into a neighboring copse, holly, with two or three volunteers, had kept it
steadily under observation for several days and reported all its movements, until
one evening it left as suddenly as it had come. although he had decided on his
own initiative to arrest bigwig, he had not the reputation of being vindictive. he

     but before he went, bigwig turned to hazel and said, "you got yourself out of
that ditch down there instead of me, didn't you, hazel? i shan't forget that."
     hazel remembered buckthorn's leg and took him down with him. speedwell

     "i say, what's happened, hazel?" asked silver. "it must be something very bad.
holly would never leave the threarah."
     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.
     the next day was as hot and cloudless as the last. neither pipkin nor
dandelion was at morning silflay; and hazel relentlessly took the others up to the

them holly went up to silver, who was feeding with fiver in a patch of yellow
trefoil.
     "i'm glad to see you here, silver," he said. "i hear you've had a rough time."
     "it hasn't been easy," answered silver. "hazel's done wonders and we owe a lot
to fiver here as well."
     "i've heard of you," said holly, turning to fiver. "you're the rabbit who saw it
all coming. you talked to the threarah, didn't you?"
     "he talked to me," said fiver.
     "if only he'd listened to you! well, it can't be changed now, till acorns grow on

not usually advisable to take much notice of them. for one thing, many are just
plain mischievous. a weak rabbit who can't hope to get far by fighting sometimes

curious thing is that when he turns out to be wrong, his friends seldom seem to

rabbit hole, one of them would prod at it; and they kept talking all the time. i

     "what did the threarah say?" asked silver.
     "i've no idea. i didn't ask him and neither did anyone else, as far as i know. i
went to sleep and when i woke there was no sound up above. it was evening and i

know how to describe them to you -- they were made of the same sort of stuff as a
hrududu and they must have been heavy, because it took two men to carry one of
them. the men carried these things into the field and the few rabbits who were
above ground went down. i didn't. i'd seen the gun and i thought they were
probably going to use ferrets and perhaps nets. so i stayed where i was and
watched. i thought, 'as soon as i'm sure what they're up to, i'll go and warn the

could find. every hole he came to, he cut out the turf above and pushed it into the
hole. that puzzled me, because with ferrets they want to drive the rabbits out. but
i was expecting that they'd leave a few holes open and net them: although that
would have been a foolish way to ferret, because a rabbit that went up a blocked

up and run, but i didn't know where i was and i found i'd run down to the edge of
the wood, toward the men. i stopped just in time. i was bewildered and i'd lost all
idea of warning the threarah. after that i just sat where i was.

happened for a little while. and then i saw scabious -- you remember scabious?

where he was and the boy shot him. he didn't kill him -- scabio

     "the men had done their work badly," resumed holly. "either they didn't know
about the wood holes or they couldn't be bothered to come and block them.
almost every rabbit that came up in the field was shot, but i saw two get away.
one was nose-in-the-air, but i don't remember who the other was. the noise was
very frightening and i would have run myself, but i kept waiting to see whether
the threarah would come. after a while i began to realize that there were a few
other rabbits in the wood. pine needles was there, i remember, and butterbur

     "after a long time i went back through the wood. i'd forgotten any idea of
collecting other rabbits, but there were three who joined me all the same --
bluebell here and pimpernel and young toadflax. toadflax was the only member
of the owsla i'd seen and i asked him about the threarah, but he couldn't talk any

kind of sense. i never found out what happened to the threarah. i hope he died
quickly.
     "pimpernel was light-headed -- chattering nonsense -- and bluebell and i
weren't much better. for some reason all i could think of was bigwig. i
remembed how i'd gone to arrest him -- to kill him, really -- and i felt i had to
find him and tell him i'd been wrong: and this idea was all the sense i had left.
the four of us went wandering away and we must have gone almost in a

you can only get to a certain place or do a certain thing. but when you get there
you find it's not that simple. i suppose i'd had some sort of foolish notion that
bigwig would be waiting to meet us. we found the hills were enormous -- bigger
than anything we'd ever seen. no woods, no cover, no rabbits: and night setting
in. and then everything seemed to go to pieces. i saw scabious, as plain as grass --

and heard him crying, too: and i saw the threarah and toadflax and pimpernel. i
tried to talk to them. i was calling bigwig, but i didn't really expect him to hear
because i was sure he wasn't there. i can remember coming out from a hedge into
the open and i know i was really hoping that the elil would come and make an
end of me. but when i came to my senses, there was bigwig. my first thought was
that i must be dead, but then i began to wonder whether he was real or not. well,
you know the rest. it's a pity i frightened you so much. but if i

"will that be difficult, do you think?"
     "i should have thought not," said holly. "big warrens are often overcrowded
and some of the rabbits can't get enough to eat. the young does get edgy and
nervous and some of them don't have any kittens on that account. at least, the
kittens begin to grow inside them and then they melt away again into their
bodies. you know this?"
     "i didn't know," said strawberry.
     "that's because you've never been overcrowded. but our warren -- the
threarah's warren -- was overcrowded a year or two back and a lot of the younger
does were re-absorbing their litters before they were born. the threarah told me
that long ago el-ahrairah made a bargain with frith. frith promised him that
rabbits were not to be born dead or unwanted. if there's little chance of a decent
life for them, it's a doe's privilege to take them back into her body unborn."
     "yes, i remember the bargain story," said hazel. "so you think there may be
discontented does? that's

or anything like that.
     "so then these three rabbits took us off down the bank and that was how we
came to efrafa, as they call it. and i'd better try and tell you something about it,
so that you'll know what a dirty little bunch of sniveling hedge-scrapers we are
here.
     "efrafa is a big warren -- a good deal bigger than the one we came from -- the
threarah's, i mean. and the one fear of every rabbit in it is that men are going to
find them and infect them with the white blindness. the whole warren is
organized to conceal its existence. the holes are all hidden and the owsla have
every rabbit in the place under orders. you can't call your life your own: and in
return you have safety -- if it's worth having at the price you pay.
     "as well as the owsla, they have what they call a council, and each of the
council rabbits has some special thing he

long. then he would have to fight -- probably with woundwort himself; and if
woundwort closed with him and used his weight, he would have little chance.
somehow he must manage to hurt him at the outset, before he expected it. but
how?
     he put the problem to holly.
     "the trouble is this warren wasn't dug to be defended," said holly. "that was
what the slack run was for, back at home, so the threarah once told me. it was
made so that if we ever had to, we could get down beneath an enemy and come up
where he wasn't expecting us."
     "that's it!" cried bigwig. "that's the idea! look, i'm going to dig myself into the
floor of the run just behind this blocked opening. then you cover me with earth.
it won't be noticed -- there's so much digging and mess in the place already. i
know it's a risk, but it'll be better than just trying to stand up in front of a rabbit
like woundwort."
