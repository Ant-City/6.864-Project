with this whip there was like a very loud electric bell ringringring, and this bell was like a sort of a pain too.

then i woke up real skorry, my heart going bap bap bap, and of course there was really a bell going brrrrr, and it was our front-door bell. i let on that nobody was at home, but this brrrrr still ittied on, and then i heard a goloss shouting through the door: “come on then, get out of it, i know you’re in bed.” i recognized the goloss right away. it was the goloss of p. r. deltoid (a real gloopy nazz, that one) what they called my post-corrective adviser, an overworked veck with hundreds on his books. i shouted right right right, in a goloss of like pain, and i got out of bed and attired myself, o my brothers, in a very lovely over-gown of like silk, with designs of like great cities all over this over-gown. then i put my nogas into very comfy wooly toofles, combed my luscious glory, and was ready for p. r. deltoid. when i opened up he came shambling in looking shagged,

a battered old shlapa on his gulliver, his raincoat filthy. “ah, alex boy,” he said to me. “i met your mother, yes. she said something about a pain somewhere. hence not at schol, yes.”

“a rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir,” i said in my gentleman’s goloss. “i think it should clear by this afternoon.”

“or certainly by this evening, yes,” said p. r. deltoid. “the evening is the great time, isn’t it, alex boy? sit,” he said, “sit, sit,” as though this was his domy and me his guest. and he sat in this starry rocking-chair of my dad’s and began rocking, as if that was all he had come for. i said:

“a cup of the old chai, sir? tea, i mean.”

“no time,” he said. and he rocked, giving me the old glint under frowning brows, as if with all the time in the world. “no time, yes,” he said, gloopy. so i put the kettle on. then i sa

oking at me but still rocking away. then he caught sight of an advert in the gazetta, which was on the table—a lovely smecking young ptitsa with her groodies hanging out to advertise, my brothers, the glories of the jugoslav beaches.

then, after sort of eating her up in two swallows, he said:

“why should you think in terms of there being anything wrong? have you been doing something you shouldn’t, yes?”

“just a manner of speech,” i said, “sir.”

“well,” said p. r. deltoid, “it’s just a manner of speech from me to you that you watch out, little alex, because next time, as you very well know, it’s not going to be the corrective school any more. next time it’s going to be the barry place and all my work ruined. if you have no consideration for your horrible self you at least might have some for me, who have sweated over you. a big black mark, i tell you in confidence, for every one we don’t reclaim, a confession of failure for every one of you that ends u

p in the stripy hole.”

“i’ve been doing nothing i shouldn’t, sir,” i said. “the millicents have nothing on me, brother, sir i mean.”

“cut out this clever talk about millicents,” said p. r. deltoid very weary, but still rocking. “just because the police have not picked you up lately doesn’t, as you very well know, mean you’ve not been up to some nastiness. there was a bit of a fight last night, wasn’t there? there was a bit of shuffling with nozhes and bike-chains and the like. one of a certain fat boy’s friends was ambulanced off late from near the power plant and hospitalized, cut about very unpleasantly, yes. your name was mentioned. the word has got through to me by the usua

ffering, but still rocking away: “what gets into you all? we study the problem and we’ve been studying it for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our studies. you’ve got a good home here, good loving parents, you’ve got not too bad of a brain. is it some devil that crawls inside you?”

“nobody’s got anything on me, sir,” i said. “i’ve been out of the rookers of the millicents for a long time now.”

“that’s just what worries me,” sighed p. r. deltoid. “a bit too long of a time to be healthy. you’re about due now by my reckoning. that’s why i’m warning you, little alex, to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt, yes. do i make myself clear?”

“as an unmuddied lake, sir,” i said. “clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. you can rely on me, sir.” and i gave him a nice zooby smile.

but when he’d ookadeeted and i was making this very strong pot of chai, i grinned to myself over this veshch that p. r. deltoid

 and his droogs worried about. all right, i do bad, what with crasting and tolchocks and carves with the britva and the old in-out-in-out, and if i get loveted, well, too bad for me, o my little brothers, and you can’t run a country with every chelloveck comporting himself in my manner of the night. so if i get loveted and it’s three months in this mesto and another six in that, and the, as p. r. deltoid so kindly warns, next time, in spite of the great tenderness of my summers, brothers, it’s the great unearthly zoo itself, well, i say: “fair, but a pity, my lords, because i just cannot bear to be shut in. my endeavour shall be, in such future as stretches out its snowy and lilywhite arms to me before the nozh overtakes or the blood spatters its final chorus in twisted metal and smashed glass on the highroad, to not get loveted again.” which is fair speeching. but, brothers, this biting

re we were awaiting and peeting away at the old knify moloko, and you might have been like offended by some veshch or other, so round we come to your abode. that’s right, pete, right?”

“oh, yes, right,” said pete.

“appy polly loggies,” i said careful. “i had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to sleep. i was not wakened when i gave orders for wakening. still, here we all are, ready for what the old nochy offers, yes?” i seemed to have picked up that yes? from p. r. deltoid, my post-corrective adviser. very strange.

“sorry about the pain,” said georgie, like very concerned.

“using the gulliver too much like, maybe. giving orders and discipline and such, perhaps. sure the pain is gone? sure you’ll not be happier going back to the bed?” and they all had a bit of a malenky grin.

“wait,” i said. “let’s get things nice and sparkling clear. this sarcasm, if i may call it such, does not become you, o my little friends. perhaps you have been hav

then he turned to the millicents to say: “evening, inspector. evening, sergeant. evening, evening, all. well, this is the end of the line for me, yes. dear dear, this boy does look messy, doesn’t he? just look at the state of him.”

“end of the line, yes,” said p. r. deltoid again. he looked at me with very cold glazzies like i had become a thing and was no more a bleeding very tired battered chelloveck. “i suppose i’ll have to be in court tomorrow.”

“it wasn’t me, brother, sir,” i said, a malenky bit weepy. “speak up for me, sir, for i’m not so bad. i was led on by the treachery of the others, sir.”

“sings like a linnet,” said the top rozz, sneery. “sings the roof off lovely, he does that.”

“if you’d like to give him a bash in the chops, sir,” said the top millicent, “don’t mind us. we’ll hold him down. he must be another great disappointment to you.”

p. r. deltoid then did something i never thought any man like him who was supposed to turn us baddiwads into real horrorshow malchicks would do, especially with all those rozzes around. he came a bit nearer and he spat. he spat. he spat full in my litso and then wiped his wet spitty rot with the back of his rooker. and i wiped and wiped and wiped my spat-on litso with my bloody tashtook, saying “thank you, sir, thank you very much, sir, that was very kind of you, sir, thank you.” and then p. r. deltoid w
