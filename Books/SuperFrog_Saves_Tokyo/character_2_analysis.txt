Worm
Worm is the enemy in "Super-Frog Saves Tokyo," but he's not a true villain. Frog knows that Worm must be stopped to save the citizens of Tokyo, but he doesn't necessarily believe that Worm is evil or that Worm doesn't have a right to exist. Even though he has a frightful appearance and is prone to violence, Worm is as morally neutral as an actual earthquake. In fact, Frog's description of Worm's awakening seems to place some of the blame on human beings, because it is the clamor and tumult of the city itself that produces Worm's rage. The figure of Worm evokes the two tragedies Japan suffered in 1995, both of which took place deep underground. Frog claims that the Kobe earthquake in January 1995 pushed Worm's patience over the limit, while the pointed comparison of Worm and a commuter train evokes the Aum Shirinkyo subway tragedy of March 1995.
