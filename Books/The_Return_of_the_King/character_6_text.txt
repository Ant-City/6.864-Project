minas tirith

pippin looked out from the shelter of gandalf’s cloak. he wondered if he was awake or still sleeping, still in the swift-moving dream in which he had been wrapped so long since the great ride began. the dark world was rushing by and the wind sang loudly in his ears. he could see nothing but the wheeling stars, and away to his right vast shadows against the sky where the mountains of the south marched past. sleepily he tried to reckon the times and stages of their journey, but his memory was drowsy a

 wilted with fear. but gandalf had spoken soft words to him, and he had slept in a corner, tired but uneasy, dimly aware of comings and goings and of men talking and gandalf giving orders. and then again riding, riding in the night. this was the second, no, the third night since he had looked in the stone. and with that hideous memory he woke fully, and shivered, and the noise of the wind became filled with menacing voices.
a light kindled in the sky, a blaze of yellow fire behind dark barriers pippin cowered back, afraid for a moment, wondering into what dreadful country gandalf was bearing him. he rubbed his eyes, and then he saw that it was the moon rising above the eastern shadows, now almost at the full. so the night was not yet old and for hours the dark journey would go on. he stirred and spoke.
‘where are we, gandalf?’ he asked.
‘in the realm of gondor,’ the wizard answered. ‘the land of anórien is still passing by.’
there was a silence again for a while. then, ‘what i

s that?’ cried pippin suddenly, clutching at gandalf’s cloak. ‘look! fire, red fire! are there dragons in this land? look, there is another!’
for answer gandalf cried aloud to his horse. ‘on, shadowfax! we must hasten. time is short. see! the beacons of gondor are alight, calling for aid. war is kindled. see, there is the fire on amon dîn, and flame on eilenach; and there they go speeding west: nardol, erelas, min-rimmon, calenhad, and the halifirien on the borders of rohan.’
but shadowfax paused in his s

tride, slowing to a walk, and then he lifted up his head and neighed. and out of the darkness the answering neigh of other horses came; and presently the thudding of hoofs was heard, and three riders swept up and passed like flying ghosts in the moon and vanished into the west. then shadowfax gathered himself together and sprang away, and the night flowed over him like a roaring wind.
pippin became drowsy again and paid little attention to gandalf telling him of the customs of gondor, and how the lord of the city had beacons built on the tops of outlying hills along both borders of the great range, and maintained posts at these points where fresh horses were always in readiness to bear his errand-riders to rohan in the north, or to belfalas in the south. ‘it is long since the beacons of the north were lit,’ he said; ‘and in the ancient days of gondor they were not needed, for

 they had the seven stones.’ pippin stirred uneasily.
‘sleep again, and do not be afraid!’ said gandalf. ‘for you are not going like frodo to mordor, but to minas tirith, and there you will be as safe as you can be anywhere in these days. if gondor falls, or the ring is taken, then the shire will be no refuge.’
‘you do not comfort me,’ said pippin, but nonetheless sleep crept over him. the last thing that he remembered before he fell into deep dream was a glimpse of high white peaks, glimmering like floating isles above the clouds as they caught the light of the westering moon. he wondered where frodo was, and if he was already in mordor, or if he was dead; and he did not know that frodo from far away looked on that same moon as it set beyond gondor ere the coming of the day.
pippin woke to the sound of voices. another day of hiding and

shadowfax stood steaming with sweat, but he held his neck proudly and showed no sign of weariness. many tall men heavily cloaked stood beside him, and behind them in the mist loomed a wall of stone. partly ruinous it seemed, but already before the night was passed the sound of hurried labour could be heard: beat of hammers, clink of trowels, and the creak of wheels. torches and flares glowed dully here and there in the fog. gandalf was speaking to the men that barred his way, and as he listened pippin became aware that he himself was being discussed.
‘yea truly, we know you, mithrandir,’ said the leader of the men, ‘and you know the pass-words of the seven gates and are free to go forward. but we do not know your companion. what is he? a dwarf out of the mountains in the north? we wish for no strangers in the land at this time, unless they be mighty men of arms in whose faith and help we can trust.’
‘i will vouch for him before the seat of denethor,’ said gandalf. ‘and as for v

alour, that cannot be computed by stature. he has passed through more battles and perils than you have, ingold, though you be twice his height; and he comes now from the storming of isengard, of which we bear tidings, and great weariness is on him, or i would wake him. his name is peregrin, a very valiant man.’
‘man?’ said ingold dubiously; and the others laughed.
‘man!’ cried pippin, now thoroughly roused. ‘man! indeed not! i am a hobbit and no more valiant than i am a man, save perhaps now and again by necessity. do not let gandalf deceive you!’
‘many a doer of great deeds might say no more,’ said ingold. ‘but what is a hobbit?’
‘a halfling,’ answered gandalf. ‘nay, not the one that was spoken of,’ he added seeing the wonder in the men’s faces. ‘not he, yet one of his kindred.’
‘yes, and one who journeyed with him,’ said pippin. ‘and boromi

r of your city was with us, and he saved me in the snows of the north, and at the last he was slain defending me from many foes.’
‘peace!’ said gandalf. ‘the news of that grief should have been told first to the father.’
‘it has been guessed already,’ said ingold; ‘for there have been strange portents here of late. but pass on now quickly! for the lord of minas tirith will be eager to see any that bear the latest tidings of his son, be he man or-‘
‘hobbit,’ said pippin. ‘little service can i offer to your lord, but what i can do, i would do, remembering boromir the brave.’
‘fare you well!’ said ingold; and the men made way for shadow fax, and he passed through a narrow gate in the wall. ‘may you bring good counsel to denethor in his need, and to us all, mithrandir!’ ingold cried. ‘but you come with tidings of grief and danger, as is your wont, they say.’
‘because i come seldom but when my help is needed,’ answered gandalf. ‘and as for co

eckoned men of gondor, yet their blood was mingled, and there were short and swarthy folk among them whose sires came more from the forgotten men who housed in the shadow of the hills in the dark years ere the coming of the kings. but beyond, in the great fief of belfalas, dwelt prince imrahil in his castle of dol amroth by the sea, and he was of high blood, and his folk also, tall men and proud with sea-grey eyes.
now after gandalf had ridden for some time the light of day grew in the sky, and pippin roused himself and looked up. to his left lay a sea of mist, rising to a bleak shadow in the east; but to his right great mountains reared their heads, ranging from the west to a steep and sudden end, as if in the making of the land the river had burst through a great barrier, carving out a mighty valley to be a land of battle and debate in times to come. and there where the white mountains of ered nimrais came to their end he saw, as gandalf had promised, the dark mass of mount mindolluin, the

 deep purple shadows of its high glens, and its tall face whitening in the rising day. and upon its out-thrust knee was the guarded city, with its seven walls of stone so strong and old that it seemed to have been not builded but carven by giants out of the bones of the earth.
even as pippin gazed in wonder the walls passed from looming grey to white, blushing faintly in the dawn; and suddenly the sun climbed over the eastern shadow and sent forth a shaft that smote the face of the city. then pippin cried aloud, for the tower of ecthelion, standing high within the topmost walls’ shone out against the sky, glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver, tall and fair and shapely, and its pinnacle glittered as if it were wrought of crystals; and white banners broke and fluttered from the battlements in the morning breeze’ and high and far he heard a clear ringing as of silver trumpets.
so gandalf and peregrin rode to the great gate of the men of gondor at the rising of the sun, and its iron

es, if there were any within that could hold weapons; unless some foe could come behind and scale the lower skirts of mindolluin, and so come upon the narrow shoulder that joined the hill of guard to the mountain mass. but that shoulder, which rose to the height of the fifth wall, was hedged with great ramparts right up to the precipice that overhung its western end; and in that space stood the houses and domed tombs of bygone kings and lords, for ever silent between the mountain and the tower.
pippin gazed in growing wonder at the great stone city, vaster and more splendid than anything that he had dreamed of; greater and stronger than isengard, and far more beautiful. yet it was in truth falling year by year into decay; and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there. in every street they passed some great house or court over whose doors and arched gates were carved many fair letters of strange and ancient shapes: names pippin guessed of great men and kindreds that h

e the court of the fountain where the white tree once had grown.
already it seemed that word of their coming had gone before them: and at once they were admitted, silently, and without question. quickly gandalf strode across the white-paved court. a sweet fountain played there in the morning sun, and a sward of bright green lay about it; but in the midst. drooping over the pool, stood a dead tree, and the falling drops dripped sadly from its barren and broken branches back into the clear water.
pippin glanced at it as he hurried after gandalf. it looked mournful, he thought, and he wondered why the dead tree was left in this place where everything else was well tended.
seven stars and seven stones and one white tree.
the words that gandalf had murmured came back into his mind. and then he found himself at the doors of the great hall beneath the gleaming tower; and behind the wizard he passed the tall silent door-wardens and entered the cool echoing shadows of the house of stone.
they walked

down a paved passage, long and empty, and as they went gandalf spoke softly to pippin. ‘be careful of your words, master peregrin! this is no time for hobbit pertness. théoden is a kindly old man. denethor is of another sort, proud and subtle, a man of far greater lineage and power, though he is not called a king. but he will speak most to you, and question you much, since you can tell him of his son boromir. he loved him greatly: too much perhaps; and the more so because they were unlike. but under cover of this love he will think it easier to learn what he witches from you

rather than from me. do not tell him more than you need, and leave quiet the matter of frodo’s errand. i will deal with that in due time. and say nothing about aragorn either, unless you must.’
‘why not? what is wrong with strider?’ pippin whispered. ‘he meant to come here, didn’t he? and he’ll be arriving soon himself anyway.’
‘maybe, maybe,’ said gandalf. ‘though if he comes, it is likely to be in some way that no one expects, not even denethor. it will be better so. at least he should come unheralded by us.’
gandalf halted before a tall door of polished metal. ‘see, master pippin, there is no time to instruct you now in the history of gondor; though it might have been better, if you had learned something of i

t, when you were still birds-nesting and playing truant in the woods of the shire. do as i bid! it is scarcely wise when bringing the news of the death of his heir to a mighty lord to speak over much of the coming of one who will, if he comes, claim the kingship. is that enough?’
‘kingship?’ said pippin amazed.
‘yes,’ said gandalf. ‘if you have walked all these days with closed ears and mind asleep, wake up now!’ he knocked on the door.
the door opened, but no one could be seen to open it. pippin looked into a great hall. it was lit by deep windows in the wide aisles at either side, beyond the rows of tall pillars that upheld the roof. monoliths of black marble, they rose to great capitals carved in many strange figures of beasts and leaves; and far above in shadow the wide vaulting gl

eamed with dull gold, inset with flowing traceries of many colours. no hangings nor storied webs, nor any things of woven stuff or of wood, were to be seen in that long solemn hall; but between the pillars there stood a silent company of tall images graven in cold stone.
suddenly pippin was reminded of the hewn rocks of argonath, and awe fell on him, as he looked down that avenue of kings long dead. at the far end upon a dais of many steps was set a high throne under a canopy of marble shaped like a crowned helm; behind it was carved upon the wall and set with gems an image of a tree in flower. but the throne was empty. at the foot of the dais, upon the lowest step which was broad and deep, there was a stone chair, black and unadorned, and on it sat an old man gazing at his la

p. in his hand was a white rod with a golden knob. he did not look up. solemnly they paced the long floor towards him, until they stood three paces from his footstool. then gandalf spoke.
‘hail, lord and steward of minas tirith, denethor son of ecthelion! i am come with counsel and tidings in this dark hour.’
then the old man looked up. pippin saw his carven face with its proud bones and skin like ivory, and the long curved nose between the dark deep eyes; and he was reminded not so much of boromir as of aragorn. ‘dark indeed is the hour,’ said the old man, ‘and at such times you are wont to come, mithrandir. but though all the signs forebode that the doom of gondor is drawing nigh, less now to me is that darkness than my own darkness. it has been told to me that you bring with you one who saw my son die. is this he?’
‘it i

er any other to have it. he was a masterful man, and one to take what he desired. i journeyed far with him and learned much of his mood. but you speak of his death. you have had news of that ere we came?’
‘i have received this,’ said denethor, and laying down his rod he lifted from his lap the thing that he had been gazing at. in each hand he held up one half of a great horn cloven through the middle: a wild-ox horn bound with silver.
‘that is the horn that boromir always wore!’ cried pippin.
‘verily,’ said denethor. ‘and in my turn i bore it, and so did each eldest son of our house, far back into the vanished years before the failing of the kings, since vorondil father of mardil hunted the wild kine of araw in the far fields of rhûn. i heard it blowing dim upon the northern marches thirteen days ago, and the river brought it to me, broken: it will wind no more.’ he paused and there was a heavy silence. suddenly he turned his black glance upon pippin. ‘what say you to th

at, halfling?’
‘thirteen, thirteen days,’ faltered pippin. ‘yes, i think that would be so. yes, i stood beside him, as he blew the horn. but no help came. only more orcs.’
‘so,’ said denethor, looking keenly at pippin’s face. ‘you were there? tell me more! why did no help come? and how did you escape, and yet he did not, so mighty a man as he was, and only orcs to withstand him?’
pippin flushed and forgot his fear. ‘the mightiest man may be slain by one arrow,’ he said; ‘and boromir was pierced by many. when last i saw him he sank beside a tree and plucked a black-feathered shaft from his side. then i swooned and was made captive. i saw him no more, and know no more. but i honour his memory, for he was very valiant. he died to save us, my kinsman meriadoc and myself, waylaid in the woods by the soldiery of the dark lord; and though he fell and failed, my gratitude is non

e the less.’
then pippin looked the old man in the eye, for pride stirred strangely within him, still stung by the scorn and suspicion in that cold voice. ‘little service, no doubt, will so great a lord of men think to find in a hobbit, a halfling from the northern shire; yet such as it is, i will offer it, in payment of my debt.’ twitching aside his grey cloak, pippin drew forth his small sword and laid it at denethor’s feet.
a pale smile, like a gleam of cold sun on a winter’s evening, passed over the old man’s face; but he bent his head and held out his hand, laying the shards of the horn aside. ‘give me the weapon!’ he said.
pippin lifted it and presented the hilt to him. ‘whence came this?’ said denethor. ‘many, many years lie on it. surely this is a blade wrought by our own kindred in the north in the deep past?’
‘it came out of the

mounds that lie on the borders of my country ‘ said pippin. ‘but only evil wights dwell there now, and i will not willingly tell more of them.’
‘i see that strange tales are woven about you,’ said denethor, ‘and once again it is shown that looks may belie the man - or the halfling. i accept your service. for you are not daunted by words; and you have courteous speech, strange though the sound of it may be to us in the south. and we shall have need of all folk of courtesy, be they great or small, in the days to come. swear to me now!’
‘tak

e the hilt,’ said gandalf, ‘and speak after the lord, if you are resolved on this.’
‘i am,’ said pippin.
the old man laid the sword along his lap, and pippin put his hand to the hilt, and said slowly after denethor:
‘here do i swear fealty and service to gondor, and to the lord and steward of the realm, to speak and to be silent, to do and to let be, to come and to go, in need or plenty, in peace or war, in living or dying, from this hour henceforth, until my lord release me, or death take me, or the world end. so say i, peregrin son of paladin of the shire of the halflings.’
and this do i hear, denethor son of ecthelion, lord of gondor, steward

 of the high king, and i will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath-breaking with vengeance.’ then pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath.
‘and now,’ said denethor, ‘my first command to you: speak and be not silent! tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that you can of boromir, my son. sit now and begin!’ as he spoke he struck a small silver gong that stood near his footstool, and at once servants came forward. pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the door, unseen as he and gandalf entered.
‘bring wine and food and seats f

 it is to be hoped,’ said gandalf. ‘for i have not ridden hither from isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind, only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous. is it naught to you that théoden has fought a great battle and that isengard is overthrown, and that i have broken the staff of saruman?’
‘it is much to me. but i know already sufficient of these deeds for my own counsel against the menace of the east.’ he turned his dark eyes on gandalf, and now pippin saw a likeness between the two, and he felt the strain between them, almost as if he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame.
denethor looked indeed much more like a great wizard than gandalf did, more kingly, beautiful, and powerful; and older. yet by a sense other than sight pippin perceived that gandalf had the greater power and the deeper wisdom, and a majesty that was veiled. and he was older, far older. ‘how much older?’ he wondered,

would he leave it? and then his musings broke off, and he saw that denethor and gandalf still looked each other in the eye, as if reading the other’s mind. but it was denethor who first withdrew his gaze.
‘yea,’ he said; ‘for though the stones be lost, they say, still the lords of gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come to them. but sit now!’
then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver with a silver flagon and cups, and white cakes. pippin sat down, but he could not take his eyes from the old lord. was it so, or had he only imagined it, that as he spoke of the stones a sudden gleam of his eye had glanced upon pippin’s face?
‘now tell me your tale, my liege,’ said denethor, half kindly; half mockingly. ‘for the words of one whom my son so befriended will be welcome indeed.’
pippin never forgot that hour in the great hall under the piercing eye of the lord of gondor, stabbed ever and anon by his shrewd questions, and all

the while conscious of gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and (so pippin felt) holding in check a rising wrath and impatience. when the hour was over and denethor again rang the gong, pippin felt worn out. ‘it cannot be more than nine o’clock,’ he thought. ‘i could now eat three breakfasts on end.’
‘lead the lord mithrandir to the housing prepared for him,’ said denethor, ‘and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will. but be it known that i have now sworn him to my service, and he shall be known as peregrin son of paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. send word to the captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the third

re pleased to ask for. but i will say this: the rule of no realm is mine, neither of gondor nor any other, great or small. but all worthy things that are in peril as the world now stands, those are my care. and for my part, i shall not wholly fail of my task, though gondor should perish, if anything passes through this night that can still grow fair or bear fruit and flower again in days to come. for i also am a steward. did you not know?’ and with that he turned and strode from the hall with pippin running at his side.
gandalf did not look at pippin or speak a word to him as they went. their guide brought them from the doors of the hall, and then led them across the court of the fountain into a lane between tall buildings of stone. after several turns they came to a house close to the wall of the citadel upon the north side, not far from the shoulder that linked the hill with the mountain. within, upon the first floor above the street, up a wide carven stair, he showed them to a fair room

, light and airy, with goodly hangings of dull gold sheen unfigured. it was sparely furnished, having but a small table, two chairs and a bench; but at either side there were curtained alcoves and well-clad beds within with vessels and basins for washing. there were three high narrow windows that looked northward over the great curve of anduin, still shrouded in mists, towards the emyn muil and rauros far away. pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep stone sill.
‘are you angry with me, gandalf?’ he said, as their guide went out and closed the door. ‘i did the best i could.’
‘you did indeed!’ said gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and stood beside pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit’s shoulders and gazing out of the window. pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own, for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. yet in the wizard’s fa

ce he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth.
‘indeed you did your best,’ said the wizard; ‘and i hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men. still the lord of gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed, pippin. you could not hide the fact that boromir did not lead the company from moria, and that there was one among you of high honour who was coming to minas tirith; and that he had a famous sword. men think much about the stories of old days in gondor; and denethor has given long thought to the rhyme and to the words isildur’s bane, since boromir went away.
‘he is not as other men of this time, pippin, and whatever be his descent from father to son, by some chance the blood of westernesse runs ne

ou are at his command; and he will not forget. be wary still!’
he fell silent and sighed. ‘well, no need to brood on what tomorrow may bring. for one thing, tomorrow will be certain to bring worse than today, for many days to come. and there is nothing more that i can do to help it. the board is set, and the pieces are moving. one piece that i greatly desire to find is faramir, now the heir of denethor. i do not think that he is in the city; but i have had no time to gather news. i must go. pippin. i must go to this lords’ council and learn what i can. but the enemy has the move, and he is about to open his full game. and pawns are likely to see as much of it as any, peregrin son of paladin, soldier of gondor. sharpen your blade!’
gandalf went to the door, and there he turned. ‘i am in haste pippin,’ he said. ‘do me a favour when you go out. even before you rest, if you are not too weary. go and find shadowfax and see how he is housed. these people are kindly to beasts, for the

y are a good and wise folk, but they have less skill with horses than some.’
with that gandalf went out; and as he did so, there came the note of a clear sweet bell ringing in a tower of the citadel. three strokes it rang, like silver in the air, and ceased: the third hour from the rising of the sun.
after a minute pippin went to the door and down the stair and looked about the street. the sun was now shining warm and bright, and the towers and tall houses cast long clear-cut shadows westward. high in the blue air mount mindolluin lifted its white helm and snowy cloak. armed men went to and fro in the ways of the city, as if going at the striking of the hour to changes of post and duty.
‘nine o’clock we’d call it in the shire,’ said pippin aloud to himself. ‘just the time for a nice breakfast by the op

en window in spring sunshine. and how i should like breakfast! do these people ever have it, or is it over? and when do they have dinner, and where?’
presently he noticed a man, clad in black and white, coming along the narrow street from the centre of the citadel towards him. pippin felt lonely and made up his mind to speak as the man passed; but he had no need. the man came straight up to him.
‘you are peregrin the halfling?’ he said. ‘i am told that you have been sworn to the service of the lord and of the city. welcome! he held out his hand and pippin took it.
‘i am named beregond son of baranor. i have no duty this morning, and i have been sent to you to teach you the pass-words, and to tell you some of the many things that no doubt you will wish to know. and f

or my part, i would learn of you also. for never before have we seen a halfling in this land and though we have heard rumour of them, little is said of them in any tale that we know. moreover you are a friend of mithrandir. do you know him well?’
‘well,’ said pippin. ‘i have known of him all my short life, as you might say; and lately i have travelled far with him. but there is much to read in that book, and i cannot claim to have seen more than a page or two. yet perhaps i know him as well as any but a few. aragorn was the only one of our company, i think, who really knew him.’
‘aragorn?’ said beregond. ‘who is he?’
‘oh,’ stammered pippin, ‘he was a man who went about with us. i think he is in rohan now.’
‘you have been in rohan, i h

ear. there is much that i would ask you of that land also; for we put much of what little hope we have in its people. but i am forgetting my errand, which was first to answer what you would ask. what would you know, master peregrin?’
‘er well,’ said pippin, ‘if i may venture to say so, rather a burning question in my mind at present is, well, what about breakfast and all that? i mean, what are the meal-times, if you understand me, and where is the dining-room, if there is one? and the inns? i looked, but never a one could i see as we rode up, though i had been borne up by the hope of a draught of ale as soon as we came to the homes of wise and courtly men.’
beregond looked at him gravely. ‘an old campaigner, i see,’ he said. ‘they say t

hat men who go warring afield look ever to the next hope of food and of drink; though i am not a travelled man myself. then you have not yet eaten today?’
‘well, yes, to speak in courtesy, yes,’ said pippin. ‘but no more than a cup of wine and a white cake or two by the kindness of your lord; but he racked me for it with an hour of questions, and that is hungry work.’
beregond laughed. ‘at the table small men may do the greater deeds, we say. but you have broken your fast as well as any man in the citadel, and with greater honour. this is a fortress and a tower of guard and is now in posture of war. we rise ere the sun, and take a morsel in the grey light, and go to our duties at the opening

 hour. but do not despair!’ he laughed again, seeing the dismay in pippin’s face. ‘those who have had heavy duty take somewhat to refresh their strength in the mid-morning. then there is the nuncheon, at noon or after as duties allow; and men gather for the daymeal, and such mirth as there still may be, about the hour of sunset.
‘come! we will walk a little and then go find us some refreshment, and eat and drink on the battlement, and survey the fair morning.’
‘one moment!’ said pippin blushing. ‘greed, or hunger by your courtesy, put it out of my mind. but gandalf, mithrandir as you call him, asked me to see to his horse - shadowfax, a great steed of rohan, and the apple of the king’s eye, i am told, though he has given him to mithrandir for his services. i think his new master loves the beast better than he loves many men, and if his good will is of any value to this city, you will treat shadowfax with all honour: with greater kindness than you have treated this hobbit,

 if it is possible.’
‘hobbit?’ said beregond.
‘that is what we call ourselves,’ said pippin.
‘i am glad to learn it,’ said beregond, ‘for now i may say that strange accents do not mar fair speech, and hobbits are a fair-spoken folk. but come! you shall make me acquainted with this good horse. i love beasts, and we see them seldom in this stony city; for my people came from the mountain-vales, and before that from ithilien. but fear not! the visit shall be short, a mere call of courtesy, and we will go thence to the butteries.’
pippin found that shadowfax had been well housed a

nd tended. for in the sixth circle, outside the walls of the citadel, there were some fair stables where a few swift horses were kept, hard by the lodgings of the errand-riders of the lord: messengers always ready to go at the urgent command of denethor or his chief captains. but now all the horses and the riders were out and away.
shadowfax whinnied as pippin entered the stable and turned his head. ‘good morning!’ said pippin. ‘gandalf will come as soon as he may. he is busy, but he sends greetings, and i am to see that all is well with you; and you resting, i hope, after your long labours.’
shadowfax tossed his head and stamped. but he allowed beregond to handle his head gently and stroke his great flanks.
‘he looks as if he were spoiling for a race, and not newly come from a great journey,’ said beregond. ‘how strong and proud he is! where is his harness? it should be rich and fair.’
‘none is rich an

d fair enough for him,’ said pippin. ‘he will have none. if he will consent to bear you, bear you he does; and if not, well, no bit, bridle, whip, or thong will tame him. farewell, shadowfax! have patience. battle is coming.’
shadowfax lifted up his head and neighed, so that the stable shook, and they covered their ears. then they took their leave, seeing that the manger was well filled.
‘and now for our manger,’ said beregond, and he led pippin back to the citadel, and so to a door in the north side of the great tower. there they went down a long cool stair into a wide alley lit with lamps. there were hatches in the walls at the side, and one of these was open.
‘this is the storehouse and buttery of my company of the guard.’ said beregond. ‘greetings, targon!’ he called through the hatch. ‘it is early yet, but here is a newcomer that the lord has taken into his service. he has ridden long and far with a tight belt, and has h

they got there bread, and butter, and cheese and apples: the last of the winter store, wrinkled but sound and sweet; and a leather flagon of new-drawn ale, and wooden platters and cups. they put all into a wicker basket and climbed back into the sun; and beregond brought pippin to a place at the east end of the great out-thrust battlement where there was an embrasure in the walls with a stone seat beneath the sill. from there they could look out on the morning over the world.
they ate and drank; and they talked now of gondor and its ways and customs, now of the shire and the strange countries that pippin had seen. and ever as they talked beregond was more amazed, and looked with greater wonder at the hobbit, swinging his short legs as he sat on the seat, or standing t

iptoe upon it to peer over the sill at the lands below.
‘i will not hide from you, master peregrin,’ said beregond, ‘that to us you look almost as one of our children, a lad of nine summers or so; and yet you have endured perils and seen marvels that few of our greybeards could boast of. i thought it was the whim of our lord to take him a noble page, after the manner of the kings of old, they say. but i see that it is not so, and you must pardon my foolishness.’
‘i do,’ said pippin. ‘though you are not far wrong. i am still little more than a boy in the reckoning of my own people, and it will be four years yet before i “come of age”, as we say in the shire: but do not bother about me. come and look and tell me what i can see.’
the sun was now climbing, and the mists in the vale below had been drawn up. the last of them were floating away, just overhead, as wisps of white cloud borne on the stiffening breeze from the east, that was now flapping and tugging the flag

s and white standards of the citadel. away down in the valley-bottom, five leagues or so as the eye leaps, the great river could now be seen grey and glittering, coming out of the north-west, and bending in a mighty sweep south and west again, till it was lost to view in a haze and shimmer, far beyond which lay the sea fifty leagues away.
pippin could see all the pelennor laid out before him, dotted into the distance with farmsteads and little walls, barns and byres, but nowhere could he see any kine or other beasts. many roads and tracks crossed the green fields, and there was much coming and going: wains moving in lines towards the great gate, and others passing out. now and again a horseman would ride up, and leap from the saddle and hasten into the city. but most of the traffic went out along the chief highway, and that turned sout

h, and then bending swifter than the river skirted the hills and passed soon from sight. it was wide and well-paved, and along its eastern edge ran a broad green riding-track, and beyond that a wall. on the ride horsemen galloped to and fro, but all the street seemed to be choked with great covered wains going south. but soon pippin saw that all was in fact well-ordered: the wains were moving in three lines, one swifter drawn by horses; another slower, great waggons with fair housings of many colours, drawn by oxen; and along the west rim of the road many smaller carts hauled by trudging men.
‘that is the road to the vales of tumladen and lossarnach, and the mountain-villages, and then on to lebennin,’ said beregond. ‘there go the last of the wains that bear away to refuge the aged the children, and the women that mu

st go with them. they must all be gone from the gate and the road clear for a league before noon: that was the order. it is a sad necessity.’ he sighed. ‘few, maybe, of those now sundered will meet again. and there were always too few children in this city; but now there are none-save some young lads that will not depart, and may find some task to do: my own son is one of them.’
they fell silent for a while. pippin gazed anxiously eastward, as if at any moment he might see thousands of orcs pouring over the fields. ‘what can i see there?’ he asked, pointing down to the middle of the great curve of the anduin. ‘is that another city, or what is it?’
‘it was a city,’ said beregond, ‘the chief city of gondor, of which this was only a fortress. for that is the ruin of osgiliath on either side of anduin, which our enemies took and burned long ago. yet we won it back in the days of the youth of den

ethor: not to dwell in, but to hold as an outpost, and to rebuild the bridge for the passage of our arms. and then came the fell riders out of minas morgul.’
‘the black riders?’ said pippin, opening his eyes, and they were wide and dark with an old fear re-awakened.
‘yes, they were black,’ said beregond, ‘and i see that you know something of them, though you have not spoken of them in any of your tales.’
‘i know of them,’ said pippin softly, ‘but i will not speak of them now, so near, so near.’ he broke off and lifted his eyes above the river, and it seemed to him that all he could see was a vast and threatening shadow. perhaps it was mountains looming on the verge of sight, their jagged edges softened by wellnigh twenty leagues of misty air; perhaps it was but a cloud-wall, and beyond that again a yet deeper gloom. but even as he looked it seemed to his eyes that the gloom was growing and gathering, very slowly, slowly

it seems fainter and more distant; sometimes nearer and darker. it is growing and darkening now; and therefore our fear and disquiet grow too. and the fell riders, less than a year ago they won back the crossings, and many of our best men were slain. boromir it was that drove the enemy at last back from this western shore, and we hold still the near half of osgiliath. for a little while. but we await now a new onslaught there. maybe the chief onslaught of the war that comes.’
‘when?’ said pippin. ‘have you a guess? for i saw the beacons last night and the errand-riders; and gandalf said that it was a sign that war had begun. he seemed in a desperate hurry. but now everything seems to have slowed up again.’
‘only because everything is now ready,’ said beregond. ‘it is but the deep breath before the plunge.’
‘but why were the beacons lit last night?’
‘it is over-late to send for aid when you are already besieged,’ answered beregond. ‘but i do not know the counsel of

‘yet, master peregrin, we have this honour: ever we bear the brunt of the chief hatred of the dark lord, for that hatred comes down out of the depths of time and over the deeps of the sea. here will the hammer-stroke fall hardest. and for that reason mithrandir came hither in such haste. for if we fall, who shall stand? and, master peregrin, do you see any hope that we shall stand?’
pippin did not answer. he looked at the great walls, and the towers and brave banners, and the sun in the high sky, and then at the gathering gloom in the east; and he thought of the long fingers of that shadow: of the orcs in the woods and the mountains, the treason of isengard, the birds of evil eye, and the black riders even in the lanes of the shire - and of the winged terror, the nazgûl. he shuddered, and hope seemed to wither. and even at that moment the sun for a second faltered and was obscur

ed, as though a dark wing had passed across it. almost beyond hearing he thought he caught, high and far up in the heavens, a cry: faint, but heart-quelling, cruel and cold. he blanched and cowered against the wall.
‘what was that?’ asked beregond. ‘you also felt something?’
‘yes,’ muttered pippin. ‘it is the sign of our fall, and the shadow of doom, a fell rider of the air.’
‘yes, the shadow of doom,’ said beregond. ‘i fear that minas tirith shall fall. night comes. the very warmth of my blood seems stolen away.’
for a time they sat together with bowed heads and did not speak. then suddenly pippin looked up and saw that the sun was still shining and the banners still streaming in the breeze. he shook himself. ‘it is passed,’ he said. ‘no, my heart will not yet despair.

 upon our knees.’
‘rightly said!’ cried beregond, rising and striding to and fro. ‘nay, though all things must come utterly to an end in time, gondor shall not perish yet. not though the walls be taken by a reckless foe that will build a hill of carrion before them. there are still other fastnesses, and secret ways of escape into the mountains. hope and memory shall live still in some hidden valley where the grass is green.’
‘all the same, i wish it was over for good or ill.’ said pippin. ‘i am no warrior at all and dislike any thought of battle; but waiting on the edge of one that i can’t escape is worst of all. what a long day it seems already! i should be happier, if we were not obliged to stand and watch, making no move, striking nowhere first. no stroke would have been struck in rohan, i think, but for gandalf.’
‘ah, there you lay your finger on the sore that many feel!’ said beregond. ‘but things may change when faramir returns. he is bold, more bold than many

 deem; for in these days men are slow to believe that a captain can be wise and learned in the scrolls of lore and song, as he is, and yet a man of hardihood and swift judgement in the field. but such is faramir. less reckless and eager than boromir, but not less resolute. yet what indeed can he do? we cannot assault the mountains of - of yonder realm. our reach is shortened, and we cannot strike till some foe comes within it. then our hand must be heavy!’ he smote the hilt of his sword.
pippin looked at him: tall and proud and noble, as all the men that he had yet seen in that land; and with a glitter in his eye as he thought of the battle. ‘alas! my own hand feels as light as a feather,’ he thought, but he said nothing. ‘a pawn did gandalf say? perhaps but on the wrong chessboard.’
so they talked until the sun reached its height, and suddenly the noon-bells were rung, and there was a stir in the citadel; for all save the watchmen were going to their meal.
‘will you come wi

‘i shall be glad to come,’ said pippin. ‘i am lonely, to tell you the truth. i left my best friend behind in rohan, and i have had no one to talk to or jest with. perhaps i could really join your company? are you the captain? if so, you could take me on, or speak for me?’
‘nay, nay,’ beregond laughed, ‘i am no captain. neither office nor rank nor lordship have i, being but a plain man of arms of the third company of the citadel. yet, master peregrin, to be only a man of arms of the guard of the tower of gondor is held wort

hy in the city, and such men have honour in the land.’
‘then it is far beyond me,’ said pippin. ‘take me back to our room, and if gandalf is not there, i will go where you like - as your guest.’
gandalf was not in the lodging and had sent no message; so pippin went with beregond and was made known to the men of the third company. and it seemed that beregond got as much honour from it as his guest, for pippin was very welcome. there had already been much talk in the citadel about mithrandir’s companion and his long closeting with the lord; and rumour declared that a prince of the halflings had come out of the north to offer allegiance to gondor and five thousand swords. and some said that when the riders came from rohan each would bring behind him a halfling warrior, small maybe, but doughty.
though pippin had regretfully to destroy this hopeful tale, he could not be rid of his new rank, only fitt

he went out, and soon after all the others followed. the day was still fine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for march, even so far southwards. pippin felt sleepy, but the lodging seemed cheerless, and he decided to go down and explore the city. he took a few morsels that he had saved to shadowfax, and they were graciously accepted, though the horse seemed to have no lack. then he walked on down many winding ways.
people stared much as he passed. to his face men were gravely courteous, saluting him after the manner of gondor with bowed head and hands upon the breast; but behind him he heard many calls, as those out of doors cried to others wi

d pavements to the lowest and widest circle, and there he was directed to the lampwrights’ street, a broad way running towards the great gate. in it he found the old guesthouse, a large building of grey weathered stone with two wings running back from the street, and between them a narrow greensward, behind which was the many-windowed house, fronted along its whole width by a pillared porch and a flight of steps down on to the grass. boys were playing among the pillars, the only children that pippin had seen in minas tirith, and he stopped to look at them. presently one of them caught sight of him, and with a shout he sprang across the grass and came into the street, followed by several others. there he stood in front of pippin, looking him up and down.
‘greetings!’ said the lad. ‘where do you come from? you are a stranger in the city.’
‘i was,’ said pippin; ‘but they say i have become a man of gondor.’
‘oh come!’ said the lad. ‘then we are all men here. but how old a

‘which question shall i answer first?’ said pippin. ‘my father farms the lands round whitwell near tuckborough in the shire. i am nearly twenty-nine, so i pass you there; though i am but four feet, and not likely to grow any more, save sideways.’
‘twenty-nine!’ said the lad and whistled. ‘why, you are quite old! as old as my uncle iorlas. still,’ he added hopefully, ‘i wager i could stand you on your head or lay you on your back.’
‘maybe you could, if i let you,’ said pippin with a laugh. ‘and maybe i could do the same to

‘no!’ pippin laughed. ‘don’t believe what strangers say of themselves either! i am not a fighter. but it would be politer in any case for the challenger to say who he is.’
the boy drew himself up proudly. ‘i am bergil son of beregond of the guards,’ he said.
‘so i thought,’ said pippin, ‘for you look like your father. i know him and he sen

‘then why did you not say so at once?’ said bergil, and suddenly a look of dismay came over his face. ‘do not tell me that he has changed his mind, and will send me away with the maidens! but no, the last wains have gone.’
‘his message is less bad than that, if not good.’ said pippin. ‘he says that if you would prefer it to standing me on my head, you might show me round the city for a while and cheer my loneliness. i can tell you some tales of far countries in return.’
bergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. ‘all is well,’ he cried. ‘come then! we were soon going to the gate to look on. we will go now.’
‘what is happening there?’
‘the captains of the outlands are expected up the south road ere sundown. come with us and you will see.’

roved a good comrade, the best company pippin had had since he parted from merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate. there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil, for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him.
‘that is good!’ said bergil. ‘we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate without an elder. now we shall see better.’
beyond the gate there was a crowd of men along the verge of the road and of the great paved space into which all the ways to minas tirith ran. all eyes were turned southward

s, and soon a murmur rose: ‘there is dust away there! they are coming!’
pippin and bergil edged their way forward to the front of the crowd, and waited. horns sounded at some distance, and the noise of cheering rolled towards them like a gathering wind. then there was a loud trumpet-blast, and all about them people were shouting.
‘forlong! forlong!’ pippin heard men calling. ‘what do they say?’ he asked.
‘forlong has come,’ bergil answered; ‘old forlong the fat, the lord of lossarnach. that is where my grandsire lives. hurrah! here he is. good old forlong!’
leading the line there came walking a big thick-limbed horse, and on it sat a man of wide shoulders and huge girth, but old and grey-bearded, yet mail-clad and black-helmed and bearing a long heavy spear. behind him marched proudly a dusty line of men, well-armed and bearing great

battle-axes; grim-faced they were, and shorter and somewhat swarthier than any men that pippin had yet seen in gondor.
‘forlong!’ men shouted. ‘true heart, true friend! forlong!’ but when the men of lossarnach had passed they muttered: ‘so few! two hundreds, what are they? we hoped for ten times the number. that will be the new tidings of the black fleet. they are sparing only a tithe of their strength. still every little is a gain.’
and so the companies came and were hailed and cheered and passed through the gate, men of the outlands marching to defend the city of gondor in

grey horses; and behind them seven hundreds of men at arms, tall as lords, grey-eyed, dark-haired, singing as they came.
and that was all, less than three thousands full told. no more would come. their cries and the tramp of their feet passed into the city and died away. the onlookers stood silent for a while. dust hung in the air, for the wind had died and the evening was heavy. already the closing hour was drawing nigh, and the red sun had gone behind mindolluin. shadow came down on the city.
pippin looked up, and it seemed to him that the sky had grown ashen-grey, as if a vast dust and smoke hung above them, and light came dully through it. but in the west the dying sun had set all the fume on fire, and now mindolluin stood black against a burning smoulder flecked with embers. ‘so ends a fair day in wrath!’ he said forgetful of the lad at his side.
‘so it will, if i have not returned before the sundown-bells,’ said bergil. ‘come! there goes the trumpet for the closing of the gat

s time,’ said bergil. ‘take my greetings to my :father, and thank him for the company that he sent. come again soon, i beg. almost i wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry times. we might have journeyed to lossarnach, to my grandsire’s house; it is good to be there in spring, the woods and fields are full of flowers. but maybe we will go thither together yet. they will never overcome our lord, and my father is very valiant. farewell and return!’
they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel. it seemed a long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and dark. not a star pricked the sky. he was late for the daymeal in the mess, and beregond greeted him gladly, and sat him at his side to hear news of his son. after the meal pippin stayed a while, and then took his leave, for a strange gloom was on him, and now he desired very much to see gandalf again.
‘can you find your way?’ said beregond at the door of the small hall, o

they had sat. ‘it is a black night, and all the blacker since orders came that lights are to be dimmed within the city, and none are to shine out from the walls. and i can give you news of another order: you will be summoned to the lord denethor early tomorrow. i fear you will not be for the third company. still we may hope to meet again. farewell and sleep in peace!’
the lodging was dark, save for a little lantern set on the table. gandalf was not there. gloom settled still more heavily on pippin. he climbed on the bench and tried to peer out of a window, but it was like looking into a pool of ink. he got down and closed the shutter and went to bed. for a while he lay and listened for sounds of gandalf’s return, and then he fell into an uneasy sleep.
in the night he was wakened by a light, and he saw that gandalf had come and was pacing to and fro in the room beyond the curtain of the alcove. there were candles on the table and rolls of parchment. he heard the wizard sigh, and mutter:

 ‘when will faramir return?’
‘hullo!’ said pippin, poking his head round the curtain. ‘i thought you had forgotten all about me. i am glad to see you back. it has been a long day.’
‘but the night will be too short,’ said gandalf. ‘i have come back here, for i must have a little peace, alone. you should sleep, in a bed while you still may. at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again. no, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. the darkness has begun. there will be no dawn.’

come and see how it was! and there are caves, merry, caves of wonder! shall we visit them, legolas, do you think?’
‘nay! there is no time,’ said the elf. ‘do not spoil the wonder with haste! i have given you my word to return hither with you, if a day of peace and freedom comes again. but it is now near to noon, and at that hour we eat, and then set out again, i hear.’
merry got up and yawned. his few hours’ sleep had not been nearly enough; he was tired and rather dismal. he missed pippin, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand. ‘where is aragorn?’ he asked.
‘in a high chamber of the burg,’ said legolas. ‘he has neither rested nor slept, i think. he went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take thought, and only his kinsman, halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.’
‘they are a strange company, these newcomers,’ said gimli. ‘stout men and lord

‘farewell, lord!’ said aragorn. ‘ride unto great renown! farewell, merry! i leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn. legolas and gimli will still hunt with me, i hope; but we shall not forget you.’
‘good-bye!’ said merry. he could find no more to say. he felt very small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin. the riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start arid get it over.
now théoden spoke to éomer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word the riders set forth. they rode over the dike and down the coomb, and then, turning swiftly eastwards, they took a path that skirted the foothills for a mile or so, until bending south it passed back among the hills and disappeared from view. aragorn rode to the dike and watched till the king’s men wer

e township and the fords of ciril they found deserted, for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour of the coming of the king of the dead. but the next day there came no dawn, and the grey company passed on into the darkness of the storm of mordor and were lost to mortal sight; but the dead followed them.

chapter 3

the muster of rohan

now all roads were running together to the east to meet the coming of war and the onset of the shadow. and even as pippin stood at the great gate of the city and saw the prince of dol amroth ride in with his banners, the king of rohan came down out of the hills.
day was waning. in the last rays of the sun the riders cast long pointed shadows that went on before them. darkness had already crept beneath the murmuring fir-woods that clothed the steep mountain-sides. the king rode now slowly at the end of the day. presently the path turned round a huge bare shoulder of rock and plunged into the gloom of soft-sighing t

norous speech of rohan that he heard the men behind him using. it was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire, yet he could not piece the words together. at times some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.
all the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the day’s end. he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to; and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli. then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of frodo and sam. ‘i am forgetting them!’ he said to himself reproachfully. ‘and yet they are more important than all the rest of us. and i came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away, if they are still alive.’ he shivered.
‘harrowdale at last!’ said éomer. ‘our journey is almost at an end.’ they halted. the paths out of the narrow gorge

 fro, going in to the king and taking counsel with him. night came on, and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars, but the east was dark and blank. the marching stones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg.
‘the paths of the dead,’ he muttered to himself. ‘the paths of the dead? what does all this mean? they have all left me now. they have all gone to some doom: gandalf and pippin to war in the east; and sam and frodo to mordor; and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead. but my turn will come soon enough, i suppose. i wonder what they are all talking about, and what the king means to do. for i must go where he goes now.’
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. but at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning hi

 the wold of rohan.
‘ride on! ride on!’ cried éomer. ‘too late now to turn aside. the fens of entwash must guard our flank. haste now we need. ride on!’
and so king théoden departed from his own realm, and mile by mile the long road wound away, and the beacon hills marched past: calenhad, min-rimmon, erelas, nardol. but their fires were quenched. all the lands were grey and still; and ever the shadow deepened before them, and hope waned in every heart.

chapter 4

the siege of gondor

pippin was roused by gandalf. candles were lit in their chamber, for only a dim twilight came through the windows; the air was heavy as with approaching thunder.
‘what is the time?’ said pippin yawning.
‘past the second hour,’ said gandalf. ‘time to get up and make yourself presentable. you are summoned to the lord of the city to learn your new duties.’
‘and will he provide breakfast?’
‘no! i have provided it: all that you will get till noon. food is now doled out by order.’
pippin

 looked ruefully at the small loaf and (he thought) very inadequate pat of butter which was set out for him, beside a cup of thin milk. ‘why did you bring me here?’ he said.
‘you know quite well,’ said gandalf. ‘to keep you out of mischief; and if you do not like being here, you can remember that you brought it on yourself.’ pippin said no more.
before long he was walking with gandalf once more down the cold corridor to the door of the tower hall. there denethor sat in a grey gloom, like an old patient spider, pippin thought: he did not seem to have moved since the day before. he beckoned gandalf to a seat, but pippin was left for a while standing unheeded. presently the old man turned to him:
‘well, master peregrin, i hope that you used yesterday to your profit, and to your liking? though i fear that the board is barer

pippin had an uncomfortable feeling that most of what he had said or done was somehow known to the lord of the city, and much was guessed of what he thought as well. he did not answer.
‘what would you do in my service?’
‘i thought, sir, that you would tell me my duties.’
‘i will, when i learn what you are fit for,’ said denethor. ‘but that i shall learn soonest, maybe, if i keep you beside me. the esquire of my chamber has begged leave to go to the out-garrison, so you shall take his pla

‘yes,’ said pippin. ‘well, yes, well enough for my own people. but we have no songs fit for great halls and evil times, lord. we seldom sing of anything more terrible than wind or rain. and most of my songs are about things that make us laugh; or about food and drink, of course.’
‘and why should such songs be unfit for my halls, or for such hours as these? we who have lived long under the shadow may surely listen to echoes from a land untroubled by it? then we may feel that our vigil was not fruitless, thou

pippin’s heart sank. he did not relish the idea of singing any song of the shire to the lord of minas tirith, certainly not the comic ones that he knew best; they were too, well, rustic for such an occasion. he was however spared the ordeal for the present. he was not commanded to sing. denethor turned to gandalf, asking questions about the rohirrim and their policies, and the position of éomer, the king’s nephew. pippin marvelled at the amount that the lord seemed to know about a people that lived far away, though it must, he thought, be many years since denethor himself had ridden abroad.
presently denethor waved to pippin and dismissed him again for a while. ‘go to the armouries of the citadel,’ he said, ‘and get you there the livery and gear of the tower. it will be ready. it was commanded yesterday. return when you are clad!’
it was as he said; and pippin soon found himself arrayed in strange garme

 felt uncomfortable. and the gloom began to weigh on his spirits.
it was dark and dim all day. from the sunless dawn until evening the heavy shadow had deepened, and all hearts in the city were oppressed. far above a great cloud streamed slowly westward from the black land, devouring light, borne upon a wind of war; but below the air was still and breathless, as if all the vale of anduin waited for the onset of a ruinous storm.
about the eleventh hour, released at last for a while from service. pippin came out and went in search of food and drink to cheer his heavy heart and make his task of waiting more supportable. in the messes he met beregond again, who had just come from an errand over the pelennor out to the guard-towers upon the causeway. together they strolled out to the walls; for pippin felt imprisoned indoors, and stifled even in the lofty citadel. now they sat side by side again in the embrasure looking eastward, where they had eaten and talked the day before.
it was the sunset-h

our, but the great pall had now stretched far into the west, and only as it sank at last into the sea did the sun escape to send out a brief farewell gleam before the night, even as frodo saw it at the cross-roads touching the head of the fallen king. but to the fields of the pelennor, under the shadow of mindolluin, there came no gleam: they were brown and drear.
already it seemed years to pippin since he had sat there before, in some half-forgotten time when he had still been a hobbit, a light-hearted wanderer touched little by the perils he had passed through. now he was one small soldier in a city preparing for a great assault, clad in the proud but sombre manner of the tower of guard.
in some other time and place pippin might have been pleased with his new array, but he knew now that he was taking part in no play; he was in deadly earnest the servant of a grim master in the greatest

 peril. the hauberk was burdensome, and the helm weighed upon his head. his cloak he had cast aside upon the seat. he turned his tired gaze away from the darkling fields below and yawned, and then he sighed.
‘you are weary of this day?’ said beregond.
‘yes,’ said pippin, ‘very: tired out with idleness and waiting. i have kicked my heels at the door of my master’s chamber for many slow hours, while he has debated with gandalf and the prince and other great persons. and i’m not used, master beregond, to waiting hungry on others while they eat. it is a sore trial for a hobbit, that. no doubt you will think i should feel the honour more deeply. but what is the good of such honour? indeed what is the good even of food and drink under this creeping shadow? wha

t does it mean? the very air seems thick and brown! do you often have such glooms when the wind is in the east?’
‘nay,’ said beregond, ‘this is no weather of the world. this is some device of his malice; some broil of fume from the mountain of fire that he sends to darken hearts and counsel. and so it doth indeed. i wish the lord faramir would return. he would not be dismayed. but now, who knows if he will ever come back across the river out of the darkness?’
‘yes,’ said pippin, ‘gandalf, too, is anxious. he was disappointed. i think, not to find faramir here. and where has he got to himself? he left the lord’s council before the noon-meal, and in no good mood either, i thought. perhaps he has some foreboding of bad news.’
suddenly as they talked they were stricken dumb, frozen as it were to listening stones. pippin cowered down with his hands pressed to his ears; but beregond, who had been looking out from the battlement as he spoke of faramir, remained there,

stiffened, staring out with starting eyes. pippin knew the shuddering cry that he had heard: it was the same that he had heard long ago in the marish of the shire, but now it was grown in power and hatred, piercing the heart with a poisonous despair.
at last beregond spoke with an effort. ‘they have come!’ he said. ‘take courage and look! there are fell things below.’
reluctantly pippin climbed on to the seat and looked out over the wall. the pelennor lay dim beneath him, fading away to the scarce guessed line of the great river. but now wheeling swiftly across it, like shadows of untimely night, he saw in the middle airs below him five birdlike forms, horrible as carrion-fowl yet greater than eagles, cruel as death. now they swooped near, venturing almost within bowshot of the walls, now they circled away.
‘black riders!’ muttered pippin. ‘black riders of the air! but s

ok! they hold on. they will make the gate. no! the horses are running mad. look! the men are thrown; they are running on foot. no, one is still up, but he rides back to the others. that will be the captain: he can master both beasts and men. ah! there one of the foul things is stooping on him. help! help! will no one go out to him? faramir!’
with that beregond sprang away and ran off into the gloom. ashamed of his terror, while beregond of the guard thought first of the captain whom he loved, pippin got up and peered out. at that moment he caught a flash of white and silver coming from the north, like a small star down on the dusky fields. it moved with the speed of an arrow and grew as it came, converging swiftly with the flight of the four men towards the gate. it seemed to pippin that a pale light was spread about it and the heavy shadows gave way before it; and then as it drew near he thought that he heard, like an echo in the walls, a great voice calling.
‘gandalf!’ he cried. ‘g

but now the dark swooping shadows were aware of the newcomer. one wheeled towards him; but it seemed to pippin that he raised his hand, and from it a shaft of white light stabbed upwards. the nazgûl gave a long wailing cry and swerved away; and with that the four others wavered, and then rising in swift spirals they passed away eastward vanishing into the lowering cloud above; and down on the pelennor it seemed for a while less dark.
pippin watched, and he saw the horseman and the white rider meet and halt, waiting for those on foot. men now hurried out to them from the city; and soon they all passed f

rom sight under the outer walls, and he knew that they were entering the gate. guessing that they would come at once to the tower and the steward, he hurried to the entrance of the citadel. there he was joined by many others who had watched the race and the rescue from the high walls.
it was not long before a clamour was heard in the streets leading up from the outer circles, and there was much cheering and crying of the names of faramir and mithrandir. presently pippin saw torches, and followed by a press of people two horsemen riding slowly: one was in white but shining no longer, pale in the twilight as if his fire was spent or veiled; the other was dark and his head was bowed. they dismounted, and as grooms took shadowfax and the other horse, they walked forward to the sentinel at the gate: gandalf steadily, his grey cloak flung back, and a fire still smouldering in his eyes; the other, clad all in green, slowly, swaying a little as a weary or a wounded ma

pippin pressed forward as they passed under the lamp beneath the gate-arch, and when he saw the pale face of faramir he caught his breath. it was the face of one who has been assailed by a great fear or anguish, but has mastered it and now is quiet. proud and grave he stood for a moment as he spoke to the guard, and pippin gazing at him saw how closely he resembled his brother boromir - whom pippin had liked from the first, admiring the great man’s lordly but kindly manner. yet suddenly for faramir his heart was strangely moved with a feeling that he had not known before. here was one with an air of high nobility such as aragorn at times revealed, less high perhaps, yet also less incalculable and remote: one of the kings of men born into a later time, but touched with the wisdom and sadness of the elder race. he knew now why beregond spoke his name with love. he was a captain that men w

oked down at him and was amazed.
‘whence come you?’ he said. ‘a halfling, and in the livery of the tower! whence…?’
but with that gandalf stepped to his side and spoke. ‘he came with me from the land of the halflings,’ he said. ‘he came with me. but let us not tarry here. there is much to say and to do, and you are weary. he shall come with us. indeed he must, for if he does not forget his new duties more easily than i do, he must attend on his lord again within this hour. come, pippin, follow us!’
so at length they came to the private chamber of the lord of the city. there deep seats were set about a brazier of charcoal; and wine was brought; and there pippin, hardly noticed, stood behind the chair of denethor and felt his weariness little, so eagerly did he listen to all that was said.
when faramir had taken white bread and drunk a draught of wine, he sat upon a low chair at his father’s left hand. removed a little upon the other side sat gandalf in a chair of carven wo

t first to be asleep. for at the beginning faramir spoke only of the errand upon which he had been sent out ten days before, and he brought tidings of ithilien and of movements of the enemy and his allies; and he told of the fight on the road when the men of harad and their great beast were overthrown: a captain reporting to his master such matters as had often been heard before, small things of border-war that now seemed useless and petty, shorn of their renown.
then suddenly faramir looked at pippin. ‘but now we come to strange matters,’ he said. ‘for this is not the first halfling that i have seen walking out of northern legends into the southlands.’
at that gandalf sat up and gripped the arms of his chair; but he said nothing, and with a look stopped the exclamation on pippin’s lips. denethor looked at their faces and nodded his head, as though in sign that he had read much there before it was spoken. slowly, while the others sat silent and still, faramir told his tale, with hi

s eyes for the most part on gandalf, though now and again his glance strayed to pippin, as if to refresh his memory of others that he had seen.
as his story was unfolded of his meeting with frodo and his servant and of the events at henneth annûn, pippin became aware that gandalf’s hands were trembling as they clutched the carven wood. white they seemed now and very old, and as he looked at them, suddenly with a thrill of fear pippin knew that gandalf, gandalf himself, was troubled, even afraid. the air of the room was close and still. at last when faramir spoke of his parting with the travellers, and of their resolve to go to cirith ungol, his voice fell, and he shook his head and sighed. then gandalf sprang up.
‘cirith ungol? morgul vale?’ he said. ‘the time, faramir, the time? when did you part with them? when would they reach that accursed valley?’
‘i parted with them in the morning two days ago,’ said faram

 boromir. nay, stay your wrath! i do not trust myself in this, and i refused this thing, even as a freely given gift. you are strong and can still in some matters govern yourself, denethor; yet if you had received this thing, it would have overthrown you. were it buried beneath the roots of mindolluin, still it would burn your mind away, as the darkness grows, and the yet worse things follow that soon shall come upon us.’
for a moment the eyes of denethor glowed again as he faced gandalf, and pippin felt once more the strain between their wills; but now almost it seemed as if their glances were like blades from eye to eye, flickering as they fenced. pippin trembled fearing some dreadful stroke. but suddenly denethor relaxed and grew cold again. he shrugged his shoulders.
‘if i had! if you had!’ he said. ‘such words and ifs are vain. it has gone into the shadow, and only time will show what doom awaits it and us. the time will not be long. in what is left, let all who fight the enemy

our leave, father?’ and then he swayed and leaned upon his father’s chair.
‘you are weary, i see,’ said denethor. ‘you have ridden fast and far, and under shadows of evil in the air, i am told.’
‘let us not speak of that!’ said faramir.
‘then we will not,’ said denethor. ‘go now and rest as you may. tomorrow’s need will be sterner.’
all now took leave of the lord of the city and went to rest while they still could. outside there was a starless blackness as gandalf with pippin beside him bearing a small torch, made his way to their lodging. they did not speak until they were behind closed doors. then at last pippin took gandalf’s hand.
‘tell me,’ he said, ‘is there any hope? for frodo, i mean; or at least mostly for frodo.’
gandalf put his hand on pippin’s head. ‘there never was much hope,’ he answered. ‘just a fool’s hope, as i have been told. and when i heard of cirith ungol---‘ he broke off and strode to the window as if his eyes could pierce

 the night in the east. ‘cirith ungol!’ he muttered. ‘why that way, i wonder?’ he turned. ‘just now, pippin, my heart almost failed me, hearing that name. and yet in truth i believe that the news that faramir brings has some hope in it. for it seems clear that our enemy has opened his war at last and made the first move while frodo was still free. so now for many days he will have his eye turned this way and that, away from his own land. and yet, pippin, i feel from afar his haste and fear. he has begun sooner than he would. something has happened to stir him.’
gandalf stood for a moment in thought. ‘maybe,’ he muttered. ‘maybe even your foolishness helped, my lad. let me see: some five days ago now he would discover that we had thrown down saruman and had taken the stone. still what of that? we could not use it to much purpose, or without his knowing. ah! i wonder. aragorn? his time draws near. and he is strong and stern underneath, p

‘but,’ said pippin.
‘but what?’ said gandalf. ‘only one but will i allow tonight.’
‘gollum,’ said pippin. ‘how on earth could they be going about with him, even following him? and i could see that faramir did not like the place he was taking them to any more than you do. what is wrong?’
‘i cannot answer that now,’ said gandalf. ‘yet my heart guessed that frodo and gollum would meet before the end. for good, or for evil. but of cirith ungol i will not speak tonight. treachery, treachery i fear; treachery of that miserable creature. but so it must be. let us remember that a traitor may bet

days ago, and the miles are long from edoras.’
it was night again ere news came. a man rode in haste from the fords, saying that a host had issued from minas morgul and was already drawing nigh to osgiliath; and it had been joined by regiments from the south, haradrim, cruel and tall. ‘and we have learned ‘ said the messenger, ‘that the black captain leads them once again, and the fear of him has passed before him over the river.’
with those ill-boding words the third day closed since pippin came to minas tirith. few went to rest, for small hope had any now that even faramir could hold the fords for long.
the next day, though the darkness had reached its full and grew no deeper, it weighed heavier on men’s hearts, and a great dread was on them. ill news came soon again. the passage of anduin was won by the enemy. faramir was retreating to the wall of the pelennor, rallying his men to the causeway forts; but he was ten times outnumbered.
‘if he wins back at all across the pelenn

the plan has been well laid. it is now seen that in secret they have long been building floats and barges in great numbers in east osgiliath. they swarmed across like beetles. but it is the black captain that defeats us. few will stand and abide even the rumour of his coming. his own folk quail at him, and they would slay themselves at his bidding.’
‘then i am needed there more than here,’ said gandalf, and rode off at once, and the glimmer of him faded soon from sight. and all that night pippin alone and sleepless stood upon the wall and gazed eastward.
the bells of day had scarcely rung out again, a mockery in the unlightened dark, when far away he saw fires spring up, across in the dim spaces where the walls of the pelennor stood. the watchmen cried aloud, and all men in the city stood to arms. now ever and anon there was a red flash, and slowly through the heavy air dull rumbles could be heard.
‘they have taken the wall!’ men cried. ‘they are blasting breaches in it. they are

 coming!’
‘where is faramir?’ cried beregond in dismay. ‘say not that he has fallen!’
it was gandalf that brought the first tidings. with a handful of horsemen he came in the middle morning, riding as escort to a line of wains. they were filled with wounded men, all that could be saved from the wreck of the causeway forts. at once he went to denethor. the lord of the city sat now in a high chamber above the hall of the white tower with pippin at his side; and through the dim windows, north and south and east, he bent his dark eyes, as if to pierce the shadows of doom that ringed him round. most to the north he looked, and would pause at whiles to listen as if by some ancient art his ears might hear the thunder of hoofs on the plains far away.
‘is faramir come?’ he asked.
‘no,’ said gandalf. ‘but he still lived when i left him. yet he is resolved to stay with the rearguard, lest the retreat over the pelennor become a rout.

he may, perhaps, hold his men together long enough, but i doubt it. he is pitted against a foe too great. for one has come that i feared.’
‘not - the dark lord?’ cried pippin, forgetting his place in his terror.
denethor laughed bitterly. ‘nay, not yet, master peregrin! he will not come save only to triumph over me when all is won. he uses others as his weapons. so do all great lords, if they are wise, master halfling. or why should i sit here in my tower and think, and watch, and wait, spending even my sons? for i can still wield a brand.’
he stood up and cast open his long black cloak, and behold! he was clad in mail beneath, and girt with a long sword, great-

‘then, mithrandir, you had a foe to match you,’ said denethor. ‘for myself, i have long known who is the chief captain of the hosts of the dark tower. is this all that you have returned to say? or can it be that you have withdrawn because you are overmatched?’
pippin trembled, fearing that gandalf would be stung to sudden wrath, but his fear was needless. ‘it might be so,’ gandalf answered softly. ‘but our trial of strength is not yet come. and if words spoken of old be true, not by the hand of man shall he fall, and hidden from the wise is the doom that awaits him. however that may be, the captain of despair does not press forward, yet. he rules rather according to the wisdom that you have just spoken, from the rear, driving his slaves in madness on

but the face of the lord was grey, more deathlike than his son’s.
so now at last the city was besieged, enclosed in a ring of foes. the rammas was broken, and all the pelennor abandoned to the enemy. the last word to come from outside the walls was brought by men flying down the northward road ere the gate was shut. they were the remnant of the guard that was kept at that point where the way from anórien and rohan ran into the townlands: ingold led them, the same who had admitted gandalf and pippin less than five days before, while the sun still rose and there was hope in the morning.
‘there is no news of the rohirrim,’ he said. ‘rohan will not come now. or if they come, it will not avail us. the new host that we had tidings of has come first, from over the river by way of andros, it is said. they are strong: battalions of orcs of the eye, and countless companies of men of a new sort that we have not met before. not tall, but broad and grim, bearded like dwarves, wielding great axes

heir weapons fall from nerveless hands while into their minds a blackness came, and they thought no more of war, but only of hiding and of crawling, and of death.
during all this black day faramir lay upon his bed in the chamber of the white tower, wandering in a desperate fever; dying someone said, and soon ‘dying’ all men were saying upon the walls and in the streets. and by him his father sat, and said nothing, but watched, and gave no longer any heed to the defence.
no hours so dark had pippin known, not even in the clutches of the uruk-hai. it was his duty to wait upon the lord, and wait he did, forgotten it seemed, standing by the door of the unlit chamber, mastering his own fears as best he could. and as he watched, it seemed to him that denethor grew old before his eyes, as if something had snapped in his proud will, and his stern mind was overthrown. grief maybe had wrought it, and remorse. he saw tears on that once tearless face, more unbearable than wrath.

d, still bunched and herded, within the range of bowmen on the wall. but indeed there were too few now left there to do them great damage, though the light of the fires showed up many a mark for archers of such skill as gondor once had boasted. then perceiving that the valour of the city was already beaten down, the hidden captain put forth his strength. slowly the great siege-towers built in osgiliath rolled forward through the dark.
messengers came again to the chamber in the white tower, and pippin let them enter, for they were urgent. denethor turned his head slowly from faramir’s face, and looked at them silently.
‘the first circle of the city is burning, lord,’ they said. ‘what are your commands? you are still the lord and steward. not all will follow mithrandir. men are flying from the walls and leaving them unmanned.’
‘why? why do the fools fly?’ said denethor. ‘better to burn sooner than late, for burn we must. go back to your bonfire! and i? i will go now to my pyre

. to my pyre! no tomb for denethor and faramir. no tomb! no long slow sleep of death embalmed. we will burn like heathen kings before ever a ship sailed hither from the west. the west has failed. go back and burn!’
the messengers without bow or answer turned and fled.
now denethor stood up and released the fevered hand of faramir that he had held. ‘he is burning, already burning,’ he said sadly. ‘the house of his spirit crumbles.’ then stepping softly towards pippin he looked down at him.
‘farewell!’ he said. ‘farewell, peregrin son of paladin! your service has been short, and now it is drawing to an end. i release you from the little that remains. go now, and die in what way seems best to you. and with whom you will, even that friend whose folly brought you to this death. send for my servants and then go. farewell!’
‘i will not say farewell, my lord,’ said pippin kneeling. and then suddenly hobbit-like once more, he stood up and looked the old

ake your leave, sir,’ he said; ‘for i want to see gandalf very much indeed. but he is no fool; and i will not think of dying until he despairs of life. but from my word and your service i do not wish to be released while you live. and if they come at last to the citadel, i hope to be here and stand beside you and earn perhaps the arms that you have given me.’
‘do as you will, master halfling,’ said denethor. ‘but my life is broken. send for my servants!’ he turned back to faramir.
pippin left him and called for the servants, and they came: six men of the household, strong and fair; yet they trembled at the summons. but in a quiet voice denethor bade them lay warm coverlets on faramir’s bed and take it up. and they did so, and lifting up the bed they bore it from the chamber. slowly they paced to trouble the fevered man as little as might be, and denethor, now bending on a staff, followed them; and last came pippin.

lord’s command he unlocked the door, and silently it swung back; and they passed through, taking the lantern from his hand. it was dark on the climbing road between ancient walls and many-pillared balusters looming in the swaying lantern-beam. their slow feet echoed as they walked down, down, until at last they came to the silent street, rath dínen, between pale domes and empty halls and images of men long dead; and they entered into the house of the stewards and set down their burden.
there pippin, staring uneasily about him, saw that he was in a wide vaulted chamber, draped as it were with the great shadows that the little lantern threw upon its shrouded walls. and dimly to be seen were many rows of tables, carved of marble; and upon each table lay a sleeping form, hands folded, head pillowed upon stone. but one table near at hand stood broad and bare. upon it at a sign from denethor they laid faramir and his father side by side, and covered them with one covering, and stood then with b

‘here we will wait,’ he said. ‘but send not for the embalmers. bring us wood quick to burn, and lay it all about us, and beneath; and pour oil upon it. and when i bid you thrust in a torch. do this and speak no more to me. farewell!’
‘by your leave, lord!’ said pippin and turned and fled in terror from the deathly house. ‘poor faramir!’ he thought. ‘i must find gandalf. poor faramir! quite likely he needs medicine more than tears. oh, where can i find gandalf? in the thick of things, i suppose; and he will have no time to spare for dying men or madmen.’
at the door he turned to one of the servants who had remained on guard there. ‘your master is not himself,’ he said. ‘go slow! bring no fire to this place while faramir lives! do nothing until g

‘who is the master of minas tirith?’ the man answered. ‘the lord denethor or the grey wanderer?’
‘the grey wanderer or no one, it would seem,’ said pippin, and he sped back and up the winding way as swiftly as his feet would carry him, past the astonished porter, out through the door, and on, till he came near the gate of the citadel. the sentinel hailed him as he went by, and he recognized the voice of beregond.
‘whither do you run, master peregrin?’ he cried.
‘to find mithrandir,’ pippin answered.
‘the lord’s errands are urgent and should not be hindered by me,’ said beregond; ‘but tell me quickly, if you may: what goes forward?

 whither has my lord gone? i have just come on duty, but i heard that he passed towards the closed door, and men were bearing faramir before him.’
‘yes,’ said pippin, ‘to the silent street.’
beregond bowed his head to hide his tears. ‘they said that he was dying,’ he sighed, ‘and now he is dead.’
‘no,’ said pippin, ‘not yet. and even now his death might be prevented, i think. but the lord of the city, beregond, has fallen before his city is taken. he is fey and dangerous.’ quickly he told of denethor’s strange words and deeds. ‘i must find gandalf at once.’
‘then you must go down to the battle.’
‘i know. the lord has given me leave. but, beregond, if you can, do something to stop any dreadful thing happening.’
‘the lord does not permit those who wear the black and silver to leave thei

‘well, you must choose between orders and the life of faramir,’ said pippin. ‘and as for orders, i think you have a madman to deal with, not a lord. i must run. i will return if i can.’
he ran on, down, down towards the outer city. men flying back from the burning passed him, and some seeing his livery turned and shouted, but he paid no heed. at last he was through the second gate, beyond which great fires leaped up between the walls. yet it seemed strangely silent. no noise or shouts of battle or din of arms could be heard. then suddenly there was a dreadful cry a

nd a great shock, and a deep echoing boom. forcing himself on against a gust of fear and horror that shook him almost to his knees. pippin turned a corner opening on the wide place behind the city gate. he stopped dead. he had found gandalf; but he shrank back, cowering into a shadow.
ever since the middle night the great assault had gone on. the drums rolled. to the north and to the south company upon company of the enemy pressed to the walls. there came great beasts, like moving houses in the red and fitful light, the mûmakil of the harad dragging through the lanes amid the fires huge towers and engines. yet their captain cared

ed the townlands. scouts had been sent ahead. some had not returned. others hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them. a host of the enemy was encamped upon it, three miles west of amon dîn, and some strength of men was already thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues away. orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside. the king and éomer held council in the watches of the night.
merry wanted somebody to talk to, and he thought of pippin. but that only increased his restlessness. poor pippin, shut up in the great city of stone, lonely and afraid. merry wished he was a tall rider like éomer and could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue. he sat up, listening to the drums that were beating again, now nearer at hand. presently he heard voices speaking low, and he saw dim half-shrouded lanterns passing through the trees. men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark.

‘then we must set out as soon as may be,’ said éomer. ‘even so we cannot hope to come to gondor’s aid today.’
merry waited to hear no more, but slipped away to get ready for the summons to the march. this was the last stage before the battle. it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it. but he thought of pippin and the flames in minas tirith and thrust down his own dread.
all went well that day, and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them. the wild men had put out a screen of wary hunters, so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. the light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered city, and the riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses. each company was guided by a wild woodman; but old ghân walked beside

chapter 7

the pyre of denethor

when the dark shadow at the gate withdrew gandalf still sat motionless. but pippin rose to his feet, as if a great weight had been lifted from him; and he stood listening to the horns, and it seemed to him that they would break his heart with joy. and never in after years could he hear a horn blown in the distance without tears starting in his eyes. but now suddenly his errand returned to his memory, and he ran forward. at that moment gandalf stirred and spoke to shadowfax, and was about to ride through the gate.
‘gandalf, gandalf! ‘ cried pippin, and shadowfax halted.

what are you doing here?’ said gandalf. ‘is it not a law in the city that those who wear the black and silver must stay in the citadel, unless their lord gives them leave?’
‘he has,’ said pippin. ‘he sent me away. but i am frightened. something terrible may happen up there. the lord is out of his mind, i think. i am afraid he will kill himself, and kill faramir too. can’t you do something?’
gandalf looked through the gaping gate, and already on the fields he heard the gathering sound of battle. he clenched his hand. ‘i must go ‘ he said. ‘the black rider is abroad, and he will yet bring ruin on us. i have no time.’
‘but faramir!’ cried pippin. ‘he is not dead, and t

hey will burn him alive, if someone does not stop them.’
‘burn him alive?’ said gandalf. ‘what is this tale? be quick!’
‘denethor has gone to the tombs,’ said pippin, ‘and he has taken faramir, and he says we are all to burn, and he will not wait, and they are to make a pyre and burn him on it, and faramir as well. and he has sent men to fetch wood and oil. and i have told beregond, but i’m afraid he won’t dare to leave his post: he is on guard. and what can he do anyway?’ so pippin poured out his tale, reaching up and touching gandalf’s knee with trembling hands. ‘can’t you save faramir?’
‘maybe i can,’ said gandalf; ‘but if i do, the

n others will die, i fear. well, i must come, since no other help can reach him. but evil and sorrow will come of this. even in the heart of our stronghold the enemy has power to strike us: for his will it is that is at work.’
then having made up his mind he acted swiftly; and catching up pippin and setting him before him, he turned shadowfax with a word. up the climbing streets of minas tirith they clattered, while the noise of war rose behind them. everywhere men were rising from their despair and dread, seizing their weapons, crying one to another: ‘rohan has come!’ captains were shouting, companies were mustering; many already were marching down to the gate.
they met the prince imrahil, and he called to them: ‘whither now, mithrandir? the rohirrim are fighting on the fields o

they passed on; and as they climbed and drew near to the citadel they felt the wind blowing in their faces, and they caught the glimmer of morning far away, a light growing in the southern sky. but it brought little hope to them, not knowing what evil lay before them, fearing to come too late.
‘darkness is passing,’ said gandalf, ‘but it still lies heavy on this city.’
at the gate of the citadel they found no guard. ‘then beregond has gone,’ said pippin more hopefully. they turned away and hastened along the road to the closed door. it stood wide open, and the porter lay before it. he was slain and his key had been taken.
‘work of the enemy!’ said gandalf. ‘such deeds he loves: friend at war with friend; loyalty divided in confusion of hearts.’ now he dismounted and bade shadowfax return to his stable. ‘for, my friend,’ he said, ‘you and i should have ridden to the fields long ago, but other matters delay me. yet come swiftly if

for there were the servants of denethor with swords and torches in their hands; but alone in the porch upon the topmost step stood beregond, clad in the black and silver of the guard; and he held the door against them. two of them had already fallen to his sword, staining the hallows with their blood; and the others cursed him, calling him outlaw and traitor to his master.
even as gandalf and pippin ran forward, they heard from within the house of the dead the voice of denethor crying: ‘haste, haste! do as i have bidden! slay me this renegade! or must i do so myself?’ thereupon the door which beregond held shut with his left hand was wrenched open, and there behind him stood the lord of the city, tall and fell; a light like flame was in his eyes, and he held a drawn sword.
but gandalf sprang up the steps, and the men fell back from him and covered their eyes; for his coming was like th

‘he lies within,’ said denethor, ‘burning, already burning. they have set a fire in his flesh. but soon all shall be burned. the west has failed. it shall all go up in a great fire, and all shall be ended. ash! ash and smoke blown away on the wind!’
then gandalf seeing the madness that was on him feared that he had already done some evil deed, and he thrust forward, with beregond and pippin behind him, while denethor gave back until he stood beside the table within. but there they found faramir, still dreaming in his fever, lying upon the table. wood was piled under it, and high all about it, and all was drenched with oil, even the garments of faramir and the coverlets; but as yet no fire had been set to the fuel. then gandalf revealed the strength that lay hid in him; even as the light of his power was hidden under his grey mantle. he leaped up on to the faggots, and raising the

‘bear away from this unhappy place your comrades who have fallen. and we will bear faramir, steward of gondor, to a place where he can sleep in peace, or die if that be his doom.’
then gandalf and beregond taking up the bier bore it away towards the houses of healing, while behind them walked pippin with downcast head. but the servants of the lord stood gazing as stricken men at the house of the dead; and even as gandalf came to the end of rath dínen there was a great noise. looking back they saw the dome of the house crack and smokes issue forth; and then with a rush and rumble of stone it fell in a flurry of fire; but still unabated the flames danced and flickered among the ruins. then in terror the servants fled and followed gandalf.
at length they came back to the steward’s door, an

 they heard a great cry that went up from the field before the gate and rising shrill and piercing into the sky passed, and died away on the wind. so terrible was the cry that for a moment all stood still, and yet when it had passed, suddenly their hearts were lifted up in such a hope as they had not known since the darkness came out of the east; and it seemed to them that the light grew clear and the sun broke through the clouds.
but gandalf’s face was grave and sad, and bidding beregond and pippin to take faramir into the houses of healing, he went up on to the walls nearby; and there like a figure carven in white he stood in the new sun and looked out. and he beheld with the sight that was given to him all that had befallen; and when éomer rode out from the forefront of his battle and stood beside those who lay upon the field, he sighed, and he cast his cloak about him again, and went from the walls. and beregond and pippin found him standing in thought before the door of the houses wh

his realm grew he looked in the stone and was deceived: far too often, i guess, since boromir departed. he was too great to be subdued to the will of the dark power, he saw nonetheless only those things which that power permitted him to see. the knowledge which he obtained was, doubtless, often of service to him; yet the vision of the great might of mordor that was shown to him fed the despair of his heart until it overthrew his mind.’
‘now i understand what seemed so strange to me!’ said pippin shuddering at his memories as he spoke. ‘the lord went away from the room where faramir lay; and it was only when he returned that i first thought he was changed, old and broken.’
‘it was in the very hour that faramir was brought to the tower that many of us saw a strange light in the topmost chamber,’ said beregond. ‘but we have seen that light before, and it has long been rumoured in the city, that the lord would at times wrestle in thought with his enemy.’
‘alas! then i have gu

‘now i must go down to meet those who come. i have seen a sight upon the field that is very grievous to my heart, and greater sorrow may yet come to pass. come with me, pippin! but you, beregond, should return to the citadel and tell the chief of the guard there what has befallen. it will be his duty, i fear, to withdraw you from the guard; but say to him that, if i may give him counsel, you should be sent to the houses of healing, to be the guard and servant of your captain, and to be at his side when he awakes - if that shall ever be again. for by you he was saved from the fire. go now! i shall return soon.’
with that he turned away and went with pippin down towa

he ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize.
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: ‘this is a tunnel leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.’ but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice.
‘well, merry! thank goodness i have found you!’
he looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. there was pippin! they were face to face in a narrow lane, and but for themselves it was empty. he rubbed his eyes.
‘where is the king?’ he said. ‘and éowyn?’ then he stumbled and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again.
‘they have gone up into the citadel,’ said pippin. ‘i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning. when we found that you were not with them, gandalf sent me to look for you. poor old merry! how glad i am to see you again! but you are worn ou

‘no,’ said merry. ‘well, no, i don’t think so. but i can’t use my right arm, pippin, not since i stabbed him. and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood.’
pippin’s face was anxious. ‘well, you had better come with me as quick as you can,’ he said. ‘i wish i could carry you. you aren’t fit to walk any further. they shouldn’t have let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. so many dreadful things have happened in the city, merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.’
‘it’s not always a misfortune being overlooked,’ said merry. ‘i was overlooked just now by - no, no, i can’t speak of it. help me,

‘are you going to bury me?’ said merry.
‘no, indeed!’ said pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart was wrung with fear and pity. ‘no, we are going to the houses of healing.’
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel. step by step they went, while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep.
‘i’ll never get him there,’ thought pippin. ‘is there no one to help me? i can’t leave him here.’ just then to his surprise a boy c

‘hullo, bergil!’ he called. ‘where are you going? glad to see you again, and still alive!’
‘i am running errands for the healers,’ said bergil. ‘i cannot stay.’
‘don’t!’ said pippin. ‘but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. i don’t think he can walk so far. if mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.’ bergil ran on.
‘i’d better wait here,’ thought pippin. so he let merry sink gently down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside him, laying merry’s head in his lap. he felt his body and limbs gently, and took his friend’s hands in his own. the right hand felt ic

‘walk no more in the shadows, but awake!’ said aragorn. ‘you are weary. rest a while, and take food, and be ready when i return.’
‘i will, lord,’ said faramir. ‘for who would lie idle when the king has returned?’
‘farewell then for a while!’ said aragorn. ‘i must go to others who need me.’ and he left the chamber with gandalf and imrahil; but beregond and his son remained behind, unable to contain their joy. as he followed gandalf and shut the door pippin heard ioreth exclaim:
‘king! did you hear that? what did i say? the hands of a healer, i said.’ and soon the word had gone out from the house that the king was indeed come among them, and after war he brought healing; and the news ran through the city.
but aragorn came to éowyn, and he said: ‘here there is a grievous hurt and a heavy blow. the arm that was broken has been tended with due skill, and it will mend in time, if she has the strength to live: it is the shield-arm that is maimed

‘he lies nearby in this house, and i will go to him,’ said gandalf. ‘éomer shall stay here for a while. but do not speak yet of war or woe, until you are made whole again. great gladness it is to see you wake again to health and hope, so valiant a lady!’
‘to health?’ said éowyn. ‘it may be so. at least while there is an empty saddle of some fallen rider that i can fill, and there are deeds to do. but to hope? i do not know.’
gandalf and pippin came to merry’s room, and there they found aragorn standing by the bed. ‘poor old merry!’ cried pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized pippin that merry would die.
‘do not be afraid,’ said aragorn. ‘i came in time, and i have called him back. he is weary now, and grieved, and he has taken a hurt like the lady éowyn, daring to smite

gay a spirit is in him. his grief he will not forget; but it will not darken his heart, it will teach him wisdom.’
then aragorn laid his hand on merry’s head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly merry awoke, and he said:
‘i am hungry. what is the time?’
‘past supper-time now,’ said pippin; ‘though i daresay i could bring you something, if they will let me.’
‘they will indeed,’ said gandalf. ‘and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire, if it can be found in minas tirith, where his name is in honour.’
‘good!’ said merry. ‘then i would like supper first, and after that a pipe.’ at that his face clouded. ‘no, not a pipe. i don’t think i’ll smoke again.’
‘why not?’ said pippin.
‘well,’ answered merry slowly. ‘he is dead. it has brought

‘smoke then, and think of him!’ said aragorn. ‘for he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair morning. though your service to him was brief, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.’
merry smiled. ‘well then,’ he said, ‘if strider will provide what is needed, i will smoke and think. i had some of saruman’s best in my pack, but what became of

‘i know that well, or i would not deal with you in the same way ‘ said aragorn. ‘may the shire live for ever unwithered!’ and kissing merry he went out, and gandalf went with him.
pippin remained behind. ‘was there ever any one like him?’ he said. ‘except gandalf, of course. i think they must be related. my dear ass, your pack is lying by your bed, and you had it on your back when i met you. he saw it all the time, of course. and anyway i have some stuff of my own. come on now! longbottom leaf it is. fill up while i run and see about some food. and then let’s be easy for a bit. dear me! we tooks and brandybucks, we can’t live long on the heights.’

chapter 9

the last debate

the morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward. legolas and gimli were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the city; for they were eager to see merry and pippin.
‘it is good to learn that they are still alive,’ said gimli; ‘for they cost us great pains in our march over rohan, and i would not have such pains all wasted.’
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning; but gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him.
‘there is so

n middle-earth, and great works to do. but if all the fair folk take to the havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.’
‘dull and dreary indeed!’ said merry: ‘you must not go to the havens, legolas. there will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise dwarves like gimli, who need you. at least i hope so. though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come. how i wish it was all over, and well over!’
‘don’t be so gloomy!’ cried pippin. ‘the sun is shining, and here we are together for a day or two at least. i want to hear more about you all. come, gimli! you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a dozen times already this morning. but you haven’t told me anything about it.’
‘the sun may shine here,’ said gimli, ‘but there are memories of that road that i do not wish to recall out of the darkness. had i known what was before me, i think that not for any friendship would i have taken th

e paths of the dead.’
‘the paths of the dead?’ said pippin. ‘i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean. won’t you tell us some more?’
‘not willingly,’ said gimli. ‘for upon that road i was put to shame: gimli glóin’s son, who had deemed himself more tough than men, and hardier under earth than any elf. but neither did i prove; and i was held to the road only by the will of aragorn.’
‘and by the love of him also,’ said legolas. ‘for all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the co

ld maiden of the rohirrim. it was at early morn of the day ere you came there, merry, that we left dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the lady éowyn, who lies now hurt in the house below. there was grief at that parting, and i was grieved to behold it.’
‘alas! i had heart only for myself,’ said gimli. ‘nay! i will not speak of that journey.’
he fell silent; but pippin and merry were so eager for news that at last legolas said: ‘i will tell you enough for your peace; for i felt not the horror, and i feared not the shadows of men, powerless and frail as i deemed them.’
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to pelargir on anduin. ‘four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from the black stone,’ he said. ‘and lo! in the darkness of mordor

in truth all now are in like danger. though it may be our part to find bitter end before the gate of mordor, if we do so, then you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever the black tide overtakes you. farewell!’
and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army. bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to march leading a company of the men of the city: he could not rejoin the guard until his case was judged. in that same company pippin was also to go, as a soldier of gondor. merry could see him not far off, a small but upright figure among the tall men of minas tirith.
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. troop by troop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. and long after they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway, merry stood there. the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart

s, and he came forward bearing a bundle swathed in black cloths.
the messenger put these aside, and there to the wonder and dismay of all the captains he held up first the short sword that sam had carried, and next a grey cloak with an elven-brooch, and last the coat of mithril-mail that frodo had worn wrapped in his tattered garments. a blackness came before their eyes, and it seemed to them in a moment of silence that the world stood still, but their hearts were dead and their last hope gone. pippin who stood behind prince imrahil sprang forward with a cry of grief.
‘silence!’ said gandalf sternly, thrusting him back; but the messenger laughed aloud.
‘so you have yet another of these imps with you!’ he cried. ‘what use you find in them i cannot guess; but to send them as spies into mordor is beyond even your accustomed folly. still, i thank him, for it is plain that this brat at least has seen these tokens before, and it would be vain for you to deny them now.’
‘i do not wish

the wind blew, and the trumpets sang, and arrows whined; but the sun now climbing towards the south was veiled in the reeks of mordor, and through a threatening haze it gleamed, remote, a sullen red, as if it were the ending of the day, or the end maybe of all the world of light. and out of the gathering mirk the nazgûl came with. their cold voices crying words of death; and then all hope was quenched.
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of the tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil’s men. for it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin.
‘i wish merry was here,’ he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. ‘well, well, no

then pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of westernesse pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his black blood came gushing out. he toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock, burying those beneath him. blackne

ss and stench and crushing pain came upon pippin, and his mind fell away into a great darkness.
‘so it ends as i guessed it would,’ his thought said, even as it fluttered away; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost gay it seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear. and then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed to be crying in some forgotten world far above:
‘the eagles are coming! the eagles are coming!’
for one moment more pippin’s thought hovered. ‘bilbo!

k of us at all,’ he said, ‘and what is happening to them all away there.’ he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to shelob’s tunnel, not west. out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire-reckoning. and even now aragorn was leading the black fleet from pelargir, and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain valley, while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor. yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam. they were not forgotten. but they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise hamfast’s son; he was utterly alone.
he came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the catch or bolt that held it, he scrambled over as before and dropped softly to the ground. then he made his wa

but when, after the standing silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the guards of minas tirith, and the other in white and green. but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men. then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:
‘why, look mr. frodo! look here! well, if it isn’t pippin. mr. peregrin took i should say, and mr. merry! how they have grown! bless me! but i can see there’s more tales to tell than ours.’
‘there are indeed,’ said pippin turning towards him. ‘and we’ll begin telling them, as soon as this feast is ended. in the meantime you can try gandalf. he’s not so close as he used to be, though he laughs now more than he talks. for the present merry and i are busy. we are knights of the city and of the mark, as i hope you observe.’

d day ended; and when the sun was gone and the round moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf, and after a while legolas and gimli joined them. there frodo and sam learned much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.
orcs, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping riders. and glittering caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles, and tall ships sailing, all these passed before sam’s mind until he felt bewildered.

 but amidst all these wonders he returned always to his astonishment at the size of merry and pippin; and he made them stand back to back with frodo and himself. he scratched his head. ‘can’t understand it at your age!’ he said. ‘but there it is: you’re three inches taller than you ought to he, or i’m a dwarf.’
‘that you certainly are not,’ said gimli. ‘but what did i say? mortals cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer.’
‘ent-draughts?’ said sam. ‘there you go about ents again; but what they are beats me. why, it wil

‘weeks indeed,’ said pippin. ‘and then frodo will have to be locked up in a tower in minas tirith and write it all down. otherwise he will forget half of it, and poor old bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed.’
at length gandalf rose. ‘the hands of the king are hands of healing, dear friends,’ he said. ‘but you went to the very brink of death ere he recalled you, putting forth all his power, and sent you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep. and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly, still it is now t

‘as for bilbo,’ said gandalf, ‘he is waiting for the same day, and he knows what keeps you. and as for the passing of the days, it is now only may and high summer is not yet in; and though all things may seem changed, as if an age of the world had gone by, yet to the trees and the grass it is less than a year since you set out.’
‘pippin,’ said frodo, ‘didn’t you say that gandalf was less close than of old? he was weary of his labours then, i think. now he is recovering.’
and gandalf said: ‘many folk like to know beforehand what is to be set on the table; but those who have laboured to prepare the feast like to keep their secret; for wonder makes the words of praise louder. and aragorn himself waits for a sign.’
there came a day when gandalf could not be found, and the companions wondered what was going forward. but

the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath dínen, and they bore away king théoden upon a golden bier, and passed through the city in silence. then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and merry being théoden’s esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king.
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with théoden thengel’s son to the land of his home.
without haste and at peace they passed into anórien, and they came to the grey wood under amon din; and

and celeborn said: ‘i do not know, eldest.’ but galadriel said: ‘not in middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. then in the willow-meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring. farewell!’
last of all merry and pippin said good-bye to the old ent, and he grew gayer as he looked at them. ‘well, my merry folk,’ he said, ‘will you drink another draught with me before you go?’
‘indeed we will,’ they said, and he took them aside into the shade of one of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set. and treebeard filled three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl. ‘take care take care!’ he said. ‘for you have already gro

‘well, good-bye!’ he said. ‘and don’t forget that if you hear any news of the entwives in your land, you will send word to me.’ then he waved his great hands to all the company and went off into the trees.
the travellers now rode with more speed, and they made their way towards the gap of rohan; and aragorn took leave of them at last close to that very place where pippin had looked into the stone of orthanc. the hobbits were grieved at this parting; for aragorn had never failed them and he had been their guide through many perils.
‘i wish we could have a stone that we could see all our friends in,’ said pippin, ‘and that we could speak to them from far away!’
‘only one now remains that you could use,’ answered aragorn for you would not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you. but the palantír of orthanc the king will keep, to see

‘thank you!’ said merry. ‘in that case i will have my pouch back, which is not yours and has journeyed far with me. wrap the weed in a rag of your own.’
‘one thief deserves another,’ said saruman, and turned his back on merry, and kicked wormtongue, and went away towards the wood.
‘well, i like that!’ said pippin. ‘thief indeed! what of our claim for waylaying, wounding, and orc-dragging us through rohan?’
‘ah!’ said sam. ‘and bought he said. how, i wonder? and i didn’t like the sound of what he said about the southfarthing. it’s time we got back.’
‘i’m sure it is,’ said frodo. ‘but we can’t go any quicker, if we are to see bilbo. i am going to rivendell first, whatever happens.’
‘yes, i think you had better do that,’ said gandalf. ‘but alas for saruman! i fear nothing

 frodo his mithril-coat and sting, forgetting that he had already done so; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: translations from the elvish, by b.b.
to sam he gave a little bag of gold. ‘almost the last drop of the smaug vintage,’ he said. ‘may come in useful, if you think of getting married, sam.’ sam blushed.
‘i have nothing much to give to you young fellows,’ he said to merry and pippin, ‘except good advice.’ and when he had given them a fair sample of this, he added a last item in shire-fashion: ‘don’t let your heads get too big for your hats! but if you don’t finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.’
‘but if you want to beat the old took,’ said pippin, ‘i don’t see why we shouldn’t try and beat the bullroarer.’
bilbo laughed, and he produced out of a pocket two beautiful pipes with pearl mouth-pieces and bound with fin

r scowled. ‘gone,’ he said. ‘but you’d best ask barliman. good evening!’
‘good evening to you!’ they said, and passed through; and then they noticed that behind the hedge at the road-side a long low hut had been built, and a number of men had come out and were staring at them over the fence. when they came to bill ferny’s house they saw that the hedge there was tattered and unkempt, and the windows were all boarded up.
‘do you think you killed him with that apple, sam?’ said pippin.
‘i’m not so hopeful, mr. pippin,’ said sam. ‘but i’d like to know what became of that poor pony. he’s been on my mind many a time and the wolves howling and all.’
at last they came to the prancing pony, and that at least looked outwardly unchanged; and there were lights behind the red curtains in the lower windows. they rang the bell, and nob came to the door, and opened it a crack and peeped through; and when he saw them standing under the lamp he gave a cry of surprise.

m out: before the year’s end, that was; and the fight was early in the new year, after the heavy snow we had.
‘and now they’re gone for robbers and live outside, hiding in the woods beyond archet, and out in the wilds north-away. it’s like a bit of the bad old times tales tell of, i say. it isn’t safe on the road and nobody goes far, and folk lock up early. we have to keep watchers all round the fence and put a lot of men on the gates at nights.’
‘well, no one troubled us,’ said pippin, ‘and we came along slowly, and kept no watch. we thought we’d left all trouble behind us.’
‘ah, that you haven’t, master, more’s the pity,’ said butterbur. ‘but it’s no wonder they left you alone. they wouldn’t go for armed folk, with swords and helmets and shields and all. make them think twice, that would. and i must say it put me aback a bit when i saw you.’
then the hobbits suddenly realized that people had looked at them with amazement not out of surprise at their re

 and as before he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content.
‘i wonder what old barliman was hinting at,’ said frodo.
‘i can guess some of it,’ said sam gloomily. ‘what i saw in the mirror: trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the row. i ought to have hurried back quicker.’
‘and something’s wrong with the southfarthing evidently,’ said merry. ‘there’s a general shortage of pipe-weed.’
‘whatever it is,’ said pippin, ‘lotho will be at the bottom of it: you can be sure of that.’
‘deep in, but not at the bottom,’ said gandalf. ‘you have forgotten saruman. he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did.’
‘well, we’ve got you with us,’ said merry, ‘so things will soon be cleared up.’
‘i am with you at present,’ said gandalf, ‘but soon i shall not be. i am not coming to the shire. you must settle its affairs yourselves; that is what you have been trained for. do you not

 way,’ said one. ‘he’ll get to hear of it. and if you make so much noise, you’ll wake the chief’s big man.’
‘we shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him,’ said merry. ‘if you mean that your precious chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild, then we’ve not come back too soon.’ he sprang from his pony, and seeing the notice in the light of the lanterns, he tore it down and threw it over the gate. the hobbits backed away and made no move to open it. ‘come on, pippin!’ said merry. ‘two is enough.’
merry and pippin climbed the gate, and the hobbits fled. another horn sounded. out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway.
‘what’s all this,’ he snarled as he came forward. ‘gate-breaking? you clear out, or i’ll break your filthy little necks!’ then he stopped, for he had caught the gleam of swords.
‘bill ferny,’ said merry, ‘if you don’t open that gate in ten seconds, you’ll regret

‘what’s the matter with the place?’ said merry. ‘has it been a bad year, or what? i thought it had been a fine summer and harvest.’
‘well no, the year’s been good enough,’ said hob. ‘we grows a lot of food, but we don’t rightly know what becomes of it. it’s all these “gatherers” and “sharers”, i reckon, going round counting and measuring and taking off to storage. they do more gathering than sharing, and we never see most of the stuff again.’
‘oh come!’ said pippin yawning. ‘this is all too tiresome for me tonight. we’ve got food in our bags. just give us a room to lie down in. it’ll be better than many places i have seen.’
the hobbits at the gate still seemed ill at ease, evidently some rule or other was being broken; but there was no gainsaying four such masterful travellers, all armed, and two of them uncommonly large and strong-looking. frodo ordered the gates to be locked again. there was some sense at any rate in keeping a guard, while ruffi

ans were still about. then the four companions went into the hobbit guard-house and made themselves as comfortable as they could. it was a bare and ugly place, with a mean little grate that would not allow a good fire. in the upper rooms were little rows of hard beds, and on every wall there was a notice and a list of rules. pippin tore them down. there was no beer and very little food, but with what the travellers brought and shared out they all made a fair meal; and pippin broke rule 4 by putting most of next day’s allowance of wood on the fire.
‘well now, what about a smoke, while you tell us what has been happening in the shire?’ he said.
‘there isn’t no pipe-weed now,’ said hob; ‘at least only for the chief’s men. all the stocks seem to have gone. we do hear that waggon-loads of it went away down the old road out of the southfarthing, over sarn ford way. that would be the end o’ last year, after you left. but it had been going away quietly be

arted earlier, only the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff-leader. the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder, but the rain was gone.
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few folk that came out to stare at the ‘get-up’ of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort to the ‘prisoners’; but merry made them march in front, while frodo and his friends rode behind. merry, pippin, and sam sat at their ease laughing and talking and singing, while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important. frodo, however, was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful.
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. ‘hullo, hullo!’ he jeered. ‘now who’s arrested who?’
two of the shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him. ‘leader!’ said merry. ‘order your fellows back to their places at once, if you don’t want me

were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace.
‘well, come along in your own time!’ said merry. ‘we are going on.’
‘good-bye, cock-robin!’ said sam. ‘i’ll wait for you outside the green dragon, if you haven’t forgotten where that is. don’t dawdle on the way!’
‘you’re breaking arrest, that’s what you’re doing,’ said the leader ruefully, ‘and i can’t be answerable.’
‘we shall break a good many things yet, and not ask you to answer ‘ said pippin. ‘good luck to you!’
the travellers trotted on, and as the sun began to sink towards the white downs far away on the western horizon they came to bywater by its wide pool; and there they had their first really painful shock. this was frodo and sam’s own country, and they found out now that they cared about it more than any other place in the world. many of the houses that they had known were missing. some seemed to have been burned down. the pleasant row of old hobbit-holes in the bank on

the man stared at him and smiled. ‘a beggar in the wilderness!’ he mocked. ‘oh, is he indeed? swagger it, swagger it, my little cock-a-whoop. but that won’t stop us living in this fat little country where you have lazed long enough. and’ - he snapped his fingers in frodo’s face - ‘king’s messengers! that for them! when i see one, i’ll take notice, perhaps.’
this was too much for pippin. his thoughts went back to the field of cormallen, and here was a squint-eyed rascal calling the ring-bearer ‘little cock-a-whoop’. he cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward.
‘i am a messenger of the king,’ he said. ‘you are speaking to the king’s friend, and one of the most renowned in all the lands of the west. you are a ruffian and a fool. down on your knees in the road and ask pardon, or i will set this tr

oll’s bane in you!’
the sword glinted in the westering sun. merry and sam drew their swords also and rode up to support pippin; but frodo did not move. the ruffians gave back. scaring breeland peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had been their work. fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise. and there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before. it chilled them with fear.
‘go!’ said merry. ‘if you trouble this village again, you will regret it.’ the three hobbits came on, and then the ruffians turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road;

 but they blew their horns as they ran.
‘well, we’ve come back none too soon,’ said merry.
‘not a day too soon. perhaps too late, at any rate to save lotho,’ said frodo. ‘miserable fool, but i am sorry for him.’
‘save lotho? whatever do you mean?’ said pippin. ‘destroy him i should say.’
‘i don’t think you quite understand things, pippin,’ said frodo. ‘lotho never meant things to come to this pass. he has been a wicked fool, but he’s caught now. the ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing and bullying, and running or ruining things as they like, in his name. and not in his name even for much longer. he’s a prisoner in bag end now, i expect, and very frightened. we ought to try and rescue him.’
‘well i am staggered!’ said pippin. ‘of all the ends to our journey that is the very last i should have thought of: to h

‘but if there are many of these ruffians,’ said merry, ‘it will certainly mean fighting. you won’t rescue lotho, or the shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear frodo.’
‘no,’ said pippin. ‘it won’t be so easy scaring them a second time. they were taken by surprise. you heard that horn-blowing? evidently there are other ruffians near at hand. they’ll be much bolder when there’s more of them together. we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. after all we’re only four, even if we are armed.’
‘i’ve an idea,’ said sam. ‘let’s go to old tom cotton’s down south lane! he always was a stout fellow. and he has a lot of lads that were all friends

of mine.’
‘no!’ said merry. ‘it’s no good “getting under cover”. that is just what people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. they will simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn us in. no, we have got to do something at once.’
‘do what?’ said pippin.
‘raise the shire!’ said merry. ‘now! wake all our people! they hate all this, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few fools that want to be important, but don’t at all understand what is really going on. but shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don’t know what to do. they just want a match, though, and they’ll go up in fire. the chief’s men must know that. they’ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. we’ve only got a very short ti

said cotton. ‘they moves about and comes and goes. there’s sometimes fifty of them in their sheds up hobbiton way; but they go out from there roving round, thieving or “gathering” as they call it. still there’s seldom less than a score round the boss, as they names him. he’s at bag end, or was; but he don’t go outside the rounds now. no one s seen him at all, in fact, for a week or two; but the men don’t let no one go near.’
‘hobbiton’s not their only place, is it?’ said pippin.
‘no, more’s the pity,’ said cotton. ‘there’s a good few down south in longbottom and by sarn ford, i hear; and some more lurking in the woody end; and they’ve sheds at waymeet. and then there’s the lockholes, as they call ‘em: the old storage-tunnels at michel delving that they’ve made into prisons for those as stand up to them. still i reckon there’s not above three hundred of them in the shire all told, and maybe less. we can master them, if we stick together.’

 shire and no upstart. and when lotho sent his men they got no change out of him. tooks are lucky, they’ve got those deep holes in the green hills, the great smials and all, and the ruffians can’t come at ‘em; and they won’t let the ruffians come on their land. if they do, tooks hunt ‘em. tooks shot three for prowling and robbing. after that the ruffians turned nastier. and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland. no one gets in nor out of it now.’
‘good for the tooks!’ cried pippin. ‘but someone is going to get in again, now. i am off to the smials. anyone coming with me to tuckborough?’
pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. ‘see you soon!’ he cried. ‘it’s only fourteen miles or so over the fields. i’ll bring you back an army of tooks in the morning.’ merry blew a horn-call after them as they rode off into the gathering night. the people cheered.
‘all the same,’ said frodo to all those who stood near, ‘i wish for no killing; not even of t

ruffians have joined up with them. there must be close on a hundred of them; and they’re fire-raising as they come. curse them!’
‘ah! this lot won’t stay to talk, they’ll kill, if they can,’ said farmer cotton. ‘if tooks don’t come sooner, we’d best get behind cover and shoot without arguing. there’s got to be some fighting before this is settled, mr. frodo.’
the tooks did come sooner. before long they marched in, a hundred strong, from tuckborough and the green hills with pippin at their head. merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians. scouts reported that they were keeping close together. they knew that the countryside had risen against them, and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in bywater. but however grim they, might be, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. they came on without any precautions. merry laid his plans quickly.
the ruffians came tramping along the east road, and without h

but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily. a few of them obeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. a score or more broke back and charged the waggons. six were shot, but the remainder burst out, killing two hobbits, and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end. two more fell as they ran. merry blew a loud horn-call, and there were answering calls from a distance.
‘they won’t get far,’ said pippin. ‘all that country is alive with our hunters now.’
behind, the trapped men in the lane, still about four score, tried to climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or hew them with axes. but many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. several hobbits fell, and the rest were wavering, when merry and pippin, who were on the east side, came across a

frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. when the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, merry, pippin, and sam joined him, and they rode back with the cottons. they ate a late midday meal, and then frodo said with a sigh: ‘well, i suppose it is time now that we dealt with the “chief”.’
‘yes indeed; the sooner the better,’ said merry. ‘and don’t be too gentle! he’s responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the evil they have done.’
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits. ‘for it’s only a guess that there is no ruffians left at bag

it was one of the saddest hours in their lives. the great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow. all along the bywater road every tree had been felled.
as they crossed the bridge and looked up the hill they gasped. e

the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time than sam had feared. the day after the battle frodo rode to michel delving and released the prisoners from the lockholes. one of the first that they found was poor fredegar bolger, fatty no longer. he had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in the brockenbores by the hills of scary.
‘you would have done better to come with us after all, poor old fredegar!’ said pippin, as they carried him out too weak to walk.
he opened an eye and tried gallantly to smile. ‘who’s this young giant with the loud voice?’ he whispered. ‘not little pippin! what’s your size in hats now?’
then there was lobelia. poor thing, she looked very old and thin when they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. she insisted on hobbling out on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and cheering when she appeared, leaning on frodo’s arm but still c

old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than any, and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he needed a lot of feeding up before he could look the part of mayor; so frodo agreed to act as his deputy, until mr. whitfoot was in shape again. the only thing that he did as deputy mayor was to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers. the task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to merry and pippin, and it was soon done. the southern gangs, after hearing the news of the battle of bywater, fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the thain. before the year’s end the few survivors were rounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the borders.
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and sam was kept very busy. hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them. now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages, from the small but

ught to his adventures, he remembered the gift of galadriel. he brought the box out and showed it to the other travellers (for so they were now called by everyone), and asked their advice.
‘i wondered when you would think of it,’ said frodo. ‘open it!’
inside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. ‘what can i do with this?’ said sam.
‘throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!’ said pippin.
‘on what?’ said sam.
‘choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants there,’ said merry.
‘but i’m sure the lady would not like me to keep it all for my own garden, now so many folk have suffered,’ said sam.
‘use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, sam,’ said frodo, ‘and then use the gift to help your work and better it. and use it sparingly. there is not much here, and i expect every grain has a value.’
so sam planted saplings in all the pla

 was not at home in early march and did not know that frodo had been ill. on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream.
‘it is gone for ever,’ he said, ‘and now all is dark and empty.’
but the fit passed, and when sam got back on the twenty-fifth, frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order, and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done.
when all was at last ready frodo said: ‘when are you going to move in and join me, sam?’
sam looked a bit awkward.
‘there is no need to come yet, if you don’t want to,’ said frodo. ‘but you know the gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after by widow rumble.’
it s not that, mr. frodo, said sam, and he went very red.

dings), and they came and lived at bag end. and if sam thought himself lucky, frodo knew that he was more lucky himself; for there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with such care. when the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet life, writing a great deal and going through all his notes. he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free fair that mid-summer, and dear old will whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at banquets.
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow, and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag end. the two young travellers cut a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful parties. ‘lordly’ folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent

‘so i thought too, once. but i have been too deeply hurt, sam. i tried to save the shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. it must often be so, sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. but you are my heir: all that i had and might have had i leave to you. and also you have rose, and elanor; and frodo-lad will come, and rosie-lass, and merry, and goldilocks, and pippin; and perhaps more that i cannot see. your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. you will be the mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the red book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone. so that people will remember the great danger and so love their beloved land all the more. and that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your part of the story goes on.

rds them frodo saw that gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring, narya the great, and the stone upon it was red as fire. then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that gandalf also would take ship with them.
but sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home alone. but even as they stood there, and the elves were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode merry and pippin in great haste. and amid his tears pippin laughed.
‘you tried to give us the slip once before and failed, frodo.’ he said. ‘this time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. it was not sam, though, that gave you away this time, but gandalf himself!’
‘yes,’ said gandalf; ‘for it will be better to ride back three together ‘than one alone. well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth. go in peace! i will no
