bsolutely
fatiguing to see cousin ophelia always so busy. and, in fact, miss
ophelia’s industry was so incessant as to lay some foundation for the
complaint. she sewed and stitched away, from daylight till dark, with
the energy of one who is pressed on by some immediate urgency; and then,
when the light faded, and the work was folded away, with one turn out
came the ever-ready knitting-work, and there she was again, going on as
briskly as ever. it really was a labor to see her.



chapter xx

topsy


one morning, while miss ophelia was busy in some of her domestic cares,
st. clare’s voice was heard, calling her at the foot of the stairs.

“come down here, cousin, i’ve something to show you.”

“what is it?” said miss ophelia, coming down, with her sewing in her
hand.

“i’ve made a purchase for your department,--see here,” said st. clare;
and, with the word, he pulled along a little negro girl, about eight or
nine years of age.

she was one of the blackest of her race; and

stood with her hands demurely folded before her. altogether, there was
something odd and goblin-like about her appearance,--something, as miss
ophelia afterwards said, “so heathenish,” as to inspire that good lady
with utter dismay; and turning to st. clare, she said,

“augustine, what in the world have you brought that thing here for?”

“for you to educate, to be sure, and train in the way she should go.
i thought she was rather a funny specimen in the jim crow line. here,
topsy,” he added, giving a whistle, as a man would to call the attention
of a dog, “give us a song, now, and show us some of your dancing.”

the black, glassy eyes glittered with a kind of wicked drollery, and the
thing struck up, in a clear shrill voice, an odd negro melody, to which
she kept time with her hands and feet, spinning round, clapping her
hands, knocking her knees together, in a wild, fantastic sort of
time, and producing in her throat all those odd guttural sounds which

prolonged closing note, as odd and
unearthly as that of a steam-whistle, she came suddenly down on the
carpet, and stood with her hands folded, and a most sanctimonious
expression of meekness and solemnity over her face, only broken by the
cunning glances which she shot askance from the corners of her eyes.

miss ophelia stood silent, perfectly paralyzed with amazement. st.
clare, like a mischievous fellow as he was, appeared to enjoy her
astonishment; and, addressing the child again, said,

“topsy, this is your new mistress. i’m going to give you up to her; see
now that you behave yourself.”

“yes, mas’r,” said topsy, with sanctimonious gravity, her wicked eyes
twinkling as she spoke.

“you’re going to be good, topsy, you understand,” said st. clare.

“o yes, mas’r,” said topsy, with another twinkle, her hands still
devoutly folded.

“now, augustine, what upon earth is this for?” said miss ophelia. “your
house is so full of these little plagues, now, that a bo

h the subdued and
doleful air which seemed habitual to her, only scanning, with a keen and
furtive glance of her flickering eyes, the ornaments which jane wore in
her ears. when arrayed at last in a suit of decent and whole
clothing, her hair cropped short to her head, miss ophelia, with some
satisfaction, said she looked more christian-like than she did, and in
her own mind began to mature some plans for her instruction.

sitting down before her, she began to question her.

“how old are you, topsy?”

“dun no, missis,” said the image, with a grin that showed all her teeth.

“don’t know how old you are? didn’t anybody ever tell you? who was your
mother?”

“never had none!” said the child, with another grin.

“never had any mother? what do you mean? where were you born?”

“never was born!” persisted topsy, with another grin, that looked so
goblin-like, that, if miss ophelia had been at all nervous, she might
have fancied that she had got hold of some sooty gnome fr

they’s little, and gets ‘em raised for market.”

“how long have you lived with your master and mistress?”

“dun no, missis.”

“is it a year, or more, or less?”

“dun no, missis.”

“laws, missis, those low negroes,--they can’t tell; they don’t know
anything about time,” said jane; “they don’t know what a year is; they
don’t know their own ages.

“have you ever heard anything about god, topsy?”

the child looked bewildered, but grinned as usual.

“do you know who made you?”

“nobody, as i knows on,” said the child, with a short laugh.

the idea appeared to amuse her considerably; for her eyes twinkled, and
she added,

“i spect i grow’d. don’t think nobody never made me.”

“do you know how to sew?” said miss ophelia, who thought she would turn
her inquiries to something more tangible.

“no, missis.”

“what can you do?--what did you do for your master and m

girl; and, as she was looked upon with no gracious eye in the kitchen,
miss ophelia resolved to confine her sphere of operation and instruction
chiefly to her own chamber. with a self-sacrifice which some of our
readers will appreciate, she resolved, instead of comfortably making her
own bed, sweeping and dusting her own chamber,--which she had hitherto
done, in utter scorn of all offers of help from the chambermaid of the
establishment,--to condemn herself to the martyrdom of instructing topsy
to perform these operations,--ah, woe the day! did any of our readers
ever do the same, they will appreciate the amount of her self-sacrifice.

miss ophelia began with topsy by taking her into her chamber, the first
morning, and solemnly commencing a course of instruction in the art and
mystery of bed-making.

behold, then, topsy, washed and shorn of all the little braided
tails wherein her heart had delighted, arrayed in a clean gown, with
well-starched apron, standing reverently before miss o

phelia, with an
expression of solemnity well befitting a funeral.

“now, topsy, i’m going to show you just how my bed is to be made. i am
very particular about my bed. you must learn exactly how to do it.”

“yes, ma’am,” says topsy, with a deep sigh, and a face of woful
earnestness.

“now, topsy, look here;--this is the hem of the sheet,--this is the
right side of the sheet, and this is the wrong;--will you remember?”

“yes, ma’am,” says topsy, with another sigh.

“well, now, the under sheet you must bring over the bolster,--so--and
tuck it clear down under the mattress nice and smooth,--so,--do you
see?”

“yes, ma’am,” said topsy, with profound attention.

“but the upper sheet,” said miss ophelia, “must be brought down in this
way, and tucked under firm and smooth at the foot,--so,--the narrow hem
at the foot.”

“yes, ma’am,” said topsy, as before;--but we will add, what miss ophelia
did not see, that, during
 
 ___________________________
 
 the time when the good lady’s back was turned
in the zeal of her manipulations, the young disciple had contrived to
snatch a pair of gloves and a ribbon, which she had adroitly slipped
into her sleeves, and stood with her hands dutifully folded, as before.

“now, topsy, let’s see _you_ do this,” said miss ophelia, pulling off
the clothes, and seating herself.

topsy, with great gravity and adroitness, went through the exercise
completely to miss ophelia’s satisfaction; smoothing the sheets, patting
out every wrinkle, and exhibiting, through the whole process, a gravity
and seriousness with which her instructress was greatly edified. by an
unlucky slip, however, a fluttering fragment of the ribbon hung out of
one of her sleeves, just as she was finishing, and caught miss ophelia’s
attention. instantly, she pounced upon it. “what’s this? you naughty,
 
 ___________________________
 

wicked child,--you’ve been stealing this!”

the ribbon was pulled out of topsy’s own sleeve, yet was she not in
the least disconcerted; she only looked at it with an air of the most
surprised and unconscious innocence.

“laws! why, that ar’s miss feely’s ribbon, an’t it? how could it a got
caught in my sleeve?

“topsy, you naughty girl, don’t you tell me a lie,--you stole that
ribbon!”

“missis, i declar for ‘t, i didn’t;--never seed it till dis yer blessed
minnit.”

“topsy,” said miss ophelia, “don’t you know it’s wicked to tell lies?”

“i never tell no lies, miss feely,” said topsy, with virtuous gravity;
“it’s jist the truth i’ve been a tellin now, and an’t nothin else.”

“topsy, i shall have to whip you, if you tell lies so.”

“laws, missis, if you’s to whip

all day, couldn’t say no other way,”
 said topsy, beginning to blubber. “i never seed dat ar,--it must a got
caught in my sleeve. miss feeley must have left it on the bed, and it
got caught in the clothes, and so got in my sleeve.”

miss ophelia was so indignant at the barefaced lie, that she caught the
child and shook her.

“don’t you tell me that again!”

the shake brought the glove on to the floor, from the other sleeve.

“there, you!” said miss ophelia, “will you tell me now, you didn’t steal
the ribbon?”

topsy now co

nfessed to the gloves, but still persisted in denying the
ribbon.

“now, topsy,” said miss ophelia, “if you’ll confess all about it, i
won’t whip you this time.” thus adjured, topsy confessed to the ribbon
and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence.

“well, now, tell me. i know you must have taken other things since you
have been in the house, for i let you run about all day yesterday. now,
tell me if you took anything, and i shan’t whip you.”

“laws, missis! i took miss eva’s red thing she wars on her neck.”

“you did, you naughty child!--well, what else?”

“i took rosa’s yer-rings,--them red ones.”

“go bring them to me this minute, both of

 ‘em.”

“laws, missis! i can’t,--they ‘s burnt up!”

“burnt up!--what a story! go get ‘em, or i’ll whip you.”

topsy, with loud protestations, and tears, and groans, declared that she
_could_ not. “they ‘s burnt up,--they was.”

“what did you burn ‘em for?” said miss ophelia.

“cause i ‘s wicked,--i is. i ‘s mighty wicked, any how. i can’t help
it.”

just at this moment, eva came innocently into the room, with the
identical coral necklace on her neck.

“why, eva, where did you get your necklace?” said miss ophelia.

“get it? why, i’ve had it on all day,” said eva.

“did you h

ave it on yesterday?”

“yes; and what is funny, aunty, i had it on all night. i forgot to take
it off when i went to bed.”

miss ophelia looked perfectly bewildered; the more so, as rosa, at that
instant, came into the room, with a basket of newly-ironed linen poised
on her head, and the coral ear-drops shaking in her ears!

“i’m sure i can’t tell anything what to do with such a child!” she said,
in despair. “what in the world did you tell me you took those things
for, topsy?”

“why, missis said i must ‘fess; and i couldn’t think of nothin’ else to
‘fess,” said topsy, rubbing her eyes.

“but, of course, i didn’t want you to confess things you didn’t do,”
 said miss ophelia; “that’s telling a lie, just as much as the other.”

“laws, now, is it?” said topsy, with an air of innocent wonder.

“la, there an’t any such thing as truth in that limb,” said rosa,
looking indignantly at topsy. “if i was mas’r st. clare, i’d whip her

iss eva, you ‘s so good, you don’t know nothing how to get
along with niggers. there’s no way but to cut ‘em well up, i tell ye.”

“rosa!” said eva, “hush! don’t you say another word of that sort!” and
the eye of the child flashed, and her cheek deepened its color.

rosa was cowed in a moment.

“miss eva has got the st. clare blood in her, that’s plain. she can
speak, for all the world, just like her papa,” she said, as she passed
out of the room.

eva stood looking at topsy.

there stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of
society. the fair, high-bred child, with her golden head, her deep eyes,
her spiritual, noble brow, and prince-like movements; and her
black, keen, subtle, cringing, yet acute neighbor. they stood the
representatives of their races. the saxon, born of ages of cultivation,
command, education, physical and moral eminence; the afric, born of ages
of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice!

something, perhaps, of such t

houghts struggled through eva’s mind. but a
child’s thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts; and in eva’s noble
nature many such were yearning and working, for which she had no power
of utterance. when miss ophelia expatiated on topsy’s naughty, wicked
conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly.

“poor topsy, why need you steal? you’re going to be taken good care of
now. i’m sure i’d rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal
it.”

it was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life;
and the sweet tone and manner struck strangely on the wild, rude
heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round,
glittering eye; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual
grin. no! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely

ulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and topsy only thought
eva’s speech something funny and inexplicable,--she did not believe it.

but what was to be done with topsy? miss ophelia found the case a
puzzler; her rules for bringing up didn’t seem to apply. she thought she
would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time, and in
hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark
closets, miss ophelia shut topsy up in one till she had arranged her
ideas further on the subject.

“i don’t see,” said miss ophelia to st. clare, “how i’m going to manage
that child, without whipping her.”

“well, whip her, then, to your heart’s content; i’ll give you full power
to do what you like.”

“children always have to be whipped,” said miss ophelia; “i never heard
of bringing them up without.”

“o, well, certainly,” said st. clare; “do as you think best. only i’ll

threw them slyly out of the
window, or down in chinks of the walls; she tangled, broke, and
dirtied her thread, or, with a sly movement, would throw a spool away
altogether. her motions were almost as quick as those of a practised
conjurer, and her command of her face quite as great; and though miss
ophelia could not help feeling that so many accidents could not possibly
happen in succession, yet she could not, without a watchfulness which
would leave her no time for anything else, detect her.

topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment. her talent for
every species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,--for dancing, tumbling,
climbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her
fancy,--seemed inexhaustible. in her play-hours, she invariably had
every child in the establishment at her heels, open-mouthed with
admiration and wonder,--not excepting miss eva, who appeared to be
fascinated by her wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by
a glittering serpent. miss op

helia was uneasy that eva should fancy
topsy’s society so much, and implored st. clare to forbid it.

“poh! let the child alone,” said st. clare. “topsy will do her good.”

“but so depraved a child,--are you not afraid she will teach her some
mischief?”

“she can’t teach her mischief; she might teach it to some children, but
evil rolls off eva’s mind like dew off a cabbage-leaf,--not a drop sinks
in.”

“don’t be too sure,” said miss ophelia. “i know i’d never let a child of
mine play with topsy.”

“well, your children needn’t,” said st. clare, “but mine may; if eva
could have been spoiled, it would have been do

ne years ago.”

topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. they
soon found reason to alter their opinion. it was very soon discovered
that whoever cast an indignity on topsy was sure to meet with some
inconvenient accident shortly after;--either a pair of ear-rings or
some cherished trinket would be missing, or an article of dress would
be suddenly found utterly ruined, or the person would stumble
accidently into a pail of hot water, or a libation of dirty slop would
unaccountably deluge them from above when in full gala dress;-and on all
these occasions, when investigation was made, there was nobody found to
stand sponsor for the indignity. topsy was cited, and ha

without it.

the mischiefs done were always so nicely timed, also, as further to
shelter the aggressor. thus, the times for revenge on rosa and jane,
the two chamber maids, were always chosen in those seasons when (as not
unfrequently happened) they were in disgrace with their mistress, when
any complaint from them would of course meet with no sympathy. in short,
topsy soon made the household understand the propriety of letting her
alone; and she was let alone, accordingly.

topsy was smart and energetic in all manual operations, learning
everything that was taught her with surprising quickness. with a few
lessons, she had learned to do the proprieties of miss ophelia’s chamber
in a way with which even that particular lady could find no fault.

ly, than topsy, when
she chose,--but she didn’t very often choose. if miss ophelia, after
three or four days of careful patient supervision, was so sanguine as
to suppose that topsy had at last fallen into her way, could do without
over-looking, and so go off and busy herself about something else, topsy
would hold a perfect carnival of confusion, for some one or two hours.
instead of making the bed, she would amuse herself with pulling off the
pillowcases, butting her woolly head among the pillows, till it would
sometimes be grotesquely ornamented with feathers sticking out in
various directions; she would climb the posts, and hang head downward
from the tops; flourish the sheets and spreads all over the apartment;
dress the bolster up in miss ophelia’s night-clothes, and enact various
perfo
 
 ___________________________
 
rmances with that,--singing and whistling, and making grimaces
at herself in the looking-glass; in short, as miss ophelia phrased it,
“raising cain” generally.

on one occasion, miss ophelia found topsy with her very best scarlet
india canton crape shawl wound round her head for a turban, going on
with her rehearsals before the glass in great style,--miss ophelia
having, with carelessness most unheard-of in her, left the key for once
in her drawer.

“topsy!” she would say, when at the end of all patience, “what does make
you act so?”

“dunno, missis,--i spects cause i ‘s so wicked!”

“i don’t know anything what i shall do with you, topsy.”

“law, missis, you must whip me; my old missis allers whipped me. i an’t
used to workin’ unless i gets whipped.”

“why, topsy, i don’t want to whip you. you can do well, if you’ve a mind
to; what is the reason you won’t?”

“laws, missis, i ‘s used to whippin’; i spects 
 
 ___________________________
 
it’s good for me.”

miss ophelia tried the recipe, and topsy invariably made a terrible
commotion, screaming, groaning and imploring, though half an hour
afterwards, when roosted on some projection of the balcony, and
surrounded by a flock of admiring “young uns,” she would express the
utmost contempt of the whole affair.

“law, miss feely whip!--wouldn’t kill a skeeter, her whippins. oughter
see how old mas’r made the flesh fly; old mas’r know’d how!”

topsy always made great capital of her own sins and enormities,
evidently considering them as something peculiarly distinguishing.

“law, you niggers,” she would say to some of her auditors, “does you
know you ‘s all sinners? well, you is--everybody is. white folks is
sinners too,--miss feely says so; but i spects niggers is the biggest
ones; but lor! ye an’t any on ye up to me. i ‘s so awful wicked there
can’t nobody do nothin’ with me. i used to keep old missis a swarin’ at
me hal

f de time. i spects i ‘s the wickedest critter in the world;”
 and topsy would cut a summerset, and come up brisk and shining on to a
higher perch, and evidently plume herself on the distinction.

miss ophelia busied herself very earnestly on sundays, teaching topsy
the catechism. topsy had an uncommon verbal memory, and committed with a
fluency that greatly encouraged her instructress.

“what good do you expect it is going to do her?” said st. clare.

“why, it always has done children good. it’s what children always have
to learn, you know,” said miss ophelia.

“understand it or not,” said st. clare.

“o, children never understand it at the time; but, after they are grown
up, it’ll come to them.”

“mine hasn’t come to me yet,” said st. clare, “thou
 
 ___________________________
 
gh i’ll bear
testimony that you put it into me pretty thoroughly when i was a boy.”’

“ah, you were always good at learning, augustine. i used to have great
hopes of you,” said miss ophelia.

“well, haven’t you now?” said st. clare.

“i wish you were as good as you were when you were a boy, augustine.”

“so do i, that’s a fact, cousin,” said st. clare. “well, go ahead and
catechize topsy; may be you’ll make out something yet.”

topsy, who had stood like a black statue during this discussion, with
hands decently folded, now, at a signal from miss ophelia, went on:

“our first parents, being left to the freedom of their own will, fell
from the state wherein they were created.”

topsy’s eyes twinkled, and she looked inquiringly.

“what is it, topsy?” said miss ophelia.

“please, missis, was dat ar state kintuck?”

“what state, topsy?”

“dat state dey fell out of. i used to hear mas’r tell how we came down
 
 ___________________________
 

from kintuck.”

st. clare laughed.

“you’ll have to give her a meaning, or she’ll make one,” said he. “there
seems to be a theory of emigration suggested there.”

“o! augustine, be still,” said miss ophelia; “how can i do anything, if
you will be laughing?”

“well, i won’t disturb the exercises again, on my honor;” and st. clare
took his paper into the parlor, and sat down, till topsy had finished
her recitations. they were all very well, only that now and then she
would oddly transpose some important words, and persist in the mistake,
in spite of every effort to the contrary; and st. clare, after all his
promises of goodness, took a wicked pleasure in these mistakes, calling
topsy to him whenever he had a mind to amuse himself, and getting her to
repeat the offending passages, in spite of miss ophelia’s remonstrances.

“how do you think i can do anything with the child,
 
 ___________________________
 
 if you will go on
so, augustine?” she would say.

“well, it is too bad,--i won’t again; but i do like to hear the droll
little image stumble over those big words!”

“but you confirm her in the wrong way.”

“what’s the odds? one word is as good as another to her.”

“you wanted me to bring her up right; and you ought to remember she is a
reasonable creature, and be careful of your influence over her.”

“o, dismal! so i ought; but, as topsy herself says, ‘i ‘s so wicked!’”

in very much this way topsy’s training proceeded, for a year or
two,--miss ophelia worrying herself, from day to day, with her, as a
kind of chronic plague, to whose inflictions she became, in time, as
accustomed, as persons sometimes do to the neuralgia or sick headache.

st. clare took the same kind of amusement in the child that a man might
in the tricks of a parrot or a pointer. topsy, whenever her sins brought
her into disgrace in other quarters,

 always took refuge behind his
chair; and st. clare, in one way or other, would make peace for her.
from him she got many a stray picayune, which she laid out in nuts and
candies, and distributed, with careless generosity, to all the children
in the family; for topsy, to do her justice, was good-natured and
liberal, and only spiteful in self-defence. she is fairly introduced
into our _corps de ballet_, and will figure, from time to time, in her
turn, with other performers.

our readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval,
at uncle tom’s cabin, on the kentucky farm, and see what has been
transpiring among those whom he had left behind.

unworldly wisdom, that they seemed to be an inspiration. at such
times, st. clare would feel a sudden thrill, and clasp her in his arms,
as if that fond clasp could save her; and his heart rose up with wild
determination to keep her, never to let her go.

the child’s whole heart and soul seemed absorbed in works of love and
kindness. impulsively generous she had always been; but there was
a touching and womanly thoughtfulness about her now, that every one
noticed. she still loved to play with topsy, and the various colored
children; but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their
plays, and she would sit for half an hour at a time, laughing at the odd
tricks of topsy,--and then a shadow would seem to pass across her face,
her eyes grew misty, and her thoughts were afar.

“mamma,” she said, suddenly, to her mother, one day, “why don’t we teach
our servants to read?”

“what a question child! people never do.”

“why don’t they?” said eva.

“because it is no

 use for them to read. it don’t help them to work any
better, and they are not made for anything else.”

“but they ought to read the bible, mamma, to learn god’s will.”

“o! they can get that read to them all _they_ need.”

“it seems to me, mamma, the bible is for every one to read themselves.
they need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it.”

“eva, you are an odd child,” said her mother.

“miss ophelia has taught topsy to read,” continued eva.

“yes, and you see how much good it does. topsy is the worst creature i
ever saw!”

“here’s poor mammy!” said eva. “she does love the bible so much, and
wishes so she could read! and what will she do when i can’t read to
her?”

marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered,

“well, of course, by and by, eva, you will have other things to think
of besides reading the bible round to servants. not but that is very
proper; i’ve

 that they should have felt just so in her
circumstances; but marie’s words went beyond her, and she felt less
heat.

“i wouldn’t have the child treated so, for the world,” she said; “but,
i am sure, augustine, i don’t know what to do. i’ve taught and taught;
i’ve talked till i’m tired; i’ve whipped her; i’ve punished her in every
way i can think of, and she’s just what she was at first.”

“come here, tops, you monkey!” said st. clare, calling the child up to
him.

topsy came up; her round, hard eyes glittering and blinking with a
mixture of apprehensiveness and their usual odd drollery.

“what makes you behave so?” said st. clare, who could not help being
amused with the child’s expression.

“spects it’s my wicked heart,” said topsy, demurely; “miss feely says
so.”

“don’t you see how much miss ophelia has done for you? she says she has
done everything she can think of.”

“lor, yes, mas’r! old missis used to say so, too. she whipped m

to ask one question,” said st. clare.

“what is it?”

“why, if your gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child,
that you can have at home here, all to yourself, what’s the use of
sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just
such? i suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of
your heathen are.”

miss ophelia did not make an immediate answer; and eva, who had stood a
silent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to topsy to
follow her. there was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah,
which st. clare used as a sort of reading-room; and eva and topsy
disappeared into this place.

“what’s eva going about, now?” said st. clare; “i mean to see.”

and, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the
glass-door, and looked in. in a moment, laying his finger on his lips,
he made a silent gesture to miss ophelia to come and look. there sat the
two children on the floor, with their side

with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to
her, eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large
eyes.

“what does make you so bad, topsy? why won’t you try and be good? don’t
you love _anybody_, topsy?”

“donno nothing ‘bout love; i loves candy and sich, that’s all,” said
topsy.

“but you love your father and mother?”

“never had none, ye know. i telled ye that, miss eva.”

“o, i know,” said eva, sadly; “but hadn’t you any brother, or sister, or
aunt, or--”

“no, none on ‘em,--never had nothing nor nobody.”

“but, topsy, if you’d only try to be good, you might--”

“couldn’t never be nothin’ but a nigger, if i was ever so good,” said
topsy. “if i could be skinned, and come white, i’d try then.”

“but people can love you, if

 you are black, topsy. miss ophelia would
love you, if you were good.”

topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing
incredulity.

“don’t you think so?” said eva.

“no; she can’t bar me, ‘cause i’m a nigger!--she’d ‘s soon have a
toad touch her! there can’t nobody love niggers, and niggers can’t do
nothin’! _i_ don’t care,” said topsy, beginning to whistle.

“o, topsy, poor child, _i_ love you!” said eva, with a sudden burst of
feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on topsy’s shoulder;
“i love you, because you haven’t had any father, or mother, or
friends;--because you’ve been a poor, abused child! i love you, and i
want you to be good. i am very unwell, topsy, and i think i shan’t live
a great while; and it really grieves me, to have you be so naughty. i
wish you would try to be good, for my sake;--it’s only a little while i

 with you.”

the round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with
tears;--large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on
the little white hand. yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray
of heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! she
laid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,--while the
beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some
bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.

“poor topsy!” said eva, “don’t you know that jesus loves all alike? he
is just as willing to love you, as me. he loves you just as i do,--only
more, because he is better. he will help you to be good; and you can go
to heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you
were white. only think of it, topsy!--_you_ can be one of those spirits
bright, uncle tom sings about.”

“o, dear miss eva, dear miss eva!” said the child; “i will try, i will
try; i never did care nothin’ about i

nd falling waters of the lake.

it was towards the middle of the afternoon, as she was so
reclining,--her bible half open, her little transparent fingers lying
listlessly between the leaves,--suddenly she heard her mother’s voice,
in sharp tones, in the verandah.

“what now, you baggage!--what new piece of mischief! you’ve been picking
the flowers, hey?” and eva heard the sound of a smart slap.

“law, missis! they ‘s for miss eva,” she heard a voice say, which she
knew belonged to topsy.

“miss eva! a pretty excuse!--you suppose she wants _your_ flowers, you
good-for-nothing nigger! get along off with you!”

in a moment, eva was off from her lounge, and in the verandah.

“o, don’t, mother! i should like the flowers; do give them to me; i want
them!”

“why, eva, your room is full now.”

“i can’t have too many,” said eva. “topsy, do bring them here.”

topsy, who had stood sullenly, holding down her head, now came up
and offered her flowers. she did it wit

h a look of hesitation and
bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was
usual with her.

“it’s a beautiful bouquet!” said eva, looking at it.

it was rather a singular one,--a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one
single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. it was tied up with an
evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf
had carefully been studied.

topsy looked pleased, as eva said,--“topsy, you arrange flowers very
prettily. here,” she said, “is this vase i haven’t any flowers for. i
wish you’d arrange something every day for it.”

“well, that’s odd!” said marie. “what in the world do you want that
for?”

“never mind, mamma; you’d as lief as not topsy should do it,--had you
not?”

“of course, anything you please, dear! topsy, you hear your young
mistress;--see that you mind.”

topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she turned away,
eva

 saw a tear roll down her dark cheek.

“you see, mamma, i knew poor topsy wanted to do something for me,” said
eva to her mother.

“o, nonsense! it’s only because she likes to do mischief. she knows she
mustn’t pick flowers,--so she does it; that’s all there is to it. but,
if you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it.”

“mamma, i think topsy is different from what she used to be; she’s
trying to be a good girl.”

“she’ll have to try a good while before _she_ gets to be good,” said
marie, with a careless laugh.

“well, you know, mamma, poor topsy! everything has always been against
her.”

“not since she’s been here, i’m sure. if she hasn’t been talked to, and
preached to, and every earthly thing done that anybody could do;--and
she’s just so ugly, and always will be; you can’t make anything of the
creature!

”

“but, mamma, it’s so different to be brought up as i’ve been, with
so many friends, so many things to make me good and happy; and to be
brought up as she’s been, all the time, till she came here!”

“most likely,” said marie, yawning,--“dear me, how hot it is!”

“mamma, you believe, don’t you, that topsy could become an angel, as
well as any of us, if she were a christian?”

“topsy! what a ridiculous idea! nobody but you would ever think of it. i
suppose she could, though.”

“but, mamma, isn’t god her father, as much as ours? isn’t jesus her
saviour?”

“well, that may be. i suppose god made everybody,” said marie. “where is
my smelling-bottle?”

“it’s such a pity,--oh! _such_ a pity!” said eva, looking out on the
distant lake, and speaking half to herself.

“what’s a pity?” said marie.

“why, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and l

see you in heaven,--for i’m sure i
shall; and mammy,--dear, good, kind mammy!” she said, fondly throwing
her arms round her old nurse,--“i know you’ll be there, too.”

“o, miss eva, don’t see how i can live without ye, no how!” said the
faithful creature. “‘pears like it’s just taking everything off the
place to oncet!” and mammy gave way to a passion of grief.

miss ophelia pushed her and tom gently from the apartment, and thought
they were all gone; but, as she turned, topsy was standing there.

“where did you start up from?” she said, suddenly.

“i was here,” said topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. “o, miss eva,
i’ve been a bad girl; but won’t you give _me_ one, too?”

“yes, poor topsy! to be sure, i will. there--every time you look at
that, think that i love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!”

“o, miss eva, i _is_ tryin!” said topsy, earnestly; “but, lor, it’s so
hard to be good! ‘pears like i an’t used to it, no ways!”

“jesus knows it, topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you.”

topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the
apartment by miss ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl
in her bosom.

all being gone, miss ophelia shut the door. that worthy lady had wiped
away many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the
consequence of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in
her mind.

st. clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading
his eyes, in the same attitude.

when they were all gone, h

which characterizes their race. even now, while st. clare stood
there thinking, little rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a
basket of white flowers. she stepped back when she saw st. clare, and
stopped respectfully; but, seeing that he did not observe her, she came
forward to place them around the dead. st. clare saw her as in a dream,
while she placed in the small hands a fair cape jessamine, and, with
admirable taste, disposed other flowers around the couch.

the door opened again, and topsy, her eyes swelled with crying,
appeared, holding something under her apron. rosa made a quick
forbidding gesture; but she took a step into the room.

“you must go out,” said rosa, in a sharp, positive whisper; “_you_
haven’t any business here!”

“o, do let me! i brought a flower,--such a pretty one!” said topsy,
holding up a half-blown tea rose-bud. “do let me put just one there.”

“get along!” said rosa, more decidedly.

“let her stay!” said st. clare, suddenly stampi

ng his foot. “she shall
come.”

rosa suddenly retreated, and topsy came forward and laid her offering at
the feet of the corpse; then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry,
she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned
aloud.

miss ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence her;
but in vain.

“o, miss eva! oh, miss eva! i wish i ‘s dead, too,--i do!”

there was a piercing wildness in the cry; the blood flushed into st.
clare’s white, marble-like face, and the first tears he had shed since
eva died stood in hi

s eyes.

“get up, child,” said miss ophelia, in a softened voice; “don’t cry so.
miss eva is gone to heaven; she is an angel.”

“but i can’t see her!” said topsy. “i never shall see her!” and she
sobbed again.

they all stood a moment in silence.

“_she_ said she _loved_ me,” said topsy,--“she did! o, dear! oh, dear!
there an’t _nobody_ left now,--there an’t!”

“that’s true enough” said st. clare; “but do,” he said to miss ophelia,
“see if you can’t comfort the poor creature.”

“i jist wish i hadn’t never been born,” said topsy. “i didn’t want to be
born, no ways; and i don’t see no use on ‘t.”

miss ophelia raised her gently, but firmly, and took her from the room;
but, as she did so, some tears fell from her eyes.

d day and night, and was, from excess of sorrow, less skilful
and alert in her ministrations of her mistress than usual, which drew
down a constant storm of invectives on her defenceless head.

miss ophelia felt the loss; but, in her good and honest heart, it bore
fruit unto everlasting life. she was more softened, more gentle; and,
though equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and
quiet air, as one who communed with her own heart not in vain. she was
more diligent in teaching topsy,--taught her mainly from the bible,--did
not any longer shrink from her touch, or manifest an ill-repressed
disgust, because she felt none. she viewed her now through the softened
medium that eva’s hand had first held before her eyes, and saw in her
only an immortal creature, whom god had sent to be led by her to glory
and virtue. topsy did not become at once a saint; but the life and death
of eva did work a marked change in her. the callous indifference was
gone; there was now sensibility, h

ope, desire, and the striving for
good,--a strife irregular, interrupted, suspended oft, but yet renewed
again.

one day, when topsy had been sent for by miss ophelia, she came, hastily
thrusting something into her bosom.

“what are you doing there, you limb? you’ve been stealing something,
i’ll be bound,” said the imperious little rosa, who had been sent to
call her, seizing her, at the same time, roughly by the arm.

“you go ‘long, miss rosa!” said topsy, pulling from her; “‘tan’t none o’
your business!”

“none o’ your sa’ce!” said rosa, “i saw you hiding something,--i know
yer tricks,” and rosa seized her arm, and tried to force her hand into
her bosom, while topsy, enraged, kicked and fought valiantly for what
she considered her rights. the clamor and confusion of the battle drew
miss ophelia and st. clare both to the spot.

“she’s been stealing!” said rosa.

“i han’t, neither!” vociferated topsy, sobbing wit

h passion.

“give me that, whatever it is!” said miss ophelia, firmly.

topsy hesitated; but, on a second order, pulled out of her bosom a
little parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings.

miss ophelia turned it out. there was a small book, which had been given
to topsy by eva, containing a single verse of scripture, arranged for
every day in the year, and in a paper the curl of hair that she had
given her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell.

st. clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it; the little book
had been rolled in a long strip of black crape, torn from the funeral
weeds.

“what did you wrap _this_ round the book for?” said st. clare, holding
up the crape.

“cause,--cause,--cause ‘t was miss eva. o, don’t take

‘em away, please!”
 she said; and, sitting flat down on the floor, and putting her apron
over her head, she began to sob vehemently.

it was a curious mixture of the pathetic and the ludicrous,--the little
old stockings,--black crape,--text-book,--fair, soft curl,--and topsy’s
utter distress.

st. clare smiled; but there were tears in his eyes, as he said,

“come, come,--don’t cry; you shall have them!” and, putting them
together, he threw them into her lap, and drew miss ophelia with him
into the parlor.

“i really think you can make something of that concern,” he said,
pointing with his thumb backward over his shoulder. “any mind that
is capable of a _real sorrow_ is capable of good. you must try and do
something with her.”

ophelia. “come, now, here’s paper, pen, and ink; just write a paper.”

st. clare, like most men of his class of mind, cordially hated the
present tense of action, generally; and, therefore, he was considerably
annoyed by miss ophelia’s downrightness.

“why, what’s the matter?” said he. “can’t you take my word? one would
think you had taken lessons of the jews, coming at a fellow so!”

“i want to make sure of it,” said miss ophelia. “you may die, or fail,
and then topsy be hustled off to auction, spite of all i can do.”

“really, you are quite provident. well, seeing i’m in the hands of a
yankee, there is nothing for it but to concede;” and st. clare rapidly
wrote off a deed of gift, which, as he was well versed in the forms
of law, he could easily do, and signed his name to it in sprawling
capitals, concluding by a tremendous flourish.

“there, isn’t that black and white, now, miss vermont?” he said, as he
handed it to her.

“good boy,” said

it. it would certainly be a greater self-denial to receive heathen among
us, than to send missionaries to them; but i think we would do it.”

“_you_ would, i know,” said st. clare. “i’d like to see anything you
wouldn’t do, if you thought it your duty!”

“well, i’m not uncommonly good,” said miss ophelia. “others would,
if they saw things as i do. i intend to take topsy home, when i go.
i suppose our folks will wonder, at first; but i think they will be
brought to see as i do. besides, i know there are many people at the
north who do exactly what you said.”

“yes, but they are a minority; and, if we should begin to emancipate to
any extent, we should soon hear from you.”

miss ophelia did not reply. there was a pause of some moments; and st.
clare’s countenance was overcast by a sad, dreamy expression.

george, with his wife, children, sister and mother, embarked for africa,
some few weeks after. if we are not mistaken, the world will yet hear
from him there.

of our other characters we have nothing very particular to write, except
a word relating to miss ophelia and topsy, and a farewell chapter, which
we shall dedicate to george shelby.

miss ophelia took topsy home to vermont with her, much to the surprise
of the grave deliberative body whom a new englander recognizes under
the term “_our folks_.” “our folks,” at first, thought it an odd and
unnecessary addition to their well-trained domestic establishment; but,
so thoroughly efficient was miss ophelia in her conscientious endeavor
to do her duty by her _élève_, that the child rapidly grew in grace a
