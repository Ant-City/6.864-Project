chapter 2

the passing of the grey company

gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night, when merry came back to aragorn. he had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at parth galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard. hasufel was already saddled. legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by.
â€˜so four of the company still remain,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜we will ride on together. but we shall not go alone, as i thought. the king is now determined to set out at once. since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the hills under cover of night.â€™
â€˜and then whither?â€™ said legolas.
â€˜i cannot say yet,â€™ aragorn answered. â€˜as for the king, he will go to the muster that he commanded at edoras, four nights from now. and there, i think

, he will hear tidings of war, and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith. but for myself, and any that will go with me . . .â€™
â€˜i for one!â€™ cried legolas. â€˜and gimli with him!â€™ said the dwarf.
â€˜well, for myself,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜it is dark before me. i must go down also to minas tirith, but i do not yet see the road. an hour long prepared approaches.â€™
â€˜donâ€™t leave me behind!â€™ said merry. â€˜i have not been of much use yet; but i donâ€™t want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. i donâ€™t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now. though, of course, the king did say that i was to sit by him when he came

 to his house and tell him all about the shire.â€™
â€˜yes,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜and your road lies with him, i think, merry. but do not look for mirth at the ending. it will be long, i fear, ere thÃ©oden sits at ease again in meduseld. many hopes will wither in this bitter spring.â€™
soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with gimli behind legolas, and merry in front of aragorn. presently they were riding swiftly through the night. they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen, when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line.
â€˜my lord,â€™ he said to the king, â€˜there are horsemen behind us. as we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them. now we are sure. they are overtaking us, riding hard.â€™
thÃ©oden at once called a halt. the riders turned about and seized their spears. aragorn dismounted and set

and aragorn said: â€˜now i know what you bear. bear it still for me a while!â€™ and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars, and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the nightâ€™s journey lasted.
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from deeping-coomb and came back to the hornburg. there they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel.
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli. â€˜the sun is high,â€™ said legolas. â€˜all others are up and doing. come, master sluggard, and look at this place while you may!â€™
â€˜there was a battle here three nights ago,â€™ said gimli, â€˜and here legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc. come and see how it was! and there are caves, merry, caves of wonder! shall we visit them, legolas, do you think?â€™
â€˜nay! there is no time,â€™ said the elf. â€˜do not spoil the wonder with haste! i have given you my word to retur

her dismal. he missed pippin, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand. â€˜where is aragorn?â€™ he asked.
â€˜in a high chamber of the burg,â€™ said legolas. â€˜he has neither rested nor slept, i think. he went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take thought, and only his kinsman, halbarad, went with him; but some dark doubt or care sits on him.â€™
â€˜they are a strange company, these newcomers,â€™ said gimli. â€˜stout men and lordly they are, and the riders of rohan look almost as boys beside them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, even as aragorn himself; and they are silent.â€™
â€˜but even as aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.â€™ said legolas. â€˜and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir? less sombre is their gear than the othersâ€™, and they are fair and gallant as elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the son

s of elrond of rivendell.â€™
â€˜why have they come? have you heard?â€™ asked merry. he had now dressed, and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out together towards the ruined gate of the burg.
â€˜they answered a summons, as you heard,â€™ said gimli. â€˜word came to rivendell, they say: aragorn has need of his kindred. let the dÃºnedain ride to him in rohan! but whence this message came they are now in doubt. gandalf sent it, i would guess.â€™
â€˜nay, galadriel,â€™ said legolas. â€˜did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of the grey company from the north?â€™
â€˜yes, you have it,â€™ said gimli. â€˜the lady of the wood! she read many hearts and desires. now why did not we wish for some of our own kinsfolk, legolas?â€™
legolas stood be

like a rayed star.
the king mounted his horse, snowmane, and merry sat beside him on his pony: stybba was his name. presently Ã©omer came out from the gate, and with him was aragorn, and halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old so much alike were they, the sons of elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. behind them walked legolas and gimli. but merry had eyes only for aragorn, so startling was the change that he saw in him, as if in one night many years had fallen on his head. grim was his face, grey-hued and weary.
â€˜i am troubled in mind, lord,â€™ he said, standing by the kingâ€™s horse. â€˜i have heard strange words, and i see new perils far off. i have laboured long in thought, and now i fear that i must change my purpose. tell me, thÃ©oden, you ride now to dunharrow, how long will it be ere you come there?â€™
â€˜it is now a

â€˜you will do as you will, my lord aragorn,â€™ said thÃ©oden. â€˜it is your doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. this parting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now i must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer. farewell!â€™
â€˜farewell, lord!â€™ said aragorn. â€˜ride unto great renown! farewell, merry! i leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn. legolas and gimli will still hunt with me, i hope; but we shall not forget you.â€™
â€˜good-bye!â€™ said merry. he could find no more to say. he felt very small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin. the riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start arid get it over.
now thÃ©oden spoke to Ã©omer, and he lifted up his hand and cried aloud, and with that word the riders set forth. they rode over

â€˜a little people, but of great worth are the shire-folk,â€™ said halbarad. â€˜little do they know of our long labour for the safekeeping of their borders, and yet i grudge it not.â€™
â€˜and now our fates are woven together,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜and yet, alas! here we must part. well, i must eat a little, and then we also must hasten away. come, legolas and gimli! i must speak with you as i eat.â€™
together they went back into the burg; yet for some time aragorn sat silent at the table in the hall, and the others waited for him to speak. â€˜come!â€™ said legolas at last. â€˜speak and be comforted, and shake off the shadow! what has happened since we came back to this grim place in the grey morning?â€™
â€˜a struggle somewhat grimmer for my part than the battle of the hornburg,â€™ answered aragorn. â€˜i have looked in the stone of orthanc, my friends.â€™

â€˜you have looked in that accursed stone of wizardry!â€™ exclaimed gimli with fear and astonishment in his face. â€˜did you say aught to - him? even gandalf feared that encounter.â€™
â€˜you forget to whom you speak,â€™ said aragorn sternly, and his eyes glinted. â€˜did i not openly proclaim my title before the doors of edoras? what do you fear that i should say to him? nay, gimli,â€™ he said in a softer voice, and the grimness left his face, and he looked like one who has laboured in sleepless pain for many nights. â€˜nay, my friends, i and the lawful master of the stone, and i had both the right and the strength to use it, or so i judged. the right cannot be doubted. the strength was enough - barely.â€™
he drew a deep breath. â€˜it was a bitter struggle, and the weariness is slow to pass. i spoke no word to him, and in the end i wrenched the stone to my own will. that

â€˜but he wields great dominion, nonetheless,â€™ said gimli; â€˜and now he will strike more swiftly.â€™
â€˜the hasty stroke goes oft astray,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜we must press our enemy, and no longer wait upon him for the move. see my friends, when i had mastered the stone, i learned many things. a grave peril i saw coming unlooked-for upon gondor from the south that will draw off great strength from the defence of minas tirith. if it is not countered swiftly, i deem that the city will be lost ere ten days be gone.â€™

mli. â€˜for what help is there to send thither, and how could it come there in time?â€™
â€˜i have no help to send, therefore i must go myself,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but there is only one way through the mountains that will bring me to the coastlands before all is lost. that is the paths of the dead.â€™
â€˜the paths of the dead!â€™ said gimli. â€˜it is a fell name; and little to the liking to the men of rohan, as i saw. can the living use such a road and not perish? and even if you pass that way, what will so few avail to counter the strokes of mordor?â€™
â€˜the living have never used that road since the coming of the rohirrim,â€™ said aragorn, â€˜for it is closed to them. but in this dark hour the heir of isildur may use it, if he dare. listen! this is the word that the sons of elrond bring to me from their father in rivendell, wis

he shall pass the door to the paths of the dead.
â€˜dark ways doubtless, said gimli, but no darker than these staves are to me.â€™
â€˜if you would understand them better, then i bid you come with me,â€™ said aragorn; â€˜for that way i now shall take. but i do not go gladly; only need drives me. therefore, only of your free will would i have you come, for you will find both toil and great fear, and maybe worse.â€™
â€˜i will go with you even on the paths of the dead, and to whatever, end they may lead,â€™ said gimli.

â€˜i hope that the forgotten people will not have forgotten how to fight,â€™ said gimli; â€˜for otherwise i see not why we should trouble them.â€™
â€˜that we shall know if ever we come to erech,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but the oath that they broke was to fight against sauron, and they must fight therefore, if they are to fulfil it. for at erech there stands yet a black stone that was brought, it was said, from nÃºmenor by isildur; and it was set upon a hill, and upon it the king of the mountains swore allegiance to him in the beginning of the realm of gondor. but when sauron returned

he stood up. â€˜come!â€™ he cried, and drew his sword, and it flashed in the twilit hall of the burg. â€˜to the stone of erech! i seek the paths of the dead. come with me who will!â€™
legolas and gimli made no answer, but they rose and followed aragorn from the hall. on the green there waited, still and silent, the hooded rangers. legolas and gimli mounted. aragorn sprang upon roheryn. then halbarad lifted a great horn, and the blast of it echoed in helmâ€™s deep; and with that they leapt away, riding down the coomb like thunder, while all the men that were left on dike or burg stared in amaze.
and while thÃ©oden went by slow paths in the hills, the grey company passed swiftly over the plain,

then they said no more, and they ate in silence; but her eyes were ever upon aragorn, and the others saw that she was in great torment of mind. at length they arose, and took their leave of the lady, and thanked her for her care, and went to their rest.
but as aragorn came to the booth where he was to lodge with legolas and gimli, and his companions had gone in. there came the lady Ã©owyn after him and called to him. he turned and saw her as a glimmer in the night, for she was clad in white; but her eyes were on fire.
â€˜aragorn,â€™ she said, â€˜why will you go on this deadly road?â€™
â€˜because i must,â€™ he said. â€˜only so can i see any hope of doing my part in the war against sauron. i do not choose paths of peril, Ã©owyn. were i to go where my heart dwells, far in the north i would now be wandering in the fair vall

s all mounted, and he was about to leap into the saddle, when the lady Ã©owyn came to bid them farewell. she was clad as a rider and girt with a sword. in her hand she bore a cup, and she set it to her lips and drank a little, wishing them good speed; and then she gave the cup to aragorn, and he drank, and he said: â€˜farewell, lady of rohan! i drink to the fortunes of your house, and of you, and of all your people. say to your brother: beyond the shadows we may meet again!â€™
then it seemed to gimli and legolas who were nearby that she wept, and in one so stern and proud that seemed the more grievous. but she said: â€˜aragorn, wilt thou go?â€™
â€˜i will,â€™ he said.
â€˜then wilt thou not let me ride with this company, as i have asked?â€™
â€˜i will not, lady,â€™ he said. â€˜for that i could not grant without leave of the king and of your brother; and they will not return until tomorrow. but i count now every hour, indeed every minute. farewell!â€™
then she fell on her knees, saying: â€˜i be

the light was still grey as they rode, for the sun had not yet climbed over the black ridges of the haunted mountain before them. a dread fell on them, even as they passed between the lines of ancient stones and so came to the dimholt. there under the gloom of black trees that not even legolas could long endure they found a hollow place opening at the mountainâ€™s root, and right in their path stood a single mighty stone like a finger of doom.
â€˜my blood runs chill,â€™ said gimli, but the others were silent, and his voice fell dead on the dank fir-needles at his feet. the horses would not pass the threatening stone, until the riders dismounted and led them about. and so they came at last deep into the glen; and there stood a sheer wall of rock, and in the wall the dark door gaped before them like the mouth of night. signs and figures were carved above its wide arch too dim to read, and fear flowed from it like a grey vapour.
the company halted, and there was not a heart

m. and indeed the love that the horses of the rangers bore for their riders was so great that they were willing to face even the terror of the door, if their mastersâ€™ hearts were steady as they walked beside them. but arod, the horse of rohan, refused the way, and he stood sweating and trembling in a fear that was grievous to see. then legolas laid his hands on his eyes and sang some words that went soft in the gloom, until he suffered himself to be led, and legolas passed in. and there stood gimli the dwarf left all alone.
his knees shook, and he was wroth with himself. â€˜here is a thing unheard of!â€™ he said. â€˜an elf will go underground and a dwarf dare not!â€™ with that he plunged in. but it seemed to him that he dragged his feet like lead over the threshold; and at once a blindness came upon him, even upon gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son who had walked unafraid in many deep places of the world.
aragorn had brought torches from dunharrow, and now he went ahead bearing one aloft; and elladan w

nothing assailed the company nor withstood their passage, and yet steadily fear grew on the dwarf as he went on: most of all because he knew now that there could be no turning back; all the paths behind were thronged by an unseen host that followed in the

so time unreckoned passed, until gimli saw a sight that he was ever afterwards loth to recall. the road was wide, as far as he could judge, but now the company came suddenly into a great empty space, and there were no longer any walls upon either side. the dread was so heavy on him that he could hardly walk. away to the left something glittered in the gloom as aragornâ€™s torch drew near. then aragorn halted and went to look what it might be.
â€˜does he feel no fear?â€™ muttered the dwarf. â€˜in any other cave gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son w

â€˜for that is not my errand!â€™ he cried, turning back and speaking to the whispering darkness behind. â€˜keep your hoards and your secrets hidden in the accursed years! speed only we ask. let us pass, and then come! i summon you to the stone of erech!â€™
there was no answer, unless it were an utter silence more dreadful than the whispers before; and then a chill blast came in which the torches flickered and went out, and could not be rekindled. of the time that followed, one hour or many, gimli remembered little. the others pressed on, but he was ever hindmost, pursued by a groping horror that seemed always just about to seize him; and a rumour came after him like the shadow-sound of many feet. he stumbled on until he was crawling like a beast on the ground and felt that he could endure no more: he must either find an ending and escape or run back in madness to meet the following fear.
suddenly he heard the tinkle of water, a sound hard and clear as a stone falling into a dream of dar

the company now mounted again, and gimli returned to legolas. they rode in file, and evening came on and a deep blue dusk; and still fear pursued them. legolas turning to speak to gimli looked back and the dwarf saw before his face the glitter in the elfâ€™s bright eyes. behind them rod

â€˜yes, the dead ride behind. they have been summoned,â€™ said elladan.
the company came at last out of the ravine, as suddenly as it they had issued from a crack in a wall; and there lay the uplands of a great vale before them, and the stream beside them went down with a cold voice over many falls.
â€˜where in middle-earth are we?â€™ said gimli; and elladan answered: â€˜we have descended from the uprising of the morthond, the long chill river that flows at last to the sea that washes the walls of dol amroth. you will not need to ask hereafter how comes its name: blackroot men call it.â€™
the morthond vale made a great bay that beat up against the sheer southern faces of the mountains. its steep slopes were grass-grown; but all was grey in that hour, for the sun had gone, and far below lights twinkled in the homes of men. the vale was

d not a whisper nor a sigh was heard again all the long night. the company camped beside the stone, but they slept little, because of the dread of the shadows that hedged them round.
but when the dawn came, cold and pale, aragorn rose at once, and he led the company forth upon the journey of greatest haste and weariness that any among them had known, save he alone, and only his will held them to go on. no other mortal men could have endured it, none but the dÃºnedain of the north, and with them gimli the dwarf and legolas of the elves.
they passed tarlangâ€™s neck and came into lamedon; and the shadow host pressed behind and fear went on before them, until they came to calembel upon ciril, and the sun went down like blood behind pinnath gelin away in the west behind them. the township and the fords of ciril they found deserted, for many men had gone away to war, and all that were left fled to the hills at the rumour of the coming of the king of the dead. but the next day there came no dawn,

s a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire, yet he could not piece the words together. at times some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.
all the same he had been lonely, and never more so than now at the dayâ€™s end. he wondered where in all this strange world pippin had got to; and what would become of aragorn and legolas and gimli. then suddenly like a cold touch on his heart he thought of frodo and sam. â€˜i am forgetting them!â€™ he said to himself reproachfully. â€˜and yet they are more important than all the rest of us. and i came to help them; but now they must be hundreds of miles away, if they are still alive.â€™ he shivered.

seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars, but the east was dark and blank. the marching stones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of the dwimorberg.
â€˜the paths of the dead,â€™ he muttered to himself. â€˜the paths of the dead? what does all this mean? they have all left me now. they have all gone to some doom: gandalf and pippin to war in the east; and sam and frodo to mordor; and strider and legolas and gimli to the paths of the dead. but my turn will come soon enough, i suppose. i wonder what they are all talking about, and what the king means to do. for i must go where he goes now.â€™
in the midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. but at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the kingâ€™s esquire, to wait at the kingâ€™s board.

now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of the kingâ€™s guard and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and other gear.
â€˜no mail have we to fit you,â€™ said Ã©owyn, â€˜nor any time for the forging of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a knife. a sword you have.â€™
merry bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like the shield that had been given to gimli, and it bore on it the device of the white horse. â€˜take all these things,â€™ she said, â€˜and bear them to good fortune! farewell now, master meriadoc! yet maybe we shall meet again, you and i.â€™
so it was that amid a gathering gloom the king of the mark made ready to lead all his riders on the eastward road. hearts were heavy and many quailed in the shadow. but they were a stern people, loyal to their lord, and little weeping or murmuring was heard, even in the camp in the hold where the ex

east rode the knights of dol amroth driving the enemy before them: troll-men and variags and orcs that hated the sunlight. south strode Ã©omer and men fled before his face, and they were caught between the hammer and the anvil. for now men leaped from the ships to the quays of the harlond and swept north like a storm. there came legolas, and gimli wielding his axe, and halbarad with the standard, and elladan and elrohir with stars on their brow, and the dour-handed dÃºnedain, rangers of the north, leading a great valour of the folk of lebennin and lamedon and the fiefs of the south. but before all went aragorn with the flame of the west, andÃºril like a new fire kindled, narsil re-forged as deadly as of old: and upon his brow was the star of elendil.
and so at length Ã©omer and aragorn met in the midst of the battle, and they leaned on t

and when he could labour no more, he cast his cloak about him, and slipped out of the city, and went to his tent just ere dawn and slept for a little. and in the morning the banner of dol amroth, a white ship like a swan upon blue water, floated from the tower, and men looked up and wondered if the coming of the king had been but a dream.

chapter 9

the last debate

the morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward. legolas and gimli were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the city; for they were eager to see merry and pippin.
â€˜it is good to learn that they are still alive,â€™ said gimli; â€˜for they cost us great pains in our march over rohan, and i would not have such pains all wasted.â€™
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he

walked in the morning; but gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him.
â€˜there is some good stone-work here,â€™ he said as he looked at the walls; â€˜but also some that is less good, and the streets could be better contrived. when aragorn comes into his own, i shall offer him the service of stonewrights of the mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of.â€™
â€˜they need more gardens,â€™ said legolas. â€˜the houses are dead, and there is too little here that grows and is glad. if aragorn comes

â€˜we will come,â€™ said imrahil; and they parted with courteous words.
â€˜that is a fair lord and a great captain of men,â€™ said legolas. â€˜if gondor has such men still in these days of fading, great must have been its glory in the days of its rising.â€™
â€˜and doubtless the good stone-work is the older and was wrought in the first building,â€™ said gimli. â€˜it is ever so with the things that men begin: there is a frost in spring, or a blight in summer, and they fail of their promise.â€™
â€˜yet seldom do they fail of their seed,â€™ said legolas. â€˜and that will lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for. the deeds of men will outlast us, gimli.â€™

rouble to my heart. never in all my life had i met them, until we came to pelargir, and there i heard them crying in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships. then i stood still, forgetting war in middle-earth; for their wailing voices spoke to me of the sea. the sea! alas! i have not yet beheld it. but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. alas! for the gulls. no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm.â€™
â€˜say not so!â€™ said gimli. â€˜there are countless things still to see in middle-earth, and great works to do. but if all the fair folk take to the havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.â€™
â€˜dull and dreary indeed!â€™ said merry: â€˜you must not go to the havens, legolas. there will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise dwarves like gimli, who need you. at least i hope so. though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come. how i wish it was all over, and we

â€˜donâ€™t be so gloomy!â€™ cried pippin. â€˜the sun is shining, and here we are together for a day or two at least. i want to hear more about you all. come, gimli! you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with strider about a dozen times already this morning. but you havenâ€™t told me anything about it.â€™
â€˜the sun may shine here,â€™ said gimli, â€˜but there are memories of that road that i do not wish to recall out of the darkness. had i known what was before me, i think that not for any friendship would i have taken the paths of the dead.â€™
â€˜the paths of the dead?â€™ said pippin. â€˜i heard aragorn say that and i wondered what he could mean. wonâ€™t you tell us some more?â€™
â€˜not willingly,â€™ said gimli. â€˜for upon that road i was put to shame: gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son, who had deemed himself more tough than men, and hardier unde

â€˜and by the love of him also,â€™ said legolas. â€˜for all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the rohirrim. it was at early morn of the day ere you came there, merry, that we left dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the lady Ã©owyn, who lies now hurt in the house below. there was grief at that parting, and i was grieved to behold it.â€™
â€˜alas! i had heart only for myself,â€™ said gimli. â€˜nay! i will not speak of that journey.â€™
he fell silent; but pippin and merry were so eager for news that at last legolas said: â€˜i will tell you enough for your peace; for i felt not the horror, and i feared not the shadows of men, powerless and frail as i deemed them.â€™
swiftly then he told of the haunted road under the mountains, and the dark tryst at erech, and the great ride thence, ninety leagues and three, to pelargir on anduin. â€˜four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rod

 blackness before us. and over the wide land, trampling unheeded the grass and the flowers, we hunted our foes through a day and a night, until we came at the bitter end to the great river at last.
â€˜then i thought in my heart that we drew near to the sea; for wide was the water in the darkness, and sea-birds innumerable cried on its, shores. alas for the wailing of the gulls! did not the lady tell me to beware of them? and now i cannot forget them.â€™
â€˜for my part i heeded them not,â€™ said gimli; â€˜for we came then at last upon battle in earnest. there at pelargir lay the main fleet of umbar, fifty great ships and smaller vessels beyond count. many of those that we pursued had reached the havens before us, and brought their fear with them; and some of the ships had put off, seeking to escape down the river or to reach the far shore; and many of the smaller craft were ablaze. but the haradrim, being now driven to the brink, turned at bay, and they were fierce in despair; and they laugh

ons was it worsted!â€™
â€˜strange indeed,â€™ said legolas. â€˜in that hour i looked on aragorn and thought how great and terrible a lord he might have become in the strength of his will, had he taken the ring to himself. not for naught does mordor fear him. but nobler is his spirit than the understanding of sauron; for is he not of the children of lÃºthien? never shall that line fail, though the years may lengthen beyond count.â€™
â€˜beyond the eyes of the dwarves are such foretellings,â€™ said gimli. â€˜but mighty indeed was aragorn that day. lo! all the black fleet was in his hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it. then he let sound a great concourse of trumpets taken from the enemy; and the shadow host withdrew to the shore. there they stood silent, hardly to be seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were burning. and aragorn spoke in a loud voice to the dead men, crying:

ws. and so it was, as you know, that we came in the third hour of the morning with a fair wind and the sun unveiled, and we unfurled the great standard in battle. it was a great day and a great hour, whatever may come after.â€™
â€˜follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,â€™ said legolas. â€˜great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead, and great it shall remain, though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come.â€™
â€˜and that may well befall,â€™ said gimli. â€˜for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave. much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below. for my part, like merry, i wish that with our victory the war was now over. yet whatever is still to do, i hope to have a part in it, for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain.â€™
â€˜and i for the folk of the great wood,â€™ said legolas, â€˜and for the love of the lord of the white tree.â€™
then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place

, each busy with his own thoughts, while the captains debated.
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli, at once he sent for Ã©omer; and he went down with him from the city, and they came to the tents of aragorn that were set up on the field not far from the place where king thÃ©oden had fallen. and there they took counsel together with gandalf and aragorn and the sons of elrond.
â€˜my lords,â€™ said gandalf, â€˜listen to the words of the steward of gondor before he died: you may triumph on the fields of the pelennor for a day, but against the power that has now arisen there is no victory. i do n

er; and with this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already come to the harlond. i judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse and foot, and yet leave the city in better defence than it was when the assault began.â€™
â€˜the gate is destroyed,â€™ said imrahil, â€˜and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?â€™
â€˜in erebor in the kingdom of dÃ¡in there is such skill,â€™ said aragorn; â€˜and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time i will send gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son to ask for wrights of the mountain. but men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our enemy if men desert it.â€™
this then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the south;

 army of the west was all assembled on the pelennor. the host of orcs and easterlings had turned back out of anÃ³rien, but harried and scattered by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be. scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross-roads of the fallen king. all now was ready for the last throw.
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the company of aragorn and gandalf, who went in the van with the dÃºnedain and the sons of elrond. but merry to his shame was not to go with them.
â€˜you are not fit for such a journey,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜but do not be ashamed. if you do no more in this war, you have already earned great honour. peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk; and do not grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match y

y as could best be contrived; and they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of labour. before them towards mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. when all was ordered, the captains rode forth towards the black gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. there was gandalf as chief herald, and aragorn with the sons of elrond, and Ã©omer of rohan, and imrahil; and legolas and gimli and peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of mordor should have a witness.
they came within cry of the morannon, and unfurled the banner, and blew upon their trumpets; and the heralds stood out and sent their voices up over the battlement of mordor.
â€˜come forth!â€™ they cried. â€˜let the lord of the black land come forth! justice shall be done upon him. for wrongfully he has made war upon gondor and wrested its lands. therefore the king of gondor demands that he should aton

â€˜no, master! mr. bilbo gave it to you, and it goes with his silver coat; he would not wish anyone else to wear it now.â€™
frodo gave way; and gandalf, as if he were their esquire, knelt and girt the sword-belts about them, and then rising he set circlets of silver upon their heads. and when they were arrayed they went to the great feast; and they sat at the kingâ€™s table with gandalf, and king Ã©omer of rohan, and the prince imrahil and all the chief captains; and there also were gimli and legolas.
but when, after the standing silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the guards of minas tirith, and the other in white and green. but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men. then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:

at last the glad day ended; and when the sun was gone and the round moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf, and after a while legolas and gimli joined them. there frodo and sam learned much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.
orcs, and talking trees, and leagues of grass, and galloping riders. and glittering caves, and white towers and golden halls, and battles, and tall ships sailing, all these passed before samâ€™s mind until he felt bewildered. but amidst all these wonders he returned always

to his astonishment at the size of merry and pippin; and he made them stand back to back with frodo and himself. he scratched his head. â€˜canâ€™t understand it at your age!â€™ he said. â€˜but there it is: youâ€™re three inches taller than you ought to he, or iâ€™m a dwarf.â€™
â€˜that you certainly are not,â€™ said gimli. â€˜but what did i say? mortals cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer.â€™
â€˜ent-draughts?â€™ said sam. â€˜there you go about ents again; but what they are beats me. why, it will take weeks before we get all these things sized up!â€™
â€˜weeks indeed,â€™ said pippin. â€˜and then frodo will have to be locked up in a tower in minas tirith and write it all down. otherwise he will forget half of it, and poor old bilbo will be dreadfully disappointed

at length gandalf rose. â€˜the hands of the king are hands of healing, dear friends,â€™ he said. â€˜but you went to the very brink of death ere he recalled you, putting forth all his power, and sent you into the sweet forgetfulness of sleep. and though you have indeed slept long and blessedly, still it is now time to sleep again.â€™
and not only sam and frodo here, said gimli, but you too, pippin. i love you, if only because of the pains you have cost me, which i shall never forget. nor shall i forget finding you on the hill of the last battle. but for gimli the dwarf you would have been lost then. but at least i know now the look of a hobbitâ€™s foot, though it be all that can be seen under a heap of bodies. and when i heaved that great carcase off you, i made sure you were dead. i could have. torn out my beard. and it is only a day yet since you were first up and

the riders of rohan made ready, and rode off by the north-way, and with them went the sons of elrond. all the road was lined with people to do them honour and praise them, from the gate of the city to the walls of the pelennor. then all others that dwelt afar went back to their homes rejoicing; but in the city there was labour of many willing hands to rebuild and renew and to remove all the scars of war and the memory of the darkness.
the hobbits still remained in minas tirith, with legolas and gimli; for aragorn was loth for the fellowship to be dissolved. â€˜at last all such things must end,â€™ he said, â€˜but i would have you wait a little while longer: for the end of the deeds that you have shared in has not yet come. a day draws near that i have looked for in all the years of my manhood, and when it comes i would have my friends beside me.â€™ but of that day he would say no more.
in those days the companions of the ring dwelt together in a fair house with gandalf, and they went to and

he set the chain about frodoâ€™s neck. â€˜when the memory of the fear and the darkness troubles you,â€™ she said, â€˜this will bring you aid.â€™
in three days, as the king had said, Ã©omer of rohan came riding to the city, and with him came an Ã©ored of the fairest knights of the mark. he was welcomed; and when they sat all at table in merethrond, the great hall of feasts, he beheld the beauty of the ladies that he saw and was filled with great wonder. and before he went to his rest he sent for gimli the dwarf, and he said to him: â€˜gimli glÃ³inâ€™s son, have you your axe ready?â€™
â€˜nay, lord,â€™ said gimli, â€˜but i can speedily fetch it, if there be need.â€™
â€˜you shall judge,â€™ said Ã©omer. â€˜for there are certain rash words concerning the lady in the golden wood that lie still between us. and now i have seen her with my eyes.â€™
â€˜well, lord,â€™ said gimli, â€˜and what say you now?â€™
â€˜alas!â€™ said Ã©omer. â€˜i will not say that she is the fairest lady that lives.â€™
â€˜then i

 must go for my axe,â€™ said gimli.
â€˜but first i will plead this excuse,â€™ said Ã©omer. â€˜had i seen her in other company, i would have said all that you could wish. but now i will put queen arwen evenstar first, and i am ready to do battle on my own part with any who deny me. shall i call for my sword?â€™
then gimli bowed low. â€˜nay, you are excused for my part, lord,â€™ he said. â€˜you have chosen the evening; but my love is given to the morning. and my heart forebodes that soon it will past away for ever.â€™
at last the day of departure came, and a great and fair company made ready to ride north from the city. then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath dÃ­nen, and they bore away king thÃ©oden upon a golden bier, and passed through the city in silence. then

they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and merry being thÃ©odenâ€™s esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king.
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragornâ€™s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with thÃ©oden thengelâ€™s son to the land of his home.
without haste and at peace they passed into anÃ³rien, and they came to the grey wood under amon din; and there they heard a sound as of drums beating in the hil

then merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed Ã©owynâ€™s hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time.
now the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and with great praise and friendship they departed, and came at length to helmâ€™s deep, and there they rested two days. then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went with him to the glittering caves; and when they returned he was silent, and would say only that gimli alone could find fit words to speak of them. â€˜and never before has a dwarf claimed a victory over an elf in a contest of words,â€™ said he. â€˜now therefore let us go to fangorn and set the score right!â€™
from deeping-coomb they rode to isengard, and saw how the ents had busied themselves. all the stone-circle had been thrown down and removed, and the land within was made into a gar

but treebeard shook his head and said: â€˜it is far to go. and there are too many men there in these days. but i am forgetting my manners! will you stay here and rest a while? and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so shorten their road home?â€™ he looked at celeborn and galadriel.
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart, either south or west. â€˜come, gimli!â€™ said legolas. â€˜now by fangornâ€™s leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in middle-earth. you shall come with me and keep your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond.â€™ to this gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.
â€˜here then at last comes the ending of the fellowship of the ring,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜yet i hope that ere long you will return to my land with the help

 that you promised.â€™
â€˜we will come, if our own lords allow it,â€™ said gimli. â€˜well, farewell. my hobbits! you should come safe to your own homes now, and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril. we will send word when we may, and some of us may yet meet at times; but i fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever again.â€™
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed three times slowly and with great reverence to celeborn and galadriel. â€˜it is long, long since we met by stock or by stone, a vanimar, vanimÃ¡lion nostari!â€™ he
