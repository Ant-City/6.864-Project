from licorice whips, whined out of their father in town. ruthie, dressed in a 
real dress of pink muslin that came below her knees, was a little serious in her young-
ladiness. but winfield was still a trifle of a snot-nose, a little of a brooder back of the 
barn, and an inveterate collector and smoker of snipes. and whereas ruthie felt the 
might, the responsibility, and the dignity of her developing breasts, winfield was kid-
wild and calfish. beside them, clinging lightly to the bars, stood rose of sharon, and 
she balanced, swaying on the balls of her feet, and took up the road shock in her knees 
and  hams.  for  rose  of  sharon  was  pregnant  and  careful.  her  hair,  braided  and 
wrapped around her head, made an ash-blond crown. her round soft face, which had 
been  voluptuous  and  inviting  a  few  months  ago,  had  already  put  on  the  barrier  of 
pregnancy,  the  self-sufficient  smile,  the  knowing  perfection-look;  and  her  plump

ow, for the baby's sake. and the world was pregnant to her; 
she thought only in terms of reproduction and of motherhood. connie, her nineteen-
year-old husband, who had married a plump, passionate hoyden, was still frightened 
and bewildered at the change in her; for there were no more cat fights in bed, biting 
and  scratching  with  muffled  giggles  and  final  tears.  there  was  a  balanced,  careful, 
wise creature who smiled shyly but very firmly at him. connie was proud and fearful 
of rose of sharon. whenever he could, he put a hand on her or stood close, so that his 
body touched her at hip and shoulder, and he felt that this kept a relation that might be 
departing. he was a sharp-faced, lean young man of a texas strain, and his pale blue 
eyes were sometimes dangerous and sometimes kindly, and sometimes frightened. he 
was a good hard worker and would make a good husband. he drank enough, but not 
too much; fought when it was required of him; and never boasted. he sat quietly in a

had he not been fifty years old, and so one of the natural rulers of the family, uncle 
john would have preferred not to sit in the honor place beside the driver. he would 
have liked rose of sharon to sit there. this was impossible, because she was young 
and a woman. but uncle john sat uneasily, his lonely haunted eyes were not at ease, 
and his thin strong body was not relaxed. nearly all the time the barrier of loneliness 
cut uncle john off from people and from appetites. he ate little, drank nothing, and 
was  celibate.  but  underneath,  his  appetites  swelled  into  pressures  until  they  broke 
through. then he would eat of some craved food until he was sick; or he would drink

said, "this is connie, my husband." and she was grand, saying it. 

the two shook hands, sizing each other up, looking deeply into each other; and in a 

moment each was satisfied, and tom said, "well, i see you been busy." 

she looked down. "you do not see, not yet." 
"pa tol' me. when's it gonna be?" 
"oh, not for a long time! not till nex' winter." 
tom  laughed.  "gonna  get  'im  bore  in  a  orange  ranch,  huh?  in  one  a  them  white 

houses with orange trees all aroun'." 

rose of sharon felt her stomach with both her hands. "you do not see," she said, 
and she smiled her complacent smile and went into the house. the evening was hot, 
and the thrust of light still flowed up from the western horizon. and without any signal 
the family gathered by the truck, and the congress, the family government, went into 
session. 

the  film  of  evening  light  made  the  red  earth  lucent,  so  that  its  dimensions  were 
deepened, so that a stone, a post, a building had greater depth an

kitchen became a swamp of heat, and the family ate hurriedly, and went out to sit on 
the  doorstep  until  the  water  should  get  hot.  they  sat  looking  out  at  the  dark,  at  the 
square  of  light  the  kitchen  lantern  threw  on  the  ground  outside  the  door,  with  a 
hunched shadow of grampa in the middle of it. noah picked his teeth thoroughly with 
a broom straw. ma and rose of sharon washed up the dishes and piled them on the 
table. 

and  then,  all  of  a  sudden,  the  family  began  to  function.  pa  got  up  and  lighted 
another  lantern.  noah  from  a  box  in  the  kitchen,  brought  out  the  bow-bladed 
butchering knife and whetted it on a worn little carborundum stone. and he laid the 
scraper on the chopping block, and the knife beside it. pa brought two sturdy sticks, 
each three feet long, and pointed the ends with the ax, and he tied strong ropes, double

carcasses into the black pool on the ground. pa got up and went to the pigs and felt 
them with his hand, and then he sat down again. granma and grampa went toward the 
barn to sleep, and grampa carried a candle lantern in his hand. the rest of the family 

sat quietly about the doorstep, connie and al and tom on the ground, leaning their 
backs against the house wall, uncle john on a box. pa in the doorway. only ma and 
rose of sharon continued to move about. ruthie and winfield were sleepy now, but 
fighting  it  off.  they  quarreled  sleepily  out  in  the  darkness,  noah  and  the  preacher 
squatted side by side, facing the house. pa scratched himself nervously, and took off 
his hat and ran his fingers through his hair. "tomorra we'll get that pork salted early in 
the morning, an' then we'll get the truck loaded, all but the beds, an' nex' morning off 
we'll go. hardly is a day's work in all that," he said uneasily.

noah cut up the side-meat and he cut up the legs. ma kept her fire going, and as noah 
cleaned the ribs and the spines and leg bones of all the meat he could, she put them in 
the oven to roast for gnawing purposes. 

in the yard and in the barn the circles of lantern light moved about, and the men 
brought together all the things to be taken, and piled them by the truck. rose of sharon 
brought out all the clothes the family possessed: the overalls, the thick-soled shoes, the 
rubber boots, the worn best suits, the sweaters and sheepskin coats. and she packed 
these tightly into a wooden box and got into the box and tramped them down. and then 
she  brought  out  the  print  dresses  and  shawls,  the  black  cotton  stockings  and  the 
children's  clothes—small  overalls  and  cheap  print  dresses—and  she  put  these  in  the 
box and tramped them down.

on top of the truck the others stirred to life. their faces were shining with sunburn 
they could not escape. tom and casy and noah and uncle john let themselves wearily 
down.  ruthie  and  winfield  swarmed  down  the  side-boards  and  went  off  into  the 
bushes. connie helped rose of sharon gently down. under the canvas, grampa was 
awake, his head sticking out, but his eyes were drugged and watery and still senseless. 
he watched the others, but there was little recognition in his watching. 

tom called to him, "want to come down, grampa?" 
the  old  eyes  turned  listlessly  to  him.  "no,"  said  grampa.  for  a  moment  the 
fierceness came into his eyes. "i ain't a-goin', i tell you. gonna stay like muley." and

the  fat  man  stared  hopelessly  straight  ahead.  his  hand  started  turning  the  crank 

slowly. "i dunno what we're comin' to," he said softly. 

over by the water hose, connie and rose of sharon stood together, talking secretly. 
connie washed the tin cup and felt the water with his finger before he filled the cup 
again. rose of sharon watched the cars go by on the highway. connie held out the cup 
to her. "this water ain't cool, but it's wet," he said. 

she looked at him and smiled secretly. she was all secrets now she was pregnant, 
secrets and little silences that seemed to have meanings. she was pleased with herself, 
and she complained about things that didn't really matter. and

the  dog  wandered,  sniffing,  past  the  truck,  trotted  to  the  puddle  under  the  hose 
again and lapped at the muddy water. and then he moved away, nose down and ears 
hanging. he sniffed his way among the dusty weeds beside the road, to the edge of the 
pavement. he raised his head and looked across, and then started over. rose of sharon 

screamed  shrilly.  a  big  swift  car  whisked  near,  tires  squealed.  the  dog  dodged 
helplessly, and with a shriek, cut off in the middle, went under the wheels. the big car 
slowed for a moment and faces looked back, and then it gathered greater speed and 
disappeared. and the dog, a blot of blood and tangled, burst intestines, kicked slowly 
in the road.

the fat man came from behind the truck. "i'm sorry, folks," he said. "a dog jus' don'

more." and he said, "don't you folks worry none about it. i'll take care of 'im. bury 'im

ma walked over to rose of sharon, where she sat, still shuddering, on the running 

board. "you all right, rosasharn?" she asked. "you feelin' poorly?" 

"i seen that. give me a start."

granma grinned. "it's nice in there," she said. "they got a patent toilet in there an' 
the water comes down. i like it in there," she said contentedly. "would of took a good 
nap if i wasn't woke up." 

"it ain't a nice place to sleep," said rose of sharon, and she helped granma into the 
car.  granma  settled  herself  happily.  "maybe  it  ain't  nice  for  purty,  but  it's  nice  for

tom said, "le's go. we got to make miles." 
pa  whistled  shrilly.  "now  where'd  them  kids  go?"  he  whistled  again,  putting  his 

fingers in his mouth.

ruthie  and  winfield  saw  it  all,  and  it  embarrassed  them  with  its  bigness  and  its 
strangeness, and it frightened them with the fine-clothed people they saw. they did not 
speak of it to each other. later—they would, but not now. they saw the oil derricks in 
the town, on the edge of the town; oil derricks black, and the smell of oil and gas in the 
air. but they didn't exclaim. it was so big and so strange it frightened them. 

in the street rose of sharon saw a man in a light suit. he wore white shoes and a 
flat  straw  hat.  she  touched  connie  and  indicated  the  man  with  her  eyes,  and  then 
connie and rose of sharon giggled softly to themselves, and the giggles got the best of 
them. they covered their mouths. and it felt so good that they looked for other people

steam poured out under the lids. rose of sharon knelt on the ground out of range of the 
burning heat, and she had a long spoon in her hand. she saw ma come out of the tent,

and  foreheads  showed  in  the  firelight.  above  the  little  dome  of  the  firelight  the 
summer stars shone thinly, and the heat of the day was gradually withdrawing. on her 
mattress, away from the fire, granma whimpered softly like a puppy. the heads of all 
turned in her direction. 

ma  said,  "rosasharn,  like  a  good  girl  go  lay  down  with  granma.  she  needs

woman,  and  the  murmur  of  their  soft  voices  drifted  to  the  fire.  rose  of  sharon  and 
granma whispered together on the mattress.

texas. the land turtles crawled through the dust and the sun whipped the earth, and in 
the evening the heat went out of the sky and the earth sent up a wave of heat from 
itself. 

two days the families were in flight, but on the third the land was too huge for them 
and they settled into a new technique of living; the highway became their home and 
movement their medium of expression. little by little they settled into the new life.

distance, waved up against the sky, the mountains stood. and the wheels of the cars

under the spread tarpaulin granma lay on a mattress, and ma sat beside her. 
the air was stiflingly hot, and the flies buzzed in the shade of the canvas. granma was 
naked under a long piece of pink curtain. she turned her old head restlessly from side 
to  side,  and  she  muttered  and  choked.  ma  sat  on  the  ground  beside  her,  and  with  a 
piece of cardboard drove the flies away and fanned a stream of moving hot air over the 
tight old face. rose of sharon sat on the other side and watched her mother. 

granma  called  imperiously,  "will!  will!  you  come  here,  will."  and  her  eyes 
opened  and  she  looked  fiercely  about.  "tol'  him  to  come  right  here,"  she  said.  "i'll 
catch him. i'll take the hair off'n him." she closed her eyes and rolled her head back 
and forth and muttered thickly. ma fanned with the cardboard.

you so you'd know, but i can't." and her voice was so soft, so full of love, that tears 
crowded into rose of sharon's eyes, and flowed over her eyes and blinded her. 

"take  an'  fan  granma,"  ma  said,  and  she  handed  the  cardboard  to  her  daughter. 

"that's a good thing to do. i wisht i could tell you so you'd know."

words parched in her throat. 

"wipe your feet, will—you dirty pig!" granma cried. 
ma said, "i dunno. maybe if we can get her where it ain't so hot, but i dunno. don't 
worry yourself, rosasharn. take your breath in when you need it, an' let go when you 
need to." 

a large woman in a torn black dress looked into the tent. her eyes were bleared and 
indefinite, and the skin sagged to her jowls and hung down in little flaps. he

away 'thout a little praisin'. we'll git the meetin' goin' in our own tent, ma'am. an' we'll 
forgive ya for your hard heart." 

ma settled back again and turned her face to granma, and her face was still set and 
hard. "she's tar'd," ma said. "she's on'y tar'd." granma swung her head back and forth 
and muttered under her breath. 

the woman walked stiffly out of the tent. ma continued to look down at the old 

face. 

"ma!" 

rose of sharon fanned her cardboard and moved the hot air in a stream. she said, 

"yeah?" 
"whyn't ya let 'em hol' a meetin'?"

from some little distance there came the sound of the beginning meeting, a sing-
song chant of exhortation. the words were not clear, only the tone. the voice rose and 
fell,  and  went  higher  at  e

d  into  the 
responses came a complaining note. the rhythm quickened. male and female voices 
had been one tone, but now in the middle of a response one woman's voice went up 
and up in a wailing cry, wild and fierce, like the cry of a beast; and a deeper woman's 
voice rose up beside it, a baying voice, and a man's voice traveled up the scale in the 
howl of a wolf. the exhortation stopped, and only the feral howling came from the 
tent, and with it a thudding sound on the earth. ma shivered. rose of sharon's breath 
was panting and short, and the chorus of howls went on so long it seemed that lungs 
must burst. 

ma said, "makes me nervous. somepin happened to me." 
now  the  high  voice  broke  into  hysteria,  the  gabbling  screams  of  a  hyena,  the 
thudding became louder. voices cracked and broke, and then the whole chorus fell to a 
sobbing, grunting undertone, and the slap of flesh and the thuddings on the earth; and 
the sobbing changed to a little whining, like that of a litter of pupp

se  of  sharon  cried  softly  with  nervousness.  granma  kicked  the  curtain  off  her 
legs, which lay like gray, knotted sticks. and granma whined with the whining in the 
distance. ma pulled the curtain back in place. and then granma sighed deeply and her 
breathing grew steady and easy, and her closed eyelids ceased their flicking. she slept 
deeply, and snored through her half-open mouth. the whining from the distance was 
softer and softer until it could not be heard at all any more. 

rose of sharon looked at ma, and her eyes were blank with tears. "it done good," 

said rose of sharon. "it done granma good. she's a-sleepin'."

rose of sharon asked, "how about fannin' granma?" 
"she's asleep now. you lay down an' rest." 
"i wonder where at connie is?" the girl complained. "i ain't seen him around for a 

long time." 

ma said, "sh! get some rest." 
"ma, connie gonna study nights an' get to be somepin." 
"yeah. you tol' me about that. get some rest." 
the girl lay down on the edge of granma's mattress. "connie's got a new plan. he's

rose of sharon closed her eyes. ma turned over on her back and crossed her hands 
under  her  head.  she  listened  to  granma's  breathing  and  to  the  girl's  breathing.  she 
moved a hand to start a fly from her forehead. the camp was quiet in the blinding heat, 
but the noises of hot grass—of crickets, the hum of flies—were a tone that was close to 
silence. ma sighed deeply and then yawned and closed her eyes. in her half-sleep she 
heard footsteps approaching, but it was a man's voice that started

"yeah, okies! an' if you're here when i come tomorra, i'll run ya in." he turned and 
walked to the next tent and banged on the canvas with his hand. "who's in here?" he 
said. 

ma went slowly back under the tarpaulin. she put the skillet in the utensil box. she 
sat down slowly. rose of sharon watched her secretly. and when she saw ma fighting

awakened under his willow, and his mouth was parched and his body was wet with 
sweat, and his head was dissatisfied with his rest. he staggered to his feet and walked 
toward  the  water.  he  peeled  off  his  clothes  and  waded  into  the  stream.  and  the

don' get 'em, somebody else will." wilson, his head still down, turned and went to his 
tent; he stepped inside and the flaps fell behind him. 

for a few moments the family waited, and then, "we got to go," said tom. "it's near 

four, i bet." 

the family climbed on the truck, ma on top, beside granma. tom and al and pa in 
the seat, and winfield on pa's lap. connie and rose of sharon made a nest against the 
cab. the preacher and uncle john and ruthie were in a tangle on the load. 

pa called, "good-by, mister and mis' wilson." there was no answer from the tent. 
tom  started  the  engine  and  the  truck  lumbered  away.  and  as  they  crawled  up  the 
rough road toward needles and the highway, ma looked back. wilson stood in front of 
his tent, staring after them, and his hat was in his hand. the sun fell full on his face.

"i didn' want to. it wasn't so nice as here. couldn' lie down." 
"well, don' you bother me, a-squawkin' an' a-talkin'," ruthie said, "'cause i'm goin' 
to sleep, an' when i wake up, we gonna be there! 'cause tom said so! gonna seem 
funny to see pretty country." 

the sun went down and left a great halo in the sky. and it grew very dark under the 

tarpaulin, a long cave with light at each end—a flat triangle of light. 

connie and rose of sharon leaned back against the cab, and the hot wind tumbling 
through  the  tent  struck  the  backs  of  their  heads,  and  the  tarpaulin  whipped  and 
drummed  above  them.  they  spoke  together  in  low  tones,  pitched  to  the  drumming 
canvas, so that no one could hear them. when connie spoke he turned his head and 
spoke into her ear, and she did the same to him. she said, "seems like we wasn't never

awestruck, embarrassed before the great valley. the distance was thinned with haze, 
and the land grew softer and softer in the distance. a windmill flashed in the sun, and 

its turning blades were like a little heliograph, far away. ruthie and winfield looked at 
it, and ruthie whispered, "it's california." 

winfield moved his lips silently over the syllables. "there's fruit," he said aloud. 
casy and uncle john, connie and rose of sharon climbed down. and they stood 
silently. rose of sharon had started to brush her hair back, when she caught sight of 
the valley and her hand dropped slowly to her side. 

tom said, "where's ma? i want ma to see it. look, ma! come here, ma." ma was 
climbing slowly, stiffly, down the back board. tom looked at her. "my god, ma, you 
sick?" her face was stiff and putty-like, and her eyes seemed to have sunk deep into 
her head, and the rims were red with weariness. her feet touched the ground and

away from the body as they could get, stared at the tucked figure. 

and ruthie whispered, "tha's granma, an' she's dead." 
winfield nodded solemnly. "she ain't breathin' at all. she's awful dead." 
and rose of sharon said softly to connie, "she was a-dyin' right when we—" 
"how'd we know?" he reassured her. 
al climbed on the load to make room for ma in the seat. and al swaggered a little 
because he was sorry. he plumped down beside casy and uncle john. "well, she was

the  family  on  top of the load, the children and connie and rose of sharon 
and  the  preacher  were  stiff  and  cramped.  they  had  sat  in  the  heat  in  front  of  the 
coroner's office in bakersfield while pa and ma and uncle john went in. then a basket 
was brought out and the long bundle lifted down from the truck. and they sat in the 
sun  while  the  examination  went  on,  while  the  cause  of  death  was  found  and  the 
certificate signed.

tom  said,  "when  a  bunch  of  folks,  nice  quiet  folks,  don't  know  nothin'  about 

nothin'—somepin's goin' on." 

"i'll stay," said casy. 
"an' tomorra we'll go out in the truck an' look for work." 
"yeah!" said casy, and he waved his toes up and down and studied them gravely. 
tom settled back on his elbow and closed his eyes. inside the tent he could hear the 
murmur of rose of sharon's voice and connie's answering. 

the tarpaulin made a dark shadow and the wedge-shaped light at each end was hard 
and sharp. rose of sharon lay on a mattress and connie squatted beside her. "i oughta 
help ma," rose of sharon said. "i tried, but ever' time i stirred about i throwed up." 

connie's eyes were sullen. "if i'd of knowed it would be like this i wouldn' of came.

"well, don' tell 'em. go down the river an' stick your head under an' whisper 'em in

pa nodded his head slowly at ma's words. "she's right," he said. "it gives a fella 

relief to tell, but it jus' spreads out his sin." 

uncle john looked up to the sun-gold mountains, and the mountains were reflected 
in his eyes. "i wisht i could run it down," he said. "but i can't. she's a-bitin' in my 
guts." 

behind him rose of sharon moved dizzily out of the tent. "where's connie?" she 

asked irritably. "i ain't seen connie for a long time. where'd he go?" 
"i ain't seen him," said ma. "if i see 'im, i'll tell 'im you want 'im." 
"i ain't feelin' good," said rose of sharon. "connie shouldn' of left me." 
ma looked up to the girl's swollen face. "you been a-cryin'," she said. 
the tears started freshly in rose of sharon's eyes. 
ma went on firmly, "you git aholt on yaself. they's a lot of us here. you git aholt

inside so i got to get drunk. figgered time wasn' yet, an' then—the preacher went an'

pa nodded his head up and down and cocked his head to hear. ruthie moved closer, 
like a puppy, crawling up on her elbows, and winfield followed her. rose of sharon 
dug at a deep eye in a potato with the point of her knife. the evening light deepened 
and became more blue. 

ma said, in a sharp matter-of-fact tone, "i don' see why him savin' tom got to get

john said sadly, "can't say her. i feel awful. he done her so easy. jus' stepped up

concrete highway and across the pavement to the grocery store. in front of the screen 
door he took off his hat, dropped it into the dust, and ground it with his heel in self-
abasement. and he left his black hat there, broken and dirty. he entered the store and 
walked to the shelves where the whisky bottles stood behind wire netting. 

pa and ma and the children watched uncle john move away. rose of sharon kept 

her eyes resentfully on the potatoes.

ruthie turned on her side in the dust. she put her head close to winfield's head and

snorted  and  pinched  his  mouth  tight.  the  two  children  crawled  away,  holding  their

the  frying  pan  of  potatoes  was  hissing  and  spitting  over  the  fire.  ma  moved  the 
thick slices about with a spoon. pa sat near by, hugging his knees. rose of sharon was 
sitting under the tarpaulin. 

"it's tom!" ma cried. "thank god." 
"we got to get outa here," said tom. 
"what's the matter now?" 
"well, floyd says they'll burn the camp tonight." 
"what the hell for?" pa asked. "we ain't done nothin'."

front  of  the  tent  rose  of  sharon  and  winfield  lay,  and  there  was  the  space  where 
ruthie  had  been,  beside  winfield.  she  squatted  down  and  peered  in.  her  eyes 
remained on winfield's tow head; and as she looked, the little boy opened his eyes and 
stared  out  at  her,  and  his  eyes  were  solemn.  ruthie  put  her  finger  to  her  lips  and 
beckoned with her other hand. winfield rolled his eyes over to rose of sharon. her 
pink flushed face was near to him, and her mouth was open a little. winfield carefully 
loosened  the  blanket  and  slipped  out.  he  crept  out  of  the  tent  cautiously  and  joined 
ruthie. "how long you been up?" he whispered. 

she  led  him  away  with  elaborate  caution,  and  when  they  were  safe,  she  said,  "i

rose of sharon, unkempt and sleepy-eyed, crawled out of the tent. ma turned from 
the  cornmeal  she  was  measuring  in  fistfuls.  she  looked  at  the  girl's  wrinkled  dirty 
dress, at her frizzled uncombed hair. "you got to clean up," she said briskly. "go right 
over and clean up. you got a clean dress. i washed it. git your hair combed. git the 
seeds out a your eyes." ma was excited. 

rose of sharon said sullenly, "i don' feel good: i wisht connie would come. i don't

ma advanced on her, mealy hands held out. "git," ma said. "they's times when how

"i'm a goin' to vomit," rose of sharon whined.

then you clean up, an' you wash your legs an' put on them shoes of yourn." she turned 
back to her work. "an' braid your hair," she said.

john climbed in beside him and the truck moved away down the street. 

ma watched them go. and then she took a bucket and went to the wash trays under 
the open part of the sanitary unit. she filled her bucket with hot water and carried it 
back to her camp. and she was washing the dishes in the bucket when rose of sharon 
came back. 

"i put your stuff on a plate," ma said. and then she looked closely at the girl. her 
hair was dripping and combed, and her skin was bright and pink. she had put on the 
blue dress printed with little white flowers. on her feet she wore the heeled slippers of 
her wedding. she blushed under ma's gaze. "you had a bath," ma said. 

rose  of  sharon  spoke  huskily.  "i  was  in  there  when  a  lady  come  in  an'  done  it.

stopped  and  sighed,  "why,  i  feel  like  people  again."  she  stacked  the  last  dish.  she 
went into the tent and dug through the clothes box for her shoes and a clean dress. and 
she  found  a  little  paper  package  with  her  earrings  in  it.  as  she  went  past  rose  of 
sharon,  she  said,  "if  them  ladies  comes,  you  tell  'em  i'll  be  right  back."  she 
disappeared around the side of the sanitary unit. 

rose of sharon sat down heavily on a box and regarded her wedding shoes, black 
patent leather and tailored black bows. she wiped the toes with her finger and wiped 
her  finger  on  the  inside  of  her  skirt.  leaning  down  put  a  pressure  on  her  growing 
abdomen.  she  sat  up  straight  and  touched  herself  with  exploring  fingers,  and  she 
smiled a little as she did it.

and she saw the little smile on the girl's face. 

"so!" she cried, and she laughed with pleasure. "what you think it's gonna be?" 
rose of sharon blushed and looked down at the ground, and then peeked up, and 

the little shiny black eyes of the woman took her in. "i don't know," she mumbled. 

the woman plopped the apple box on the ground. "got a live tumor," she said, and 

she cackled like a happy hen. "which'd you ruther?" she demanded.

rose of sharon watched her go, and then she put her head down on her hands and 
whimpered into her palms. a soft voice sounded beside her. she looked up, ashamed. 
it was the little white-clad manager. "don't worry," he said. "don't you worry." 

her eyes blinded with tears. "but i done it," she cried. "i hug-danced. i didn' tell 

her. i done it in sallisaw. me an' connie." 

"don't worry," he said.

houlder. "don't you worry. she doesn't know." and he walked quickly away. 

rose of sharon looked after him; his lean shoulders jerked as he walked. she was 
still watching his slight figure when ma came back, clean and pink, her hair combed 
and wet, and gathered in a knot. she wore her figured dress and the old cracked shoes; 
and the little earrings hung in her ears. 

"i  done  it,"  she  said.  "i  stood  in  there  an'  let  warm  water  come  a-floodin'  an'  a-

"uh-uh!" said the girl. 
"an' you jes' set there an' didn' redd up the camp none!" ma gathered up the tin 
dishes as she spoke. "we got to get in shape," she said. "come on, stir! get that sack 
and kinda sweep along the groun'." she picked up the equipment, put the pans in their 
box and the box in the tent. "get them beds neat," she ordered. "i tell ya i ain't never 
felt nothin' so nice as that water." 

rose of sharon listlessly followed orders. "ya think connie'll be back today?" 
"maybe—maybe not. can't tell."

"well,  some  folks  here  done  it,  an'  one  girl,  she  dropped  her  baby—dead—an'

"sure."

al turned around in the middle of the road and headed back. 
pa said, "ma's gonna be purty hurt, 'specially when tom got work so easy." 
"maybe  he  never  got  none,"  al  said.  "maybe  he  jus'  went  lookin',  too.  i  wisht  i 

could get work in a garage. i'd learn that stuff quick, an' i'd like it." 

pa grunted, and they drove back toward the camp in silence. 
when the committee left, ma sat down on a box in front of the joad tent, and she 
looked helplessly at rose of sharon. "well—" she said, "well—i ain't been so perked 
up in years. wasn't them ladies nice?" 

"i get to work in the nursery," rose of sharon said. "they tol' me. i can find out all 

how to do for babies, an' then i'll know." 

ma  nodded  in  wonder.  "wouldn'  it  be  nice  if  the  men-folks  all  got  work?"  she 
asked. "them a-workin, an' a little money comin' in?" her eyes wandered into space. 
"them a-workin', an' us a-workin' here, an' all them nice people. fust thing we get a

rose of sharon peered down the road. "that lady that says i'll lose the baby—" she 

began. 

"now you stop that," ma warned her. 

rose of sharon said softly, "i seen her. she's a-comin' here, i think. yeah! here she 

comes. ma, don't let her—" 

ma turned and looked at the approaching figure. 
"howdy," the woman said. "i'm mis' sandry—lisbeth sandry. i seen your girl this 

mornin'." 

"howdy do," said ma. 
"are you happy in the lord?" 
"pretty happy," said ma.

twitching form. 

the little manager strolled up casually. "trouble?" he asked. the crowd parted to 
let him through. he looked down at the woman. "too bad," he said. "will some of you 

help get her back to her tent?" the silent people shuffled their feet. two men bent over 
and lifted the woman, one held her under the arms and the other took her feet. they 
carried her away, and the people moved slowly after them. rose of sharon went under 
the tarpaulin and lay down and covered her face with a blanket. 

the manager looked at ma, looked down at the stick in her hand. he smiled tiredly. 

"did you clout her?" he asked. 

ma continued to stare after the retreating people. she shook her head slowly. "no—

but i would a. twicet today she worked my girl up." 

the manager said, "try not to hit her. she isn't well. she just isn't well." and he 
added softly, "i wish she'd go away, and all her family. she brings more troub

ma looked at him gratefully, and she called, "you hear that, rosasharn? she ain't

mister. if she comes back, i ain't to be trusted. i'll hit her." 

he smiled wryly. "i know how you feel," he said. "but just try not to. that's all i 
ask—just try not to." he walked slowly away toward the tent where mrs. sandry had 
been carried. 

ma went into the tent and sat down beside rose of sharon. "look up," she said. the 
girl  lay  still.  ma  gently  lifted  the  blanket  from  her  daughter's  face.  "that  woman's 
kinda crazy," she said. "don't you believe none of them things." 

rose of sharon whispered in terror, "when she said about burnin', i—felt burnin'." 
"that ain't true," said ma. 
"i'm  tar'd  out,"  the  girl  whispered.  "i'm  tar'd  a  things  happenin'.  i  wanta  sleep.  i

pa put down his plate and stood up. "come on, john," he said; and he explained to 
ma, "we're a-gonna talk to some fellas about gettin' work." and pa and uncle john 
walked toward the manager's house. 

tom  worked  a  piece  of  store  bread  into  the  stew  gravy  on  his  plate  and  ate  the 
bread. he handed his plate to ma, and she put it in the bucket of hot water and washed 
it, and handed it to rose of sharon to wipe. "ain't you goin' to the dance?" ma asked. 

"sure," said tom. "i'm on a committee. we're gonna entertain some fellas." 
"already on a committee?" ma said. "i guess it's 'cause you got work." 
rose of sharon turned to put the dish away. tom pointed at her. "my god, she's a-

gettin' big," he said. 

rose of sharon blushed and took another dish from ma. "sure she is," ma said. 
"an' she's gettin' prettier," said tom. 
the girl blushed more deeply and hung her head. "you stop it," she sai

tom  laughed.  "if  she  keeps  a-swellin'  like  this,  she  gonna  need  a  wheelbarra  to

"now you stop," rose of sharon said, and she went inside the tent, out of sight. 
ma chuckled, "you shouldn' ought to worry her." 
"she likes it," said tom. 
"i know she likes it, but it worries her, too. and she's a-mournin' for connie." 

"well,  she  might's  well  give  him  up.  he's  prob'ly  studyin'  to  be  president  of  the

the girl's lip quivered. "i—i ain' goin' to the dance. i couldn'—ma—he'p me!" she 

sat down and buried her head in her hands. 

ma  wiped  her  hands  on  the  dish  towel  and  she  squatted  down  in  front  of  her 
daughter, and she put her two hands on rose of sharon's hair. "you're a good girl," she 
said.  "you  always  was  a  good  girl.  i'll  take  care  a  you.  don't  you  fret."  she  put  an 
interest in her tone. "know what you an' me's gonna do? we're a-goin' to that dance,

led rose of sharon toward the sanitary unit. 

pa and uncle john squatted with a group of men by the porch of the office. "we 
nearly got work today," pa said. "we was jus' a few minutes late. they awready got 
two fellas. an', well, sir, it was a funny thing. they's a straw boss there, an' he says,

p your squares," he called. the music stopped. boys and girls, young men 
and  women,  ran  about  until  eight  squares  were  ready  on  the  big  floor,  ready  and 
waiting.  the  girls  held  their  hands  in  front  of  them  and  squirmed  their  fingers.  the 
boys tapped their feet restlessly. around the floor the old folks sat, smiling slightly, 
holding the children back from the floor. and in the distance the jesus-lovers sat with 
hard condemning faces and watched the sin. 

ma and rose of sharon sat on a bench and watched. and as each boy asked rose of 
sharon as partner, ma said, "no, she ain't well." and rose of sharon blushed and her 
eyes were bright. 

the  caller  stepped  to  the  middle  of  the  floor  and  held  up  his  hands.  "all  ready? 

then let her go!" 

the music snarled out "chicken reel," shrill and clear, fiddle skirling, harmonicas 
nasal  and  sharp,  and  the  guitars  booming  on  the  bass  strings.  the  caller  named  the 
turns,  the  squares  moved.  and

perspiration stood out on the foreheads of the boys. now the experts showed the tricky 
inter-steps. and the old people on the edge of the floor took up the rhythm, patted their 

hands  softly,  and  tapped  their  feet;  and  they  smiled  gently  and  then  caught  one 
another's eyes and nodded. 

ma leaned her head close to rose of sharon's ear. "maybe you wouldn' think it, but 
your pa was as nice a dancer as i ever seen, when he was young." and ma smiled. 
"makes me think of ol' times," she said. and on the faces of the watchers the smiles 
were of old times.

"you feelin' pretty good? your cheeks is kinda saggy." 

"i ain't had milk like they said i ought." 
"i know. we jus' didn' have no milk." 
rose of sharon said dully, "ef connie hadn' went away, we'd a had a little house by

the girl's eyes brightened for a moment, and then she looked aside. "i ain't pierced." 
"well, i'm a-gonna pierce ya." ma hurried back into the tent. she came back with a 
cardboard box. hurriedly she threaded a needle, doubled the thread and tied a series of 
knots in it. she threaded a second needle and knotted the thread. in the box she found a 
piece of cork. 

"it'll hurt. it'll hurt."

ma  stepped  to  her,  put  the  cork  in  back  of  the  ear  lobe  and  pushed  the  needle

the girl twitched. "it sticks. it'll hurt." 
"no more'n that." 
"yes, it will." 
"well, then. le's see the other ear first." she placed the cork and pierced the other 

ear. 

"it'll hurt." 
"hush!" said ma. "it's all done." 
rose of sharon looked at her in wonder. ma clipped the needles off and pulled one 

knot of each thread through the lobes. 

"now," she said. "ever' day we'll pull one knot, and in a couple weeks it'll be all 

well an' you can wear 'em. here—they're your'n now. you can keep 'em." 

rose of sharon touched her ears tenderly and looked at the tiny spots of blood on 

her fingers. "it didn' hurt. jus' stuck a little."

commanded the length of the street. 

tom stared after them. "they sure do wanta make us feel at home." 
ma opened the door of the house and stepped inside. the floor was splashed with 
grease. in the one room stood a rusty tin stove and nothing more. the tin stove rested 
on four bricks and its rusty stovepipe went up through the roof. the room smelled of 
sweat and grease. rose of sharon stood beside ma. "we gonna live here?"

"i like the tent better," the girl said. 
"this got a floor," ma suggested. "this here wouldn' leak when it rains." she turned 

to the door. "might as well unload," she said.

the  fire  roared  in  the  joad  house.  hamburger  patties  splashed  and  hissed  in  the 
grease, and the potatoes bubbled. the house was full of smoke, and the yellow lantern 
light threw heavy black shadows on the walls. ma worked quickly about the fire while 
rose of sharon sat on a box resting her heavy abdomen on her knees. 

"feelin' better now?" ma asked. 
"smell a cookin' gets me. i'm hungry, too." 
"go set in the door," ma said. "i got to have that box to break up anyways." 
the men trooped in. "meat, by god!" said tom. "and coffee. i smell her. jesus, i'm

and dropped him slowly back and lifted him again.

tom heard the choked, smothered cries. he bit his lower lip and studied the floor. 
and then he went to pa's bed. under the edge of the mattress the rifle lay, a lever-
action winchester .38, long and heavy. tom picked it up and dropped the lever to see 
that a cartridge was in the chamber. he tested the hammer on half-cock. and then he 
went back to his mattress. he laid the rifle on the floor beside him, stock up and barrel 
pointing down. rose of sharon's voice thinned to a whimper. tom lay down again and 
covered himself, covered his bruised cheek with the blanket and made a little tunnel to 
breathe through. he sighed, "jesus, oh, jesus!" 

outside a group of cars went by, and voices sounded. 
"how many men?" 
"jes' us—three. whatcha payin'?" 
"you go to house twenty-five. number's right on the door." 
"o.k., mister. whatcha payin'?"

tom dozed on his mattress. a stealthy sound in the room awakened him. 
his hand crept to the rifle and tightened on the grip. he drew back the covers from his

tom pointed at her with his thumb. "she raised hell, ma. thinks all the trouble is

pot between his legs and ate what was left and scraped at the crust on the sides. ma 
poured the rest of the canned milk in a cup and sneaked it to rose of sharon to drink 
secretly in a corner. she poured the hot black coffee into the cups and passed them

"yeah, two." 
"which way you goin'?" 
"south. we got a job." 
"yeah? jobs is scarce—reg'lar jobs." 
"we got a frien'," al said. "job's all waitin' for us. well, so long." the truck swung 
around and bumped over the dirt street into the road. the feeble headlight jiggled over 
the way, and the right headlight blinked on and off from a bad connection. at every 
jolt the loose pots and pans in the truck-bed jangled and crashed. 

rose of sharon moaned softly. 
"feel bad?" uncle john asked. 
"yeah! feel bad all a time. wisht i could set still in a nice place. wisht we was

embarrassed about connie.

"know where we're a-goin'?" uncle john asked. 
"no," said al. "jus' goin', an' gettin' goddamn sick of it." 
"i ain't so tur'ble far from my time," rose of sharon said threateningly. "they better 

be a nice place for me." 

the night air was cold with the first sting of frost. beside the road the leaves were 
beginning to drop from the fruit trees. on the load, ma sat with her back against the 
truck side, and pa sat opposite, facing her. 

ma called, "you all right, tom?" 
his muffled voice came back, "kinda tight in here. we all through the ranch?" 
"you be careful," said ma. "might git stopped."

drove slowly back to the line of boxcars. the truck lights showed the cat-walks up to

lights.

the joads had been lucky. they got in early enough to have a place in the boxcars. 
now the tents of the late-comers filled the little flat, and those who had the boxcars 
were old-timers, and in a way aristocrats.

each took a package. outside ruthie and winfield were waiting, their eyes strained, 
their cheeks puffed and full of cracker jack. 

"won't eat no supper, i bet," ma said. 
people  streamed  toward  the  boxcar  camp.  the  tents  were  lighted.  smoke  poured 
from  the  stovepipes.  the  joads  climbed  up  their  cat-walk  and  into  their  end  of  the 
boxcar. rose of sharon sat on a box beside the stove. she had a fire started, and the tin 
stove was wine-colored with heat. "did ya get milk?" she demanded. 

"yeah. right here." 
"give it to me. i ain't had any sence noon." 
"she thinks it's like medicine."

the men went out to wash in the stream. rose of sharon sliced the potatoes into the 

frying pan and stirred them about with the knife point. 

suddenly the tarpaulin was thrust aside. a stout perspiring face looked in from the 

other end of the car. "how'd you all make out, mis' joad?" 

ma  swung  around.  "why,  evenin',  mis'  wainwright.  we  done  good.  three  an'  a

ma broke twigs into the stove, and the coals from the dinner cooking started them 
blazing. ruthie and winfield came out of their bed like hermit crabs from shells. for a 
moment  they  were  careful;  they  watched  to  see  whether  they  were  still  criminals. 
when no one noticed them, they grew bold. ruthie hopped all the way to the door and 
back on one foot, without touching the wall. 

ma was pouring flour into a bowl when rose of sharon climbed the cat-walk. she 

steadied herself and advanced cautiously. "what's the matter?" she asked. 

"why, it's news!" ma cried. "we're gonna have a little party 'count a al an' aggie

blew more steadily now, and the bushes whished steadily. rose of sharon went down 
on her knees and crawled deep into the brush. the berry vines cut her face and pulled 
at her hair, but she didn't mind. only when she felt the bushes touching her all over did 
she stop. she stretched out on her back. and she felt the weight of the baby inside of 
her.

she crept back and fumbled for the matches, beside the lantern. the shade screeched 
up. she lighted the wick, watched it burn blue for a moment and then put up its yellow, 
delicately  curved  ring  of  light.  she  carried  the  lantern  to  the  stove  and  set  it  down 
while she broke the brittle dry willowy twigs into the fire box. in a moment the fire 
was roaring up the chimney. 

rose of sharon rolled heavily over and sat up. "i'll git right up," she said. 
"whyn't you lay a minute till it warms?" ma asked. 
"no, i'll git." 
ma filled the coffee pot from the bucket and set it on the stove, and she put on the 

frying pan, deep with fat, to get hot for the pones. "what's over you?" she said softly. 

"i'm a-goin' out," rose of sharon said. 
"out where?" 
"goin' out to pick cotton."

outside,  the  camp  had  come  to  life.  fires  burned  in  front  of  the  tents.  the 

stovepipes from the boxcars spurted smoke.

each man looked in his own book as he was being paid. "wainwright, agnes, thirty-
four cents. tobin, sixty-three cents." the line moved past slowly. the families went 
back to their cars, silently. and they drove slowly away. 

joads and wainwrights waited in the truck for the driveway to clear. and as they 
waited, the first drops of rain began to fall. al put his hand out of the cab to feel them. 
rose of sharon sat in the middle, and ma on the outside. the girl's eyes were lusterless 
again. 

"you shouldn' of came," ma said. "you didn' pick more'n ten-fifteen pounds." rose 
of sharon looked down at her great bulging belly, and she didn't reply. she shivered 
suddenly and held her head high. ma, watching her closely, unrolled her cotton bag, 
spread it over rose of sharon's shoulders, and drew her close. 

at last the way was clear. al started his motor and drove out into the highway. the

ent drops of rain lanced down and splashed on the road, and as the truck 
moved  along,  the  drops  became  smaller  and  close.  rain  pounded  on  the  cab  of  the 
truck so loudly that it could be heard over the pounding of the old worn motor. on the 
truck  bed  the  wainwrights  and  joads  spread  their  cotton  bags  over  their  heads  and 
shoulders. 

rose of sharon shivered violently against ma's arm, and ma cried, "go faster, al.

al speeded the pounding motor, and when he came to the boxcar camp, he drove 
down  close  to  the  red  cars.  ma  was  spouting  orders  before  they  were  well  stopped. 
"al," she commanded, "you an' john an' pa go into the willows an' c'lect all the dead

and rose of sharon tried to follow, but her knees buckled and she sat down heavily on 
the running board. 

fat mrs. wainwright saw her. "what's a matter? her time come?" 
"no, i don' think so," said ma. "got a chill. maybe took col'. gimme a han', will

back—her legs took her weight. 

"i'm awright, ma," she said. "it was jus' a minute there." 

the older women kept hands on her elbows. "feet in hot water," ma said wisely. 

they helped her up the cat-walk and into the boxcar. 

"you rub her," mrs. wainwright said. "i'll get a far' goin'." she used the last of the 
twigs and built up a blaze in the stove. the rain poured now, scoured at the roof of the 
car.

"i got pain killer an' salts," mrs. wainwright said. "you're welcome to 'em if you

pa and uncle john stood in the open door and looked out on the rising stream. at both 
ends of the camp the water ran near to the highway, but at the camp it looped away so 
that the highway embankment surrounded the camp at the back and the stream closed it 
in on the front. and pa said, "how's it look to you, john? seems to me if that crick

"wisht we had a dog," ruthie said. 
"we'll have a dog; have a cat, too."

complaining, away. 

from the mattress where rose of sharon lay covered up there came a quick sharp 
cry, cut off in the middle. ma whirled and went to her. rose of sharon was holding her 
breath and her eyes were filled with terror. 

"what is it?" ma cried. the girl expelled her breath and caught it again. suddenly 
ma put her hand under the covers. then she stood up. "mis' wainwright," she called. 
"oh, mis' wainwright!"

"i think it's come," ma said. "it's early." 
the girl heaved a great sigh and relaxed. she released her lip and closed her eyes. 

mrs. wainwright bent over her. 

"did it kinda grab you all over—quick? open up an' answer me." rose of sharon 
nodded weakly. mrs. wainwright turned to ma. "yep," she said. "it's come. early, ya

"maybe the fever brang it." 
"well, she oughta be up on her feet. oughta be walkin' aroun'."

wainwright  took  a  paring  knife  from  her  apron  pocket  and  slipped  it  under  the 
mattress. "maybe it don't do no good," she said apologetically. "our folks always done 
it. don't do no harm, anyways." 

ma nodded. "we used a plow point. i guess anything sharp'll work, long as it can 

cut birth pains. i hope it ain't gonna be a long one."

aggie joined them behind the brush pile. aggie's lean face and yellow hair showed

wall. 

ruthie whispered, "you ever saw a baby bore?"

"higher!" pa cried. "we got to git her higher!" 

the  evening  came,  and  the  work  went  on.  and  now  the  men  were  beyond 
weariness. their faces were set and dead. they worked jerkily, like machines. when it 
was dark the women set lanterns in the car doors, and kept pots of coffee handy. and 
the women ran one by one to the joad car and wedged themselves inside. 

the pains were coming close now, twenty minutes apart. and rose of sharon had 
lost  her  restraint.  she  screamed  fiercely  under  the  fierce  pains.  and  the  neighbor 
women looked at her and patted her gently and went back to their own cars. 

ma  had  a  good  fire  going  now,  and  all  her  utensils,  filled  with  water,  sat  on  the 

stove to heat. every little while pa looked in the car door. "all right?" he asked.

the two lamps were turned low. ma sat on the mattress beside rose of sharon, and ma 
fanned her still face with a piece of cardboard. mrs. wainwright poked dry brush into 
the stove, and a dank smoke edged out around the lids and filled the car with a smell of 
burning tissue. ma looked up at pa when he entered, and then quickly down. 

"how—is she?" pa asked. 
ma did not look up at him again. "awright, i think. sleepin'."

uncle  john  turned  and  shuffled  tiredly  down  the  car  to  the  dark  end.  the  rain 
whished  softly  on  the  roof  now,  so  softly  that  they  could  hear  uncle  john's  tired 
sniffling from the dark. 

pa looked up at mrs. wainwright. he took the lantern from her hand and put it on 
the floor. ruthie and winfield were asleep on their own mattress, their arms over their 
eyes to cut out the light. 

pa walked slowly to rose of sharon's mattress. he tried to squat down, but his legs 
were too tired. he knelt instead. ma fanned her square of cardboard back and forth. 
she  looked  at  pa  for  a  moment,  and  her  eyes  were  wide  and  staring,  like  a 
sleepwalker's eyes. 

pa said, "we—done—what we could."

on down here." 

the rain scattered lightly on the roof now, and a new-risen breeze blew it along in 
sweeps. mrs. wainwright came from the stove and looked down at rose of sharon. 
"dawn's a-comin' soon, ma'am. whyn't you git some sleep? i'll set with her."

ma looked down at the water. it was only six inches down from the floor by now.

her.

"tar'd. jus' tar'd out."

"i ain't hungry." 
mrs. wainwright moved beside ma. "she looks all right. come through it fine." 
rose  of  sharon's  eyes  questioned  ma,  and  ma  tried  to  avoid  the  question.  mrs. 

wainwright walked to the stove.

looked down in awe. she whispered harshly, "she sick, ma? she gonna die?" 

"'course not. she's gonna be awright. awright." 
pa came in with his armload of packages. "how is she?"

in the other end of the boxcar, the wainwrights were pounding, building a platform

"maybe a little, on the road. git your back bent, pa." 
pa slipped into the water and stood waiting. ma helped rose of sharon down from 
the platform and steadied her across the car. pa took her in his arms, held her as high as 
he could, and pushed his way carefully through the deep water, around the car, and to 
the highway. he set her down on her feet and held onto her. uncle john carried ruthie 
and followed. ma slid down into the water, and for a moment her skirts billowed out 
around her. 

"winfiel', set on my shoulder. al—we'll come back soon's the water's down. al—" 
she paused. "if—if tom comes—tell

from the right of the road there came a sharp swishing. ma cried, "hurry up. they's 
a  big  rain.  le's  go  through  the  fence  here.  it's  shorter.  come  on,  now!  bear  on, 
rosasharn." they half dragged the girl across the ditch, helped her through the fence. 
and then the storm struck them. sheets of rain fell on them. they plowed through the 
mud and up the little incline. the black barn was nearly obscured by the rain. it hissed 
and splashed, and the growing wind drove it along. rose of sharon's feet slipped and 
she dragged between her supporters. 

"pa! can you carry her?" 

pa leaned over and picked her up. "we're wet through anyways," he said. "hurry 

up. winfiel'—ruthie! run on ahead." 

they  came  panting  up  to  the  rain-soaked  barn  and  staggered  into  the  open  end. 
there was no door in this end. a few rusty farm tools lay about, a disk plow and a 
broken cultivator, an iron wheel. the rain hammered on the room and curtained the 
entrance.  pa  gently  set  rose

suddenly the boy cried, "he's dyin', i tell you! he's starvin' to death, i tell you." 
"hush," said ma. she looked at pa and uncle john standing helplessly gazing at the 
sick man. she looked at rose of sharon huddled in the comfort. ma's eyes passed rose

rose of sharon whispered, "will—will you all—go out?" the rain whisked lightly 

ma leaned forward and with her palm she brushed the tousled hair back from her 
daughter's forehead, and she kissed her on the forehead. ma got up quickly. "come on, 
you fellas," she called. "you come out in the tool shed." 

ruthie opened her mouth to speak. "hush," ma said. "hush and git." she herded

 drew the boy with her; and she closed the squeaking door. 

for a minute rose of sharon sat still in the whispering barn. then she hoisted her 
tired body up and drew the comfort about her. she  moved slowly to the corner and 
stood looking down at the wasted face, into the wide, frightened eyes. then slowly she 
lay  down  beside  him.  he  shook  his  head  slowly  from  side  to  side.  rose  of  sharon 
loosened  one  side  of  the  blanket  and  bared  her  breast.  "you  got  to,"  she  said.  she 
squirmed closer and pulled his head close. "there!" she said. "there." her ha
