 valdes, first let him know the words of art;
     and then, all other ceremonies learn'd,
     faustus may try his cunning[43] by himself.

     valdes. first i'll instruct thee in the rudiments,
     and then wilt thou be perfecter than i.

     faustus. then come and dine with me, and, after meat,
     we'll canvass every quiddity thereof;
     for, ere i sleep, i'll try what i can do:
     this night i'll conjure, though i die therefore.

 conference with the
     emperor?  i think i have met with you for it.

     emperor. good master doctor, at my entreaty release him:  he hath
     done penance sufficient.

     faustus. my gracious lord, not so much for the injury he offered
     me here in your presence, as to delight you with some mirth, hath
     faustus worthily requited this injurious knight; which being all
     i desire, i am content to release him of his horns:--and,
     sir knight, hereafter speak well of scholars.--mephistophilis,
     transform him straight.[138]  [mephistophilis removes the horns.]
     --now, my good lord, having done my duty, i humbly take my leave.

     emperor. farewell, master doctor:  yet, ere you go,
     expect from me a bounteous reward.

     wagner. i think my master means to die shortly,
     for he hath given to me all his goods:[152]
     and yet, methinks, if that death were near,
     he would not banquet, and carouse, and swill
     amongst the students, as even now he doth,
     who are at supper with such belly-cheer
     as wagner ne'er beheld in all his life.
     see, where they come! belike the feast is ended.

          enter faustus with two or three scholars, and mephistophilis.

     first scholar. master doctor faustus, since our conference about
     fair ladies, which was the beautifulest in all the world, we have
     determined with ourselves that helen of greece was the admirablest
     lady that ever lived:  therefore, master doctor, if you will do us
     that favour, as to let us see that peerless dame of greece, whom
     all the world admires for majesty, we should think ourselves much
     beholding unto you.

     third scholar. no marvel though the angry greeks pursu'd
     with ten years' war the rape of such a queen,
     whose heavenly beauty passeth all compare.

     first scholar. since we have seen the pride of nature's works,
     and only paragon of excellence,
     let us depart; and for this glorious deed
     happy and blest be faustus evermore!

     faustus. gentlemen, farewell:  the same i wish to you.

     old man. ah, doctor faustus, that i might prevail
     to guide thy steps unto the way of life,
     by which sweet path thou mayst attain the goal
     that shall conduct thee to celestial rest!
     break heart, drop blood, and mingle it with tears,
     tears falling from repentant heaviness
     of thy most vile[155] and loathsome filthiness,
     the stench whereof corrupts the inward soul
     with such flagitious crimes of heinous sin

     satan begins to sift me with his pride:
     as in this furnace god shall try my faith,
     my faith, vile hell, shall triumph over thee.
     ambitious fiends, see how the heavens smile
     at your repulse, and laugh your state to scorn!
     hence, hell! for hence i fly unto my god.

     first scholar. what ails faustus?

     faustus. ah, my sweet chamber-fellow, had i lived with thee,
     then had i lived still! but now i die eternally.  look, comes
     he not? comes he not?

     second scholar. what means faustus?

     third scholar. belike he is grown into some sickness by being
     over-solitary.

     first scholar. if it be so, we'll have physicians to cure him.
     --'tis but a surfeit; never fear, man.

irst scholar. tempt not god, sweet friend; but let us into the

     ye hear,[171] come not unto me, for nothing can rescue me.

     second scholar. pray thou, and we will pray that god may have
     mercy upon thee.

     you; if not, faustus is gone to hell.

     now hast thou but one bare hour to live,
     and then thou must be damn'd perpetually!
     stand still, you ever-moving spheres of heaven,
     that time may cease, and midnight never come;
     fair nature's eye, rise, rise again, and make
     perpetual day; or let this hour be but
     a year, a month, a week, a natural day,
     that faustus may repent and save his soul!
