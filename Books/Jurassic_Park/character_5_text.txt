"and you're confident of your theory."
"ob, yes," malcolm said. "totally confident." he sat back in the chair. "there is a problem with
that island. it is an accident waiting to happen."
isla nublar
with a whine, the rotors began to swing in circles overhead, casting shadows on the runway of
san jos‚ airport. grant listened to the crackle in his earphones as the pilot talked to the tower.
they had picked up another passenger in san jos‚, a man named dennis nedry, who had
flown in to meet them. he was fat and sloppy, eating a candy bar, and there was sticky chocolate
on his fingers, and flecks of aluminum foil on his shirt. nedry had mumbled something about
doing computers on the island, and hadn't offered to shake hands.
through the plexi bubble grant watched the airport concrete drop away beneath his feet, and
he saw the shadow of the helicopter racing along as they went west, toward the mountains.
"it's about a forty-minute trip," hammond said, from

id off.
"actually, dinosaur dna is somewhat easier to extract by this process than mammalian dna.
the reason is that mammalian red cells have no nuclei, and thus no dna in their red cells. to
clone a mammal, you must find a white cell, which is much rarer than red cells. but dinosaurs
had nucleated red cells, as do modern birds. it is one of the many indications we have that
dinosaurs aren't really reptiles at all. they are big leathery birds."
tim saw that dr. grant still looked skeptical, and dennis nedry, the messy fat man, appeared
completely uninterested, as if he knew it all already. nedry kept looking impatiently toward the
next room.
"i see mr. nedry has spotted the next phase of our work," wu said. "how we identify the dna
we have extracted. for that, we use powerful computers."
they went through sliding doors into a chilled room. there was a loud humming sound. two
six-foot-tall round towers stood in the center of the room, and along the walls were rows of waisthigh
stainless-steel boxes

na strand?" grant asked.
"oh no," wu said. "that's impossible. we've come a long way from the sixties, when it took a
whole laboratory four years to decode a screen like this. now the computers can do it in a couple
of hours. but, even so, the dna molecule is too big. we look only at the sections of the strand
that differ from animal to animal, or from contemporary dna. only a few percent of the
nucleotides differ from one species to the next. that's what we analyze, and it's still a big job." 
dennis nedry yawned. he'd long ago concluded that ingen must be doing something like this. a
couple of years earlier, when ingen had hired nedry to design the park control systems, one of
the initial design parameters called for data records with 3 x 109 fields. nedry just assumed that
was a mistake, and had called palo alto to verify it. but they had told him the spec was correct.

 that's all."
grant frowned. again he felt troubled. he didn't like the idea of dinosaurs being used for an
amusement park.
malcolm continued his questions. "you can run the whole park from this control room?"
"yes," arnold said. "i can run it single-handed, if i have to. we've got that much automation
built in. the computer by itself can track the animals, feed them, and fill their water troughs for
forty-eight hours without supervision."
"this is the system mr. nedry designed?" malcolm asked. dennis nedry was sitting at a
terminal in the far corner of the room, eating a candy bar and typing.
"yes, that's right," nedry said, not looking up from the keyboard. "it's
a hell of a system," arnold said proudly.
"that's right," nedry said absently. "just one or two minor bugs to fix."
"now," arnold said, "i see the tour is starting, so unless you have other questions . . ."
"actually, just one," malcolm said. "just a research question. you showed us that you can
track the procompsognathids and you can v

 gearshifts on the cars are
acting up! the gearshifts!"
"let's keep it in perspective," hammond said. "you get the engineering correct and the animals
will fall into place. after all, they're trainable."
from the beginning, this had been one of the core beliefs of the planners. the animals,
however exotic, would fundamentally behave like animals in zoos anywhere. they would learn
the regularities of their care, and they would respond.
"meanwhile, how's the computer?" hammond said. he glanced at dennis nedry, who was
working at a terminal in the corner of the room. "this damn computer has always been a
headache."
"we're getting there," nedry said.
"if you had done it right in the first place," hammond began, but arnold put a restraining band
on his arm. arnold knew there was no point in antagonizing nedry while he was working.
"it's a large system," arnold said. "there are bound to be glitches."
in fact, the bug list now ran to more than 130 items, and included many odd aspects. for
example:

the automated fecal analysis (called auto poop), designed to check for parasites in the animal
stools, invariably recorded all specimens as having the parasite phagostomum venulosum,
although none did. the program then automatically dispensed medication into the animals' food. if
the handlers dumped the medicine out of the hoppers to prevent its being dispensed, an alarm
sounded which could not be turned off.
and so it went, page after page of errors.
when he had arrived, dennis nedry had been under the impression that he could make all the
fixes himself over the weekend. he had paled when he saw the full listing. now he was calling his
office in cambridge, telling his staff programmers they were going to have to cancel their
weekend plans and work overtime until monday. and he had told john arnold that he would need
to use every telephone link between isla nublar and the mainland just to transfer program data
back and forth to his programmers. 
while nedry worked, arnold pu

anywhere on the island. when muldoon threatened to quit, and to take his story to the press, a
compromise was reached. in the end, two specially built laser-guided missile launchers were kept in
a locked room in the basement. only muldoon had keys to the room.
those were the keys muldoon was twirling now. "i'm going downstairs," he said.
arnold, watching the control screens, nodded. the two land cruisers sat at the top of the hill,
waiting for the t-rex to appear.
"hey," dennis nedry called, from the far console. "as long as you're up, get me a coke, okay?"
grant waited in the car, watching quietly. the bleating of the goat became louder, more insistent.
the goat tugged frantically at its tether, racing back and forth. over the radio, grant heard lex
say in alarm, "what's going to happen to the goat? is she going to eat the goat?"
"i think so," someone said to her, and then ellie turned the radio down. then they smelled the
odor, a garbage stench of putrefaction and decay t

painfully, perhaps even dangerously. but life finds a way." malcolm shook his head. "i don't mean
to be philosophical, but there it is."
gennaro looked over. ellie and grant were across the field, waving their arms and shouting.
"did you get my coke?" dennis nedry asked, as muldoon came back into the control room.
muldoon didn't bother to answer. he went directly to the monitor and looked at what was
happening. over the radio he heard harding's voice saying, "-the stego-finally-handle on-now-"
"what's that about?" muldoon said.
"they're down by the south point," arnold said. "that's why they're breaking up a little. i'll
switch them to another channel. but they found out what's wrong with the stegos. eating some
kind of berry."
hammond nodded. "i knew we

r on the perimeter. everything in this building's working fine. but outside,
in the park, the power is gone. lights, tv cameras, everything." his remote video monitors had
gone black.
"what about the two land cruisers?"
"stopped somewhere around the tyrannosaur paddock."
"well," muldoon said, "call maintenance and let's get the power back on. 
arnold picked up one of his phones and heard hissing: nedry's computers talking to each
other. "no phones. that damn nedry. nedry! where the hell is he?"
dennis nedry pushed open the door marked fertilization, with the perimeter power out, all
the security-card locks were disarmed. every door in the building opened with a touch.
the problems with the security system were high on jurassic park's bug list. nedry wondered
if anybody ever imagined that it wasn't a bug-tbat nedry had programmed it that way. he had
built in a classic trap door. few programmers of large computer systems could resist the
temptation to leave themselves a secret entrance. partly it wa

he went back into the hallway. the theft had taken less than two minutes. he could imagine
the consternation upstairs in the control room, as they began to realize what had happened. all
their security codes were scrambled, and all their phone lines were jammed. without his help, it
would take hours to untangle the mess-but in just a few minutes nedry would he back in the
control room, setting things right.
and no one would ever suspect what he had done.
grinning, dennis nedry walked down to the ground floor, nodded to the guard, and continued
downstairs to the basement. passing the neat lines of electric land cruisers, he went to the
gasoline-powered jeep parked against the wall. he climbed into it, noticing some odd gray tubing
on the passenger seat. it looked almost like a rocket launcher, he thought, as he turned the
ignition key and started the jeep.
nedry glanced at his watch. from here, into the park, and three minutes straight to the east
dock. three minutes

s worth?"
gennaro shook his head.
"somewhere between two and ten million," muldoon said. he shook his head. "big stakes."
as they came closer, gennaro saw the body lying beside the car. the body was indistinct and
green-but then green shapes scattered away, as the jeep pulled to a stop.
"compys," muldoon said. "the compys found him,"
a dozen procompsognathids, delicate little predators no larger than ducks, stood at the edge of
the jungle, chittering excitedly as the men climbed out of the car.
dennis nedry lay on his back, the chubby boyish face now red and bloated. flies buzzed
around the gaping mouth and thick tongue. his body was mangled-the intestines torn open, one
leg chewed through. gennaro turned away quickly, to look at the little compys, which squatted on
their hind legs a short distance away and watched the men curiously. the little dinosaurs had
five-fingered hands, he noticed. they wiped their faces and chins, giving them an eerily human
quality which-
"i'll be damned," muldoon said.
