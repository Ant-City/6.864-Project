w in his steps, and was meanwhile applying the same arts to the conquest of the starkfield maidenhood. hitherto ethan frome had been content to think him a mean fellow; but now he positively invited a horse-whipping. it was strange that the girl did not seem aware of it: that she could lift her rapt face to her dancer’s, and drop her hands into his, without appearing to feel the offence of his look and touch.
frome was in the habit of walking into starkfield to fetch home his wife’s cousin, mattie silver, on the rare evenings when some chance of amusement drew her to the village. it was his wife who had suggested, when the girl came to live with them, that such opportunities should be put in her way. mattie silver came from stamford, and when she entered the fromes’ household to act as her cousin zeena’s aid it was thought best, as she came without pay, not to let her feel too sharp a contrast between the life she had left and the isolation of a starkfield farm. but for this—as frome sard

onically reflected—it would hardly have occurred to zeena to take any thought for the girl’s amusement.
when his wife first proposed that they should give mattie an occasional evening out he had inwardly demurred at having to do the extra two miles to the village and back after his hard day on the farm; but not long afterward he had reached the point of wishing that starkfield might give all its nights to revelry.
mattie silver had lived under his roof for a year, and from early morning till they met at supper he had frequent chances of seeing her; but no moments in her company were comparable to those when, her arm in his, and her light step flying to keep time with his long stride, they walked back through the night to the farm. he had taken to the girl from the first day, when he had driven over to the flats to meet her, and she had smiled and waved to him from the train, crying out, “you must be ethan!” as she

got the time now; i’m late as it is,” he returned, holding his old silver turnip-watch to the candle.
zeena, apparently accepting this as final, lay watching him in silence while he pulled his suspenders over his shoulders and jerked his arms into his coat; but as he went toward the door she said, suddenly and incisively: “i guess you’re always late, now you shave every morning.”
that thrust had frightened him more than any vague insinuations about denis eady. it was a fact that since mattie silver’s coming he had taken to shaving every day; but his wife always seemed to be asleep when he left her side in the winter darkness, and he had stupidly assumed that she would not notice any change in his appearance. once or twice in the past he had been faintly disquieted by zenobia’s way of letting things happen without seeming to remark them, and then, weeks afterward, in a casual phrase, revealing that she had all along taken her notes and drawn her inferences. of late, however, there had

been no room in his thoughts for such vague apprehensions. zeena herself, from an oppressive reality, had faded into an insubstantial shade. all his life was lived in the sight and sound of mattie silver, and he could no longer conceive of its being otherwise. but now, as he stood outside the church, and saw mattie spinning down the floor with denis eady, a throng of disregarded hints and menaces wove their cloud about his brain....

he had been afraid that she would hate the hard life, the cold and loneliness; but not a sign of discontent escaped her. zeena took the view that mattie was bound to make the best of starkfield since she hadn’t any other place to go to; but this did not strike ethan as conclusive. zeena, at any rate, did not apply the principle in her own case.
he felt all the more sorry for the girl because misfortune had, in a sense, indentured her to them. mattie silver was the daughter of a cousin of zenobia frome’s, who had inflamed his clan with mingled sentiments of envy and admiration by descending from the hills to connecticut, where he had married a stamford girl and succeeded to her father’s thriving “drug” business. unhappily orin silver, a man of far-reaching aims, had died too soon to prove that the end justifies the means. his accounts revealed merely what the means had been; and these were such that it was fortunate for his wife and daught

keep two girls, did you? no wonder you were scared at the expense!”
he still had but a confused sense of what she was saying. from the beginning of the discussion he had instinctively avoided the mention of mattie’s name, fearing he hardly knew what: criticism, complaints, or vague allusions to the imminent probability of her marrying. but the thought of a definite rupture had never come to him, and even now could not lodge itself in his mind.
“i don’t know what you mean,” he said. “mattie silver’s not a hired girl. she’s your relation.”
“she’s a pauper that’s hung onto us all after her father’d done his best to ruin us. i’ve kep’ her here a whole year: it’s somebody else’s turn now.”
as the shrill words shot out ethan heard a tap on the door, which he had drawn shut when he turned back from the threshold.
“ethan—zeena!” mattie’s voice sounded gaily from the landing, “do you know what time it is? supper’s been ready half an hour.”

dish-what for?”
a bright flush flew to mattie’s cheeks. “i wanted to make the supper-table pretty,” she said.
“you wanted to make the supper-table pretty; and you waited till my back was turned, and took the thing i set most store by of anything i’ve got, and wouldn’t never use it, not even when the minister come to dinner, or aunt martha pierce come over from bettsbridge—” zeena paused with a gasp, as if terrified by her own evocation of the sacrilege. “you’re a bad girl, mattie silver, and i always known it. it’s the way your father begun, and i was warned of it when i took you, and i tried to keep my things where you couldn’t get at ‘em—and now you’ve took from me the one i cared for most of all—” she broke off in a short spasm of sobs that passed and left her more than ever like a shape of stone.
“if i’d ‘a’ listened to folks, you’d ‘a’ gone before now, and this wouldn’t ‘a’ happened,” she said; and gathering up the bits of broken glass

t.”
i knew then that it was she who had been speaking when we entered.
her companion, who was just coming back to the table with the remains of a cold mince-pie in a battered pie-dish, set down her unappetising burden without appearing to hear the accusation brought against her.
frome stood hesitatingly before her as she advanced; then he looked at me and said: “this is my wife, mis’ frome.” after another interval he added, turning toward the figure in the arm-chair: “and this is miss mattie silver...”
mrs. hale, tender soul, had pictured me as lost in the flats and buried under a snow-drift; and so lively was her satisfaction on seeing me safely restored to her the next morning that i felt my peril had caused me to advance several degrees in her favour.
great was her amazement, and that of old mrs. varnum, on learning that ethan frome’s old horse had carried me to and from corbury junction through the worst blizzard of the winter; greater still their surprise when they heard that his

ng to see how much footing my conjectures gave her; and i guessed that if she had kept silence till now it was because she had been waiting, through all the years, for some one who should see what she alone had seen.
i waited to let her trust in me gather strength before i said: “yes, it’s pretty bad, seeing all three of them there together.”
she drew her mild brows into a frown of pain. “it was just awful from the beginning. i was here in the house when they were carried up—they laid mattie silver in the room you’re in. she and i were great friends, and she was to have been my bridesmaid in the spring... when she came to i went up to her and stayed all night. they gave her things to quiet her, and she didn’t know much till to’rd morning, and then all of a sudden she woke up just like herself, and looked straight at me out of her big eyes, and said... oh, i don’t know why i’m telling you all this,” mrs. hale broke off, crying.
