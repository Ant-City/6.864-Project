stars  and  galaxies),  but  not  both.  this  means  that  they  need  use  only  quantum  mechanics or  only
general relativity and can, with a furtive glance, shrug off the barking admonition of the other. for
fifty years this approach has not been quite as blissful as ignorance, but it has been pretty close.

crushed to a minuscule size. at the moment of the big bang the whole of the universe erupted from a
microscopic nugget whose size makes a grain of sand look colossal. these are realms that are tiny
and  yet  incredibly  massive,  therefore  requiring  that  both  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity
simultaneously be brought to bear. for reasons that will become increasingly clear as we proceed,
the equations of general relativity and quantum mechanics, when combined, begin to shake, rattle, and

this elusive unified tapestry finally have been revealed. string theory has the potential to show that all
of the wondrous happenings in the universe—from the frantic dance of subatomic quarks to the stately
waltz of orbiting binary stars, from the primordial fireball of the big bang to the majestic swirl of
heavenly galaxies—are reflections of one grand physical principle, one master equation.

because these features of string theory require that we drastically change our understanding of
space, time, and matter, they will take some time to get used to, to sink in at a comfortable level. but

through  time,  this  is  the fastest  speed  through  space  that  the  object—any  object—can  possibly
achieve. this is analogous to our car being test-driven directly in the north-south direction. just as the
car will have no speed left for motion in the east-west dimension, something traveling at light speed
through space will have no speed left for motion through time. thus light does not get old; a photon
that emerged from the big bang is the same age today as it was then. there is no passage of time at
light speed.

nevertheless, in the last 40 years a variety of experiments making use of technological advancements
have tested numerous aspects of general relativity with great precision. the predictions of general
relativity have been uniformly confirmed. there is no longer any doubt that einstein's description of
gravity is not only compatible with special relativity, but yields predictions closer to experimental
results than those of newton's theory.

black holes, the big bang, and the expansion of space

whereas special relativity is most manifest when things are moving fast, general relativity comes into
its own when things are very massive and the warps in space and time are correspondingly severe.

clock is turned back to ever earlier times, the whole of the cosmos is compressed to the size of an
orange, a lemon, a pea, a grain of sand, and to yet tinier size still. extrapolating all the way back to
"the beginning," the universe would appear to have begun as a point—an image we will critically re-
examine  in  later  chapters—in  which  all  matter  and  energy  is  squeezed  together  to  unimaginable
density and temperature. it is believed that a cosmic fireball, the big bang, erupted from this volatile
mixture spewing forth the seeds from which the universe as we know it evolved.

the image of the big bang as a cosmic explosion ejecting the material contents of the universe
like shrapnel from an exploding bomb is a useful one to bear in mind, but it is a little misleading.
when a bomb explodes, it does so at a particular location in space  and  at  a  particular  moment in
time.  its  contents  are  ejected  into  the  surrounding  space.  in  the  big  bang,  ther

material content occurs because all of space is shrinking. the orange-size, the pea-size, the grain of
sand–size  devolution  describes  the whole  of  the  universe—not  something  within  the  universe.
carrying  on  to  the  beginning,  there  is  simply  no  space  outside  the  primordial  pinpoint  grenade.
instead, the big bang is the eruption of compressed space whose unfurling, like a tidal wave, carries
along matter and energy even to this day.

no deviations from the predictions of general relativity have been found in experiments performed

understanding  what  really  happens  to  space,  time,  and  matter  when  crushed  together  fully  at  the
moment of the big bang or at the central point of a black hole. but more generally, the conflict alerts
us to a fundamental deficiency in our conception of nature. the resolution of this conflict has eluded
attempts  by  some  of  the  greatest  theoretical  physicists,  giving  it  a  well-deserved  reputation  as the
central problem of modern theoretical physics. understanding the conflict requires familiarity with
some basic features of quantum theory, to which we now turn.

temperature drops, as it has done steadily since the big bang, the electromagnetic and weak forces
crystallize out in a different manner from their common high-temperature form—through a process
known as symmetry breaking that we will describe later—and therefore appear to be distinct in the
cold universe we currently inhabit.

and  so,  if  you  are  keeping  score,  by  the  1970s  physicists  had  developed  a  sensible  and
successful quantum-mechanical description of three of the four forces (strong, weak, electromagnetic)

heavy particles are usually unstable, relinquishing their enormous mass by decaying into a cascade of
ever  lighter  particles,  ending  with  the  familiar,  relatively  light  particles  in  the  world  around  us.
however, it is possible that such a super-heavy vibrational string state—a relic from the big bang—
did survive to the present. finding such particles, as we discuss more fully in chapter 9, would be a
monumental discovery, to say the least.

ameliorate  the  hostilities  between  the  gravitational  force  and  quantum  mechanics.  recall  that  the

the value required for probing structures on the scale of the planck length, the additional energy does
not sharpen the string probe. rather, the energy causes the string to grow in size, thereby diminishing
its short-distance sensitivity. in fact, although the size of a typical string is the planck length, if we
pumped enough energy into a string—an amount of energy beyond our wildest imaginings but one that
would likely have been attained by the big bang—we could cause it to grow to a macroscopic size, a
clumsy probe of the microcosmos indeed! it's as if a string, unlike a point particle, has two sources of
smearing: quantum jitters, as for a point particle, and also its own inherent spatial extent. increasing a
string's energy decreases the smearing from the first source but ultimately increases the smearing from
the second. the upshot is that no matter how hard you try, the extended nature of a string prevents you

all, what meaning can we give to the term "law" if it can abruptly change? this does not mean that the
universe is static; the universe certainly changes in innumerable ways from each moment to the next.
rather,  it  means  that  the  laws  governing  such  evolution  are  fixed  and  unchanging. you  might  ask
whether we really know this to be true. in fact, we don't. but our success in describing numerous
features of the universe, from a brief moment after the big bang right through to the present, assures us
that  if  the  laws  are  changing  they  must  be  doing  so  very  slowly.  the  simplest  assumption  that  is
consistent with all that we know is that the laws are fixed.

we should eventually be able to extract the answer, but as yet our understanding of the theory is not
refined enough to reach this goal. that's not to say that there haven't been valiant attempts to explain
it. for instance, from a cosmological perspective, we can imagine that all of the dimensions start out
being tightly curled up and then, in a big bang–like explosion, three spatial dimensions and one time
dimension unfurl and expand to their present large extent while the other spatial dimensions remain
small. rough arguments have been put forward as to why only three space dimensions grow large, as
we will discuss in chapter 14, but it's fair to say that these explanations are only in the formative
stages.  in  what  follows,  we  will  assume  that  all  but  three  space  dimensions  are  curled  up,  in

some longer shots

there are yet other ways in which evidence for string theory might be found. for example, witten has
pointed out the long-shot possibility that astronomers might one day see a direct signature of string
theory in the data they collect from observing the heavens. as encountered in chapter 6, the size of a
string is typically the planck length, but strings that are more energetic can grow substantially larger.
the energy of the big bang, in fact, would have been high enough to produce a few macroscopically
large  strings  that,  through  cosmic  expansion,  might  have  grown  to  astronomical  scales.  we  can
imagine that now or sometime in the future, a string of this sort might sweep across the night sky,
leaving an unmistakable and measurable imprint on data collected by astronomers (such as a small
shift in the cosmic microwave background temperature; see chapter 14). as witten says, "although
somewhat fanciful, this is

ultramicroscopic realm, the extended nature of the string ensures that riemann's geometry simply will
not  be  the  right  mathematical  formalism.  instead,  as  we  will  now  see,  it  must  be  replaced  by  the
quantum geometry of string theory, leading to dramatically new and unexpected properties.

according to the big bang model of cosmology, the whole of the universe violently emerged from a
singular  cosmic  explosion,  some  15  or  so  billion  years  ago.  today,  as  originally  discovered  by
hubble, we can see that the "debris" from this explosion, in the form of many billions of galaxies, is
still streaming outward. the universe is expanding. we do not know whether this cosmic growth will
continue forever or if there will come a time when the expansion slows to a halt and then reverses

the physics we encounter—as discussed in previous sections—will be identical to that of a universe
in which the radius, in the conventional sense of distance, is larger than the planck length (as attested
to, for example, by the exact correspondence between tables 10.1 and 10.2). and it is physics, not
language, that really matters.

brandenberger, vafa, and other physicists have made use of these ideas to suggest a rewriting of
the laws of cosmology in which both the big bang and the possible big crunch do not involve a zero-
size universe, but rather one that is planck-length in all dimensions. this is certainly a very appealing
proposal for avoiding the mathematical, physical, and logical conundrums of a universe that emanates
from  or  collapses  to  an  infinitely  dense  point. although  it  is  conceptually  difficult  to  imagine  the
whole of the universe compressed together into a tiny planck-sized nugget, it is truly beyond the pale

this easier-to-swallow alternative to the standard big bang model.

how general is this conclusion?

what  if  the  spatial  dimensions  are  not  circular  in  shape?  do  these  remarkable  conclusions  about
minimum spatial extent in string theory still hold? no one knows for sure. the essential aspect of
circular  dimensions  is  that  they  permit  the  possibility  of  wound  strings.  as  long  as  the  spatial

shapes, the result—that the fabric of space can tear—is certainly of wider applicability.

second,  could  such  a  topology-changing  tear  happen  today  or  tomorrow?  could  it  have
happened  in  the  past? yes.  experimental  measurements  of  elementary  particle  masses  show  their
values to be quite stable over time. but if we head back to the earliest epochs following the big bang,
even non-string-based theories invoke important periods during which elementary particle masses do
change over time. these periods, from a string-theoretic perspective, could certainly have involved
the topology-changing tears discussed in this chapter. closer to the present, the observed stability of
elementary particle masses implies that if the universe is currently undergoing a topology-changing

the standard model of cosmology

the modern theory of cosmic origins dates from the decade and a half after einstein's completion of
general relativity. although einstein refused to take his own theory at face value and accept that it
implies that the universe is neither eternal nor static, alexander friedmann did. and as we discussed
in chapter 3, friedmann found what is now known as the big bang solution to einstein's equations—a
solution that declares that the universe violently emerged from a state of infinite compression, and is
currently  in  the  expanding  aftermath  of  that  primeval  explosion.  so  certain  was  einstein  that  such
time-varying solutions were not a result of his theory that he published a short article claiming to have
found a fatal flaw in friedmann's work. some eight months later, however, friedmann succeeded in
convincing  einstein  that  there  was,  i

ed  that,  indeed,  the  universe  is
expanding. friedmann's work, refashioned in a more systematic and efficient form by the physicists
howard robertson and arthur walker, still forms the foundation of modern cosmology.

in a little more detail, the modern theory of cosmic origins goes like this. some 15 billion or so
years ago, the universe erupted from an enormously energetic, singular event, which spewed forth all
of space and all of matter. (you don't have to search far to locate where the big bang occurred, for it
took place where you are now as well as everywhere else; in the beginning, all locations we now see

as separate were the same location.) the temperature of the universe a mere 10-43 seconds after the
bang,  the  so-called planck  time,  is  calculated  to  have  been  about  1032  kelvin,  some  10  trillion
trillion  times  hotter  than  the  deep  interior  of  the  sun. as  time  passed,  the  universe  expanded  and
cooled, and as it did, the initial homogeneous, roiling

 before being deflected or absorbed. the charged-particle barrier to the
free motion of photons would have made the universe appear almost completely opaque, much like
what you may have experienced in a dense morning fog or a blinding, gusty snowstorm. but when
negatively  charged  electrons  were  brought  into  orbit  around  positively  charged  nuclei,  yielding
electrically neutral atoms, the charged obstructions disappeared and the dense fog lifted. from that
time onward, photons from the big bang have traveled unhindered and the full expanse of the universe
gradually came into view.

about a billion years later, with the universe having substantially calmed down from its frenetic
beginnings, galaxies, stars, and ultimately planets began to emerge as gravitationally bound clumps of
the primordial elements. today, some 15 billion or so years after the bang, we can marvel at both the
magnificence of the cosmos and at our collective ability to have pieced together a reasonable and

but how much faith should we really have in the big bang theory?

putting the big bang to the test

by looking out into the universe with their most powerful telescopes, astronomers can see light that
was emitted from galaxies and quasars just a few billion years after the big bang. this allows them to
verify the expansion of the universe predicted by the big bang theory back to this early phase of the
universe, and everything checks out to a "t." to test the theory to yet earlier times, physicists and
astronomers must make use of more indirect methods. one of the most refined approaches involves
something known as cosmic background radiation.

if you've ever felt a bicycle tire after vigorously pumping it full of air, you know that it is warm
to  the  touch.  some  of  the  energy  you  expend  in  the  repeated  pumping  motion  is  transferred  to  an

1950s, and robert dicke and jim peebles in the mid-1960s, realized that the present-day universe
should be permeated by an almost uniform bath of these primordial photons, which, through the last
15 billion years of cosmic expansion, have cooled to a mere handful of degrees above absolute zero.1
in 1965, arno penzias and robert wilson of bell laboratories in new jersey accidentally made one
of the most important discoveries of our age when they detected this afterglow of the big bang while
working  on  an  antenna  intended  for  use  with  communication  satellites.  subsequent  research  has
refined both theory and experiment, culminating in measurements taken by nasa's cobe (cosmic
background explorer) satellite in the early 1990s. with these data, physicists and astronomers have
confirmed  to  high  precision  that  the  universe is filled with microwave radiation (if our eyes were
sensitive to microwaves, we would see a diffuse glow in the world around us) whose temper

in  concrete  terms,  in every cubic meter of the universe—including the one you now occupy—there
are,  on  average,  about  400  million  photons  that  collectively  compose  the  vast  cosmic  sea  of
microwave  radiation,  an  echo  of  creation. a  percentage  of  the  "snow"  you  see  on  your  television

can we push further in our tests of the big bang theory to even earlier times? we can. by using
standard principles of nuclear theory and thermodynamics, physicists can make definite predictions
about  the  relative  abundance  of  the  light  elements  produced  during  the  period  of  primordial
nucleosynthesis, between a hundredth of a second and a few minutes atb. according to theory, for

to  examine  this  more  fully,  let's  imagine  studying  a  "film"  of  the  cosmic  expansion,  but  let's
review it in reverse, running the film backward in time from today toward the moment of the big bang.
since the speed of light sets a limit to how fast any signal or information of any kind can travel, matter
in two regions of space can exchange heat energy and thereby have a chance of coming to a common
temperature only if the distance between them at a given moment is less than the distance light can
have traveled since the time of the big bang. and so, as we roll the film backward in time we see that

the root of the horizon problem is that in order to get two widely separated regions of the universe
close together, we have to run the cosmic film way back toward the beginning of time. so far back, in
fact, that there is not enough time for any physical influence to have traveled from one region to the
other. the difficulty, therefore, is that as we run the cosmological film backward and approach the
big bang, the universe does not shrink at a fast enough rate.

well,  that's  the  rough  idea,  but  it's  worthwhile  sharpening  the  description  a  bit.  the  horizon
problem stems from the fact that like a ball tossed upward, the dragging pull of gravity causes the
expansion rate of the universe to slow down. this means that, for example, to halve the separation
between  two  locations  in  the  cosmos  we  must  run  the  film  back  more  than  halfway  toward  its

there remains a sliver of figure 14.1, between the big bang and the planck time, that we have not yet
discussed. by blindly applying the equations of general relativity to that region, physicists have found
that the universe continues to get ever smaller, ever hotter, and ever denser, as we move backward in
time toward the bang. at time zero, as the size of the universe vanishes, the temperature and density

arises  in  the  standard  and  inflationary  cosmological  theories.  but  rather  than  concluding  that  this
means the universe begins as an extremely hot planck-size nugget, gasperini and veneziano suggest
that there may be a whole prehistory to the universe—starting long before what we have so far been
calling time zero—that leads up to the planckian cosmic embryo.

in this so-called pre–big bang scenario, the universe began in a vastly different state than it does
in  the  big  bang  framework.  gasperini  and  veneziano's  work  suggests  that  rather  than  being
enormously  hot  and  tightly  curled  into  a  tiny  spatial  speck,  the  universe  started  out  as  cold  and
essentially infinite in spatial extent. the equations of string theory then indicate that—somewhat as in
guth's inflationary epoch—an instability kicked in, driving every point in the universe to rush rapidly

away from every other. gasperini and veneziano show that this caused space to become increasingly
curved  and  results  in  a  dramatic  increase  in  temperature  and  energy  density.7 after  some  time,  a
millimeter-sized three-dimensional region within this vast expanse could look just like the super-hot
and dense patch emerging from guth's inflationary expansion. then, through the standard expansion of
ordinary big bang cosmology, this patch can account for the whole of the universe with which we are
familiar. moreover, because the pre–big bang epoch involves its own inflationary expansion, guth's
solution to the horizon problem is automatically built into the pre–big bang cosmological scenario. as
veneziano has said, "string theory offers us a version of inflationary cosmology on a silver platter."8
the study of superstring cosmology is rapidly becoming an active and fertile arena of research.

of "what's out there"—in a manner that dwarfs hubble's realization that the milky way is but one

be asking too much of an ultimate theory.

a more radical musing comes from a proposal of lee smolin of penn state university, who,
inspired by the similarity between conditions at the big bang and at the centers of black holes—each
being characterized by a colossal density of crushed matter—has suggested that every black hole is

in fact, however, this discussion illustrates that an ultimate explanation can yet be achieved, so long
as we grasp not only the ultimate laws but also their implications for cosmological evolution on an
unexpectedly grand scale.

undoubtedly, the cosmological implications of string/m-theory will be a major field of study
well into the twenty-first century. without accelerators capable of producing planck-scale energies,
we will increasingly have to rely on the cosmological accelerator of the big bang, and the relics it has
left for us throughout the universe, for our experimental data. with luck and perseverance, we may
finally be able to answer questions such as how the universe began, and why it has evolved to the
form we behold in the heavens and on earth. there is, of course, much uncharted territory between
where we are and where full answers to these fundamental questions lie. but the development of a

r  why  the  universe  has  the  properties  we
observe is that, were the properties different, it is likely that life would not form and therefore we
would not be here to observe the changes.
antimatter.  matter  that  has  the  same  gravitational  properties  as  ordinary  matter,  but  that  has  an
opposite electric charge as well as opposite nuclear force charges.
antiparticle. a particle of antimatter.
atb. acronym for "after the bang"; usually used in reference to time elapsed since the big bang.
atom.  fundamental  building  block  of  matter,  consisting  of  a nucleus  (comprising protons  and
neutrons) and an orbiting swarm of electrons.
big bang.  currently  accepted  theory  that  the  expanding  universe  began  some  15  billion  years  ago
from a state of enormous energy, density, and compression.
big crunch. one hypothesized future for the universe in which the current expansion stops, reverses,
and results in all space and all matter collapsing together; a reversal of the bi

showing that the universe is not fully left-right symmetric.
closed string. a type of string that is in the shape of a loop.
conifold transition. evolution of the calabi-yau portion of space in which its fabric rips and repairs
itself, yet with mild and acceptable physical consequences in the context of string theory. the tears
involved are more severe than those in a flop transition.
cosmic microwave  background  radiation.  microwave  radiation  suffusing  the  universe,  produced
during the big bang and subsequently thinned and cooled as the universe expanded.
cosmological  constant.  a  modification  of general  relativity's  original  equations,  allowing  for  a
static universe; interpretable as a constant energy density of the vacuum.
coupling constant. see string coupling constant.
curled-up dimension. a spatial dimension that does not have an observably large spatial extent; a
spatial  dimension  that  is  crumpled,  wrapped,  or  curled  up  into  a  tiny  size,  thereby  evading  d

 of the discrete units of energy, mass, spin, etc. into which
the microscopic world is partitioned. its value is 1.05 × 10-27 grams-cm/sec.
planck tension. about 1039 tons. the tension on a typical string in string theory.
planck time. about 10-43 seconds. time at which the size of the universe was roughly the planck
length; more precisely, time it takes light to travel the planck length.
primordial nucleosynthesis. production of atomic nuclei occurring during the first three minutes after
the big bang.
principle of equivalence.  core  principle  of general relativity declaring the indistinguishability of
accelerated motion and immersion in a gravitational field (over small enough regions of observation).
generalizes  the principle  of  relativity  by  showing  that  all  observers,  regardless  of  their  state  of
motion, can claim to be at rest, so long as they acknowledge the presence of a suitable gravitational
field.
principle  of  relativity.  core  principle  of special  relativity  d
