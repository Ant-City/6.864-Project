ld certainly remain untenanted
if anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.
for both these reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather
less than i knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with
you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank.

“the moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
are thrown very much together. for this reason i saw a good deal of
sir charles baskerville. with the exception of mr. frankland, of lafter
hall, and mr. stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of
education within many miles. sir charles was a retiring man, but the
chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests
in science kept us so. he had brought back much scientific information
from south africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot.

“within the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that

would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. no, no, we will
preserve them upon our list of suspects. then there is a groom at the
hall, if i remember right. there are two moorland farmers. there is our
friend dr. mortimer, whom i believe to be entirely honest, and there is
his wife, of whom we know nothing. there is this naturalist, stapleton,
and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.
there is mr. frankland, of lafter hall, who is also an unknown factor,
and there are one or two other neighbours. these are the folk who must
be your very special study.”

“i will do my best.”

“you have arms, i suppose?”

“yes, i thought it as well to take them.”

“most certainly. keep your revolver near you night and day, and never
relax your precautions.”

our friends had already secured a first-class carriage and were waiting
for us upon the platform.

“no, we have no news of any kind,” said

 of catching a glimpse of the escaped
convict. if he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he intends to prosecute dr. mortimer for opening
a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the
neolithic skull in the barrow on long down. he helps to keep our lives
from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
needed.

and now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
stapletons, dr. mortimer, and frankland, of lafter hall, let me end on
that which is most important and tell you more about the barrymores, and
especially about the surprising development of last night.

first of all about the test telegram, which you sent from london in
order to make sure that barrymore was really here. i have already
explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test was
worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. i told sir
henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright

 might have been the work of a protecting friend
as easily as of an enemy. where is that friend or enemy now? has he
remained in london, or has he followed us down here? could he--could he
be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor?

it is true that i have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are
some things to which i am ready to swear. he is no one whom i have seen
down here, and i have now met all the neighbours. the figure was far
taller than that of stapleton, far thinner than that of frankland.
barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,
and i am certain that he could not have followed us. a stranger then is
still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in london. we have never
shaken him off. if i could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we
might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. to this one
purpose i must now devote all my energies.

my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans. my second and
wisest one is to play my own game

is whom
you do not know?”

“hardly any, i think.”

“can you, then, tell me the name of any woman whose initials are l. l.?”

he thought for a few minutes.

“no,” said he. “there are a few gipsies and labouring folk for whom
i can’t answer, but among the farmers or gentry there is no one whose
initials are those. wait a bit though,” he added after a pause. “there
is laura lyons--her initials are l. l.--but she lives in coombe tracey.”

“who is she?” i asked.

“she is frankland’s daughter.”

“what! old frankland the crank?”

“exactly. she married an artist named lyons, who came sketching on the
moor. he proved to be a blackguard and deserted her. the fault from what
i hear may not have been entirely on one side. her father refused to
have anything to do with her because she had married without his consent
and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. so, between the old
sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.”

“how does she live

?”

“i fancy old frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,
for his own affairs are considerably involved. whatever she may have
deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. her story
got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her
to earn an honest living. stapleton did for one, and sir charles for
another. i gave a trifle myself. it was to set her up in a typewriting
business.”

he wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but i managed to satisfy
his curiosity wit

hout telling him too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. tomorrow morning i shall
find my way to coombe tracey, and if i can see this mrs. laura lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing
one incident in this chain of mysteries. i am certainly developing the
wisdom of the serpent, for when mortimer pressed his questions to an
inconvenient extent i asked him casually to what type frankland’s skull
belonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.
i have not lived for years with sherlock holmes for nothing.

i have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and
melancholy day. this was my conversation with barrymore just now, which
gives me one more strong card which i can play in due time.

mortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecarte
afterwards. the butler brought me my coffee into the library, and i took
the chance to

but it would puzzle him to do so upon the lonely moor. on the other
hand, if i should find the hut and its tenant should not be within it i
must remain there, however long the vigil, until he returned. holmes had
missed him in london. it would indeed be a triumph for me if i could run
him to earth where my master had failed.

luck had been against us again and again in this inquiry, but now at
last it came to my aid. and the messenger of good fortune was none other
than mr. frankland, who was standing, gray-whiskered and red-faced,
outside the gate of his garden, which opened on to the highroad along
which i travelled.

“good-day, dr. watson,” cried he with unwonted good humour, “you must
really give your horses a rest and come in to have a glass of wine and
to congratulate me.”

my feelings towards him were very far from being friendly after what i
had heard of his treatment of his daughter, but i was anxious to send
perkins and the wagonette home, and the opportun

alighted and sent a message to sir henry that i should walk over in time
for dinner. then i followed frankland into his dining-room.

“it is a great day for me, sir--one of the red-letter days of my life,”
 he cried with many chuckles. “i have brought off a double event. i mean
to teach them in these parts that law is law, and that there is a man
here who does not fear to invoke it. i have established a right of way
through the centre of old middleton’s park, slap across it, sir, within
a hundred yards of his own front door. what do you think of that? we’ll
teach these magnates that they canno

 pounds, but i got my
verdict.”

“did it do you any good?”

“none, sir, none. i am proud to say that i had no interest in the
matter. i act entirely from a sense of public duty. i have no doubt, for
example, that the fernworthy people will burn me in effigy tonight.
i told the police last time they did it that they should stop these
disgraceful exhibitions. the county constabulary is in a scandalous
state, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which i am
entitled. the case of frankland v. regina will bring the matter before
the attention of the public. i told them that they would have occasion
to regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.”

“how so?” i asked.

the old man put on a very knowing expression. “because i could tell them
what they are dying to know; but nothing would induce me to help the
rascals in any way.”

i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get away
from his gossip, but now i began to wish to hear more of

teful old busybody. but his next remark took a weight from my
mind.

“you’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.
i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. he passes along
the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to
the convict?”

here was luck indeed! and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest. a
child! barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. it was
on his track, and not upon the convict’s, that frankland had stumbled.
if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. but
incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.

“i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of
the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”

the least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.
his eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like
those of an angry cat.

“indeed, sir!” said he, pointing out ove

ased him and led him to further confidences.

“you may be sure, sir, that i have very good grounds before i come to an
opinion. i have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. every
day, and sometimes twice a day, i have been able--but wait a moment,
dr. watson. do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment
something moving upon that hillside?”

it was several miles off, but i could distinctly see a small dark dot
against the dull green and gray.

“come, sir, come!” cried frankland, rushing upstairs. “you will see with
your own eyes and judge for yourself.”

the telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon
the flat leads of the house. frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a
cry of satisfaction.

“quick, dr. watson, quick, before he passes over the hill!”

there he was, sure enough, a small urchin with a little bundle upon his
shoulder, toiling slowly up the hill. when he reached the crest i saw
the ragged uncouth figure outlined for an i

upon our faces and
the dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we
were back upon the moor once again. every stride of the horses and every
turn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.

our conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired
wagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our
nerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. it was a relief to me,
after that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed frankland’s
house and knew that we were drawing near to the hall and to the scene
of action. we did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of
the avenue. the wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to coombe
tracey forthwith, while we started to walk to merripit house.

“are you armed, lestrade?”

the little detective smiled. “as long as i have my trousers i have a
hip-pocket, and as long as i have my hip-pocket i have something in it.”

“good! my friend and i are also ready
