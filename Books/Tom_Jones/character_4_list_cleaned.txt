[CHARACTER] 
 - 
                squire western is a caricature of the rough-and-ready, conservative country 
gentleman. affectionate at heart, the squire nevertheless acts with extreme 
violence towards his daughter sophia, by constantly incarcerating her, and even 
verbally and physically abusing her. however, since the squire is a caricature, 
fielding does not intend for us to judge these actions too harshly. similarly, 
the squire's insistence on sophia marrying blifil has less to do with greed than 
with his stubbornness and adherence to tradition. squire western's speaks in 
west country dialect, and peppers his speech with curses.
