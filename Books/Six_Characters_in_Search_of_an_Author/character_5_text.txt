cket. he is alternatively mellifluous and violent in his manner.

the mother seems crushed and terrified as if by an intolerable weight of shame and abasement. she is dressed in modest black and wears a thick widow's veil of crÃªpe. when she lifts this, she reveals a wax-like face. she always keeps her eyes downcast.

the step-daughter, is dashing, almost impudent, beautiful. she wears mourning too, but with great elegance. she shows contempt for the timid half-frightened manner of the wretched boy (14 years old, and also dressed in black); on the other hand, she displays a lively tenderness for her little sister, the child (about four), who is dressed in white, with a black silk sash at the waist.

the son (22) tall, severe in his attitude of contempt for the father, supercilious and indifferent to the mother. he looks as if he had come on the stage against his will.

the step-daughter [to manager]. worse? worse? listen! stage this drama for us at once! then you will see that at a certain moment i . . . when this little darling here .. [takes the child by the hand and leads her to the manager.] isn't she a dear? [takes her up and kisses her.] darling! darling! [puts her down again and adds feelingly.] well, when god suddenly takes this dear little child away from that poor mother there; and this imbecile here [seizing hold of the boy roughly and pushing him forward.] does the stupidest things, like the fool he is, you will see me run away. yes, gentlemen, i shall be off. but the moment hasn't arrived yet. after what has taken place between him and me [indicates the father with a horrible wink.] i can't remain any longer in this society, to have to witness the anguish of this mother here for that fool . . . [indicates the son.] look at him! look at him! see how indifferent, how frigid he is, because he is the legitimate son.

 he despises me, despises him [pointing to the boy.], despises this baby here; because . . . we are bastards. [goes to the mother and embraces her.] and he doesn't want to recognize her as his mother -- she who is the common mother of us all. he looks down upon her as if she were only the mother of us three bastards. wretch! [she says all this very rapidly, excitedly. at the word "bastards" she raises her voice, and almost spits out the final "wretch!"]

the mother [vigorously]. he forced me to it, and i call god to witness it. [to the manager.] ask him [indicates husband.] if it isn't true. let him speak. you [to daughter.] are not in a position to know anything about it.

the step-daughter. i know you lived in peace and happiness with my father while he lived. can you deny it?

the mother. no, i don't deny it . . .

the step-daughter. he was always full of affection and kindness for you. [to the boy, angrily.] it's true, isn't it? tell them! why don't you speak, you little fool?

the mother. leave the poor boy alone. why do you want to make me appear ungrateful, daughter? i don't want to offend your father. i have answered him that i didn't abandon my house and my son through any fault of mine, nor from any wilful passion.

the father. it is true. it was my doing.

the step-daughter. no. why?

the father. infamous! infamous! [then excitedly to manager explaining.] after she [indicating mother.] went away, my house seemed suddenly empty. she was my incubus, but she filled my house. i was like a dazed fly alone in the empty rooms. this boy here [indicating the son.] was educated away from home, and when he came back, he seemed to me to be no more mine. with no mother to stand between him and me, he grew up entirely for himself, on his own, apart, with no tie of intellect or affection binding him to me. and then -- strange but true -- i was driven, by curiosity at first and then by some tender sentiment, towards her family, which had come into being through my will. the thought of her began gradually to fill up the emptiness i fel

he whole action. look at that lad who is always clinging to his mother, frightened and humiliated. it is on account of this fellow here. possibly his situation is the most painful of all. he feels himself a stranger more than the others. the poor little chap feels mortified, humiliated at being brought into a home out of charity as it were. [in confidence.] he is the image of his father. hardly talks at all. humble and quiet.

the manager. oh, we'll cut him out. you've no notion what a nuisance boys are on the stage . . .

the father. he disappears soon, you know. and the baby too. she is the first to vanish from the scene. the drama consists finally in this: when that mother re-enters my house, her family born outside of it, and shall we say superimposed on the original, ends with the death of the little girl, the tragedy of the boy and the flight of the elder daughter. it cannot go on, because it is foreign to its surroundings. so after much torment, we three remain: i, the mother, that

act ii

the stage call-bells ring to warn the company that the play it about to begin again.

the step-daughter comes out of the manager's office along with the child and the boy. as she comes out of the office, she cries: --

nonsense! nonsense! do it yourselves! i'm not going to mix myself up in this mess. [turning to the child and coming quickly with her on to the stage.] come on, rosetta, let's run! [the boy follows them slowly, remaining a little behind and seeming perplexed.]

 real one, so she could play with it. what a joke it'll be for the others! but for you, alas! not quite such a joke: you who are real, baby dear, and really play by a real fountain that is big and green and beautiful, with ever so many bamboos around it that are reflected in the water, and a whole lot of little ducks swimming about . . . no, rosetta, no, your mother doesn't bother about you on account of that wretch of a son there. i'm in the devil of a temper, and as for that lad . . . [seizes boy by the arm to force him to take one of his hands out of his pockets.] what have you got there? what are you hiding? [pulls his hand out of his pocket, looks into it and catches the glint of a revolver.] ah! where did you get this? [the boy, very pale in the face, looks at her, but does not answer]. idiot! if i'd been in your place, instead of killing myself, i'd have shot one of those two, or both of them: father and son. [the father enters from the office, all excited from his work. the manage

the step-daughter [following him towards the office]. ouff! what's the good, if you've arranged everything. [the father, manager and step-daughter go back into the office again (off) for a moment. at the same time, the son followed by the mother, comes out.]

the son [looking at the three entering office]. oh this is fine, fine! and to think i can't even get away! [the mother attempts to look at him, but lowers her eyes immediately when he turns away from her. she then sits down. the boy and the child approach her. she casts a glance again at the son, and speaks with humble tones, trying to draw him into conversation.]

the mother. and isn't my punishment the worst of all? [then seeing from the son's manner that he will not bother himself about her.] my god! why are you so cruel? isn't it enough for one person to support all this torment? must you then insist on others seeing it also?

the manager. are we going to begin this second act or not?

the step-daughter. i'm not going to talk any more now- but i must tell you this: you can't have the whole action take place in the garden, as you suggest. it isn't possible!

the manager.. why not?

the step-daughter. because he [indicates the son again.] is always shut up alone in his room. and then there's all the part of that poor dazed-looking boy there which takes place indoors.

the manager. maybe! on the other hand, you will understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one act.

the leading man. they used to once.

the manager. yes, when the public was up to the level of that child there.

the leading lady. it makes the illusion easier.

the father [irritated]. the illusion! for heaven's sake, don't say illusion. please don't use that word, which is particularly painful for us..

[as if she saw herself still there by the writing table, and was annoyed by the presence of the actors.] oh, if you would only go away, go away and leave us alone -- mother here with that son of hers -- i with that child -- that boy there always alone -- and then i with him [just hints at the father.] -- and then i alone, alone . . . in those shadows! [makes a sudden movement as if in the vision she has of herself illuminating those shadows she wanted to seize hold of herself.] ah! my life! my life! oh, what scenes we proposed to him -- and i tempted him more than any of the others!

the father. maybe. but perhaps it was your fault that he refused to give us life: because you were too insistent, too troublesome.

the manager. well then, we'll have it in the garden. everything shall happen in the garden; and we'll group the other scenes there. [calls a stage hand.] here, a backcloth with trees and something to do as a fountain basin. [turning round to look at the back of the stage.] ah, you've fixed it up. good! [to step-daughter.] this is just to give an idea, of course. the boy, instead of hiding behind the doors, will wander about here in the garden, hiding behind the trees.. but it's going to be rather difficult to find a child to do that scene with you where she shows you the flowers. [turning to the boy.] come forward a little, will you please? let's try it now! come along! come along!

[goes back to observe the effect, when the boy at once goes through the action.] excellent! fine! [turning to step-daughter.] suppose the little girl there were to surprise him as he looks round,, and run over to him, so we could give him a word or two to say?

the step-daughter. it's useless to hope he will speak, as long as that fellow there is here . . . [indicates the son.] you must send him away first.

the manager [to the son anxiously]. and then you . . .
