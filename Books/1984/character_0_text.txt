chapter 1



it was a bright cold day in april, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
winston smith, his chin nuzzled into his breast in an effort to escape the
vile wind, slipped quickly through the glass doors of victory mansions,
though not quickly enough to prevent a swirl of gritty dust from entering
along with him.

the hallway smelt of boiled cabbage and old rag mats. at one end of it a
coloured poster, too large for indoor display, had been tacked to the wall.
it depicted simply an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a
man of about forty-five, with a heavy black moustac

ted for the ten thousandth time as he
forced his shoulders painfully backward (with hands on hips, they were
gyrating their bodies from the waist, an exercise that was supposed to be
good for the back muscles)--the frightening thing was that it might all be
true. if the party could thrust its hand into the past and say of this or
that event, it never happened--that, surely, was more terrifying than mere
torture and death?

the party said that oceania had never been in alliance with eurasia. he,
winston smith, knew that oceania had been in alliance with eurasia as short
a time as four years ago. but where did that knowledge exist? only in his
own consciousness, which in any case must soon be annihilated. and if all
others accepted the lie which the party imposed--if all records told the
same tale--then the lie passed into history and became truth. 'who controls
the past,' ran the party slogan, 'controls the future: who controls the
present controls the past.' and yet the past, though of its nature

ightened him, he was too much used to living without
women--he did not know the reason. the girl picked herself up and pulled a
bluebell out of her hair. she sat against him, putting her arm round his
waist.

'never mind, dear. there's no hurry. we've got the whole afternoon. isn't
this a splendid hide-out? i found it when i got lost once on a community
hike. if anyone was coming you could hear them a hundred metres away.'

'what is your name?' said winston.

'julia. i know yours. it's winston--winston smith.'

'how did you find that out?'

'i expect i'm better at finding things out than you are, dear. tell me,
what did you think of me before that day i gave you the note?'

he did not feel any temptation to tell lies to her. it was even a sort of
love-offering to start off by telling the worst.

'i hated the sight of you,' he said. 'i wanted to rape you and then murder
you afterwards. two weeks ago i thought seriously of smashing your head in
with a cobblestone. if you really want to know, i imagin

yet almost exactly the same--people who had never learned to think but who
were storing up in their hearts and bellies and muscles the power that
would one day overturn the world. if there was hope, it lay in the proles!
without having read to the end of the book, he knew that that must be
goldstein's final message. the future belonged to the proles. and could he
be sure that when their time came the world they constructed would not be
just as alien to him, winston smith, as the world of the party? yes,
because at the least it would be a world of sanity. where there is
equality there can be sanity. sooner or later it would happen, strength
would change into consciousness. the proles were immortal, you could not
doubt it when you looked at that valiant figure in the yard. in the end
their awakening would come. and until that happened, though it might be a
thousand years, they would stay alive against all the odds, like birds,
passing on from body to body the vit

ture.

so far as it could be contrived, everything that had or might have
political significance of any kind was fitted into the b vocabulary. the
name of every organization, or body of people, or doctrine, or country, or
institution, or public building, was invariably cut down into the familiar
shape; that is, a single easily pronounced word with the smallest number
of syllables that would preserve the original derivation. in the ministry
of truth, for example, the records department, in which winston smith
worked, was called recdep, the fiction department was called ficdep, the
teleprogrammes department was called teledep, and so on. this was not
done solely with the object of saving time. even in the early decades of
the twentieth century, telescoped words and phrases had been one of the
characteristic features of political language; and it had been noticed
that the tendency to use abbreviations of this kind was most marked in
totalitarian countries and totalitarian organizations. examples were
