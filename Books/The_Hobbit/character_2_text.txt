here the morning before. 
"carefully! carefully!" he said. "it is not like you, bilbo, to keep friends waiting on the 
mat, and then open the door like a pop-gun! let me introduce bifur, bofur, bombur, and 
especially thorin!" 
"at your service!" said bifur, bofur, and bombur standing in a row. then they hung up 
two yellow hoods and a pale green one; and also a sky-blue one with a long silver 
tassel. this last belonged to thorin, an enormously important dwarf, in fact no other than 
the great thorin oakenshield himself, who was not at all pleased at falling flat on bilbo's 

mat with bifur, bofur, and bombur on top of him. for one thing bombur was immensely 
fat and heavy. 
thorin indeed was very haughty, and said nothing about service; but poor mr. baggins 
said he was sorry so many times, that at last he grunted "pray don't mention it," and 
stopped frowning. 
"now we are all here!" said gandalf, looking at the row of thirteen hoods-the best 
detachable party hoods-and his own hat hanging on the pe

two..." said the wizard. 
"or two? i can only see one, and a little one at that," said beorn. 
"well to tell you the truth, i did not like to bother you with a lot of us, until i found out if 
you were busy. i will give a call, if i may." 
"go on, call away!" 
so gandalf gave a long shrill whistle, and presently thorin and dori came round the 
house by the garden path and stood bowing low before them. 
"one or three you meant, i see!" said beorn. "but these aren't hobbits, they are 
dwarves!" 
"thorin oakenshield, at your service! dori at your service!" said the two 
dwarves bowing again. 
"i don't need your service, thank you," said beorn, "but i expect you need mine. i am not 
over fond of dwarves; but if it is true you are thorin (son of thrain, son of thror, i 
believe), and that your companion is respectable, and that you are enemies of goblins 
and are not up to any mischief in my lands-what are you up to, by the way?" 
"they are on their way to visit the land of their fathers, away east beyond mi

ngs were 
filled with mirth. loud and clear and fair were those songs, and out stepped thorin into 
their midst. 
dead silence fell in the middle of a word. out went all light. the fires leaped up in black 
smokes. ashes and cinders were in the eyes of the dwarves, and the wood was filled 
again with their clamour and their cries. bilbo found himself running round and round (as 
he thought) and calling and calling: 
"dori, nori, ori, oin, gloin, fili, kili, bombur, bifur, bofur, dwalin, balin, 
thorin oakenshield," while people he could not see or feel were doing the same all 
round him (with an occasional "bilbo!" thrown in). but the cries of the others got steadily 
further and fainter, and though after a while it seemed to him they changed to yells and 
cries for help in the far distance, all noise at last died right away, and he was left alone in 
complete silence and darkness. 
that was one of his most miserable moments. but he soon made up his mind that it was 
no good trying to do anything till d

 the wood-elves. other folk 
were far away; and some of the younger people in the town openly doubted the 
existence of any dragon in the mountain, and laughed at the greybeards and gammers 
who said that they had seen him flying in the sky in their young days. that being so it is 
not surprising that the guards were drinking and laughing by a fire in their hut, and did 
not hear the noise of the unpacking of the dwarves or the footsteps of the four scouts. 
their astonishment was enormous when thorin oakenshield stepped in through the 
door. 
"who are you and what do you want?" they shouted leaping to their feet and gipping for 
weapons. 
"thorin son of thrain son of thror king under the mountain!" said the dwarf in a loud 
voice, and he looked it, in spite of his torn clothes and draggled hood. the gold gleamed 
on his neck and waist: his eyes were dark and deep. "i have come back. i wish to see 
the master of your town!" 
then there was tremendous excitement. some of the more foolish ran out of the h

circling flocks, and their swift-flying messengers flew here 
and there across the sky. 
above the borders of the forest there was whistling, crying and piping. far over 
mirkwood tidings spread: "smaug is dead!" leaves rustled and startled ears were lifted. 
even before the elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods 
of the misty mountains; beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
council in their caves. 
"that will be the last we shall hear of thorin oakenshield, i fear," said the king. "he 
would have done better to have remained my guest. it is an ill wind, all the same," he 
added, "that blows no one any good." for he too had not forgotten the legend of the 
wealth of thror. so it was that bard's messengers found him now marching with many 
spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick, above him, for they thought that 
war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age. but the 
king, when he received the prayers of ba

the treasure is ours!" 
they all sprang up and began to caper about for joy. 
"yes, dead," said rac. "the thrush, may his feathers never fall, saw him die, and we 
may trust his words. he saw him fall in battle with the men of esgaroth the third night 
back from now at the rising of the moon." 
it was some time before thorin could bring the dwarves to be silent and listen to the 
raven's news. at length when he had told all the tale of the battle he went on: 
"so much for joy, thorin oakenshield. you may go back to your halls in safety; all the 
treasure is yours-for the moment. but many are gathering hither beside the birds. the 
news of the death of the guardian has already gone far and wide, and the legend of the 
wealth of thror has not lost in the telling during many years; many are eager for a share 
of the spoil. already a host of the elves is on the way, and carrion birds are with them 
hoping for battle and slaughter. by the lake men murmur that their sorrows are due to

, well, i am willing to let it 
stand against all my claim, don't you know. i may be a burglar-or so they say: personally 
i never really felt like one-but i am an honest one, i hope, more or less. anyway i am 
going back now, and the dwarves can do what they like to me. i hope you will find it 
useful." 
the elvenking looked at bilbo with a new wonder. 
"bilbo baggins!" he said. "you are more worthy to wear the armour of elfprinces than 
many that have looked more comely in it. but i wonder if thorin oakenshield will see it 
so. i have more knowledge of dwarves in general than you have perhaps. i advise you to 
remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome." 
"thank you very much i am sure," said bilbo with a bow. "but i don't think i ought to 
leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. and i promised to 
wake old bombur at midnight, too! really i must be going, and quickly." 
nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as

ped without a wound; and there were few unharmed in all 
the host. 
when gandalf saw bilbo, he was delighted. "baggins!" he exclaimed. "well i never! alive 
after all - 1 am glad! i began to wonder if even your luck would see you through! a 
terrible business, and it nearly was disastrous. but other news can wait. come!" he said 
more gravely. "you are called for;" and leading the hobbit he took him within the tent. 
"hail! thorin," he said as he entered. "i have brought him." 
there indeed lay thorin oakenshield, wounded with many wounds, and his rent armour 
and notched axe were cast upon the floor. he looked up as bilbo came beside him. 
"farewell, good thief," he said. "i go now to the halls of waiting to sit beside my fathers, 
until the world is renewed. since i leave now all gold and silver, and go where it is of little 
worth, i wish to part in friendship from you, and i would take back my words and deeds 
at the gate." 
bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. "farewell, king under the mount

in the end he would only take two small chests, one filled with silver, and the other with 
gold, such as one strong pony could carry. "that will be quite as much as i can 
manage," said he. 
at last the time came for him to say good-bye to his friends. "farewell, balin!" he said; 
"and farewell, dwalin; and farewell dori, nori, ori, oin, gloin, bifur, bofur, and bombur! 
may your beards never grow thin!" and turning towards the mountain he added: 
"farewell thorin oakenshield! and fili and kili! may your memory never fade!" 
then the dwarves bowed low before their gate, but words stuck in their throats. "good-
bye and good luck, wherever you fare!" said balin at last. "if ever you visit us again, 
when our halls are made fair once more, then the feast shall indeed be splendid!" 
"if ever you are passing my way," said bilbo, "don't wait to knock! tea is at four; but any 
of you are welcome at any time!" 
then he turned away. 
the elf-host was on the march;. and if it
