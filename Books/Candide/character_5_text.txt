 only whipped i could put up with it, for i experienced that among the bulgarians; but oh, my dear pangloss! thou greatest of philosophers, that i should have seen you hanged, without knowing for what! oh, my dear anabaptist, thou best of men, that thou should'st have been drowned in the very harbour! oh, miss cunegonde, thou pearl of girls! that thou should'st have had thy belly ripped open!"[pg 25]

thus he was musing, scarce able to stand, preached at, whipped, absolved, and blessed, when an old woman accosted him saying:

"my son, take courage and follow me."[pg 26]

how the old woman took care of candide, and how he found the object he loved.

candide did not take courage, but followed the old woman to a decayed house, where she gave him a pot of pomatum to anoint his sores, showed him a very neat little bed, with a suit of clothes hanging up, and left him something to eat and drink.

"eat, drink, sleep," said she, "and may our lady of atocha,[9] the great st. anthony of padua, and th

e great st. james of compostella, receive you under their protection. i shall be back to-morrow."

candide, amazed at all he had suffered and still more with the charity of the old woman, wished to kiss her hand.

"it is not my hand you must kiss," said the old woman; "i shall be back to-morrow. anoint yourself with the pomatum, eat and sleep."

candide, notwithstanding so many disasters, ate and slept. the next morning the old woman brought him his breakfast, looked at his back, and rubbed it herself with another ointment: in[pg 27] like manner she brought him his dinner; and at night she returned with his supper. the day following she went through the very same ceremonies.

"who are you?" said candide; "who has inspired you with so much goodness? what return can i make you?"

the good woman made no answer; she returned in the evening, but brought no supper.

"come with me," she said, "and say nothing."

she took him by th

e arm, and walked with him about a quarter of a mile into the country; they arrived at a lonely house, surrounded with gardens and canals. the old woman knocked at a little door, it opened, she led candide up a private staircase into a small apartment richly furnished. she left him on a brocaded sofa, shut the door and went away. candide thought himself in a dream; indeed, that he had been dreaming unluckily all his life, and that the present moment was the only agreeable part of it all.

the old woman returned very soon, supporting with difficulty a trembling woman of a majestic figure, brilliant with jewels, and covered with a veil.

"take off that veil," said the old woman to candide.

the young man approaches, he raises the veil[pg 28] with a timid hand. oh! what a moment! what surprise! he believes he beholds miss cunegonde? he really sees her! it is herself! his strength fails him, he cannot utter a word, but drops at her feet. cunegonde falls upon the sofa. the old woman supplies a sme

lling bottle; they come to themselves and recover their speech. as they began with broken accents, with questions and answers interchangeably interrupted with sighs, with tears, and cries. the old woman desired they would make less noise and then she left them to themselves.

"what, is it you?" said candide, "you live? i find you again in portugal? then you have not been ravished? then they did not rip open your belly as doctor pangloss informed me?"

"yes, they did," said the beautiful cunegonde; "but those two accidents are not always mortal."

"but were your father and mother killed?"

"it is but too true," answered cunegonde, in tears.

"and your brother?"

"my brother also was killed."

"

sacre of my father, mother, and brother, with the insolence of the ugly bulgarian soldier, with the stab that he gave me, with my servitude under the bulgarian captain, with my hideous don issachar, with my abominable inquisitor, with the execution of doctor pangloss, with the grand miserere to[pg 34] which they whipped you, and especially with the kiss i gave you behind the screen the day that i had last seen you. i praised god for bringing you back to me after so many trials, and i charged my old woman to take care of you, and to conduct you hither as soon as possible. she has executed her commission perfectly well; i have tasted the inexpressible pleasure of seeing you again, of hearing you, of speaking with you. but you must be hungry, for myself, i am famished; let us have supper."

they both sat down to table, and, when supper was over, they placed themselves once more on the sofa; where they were when signor don issachar arrived. it was the jewish sabbath, and issachar had come to enjoy

, candide, the grand inquisitor, and the jew.

this issachar was the most choleric hebrew that had ever been seen in israel since the captivity in babylon.

"what!" said he, "thou bitch of a galilean, was not the inquisitor enough for thee? must this rascal also share with me?"

in saying this he drew a long poniard which he always carried about him; and not imagining that his adversary had any arms he threw himself upon candide: but our honest westphalian had received a handsome sword from the old woman along with the suit of clothes. he drew his rapier, despite his gentleness, and laid the israelite stone dead upon the cushions at cunegonde's feet.

"holy virgin!" cried she, "what will become of us? a man killed in my apartment! if the officers of justice come, we are lost!"

"had not pangloss been hanged," said candide, "he would give us good counsel in this[pg 36] emergency, for he was a profound philosopher. failing him let us consult the old woman."

she was very prudent and commenced to

give her opinion when suddenly another little door opened. it was an hour after midnight, it was the beginning of sunday. this day belonged to my lord the inquisitor. he entered, and saw the whipped candide, sword in hand, a dead man upon the floor, cunegonde aghast, and the old woman giving counsel.

at this moment, the following is what passed in the soul of candide, and how he reasoned:

if this holy man call in assistance, he will surely have me burnt; and cunegonde will perhaps be served in the same manner; he was the cause of my being cruelly whipped; he is my rival; and, as i have now begun to kill, i will kill away, for there is no time to hesitate. this reasoning was clear and instantaneous; so that without giving time to the inquisitor to recover from his surprise,

 he pierced him through and through, and cast him beside the jew.

"yet again!" said cunegonde, "now there is no mercy for us, we are excommunicated, our last hour has come. how could you do it? you, naturally so gentle, to slay a jew and a prelate in two minutes!"

"my beautiful young lady," responded candide,[pg 37] "when one is a lover, jealous and whipped by the inquisition, one stops at nothing."

the old woman then put in her word, saying:

"there are three andalusian horses in the stable with bridles and saddles, let the brave candide get them ready; madame has money, jewels; let us therefore mount quickly on horseback, though i can sit only on one buttock; let us set out for cadiz, it is the finest weather in the world, and there is great pleasure in travelling in the cool of the night."

immediately candide saddled the three horses, and cunegonde, the old woman and he, travelled thirty miles at a 
 
 ___________________________
 
stretch. while they were journeying, the holy brotherhood entered the house; my lord the inquisitor was interred in a handsome church, and issachar's body was thrown upon a dunghill.

candide, cunegonde, and the old woman, had now reached the little town of avacena in the midst of the mountains of the sierra morena, and were speaking as follows in a public inn.[pg 38]

x

in what distress candide, cunegonde, and the old woman arrived at cadiz; and of their embarkation.

"who was it that robbed me of my money and jewels?" said cunegonde, all bathed in tears. "how shall we live? what shall we do? where find inquisitors or jews who will give me more?"

"alas!" said the old woman, "i have a shrewd suspicion of a reverend grey friar, who stayed last night in the same inn with us at badajos. god preserve me from judging rashly, but he came into our room twice, and he set out upon his journey long before us."

"alas!" said
 
 ___________________________
 
ing to these principles the grey friar ought to have left us enough to carry us through our journey. have you nothing at all left, my dear cunegonde?"

"not a farthing," said she.

"what then must we do?" said candide.

"sell one of the horses," replied the old[pg 39] woman. "i will ride behind miss cunegonde, though i can hold myself only on one buttock, and we shall reach cadiz."

in the same inn there was a benedictine prior who bought the horse for a cheap price. candide, cunegonde, and the old woman, having passed through lucena, chillas, and lebrixa, arrived at length at cadiz. a fleet was there getting ready, and troops assembling to bring to reason the reverend jesuit fathers of paraguay, accused of having made one of the native tribes in the neighborhood of san sacrament revolt against the kings of spain and portugal. candide having been in the bulgarian service, performed the military exercise before the general of this little army with so graceful an address, with so intrepid an air,

 and with such agility and expedition, that he was given the command of a company of foot. now, he was a captain! he set sail with miss cunegonde, the old woman, two valets, and the two andalusian horses, which had belonged to the grand inquisitor of portugal.

during their voyage they reasoned a good deal on the philosophy of poor pangloss.

"we are going into another world," said candide; "and surely it must be there that all is for the best. for i must confess there is reason to complain a little of what passeth in[pg 40] our world in regard to both natural and moral philosophy."

"i love you with all my heart," said cunegonde; "but my soul is still
 
 ___________________________
 
 full of fright at that which i have seen and experienced."

"all will be well," replied candide; "the sea of this new world is already better than our european sea; it is calmer, the winds more regular. it is certainly the new world which is the best of all possible worlds."

"god grant it," said cunegonde; "but i have been so horribly unhappy there that my heart is almost closed to hope."

"you complain," said the old woman; "alas! you have not known such misfortunes as mine."

cunegonde almost broke out laughing, finding the good woman very amusing, for pretending to have been as unfortunate as she.

"alas!" said cunegonde, "my good mother, unless you have been ravished by two bulgarians, have received two deep wounds in your belly, have had two castles demolished, have had two mothers cut to pieces before your eyes, and two of your lovers whipped at an auto-da-fé, i do not conceive how you could be more unfortu

"miss," replied the old woman, "you do not[pg 41] know my birth; and were i to show you my backside, you would not talk in that manner, but would suspend your judgment."

this speech having raised extreme curiosity in the minds of cunegonde and candide, the old woman spoke to them as follows.[pg 42]

history of the old woman.

"i had not always bleared eyes and red eyelids; neither did my nose always touch my chin; nor was i always a servant. i am the daughter of pope urban x,[10] and of the princess of palestrina. until the age of fourteen i was brought up in a palace, to which all the castles of your german barons would scarcely have served for stables; and one of my robes was worth more than all the magnificence of westphalia. as i grew up i improved in beauty, wit, and every graceful accomplishment, in the mids

ed with fright, fatigue, horror, despair, and hunger. immediately after, my senses, overpowered, gave themselves up to sleep, which was yet more swooning than repose. i was in this state of weakness and insensibility, between life and[pg 47] death, when i felt myself pressed by something that moved upon my body. i opened my eyes, and saw a white man, of good countenance, who sighed, and who said between his teeth: 'o che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni!'"[12][pg 48]

the adventures of the old woman continued.

"astonished and delighted to hear my native language, and no less surprised at what this man said, i made answer that there were much greater misfortunes than that of which he complained. i told him in a few words of the horrors which i had endured, and fainted a second time. he carried me to a neighbouring house, put me to bed, gave me food, waited upon me, consoled me, flattered me; he told me that he had never seen any one so beautiful as i, and that he never so much regretted th

uch; 'i go to embark for ceuta, and will take you to italy. ma che sciagura d'essere senza coglioni!'

"i thanked him with tears of commiseration; and instead of taking me to italy he conducted me to algiers, where he sold me to the dey. scarcely was i sold, than the plague which had made the tour of africa, asia, and europe, broke out with great malignancy in algiers. you have seen earthquakes; but pray, miss, have you ever had the plague?"

"never," answered cunegonde.

"if you had," said the old woman, "you would acknowledge that it is far more terrible[pg 50] than an earthquake. it is common in africa, and i caught it. imagine to yourself the distressed situation of the daughter of a pope, only fifteen years old, who, in less than three months, had felt the miseries of poverty and slavery, had been ravished almost every day, had beheld her mother drawn in quarters, had experienced famine and war, and was dying of the plague in algiers. i did not die, however, but my eunuch, and the dey, and

ll stories on board a ship in order to pass away the time. in short, miss cunegonde, i have had experience, i know the world; therefore i advise you to divert yourself, and prevail upon each passenger to tell his story; and if there be one of them all, that has not cursed his life many a time, that has not frequently looked upon himself as the unhappiest of mortals, i give you leave to throw me headforemost into the sea."[pg 54]

xiii

how candide was forced away from his fair cunegonde and the old woman.

the beautiful cunegonde having heard the old woman's history, paid her all the civilities due to a person of her rank and merit. she likewise accepted her proposal, and engaged all the passengers, one after the other, to relate their adventures; and then both she and candide allowed that the old woman was in the right.

"it is a great pity," said candide, "that the sage pangloss was hanged contrary to custom at an auto-da-fé; he would tell us most amazing things in regard to the physical and
 
 ___________________________
 
 moral evils that overspread earth and sea, and i should be able, with due respect, to make a few objections."

while each passenger was recounting his story, the ship made her way. they landed at buenos ayres. cunegonde, captain candide, and the old woman, waited on the governor, don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza. this nobleman had a stateliness becoming a person who bore so many[pg 55] names. he spoke to men with so noble a disdain, carried his nose so loftily, raised his voice so unmercifully, assumed so imperious an air, and stalked with such intolerable pride, that those who saluted him were strongly inclined to give him a good drubbing. cunegonde appeared to him the most beautiful he had ever met. the fi

to sanction our marriage."

don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza, turning up his moustachios, smiled mockingly, and ordered captain candide to go and review his company. candide obeyed, and the governor remained alone with miss cunegonde. he declared his passion, protesting he would marry her the next day in the face of the church, or otherwise, just as should be agreeable to herself. cunegonde[pg 56] asked a quarter of an hour to consider of it, to consult the old woman, and to take her resolution.

the old woman spoke thus to cunegonde:

"miss, you have seventy-two quarterings, and not a farthing; it is now in your power to be wife to the greatest lord in south america, who has very beautiful moustachios. is it for you to pique yourself upon inviolable fidelity? you have been ravished by bulgarians; a jew and an inquisitor have enjoyed your favours. misfortune gives sufficient excuse. i own, that if i were in your place, i should have no scruple in marrying t

he governor and in making the fortune of captain candide."

while the old woman spoke with all the prudence which age and experience gave, a small ship entered the port on board of which were an alcalde and his alguazils, and this was what had happened.

as the old woman had shrewdly guessed, it was a grey friar who stole cunegonde's money and jewels in the town of badajos, when she and candide were escaping. the friar wanted to sell some of the diamonds to a jeweller; the jeweller knew them to be the grand inquisitor's. the friar before he was hanged confessed he had stolen them. he described the persons, and the route they had taken. the flight of cunegonde[pg 57] and candide was already known. they were traced to cadiz. a vessel was immediately sent in pursu

it of them. the vessel was already in the port of buenos ayres. the report spread that the alcalde was going to land, and that he was in pursuit of the murderers of my lord the grand inquisitor. the prudent old woman saw at once what was to be done.

"you cannot run away," said she to cunegonde, "and you have nothing to fear, for it was not you that killed my lord; besides the governor who loves you will not suffer you to be ill-treated; therefore stay."

she then ran immediately to candide.

"fly," said she, "or in an hour you will be burnt."

there was not a moment to lose; but how could he part from cunegonde, and where could he flee for shelter?[pg 58]

xiv

how candide and cacambo were received by the 
 
 ___________________________
 
jesuits of paraguay.

candide had brought such a valet with him from cadiz, as one often meets with on the coasts of spain and in the american colonies. he was a quarter spaniard, born of a mongrel in tucuman; he had been singing-boy, sacristan, sailor, monk, pedlar, soldier, and lackey. his name was cacambo, and he loved his master, because his master was a very good man. he quickly saddled the two andalusian horses.

"come, master, let us follow the old woman's advice; let us start, and run without looking behind us."

candide shed tears.

"oh! my dear cunegonde! must i leave you just at a time when the governor was going to sanction our nuptials? cunegonde, brought to such a distance what will become of you?"

"she will do as well as she can," said cacambo; "the women are never at a loss, god provides for them, let us run."

"whither art thou carrying me? where shall[pg 59] we go? what shall we do without cunegonde?" said candide.

"by st. james of

 over the world; they may assist us; god will perhaps have pity on us."

it was not easy to get to cayenne; they knew vaguely in which direction to go, but rivers, precipices, robbers, savages, obstructed them all the way. their horses died of fatigue. their provisions were consumed; they fed a whole[pg 75] month upon wild fruits, and found themselves at last near a little river bordered with cocoa trees, which sustained their lives and their hopes.

cacambo, who was as good a counsellor as the old woman, said to candide:

"we are able to hold out no longer; we have walked enough. i see an empty canoe near the river-side; let us fill it with cocoanuts, throw ourselves into it, and go with the current; a river always leads to some inhabited spot. if we do not find pleasant things we shall at least find new things."

"with all my heart," said candide, "let us recommend ourselves to providence."

have not killed an inquisitor, they will have no suspicion of you; i'll get another ship, and go and wait for you at venice; that's a free country, where there is no danger either from bulgarians, abares, jews, or inquisitors."

cacambo applauded this wise resolution. he despaired at parting from so good a master, who had become his intimate friend; but the pleasure of serving him prevailed over the pain of leaving him. they embraced with tears;[pg 93] candide charged him not to forget the good old woman. cacambo set out that very same day. this cacambo was a very honest fellow.

candide stayed some time longer in surinam, waiting for another captain to carry him and the two remaining sheep to italy. after he had hired domestics, and purchased everything necessary for a long voyage, mynheer vanderdendur, captain of a large vessel, came and offered his services.

"how much will you charge," said he to this man, "to carry me straight to venice—me, my servants, my baggage, and these two sheep?"

he best, marked out about one-twentieth of them who seemed to be sociable men, and who all pretended to merit his preference. he assembled them at his inn, and gave them a supper on condition that each took an oath to relate his history faithfully, promising to choose him who appeared to be most justly[pg 96] discontented with his state, and to bestow some presents upon the rest.

they sat until four o'clock in the morning. candide, in listening to all their adventures, was reminded of what the old woman had said to him in their voyage to buenos ayres, and of her wager that there was not a person on board the ship but had met with very great misfortunes. he dreamed of pangloss at every adventure told to him.

"this pangloss," said he, "would be puzzled to demonstrate his system. i wish that he were here. certainly, if all things are good, it is in el dorado and not in the rest of the world."

at length he made choice of a poor man of letters, who had worked ten years for the booksellers of amst

e hundred leagues from here, and i wait for an answer."

the abbé listened attentively, and seemed to be in a brown study. he soon took his leave of the two foreigners after a most tender embrace. the following day candide received, on awaking, a letter couched in these terms:

"my very dear love, for eight days i have been ill in this town. i learn that you are here. i would fly to your arms if i could but move. i was informed of your passage at bordeaux, where i left faithful cacambo and the old woman, who are to follow me very soon. the governor of buenos ayres has taken all, but[pg 118] there remains to me your heart. come! your presence will either give me life or kill me with pleasure."

this charming, this unhoped-for letter transported candide with an inexpressible joy, and the illness of his dear cunegonde overwhelmed him with grief. divided between those two passions, he took his gold and his diamonds and hurried away, with martin, to the hotel where miss cunegonde was lodged. he ent

e reduced to so abject a state with the five or six millions that you took to her?"

"ah!" said cacambo, "was i not to give two millions to senor don fernando d'ibaraa, y figueora, y mascarenes, y lampourdos, y souza, governor of buenos ayres, for permitting miss cunegonde to come away? and did[pg 150] not a corsair bravely rob us of all the rest? did not this corsair carry us to cape matapan, to milo, to nicaria, to samos, to petra, to the dardanelles, to marmora, to scutari? cunegonde and the old woman serve the prince i now mentioned to you, and i am slave to the dethroned sultan."

"what a series of shocking calamities!" cried candide. "but after all, i have some diamonds left; and i may easily pay cunegonde's ransom. yet it is a pity that she is grown so ugly."

then, turning towards martin: "who do you think," said he, "is most to be pitied—the sultan achmet, the emperor ivan, king charles edward, or i?"

"how should i know!" answered martin. "i must see into your hearts to be able to t

 my dear pangloss," said candide to him, "when you had been hanged, dissected, whipped, and were tugging at the oar, did you always think that everything happens for the best?"

"i am still of my first opinion," answered pangloss, "for i am a philosopher and i cannot[pg 158] retract, especially as leibnitz could never be wrong; and besides, the pre-established harmony is the finest thing in the world, and so is his plenum and materia subtilis."[pg 159]

xxix

how candide found cunegonde and the old woman again.

while candide, the baron, pangloss, martin, and cacambo were relating their several adventures, were reasoning on the contingent or non-contingent events of the universe, disputing on effects and causes, on moral and physical evil, on liberty and necessity, and on the consolations a slave may feel even on a turkish galley, they arrived at the house of the transylvanian prince on the banks of the propontis. the first objects which met their sight were cunegonde and the old woman hanging 
 
 ___________________________
 
towels out to dry.

the baron paled at this sight. the tender, loving candide, seeing his beautiful cunegonde embrowned, with blood-shot eyes, withered neck, wrinkled cheeks, and rough, red arms, recoiled three paces, seized with horror, and then advanced out of good manners. she embraced candide and her brother; they embraced the old woman, and candide ransomed them both.

there was a small farm in the neighbourhood[pg 160] which the old woman proposed to candide to make a shift with till the company could be provided for in a better manner. cunegonde did not know she had grown ugly, for nobody had told her of it; and she reminded candide of his promise in so positive a tone that the good man durst not refuse her. he therefore intimated to the baron that he intended marrying his sister.

"i will not suffer," said the baron, "such meanness on her part, and such insolence on yours; i will never be reproached with this scandalous thing;

the faithful cacambo. pangloss drew up an excellent memorial, wherein he proved that the baron had no right over his sister, and that according to all the laws of the empire, she might marry candide with her left hand. martin was for throwing the baron into the sea; cacambo decided that it would be better to deliver him up again to the captain of the galley, after which they thought to send him back to the general father of the order at rome by the first ship. this advice was well received, the old woman approved it; they said not a word to his sister; the thing was executed for a little money, and they had the double pleasure of entrapping a jesuit, and punishing the pride of a german baron.[pg 162]

it is natural to imagine that after so many disasters candide married, and living with the philosopher pangloss, the philosopher martin, the prudent cacambo, and the old woman, having besides brought so many diamonds from the country of the ancient incas, must have led a very happy life. but he wa

s so much imposed upon by the jews that he had nothing left except his small farm; his wife became uglier every day, more peevish and unsupportable; the old woman was infirm and even more fretful than cunegonde. cacambo, who worked in the garden, and took vegetables for sale to constantinople, was fatigued with hard work, and cursed his destiny. pangloss was in despair at not shining in some german university. for martin, he was firmly persuaded that he would be as badly off elsewhere, and therefore bore things patiently. candide, martin, and pangloss sometimes disputed about morals and metaphysics. they often saw passing under the windows of their farm 
 
 ___________________________
 
boats full of effendis, pashas, and cadis, who were going into banishment to lemnos, mitylene, or erzeroum. and they saw other cadis, pashas, and effendis coming to supply the place of the exiles, and afterwards exiled in their turn. they saw heads decently impaled for presentation to the sublime porte. such spectacles as these increased the number[pg 163] of their dissertations; and when they did not dispute time hung so heavily upon their hands, that one day the old woman ventured to say to them:

"i want to know which is worse, to be ravished a hundred times by negro pirates, to have a buttock cut off, to run the gauntlet among the bulgarians, to be whipped and hanged at an auto-da-fé, to be dissected, to row in the galleys—in short, to go through all the miseries we have undergone, or to stay here and have nothing to do?"

"it is a great question," said candide.

this discourse gave rise to new reflections, and martin especially concluded that man was born

 placed in the garden of eden, he was put there ut operaretur eum, that he might cultivate it; which shows that man was not born to be idle."

"let us work," said martin, "without disputing; it is the only way to render life tolerable."

the whole little society entered into this laudable design, according to their different abilities. their little plot of land produced plentiful crops. cunegonde was, indeed, very ugly, but she became an excellent pastry cook; paquette worked at embroidery; the old woman looked after the[pg 168] linen. they were all, not excepting friar giroflée, of some service or other; for he made a good joiner, and became a very honest man.

pangloss sometimes said to candide:

"there is a concatenation of events in this best of all possible worlds: for if you had not been kicked out of a magnificent castle for love of miss cunegonde: if you had not been put into the inquisition: if you had not walked over america: if you had not stabbed the baron: if you had not lost all
