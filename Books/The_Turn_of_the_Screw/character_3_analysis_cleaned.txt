[CHARACTER] 
like miles, [CHARACTER] might be either angelic or diabolical.
she appears to be a completely wonderful little girl, even preternaturally
so, well behaved and a pleasure to be around. the governess thinks
[CHARACTER] possesses "extraordinary charm" and is the "most beautiful
child" she has laid eyes on. [CHARACTER] seems, however, to have a personality
quite distinct from these glowing descriptions. when the governess
questions [CHARACTER] as to why she had been looking out the window, [CHARACTER]'s
explanation is evasive and unsatisfying. [CHARACTER]'s next turn at the window
turns out to be, according to miles, part of a scheme to show the
governess that miles can be "bad." at this point, the governess
has already assumed [CHARACTER] to be conniving and deceptive, but this
is the first instance in which [CHARACTER] seems to be exhibiting unambiguous
deceit. the story remains inconclusive, however, and we never know
for sure what [CHARACTER] and miles are up to. [CHARACTER] may very well be
the innocent child the governess thought her to be, her strange,
diabolical turns existing only in the governess's mind.
