rth's spinning around on its axis. when any object spins, points
on the axis of rotation itself—like the central point of a spinning frisbee—do not move. if something
is truly pointlike, though, it has no "other points" that lie off of any purported spin axis. and so it
would  appear  that  there  simply  is  no  notion  of  a  point  object  spinning.  many  years  ago,  such
reasoning fell prey to yet another quantum-mechanical surprise.

in 1925, the dutch physicists george uhlenbeck and samuel goudsmit realized that a wealth of
puzzling data having to do with properties of light emitted and absorbed by atoms could be explained
if electrons were assumed to have very particular magnetic properties. some hundred years earlier,
the  frenchman andre-marie ampère  had  shown  that  magnetism  arises  from  the  motion  of  electric
charge. uhlenbeck and goudsmit followed this lead and found that only one specific sort of electron
motion could give rise to the magnetic properties suggested by the da
