 have had any hand in the mischief.

the way dinah washed her childrenâ€™s faces was this: first she held the
poor thing down by its ear with one paw, and then with the other paw she
rubbed its face all over, the wrong way, beginning at the nose: and
just now, as i said, she was hard at work on the white kitten, which was
lying quite still and trying to purr--no doubt feeling that it was all
meant for its good.

but the black kitten had been finished with earlier in the afternoon,
and so, while alice was sitting curled up in a corner of the great
arm-chair, half talking to herself and half asleep, the kitten had been
having a grand game of romps with the ball of worsted alice had been
trying to wind up, and had been rolling it up and down till it had all
come undone again; and there it was, spread over the hearth-rug, all
knots and tangles, with the kitten running after its own tail in the
middle.

â€˜oh, you wicked little thing!â€™ cried alice, catching up the kitten, and
giving it a littl

 manage--and then she
scrambled back into the arm-chair, taking the kitten and the worsted
with her, and began winding up the ball again. but she didnâ€™t get on
very fast, as she was talking all the time, sometimes to the kitten, and
sometimes to herself. kitty sat very demurely on her knee, pretending to
watch the progress of the winding, and now and then putting out one
paw and gently touching the ball, as if it would be glad to help, if it
might.

â€˜do you know what to-morrow is, kitty?â€™ alice began. â€˜youâ€™d have guessed
if youâ€™d been up in the window with me--only dinah was making you tidy,
so you couldnâ€™t. i was watching the boys getting in sticks for the
bonfire--and it wants plenty of sticks, kitty! only it got so cold, and
it snowed so, they had to leave off. never mind, kitty, weâ€™ll go and
see the bonfire to-morrow.â€™ here alice wound two or three turns of the
worsted round the kittenâ€™s neck, just to see how it would look: this led
to a scramble, in which the ball r

olled down upon the floor, and yards
and yards of it got unwound again.

â€˜do you know, i was so angry, kitty,â€™ alice went on as soon as they were
comfortably settled again, â€˜when i saw all the mischief you had been
doing, i was very nearly opening the window, and putting you out into
the snow! and youâ€™d have deserved it, you little mischievous darling!
what have you got to say for yourself? now donâ€™t interrupt me!â€™ she
went on, holding up one finger. â€˜iâ€™m going to tell you all your faults.
number one: you squeaked twice while dinah was washing your face this
morning. now you canâ€™t deny it, kitty

ainst the window-panes, kitty? how nice and soft
it sounds! just as if some one was kissing the window all over outside.
i wonder if the snow loves the trees and fields, that it kisses them so
gently? and then it covers them up snug, you know, with a white quilt;
and perhaps it says, â€œgo to sleep, darlings, till the summer comes
again.â€ and when they wake up in the summer, kitty, they dress
themselves all in green, and dance about--whenever the wind blows--oh,
thatâ€™s very pretty!â€™ cried alice, dropping the ball of worsted to clap
her hands. â€˜and i do so wish it was true! iâ€™m sure the woods look sleepy
in the autumn, when the leaves are getting brown.

â€˜kitty, can you play chess? now, donâ€™t smile, my dear, iâ€™m asking it
seriously. because, when we were playing just now, you watched just as
if you understood it: and when i said â€œcheck!â€ you purred! well, it was
a nice check, kitty, and really i might have won, if it hadnâ€™t been for
that nasty knight, that came wiggling

 down among my pieces. kitty, dear,
letâ€™s pretend--â€™ and here i wish i could tell you half the things alice
used to say, beginning with her favourite phrase â€˜letâ€™s pretend.â€™ she
had had quite a long argument with her sister only the day before--all
because alice had begun with â€˜letâ€™s pretend weâ€™re kings and queens;â€™ and
her sister, who liked being very exact, had argued that they couldnâ€™t,
because there were only two of them, and alice had been reduced at last
to say, â€˜well, you can be one of them then, and iâ€™ll be all the rest.â€™
and once she had really frightened her old nurse by shouting suddenly in
her ear, â€˜nurse! do letâ€™s pretend that iâ€™m a hungry hyaena, and youâ€™re a
bone.â€™

but this is taking us away from aliceâ€™s speech to the kitten. â€˜letâ€™s
pretend that youâ€™re the red queen, kitty! do you know, i think if you
sat up and folded your arms, youâ€™d look exactly like her. now do try,
thereâ€™s a de
 
 ___________________________
 
ar!â€™ and alice got the red queen off the table, and set it
up before the kitten as a model for it to imitate: however, the thing
didnâ€™t succeed, principally, alice said, because the kitten wouldnâ€™t
fold its arms properly. so, to punish it, she held it up to the
looking-glass, that it might see how sulky it was--â€˜and if youâ€™re not
good directly,â€™ she added, â€˜iâ€™ll put you through into looking-glass
house. how would you like that?â€™

â€˜now, if youâ€™ll only attend, kitty, and not talk so much, iâ€™ll tell you
all my ideas about looking-glass house. first, thereâ€™s the room you can
see through the glass--thatâ€™s just the same as our drawing ro

 got, oh! such beautiful things in it!
letâ€™s pretend thereâ€™s a way of getting through into it, somehow, kitty.
letâ€™s pretend the glass has got all soft like gauze, so that we can get
through. why, itâ€™s turning into a sort of mist now, i declare! itâ€™ll be
easy enough to get through--â€™ she was up on the chimney-piece while she
said this, though she hardly knew how she had got there. and certainly
the glass was beginning to melt away, just like a bright silvery mist.

in another moment alice was through the glass, and had jumped lightly
down into the looking-glass room. the very first thing she did was
to look whether there was a fire in the fireplace, and she was quite
pleased to find that there was a real one, blazing away as brightly as
the one she had left behind. â€˜so i shall be as warm here as i was in the
old room,â€™ thought alice: â€˜warmer, in fact, because thereâ€™ll be no one
here to scold me away from the fire. oh, what fun itâ€™ll be, when they
see me through the gla
 
 ___________________________
 
ere, and canâ€™t get at me!â€™

then she began looking about, and noticed that what could be seen from
the old room was quite common and uninteresting, but that all the rest
was as different as possible. for instance, the pictures on the
wall next the fire seemed to be all alive, and the very clock on
the chimney-piece (you know you can only see the back of it in the
looking-glass) had got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.

â€˜they donâ€™t keep this room so tidy as the other,â€™ alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little â€˜oh!â€™ of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. the chessmen were walking
about, two and two!

â€˜here are the red king and the red queen,â€™ alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), â€˜and there are the white king and the white
queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--i donâ€™
 
 ___________________________
 
t think they can hear me,â€™ she went on, as she
put her head closer down, â€˜and iâ€™m nearly sure they canâ€™t see me. i feel
somehow as if i were invisible--â€™

here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

â€˜it is the voice of my child!â€™ the white queen cried out as she rushed
past the king, so violently that she knocked him over among the cinders.
â€˜my precious lily! my imperial kitten!â€™ and she began scrambling wildly
up the side of the fender.

â€˜imperial fiddlestick!â€™ said the king, rubbing his nose, which had been

t by the fall. he had a right to be a little annoyed with the queen,
for he was covered with ashes from head to foot.

alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

the queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little lily in silence. as soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the white king, who was sitting
sulkily among the a

shes, â€˜mind the volcano!â€™

â€˜what volcano?â€™ said the king, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one.

â€˜blew--me--up,â€™ panted the queen, who was still a little out of breath.
â€˜mind you come up--the regular way--donâ€™t get blown up!â€™

alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said, â€˜why, youâ€™ll be hours and hours getting to the
table, at that rate. iâ€™d far better help you, hadnâ€™t i?â€™ but the king
took no notice of the question: it was quite clear that he could neither
hear her nor see her.

so alice picked him up very gently, and lifted him across more slowly
than she had lifted the queen, that she mightnâ€™t take his breath away:
but, before she put him on the table, she th
 
 ___________________________
 
th laughing that she nearly let
him drop upon the floor.

â€˜oh! please donâ€™t make such faces, my dear!â€™ she cried out, quite
forgetting that the king couldnâ€™t hear her. â€˜you make me laugh so that
i can hardly hold you! and donâ€™t keep your mouth so wide open! all the
ashes will get into it--there, now i think youâ€™re tidy enough!â€™ she
added, as she smoothed his hair, and set him upon the table near the
queen.

the king immediately fell flat on his back, and lay perfectly still: and
alice was a little alarmed at what she had done, and went round the room
to see if she could find any water to throw over him. however, she could
find nothing but a bottle of ink, and when she got back with it she
found he had recovered, and he and the queen were talking together in a
frightened whisper--so low, that alice could hardly hear what they said.

the king was saying, â€˜i assure, you my dear, i turned cold to the very
ends of my whiskers!â€™

to which the queen replied, â€˜you havenâ€™t go
 
 ___________________________
 
t any whiskers.â€™

â€˜the horror of that moment,â€™ the king went on, â€˜i shall never, never
forget!â€™

â€˜you will, though,â€™ the queen said, â€˜if you donâ€™t make a memorandum of
it.â€™

alice looked on with great interest as the king took an enormous
memorandum-book out of his pocket, and began writing. a sudden thought
struck her, and she took hold of the end of the pencil, which came some
way over his shoulder, and began writing for him.

the poor king looked puzzled and unhappy, and struggled with the pencil
for some time without saying anything; but alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out, â€˜my dear! i really must get a thinner pencil.
i canâ€™t manage this one

a bit; it writes all manner of things that i
donâ€™t intend--â€™

â€˜what manner of things?â€™ said the queen, looking over the book (in which
alice had put â€˜the white knight is sliding down the poker. he balances
very badlyâ€™) â€˜thatâ€™s not a memorandum of your feelings!â€™

there was a book lying near alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the white king (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
â€˜--for itâ€™s all in some language i donâ€™t know,â€™ she said to herself.

it was like this.

she puzzled over this for some time, but at last a bright thought struck
her. â€˜why, itâ€™s a looking-glass book, of course! and if i hold it up to
a glass, the words will all go the right way again.â€™

this was the poem that alice read.

â€˜it seems very pretty,â€™ she said when she had finished it, â€˜but itâ€™s
rather hard to understand!â€™ (you see she didnâ€™t like to confess, even
to herself, that she couldnâ€™t make it out at all.) â€˜somehow it seems
to fill my head with ideas--only i donâ€™t exactly know what they are!
however, somebody killed something: thatâ€™s clear, at any rate--â€™

â€˜but oh!â€™ thought alice, suddenly jumping up, â€˜if i donâ€™t make haste i
shall have to go back through the looking-glass, before iâ€™ve seen what
the rest of the house is like! letâ€™s have a look at the garden first!â€™
she was out of the room in a moment, and ran down stairs--or, at least,
it wasnâ€™t exactly running, but a new invention of hers for getting down
stairs quickly and easily, as alice said to herself. she just kept the
tips of her fingers on the hand-rail, and floated gently down without
even touching
 
 ___________________________
 
 the stairs with her feet; then she floated on through the
hall, and would have gone straight out at the door in the same way, if
she hadnâ€™t caught hold of the door-post. she was getting a little giddy
with so much floating in the air, and was rather glad to find herself
walking again in the natural way.




chapter ii. the garden of live flowers

â€˜i should see the garden far better,â€™ said alice to herself, â€˜if i could
get to the top of that hill: and hereâ€™s a path that leads straight to
it--at least, no, it doesnâ€™t do that--â€™ (after going a few yards along
the path, and turning several sharp corners), â€˜but i suppose it will
at last. but how curiously it twists! itâ€™s more like a corkscrew than a
path! well, this turn goes to the hill, i suppose--no, it doesnâ€™t! this
goes straight back to the house! well then, iâ€™ll try it the other way.â€™

and so she did: wandering up a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd down, and trying turn after turn, but
always coming back to the house, do what she would. indeed, once, when
she turned a corner rather more quickly than usual, she ran against it
before she could stop herself.

â€˜itâ€™s no use talking about it,â€™ alice said, looking up at the house and
pretending it was arguing with her. â€˜iâ€™m not going in again yet. i know
i should have to get through the looking-glass again--back into the old
room--and thereâ€™d be an end of all my adventures!â€™

so, resolutely turning her back upon the house, she set out once more
down the path, determined to keep straight on till she got to the hill.
for a few minutes all went on well, and she was just saying, â€˜i really
shall do it this time--â€™ when the path gave 
 
 ___________________________
 
a sudden twist and shook
itself (as she described it afterwards), and the next moment she found
herself actually walking in at the door.

â€˜oh, itâ€™s too bad!â€™ she cried. â€˜i never saw such a house for getting in
the way! never!â€™

however, there was the hill full in sight, so there was nothing to be
done but start again. this time she came upon a large flower-bed, with a
border of daisies, and a willow-tree growing in the middle.

â€˜o tiger-lily,â€™ said alice, addressing herself to one that was waving
gracefully about in the wind, â€˜i wish you could talk!â€™

â€˜we can talk,â€™ said the tiger-lily: â€˜when thereâ€™s anybody worth talking
to.â€™

alice was so astonished that she could not speak for a minute: it quite
seemed to take her breath away. at length, as the tiger-lily only went
on waving about, she spoke again, in a timid voice--almost in a whisper.
â€˜and can all the flowers talk?â€™

â€˜as well as you can,â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜and a
 
 ___________________________
 
 great deal louder.â€™

â€˜it isnâ€™t manners for us to begin, you know,â€™ said the rose, â€˜and i
really was wondering when youâ€™d speak! said i to myself, â€œher face has
got some sense in it, though itâ€™s not a clever one!â€ still, youâ€™re the
right colour, and that goes a long way.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t care about the colour,â€™ the tiger-lily remarked. â€˜if only her
petals curled up a little more, sheâ€™d be all right.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like being criticised, so she began asking questions.
â€˜arenâ€™t you sometimes frightened at being planted out here, with nobody
to take care of you?â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s the tree in the middle,â€™ said the rose: â€˜what else is it good
for?â€™

â€˜but what could it do, if any danger came?â€™ alice asked.

â€˜it says â€œbough-wough!â€â€™ cried a daisy: â€˜thatâ€™s why its branches are
called boughs!â€™

â€˜didnâ€™t you know that?â€™ cried another daisy, and here they all began
shouting t
 
 ___________________________
 
ogether, till the air seemed quite full of little shrill
voices. â€˜silence, every one of you!â€™ cried the tiger-lily, waving itself
passionately from side to side, and trembling with excitement. â€˜they
know i canâ€™t get at them!â€™ it panted, bending its quivering head towards
alice, â€˜or they wouldnâ€™t dare to do it!â€™

â€˜never mind!â€™ alice said in a soothing tone, and stooping down to the
daisies, who were just beginning again, she whispered, â€˜if you donâ€™t
hold your tongues, iâ€™ll pick you!â€™

there was silence in a moment, and several of the pink daisies turned
white.

â€˜thatâ€™s right!â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜the daisies are worst of all. when
one speaks, they all begin together, and itâ€™s enough to make one wither
to hear the way they go on!â€™

â€˜how is it you can all talk so nicely?â€™ alice said, hoping to get i

t
into a better temper by a compliment. â€˜iâ€™ve been in many gardens before,
but none of the flowers could talk.â€™

â€˜put your hand down, and feel the ground,â€™ said the tiger-lily. â€˜then
youâ€™ll know why.â€™

alice did so. â€˜itâ€™s very hard,â€™ she said, â€˜but i donâ€™t see what that has
to do with it.â€™

â€˜in most gardens,â€™ the tiger-lily said, â€˜they make the beds too soft--so
that the flowers are always asleep.â€™

this sounded a very good reason, and alice was quite pleased to know it.
â€˜i never thought of that before!â€™ she said.

â€˜itâ€™s my opinion that you never think at all,â€™ the rose said in a rather
severe tone.

â€˜i never saw anybody that looked stupider,â€™ a violet said, so suddenly,
that alice quite jumped; for it hadnâ€™t spoken before.

â€˜hold your tongue!â€™ cried the tiger-lily. â€˜as if you ever saw anybody!
you keep your head under the leaves, and snore away there, till you know
no more whatâ€™s going on in the world, than
 
 ___________________________
 
 if you were a bud!â€™

â€˜are there any more people in the garden besides me?â€™ alice said, not
choosing to notice the roseâ€™s last remark.

â€˜thereâ€™s one other flower in the garden that can move about like you,â€™
said the rose. â€˜i wonder how you do it--â€™ (â€˜youâ€™re always wondering,â€™
said the tiger-lily), â€˜but sheâ€™s more bushy than you are.â€™

â€˜is she like me?â€™ alice asked eagerly, for the thought crossed her mind,
â€˜thereâ€™s another little girl in the garden, somewhere!â€™

â€˜well, she has the same awkward shape as you,â€™ the rose said, â€˜but sheâ€™s
redder--and her petals are shorter, i think.â€™

â€˜her petals are done up close, almost like a dahlia,â€™ the tiger-lily
interrupted: â€˜not tumbled about anyhow, like yours.â€™

â€˜but thatâ€™s not your fault,â€™ the rose added kindly: â€˜youâ€™re beginning
to fade, you know--and then one canâ€™t help o
 
 ___________________________
 
neâ€™s petals getting a little
untidy.â€™

alice didnâ€™t like this idea at all: so, to change the subject, she asked
â€˜does she ever come out here?â€™

â€˜i daresay youâ€™ll see her soon,â€™ said the rose. â€˜sheâ€™s one of the thorny
kind.â€™

â€˜where does she wear the thorns?â€™ alice asked with some curiosity.

â€˜why all round her head, of course,â€™ the rose replied. â€˜i was wondering
you hadnâ€™t got some too. i thought it was the regular rule.â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s coming!â€™ cried the larkspur. â€˜i hear her footstep, thump, thump,
thump, along the gravel-walk!â€™

alice looked round eagerly, and found that it was the red queen. â€˜sheâ€™s
grown a good deal!â€™ was her first remark. she had indeed: when alice
first found her in the ashes, she had been only three inches high-
 
 ___________________________
 
-and
here she was, half a head taller than alice herself!

â€˜itâ€™s the fresh air that does it,â€™ said the rose: â€˜wonderfully fine air
it is, out here.â€™

â€˜i think iâ€™ll go and meet her,â€™ said alice, for, though the flowers were
interesting enough, she felt that it would be far grander to have a talk
with a real queen.

â€˜you canâ€™t possibly do that,â€™ said the rose: â€˜_i_ should advise you to
walk the other way.â€™

this sounded nonsense to alice, so she said nothing, but set off at
once towards the red queen. to her surprise, she lost sight of her in a
moment, and found herself walking in at the front-door again.

a little provoked, she drew back, and after looking everywhere for the
queen (whom she spied out at last, a long way off), she thought she
would try the plan, this time, of walking in the opposite direction.

it succeeded beautifully. she had not been walking a minute before she
found herself face to face with the red queen, 
 
 ___________________________
 
and full in sight of the
hill she had been so long aiming at.

â€˜where do you come from?â€™ said the red queen. â€˜and where are you going?
look up, speak nicely, and donâ€™t twiddle your fingers all the time.â€™

alice attended to all these directions, and explained, as well as she
could, that she had lost her way.

â€˜i donâ€™t know what you mean by your way,â€™ said the queen: â€˜all the ways
about here belong to me--but why did you come out here at all?â€™ she
added in a kinder tone. â€˜curtsey while youâ€™re thinking what to say, it
saves time.â€™

alice wondered a little at this, but she was too much in awe of the
queen to disbelieve it. â€˜iâ€™ll try it when i go home,â€™ she thought to
herself, â€˜the 
 
 ___________________________
 
next time iâ€™m a little late for dinner.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s time for you to answer now,â€™ the queen said, looking at her watch:
â€˜open your mouth a little wider when you speak, and always say â€œyour
majesty.â€â€™

â€˜i only wanted to see what the garden was like, your majesty--â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s right,â€™ said the queen, patting her on the head, which alice
didnâ€™t like at all, â€˜though, when you say â€œgarden,â€--iâ€™ve seen gardens,
compared with which this would be a wilderness.â€™

alice didnâ€™t dare to argue the point, but went on: â€˜--and i thought iâ€™d
try and find my way to the top of that hill--â€™

â€˜when you say â€œhill,â€â€™ the queen interrupted, â€˜_i_ could show you hills,
in comparison with which youâ€™d call that a valley.â€™

â€˜no, i shouldnâ€™t,â€™ said alice, surprised into contradicting her at last:
â€˜a hill canâ€™t be a valley, you know. that would be nonsense--â€™

the red queen shook her head, â€˜you may call it â€œnonsenseâ€ if you like,â€™
she said
 
 ___________________________
 
, â€˜but iâ€™ve heard nonsense, compared with which that would be as
sensible as a dictionary!â€™

alice curtseyed again, as she was afraid from the queenâ€™s tone that she
was a little offended: and they walked on in silence till they got to
the top of the little hill.

for some minutes alice stood without speaking, looking out in all
directions over the country--and a most curious country it was. there
were a number of tiny little brooks running straight across it from side
to side, and the ground between was divided up into squares by a number
of little green hedges, that reached from brook to brook.

â€˜i declare itâ€™s marked out just like a large chessboard!â€™ alice said at
last. â€˜there ought to be some men moving about somewhere--and so there
are!â€™ she added in a tone of 
 
 ___________________________
 
 i wouldnâ€™t mind being
a pawn, if only i might join--though of course i should like to be a
queen, best.â€™

she glanced rather shyly at the real queen as she said this, but her
companion only smiled pleasantly, and said, â€˜thatâ€™s easily managed. you
can be the white queenâ€™s pawn, if you like, as lilyâ€™s too young to
play; and youâ€™re in the second square to begin with: when you get to
the eighth square youâ€™ll be a queen--â€™ just at this moment, somehow or
other, they began to run.

alice never could quite make out, in thinking it over afterwards, how it
was that they began: all she remembers is, that they were running hand
in hand, and the queen went so fast that it was all she could do to keep
up with her: and still the queen kept crying â€˜faster! faster!â€™ but alice
felt she could not go faster, though she had not breath left to say so.

the most curious part of the thing was, that the trees and the other
things round them never changed their places at all: however fast the

y
went, they never seemed to pass anything. â€˜i wonder if all the things
move along with us?â€™ thought poor puzzled alice. and the queen seemed to
guess her thoughts, for she cried, â€˜faster! donâ€™t try to talk!â€™

not that alice had any idea of doing that. she felt as if she would
never be able to talk again, she was getting so much out of breath: and
still the queen cried â€˜faster! faster!â€™ and dragged her along. â€˜are we
nearly there?â€™ alice managed to pant out at last.

â€˜nearly there!â€™ the queen repeated. â€˜why, we passed it ten minutes ago!
faster!â€™ and they ran on for a time in silence, with the wind whistling
in aliceâ€™s ears, and almost blowing her hair off her head, she fancied.

â€˜now! now!â€™ cried the queen. â€˜faster! faster!â€™ and they went so fast
that at last they seemed to skim through the air, hardly touching the
ground with their feet, till suddenly, just as alice was getting quite
exhausted, they stopped,

 and she found herself sitting on the ground,
breathless and giddy.

the queen propped her up against a tree, and said kindly, â€˜you may rest
a little now.â€™

alice looked round her in great surprise. â€˜why, i do believe weâ€™ve been
under this tree the whole time! everythingâ€™s just as it was!â€™

â€˜of course it is,â€™ said the queen, â€˜what would you have it?â€™

â€˜well, in our country,â€™ said alice, still panting a little, â€˜youâ€™d
generally get to somewhere else--if you ran very fast for a long time,
as weâ€™ve been doing.â€™

â€˜a slow sort of country!â€™ said the queen. â€˜now, here, you see, it takes
all the running you can do, to keep in the same place. if you want to
get somewhere else, you must run at least twice as fast as that!â€™

â€˜iâ€™d rather not try, please!â€™ said alice. â€˜iâ€™m quite content to stay
here--only i am so hot and thirsty!â€™

â€˜i know what youâ€™d like!â

€™ the queen said good-naturedly, taking a little
box out of her pocket. â€˜have a biscuit?â€™

alice thought it would not be civil to say â€˜no,â€™ though it wasnâ€™t at all
what she wanted. so she took it, and ate it as well as she could: and it
was very dry; and she thought she had never been so nearly choked in all
her life.

â€˜while youâ€™re refreshing yourself,â€™ said the queen, â€˜iâ€™ll just take
the measurements.â€™ and she took a ribbon out of her pocket, marked in
inches, and began measuring the ground, and sticking little pegs in here
and there.

â€˜at the end of two yards,â€™ she
 
 ___________________________
 
 said, putting in a peg to mark the
distance, â€˜i shall give you your directions--have another biscuit?â€™

â€˜no, thank you,â€™ said alice: â€˜oneâ€™s quite enough!â€™

â€˜thirst quenched, i hope?â€™ said the queen.

alice did not know what to say to this, but luckily the queen did not
wait for an answer, but went on. â€˜at the end of three yards i shall
repeat them--for fear of your forgetting them. at the end of four, i
shall say good-bye. and at the end of five, i shall go!â€™

she had got all the pegs put in by this time, and alice looked on
with great interest as she returned to the tree, and then began slowly
walking down the row.

at the two-yard peg she faced round, and said, â€˜a pawn goes two squares

 its first move, you know. so youâ€™ll go very quickly through the third
square--by railway, i should think--and youâ€™ll find yourself in the
fourth square in no time. well, that square belongs to tweedledum and
tweedledee--the fifth is mostly water--the sixth belongs to humpty
dumpty--but you make no remark?â€™

â€˜i--i didnâ€™t know i had to make one--just then,â€™ alice faltered out.

â€˜you should have said, â€œitâ€™s extremely kind of you to tell me all
thisâ€--however, weâ€™ll suppose it said--the seventh square is all
forest--however, one of the knights will show you the way--and in the
eighth square we shall be queens together, and itâ€™s all feasting and
fun!â€™ alice got up and curtseyed, and sat down again.

at the next peg the queen turned again, and this time she said, â€˜speak
in french when you canâ€™t think of the english for a thing--turn out yo

toes as you walk--and remember who you are!â€™ she did not wait for alice
to curtsey this time, but walked on quickly to the next peg, where she
turned for a moment to say â€˜good-bye,â€™ and then hurried on to the last.

how it happened, alice never knew, but exactly as she came to the last
peg, she was gone. whether she vanished into the air, or whether she
ran quickly into the wood (â€˜and she can run very fast!â€™ thought alice),
there was no way of guessing, but she was gone, and alice began to
remember that she was a pawn, and that it would soon be time for her to
move.




chapter iii. looking-glass insects

of course the first thing to do was to make a grand survey of the
country she was going to travel through. â€˜itâ€™s something very like
learning geography,â€™ thought alice, as she stood on tiptoe in hopes of
being able to see a little further. â€˜principal rivers--there are none.
principal mountains--iâ€™m on the only one, but i donâ€™t think itâ€™s got any
name. prin

cipal towns--why, what are those creatures, making honey down
there? they canâ€™t be bees--nobody ever saw bees a mile off, you know--â€™
and for some time she stood silent, watching one of them that was
bustling about among the flowers, poking its proboscis into them, â€˜just
as if it was a regular bee,â€™ thought alice.

however, this was anything but a regular bee: in fact it was an
elephant--as alice soon found out, though the idea quite took her breath
away at first. â€˜and what enormous flowers they must be!â€™ was her next
idea. â€˜something like cottages with the roofs taken off, and stalks put
to them--and what quantities of honey they must make! i think iâ€™ll go
down and--no, i wonâ€™t just yet,â€™ she went on, checking herself just as
she was beginning to run down the hill, and trying to find some excuse
for turning shy so suddenly. â€˜itâ€™ll never do to go down among them
without

so with this excuse she ran down the hill and jumped over the first of
the six little brooks.

â€˜tickets, please!â€™ said the guard, putting his head in at the window.
in a moment everybody was holding out a ticket: they were about the same
size as the people, and quite seemed to fill the carriage.

â€˜now then! show your ticket, child!â€™ the guard went on, looking angrily
at alice. and a great many voices all said together (â€˜like the chorus of
a song,â€™ thought alice), â€˜donâ€™t keep him waiting, child! why, his time
is worth a thousand pounds a minute!â€™

â€˜iâ€™m afraid i havenâ€™t got one,â€™ alice said in a frightened tone: â€˜there
wasnâ€™t a ticket-office where i came from.â€™ and again the chorus of
voices went on. â€˜there wasnâ€™t room for one where she came from. the land
there is worth a thousand pounds an inch!â€™

â€˜donâ€™t make excuses,â€™ said the gu

ard: â€˜you should have bought one from
the engine-driver.â€™ and once more the chorus of voices went on with â€˜the
man that drives the engine. why, the smoke alone is worth a thousand
pounds a puff!â€™

alice thought to herself, â€˜then thereâ€™s no use in speaking.â€™ the
voices didnâ€™t join in this time, as she hadnâ€™t spoken, but to her
great surprise, they all thought in chorus (i hope you understand what
thinking in chorus means--for i must confess that _i_ donâ€™t), â€˜better
say nothing at all. language is worth a thousand pounds a word!â€™

â€˜i shall dream about a thousand pounds tonight, i know i shall!â€™ thought
alice.

all this time the guard was looking at her, first through a telesc

 way sheâ€™s going, even if
she doesnâ€™t know her own name!â€™

a goat, that was sitting next to the gentleman in white, shut his
eyes and said in a loud voice, â€˜she ought to know her way to the
ticket-office, even if she doesnâ€™t know her alphabet!â€™

there was a beetle sitting next to the goat (it was a very queer
carriage-full of passengers altogether), and, as the rule seemed to be
that they should all speak in turn, he went on with â€˜sheâ€™ll have to go
back from here as luggage!â€™

alice couldnâ€™t see who was sitting beyond the beetle, but a hoarse voice
spoke next. â€˜change engines--â€™ it said, and was obliged to leave off.

â€˜it sounds like a horse,â€™ alice thought to herself. and an extremely
small voice, close to her ear, said, â€˜you might make a joke on
that--something about â€œhorseâ€ and â€œhoarse,â€ you know.â€™

then a very gentle voice in the distance said, â€˜she must be labelled
â€œlass, with care,â€ you know--â€™

and after that other voices went on (â€˜wh
 
 ___________________________
 
at a number of people there are
in the carriage!â€™ thought alice), saying, â€˜she must go by post, as sheâ€™s
got a head on her--â€™ â€˜she must be sent as a message by the telegraph--â€™
â€˜she must draw the train herself the rest of the way--â€™ and so on.

but the gentleman dressed in white paper leaned forwards and whispered
in her ear, â€˜never mind what they all say, my dear, but take a
return-ticket every time the train stops.â€™

â€˜indeed i shanâ€™t!â€™ alice said rather impatiently. â€˜i donâ€™t belong to
this railway journey at all--i was in a wood just now--and i wish i
could get back there.â€™

â€˜you might make a joke on that,â€™ said the little voice close to her ear:
â€˜something about â€œyou would if you could,â€ you know.â€™

â€˜donâ€™t tease so,â€™ said alice, looking about in vain to see where the
voice came from; â€˜if youâ€™re so anxious to have a joke made, why donâ€™t
you make one yourself?â€™

the little voice sighed deeply: it was 
 
 ___________________________
 
very unhappy, evidently, and
alice would have said something pitying to comfort it, â€˜if it would only
sigh like other people!â€™ she thought. but this was such a wonderfully
small sigh, that she wouldnâ€™t have heard it at all, if it hadnâ€™t come
quite close to her ear. the consequence of this was that it tickled her
ear very much, and quite took off her thoughts from the unhappiness of
the poor little creature.

â€˜i know you are a friend,â€™ the little voice went on; â€˜a dear friend, and
an old friend. and you wonâ€™t hurt
 
 ___________________________
 
 me, though i am an insect.â€™

â€˜what kind of insect?â€™ alice inquired a little anxiously. what she
really wanted to know was, whether it could sting or not, but she
thought this wouldnâ€™t be quite a civil question to ask.

â€˜what, then you donâ€™t--â€™ the little voice began, when it was drowned by
a shrill scream from the engine, and everybody jumped up in alarm, alice
among the rest.

the horse, who had put his head out of the window, quietly drew it in
and said, â€˜itâ€™s only a brook we have to jump over.â€™ everybody seemed
satisfied with this, though alice felt a little nervous at the idea of
trains jumping at all. â€˜however, itâ€™ll take us into the fourth square,
thatâ€™s some comfort!â€™ she said to herself. in another moment she felt
the carriage rise straight up into the air, and in her fright she caught
at the thing nearest to her hand, which happ

ened to be the goatâ€™s beard.

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

but the beard seemed to melt away as she touched it, and she found
herself sitting quietly under a tree--while the gnat (for that was the
insect she had been talking to) was balancing itself on a twig just over
her head, and fanning her with its wings.

it certainly was a very large gnat: â€˜about the size of a chicken,â€™ alice
thought. still, she couldnâ€™t feel nervous with it, after they had been
talking together so long.

â€˜--then you donâ€™t like all insects?â€™ the gnat went on, as quietly as if
nothing had happened.

â€˜i like them when they can talk,â€™ alice said. â€˜none of them ever talk,
where _i_ come from.â€™

â€˜what sort of insects do you rejoice in, where you come from?â€™ the gnat
inquired.

â€˜i donâ€™t rejoice in insects at all,â€™ alice explained, â€˜because iâ€™m
rather afraid of them--at least 
 
 ___________________________
 
the large kinds. but i can tell you the
names of some of them.â€™

â€˜of course they answer to their names?â€™ the gnat remarked carelessly.

â€˜i never knew them to do it.â€™

â€˜whatâ€™s the use of their having names,â€™ the gnat said, â€˜if they wonâ€™t
answer to them?â€™

â€˜no use to them,â€™ said alice; â€˜but itâ€™s useful to the people who name
them, i suppose. if not, why do things have names at all?â€™

â€˜i canâ€™t say,â€™ the gnat replied. â€˜further on, in the wood down there,
theyâ€™ve got no names--however, go on with your list of insects: youâ€™re
wasting time.â€™

â€˜well, thereâ€™s the horse-fly,â€™ alice began, counting off the names on
her fingers.

â€˜all right,â€™ said the gnat: â€˜half way up that bush, youâ€™ll see a
rocking-horse-fly, if you look. itâ€™s made entirely of wo

od, and gets
about by swinging itself from branch to branch.â€™

â€˜what does it live on?â€™ alice asked, with great curiosity.

â€˜sap and sawdust,â€™ said the gnat. â€˜go on with the list.â€™

alice looked up at the rocking-horse-fly with great interest, and made
up her mind that it must have been just repainted, it looked so bright
and sticky; and then she went on.

â€˜and thereâ€™s the dragon-fly.â€™

â€˜look on the branch above your head,â€™ said the gnat, â€˜and there youâ€™ll
find a snap-dragon-fly. its body is made of plum-pudding, its wings of
holly-leaves, and its head is a raisin burning in brandy.â€™

â€˜and what does it live on?â€™

â€˜frumenty and mince pie,â€™ the gnat replied
 
 ___________________________
 
; â€˜and it makes its nest in a
christmas box.â€™

â€˜and then thereâ€™s the butterfly,â€™ alice went on, after she had taken
a good look at the insect with its head on fire, and had thought to
herself, â€˜i wonder if thatâ€™s the reason insects are so fond of flying
into candles--because they want to turn into snap-dragon-flies!â€™

â€˜crawling at your feet,â€™ said the gnat (alice drew her feet back in
some alarm), â€˜you may observe a bread-and-butterfly. its wings are thin
slices of bread-and-butter, its body is a crust, and its head is a lump
of sugar.â€™

â€˜and what does it live on?â€™

â€˜weak tea with cream in it.â€™

a new difficulty came into aliceâ€™s head. â€˜supposing it couldnâ€™t find
any?â€™ she suggested.

â€˜then it would die, of course.â€™

â€˜but that must happen very often,â€™ alice remarked thoughtfully.

â€˜it always happens,â€™ said the gnat.

afte
 
 ___________________________
 
r this, alice was silent for a minute or two, pondering. the gnat
amused itself meanwhile by humming round and round her head: at last
it settled again and remarked, â€˜i suppose you donâ€™t want to lose your
name?â€™

â€˜no, indeed,â€™ alice said, a little anxiously.

â€˜and yet i donâ€™t know,â€™ the gnat went on in a careless tone: â€˜only think
how convenient it would be if you could manage to go home without it!
for instance, if the governess wanted to call you to your lessons, she
would call out â€œcome here--,â€ and there she would have to leave off,
because there wouldnâ€™t be any name for her to call, and of course you
wouldnâ€™t have to go, you know.â€™

â€˜that would never do, iâ€™m sure,â€™ said alice: â€˜the governess 
 
 ___________________________
 
would never
think of excusing me lessons for that. if she couldnâ€™t remember my name,
sheâ€™d call me â€œmiss!â€ as the servants do.â€™

â€˜well, if she said â€œmiss,â€ and didnâ€™t say anything more,â€™ the gnat
remarked, â€˜of course youâ€™d miss your lessons. thatâ€™s a joke. i wish you
had made it.â€™

â€˜why do you wish _i_ had made it?â€™ alice asked. â€˜itâ€™s a very bad one.â€™

but the gnat only sighed deeply, while two large tears came rolling down
its cheeks.

â€˜you shouldnâ€™t make jokes,â€™ alice said, â€˜if it makes you so unhappy.â€™

then came another of those melancholy little sighs, and this time the
poor gnat really seemed to have sighed itself away, for, when alice
looked up, there was nothing whatever to be seen on the twig, and, as
she was getting quite chilly with sitting still so long, she got up and
walked on.

she
 
 ___________________________
 
 very soon came to an open field, with a wood on the other side of
it: it looked much darker than the last wood, and alice felt a little
timid about going into it. however, on second thoughts, she made up her
mind to go on: â€˜for i certainly wonâ€™t go back,â€™ she thought to herself,
and this was the only way to the eighth square.

â€˜this must be the wood,â€™ she said thoughtfully to herself, â€˜where
things have no names. i wonder whatâ€™ll become of my name when i go in?
i shouldnâ€™t like to lose it at all--because theyâ€™d have to give me
another, and it would be almost certain to be an ugly one. but then
th

e fun would be trying to find the creature that had got my old
name! thatâ€™s just like the advertisements, you know, when people lose
dogs--â€œanswers to the name of â€˜dash:â€™ had on a brass collarâ€--just fancy
calling everything you met â€œalice,â€ till one of them answered! only they
wouldnâ€™t answer at all, if they were wise.â€™

she was rambling on in this way when she reached the wood: it looked
very cool and shady. â€˜well, at any rate itâ€™s a great comfort,â€™ she
said as she stepped under the trees, â€˜after being so hot, to get into
the--into what?â€™ she went on, rather surprised at not being able to
think of the word. â€˜i mean to get under the--under the--under this, you
know!â€™ putting her hand on the trunk of the tree.
 
 ___________________________
 
 â€˜what does it call
itself, i wonder? i do believe itâ€™s got no name--why, to be sure it
hasnâ€™t!â€™

she stood silent for a minute, thinking: then she suddenly began again.
â€˜then it really has happened, after all! and now, who am i? i will
remember, if i can! iâ€™m determined to do it!â€™ but being determined
didnâ€™t help much, and all she could say, after a great deal of puzzling,
was, â€˜l, i know it begins with l!â€™

just then a fawn came wandering by: it looked at alice with its large
gentle eyes, but didnâ€™t seem at all frightened. â€˜here then! here then!â€™
alice said, as she held out her hand and tried to stroke it; but it only
started back a little, and then stood looking at her again.

â€˜what do you call yourself?â€™ the fawn said at last. such a soft sweet
voice it had!

â€˜i wish i knew!â€™ thought poor alice. she answered, rather sadly,
â€˜nothing, just now.â€™

â€˜think again,â€™ it said: â€˜that wonâ€™t do.â€™

alice thought, but nothing came of i
 
 ___________________________
 
t. â€˜please, would you tell me
what you call yourself?â€™ she said timidly. â€˜i think that might help a
little.â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll tell you, if youâ€™ll move a little further on,â€™ the fawn said. â€˜i
canâ€™t remember here.â€™

so they walked on together though the wood, alice with her arms clasped
lovingly round the soft neck of the fawn, till they came out into
another open field, and here the fawn gave a sudden bound into the air,
and shook itself free from aliceâ€™s arms. â€˜iâ€™m a fawn!â€™ it cried out in a
voice of delight, â€˜and, dear me! youâ€™re a human child!â€™ a sudden look of
alarm came into its beautiful brown eyes, and in another moment it had
darted away at full speed.

alice stood looking after it, almost ready to cry with vexation at
having lost her dear little fellow-traveller so suddenly. â€˜however, i
know my name now.â€™ she said, â€˜thatâ€™s some comfort. alice--alice--i wonâ€™t
forget it again. and now, which of these finger-posts
 
 ___________________________
 
 ought i to follow,
i wonder?â€™

it was not a very difficult question to answer, as there was only one
road through the wood, and the two finger-posts both pointed along it.
â€˜iâ€™ll settle it,â€™ alice said to herself, â€˜when the road divides and they
point different ways.â€™

but this did not seem likely to happen. she went on and on, a long way,
but wherever the road divided there were sure to be two finger-posts
pointing the same way, one marked â€˜to tweedledumâ€™s houseâ€™ and the other
â€˜to the house of tweedledee.â€™

â€˜i do believe,â€™ said alice at last, â€˜that they live in the same house! i
wonder i never thought of that before--but i canâ€™t stay there long. iâ€™ll
just call an
 
 ___________________________
 
 say â€œhow dâ€™you do?â€ and ask them the way out of the wood.
if i could only get to the eighth square before it gets dark!â€™ so she
wandered on, talking to herself as she went, till, on turning a sharp
corner, she came upon two fat little men, so suddenly that she could not
help starting back, but in another moment she recovered herself, feeling
sure that they must be.




chapter iv. tweedledum and tweedledee

they were standing under a tree, each with an arm round the otherâ€™s
neck, and alice knew which was which in a moment, because one of them
had â€˜dumâ€™ embroidered on his collar, and the other â€˜dee.â€™ â€˜i suppose
theyâ€™ve each got â€œtweedleâ€ round at the back of the collar,â€™ she said to
herself.

they stood so still that she quite forgot they were alive, and she was
just looking round to see if the word â€œtweedleâ€ was written at the back
of each collar, when she was startled by a voice coming from the one
marked â€˜dum.â€™

â€˜if you think weâ€™re wax-works,â€™ he
 
 ___________________________
 
 said, â€˜you ought to pay, you know.
wax-works werenâ€™t made to be looked at for nothing, nohow!â€™

â€˜contrariwise,â€™ added the one marked â€˜dee,â€™ â€˜if you think weâ€™re alive,
you ought to speak.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure iâ€™m very sorry,â€™ was all alice could say; for the words of the
old song kept ringing through her head like the ticking of a clock, and
she could hardly help saying them out loud:--


     â€˜tweedledum and tweedledee
      agreed to have a battle;
     for tweedledum said tweedledee
      had spoiled his nice new rattle.

     just then flew down a monstrous crow,
      as black as a tar-barrel;
     which frightened both the heroes so,
      they quite forgot their quarrel.â€™

â€˜i know what youâ€™re thinking about,â€™ sai
 
 ___________________________
 
d tweedledum: â€˜but it isnâ€™t so,
nohow.â€™

â€˜contrariwise,â€™ continued tweedledee, â€˜if it was so, it might be; and if
it were so, it would be; but as it isnâ€™t, it ainâ€™t. thatâ€™s logic.â€™

â€˜i was thinking,â€™ alice said very politely, â€˜which is the best way out
of this wood: itâ€™s getting so dark. would you tell me, please?â€™

but the little men only looked at each other and grinned.

they looked so exactly like a couple of great schoolboys, that alice
couldnâ€™t help pointing her finger at tweedledum, and saying â€˜first boy!â€™

â€˜nohow!â€™ tweedledum cried out briskly, and shut his mouth up again with
a snap.

â€˜next boy!â€™ said alice, passing on to tweedledee, though she felt quite
certain he would only shout out â€˜contrariwise!â€™ and so he did.

â€˜youâ€™ve been wrong!â€™ cried tweedledum. â€˜the first thing in a visit is to
say â€œhow dâ€™ye do?â€ and shake hands!â€™ and here the two brothers gave each
other a hug, and then they h

eld out the two hands that were free, to
shake hands with her.

alice did not like shaking hands with either of them first, for fear
of hurting the other oneâ€™s feelings; so, as the best way out of the
difficulty, she took hold of both hands at once: the next moment they
were dancing round in a ring. this seemed quite natural (she remembered
afterwards), and she was not even surprised to hear music playing: it
seemed to come from the tree under which they were dancing, and it was
done (as well as she could make it out) by the branches rubbing one
across the othe

r, like fiddles and fiddle-sticks.

â€˜but it certainly was funny,â€™ (alice said afterwards, when she was
telling her sister the history of all this,) â€˜to find myself singing
â€œhere we go round the mulberry bush.â€ i donâ€™t know when i began it, but
somehow i felt as if iâ€™d been singing it a long long time!â€™

the other two dancers were fat, and very soon out of breath. â€˜four times
round is enough for one dance,â€™ tweedledum panted out, and they left
off dancing as suddenly as they had begun: the music stopped at the same
moment.

then they let go of aliceâ€

™s hands, and stood looking at her for a
minute: there was a rather awkward pause, as alice didnâ€™t know how to
begin a conversation with people she had just been dancing with. â€˜it
would never do to say â€œhow dâ€™ye do?â€ now,â€™ she said to herself: â€˜we seem
to have got beyond that, somehow!â€™

â€˜i hope youâ€™re not much tired?â€™ she said at last.

â€˜nohow. and thank you very much for asking,â€™ said tweedledum.

â€˜so much obliged!â€™ added tweedledee. â€˜you like poetry?â€™

â€˜ye-es, pretty well--some poetry,â€™ alice said doubtfully. â€˜would you
tell me which road lea

ds out of the wood?â€™

â€˜what shall i repeat to her?â€™ said tweedledee, looking round at
tweedledum with great solemn eyes, and not noticing aliceâ€™s question.

â€˜â€œthe walrus and the carpenterâ€ is the longest,â€™ tweedledum replied,
giving his brother an affectionate hug.

tweedledee began instantly:

       â€˜the sun was shining--â€™

here alice ventured to interrupt him. â€˜if itâ€™s very long,â€™ she said, as
politely as she could, â€˜would you please tell me first which road--â€™

tweedledee smiled gently, and began again:

     â€˜the sun was shining on the sea,
      shining with all his might:
     he did his very best to make
      the billows smooth and bright--
     and this was odd, because it was
      the middle of the night.

     the moon was shining sulkily,

     â€œi weep for you,â€ the walrus said.
      â€œi deeply sympathize.â€
      with sobs and tears he sorted out
      those of the largest size.
     holding his pocket handkerchief
      before his streaming eyes.

     â€œo oysters,â€ said the carpenter.
      â€œyouâ€™ve had a pleasant run!
     shall we be trotting home again?â€
       but answer came there none--
     and that was scarcely odd, because
      theyâ€™d eaten every one.â€™

â€˜i like the walrus best,â€™ said alice: â€˜because you see he was a little
sorry for the poor oysters.â€™

â€˜he ate more than the carpenter, though,â€™ said tweedledee. â€˜you see he
held his handkerchief in front, so that the carpenter couldnâ€™t count how
many he took: contrariwise.â€™

â€˜that was mean!â€™ alice said indignantly. â€˜then i like the carpenter
best--if he didnâ€™t eat so many as the walrus.â€™

â€˜but he ate as many as he could get,â€™ said tweedledum.

this was a puzzler. after a pause, alice began, â€˜well! they

 were both

at hearing something that sounded to her like the puffing of a large
steam-engine in the wood near them, though she feared it was more likely
to be a wild beast. â€˜are there any lions or tigers about here?â€™ she
asked timidly.

â€˜itâ€™s only the red king snoring,â€™ said tweedledee.

â€˜come and look at him!â€™ the brothers cried, and they each took one of
aliceâ€™s hands, and led her up to where the king was sleeping.

â€˜isnâ€™t he a lovely sight?â€™ said tweedledum.

alice couldnâ€™t say honestly that he was. he had a tall red night-cap on,
with a tassel, and he was lying crumpled up into a sort of untidy heap,
and snoring loud--â€˜fit to snore his head off!â€™ as tweedledum remarked.

â€˜iâ€™m afraid heâ€™ll catch cold with lying on the damp grass,â€™ said alice,
who was a very thoughtful little girl.

â€˜heâ€™s dreaming now,â€™ said tweedledee: â€
 
 ___________________________
 
˜and what do you think heâ€™s
dreaming about?â€™

alice said â€˜nobody can guess that.â€™

â€˜why, about you!â€™ tweedledee exclaimed, clapping his hands triumphantly.
â€˜and if he left off dreaming about you, where do you suppose youâ€™d be?â€™

â€˜where i am now, of course,â€™ said alice.

â€˜not you!â€™ tweedledee retorted contemptuously. â€˜youâ€™d be nowhere. why,
youâ€™re only a sort of thing in his dream!â€™

â€˜if that there king was to wake,â€™ added tweedledum, â€˜youâ€™d go
out--bang!--just like a candle!â€™

â€˜i shouldnâ€™t!â€™ alice exclaimed indignantly. â€˜besides, if iâ€™m only a sort
of thing in his dream, what are you, i should like to know?â€™

â€˜dittoâ€™ said tweedledum.

â€˜ditto, dittoâ€™ cried tweedledee.

he shouted this so loud that alice couldnâ€™t hel

p saying, â€˜hush! youâ€™ll
be waking him, iâ€™m afraid, if you make so much noise.â€™

â€˜well, it no use your talking about waking him,â€™ said tweedledum, â€˜when
youâ€™re only one of the things in his dream. you know very well youâ€™re
not real.â€™

â€˜i am real!â€™ said alice and began to cry.

â€˜you wonâ€™t make yourself a bit realler by crying,â€™ tweedledee remarked:
â€˜thereâ€™s nothing to cry about.â€™

â€˜if i wasnâ€™t real,â€™ alice said--half-laughing through her tears, it all
seemed so ridiculous--â€˜i shouldnâ€™t be able to cry.â€™

â€˜i hope you donâ€™t suppose those are real tears?â€™ tweedledum interrupted
in a tone of great contempt.

â€˜i know theyâ€™re talking nonsense,â€™ alice thought to herself: â€˜and itâ€™s
foolish to cry about it.â€™ so she brushed away her tears, and went on as
cheerfully as she could. â€˜at any rate iâ€™d better be getting out of the
wood, for really itâ€™s coming on very dark. do you thin

k itâ€™s going to
rain?â€™

tweedledum spread a large umbrella over himself and his brother, and
looked up into it. â€˜no, i donâ€™t think it is,â€™ he said: â€˜at least--not
under here. nohow.â€™

â€˜but it may rain outside?â€™

â€˜it may--if it chooses,â€™ said tweedledee: â€˜weâ€™ve no objection.
contrariwise.â€™

â€˜selfish things!â€™ thought alice, and she was just going to say
â€˜good-nightâ€™ and leave them, when tweedledum sprang out from under the
umbrella and seized her by the wrist.

â€˜do you see that?â€™ he said, in a voice choking with passion, and
his eyes grew large and yellow all in a moment, as he pointed with a
trembling finger at a small white thing lying under the tree.

â€˜itâ€™s only a rattle,â€™ alice said, after a careful examination of the
little white thing. â€˜not a rattlesnake, you know,â€™ she added hastily,

king that he was frightened: â€˜only an old rattle--quite old and
broken.â€™

â€˜i knew it was!â€™ cried tweedledum, beginning to stamp about wildly and
tear his hair. â€˜itâ€™s spoilt, of course!â€™ here he looked at tweedledee,
who immediately sat down on the ground, and tried to hide himself under
the umbrella.

alice laid her hand upon his arm, and said in a soothing tone, â€˜you
neednâ€™t be so angry about an old rattle.â€™

â€˜but it isnâ€™t old!â€™ tweedledum cried, in a greater fury than ever. â€˜itâ€™s
new, i tell you--i bought it yesterday--my nice new rattle!â€™ and his
voice rose to a perfect scream.

all this time tweedledee was trying his best to fold up the umbrella,
with himself in it: which was such an extraordinary thing to do, that it
quite took off aliceâ€™s attention from the angry brother.

 but he couldnâ€™t
quite succeed, and it ended in his rolling over, bundled up in the
umbrella, with only his head out: and there he lay, opening and shutting
his mouth and his large eyes--â€˜looking more like a fish than anything
else,â€™ alice thought.

â€˜of course you agree to have a battle?â€™ tweedledum said in a calmer
tone.

â€˜i suppose so,â€™ the other sulkily replied, as he crawled out of the
umbrella: â€˜only she must help us to dress up, you know.â€™

so the two brothers went off hand-in-hand into the wood, and returned
in a minute with their arms full of things--such as bolsters, blankets,
hearth-rugs, table-cloths, dish-covers and coal-scuttles. â€˜i hope youâ€™re
a good hand at pinning and tying strings?â€™ tweedledum r

emarked. â€˜every
one of these things has got to go on, somehow or other.â€™

alice said afterwards she had never seen such a fuss made about anything
in all her life--the way those two bustled about--and the quantity of
things they put on--and the trouble they gave her in tying strings and
fastening buttons--â€˜really theyâ€™ll be more like bundles of old clothes
than anything else, by the time theyâ€™re ready!â€™ she said to herself, as
she arranged a bolster round the neck of tweedledee, â€˜to keep his head
from being cut off,â€™ as he said.

â€˜you know,â€™ he added very g
 
 ___________________________
 
ravely, â€˜itâ€™s one of the most serious things
that can possibly happen to one in a battle--to get oneâ€™s head cut off.â€™

alice laughed aloud: but she managed to turn it into a cough, for fear
of hurting his feelings.

â€˜do i look very pale?â€™ said tweedledum, coming up to have his helmet
tied on. (he called it a helmet, though it certainly looked much more
like a saucepan.)

â€˜well--yes--a little,â€™ alice replied gently.

â€˜iâ€™m very brave generally,â€™ he went on in a low voice: â€˜only to-day i
happen to have a headache.â€™

â€˜and iâ€™ve got a toothache!â€™ said tweedledee, who had overheard the
remark. â€˜iâ€™m far worse off than you!â€™

â€˜then youâ€™d better not fight to-day,â€™ said alice, thinking it a good
opportunity to make peace.

â€˜we must have a bit of a fight, but i donâ€™t care about going on long,â€™
said tweedledum. â€˜whatâ€™s the time now?â€™

tweedledee looked at his wat

ch, and said â€˜half-past four.â€™

â€˜letâ€™s fight till six, and then have dinner,â€™ said tweedledum.

â€˜very well,â€™ the other said, rather sadly: â€˜and she can watch us--only
youâ€™d better not come very close,â€™ he added: â€˜i generally hit everything
i can see--when i get really excited.â€™

â€˜and _i_ hit everything within reach,â€™ cried tweedledum, â€˜whether i can
see it or not!â€™

alice laughed. â€˜you must hit the trees pretty often, i should think,â€™
she said.

tweedledum looked round him with a satisfied smile. â€˜i donâ€™t suppose,â€™
he said, â€˜thereâ€™ll be a tree left standing, for ever so far round, by
the time weâ€™ve finished!â€™

â€˜and all about a rattle!â€™ said alice, still hoping to make them a little
ashamed of fighting for such a trifle.

â€˜i shouldnâ€™t have minded it so much,â€™ said tweedledum, â€˜if it hadnâ€™t
been a new one.â€™

â€˜i wish the monstrou

s crow would come!â€™ thought alice.

â€˜thereâ€™s only one sword, you know,â€™ tweedledum said to his brother:
â€˜but you can have the umbrella--itâ€™s quite as sharp. only we must begin
quick. itâ€™s getting as dark as it can.â€™

â€˜and darker,â€™ said tweedledee.

it was getting dark so suddenly that alice thought there must be a
thunderstorm coming on. â€˜what a thick black cloud that is!â€™ she said.
â€˜and how fast it comes! why, i do believe itâ€™s got wings!â€™

â€˜itâ€™s the crow!â€™ tweedledum cried out in a shrill voice of alarm: and
the two brothers took to their heels and were out of sight in a moment.

alice ran a little way into the wood, and stopped under a large tree.
â€˜it can never get at me here,â€™ she thought: â€˜itâ€™s far too large to
squeeze itself in among the trees. but i

being blown away!â€™

she caught the shawl as she spoke, and looked about for the owner: in
another moment the white queen came running wildly through the wood,
with both arms stretched out wide, as if she were flying, and alice very
civilly went to meet her with the shawl.

â€˜iâ€™m very glad i happened to be in the way,â€™ alice said, as she helped
her to put on her shawl again.

the white queen only looked at her in a helpless frightened sort of way,
and kept repeating something in a whisper to herself that sounded like
â€˜bread-and-butter, bread-and-butter,â€™ and alice felt that if there was
to be any conversation at all, she must manage it herself. so she began
rather timidly: â€˜am i addressing the white queen?â€™

â€˜well, yes, if you call that a-dressing,â€™ the queen said. â€˜it isnâ€™t my
notion of the thing, 
 
 ___________________________
 
at all.â€™

alice thought it would never do to have an argument at the very
beginning of their conversation, so she smiled and said, â€˜if your
majesty will only tell me the right way to begin, iâ€™ll do it as well as
i can.â€™

â€˜but i donâ€™t want it done at all!â€™ groaned the poor queen. â€˜iâ€™ve been
a-dressing myself for the last two hours.â€™

it would have been all the better, as it seemed to alice, if she had got
some one else to dress her, she was so dreadfully untidy. â€˜every
single thingâ€™s crooked,â€™ alice thought to herself, â€˜and sheâ€™s all over
pins!--may i put your shawl straight for you?â€™ she added aloud.

â€˜i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s the matter with it!â€™ the queen said, in a
melancholy voice. â€˜itâ€™s out of temper, i think. iâ€™ve pinned it here, and
iâ€™ve pinned it there, but thereâ€™s no pleasing it!â€™

â€˜it canâ€™t go straight, you know, if you pin it all on one

side,â€™ alice
said, as she gently put it right for her; â€˜and, dear me, what a state
your hair is in!â€™

â€˜the brush has got entangled in it!â€™ the queen said with a sigh. â€˜and i
lost the comb yesterday.â€™

alice carefully released the brush, and did her best to get the hair
into order. â€˜come, you look rather better now!â€™ she said, after altering
most of the pins. â€˜but really you should have a ladyâ€™s maid!â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure iâ€™ll take you with pleasure!â€™ the queen said. â€˜twopence a
week, and jam every other day.â€™

alice couldnâ€™t help laughing, as she said, â€˜i donâ€™t want you to hire
me--and i donâ€™t care for jam.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s very good jam,â€™ said the queen.

â€˜well, i donâ€™t wa
 
 ___________________________
 
nt any to-day, at any rate.â€™

â€˜you couldnâ€™t have it if you did want it,â€™ the queen said. â€˜the rule is,
jam to-morrow and jam yesterday--but never jam to-day.â€™

â€˜it must come sometimes to â€œjam to-day,â€â€™ alice objected.

â€˜no, it canâ€™t,â€™ said the queen. â€˜itâ€™s jam every other day: to-day isnâ€™t
any other day, you know.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t understand you,â€™ said alice. â€˜itâ€™s dreadfully confusing!â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s the effect of living backwards,â€™ the queen said kindly: â€˜it
always makes one a little giddy at first--â€™

â€˜living backwards!â€™ alice repeated in great astonishment. â€˜i never heard
of such a thing!â€™

â€˜--but thereâ€™s one great advantage in it, that oneâ€™s memory works both
ways.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure mine only works one way,â€™ alice remarked. â€˜i canâ€™t remember
things before they happen.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s a poor sort of memory that only

 works backwards,â€™ the queen
remarked.

â€˜what sort of things do you remember best?â€™ alice ventured to ask.

â€˜oh, things that happened the week after next,â€™ the queen replied in a
careless tone. â€˜for instance, now,â€™ she went on, sticking a large piece
of plaster on her finger as she spoke, â€˜thereâ€™s the kingâ€™s
messenger. heâ€™s in prison now, being punished: and the trial doesnâ€™t
even begin till next wednesday: and of course the crime comes last of
all.â€™

â€˜suppose he never commits the crime?â€™ said alice.

â€˜that would be all the better, wouldnâ€™t it?â€™ the que

en said, as she
bound the plaster round her finger with a bit of ribbon.

alice felt there was no denying that. â€˜of course it would be all
the better,â€™ she said: â€˜but it wouldnâ€™t be all the better his being
punished.â€™

â€˜youâ€™re wrong there, at any rate,â€™ said the queen: â€˜were you ever
punished?â€™

â€˜only for faults,â€™ said alice.

â€˜and you were all the better for it, i know!â€™ the queen said
triumphantly.

â€˜yes, but then i had done the things i was punished for,â€™ said alice:
â€˜that makes all the difference.â€™

â€˜but if you hadnâ€™t done them,â€™ the queen said, â€˜that would have been
better still; better, and better, and better!â€™ her voice went higher
with each â€˜better,â€™ till it got quite to a squeak at last.

alice was just beginning to say â€˜thereâ€™s a mistake somewhere--,â€™ when
the queen began screaming so loud that she had to leave the sentence
unfinished. â€˜oh, oh, oh!â€™ shouted the queen, shaking her hand about as
if she wanted to shake it of
 
 ___________________________
 
f. â€˜my fingerâ€™s bleeding! oh, oh, oh, oh!â€™

her screams were so exactly like the whistle of a steam-engine, that
alice had to hold both her hands over her ears.

â€˜what is the matter?â€™ she said, as soon as there was a chance of making
herself heard. â€˜have you pricked your finger?â€™

â€˜i havenâ€™t pricked it yet,â€™ the queen said, â€˜but i soon shall--oh, oh,
oh!â€™

â€˜when do you expect to do it?â€™ alice asked, feeling very much inclined
to laugh.

â€˜when i fasten my shawl again,â€™ the poor queen groaned out: â€˜the brooch
will come undone directly. oh, oh!â€™ as she said the words the brooch
flew open, and the queen clutched wildly at it, and tried to clasp it
again.

â€˜take care!â€™ cried alice. â€˜youâ€™re holding it all crooked!â€™ and she
caught at the brooch; but it was too late: the pin had slipped, and the
queen had pricked her finger.

â€˜that accounts for the bleeding, you see,â€™ 
 
 ___________________________
 
she said to alice with a
smile. â€˜now you understand the way things happen here.â€™

â€˜but why donâ€™t you scream now?â€™ alice asked, holding her hands ready to
put over her ears again.

â€˜why, iâ€™ve done all the screaming already,â€™ said the queen. â€˜what would
be the good of having it all over again?â€™

by this time it was getting light. â€˜the crow must have flown away, i
think,â€™ said alice: â€˜iâ€™m so glad itâ€™s gone. i thought it was the night
coming on.â€™

â€˜i wish _i_ could manage to be glad!â€™ the queen said. â€˜only i never
can remember the rule. you must be very happy, living in this wood, and
being glad whenever you like!â€™

â€˜only it is so very lonely here!â€™ alice said in a melancholy voice; and
at the thought of her loneliness two large tears came rolling down her
cheeks.

â€˜oh, donâ€™t go on like that!â€™ cried the poor queen, wringing her hands in
despair. â€
 
 ___________________________
 
˜consider what a great girl you are. consider what a long way
youâ€™ve come to-day. consider what oâ€™clock it is. consider anything, only
donâ€™t cry!â€™

alice could not help laughing at this, even in the midst of her tears.
â€˜can you keep from crying by considering things?â€™ she asked.

â€˜thatâ€™s the way itâ€™s done,â€™ the queen said with great decision: â€˜nobody
can do two things at once, you know. letâ€™s consider your age to begin
with--how old are you?â€™

â€˜iâ€™m seven and a half exactly.â€™

â€˜you neednâ€™t say â€œexactually,â€â€™ the queen remarked: â€˜i can believe
it without that. now iâ€™ll give you something to believe. iâ€™m just

 one
hundred and one, five months and a day.â€™

â€˜i canâ€™t believe that!â€™ said alice.

â€˜canâ€™t you?â€™ the queen said in a pitying tone. â€˜try again: draw a long
breath, and shut your eyes.â€™

alice laughed. â€˜thereâ€™s no use trying,â€™ she said: â€˜one canâ€™t believe
impossible things.â€™

â€˜i daresay you havenâ€™t had much practice,â€™ said the queen. â€˜when i was
your age, i always did it for half-an-hour a day. why, sometimes iâ€™ve
believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast. there goes
the shawl again!â€™

the brooch had come undone as she spoke, and a sudden gust of wind blew
the queenâ€™s shawl across a little brook. the queen spread out her arms
again, and went
 
 ___________________________
 
 flying after it, and this time she succeeded in catching
it for herself. â€˜iâ€™ve got it!â€™ she cried in a triumphant tone. â€˜now you
shall see me pin it on again, all by myself!â€™

â€˜then i hope your finger is better now?â€™ alice said very politely, as
she crossed the little brook after the queen.

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

â€˜oh, much better!â€™ cried the queen, her voice rising to a squeak as she
went on. â€˜much be-etter! be-etter! be-e-e-etter! be-e-ehh!â€™ the last
word ended in a long bleat, so like a sheep that alice quite started.

she looked at the queen, who seemed to have suddenly wrapped herself up
in wool. alice rubbed her eyes, and
 
 ___________________________
 
t really--was it
really a sheep that was sitting on the other side of the counter? rub as
she could, she could make nothing more of it: she was in a little dark
shop, leaning with her elbows on the counter, and opposite to her was
an old sheep, sitting in an arm-chair knitting, and every now and then
leaving off to look at her through a great pair of spectacles.

â€˜what is it you want to buy?â€™ the sheep said at last, looking up for a
moment from her knitting.

â€˜i donâ€™t quite know yet,â€™ alice said, very gently. â€˜i should like to
look all round me first, if i might.â€™

â€˜you may look in front of you, and on both sides, if you like,â€™ said the
sheep: â€˜but you canâ€™t look all round you--unless youâ€™ve got eyes at the
back of your head.â€™

but these, as it happened, alice had not got: so she contented herself
with turning round, looking at the shelves as she came to them.

the shop seemed to be full of all manner of curious things--but the
oddest part of it all was, that whene
 
 ___________________________
 
 she added, as a
sudden thought struck her, â€˜iâ€™ll follow it up to the very top shelf of
all. itâ€™ll puzzle it to go through the ceiling, i expect!â€™

but even this plan failed: the â€˜thingâ€™ went through the ceiling as
quietly as possible, as if it were quite used to it.

â€˜are you a child or a teetotum?â€™ the sheep said, as she took up another
pair of needles. â€˜youâ€™ll make me giddy soon, if you go on turning round
like that.â€™ she was now working with fourteen pairs at once, and alice
couldnâ€™t help looking at her in great astonishment.

â€˜how can she knit with so many?â€™ the puzzled child thought to herself.
â€˜she gets more and more like a porcupine every minute!â€™

â€˜can you row?â€™ the sheep asked, handing her a pair of knitting-needles
as she spoke.

â€˜yes, a little--but not on land--and not with needles--â€™ alice was
beginning to say, when suddenly the needles turned into oars in her
hands, and she found they were in a little boat, gliding along between
banks: s
 
 ___________________________
 
o there was nothing for it but to do her best.

â€˜feather!â€™ cried the sheep, as she took up another pair of needles.

this didnâ€™t sound like a remark that needed any answer, so alice said
nothing, but pulled away. there was something very queer about the
water, she thought, as every now and then the oars got fast in it, and
would hardly come out again.

â€˜feather! feather!â€™ the sheep cried again, taking more needles. â€˜youâ€™ll
be catching a crab directly.â€™

â€˜a dear little crab!â€™ thought alice. â€˜i should like that.â€™

â€˜didnâ€™t you hear me say â€œfeatherâ€?â€™ the sheep cried angrily, taking up
quite a bunch of needles.

â€˜indeed i did,â€™ said alice: â€˜yo
 
 ___________________________
 
uâ€™ve said it very often--and very loud.
please, where are the crabs?â€™

â€˜in the water, of course!â€™ said the sheep, sticking some of the needles
into her hair, as her hands were full. â€˜feather, i say!â€™

â€˜why do you say â€œfeatherâ€ so often?â€™ alice asked at last, rather vexed.
â€˜iâ€™m not a bird!â€™

â€˜you are,â€™ said the sheep: â€˜youâ€™re a little goose.â€™

this offended alice a little, so there was no more conversation for a
minute or two, while the boat glided gently on, sometimes among beds of
weeds (which made the oars stick fast in the water, worse then ever),
and sometimes under trees, but always with the same tall river-banks
frowning over their heads.

â€˜oh, please! there are some scented rushes!â€™ alice cried in a sudden
transport of delight. â€˜there really are--and such beauties!â€™

â€˜you neednâ€™t say â€œpleaseâ€ to me about â€˜em,â€™ the sheep said,
 
 ___________________________
 
 without
looking up from her knitting: â€˜i didnâ€™t put â€˜em there, and iâ€™m not going
to take â€˜em away.â€™

â€˜no, but i meant--please, may we wait and pick some?â€™ alice pleaded. â€˜if
you donâ€™t mind stopping the boat for a minute.â€™

â€˜how am _i_ to stop it?â€™ said the sheep. â€˜if you leave off rowing, itâ€™ll
stop of itself.â€™

so the boat was left to drift down the stream as it would, till it
glided gently in among the waving rushes. and then the little sleeves
were carefully rolled up, and the little arms were plunged in elbow-deep
to get the rushes a good long way down before breaking them off--and for
a while alice forgot all about the sheep and th
 
 ___________________________
 
obstinacy of the rushes in growing so far off, as, with flushed cheeks
and dripping hair and hands, she scrambled back into her place, and
began to arrange her new-found treasures.

what mattered it to her just then that the rushes had begun to fade, and
to lose all their scent and beauty, from the very moment that she
picked them? even real scented rushes, you know, last only a very little
while--and these, being dream-rushes, melted away almost like snow, as
they lay in heaps at her feet--but alice hardly noticed this, there were
so many other curious things to think about.

they hadnâ€™t gone much farther before the blade of one of the oars got
fast in the water and wouldnâ€™t come out again (so alice explained it
afterwards), and the consequence was that the handle of it caught her
under the chin, and, in spite of a series of little shrieks of â€˜oh, oh,
oh!â€™ from poor alice, it swept her straight off the seat, and down among
the heap of rushes.

however, she wasnâ€™t hurt, and was so
 
 ___________________________
 
on up again: the sheep went on with
her knitting all the while, just as if nothing had happened. â€˜that was
a nice crab you caught!â€™ she remarked, as alice got back into her place,
very much relieved to find herself still in the boat.

â€˜was it? i didnâ€™t see it,â€™ said alice, peeping cautiously over the side
of the boat into the dark water. â€˜i wish it hadnâ€™t let go--i should
so like to see a little crab to take home with me!â€™ but the sheep only
laughed scornfully, and went on with her knitting.

â€˜are there many crabs here?â€™ said alice.

â€˜crabs, and all sorts of things,â€™ said the sheep: â€˜plenty of choice,
only make up your mind. now, what do you want to buy?â€™

â€˜to buy!â€™ alice echoed in a tone that was half astonished and half
frightened--for th

e oars, and the boat, and the river, had vanished all
in a moment, and she was back again in the little dark shop.

â€˜i should like to buy an egg, please,â€™ she said timidly. â€˜how do you
sell them?â€™

â€˜fivepence farthing for one--twopence for two,â€™ the sheep replied.

â€˜then two are cheaper than one?â€™ alice said in a surprised tone, taking
out her purse.

â€˜only you must eat them both, if you buy two,â€™ said the sheep.

â€˜then iâ€™ll have one, please,â€™ said alice, as she put the money down on
the counter. for she thought to herself, â€˜they mightnâ€™t be at all nice,
you know.â€™

the sheep took the money, and put it away in a box: then she said â€˜i
never put things into peopleâ€™s hands--that would never do--you must get
it for yourself.â€™ and so saying, she went off to the other end of the
shop, and set the egg upright on a shelf.

â€˜i wonder why it wouldnâ€™t do?â€™ thought alice, as she groped her way
among the tables and chairs, for the shop was

when she had come within a few yards of it, she saw that it had eyes
and a nose and mouth; and when she had come close to it, she saw clearly
that it was humpty dumpty himself. â€˜it canâ€™t be anybody else!â€™ she said
to herself. â€˜iâ€™m as certain of it, as if his name were written all over
his face.â€™

it might have been written a hundred times, easily, on that enormous
face. humpty dumpty was sitting with his legs crossed, like a turk, on
the top of a high wall--such a narrow one that alice quite wondered how
he could keep his balance--and, as his eyes were steadily fixed in the
opposite direction, and he didnâ€™t take the least notice of her, she
thought he must be a stuffed figure after all.

â€˜and how exactly like an egg he is!â€™ she said aloud, standing with her
hands ready to catch him, for she was every moment expecting him to
fall.

â€˜itâ€™s very provoking,â€™ humpty dumpty said after a long silence, looking
away from alice as he spoke, â€˜to be called an egg--very!â€™


 
 ___________________________
 
â€˜i said you looked like an egg, sir,â€™ alice gently explained. â€˜and some
eggs are very pretty, you knowâ€™ she added, hoping to turn her remark
into a sort of a compliment.

â€˜some people,â€™ said humpty dumpty, looking away from her as usual, â€˜have
no more sense than a baby!â€™

alice didnâ€™t know what to say to this: it wasnâ€™t at all like
conversation, she thought, as he never said anything to her; in fact,
his last remark was evidently addressed to a tree--so she stood and
softly repeated to herself:--


     â€˜humpty dumpty sat on a wall:
     humpty dumpty had a great fall.
     all the kingâ€™s horses and all the kingâ€™s men
     couldnâ€™t put humpty dumpty in his place again.â€™


â€˜that last line is much too long for the poetry,â€™ she added, almost out
loud, f

orgetting that humpty dumpty would hear her.

â€˜donâ€™t stand there chattering to yourself like that,â€™ humpty dumpty
said, looking at her for the first time, â€˜but tell me your name and your
business.â€™

â€˜my name is alice, but--â€™

â€˜itâ€™s a stupid enough name!â€™ humpty dumpty interrupted impatiently.
â€˜what does it mean?â€™

â€˜must a name mean something?â€™ alice asked doubtfully.

â€˜of course it must,â€™ humpty dumpty said with a short laugh: â€˜my name
means the shape i am--and a good handsome shape it is, too. with a name
like yours, you might be any shape, almost.â€™

â€˜why do you sit out here all alone?â€™ said alice, not wishing to begin an
argument.

â€˜why, because thereâ€™s nobody with me!â€™ cried humpty dumpty. â€˜did you
think i didnâ€™t know the answer to that? ask another.â€™

â€˜donâ€™t you think youâ€™d be safer down on the ground?â€™ 
 
 ___________________________
 
alice went on, not
with any idea of making another riddle, but simply in her good-natured
anxiety for the queer creature. â€˜that wall is so very narrow!â€™

â€˜what tremendously easy riddles you ask!â€™ humpty dumpty growled out. â€˜of
course i donâ€™t think so! why, if ever i did fall off--which thereâ€™s no
chance of--but if i did--â€™ here he pursed up his lips and looked so solemn
and grand that alice could hardly help laughing. â€˜if i did fall,â€™ he
went on, â€˜the king has promised me--ah, you may turn pale, if you like!
you didnâ€™t think i was going to say that, did you? the king has promised me--
with his very own mouth--to--to--â€™

â€˜to send all his horses and all his men,â€™ alice interrupted, rather
unwisely.

â€˜now i declare thatâ€™s too bad!â€™ humpty dumpty cried, breaking into a
sudden passion. â€˜youâ€™ve been listening at doors--and behind trees--and
down chimneys--or you

â€˜i havenâ€™t, indeed!â€™ alice said very gently. â€˜itâ€™s in a book.â€™

â€˜ah, well! they may write such things in a book,â€™ humpty dumpty said in
a calmer tone. â€˜thatâ€™s what you call a history of england, that is.
now, take a good look at me! iâ€™m one that has spoken to a king, _i_ am:
mayhap youâ€™ll never see such another: and to show you iâ€™m not proud, you
may shake hands with me!â€™ and he grinned almost from ear to ear, as he
leant forwards (and as nearly as possible fell off the wall in doing so)
and offered

took it. â€˜if he smiled much more, the ends of his mouth might meet
behind,â€™ she thought: â€˜and then i donâ€™t know what would happen to his
head! iâ€™m afraid it would come off!â€™

â€˜yes, all his horses and all his men,â€™ humpty dumpty went on. â€˜theyâ€™d
pick me up again in a minute, they would! however, this conversation is
going on a little too fast: letâ€™s go back to the last remark but one.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m afraid i canâ€™t quite re

member it,â€™ alice said very politely.

â€˜in that case we start fresh,â€™ said humpty dumpty, â€˜and itâ€™s my turn
to choose a subject--â€™ (â€˜he talks about it just as if it was a game!â€™
thought alice.) â€˜so hereâ€™s a question for you. how old did you say you
were?â€™

alice made a short calculation, and said â€˜seven years and six months.â€™

â€˜wrong!â€™ humpty dumpty exclaimed triumphantly. â€˜you never said a word
like it!â€™

â€˜i though you meant â€œhow old are you?â€â€™ alice explained.

â€˜if iâ€™d meant that, iâ€™d have said it,â€™ said humpty dumpty.

alice didnâ€™t want to begin another argument, so she said nothing.

â€˜seven years and six months!â€™ humpty dumpty repeated thoughtfully. â€˜an
uncomfortable sort of age. now if youâ€™d asked my advice, iâ€™d have said
â€œleave off at sevenâ€--but itâ€™s too late now.â€™

â€˜i never ask advice about growing,â€™ alice said indignantly.

â€˜too proud?â€™ the other inquired.

alice felt even more indignant at this s

uggestion. â€˜i mean,â€™ she said,
â€˜that one canâ€™t help growing older.â€™

â€˜one canâ€™t, perhaps,â€™ said humpty dumpty, â€˜but two can. with proper
assistance, you might have left off at seven.â€™

â€˜what a beautiful belt youâ€™ve got on!â€™ alice suddenly remarked.

(they had had quite enough of the subject of age, she thought: and if
they really were to take turns in choosing subjects, it was her turn
now.) â€˜at least,â€™ she corrected herself on second thoughts, â€˜a beautiful
cravat, i should have said--no, a belt, i mean--i beg your pardon!â€™ she
added in dismay, for humpty dumpty looked thoroughly offended, and she
began to wish she hadnâ€™t chosen that subject. â€˜if i only knew,â€™ she
thought to herself, â€˜which was neck and 
 
 ___________________________
 
which was waist!â€™

evidently humpty dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two. when he did speak again, it was in a deep growl.

â€˜it is a--most--provoking--thing,â€™ he said at last, â€˜when a person
doesnâ€™t know a cravat from a belt!â€™

â€˜i know itâ€™s very ignorant of me,â€™ alice said, in so humble a tone that
humpty dumpty relented.

â€˜itâ€™s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. itâ€™s a present
from the white king and queen. there now!â€™

â€˜is it really?â€™ said alice, quite pleased to find that she had chosen a
good subject, after all.

â€˜they gave it me,â€™ humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, â€˜they gave it
me--for an un-birthday present.â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon?â€™ alice said
 
 ___________________________
 
 with a puzzled air.

â€˜iâ€™m not offended,â€™ said humpty dumpty.

â€˜i mean, what is an un-birthday present?â€™

â€˜a present given when it isnâ€™t your birthday, of course.â€™

alice considered a little. â€˜i like birthday presents best,â€™ she said at
last.

â€˜you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re talking about!â€™ cried humpty dumpty. â€˜how
many days are there in a year?â€™

â€˜three hundred and sixty-five,â€™ said alice.

â€˜and how many birthdays have you?â€™

â€˜one.â€™

â€˜and if you take one from three hundred and sixty-five, what remains?â€™

â€˜three hundred and sixty-four, of course.â€™

humpty dumpty looked doubtful. â€˜iâ€™d rather see that done on paper,â€™ he
said.

alice couldnâ€™t help smiling as she took out her memorandum-book, and
worked the sum for him:


               365
                1
               ____

               364
               ___

humpty dumpty took the book, and looked at 
 
 ___________________________
 
it carefully. â€˜that seems to
be done right--â€™ he began.

â€˜youâ€™re holding it upside down!â€™ alice interrupted.

â€˜to be sure i was!â€™ humpty dumpty said gaily, as she turned it round for
him. â€˜i thought it looked a little queer. as i was saying, that seems
to be done right--though i havenâ€™t time to look it over thoroughly just
now--and that shows that there are three hundred and sixty-four days
when you might get un-birthday presents--â€™

â€˜certainly,â€™ said alice.

â€˜and only one for birthday presents, you know. thereâ€™s glory for you!â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know what you mean by â€œglory,â€â€™ alice said.

humpty dumpty smiled contemptuously. â€˜of course you donâ€™t--till i tell
you. i meant â€œthereâ€™s a nice knock-down argument for you!â€â€™

â€˜but â€œgloryâ€ doesnâ€™t mean â€œa nice knock-down argument,â€â€™ alice objected.

â€˜when _i_ use a word,â€™ humpty dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, â€˜it
means just what i choose it to mean--neither
 
 ___________________________
 
 more nor less.â€™

â€˜the question is,â€™ said alice, â€˜whether you can make words mean so many
different things.â€™

â€˜the question is,â€™ said humpty dumpty, â€˜which is to be master--thatâ€™s
all.â€™

alice was too much puzzled to say anything, so after a minute humpty
dumpty began again. â€˜theyâ€™ve a temper, some of them--particularly verbs,
theyâ€™re the proudest--adjectives you can do anything with, but not
verbs--however, _i_ can manage the whole lot of them! impenetrability!
thatâ€™s what _i_ say!â€™

â€˜would you tell me, please,â€™ said alice â€˜what that means?â€™

â€˜now you talk like a reasonable child,â€™ said humpty dumpty, looking very
much pleased. â€˜i meant by â€œimpenetrabilityâ
 
 ___________________________
 
€ that weâ€™ve had enough of
that subject, and it would be just as well if youâ€™d mention what you
mean to do next, as i suppose you donâ€™t mean to stop here all the rest
of your life.â€™

â€˜thatâ€™s a great deal to make one word mean,â€™ alice said in a thoughtful
tone.

â€˜when i make a word do a lot of work like that,â€™ said humpty dumpty, â€˜i
always pay it extra.â€™

â€˜oh!â€™ said alice. she was too much puzzled to make any other remark.

â€˜ah, you should see â€˜em come round me of a saturday night,â€™ humpty
dumpty went on, wagging his head gravely from side to side: â€˜for to get
their wages, you know.â€™

(alice didnâ€™t venture to ask what he paid them with; and so you see i
canâ€™t tell you.)

â€˜you seem very clever at explaining words, sir,â€™ said alice. â€˜would you
kindly tell me the meaning of the poem called â€œjabberwockyâ€?â€™

â€˜letâ€™s hear it,â€™ said humpt
 
 ___________________________
 
y dumpty. â€˜i can explain all the poems that
were ever invented--and a good many that havenâ€™t been invented just
yet.â€™

this sounded very hopeful, so alice repeated the first verse:

     â€˜twas brillig, and the slithy toves
      did gyre and gimble in the wabe;
     all mimsy were the borogoves,
      and the mome raths outgrabe.

â€˜thatâ€™s enough to begin with,â€™ humpty dumpty interrupted: â€˜there
are plenty of hard words there. â€œbrilligâ€ means four oâ€™clock in the
afternoon--the time when you begin broiling things for dinner.â€™

â€˜thatâ€™ll do very well,â€™ said alice: â€˜and â€œslithyâ€?â€™

â€˜well, â€œslithyâ€ means â€œlithe a
 
 ___________________________
 
nd slimy.â€ â€œlitheâ€ is the same as
â€œactive.â€ you see itâ€™s like a portmanteau--there are two meanings packed
up into one word.â€™

â€˜i see it now,â€™ alice remarked thoughtfully: â€˜and what are â€œtovesâ€?â€™

â€˜well, â€œtovesâ€ are something like badgers--theyâ€™re something like
lizards--and theyâ€™re something like corkscrews.â€™

â€˜they must be very curious looking creatures.â€™

â€˜they are that,â€™ said humpty dumpty: â€˜also they make their nests under
sun-dials--also they live on cheese.â€™

â€˜and whatâ€™s the â€œgyreâ€ and to â€œgimbleâ€?â€™

â€˜to â€œgyreâ€ is to go round and round like a gyroscope. to â€œgimbleâ€ is to
make ho

les like a gimlet.â€™

â€˜and â€œthe wabeâ€ is the grass-plot round a sun-dial, i suppose?â€™ said
alice, surprised at her own ingenuity.

â€˜of course it is. itâ€™s called â€œwabe,â€ you know, because it goes a long
way before it, and a long way behind it--â€™

â€˜and a long way beyond it on each side,â€™ alice added.

â€˜exactly so. well, then, â€œmimsyâ€ is â€œflimsy and miserableâ€ (thereâ€™s
another portmanteau for you). and a â€œborogoveâ€ is a thin shabby-looking
bird with its feathers sticking out all round--something like a live
mop.â€™

â€˜and then â€œmome rathsâ€?â€™ said alice. â€˜iâ€™m afraid iâ€™m giving you a great
deal of trouble.â€™

â€˜well, a â€œrathâ€ is a sort of green pig: but â€œmomeâ€ iâ€™m not certain
about. i think itâ€™s short for â€œfrom homeâ€--meaning that theyâ€™d

lost
their way, you know.â€™

â€˜and what does â€œoutgrabeâ€ mean?â€™

â€˜well, â€œoutgrabingâ€ is something between bellowing and whistling, with a
kind of sneeze in the middle: however, youâ€™ll hear it done, maybe--down
in the wood yonder--and when youâ€™ve once heard it youâ€™ll be quite
content. whoâ€™s been repeating all that hard stuff to you?â€™

â€˜i read it in a book,â€™ said alice. â€˜but i had some poetry repeated to
me, much easier than that, by--tweedledee, i think it was.â€™

â€˜as to poetry, you know,â€™ said humpty dumpty, stretching out one of his
great hands, â€˜_i_ can repeat poetry as well as other folk, if it comes
to that--â€™

â€˜oh, it neednâ€™t come to that!â€™ alice hastily said, hoping to keep him
from beginning.

â€˜the piece iâ€™m going to repeat,â€™ he went on without noticing her remark,
â€˜was written entirely for your amusement.â€™

alice felt that
 
 ___________________________
 
 in that case she really ought to listen to it, so she
sat down, and said â€˜thank youâ€™ rather sadly.


     â€˜in winter, when the fields are white,
     i sing this song for your delight--


only i donâ€™t sing it,â€™ he added, as an explanation.

â€˜i see you donâ€™t,â€™ said alice.

â€˜if you can see whether iâ€™m singing or not, youâ€™ve sharper eyes than
most.â€™ humpty dumpty remarked severely. alice was silent.


     â€˜in spring, when woods are getting green,
     iâ€™ll try and tell you what i mean.â€™


â€˜thank you very much,â€™ said alice.


     â€˜in summer, when the days are long,
     perhaps youâ€™ll understand the song:
     in autumn, when the leaves are brown,
     take pen and ink, and write it down.â€™


â€˜i will, if i can remember it so long,â€™ said alice.

â€˜you neednâ€™t go on making remarks like that,â€™ humpty dumpty said:
â€˜theyâ€™re not sensible, and they put me

     â€˜i sent a message to the fish:
     i told them â€œthis is what i wish.â€

     the little fishes of the sea,
     they sent an answer back to me.

     the little fishesâ€™ answer was
     â€œwe cannot do it, sir, because--â€œâ€™


â€˜iâ€™m afraid i donâ€™t quite understand,â€™ said alice.

â€˜it gets easier further on,â€™ humpty dumpty replied.


     â€˜i sent to them again to say
     â€œit will be better to obey.â€

     the fishes answered with a grin,
     â€œwhy, what a temper you are in!â€

     i told them once, i told them twice:
     they would not listen to advice.

     i took a kettle large and new,
     fit for the deed i had to do.

     my heart went hop, my heart went thump;
     i filled the kettle at the pump.

     then some one came to me and said,
     â

€œthe little fishes are in bed.â€

     i said to him, i said it plain,
     â€œthen you must wake them up again.â€

     i said it very loud and clear;
     i went and shouted in his ear.â€™


humpty dumpty raised his voice almost to a scream as he repeated this
verse, and alice thought with a shudder, â€˜i wouldnâ€™t have been the
messenger for anything!â€™


     â€˜but he was very stiff and proud;
     he said â€œyou neednâ€™t shout so loud!â€

     and he was very proud and stiff;
     he said â€œiâ€™d go and wake them, if--â€

     i took a corkscrew from the shelf:
     i went to wake them up myself.

     and when i found the door was locked,

there was a long pause.

â€˜is that all?â€™ alice timidly asked.

â€˜thatâ€™s all,â€™ said humpty dumpty. â€˜good-bye.â€™

this was rather sudden, alice thought: but, after such a very strong
hint that she ought to be going, she felt that it would hardly be civil
to stay. so she got up, and held out her hand. â€˜good-bye, till we meet
again!â€™ she said as cheerfully as she could.

â€˜i shouldnâ€™t know you again if we did meet,â€™ humpty dumpty replied in
a discontented tone, giving her one of his fingers to shake; â€˜youâ€™re so
exactly like other people.â€™

â€˜the face is what one goes by, generally,â€™ alice remarked in a
thoughtful tone.

 
 ___________________________
 

â€˜thatâ€™s just what i complain of,â€™ said humpty dumpty. â€˜your face is the
same as everybody has--the two eyes, so--â€™ (marking their places in the
air with this thumb) â€˜nose in the middle, mouth under. itâ€™s always the
same. now if you had the two eyes on the same side of the nose, for
instance--or the mouth at the top--that would be some help.â€™

â€˜it wouldnâ€™t look nice,â€™ alice objected. but humpty dumpty only shut his
eyes and said â€˜wait till youâ€™ve tried.â€™

alice waited a minute to see if he would speak again, but as he never
opened his eyes or took any further notice of her, she said â€˜good-bye!â€™
once more, and, getting no answer to this, she quietly walked away:
but she couldnâ€™t help saying to herself as she went, â€˜of all the
unsatisfactory--â€™ (she repeated this aloud, as it was a great comfort to
have such a long word to say) â€˜of all the unsatisfactory people i ever
met--â€™ she never finished the sentence, for at this moment a heavy crash

shook the forest from end to end.




chapter vii. the lion and the unicorn

the next moment soldiers came running through the wood, at first in twos
and threes, then ten or twenty together, and at last in such crowds that
they seemed to fill the whole forest. alice got behind a tree, for fear
of being run over, and watched them go by.

she thought that in all her life she had never seen soldiers so
uncertain on their feet: they were always tripping over something or
other, and whenever one went down, several more always fell over him, so
that the ground was soon covered with little heaps of men.

then came the horses. having four feet, these managed rather better than
the foot-soldiers: but even they stumbled now and then; and it seemed
to be a regular ru
 
 ___________________________
 
le that, whenever a horse stumbled the rider fell off
instantly. the confusion got worse every moment, and alice was very glad
to get out of the wood into an open place, where she found the white
king seated on the ground, busily writing in his memorandum-book.

â€˜iâ€™ve sent them all!â€™ the king cried in a tone of delight, on seeing
alice. â€˜did you happen to meet any soldiers, my dear, as you came
through the wood?â€™

â€˜yes, i did,â€™ said alice: â€˜several thousand, i should think.â€™

â€˜four thousand two hundred and seven, thatâ€™s the exact number,â€™ the king
said, referring to his book. â€˜i couldnâ€™t send all the horses, you know,
because two of them are wanted in the game. and i havenâ€™t sent the two
messengers, either. theyâ€™re both gone to the town. just look along the
road, and tell me if you can see either of them.â€™

â€˜i see nobody on the road,â€™ said alice.

â€˜i only wish _i_ had such eyes,â€™ the king remarked in 
 
 ___________________________
 
a fretful tone.
â€˜to be able to see nobody! and at that distance, too! why, itâ€™s as much
as _i_ can do to see real people, by this light!â€™

all this was lost on alice, who was still looking intently along
the road, shading her eyes with one hand. â€˜i see somebody now!â€™ she
exclaimed at last. â€˜but heâ€™s coming very slowly--and what curious
attitudes he goes into!â€™ (for the messenger kept skipping up and down,
and wriggling like an eel, as he came along, with his great hands spread
out like fans on each side.)

â€˜not at all,â€™ said the king. â€˜heâ€™s an anglo-saxon messenger--and those
are anglo-saxon attitudes. he only does them when heâ€™s happy. 
 
 ___________________________
 
his name
is haigha.â€™ (he pronounced it so as to rhyme with â€˜mayor.â€™)

â€˜i love my love with an h,â€™ alice couldnâ€™t help beginning, â€˜because
he is happy. i hate him with an h, because he is hideous. i fed him
with--with--with ham-sandwiches and hay. his name is haigha, and he
lives--â€™

â€˜he lives on the hill,â€™ the king remarked simply, without the least idea
that he was joining in the game, while alice was still hesitating for
the name of a town beginning with h. â€˜the other messengerâ€™s called
hatta. i must have two, you know--to come and go. one to come, and one
to go.â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon?â€™ said alice.

â€˜it isnâ€™t respectable to beg,â€™ said the king.

â€˜i only meant that i didnâ€™t understand,â€™ said alice. â€˜why one to come
and one to go?â€™

â€˜didnâ€™t i tell you?â€™ the king repeated impatiently. â€˜i must have two--to
fetch and carry. one to fetch, and one to carry.â€™

 
 ___________________________
 

at this moment the messenger arrived: he was far too much out of breath
to say a word, and could only wave his hands about, and make the most
fearful faces at the poor king.

â€˜this young lady loves you with an h,â€™ the king said, introducing alice
in the hope of turning off the messengerâ€™s attention from himself--but
it was no use--the anglo-saxon attitudes only got more extraordinary
every moment, while the great eyes rolled wildly from side to side.

â€˜you alarm me!â€™ said the king. â€˜i feel faint--give me a ham sandwich!â€™

on which the messenger, to aliceâ€™s great amusement, opened a bag that
hung round his neck, and handed a sandwich to the king, who devoured it
greedily.

â€˜another sandwich!â€™ said the king.

â€˜thereâ€™s 
 
 ___________________________
 
nothing but hay left now,â€™ the messenger said, peeping into the
bag.

â€˜hay, then,â€™ the king murmured in a faint whisper.

alice was glad to see that it revived him a good deal. â€˜thereâ€™s nothing
like eating hay when youâ€™re faint,â€™ he remarked to her, as he munched
away.

â€˜i should think throwing cold water over you would be better,â€™ alice
suggested: â€˜or some sal-volatile.â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t say there was nothing better,â€™ the king replied. â€˜i said there
was nothing like it.â€™ which alice did not venture to deny.

â€˜who did you pass on the road?â€™ the king went on, holding out his hand
to the messenger for some more hay.

â€˜nobody,â€™ said the messenger.

â€˜quite right,â€™ said the king: â€˜this young lady saw him too. so of course
nobody walks slower than you.â€™

â€˜i do my best,â€™ the messenger said in a sulky tone. 
 
 ___________________________
 
â€˜iâ€™m sure nobody
walks much faster than i do!â€™

â€˜he canâ€™t do that,â€™ said the king, â€˜or else heâ€™d have been here first.
however, now youâ€™ve got your breath, you may tell us whatâ€™s happened in
the town.â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll whisper it,â€™ said the messenger, putting his hands to his mouth
in the shape of a trumpet, and stooping so as to get close to the kingâ€™s
ear. alice was sorry for this, as she wanted to hear the news too.
however, instead of whispering, he simply shouted at the top of his
voice â€˜theyâ€™re at it again!â€™

â€˜do you call that a whisper?â€™ cried the poor king, jumping up and
shaking himself. â€˜if you do such a thing again, iâ€™ll have you buttered!
it went through and through my head like an earthquake!â€™

â€˜it would have to be a very tiny earthquake!â€™ thought alice. â€˜who are at
it again?â€™ she ventured to ask.

â€˜why the lion and

 the unicorn, of course,â€™ said the king.

â€˜fighting for the crown?â€™

â€˜yes, to be sure,â€™ said the king: â€˜and the best of the joke is, that
itâ€™s my crown all the while! letâ€™s run and see them.â€™ and they trotted
off, alice repeating to herself, as she ran, the words of the old
song:--


   â€˜the lion and the unicorn were fighting for the crown:
   the lion beat the unicorn all round the town.
   some gave them white bread, some gave them brown;
   some gave them plum-cake and drummed them out of town.â€™


â€˜does--the one--that wins--get the crown?â€™ she asked, as well as she
could, for the run was putting her quite out of breath.

â€˜dear me, no!â€™ said the king. â€˜what an idea!â€™

â€˜would you--be good en

ough,â€™ alice panted out, after running a little
further, â€˜to stop a minute--just to get--oneâ€™s breath again?â€™

â€˜iâ€™m good enough,â€™ the king said, â€˜only iâ€™m not strong enough. you see,
a minute goes by so fearfully quick. you might as well try to stop a
bandersnatch!â€™

alice had no more breath for talking, so they trotted on in silence,
till they came in sight of a great crowd, in the middle of which the
lion and unicorn were fighting. they were in such a cloud of dust, that
at first alice could not make out which was which: but she soon managed
to distinguish the unicorn by his horn.

they placed themselves close to where hatta, the other messenger, was
standing watching the fight, with a cup of tea in one hand and a piece
of bread-and-butter in the other.

â€˜heâ

he was sent in,â€™ haigha whispered to alice: â€˜and they only give them
oyster-shells in there--so you see heâ€™s very hungry and thirsty. how
are you, dear child?â€™ he went on, putting his arm affectionately round
hattaâ€™s neck.

hatta looked round and nodded, and went on with his bread and butter.

â€˜were you happy in prison, dear child?â€™ said haigha.

hatta looked round once more, and this time a tear or two trickled down
his cheek: but not a word would he say.

â€˜speak, canâ€™t you!â€™ haigha cried impatiently. but hatta only m

away, and drank some more tea.

â€˜speak, wonâ€™t you!â€™ cried the king. â€˜how are they getting on with the
fight?â€™

hatta made a desperate effort, and swallowed a large piece of
bread-and-butter. â€˜theyâ€™re getting on very well,â€™ he said in a choking
voice: â€˜each of them has been down about eighty-seven times.â€™

â€˜then i suppose theyâ€™ll soon bring the white bread and the brown?â€™ alice
ventured to remark.

â€˜itâ€™s waiting for â€˜em now,â€™ said hatta: â€˜this is a bit of it as iâ€™m
eating.â€™

there was a pause in the fight just then, and the lion and the unicorn
sat down, panting, while the king called out â€˜ten minutes allowed for
refreshments!â€™ haigha and hatta set to work at once, carrying rough
trays of white and brown bread. alice took a piece to taste, but it was
very dry.

â€˜i donâ€™t think theyâ€™ll fight any more to-day,â€™ the king said to hatta:
â€˜go and o
 
 ___________________________
 
rder the drums to begin.â€™ and hatta went bounding away like a
grasshopper.

for a minute or two alice stood silent, watching him. suddenly she
brightened up. â€˜look, look!â€™ she cried, pointing eagerly. â€˜thereâ€™s the
white queen running across the country! she came flying out of the wood
over yonder--how fast those queens can run!â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s some enemy after her, no doubt,â€™ the king said, without even
looking round. â€˜that woodâ€™s full of them.â€™

â€˜but arenâ€™t you going to run and help her?â€™ alice asked, very much
surprised at his taking it so quietly.

â€˜no use, no use!â€

ned his memorandum-book. â€˜do you spell â€œcreatureâ€ with
a double â€œeâ€?â€™

at this moment the unicorn sauntered by them, with his hands in his
pockets. â€˜i had the best of it this time?â€™ he said to the king, just
glancing at him as he passed.

â€˜a little--a little,â€™ the king replied, rather nervously. â€˜you shouldnâ€™t
have run him through with your horn, you know.â€™

â€˜it didnâ€™t hurt him,â€™ the unicorn said carelessly, and he was going
on, when his eye happened to fall upon alice: he turned round rather
instantly, and stood for some time looking at her with an air of the
deepest disgust.

â€˜what--is--this?â€™ he said at last.

â€˜this is a child!â€™ haigha replied eagerly, coming in front of alice
to introduce her, and spreading out both his hands towards her in an
anglo-saxon attitude. â€˜we only found it to-day. itâ€™s as large as life,
and twice as natural!â€™

â€˜i always thought they were fabulous monsters!â€™ said the unicorn. â€˜is it
alive?â€™

â€˜it can talk,â
 
 ___________________________
 
€™ said haigha, solemnly.

the unicorn looked dreamily at alice, and said â€˜talk, child.â€™

alice could not help her lips curling up into a smile as she began: â€˜do
you know, i always thought unicorns were fabulous monsters, too! i never
saw one alive before!â€™

â€˜well, now that we have seen each other,â€™ said the unicorn, â€˜if youâ€™ll
believe in me, iâ€™ll believe in you. is that a bargain?â€™

â€˜yes, if you like,â€™ said alice.

â€˜come, fetch out the plum-cake, old man!â€™ the unicorn went on, turning
from her to the king. â€˜none of your brown bread for me!â€™

â€˜certainly--certainly!â€™ the king muttered, and beckoned to haigha. â€˜open
the bag!â€™ he whispered. â€˜quick! not that one--thatâ€™s full of hay!â€™

haigha took a large cake out of the bag, and gave it to alice to hold,
while he got out a dish and carving-knife. how they all came out of it
alice couldnâ€™t guess. it was just like a conjuring-trick, she

 thought.

the lion had joined them while this was going on: he looked very
tired and sleepy, and his eyes were half shut. â€˜whatâ€™s this!â€™ he said,
blinking lazily at alice, and speaking in a deep hollow tone that
sounded like the tolling of a great bell.

â€˜ah, what is it, now?â€™ the unicorn cried eagerly. â€˜youâ€™ll never guess!
_i_ couldnâ€™t.â€™

the lion looked at alice wearily. â€˜are you animal--vegetable--or
mineral?â€™ he said, yawning at every other word.

â€˜itâ€™s a fabulous monster!â€™ the unicorn cried out, before alice could
reply.

â€˜then hand round the plum-cake, monster,â€™ the lion said, lying down and
putting his chin on his paws. â€˜and sit down, both of you,â€™ (to the king
and the unicorn): â€˜fair play with the cake, you know!â€™

the king was evidently very uncomfortable at having to sit down between
the two great creatures; but there was 
 
 ___________________________
 
he lion replied
angrily, half getting up as he spoke.

here the king interrupted, to prevent the quarrel going on: he was very
nervous, and his voice quite quivered. â€˜all round the town?â€™ he
said. â€˜thatâ€™s a good long way. did you go by the old bridge, or the
market-place? you get the best view by the old bridge.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure i donâ€™t know,â€™ the lion growled out as he lay down again.
â€˜there was too much dust to see anything. what a time the monster is,
cutting up that cake!â€™

alice had seated herself on the bank of a little brook, with the great
dish on her knees, and was sawing away diligently with the knife. â€˜itâ€™s
very provoking!â€™ she said, in reply to the lion (she was getting quite
used to being called â€˜the monsterâ€™). â€˜iâ€™ve cut several slices already,
but they always join on again!â€™

â€˜you donâ€™t know how to manage looking-glass cakes,â€™ the unicorn
remarked. â€˜hand it round first, and cut it afterwards.â€™

this sounded nonsense, but alice very ob
 
 ___________________________
 
ediently got up, and carried the
dish round, and the cake divided itself into three pieces as she did so.
â€˜now cut it up,â€™ said the lion, as she returned to her place with the
empty dish.

â€˜i say, this isnâ€™t fair!â€™ cried the unicorn, as alice sat with the knife
in her hand, very much puzzled how to begin. â€˜the monster has given the
lion twice as much as me!â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s kept none for herself, anyhow,â€™ said the lion. â€˜do you like
plum-cake, monster?â€™

but before alice could answer him, the drums began.

where the noise came from, she couldnâ€™t make out: the air seemed full
of it, and it rang through and through her head till she felt quite
deafened. she started to her feet and sprang across the little brook in
her terror,

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

    *    *    *    *    *    *

  *    *    *    *    *    *    *

and had just time to see the lion and the unicorn rise to their feet,
with angry looks at being interrupted in their feast, before she d

ropped
to her knees, and put her hands over her ears, vainly trying to shut out
the dreadful uproar.

â€˜if that doesnâ€™t â€œdrum them out of town,â€â€™ she thought to herself,
â€˜nothing ever will!â€™




chapter viii. â€˜itâ€™s my own inventionâ€™

after a while the noise seemed gradually to die away, till all was dead
silence, and alice lifted up her head in some alarm. there was no one
to be seen, and her first thought was that she must have been dreaming
about the lion and the unicorn and those queer anglo-saxon messengers.
however, there was the great dish still lying at her feet, on which she
had tried to cut the plum-cake, â€˜so i wasnâ€™t dreaming, after all,â€™ she
said to herself, â€˜unless--unless weâ€™re all part of the same dream. only
i do hope itâ€™s my dream, and not the red kingâ€™s! i donâ€™t like belonging
to 
 
 ___________________________
 
another personâ€™s dream,â€™ she went on in a rather complaining tone:
â€˜iâ€™ve a great mind to go and wake him, and see what happens!â€™

at this moment her thoughts were interrupted by a loud shouting of
â€˜ahoy! ahoy! check!â€™ and a knight dressed in crimson armour came
galloping down upon her, brandishing a great club. just as he reached
her, the horse stopped suddenly: â€˜youâ€™re my prisoner!â€™ the knight cried,
as he tumbled off his horse.

startled as she was, alice was more frightened for him than for herself
at the moment, and watched him with some anxiety as he mounted again.
as soon as he was comfortably in the saddle, he began once more â€˜youâ€™re
my--â€™ but here another voice broke in â€˜ahoy! ahoy! check!â€™ and alice
looked round in some surprise for the new enemy.

this time it was a white knight. he drew up at aliceâ€™s side, and tumbled
off his horse just as the red knight had done: then he got on again,
and the two knights sat and looked at e

ach other for some time without
speaking. alice looked from one to the other in some bewilderment.

â€˜sheâ€™s my prisoner, you know!â€™ the red knight said at last.

â€˜yes, but then _i_ came and rescued her!â€™ the white knight replied.

â€˜well, we must fight for her, then,â€™ said the red knight, as he took up
his helmet (which hung from the saddle, and was something the shape of a
horseâ€™s head), and put it on.

â€˜you will observe the rules of battle, of course?â€™ the white knight
remarked, putting on his helmet too.

â€˜i always do,
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™ said the red knight, and they began banging away at each
other with such fury that alice got behind a tree to be out of the way
of the blows.

â€˜i wonder, now, what the rules of battle are,â€™ she said to herself, as
she watched the fight, timidly peeping out from her hiding-place: â€˜one
rule seems to be, that if one knight hits the other, he knocks him off
his horse, and if he misses, he tumbles off himself--and another rule
seems to be that they hold their clubs with their arms, as if they were
punch and judy--what a noise they make when they tumble! just like
a whole set of fi
 
 ___________________________
 
re-irons falling into the fender! and how quiet the
horses are! they let them get on and off them just as if they were
tables!â€™

another rule of battle, that alice had not noticed, seemed to be that
they always fell on their heads, and the battle ended with their both
falling off in this way, side by side: when they got up again, they
shook hands, and then the red knight mounted and galloped off.

â€˜it was a glorious victory, wasnâ€™t it?â€™ said the white knight, as he
came up panting.

â€˜i donâ€™t know,â€™ alice said doubtfully. â€˜i donâ€™t want to be anybodyâ€™s
prisoner. i want to be a queen.â€™

â€˜so you will, when youâ€™ve crossed the next brook
 
 ___________________________
 
,â€™ said the white
knight. â€˜iâ€™ll see you safe to the end of the wood--and then i must go
back, you know. thatâ€™s the end of my move.â€™

â€˜thank you very much,â€™ said alice. â€˜may i help you off with your
helmet?â€™ it was evidently more than he could manage by himself; however,
she managed to shake him out of it at last.

â€˜now one can breathe more easily,â€™ said the knight, putting back his
shaggy hair with both hands, and turning his gentle face and large mild
eyes to alice. she thought she had never seen such a strange-looking
soldier in all her life.

he was dressed in tin armour, which seemed to fit him very badly, and
he had a queer-shaped little deal box fastened across his shoulder,
upside-down, and with the lid hanging open. alice looked at it with
great curiosity.

â€˜i see youâ€™re admiring my little box.â€™ the knight said in a friendly
tone. â€˜itâ€™s my own invention--to keep clothes and sandwiches in. you see
i carry it upside-down, so that the rain c

anâ€™t get in.â€™

â€˜but the things can get out,â€™ alice gently remarked. â€˜do you know the
lidâ€™s open?â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t know it,â€™ the knight said, a shade of vexation passing over
his face. â€˜then all the things must have fallen out! and the box is no
use without them.â€™ he unfastened it as he spoke, and was just going to
throw it into the bushes, when a sudden thought seemed to strike him,
and he hung it carefully on a tree. â€˜can you guess why i did that?â€™ he
said to alice.

alice shook her head.

â€˜in hopes some bees may make a nest in it--then i should get the honey.â€™

â€˜but youâ€™ve got a bee-hive--or something like one--fastened to the
saddle,â€™ said alice.

â€˜yes, itâ€™s a very good bee-hive,â€™ the knight said in a discontented
tone, â€˜one of the best kind. but not a single bee has come near it yet.
and the other thing is a mouse-trap. i suppose the mice keep the bees
out--or the bees keep the mice out, i donâ€™t know which.â€™

â€˜i was wondering what the m
 
 ___________________________
 
ouse-trap was for,â€™ said alice. â€˜it isnâ€™t
very likely there would be any mice on the horseâ€™s back.â€™

â€˜not very likely, perhaps,â€™ said the knight: â€˜but if they do come, i
donâ€™t choose to have them running all about.â€™

â€˜you see,â€™ he went on after a pause, â€˜itâ€™s as well to be provided for
everything. thatâ€™s the reason the horse has all those anklets round his
feet.â€™

â€˜but what are they for?â€™ alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

â€˜to guard against the bites of sharks,â€™ the knight replied. â€˜itâ€™s an
invention of my own. and now help me on. iâ€™ll go with you to the end of
the wood--whatâ€™s the dish for?â€™

â€˜itâ€™s meant for plum-cake,â€™ said alice.

â€˜weâ€™d better take it with us,â€™ the knight said. â€˜itâ€™ll come in handy if
we find any plum-cake. help me to get it into this bag.â€™

this took a very long time to manage, though alice held the bag open
very carefully, 
 
 ___________________________
 
because the knight was so very awkward in putting in
the dish: the first two or three times that he tried he fell in himself
instead. â€˜itâ€™s rather a tight fit, you see,â€™ he said, as they got it in
a last; â€˜there are so many candlesticks in the bag.â€™ and he hung it
to the saddle, which was already loaded with bunches of carrots, and
fire-irons, and many other things.

â€˜i hope youâ€™ve got your hair well fastened on?â€™ he continued, as they
set off.

â€˜only in the usual way,â€™ alice said, smiling.

â€˜thatâ€™s hardly enough,â€™ he said, anxiously. â€˜you see the wind is so very
strong here. itâ€™s as strong as soup.â€™

â€˜have you invented a plan for keeping the hair from being blown off?â€™
alice enquired.

â€˜not yet,â€™ said the knight. â€˜but iâ€™ve got a plan for keeping it from
falling off.â€™

â€˜i should like to hear it, very much.â€™

â€˜first you take an upright stick,â€™ said the knight. â€˜then you make your
hair creep up it, like a fruit-tree. now the reason 
 
 ___________________________
 
hair falls off is
because it hangs down--things never fall upwards, you know. itâ€™s a plan
of my own invention. you may try it if you like.â€™

it didnâ€™t sound a comfortable plan, alice thought, and for a few minutes
she walked on in silence, puzzling over the idea, and every now and then
stopping to help the poor knight, who certainly was not a good rider.

whenever the horse stopped (which it did very often), he fell off in
front; and whenever it went on again (which it generally did rather
suddenly), he fell off behind. otherwise he kept on pretty well, except
that he had a habit of now and then falling off sideways; and as he
generally did this on the side on which alice w
 
 ___________________________
 
as walking, she soon
found that it was the best plan not to walk quite close to the horse.

â€˜iâ€™m afraid youâ€™ve not had much practice in riding,â€™ she ventured to
say, as she was helping him up from his fifth tumble.

the knight looked very much surprised, and a little offended at the
remark. â€˜what makes you say that?â€™ he asked, as he scrambled back into
the saddle, keeping hold of aliceâ€™s hair with one hand, to save himself
from falling over on the other side.

â€˜because people donâ€™t fall off quite so often, when theyâ€™ve had much
practice.â€™

â€˜iâ€™ve had plenty of practice,â€™ the knight said very gravely: â€˜plenty of
practice!â€™

alice could think of nothing better to say than â€˜indeed?â€™ but she said
it as heartily as she could. they went on a little way in silence after
this, the knight with his eyes shut, muttering to himself, and alice
watching anxiously for
 
 ___________________________
 
 the next tumble.

â€˜the great art of riding,â€™ the knight suddenly began in a loud voice,
waving his right arm as he spoke, â€˜is to keep--â€™ here the sentence ended
as suddenly as it had begun, as the knight fell heavily on the top of
his head exactly in the path where alice was walking. she was quite
frightened this time, and said in an anxious tone, as she picked him up,
â€˜i hope no bones are broken?â€™

â€˜none to speak of,â€™ the knight said, as if he didnâ€™t mind breaking two
or three of them. â€˜the great art of riding, as i was saying, is--to keep
your balance properly. like this, you know--â€™

he let go the bridle, and stretched out both his arms to show alice
what he meant, and this time he fell flat on his back, right under the
horseâ€™s feet.

â€˜plen
 
 ___________________________
 
ty of practice!â€™ he went on repeating, all the time that alice was
getting him on his feet again. â€˜plenty of practice!â€™

â€˜itâ€™s too ridiculous!â€™ cried alice, losing all her patience this time.
â€˜you ought to have a wooden horse on wheels, that you ought!â€™

â€˜does that kind go smoothly?â€™ the knight asked in a tone of great
interest, clasping his arms round the horseâ€™s neck as he spoke, just in
time to save himself from tumbling off again.

â€˜much more smoothly than a live horse,â€™ alice said, with a little scream
of laughter, in spite of all she could do to prevent it.

â€˜iâ€™ll get one,â€™ the knight said thoughtfully to himself. â€˜one 
 
 ___________________________
 
or
two--several.â€™

there was a short silence after this, and then the knight went on again.
â€˜iâ€™m a great hand at inventing things. now, i daresay you noticed, that
last time you picked me up, that i was looking rather thoughtful?â€™

â€˜you were a little grave,â€™ said alice.

â€˜well, just then i was inventing a new way of getting over a gate--would
you like to hear it?â€™

â€˜very much indeed,â€™ alice said politely.

â€˜iâ€™ll tell you how i came to think of it,â€™ said the knight. â€˜you see, i
said to myself, â€œthe only difficulty is with the feet: the head is high
enough already.â€ now, first i put my head on the top of the gate--then i
stand on my head--then the feet are high enough, you see--then iâ€™m over,
you see.â€™

â€˜yes, i suppose youâ€™d be over when that was done,â€™ alice said
thoughtfully: â€˜but donâ€™t you think it would be rather hard?â€™

â€˜i havenâ€™t tried it yet,â€
 
 ___________________________
 
™ the knight said, gravely: â€˜so i canâ€™t tell for
certain--but iâ€™m afraid it would be a little hard.â€™

he looked so vexed at the idea, that alice changed the subject hastily.
â€˜what a curious helmet youâ€™ve got!â€™ she said cheerfully. â€˜is that your
invention too?â€™

the knight looked down proudly at his helmet, which hung from the
saddle. â€˜yes,â€™ he said, â€˜but iâ€™ve invented a better one than that--like
a sugar loaf. when i used to wear it, if i fell off the horse, it always
touched the ground directly. so i had a very little way to fall, you
see--but there was the danger of falling into it, to be sure. that
happened to me on
 
 ___________________________
 
ce--and the worst of it was, before i could get out
again, the other white knight came and put it on. he thought it was his
own helmet.â€™

the knight looked so solemn about it that alice did not dare to laugh.
â€˜iâ€™m afraid you must have hurt him,â€™ she said in a trembling voice,
â€˜being on the top of his head.â€™

â€˜i had to kick him, of course,â€™ the knight said, very seriously. â€˜and
then he took the helmet off again--but it took hours and hours to get me
out. i was as fast as--as lightning, you know.â€™

â€˜but thatâ€™s a different kind of fastness,â€™ alice objected.

the knight shook his head. â€˜it was all kinds of fastness with me, i can
assure you!â€™ he said. h
 
 ___________________________
 
e raised his hands in some excitement as he said
this, and instantly rolled out of the saddle, and fell headlong into a
deep ditch.

alice ran to the side of the ditch to look for him. she was rather
startled by the fall, as for some time he had kept on very well, and she
was afraid that he really was hurt this time. however, though she could
see nothing but the soles of his feet, she was much relieved to hear
that he was talking on in his usual tone. â€˜all kinds of fastness,â€™
he repeated: â€˜but it was careless of him to put another manâ€™s helmet
on--with the man in it, too.â€™

â€˜how can you go on talking so quietly, head d
 
 ___________________________
 
ownwards?â€™ alice asked, as
she dragged him out by the feet, and laid him in a heap on the bank.

the knight looked surprised at the question. â€˜what does it matter where
my body happens to be?â€™ he said. â€˜my mind goes on working all the same.
in fact, the more head downwards i am, the more i keep inventing new
things.â€™

â€˜now the cleverest thing of the sort that i ever did,â€™ he went on after
a pause, â€˜was inventing a new pudding during the meat-course.â€™

â€˜in time to have it cooked for the next co
 
 ___________________________
 
urse?â€™ said alice. â€˜well,
not the next course,â€™ the knight said in a slow thoughtful tone: â€˜no,
certainly not the next course.â€™

â€˜then it would have to be the next day. i suppose you wouldnâ€™t have two
pudding-courses in one dinner?â€™

â€˜well, not the next day,â€™ the knight repeated as before: â€˜not the next
day. in fact,â€™ he went on, holding his head down, and his voice getting
lower and lower, â€˜i donâ€™t believe that pudding ever was cooked! in fact,
i donâ€™t believe that pudding ever will 
 
 ___________________________
 
be cooked! and yet it was a very
clever pudding to invent.â€™

â€˜what did you mean it to be made of?â€™ alice asked, hoping to cheer him
up, for the poor knight seemed quite low-spirited about it.

â€˜it began with blotting paper,â€™ the knight answered with a groan.

â€˜that wouldnâ€™t be very nice, iâ€™m afraid--â€™

â€˜not very nice alone,â€™ he interrupted, quite eagerly: â€˜but youâ€™ve no
idea what a difference it makes mixing it with other things--such as
gunpowder and sealing-wax. and here i must leave you.â€™ they had just
come to the end of the wood.

alice could only look puzzled: she was th
 
 ___________________________
 
inking of the pudding.

â€˜you are sad,â€™ the knight said in an anxious tone: â€˜let me sing you a
song to comfort you.â€™

â€˜is it very long?â€™ alice asked, for she had heard a good deal of poetry
that day.

â€˜itâ€™s long,â€™ said the knight, â€˜but very, very beautiful. everybody that
hears me sing it--either it brings the tears into their eyes, or else--â€™

â€˜or else what?â€™ said alice, for the knight had made a sudden pause.

â€˜or else it doesnâ€™t, you know. the name of the song is called â€œhaddocksâ€™
eyes.â€â€™

â€˜oh, thatâ€™s the name of the song, is it?â€™ alice said, trying to feel
interested.

â€˜no, you donâ€™t understand,â€™ the knight said, looking a little vexed.
â€˜thatâ€™s what the name is called. the name really is â€œthe aged aged
man.â€â€™

â€˜then i ought to have said â€œthatâ€™s what the song is calledâ€?â€™ alice
corrected herself.

â€˜no, you oughtn
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™t: thatâ€™s quite another thing! the song is called â€œways
and meansâ€: but thatâ€™s only what itâ€™s called, you know!â€™

â€˜well, what is the song, then?â€™ said alice, who was by this time
completely bewildered.

â€˜i was coming to that,â€™ the knight said. â€˜the song really is â€œa-sitting
on a gateâ€: and the tuneâ€™s my own invention.â€™

so saying, he stopped his horse and let the reins fall on its neck:
then, slowly beating time with one hand, and with a faint smile lighting
up his gentle foolish face, as if he enjoyed the music of his song, he
began.

of all the strange things that alice saw in her journey through the
looking-glass, this was the one

  and muttered mumblingly and low,
     as if his mouth were full of dough,
     who snorted like a buffalo--
     that summer evening, long ago,
      a-sitting on a gate.â€™


as the knight sang the last words of the ballad, he gathered up the
reins, and turned his horseâ€™s head along the road by which they had
come. â€˜youâ€™ve only a few yards to go,â€™ he said, â€˜down the hill and over
that little brook, and then youâ€™ll be a queen--but youâ€™ll stay and
see me off first?â€™ he added as alice turned with an eager look in the
direction to which he pointed. â€˜i shanâ€™t be long. youâ€™ll wait and wave
your handkerchief when i get to that turn in the road? i think itâ€™ll
encourage me, you see.â€™

â€˜of course iâ€™ll wait,â€™ said alice: â€˜and thank you very much for coming
so far--and for the song--i liked it very much.â€™

â€˜i hope so,â€™ the knight said doubtfully: â€˜but you didnâ€™t cry so much as
i thought you would.â€™

so they shook hands, and then the knight rode slowly aw

ay into the
forest. â€˜it wonâ€™t take long to see him off, i expect,â€™ alice said to
herself, as she stood watching him. â€˜there he goes! right on his head as
usual! however, he gets on again pretty easily--that comes of having so
many things hung round the horse--â€™ so she went on talking to herself,
as she watched the horse walking leisurely along the road, and the
knight tumbling off, first on one side and then on the other. after
the fourth or fifth tumble he reached the turn, and then she waved her
handkerchief to him, and waited till he was out of sight.

erself down to rest on a lawn as soft as moss, with little
flower-beds dotted about it here and there. â€˜oh, how glad i am to get
here! and what is this on my head?â€™ she exclaimed in a tone of dismay,
as she put her hands up to something very heavy, and fitted tight all
round her head.

â€˜but how can it have got there without my knowing it?â€™ she said to
herself, as she lifted it off, and set it on her lap to make out what it
could possibly be.

it was a golden crown.




chapter ix. queen alice

â€˜well, this is grand!â€™ said alice. â€˜i never expected i should be a queen
so soon--and iâ€™ll tell you what it is, your majesty,â€™ she went on in
a severe tone (she was always rather fond of scolding herself), â€˜itâ€™ll
never do for you to be lolling about on the grass like that! queens have
to be dignified, you know!â€™

so she got up and walked about--rather stiffly just at first, as she was
afraid that the crown might come off: but she comforted herself with the
thought that there wa

didnâ€™t feel a bit surprised
at finding the red queen and the white queen sitting close to her, one
on each side: she would have liked very much to ask them how they came
there, but she feared it would not be quite civil. however, there would
be no harm, she thought, in asking if the game was over. â€˜please, would
you tell me--â€™ she began, looking timidly at the red queen.

â€˜speak when youâ€™re spoken to!â€™ the queen sharply interrupted her.

â€˜but if everybody obeyed that rule,â€™ said alice, who was always ready
for a little argument, â€˜and if you only spoke when you were spoken to,
and the other person always waited for you to begin, you see nobody
would ever say anything, so that--â€™

â€˜ridiculous!â€™ cried the queen. â€˜why, donâ€™t you see, child--â€™ here she
broke off with a frown, and, after thinking for a minute, suddenly
changed the subject of the conversation. â€˜what do you mean by â€œif you
really are a queenâ€? what right have you to call yourself so? you canâ€™t

be a queen, you know, till youâ€™ve passed the proper examination. and the
sooner we begin it, the better.â€™

â€˜i only said â€œifâ€!â€™ poor alice pleaded in a piteous tone.

the two queens looked at each other, and the red queen remarked, with a
little shudder, â€˜she says she only said â€œifâ€--â€™

â€˜but she said a great deal more than that!â€™ the white queen moaned,
wringing her hands. â€˜oh, ever so much more than that!â€™

â€˜so you did, you know,â€™ the red queen said to alice. â€˜always speak the
truth--think before you speak--and write it down afterwards.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m sure i didnâ€™t mean--â€™ alice was beginning, but the red queen
interrupted her impatiently.

â€˜thatâ€™s just what i complain of! you should have meant! what do you
suppose is the use of child without any meaning? even a joke should
have some meaning--and a childâ€™s more important than a joke, i hope. you
couldnâ€™t deny that, even if you tried with both hands.â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t deny things with my 
 
 ___________________________
 
hands,â€™ alice objected.

â€˜nobody said you did,â€™ said the red queen. â€˜i said you couldnâ€™t if you
tried.â€™

â€˜sheâ€™s in that state of mind,â€™ said the white queen, â€˜that she wants to
deny something--only she doesnâ€™t know what to deny!â€™

â€˜a nasty, vicious temper,â€™ the red queen remarked; and then there was an
uncomfortable silence for a minute or two.

the red queen broke the silence by saying to the white queen, â€˜i invite
you to aliceâ€™s dinner-party this afternoon.â€™

the white queen smiled feebly, and said â€˜and i invite you.â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t know i was to have a party at all,â€™ said alice; â€˜but if there
is to be one, i think _i_ ought to invite the guests.â€™

â€˜we gave you the opportunity of doing it,â€™ the red queen remarked: â€˜but
i daresay youâ€™ve not had many lessons in manners yet?â€™

â€˜manners are not taught in lessons,â€™ said alice. â€˜lessons teach you to
do sums, and things of that sort.â€™

â€˜and
 
 ___________________________
 
 you do addition?â€™ the white queen asked. â€˜whatâ€™s one and one and
one and one and one and one and one and one and one and one?â€™

â€˜i donâ€™t know,â€™ said alice. â€˜i lost count.â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do addition,â€™ the red queen interrupted. â€˜can you do
subtraction? take nine from eight.â€™

â€˜nine from eight i canâ€™t, you know,â€™ alice replied very readily: â€˜but--â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do subtraction,â€™ said the white queen. â€˜can you do division?
divide a loaf by a knife--whatâ€™s the answer to that?â€™

â€˜i suppose--â€™ alice was beginning, but the red queen answered for her.
â€˜bread-and-butter, of course. try another subtraction sum. take a bone
from a dog: what remains?â€™

alice considered. â€˜the bone wouldnâ€™t remain, of course, if i took
it--and the dog wouldnâ€™t remain; it would come to bite me--and iâ€™m sure
i
 
 ___________________________
 
 shouldnâ€™t remain!â€™

â€˜then you think nothing would remain?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜i think thatâ€™s the answer.â€™

â€˜wrong, as usual,â€™ said the red queen: â€˜the dogâ€™s temper would remain.â€™

â€˜but i donâ€™t see how--â€™

â€˜why, look here!â€™ the red queen cried. â€˜the dog would lose its temper,
wouldnâ€™t it?â€™

â€˜perhaps it would,â€™ alice replied cautiously.

â€˜then if the dog went away, its temper would remain!â€™ the queen
exclaimed triumphantly.

alice said, as gravely as she could, â€˜they might go different ways.â€™ but
she couldnâ€™t help thinking to herself, â€˜what dreadful nonsense we are
talking!â€™

â€˜she canâ€™t do sums a bit!â€™ the queens said together, with great
emphasis.

â€˜can you do sums?â€™ alice said, turning suddenly on the white queen, for
she didnâ€™t like being found fault with so much.

the queen gasped and shut her eyes. â€˜i can do addition, if you give me
time--but i canâ€™t do subtraction, under any circumstances!

â€™

â€˜of course you know your a b c?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜to be sure i do.â€™ said alice.

â€˜so do i,â€™ the white queen whispered: â€˜weâ€™ll often say it over together,
dear. and iâ€™ll tell you a secret--i can read words of one letter! isnâ€™t
that grand! however, donâ€™t be discouraged. youâ€™ll come to it in time.â€™

here the red queen began again. â€˜can you answer useful questions?â€™ she
said. â€˜how is bread made?â€™

â€˜i know that!â€™ alice cried eagerly. â€˜you take some flour--â€™

â€˜where do you pick the flower?â€™ the white queen asked. â€˜in a garden, or
in the hedges?â€™

â€˜well, it isnâ€™t picked at all,â€™ alice explained: â€˜itâ€™s ground--â€™

â€˜how many acres of ground?â€™ said the white queen. â€˜you mustnâ€™t leave out
so many things.â€™

â€˜fan her head!â€™ the red queen anxiously interrupted. â€˜sheâ€™ll be feverish
after so much thinking.â€™ so they set to work and fanned her with bunches
of leaves, till she had

 to beg them to leave off, it blew her hair about
so.

â€˜sheâ€™s all right again now,â€™ said the red queen. â€˜do you know languages?
whatâ€™s the french for fiddle-de-dee?â€™

â€˜fiddle-de-deeâ€™s not english,â€™ alice replied gravely.

â€˜who ever said it was?â€™ said the red queen.

alice thought she saw a way out of the difficulty this time. â€˜if youâ€™ll
tell me what language â€œfiddle-de-deeâ€ is, iâ€™ll tell you the french for
it!â€™ she exclaimed triumphantly.

but the red queen drew herself up rather stiffly, and said â€˜queens never
make bargains.â€™

â€˜i wish queens never asked questions,â€™ alice thought to herself.

â€˜donâ€™t let us quarrel,â€™ the white queen said in an anxious tone. â€˜what
is the cause of lightning?â€™

â€˜the cause of lightning,â€™ alice said v

ery decidedly, for she felt quite
certain about this, â€˜is the thunder--no, no!â€™ she hastily corrected
herself. â€˜i meant the other way.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s too late to correct it,â€™ said the red queen: â€˜when youâ€™ve once
said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences.â€™

â€˜which reminds me--â€™ the white queen said, looking down and nervously
clasping and unclasping her hands, â€˜we had such a thunderstorm last
tuesday--i mean one of the last set of tuesdays, you know.â€™

alice was puzzled. â€˜in our country,â€™ she remarked, â€˜thereâ€™s only one day
at a time.â€™

the red queen said, â€˜thatâ€™s a poor thin way of doing things. now here,
we mostly have days and nights two or three at a time, and sometimes
in the winter we take as many as five nights together--for warmth, you
know.â€™

â€˜are five nights warmer than one night, then?â€™ alice ventured to ask.

â€˜five times as warm, of course.â€™

â€˜but they should be five times as cold, by the same rule--â€™

â€˜jus

t so!â€™ cried the red queen. â€˜five times as warm, and five times
as cold--just as iâ€™m five times as rich as you are, and five times as
clever!â€™

alice sighed and gave it up. â€˜itâ€™s exactly like a riddle with no
answer!â€™ she thought.

â€˜humpty dumpty saw it too,â€™ the white queen went on in a low voice, more
as if she were talking to herself. â€˜he came to the door with a corkscrew
in his hand--â€™

â€˜what did he want?â€™ said the red queen.

â€˜he said he would come in,â€™ the white queen went on, â€˜because he was
looking for a hippopotamus. now, as it happened, there wasnâ€™t such a
thing in the house, that morning.â€™

â€˜is there

â€˜well, only on thursdays,â€™ said the queen.

â€˜i know what he came for,â€™ said alice: â€˜he wanted to punish the fish,
because--â€™

here the white queen began again. â€˜it was such a thunderstorm, you canâ€™t
think!â€™ (â€˜she never could, you know,â€™ said the red queen.) â€˜and part of
the roof came off, and ever so much thunder got in--and it went
rolling round the room in great lumps--and knocking over the tables and
things--till i was so frightened, i couldnâ€™t remember my own name!â€™

alice thought to herself, â€˜i never should try to remember my name in the
middle of

an accident! where would be the use of it?â€™ but she did not
say this aloud, for fear of hurting the poor queenâ€™s feeling.

â€˜your majesty must excuse her,â€™ the red queen said to alice, taking
one of the white queenâ€™s hands in her own, and gently stroking it:
â€˜she means well, but she canâ€™t help saying foolish things, as a general
rule.â€™

the white queen looked timidly at alice, who felt she ought to say
something kind, but really couldnâ€™t think of anything at the moment.

â€˜she never was really well brought up,â€™ the red queen went on: â€˜but
itâ€™s amazing how good-tempered she is! pat her on the head, and see how
pleased sheâ€™ll be!â€™ but this was more than alice had courage to do.

â€˜a little kindness--and putting her hair in papers--would do wonders
with her--â€™

the white queen gave a deep sigh, and laid her head on aliceâ€™s shoulder.
â€˜i am so sleepy?
 
 ___________________________
 
â€™ she moaned.

â€˜sheâ€™s tired, poor thing!â€™ said the red queen. â€˜smooth her hair--lend
her your nightcap--and sing her a soothing lullaby.â€™

â€˜i havenâ€™t got a nightcap with me,â€™ said alice, as she tried to obey the
first direction: â€˜and i donâ€™t know any soothing lullabies.â€™

â€˜i must do it myself, then,â€™ said the red queen, and she began:


   â€˜hush-a-by lady, in aliceâ€™s lap!
   till the feastâ€™s ready, weâ€™ve time for a nap:
   when the feastâ€™s over, weâ€™ll go to the ball--
   red queen, and white queen, and alice, and all!


â€˜and now you know the words,â€™ she added, as she put her head down on
aliceâ€™s other shoulder, â€˜just sing it through to me. iâ€™m getting sleepy,
too.â€™ in another moment both queens were fast asleep, and snoring loud.

â€˜what am i to do?â€™ exclaimed alice, looking about in great perplexity,
as first one round head, and

ngland--it couldnâ€™t, you know,
because there never was more than one queen at a time. do wake up, you
heavy things!â€™ she went on in an impatient tone; but there was no answer
but a gentle snoring.

the snoring got more distinct every minute, and sounded more like a
tune: at last she could even make out the words, and she listened so
eagerly that, when the two great heads vanished from her lap, she hardly
missed them.

she was standing before an arched doorway over which were the words
queen alice in large letters, and on each side of the arch there was a
bell-handle; one was marked â€˜visitorsâ€™ bell,â€™ and the other â€˜servantsâ€™
bell.â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll wait till the songâ€™s over,â€™ thought alice, â€˜and then iâ€™ll
ring--the--which bell must i ring?â€™ she went on, very much puzzled by
the names. â€˜iâ€™m not a visitor, and iâ€™m not a servant. there ought to be
one marked â€œqueen,â€ you know--â€™

just then the door opened a little way, and a creature with a long beak
put its head
 
 ___________________________
 
 out for a moment and said â€˜no admittance till the week
after next!â€™ and shut the door again with a bang.

alice knocked and rang in vain for a long time, but at last, a very old
frog, who was sitting under a tree, got up and hobbled slowly towards
her: he was dressed in bright yellow, and had enormous boots on.

â€˜what is it, now?â€™ the frog said in a deep hoarse whisper.

alice turned round, ready to find fault with anybody. â€˜whereâ€™s the
servant whose business it is to answer the door?â€™ she began angrily.

â€˜which door?â€™ said the frog.

alice almost stamped with irritation at the slow drawl in which he
spoke. â€˜this door, of course!â€™

the frog looked at the door with his large dull eyes for a minute:
then he went nearer and rubbed it with his thumb, as if he were trying
whether the paint would come off; then he looked at alice.

â€˜to answer the door?â€™ h
 
 ___________________________
 
e said. â€˜whatâ€™s it been asking of?â€™ he was so
hoarse that alice could scarcely hear him.

â€˜i donâ€™t know what you mean,â€™ she said.

â€˜i talks english, doesnâ€™t i?â€™ the frog went on. â€˜or are you deaf? what
did it ask you?â€™

â€˜nothing!â€™ alice said impatiently. â€˜iâ€™ve been knocking at it!â€™

â€˜shouldnâ€™t do that--shouldnâ€™t do that--â€™ the frog muttered. â€˜vexes it,
you know.â€™ then he went up and gave the door a kick with one of his
great feet. â€˜you let it alone,â€™ he panted out, as he hobbled back to his
tree, â€˜and itâ€™ll let you alone, you know.â€™

at this moment the door was flung open, and a shrill voice was heard
singing:


   â€˜to the looking-glass world it was alice that said,
   â€œiâ€™ve a sceptre in hand,
 
 ___________________________
 
 iâ€™ve a crown on my head;
   let the looking-glass creatures, whatever they be,
   come and dine with the red queen, the white queen, and me.â€â€™


and hundreds of voices joined in the chorus:


  â€˜then fill up the glasses as quick as you can,
  and sprinkle the table with buttons and bran:
  put cats in the coffee, and mice in the tea--
  and welcome queen alice with thirty-times-three!â€™


then followed a confused noise of cheering, and alice thought to
herself, â€˜thirty times three makes ninety. i wonder if any oneâ€™s
counting?â€™ in a minute there was silence again, and the same shrill
voice sang another verse;


  â€˜â€œo looking-glass creatures,â€ quoth alice, â€œdraw near!
  â€˜tis an honour to see me, a favour to hear:
  â€˜tis a privilege high to have dinner and tea
  along with the red queen, the white queen, and me!â€â€™


then came the chorus again:--


  â€˜then fill up the glasses with treacle and ink,
  or anything 
 
 ___________________________
 
else that is pleasant to drink:
  mix sand with the cider, and wool with the wine--
  and welcome queen alice with ninety-times-nine!â€™


â€˜ninety times nine!â€™ alice repeated in despair, â€˜oh, thatâ€™ll never
be done! iâ€™d better go in at once--â€™ and there was a dead silence the
moment she appeared.

alice glanced nervously along the table, as she walked up the large
hall, and noticed that there were about fifty guests, of all kinds: some
were animals, some birds, and there were even a few flowers among them.
â€˜iâ€™m glad theyâ€™ve come without waiting to be asked,â€™ she thought: â€˜i
should never have known who were the right people to invite!â€™

there were three chairs at the head of the table; the red and white
queens had already taken two of them, but the middle one was empty.
alice sat do

wn in it, rather uncomfortable in the silence, and longing
for some one to speak.

at last the red queen began. â€˜youâ€™ve missed the soup and fish,â€™ she
said. â€˜put on the joint!â€™ and the waiters set a leg of mutton before
alice, who looked at it rather anxiously, as she had never had to carve
a joint before.

â€˜you look a little shy; let me introduce you to that leg of mutton,â€™
said the red queen. â€˜alice--mutton; mutton--alice.â€™ the leg of mutton
got up in the dish and made a little bow to alice; and alice returned
the bow, not knowing whether to be frightened or amused.

â€˜may i give you a slice?â€™ she said, taking up the knife and fork, and
looking from one queen to the other.

â€˜certainly not,â€™ the red queen said, very decidedly: â€˜it isnâ€™t etiquette
to cut any one youâ€™ve been introduced to. remove the joint!â€™ and the
waiters carried it off, and brought a large plum-pudding in its place.

â€˜i wonâ€™
 
 ___________________________
 
t be introduced to the pudding, please,â€™ alice said rather
hastily, â€˜or we shall get no dinner at all. may i give you some?â€™

but the red queen looked sulky, and growled â€˜pudding--alice;
alice--pudding. remove the pudding!â€™ and the waiters took it away so
quickly that alice couldnâ€™t return its bow.

however, she didnâ€™t see why the red queen should be the only one to give
orders, so, as an experiment, she called out â€˜waiter! bring back the
pudding!â€™ and there it was again in a moment like a conjuring-trick. it
was so large that she couldnâ€™t help feeling a little shy with it, as she
had been with the mutton; however, she conquered her shyness by a great
effort and cut a slice and handed it to the red queen.

â€˜what impertinence!â€™ said the pudding. â€˜i 
 
 ___________________________
 
wonder how youâ€™d like it, if i
were to cut a slice out of you, you creature!â€™

it spoke in a thick, suety sort of voice, and alice hadnâ€™t a word to say
in reply: she could only sit and look at it and gasp.

â€˜make a remark,â€™ said the red queen: â€˜itâ€™s ridiculous to leave all the
conversation to the pudding!â€™

â€˜do you know, iâ€™ve had such a quantity of poetry repeated to me to-day,â€™
alice began, a little frightened at finding that, the moment she opened
her lips, there was dead silence, and all eyes were fixed upon her; â€˜and
itâ€™s a very curious thing, i think--every poem was about fishes in some
way. do you know why theyâ€™re so fond of fishes, all about here?â€™

she spoke to the red queen, whose answer was a little wide of the mark.
â€˜as to fishes,â€™ she said, very slowly and solemnly, putting her mouth
close to aliceâ€™s ear, â€˜her white majesty knows a lovely riddle--
 
 ___________________________
 
all in
poetry--all about fishes. shall she repeat it?â€™

â€˜her red majestyâ€™s very kind to mention it,â€™ the white queen murmured
into aliceâ€™s other ear, in a voice like the cooing of a pigeon. â€˜it
would be such a treat! may i?â€™

â€˜please do,â€™ alice said very politely.

the white queen laughed with delight, and stroked aliceâ€™s cheek. then
she began:


    â€˜â€œfirst, the fish must be caught.â€
   that is easy: a baby, i think, could have caught it.
    â€œnext, the fish must be bought.â€
   that is easy: a penny, i think, would have bought it.

    â€œnow cook me the fish!â€
   that is easy, and will not take more than a minute.
    â€œlet it lie in a dish!â€
   that is easy, because it already is in it.

    â€œbring it here! let me sup!â€
   it is easy to set such a dish on the table.
    â€œtake the dish

-cover up!â€
   ah, that is so hard that i fear iâ€™m unable!

    for it holds it like glue--
  holds the lid to the dish, while it lies in the middle:
    which is easiest to do,
  un-dish-cover the fish, or dishcover the riddle?â€™


â€˜take a minute to think about it, and then guess,â€™ said the red queen.
â€˜meanwhile, weâ€™ll drink your health--queen aliceâ€™s health!â€™ she screamed
at the top of her voice, and all the guests began drinking it directly,
and very queerly they managed it: some of them put their glasses upon
their heads like extinguishers, and drank all that trickled down their
faces--others upset the decanters, and drank the wine as it ran off
the edges of the table--and three of them (who looked like kangaroos)
scrambled into the dish of roast mutton, and began eagerly lapping up
the gravy, â€˜just like pigs in a trough!â€™ thoug

ht alice.

â€˜you ought to return thanks in a neat speech,â€™ the red queen said,
frowning at alice as she spoke.

â€˜we must support you, you know,â€™ the white queen whispered, as alice got
up to do it, very obediently, but a little frightened.

â€˜thank you very much,â€™ she whispered in reply, â€˜but i can do quite well
without.â€™

â€˜that wouldnâ€™t be at all the thing,â€™ the red queen said very decidedly:
so alice tried to submit to it with a good grace.

(â€˜and they did push so!â€™ she said afterwards, when she was telling her
sister the history of the feast. â€˜you would have thought they wanted to
squeeze me flat!â€™)

in fact it was rather difficult for her to keep in her place while she
made her speech: the two queens pushed her so, one on each side, that
they nearly lifted her up into the air: â€˜i rise to return thanks--â€™
alice began: and she really did rise as she spoke, several inches; but
sh

e got hold of the edge of the table, and managed to pull herself down
again.

â€˜take care of yourself!â€™ screamed the white queen, seizing aliceâ€™s hair
with both her hands. â€˜somethingâ€™s going to happen!â€™

and then (as alice afterwards described it) all sorts of things happened
in a moment. the candles all grew up to the ceiling, looking something
like a bed of rushes with fireworks at the top. as to the bottles, they
each took a pair of plates, which they hastily fitted on as wings, and
so, with forks for legs, went fluttering about in all directions: â€˜and
very like birds they look,â€™ alice thought to herself, as well as she
could in the dreadful confusion that was beginning.

at this moment she heard a hoarse 
 
 ___________________________
 
laugh at her side, and turned to see
what was the matter with the white queen; but, instead of the queen,
there was the leg of mutton sitting in the chair. â€˜here i am!â€™ cried a
voice from the soup tureen, and alice turned again, just in time to see
the queenâ€™s broad good-natured face grinning at her for a moment over
the edge of the tureen, before she disappeared into the soup.

there was not a moment to be lost. already several of the guests were
lying down in the dishes, and the soup ladle was walking up the table
towards aliceâ€™s chair, and beckoning to her impatiently to get out of
its way.

â€˜i canâ€™t stand this any longer!â€™ she cried as she jumped up and seized
the table-cloth with both hands

: one good pull, and plates, dishes,
guests, and candles came crashing down together in a heap on the floor.

â€˜and as for you,â€™ she went on, turning fiercely upon the red queen, whom
she considered as the cause of all the mischief--but the queen was no
longer at her side--she had suddenly dwindled down to the size of a
little doll, and was now on the table, merrily running round and round
after her own shawl, which was trailing behind her.

at any other time, alice would have felt surprised at this, but she was
far too much excited to be surprised at anything now. â€˜as for you,â€™
she repeated, catching hold of the little creature in the very act of
jumping over a bottle which had just lighted upon the table, â€˜iâ€™ll shake
you into a kitten, that i will!â€™

she took her off the table as she spoke, and shook her backwards and
forwards with all her might.

the red queen made no resistance whatever; only her face grew very
small, a

shaking her, she kept on growing shorter--and fatter--and softer--and
rounder--and--

--and it really was a kitten, after all.




chapter xii. which dreamed it?

â€˜your majesty shouldnâ€™t purr so loud,â€™ alice said, rubbing her eyes, and
addressing the kitten, respectfully, yet with some severity. â€˜you
woke me out of oh! such a nice dream! and youâ€™ve been along with me,
kitty--all through the looking-glass world. did you know it, dear?â€™

it is a very inconvenient habit of kittens (alice had once made the
remark) that, whatever you say to them, they always purr. â€˜if they would
only purr for â€œyesâ€ and mew for â€œno,â€ or any rule of that sort,â€™ she had
said, â€˜so that one could keep up

a conversation! but how can you talk
with a person if they always say the same thing?â€™

on this occasion the kitten only purred: and it was impossible to guess
whether it meant â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜no.â€™

so alice hunted among the chessmen on the table till she had found the
red queen: then she went down on her knees on the hearth-rug, and put
the kitten and the queen to look at each other. â€˜now, kitty!â€™ she cried,
clapping her hands triumphantly. â€˜confess that was what you turned
into!â€™

(â€˜but it wouldnâ€™t look at it,â€™ she said, when she was explaining the
thing afterwards to her sister: â€˜it turned away its head, and pretended
not to see it: but it looked a little ashamed of itself, so i

â€˜sit up a little more stiffly, dear!â€™ alice cried with a merry laugh.
â€˜and curtsey while youâ€™re thinking what to--what to purr. it saves time,
remember!â€™ and she caught it up and gave it one little kiss, â€˜just in
honour of having been a red queen.â€™

â€˜snowdrop, my pet!â€™ she went on, looking over her shoulder at the white
kitten, which was still patiently undergoing its toilet, â€˜when will
dinah have finished with your white majesty, i wonder? that must be the
reason you were so untidy in my dream--dinah! do you know that yo

              ----


         a boat beneath a sunny sky,
         lingering onward dreamily
         in an evening of july--

         children three that nestle near,
         eager eye and willing ear,
         pleased a simple tale to hear--

         long has paled that sunny sky:
         echoes fade and memories die.
         autumn frosts have slain july.

         still she haunts me, phantomwise,
         alice moving under skies
         never seen by waking eyes.

         children yet, the tale to hear,
         eager eye and willing ear,
         lovingly shall nestle near.

         in a wonderland they lie,
         dreaming as the days go by,
         dreaming as the summers die:

         ever drifting down the stream--
         lingering in the golden gleam--
         life, what is it but a dream?
