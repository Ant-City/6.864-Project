Edward - 
      York's eldest son, Edward inherits York's struggle for the throne, and seizes it soon after his father is killed in battle. But the new power soon blinds him to the need to listen to his advisors and brothers, and he marries Lady Gray, thus, alienating Warwick and the king of France, who had negotiated for a wedding to the French king's sister. Edward falls from the throne and is imprisoned but freed by Richard and again becomes king at the end of the play.
