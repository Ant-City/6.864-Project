Supersymmetry - 
                    A
principle of symmetry relating the properties of particles with
a whole-number quantity of spin (bosons) to those with half a whole
number of spin (fermions). Supersymmetry posits that all elementary matter
particles have corresponding superpartner force carrier particles.
No one has yet observed these theoretical superpartners, which are
thought to be even larger than their counterparts.
