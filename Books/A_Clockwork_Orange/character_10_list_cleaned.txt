[CHARACTER] - 
                played
by aubrey morris
                alex's parole officer.
[CHARACTER] preaches to alex about reforming his ways but seems to be
an unsavory character himself. the first time we see him, he surprises
alex in his apartment. alex is dressed only in his underwear, but
[CHARACTER] encourages him to sit down next to him on the bed while
he warns him about not getting himself in trouble. carried away
by his own excitement, he grabs alex's testicles. he speaks in a
whiny, high-pitched voice and ends many of his sentences with "yes?"
his mannerisms and behavior suggest the ineffectiveness of logic
in understanding and addressing the causes of violence, as well
as the ineffectiveness of adults who try to control rebellious youth.
