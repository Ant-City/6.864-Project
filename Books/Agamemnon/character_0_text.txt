preface


the sense of difficulty, and indeed of awe, with which a scholar
approaches the task of translating the _agamemnon_ depends directly on its
greatness as poetry. it is in part a matter of diction. the language of
aeschylus is an extraordinary thing, the syntax stiff and simple, the
vocabulary obscure, unexpected, and steeped in splendour. its
peculiarities cannot be disregarded, or the translation will be false in
character. yet not milton himself could produce in english the same great
music, and a translator who should strive ambitiously to represent the
complex effect of the original would clog his own po

wers of expression and
strain his instrument to breaking. but, apart from the diction in this
narrower sense, there is a quality of atmosphere surrounding the
_agamemnon_ which seems almost to defy reproduction in another setting,
because it depends in large measure on the position of the play in the
historical development of greek literature.

if we accept the view that all art to some extent, and greek tragedy in a
very special degree, moves in its course of development from religion to
entertainment, from a service to a performance, the _agamemnon_ seems to
stand at a critical point where the balance of the two elements is near
perfection. the drama has come

 fully to life, but the religion has not yet
faded to a formality. the _agamemnon_ is not, like aeschylus' _suppliant
women_, a statue half-hewn out of the rock. it is a real play, showing
clash of character and situation, suspense and movement, psychological
depth and subtlety. yet it still remains something more than a play. its
atmosphere is not quite of this world. in the long lyrics especially one
feels that the guiding emotion is not the entertainer's wish to thrill an
audience, not even perhaps the pure artist's wish to create beauty, but
something deeper and more pro

phetic, a passionate contemplation and
expression of truth; though of course the truth in question is something
felt rather than stated, something that pervades life, an eternal and
majestic rhythm like the movement of the stars.

thus, if longinus is right in defining sublimity as "the ring, or
resonance, of greatness of soul," one sees in part where the sublimity of
the _agamemnon_ comes from. and it is worth noting that the faults which
some critics have found in the play are in harmony with this conclusion.
for the sublimity that is rooted in religion tolerates some faults and
utterly refuses to tolerate others. the _agamemnon_ may be slow in getting
to work; it may be stiff with antique conventions. it never approaches to
being cheap or insincere or shallow or sentimental or showy. it never
ceases to be genuinely a "criticism of life." the theme which it treats,

ed, and then seeks for some gleam of escape,
some breaking of the endless chain of "evil duty." in the old order of
earth and heaven there was no such escape. each blow called for the return
blow and must do so _ad infinitum_. but, according to aeschylus, there is
a new ruler now in heaven, one who has both sinned and suffered and
thereby grown wise. he is zeus the third power, zeus the saviour, and his
gift to mankind is the ability through suffering to learn (pp. 7 f.)

at the opening of the _agamemnon_ we find clytemnestra alienated from her
husband and secretly befriended with his ancestral enemy, aigisthos. the
air is heavy and throbbing with hate; hate which is evil but has its due
cause. agamemnon, obeying the prophet calchas, when the fleet lay
storm-bound at aulis, had given his own daughter, iphigenîa, as a human
sacrifice. and if we ask how a sane man had consented to such an act, we
are told of his gradual temptation; the deadly excuse offered by ancient
superstition; and above all

saster happening. and when it does happen they
are, as they have described themselves, weak and very old, "dreams
wandering in the daylight."

the characters of this play seem, in a sense, to arise out of the theme
and consequently to have, amid all their dramatic solidity, a further
significance which is almost symbolic. cassandra is, as it were, the
incarnation of that knowledge which herodotus describes as the crown of
sorrow, the knowledge which sees and warns and cannot help (hdt. ix. 16).
agamemnon himself, the king of kings, triumphant and doomed, is a symbol
of pride and the fall of pride. we must not think of him as bad or
specially cruel. the watchman loved him (ll. 34 f.), and the lamentations
of the elders over his death have a note of personal affection (pp. 66
ff.). but i suspect that aeschylus, a believer in the mystic meaning of
names, took the name agamemnon to be a warning that [greek: aga mimnei],
"the unseen wrath abides." _agâ_, of course, is not exactly wrath; it is

aeschylus employs none of the devices of later playwrights to make her
interesting. he admits, of course, no approach to a love-scene; he uses no
sophisms; but he does make us see through clytemnestra's eyes and feel
through her passions. the agony of silent prayer in which, if my
conception is right, we first see her, helps to interpret her speeches
when they come; but every speech needs close study. she dare not speak
sincerely or show her real feelings until agamemnon is dead; and then she
is practically a mad woman.

for i think here that there is a point which has not been observed. it is
that clytemnestra is conceived as being really "possessed" by the daemon
of the house when she commits her crime. her statements on p. 69 are not
empty metaphor. a careful study of the scene after the murder will show
that she appears first "possessed" and almost insane with triumph, utterly
dominating the elders and leaving them no power to answer. then gradually

emon, who lies at the root of so many greek gods and heroes, is
normally a story of pride and punishment. each year arrives, waxes great,
commits the sin of hubris and must therefore die. it is the way of all
life. as an early philosopher expresses it, "all things pay retribution
for their injustice one to another according to the ordinance of time."[1]

[footnote 1: see my _four stages of greek religion_, p. 47. cornford,
_from religion to philosophy_, chapter i. see also the fine pages on the
agamemnon in the same writer's _thucydides mythistoricus_, pp. 144, ff.
(e. arnold 1907). g. m.]

to me this consideration actually increases the interest and beauty of the
_oresteia_, because it increases its greatness. the majestic art, the
creative genius, the instinctive eloquence of these plays--that eloquence
which is the mere despair of a translator--are all devoted to the
expression of something which aeschylus felt to be of tremendous import.
it was not his discovery; but it was a truth of which

 he had an intense
realization. it had become something which he must with all his strength
bring to expression before he died, not in a spirit of self-assertion or
of argument, like a discoverer, but as one devoted to something higher and
greater than himself, in the spirit of an interpreter or prophet.

two thrones, two sceptres, yoked of god;
and a thousand galleys of argos trod
  the seas for the righting of wrong;
and wrath of battle about them cried,
    as vultures cry,
whose nest is plundered, and up they fly
in anguish lonely, eddying wide,
great wings like oars in the waste of sky,
their task gone from them, no more to keep
watch o'er the vulture babes asleep.

so the heart of him, again
aching with remembered pain,
bleeds and sleepeth not, until
wisdom comes against his will.
'tis the gift of one by strife

fleet lay at aulis._)

so that day the elder lord,
marshal of the achaian ships,
strove not with the prophet's word,
bowed him to his fate's eclipse,
when with empty jars and lips
parched and seas impassable
fate on that greek army fell,
fronting chalcis as it lay,

then "artemis" he whispered, he named the name;
and the brother kings they shook in the hearts of them,
and smote on the earth their staves, and the tears came.

but the king, the elder, hath found voice and spoken:
"a heavy doom, sure, if god's will were broken;
but to slay mine own child, who my house delighteth,
  is that not heavy? that her blood should flow
on her father's hand, hard beside an altar?
  my path is sorrow wheresoe'er i go.
shall agamemnon fail his ships and people,
  and the hosts of hellas melt as melts the snow?
they cry, they thirst, for a death that shall break the spell,
for a virgin's blood: 'tis a rite of old, men tell.
and they burn with longing.--o god may the end be well!"

(_but ambition drove him, till he consented to the sin of slaying his
daughter, iphigenia, as a sacrifice._)

  and a strange wind within his bosom tossed,
a wind of dark thought, unclean, unholy;

servant of aigisthos.

by hesiod as ouranos, kronos, zeus (cf. _prometheus_, 965 ff.), but we
cannot tell if aeschylus accepted the hesiodic story. cf. note on l. 246,
and clytemnestra's blasphemy at l. 1387, p. 63.

p. 9, l. 192, winds from strymon.]--from the great river gorge of
thrace, nne; cf. below, l. 1418.

p. 9, l. 201, artemis.]--her name was terrible, because of its
suggestion. she demanded the sacrifice of agamemnon's daughter, iphigenîa.
(see euripides' two plays, _iphigenia in tauris_ and _iphigenia in
aulis_.) in other poets agamemnon has generally committed some definite
sin against artemis, but in aeschylus the death of iphigenîa seems to be
merely one of the results of his acceptance of the sign.

p. 10, l. 215, 'tis a rite of old.]--literally "it is themis." human
sacrifice had had a place in the primitive religion of greece; hence
agamemnon could not reject the demand of the soldiers as an obviou

p. 11, l. 246, the third cup.]--regularly poured to zeus sôtêr, the
saviour, and accompanied by a paean or cry of joy.

p. 11, l. 256, this heart of argos, this frail tower:]--i.e. themselves.

p. 11, l. 264, glad-voiced.]--clytemnestra is in extreme suspense, as
the return of agamemnon will mean either her destruction or her
deliverance. at such a moment there must be no ill-omened word, so she
challenges fate.

p. 12, l. 276, a word within that hovereth without wings.]--i.e. a
presentiment. "winged words" are words spoken, which fly from speaker to
hearer. a 'wingless' word is unspoken. the phrase occurs in homer.

pp. 13 ff., ll. 281 ff.]--beacon speech. there is no need to inquire
curiously into the practical possibility of this chain of beacons. greek
tragedies do not car

e to be exact about this kind of detail. there may
well have been a tradition that agamemnon, like the great king of persia,
used a chain of beacons across the aegean.--note how vividly
clytemnestra's imagination is working in her excitement. she seems to see
before her every leaping light in the chain, just as in the next speech
she imagines the scene in troy almost with the intensity of a vision.

p. 14, l. 314, victory in the first as in the last.]--all are victory
beacons; the spirit of victory infects them all equally. cf. l. 854 below,
where agamemnon prays that the victory which

 is now with him, or in him,
may abide.

p. 15, l. 348, a woman's word.]--her hatred and fear of agamemnon, making
her feel vividly the horrors of the sack and the peril overhanging the
conquerors, have carried her dangerously far. she checks herself and
apologizes for her womanlike anxiety. cf. l. 1661, p. 77.

p. 18, ll. 409 ff., seers they saw visions.]--a difficult and uncertain
passage. i think the seers attached to the royal household
(cf. _libation-bearers,_ l. 37, where they are summoned to read a dream)
were rather like what we call clairvoyants. being consulted, they look
into some pool of

 liquid or the like; there they see gradually emerging
the palace, the injured king, the deserted room, and at last a wraith of
helen herself, haunting the place.

p. 21, l. 487.]--this break in the action, covering a space of several
days, was first pointed out by dr. walter headlam. incidentally it removes
the gravest of the difficulties raised by dr. verrall in his famous essay
upon the plot of the _agamemnon_.

p. 21, l. 495, dry dust, own brother to the mire of war.]--i.e. "i can see
by the state of his clothes, caked with dry dust which was once the mire
of battle, that he comes straight from the war and can speak with
knowledge." the herald is probably (though perhaps not quite consistently)
conceived as having rushed post-haste with his news.

pp. 22 ff., herald.]--the herald bursts in overcome with excitement and
delight, full of love for his home and everything he sees. a marked
contrast to a

gamemnon, ll. 810 ff. note that his first speech confirms all
the worst fears suggested by clytemnestra. agamemnon has committed all the
sins she prayed against, and more. the terrible lines 527 ff., "till her
gods' houses, etc.," are very like a passage in the _persae_, 811 ff.,
where exactly the same acts by the persian invaders of greece make their
future punishment inevitable.

p. 22, l. 509, pythian lord.]--apollo is often a sinister figure in
tragedy. cf. sophocles _oedipus_ , ll. 915 ff., pp. 52 ff., and the
similar scene, _electra_, 655 ff. here it is a shock to the herald to come

feels apollo an evil presence also in the cassandra scene, 11. 1071 ff.,
pp. 47 ff.

p. 23, l. 530, happy among men.]--the crown of his triumph! early greek
thought was always asking the question, what is human happiness? to the
herald agamemnon has achieved happiness if any one ever did. cf. the
well-known story of croesus asking solon who was the happiest man in the
world (herodotus, i. 30-33).

p. 24, ll. 551 ff., herald's second speech.]--the connexion of thought is:
"after all, why should either of us wish to die? all has ended well." this
vivid description of the actualities of war can be better appreciated now
than it could in 1913.

war were extant in gree

k temples in aeschylus' day and later.

p. 26, l. 595, our women's joy-cry.]--there seems to have been in argos an
old popular festival, celebrating with joy or mockery the supposed death
of a man and a woman. homer (od. iii. 309 f.) derives it from a rejoicing
by orestes over aigisthos and clytemnestra; cf. below, ll. 1316 ff., p.
59; aeschylus here and sophocles in the _electra_, from a celebration by
clytemnestra of the deaths of agamemnon and cassandra. probably it was
really some ordinary new year and old year celebration to which the poets
give a tragic touch. it seems to have had a woman's "ololugmos" in it,
perhaps uttered by men. see kaibel's note, soph. _electra_ 277-281.

p. 26, l. 612, bronze be dyed like wool.]--impossible in the literal
sense, but there is after all a way of dying a sword red!

p. 27, l. 617, menelaus.]--this digression about menelaus is due, as
similar digressions generally are when they occur in gree

k plays, to the
poet feeling bound to follow the tradition. homer begins his longest
account of the slaying of agamemnon by asking "where was menelaus?" (od.
iii. 249). agamemnon could be safely attacked because he was alone.
menelaus was away, wrecked or wind-bound.

p. 28, l. 642, two-fold scourge.]--ares works his will when spear crosses
spear, when man meets man. hence "two-fold."

p. 29, chorus. the name helena.]--there was a controversy in aeschylus'
day whether language, including names, was a matter of convention or of
nature. was it mere accident, and could you change the name of anything at
will? or was language a thing rooted in nature and fixed by god from o

he latter view: why was this being called helena?
if one had understood god's purpose one would have seen it was because she
really _was_ "helenâs"--_ship-destroyer_. (the herald's story of the
shipwreck has suggested this particular idea.) similarly, if a hero was
called aias, and came to great sorrow, one could see that he was so called
from 'aiai,' "alas!"--the antistrophe seems to find a meaning in the name
paris or alexandras, where the etymology is not so clear.

pp. 33 ff.]--entrance of agamemnon. the metre of the chorus indicates
marching; so that apparently the procession takes some time to move across
the orchestra and get into position. cassandra would be dressed, as a
prophetess, in a robe of white reaching to the feet, covered by an
_agrênon_, or net of wool with large meshes; she would have a staff and
certain fillets or crowns. the leader welcomes the king: he explains that,
though he was against the war ten years ago, and has not changed his
opinion, he is a faithful servant o

f the king ... and that not all are
equally so. he gave a similar hint to the herald above, ll. 546-550, p.
24.

p. 35, agamemnon.]--a hard, cold speech, full of pride in the earlier
part, and turning to ominous threats at the end. those who have dared to
be false shall be broken.--at the end comes a note of fear, like the fear
in shakespeare's julius caesar. he is so full of triumph and success; he
must be very careful not to provoke a fall.--victory, nike, was to the
greeks a very vivid and infectious thing. it clung to you or it deserted
you. and one who was really charged with victory, like agamemnon, was very
valuabl

e to his friends and people. hence they made statues of victory
wingless--so that she should not fly away. see _four stages of greek
religion_, p. 138 note.

p. 36, clytemnestra.]--a wonderful speech. it seems to me that aeschylus'
imagination realized all the confused passions in clytemnestra's mind, but
that his art was not yet sufficiently developed to make them all clear and
explicit. she is in suspense; does agamemnon know her guilt or not? at
least, if she is to die, she wants to say something to justify or excuse
herself in the eyes of the world. a touch of hysteria creeps in; why could
he not have been killed in all these years? why must he rise, like some
monster from the grave, unkillable? gradually she recovers her calm,
explains clearly the suspicious point of orestes' absence, and heaps up
her words and gestures of welcome to an almost oriental fullness (which
agamemnon rebukes, ll. 918 ff., p. 39).

again, at the end, when she finds
that for the time she is safe, her real feelings almost break out.

p. 38.]--what is the motive of the crimson tapestries? i think the
tangling robe must have been in the tradition, as the murder in the bath
certainly was. one motive, of course, is obvious: clytemnestra is tempting
agamemnon to sin or "go too far." he tries to resist, but the splendour of
an oriental homecoming seduces him and he yields. but is that enough to
account for such a curious trait in the story, and one so strongly
emphasized? we are told afterwards that clytemnestra threw over her victim
an "endless web," long and rich (p. 63), to prevent his seeing or using
his arms. and i cannot help suspecting that this endless web was the same
as the crimson pall.

en feet long, was in pre-classical and
post-classical times used as a sarcophagus, but in classical times chiefly
or solely as a bath. if among the prehistoric graves at mycenae some later
peasants discovered a royal mummy or skeleton in a sarcophagus, wrapped in
a robe of royal crimson, and showing signs of violent death--such as
schliemann believed that he discovered--would they not say: "we found the
body of a king murdered in a bath, and wrapped round and round in a great
robe?"

p. 39 f.]--agamemnon is going through the process of temptation. he
protests rather too often and yields.

p. 39, l. 931, tell me but this.]--this little dialogue is very
characteristic of aeschylus. euripides would have done it at three times
the length and made all the points clear. in aeschylus the subtlety is
there, but it is not easy to follow.

p. 40, l. 945, these bound slaves.]--i.e. his shoes. the metaphor shows

p. 42, l. 976.]--the victim has been drawn into the house; the chorus sing
a low boding song: every audience at a greek tragedy would expect next to
hear a death cry from within, or to see a horrified messenger rush out.
instead of which the door opens and there is clytemnestra: what does she
want? "come thou also!" one victim is not enough.--in the next scene we
must understand the cause of clytemnestra's impatience. if she stays too
long outside, some one will warn agamemnon; if she leaves cassandra, she
with her second sight will warn the chorus. if cassandra could only be got
inside all would be safe!

p. 44, l. 1022, "one there was of old."]--asklêpios, the physician,
restored hippolytus to life, and zeus blasted him for so oversetting the
laws of nature.

queen of lydia. his grumbles at his insufficient food were a theme of
comedy.

ls are divided. one would like to know whether aeschylus made them
speak together confusedly, as would certainly be done on the modern stage,
or whether the stately conventions of greek tragedy preferred that each
speaker should finish his say. in any case, what happens is that after a
moment or two of confused counsel the elders determine to break into the
palace, but as they are mounting the steps the great doors are flung open
and clytemnestra confronts them, standing over the dead bodies of
agamemnon and cassandra.

the illusion intended is that the elders have entered the palace and
discovered clytemnestra. but, as the mechanical arrangements of the greek
stage were not equal to this sudden change of scene, and since also it
would, even with perfect machinery, have a tiresome interrupting effect, a
slight confusion or inconsistency is allowed. we are supposed to be inside
the house; but as a matter of fact the supposition is soon forgotten, and
the play goes on without any attention to the

p. 63, l. 1387, a prayer well sped to zeus of hell]--as the third gift or
libation was ritually given to zeus the saviour, clytemnestra
blasphemously suggests that her third and unnecessary blow was an
acceptable gift to a sort of anti-zeus, a saviour of death.

p. 65, l. 1436, aigisthos.]--at last the name is mentioned which has been
in the mind of every one!--chrysêïs was a prisoner of war, daughter of
chrysês, priest of apollo. agamemnon was made to surrender her to her
father, and from this arose his quarrel with achilles, which is the
subject of the iliad.
