r’s great moment was over as precipitately
as it had begun.
across from him the dane and his companions had ordered
luncheon. abe did likewise but scarcely touched it.
afterwards, he just sat, happy to live in the past. the drink
made past happy things contemporary with the present, as
if they were still going on, contemporary even with the future
as if they were about to happen again.

at four the chasseur approached him:
‘you wish to see a colored fellow of the name jules peterson?’
‘god! how did he find me?’
‘i didn’t tell him you were present.’
‘who did?’ abe fell over his glasses but recovered himself.
‘says he’s already been around to all the american bars
and hotels.’
‘tell him i’m not here—‘ as the chasseur turned away
abe asked: ‘can he come in here?’
‘i’ll find out.’
receiving the question paul glanced over his shoulder;
he shook his head, then seeing abe he came over.
‘i’m sorry; i can’t allow it.’
abe got himself

but the most fleeting judgments on matters not pertinent to
themselves. standing there was abe, aged by several months
in the last twentyfour hours, and a very frightened, concerned
colored man whom abe introduced as mr. peterson
of stockholm.

‘he’s in a terrible situation and it’s my fault,’ said abe. ‘we
need some good advice.’
‘come in our rooms,’ said dick.
abe insisted that rosemary come too and they crossed
the hall to the divers’ suite. jules peterson, a small, respectable
negro, on the suave model that heels the republican
party in the border states, followed.
it appeared that the latter had been a legal witness to the
early morning dispute in montparnasse; he had accompanied
abe to the police station and supported his assertion
that a thousand franc note had been seized out of his hand
by a negro, whose identification was one of the points of the
case. abe and jules peterson, accompanied by an agent of
police, returned to the bistro and to

entangling himself with the personal lives, consciences, and
emotions of one afro-european and three afro-americans

pected places and around unexpected corners, and insistent
negro voices on the phone.
in person, abe had succeeded in evading all of them, save
jules peterson. peterson was rather in the position of the
friendly indian who had helped a white. the negroes who
suffered from the betrayal were not so much after abe as
after peterson, and peterson was very much after what protection
he might get from abe.
up in stockholm peterson had failed as a small manufacturer
of shoe polish and now possessed only his formula
and sufficient trade tools to fill a small box; however, his new
protector had promised in the early hours to set him up in
business in versaill

and in another minute
he was joined by a gendarme. in the interval he found
time to whisper to dick, ‘you can be sure the name of any
guest will be protected. i’m only too grateful to you for your

pains.’
mr. mcbeth took an immediate step that may only be
imagined, but that influenced the gendarme so as to make
him pull his mustaches in a frenzy of uneasiness and greed.
he made perfunctory notes and sent a telephone call to his
post. meanwhile with a celerity that jules peterson, as a
business man, would have quite understood, the remains
were carried into another apartment of one of the most
fashionable hotels in the world.
dick went back to his salon.
‘what hap-pened?’ cried rosemary. ‘do all the americans
in paris just shoot at each other all the time?’
‘this seems to be the open season,’ he answered. ‘where’s
nicole?’
‘i think she’s in the bathroom.’
