id babbitt enter, and to the group standing by the cigar-counter he
whooped, "how's the boys? how's the boys? well, well, fine day!"

jovially they whooped back--vergil gunch, the coal-dealer, sidney
finkelstein, the ladies'-ready-to-wear buyer for parcher & stein's
department-store, and professor joseph k. pumphrey, owner of the riteway
business college and instructor in public speaking, business english,
scenario writing, and commercial law. though babbitt admired this
savant, and appreciated sidney finkelstein as "a mighty smart buyer
and a good liberal spender," it was to vergil gunch that he turned with
enthusiasm. mr. gunch was president of the boosters' club, a weekly
lunch-club, local chapter of a national organization which promoted
sound business and friendliness among regular fellows. he was also no
less an official than esteemed leading knight in the benevolent and
protective order of elks, and it was rumored that at the next election
he would be a candidate for exalted ruler. he was a jolly

the lovely mrs. mckelvey never was more fascinating than last evening
in her black net gown relieved by dainty bands of silver and at her
exquisite waist a glowing cluster of aaron ward roses.


babbitt said bravely, "i hope they don't invite us to meet this lord
doak guy. darn sight rather just have a nice quiet little dinner with
charley and the missus."

at the zenith athletic club they discussed it amply. "i s'pose we'll
have to call mckelvey 'lord chaz' from now on," said sidney finkelstein.

"it beats all get-out," meditated that man of data, howard littlefield,
"how hard it is for some people to get things straight. here they call
this fellow 'lord doak' when it ought to be 'sir gerald.'"

babbitt marvelled, "is that a fact! well, well! 'sir gerald,' eh? that's
what you call um, eh? well, sir, i'm glad to know that."

later he informed his salesmen, "it's funnier 'n a goat the way

 morning, that he was a conscious rebel, but he
was irritable in the office and at the eleven o'clock drive of telephone
calls and visitors he did something he had often desired and never
dared: he left the office without excuses to those stave-drivers his
employees, and went to the movies. he enjoyed the right to be alone. he
came out with a vicious determination to do what he pleased.

as he approached the roughnecks' table at the club, everybody laughed.

"well, here's the millionaire!" said sidney finkelstein.

"yes, i saw him in his locomobile!" said professor pumphrey.

"gosh, it must be great to be a smart guy like georgie!" moaned vergil
gunch. "he's probably stolen all of dorchester. i'd hate to leave a poor
little defenseless piece of property lying around where he could get his
hooks on it!"

they had, babbitt perceived, "something on him." also, they "had their
kidding clothes on." ordinarily he would have been delighted at the
honor implied in being chaffed, but he was suddenly touchy. he g

"yuh, sure; maybe i'll take you guys on as office boys!" he was
impatient as the jest elaborately rolled on to its denouement.

"of course he may have been meeting a girl," they said, and "no, i think
he was waiting for his old roommate, sir jerusalem doak."

he exploded, "oh, spring it, spring it, you boneheads! what's the great
joke?"

"hurray! george is peeved!" snickered sidney finkelstein, while a grin
went round the table. gunch revealed the shocking truth: he had seen
babbitt coming out of a motion-picture theater--at noon!

they kept it up. with a hundred variations, a hundred guffaws, they said
that he had gone to the movies during business-hours. he didn't so much
mind gunch, but he was annoyed by sidney finkelstein, that brisk, lean,
red-headed explainer of jokes. he was bothered, too, by the lump of ice
in his glass of water. it was too large; it spun round and burned his

much. my name's tanis judique."

"i think maybe i've got just the thing for you. would you like to chase
around and look at it now?"

"yes. i have a couple of hours."

in the new cavendish apartments, babbitt had a flat which he had been
holding for sidney finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside
this agreeable woman he threw over his friend finkelstein, and with a
note of gallantry he proclaimed, "i'll let you see what i can do!"

he dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in
showing off his driving.

"you do know how to handle a car!" she said.

he liked her voice. there was, he thought, music in it and a hint of
culture, not a bouncing giggle like louetta swanson's.

he boasted, "you know, there's a lot of these fellows that

rs'. he was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and
sounding occupation. he was an intense large man with a boiling of black
hair and a thick black mustache. the newspapers often chronicled his
operations; he was professor of surgery in the state university; he went
to dinner at the very best houses on royal ridge; and he was said to be
worth several hundred thousand dollars. it was dismaying to babbitt to
have such a person glower at him. he hastily praised the congressman's
wit, to sidney finkelstein, but for dr. dilling's benefit.

that afternoon three men shouldered into babbitt's office with the air
of a vigilante committee in frontier days. they were large, resolute,
big-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of zenith--dr.
dilling the surgeon, charles mckelvey the contractor, and, most
dismaying of all, the white-bearded colonel rutherford snow, owner of
the advocate-times. in their whelming presence babbitt felt small and
insignificant.

ad doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the good
fellows, he was convinced now. you didn't, he noted, "see seneca doane
coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the missus,"
but mrs. howard littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine
jelly (flavored with real wine); orville jones spent hours in picking
out the kind of novels mrs. babbitt liked--nice love stories about new
york millionaries and wyoming cowpunchers; louetta swanson knitted a
pink bed-jacket; sidney finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of
a wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of parcher and
stein.

all his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. at the
athletic club they asked after her daily. club members whose names he
did not know stopped him to inquire, "how's your good lady getting on?"
babbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich
warm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.

one hundred per cent. american way of settling labor-troubles was for
workmen to trust and love their employers.

the league was more than generous in approving other organizations
which agreed with its aims. it helped the y.m. c.a. to raise a
two-hundred-thousand-dollar fund for a new building. babbitt, vergil
gunch, sidney finkelstein, and even charles mckelvey told the spectators
at movie theaters how great an influence for manly christianity the
"good old y." had been in their own lives; and the hoar and mighty
colonel rutherford snow, owner of the advocate-times, was photographed
clasping the hand of sheldon smeeth of the y.m.c.a. it is true
that afterward, when smeeth lisped, "you must come to one of our
prayer-meetings," the ferocious colonel bellowed, "what the hell would
i do that for? i've got a bar of my own," but t
