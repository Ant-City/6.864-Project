Prince Hal (later King Henry V)  - 
      Only called "Hal" by Falstaff and his friends, the prince is also called Prince Henry, Harry, Prince Harry, Harry Monmouth, the Prince of Wales, and, after his father's death, King Henry V. He is the play's main protagonist. His transformation from a youthful hell-raiser into the dignified King Henry V is one of the major psychological developments of the play.
