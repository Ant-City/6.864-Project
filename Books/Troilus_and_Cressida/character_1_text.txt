                        prologue

    in troy, there lies the scene. from isles of greece
    the princes orgillous, their high blood chaf'd,
    have to the port of athens sent their ships
    fraught with the ministers and instruments
    of cruel war. sixty and nine that wore
    their crownets regal from th' athenian bay
    put forth toward phrygia; and their vow is made
    to ransack troy, within whose strong immures
    the ravish'd helen, menelaus' queen,
    with wanton pa

  troilus. by whom, aeneas?
  aeneas. troilus, by menelaus.
  troilus. let paris bleed: 'tis but a scar to scorn;
    paris is gor'd with menelaus' horn.
[alarum]
  aeneas. hark what good sport is out of town to-day!
  troilus. better at home, if 'would i might' were 'may.'
    but to the sport abroad. are you bound thither?
  aeneas. in all swift haste.
  troilus. come, go we then together.

troy. a street

enter cressida and her man alexander

  cressida. who were those went by?
  alexander. queen hecuba and helen.
  cressida. and whither go they?
  alexander. up to the eastern tower,
    whose height commands as subject all the vale,
    to see the battle. hector, whose patience
    is as a virtue fix'd, to-day was mov'd.
    he chid andromache, and struck his armourer;
    and, like as there were husbandry in war,
    before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
    and to the field goes he; where

every flower
    did as a prophet weep what it foresaw
    in hector's wrath.
  cressida. what was his cause of anger?
  alexander. the noise goes, this: there is among the greeks
    a lord of troyan blood, nephew to hector;
    they call him ajax.
  cressida. good; and what of him?
  alexander. they say he is a very man per se,
    and stands alone.
  cressida. so do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no
    legs.
  alexander. this man, lady, hath robb'd many beasts of their
    particular additions: he is as valiant as a lion, churlish as the
    bear, slow as the elephant-a man into whom nature hath so crowded
    humours that his valour is crush'd into folly, his folly sauced
    with discretion. there is no man hath a virtue that he hath not a
    glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he carries some stain of
    it; he is mel

ancholy without cause and merry against the hair; he
    hath the joints of every thing; but everything so out of joint
    that he is a gouty briareus, many hands and no use, or purblind
    argus, all eyes and no sight.
  cressida. but how should this man, that makes me smile, make hector
      angry?
  alexander. they say he yesterday cop'd hector in the battle and
    struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath ever since
    kept hector fasting and waking.

                          enter pandarus

  cressida. who comes here?
  alexander. madam, your uncle pandarus.
  cressida. hector's a gallant man.
  alexander. as may be in the world, lady.
  pandarus. what's that? what's that?
  cressida. good

 morrow, uncle pandarus.
  pandarus. good morrow, cousin cressid. what do you talk of?- good
    morrow, alexander.-how do you, cousin? when were you at ilium?
  cressida. this morning, uncle.
  pandarus. what were you talking of when i came? was hector arm'd
    and gone ere you came to ilium? helen was not up, was she?
  cressida. hector was gone; but helen was not up.
  pandarus. e'en so. hector was stirring early.
  cressida. that were we talking of, and of his anger.
  pandarus. was he angry?
  cressida. so he says here.
  pandarus. true, he was so; i know the cause too; he'll lay about
    him today, i can tell them that. and there's troilus will not
    come far behind him; let them take heed of troilus, i can tell
    them that too.
  cressida. what, is he angry too?
  pandarus. who, troilus? troilus is the better man of the two.
  cressida. o jupiter! there's no comparison.
  pandarus. what, not betw

een troilus and hector? do you know a man
    if you see him?
  cressida. ay, if i ever saw him before and knew him.
  pandarus. well, i say troilus is troilus.
  cressida. then you say as i say, for i am sure he is not hector.
  pandarus. no, nor hector is not troilus in some degrees.
  cressida. 'tis just to each of them: he is himself.
  pandarus. himself! alas, poor troilus! i would he were!
  cressida. so he is.
  pandarus. condition i had gone barefoot to india.
  cressida. he is not hector.
  pandarus. himself! no, he's not himself. would 'a were himself!
    well, the gods are above; time must friend or end. well, troilus,
    well! i would my heart were in her body! no, hector is not a
    better man than troilus.
  cressida. excuse me.
  pandarus. he is elder.
  cressida. pardon me, pardon me.
  pandarus. th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another tale
    when th' other's come to't. hector shall not have his wit this
    year.

  pandarus. nor his qualities.
  cressida. no matter.
  pandarus. nor his beauty.
  cressida. 'twould not become him: his own's better.
  pandarus. you have no judgment, niece. helen herself swore th'
    other day that troilus, for a brown favour, for so 'tis, i must
    confess- not brown neither-
  cressida. no, but brown.
  pandarus. faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
  cressida. to say the truth, true and not true.
  pandarus. she prais'd his complexion above paris.
  cressida. why, paris hath colour enough.
  pandarus. so he has.
  cressida. then troilus should have too much. if she prais'd him
    above, his complexion is higher than his; he having colour
    enough, and the other higher, is too flaming praise for a good
    complexion. i had as lief helen's golden tongue had commended
    troilus for a copper nose.
  pandarus. i swear to you i think helen

loves him better than paris.
  cressida. then she's a merry greek indeed.
  pandarus. nay, i am sure she does. she came to him th' other day
    into the compass'd window-and you know he has not past three or
    four hairs on his chin-
  cressida. indeed a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
    particulars therein to a total.
  pandarus. why, he is very young, and yet will he within three pound
    lift as much as his brother hector.
  cressida. is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
  pandarus. but to prove to you that helen loves him: she came and
    puts me her white hand to his cloven chin-
  cressida. juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
  pandarus. why, you know, 'tis dimpled. i think his smiling becomes
    him better than any man in all phrygia.
  cressida. o, he smiles valiantly!
  pandarus. does he not?
  cressida. o yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn!
  pandarus. why, go to, then! but to prove to you that helen l

    troilus-
  cressida. troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll prove it so.
  pandarus. troilus! why, he esteems her no more than i esteem an
    addle egg.
  cressida. if you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
    head, you would eat chickens i' th' shell.
  pandarus. i cannot choose but laugh to think how she tickled his
    chin. indeed, she has a marvell's white hand, i must needs
    confess.
  cressida. without the rack.
  pandarus. and she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
  cressida. alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
  pandarus. but there was such laughing! queen hecuba laugh'd that
    her eyes ran o'er.
  cressida. with millstones.
  pandarus. and cassandra laugh'd.
  cressida. but there was a more temperate fire under the pot of her
    eyes. did her eyes run o'er too?
  pandarus. and hector laugh'd.
  cressida. at what was all this laughing?
  pandarus. ma

rry, at the white hair that helen spied on troilus'
    chin.
  cressida. an't had been a green hair i should have laugh'd too.
  pandarus. they laugh'd not so much at the hair as at his pretty
    answer.
  cressida. what was his answer?
  pandarus. quoth she 'here's but two and fifty hairs on your chin,
    and one of them is white.'
  cressida. this is her question.
  pandarus. that's true; make no question of that. 'two and fifty
    hairs,' quoth he 'and one white. that white hair is my father,
    and all the rest are his sons.' 'jupiter!' quoth she 'which of
    these hairs is paris my husband?' 'the forked one,' quoth he,
    'pluck't out and give it him.' but there was such laughing! and
    helen so blush'd, and paris so chaf'd; and all the rest so
    laugh'd that it pass'd.
  cressida. so let it now; for it has been

  pandarus. well, cousin, i told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
  cressida. so i do.
  pandarus. i'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, and 'twere a
    man born in april.
  cressida. and i'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
    against may.                                    [sound a retreat]
  pandarus. hark! they are coming from the field. shall we stand up
    here and see them as they pass toward ilium? good niece, do,
    sweet niece cressida.
  cressida. at your pleasure.
  pandarus. here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may see
    most bravely. i'll tell you them all by their names as they pass
    by; but mark troilus above the rest.

                       aeneas passes

  cressida. speak not so loud.

    flowers of troy, i can tell you. but mark troilus; you shall see
    anon.

  pandarus. that's antenor. he has a shrewd wit, i can tell you; and
    he's a man good enough; he's one o' th' soundest judgments in
    troy, whosoever, and a proper man of person. when comes troilus?
    i'll show you troilus anon. if he see me, you shall see him nod
    at me.
  cressida. will he give you the nod?
  pandarus. you shall see.
  cressida. if he do, the rich shall have more.

    fellow! go thy way, hector! there's a brave man, niece. o brave
    hector! look how he looks. there's a countenance! is't not a
    brave man?
  cressida. o, a brave man!
  pandarus. is 'a not? it does a man's heart good. look you what

    it's all one. by god's lid, it does one's heart good. yonder
    comes paris, yonder comes paris.

                       paris passes

    look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too, is't not? why,
    this is brave now. who said he came hurt home to-day? he's not
    hurt. why, this will do helen's heart good now, ha! would i could

    helenus. i think he went not forth to-day. that's helenus.
  cressida. can helenus fight, uncle?
  pandarus. helenus! no. yes, he'll fight indifferent well. i marvel
    where troilus is. hark! do you not hear the people cry 'troilus'?
    helenus is a priest.

    crows and daws! i had rather be such a man as troilus than
    agamemnon and all greece.
  cressida. there is amongst the greeks achilles, a better man than
    troilus.
  pandarus. achilles? a drayman, a porter, a very camel!

  cressida. well, well.
  pandarus. well, well! why, have you any discretion? have you any
    eyes? do you know what a man is? is not birth, beauty, good
    shape, discourse, manhood, learning, gentleness, virtue, youth,
    liberality, and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
  cressida. ay, a minc'd man; and then to be bak'd with no date in
    the pie, for then the man's date is out.
  pandarus. you are such a woman! a man knows not at what ward you
    lie.
  cressida. upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to defend
    my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine honesty; my mask, to
    defend my beauty; and you, to defend all these; and at all these
    wards i lie at, at a thousand watches.
  pandarus. say one of your watches.
  cressida. nay, i'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
    chiefest of them too. if i cannot ward what i would not have hit,
    i can watch you for telling how i took the blow; unless it swell

  diomedes. what, are you up here, ho? speak.
  calchas. [within] who calls?
  diomedes. diomed. calchas, i think. where's your daughter?
  calchas. [within] she comes to you.

      enter troilus and ulysses, at a distance; after them
                        thersites

[whispers]
  troilus. yea, so familiar!
  ulysses. she will sing any man at first sight.
  thersites. and any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
    she's noted.
  diomedes. will you remember?
  cressida. remember? yes.
  diomedes. nay, but do, then;
    and let your mind be coupled with your words.
  troilus. what shall she remember?

  cressida. sweet honey greek, tempt me no more to folly.
  thersites. roguery!
  diomedes. nay, then-
  cressida. i'll tell you what-
  diomedes. fo, fo! come, tell a pin; you are a forsworn-
  cressida. in faith, i cannot. what would you have me do?
  thersites. a juggling trick, to be secretly open.
  diomedes. what did you swear you would bestow on me?
  cressida. i prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
    bid me do anything but that, sweet greek.
  diomedes. good night.

    the time right deadly; i beseech you, go.
  troilus. behold, i pray you.
  ulysses. nay, good my lord, go off;
    you flow to great distraction; come, my lord.
  troilus. i prithee stay.
  ulysses. you have not patience; come.
  troilus. i pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments,
    i will not speak a word.
  diomedes. and so, good night.
  cressida. nay, but you part in anger.
  troilus. doth that grieve thee? o withered truth!
  ulysses. how now, my lord?
  troilus. by jove, i will be patient.
  cressida. guardian! why, greek!
  diomedes. fo, fo! adieu! you palter.
  cressida. in faith, i do not. come hither once again.
  ulysses. you shake, my lord, at something; will you go?

  ulysses. come, come.
  troilus. nay, stay; by jove, i will not speak a word:

  thersites. how the devil luxury, with his fat rump and potato
    finger, tickles these together! fry, lechery, fry!
  diomedes. but will you, then?
  cressida. in faith, i will, lo; never trust me else.
  diomedes. give me some token for the surety of it.
  cressida. i'll fetch you one.
exit
  ulysses. you have sworn patience.
  troilus. fear me not, my lord;
    i will not be myself, nor have cognition
    of what i feel. i am all patience.

  diomedes. whose was't?
  cressida. it is no matter, now i ha't again.
    i will not meet with you to-morrow night.
    i prithee, diomed, visit me no more.
  thersites. now she sharpens. well said, whetstone.
  diomedes. i shall have it.
  cressida. what, this?
  diomedes. ay, that.
  cressida. o all you gods! o pretty, pretty pledge!
    thy master now lies thinking on his bed
    of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
    and gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
    as i kiss thee. nay, do not snatch it from me;
    he that takes that doth take my heart withal.
  diomedes. i had your heart before; this follows it.
  troilus. i did swear patience.
  cressida. you shall not have it, diomed; faith, you shall not;
    i'll give you something else.

ve this. whose was it?
  cressida. it is no matter.
  diomedes. come, tell me whose it was.
  cressida. 'twas one's that lov'd me better than you will.
    but, now you have it, take it.
  diomedes. whose was it?
  cressida. by all diana's waiting women yond,
    and by herself, i will not tell you whose.
  diomedes. to-morrow will i wear it on my helm,
    and grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
  troilus. wert thou the devil and wor'st it on thy horn,
    it should be challeng'd.
  cressida. well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past; and yet it is not;
    i will not keep my word.
  diomedes. why, then farewell;
    thou never shalt mock diomed again.
  cressida. you shall not go. one cannot speak a

  diomedes. i do not like this fooling.
  thersites. nor i, by pluto; but that that likes not you
    pleases me best.
  diomedes. what, shall i come? the hour-
  cressida. ay, come-o jove! do come. i shall be plagu'd.
  diomedes. farewell till then.
  cressida. good night. i prithee come.     exit diomedes
    troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee;
    but with my heart the other eye doth see.
    ah, poor our sex! this fault in us i find,
    the error of our eye directs our mind.
    what error leads must err; o, then conclude,
    minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.

 cressid was here but now.
  troilus. let it not be believ'd for womanhood.
    think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
    to stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
    for depravation, to square the general sex
    by cressid's rule. rather think this not cressid.
  ulysses. what hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
  troilus. nothing at all, unless that this were she.
  thersites. will 'a swagger himself out on's own eyes?
  troilus. this she? no; this is diomed's cressida.
    if beauty have a soul, this is not she;
    if souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
    if sanctimony be the god's delight,
    if there be rule in unity itself,
    this was not she. o madness of discourse,
    that cause sets up with and against itself!
    bifold authority! where reason can revolt
    without perdition, and loss assume all reason
    without revolt: this is, and is not, cressid.
    within my soul there doth conduce a fight
    of this strange nature, t
