Captain Fluellen, Captain MacMorris, and
Captain Jamy - 
                 The captains of King
Henry's troops from Wales, Ireland, and Scotland, respectively,
all of whom have heavy accents reflecting their countries of origin. Fluellen,
a close friend of Captain Gower, is the most prominent of the three.
His wordiness provides comic relief, but he is also very likable
and is an intelligent leader and strategist.
