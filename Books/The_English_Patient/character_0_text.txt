modest.  â€œ/  should  like  to  add  a  few  remarks  on  some  of  the  points  raised  in  the  interesting  discussion  on  the  â€˜prehistoric

companions. 

in 1939 the great decade of libyan desert expeditions came to an end, and this vast and silent pocket of the earth became 

one of the theatres of war.

book of hidden treasures, the kitab al kanuz, zerzura is depicted as a white city, â€œwhite as a dove.â€

we were a small clutch of a nation between the wars, mapping and re-exploring. we gathered at dakhla and kufra as if they 
were bars or cafes. an oasis society, bagnold called it. we knew each otherâ€™s intimacies, each otherâ€™s skills and weaknesses.

in 1936 a young man named geoffrey clifton had met a friend at oxford who mentioned what we were doing. he contacted 

me, got married the next day, and two weeks later flew with his wife to cairo. 

the couple entered our worldâ€”the four of us, prince kemal el din, bell, almasy and madox. the name that still filled our 
mouths  was  gilf  kebir.  somewhere  in  the  gilf  nestled  zerzura,  whose  name  occurs  in  arab  writings  as  far  back  as  the 
thirteenth century. when you travel that far in time you need a plane, and young clifton was rich and he could fly and he had a 
plane. 

clifton met us in el jof, north of uweinat. he sat in his two-seater plane and we walked towards him from the base camp.

let me tell you a story,â€ caravaggio says to hana. â€œthere was a hungarian named almasy, who worked for the germans 
during the war. he flew a bit with the afrika korps, but he was more valuable than that. in the 19305 he had been one of the 
great desert explorers. he knew every water hole and had helped map the sand sea. he knew all about the desert. he knew all 
about dialects. does this sound familiar? between the two wars he was always on expeditions out of cairo. one was to search 
for zerzuraâ€”the lost oasis. then when war broke out he joined the germans. in 1941 he became

â€œso?â€ 
â€œ â€˜ciceroâ€™ was a code name for a spy. the british unearthed him. a double then triple agent. he got away. â€˜zerzuraâ€™ is more 

complicated.â€ 

â€œi know about zerzura. heâ€™s talked about it. he also talks about gardens.â€ 
â€œbut it is mostly the desert now. the english garden is wearing thin. heâ€™s dying. i think you have the spy-helper almasy

side reading with british intelligence. even i read it.â€ 

â€œyou read a book?â€ 
â€œthank you. the man who guided eppler through the desert into cairo on rommelâ€™s personal ordersâ€”from tripoli all the 

way to cairoâ€”was count ladislaus de almasy. this was a stretch of desert that, it was assumed, no one could cross. 

â€œbetween  the  wars  almasy  had  english  friends.  great  explorers.  but  when  war  broke  out  he  went  with  the  germans. 
rommel asked him to take eppler across the desert into cairo because it would have been too obvious by plane or parachute.

man,  burned  beyond  recognition,  who  somehow  ends  up  in  the  arms  of  the  english  at  pisa.  also,  he  can  get  away  with

farewell. she and her husband were there. one last night. one last dance. almasy was drunk and attempting an old dance step 
he had invented called the bosphorus hug, lifting katharine clifton into his wiry arms and traversing the floor until he fell with 
her across some nile-grown aspidistras.

little metal droplets warm from the barâ€™s heat that almasy in the past had always been partial towards, women who in their 
dancing swung the jagged earrings of silver against his face. on other nights he danced with them, carrying their whole frame

frame of light, hunched over a chair beside almasyâ€™s bed. one of the two older men in this story. 

â€œi can talk with you, caravaggio, because i feel we are both mortal. the girl, the boy, they are not mortal yet. in spite of
