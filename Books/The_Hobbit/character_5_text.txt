he floor and a nasty smell 
was in the air; but there was a good deal of food jumbled carelessly on shelves and on 
the ground, among an untidy litter of plunder, of all sorts from brass buttons to pots full of 
gold coins standing in a corner. there were lots of clothes, too, hanging on the walls-too 
small for trolls, i am afraid they belonged to victims-and among them were several 
swords of various makes, shapes, and sizes. two caught their eyes particularly, 
because of their beautiful scabbards and jewelled hilts. gandalf and thorin each took 
one of these; and bilbo took a knife in a leather sheath. 
it would have made only a tiny pocket-knife for a troll, but it was as good as a short 
sword for the hobbit. 

"these look like good blades," said the wizard, half drawing them and looking at them 
curiously. "they were not made by any troll, nor by any smith among men in these parts 
and days; but when we can read the runes on them, we shall know more about them."

at the twanging of the bows and the shrilling of the trumpets the dragon's wrath blazed 
to its height, till he was blind and mad with it. no one had dared to give battle to him for 
many an age; nor would they have dared now, if it had not been for the grim-voiced man 
(bard was his name), who ran to and fro cheering on the archers and urging the master 
to order them to fight to the last arrow. 
fire leaped from the dragon's jaws. he circled for a while high in the air above them 
lighting all the lake; the trees by the shores shone like copper and like blood with leaping 
shadows of dense black at their feet. then down he swooped straight through the arrow-

was the dragon's hope. they could all get into boats for all he cared. there he could 
have fine sport hunting them, or they could stop till they starved. let them try to get to 
land and he would be ready. soon he would set all the shoreland woods ablaze and 
wither every field and pasture. just now he was enjoying the sport of town-baiting more 
than he had enjoyed anything for years. but there was still a company of archers that 
held their ground among the burning houses. 
their captain was bard, grim-voiced and grim-faced, whose friends had accused him of 
prophesying floods and poisoned fish, though they knew his worth and courage. he was 
a descendant in long line of girion, lord of dale, whose wife and child had escaped 
down the running river from the ruin long ago. now he shot with a great yew bow, till all 
his arrows but one were spent. the flames were near him. his companions were leaving 
him. he bent his bow for the last time. suddenly out of the dark something fluttered to

his shoulder. he started-but it was only an old thrush. unafraid it perched by his ear and 
it brought him news. marvelling he found he could understand its tongue, for he was of 
the race of dale. 
"wait! wait!" it said to him. "the moon is rising. look for the hollow of the left breast as 
he flies and turns above you!" and while bard paused in wonder it told him of tidings up 
in the mountain and of all that it had heard. 
then bard drew his bow-string to his ear. the dragon was circling back, flying low, and 
as he came the moon rose above the eastern shore and silvered his great wings. 
"arrow!" said the bowman. "black arrow! i have saved you to the last. you have never 
failed me and always i have recovered you. i had you from my father and he from of old. 
if ever you came from the forges of the true king under the mountain, go now and speed 
well!" 
the dragon swooped once more lower than ever, and as he turned and di

full on the town he fell. his last throes splintered it to sparks and gledes. the lake 
roared in. a vast steam leaped up, white in the sudden dark under the moon. there was 
a hiss, a gushing whirl, and then silence. and that was the end of smaug and esgaroth, 
but not of bard. the waxing moon rose higher and higher and the wind grew loud and 
cold. it twisted the white fog into bending pillars and hurrying clouds and drove it off to 
the west to scatter in tattered shreds over the marshes before mirkwood. then the many 
boats could be seen dotted dark on the surface of the lake, and down the wind came the 
voices of the people of esgaroth lamenting their lost town and goods and ruined houses. 
but they had really much to be thankful for, had they thought of it, thou

boats remained undamaged; and the dragon was dead. what that meant they had not 
yet realized. 
they gathered in mournful crowds upon the western shores, shivering in the cold wind, 
and their first complaints and anger were against the master, who had left the town so 
soon, while some were still willing to defend it. 
"he may have a good head for business-especially his own business," some murmured, 
"but he is no good when anything serious happens!" and they praised the courage of 

bard and his last mighty shot. "if only he had not been killed," they all said, "we would 
make him a king. bard the dragon-shooter of the line of girion! alas that he is lost!" 
and in the very midst of their talk, a tall figure stepped from the shadows. he was 
drenched with water, his black hair hung wet over his face and shoulders, and a fierce 
light was in his eyes. 
"bard is not lost!" he cried. "he dived from esgaroth, when the enemy was slain. i am 
bard, of the line of girion; i am the sla

yer of the dragon!" 
"king bard! king bard!" they shouted; but the master ground his chattering teeth. 
"girion was lord of dale, not king of esgaroth," he said. "in the laketown we have 
always elected masters from among the old and wise, and have not endured the rule of 
mere fighting men. let 'king bard' go back to his own kingdom-dale is now freed by his 
valour, and nothing binders his return. and any that wish can go with him, if they prefer 
the cold shores under the shadow of the mountain to the green shores of the lake. the 
wise will stay here and hope to rebuild our town, and enjoy again in time its peace and 
riches." 
"we will have king bard!" the people near at hand shouted in reply. "we have had 
enough of the old men and the money-counters!" and people further off took up the cry:
 
 ___________________________
 
 
"up the bowman, and down with moneybags," till the clamour echoed along the shore. 
"i am the last man to undervalue bard the bowman," said the master warily (for bard 
now stood close beside him). "he has tonight earned an eminent place in the roll of the 
benefactors of our town; and he is worthy of many imperishable songs. but, why o 
people?"-and here the master rose to his feet and spoke very loud and clear - "why do i 
get all your blame? for what fault am i to be deposed? who aroused the dragon from 
his slumber, i might ask? who obtained of us rich gifts and ample help, and led us to 
believe that old songs could come true? who played on our soft hear

e, and aid for our widows 
and orphans?" 
as you see, the master had not got his position for nothing. the result of his words was 
that for the moment the people quite forgot their idea of a new king, and turned their 
angry thoughts towards thorin and his company. wild and bitter words were shouted 
from many sides; and some of those who had before sung the old songs loudest, were 
now heard as loudly crying that the dwarves had stirred the dragon up against them 
deliberately! 
"fools!" said bard. "why waste words and wrath on those unhappy creatures? 
doubtless they perished first in fire, before smaug came to us." 
then even as he was speaking, the thought came into his heart of the fabled treasure of 
the mountain lying without guard or owner, and he fell suddenly silent. he thought of the 
master's words, and of dale rebuilt, and filled with golden bells, if he could but find the 
men. 
at length he spoke again: "this is no time for angry words. master, or for considering 
weighty p

lans of change. there is work to do. i serve you still-though after a while i may 
think again of your words and go north with any that will follow me." 
then he strode off to help in the ordering of the camps and in the care of the sick and 
the wounded. but the master scowled at his back as he went, and remained sitting on 
the ground. he thought much but said little, unless it was to call loudly for men to bring 
him fire and food. now everywhere bard went he found talk running like fire among the 
people concerning the vast treasure that was now unguarded. men spoke of the 
recompense for all their harm that they would soon get from it, and wealth over and to 
spare with which to buy rich things from the south; and it cheered them greatly in their 

plight. that was as well, for the night was bitter and miserable. shelters could be 
contrived for few (the master had one) and there was little food (even the master went 
short). many took il

escaped uninjured from the ruin of the town; and in the days that followed there was 
much sickness and great hunger. 
meanwhile bard took the lead, and ordered things as he wished, though always in the 
master's name, and he had a hard task to govern the people and direct the preparations 
for their protection and housing. probably most of them would have perished in the 
winter that now hurried after autumn, if help had not been to hand. but help came swiftly; 
for bard at once had speedy messengers sent up the river to the forest to ask the aid of

even before the elvenking rode forth the news had passed west right to the pinewoods 
of the misty mountains; beorn had heard it in his wooden house, and the goblins were at 
council in their caves. 
"that will be the last we shall hear of thorin oakenshield, i fear," said the king. "he 
would have done better to have remained my guest. it is an ill wind, all the same," he 
added, "that blows no one any good." for he too had not forgotten the legend of the 
wealth of thror. so it was that bard's messengers found him now marching with many 
spearmen and bowmen; and crows were gathered thick, above him, for they thought that 
war was awakening again, such as had not been in those parts for a long age. but the 
king, when he received the prayers of bard, had pity, for he was the lord of a good and 
kindly people; so turning his march, which had at first been direct towards the mountain, 
he hastened now down the river to the long lake. he had not boats or rafts enough for 
his host, and

gates of thorin son of thrain, king under the mountain?" this time he was answered. 
a tall man stood forward, dark of hair and grim of face, and he cried: 
"hail thorin! why do you fence yourself like a robber in his hold? we are not yet foes, 
and we rejoice that you are alive beyond our hope. we came expecting to find none 
living here; yet now that we are met there is matter for a parley and a council." 
"who are you, and of what would you parley?" 
"i am bard, and by my hand was the dragon slain and your treasure delivered. is that not 
a matter that concerns you? moreover i am by right descent the heir of girion of dale, 
and in your hoard is mingled much of the wealth of his halls and town, which of old 
smaug stole. is not that a matter of which we may speak? further in his last battle 
smaug destroyed the dwellings of the men of esgaroth, and i am yet the servant of their 
master. i would speak for him and ask whether you have no thought for the

as foes and thieves. 
"it is in my mind to ask what share of their inheritance you would have paid to our 
kindred, had you found the hoard unguarded and us slain." 
"a just question," replied bard. "but you are not dead, and we are not robbers. moreover 
the wealthy may have pity beyond right on the needy that befriended them when they 
were in want. and still my other claims remain unanswered." 
"i will not parley, as i have said, with armed men at my gate. nor at all with the people of

you approach the threshold." 
"the elvenking is my friend, and he has succoured the people of the lake in their need, 
though they had no claim but friendship on him," answered bard. 
"we will give you time to repent your words. gather your wisdom ere we return!" then 
he departed and went back to the camp. 
ere many hours were past, the banner-bearers returned, and trumpeters stood forth and 
blew a blast: 
"in the name of esgaroth and the forest," one cried, "we speak unto thorin thrain's son 
oakenshield, calling himself the king under the mountain, and we bid him consider well 
the claims that have been urged, or be declared our foe. at the least he shall deliver one

from that portion bard will himself contribute to the aid of esgaroth; but if thorin would 
have the friendship and honour of the lands about, as his sires had of old, then he will 
give also somewhat of his own for the comfort of the men of the lake." 
then thorin seized a bow of horn and shot an arrow at the speaker. it smote into his 
shield and stuck there quivering.

"let's have a light!" he said. "i am here, if you want me!" and he slipped off his ring, and 
popped from behind a rock. 
they seized him quickly, in spite of their surprise. "who are you? are you the dwarves' 
hobbit? what are you doing? how did you get so far past our sentinels?" they asked one 
after another. 
"i am mr. bilbo baggins," he answered, "companion of thorin, if you want to know. i 
know your king well by sight, though perhaps he doesn't know me to look at. but bard 
will remember me, and it is bard i particularly want to see." 
"indeed!" said they, "and what may be your business?" 
"whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. but if you wish ever to get back to your own 
woods from this cold cheerless place," he answered shivering, "you will take me along 
quiet to a fire, where i can dry-and then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as 
may be. i have only an hour or two to spare." 
that is how it came about that some two hours after his escape

from the gate, bilbo was 
sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too, gazing curiously at 
him, both the elvenking and bard. a hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old 
blanket, was something new to them. 
"really you know," bilbo was saying in his best business manner, "things are impossible. 
personally i am tired of the whole affair. i wish i was back in the west in my own home, 
where folk are more reasonable. but i have an interest in this matter-one fourteenth

"a share in the profits, mind you," he went on. "i am aware of that. 
personally i am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is 
right from the total before putting in my own claim. however you don't know thorin 
oakenshield as well as i do now. i assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of gold 
and starve, as long as you sit here." 
"well, let him!" said bard. "such a fool deserves to starve." 
"quite so," said bilbo. "i see your point of view. at the same time winter is coming on 
fast. before long you will be having snow and what not, and supplies will be difficult - 

even for elves i imagine. also there will be other difficulties. you have not heard of dain 
and the dwarves of the iron hills?" 
"we have, a long time ago; but what has he got to do with us?" asked the king. 
"i thought as much. i see i have some information you have not got. dain

him - a good many of them have had experience in the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, 
of which you have no doubt heard. when they arrive there may be serious trouble." 
"why do you tell us this? are you betraying your friends, or are you threatening us?" 
asked bard grimly. 
"my dear bard!" squeaked bilbo. "don't be so hasty! i never met such suspicious folk! i 
am merely trying to avoid trouble for all concerned. now i will make you an offer!!" 
"let us hear it!" they said. 
"you may see it!" said he. "it is this!" and he drew forth the arkenstone, and threw away 
the wrapping. 
the elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up 
in amazement. even bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. it was as if a globe had been 
filled with moonlight and

hung before them in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars. 
"this is the arkenstone of thrain," said bilbo, "the heart of the mountain; and it is also 
the heart of thorin. he values it above a river of gold. i give it to you. it will aid you in 
your bargaining." then bilbo, not without a shudder, not without a glance of longing, 
handed the marvelous stone to bard, and he held it in his hand, as though dazed. 
"but how is it yours to give?" he asked at last with an effort. 
"o well!" said the hobbit uncomfortably. "it isn't exactly; but, well, i am willing to let it 
stand against all my claim, don't you know. i may be a burglar-or so they say: personally 
i never really felt like one-but i am an honest one, i hope, more or less. anyway i am 
going back now, and the dwarves can do what they like to me. i hope you will find it 
useful."

remain with us, and here you shall be honoured and thrice welcome." 
"thank you very much i am sure," said bilbo with a bow. "but i don't think i ought to 
leave my friends like this, after all we have gone through together. and i promised to 
wake old bombur at midnight, too! really i must be going, and quickly." 
nothing they could say would stop him; so an escort was provided for him, and as he 
went both the king and bard saluted him with honour. as they passed through the camp 
an old man wrapped in a dark cloak, rose from a tent door where he was sitting and 
came towards them. 
"well done! mr. baggins!" he said, clapping bilbo on the back. "there is always more 
about you than anyone expects!" it was gandalf. 
for the first time for many a day bilbo was really delighted. but there was no time for all 
the questions that he immediately wished to ask. 
"all in good time!" said gandalf. "things are drawing towar

"that will be dain!" said thorin when he heard. "they will have got wind of his coming. i 
thought that would alter their mood! bid them come few in number and weaponless, and 
i will hear," he called to the messenger. 
about midday the banners of the forest and the lake were seen to be borne forth again. 
a company of twenty was approaching. at the beginning of the narrow way they laid 
aside sword and spear, and came on towards the gate. 
wondering, the dwarves saw that among them were both bard and the elvenking, 
before whom an old man wrapped in cloak and hood bore a strong casket of ironbound 
wood. 
"hail thorin!" said bard. "are you still of the same mind?" 
"my mind does not change with the rising and setting of a few suns," answered thorin. 
"did you come to ask me idle questions? still the elf-host has not departed as i bade! till 
then you come in vain to bargain with me." 
"is there then nothing for which you would yield any of your gold?" 
"nothing that you or your friends

 held aloft the jewel. the light leapt from his hand, bright and 
white in the morning. 
then thorin was stricken dumb with amazement and confusion. no one spoke for a long 
while. thorin at length broke the silence, and his voice was thick with wrath. "that stone 
was my father's, and is mine," he said. "why should i purchase my own?" but wonder 
overcame him and he added: "but how came you by the heirloom of my house-if there is 
need to ask such a question of thieves?" 
"we are not thieves," bard answered. "your own we will give back in return for our own." 
'how came you by it?" shouted thorin in gathering rage. 
"i gave it them!" squeaked bilbo, who was peeping over the wall, by now, in a dreadful 
fright. 
"you! you!" cried thorin, turning upon him and grasping him with both hands. "you 
miserable hobbit! you undersized-burglar!" he shouted at a loss for words, and he shook 
poor bilbo like a rabbit. 
"by the beard of durin! i wish i had gandalf here! curse him for his choice of you!

"get down now to your friends!" he said to bilbo, "or i will throw you down." 
"what about the gold and silver?" asked bilbo. 
"that shall follow after, as can be arranged," said he. 
"get down!" 
"until then we keep the stone," cried bard. 
"you are not making a very splendid figure as king under the mountain," said gandalf. 
"but things may change yet." 
"they may indeed," said thorin. and already, so strong was the bewilderment of the 
treasure upon him, he was pondering whether by the help of dain he might not recapture 
the arkenstone and withhold the share of the reward. 
and so bilbo was swung down from the wall, and departed with nothing for all his 
trouble, except the armour which thorin had given him already. more than

good for you. it cannot be pierced .by arrows; but if you do not hasten, i will sting your 
miserable feet. so be swift!" 
"not so hasty!" said bard. "we will give you until tomorrow. at noon we will return, and 
see if you have brought from the hoard the portion that is to be set against the stone. if 
that is done without deceit, then we will depart, and the elf-host will go back to the 
forest. in the meanwhile farewell!" 
with that they went back to the camp; but thorin sent messengers by rac telling dain of 
what had passed, and bidding him come with wary speed.

before long the dwarves could be seen coming up the valley at a great pace. they 
halted between the river and the eastern spur; but a few held on their way, and crossing 
the river drew near the camp; and there they laid down their weapons and held up their 
hands in sign of peace. bard went out to meet them, and with him went bilbo. 
"we are sent from dain son of nain," they said when questioned. "we are hastening to 
our kinsmen in the mountain, since we learn that the kingdom of old is renewed. but who 
are you that sit in the plain as foes before defended walls?" this, of. course, in the polite 
and rather old-fashioned language of such occasions, meant simply: "you have no 
business here. we are going on, so make way or we shall fight you!" they meant to

the mountain and the loop of the river, for the narrow land there did not 
seem to be strongly guarded. 
bard, of course, refused to allow the dwarves to go straight on to the mountain. he was 
determined to wait until the gold and silver had been brought out in exchange for the 
arkenstone: for he did not believe that this would be done, if once the fortress was 
manned with so large and warlike a company. 
they had brought with them a great store of supplies; for the dwarves can carry very 
heavy burdens, and nearly all of dain's folks, in spite of their rapid march, bore huge 
packs on their backs i

eks, 
and by that time yet more dwarves might come, and yet more, for thorin had many 
relatives. also they would be able to reopen and guard some other gate, so that the 
besiegers would have to encircle the whole mountain; and for that they had not sufficient 
numbers. 
these were, in fact, precisely their plans (for the raven-messengers had been busy 
between thorin and dain); but for the moment the way was barred, so after angry words 
the dwarf-messengers retired muttering in their beards. bard then sent messengers at 
once to the gate; but they found no gold or payment. 
arrows came forth as soon as they were within shot, and they hastened back in dismay. 
in the camp all was now astir, as if for battle; for the dwarves of dain were advancing 
along the eastern bank. 
"fools!" laughed bard, "to come thus beneath the mountain's arm! they do not 
understand war above ground, whatever they may know of battle in the mines. there are 
many of our archers and spearmen now hidden in the roc

 are fully rested!" 
but the elvenking said: "long will i tarry, ere i begin this war for gold. the dwarves 
cannot press us, unless we will, or do anything that we cannot mark. let us hope still for 
something that will bring reconciliation. 
our advantage in numbers will be enough, if in the end it must come to unhappy blows." 
but he reckoned without the dwarves. the knowledge that the arkenstone was in the 
hands of the besiegers burned in their thoughts; also they guessed the hesitation of bard 
and his friends, and resolved to strike while they debated. 
suddenly without a signal they sprang silently forward to attack. bows twanged and 
arrows whistled; battle was about to be joined. 
still more suddenly a darkness came on with dreadful swiftness! a black cloud hurried 
over the sky. winter thunder on a wild wind rolled roaring up and rumbled in the 
mountain, and lightning lit its peak. and beneath the thunder another blackness could be 
seen whirling forward; but it did not come wi

of the death of smaug, and joy was in their hearts: 
and they hastened night after night through the mountains, and came thus at last on a 
sudden from the north hard on the heels of dain. not even the ravens knew of their 
coming until they came out in the broken lands which divided the lonely mountain from 
the hills behind. how much gandalf knew cannot be said, but it is plain that he had not 
expected this sudden assault. 
this is the plan that he made in council with the elvenking and with bard; and with dain, 
for the dwarf-lord now joined them: the goblins were the foes of all, and at their coming 
all other quarrels were forgotten. their only hope was to lure the goblins into the valley 
between the arms of the mountain; and themselves to man the great spurs that struck 
south and east. yet this would be perilous, if the goblins were in sufficient numbers to 
overrun the mountain itself, and so attack them also from behind and above; but there 
was no time for make any other plan,

or to summon any help. 
soon the thunder passed, rolling away to the south-east; but the batcloud came, flying 
lower, over the shoulder of the mountain, and whirled above them shutting out the light 
and filling them with dread. 
"to the mountain!" called bard. "to the mountain! let us take our places while there is 
yet time!" 
on the southern spur, in its lower slopes and in the rocks at its feet, the elves were set; 
on the eastern spur were men and dwarves. but bard and some of the nimblest of men 
and elves climbed to the height of the eastern shoulder to gain a view to the north. soon 
they could see the lands before the mountain's feet black with a hurrying multitude. ere 
long the vanguard swirled round the spur's end and came rushing into dale. these were 
the swiftest wolfriders, and already their cries and howls rent the air afar. a few brave 
men were strung before them to make a feint of resistance, and many there fell before 
the rest drew back a

day drew on. the goblins gathered again in the valley. there a host of wargs came 
ravening and with them came the bodyguard of bolg, goblins of huge size with scimitars 
of steel. soon actual darkness was coming into a stormy sky; while still the great bats 
swirled about the heads and ears of elves and men, or fastened vampire-like on the 
stricken. now bard was fighting to defend the eastern spur, and yet giving slowly back; 
and the elf-lords were at bay about their king upon the southern arm, near to the watch-
post on ravenhill. 
suddenly there was a great shout, and from the gate came a trumpet call. 
they had forgotten thorin! part of the wall, moved by levers, fell outward with a crash 
into the pool. out leapt the king under the mountain, and his companions followed him. 
hood and cloak were gone; they were in shining armour, and red light

old in a dying fire. 
rocks were buried down from on high by the goblins above; but they held on leapt down 
to the falls' foot, and rushed forward to battle. wolf and rider fell or fled before them. 
thorin wielded his axe with mighty strokes, and nothing seemed to harm him. 
"to me! to me! elves and men! to me! o my kinsfolk!" he cried, and his voice shook 
like a horn in the valley. 
down, heedless of order, rushed all the dwarves of dain to his help. down too came 
many of the lake-men, for bard could not restrain them; and out upon the other side 
came many of the spearmen of the elves. once again the goblins were stricken in the 

valley; and they were piled in heaps till dale was dark and hideous with their corpses. 
the wargs were scattered and thorin drove right against the bodyguards of bolg. but 
he could not pierce their ranks. 
already behind him among the goblin dead lay many men and many dwarves, and many 
a fair elf that should have lived yet long ages merrily in the wood.

aring, i suppose, some last blast of 
magic before the end. 
that did not seem far off. "it will not be long now," thought bilbo, "before the goblins win 
the gate, and we are all slaughtered or driven down and captured. really it is enough to 
make one weep, after all one has gone through. i would rather old smaug had been left 
with all the wretched treasure, than that these vile creatures should get it, and poor old 
bombur, and balin and fili and kili and all the rest come to a bad end; and bard too, and 
the lake-men and the merry elves. misery me! i have heard songs of many battles, and i 
have always understood that defeat may be glorious. it seems very uncomfortable, not 
to say distressing. i wish i was well out of it." 
the clouds were torn by the wind, and a red sunset slashed the west. 
seeing the sudden gleam in the gloom bilbo looked round. he gave a great cry: he had 
seen a sight that made his heart leap, dark shapes small yet majestic against the distant 
glow.

ve gone back to their eyries. they 
would not stay here, and departed with the first light of morning. dain has crowned their 
chief with gold, and sworn friendship with them for ever." 
"i am sorry. i mean, i should have liked to see them again," said bilbo sleepily; "perhaps 
i shall see them on the way home. i suppose i shall be going home soon?" 
"as soon as you like," said the wizard. 
actually it was some days before bilbo really set out. 
they buried thorin deep beneath the mountain, and bard laid the 
arkenstone upon his breast. 
"there let it lie till the mountain falls!" he said. "may it bring good fortune to all his folk 
that dwell here after!" upon his tomb the elvenking then laid orcrist, the elvish sword 
that had been taken from thorin in captivity. it is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the 
dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise. 
there now dain son of nain took up his abode, and he became king under the 
mountain, and

horin, ten remained. fili and kili had fallen defending him 

with shield and body, for he was their mother's elder brother. the others remained with 
dain; for dain dealt his treasure well. 
there was, of course, no longer any question of dividing the hoard in such shares as 
had been planned, to balin and dwalin, and dori and nori and ori, and oin and gloin, 
and bifur and bofur and bombur-or to bilbo. yet a fourteenth share of all the silver and 
gold, wrought and unwrought, was given up to bard; for dain said: "we will honour the 
agreement of the dead, and he has now the arkenstone in his keeping." 
even a fourteenth share was wealth exceedingly great, greater than that of many mortal 
kings. from that treasure bard sent much gold to the master of lake-town; and he 
rewarded his followers and friends freely. to the elvenking he gave the emeralds of 
girion, such jewels as he most loved, which dain had restored to him. to bilbo he said: 
"this treasure is as much yours as it is mine;

a dwarf; and the dwarf was actually 
balin. 
"come in! come in!" said bilbo, and soon they were settled in chairs by the fire. if balin 
noticed that mr. baggins' waistcoat was more extensive (and had real gold buttons), 
bilbo also noticed that balm's beard was several inches longer, and his jewelled belt was 
of great magnificence. 
they fell to talking of their times together, of course, and bilbo asked how things were 
going in the lands of the mountain. it seemed they were going very well. bard had rebuilt 
the town in dale and men had gathered to him from the lake and from south and west, 
and all the valley had become tilled again and rich, and the desolation was now filled 
with birds and blossoms in spring and fruit and feasting in autumn. and lake-town was 
refounded and was more prosperous than ever, and much wealth went up and down the 
running river; and there was friendship in those parts between elves and dwarves and 
men. 
the old master had come to a bad end. bard had give
