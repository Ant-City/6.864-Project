sister on the
bank, and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the
book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in
it, â€˜and what is the use of a book,â€™ thought alice â€˜without pictures or
conversations?â€™

so she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could, for the
hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether the pleasure
of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and
picking the daisies, when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran
close by her.

there was nothing so very remarkable in that; nor did alice think it so
very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself, â€˜oh dear!
oh dear! i shall be late!â€™ (when she thought it over afterwards, it
occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this, but at the time
it all seemed quite natural); but when the rabbit actually took a watch
out of its waistcoat-pocket, and looked at it, and then hurried on,
alice started to her feet, for it flash

 matter which way she put it. she felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, â€˜now, dinah, tell me the truth:
did you ever eat a bat?â€™ when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon
a heap of sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment:
she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her was another
long passage, and the white rabbit was still in sight, hurrying down it.
there was not a moment to be lost: away went alice like the wind, and
was just in time to hear it say, as it turned a corner, â€˜oh my ears
and whiskers, how late itâ€™s getting!â€™ she was close behind it when she
turned the corner, but the rabbit was no longer to be seen: she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging
from the roof.

there were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked; and when
alice had been a

cat in the world! oh, my dear dinah! i wonder if i shall ever see you
any more!â€™ and here poor alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. in a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




chapter iv. the rabbit sends in a little bill

it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself â€˜the duchess! the duchess! oh my dear paws! oh
my fur and whiskers! sheâ€™ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! where can i have dropped them, i wonder?â€™ alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves,
and she very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everythi

diers carrying clubs; these were all shaped like
the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and feet at the
corners: next the ten courtiers; these were ornamented all over with
diamonds, and walked two and two, as the soldiers did. after these came
the royal children; there were ten of them, and the little dears came
jumping merrily along hand in hand, in couples: they were all ornamented
with hearts. next came the guests, mostly kings and queens, and among
them alice recognised the white rabbit: it was talking in a hurried
nervous manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her. then followed the knave of hearts, carrying the kingâ€™s
crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this grand
procession, came the king and queen of hearts.

alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face
like the three gardeners, but she could not remember ever having heard
of such a rule at processions; â€˜and besides, what would be the use of

 the queen.

â€˜their heads are gone, if it please your majesty!â€™ the soldiers shouted
in reply.

â€˜thatâ€™s right!â€™ shouted the queen. â€˜can you play croquet?â€™

the soldiers were silent, and looked at alice, as the question was
evidently meant for her.

â€˜yes!â€™ shouted alice.

â€˜come on, then!â€™ roared the queen, and alice joined the procession,
wondering very much what would happen next.

â€˜itâ€™s--itâ€™s a very fine day!â€™ said a timid voice at her side. she was
walking by the white rabbit, who was peeping anxiously into her face.

â€˜very,â€™ said alice: â€˜--whereâ€™s the duchess?â€™

â€˜hush! hush!â€™ said the rabbit in a low, hurried tone. he looked
anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised himself upon
tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and whispered â€˜sheâ€™s under
sentence of execution.â€™

â€˜what for?â€™ said alice.

â€˜did you say â€œwhat a pity!â€?â€™ the rabbit asked.

â€˜no, i didnâ€™t,â€™ said alice: â€˜i donâ€™t think itâ€™s at all a pity. i s

 gryphon added â€˜come, letâ€™s hear some of your adventures.â€™

â€˜i could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,â€™ said
alice a little timidly: â€˜but itâ€™s no use going back to yesterday,
because i was a different person then.â€™

â€˜explain all that,â€™ said the mock turtle.

â€˜no, no! the adventures first,â€™ said the gryphon in an impatient tone:
â€˜explanations take such a dreadful time.â€™

so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the white rabbit. she was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating â€˜you are old, father william,â€™ to the caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath,
and said â€˜thatâ€™s very curious.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s all about as curious as it can be,â€™ sai

chapter xi. who stole the tarts?

the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they
arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts of little
birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards: the knave was
standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on each side to guard
him; and near the king was the white rabbit, with a trumpet in one hand,
and a scroll of parchment in the other. in the very middle of the court
was a table, with a large dish of tarts upon it: they looked so good,
that it made alice quite hungry to look at them--â€˜i wish theyâ€™d get the
trial done,â€™ she thought, â€˜and hand round the refreshments!â€™ but there
seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had read
about

 it at all. however, â€˜jury-menâ€™ would have done
just as well.

the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. â€˜what are they
doing?â€™ alice whispered to the gryphon. â€˜they canâ€™t have anything to put
down yet, before the trialâ€™s begun.â€™

â€˜theyâ€™re putting down their names,â€™ the gryphon whispered in reply, â€˜for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.â€™

â€˜stupid things!â€™ alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, â€˜silence in the court!â€™ and the
king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
was talking.

alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their shoulders,
that all the jurors were writing down â€˜stupid things!â€™ on their slates,
and she could even make out that one of them didnâ€™t know how to spell
â€˜stupid,â€™ and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him. â€˜a nice
muddle their slatesâ€™ll be in before the trialâ€™s over!â€™ thought alice.

d. this of course, alice
could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and
very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. she did it so quickly
that the poor little juror (it was bill, the lizard) could not make out
at all what had become of it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was
obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was
of very little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

â€˜herald, read the accusation!â€™ said the king.

on this the white rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and then
unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

   â€˜the queen of hearts, she made some tarts,
      all on a summer day:
    the knave of hearts, he stole those tarts,
      and took them quite away!â€™

â€˜consider your verdict,â€™ the king said to the jury.

â€˜not yet, not yet!â€™ the rabbit hastily interrupted. â€˜thereâ€™s a great
deal to come before that!â€™

â€˜call the first witness,â€™ said the king; and the white rabbit blew three

officers: but the hatter was out of sight before the officer could get
to the door.

â€˜call the next witness!â€™ said the king.

the next witness was the duchessâ€™s cook. she carried the pepper-box in
her hand, and alice guessed who it was, even before she got into the
court, by the way the people near the door began sneezing all at once.

â€˜give your evidence,â€™ said the king.

â€˜shanâ€™t,â€™ said the cook.

the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a low voice,
â€˜your majesty must cross-examine this witness.â€™

â€˜well, if i must, i must,â€™ the king said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, â€˜what are tarts made of?â€™

â€˜pepper, mostly,â€™ said the cook.

â€˜treacle,â€™ said a sleepy voice behind her.

â€˜collar that dormouse,â€™ the queen shrieked out. â€˜behead that dormouse!

for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

â€˜never mind!â€™ said the king, with an air of great relief. â€˜call the next
witness.â€™ and he added in an undertone to the queen, â€˜really, my dear,
you must cross-examine the next witness. it quite makes my forehead
ache!â€™

alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list, feeling very
curious to see what the next witness would be like, â€˜--for they havenâ€™t
got much evidence yet,â€™ she said to herself. imagine her surprise, when
the white rabbit read out, at the top of his shrill little voice, the
name â€˜alice!â€™




chapter xii. aliceâ€™s evidence

large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she jumped up in such
a hurry that she tipped over the jur

ligently to write out a history of the
accident, all except the lizard, who seemed too much overcome to do
anything but sit with its mouth open, gazing up into the roof of the
court.

â€˜what do you know about this business?â€™ the king said to alice.

â€˜nothing,â€™ said alice.

â€˜nothing whatever?â€™ persisted the king.

â€˜nothing whatever,â€™ said alice.

â€˜thatâ€™s very important,â€™ the king said, turning to the jury. they were
just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the white rabbit
interrupted: â€˜unimportant, your majesty means, of course,â€™ he said in a
very respectful tone, but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke.

â€˜unimportant, of course, i meant,â€™ the king hastily said, and went on
to himself in an undertone,

â€˜important--unimportant--unimportant--important--â€™ as if he were trying
which word sounded best.

some of the jury wrote it down â€˜important,â€™ and some â€˜unimportant.â€™
alice could see this, as she was near enough to look over their slate

d it just now.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s the oldest rule in the book,â€™ said the king.

â€˜then it ought to be number one,â€™ said alice.

the king turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily. â€˜consider your
verdict,â€™ he said to the jury, in a low, trembling voice.

â€˜thereâ€™s more evidence to come yet, please your majesty,â€™ said the white
rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; â€˜this paper has just been picked
up.â€™

â€˜whatâ€™s in it?â€™ said the queen.

â€˜i havenâ€™t opened it yet,â€™ said the white rabbit, â€˜but it seems to be a
letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.â€™

â€˜it must have been that,â€™ said the king, â€˜unless it was written to
nobody, which isnâ€™t usual, you know.â€™

â€˜who is it directed to?â€™ said one of the jurymen.

â€˜it isnâ€™t directed at all,â€™ said the white rabbit; â€˜in fact, thereâ€™s
nothing written on the outside.â€™ he unfolded the paper as he spoke, and
added â€˜it isnâ€™t a letter, after all: itâ€™s a set of verses.â€™

â€˜are they in the prisonerâ

€™s handwriting?â€™ asked another of the jurymen.

â€˜no, theyâ€™re not,â€™ said the white rabbit, â€˜and thatâ€™s the queerest thing
about it.â€™ (the jury all looked puzzled.)

â€˜he must have imitated somebody elseâ€™s hand,â€™ said the king. (the jury
all brightened up again.)

â€˜please your majesty,â€™ said the knave, â€˜i didnâ€™t write it, and they
canâ€™t prove i did: thereâ€™s no name signed at the end.â€™

â€˜if you didnâ€™t sign it,â€™ said the king, â€˜that only makes the matter
worse. you must have meant some mischief, or else youâ€™d have signed your
name like an honest man.â

there was a general clapping of hands at this: it was the first really
clever thing the king had said that day.

â€˜that proves his guilt,â€™ said the queen.

â€˜it proves nothing of the sort!â€™ said alice. â€˜why, you donâ€™t even know
what theyâ€™re about!â€™

â€˜read them,â€™ said the king.

the white rabbit put on his spectacles. â€˜where shall i begin, please
your majesty?â€™ he asked.

â€˜begin at the beginning,â€™ the king said gravely, â€˜and go on till you
come to the end: then stop.â€™

these were the verses the white rabbit read:--

   â€˜they told me you had been to her,
    and mentioned me to him:
   she gave me a good character,
    but said i could not swim.

   he sent them word i had not gone

irst, she dreamed of little alice herself, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
would always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sisterâ€™s dream.

the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by--the
frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the duchessâ€™s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the
lizardâ€™s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea
