  glo. braue peeres of england, pillars of the state,
to you duke humfrey must vnload his greefe:
your greefe, the common greefe of all the land.
what? did my brother henry spend his youth,
his valour, coine, and people in the warres?
did he so often lodge in open field:
in winters cold, and summers parching heate,
to conquer france, his true inheritance?
and did my brother bedford toyle his wits,
to keepe by policy what henrie got:
haue you your selues, somerset, buckingham,

large summes of gold, and dowries with their wiues,
and our king henry giues away his owne,
to match with her that brings no vantages

oh father, maine is lost,

main-chance father you meant, but i meant maine,
which i will win from france, or else be slaine.

exit warwicke, and salisbury. manet yorke.

  yorke. aniou and maine are giuen to the french,
paris is lost, the state of normandie
stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
suffolke concluded on the articles,
the peeres agreed, and henry was well pleas'd,
to change two dukedomes for a dukes faire daughter.
i cannot blame them all, what is't to them?
'tis thine they giue away, and not their owne.
pirates may make cheape penyworths of their pillage,
and purchase friends, and giue to curtezans,
still reuelling like lords till all be gone,

weepes ouer them, and wrings his haplesse hands,
and shakes his head, and trembling stands aloofe,
