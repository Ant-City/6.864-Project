     you may here all. but, pray you,

     did not i say, i would send?

     corv: yes, but i fear'd
     you might forget it, and then they prevent us.

     mos [aside.]: prevent! did e'er man haste so, for his horns?
     a courtier would not ply it so, for a place.
     --well, now there's no helping it, stay here;
     i'll presently return.

     resolve upon it: i have so decreed.
     it must be done. nor would i move't, afore,
     because i would avoid all shifts and tricks,
     that might deny me.

     cel: sir, let me beseech you,
     affect not these strange trials; if you doubt
     my chastity, why, lock me up for ever:
     make me the heir of darkness. let me live,

     why i'faith, it is her modesty, i must quit her.
     if you were absent, she would be more coming;
     i know it: and dare undertake for her.
     what woman can before her husband? 'pray you,
     let us depart, and leave her here.

     thou may'st redeem all, yet; i'll say no more:

     is shame fled human breasts? that with such ease,
     men dare put off your honours, and their own?
     is that, which ever was a cause of life,
     now placed beneath the basest circumstance,
     and modesty an exile made, for money?

     he would have sold his part of paradise
     for ready money, had he met a cope-man.
     why art thou mazed to see me thus revived?
     rather applaud thy beauty's miracle;
     'tis thy great work: that hath, not now alone,
     but sundry times raised me, in several shapes,
     and, but this morning, like a mountebank;
     to see thee at thy window: ay, before
     i would have left my practice, for thy love,

     nor let thy false imagination
     that i was bed-rid, make thee think i am so:
     thou shalt not find it. i am, now, as fresh,
     as hot, as high, and in as jovial plight,
     as when, in that so celebrated scene,
     at recitation of our comedy,
     for entertainment of the great valois,
     i acted young antinous; and attracted
     the eyes and ears of all the ladies present,
     to admire each graceful gesture, note, and footing.

     come, my celia, let us prove,
     while we can, the sports of love,
     time will not be ours for ever,
     he, at length, our good will sever;
     spend not then his gifts in vain;
     suns, that set, may rise again:
     but if once we loose this light,
     'tis with us perpetual night.
     why should we defer our joys?
     fame and rumour are but toys.
     cannot we delude the eyes
     of a few poor household spies?
     or his easier ears beguile,
     thus remooved by our wile?--
