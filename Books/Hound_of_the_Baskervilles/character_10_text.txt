heavy stick the dog has held it tightly by the middle, and the marks of
his teeth are very plainly visible. the dog’s jaw, as shown in the space
between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a terrier and not
broad enough for a mastiff. it may have been--yes, by jove, it is a
curly-haired spaniel.”

he had risen and paced the room as he spoke. now he halted in the recess
of the window. there was such a ring of conviction in his voice that i
glanced up in surprise.

“my dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?”

“for the very simple reason that i see the dog himself on our very
door-step, and there is the ring of its owner. don’t move, i beg you,
watson. he is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be
of assistance to me. now is the dramatic moment of fate, watson, when
you hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you
know not whether for good or ill

of it. this small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of grimpen,
where our friend dr. mortimer has his headquarters. within a radius of
five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered dwellings.
here is lafter hall, which was mentioned in the narrative. there is
a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
naturalist--stapleton, if i remember right, was his name. here are two
moorland farmhouses, high tor and foulmire. then fourteen miles away the
great convict prison of princetown. between and around these scattered
points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. this, then, is the stage
upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may help to play
it again.”

other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. i think we’ll shut
that window again, if you don’t mind. it is a singular thing, but i find
that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. i have
not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but that is
the logical outcome of my convictions. have you turned the case over in
your mind?”

“yes, i have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.”

“it is very bewildering.”

“it has certainly a character of its own. there are points of
distinction about it. that change in the footprints, for example. what
do you make of that?”

a steep curve of heath-clad land, an outlying spur of the moor, lay in
front of us. on the summit, hard and clear like an equestrian statue
upon its pedestal, was a mounted soldier, dark and stern, his rifle
poised ready over his forearm. he was watching the road along which we
travelled.

“what is this, perkins?” asked dr. mortimer.

our driver half turned in his seat. “there’s a convict escaped from
princetown, sir. he’s been out three days now, and the warders watch
every road and every station, but they’ve had no sight of him yet. the
farmers about here don’t like it, sir, and that’s a fact.”

“well, i understand that they get five pounds if they can give
information.”

“yes, sir, but the chance of five pounds is but a poor thing compared
to the chance of having your throat cut. you see, it isn’t like any
ordinary convict. this is a man that would stick at

“queer spot to choose, is it not?” said he as if in answer to my
thought. “and yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,
beryl?”

“quite happy,” said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her
words.

privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds,

moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. let me, therefore,
return to the facts concerning sir henry baskerville.

if you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
up to today there was nothing of importance to relate. then a very
surprising circumstance occurred, which i shall tell you in due course.
but, first of all, i must keep you in touch with some of the other
factors in the situation.

one of these, concerning which i have said little, is the escaped
convict upon the moor. there is strong reason now to believe that he
has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely
householders of this district. a fortnight has passed since his flight,
during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. it
is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during
all that time. of course, so far as his concealment goes there is
no difficulty at all. any one of these stone huts would give him a
hiding-place. but there

apart from the law he seems a kindly, good-natured person, and i
only mention him because you were particular that i should send some
description of the people who surround us. he is curiously employed
at present, for, being an amateur astronomer, he has an excellent
telescope, with which he lies upon the roof of his own house and sweeps
the moor all day in the hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped
convict. if he would confine his energies to this all would be well, but
there are rumours that he intends to prosecute dr. mortimer for opening
a grave without the consent of the next of kin because he dug up the
neolithic skull in the barrow on long down. he helps to keep our lives
from being monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly
needed.

and now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
stapletons, dr. mortimer, and frankland, of lafter hall, let me end on

 said the butler.

“oh, john, john, have i brought you to this? it is my doing, sir
henry--all mine. he has done nothing except for my sake and because i
asked him.”

“speak out, then! what does it mean?”

“my unhappy brother is starving on the moor. we cannot let him perish at
our very gates. the light is a signal to him that food is ready for him,
and his light out yonder is to show the spot to which to bring it.”

“then your brother is--”

“the escaped convict, sir--selden, the criminal.”

“that’s the truth, sir,” said barrymore. “i said that it was not my
secret and that i could not tell it to you. but now you have heard it,
and you will see that if there was a plot it was not against you.”

this, then, was the explanation of the stealthy expeditions at night
and the light at the window. sir henry and i both stared at the woman in
amazement. was it possible that this stolidly respectable person was of
the same blood as one of the most no

 sure if he was still there by putting a
light in the window, and if there was an answer my husband took out some
bread and meat to him. every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long
as he was there we could not desert him. that is the whole truth, as i
am an honest christian woman and you will see that if there is blame in
the matter it does not lie with my husband but with me, for whose sake
he has done all that he has.”

the woman’s words came with an intense earnestness which carried
conviction with them.

“is this true, barrymore?”

“yes, sir henry. every word of it.”

“well, i cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. forget what
i have said. go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about
this matter in the morning.”

when they were gone we looked out of the window again. sir henry had
flung it open, and the cold night wind beat in upon our faces. far away
in the black distance there still glowed that one tiny point of yellow
light.

“i wonder he da

he lay. it all fits together. i don’t think that i am a coward, watson,

it was as cold as a block of marble.

“you’ll be all right tomorrow.”

“i don’t think i’ll get that cry out of my head. what do you advise that
we do now?”

“shall we turn back?”

“no, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. we
after the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. come
on! we’ll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon
the moor.”

we stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the
craggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily
in front. there is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon
a pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon
the horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.

something had evidently aroused his suspicions. it may have been that
barrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or
the fellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not
well, but i could read his fears upon his wicked face. any instant he
might dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. i sprang forward
therefore, and sir henry did the same. at the same moment the convict
screamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against
the boulder which had sheltered us. i caught one glimpse of his short,
squat, strongly built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to run.
at the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the clouds.
we rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man running with
great speed down the other side, springing over the stones in his way
with the activity of a mountain goat. a lucky long shot of my revolv

tatue on that shining background, i saw the figure of a man upon the
tor. do not think that it was a delusion, holmes. i assure you that
i have never in my life seen anything more clearly. as far as i could
judge, the figure was that of a tall, thin man. he stood with his legs
a little separated, his arms folded, his head bowed, as if he were
brooding over that enormous wilderness of peat and granite which lay
before him. he might have been the very spirit of that terrible place.
it was not the convict. this man was far from the place where the
latter had disappeared. besides, he was a much taller man. with a cry
of surprise i pointed him out to the baronet, but in the instant during
which i had turned to grasp his arm the man was gone. there was the
sharp pinnacle of granite still cutting the lower edge of the moon, but
its peak bore no trace of that silent and motionless figure.

i wished to go in that direction and to search the tor, but it was some
distance away. the baronet’s nerves we

far i have been able to quote from the reports which i have forwarded
during these early days to sherlock holmes. now, however, i have arrived
at a point in my narrative where i am compelled to abandon this method
and to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which
i kept at the time. a few extracts from the latter will carry me on to
those scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. i
proceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the
convict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.

october 16th. a dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. the house
is banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the
dreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the
hills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon
their wet faces. it is melancholy outside and in. the baronet is in a
black reaction after the excitements of the night. i am conscious myself
of a weight at my heart

evident to me that he had been very busy
of late, for the notes which i had from baker street were few and short,
with no comments upon the information which i had supplied and hardly
any reference to my mission. no doubt his blackmailing case is absorbing
all his faculties. and yet this new factor must surely arrest his
attention and renew his interest. i wish that he were here.

october 17th. all day today the rain poured down, rustling on the ivy
and dripping from the eaves. i thought of the convict out upon the
bleak, cold, shelterless moor. poor devil! whatever his crimes, he has
suffered something to atone for them. and then i thought of that other
one--the face in the cab, the figure against the moon. was he also out
in that deluged--the unseen watcher, the man of darkness? in the evening
i put on my waterproof and i walked far upon the sodden moor, full of
dark imaginings, the rain beating upon my face and the wind whistling
about my ears. god help those who wander into the great mire

t the food was gone when next i went that way.”

“then he was certainly there?”

“so you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.”

i sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at barrymore.

“you know that there is another man then?”

“yes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.”

“have you seen him?”

“no, sir.”

“how do you know of him then?”

“selden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. he’s in hiding, too,
but he’s not a convict as far as i can make out. i don’t like it, dr.
watson--i tell you straight, sir, that i don’t like it.” he spoke with a
sudden passion of earnestness.

“now, listen to me, barrymore! i have no interest in this matter but
that of your master. i have come here with no object except to help him.
tell me, frankly, what it is that you don’t like.”

barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst or
found it difficult to express his own feelings in words.

“it’s all

 but nothing would induce me to help the
rascals in any way.”

i had been casting round for some excuse by which i could get away
from his gossip, but now i began to wish to hear more of it. i had seen
enough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any
strong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.

“some poaching case, no doubt?” said i with an indifferent manner.

“ha, ha, my boy, a very much more important matter than that! what about
the convict on the moor?”

i stared. “you don’t mean that you know where he is?” said i.

“i may not know exactly where he is, but i am quite sure that i could
help the police to lay their hands on him. has it never struck you that
the way to catch that man was to find out where he got his food and so
trace it to him?”

he certainly seemed to be getting uncomfortably near the truth. “no
doubt,” said i; “but how do you know that he is anywhere upon the moor?”

“i know it because i have

 seen with my own eyes the messenger who takes
him his food.”

my heart sank for barrymore. it was a serious thing to be in the power
of this spiteful old busybody. but his next remark took a weight from my
mind.

“you’ll be surprised to hear that his food is taken to him by a child.
i see him every day through my telescope upon the roof. he passes along
the same path at the same hour, and to whom should he be going except to
the convict?”

here was luck indeed! and yet i suppressed all appearance of interest. a
child! barrymore had said that our unknown was supplied by a boy. it was
on his track, and not upon the convict’s, that frankland had stumbled.
if i could get his knowledge it might save me a long and weary hunt. but
incredulity and indifference were evidently my strongest cards.

“i should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one of
the moorland shepherds taking out his father’s dinner.”

you threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment when you charged
into the empty hut.”

“exactly.”

“i thought as much--and knowing your admirable tenacity i was convinced
that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach, waiting for the
tenant to return. so you actually thought that i was the criminal?”

“i did not know who you were, but i was determined to find out.”

“excellent, watson! and how did you localize me? you saw me, perhaps, on
the night of the convict hunt, when i was so imprudent as to allow the
moon to rise behind me?”

“yes, i saw you then.”

“and have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?”

“no, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to
look.”

“the old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. i could not make it out
when first i saw the light flashing upon the lens.” he rose and peeped
into the hut. “ha, i see that cartwright has brought up some supplies.

those
contorted limbs struck me with a spasm of pain and blurred my eyes with
tears.

“we must send for help, holmes! we cannot carry him all the way to the
hall. good heavens, are you mad?”

he had uttered a cry and bent over the body. now he was dancing and
laughing and wringing my hand. could this be my stern, self-contained
friend? these were hidden fires, indeed!

“a beard! a beard! the man has a beard!”

“a beard?”

“it is not the baronet--it is--why, it is my neighbour, the convict!”

with feverish haste we had turned the body over, and that dripping beard
was pointing up to the cold, clear moon. there could be no doubt about
the beetling forehead, the sunken animal eyes. it was indeed the same
face which had glared upon me in the light of the candle from over the
rock--the face of selden, the criminal.

then in an instant it was all clear to me. i remembered how the baronet
had told me that he had handed his old wardrobe to barrymore. barrymore

and joy.

“then the clothes have been the poor devil’s death,” said he. “it is
clear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of
sir henry’s--the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all
probability--and so ran this man down. there is one very singular thing,
however: how came selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound was on
his trail?”

“he heard him.”

“to hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this
convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture
by screaming wildly for help. by his cries he must have run a long way
after he knew the animal was on his track. how did he know?”

“a greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our
conjectures are correct--”

“i presume nothing.”

“well, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. i suppose that it
does not always run loose upon the moor. stapleton would not let it go

which even in daylight were not pleasant to hear. on an emergency he
could keep the hound in the out-house at merripit, but it was always a
risk, and it was only on the supreme day, which he regarded as the end
of all his efforts, that he dared do it. this paste in the tin is no
doubt the luminous mixture with which the creature was daubed. it was
suggested, of course, by the story of the family hell-hound, and by the
desire to frighten old sir charles to death. no wonder the poor devil of
a convict ran and screamed, even as our friend did, and as we ourselves
might have done, when he saw such a creature bounding through the
darkness of the moor upon his track. it was a cunning device, for, apart
from the chance of driving your victim to his death, what peasant would
venture to inquire too closely into such a creature should he get sight
of it, as many have done, upon the moor? i said it in london, watson,

“i have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being
forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey. they were of
great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece
of biography of stapleton’s. i was able to establish the identity of
the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how i stood. the case
had been considerably complicated through the incident of the escaped
convict and the relations between him and the barrymores. this also you
cleared up in a very effective way, though i had already come to the
same conclusions from my own observations.

“by the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a complete
knowledge of the whole business, but i had not a case which could go to
a jury. even stapleton’s attempt upon sir henry that night which ended
in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving
murder against our man. there seemed

lady, even though it was part of his own plan, still he could not help
interrupting with a passionate outburst which revealed the fiery soul
which his self-contained manner so cleverly concealed. by encouraging
the intimacy he made it certain that sir henry would frequently come
to merripit house and that he would sooner or later get the opportunity
which he desired. on the day of the crisis, however, his wife turned
suddenly against him. she had learned something of the death of the
convict, and she knew that the hound was being kept in the outhouse on
the evening that sir henry was coming to dinner. she taxed her husband
with his intended crime, and a furious scene followed in which he showed
her for the first time that she had a rival in his love. her fidelity
turned in an instant to bitter hatred, and he saw that she would betray
him. he tied her up, therefore, that she might have no chance of warning
sir henry, and he hoped, no doubt, that when the whole countryside put
down t
