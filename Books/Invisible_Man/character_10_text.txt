linked by invisible strings. waves of heat danced above the engine hood. the
tires sang over the highway. finally i overcame my timidity and asked him:
"sir, why did you become interested in the school?"
"i think," he said, thoughtfully, raising his voice, "it was because i
felt even as a young man that your people were somehow closely connected
with my destiny. do you understand?"
"not so clearly, sir," i said, ashamed to admit it.
"you have studied emerson, haven't you?"
"emerson, sir?"
"ralph waldo emerson."
i was embarrassed because i hadn't. "not yet, sir. we haven't come
to him yet."
"no?" he said with a note of surprise. "well, never mind. i am a
new englander, like emerson. you must learn about him, for he was
important to your people. he had a hand in your destiny. yes, perhaps that
is what i mean. i had a feeling that your people were somehow connected
with my destiny. that what happened to you was connected with what would
happen to me .

eady arranged it."
"oh," i said with disappointment. i had hoped that by serving him
the rest of the week i could win back his esteem. now i would not have the
opportunity.
"well, i hope you have a pleasant trip, sir," i said.
"thank you," he said, suddenly smiling.
"and maybe next time you come i'll be able to answer some of the
questions you asked me this afternoon."
"questions?" his eyes narrowed.
"yes, sir, about . . . about your fate," i said.
"ah, yes, yes," he said.
"and i intend to read emerson, too . . ."
"very good. self-reliance is a most worthy virtue. i shall look forward
with the greatest of interest to learning your contribution to my fate." he
motioned me toward the door. "and don't forget to see dr. bledsoe."
i left somewhat reassured, but not completely. i still had to face dr.
bledsoe. and i had to attend chapel.

at the sound of vespers i moved across the campus with groups of
students, walking slowly, their voices soft in the mellow dusk. i remember the

were polite they hardly saw me, that they would have begged the pardon of
jack the bear, never glancing his way if the bear happened to be walking
along minding his business. it was confusing. i did not know if it was
desirable or undesirable . . .
but my main concern was seeing the trustees and after more than a
week of seeing the city and being vaguely encouraged by secretaries, i became
impatient. i had distributed all but the letter to a mr. emerson, who i knew
from the papers was away from the city. several times i started down to see
what had happened but changed my mind. i did not wish to seem too
impatient. but time was becoming short. unless i found work soon i would
never earn enough to enter school by fall. i had already written home that i
was working for a member of the trustee board, and the only letter i had
received so far was one telling me how wonderful they thought it was and
warning me against the ways of the wicked city. n

ow i couldn't write them
for money without revealing that i had been lying about the job.
finally i tried to reach the important men by telephone, only to
receive polite refusals by their secretaries. but fortunately i still had the letter
to mr. emerson. i decided to use it, but instead of handing it over to a
secretary, i wrote a letter explaining that i had a message from dr. bledsoe
and requesting an appointment. maybe i've been wrong about the secretaries,
i thought; maybe they destroyed the letters. i should have been more careful.
i thought of mr. norton. if only the last letter had been addressed to
him. if only he lived in new york so that i could make a personal appeal!
somehow i felt closer to mr. norton, and felt that if he should s

red not talk to anyone about my problems; not even the
officials at men's house, for since they had learned that i was to be assigned
to an important job, they treated me with a certain deference; therefore i was
careful to hide my growing doubts. after all, i thought, i might have to ask
for credit and i'll have to appear a good risk. no, the thing to do was to
keep faith. i'd start out once more in the morning. something was certain to
happen tomorrow. and it did. i received a letter from mr. emerson.
chapter 9
it was a clear, bright day when i went out, and the sun burned
warm upon my eyes. only a few flecks of snowy cloud hung high in the
morning-blue sky, and already a woman was hanging wash on a roof. i felt
better walking along. a feeling of confidence grew. far down the island the
skyscrapers rose tall and mysterious in the thin, pastel haze. a milk truck
went past. i thought of the school. what were they doing now on the
campus? had the moon sunk low and the sun climbed clear? had th

 came to hand just as easily as the coin which i now
placed on the counter for my breakfast. it was fifteen cents and as i felt for
a nickel i took out another dime, thinking, is it an insult when one of us
tips one of them?
i looked for the counterman, seeing him serving a plate of pork
chops and grits to a man with a pale blond mustache, and stared; then i
slapped the dime on the counter and left, annoyed that the dime did not ring
as loud as a fifty-cent piece.
when i reached the door of mr. emerson's office it occurred to me
that perhaps i should have waited until the business of the day was under
way, but i disregarded the idea and went ahead. my being early would be, i
hoped, an indication of both how badly i wanted work, and how promptly i
would perform any assignment given me. besides, wasn't there a saying that
the first person of the day to enter a business would get a bargain? or was
that said only of jewish business? i removed the letter from my brief case.

suggest another school. i guess one's college is really a kind of mother and
father . . . a sacred matter."
"yes, sir. that's it," i said in hurried agreement.
his eyes narrowed. "but now i must ask you an embarrassing
question. do you mind?"
"why, no, sir," i said nervously.
"i don't like to ask this, but it's quite necessary . . ." he leaned
forward with a pained frown. "tell me, did you read the letter which you
brought to mr. emerson? this," he said, taking the letter from the table.
"why, no, sir! it wasn't addressed to me, so naturally i wouldn't
think of opening it . . ."
"of course not, i know you wouldn't," he said, fluttering his hand
and sitting erect. "i'm sorry and you must dismiss it, like one of those
annoying personal questions you find so often nowadays on supposedly
impersonal forms."
i didn't believe him. "but was it opened, sir? someone might have
gone into my things . . ."

touching my knee lightly and quickly removing his hand as i shifted my
position.
"what i want to do is done very seldom, and, to be honest, it
wouldn't happen now if i hadn't sustained a series of impossible frustrations.
you see -- well, i'm thwarted . . . oh, damn, there i go again, thinking only
of myself . . . we're both frustrated, understand? both of us, and i want to
help you . . ."
"you mean you'll let me see mr. emerson?"
he frowned. "please don't seem so happy about it, and don't leap to
conclusions. i want to help, but there is a tyranny involved . . ."
"a tyranny?" my lungs tightened.
"yes. that's a way of putting it. because to help you i must
disillusion you . . ."
"oh, i don't think i mind, sir. once i see mr. emerson, it'll be up to
me. all i want to do is speak to him."
"speak to him," he said, getting quickly to his feet and mashing his
cigarette into the tray with shaking fingers. "no one speaks to h

his whole manner had changed.
"but you said . . ." i stood up, completely confused. was he having
fun with me? "couldn't you let me talk to him for just five minutes?" i
pleaded. "i'm sure i can convince him that i'm worthy of a job. and if
there's someone who has tampered with my letter, i'll prove my identity . . .

mind you. do you wish to do what's best for yourself?"
"why, yes, sir. i suppose i do . . ."
"then forget about returning to the college. go somewhere else . . ."
"you mean leave?"
"yes, forget it . . ."
"but you said that you would help me!"
"i did and i am --"
"but what about seeing mr. emerson?"
"oh, god! don't you see that it's best that you do not see him?"
suddenly i could not breathe. then i was standing, gripping my brief
case. "what have you got against me?" i blurted. "what did i ever do to
you? you never intended to let me see him. even though i presented my
letter of introduction. why? why? i'd never endanger your job --"
"no, no, no! of course not," he cried, getting to his feet. "you've

trying to get me to leave college. what kind of man are you, anyway? what
have you got against me? you, a northern white man!"
he looked pained. "i've done it badly," he said, "but you must
believe that i am trying to advise you what is best for you." he snatched off
his glasses.

he bit his lips and shut his eyes, shaking his head from side to side
as though fighting back a scream. "i'm sorry, really sorry that i started all of
this," he said, suddenly calm. "it was foolish of me to try to advise you, but
please, you mustn't believe that i'm against you . . . or your race. i'm your

"your father!"
"my father, yes, though i would have preferred it otherwise. but he
is, and i could arrange for you to see him. but to be utterly frank, i'm
incapable of such cynicism. it would do you no good."
"but i'd like to take my chances, mr. emerson, sir . . . this is very
important to me. my whole career depends upon it."
"but you have no chance," he said.
"but dr. bledsoe sent me here," i said, growing more excited. "i
must have a chance . . ."
"dr. bledsoe," he said with

 distaste. "he's like my . . . he ought to

"go on, read it," he cried excitedly. "go on!"
"but i wasn't asking for this," i said.
"read it!"
my dear mr. emerson:
the bearer of this letter is a former student of ours (i say former
because he shall never, under any circumstances, be enrolled as a student
here again) who has been expelled for a most serious defection from our
strictest rules of deportment.
due, however, to circumstances the nature of which i shall explain to
you in person on the occasion of the next meeting of the board, it is to the
best interests of the college that this young man have no knowledge of the
finality of his expulsion. for

it is indeed his hope to return here to his
classes in the fall. however, it is to the best interests of the great work which
we are dedicated to perform, that he continue undisturbed in these vain
hopes while remaining as far as possible from our midst.
this case represents, my dear mr. emerson, one of the rare, delicate
instances in which one for whom we held great expectations has gone
grievously astray, and who in his fall threatens to upset certain delicate
relationships between certain interested individuals and the school. thus,
while the bearer is no longer a member of our scholastic family, it is highly
important that his severance with the college be executed as painlessly as
possible. i beg of you, sir, to help him continue in the direction of that
promise which, like the ho

e street. the sun was very bright now and the people along the walk
seemed far away. i stopped before a gray wall where high above me the
headstones of a church graveyard arose like the tops of buildings. across the
street in the shade of an awning a shoeshine boy was dancing for pennies. i
went on to the corner and got on a bus and went automatically to the rear.
in the seat in front of me a dark man in a panama hat kept whistling a tune
between his teeth. my mind, flew in circles, to bledsoe, emerson and back
again. there was no sense to be made of it. it was a joke. hell, it couldn't
be a joke. yes, it is a joke . . . suddenly the bus jerked to a stop and i
heard myself humming the same tune that the man ahead was whistling, and
the words came back:
o well they picked poor robin clean
o well they picked poor robin clean
well they tied poor robin to a stump
lawd, they picked all the feathers round from robin's rump
well they picked poor robin clean.
then i was on my feet, hurrying to the do

e done and who
had tied him and why had they plucked him and why had we sung of his
fate? it was for a laugh, for a laugh, all the kids had laughed and laughed,
and the droll tuba player of the old elk's band had rendered it solo on his
helical horn; with comical flourishes and doleful phrasing, "boo boo boo
booooo, poor robin clean" -- a mock funeral dirge . . . but who was robin
and for what had he been hurt and humiliated?
suddenly i lay shaking with anger. it was no good. i thought of
young emerson. what if he'd lied out of some ulterior motive of his own?
everyone seemed to have some plan for me, and beneath that some more
secret plan. what was young emerson's plan -- and why should it have
included me? who was i anyway? i tossed fitfully. perhaps it was a test of
my good will and faith -- but that's a lie, i thought. it's a lie and you know
it's a lie. i had seen the letter and it had practically ordered me killed. by
slow degrees . . .
"my dear mr. emerson," i said aloud. "the robin be

sure, that's the way it was, i thought, a short, concise verbal coup de
grace, straight to the nape of the neck. and emerson would write in reply?
sure: "dear bled, have met robin and shaved tail. signed, emerson."
i sat on the bed and laughed. they'd sent me to the rookery, all
right. i laughed and felt numb and weak, knowing that soon the pain would
come and that no matter what happened to me i'd never be the same. i felt
numb and i was laughing. when i stopped, gasping for breath, i decided that
i would go back and kill bledsoe. yes, i thought, i owe it to the race and to
myself. i'll kill him.
and the boldness of the idea and the anger behind it made me move
with decision. i had to have a job and i

took what i hoped was the quickest
means. i called the plant young emerson had mentioned, and it worked. i
was told to report the following morning. it happened so quickly and with
such ease that for a moment i felt turned around. had they planned it this
way? but no, they wouldn't catch me again. this time i had made the move.
i could hardly get to sleep for dreaming of revenge.

the plant was in long island, and i crossed a bridge in the fog to
get there and came down in a stream of workers. ahead of me a huge
electric sign announced its message through th

flags were fluttering in the breeze from each of a maze of buildings
below the sign, and for a moment it was like watching some vast patriotic
ceremony from a distance. but no shots were fired and no bugles sounded. i
hurried ahead with the others through the fog.
i was worried, since i had used emerson's name without his
permission, but when i found my way to the personnel office it worked like
magic. i was interviewed by a little droopy-eyed man named mr. macduffy
and sent to work for a mr. kimbro. an office boy came along to direct me.
"if kimbro needs him," macduffy told the boy, "come back and have
his name entered on the shipping department's payroll."
"it's tremendous," i said as we left the building. "it looks like a small
city."
"it's big all right," he said. "we're one of the biggest

we entered one of the buildings now and started down a pure white
hall.
"you better leave your things in the locker room," he said, opening a
door through which i saw a room with low wooden benches and rows of
green lockers. there were keys in several of the locks, and he selected one
for me. "put your stuff in there and take the key," he said. dressing, i felt
nervous. he sprawled with one foot on a bench, watching me closely as he
chewed on a match stem. did he suspect that emerson hadn't sent me?
"they have a new racket around here," he said, twirling the match
between his finger and thumb. there was a note of insinuation in his voice,
and i looked up from tying my shoe, breathing with conscious evenness.
"what kind of racket?" i said.
"oh, you know. the wise guys firing the regular guys and putting on
you colored college boys. pretty smart," he said. "that way they don't have to
pay union wages."
"how did you know i went to college?" i said.
"oh, there're about six of y

 and i laughed. "they picked poor robin clean," i said.
"do you happen to know bled?"
he looked at me, his head to one side. "are these people friends of
yours?"
"friends? oh, yes," i said, "we're all good friends. buddies from way
back. but i don't suppose we get around in the same circles."
his eyes widened. "no," he said, "i don't suppose we do. however,
good friends are valuable to have."
i felt light-headed and started to laugh and he seemed to waver
again and i thought of asking him about emerson, but now he was clearing
his throat and indicating that he was finished.
i put the folded papers in my overalls and started out. the door
beyond the rows of chairs seemed far away.
"take care of yourself," he said.
"and you," i said, thinking, it's time, it's past time.
turning abruptly, i went weakly back to the desk, seeing him looking
up at me with his steady scientific gaze. i was overcome with ceremonial
feelings but unable to remember the proper formula. so as i deliberately

mary's silent pressure i throbbed with guilt and puzzlement. i wanted peace
and quiet, tranquillity, but was too much aboil inside. somewhere beneath the
load of the emotion-freezing ice which my life had conditioned my brain to
produce, a spot of black anger glowed and threw off a hot red light of such
intensity that had lord kelvin known of its existence, he would have had to
revise his measurements. a remote explosion had occurred somewhere,
perhaps back at emerson's or that night in bledsoe's office, and it had caused
the ice cap to melt and shift the slightest bit. but that bit, that fraction, was
irrevocable. coming to new york had perhaps been an unconscious attempt to
keep the old freezing unit going, but it hadn't worked; hot water had gotten
into its coils. only a drop, perhaps, but that drop was the first wave of the
deluge. one moment i believed, i was dedicated, willing to lie on the blazing

i stopped and dropped to a bench. i should leave, i thought. that
would be the honest thing to do. otherwise i could only tell them to have
hope and try to hold on to those who'd listen. was that also what rinehart
was, a principle of hope for which they gladly paid? otherwise there was
nothing but betrayal, and that meant going back to serve bledsoe, and
emerson, jumping from the pot of absurdity to the fire of the ridiculous. and
either was a self-betrayal. but i couldn't leave; i had to settle with jack and
tobitt. i owed it to clifton and tarp and the others. i had to hold on ... and
then i had an idea that shook me profoundly: you don't have to worry about
the people. if they tolerate rinehart, then they will forget it and even with
them you are invisible. it lasted only the fraction of a second and i rejected
it immediately; still it had flashed a

that color made no difference, when in reality it made no difference because
they didn't see either color or men . . . for all they were concerned, we were
so many names scribbled on fake ballots, to be used at their convenience and
when not needed to be filed away. it was a joke, an absurd joke. and now i
looked around a corner of my mind and saw jack and norton and emerson
merge into one single white figure. they were very much the same, each
attempting to force his picture of reality upon me and neither giving a hoot
in hell for how things looked to me. i was simply a material, a natural
resource to be used. i had switched from the arrogant absurdity of norton
and emerson to that of jack and the brotherhood, and it all came out the
same -- except i now recognized my invisibility.
so i'd accept it, i'd explore it, rine and heart. i'd plunge into it with

i looked at ras on his horse and at their handful of guns and
recognized the absurdity of the whole night and of the simple yet
confoundingly complex arrangement of hope and desire, fear and hate, that
had brought me here still running, and knowing now who i was and where i
was and knowing too that i had no longer to run for or from the jacks and
the emersons and the bledsoes and nortons, but only from their confusion,
impatience, and refusal to recognize the beautiful absurdity of their american
identity and mine. i stood there, knowing that by dying, that by being hanged
by ras on this street in this destructive night i would perhaps move them
one fraction of a bloody step closer to a definition of who they were and of
what i was and had been. but the definition would have been too narrow; i
was invisible, and hanging would not bring me to visibi

eyes. it was a state neither of dreaming nor of waking, but somewhere in
between, in which i was caught like trueblood's jaybird that yellow jackets
had paralyzed in every part but his eyes.
but somehow the floor had now turned to sand and the darkness to
light, and i lay the prisoner of a group consisting of jack and old emerson
and bledsoe and norton and ras and the school superintendent and a
number of others whom i failed to recognize, but all of whom had run me,
who now pressed around me as i lay beside a river of black water, near
where an armored bridge arched sharply away to where i could not see. and
i was protesting their holding me and they were demanding that i return to
them and were annoyed with my refusal.
"no," i said. "i'm through with all your illusions and lies, i'm
through running."
