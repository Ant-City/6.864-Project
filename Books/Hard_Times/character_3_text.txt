his pride in having at any time of his life achieved such a great social
distinction as to be a nuisance, an incumbrance, and a pest, was only to
be satisfied by three sonorous repetitions of the boast.

â€˜i was to pull through it, i suppose, mrs. gradgrind.  whether i was to
do it or not, maâ€™am, i did it.  i pulled through it, though nobody threw
me out a rope.  vagabond, errand-boy, vagabond, labourer, porter, clerk,
chief manager, small partner, josiah bounderby of coketown.  those are
the antecedents, and the culmination.  josiah bounderby of coketown
learnt his letters from the outsides of the shops, mrs. gradgrind, and
was first able to tell the time upon a dial-plate, from studying the
steeple clock of st. gilesâ€™s church, london, under the direction of a
drunken cripple, who was a convicted thief, and an incorrigible vagrant.

of schools; and josiah bounderby of coketown, tells you plainly, all
right, all correctâ€”he hadnâ€™t such advantagesâ€”but let us have hard-headed,
solid-fisted peopleâ€”the education that made him wonâ€™t do for everybody,
he knows wellâ€”such and such his education was, however, and you may force
him to swallow boiling fat, but you shall never force him to suppress the
facts of his life.â€™

being heated when he arrived at this climax, josiah bounderby of coketown
stopped.  he stopped just as his eminently practical friend, still
accompanied by the two young culprits, entered the room.  his eminently
practical friend, on seeing him, stopped also, and gave louisa a
reproachful look that plainly said, â€˜behold your bounderby!â€™

â€˜well!â€™ blustered mr. bounderby, â€˜whatâ€™s the matter?  what is young
thomas in the dumps about?â€™

he spoke of young thomas, but he looked at louisa.

â€˜we were peeping at the circus,â€™ muttered louisa, haug

rformances, which foolish poets have ascribed to them at such times;
neither did the clocks go any faster, or any slower, than at other
seasons.  the deadly statistical recorder in the gradgrind observatory
knocked every second on the head as it was born, and buried it with his
accustomed regularity.

so the day came, as all other days come to people who will only stick to
reason; and when it came, there were married in the church of the florid
wooden legsâ€”that popular order of architectureâ€”josiah bounderby esquire
of coketown, to louisa eldest daughter of thomas gradgrind esquire of
stone lodge, m.p. for that borough.  and when they were united in holy
matrimony, they went home to breakfast at stone lodge aforesaid.

there was an improving party assembled on the auspicious occasion, who
knew what everything they had to eat and drink was made of, and how it
was imported or exported, and in what quantities, and in what bottoms,
whether native or foreign, and all about it.  the bridesmaids, down to

little jane gradgrind, were, in an intellectual point of view, fit
helpmates for the calculating boy; and there was no nonsense about any of
the company.

after breakfast, the bridegroom addressed them in the following terms:

â€˜ladies and gentlemen, i am josiah bounderby of coketown.  since you have
done my wife and myself the honour of drinking our healths and happiness,
i suppose i must acknowledge the same; though, as you all know me, and
know what i am, and what my extraction was, you wonâ€™t expect a speech
from a man who, when he sees a post, says â€œthatâ€™s a post,â€ and when he
sees a pump, says â€œthatâ€™s a pump,â€ and is not to be got to call a post a
pump, or a pump a post, or either of them a toothpick.  if you want a
speech this morning, my fri

ct fellows, and said, â€˜if you want to bring in,
for any place, a handsome dog who can make you a devilish good speech,
look after my brother jem, for heâ€™s your man.â€™  after a few dashes in the
public meeting way, mr. gradgrind and a council of political sages
approved of jem, and it was resolved to send him down to coketown, to
become known there and in the neighbourhood.  hence the letter jem had
last night shown to mrs. sparsit, which mr. bounderby now held in his
hand; superscribed, â€˜josiah bounderby, esquire, banker, coketown.
specially to introduce james harthouse, esquire.  thomas gradgrind.â€™

within an hour of the receipt of this dispatch and mr. james harthouseâ€™s
card, mr. bounderby put on his hat and went down to the hotel.  there he
found mr. james harthouse looking out of window, in a state of mind so
disconsolate, that he was already half-disposed to â€˜go inâ€™ for something
else.

â€˜my name, sir,â€™ said his visitor, â€˜is josiah bounderby, of coketown.â€™

learn, mr. harthouse could never be recommended.

â€˜come!â€™ said his host.  â€˜if youâ€™re in the complimentary line, youâ€™ll get
on here, for youâ€™ll meet with no competition.  i have never been in the
way of learning compliments myself, and i donâ€™t profess to understand the
art of paying â€™em.  in fact, despise â€™em.  but, your bringing-up was
different from mine; mine was a real thing, by george!  youâ€™re a
gentleman, and i donâ€™t pretend to be one.  i am josiah bounderby of
coketown, and thatâ€™s enough for me.  however, though i am not influenced
by manners and station, loo bounderby may be.  she hadnâ€™t my
advantagesâ€”disadvantages you would call â€™em, but i call â€™em advantagesâ€”so
youâ€™ll not waste your power, i dare say.â€™

â€˜mr. bounderby,â€™ said jem, turning with a smile to louisa, â€˜is a noble
animal in a comparatively natural state, quite free from the harness in
which a conventional hack like myself works.â€™

â€˜you respect mr. bounderby ve

â€˜iâ€™d leefer not coom to â€™t, sir; but sin you put thâ€™ questionâ€”anâ€™ not

â€˜not to me, you know,â€™ said bounderby.  (gusty weather with deceitful
calms.  one now prevailing.)

â€˜o no, sir.  not to yo.â€™

â€˜as for me, any consideration for me has had just nothing at all to do
with it,â€™ said bounderby, still in confidence with the wall.  â€˜if only
josiah bounderby of coketown had been in question, you would have joined
and made no bones about it?â€™

â€˜why yes, sir.  â€™tis true.â€™

â€˜though he knows,â€™ said mr. bounderby, now blowing a gale, â€˜that there
are a set of rascals and rebels whom transportation is too good for!
now, mr. harthouse, you have been knocking about in the world some time.
did you ever meet with anything like that man out of this blessed
country?â€™  and mr. bounderby pointed him out for inspection, with an
angry finger.

ility to grow cabbages in
the flower-garden.  he delighted to live, barrack-fashion, among the
elegant furniture, and he bullied the very pictures with his origin.
â€˜why, sir,â€™ he would say to a visitor, â€˜i am told that nickits,â€™ the late
owner, â€˜gave seven hundred pound for that seabeach.  now, to be plain
with you, if i ever, in the whole course of my life, take seven looks at
it, at a hundred pound a look, it will be as much as i shall do.  no, by
george!  i donâ€™t forget that i am josiah bounderby of coketown.  for
years upon years, the only pictures in my possession, or that i could
have got into my possession, by any means, unless i stole â€™em, were the
engravings of a man shaving himself in a boot, on the blacking bottles
that i was overjoyed to use in cleaning boots with, and that i sold when
they were empty for a farthing a-piece, and glad to get it!â€™

then he would address mr. harthouse in the same style.

â€˜harthouse, you have a couple of horses down here.  bring half a dozen

 wanted to keep a dozen horsesâ€”which i donâ€™t, for oneâ€™s enough
for meâ€”i couldnâ€™t bear to see â€™em in their stalls here, and think what my
own lodging used to be.  i couldnâ€™t look at â€™em, sir, and not order â€™em
out.  yet so things come round.  you see this place; you know what sort
of a place it is; you are aware that thereâ€™s not a completer place of its
size in this kingdom or elsewhereâ€”i donâ€™t care whereâ€”and here, got into
the middle of it, like a maggot into a nut, is josiah bounderby.  while
nickits (as a man came into my office, and told me yesterday), nickits,
who used to act in latin, in the westminster school plays, with the
chief-justices and nobility of this country applauding him till they were
black in the face, is drivelling at this minuteâ€”drivelling, sir!â€”in a
fifth floor, up a narrow dark back street in antwerp.â€™

it was among the leafy shadows of this retirement, in the long sultry
summer days, that mr. harthouse began to prove the face which had set him

â€˜he has been helping the police,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜and stays behind at
the bank.  i wish these fellows had tried to rob me when i was at his
time of life.  they would have been out of pocket if they had invested
eighteenpence in the job; i can tell â€™em that.â€™

â€˜is anybody suspected?â€™

â€˜suspected?  i should think there was somebody suspected.  egod!â€™ said
bounderby, relinquishing mrs. sparsitâ€™s arm to wipe his heated head.
â€˜josiah bounderby of coketown is not to be plundered and nobody
suspected.  no, thank you!â€™

might mr. harthouse inquire who was suspected?

â€˜well,â€™ said bounderby, stopping and facing about to confront them all,
â€˜iâ€™ll tell you.  itâ€™s not to be mentioned everywhere; itâ€™s not to be
mentioned anywhere: in order that the scoundrels concerned (thereâ€™s a
gang of â€™em) may be thrown off their guard.  so take this in confidence.

straightforward man, i believe.  i donâ€™t go beating about for

â€˜i suppose no one ever had occasion to think you too diffident, or too
delicate,â€™ louisa answered him composedly: â€˜i have never made that
objection to you, either as a child or as a woman.  i donâ€™t understand
what you would have.â€™

â€˜have?â€™ returned mr. bounderby.  â€˜nothing.  otherwise, donâ€™t you, loo
bounderby, know thoroughly well that i, josiah bounderby of coketown,
would have it?â€™

she looked at him, as he struck the table and made the teacups ring, with
a proud colour in her face that was a new change, mr. harthouse thought.
â€˜you are incomprehensible this morning,â€™ said louisa.  â€˜pray take no
further trouble to explain yourself.  i am not curious to know your
meaning.  what does it matter?â€™

nothing more was said on this theme, and mr. harthouse was soon idly gay
on indifferent subjects.  but from this day, the sparsit action upon

on for everything you doâ€”have
you received intelligence respecting the robbery?â€™

â€˜why, maâ€™am, no; not yet.  under the circumstances, i didnâ€™t expect it
yet.  rome wasnâ€™t built in a day, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜very true, sir,â€™ said mrs. sparsit, shaking her head.

â€˜nor yet in a week, maâ€™am.â€™

â€˜no, indeed, sir,â€™ returned mrs. sparsit, with a gentle melancholy upon
her.

â€˜in a similar manner, maâ€™am,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜i can wait, you know.  if
romulus and remus could wait, josiah bounderby can wait.  they were
better off in their youth than i was, however.  they had a she-wolf for a
nurse; i had only a she-wolf for a grandmother.  she didnâ€™t give any
milk, maâ€™am; she gave bruises.  she was a regular alderney at that.â€™

â€˜ah!â€™ mrs. sparsit sighed and shuddered.

â€˜no, maâ€™am,â€™ continued bounderby, â€˜i have not heard anything more about
it.  itâ€™s in hand, though; and young tom, who rather sticks to business
at presentâ€”something new for him; he hadnâ€™t the schooli

mediately crammed her into a coach, and bore her off to stone
lodge.

â€˜now, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby, bursting into his father-in-lawâ€™s
room late at night; â€˜hereâ€™s a lady hereâ€”mrs. sparsitâ€”you know mrs.
sparsitâ€”who has something to say to you that will strike you dumb.â€™

â€˜you have missed my letter!â€™ exclaimed mr. gradgrind, surprised by the
apparition.

â€˜missed your letter, sir!â€™ bawled bounderby.  â€˜the present time is no
time for letters.  no man shall talk to josiah bounderby of coketown
about letters, with his mind in the state itâ€™s in now.â€™

â€˜bounderby,â€™ said mr. gradgrind, in a tone of temperate remonstrance, â€˜i
speak of a very special letter i have written to you, in reference to
louisa.â€™

â€˜tom gradgrind,â€™ replied bounderby, knocking the flat of his hand several
times with great vehemence on the table, â€˜i speak of a very special
messenger that has come to me, in reference to louisa.  mrs. sparsit,
maâ€™am, stand forward!â€™

 mr. bounderby extended his right hand to the weeping lady,
and escorted her to the conveyance in question, shedding many plaintive
sneezes by the way.  he soon returned alone.

â€˜now, as you showed me in your face, tom gradgrind, that you wanted to
speak to me,â€™ he resumed, â€˜here i am.  but, i am not in a very agreeable
state, i tell you plainly: not relishing this business, even as it is,
and not considering that i am at any time as dutifully and submissively
treated by your daughter, as josiah bounderby of coketown ought to be
treated by his wife.  you have your opinion, i dare say; and i have mine,
i know.  if you mean to say anything to me to-night, that goes against
this candid remark, you had better let it alone.â€™

mr. gradgrind, it will be observed, being much softened, mr. bounderby
took particular pains to harden himself at all points.  it was his
amiable nature.

â€˜my dear bounderby,â€™ mr. gradgrind began in reply.

â€˜now, youâ€™ll excuse me,â€™ said bounderby, â€˜but i donâ€™t wa

bounderby and myself.â€™

â€˜i fear there is at present a general incompatibility between louisa,
andâ€”andâ€”and almost all the relations in which i have placed her,â€™ was her
fatherâ€™s sorrowful reply.

â€˜now, look you here, tom gradgrind,â€™ said bounderby the flushed,
confronting him with his legs wide apart, his hands deeper in his
pockets, and his hair like a hayfield wherein his windy anger was
boisterous.  â€˜you have said your say; i am going to say mine.  i am a
coketown man.  i am josiah bounderby of coketown.  i know the bricks of
this town, and i know the works of this town, and i know the chimneys of
this town, and i know the smoke of this town, and i know the hands of
this town.  i know â€™em all pretty well.  theyâ€™re real.  when a man tells
me anything about imaginative qualities, i always tell that man, whoever
he is, that i know what he means.  he means turtle soup and venison, with
a gold spoon, and that he wants to be set up with a coach and six.
thatâ€™s what your daughter wa

shanâ€™t, for it wonâ€™t be worth my while to do it.  as to your
daughter, whom i made loo bounderby, and might have done better by
leaving loo gradgrind, if she donâ€™t come home to-morrow, by twelve
oâ€™clock at noon, i shall understand that she prefers to stay away, and i
shall send her wearing apparel and so forth over here, and youâ€™ll take
charge of her for the future.  what i shall say to people in general, of
the incompatibility that led to my so laying down the law, will be this.
i am josiah bounderby, and i had my bringing-up; sheâ€™s the daughter of
tom gradgrind, and she had her bringing-up; and the two horses wouldnâ€™t
pull together.  i am pretty well known to be rather an uncommon man, i
believe; and most people will understand fast enough that it must be a
woman rather out of the common, also, who, in the long run, would come up
to my mark.â€™

â€˜let me seriously entreat you to reconsider this, bounderby,â€™ urged mr.
gradgrind, â€˜before you commit yourself to such a decision.â€™

â

€˜i always come to a decision,â€™ said bounderby, tossing his hat on: â€˜and
whatever i do, i do at once.  i should be surprised at tom gradgrindâ€™s
addressing such a remark to josiah bounderby of coketown, knowing what he
knows of him, if i could be surprised by anything tom gradgrind did,
after his making himself a party to sentimental humbug.  i have given you
my decision, and i have got no more to say.  good night!â€™

so mr. bounderby went home to his town house to bed.  at five minutes
past twelve oâ€™clock next day, he directed mrs. bounderbyâ€™s property to be
carefully packed up and sent to tom gradgrindâ€™s; advertised his country
retreat for sale by private contract; and re

aim (there is no meaner) to tack himself on to
a pedigree, he cut a most ridiculous figure.  with the people filing off
at the door he held, who he knew would carry what had passed to the whole
town, to be given to the four winds, he could not have looked a bully
more shorn and forlorn, if he had had his ears cropped.  even that
unlucky female, mrs. sparsit, fallen from her pinnacle of exultation into
the slough of despond, was not in so bad a plight as that remarkable man
and self-made humbug, josiah bounderby of coketown.

rachael and sissy, leaving mrs. pegler to occupy a bed at her sonâ€™s for
that night, walked together to the gate of stone lodge and there parted.
mr. gradgrind joined them before they had gone very far, and spoke with
much interest of stephen blackpool; for whom he thought this signal
failure of the suspicions against mrs. pegler was likely to work well.

as to the whelp; throughout this scene as on all other late occasions, he
had stuck close to bounderby.  he seemed to feel tha

 mere crib for two; but did he see more?  did he
catch any glimpse of himself making a show of bitzer to strangers, as the
rising young man, so devoted to his masterâ€™s great merits, who had won
young tomâ€™s place, and had almost captured young tom himself, in the
times when by various rascals he was spirited away?  did he see any faint
reflection of his own image making a vain-glorious will, whereby
five-and-twenty humbugs, past five-and-fifty years of age, each taking
upon himself the name, josiah bounderby of coketown, should for ever dine
in bounderby hall, for ever lodge in bounderby buildings, for ever attend
a bounderby chapel, for ever go to sleep under a bounderby chaplain, for
ever be supported out of a bounderby estate, and for ever nauseate all
healthy stomachs, with a vast amount of bounderby balderdash and bluster?
had he any prescience of the day, five years to come, when josiah
bounderby of coketown was to die of a fit in the coketown street, and
this same precious will was to begin
