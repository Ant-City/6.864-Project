the sitting-room, toward the door.   
     "aren't you ready yet?"   
     "not yet. run along. i'll make it."   
     he went out. the door closed. his feet went down the corridor. then i 
could hear the watch again. i quit moving around and went to the window 
and drew the curtains aside and watched them running for chapel, the 
same ones fighting the same heaving coat-sleeves, the same books and 
flapping collars flushing past like debris on a flood, and spoade. calling 
shreve my husband. ah let him alone, shreve said, if he's got better sense 
than to chase after the little dirty sluts, whose business. in the south you 
are ashamed of being a virgin. boys. men. they lie about it. because it 
means less to women, father said. he said it was men invented virginity 
not women. father said it's like death: only a state in which the others are 
left and i said, but to believe it doesn't matter and he said, that's what's so 
sad about anything: not only v

me and not her who is unvirgin and he said, that's why that's sad too; 

nothing is even worth the changing of it, and shreve said if he's got better 
sense than to chase after the little dirty sluts and i said did you ever have a 
sister? did you? did you?   
     spoade was in the middle of them like a terrapin in a street full of 
scuttering dead leaves, his collar about his ears, moving at his customary 
unhurried walk. he was from south carolina, a senior. it was his club's 
boast that he never ran for chapel and had never got there on time and had 
never been absent in four years and had never made either chapel or first 
lecture with a shirt on his back and socks on his feet. about ten oclock he'd 
come in thompson's, get two cups of coffee, sit down and

cambridge. she had an apartment over in town, and gerald had one there 
too, besides his rooms in college. she approved of gerald associating with 
me because i at least revealed a blundering sense of noblesse oblige by 
getting myself born below mason and dixon, and a few others whose 
geography met the requirements (minimum). forgave, at least. or 
condoned. but since she met spoade coming out of chapel one he said she 
couldn't be a lady no lady would be out at that hour of the night she never 
had been able to forgive him for having five names, including that of a 
present english ducal house. i'm sure she solaced herself by being 
convinced that some misfit maingault or mortemar had got mixed up with 
the lodge-keeper's daughter. which was quite probable, whether she 
invented it or not. spoade was the world's champion sitter-around, no 
holds barred and gouging discret

and the boys somewhere in the rear. the path went along the river to the 
bridge. we crossed it and the tracks, people coming to the doors to look at 
us and more boys materialising from somewhere until when we turned into 
the main street we had quite a procession. before the drug store stood an 
auto, a big one, but i didn't recognise them until mrs bland said,   
     " why, quentin! quentin compson!" then i saw gerald, and spoade in 
the back seat, sitting on the back of his neck. and shreve. i didn't know the 
two girls.   
     "quentin compson!" mrs bland said.   
     " good afternoon," i said, raising my hat. "i'm under arrest. i'm sorry i

pants, like a glove. i didn't remember forgetting them. i didn't remember

in front, too. they watched me through veils, with a kind of delicate horror. 
"who's under arrest?" shreve said. "what's this, mister?"   
     "gerald," mrs bland said. "send these people away. you get in this car, 
quentin."   
      gerald got out. spoade hadn't moved.   
     "what's he done, cap?" he said. "robbed a hen house?"   
     "i warn you," anse said. "do you know the prisoner?"   
     "know him," shreve said. "look here--"   
     "then you can come along to the squire's. you'reobstructing justice. 
come along." he shook my arm.   
     "well, good afternoon," i said. "i'm glad to have seen you all. sorry i 
couldn't be with you."

could hear them telling them what it was, and spoade asking questions, 
and then julio said something violently in italian and i looked back and 
saw the little girl standing at the curb, looking at me with her friendly, 
inscrutable regard.   
     "git on home," julio shouted at her. "i beat hell outa you."   
      we went down the street and turned into a bit of lawn in which, set 
back from the street, stood a one storey building of brick trimmed with 
white. we went up the rock path to the door, where anse halted everyone

      he opened a huge dusty book and drew it to him and dipped a foul pen 
into an inkwell filled with what looked like coal dust.   
     "look here, mister," shreve said.   
     "the prisoner's name," the squire said. i told him. he wrote it slowly 
into the book, the pen scratching with excruciating deliberation.   
     "look here, mister," shreve said. "we know this fellow. we--"   
     "order in the court," anse said.

     "age," the squire said. i told him. he wrote that, his mouth moving as he 
wrote. "occupation." i told him. "harvard student, hey?" he said. he 
looked up at me, bowing his neck a little to see over the spectacles. his eyes 
were clear and cold, like a goat's. "what are you up to, coming out here 
kidnapping children?"   
     "they're crazy, squire," shreve said. "whoever says this boy's

out, anse." they got quiet. the squire looked at shreve, then at spoade, 
then at gerald. "you know this young man?" he said to spoade.   
     "yes, your honor," spoade said. "he's just a country boy in school up 
there. he dont mean any harm. i think the marshal'll find it's a mistake.

along the river path, towards town. some boys swimming told us which

taking up with him like that. he cant help it."   
     "h'm," the squire said. he looked out of the window for a while. we 
watched him. i could hear julio scratching himself. the squire looked 
back.   
     "air you satisfied the gal aint took any hurt, you, there?"   
     "no hurt now," julio said sullenly.   
     "you quit work to hunt for her?"

     "dollar, i calculate."   
      i gave julio a dollar.   
     "well," spoade said. "if that's all--i reckon he's discharged, your 
honor?"   
      the squire didn't look at him. "how far'd you run him, anse?"   
     "two miles, at least. it was about two hours before we caught him."   
     "h'm," the squire said. he mused a while. we watched him, his stiff 
crest, the spectacles riding low on his nose. the yellow shape of the 
window grew slowly across the floor, reached the wall, climbing. dust 
motes whirled and slanted. "six dollars."

      the squire looked at shreve mildly. "case dismissed," he said without

then ceased. spoade was looking at me, his brown eyes quizzical, a little 
cold. "well, bud, i reckon you'll do your girl chasing in boston after this."   
     "you damned fool," shreve said. "what the hell do you mean anyway, 
straggling off here, fooling with these damn wops?"   
     "come on," spoade said. "they must be getting impatient."   
      mrs bland was talking to them. they were miss holmes and miss 
daingerfield and they quit listening to her and looked at me again with that 
delicate and curious horror, their veils turned back upon their little white 
noses and their eyes fleeing and mysterious beneath the veils.

time," spoade said.   
     "nonsense," mrs bland said, but her voice sort of died away and she 
stared at me for a moment, and the girls drew their breaths in with a soft 
concerted sound. "fiddlesticks," mrs bland said briskly. "if that isn't just 
like these ignorant lowclass yankees. get in, quentin."   
      shreve and i sat on two small collapsible seats. gerald cranked the car

"all the time we thought he was the model youth that anybody could trust a 
daughter with, until the police showed him up at his nefarious work."

      our windows were dark. the entrance was empty. i walked close to the 
left wall when i entered, but it was empty: just the stairs curving up into 
shadows echoes of feet in the sad generations like light dust upon the 
shadows, my feet waking them like dust, lightly to settle again.   
      i could see the letter before i turned the light on, propped against a 
book on the table so i would see it.   
      calling him my husband. and then spoade said they were going 
somewhere, would not be back until late, and mrs bland would need 

another cavalier. but i would have seen him and he cannot get another car 
for an hour because after six oclock. i took out my watch and listened to it 
clicking away, not knowing it couldn't even lie. then i laid it face up on the 
table and took mrs bland's letter and tore it across and dropped the pieces 
into the waste basket and took off my coat, vest, collar, tie and shirt. the tie 
was spoiled too,
