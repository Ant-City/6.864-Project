[CHARACTER]
neveu's presence in the novel embodies the chinese idea
of yin and yang, or two complementary forces that work together
in harmony. from langdon and teabing, sophie learns that pagan religions
and the priory valued balance between male and female. sophie and langdon
form the male and female halves of a single protagonist, and their
goals never diverge. in this way, they echo teabing's and langdon's
ideas about the partnership of jesus and mary magdalene. in their
view, the male and the female worked together toward a goal, without
the female being subordinate to the male in any way. 
both sophie and langdon, like the mona lisa,
exhibit male and female traits: for example, langdon's headiness
is balanced by sophie's real world know-how. sophie is quick-witted,
agile, devious when she needs to be, and physically assertive, as
when she helps to disable silas in the chateau. but at the same
time, she is caring and compassionate. she feels the loss of her
family deeply and mourns the death of her grandfather. both brilliant
and sexually attractive, sophie combines a masculine toughness with
typically feminine qualities.
