[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER])  - 
king of mycenae and leader of the achaean army; brother
of king menelaus of sparta. arrogant and often selfish, [CHARACTER]provides
the achaeans with strong but sometimes reckless and self-serving
leadership. like achilles, he lacks consideration and forethought.
most saliently, his tactless appropriation of achilles' war prize,
the maiden briseis, creates a crisis for the achaeans, when achilles,
insulted, withdraws from the war.
