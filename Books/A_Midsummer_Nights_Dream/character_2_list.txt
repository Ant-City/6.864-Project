Titania - 
                The
beautiful queen of the fairies, Titania resists the attempts of
her husband, Oberon, to make a knight of the young Indian prince
that she has been given. Titania's brief, potion-induced love for
Nick Bottom, whose head Puck has transformed into that of an ass, yields
the play's foremost example of the contrast motif.
