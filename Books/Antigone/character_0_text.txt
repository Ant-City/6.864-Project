scene 

the same as in oedipus the king, an open space before the royal palace, once that of oedipus, at thebes. the backscene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest is the principal entrance into the house. the time is at daybreak on the

 morning after the fall of the two brothers, eteocles and polyneices, and the flight of the defeated argives. antigone calls ismene forth from the palace, in order to speak to her alone.

antigone
ismene, sister, mine own dear sister, knowest thou what ill there is, of all bequeathed by oedipus, that zeus fulfils not for us twain while we live? nothing painful is there, nothing fraught with ruin, no shame, no dishonour, that i have not seen in thy woes and mine. 

and now what new edict is this of which they tell, that our captain hath just published to all thebes? knowest thou aught? hast thou heard? or is it hidden from thee that our friends are threatened with the doom of our foes?

no word of friends, antigone, gladsome or painful, hath come to me, since we two sisters were bereft of brothers twain, killed in one day by twofold blow; and since in this last night the argive host hath fled, know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or more grievous.

antigone
i knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee beyond the gates of the court, that thou mightest hear alone.

ismene
what is it? 'tis plain that thou art brooding on some dark tidings.

antigone
what, hath not creon destined our brothers, the one to honoured burial, the other to unburied shame? eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his honour among the dead below. but the hapless corpse of polyneices-as rumour saith, it hath been published to the town that none shall entomb him or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for the birds, as they espy him, to feast on at will. 

such, 'tis said, is the edict that the good

 creon hath set forth for thee and for me,-yes, for me,-and is coming hither to proclaim it clearly to those who know it not; nor counts the matter light, but, whoso disobeys in aught, his doom is death by stoning before all the folk. thou knowest it now; and thou wilt soon show whether thou art nobly bred, or the base daughter of a noble line.

ismene
poor sister,-and if things stand thus, what could i help to do or undo?

antigone
consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.

ismene
in what venture? what can be thy meaning?

antigone
wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead?

ismene
thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to thebes?

antigone
i will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a brother. false to him will i never be found.

ismene
ah, over-bold! when creon hath forbidden?

antigone
nay, he hath no right to keep me from mine own.

ismene
ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, amid hate and

we two left all alone think how we shall perish, more miserably than all the rest, if, in defiance of the law, we brave a king's decree or his powers. nay, we must remember, first, that we were born women, as who should not strive with men; next, that we are ruled of the stronger, so that we must obey in these things, and in things yet sorer. i, therefore, asking the spirits infernal to pardon, seeing that force is put on me herein, will hearken to our rulers. for 'tis witless to be over busy.

antigone
i will not urge thee,-no nor, if thou yet shouldst have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me. nay, be what thou wilt; but i will bury him: well for me to die in doing that. i shall rest, a loved one with him whom i have loved, sinless in my crime; for i owe a longer allegiance to the dead than to the living: in that world i shall abide for ever. but if thou wilt, be guilty of dishonouring laws which the gods have stablished in honour.

ismene
i do them no dishonour; but to defy

 the state,-i have no strength for that.

antigone
such be thy plea:-i, then, will go to heap the earth above the brother whom i love.

ismene
alas, unhappy one! how i fear for thee!

antigone
fear not for me: guide thine own fate aright.

ismene:
at least, then, disclose this plan to none, but hide it closely,-and so, too, will i.

antigone
oh, denounce it! thou wilt be far more hateful for thy silence, if thou proclaim not these things to all.

ismene
thou hast a hot heart for chilling deeds.

antigone
i know that i please where i am most bound to please.

ismene
aye, if thou canst; but thou wouldst what thou canst not.

antigone
why, then, when my strength fails, i shall have done.

ismene
a hopeless quest should not be made at all.

antigone
if thus thou speakest, thou wilt have hatred from me, and will justly be subject to the

 lasting hatred of the dead. but leave me, and the folly that is mine alone, to suffer this dread thing; for i shall not suffer aught so dreadful as an ignoble death.

ismene
go, then, if thou must; and of this be sure,-that though thine errand is foolish, to thy dear ones thou art truly dear.
exit antigone on the spectators' left. ismene retires into the palace by one of the two side-doors. when they have departed, the chorus of theban elders enters.

cunning beyond fancy's dream is the fertile skill which brings him, now to evil, now to good. when he honours the laws of the land, and that justice which he hath sworn by the gods to uphold, proudly stands his city: no city hath he who, for his rashness, dwells with sin. never may he share my hearth, never think my thoughts, who doth these things!

leader of the chorus
what portent from the gods is this?-my soul is amazed. i know her-how can i deny that yon maiden is antigone? 

o hapless, and child of hapless sire,-of oedipus! what means this? thou brought a prisoner?-thou, disloyal to the king's laws, and taken in folly?

guard
here she is, the doer of the deed:-caught this girl burying him:-but where is creon?
creon enters hurriedly from the palace.

lo, he comes forth again from the house, at our need.

 she crowned the dead. 

we rushed forward when we saw it, and at once dosed upon our quarry, who was in no wise dismayed. then we taxed her with her past and present doings; and she stood not on denial of aught,-at once to my joy and to my pain. to have escaped from ills one's self is a great joy; but 'tis painful to bring friends to ill. howbeit, all such things are of less account to me than mine own safety.

creon
thou-thou whose face is bent to earth-dost thou avow, or disavow, this deed?

antigone
i avow it; i make no denial.

thou canst betake thee whither thou wilt, free and clear of a grave charge.

to antigone
now, tell me thou-not in many words, but briefly-knewest thou that an edict had forbidden this?

antigone
i knew it: could i help it? it was public.

and thou didst indeed dare to transgress that law?

yes; for it was not zeus that had published me that edict; not such are the laws set among men by the justice who dwells with the gods bel

and summon her-for i saw her e'en now within,-raving, and not mistress of her wits. so oft, before the deed, the mind stands self-convicted in its treason, when folks are plotting mischief in the dark. but verily this, too, is hateful,-when one who hath been caught in wickednes then seeks to make the crime a glory.

antigone
wouldst thou do more than take and slay me?

creon
no more, indeed; having that, i have all.

antigone
why then dost thou delay? in thy discourse there is nought that pleases me,-never may there be!-and so my words must needs be unpleasing to thee. and yet, for glory-whence could i have won a nobler, than by giving burial to mine own brother? all here would own that they thought it well, were not their lips sealed by fear. but royalty, blest in so much besides, hath the power to do and say what

 it will.

creon
thou differest from all these thebans in that view.

antigone
these also share it; but they curb their tongues for thee.

creon
and art thou not ashamed to act apart from them?

antigone
no; there is nothing shameful in piety to a brother.

creon
was it not a brother, too, that died in the opposite cause?

antigone
brother by the same mother and the same sire.

creon
why, then, dost thou render a grace that is impious in his sight?

antigone
the dead man will not say that he so deems it.

creon
yea, if thou makest him but equal in honour with the wicked.

antigone
it was his brother, not his slave, that perished.

creon
wasting this land; while he fell as its champion.

antigone
nevertheless, hades desires these rites.

creon
but the good desires not a like portion with the evil.

antigone
who knows but this seems blameless in the world below?

creon
a foe is never a friend-not even in death.

as fond sisters weep; a cloud upon her brow casts its shadow over her darkly-flushing face, and breaks in rain on her fair cheek.

creon
and thou, who, lurking like a viper in my house, wast secretly draining my life-blood, while i knew not that i was nurturing two pests, to rise against my throne-come, tell me now, wilt thou also confess thy part in this burial, or wilt thou forswear all knowledge of it?

ismene
i have done the deed,-if she allows my claim,-and share the burden of the charge.

antigone
nay, justice will not suffer thee to do that: thou didst not consent to the deed, nor did i give thee part in it.

ismene
but, now that ills beset thee, i am not ashamed to sail the sea of trouble at thy side.

antigone
whose was the deed, hades and the dead are witnesses: a friend in words is not the friend that i love.

ismene
nay, sister, reject me not, but let me die with thee, and duly honour the dead.

antigone
share not thou my death, nor claim deeds to which thou hast not put thy hand:

my death will suffice.

ismene
and what life is dear to me, bereft of thee?

antigone
ask creon; all thy care is for him.

ismene
why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought?

antigone
indeed, if i mock, 'tis with pain that i mock thee.

ismene
tell me,-how can i serve thee, even now?

antigone
save thyself: i grudge not thy escape.

ismene
ah, woe is me! and shall i have no share in thy fate?

antigone
thy choice was to live; mine, to die.

ismene
at least thy choice was not made without my protest.

antigone
one world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.

ismene
howbeit, the offence is the same for both of us.

antigone
be of good cheer; thou livest; but my life hath long been given to death, that so i might serve the dead.

but wilt thou slay the betrothed of thine own son?

creon
nay, there are other fields for him to plough.

ismene
but there can never be such love as bound him to her.

creon
i like not an evil wife for my son.

enough, enough of thee and of thy marriage!

blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. for when a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is driven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of thracian sea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and there is sullen roar from wind-vexed headlands that front the blows of the storm.
