chapter i

in which the reader is introduced to a man of humanity


late in the afternoon of a chilly day in february, two gentlemen were
sitting alone over their wine, in a well-furnished dining parlor, in
the town of p----, in kentucky. there were no servants present, and the
gentlemen, with chairs closely approaching, seemed to be discussing some
subject with great earnestness.

for convenience sake, we have said, hitherto, two _gentlemen_. one of
the parties, however,

_you_.â€

â€œo, pray yourself, george, and go trusting in him; then you wonâ€™t do
anything wicked.â€

â€œwell, now, _good-by_,â€ said george, holding elizaâ€™s hands, and gazing
into her eyes, without moving. they stood silent; then there were last
words, and sobs, and bitter weeping,--such parting as those may make
whose hope to meet again is as the spiderâ€™s web,--and the husband and
wife were parted.



chapter iv

an evening in uncle tomâ€™s cabin


the cabin of uncle tom was a small log building, close adjoining to â€œthe
house,â€ as the negro _par excellence_ designates his masterâ€™s dwelling.
in front it had a neat garden-patch, where, every summer, strawberries,
raspberries, and a variety of fruits and vegetables, flourished under
careful tending. the whole front of it was covered by a large
scarlet bignonia and a native multiflora rose, which, entwisting and
interlacing, left scarce a vestige of the rough logs to be seen

 were busy in
superintending the first walking operations of the baby, which, as
is usually the case, consisted in getting up on its feet, balancing a
moment, and then tumbling down,--each successive failure being violently
cheered, as something decidedly clever.

a table, somewhat rheumatic in its limbs, was drawn out in front of
the fire, and covered with a cloth, displaying cups and saucers of a
decidedly brilliant pattern, with other symptoms of an approaching meal.
at this table was seated uncle tom, mr. shelbyâ€™s best hand, who, as he
is to be the hero of our story, we must daguerreotype for our readers.
he was a large, broad-chested, powerfully-made man, of a full glossy
black, and a face whose truly african features were characterized by an
expression of grave and steady good sense, united with much kindliness
and benevolence. there was something about his whole air self-respecting
and dignified, yet united with a confiding and humble simplicity.

he was very busily intent at this mome

nt on a slate lying before him,
on which he was carefully and slowly endeavoring to accomplish a copy
of some letters, in which operation he was overlooked by young masâ€™r
george, a smart, bright boy of thirteen, who appeared fully to realize
the dignity of his position as instructor.

â€œnot that way, uncle tom,--not that way,â€ said he, briskly, as uncle
tom laboriously brought up the tail of his _g_ the wrong side out; â€œthat
makes a _q_, you see.â€

â€œla sakes, now, does it?â€ said uncle tom, looking with a respectful,
admiring air, as his young teacher flourishingly scrawled _q_â€™s and
_g_â€™s innumerable for his edification; and then, taking the pencil in
his big, heavy fingers, he patiently recommenced.

â€œhow easy white folks alâ€™us does things!â€ said aunt chloe, pausing
while she was greasing a griddle with a scrap of bacon on her fork, and
regarding young master george with pride. â€œthe way he can write, now!
and read, too! and then to come out here evenings and read hi

n a kick, in
a kind of general way, under the table, when the movement became too
obstreperous. â€œcanâ€™t ye be decent when white folks comes to see ye?
stop dat ar, now, will ye? better mind yerselves, or iâ€™ll take ye down a
button-hole lower, when masâ€™r george is gone!â€

what meaning was couched under this terrible threat, it is difficult to
say; but certain it is that its awful indistinctness seemed to produce
very little impression on the young sinners addressed.

â€œla, now!â€ said uncle tom, â€œthey are so full of tickle all the while,
they canâ€™t behave theirselves.â€

here the boys emerged from under the table, and, with hands and faces
well plastered with molasses, began a vigorous kissing of the baby.

â€œget along wid ye!â€ said the mother, pushing away their woolly heads.
â€œyeâ€™ll all stick together, and never get clar, if ye do dat fashion.
go long to de spring and wash yerselves!â€ she said, seconding her
exhortations by a slap, which resounded very formidably, but w

decisively, giving a push to the rude machine.

aunt chloe, having thus saved appearances, seemed highly delighted to
push the thing under, saying, as she did so, â€œwell, mebbe â€˜t will do â€˜em
some good.â€

the house now resolved itself into a committee of the whole, to consider
the accommodations and arrangements for the meeting.

â€œwhat weâ€™s to do for cheers, now, _i_ declar i donâ€™t know,â€ said aunt
chloe. as the meeting had been held at uncle tomâ€™s weekly, for an
indefinite length of time, without any more â€œcheers,â€ there seemed some
encouragement to hope that a way would be discovered at present.

â€œold uncle peter sung both de legs out of dat oldest cheer, last week,â€
 suggested mose.

â€œyou go long! iâ€™ll bounâ€™ you pulled â€˜em out; some oâ€™ your shines,â€ said
aunt chloe.

â€œwell, itâ€™ll stand, if it only keeps jam up agin de wall!â€ said mose.

 â€œjest think on â€˜t!â€ â€œis all that a cominâ€™ sure enough?â€

george, who was a bright boy, and well trained in religious things by
his mother, finding himself an object of general admiration, threw
in expositions of his own, from time to time, with a commendable
seriousness and gravity, for which he was admired by the young and
blessed by the old; and it was agreed, on all hands, that â€œa minister
couldnâ€™t lay it off better than he did; that â€˜t was reely â€˜mazinâ€™!â€

uncle tom was a sort of patriarch in religious matters, in the
neighborhood. having, naturally, an organization in which the
_morale_ was strongly predominant, together with a greater breadth and
cultivation of mind than obtained among his companions, he was looked up
to with great respect, as a sort of minister among them; and the simple,
hearty, sincere style of his exhortations might have edified even better
educated persons. but it was in prayer that he especially excelled.

 hers, instantly, wagging his
tail, prepared to follow her, though apparently revolving much, in this
simple dogâ€™s head, what such an indiscreet midnight promenade might
mean. some dim ideas of imprudence or impropriety in the measure seemed
to embarrass him considerably; for he often stopped, as eliza glided
forward, and looked wistfully, first at her and then at the house, and
then, as if reassured by reflection, he pattered along after her again.
a few minutes brought them to the window of uncle tomâ€™s cottage, and
eliza stopping, tapped lightly on the window-pane.

the prayer-meeting at uncle tomâ€™s had, in the order of hymn-singing,
been protracted to a very late hour; and, as uncle tom had indulged
himself in a few lengthy solos afterwards, the consequence was, that,
although it was now between twelve and one oâ€™clock, he and his worthy
helpmeet were not yet asleep.

â€œgood lord! whatâ€™s that?â€ said aunt chloe, starting up and hastily
drawing the curtain. â€œmy sakes alive, if it

and suiting the action to the word, the door flew open, and the light
of the tallow candle, which tom had hastily lighted, fell on the haggard
face and dark, wild eyes of the fugitive.

â€œlord bless you!--iâ€™m skeered to look at ye, lizy! are ye tuck sick, or
whatâ€™s come over ye?â€

â€œiâ€™m running away--uncle tom and aunt chloe--carrying off my
child--master sold him!â€

â€œsold him?â€ echoed both, lifting up their hands in dismay.

â€œyes, sold him!â€ said eliza, firmly; â€œi crept into the closet by
mistressâ€™ door tonight, and i heard master tell missis that he had sold
my harry, and you, uncle tom, both, to a trader; and that he was going
off this morning on his horse, and that the man was to take possession
today.â€

tom had stood, during this speech, with his hands raised, and his eyes

chapter vii

the motherâ€™s struggle


it is impossible to conceive of a human creature more wholly desolate
and forlorn than eliza, when she turned her footsteps from uncle tomâ€™s
cabin.

her husbandâ€™s suffering and dangers, and the danger of her child, all
blended in her mind, with a confused and stunning sense of the risk she
was running, in leaving the only home she had ever known, and cutting
loose from the protection of a friend whom she loved and revered. then
there was the parting from every familiar object,--the place where she
had grown up, the trees under which she had played, the groves where
she had walked many an evening in happier days, by the side of

aunt chloe, who was much revered in the kitchen, was listened to with
open mouth; and, the dinner being now fairly sent in, the whole kitchen
was at leisure to gossip with her, and to listen to her remarks.

â€œsichâ€™ll be burnt up forever, and no mistake; wonâ€™t ther?â€ said andy.

â€œiâ€™d be glad to see it, iâ€™ll be bounâ€™,â€ said little jake.

â€œchilâ€™en!â€ said a voice, that made them all start. it was uncle tom, who
had come in, and stood listening to the conversation at the door.

â€œchilâ€™en!â€ he said, â€œiâ€™m afeard you donâ€™t know what yeâ€™re sayinâ€™.
forever is a _dreâ€™ful_ word, chilâ€™en; itâ€™s awful to think on â€˜t. you
oughtenter wish that ar to any human crittur.â€

â€œwe wouldnâ€™t to anybody but the soul-drivers,â€ said andy; â€œnobody can
help wishing it to them, they â€˜s so awful wicked.â€

john equipped himself, and, with a lantern in hand, was soon seen
guiding the senatorâ€™s carriage towards a road that ran down in a hollow,
back of his dwelling. when they parted, the senator put into his hand a
ten-dollar bill.

â€œitâ€™s for her,â€ he said, briefly.

â€œay, ay,â€ said john, with equal conciseness.

they shook hands, and parted.



chapter x

the property is carried off


the february morning looked gray and drizzling through the window of
uncle tomâ€™s cabin. it looked on downcast faces, the images of mournful
hearts. the little table stood out before the fire, covered with an
ironing-cloth; a coarse but clean shirt or two, fresh from the iron,
hung on the back of a chair by the fire, and aunt chloe had another
spread out before her on the table. carefully she rubbed and ironed
every fold and every hem, with the most scrupulous exactness, every now
and then raising her hand to her face to wipe off the tears that were
coursing down her che

whoâ€™ll ever mend for ye?â€ and aunt chloe, again overcome, laid her head
on the box side, and sobbed. â€œto think on â€˜t! no crittur to do for ye,
sick or well! i donâ€™t railly think i ought ter be good now!â€

the boys, having eaten everything there was on the breakfast-table,
began now to take some thought of the case; and, seeing their mother
crying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put
their hands to their eyes. uncle tom had the baby on his knee, and was
letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his face
and pulling his hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous
explosions of delight, evidently arising out of her own internal
reflections.

â€œay, crow away, poor crittur!â€ said aunt chloe; â€œyeâ€™ll have to come to
it, too! yeâ€™ll live to see yer husband sold, or mebbe be sold yerself;
and these yer boys, theyâ€™s to be sold, i sâ€™pose, too, jest like as

â€œno you wonâ€™t, masâ€™r george; and you must not talk so loud. it wonâ€™t
help me any, to anger him.â€

â€œwell, i wonâ€™t, then, for your sake; but only to think of it--isnâ€™t it
a shame? they never sent for me, nor sent me any word, and, if it hadnâ€™t
been for tom lincon, i shouldnâ€™t have heard it. i tell you, i blew â€˜em
up well, all of â€˜em, at home!â€

â€œthat ar wasnâ€™t right, iâ€™m â€˜feard, masâ€™r george.â€

â€œcanâ€™t help it! i say itâ€™s a shame! look here, uncle tom,â€ said he,
turning his back to the shop, and speaking in a mysterious tone, _â€œiâ€™ve
brought you my dollar!â€_

â€œo! i couldnâ€™t think oâ€™ takinâ€™ on â€˜t, masâ€™r george, no ways in the
world!â€ said tom, quite moved.

â€œbut you _shall_ take it!â€ said george; â€œlook here--i told aunt chloe
iâ€™d do it, and she advised me just to make a hole in it, and put a
string through, so you could hang it round your neck, and keep it out of
sight; else this mean scamp would take it away. i t

€™t do _me_ any good.â€

â€œwell, i wonâ€™t, for your sake,â€ said george, busily tying his dollar
round tomâ€™s neck; â€œbut there, now, button your coat tight over it, and
keep it, and remember, every time you see it, that iâ€™ll come down after
you, and bring you back. aunt chloe and i have been talking about it. i
told her not to fear; iâ€™ll see to it, and iâ€™ll tease fatherâ€™s life out,
if he donâ€™t do it.â€

â€œo! masâ€™r george, ye mustnâ€™t talk so â€˜bout yer father!â€

â€œlor, uncle tom, i donâ€™t mean anything bad.â€

â€œand now, masâ€™r george,â€ said tom, â€œye must be a good boy; â€˜member how

â€œyes, i will, uncle tom,â€ said george seriously.

â€œand be careful of yer speaking, masâ€™r george. young boys, when they
comes to your age, is wilful, sometimes--it is natur they should be.
but real gentlemen, such as i hopes youâ€™ll be, never lets fall on words
that isnâ€™t â€˜spectful to thar parents. ye anâ€™t â€˜fended, masâ€™r george?â€

â€œno, indeed, uncle tom; you always did give me good advice.â€

â€œiâ€™s older, ye know,â€ said tom, stroking the boyâ€™s fine, curly head with
his large, strong hand, but speaking in a voice as tender as a womanâ€™s,
â€œand i sees all thatâ€™s bound up in you. o, masâ€™r george, you has
everything,--lâ€™arninâ€™, privileges, readinâ€™, writinâ€™,--and youâ€™ll grow

be a _first-rater_; and donâ€™t you be discouraged. iâ€™ll have you back to
the place, yet. as i told aunt chloe this morning, iâ€™ll build our house
all over, and you shall have a room for a parlor with a carpet on it,
when iâ€™m a man. o, youâ€™ll have good times yet!â€

haley now came to the door, with the handcuffs in his hands.

â€œlook here, now, mister,â€ said george, with an air of great superiority,
as he got out, â€œi shall let father a

â€œso long as your grand folks wants to buy men and women, iâ€™m as good

â€œiâ€™ll never do either, when iâ€™m a man,â€ said george; â€œiâ€™m ashamed, this
day, that iâ€™m a kentuckian. i always was proud of it before;â€ and george
sat very straight on his horse, and looked round with an air, as if he
expected the state would be impressed with his opinion.

â€œwell, good-by, uncle tom; keep a stiff upper lip,â€ said george.

â€œgood-by, masâ€™r george,â€ said tom, looking fondly and admiringly at him.
â€œgod almighty bless you! ah! kentucky hanâ€™t got many like you!â€ he said,
in the fulness of his heart, as the frank, boyish face was lost to his
view. away he went, and tom looked, till the clatter of his horseâ€™s
heels died away, the last sound or sight of his home. but over his heart
there seemed to be a warm spot, where those young hands had placed that

 or package near tom, while busy in the little
arts afore-named, and take from him, with a kind of grave bashfulness,
the little articles he offered. but at last they got on quite
confidential terms.

â€œwhatâ€™s little missyâ€™s name?â€ said tom, at last, when he thought matters
were ripe to push such an inquiry.

â€œevangeline st. clare,â€ said the little one, â€œthough papa and everybody
else call me eva. now, whatâ€™s your name?â€

â€œmy nameâ€™s tom; the little chilâ€™en used to call me uncle tom, way back
thar in kentuck.â€

â€œthen i mean to call you uncle tom, because, you see, i like you,â€ said
eva. â€œso, uncle tom, where are you going?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know, miss eva.â€

â€œdonâ€™t know?â€ said eva.

â€œno, i am going to be sold to somebody. i donâ€™t know who.â€

â€œmy papa can buy you,â€ said eva, quickly; â€œand if he buys you, you will
have good times. i mean to ask him, this very day.â€

â€œthank you, my little lady,â€ said tom.

ent acquired by masâ€™r georgeâ€™s instructions, he
conceived the bold idea of writing a letter; and he was busy now, on his
slate, getting out his first draft. tom was in a good deal of trouble,
for the forms of some of the letters he had forgotten entirely; and of
what he did remember, he did not know exactly which to use. and while he
was working, and breathing very hard, in his earnestness, eva alighted,
like a bird, on the round of his chair behind him, and peeped over his
shoulder.

â€œo, uncle tom! what funny things you _are_ making, there!â€

â€œiâ€™m trying to write to my poor old woman, miss eva, and my little
chilâ€™en,â€ said tom, drawing the back of his hand over his eyes; â€œbut,
some how, iâ€™m feard i shanâ€™t make it out.â€

â€œi wish i could help you, tom! iâ€™ve learnt to write some. last year i
could make all the letters, but iâ€™m afraid iâ€™ve forgotten.â€

so eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave
and anxious discussion, each one equally e

the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite
like writing.

delightedly on it. â€œhow pleased your wifeâ€™ll be, and the poor little
children! o, itâ€™s a shame you ever had to go away from them! i mean to
ask papa to let you go back, some time.â€

â€œmissis said that she would send down money for me, as soon as they

kentuck


our readers may not be unwilling to glance back, for a brief interval,
at uncle tomâ€™s cabin, on the kentucky farm, and see what has been
transpiring among those whom he had left behind.

it was late in the summer afternoon, and the doors and windows of the
large parlor all stood open, to invite any stray breeze, that might feel
in a good humor, to enter. mr. shelby sat in a large hall opening
into the room, and running through the whole length of the house, to
a balcony on either end. leisurely tipped back on one chair, with his
heels in another, he was enjoying his after-di

â€œwhew!â€ said george, â€œhereâ€™s a stroke of business, to be sure! how are
you going?â€

â€œtomorrow, wid sam. and now, masâ€™r george, i knows youâ€™ll jis sit down
and write to my old man, and tell him all about it,--wonâ€™t ye?â€

â€œto be sure,â€ said george; â€œuncle tomâ€™ll be right glad to hear from us.
iâ€™ll go right in the house, for paper and ink; and then, you know, aunt
chloe, i can tell about the new colts and all.â€

â€œsartin, sartin, masâ€™r george; you go â€˜long, and iâ€™ll get ye up a bit oâ€™

e and tenderness; and to humor her graceful fancies,
and meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like
a many-colored rainbow, was tomâ€™s chief delight. in the market, at
morning, his eyes were always on the flower-stalls for rare bouquets
for her, and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to
give to her when he came back; and the sight that pleased him most was
her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach, and her
childish questions,--â€œwell, uncle tom, what have you got for me today?â€

nor was eva less zealous in kind offices, in return. though a child, she
was a beautiful reader;--a fine musical ear, a quick poetic fancy, and
an instinctive sympathy with whatâ€™s grand and noble, made her such a
reader of the bible as tom had never before heard. at first, she read to
please her humble friend; but soon her own earnest nature threw out its
tendrils, and wound itself around the majestic book; and eva loved it,
because it woke in her strange

â€œwhat, miss eva?â€

â€œdonâ€™t you see,--there?â€ said the child, pointing to the glassy water,
which, as it rose and fell, reflected the golden glow of the sky.
â€œthereâ€™s a â€˜sea of glass, mingled with fire.â€™â€

â€œtrue enough, miss eva,â€ said tom; and tom sang--

     â€œo, had i the wings of the morning,
     iâ€™d fly away to canaanâ€™s shore;
     bright angels should convey me home,
     to the new jerusalem.â€

â€œwhere do you suppose new jerusalem is, uncle tom?â€ said eva.

â€œo, up in the clouds, miss eva.â€

â€œthen i think i see it,â€ said eva. â€œlook in those clouds!--they look
like great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them--far, far
off--itâ€™s all gold. tom, sing about â€˜spirits bright.â€™â€

tom sung the words of a well-known methodist hymn,

     â€œi see a band of spirits bright,
     that taste the glories there;
     they all are robed in spotless white,
     and conquering palms they bear.â€

â€œuncle tom, iâ€™ve seen _them

tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least.
if eva had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it
entirely probable.

â€œthey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;â€ and evaâ€™s eyes
grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice,

     â€œthey are all robed in spotless white,
     and conquering palms they bear.â€

â€œuncle tom,â€ said eva, â€œiâ€™m going there.â€

â€œwhere, miss eva?â€

the child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of
evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly
radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies.

â€œiâ€™m going _there_,â€ she said, â€œto the spirits bright, tom; _iâ€™m going,
before long_.â€

the faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and tom thought how often
he had noticed, within six months, that evaâ€™s little hands had gr

matter, cousin?--you look sober.â€

â€œhow could you be so cruel and wicked to poor dodo?â€ asked eva.

â€œcruel,--wicked!â€ said the boy, with unaffected surprise. â€œwhat do you
mean, dear eva?â€

â€œi donâ€™t want you to call me dear eva, when you do so,â€ said eva.

â€œdear cousin, you donâ€™t know dodo; itâ€™s the only way to manage him,
heâ€™s so full of lies and excuses. the only way is to put him down at
once,--not let him open his mouth; thatâ€™s the way papa manages.â€

â€œbut uncle tom said it was an accident, and he never tells what isnâ€™t
true.â€

fast as he can speak.â€

â€œyou frighten him into deceiving, if you treat him so.â€

â€œwhy, eva, youâ€™ve really taken such a fancy to dodo, that i shall be
jealous.â€

â€œbut you beat him,--and he didnâ€™t deserve it.â€

â€œo, well, it may go for some time when he does, and donâ€™t get it. a few
cuts never come amiss with dodo,--heâ€™s a regular

ond, faithful servants, to whom she was as
daylight and sunshine. children do not usually generalize; but eva was
an uncommonly mature child, and the things that she had witnessed of the
evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by
one, into the depths of her thoughtful, pondering heart. she had vague
longings to do something for them,--to bless and save not only them,
but all in their condition,--longings that contrasted sadly with the
feebleness of her little frame.

â€œuncle tom,â€ she said, one day, when she was reading to her friend, â€œi
can understand why jesus _wanted_ to die for us.â€

â€œwhy, miss eva?â€

â€œbecause iâ€™ve felt so, too.â€

â€œwhat is it miss eva?--i donâ€™t understand.â€

â€œi canâ€™t tell you; but, when i saw those poor creatures on the boat,
you know, when you came up and i,--some had lost their mothers, and some
their husbands, and some mothers cried for their little children--and
when i heard about poor prue,--oh, wasnâ€™t that dreadful

sobbed,--while the
beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some
bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.

â€œpoor topsy!â€ said eva, â€œdonâ€™t you know that jesus loves all alike? he
is just as willing to love you, as me. he loves you just as i do,--only
more, because he is better. he will help you to be good; and you can go
to heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you
were white. only think of it, topsy!--_you_ can be one of those spirits
bright, uncle tom sings about.â€

â€œo, dear miss eva, dear miss eva!â€ said the child; â€œi will try, i will
try; i never did care nothinâ€™ about it before.â€

st. clare, at this instant, dropped the curtain. â€œit puts me in mind of
mother,â€ he said to miss ophelia. â€œit is true what she told me; if we
want to give sight to the blind, we must be willing to do as christ
did,--call them to us, and _put our hands on them_.â€

â€œiâ€™ve always had a prejudice against negroes,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œand

her hands what seemed
to them a last mark of her love. they fell on their knees; they sobbed,
and prayed, and kissed the hem of her garment; and the elder ones poured
forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings, after the
manner of their susceptible race.

as each one took their gift, miss ophelia, who was apprehensive for the
effect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one
to pass out of the apartment.

at last, all were gone but tom and mammy.

â€œhere, uncle tom,â€ said eva, â€œis a beautiful one for you. o, i am so
happy, uncle tom, to think i shall see you in heaven,--for iâ€™m sure i
shall; and mammy,--dear, good, kind mammy!â€ she said, fondly throwing
her arms round her old nurse,--â€œi know youâ€™ll be there, too.â€

â€œo, miss eva, donâ€™t see how i can live without ye, no how!â€ said the
faithful creature. â€œâ€˜pears like itâ€™s just taking everything off the
place to oncet!â€ and mammy gave way to a passion of grief.

tice in every art which could promote neatness
and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of
sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled
head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and
direction of the doctors,--she was everything to him. they who had
shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses, so
unlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now
she was the exact person that was wanted.

uncle tom was much in evaâ€™s room. the child suffered much from nervous
restlessness, and it was a relief to her to be carried; and it was tomâ€™s
greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms, resting on
a pillow, now up and down her room, now out into the verandah; and when
the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,--and the child felt freshest
in the morning,--he would sometimes walk with her under the orange-trees
in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her

; and we joy in it all the more, because we know
that soon it will all pass away.

the friend who knew most of evaâ€™s own imaginings and foreshadowings was
her faithful bearer, tom. to him she said what she would not disturb her
father by saying. to him she imparted those mysterious intimations which
the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay
forever.

tom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in the
outer verandah, ready to rouse at every call.

â€œuncle tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and
everywhere, like a dog, for?â€ said miss ophelia. â€œi thought you was one
of the orderly sort, that liked to lie in bed in a christian way.â€

â€œi do, miss feely,â€ said tom, mysteriously. â€œi do, but now--â€

â€œwell, what now?â€

â€œwe mustnâ€™t speak loud; masâ€™r st. clare wonâ€™t hear on â€˜t; but miss
feely, you know there must be somebody watchinâ€™ for the bridegroom.â€

â€œwhat do you mean, tom?â€

â€œyou know it says in scr

ipture, â€˜at midnight there was a great cry
made. behold, the bridegroom cometh.â€™ thatâ€™s what iâ€™m spectin now, every
night, miss feely,--and i couldnâ€™t sleep out oâ€™ hearin, no ways.â€

â€œwhy, uncle tom, what makes you think so?â€

â€œmiss eva, she talks to me. the lord, he sends his messenger in the
soul. i must be thar, miss feely; for when that ar blessed child goes
into the kingdom, theyâ€™ll open the door so wide, weâ€™ll all get a look in
at the glory, miss feely.â€

â€œuncle tom, did miss eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight?â€

â€œno; but she telled me, this morning, she was coming nearer,--tharâ€™s
them that tells it to the child, miss feely. itâ€™s the angels,--â€˜itâ€™s
the trumpet sound afore the break oâ€™ day,â€™â€ said tom, quoting from a
favorite hymn.

this dialogue passed between miss ophelia and tom, between ten and
eleven, one evening, after her arrangements had all been made for the
night, when, on going to bolt her outer door, she found tom

overhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and
emmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of
detection; and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul
had yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of
years, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and
prayed.

when george entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart sick.

â€œis it possible,--is it possible?â€ said he, kneeling down by him.
â€œuncle tom, my poor, poor old friend!â€

something in the voice penetrated to the ear of the dying. he moved his
head gently, smiled, and said,

     â€œjesus can make a dying-bed
     feel soft as down pillows are.â€

tears which did honor to his manly heart fell from the young manâ€™s eyes,
as he bent over his poor friend.

â€œo, dear uncle tom! do wake,--do speak once more! look up! hereâ€™s masâ€™r
george,--your own little masâ€™r george. donâ€™t you know me?â€

and cannon, than came from that honest old heart.

on rising, another struck up a methodist hymn, of which the burden was,

     â€œthe year of jubilee is come,--
     return, ye ransomed sinners, home.â€

â€œone thing more,â€ said george, as he stopped the congratulations of the
throng; â€œyou all remember our good old uncle tom?â€

george here gave a short narration of the scene of his death, and of his
loving farewell to all on the place, and added,

â€œit was on his grave, my friends, that i resolved, before god, that i
would never own another slave, while it was possible to free him; that
nobody, through me, should ever run the risk of being parted from home
and friends, and dying on a lonely plantation, as he died. so, when you
rejoice in your freedom, think that you owe it to that good old soul,
and pay it back

concluding remarks


the writer has often been inquired of, by correspondents from different
parts of the country, whether this narrative is a true one; and to these
inquiries she will give one general answer.

the separate incidents that compose the narrative are, to a very
great extent, authentic, occurring, many of them, either under her ow

observation, or that of her personal friends. she or her friends
have observed characters the counterpart of almost all that are here
introduced; and many of the sayings are word for word as heard herself,
or reported to her.

the personal appearance of eliza, the character ascribed to her, are
sketches drawn from life. the incorruptible fidelity, piety and honesty,
of uncle tom, had more than one development, to her personal knowledge.
some of the most deeply tragic and romantic, some of the most terrible
incidents, have also their parallels in reality. the incident of the
motherâ€™s crossing the ohio river on the ice is a well-known fact. the
story of â€œold prue,â€ in the second volume, was an incident that
fell under the personal observation of a brother of the writer, then
collecting-clerk to a large mercantile house, in new orleans. from the
same source was deri
