Visible realm - 
                 Plato
divides existence up into two realms, the visible realm and the
intelligible realm. The visible realm can be grasped with our senses.
It is comprised of the world see around us--the world of sensible
particulars. The objects which comprise the visible realm are not
as real as those which comprise the intelligible realm; in addition,
they are not the proper objects of knowledge (i.e., we cannot "know"
anything about them), but of opinion.
