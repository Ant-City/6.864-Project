ntagenet
which held thee deerely, as his soules redemption,
is by the sterne lord clifford done to death

   war. ten dayes ago, i drown'd these newes in teares.
and now to adde more measure to your woes,
i come to tell you things sith then befalne.
after the bloody fray at wakefield fought,
where your braue father breath'd his latest gaspe,
tydings, as swiftly as the postes could runne,
were brought me of your losse, and his depart.
i then in london, keeper of the king,
muster'd my soldiers, gathered flockes of friends,
marcht toward s[aint]. albons, to intercept the queene,
bearing the king in my behalfe along:
for by my scouts, i was aduertised
that she was comming with a full intent
to dash our late decree in parliament,
touching king henries oath, and your succession:
short tale to make, we at s[aint]. albons met,
our battailes ioyn'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
but whether 'twas the coldnesse of the king,
who look'd full gently on his warlike queene,
that rob

b'd my soldiers of their heated spleene.
or whether 'twas report of her successe,
or more then common feare of cliffords rigour,
who thunders to his captiues, blood and death,
i cannot iudge: but to conclude with truth,
their weapons like to lightning, came and went:
our souldiers like the night-owles lazie flight,
or like a lazie thresher with a flaile,
fell gently downe, as if they strucke their friends.
i cheer'd them vp with iustice of our cause,
with promise of high pay, and great rewards:

 all in vaine, they had no heart to fight,
and we (in them) no hope to win the day,
so that we fled: the king vnto the queene,
lord george, your brother, norfolke, and my selfe,
in haste, post haste, are come to ioyne with you:
for in the marches heere we heard you were,
making another head, to fight againe

   ed. where is the duke of norfolke, gentle warwick?
and when came george from burgundy to england?
  war. some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers,
and for your brother he was lately sent
from your kinde aunt dutchesse of burgundie,
with ayde of souldiers to this needfull warre

   rich. 'twas oddes belike, when valiant warwick fled;
oft haue i heard his praises in pursuite,
but ne're till now, his scandall of retire

   war. nor now my scandall richard, dost thou heare:
for thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine,
can plucke the diadem from faint henries head,
and wring the awefull scepter from his fist,
were he as f

 i would your highnesse would depart the field,
the queene hath best successe when you are absent

   qu. i good my lord, and leaue vs to our fortune

   king. why, that's my fortune too, therefore ile stay

   north. be it with resolution then to fight

   prin. my royall father, cheere these noble lords,
and hearten those that fight in your defence:
vnsheath your sword, good father: cry s[aint]. george.

march. enter edward, warwicke, richard, clarence, norfolke,
mountague, and
soldiers.

  edw. now periur'd henry, wilt thou kneel for grace?
and set thy diadem vpon my head?
or bide the mortall fortune of the field

   qu. go rate thy minions, proud insulting boy,
becomes it thee to be thus bold in termes,
before thy soueraigne, and thy lawfull king?
  ed. i am his king, and he should bow his knee:
i was adopted heire by his consent

   cla. since when, his oath is broke: for as i heare,
you that are king, though he do weare the crowne,
haue caus'd him by new act

ntle ayre?
and what makes robbers bold, but too much lenity?
bootlesse are plaints, and curelesse are my wounds:
no way to flye, no strength to hold out flight:
the foe is mercilesse, and will not pitty:
for at their hands i haue deseru'd no pitty.
the ayre hath got into my deadly wounds,
and much effuse of blood, doth make me faint:
come yorke, and richard, warwicke, and the rest,
i stab'd your fathers bosomes; split my brest.

alarum & retreat. enter edward, warwicke, richard, and
soldiers, montague,
& clarence.

  ed. now breath we lords, good fortune bids vs pause,
and smooth the frownes of war, with peacefull lookes:
some troopes pursue the bloody-minded queene,
that led calme henry, though he were a king,
as doth a saile, fill'd with a fretting gust
command an argosie to stemme the waues.
but thinke you (lords) that clifford fled with them?
  war. no, 'tis impossible he should escape:
(for though before his face i speake the words)
your brother richard markt him
