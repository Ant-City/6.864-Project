e company of congenial spirits, the scapegraces of the valley.

among the permanent inmates of the house were likewise several lovely
damsels, who instead of thrumming pianos and reading novels, like
more enlightened young ladies, substituted for these employments the
manufacture of a fine species of tappa; but for the greater portion of
the time were skipping from house to house, gadding and gossiping with
their acquaintances.

from the rest of these, however, i must except the beauteous nymph
fayaway, who was my peculiar favourite. her free pliant figure was the
very perfection of female grace and beauty. her complexion was a rich
and mantling olive, and when watching the glow upon her cheeks i could
almost swear that beneath the transparent medium there lurked the
blushes of a faint vermilion.

the face of this girl was a rounded oval, and each feature as perfectly
formed as the heart or imagination of man could desire.

her full lips, when parted with a smile, disclosed teeth of dazzling

shows them reposing in rows on each side,
imbedded in the red and juicy pulp. her hair of the deepest brown,
parted irregularly in the middle, flowed in natural ringlets over her
shoulders, and whenever she chanced to stoop, fell over and hid from
view her lovely bosom. gazing into the depths of her strange blue
eyes, when she was in a contemplative mood, they seemed most placid yet
unfathomable; but when illuminated by some lively emotion, they beamed
upon the beholder like stars. the hands of fayaway were as soft and
delicate as those of any countess; for an entire exemption from rude
labour marks the girlhood and even prime of a typee woman’s life. her
feet, though wholly exposed, were as diminutive and fairly shaped as
those which peep from beneath the skirts of a lima lady’s dress. the
skin of this young creature, from continual ablutions and the use of
mollifying ointments, was inconceivably smooth and soft.

i may succeed, perhaps, in particularizing some of the individual
features

 of fayaway’s beauty, but that general loveliness of appearance
which they all contributed to produce i will not attempt to describe.
the easy unstudied graces of a child of nature like this, breathing from
infancy an atmosphere of perpetual summer, and nurtured by the simple
fruits of the earth; enjoying a perfect freedom from care and anxiety,
and removed effectually from all injurious tendencies, strike the eye in
a manner which cannot be pourtrayed. this picture is no fancy sketch; it

were i asked if the beauteous form of fayaway was altogether free from
the hideous blemish of tattooing, i should be constrained to answer that
it was not. but the practitioners of the barbarous art, so remorseless
in their inflictions upon the brawny limbs of the warriors of the tribe,
seem to be conscious that it needs not the resources of their profession
to augment the charms of the maidens of the vale.

the females are very little embellished in this way, and fayaway, and
all the other young girls of her age, were even less so than th

d. three minute dots, no
bigger than pin-heads, decorated each lip, and at a little distance were
not at all discernible. just upon the fall of the shoulder were drawn
two parallel lines half an inch apart, and perhaps three inches in
length, the interval being filled with delicately executed figures.
these narrow bands of tattooing, thus placed, always reminded me of
those stripes of gold lace worn by officers in undress, and which are in
lieu of epaulettes to denote their rank.

thus much was fayaway tattooed. the audacious hand which had gone so far
in its desecrating work stopping short, apparently wanting the heart to
proceed.

but i have omitted to describe the dress worn by this nymph of the
valley.

fayaway--i must avow the fact--for the most part clung to the primitive
and summer garb of eden. but how becoming the costume!

it showed her fine figure to the best possible advantage; and nothing
could have been better adapted to her peculiar style of beauty. on
ordinary occasions she wa

of white tappa, reaching from her waist
to a little below the knees; and when exposed for any length of time to
the sun, she invariably protected herself from its rays by a floating
mantle of--the same material, loosely gathered about the person. her
gala dress will be described hereafter.

as the beauties of our own land delight in bedecking themselves with
fanciful articles of jewellery, suspending them from their ears, hanging
them about their necks, and clasping them around their wrists; so
fayaway and her companions were in the habit of ornamenting themselves
with similar appendages.

flora was their jeweller. sometimes they wore necklaces of small
carnation flowers, strung like rubies upon a fibre of tappa, or
displayed in their ears a single white bud, the stem thrust backward
through the aperture, and showing in front the delicate petals folded
together in a beautiful sphere, and looking like a drop of the purest
pearl. chaplets too, resembling in their arrangement the strawberry

nal worn by an english peeress, and composed of intertwined leaves
and blossoms, often crowned their temples; and bracelets and anklets
of the same tasteful pattern were frequently to be seen. indeed, the
maidens of the island were passionately fond of flowers, and never
wearied of decorating their persons with them; a lovely trait in their
character, and one that ere long will be more fully alluded to.

though in my eyes, at least, fayaway was indisputably the loveliest
female i saw in typee, yet the description i have given of her will in
some measure apply to nearly all the youthful portion of her sex in the
valley. judge ye then, reader, what beautiful creatures they must have
been.

as impossible not to comprehend.

as he continued his harangue, however, kory-kory, in emulation of our
more polished orators, began to launch out rather diffusely into other
branches of his subject, enlarging probably upon the moral reflections
it suggested; and proceeded in such a strain of unintelligible and
stunning gibberish, that he actually gave me the headache for the rest
of the day.

nowing,
too, that so long as i remained in my present condition, it would
be impossible for me to leave the valley, whatever opportunity might
present itself; and apprehensive that ere long we might be exposed to
some caprice on the part of the islanders, i now gave up all hopes
of recovery, and became a prey to the most gloomy thoughts. a deep
dejection fell upon me, which neither the friendly remonstrances of
my companion, the devoted attentions of kory-kory nor all the soothing
influences of fayaway could remove.

one morning as i lay on the mats in the house, plunged in melancholy
reverie, and regardless of everything around me, toby, who had left me
about an hour, returned in haste, and with great glee told me to cheer
up and be of good heart; for he believed, from what was going on among
the natives, that there were boats approaching the bay.

these tidings operated upon me like magic. the hour of our deliverance
was at hand, and starting up, i was soon convinced that something

, and a few decrepit old people, being all
that were left.

towards sunset the islanders in small parties began to return from
the beach, and among them, as they drew near to the house, i sought to
descry the form of my companion. but one after another they passed the
dwelling, and i caught no glimpse of him. supposing, however, that he
would soon appear with some of the members of the household, i quieted
my apprehensions, and waited patiently to see him advancing in company
with the beautiful fayaway. at last, i perceived tinor coming forward,
followed by the girls and young men who usually resided in the house of
marheyo; but with them came not my comrade, and, filled with a thousand
alarms, i eagerly sought to discover the cause of his delay.

my earnest questions appeared to embarrass the natives greatly. all
their accounts were contradictory: one giving me to understand that
toby would be with me in a very short time; another that he did not know
where he was; while a third, violently i

nveighing, against him, assured
me that he had stolen away, and would never come back. it appeared
to me, at the time, that in making these various statements they
endeavoured to conceal from me some terrible disaster, lest the
knowledge of it should overpower me.

fearful lest some fatal calamity had overtaken him, i sought out young
fayaway, and endeavoured to learn from her, if possible, the truth.

this gentle being had early attracted my regard, not only from her
extraordinary beauty, but from the attractive cast of her countenance,
singularly expressive of intelligence and humanity. of all the natives
she alone seemed to appreciate the effect which the peculiarity of the
circumstances in which we were placed had produced upon the minds of my
companion and myself. in addressing me--especially when i lay reclining
upon the mats

ed my situation, as
being removed from my country and friends, and placed beyond the reach
of all relief. indeed, at times i was almost led to believe that her
mind was swayed by gentle impulses hardly to be anticipated from one in
her condition; that she appeared to be conscious there were ties rudely
severed, which had once bound us to our homes; that there were sisters
and brothers anxiously looking forward to our return, who were, perhaps,
never more to behold us.

in this amiable light did fayaway appear in my eyes; and reposing full
confidence in her candour and intelligence, i now had recourse to her,
in the midst of my alarm, with regard to my companion.

my questions evidently distressed her. she looked round from one to
another of the bystanders, as if hardly knowing what answer to give me.
at last, yielding to my importunities, she overcame her scruples, and
gave me to understand that toby had gone away with the boats which had
visited the bay, but had promised to return at the exp

upon my mind. at this place the waters flowed between grassy banks,
planted with enormous bread-fruit trees, whose vast branches interlacing
overhead, formed a leafy canopy; near the stream were several smooth
black rocks. one of these, projecting several feet above the surface
of the water, had upon its summit a shallow cavity, which, filled with
freshly-gathered leaves, formed a delightful couch.

here i often lay for hours, covered with a gauze-like veil of tappa,
while fayaway, seated beside me, and holding in her hand a fan woven
from the leaflets of a young cocoanut bough, brushed aside the insects
that occasionally lighted on my face, and kory-kory, with a view of
chasing away my melancholy, performed a thousand antics in the water
before us.

as my eye wandered along this romantic stream, it would fall upon the
half-immersed figure of a beautiful girl, standing in the transparent
water, and catching in a little net a species of diminutive shell-fish,

engagement? after all, i was much inclined to believe that these
shocking festivals must occur very rarely among the islanders, if,
indeed, they ever take place.

for two or three days the late event was the theme of general comment;
after which the excitement gradually wore away, and the valley resumed
its accustomed tranquility.

returning health and peace of mind gave a new interest to everything
around me. i sought to diversify my time by as many enjoyments as lay
within my reach. bathing in company with troops of girls formed one of
my chief amusements. we sometimes enjoyed the recreation in the waters
of a miniature lake, to which the central stream of the valley expanded.

sence
of the mermaids, the amusement became dull and insipid. one morning
i expressed to my faithful servitor my desire for the return of the
nymphs. the honest fellow looked at me bewildered for a moment, and
then shook his head solemnly, and murmured ‘taboo! taboo!’ giving me to
understand that unless the canoe was removed i could not expect to have
the young ladies back again. but to this procedure i was averse; i not
only wanted the canoe to stay where it was, but i wanted the beauteous
fayaway to get into it, and paddle with me about the lake. this latter
proposition completely horrified kory-kory’s notions of propriety. he
inveighed against it, as something too monstrous to be thought of. it
not only shocked their established notions of propriety, but was at
variance with all their religious ordinances.

however, although the ‘taboo’ was a ticklish thing to meddle with, i
determined to test its capabilities of resisting an attack. i consulted
the chief mehevi, who endeavoured

ailed to convince me: partly, perhaps, because i could not
comprehend a word that he uttered; but chiefly, that for the life of me
i could not understand why a woman would not have as much right to
enter a canoe as a man. at last he became a little more rational, and
intimated that, out of the abundant love he bore me, he would consult
with the priests and see what could be done.

how it was that the priesthood of typee satisfied the affair with their
consciences, i know not; but so it was, and fayaway dispensation from
this portion of the taboo was at length procured. such an event i
believe never before had occurred in the valley; but it was high time
the islanders should be taught a little gallantry, and i trust that the
example i set them may produce beneficial effects. ridiculous, indeed,
that the lovely creatures should be obliged to paddle about in the
water, like so many ducks, while a parcel of great strapping fellows
skimmed over its surface in their canoes.

body-servant brought from the house a calabash of poee-poee, half a
dozen young cocoanuts--stripped of their husks--three pipes, as many
yams, and me on his back a part of the way. something of a load; but
kory-kory was a very strong man for his size, and by no means brittle in
the spine. we had a very pleasant day; my trusty valet plied the paddle
and swept us gently along the margin of the water, beneath the shades
of the overhanging thickets. fayaway and i reclined in the stern of
the canoe, on the very best terms possible with one another; the gentle
nymph occasionally placing her pipe to her lip, and exhaling the mild
fumes of the tobacco, to which her rosy breath added a fresh perfume.
strange as it may seem, there is nothing in which a young and beautiful
female appears to more advantage than in the act of smoking. how
captivating is a peruvian lady, swinging in her gaily-woven hammock of
grass, extended between two orange-trees, and in

but fayaway, holding in her delicately formed olive hand the long yellow
reed of her pipe, with its quaintly carved bowl, and every few moments
languishingly giving forth light wreaths of vapour from her mouth and
nostrils, looked still more engaging.

we floated about thus for several hours, when i looked up to the warm,
glowing, tropical sky, and then down into the transparent depths below;
and when my eye, wandering from the bewitching scenery around, fell upon
the grotesquely-tattooed form of kory-kory

, and finally, encountered the
pensive gaze of fayaway, i thought i had been transported to some fairy
region, so unreal did everything appear.

this lovely piece of water was the coolest spot in all the valley, and i
now made it a place of continual resort during the hottest period of
the day. one side of it lay near the termination of a long gradually
expanding gorge, which mounted to the heights that environed the vale.

and eddied about their summits, and was sometimes driven

down the
steep ravine and swept across the valley, ruffling in its passage the
otherwise tranquil surface of the lake.

one day, after we had been paddling about for some time, i disembarked
kory-kory, and paddled the canoe to the windward side of the lake. as
i turned the canoe, fayaway, who was with me, seemed all at once to be
struck with some happy idea. with a wild exclamation of delight, she
disengaged from her person the ample robe of tappa which was knotted
over her shoulder (for the purpose of shielding her from the sun), and
spreading it out like a sail, stood erect with upraised arms in the head
of the canoe. we american sailors pride ourselves upon our straight,
clean spars, but a prettier little mast than fayaway made was never
shipped aboard of any craft.

in a mo

ment the tappa was distended by the breeze--the long brown
tresses of fayaway streamed in the air--and the canoe glided rapidly
through the water, and shot towards the shore. seated in the stern, i
directed its course with my paddle until it dashed up the soft sloping
bank, and fayaway, with a light spring alighted on the ground; whilst
kory-kory, who had watched our manoeuvres with admiration, now
clapped his hands in transport, and shouted like a madman. many a time
afterwards was this feat repeated.

if the reader has not observed ere this that i was the declared admirer
of miss fayaway, all i can say is that he is little conversant with
affairs of the heart, and i certainly shall not trouble myself to
enlighten him any farther. out of the calico i had brought from the shi

i made a dress for this lovely girl. in it she looked, i must confess,
something like an opera-dancer.

the drapery of the latter damsel generally commences a little above
the elbows, but my island beauty’s began at the waist, and terminated
sufficiently far above the ground to reveal the most bewitching ankle in
the universe.

the day that fayaway first wore this robe was rendered memorable by a
new acquaintance being introduced to me. in the afternoon i was lying
in the house when i heard a great uproar outside; but being by this time
pretty well accustomed to the wild halloos which were almost continually
ringing through the valley, i paid little attention to it, until old
marheyo, under the influence of some strange excitement, rushed into my
presence and communicated the astounding tidings, ‘marnoo pemi!’ which

typees; one tranquil day of ease and happiness follows another in quiet
succession; and with these unsophisicated savages the history of a
day is the history of a life. i will, therefore, as briefly as i can,
describe one of our days in the valley.

to begin with the morning. we were not very early risers--the sun would
be shooting his golden spikes above the happar mountain, ere i threw
aside my tappa robe, and girding my long tunic about my waist, sallied
out with fayaway and kory-kory, and the rest of the household, and bent
my steps towards the stream. here we found congregated all those who
dwelt in our section of the valley; and here we bathed with them. the
fresh morning air and the cool flowing waters put both soul and body in
a glow, and after a half-hour employed in this recreation, we sauntered
back to the house--tinor and marheyo gathering dry sticks by the way
for fire-wood; some of the young men laying the cocoanut trees under
contribution as they pa

ssed beneath them; while kory-kory played his
outlandish pranks for my particular diversion, and fayaway and i, not
arm in arm to be sure, but sometimes hand in hand, strolled along, with
feelings of perfect charity for all the world, and especial good-will
towards each other.

our morning meal was soon prepared. the islanders are somewhat
abstemious at this repast; reserving the more powerful efforts of
their appetite to a later period of the day. for my own part, with the
assistance of my valet, who, as i have before stated, always officiated
as spoon on these occasions, i ate sparingly from one

oanut shells, in order to polish them
by friction with a smooth stone in the water. in truth these innocent
people seemed to be at no loss for something to occupy their time; and
it would be no light task to enumerate all their employments, or rather
pleasures.

my own mornings i spent in a variety of ways. sometimes i rambled about
from house to house, sure of receiving a cordial welcome wherever i
went; or from grove to grove, and from one shady place to another, in
company with kory-kory and fayaway, and a rabble rout of merry young
idlers. sometimes i was too indolent for exercise, and accepting one of
the many invitations i was continually receiving, stretched myself out
on the mats of some hospitable dwelling, and occupied myself pleasantly
either in watching the proceedings of those around me or taking part
in them myself. whenever i chose to do the latter, the delight of the
islanders was boundless; and there was always a throng of competitors
for the honour of instructing me in any p

ppose was provided for my sole gratification.

the ti was a right jovial place. it did my heart, as well as my body,
good to visit it. secure from female intrusion, there was no restraint
upon the hilarity of the warriors, who, like the gentlemen of europe
after the cloth is drawn and the ladies retire, freely indulged their
mirth.

after spending a considerable portion of the afternoon at the ti, i
usually found myself, as the cool of the evening came on, either sailing
on the little lake with fayaway, or bathing in the waters of the
stream with a number of the savages, who, at this hour, always repaired
thither. as the shadows of night approached marheyo’s household were
once more assembled under his roof: tapers were lit, long curious chants
were raised, interminable stories were told (for which one present was
little the wiser), and all sorts of social festivities served to while
away the time.

the young girls very often danced by moonlight in front of their
dwellings. there are a grea

preparations for a grand festival in the valley--strange doings in
the taboo groves--monument of calabashes--gala costume of the typee
damsels--departure for the festival

from the time that my lameness had decreased i had made a daily practice
of visiting mehevi at the ti, who invariably gave me a most cordial
reception. i was always accompanied in these excursions by fayaway
and the ever-present kory-kory. the former, as soon as we reached the
vicinity of the ti--which was rigorously tabooed to the whole female
sex--withdrew to a neighbouring hut, as if her feminine delicacy
‘restricted’ her from approaching a habitation which might be regarded
as a sort of bachelor’s hall.

and in good truth it might well have been so considered. although it
was the permanent residence of several distinguished chiefs, and of
the noble mehevi in particular, it was still at ce

g morning, awaking rather late, i perceived the whole of
marheyo’s family busily engaged in preparing for the festival.

the old warrior himself was arranging in round balls the two grey locks
of hair that were suffered to grow from the crown of his head; his
earrings and spear, both well polished, lay beside him, while the highly
decorative pair of shoes hung suspended from a projecting cane against
the side of the house. the young men were similarly employed; and the
fair damsels, including fayaway, were anointing themselves with ‘aka’,
arranging their long tresses, and performing other matters connected
with the duties of the toilet.

having completed their preparations, the girls now exhibited themselves
in gala costume; the most conspicuous feature of which was a necklace
of beautiful white flowers, with the stems removed, and strung closely
together upon a single fibre of tappa. corresponding ornaments were
inserted in their ears, and woven garlands upon their heads. about their

aist they wore a short tunic of spotless white tappa, and some of them
super-added to this a mantle of the same material, tied in an elaborate
bow upon the left shoulder, and falling about the figure in picturesque
folds.

thus arrayed, i would have matched the charming fayaway against any
beauty in the world.

people may say what they will about the taste evinced by our fashionable
ladies in dress. their jewels, their feathers, their silks, and
their furbelows, would have sunk into utter insignificance beside the
exquisite simplicity of attire adopted by the nymphs of the vale on this
festive occasion. i should like to have seen a gallery of coronation
beauties, at westminster abbey, confronted for a moment by this band of
island girls; their stiffness, formality, an

as the islanders always maintained a discreet reserve with regard to
my own peculiar views on religion, i thought it would be excessively
ill-bred of me to pry into theirs.

but, although my knowledge of the religious faith of the typees was
unavoidably limited, one of their superstitious observances with which i
became acquainted interested me greatly.

in one of the most secluded portions of the valley within a stone’s
cast of fayaway’s lake--for so i christened the scene of our island
yachting--and hard by a growth of palms, which stood ranged in order
along both banks of the stream, waving their green arms as if to do
honour to its passage, was the mausoleum of a deceased, warrior chief.
like all the other edifices of any note, it was raised upon a small
pi-pi of stones, which, being of unusual height, was a conspicuous
object from a distance. a light thatching of bleached palmetto-leaves

seen, with his whole
body fairly reeking with the perfumed oil of the nut, looking as if he
had just emerged from a soap-boiler’s vat, or had undergone the process
of dipping in a tallow-chandlery. to this cause perhaps, united to their
frequent bathing and extreme cleanliness, is ascribable, in a great
measure, the marvellous purity and smoothness of skin exhibited by the
natives in general.

the prevailing tint among the women of the valley was a light olive, and
of this style of complexion fayaway afforded the most beautiful example.
others were still darker; while not a few were of a genuine golden
colour, and some of a swarthy hue.

as agreeing with much previously mentioned in this narrative i may
here observe that mendanna, their discoverer, in his account of the
marquesas, described the natives as wondrously beautiful to behold, and
as nearly resembling the people of southern europe. the first of these
islands seen by mendanna was la madelena, which is not far distant from
nukuheva;

is explanations, directed my attention to
a peculiarity i had frequently remarked among many of the
females;--principally those of a mature age and rather matronly
appearance. this consisted in having the right hand and the left foot
most elaborately tattooed; whilst the rest of the body was wholly free
from the operation of the art, with the exception of the minutely dotted
lips and slight marks on the shoulders, to which i have previously
referred as comprising the sole tattooing exhibited by fayaway, in
common with other young girls of her age. the hand and foot thus
embellished were, according to kory-kory, the distinguishing badge of
wedlock, so far as that social and highly commendable institution is
known among those people. it answers, indeed, the same purpose as the
plain gold ring worn by our fairer spouses.

after kory-kory’s explanation of the subject, i was for some time
studiously respectful in the presence of all females thus distinguished,
and never ventured to indulge in th

habit of devouring fish much in the same way that
a civilized being would eat a radish, and without any more previous
preparation. they eat it raw; scales, bones, gills, and all the inside.
the fish is held by the tail, and the head being introduced into the
mouth, the animal disappears with a rapidity that would at first nearly
lead one to imagine it had been launched bodily down the throat.

raw fish! shall i ever forget my sensations when i first saw my island
beauty devour one. oh, heavens! fayaway, how could you ever have
contracted so vile a habit? however, after the first shock had subsided,
the custom grew less odious in my eyes, and i soon accustomed myself to
the sight. let no one imagine, however, that the lovely fayaway was in
the habit of swallowing great vulgar-looking fishes: oh, no; with her
beautiful small hand she would clasp a delicate, little, golden-hued
love of a fish and eat it as elegantly and as innocently as though it
were a naples biscuit. but alas! it was after all

 a raw fish; and all i
can say is, that fayaway ate it in a more ladylike manner than any other
girl of the valley.

when at rome do as the romans do, i held to be so good a proverb, that
being in typee i made a point of doing as the typees did. thus i
ate poee-poee as they did; i walked about in a garb striking for its
simplicity; and i reposed on a community of couches; besides doing many
other things in conformity with their peculiar habits; but the farthest
i ever went in the way of conformity, was on several occasions to regale

nasal flute. it is somewhat longer than an ordinary fife; is made of
a beautiful scarlet-coloured reed; and has four or five stops, with
a large hole near one end, which latter is held just beneath the left
nostril. the other nostril being closed by a peculiar movement of the
muscles about the nose, the breath is forced into the tube, and produces
a soft dulcet sound which is varied by the fingers running at random
over the stops. this is a favourite recreation with the females and one
in which fayaway greatly excelled. awkward as such an instrument may
appear, it was, in fayaway’s delicate little hands, one of the most
graceful i have ever seen. a young lady, in the act of tormenting a
guitar strung about her neck by a couple of yards of blue ribbon, is not
half so engaging.

uent disclosures

from the time of my casual encounter with karky the artist, my life was
one of absolute wretchedness. not a day passed but i was persecuted by
the solicitations of some of the natives to subject myself to the odious
operation of tattooing. their importunities drove me half wild, for i
felt how easily they might work their will upon me regarding this or
anything else which they took into their heads. still, however, the
behaviour of the islanders towards me was as kind as ever. fayaway was
quite as engaging; kory-kory as devoted; and mehevi the king just as
gracious and condescending as before. but i had now been three months in
their valley, as nearly as i could estimate; i had grown familiar with
the narrow limits to which my wandering had been confined; and i began
bitterly to feel the state of captivity in which i was held. there
was no one with whom i could freely converse; no one to whom i could
communicate my thoughts; no one who could sympathize with my sufferings.

ning, we should take a
stroll to the ti: he positively refused; and when i renewed the request,
he evinced his determination to prevent my going there; and, to divert
my mind from the subject, he offered to accompany me to the stream. we
accordingly went, and bathed. on our coming back to the house, i was
surprised to find that all its inmates had returned, and were lounging
upon the mats as usual, although the drums still sounded from the
groves.

the rest of the day i spent with kory-kory and fayaway, wandering about
a part of the valley situated in an opposite direction from the ti,
and whenever i so much as looked towards that building, although it was
hidden from view by intervening trees, and at the distance of more than
a mile, my attendant would exclaim, ‘taboo, taboo!’

at the various houses where we stopped, i found many of the inhabitants
reclining at their ease, or pursuing some light occupation, as if
nothing unusual were going forward; but amongst them all i did not

em, and that with hope deferred they might
continue to await my return long after my inanimate form had blended
with the dust of the valley--i could not repress a shudder of anguish.

how vividly is impressed upon my mind every minute feature of the scene
which met my view during those long days of suffering and sorrow. at my
request my mats were always spread directly facing the door, opposite
which, and at a little distance, was the hut of boughs that marheyo was
building.

whenever my gentle fayaway and kory-kory, laying themselves down beside
me, would leave me awhile to uninterrupted repose, i took a strange
interest in the slightest movements of the eccentric old warrior. all
alone during the stillness of the tropical mid-day, he would pursue his
quiet work, sitting in the shade and weaving together the leaflets of
his cocoanut branches, or rolling upon his knee the twisted fibres of
bark to form the cords with which he tied together the thatching of
his tiny house. frequently suspendin

d a hundred yards i was again surrounded by the
savages, who were still in all the heat of argument, and appeared every
moment as if they would come to blows. in the midst of this tumult
old marheyo came to my side, and i shall never forget the benevolent
expression of his countenance. he placed his arm upon my shoulder, and
emphatically pronounced the only two english words i had taught him
‘home’ and ‘mother’. i at once understood what he meant, and eagerly
expressed my thanks to him. fayaway and kory-kory were by his side, both
weeping violently; and it was not until the old man had twice repeated
the command that his son could bring himself to obey him, and take me
again upon his back. the one-eyed chief opposed his doing so, but he was
overruled, and, as it seemed to me, by some of his own party.

we proceeded onwards, and never shall i forget the ecstasy i felt when i
first heard the roar of the surf breaking upon the beach. before long
i saw the flashing billows themselves thro

 waist in the surf, endeavoured to pacify
them; but at length fearful that they would do him some fatal violence,
he beckoned to his comrades to pull in at once, and take him into the
boat.

it was at this agonizing moment, when i thought all hope was ended, that
a new contest arose between the two parties who had accompanied me to
the shore; blows were struck, wounds were given, and blood flowed. in
the interest excited by the fray, every one had left me except marheyo,
kory-kory and poor dear fayaway, who clung to me, sobbing indignantly.
i saw that now or never was the moment. clasping my hands together, i
looked imploringly at marheyo, and move towards the now almost deserted
beach. the tears were in the old man’s eyes, but neither he nor
kory-kory attempted to hold me, and i soon reached the kanaka, who had
anxiously watched my movements; the rowers pulled in as near as they
dared to the edge of the surf; i gave one parting embrace to fayaway,
who seemed speechless with sorrow, and the

safe in the boat, and karakoee by my side, who told the rowers at once
to give way. marheyo and kory-kory, and a great many of the women,
followed me into the water, and i was determined, as the only mark of
gratitude i could show, to give them the articles which had been brought
as my ransom. i handed the musket to kory-kory, with a rapid gesture
which was equivalent to a ‘deed of gift’; threw the roll of cotton to
old marheyo, pointing as i did so to poor fayaway, who had retired from
the edge of the water and was sitting down disconsolate on the shingles;
and tumbled the powder-bags out to the nearest young ladies, all of whom
were vastly willing to take them. this distribution did not occupy ten
seconds, and before it was over the boat was under full way; the kanaka
all the while exclaiming loudly against what he considered a useless
throwing away of valuable property.

the natives

i cannot cross the happar country by night. you see how it is;--if you
come along with me, all will be well; if you do not, depend upon it,
neither of you will ever escape.’

‘there is no help for it,’ said toby, at last, with a heavy heart, ‘i
will have to trust you,’ and he came out from the shadow of the little
shrine, and cast a long look up the valley.

‘now keep close to my side,’ said the sailor, ‘and let us be moving
quickly.’ tinor and fayaway here appeared; the kindhearted old woman
embracing toby’s knees, and giving way to a flood of tears; while
fayaway, hardly less moved, spoke some few words of english she had
learned, and held up three fingers before him--in so many days he would
return.

at last jimmy pulled toby out of the crowd, and after calling to a
young typee who was standing by with a young pig in his arms, all three
started for the mountains.

‘i have told them that you are coming back again,’ said the old fellow
