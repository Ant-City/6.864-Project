things happening. while she was looking at the place where it had been,
it suddenly appeared again.

‘by-the-bye, what became of the baby?’ said the cat. ‘i’d nearly
forgotten to ask.’

‘it turned into a pig,’ alice quietly said, just as if it had come back
in a natural way.

‘i thought it would,’ said the cat, and vanished again.

alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it did not
appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in
which the march hare was said to live. ‘i’ve seen hatters before,’ she
said to herself; ‘the march hare will be much the most interesting, and
perhaps as this is may it won’t be raving mad--at least not so mad as
it was in march.’ as she said this, she looked up, and there was the cat
again, sitting on a branch of a tree.

‘did you say pig, or fig?’ said the cat.

‘i said pig,’ replied alice; ‘and i wish you wouldn’t keep appearing and
vanishing so suddenly: you make one quite giddy.’

‘

all right,’ said the cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin, which
remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

‘well! i’ve often seen a cat without a grin,’ thought alice; ‘but a grin
without a cat! it’s the most curious thing i ever saw in my life!’

she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house
of the march hare: she thought it must be the right house, because the
chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur. it
was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself ‘suppose it should be raving mad after all! i almost
wish i’d gone to see the hatter instead!’




chapter vii. a mad tea-party

s a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
march hare and the hatter were having tea at it: a dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. ‘very
uncomfortable for the dormouse,’ thought alice; ‘only, as it’s asleep, i
suppose it doesn’t mind.’

the table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: ‘no room! no room!’ they cried out when they saw alice
coming. ‘there’s plenty of room!’ said

alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table.

‘have some wine,’ the march hare said in an encouraging tone.

alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea.
‘i don’t see any wine,’ she remarked.

‘there isn’t any,’ said the march hare.

‘then it wasn’t very civil of you to offer it,’ said alice angrily.

‘it wasn’t very civil of you to sit down without being invited,’ said
the march hare.

‘i didn’t know it was your table,’ said alice; ‘it’s laid for a great
many more than three.’

‘your hair wants cutting,’ said the hatter. he had been looking at alice
for some time with great curiosity, and this was his first speech.

‘you should learn not to make personal remarks,’ alice said with some
severity; ‘it’s very rude.’

the hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all he said
was, ‘why is a raven like a writing-desk?’

‘come, we shall h

ave some fun now!’ thought alice. ‘i’m glad they’ve
begun asking riddles.--i believe i can guess that,’ she added aloud.

‘do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?’ said the
march hare.

‘exactly so,’ said alice.

‘then you should say what you mean,’ the march hare went on.

‘i do,’ alice hastily replied; ‘at least--at least i mean what i
say--that’s the same thing, you know.’

‘not the same thing a bit!’ said the hatter. ‘you might just as well say
that “i see what i eat” is the same thing as “i eat what i see”!’

‘you might just as well say,’ added the march hare, ‘that “i like what i
get” is the same thing as “i get what i like”!’

‘you might just as well say,’ added the dormouse, who seemed to be
talking i

 she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasn’t much.

the hatter was the first to break the silence. ‘what day of the month
is it?’ he said, turning to alice: he had taken his watch out of his
pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking it every now and then,
and holding it to his ear.

alice considered a little, and then said ‘the fourth.’

‘two days wrong!’ sighed the hatter. ‘i told you butter wouldn’t suit
the works!’ he added looking angrily at the march hare.

‘it was the best butter,’ the march hare meekly replied.

‘yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,’ the hatter grumbled:
‘you shouldn’t have put it in with the bread-knife.’

the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily: then he dipped
it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again: but he could think of
nothing better to say than his first remark, ‘it was the best butter,
you know.’

alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity. ‘what a

 as politely as she could.

‘the dormouse is asleep again,’ said the hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, ‘of course, of course; just what i was going to remark myself.’

‘have you guessed the riddle yet?’ the hatter said, turning to alice
again.

‘no, i give it up,’ alice replied: ‘what’s the answer?’

‘i haven’t the slightest idea,’ said the hatter.

‘nor i,’ said the march hare.

alice sighed wearily. ‘i think you might do something better with the
time,’ she said, ‘than waste it in asking riddles that have no answers.’

‘if you knew time as well as i do,’ said the hatter, ‘you wouldn’t talk
about wasting it. it’s him.’

‘i don’t know what you mean,’ said alice.

‘of course you don’t!’ the hatter said, tossing his head contemptuously.
‘i dare say you never even spoke to time!’

‘perhaps not,’ alice cautiously replied: ‘but i k

now i have to beat time
when i learn music.’

‘ah! that accounts for it,’ said the hatter. ‘he won’t stand beating.
now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he’d do almost anything
you liked with the clock. for instance, suppose it were nine o’clock in
the morning, just time to begin lessons: you’d only have to whisper a
hint to time, and round goes the clock in a twinkling! half-past one,
time for dinner!’

[‘i only wish it was,’ the march hare said to itself in a whisper.)

‘that would be grand, certainly,’ said alice thoughtfully: ‘but then--i
shouldn’t be hungry for it, you know.’

‘not at first, perhaps,’ said the hatter: ‘but you could keep it to
half-past one as long as you liked.’

‘is that the way you manage?’ alice asked.

the hatter shook his head mournfully. ‘not i!’ he replied. ‘we
quarrelled last march--just before he went mad, you know--’ (pointing
with his tea spoon at the march hare,) ‘-

ht idea came into alice’s head. ‘is that the reason so many
tea-things are put out here?’ she asked.

‘yes, that’s it,’ said the hatter with a sigh: ‘it’s always tea-time,
and we’ve no time to wash the things between whiles.’

‘then you keep moving round, i suppose?’ said alice.

‘exactly so,’ said the hatter: ‘as the things get used up.’

‘but what happens when you come to the beginning again?’ alice ventured
to ask.

‘suppose we change the subject,’ the march hare interrupted, yawning.
‘i’m getting tired of this. i vote the young lady tells us a story.’

‘i’m afraid i don’t know one,’ said alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

‘then the dormouse shall!’ they both cried. ‘wake up, dormouse!’ and
they pinched it on both sides at once.

the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. ‘i wasn’t asleep,’ he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: ‘i heard every word you fellows were saying.’

‘tell us a story!’ said the march hare.

‘yes,

questions of eating and drinking.

‘they lived on treacle,’ said the dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

‘they couldn’t have done that, you know,’ alice gently remarked; ‘they’d
have been ill.’

‘so they were,’ said the dormouse; ‘very ill.’

alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: ‘but
why did they live at the bottom of a well?’

‘take some more tea,’ the march hare said to alice, very earnestly.

‘i’ve had nothing yet,’ alice replied in an offended tone, ‘so i can’t
take more.’

‘you mean you can’t take less,’ said the hatter: ‘it’s very easy to take
more than nothing.’

‘nobody asked your opinion,’ said alice.

‘who’s making personal remarks now?’ the hatter asked triumphantly.

alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the dormouse, and
repea

ted her question. ‘why did they live at the bottom of a well?’

the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, ‘it was a treacle-well.’

‘there’s no such thing!’ alice was beginning very angrily, but the
hatter and the march hare went ‘sh! sh!’ and the dormouse sulkily
remarked, ‘if you can’t be civil, you’d better finish the story for
yourself.’

‘no, please go on!’ alice said very humbly; ‘i won’t interrupt again. i
dare say there may be one.’

‘one, indeed!’ said the dormouse indignantly. however, he consented to
go on. ‘and so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--’

‘what did they draw?’ said alice, quite forgetting her promise.

‘treacle,’ said the 
 
 ___________________________
 
dormouse, without considering at all this time.

‘i want a clean cup,’ interrupted the hatter: ‘let’s all move one place
on.’

he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him: the march hare
moved into the dormouse’s place, and alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the march hare. the hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: ‘but i don’t understand. where did they draw the treacle
from?’

‘you can draw water out of a water-well,’ said the hatter; ‘so i should
think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?’

‘but they were in the well,’ alice said to the dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.

‘of course they were’, said the dormouse; ‘--well

 in.’

this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

‘they were learning to draw,’ the dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; ‘and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an m--’

‘why with an m?’ said alice.

‘why not?’ said the march hare.

alice was silent.

the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: ‘--that begins with an m, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you know you say
things are “much of a muchness”--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?’

‘really, now you ask me,’ said alice, very much confused, ‘i don’t
think--’

‘then you shouldn

e that!’

‘call the first witness,’ said the king; and the white rabbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, ‘first witness!’

the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. ‘i beg pardon, your
majesty,’ he began, ‘for bringing these in: but i hadn’t quite finished
my tea when i was sent for.’

‘you ought to have finished,’ said the king. ‘when did you begin?’

the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the dormouse. ‘fourteenth of march, i think it
was,’ he said.

‘fifteenth,’ said the march hare.

‘sixteenth,’ added the dormouse.

‘write that down,’ the king said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

‘take off your hat,’ the king said to the hatter.

‘it isn’t mine,’ said the hatter.

‘stolen!’ the

ur majesty,’ the hatter began, in a trembling voice,
‘--and i hadn’t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter getting so thin--and the twinkling of the tea--’

‘the twinkling of the what?’ said the king.

‘it began with the tea,’ the hatter replied.

‘of course twinkling begins with a t!’ said the king sharply. ‘do you
take me for a dunce? go on!’

‘i’m a poor man,’ the hatter went on, ‘and most things twinkled after
that--only the march hare said--’

‘i didn’t!’ the march hare interrupted in a great hurry.

‘you did!’ said the hatter.

‘i deny it!’ said the march hare.

‘he denies it,’ said the king: ‘leave out that part.’

‘well, at any rate, the dormouse said--’ the hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

‘after that,’ continued the hatter, ‘i cut some more bread-and-butter--’

‘but what did the dormouse say?

 into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
would always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sister’s dream.

the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by--the
frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the duchess’s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the
lizard’s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock
turtle.

so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed hers
