 and pulled a buffalo over me, to wait till my bed was
ready; and what does i do, but get fast asleep.”

“with one ear open, phineas?” said simeon, quietly.

“no; i slept, ears and all, for an hour or two, for i was pretty well
tired; but when i came to myself a little, i found that there were some
men in the room, sitting round a table, drinking and talking; and i
thought, before i made much muster, i’d just see what they were up to,
especially as i heard them say something about the quakers. ‘so,’ says
one, ‘they are up in the quaker settlement, no doubt,’ says he. then i
listened with both ears, and i found that they were talking about this
very party. so i lay and heard them lay off all their plans. this young
man, they said, was to be sent back to kentucky, to his master, who was
going to make an example of him, to keep all niggers from running away;
and his wife two of them were going to run down to new orleans to sell,
on their own account, and they calculated to get

horseback.

“well, now, there’s michael, and stephen and amariah,” exclaimed
phineas, joyfully. “now we _are_ made--as safe as if we’d got there.”

“well, do stop, then,” said eliza, “and do something for that poor man;

 and phineas, who in the course of his hunting and backwoods life had
acquired some rude experience of surgery, kneeled down by the wounded
man, and began a careful examination of his condition.

“no; i reckon ‘tan’t friend,” said phineas. “much marks cares for thee,

having lain three weeks at the quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic
fever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, tom
arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of
slave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements,
where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears,
wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself
quite a name in the land. tom always spoke reverently of the quakers.
“nice people,” he would say; “wanted to convert me, but couldn’t come
it, exactly. but, tell ye what, stranger, they do fix up a sick fellow
first rate,--no mistake. make jist the tallest kind o’ broth and
knicknacks.”

as tom had informed them that their party would be looked for in
sandusky, it was thought prudent to divide them. jim, with his old
mother, was forwarded separately; and a night or two after, george and
eliza, with their child, were driven privately into sandusky, a
