  but faunus came from picus: picus drew
  his birth from saturn, if records be true.
  thus king latinus, in the third degree,
  had saturn author of his family.
  but this old peaceful prince, as heav'n decreed,
  was blest with no male issue to succeed:
  his sons in blooming youth were snatch'd by fate;
  one only daughter heir'd the royal state.
  fir'd with her love, and with ambition led,
  the neighb'ring princes court her nuptial bed.
  among the crowd, but far above the rest,
  young turnus to the beauteous maid address'd.
  turnus, for high descent and graceful mien,
  was first, and favor'd by the latian queen;
  with him she strove to join lavinia's hand,
  but dire portents the purpos'd match withstand.

  deep in the palace, of long growth, there stood
  a laurel's trunk, a venerable wood;
  where rites divine were paid; whose holy hair
  was kept and cut with superstitious care.
  this plant latinus, when his town he wall'd,
  then found, and from the tree laurentum call'd;

  smear'd as she was with black gorgonian blood,
  the fury sprang above the stygian flood;
  and on her wicker wings, sublime thro' night,
  she to the latian palace took her flight:
  there sought the queen's apartment, stood before
  the peaceful threshold, and besieg'd the door.
  restless amata lay, her swelling breast
  fir'd with disdain for turnus dispossess'd,
  and the new nuptials of the trojan guest.
  from her black bloody locks the fury shakes
  her darling plague, the fav'rite of her snakes;
  with her full force she threw the poisonous dart,
  and fix'd it deep within amata's heart,
  that, thus envenom'd, she might kindle rage,
  and sacrifice to strife her house husband's age.

  "a wand'ring prince enjoy lavinia's bed?
  if nature plead not in a parent's heart,
  pity my tears, and pity her desert.
  i know, my dearest lord, the time will come,
  you in vain, reverse your cruel doom;
  the faithless pirate soon will set to sea,
  and bear the royal virgin far away!
  a guest like him, a trojan guest before,
  in shew of friendship sought the spartan shore,
  and ravish'd helen from her husband bore.
  think on a king's inviolable word;
  and think on turnus, her once plighted lord:
  to this false foreigner you give your throne,
  and wrong a friend, a kinsman, and a son.
  resume your ancient care; and, if the god
  your sire, and you, resolve on foreign blood,
  know all are foreign, in a larger sense,
  not born your subjects, or deriv'd from hence.
  then, if the line of turnus you retrace,
  he springs from inachus of argive race."

  but when she saw her reasons idly spent,
  and could not move him from his fix'd intent,
  she flew to rage;

  and with thy winding ivy wreathes her lance."
  like fury seiz'd the rest; the progress known,
  all seek the mountains, and forsake the town:
  all, clad in skins of beasts, the jav'lin bear,
  give to the wanton winds their flowing hair,
  and shrieks and shoutings rend the suff'ring air.
  the queen herself, inspir'd with rage divine,
  shook high above her head a flaming pine;
  then roll'd her haggard eyes around the throng,
  and sung, in turnus' name, the nuptial song:
  "io, ye latian dames! if any here
  hold your unhappy queen, amata, dear;
  if there be here," she said, "who dare maintain
  my right, nor think the name of mother vain;
  unbind your fillets, loose your flowing hair,
  and orgies and nocturnal rites prepare."

  amata's breast the fury thus invades,
  and fires with rage, amid the sylvan shades;
  then, when she found her venom spread so far,
  the royal house embroil'd in civil war,
  rais'd on her dusky wings, she

  by danae, pregnant with almighty gold,
  who fled her father's rage, and, with a train
  of following argives, thro' the stormy main,
  driv'n by the southern blasts, was fated here to reign.
  't was ardua once; now ardea's name it bears;
  once a fair city, now consum'd with years.
  here, in his lofty palace, turnus lay,
  betwixt the confines of the night and day,
  secure in sleep. the fury laid aside
  her looks and limbs, and with new methods tried
  the foulness of th' infernal form to hide.
  propp'd on a staff, she takes a trembling mien:
  her face is furrow'd, and her front obscene;
  deep-dinted wrinkles on her cheek she draws;
  sunk are her eyes, and toothless are her jaws;
  her hoary hair with holy fillets bound,
  her temples with an olive wreath are crown'd.

  the latian king, unless he shall submit,
  own his old promise, and his new forget-
  let him, in arms, the pow'r of turnus prove,
  and learn to fear whom he disdains to love.
  for such is heav'n's command." the youthful prince
  with scorn replied, and made this bold defense:
  "you tell me, mother, what i knew before:
  the phrygian fleet is landed on the shore.
  i neither fear nor will provoke the war;
  my fate is juno's most peculiar care.
  but time has made you dote, and vainly tell
  of arms imagin'd in your lonely cell.

  these haughty words alecto's rage provoke,
  and frighted turnus trembled as she spoke.
  her eyes grow stiffen'd, and with sulphur burn;
  her hideous looks and hellish form return;
  her curling snakes with hissings fill the place,
  and open all the furies of her face:
  then, darting fire from her malignant eyes,
  she cast him backward as he strove to rise,
  and, ling'ring, sought to frame some new replies.
  high on her head she rears two twisted snakes,
  her chains she rattles, and her whip she shakes;

  while turnus urges thus his enterprise,
  the stygian fury to the trojans flies;
  new frauds invents, and takes a steepy stand,
  which overlooks the vale with wide command;
  where fair ascanius and his youthful train,
  with horns and hounds, a hunting match ordain,
  and pitch their toils around the shady plain.

  and, aggravating crimes, augments their fears;
  proclaims his private injuries aloud,
  a solemn promise made, and disavow'd;
  a foreign son is sought, and a mix'd mungril brood.
  then they, whose mothers, frantic with their fear,

  so stood the pious prince, unmov'd, and long
  sustain'd the madness of the noisy throng.
  but, when he found that juno's pow'r prevail'd,
  and all the methods of cool counsel fail'd,
  he calls the gods to witness their offense,
  disclaims the war, asserts his innocence.
  "hurried by fate," he cries, "and borne before
  a furious wind, we have the faithful shore.
  o more than madmen! you yourselves shall bear
  the guilt of blood and sacrilegious war:
  thou, turnus, shalt atone it by thy fate,
  and pray to heav'n for peace, but pray too late.
  for me, my stormy voyage at an end,
  i to the port of death securely tend.
  the fun'ral pomp which to your kings you pay,
  is all i want, and all you take away."
  he said no more, but, in his walls confin'd,
  shut out the woes which he too well divin'd
  nor with the rising storm would vainly strive,
  but left the helm, and let the vessel drive.

  and those who live by sidicinian shores,
  and where with shoaly fords vulturnus roars,

  and rough saticulans, inur'd to wants:

  hunting their sport, and plund'ring was their trade.
  in arms they plow'd, to battle still prepar'd:
  their soil was barren, and their hearts were hard.

  but vain were marsian herbs, and magic art,
  to cure the wound giv'n by the dardan dart:

  the trojan, floating in a flood of care,
  beholds the tempest which his foes prepare.
  this way and that he turns his anxious mind;

  while these affairs in distant places pass'd,

  thus having said, as by the brook he stood,
  he scoop'd the water from the crystal flood;
  then with his hands the drops to heav'n he throws,
  and loads the pow'rs above with offer'd vows.

  now march the bold confed'rates thro' the plain,
  well hors'd, well clad; a rich and shining train.
  messapus leads the van; and, in the rear,
  the sons of tyrrheus in bright arms appear.
  in the main battle, with his flaming crest,
  the mighty turnus tow'rs above the rest.
  silent they move, majestically slow,
  like ebbing nile, or ganges in his flow.
  the trojans view the dusty cloud from far,
  and the dark menace of the distant war.
  caicus from the rampire saw it rise,
  black'ning the fields, and thick'ning thro' the skies.
  then to his fellows thus aloud he calls:

  but close within their lines attend their chance.
  unwilling, yet they keep the strict command,
  and sourly wait in arms the hostile band.
  the fiery turnus flew before the rest:
  a piebald steed of thracian strain he press'd;
  his helm of massy gold, and crimson was his crest.
  with twenty horse to second his designs,
  an unexpected foe, he fac'd the lines.
  "is there," he said, "in arms, who bravely dare
  his leader's honor and his danger share?"
  then spurring on, his brandish'd dart he threw,
  in sign of war: applauding shouts ensue.

  surveys each passage with a piercing sight,
  to force his foes in equal field to fight.
  thus while he gazes round, at length he spies,
  where, fenc'd with strong redoubts, their navy lies,
  close underneath the walls; the washing tide
  secures from all approach this weaker side.
  he takes the wish'd occasion, fills his hand

  when spoils by lot the victor shall obtain-
  thou saw'st the courser by proud turnus press'd:
  that, nisus, and his arms, and nodding crest,
  and shield, from chance exempt, shall be thy share:
  twelve lab'ring slaves, twelve handmaids young and fair
  all clad in rich attire, and train'd with care;
  and, last, a latian field with fruitful plains,
  and a large portion of the king's domains.
  but thou, whose years are more to mine allied-

  there lies our way; be thou upon the guard,

  and hew a passage thro' the sleeping foe."
  softly he spoke; then striding took his way,
  with his drawn sword, where haughty rhamnes lay;
  his head rais'd high on tapestry beneath,
  and heaving from his breast, he drew his breath;
  a king and prophet, by king turnus lov'd:
  but fate by prescience cannot be remov'd.

  which, by the spurning heels dispers'd around,

  these glitt'ring spoils (now made the victor's gain)

  and laces on, and wears the waving crest.
  proud of their conquest, prouder of their prey,
  they leave the camp, and take the ready way.

  but far they had not pass'd, before they spied
  three hundred horse, with volscens for their guide.
  the queen a legion to king turnus sent;
  but the swift horse the slower foot prevent,
  and now, advancing, sought the leader's tent.

  vast crowds the dying and the dead surround;
  and the yet reeking blood o'erflows the ground.
  all knew the helmet which messapus lost,
  but mourn'd a purchase that so dear had cost.
  now rose the ruddy morn from tithon's bed,
  and with the dawn of day the skies o'erspread;
  nor long the sun his daily course withheld,
  but added colors to the world reveal'd:
  when early turnus, wak'ning with the light,
  all clad in armor, calls his troops to fight.
  his martial men with fierce harangue he fir'd,
  and his own ardor in their souls inspir'd.
  this done- to give new terror to his foes,
  the heads of nisus and his friend he shows,
  rais'd high on pointed spears- a ghastly sight:

  or in the well-defended pass they die.

  the trojans hand to hand the fight maintain.

  when suddenly th' unhop'd-for news was brought,

  when pandarus beheld his brother kill'd,
  the town with fear and wild confusion fill'd,
  he turns the hinges of the heavy gate
  with both his hands, and adds his shoulders to the weight
  some happier friends within the walls inclos'd;
  the rest shut out, to certain death expos'd:
  fool as he was, and frantic in his care,
  t' admit young turnus, and include the war!
  he thrust amid the crowd, securely bold,
  like a fierce tiger pent amid the fold.
  too late his blazing buckler they descry,
  and sparkling fires that shot from either eye,
  his mighty members, and his ample breast,
  his rattling armor, and his crimson crest.

  far from that hated face the trojans fly,
  all but the fool who sought his destiny.
  mad pandarus steps forth, with vengeance vow'd
  for bitias' death, and threatens thus aloud:

  thus turnus: "then begin, and try thy fate:

  tell him a new achilles sent thee there."

  a lance of tough ground ash the trojan threw,
  rough in the rind, and knotted as it grew:
  with his full force he whirl'd it first around;
  but the soft yielding air receiv'd the wound:
  imperial juno turn'd the course before,
  and fix'd the wand'ring weapon in the door.

  "o, void of sense and courage!" mnestheus cried,
  "where can you hope your coward heads to hide?

  shall then a single sword such slaughter boast,
  and pass unpunish'd from a num'rous host?
  forsaking honor, and renouncing fame,
  your gods, your country, and your king you shame!"
  this just reproach their virtue does excite:
  they stand, they join, they thicken to the fight.

  now turnus doubts, and yet disdains to yield,
  but with slow paces measures back the field,
  and inches to the walls, where tiber's tide,
  washing the camp, defends the weaker side.
  the more he loses, they advance the more,
  and tread in ev'ry step he trod before.
  they shout: they bear him back; and, whom by might
  they cannot conquer, they oppress with weight.

  yet twice, inrag'd, the combat he renews,
  twice breaks, and twice his broken foes pursues.

  address'd himself on foot to single fight.

  a bull that seems to meditate the war,
  bending his neck, and spurning back the sand-
  runs roaring downward from his hilly stand:

  the steel just graz'd along the shoulder joint,
  and mark'd it slightly with the glancing point,
  fierce turnus first to nearer distance drew,
  and pois'd his pointed spear, before he threw:
  then, as the winged weapon whizz'd along,
  "see now," said he, "whose arm is better strung."
  the spear kept on the fatal course, unstay'd
  by plates of ir'n, which o'er the shield were laid:
  thro' folded brass and tough bull hides it pass'd,

l news, not from uncertain fame,
  but sad spectators, to the hero came:
  his friends upon the brink of ruin stand,
  unless reliev'd by his victorious hand.
  he whirls his sword around, without delay,
  and hews thro' adverse foes an ample way,
  to find fierce turnus, of his conquest proud:
  evander, pallas, all that friendship ow'd
  to large deserts, are present to his eyes;
  his plighted hand, and hospitable ties.

  four sons of sulmo, four whom ufens bred,
  he took in fight, and living victims led,
  to please the ghost of pallas, and expire,
  in sacrifice, before his fun'ral fire.
  at magus next he threw: he stoop'd below
  the flying spear, and shunn'd the promis'd blow;
  then, creeping, clasp'd the hero's knees, and pray'd:
  "by young iulus,

  the ransom of this one poor life shall pay.
  if i survive, will troy the less prevail?
  a single soul's too light to turn the scale."
  he said. the hero sternly thus replied:
  "thy bars and ingots, and the sums beside,
  leave for thy children's lot. thy turnus broke
  all rules of war by one relentless stroke,
  when pallas fell: so deems, nor deems alone
  my father's shadow, but my living son."
  thus having said, of kind remorse bereft,
  he seiz'd his helm, and dragg'd him with his left;
  then with his right hand, while his neck he wreath'd,
  up to the hilts his shining fauchion sheath'd.

  mows off his head: the trunk a moment stood,
  then sunk, and roll'd along the sand in blood.
  the vengeful victor thus upbraids the slain:
  "lie there, proud man, unpitied, on the plain;
  lie there, inglorious, and without a tomb,
  far from thy mother and thy native home,
  exposed to savage beasts, and birds of prey,
  or thrown for food to monsters of the sea."

  on lycas and antaeus next he ran,
  two chiefs of turnus, and who led his van.
  they fled for fear; with these, he chas'd along
  camers the yellow-lock'd, and numa strong;
  both great in arms, and both were fair and young.
  camers was son to volscens lately slain,
  in wealth surpassing all the latian train,

  to whom the goddess with the charming eyes,
  soft in her tone, submissively replies:
  "why, o my sov'reign lord, whose frown i fear,
  and cannot, unconcern'd, your anger bear;
  why urge you thus my grief? when, if i still
  (as once i was) were mistress of your will,
  from your almighty pow'r your pleasing wife
  might gain the grace of length'ning turnus' life,
  securely snatch him from the fatal fight,
  and give him to his aged father's sight.
  now let him perish, since you hold it good,
  and glut the trojans with his pious blood.
  yet from our lineage he derives his name,
  and, in the fourth degree, from god pilumnus came;
  yet he devoutly pays you rites divine,
  and offers daily incense at your shrine."

  then shortly thus the sov'reign god replied:
  "since in my pow'r and goodness you confide,

  or if a farther thought you entertain,
  to change the fates; you feed your hopes in vain."
  to whom the goddess thus, with weeping eyes:
  "and what if that request, your tongue denies,
  your heart should grant; and not a short reprieve,
  but length of certain life, to turnus give?

as, such seem'd the shade.
  adorn'd with dardan arms, the phantom bore
  his head aloft; a plumy crest he wore;
  this hand appear'd a shining sword to wield,
  and that sustain'd an imitated shield.
  with manly mien he stalk'd along the ground,
  nor wanted voice belied, nor vaunting sound.
  (thus haunting ghosts appear to waking sight,
  or dreadful visions in our dreams by night.)
  the specter seems the daunian chief to dare,
  and flourishes his empty sword in air.
  at this, advancing, turnus hurl'd his spear:
  the phantom wheel'd, and seem'd to fly for fear.
  deluded turnus thought the trojan fled,
  and with vain hopes his haughty fancy fed.
  "whether, o coward?" (thus he calls aloud,
  nor found he spoke to wind, and chas'd a cloud,)
  "why thus forsake your bride! receive from me
  the fated land you sought so long by sea."
  he said, and, brandishing at once his blade,
  with eager pace pursued the flying shade.
  by chance a ship was fasten'd to the shore,
  which from old

  for shelter there the trembling shadow bent,

  exulting turnus, with regardless haste,
  ascends the plank, and to the galley pass'd.
  scarce had he reach'd the prow: saturnia's hand
  the haulsers cuts, and shoots the ship from land.
  with wind in poop, the vessel plows the sea,
  and measures back with speed her former way.
  meantime aeneas seeks his absent foe,
  and sends his slaughter'd troops to shades below.

  the guileful phantom now forsook the shroud,
  and flew sublime, and vanish'd in a cloud.
  too late young turnus the delusion found,

  or set me shipwrack'd on some desart shore,

  unknown to friends, or foes, or conscious fame,
  lest she should follow, and my flight proclaim."

  thus turnus rav'd, and various fates revolv'd:
  the choice was doubtful, but the death resolv'd.
  and now the sword, and now the sea took place,
  that to revenge, and this to purge disgrace.
  sometimes he thought to swim the stormy main,
  by stretch of arms the distant shore to gain.
  thrice he the sword assay'd, and thrice the flood;
  but juno, mov'd with pity, both withstood.
  and thrice repress'd his rage; strong gales supplied,
  and push'd the vessel o'er the swelling tide.

  "o latian princes, how severe a fate

  and arm'd against an unoffending man,
  who sought your friendship ere the war began!
  you beg a truce, which i would gladly give,
  not only for the slain, but those who live.
  i came not hither but by heav'n's command,
  and sent by fate to share the latian land.
  nor wage i wars unjust: your king denied
  my proffer'd friendship, and my promis'd bride;
  left me for turnus. turnus then should try
  his cause in arms, to conquer or to die.
  my right and his are in dispute: the slain
  fell without fault, our quarrel to maintain.

  and let him vanquish, whom his fates befriend.

  of years, to match thy bulk with equal strength.
  but why, unhappy man, dost thou detain
  these troops, to view the tears thou shedd'st in vain?

  but, in the palace of the king, appears
  a scene more solemn, and a pomp of tears.
  maids, matrons, widows, mix their common moans;
  orphans their sires, and sires lament their sons.
  all in that universal sorrow share,
  and curse the cause of this unhappy war:
  a broken league, a bride unjustly sought,
  a crown usurp'd, which with their blood is bought!
  these are the crimes with which they load the name
  of turnus, and on him alone exclaim:
  "let him who lords it o'er th' ausonian land
  engage the trojan hero hand to hand:
  his is the gain; our lot is but to serve;
  't is just, the sway he seeks, he should deserve."
  this drances aggravates; and adds, with spite:
  "his foe expects, and dares him to the fight."
  nor turnus wants a party, to support
  his cause and credit in the latian court.
  his former acts secure his present fame,
  and the queen shades him with her mighty name.

  then drances took the word, who grudg'd, long since,
  the rising glories of the daunian prince.
  factious and rich, bold at the council board,
  but cautious in the field, he shunn'd the sword;
  a close caballer, and tongue-valiant lord.
  noble his mother was, and near the throne;
  but, what his father's parentage, unknown.
  he rose, and took th' advantage of the times,
  to load young turnus with invidious crimes.
  "such truths, o king," said he, "your words contain,
  as strike the sense, and all replies are vain;
  nor are your loyal subjects now to seek
  what common needs require, but fear to speak.
  let him give leave of speech, that haughty man,

  permit not, mighty man, so mean a crew
  should share such triumphs, and detain from you
  the post of honor, your undoubted due.

  to merit what alone you must enjoy."

  these words, so full of malice mix'd with art,
  inflam'd with rage the youthful hero's heart.
  then, groaning from the bottom of his breast,
  he heav'd for wind, and thus his wrath express'd:
  "you, drances, never want a stream of words,

  if you consent, he shall not be refus'd,

  and i alone will answer his demand.

  the danger, nor divide the prize of war."

  while they debate, nor these nor those will yield,
  aeneas draws his forces to the field,
  and moves his camp. the scouts with flying speed
  return, and thro' the frighted city spread
  th' unpleasing news, the trojans are descried,

  th' impetuous youth press forward to the field;
  they clash the sword, and clatter on the shield:
  the fearful matrons raise a screaming cry;
  old feeble men with fainter groans reply;
  a jarring sound results, and mingles in the sky,
  like that of swans remurm'ring to the floods,
  or birds of diff'ring kinds in hollow woods.

  turnus th' occasion takes, and cries aloud:
  "talk on, ye quaint haranguers of the crowd:
  declaim in praise of peace, when danger calls,
  and the fierce foes in arms approach the walls."
  he said, and, turning short, with speedy pace,
  casts back a scornful glance, and quits the place:
  "thou, volusus, the volscian troops command

  high in her chair she sits, and, at her side,
  with downcast eyes, appears the fatal bride.
  they mount the cliff, where pallas' temple stands;
  pray'rs in their mouths, and presents in their hands,

  "o patroness of arms, unspotted maid,
  propitious hear, and lend thy latins aid!
  break short the pirate's lance; pronounce his fate,
  and lay the phrygian low before the gate."

  now turnus arms for fight. his back and breast
  well-temper'd steel and scaly brass invest:
  the cuishes which his brawny thighs infold
  are mingled metal damask'd o'er with gold.
  his faithful fauchion sits upon his side;
  nor casque, nor crest, his manly features hide:
  but, bare to view, amid surrounding friends,
  with godlike grace, he from the tow'r descends.
  exulting in his strength, he seems to dare

  then, i alone, sustain'd by these, will meet
  the tyrrhene troops, and promise their defeat.
  ours be the danger, ours the sole renown:

  turnus a while stood mute, with glad surprise,
  and on the fierce virago fix'd his eyes;
  then thus return'd: "o grace of italy,

  a narrow track, by human steps untrode,

  high o'er the vale a steepy mountain stands,
  whence the surveying sight the nether ground commands.

  of war; and from the war a safe retreat:
  for, on the right and left, is room to press
  the foes at hand, or from afar distress;
  to drive 'em headlong downward, and to pour
  on their descending backs a stony show'r.
  thither young turnus took the well-known way,
  possess'd the pass, and in blind ambush lay.

  meantime latonian phoebe, from the skies,
  beheld th' approaching war with hateful eyes,
  and call'd the light-foot opis to her aid,
  her most belov'd and ever-trusty maid;
  then with a sigh began: "camilla goes

  (a gath'ring mist o'erclouds her cheerful eyes,
  and from her cheeks the rosy color flies:)
  then turns to her, whom of her female train
  she trusted most, and thus she speaks with pain:
  "acca, 't is past! he swims before my sight,
  inexorable death; and claims his right.
  bear my last words to turnus; fly with speed,
  and bid him timely to my charge succeed,
  repel the trojans, and the town relieve:
  farewell! and in this kiss my parting breath receive."
  she said, and, sliding, sunk upon the plain:
  dying, her open'd hand forsakes the rein;
  short, and more short, she pants; by slow degrees
  her mind the passage from her body frees.
  she drops her sword; she nods her plumy crest,
  her drooping head declining on her breast:

  like a resistless flood, come rolling on:
  the cry goes off the plain, and thickens to the town."

  the more his fury boil'd within his breast:
  he rous'd his vigor for the last debate,
  and rais'd his haughty soul to meet his fate.

  as, when the swains the libyan lion chase,
  he makes a sour retreat, nor mends his pace;
  but, if the pointed jav'lin pierce his side,
  the lordly beast returns with double pride:
  he wrenches out the steel, he roars for pain;
  his sides he lashes, and erects his mane:
  so turnus fares; his eyeballs flash with fire,
  thro' his wide nostrils clouds of smoke expire.

  trembling with rage, around the court he ran,
  at length approach'd the king, and thus began:
  "no more excuses or delays: i stand
  in arms prepar'd to combat, hand to hand,
  this base deserter of his native land.

  scarce in our walls we keep our hopes alive:
  the rolling flood runs warm with human gore;
  the bones of latians blanch the neighb'ring shore.

  what would my kinsmen the rutulians say?
  and, should you fall in fight, (which heav'n defend!)
  how curse the cause which hasten'd to his end
  the daughter's lover and the father's friend?
  weigh in your mind the various chance of war;

  this arm, this lance, can well dispute the prize;

  but now the queen, who fear'd for turnus' life,
  and loath'd the hard conditions of the strife,
  held him by force; and, dying in his death,
  in these sad accents gave her sorrow breath:
  "o turnus, i adjure thee by these tears,
  and whate'er price amata's honor bears

  propp'd on a pillar, which the ceiling bore,
  was plac'd the lance auruncan actor wore;
  which with such force he brandish'd in his hand,
  the tough ash trembled like an osier wand:

  with sighs and tears, the goddess of the lake,
  king turnus' sister, once a lovely maid,
  ere to the lust of lawless jove betray'd:
  compress'd by force, but, by the grateful god,
  now made the nais of the neighb'ring flood.
  "o nymph, the pride of living lakes," said she,
  "o most renown'd, and most belov'd by me,
  long hast thou known, nor need i to record,
  the wanton sallies of my wand'ring lord.

  she said, and, sailing on the winged wind,
  left the sad nymph suspended in her mind.

  and now pomp the peaceful kings appear:
  four steeds the chariot of latinus bear;
  twelve golden beams around his temples play,
  to mark his lineage from the god of day.
  two snowy coursers turnus' chariot yoke,

  already the rutulians deem their man
  o'ermatch'd in arms, before the fight began.
  first rising fears are whisper'd thro' the crowd;
  then, gath'ring sound, they murmur more aloud.
  now, side to side, they measure with their eyes
  the champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:
  the nearer they approach, the more is known
  th' apparent disadvantage of their own.
  turnus himself appears in public sight
  conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.
  slowly he moves, and at his altar stands
  with eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;
  and, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,
  a livid deadness in his cheeks appears.

  with anxious pleasure when juturna view'd
  th' increasing fright of the mad multitude,
  when their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard,

  and humoring their first motions, thus began:
  "for shame, rutulians, can you bear the sight
  of one expos'd for all, in single fight?
  can we, before the face of heav'n, confess
  our courage colder, or our numbers less?
  view all the trojan host, th' arcadian band,
  and tuscan army; count 'em as they stand:
  undaunted to the battle if we go,
  scarce ev'ry second man will share a foe.
  turnus, 't is true, in this unequal strife,
  shall lose, with honor, his devoted life,
  or change it rather for immortal fame,
  succeeding to the gods, from whence he came:
  but you, a servile and inglorious band,
  for foreign lords shall sow your native land,
  those fruitful fields your fighting fathers gain'd,
  which have so long their lazy sons sustain'd."
  with words like these, she carried her design:
  a rising murmur runs along the line.

  bare was his head, and naked were his hands,
  in sign of truce: then thus he cries aloud:
  "what sudden rage, what new desire of blood,
  inflames your alter'd minds? o trojans, cease
  from impious arms, nor violate the peace!
  by human sanctions, and by laws divine,
  the terms are all agreed; the war is mine.
  dismiss your fears, and let the fight ensue;
  this hand alone shall right the gods and you:
  our injur'd altars, and their broken vow,
  to this avenging sword the faithless turnus owe."

  thus while he spoke, unmindful of defense,
  a winged arrow struck the pious prince.
  but, whether from some human hand it came,
  or hostile god, is left unknown by fame:
  no human hand or hostile god was found,
  to boast the triumph of so base a wound.

  when turnus saw the trojan quit the plain,
  his chiefs dismay'd, his troops a fainting train,
  th' unhop'd event his heighten'd soul inspires:
  at once his arms and coursers he requires;

  thus, on the banks of hebrus' freezing flood,
  the god of battles, in his angry mood,
  clashing his sword against his brazen shield,
  let loose the reins, and scours along the field:
  before the wind his fiery coursers fly;
  groans the sad earth, resounds the rattling sky.
  wrath, terror, treason, tumult, and despair
  (dire faces, and deform'd) surround the car;
  friends of the god, and followers of the war.
  with fury not unlike, nor less disdain,
  exulting turnus flies along the plain:
  his smoking horses, at their utmost speed,
  he lashes on, and urges o'er the dead.
  their fetlocks run with blood; and, when they bound,
  the gore and gath'ring dust are dash'd around.
  thamyris and pholus, masters of the war,
  he kill'd at hand, but sthenelus afar:
  from far the sons of imbracus he slew,
  glaucus and lades, of the lycian crew;
  both taught to fight on foot, in battle join'd,
  or mount the courser that outstrips the wind.

  this son of dolon bore his grandsire's name,
  but emulated more his father's fame;
  his guileful father, sent a nightly spy,
  the grecian camp and order to descry:
  hard enterprise! and well he might require
  achilles' car and horses, for his hire:
  but, met upon the scout, th' aetolian prince
  in death bestow'd a juster recompense.
  fierce turnus view'd the trojan from afar,
  and launch'd his jav'lin from his lofty car;
  then lightly leaping down, pursued the blow,
  and, pressing with his foot his prostrate foe,
  wrench'd from his feeble hold the shining sword,
  and plung'd it in the bosom of its lord.
  "possess," said he, "the fruit of all thy pains,
  and measure, at thy length, our latian plains.
  thus are my foes rewarded by my hand;
  thus may they build their town, and thus enjoy the land!"

  and rolls the billows on th' aegaean shore:
  so, where resistless turnus takes his course,
  the scatter'd squadrons bend before his force;
  his crest of horses' hair is blown behind
  by adverse air, and rustles in the wind.

  this haughty phegeus saw with high disdain,
  and, as the chariot roll'd along the plain,
  light from the ground he leapt, and seiz'd the rein.
  thus hung in air, he still retain'd his hold,
  the coursers frighted, and their course controll'd.

  and pierc'd his plated arms, but pass'd along,

  to toils of war, be mindful of my worth;

  he said; and, striding, issued on the plain.
  anteus and mnestheus, and a num'rous train,
  attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,
  and, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.
  a cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,
  labors beneath their feet the trembling ground.

  now turnus, posted on a hill, from far
  beheld the progress of the moving war:
  with him the latins view'd the cover'd plains,
  and the chill blood ran backward in their veins.
  juturna saw th' advancing troops appear,
  and heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.

  the fatal augur falls, by whose command
  the truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued
  with trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.
  loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky,
  and o'er the field the frighted latins fly.
  the prince disdains the dastards to pursue,
  nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;
  turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,
  he seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.

  the prince, whose piety had long repell'd
  his inborn ardor, now invades the field;
  invokes the pow'rs of violated peace,
  their rites and injur'd altars to redress;
  then, to his rage abandoning the rein,
  with blood and slaughter'd bodies fills the plain.

  it reach'd his heart, nor needs a second thrust.
  now turnus, at two blows, two brethren slew;

  then, leaping on the ground, on foot assail'd
  diores, and in equal fight prevail'd.
  their lifeless trunks he leaves upon the place;
  their heads, distilling gore, his chariot grace.

  murranus, boasting of his blood, that springs
  from a long royal race of latian kings,

  betwixt the wheels he fell; the wheels, that bore
  his living load, his dying body tore.
  his starting steeds, to shun the glitt'ring sword,
  paw down his trampled limbs, forgetful of their lord.

  fierce hyllus threaten'd high, and, face to face,
  affronted turnus in the middle space:
  the prince encounter'd him in full career,
  and at his temples aim'd the deadly spear;
  so fatally the flying weapon sped,
  that thro' his helm it pierc'd his head.
  nor, cisseus, couldst thou scape from turnus' hand,
  in vain the strongest of th' arcadian band:
  nor to cupentus could his gods afford

  they strike, they push, they throng the scanty space,
  resolv'd on death, impatient of disgrace;
  and, where one falls, another fills his place.

  the cyprian goddess now inspires her son
  to leave th' unfinish'd fight, and storm the town:
  for, while he rolls his eyes around the plain
  in quest of turnus, whom he seeks in vain,
  he views th' unguarded city from afar,
  in careless quiet, and secure of war.
  occasion offers, and excites his mind
  to dare beyond the task he first design'd.
  resolv'd, he calls his chiefs; they leave the fight:
  attended thus, he takes a neighb'ring height;
  the crowding troops about their gen'ral stand,
  all under arms, and wait his high command.
  then thus the lofty prince: "hear and obey,
  ye trojan bands, without the least delay

  the people shall be slaves, unless in time
  they kneel for pardon, and repent their crime.

  cleanse the polluted place with purging fires."

  he finish'd; and, one soul inspiring all,
  form'd in a wedge, the foot approach the wall.
  without the town, an unprovided train
  of gaping, gazing citizens are slain.

  but fate and envious fortune now prepare
  to plunge the latins in the last despair.
  the queen, who saw the foes invade the town,
  and brands on tops of burning houses thrown,
  cast round her eyes, distracted with her fear-
  no troops of turnus in the field appear.
  once more she stares abroad, but still in vain,
  and then concludes the royal youth is slain.
  mad with her anguish, impotent to bear
  the mighty grief, she loathes the vital air.
  she calls herself the cause of all this ill,
  and owns the dire effects of her ungovern'd will;
  she raves against the gods; she beats her breast;
  she tears with both her hands her purple vest:
  then round a beam a running noose she tied,
  and, fasten'd by the neck, obscenely died.

  and silent shame, are seen in ev'ry face.
  latinus tears his garments as he goes,
  both for his public and his private woes;
  with filth his venerable beard besmears,
  and sordid dust deforms his silver hairs.
  and much he blames the softness of his mind,
  obnoxious to the charms of womankind,
  and soon seduc'd to change what he so well design'd;
  to break the solemn league so long desir'd,
  nor finish what his fates, and those of troy, requir'd.

  now turnus rolls aloof o'er empty plains,
  and here and there some straggling foes he gleans.
  his flying coursers please him less and less,
  asham'd of easy fight and cheap success.
  thus half-contented, anxious in his mind,
  the distant cries come driving in the wind,
  shouts from the walls, but shouts in murmurs drown'd;
  a jarring mixture, and a boding sound.

  what doleful clamors from the town arise?"

  and now in vain you would deceive my sight-

  your share of mortal sorrows to sustain,
  and see your brother bleeding on the plain?

  which not belies my great forefather's name!"

  he said; and while he spoke, with flying speed
  came sages urging on his foamy steed:
  fix'd on his wounded face a shaft he bore,
  and, seeking turnus, sent his voice before:
  "turnus, on you, on you alone, depends
  our last relief: compassionate your friends!

  prone thro' the void the rocky ruin shoots,
  rolling from crag to crag, from steep to steep;
  down sink, at once, the shepherds and their sheep:
  involv'd alike, they rush to nether ground;
  stunn'd with the shock they fall, and stunn'd from earth rebound:
  so turnus, hasting headlong to the town,
  should'ring and shoving, bore the squadrons down.
  still pressing onward, to the walls he drew,
  where shafts, and spears, and darts promiscuous flew,
  and sanguine streams the slipp'ry ground embrue.
  first stretching out his arm, in sign of peace,
  he cries aloud, to make the combat cease:

  so clash their swords, and so their shields resound.

  jove sets the beam; in either scale he lays
  the champions' fate, and each exactly weighs.
  on this side, life and lucky chance ascends;
  loaded with death, that other scale descends.
  rais'd on the stretch, young turnus aims a blow
  full on the helm of his unguarded foe:
  shrill shouts and clamors ring on either side,
  as hopes and fears their panting hearts divide.
  but all in pieces flies the traitor sword,
  and, in the middle stroke, deserts his lord.
  now is but death, or flight; disarm'd he flies,
  when in his hand an unknown hilt he spies.

  the realm with ruin, and their ancient seats

  thus menacing, he still pursues the course,

  ten times already round the listed place
  one chief had fled, and t' other giv'n the chase:
  no trivial prize is play'd; for on the life
  or death of turnus now depends the strife.

  within the space, an olive tree had stood,
  a sacred shade, a venerable wood,
  for vows to faunus paid, the latins' guardian god.
  here hung the vests, and tablets were ingrav'd,
  of sinking mariners from shipwrack sav'd.
  with heedless hands the trojans fell'd the tree,
  to make the ground inclos'd for combat free.

  once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:
  one trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;
  and both resolv'd alike to try their fatal chance.

  meantime imperial jove to juno spoke,
  who from a shining cloud beheld the shock:
  "what new arrest, o queen of heav'n, is sent
  to stop the fates now lab'ring in th' event?
  what farther hopes are left thee to pursue?

  with such a sudden and unseen a flight
  shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.
  soon as the field inclos'd she had in view,
  and from afar her destin'd quarry knew,
  contracted, to the boding bird she turns,
  which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns,
  and beats about the tombs with nightly wings,
  where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.
  thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries
  the fury round unhappy turnus flies,
  flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.

  a lazy chillness crept along his blood;
  chok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood.
  juturna from afar beheld her fly,
  and knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry
  and stridor of her wings. amaz'd with fear,

my brother's ghost below!
  the joys are vanish'd: nothing now remains,
  of life immortal, but immortal pains.
  what earth will open her devouring womb,
  to rest a weary goddess in the tomb!"
  she drew a length of sighs; nor more she said,
  but in her azure mantle wrapp'd her head,
  then plung'd into her stream, with deep despair,
  and her last sobs came bubbling up in air.

  now stern aeneas his weighty spear
  against his foe, and thus upbraids his fear:
  "what farther subterfuge can turnus find?
  what empty hopes are harbor'd in his mind?
  't is not thy swiftness can secure thy flight;
  not with their feet, but hands, the valiant fight.
  vary thy shape in thousand forms, and dare
  what skill and courage can attempt in war;
  wish for the wings of winds, to mount the sky;
  or hid, within the hollow earth to lie!"
  the champion shook his head, and made this short reply:
  "no threats of thine my manly mind can move;
  't is hostile heav'n i dread, and partial jove."

  and shiv'ring cold congeals his vital blood.
  the stone drops from his arms, and, falling short
  for want of vigor, mocks his vain effort.
  and as, when heavy sleep has clos'd the sight,
  the sickly fancy labors in the night;
  we seem to run; and, destitute of force,
  our sinking limbs forsake us in the course:
  in vain we heave for breath; in vain we cry;
  the nerves, unbrac'd, their usual strength deny;
  and on the tongue the falt'ring accents die:
  so turnus far'd; whatever means he tried,
  all force of arms and points of art employ'd,
  the fury flew athwart, and made th' endeavor void.

  a thousand various thoughts his soul confound;
  he star'd about, nor aid nor issue found;
  his own men stop the pass, and his own walls surround.
  once more he pauses, and looks out again,
  and seeks the goddess charioteer in vain.
  trembling he views the thund'ring chief advance,
  and brandishing aloft the deadly lance:

e to my friends my body void of breath!
  the latian chiefs have seen me beg my life;
  thine is the conquest, thine the royal wife:
  against a yielded man, 't is mean ignoble strife."

  in deep suspense the trojan seem'd to stand,
  and, just prepar'd to strike, repress'd his hand.
  he roll'd his eyes, and ev'ry moment felt
  his manly soul with more compassion melt;
  when, casting down a casual glance, he spied
  the golden belt that glitter'd on his side,
  the fatal spoils which haughty turnus tore
  from dying pallas, and in triumph wore.
  then, rous'd anew to wrath, he loudly cries
  (flames, while he spoke, came flashing from his eyes)
  "traitor, dost thou, dost thou to grace pretend,
  clad, as thou art, in trophies of my friend?
  to his sad soul a grateful off'ring go!
  't is pallas, pallas gives this deadly blow."
  he rais'd his arm aloft, and, at the word,
  deep in his bosom drove the shining sword.
  the streaming blood distain'd his arms around,
  and the disdainful so
