  when i wake up, the other side of the bed is cold. my fin-
gers stretch out, seeking primâ€™s warmth but finding only the 
rough canvas cover of the mattress. she must have had bad 
dreams and climbed in with our mother. of course, she did. 
this is the day of the reaping. 
i prop myself up on one elbow. thereâ€™s enough light in the 
bedroom to see them. my little sister, prim, curled up on her 
side, cocooned in my motherâ€™s body, their cheeks pressed to-
gether. in sleep, my mother looks younger, still worn but not 
so beaten-down. primâ€™s face is as fresh as a raindrop, as lovely 
as the primrose for which she was named. my mother was 
very beautiful once, too. or so they tell me. 
sitting at primâ€™s knees, guarding her, is the worldâ€™s ugliest 
cat. mashed-in nose, half of one ear missing, eyes the color of 
rotting squash. prim named him buttercup, insisting that his 
muddy yellow coat matched the bright flower. i le hates me. 
or at least distrusts me. even though i

in the fall, a few brave souls sneak into the woods to harv-
est apples. but always in sight of the meadow. always close 
enough to run back to the safety of district 12 if trouble arises. 
â€œdistrict twelve. where you can starve to death in safety,â€ i 
mutter. then i glance quickly over my shoulder. even here, 
even in the middle of nowhere, you worry someone might 
overhear you. 
when i was younger, i scared my mother to death, the 
things i would blurt out about district 12, about the people 
who rule our country, panem, from the far-off city called the 
capitol. eventually i understood this would only lead us to 
more trouble. so i learned to hold my tongue and to turn my 
features into an indifferent mask so that no one could ever 
read my thoughts. do my work quietly in school. make only 
polite small talk in the public market. discuss little more than 
trades in the hob, which is the black market where i

about it because the alternative is to be scared out of your 
wits. besides, the capitol accent is so affected, almost anything 
sounds funny in it. 
i watch as gale pulls out his knife and slices the bread. he 
could be my brother. straight black hair, olive skin, we even 
have the same gray eyes. but weâ€™re not related, at least not 
closely. most of the families who work the mines resemble 
one another this way. 
thatâ€™s why my mother and prim, with their light hair and 
blue eyes, always look out of place. they are. my motherâ€™s 
parents were part of the small merchant class that caters to 
officials, peacekeepers, and the occasional seam customer. 
they ran an apothecary shop in the nicer part of district 12. 
since almost no one can afford doctors, apothecaries are our 
healers. my father got to know my mother because on his 
hunts he would sometimes collect medicinal herbs and sell 
them to her shop to be brewed into rem

the woods? it doesnâ€™t change anything. it doesnâ€™t make things 
fair. it doesnâ€™t fill our stomachs. in fact, it scares off the nearby 
game. i let him yell though. better he does it in the woods than 
in the district. 
gale and i divide our spoils, leaving two fish, a couple of 
loaves of good bread, greens, a quart of strawberries, salt, pa-
raffin, and a bit of money for each. 
â€œsee you in the square,â€ i say. 
â€œwear something pretty,â€ he says flatly. 
at home, i find my mother and sister are ready to go. my 
mother wears a fine dress from her apothecary days. prim is 
in my first reaping outfit, a skirt and ruffled blouse. itâ€™s a bit 
big on her, but my mother has made it stay with pins. even so, 
sheâ€™s having trouble keeping the blouse tucked in at the back. 
a tub of warm water waits for me. i scrub off the dirt and 
sweat from the woods and even wash my hair. to my surprise, 
my mother has laid out one of her own lovely dresses for me.

rected to the adjacent streets, where they can watch the event 
on screens as itâ€™s televised live by the state. 
i find myself standing in a clump of sixteens from the seam. 
we all exchange terse nods then focus our attention on the 
temporary stage that is set up before the justice building. it 
holds three chairs, a podium, and two large glass balls, one for 
the boys and one for the girls. i stare at the paper slips in the 
girlsâ€™ ball. twenty of them have katniss everdeen written on 
them in careful handwriting. 
two of the three chairs fill with madgeâ€™s father, mayor un-
dersee, whoâ€™s a tall, balding man, and effie trinket, district 
12â€™s escort, fresh from the capitol with her scary white grin, 
pinkish hair, and spring green suit. they murmur to each oth-
er and then look with concern at the empty seat. 
just as the town clock strikes two, the mayor steps up to 
the podium and begins to read. itâ€™s the same story every year. 
he tells of the history of

names. she reaches in, digs her hand deep into the ball, and 
pulls out a slip of paper. the crowd draws in a collective 
breath and then you can hear a pin drop, and iâ€™m feeling nau-
seous and so desperately hoping that itâ€™s not me, that itâ€™s not 
me, that itâ€™s not me. 
effie trinket crosses back to the podium, smoothes the slip 
of paper, and reads out the name in a clear voice. and itâ€™s not 
me. itâ€™s primrose everdeen.

  one time, when i was in a blind in a tree, waiting motion-
less for game to wander by, i dozed off and fell ten feet to the 
ground, landing on my back. it was as if the impact had 
knocked every wisp of air from my lungs, and i lay there 
struggling to inhale, to exhale, to do anything. 
thatâ€™s how i feel now, trying to remember how to breathe, 
unable to speak, totally stunned as the name bounces around 
the inside of my skull. someone is gripping my arm, a boy

â€œwhat does it matter?â€ says the mayor. heâ€™s looking at me

he repeats gruffly. â€œlet her come forward.â€ 
prim is screaming hysterically behind me. sheâ€™s wrapped 
her skinny arms around me like a vice. â€œno, katniss! no! you

steel myself and climb the steps. 
â€œwell, bravo!â€ gushes effie trinket. â€œthatâ€™s the spirit of the 
games!â€ sheâ€™s pleased to finally have a district with a little ac-
tion going on in it. â€œwhatâ€™s your name?â€ 
i swallow hard. â€œkatniss everdeen,â€ i say.

ime. my father had been killed in 
the mine accident three months earlier in the bitterest janu-
ary anyone could remember. the numbness of his loss had 
passed, and the pain would hit me out of nowhere, doubling 
me over, racking my body with sobs. where are you? i would 
cry out in my mind.  where  have  you  gone? of course, there 
was never any answer. 
the district had given us a small amount of money as com-
pensation for his death, enough to cover one month of griev-
ing at which time my mother would be expected to get a job.

only she didnâ€™t. she didnâ€™t do anything but sit propped up in a 
chair or, more often, huddled under the blankets on her bed, 
eyes fixed on some point in the distance. once in a while, sheâ€™d 
stir, get up as if moved by some urgent purpose, only to then 
collapse back into stillness. no amount of pleading from prim 
seemed to affect her. 
i was terrified. i suppose now that my mother was locked 
in some dark world of sadness, but at the time, al

that i had lost not only a father, but a mother as well. at ele-

family. there was no choice. i bought our food at the market 
and cooked it as best i could and tried to keep prim and my-
self looking presentable. because if it had become known that 
my mother could no longer care for us, the district would have 
taken us away from her and placed us in the community 
home. iâ€™d grown up seeing those home kids at school. the 
sadness, the marks of angry hands on their faces, the hope-
lessness that curled their shoulders forward. i could never let 
that happen to prim. sweet, tiny prim who cried when i cried 
before she even knew the reason, who brushed and plaited my 
motherâ€™s hair before we left for school, who still polished my

rain had soaked through my fatherâ€™s hunting jacket, leaving 
me chilled to the bone. for three days, weâ€™d had nothing but 
boiled water with some old dried mint leaves iâ€™d found in the 
back of a cupboard. by the time the market closed, i was shak-
ing so hard i dropped my bundle of baby clothes in a mud 
puddle. i didnâ€™t pick it up for fear i would keel over and be un-
able to regain my feet. besides, no one wanted those clothes. 
i couldnâ€™t go home. because at home was my mother with

cracked lips. i couldnâ€™t walk into that room with the smoky

and backed away, i noticed him, a boy with blond hair peering

was in my year, but i didnâ€™t know his name. he stuck with the 
town kids, so how would i? his mother went back into the ba-
kery, grumbling, but he must have been watching me as i 
made my way behind the pen that held their pig and leaned 
against the far side of an old apple tree. the realization that 
iâ€™d have nothing to take home had finally sunk in. my knees 
buckled and i slid down the tree trunk to its roots. it was too 
much. i was too sick and weak and tired, oh, so tired. let them 
call  the  peacekeepers  and  take  us  to  the  community  home, i 
thought. or better yet, let me die

 right here in the rain. 
there was a clatter in the bakery and i heard the woman 
screaming again and the sound of a blow, and i vaguely won-
dered what was going on. feet sloshed toward me through the 
mud and i thought, itâ€™s her. sheâ€™s coming to drive me away with 
a stick. but it wasnâ€™t her. it was the boy. in his arms, he carried 
two large loaves of bread that must have fallen into the fire 
because the crusts were scorched black. 
his mother was yelling, â€œfeed it to the pig, you stupid crea-
ture! why not? no one decent will buy burned bread!â€ 
he began to tear off chunks from the burned parts and toss 
them into the trough, and the front bakery bell rung and the 
mother disappeared to help a customer. 
the boy never even glanced my way, but i was watching 
him. because of the bread, because of the red weal that stood 
out on his cheekbone. what had she hit him with? 
my parents never hit us. i couldnâ€™t even imagine it. the bo

must have. because there they were at my feet. 
before anyone could witness what had happened i shoved the 
loaves up under my shirt, wrapped the hunting jacket tightly 
about me, and walked swiftly away. the heat of the bread 
burned into my skin, but i clutched it tighter, clinging to life. 
by the time i reached home, the loaves had cooled some-
what, but the insides were still warm. when i dropped them 
on the table, primâ€™s hands reached to tear off a chunk, but i 
made her sit, forced my mother to join us at the table, and 
poured warm tea. i scraped off the black stuff and sliced the 
bread. we ate an entire loaf, slice by slice. it was good hearty 
bread, filled with raisins and nuts. 
i put my clothes to dry at the fire, crawled into bed, and fell 
into a dreamless sleep. it didnâ€™t occur to me until the next 
morning that the boy might have burned the bread on pur-
pose. might have dropped the loaves into the flames, knowing 
it meant being punished, and then delivered them to me.

  the moment the anthem ends, we are taken into custody. i 
donâ€™t mean weâ€™re handcuffed or anything, but a group of 
peacekeepers marches us through the front door of the justice 
building. maybe tributes have tried to escape in the past. iâ€™ve 
never seen that happen though. 
once inside, iâ€™m conducted to a room and left alone. itâ€™s the 
richest place iâ€™ve ever been in, with thick, deep carpets and a 
velvet couch and chairs. i know velvet because my mother has 
a dress with a collar made of the stuff. when i sit on the couch, 
i canâ€™t help running my fingers over the fabric repeatedly. it 
helps to calm me as i try to prepare for the next hour. the 
time allotted for the tributes to say goodbye to their loved 
ones. i cannot afford to get upset, to leave this room with puf-
fy eyes and a red nose. crying is not an option. there will be 
more cameras at the train station. 
my sister and my mother come first. i reach out to prim 
and she climbs on

all the things they must remember to do, now that i will not be 
there to do them for them.

prim is not to take any tesserae. they can get by, if 
theyâ€™re careful, on selling primâ€™s goat milk and cheese and the 
small apothecary business my mother now runs for the people 
in the seam. gale will get her the herbs she doesnâ€™t grow her-
self, but she must be very careful to describe them because 
heâ€™s not as familiar with them as i am. heâ€™ll also bring them 
game â€” he and i made a pact about this a year or so ago â€” 
and will probably not ask for compensation, but they should 
thank him with some kind of trade, like milk or medicine. 
i donâ€™t bother suggesting prim learn to hunt. i tried to teach 
her a couple of times and it was

disastrous. the woods terri-
fied her, and whenever i shot something, sheâ€™d get teary and 
talk about how we might be able to heal it if we got it home 
soon enough. but she makes out well with her goat, so i con-
centrate on that. 
when i am done with instructions about fuel, and trading, 
and staying in school, i turn to my mother and grip her arm, 
hard. â€œlisten to me. are you listening to me?â€ she nods, 
alarmed by my intensity. she must know whatâ€™s coming. â€œyou 
canâ€™t leave again,â€ i say. 
my motherâ€™s eyes find the floor. â€œi know. i wonâ€™t. i couldnâ€™t 
help whatâ€”â€ 
â€œwell, you have to help it this time. you canâ€™t clock out and 
leave prim on her own. thereâ€™s no me now to keep you both 
alive. it doesnâ€™t matter what happens. whatever you see on 
the screen. you have to promise me youâ€™ll f

o fast and 
brave. maybe you can win.â€ 
i canâ€™t win. prim must know that in her heart. the competi-
tion will be far beyond my abilities. kids from wealthier dis-
tricts, where winning is a huge honor, whoâ€™ve been trained 
their whole lives for this. boys who are two to three times my 
size. girls who know twenty different ways to kill you with a 
knife. oh, thereâ€™ll be people like me, too. people to weed out 
before the real fun begins. 
â€œmaybe,â€ i say, because i can hardly tell my mother to carry 
on if iâ€™ve already given up myself. besides, it isnâ€™t in my nature 
to go down without a fight, even when things seem insur-
mountable. â€œthen weâ€™d be rich as haymitch.â€ 
â€œi donâ€™t care if weâ€™re rich. i just want you to come home. 
you will try, wonâ€™t you? really, really try?â€ asks prim. 
â€œreally, really try. i swear it,â€ i say. and i know, because of 
prim, iâ€™ll have to.

â€œat least, you two have decent manners,â€ says effie as weâ€™re

with their hands like a couple of savages. it completely upset 
my digestion.â€ 
the pair last year were two kids from the seam whoâ€™d nev-
er, not one day of their lives, had enough to eat. and when 
they did have food, table manners were surely the last thing 
on their minds. peetaâ€™s a bakerâ€™s son. my mother taught prim 
and i to eat properly, so yes, i can handle a fork and knife. but 
i hate effie trinketâ€™s comment so much i make a point of eat-
ing the rest of my meal with my fingers. then i wipe my hands

with the golden-headed weeds. after weâ€™d harvested those, 
we scrounged along inside the fence for probably a mile until 
weâ€™d filled the bucket with the dandelion greens, stems, and 
flowers. that night, we gorged ourselves on dandelion salad 
and the rest of the bakery bread. 
â€œwhat else?â€ prim asked me. â€œwhat other food can we 
find?â€ 
â€œall kinds of things,â€ i promised her. â€œi just have to remem-
ber them.â€ 
my mother had a book sheâ€™d brought with her from the 
apothecary shop. the pages were made of old parchment and 
covered in ink drawings of plants. neat handwritten blocks 
told their names, where to gather them, when they came in 
bloom, their medical uses. but my father added other entries 
to the book. plants for eating, not healing. dandelions, poke-
weed, wild onions, pines. prim and i spent the rest of the night 
poring over those pages. 
the next day, we were off school. for a while i hung around

therâ€™s voice joking, â€œas long as you can find yourself, youâ€™ll 
never starve.â€ i spent hours stirring up the pond bed with my 
toes and a stick, gathering the tubers that floated to the top. 
that night, we feasted on fish and katniss roots until we were 
all, for the first time in months, full. 
slowly, my mother returned to us. she began to clean and 
cook and preserve some of the food i brought in for winter. 
people traded us or paid money for her medical remedies. one 
day, i heard her singing.

prim was thrilled to have her back, but i kept watching, 
waiting for her to disappear on us again. i didnâ€™t trust her. and 
some small gnarled place inside me hated her for her weak-
ness, for her neglect, for the months she had put us through. 
prim forgave her, but i had taken a step back from

could open it again, but unsure of what would happen at such 
high speed. in the distance, i see the lights of another district. 
7? 10? i donâ€™t know. i think about the people in their houses, 
settling in for bed. i imagine my home, with its shutters drawn 
tight. what are they doing now, my mother and prim? were 
they able to eat supper? the fish stew and the strawberries? 
or did it lay untouched on their plates? did they watch the re-
cap of the dayâ€™s events on the battered old tv that sits on the 
table against the wall? surely, there were more tears. is my 
mother holding up, being strong for prim? or has she already 
started to slip away, leaving the weight of the world on my sis-
terâ€™s fragile shoulders? 
prim will undoubtedly sleep with my mother tonight. the 
thought of that s

for a moment, what it must be like inside that womanâ€™s head. 
what thoughts fill her waking hours? what dreams come to 
her at night? i have no idea. 
i put the green outfit back on since itâ€™s not really dirty, just 
slightly crumpled from spending the night on the floor. my 
fingers trace the circle around the little gold mockingjay and i 
think of the woods, and of my father, and of my mother and 
prim waking up, having to get on with things.

i slept in the elaborate braided hair my mother did for the 
reaping and it doesnâ€™t look too bad, so i just leave it up. it 
doesnâ€™t matter. we canâ€™t be far from the capitol now. and 
once we reach the city, my stylist will dictate my look for the 
opening ceremonies tonight anyway. i just hope i get one who 
doesnâ€™t think nudity is the last word in fashion.

moment i slide into my chair iâ€™m served an enormous platter

in ice to keep it chilled. the basket of rolls they set before me 
would keep my family going for a week. thereâ€™s an elegant 
glass of orange juice. at least, i think itâ€™s orange juice. iâ€™ve only 
even tasted an orange once, at new yearâ€™s when my father 
bought one as a special treat. a cup of coffee. my mother 
adores coffee, which we could almost never afford, but it only 
tastes bitter and thin to me. a rich brown cup of something 
iâ€™ve never seen. 
â€œthey call it hot chocolate,â€ says peeta. â€œitâ€™s good.â€ 
i take a sip of the hot, sweet, creamy liquid and a shudder 
runs through me. even though the rest of the meal beckons, i 
ignore it until iâ€™ve drained my cup. then i stuff down every 
mouthful i can hold, which is a substantial amount, being care-

effie and haymitch is bound to be a disaster. besides, din-
ner isnâ€™t really about food, itâ€™s about planning out our strate-
gies, and cinna and portia have already proven how valuable 
they are. 
a silent young man dressed in a white tunic offers us all 
stemmed glasses of wine. i think about turning it down, but 
iâ€™ve never had wine, except the homemade stuff my mother 
uses for coughs, and when will i get a chance to try it again? i 
take a sip of the tart, dry liquid and secretly think it could be 
improved by a few spoonfuls of honey. 
haymitch shows up just as dinner is being served. it looks 
as if heâ€™s had his own stylist because heâ€™s clean and groomed 
and about as sober as iâ€™ve ever seen him. he doesnâ€™t refuse the 
offer of wine, but when he starts in on his soup, i realize itâ€™s 
the first time iâ€™ve ever seen him eat. maybe he really will p

peeta raises his eyebrows as if this is news. but after 
watching him lie so smoothly, i donâ€™t give this much weight. 
â€œreally? well, he likes you and your sister. i think he wishes 
he had a daughter instead of a houseful of boys.â€ 
the idea that i might ever have been discussed, around the 
dinner table, at the bakery fire, just in passing in peetaâ€™s house 
gives me a start. it must have been when the mother was out 
of the room.

in town,â€ i say. it seems impolite to say she never mentioned 
the baker except to compliment his bread.

morning then.â€ 
â€œsee you,â€ he says, and walks off down the hall.

who canâ€™t speak. but i can feel her eyes staring at me, piercing 
through walls and doors and bedding. 
i wonder if sheâ€™ll enjoy watching me die.

  my slumbers are filled with disturbing dreams. the face of 
the redheaded girl intertwines with gory images from earlier 
hunger games, with my mother withdrawn and unreachable, 
with prim emaciated and terrified. i bolt up screaming for my 
father to run as the mine explodes into a million deadly bits of 
light. dawn is breaking through the windows. the capitol has a 
misty, haunted air. my head aches and i must have bitten into 
the side of my cheek in the night. my tongue probes the 
ragged flesh and i taste blood. 
slowly, i drag myself out of bed and into the shower. i arbi-
trarily punch buttons on the control board and end up hop-

i can serve myself, he nods assent. i load a plate with eggs, 
sausages, batter cakes covered in thick orange preserves, slic-

over the capitol. i have a second plate of hot grain smothered 
in beef stew. finally, i fill a plate with rolls and sit at the table, 
breaking oil bits and dipping them into hot chocolate, the way 
peeta did on the train. 
my mind wanders to my mother and prim. they must be 
up. my mother getting their breakfast of mush. prim milking 
her goat before school. just two mornings ago, i was home. 
can that be right? yes, just two. and now how empty the 
house feels, even from a distance. what did they say last night 
about my fiery debut at the games? did it give them hope, or 
simply add to their terror when they saw the reality of twen-
ty-four tributes circled together, knowing only one could live?

â€œwhat use is that? how many times have you seen someone 
wrestle someone to death?â€ says peeta in disgust. 
â€œthereâ€™s always hand-to-hand combat. all you need is to 
come up with a knife, and youâ€™ll at least stand a chance. if i get 
jumped, iâ€™m dead!â€ i can hear my voice rising in anger. 
â€œbut you wonâ€™t! youâ€™ll be living up in some tree eating raw 
squirrels and picking off people with arrows. you know what 
my mother said to me when she came to say good-bye, as if to 
cheer me up, she says maybe district twelve will finally have 
a winner. then i realized, she didnâ€™t mean me, she meant 
you!â€ bursts out peeta. 
â€œoh, she meant you,â€ i say with a wave of dismissal. 
â€œshe said, â€˜sheâ€™s a survivor, that one.â€™ she is,â€ says peeta. 
that pulls me up short. did his mother really say that about 
me? did she rate me over her son? i see the pain in peetaâ€™s 
eyes and know he isnâ€™t lying.

â€œthanks. i will,â€ he says. â€œyou . . . shoot straight.â€ 
i nod. i donâ€™t know why i said anything at all. although if 
iâ€™m going to lose, iâ€™d rather peeta win than the others. better 
for our district, for my mother and prim. 
after about fifteen minutes, they call my name. i smooth my 
hair, set my shoulders back, and walk into the gymnasium. in-

wasnâ€™t trying to kill one of them. if i were, theyâ€™d be dead! 
oh, what does it matter? itâ€™s not like i was going to win the 
games anyway. who cares what they do to me? what really 
scares me is what they might do to my mother and prim, how 
my family might suffer now because of my impulsiveness. will 
they take their few belongings, or send my mother to prison

â€œand what did you say?â€ prompts caesar gently. 
but instead of warmth, i feel an icy rigidity take over my 
body. my muscles tense as they do before a kill. when i speak, 
my voice seems to have dropped an octave. â€œi swore i would.â€ 
â€œi bet you did,â€ says caesar, giving me a squeeze. the buzz-
er goes off. â€œsorry weâ€™re out of time. best of luck, katniss

the applause continues long after iâ€™m seated. i look to cin-
na for reassurance. he gives me a subtle thumbs-up.

iâ€™m still in a daze for the first part of peetaâ€™s interview. he 
has the audience from the get-go, though; i can hear them 
laughing, shouting out. he plays up the bakerâ€™s son thing, 
comparing the tributes to the breads from their districts. then 
has a funny anecdote about the perils of the capitol showers.

peeta shakes his head. â€œnot until now.â€ 
i allow my eyes to flicker up to the screen long enough to 
see that the blush on my cheeks is unmistakable. 
â€œwouldnâ€™t you love to pull her back out here and get a re-
sponse?â€ caesar asks the audience. the crowd screams assent. 
â€œsadly, rules are rules, and katniss everdeenâ€™s time has been 
spent. well, best of luck to you, peeta mellark, and i think i

itâ€™s like a slap in the face. his use of haymitchâ€™s patronizing 
endearment. â€œlook, if you want to spend the last hours of your 
life planning some noble death in the arena, thatâ€™s your choice. 
i want to spend mine in district twelve.â€ 
â€œwouldnâ€™t surprise me if you do,â€ says peeta. â€œgive my 
mother my best when you make it back, will you?â€ 
â€œcount on it,â€ i say. then i turn and leave the roof. i spend 
the rest of the night slipping in and out of a doze, imagining 
the cutting remarks i will make to peeta mellark in the morn-

iâ€™m relieved peetaâ€™s alive. i tell myself again that if i get 
killed, his winning will benefit my mother and prim the most. 
this is what i tell myself to explain the conflicting emotions 
that arise when i think of peeta. the gratitude that he gave me

my hands in the water, examining the little flames on my fin-

fire for a lifetime. 
i bathe the blood and ash from my face. i try to recall all i 
know about burns. they are common injuries in the seam 
where we cook and heat our homes with coal. then there are 
the mine accidents. . . . a family once brought in an uncons-
cious young man pleading with my mother to help him. the 
district doctor whoâ€™s responsible for treating the miners had 
written him off, told the family to take him home to die. but 
they wouldnâ€™t accept this. he lay on our kitchen table, sense-
less to the world. i got a glimpse of the wound on his thigh, 
gaping, charred flesh, burned clear down to the bone, before i 
ran from the house. i went to the woods and hunted the entire 
day, haunted by the gruesome leg, memories of my fatherâ€™s 
death. whatâ€™s funny was, prim, whoâ€

of me. 
i almost faint at the sight of my calf. the flesh is a brilliant 
red covered with blisters. i force myself to take deep, slow 
breaths, feeling quite certain the cameras are on my face. i

this medicine must be astronomical. probably not one but 
many sponsors have contributed to buy this one tiny pot. to 
me, it is priceless. 
i dip two fingers in the jar and gently spread the balm over 
my calf. the effect is almost magical, erasing the pain on con-
tact, leaving a pleasant cooling sensation behind. this is no 
herbal concoction that my mother grinds up out of woodland 
plants, itâ€™s high-tech medicine brewed up in the capitolâ€™s labs. 
when my calf is treated, i rub a thin layer into my hands. after 
wrapping the pot in the parachute, i nestle it safely away in 
my pack. now that the pain has eased, itâ€™s all i can do to repo-
sition myself in my bag before i plunge into sleep. 
a bird perched just a few feet from me alerts me that a new 
day is dawning. in the gray morning light, i examine my hands.

my fatherâ€™s death. and then there are my wounds to contend 
with â€” burns, cuts, and bruises from smashing into the trees, 
and three tracker jacker stings, which are as sore and swollen 
as ever. i treat my burns with the ointment and try dabbing a 
bit on my stings as well, but it has no effect on them. my

could draw out the poison, but she seldom had cause to use it,

rue tentatively steps out into the open. â€œi can fix your 
stings.â€ 
â€œcan you?â€ i ask. â€œhow?â€ 
she digs in the pack she carries and pulls out a handful of 
leaves. iâ€™m almost certain theyâ€™re the ones my mother uses. 
â€œwhereâ€™d you find those?â€ 
â€œjust around. we all carry them when we work in the orc-

chewed leaves and spit on my knee.

somehow worried. about rue being killed, about rue not be-

rue alone, about leaving prim alone back home. no, prim has 
my mother and gale and a baker who has promised she wonâ€™t

leaves he sighs in relief. while he dries in the sun, i wash his 
filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. then i 
apply the burn cream to his chest. this is when i notice how 
hot his skin is becoming. the layer of mud and the bottles of 
water have disguised the fact that heâ€™s burning with fever. i 
dig through the first-aid kit i got from the boy from district 1 
and find pills that reduce your temperature. my mother ac-

home remedies fail.

medicine. â€œyou must be hungry.â€ 
â€œnot really. itâ€™s funny, i havenâ€™t been hungry for days,â€ says 
peeta. in fact, when i offer him groosling, he wrinkles his nose 
at it and turns away. thatâ€™s when i know how sick he is.

skill nor the courage to face. but thereâ€™s no one here but me. i 
try to capture the calm demeanor my mother assumes when 
handling particularly bad cases. 
â€œpretty awful, huh?â€ says peeta. heâ€™s watching me closely. 
â€œso-so.â€ i shrug like itâ€™s no big deal. â€œyou should see some of 
the people they bring my mother from the mines.â€ i refrain 
from saying how i usually clear out of the house whenever

iâ€™ve left on peetaâ€™s undershorts because theyâ€™re not in bad 
shape and i donâ€™t want to pull them over the swollen thigh 
and, all right, maybe the idea of him being naked makes me 
uncomfortable. thatâ€™s another thing about my mother and 
prim. nakedness has no effect on them, gives them no cause 
for embarrassment. ironically, at this point in the games, my 
little sister would be of far more use to peeta than i am. i scoot 
my square of plastic under him so i can wash down the rest of 
him. with each bottle i pour over him, the worse the wound 
looks. the rest of his lower body has fared pretty well, just

after three applications and what seems like a bucket of 
pus, the wound does look better. now that the swelling has 
gone down, i can see how deep catoâ€™s sword cut. right down 
to the bone. 
â€œwhat next, dr. everdeen?â€ he asks. 
â€œmaybe iâ€™ll put some of the burn ointment on it. i think it 
helps with infection anyway. and wrap it up?â€ i say. i do and 
the whole thing seems a lot more manageable, covered in 
clean white cotton. although, against the sterile bandage, the 
hem of his undershorts looks filthy and teeming with conta-

â€œyes, thatâ€™s a good plan,â€ he says. but i feel this is mostly for 
my benefit. 
â€œyou have to eat. keep your strength up. iâ€™m going to make 
you soup,â€ i say. 
â€œdonâ€™t light a fire,â€ he says. â€œitâ€™s not worth it.â€

struck by how brutally hot it is. i swear the g

gale offered to carry her. i think he wanted to see the look 
on primâ€™s face as much as i did. in a moment of complete gid-
diness, i bought a pink ribbon and tied it around her neck. 
then we hurried back to my house. 
you should have seen primâ€™s reaction when we walked in 
with that goat. remember this is a girl who wept to save that 
awful old cat, buttercup. she was so excited she started crying 
and laughing all at once. my mother was less sure, seeing the 
injury, but the pair of them went to work on it, grinding up 
herbs and coaxing brews down the animalâ€™s throat. 
â€œthey sound like you,â€ says peeta. i had almost forgotten he 
was there. 
â€œoh, no, peeta. they work magic. that thing couldnâ€™t have 
died if it tried,â€ i say. but then i bite my tongue, realizing what 
that must sound like to peeta, who is dying, in my incompe-
tent hands. 
â€œdonâ€™t worry. iâ€™m not trying,â€ he jokes. â€œfinish the story.â€

eta! itâ€™s such a tiny vial 
though. it must be very strong to cure someone as ill as peeta. 
a ripple of doubt runs through me. i uncork the vial and take a 
deep sniff. my spirits fall at the sickly sweet scent. just to be 
sure, i place a drop on the tip of my tongue. thereâ€™s no ques-
tion, itâ€™s sleep syrup. itâ€™s a common medicine in district 12. 
cheap, as medicine goes, but very addictive. almost every-
oneâ€™s had a dose at one time or another. we have some in a 
bottle at home. my mother gives it to hysterical patients to 
knock them out to stitch up a bad wound or quiet their minds 
or just to help someone in pain get through the night. it only 
takes a little. a vial this size could knock peeta out for a full 
day, but what good is that? iâ€™m so furious iâ€™m about to throw 
haymitchâ€™s last offering into the stream when it hits me. a full 
day? thatâ€™s more than i need. 
i mash up a handful of berries so the taste wonâ€™t be as noti-
ceable and add some mint leaves for goo

head back up to the cave. â€œiâ€™ve brought you a treat. i found a 
new patch of berries a little farther downstream.â€ 
peeta opens his mouth for the first bite without hesitation. 
he swallows then frowns slightly. â€œtheyâ€™re very sweet.â€

â€œyes, theyâ€™re sugar berries. my mother makes jam from 
them. havenâ€™t you ever had them before?â€ i say, poking the 
next spoonful in his mouth. 
â€œno,â€ he says, almost puzzled. â€œbut they taste familiar. sug-
ar berries?â€ 
â€œwell, you canâ€™t get them in the market much, they only 
grow wild,â€ i say. another mouthful goes down. just one more 
to go. 
â€œtheyâ€™re sweet as syrup,â€ he says, taking the last spoonful. 
â€œsyrup.â€ his eyes widen as he realizes the truth. i clamp my 
hand over his mouth and nose hard, forci

n air across the arena, which may be 
exactly what theyâ€™ve done. i lay next to peeta in the bag, trying 
to absorb every bit of his fever heat. itâ€™s strange to be so phys-
ically close to someone whoâ€™s so distant. peeta might as well 
be back in the capitol, or in district 12, or on the moon right 
now, heâ€™d be no harder to reach. iâ€™ve never felt lonelier since 
the games began. 
just  accept  it  will  be  a  bad  night, i tell myself. i try not to, 
but i canâ€™t help thinking of my mother and prim, wondering if 
theyâ€™ll sleep a wink tonight. at this late stage in the games, 
with an important event like the feast, school will probably be 
canceled. my family can either watch on that static-filled old

of time. it might be because it reminds me too much of my fa-
ther. â€œso that day, in music assembly, the teacher asked who 
knew the valley song. your hand shot right up in the air. she 
stood you up on a stool and had you sing it for us. and i swear, 
every bird outside the windows fell silent,â€ peeta says. 
â€œoh, please,â€ i say, laughing. 
â€œno, it happened. and right when your song ended, i knew 
â€” just like your mother â€” i was a goner,â€ peeta says. â€œthen 
for the next eleven years, i tried to work up the nerve to talk 
to you.â€ 
â€œwithout success,â€ i add. 
â€œwithout success. so, in a way, my name being drawn in the 
reaping was a real piece of luck,â€ says peeta. 
for a moment, iâ€™m almost foolishly happy and then confu-
sion sweeps over me. because weâ€™re supposed to be making 
up this stuff, playing at being in love not actually being in love. 
but peetaâ€™s story has a ring of truth to it. th

week of prepara-
tion in the capitol. maybe the moon has completed its cycle. 
for some reason, i badly want it to be my moon, the same one 
i see from the woods around district 12. that would give me 
something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where 
the authenticity of everything is to be doubted. 
four of us left. 
for the first time, i allow myself to truly think about the 
possibility that i might make it home. to fame. to wealth. to 
my own house in the victorâ€™s village. my mother and prim 
would live there with me. no more fear of hunger. a new kind 
of freedom. but then . . . what? what would my life be like on a

daily basis? most of it has been consumed with the acquisition 
of food. take that away and iâ€™m not really sure who i am, what 
my identity is. the idea scares me some. i think of haymitch, 
with all his money. what did his life become? he lives alone, 
no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. i donâ€™t 
want to end up like that.

€œbut you wonâ€™t be alone,â€ i whisper to myself. i have my 
mother and prim. well, for the time being. and then . . . i donâ€™t 
want to think about then, when prim has grown up, my moth-
er passed away. i know iâ€™ll never marry, never risk bringing a 
child into the world. because if thereâ€™s one thing being a victor 
doesnâ€™t guarantee, itâ€™s your childrenâ€™s safety. my kidsâ€™ names 
would go right into the reaping balls with everyone elseâ€™s. and 
i swear iâ€™ll never let that happen.

ing beyond control. 
peetaâ€™s face is gray in the pale moonlight. i make him lie 
down before i probe his wound. warm, slippery blood runs 
over my fingers. a bandage will not be enough. iâ€™ve seen my 
mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate 
it. i cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his 
leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. i donâ€™t have a stick, 
so i take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twist-
ing it as tightly as i dare. itâ€™s risky business â€” peeta may end 
up losing his leg â€” but when i weigh this against him losing 
his life, what alternative do i have? i bandage the wound in 
the rest of my shirt and lay down with him.

bye, and we begin counting. â€œone.â€ maybe iâ€™m wrong. â€œtwo.â€ 
maybe they donâ€™t care if we both die. â€œthree!â€ itâ€™s too late to 
change my mind. i lift my hand to my mouth, taking one last 
look at the world. the berries have just passed my lips when 
the trumpets begin to blare. 
the frantic voice of claudius templesmith shouts above 
them. â€œstop! stop! ladies and gentlemen, i am pleased to 
present the victors of the seventy-fourth hunger games, kat-
niss everdeen and peeta mellark! i give you â€” the tributes of 
district twelve!â€

  i spew the berries from my mouth, wiping my tongue with 
the end of my shirt to make sure no juice remains. peeta pulls 
me to the lake where we both flush our mouths with water 
and then collapse into each otherâ€™s arms. 
â€œyou didnâ€™t swallow any?â€ i ask him. 
he shakes his head. â€œyou?â€ 
â€œguess iâ€™d be dead by now if i did,â€ i say. i can see his lips 
moving in reply, but i canâ€™t hear hi

peeta, their brows creased in concentration. i see the flow of 
liquids, pumping through the tubes, watch a wall of dials and 
lights that mean nothing to me. iâ€™m not sure, but i think his 
heart stops twice. 
itâ€™s like being home again, when they bring in the hopeless-
ly mangled person from the mine explosion, or the woman in 
her third day of labor, or the famished child struggling against 
pneumonia and my mother and prim, they wear that same 
look on their faces. now is the time to run away to the woods, 
to hide in the trees until the patient is long gone and in anoth-

pushes him aside without even glancing at him. the audience 
goes berserk. whether he knows or not, peeta is, as usual, 
playing the crowd exactly right. 
finally, haymitch interrupts us and gives us a good-natured 
shove toward the victorâ€™s chair. usually, this is a single, ornate 
chair from which the winning tribute watches a film of the 
highlights of the games, but since there are two of us, the ga-
memakers have provided a plush red velvet couch. a small 
one, my mother would call it a love seat, i think. i sit so close 
to peeta that iâ€™m practically on his lap, but one look from 
haymitch tells me it isnâ€™t enough. kicking off my sandals, i 
tuck my feet to the side and lean my head against peetaâ€™s 
shoulder. his arm goes around me automatically, and i feel 
like iâ€™m back in the cave, curled up against him, trying to keep 
warm. his shirt is made of the same yellow material as my 
dress, but portiaâ€™s put him in long black pants. no sandals, ei-

alien. when the train makes a brief stop for fuel, weâ€™re allowed to 
go outside for some fresh air. thereâ€™s no longer any need to 
guard us. peeta and i walk down along the track, hand in hand, 
and i canâ€™t find anything to say now that weâ€™re alone. he stops
