Sir John Falstaff - 
      Usually called Falstaff but sometimes called Jack. A fat, cheerful, witty, aging criminal, he has long been Prince Hal's mentor and close friend. He pretended to have killed Hotspur at the Battle of Shrewsbury, and Prince Hal--the actual killer--agreed to go along with the lie. For this reason, everyone gives Falstaff much more respect than he deserves.
