    as plays the sun upon the glassy streams,

    fain would i woo her, yet i dare not speak.
    i'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.
    fie, de la pole! disable not thyself;
    hast not a tongue? is she not here thy prisoner?
    wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?
    ay, beauty's princely majesty is such
    confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.
  margaret. say, earl of suffolk, if thy name be so,
    what ransom must i pay before i pass?
    for i perceive i am thy prisoner.
  suffolk.  [aside]  how canst thou tell she will deny thy
    suit,
    before thou make a trial of her love?
  margaret. why speak'st thou not? what ransom must i
    pay?
  suffolk.  [aside]  she's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;
    she is a woman, therefore to be won.

  suffolk.  [aside]  and yet a dispensation may be had.
  margaret. and yet i would that you would answer me.
  suffolk.  [aside]  i'll win this lady margaret. for whom?
    why, for my king! tush, that's a wooden thing!
  margaret. he talks of wood. it is some carpenter.
  suffolk.  [aside]  yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
    and peace established between these realms.
    but there remains a scruple in that too;
    for though her father be the king of naples,
    duke of anjou and maine, yet is he poor,
    and our nobility will scorn the match.

  suffolk. lady, vouchsafe to listen what i say.
  margaret.  [aside]  perhaps i shall be rescu'd by the french;
    and then i need not crave his courtesy.
  suffolk. sweet madam, give me hearing in a cause--
  margaret.  [aside]  tush! women have been captivate ere
    now.
  suffolk. lady, wherefore talk you so?
  margaret. i cry you mercy, 'tis but quid for quo.
  suffolk. say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
    your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
  margaret. to be a queen in bondage is more vile
    than is a slave in base servility;
    for princes should be free.
  suffolk. and so shall you,
    if happy england's royal king be free.
  margaret. why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
  suffolk. i'll undertake to make thee henry's queen,
    to put a golden sceptre in thy hand

    to woo so fair a dame to be his wife
    and have no portion in the choice myself.
    how say you, madam? are ye so content?
  margaret. an if my father please, i am content.

    her father is no better than an earl,

  suffolk. yes, my lord, her father is a king,
    the king of naples and jerusalem;

    as his alliance will confirm our peace,
    and keep the frenchmen in allegiance.

    not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
    must be companion of his nuptial bed.
    and therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
    it most of all these reasons bindeth us
    in our opinions she should be preferr'd;
    for what is wedlock forced but a hell,
    an age of discord and continual strife?
    whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
    and is a pattern of celestial peace.
    whom should we match with henry, being a king,
    but margaret, that is daughter to a king?
    her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
    approves her fit for none but for a king;
    her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
    more than in women commonly is seen,
    will answer our hope in issue of a king;
    for henry, son unto a conqueror,
    is likely to beget more conquerors,
    if with a lady of so high resolve
    as is fair margaret he be link'd in love.
    then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
    that margaret s

    my noble lord of suffolk, or for that
    my tender youth was never yet attaint
    with any passion of inflaming love,
    i cannot tell; but this i am assur'd,
    i feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
    such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
