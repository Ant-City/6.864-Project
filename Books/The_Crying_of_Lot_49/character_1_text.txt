 forgotten. the shadow waited a year before visiting. but now there was metzger's letter. had pierce called last 
year then to tell her about this codicil? or had he decided on it later, somehow because of her annoyance and mucho's in-

"i don't believe in any of it, oed," he could usually get out. "i try, i truly can't," way down there, further down perhaps than
