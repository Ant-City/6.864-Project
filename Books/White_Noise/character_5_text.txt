frame and had big hands and feet, i knew my german lessons would have to be secret.

i contacted a man not affiliated with the college, someone murray jay siskind had told me about.
they were fellow boarders in the green-shingled house on middlebrook. the man was in his fifties, a slight
shuffle in his walk. he had thinning hair, a bland face and wore his shirtsleeves rolled up to his forearms,
revealing thermal underwear beneath.

his complexion was of a tone i want to call flesh-colored. howard dunlop was his name. he said
he was a former chiropractor but didn't offer a reason why he was no longer active and didn't say when
he'd learned german, or why, and something in his manner kept me from asking.

we sat in his dark crowded room at the boarding house. an ironing board stood unfolded at the
window.  there  were  chipped  enamel  pots,  trays  of  utensils  set  on  a  dresser.  the  furniture  was  vague,
foundling. at the borders of the room were the elemental things. an exposed radiator

s were covered with leaves. leaves came tumbling and scraping down the pitched
roofs. there were periods in every day when a stiff wind blew, baring the trees further, and retired men
appeared  in  the  backyards,  on  the  small  lawns  out  front,  carrying  rakes  with  curved  teeth.  black  bags
were arrayed at the curbstone in lopsided rows.

i  went  to  german  lessons  twice  a  week,  in  the  late  afternoon,  darkness  crowding  in  earlier  with  each
succeeding visit. it was howard dunlop's working rule that we sit facing each other during the full length of
the  lesson.  he  wanted  me  to  study  his  tongue  positions  as  he  demonstrated  the  pronunciation  of
consonants,  diphthongs,  long  and  short  vowels.  he  in  turn  would  look  closely  into  my  mouth  as  i

a series of frightened children appeared at our door for their halloween treats.

the déjà vu crisis centers closed down. the hotline was quietly discontinued. people seemed on
the verge of forgetting. i could hardly blame them even if i felt abandoned to a certain extent, left holding
the bag.

i  went  faithfully  to  german  lessons.  i  began  to  work  with  my  teacher  on  things  i  might  say  in
welcoming  delegates  to  the  hitler  conference,  still  a  number  of  weeks  off.  the  windows  were  totally
blocked by furniture and debris. howard dunlop sat in the middle of the room, his oval face floating in sixty
watts of dusty light. i began to suspect i was the only person he ever talked to. i also began to suspect he
needed me more than i needed him. a disconcerting and terrible thought.

"except for my eyes," i said.
"what do you mean?"
"chakravarty thinks i ought to see an eye man."
"is it the colored spots again?"
"yes."
"stop wearing those dark glasses."
"i can't teach hitler without them."
"why not?"
"i need them, that's all."
"they'

in my ear, "he looks like a man who finds dead bodies erotic."
i went to one last lesson. the walls and windows were obscured by accumulated objects, which

seemed now to be edging toward the middle of the room. the bland-faced man before me closed his eyes
and spoke, reciting useful tourist phrases. "where am i?"
"can you help me?"


"it is night and i am lost." i could hardly bear to sit there. murray's remark fixed him forever to a
plausible identity. what had been elusive about howard dunlop was now pinned down. what had been
strange  and  half  creepy  was  now  diseased.  a  grim  lasciviousness  escaped  his  body  and  seemed  to
circulate through the barricaded room.

in truth  i would  miss  the lessons. i would also  miss the dogs,  the german shepherds. one day
they were simply gone. needed elsewhere perhaps or sent back to the desert to sharpen their skills. the
men in mylex suits were still around, however, carrying instruments to measure and probe, riding through
town in
