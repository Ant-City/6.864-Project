isgracin‘ the family. scout… i’m scared.”
“scared’a what?”
“scared about atticus. somebody might hurt him.” jem preferred to remain
mysterious; all he would say to my questions was go on and leave him alone.
next day was sunday. in the interval between sunday school and church when
the congregation stretched its legs, i saw atticus standing in the yard with another
knot of men. mr. heck tate was present, and i wondered if he had seen the light.
he never went to church. even mr. underwood was there. mr. underwood had
no use for any organization but the maycomb tribune, of which he was the sole
owner, editor, and printer. his days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed
himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. he rarely
gathered news; people brought it to him. it was said that he made up every edition
of the maycomb tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype.
this was believable. something must have been up to haul mr. underwo

rs in the maycomb bank building.
when we rounded the corner of the square, we saw the car parked in front of the
bank. “he’s in there,” said jem.
but he wasn’t. his office was reached by a long hallway. looking down the hall,
we should have seen atticus finch, attorney-at-law in small sober letters against
the light from behind his door. it was dark.
jem peered in the bank door to make sure. he turned the knob. the door was
locked. “let’s go up the street. maybe he’s visitin‘ mr. underwood.”
mr. underwood not only ran the maycomb tribune office, he lived in it. that is,
above it. he covered the courthouse and jailhouse news simply by looking out his
upstairs window. the office building was on the northwest corner of the square,
and to reach it we had to pass the jail.

the maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county’s buildings.
atticus said it was like something cousin joshua st. clair might have designed. it
was certainly someone’s dream. starkly out of

s sleeve. “can we go home now?”
he nodded, produced his handkerchief, gave his face a going-over and blew his
nose violently.
“mr. finch?”
a soft husky voice came from the darkness above: “they gone?”
atticus stepped back and looked up. “they’ve gone,” he said. “get some sleep,
tom. they won’t bother you any more.”
from a different direction, another voice cut crisply through the night: “you’re
damn tootin‘ they won’t. had you covered all the time, atticus.”
mr. underwood and a double-barreled shotgun were leaning out his window

above the maycomb tribune office.
it was long past my bedtime and i was growing quite tired; it seemed that atticus
and mr. underwood would talk for the rest of the night, mr. underwood out the
window and atticus up at him. finally atticus returned, switched off the light
above the jail door, and picked up his chair.
“can i carry it for you, mr. finch?” asked dill. he had not said a word the whole
time.
“why, thank you, son.”

gan crying. jem was awfully nice

about it: for once he didn’t remind me that people nearly nine years old didn’t do
things like that.
everybody’s appetite was delicate this morning, except jem’s: he ate his way
through three eggs. atticus watched in frank admiration; aunt alexandra sipped
coffee and radiated waves of disapproval. children who slipped out at night were
a disgrace to the family. atticus said he was right glad his disgraces had come
along, but aunty said, “nonsense, mr. underwood was there all the time.”
“you know, it’s a funny thing about braxton,” said atticus. “he despises
negroes, won’t have one near him.”
local opinion held mr. underwood to be an intense, profane little man, whose
father in a fey fit of humor christened braxton bragg, a name mr. underwood had
done his best to live down. atticus said naming people after confederate generals
made slow steady drinkers.
calpurnia was serving aunt alexandra more coffee, and she shook her head at

my stomach. “all right,” she
said, and got a cup from the sideboard. she poured one tablespoonful of coffee
into it and filled the cup to the brim with milk. i thanked her by sticking out my
tongue at it, and looked up to catch aunty’s warning frown. but she was frowning
at atticus.
she waited until calpurnia was in the kitchen, then she said, “don’t talk like that
in front of them.”
“talk like what in front of whom?” he asked.
“like that in front of calpurnia. you said braxton underwood despises negroes
right in front of her.”
“well, i’m sure cal knows it. everybody in maycomb knows it.”
i was beginning to notice a subtle change in my father these days, that came out
when he talked with aunt alexandra. it was a quiet digging in, never outright
irritation. there was a faint starchiness in his voice when he said, “anything fit to
say at the table’s fit to say in front of calpurnia. she knows what she means to
this family.”

 state rested, judge taylor said, “it’s
time we all did. we’ll take ten minutes.”
atticus and mr. gilmer met in front of the bench and whispered, then they left the
courtroom by a door behind the witness stand, which was a signal for us all to
stretch. i discovered that i had been sitting on the edge of the long bench, and i
was somewhat numb. jem got up and yawned, dill did likewise, and reverend

sykes wiped his face on his hat. the temperature was an easy ninety, he said.
mr. braxton underwood, who had been sitting quietly in a chair reserved for the
press, soaking up testimony with his sponge of a brain, allowed his bitter eyes to
rove over the colored balcony, and they met mine. he gave a snort and looked
away.
“jem,” i said, “mr. underwood’s seen us.”
“that’s okay. he won’t tell atticus, he’ll just put it on the social side of the
tribune.” jem turned back to dill, explaining, i suppose, the finer points of the
trial to him, but i wondered what they were. there

the room. so i done
what she told me, an‘ i was just reachin’ when the next thing i knows she—she’d
grabbed me round the legs, grabbed me round th‘ legs, mr. finch. she scared me
so bad i hopped down an’ turned the chair over—that was the only thing, only
furniture, ‘sturbed in that room, mr. finch, when i left it. i swear ’fore god.”
“what happened after you turned the chair over?”
tom robinson had come to a dead stop. he glanced at atticus, then at the jury,
then at mr. underwood sitting across the room.
“tom, you’re sworn to tell the whole truth. will you tell it?”
tom ran his hand nervously over his mouth.
“what happened after that?”
“answer the question,” said judge taylor. one-third of his cigar had vanished.
“mr. finch, i got down offa that chair an‘ turned around an’ she sorta jumped on
me.”
“jumped on you? violently?”
“no suh, she—she hugged me. she hugged me round the waist.”
this time judge taylor’s gavel came down with a bang,

in her hand.
judge taylor saw her and said, “it’s calpurnia, isn’t it?”
“yes sir,” she said. “could i just pass this note to mr. finch, please sir? it hasn’t
got anything to do with—with the trial.”
judge taylor nodded and atticus took the envelope from calpurnia. he opened it,
read its contents and said, “judge, i—this note is from my sister. she says my
children are missing, haven’t turned up since noon… i… could you—”
“i know where they are, atticus.” mr. underwood spoke up. “they’re right up
yonder in the colored balcony—been there since precisely one-eighteen p.m.”
our father turned around and looked up. “jem, come down from there,” he called.
then he said something to the judge we didn’t hear. we climbed across reverend
sykes and made our way to the staircase.
atticus and calpurnia met us downstairs. calpurnia looked peeved, but atticus
looked exhausted.
jem was jumping in excitement. “we’ve won, haven’t we?”
“i’ve no idea,”

scussed the subject again.
“what time is it, reverend?” he asked.
“gettin‘ on toward eight.”
i looked down and saw atticus strolling around with his hands in his pockets: he
made a tour of the windows, then walked by the railing over to the jury box. he
looked in it, inspected judge taylor on his throne, then went back to where he
started. i caught his eye and waved to him. he acknowledged my salute with a
nod, and resumed his tour.
mr. gilmer was standing at the windows talking to mr. underwood. bert, the
court reporter, was chain-smoking: he sat back with his feet on the table.
but the officers of the court, the ones present—atticus, mr. gilmer, judge taylor
sound asleep, and bert, were the only ones whose behavior seemed normal. i had
never seen a packed courtroom so still. sometimes a baby would cry out fretfully,
and a child would scurry out, but the grown people sat as if they were in church.
in the balcony, the negroes sat and stood around us with biblical patience.

a few more details, enabling the listener to repeat his version in turn, then
nothing to talk about until the maycomb tribune appeared the following
thursday. there was a brief obituary in the colored news, but there was also an
editorial.
mr. b. b. underwood was at his most bitter, and he couldn’t have cared less who
canceled advertising and subscriptions. (but maycomb didn’t play that way: mr.
underwood could holler till he sweated and write whatever he wanted to, he’d
still get his advertising and subscriptions. if he wanted to make a fool of himself
in his paper that was his business.) mr. underwood didn’t talk about miscarriages
of justice, he was writing so children could understand. mr. underwood simply
figured it was a sin to kill cr

ipples, be they standing, sitting, or escaping. he
likened tom’s death to the senseless slaughter of songbirds by hunters and
children, and maycomb thought he was trying to write an editorial poetical
enough to be reprinted in the montgomery advertiser.

how could this be so, i wondered, as i read mr. underwood’s editorial. senseless
killing—tom had been given due process of law to the day of his death; he had
been tried openly and convicted by twelve good men and true; my father had
fought for him all the way. then mr. underwood’s meaning became clear:
atticus had used every tool available to free men to save tom robinson, but in
the secret courts of men’s hearts atticus had no case. tom was a dead man the
minute mayella ewell opened her mouth and screamed.
