Mary Burton Gulliver
Gulliver's wife is mentioned only briefly at the beginning
of the novel and appears only for an instant at the conclusion.
Gulliver never thinks about Mary on his travels and never feels
guilty about his lack of attention to her. A dozen far more trivial
characters get much greater attention than she receives. She is,
in this respect, the opposite of Odysseus's wife Penelope in the Odyssey,
who is never far from her husband's thoughts and is the final destination
of his journey. Mary's neglected presence in Gulliver's narrative
gives her a certain claim to importance. It suggests that despite
Gulliver's curiosity about new lands and exotic races, he is virtually
indifferent to those people closest to him. His lack of interest
in his wife bespeaks his underdeveloped inner life. Gulliver is
a man of skill and knowledge in certain practical matters, but he
is disadvantaged in self-reflection, personal interactions, and
perhaps overall wisdom.
