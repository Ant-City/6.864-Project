which modern physics rests. one is albert einstein's general relativity, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the largest of scales: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies,
and beyond to the immense expanse of the universe itself. the other is quantum mechanics, which
provides a theoretical framework for understanding the universe on the smallest of scales: molecules,
atoms,  and  all  the  way  down  to  subatomic  particles  like  electrons  and  quarks.  through  years  of
research,  physicists  have  experimentally  confirmed  to  almost  unimaginable  accuracy  virtually  all
predictions  made  by  each  of  these  theories.  but  these  same  theoretical  tools  inexorably  lead  to
another  disturbing  conclusion:  as  they  are  currently  formulated,  general  relativity  and  quantum
mechanics cannot  both  be  right.  the  two  theories  underlying  the  tremendous  progress  of  physics

nt step further. for three decades, einstein sought a unified theory of physics, one that would
interweave  all  of  nature's  forces  and  material  constituents  within  a  single  theoretical  tapestry.  he
failed. now, at the dawn of the new millennium, proponents of string theory claim that the threads of
this elusive unified tapestry finally have been revealed. string theory has the potential to show that all
of the wondrous happenings in the universe—from the frantic dance of subatomic quarks to the stately
waltz of orbiting binary stars, from the primordial fireball of the big bang to the majestic swirl of
heavenly galaxies—are reflections of one grand physical principle, one master equation.

because these features of string theory require that we drastically change our understanding of
space, time, and matter, they will take some time to get used to, to sink in at a comfortable level. but

and neutrons, that is surrounded by a swarm of orbiting electrons.

for  a  while  many  physicists  thought  that  protons,  neutrons,  and  electrons  were  the  greeks'
"atoms."  but  in  1968  experimenters  at  the  stanford  linear accelerator  center,  making  use  of  the
increased capacity of technology to probe the microscopic depths of matter, found that protons and
neutrons are not fundamental, either. instead they showed that each consists of three smaller particles,
called quarks—a  whimsical  name  taken  from  a  passage  in  james  joyce's finnegans  wake  by  the
theoretical  physicist  murray  gell-mann,  who  previously  had  surmised  their  existence.  the
experimenters confirmed that quarks themselves come in two varieties, which were named, a bit less
creatively, up and down. a proton consists of two up-quarks and a down-quark; a neutron consists of
two down-quarks and an up-quark.

combinations of electrons, up-quarks, and down-quarks. no experimental evidence indicates that any
of these three particles is built up from something smaller. but a great deal of evidence indicates that
the  universe  itself  has  additional  particulate  ingredients.  in  the  mid-1950s,  frederick  reines  and
clyde cowan found conclusive experimental evidence for a fourth kind of fundamental particle called
a  neutrino—a  particle  whose  existence  was  predicted  in  the  early  1930s  by  wolfgang  pauli.

greeted the discovery of the muon with a less than enthusiastic "who ordered that?" nevertheless,
there it was. and more was to follow.

using ever more powerful technology, physicists have continued to slam bits of matter together
with  ever  increasing  energy,  momentarily  recreating  conditions  unseen  since  the  big  bang.  in  the
debris they have searched for new fundamental ingredients to add to the growing list of particles.
here  is  what  they  have  found:  four  more  quarks—charm,  strange,  bottom,  and top—and  another
even  heavier  cousin  of  the  electron,  called  a tau,  as  well  as  two  other  particles  with  properties
similar  to  the  neutrino  (called  the muon-neutrino  and tau-neutrino  to  distinguish  them  from  the
original  neutrino,  now  called  the electron-neutrino).  these  particles  are  produced  through  high-
energy  collisions  and  exist  only  ephemerally;  they  are  not  constituents  of  anything  we  typically
encounter.

annihilate one another to produce pure energy—that's why there is extremely little naturally occurring
antimatter in the world around us.

physicists have recognized a pattern among these particles, displayed in table 1.1. the matter
particles neatly fall into three groups, which are often called families. each family contains two of
the  quarks,  an  electron  or  one  of  its  cousins,  and  one  of  the  neutrino  species.  the  corresponding
particle types across the three families have identical properties except for their mass, which grows
larger in each successive family. the upshot is that physicists have now probed the structure of matter
to scales of about a billionth of a billionth of a meter and shown that everything encountered to date

a  glance  at  table  1.1  will  no  doubt  leave  you  with  an  even  stronger  sense  of  rabi's
bewilderment  at  the  discovery  of  the  muon.  the  arrangement  into  families  at  least  gives  some
semblance  of  order,  but  innumerable  "whys"  leap  to  the  fore.  why  are  there  so  many  fundamental
particles, especially when it seems that the great majority of things in the world around us need only
electrons, up-quarks, and down-quarks? why are there three families? why not one family or four
families or any other number? why do the particles have a seemingly random spread of masses—

why, for in-

stance, does the tau weigh about 3,520 times as much as an electron? why does the top quark
weigh about 40,200 times as much an up-quark? these are such strange, seemingly random numbers.

and force particles were even moderately changed. for example, the existence of the stable nuclei
forming the hundred or so elements of the periodic table hinges delicately on the ratio between the
strengths of the strong and electromagnetic forces. the protons crammed together in atomic nuclei all
repel  one  another  electromagnetically;  the  strong  force  acting  among  their  constituent  quarks,
thankfully, overcomes this repulsion and tethers the protons tightly together. but a rather small change
in  the  relative  strengths  of  these  two  forces  would  easily  disrupt  the  balance  between  them,  and
would cause most atomic nuclei to disintegrate. furthermore, were the mass of the electron a few
times greater than it is, electrons and protons would tend to combine to form neutrons, gobbling up the

with  an  ordinary  piece  of  matter,  an  apple,  and  repeatedly  magnifying  its  structure  to  reveal  its
ingredients on ever smaller scales. string theory adds the new microscopic layer of a vibrating loop
to the previously known progression from atoms through protons, neutrons, electrons and quarks.2

although it is by no means obvious, we will see in chapter 6 that this simple replacement of
point-particle  material  constituents  with  strings  resolves  the  incompatibility  between  quantum
mechanics  and  general  relativity.  string  theory  thereby  unravels  the  central  gordian  knot  of
contemporary theoretical physics. this is a tremendous achievement, but it is only part of the reason
string theory has generated such excitement.

string theory as the unified theory of everything

in  einstein's  day,  the  strong  and  the  weak  forces  had  not  yet  been  discovered,  but  he  found  the
existence of even two distinct forces—gravity and electromagnetism—deeply troubling. einstein did
not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. this launched his thirty-year voyage

physical principles at work, or whether the principles involved are derivative, relying, albeit in a

physics. although it would be hard to explain the properties of a tornado in terms of the physics of
electrons and quarks, i see this as a matter of calculational impasse, not an indicator of the need for
new physical laws. but again, there are some who disagree with this view.

what is largely beyond question, and is of primary importance to the journey described in this
book, is that even if one accepts the debatable reasoning of the staunch reductionist, principle is one

particles,  the  photon  carries  the  message  "move  apart,"  while  for  oppositely  charged  particles  it
carries  the  message  "come  together."  for  this  reason  the  photon  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the
messenger particle for the electromagnetic force. similarly, the gluons and weak gauge bosons are
the messenger particles for the strong and weak nuclear forces. the strong force, which keeps quarks
locked  up  inside  of  protons  and  neutrons,  arises  from  individual  quarks  exchanging  gluons.  the
gluons, so to speak, provide the "glue" that keeps these subatomic particles stuck together. the weak
force, which is responsible for certain kinds of particle transmutations involved in radioactive decay,
is mediated by the weak gauge bosons.

et's  consider  one  important
example. as we recorded in the table in endnote 1 of chapter 1, each quark comes in three "colors"
(fancifully called red, green, and blue, although these are merely labels and have no relation to color
in the usual visual sense), which determine how it responds to the strong force in much the same way
that its electric charge determines how it responds to the electromagnetic force. all the data that have
been collected establish that there is a symmetry among the quarks in the sense that the interactions
between  any  two  like-colored  quarks  (red  with  red,  green  with  green,  or  blue  with  blue)  are  all
identical,  and  similarly,  the  interactions  between  any  two  unlike-colored  quarks  (red  with  green,
green with blue, or blue with red) are also identical. in fact, the data support something even more
striking. if the three colors—the three different strong charges—that a quark can carry were all shifted
in a particular manner (roughly

speaking, in our fanciful chromatic language, if red, green, and blue

again,  completely  unchanged.  for  this  reason,  just  as  we  say  that  a  sphere  exemplifies  rotational
symmetry because it looks the same regardless of how we rotate it around in our hands or how we
shift the angle from which we view it, we say that the universe exemplifies strong force symmetry:

lly some whole number (1, 2, 3,. . .) times the planck mass. physicists often
express this by saying that the "natural" or "typical" energy scale (and hence mass scale) of string
theory is the planck scale.

this raises a crucial question directly related to the goal of reproducing the particle properties
in tables 1.1 and 1.2: if the "natural" energy scale of string theory is some ten billion billion times
that of a proton, how can it possibly account for the far-lighter particles—electrons, quarks, photons,
and so on—making up the world around us?

the answer, once again, comes from quantum mechanics. the uncertainty principle ensures that
nothing is ever perfectly at rest. all objects undergo quantum jitter, for if they didn't we would know
where  they  were  and  how  fast  they  were  moving  with  complete  precision,  in  violation  of
heisenberg's dictum. this holds true for the loops in string theory as well; no matter how placid a

supersymmetry, then every known particle must have an as-yet-undiscovered superpartner particle,
whose  spin  is  half  a  unit  less  than  its  known  counterpart.  for  instance,  there  should  be  a  spin-0
partner  of  the  electron;  this  hypothetical  particle  has  been  named  the selectron  (a  contraction  of
supersymmetric-electron).  the  same  should  also  be  true  for  the  other  matter  particles,  with,  for
example, the hypothetical spin-0 superpartners of neutrinos and quarks being called sneutrinos and
squarks. similarly, the force particles should have spin-1/2 superpartners: for photons there should
be photinos, for the gluons there should be gluinos, for the w and z bosons there should be winos and
zinos.

on  closer  inspection,  then,  supersymmetry  seems  to  be  a  terribly  uneconomical  feature;  it

another experimental signature of string theory, having to do with electric charge, is somewhat less
generic  than  superpartner  particles  but  equally  dramatic.  the  elementary  particles  of  the  standard
model have a very limited assortment of electric charges: the quarks and antiquarks have electric
charges of one-third or two-thirds, and their negatives, while the other particles have electric charges
of zero, one, or negative one. combinations of these particles account for all known matter in the
universe.  in  string  theory,  however,  it  is  possible  for  there  to  be  resonant  vibrational  patterns

that neutrinos do have a tiny but nonzero mass. second, there are certain hypothetical processes that
are forbidden by the standard model, but that may be allowed by string theory. among these are the
possible  disintegration  of  the  proton  (don't  worry,  such  disintegration,  if  true,  would  happen  very
slowly) and the possible transmutations and decays of various combinations of quarks, in violation of
certain long-established properties of point-particle quantum field theory.20 these kinds of processes
are  especially  interesting  because  their  absence  from  conventional  theory  makes  them  sensitive
signals  of  physics  that  cannot  be  accounted  for  without  invoking  new  theoretical  principles.  if

are there limits to explanation?

explaining everything, even in the circumscribed sense of understanding all aspects of the forces and
the elementary constituents of the universe, is one of the greatest challenges science has ever faced.
and for the first time, superstring theory gives us a framework that appears to have sufficient depth to
meet  the  challenge.  but  will  we  ever  realize  the  promise  of  the  theory  fully  and,  for  example,
calculate the masses of the quarks or the strength of the electromagnetic force, numbers whose precise
values dictate so much about the universe? as in the previous sections, we will have to surmount
numerous theoretical hurdles on the way to these goals—currently, the most prominent is achieving a
full nonperturbative formulation of string/m-theory.
