  duke. so that, from point to point, now have you heard
    the fundamental reasons of this war;
    whose great decision hath much blood let forth
    and more thirsts after.
  first lord. holy seems the quarrel
    upon your grace's part; black and fearful

  bertram. nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though i know his
    brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
  first soldier. well, is this captain in the duke of florence's
    camp?
  parolles. upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
  second lord. nay, look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
    lordship anon.
  first soldier. what is his reputation with the duke?
  parolles. the duke knows him for no other but a poor officer of
    mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him out o' th'
band.
    i think i have his letter in my pocket.
  first soldier. marry, we'll search.
  parolles. in good sadness, i do not know; either it is there or
it
