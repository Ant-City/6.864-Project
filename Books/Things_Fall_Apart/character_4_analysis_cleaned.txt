mr.[CHARACTER]

mr.[CHARACTER] represents achebe's attempt to craft a well-rounded
portrait of the colonial presence by tempering bad personalities
with good ones. mr.[CHARACTER]'s successor, reverend smith, is zealous, vengeful,
small-minded, and manipulative; he thus stands in contrast to mr.
brown, who, on the other hand, is benevolent if not always beneficent.
mr.[CHARACTER] succeeds in winning a large number of converts because
he listens to the villagers' stories, beliefs, and opinions. he
also accepts the converts unconditionally. his conversation with
akunna represents this sympathetic stance. the derisive comments
that reverend smith makes about mr.[CHARACTER] after the latter's departure
illustrate the colonial intolerance for any kind of sympathy for,
and genuine interest in, the native culture. the surname[CHARACTER] hints
at his ability to navigate successfully the clear-cut racial division
between the colonizers and the colonized.
