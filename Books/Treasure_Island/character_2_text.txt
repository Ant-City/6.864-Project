since i now know there's such a
fellow in my district, you may count i'll have an eye upon you day and
night. i'm not a doctor only; i'm a magistrate; and if i catch a breath
of complaint against you, if it's only for a piece of incivility like
tonight's, i'll take effectual means to have you hunted down and routed
out of this. let that suffice."

soon after, dr. livesey's horse came to the door and he rode away, but
the captain held his peace that evening, and for many evenings to come.

black dog appears and disappears


it was not very long after this that there occurred the first of the
mysterious events that rid us at last of the captain, though not, as you
will see, of his affairs. it was a bitter cold winter, with long, hard
frosts and heavy gales; and it was plain from the first that my poor
father was little likely to see the spring. he sank daily, and my mother
and i had all the inn upon our hands, and were kept busy enough without
paying much regard to our unpleasant guest.

id the stranger in a voice that i thought he had tried to make
bold and big.

the captain spun round on his heel and fronted us; all the brown had
gone out of his face, and even his nose was blue; he had the look of a
man who sees a ghost, or the evil one, or something worse, if anything
can be; and upon my word, i felt sorry to see him all in a moment turn
so old and sick.

"come, bill, you know me; you know an old shipmate, bill, surely," said
the stranger.

the captain made a sort of gasp.

"black dog!" said he.

"and who else?" returned the other, getting more at his ease. "black
dog as ever was, come for to see his old shipmate billy, at the admiral
benbow inn. ah, bill, bill, we have seen a sight of times, us two, since
i lost them two talons," holding up his mutilated hand.

"now, look here," said the captain; "you've run me down; here i am;
well, then, speak up; what is it?"

"that's you, bill," returned black dog, "you're in the right of it,
billy. i'll have a glass of rum from this de

ar child here, as i've took
such a liking to; and we'll sit down, if you please, and talk square,
like old shipmates."

when i returned with the rum, they were already seated on either side
of the captain's breakfast-table--black dog next to the door and
sitting sideways so as to have one eye on his old shipmate and one, as i
thought, on his retreat.

he bade me go and leave the door wide open. "none of your keyholes for
me, sonny," he said; and i left them together and retired into the bar.

for a long time, though i certainly did my best to listen, i could hear
nothing but a low gattling; but at last the voices began to grow higher,
and i could pick up a word or two, mostly oaths, from the captain.

"no, no, no, no; and a

 we'll have a look at
the colour of your blood. jim," he said, "are you afraid of blood?"

"no, sir," said i.

"well, then," said he, "you hold the basin"; and with that he took his
lancet and opened a vein.

a great deal of blood was taken before the captain opened his eyes
and looked mistily about him. first he recognized the doctor with
an unmistakable frown; then his glance fell upon me, and he looked
relieved. but suddenly his colour changed, and he tried to raise
himself, crying, "where's black dog?"

"there is no black dog here," said the doctor, "except what you have
on your own back. you have been drinking rum; you have had a stroke,
precisely as i told you; and i have just, very much against my own will,
dragged you headforemost out of the grave. now, mr. bones--"

"that's not my name," he interrupted.

"much i care," returned the doctor. "it's the name of a buccaneer of my
acquaintance; and i call you by it for the sake of shortness, and what i
have to say to you is this; one glass o

moving his legs like so much dead weight. his words, spirited as they
were in meaning, contrasted sadly with the weakness of the voice in
which they were uttered. he paused when he had got into a sitting
position on the edge.

"that doctor's done me," he murmured. "my ears is singing. lay me back."

before i could do much to help him he had fallen back again to his
former place, where he lay for a while silent.

"jim," he said at length, "you saw that seafaring man today?"

"black dog?" i asked.

"ah! black dog," says he. "he's a bad un; but there's worse that put him
on. now, if i can't get away nohow, and they tip me the black spot, mind
you, it's my old sea-chest they're after; you get on a horse--you can,
can't you? well, then, you get on a horse, and go to--well, yes,
i will!--to that eternal doctor swab, and tell him to pipe all
hands--magistrates and sich--and he'll lay 'em aboard at the admiral
benbow--all old flint's crew, man and boy, all on 'em that's left. i was

was to now, you see. but you won't peach unless they get the black spot
on me, or unless you see that black dog again or a seafaring man with
one leg, jim--him above all."

"but what is the black spot, captain?" i asked.

"that's a summons, mate. i'll tell you if they get that. but you keep
your weather-eye open, jim, and i'll share with you equals, upon my
honour."

he wandered a little longer, his voice growing weaker; but soon after i
had given him his medicine, which he took like a child, with the remark,
"if ever a seaman wanted drugs, it's me," he fell at last into a heavy,
swoon-like sleep, in whi

ers turned at once
and ran, separating in every direction, one seaward along the cove, one
slant across the hill, and so on, so that in half a minute not a sign of
them remained but pew. him they had deserted, whether in sheer panic
or out of revenge for his ill words and blows i know not; but there he
remained behind, tapping up and down the road in a frenzy, and groping
and calling for his comrades. finally he took a wrong turn and ran a few
steps past me, towards the hamlet, crying, "johnny, black dog, dirk,"
and other names, "you won't leave old pew, mates--not old pew!"

just then the noise of horses topped the rise, and four or five riders
came in sight in the moonlight and swept at full gallop down the slope.

at this pew saw his error, turned with a scream, and ran straight for
the ditch, into which he rolled. but he was on his feet again in a
second and made another dash, now utterly bewildered, right under the
nearest of the coming horses.

the rider tried to save him, but in vain. do

and smiling. indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling
as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the
shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.

now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of long john in
squire trelawney's letter i had taken a fear in my mind that he might
prove to be the very one-legged sailor whom i had watched for so long at
the old benbow. but one look at the man before me was enough. i had seen
the captain, and black dog, and the blind man, pew, and i thought i knew
what a buccaneer was like--a very different creature, according to me,
from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.

i plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up
to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.

"mr. silver, sir?" i asked, holding out the note.

"yes, my lad," said he; "such is my name, to be sure. and who may you
be?" and then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to me to g

"oh!" said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. "i see. you are our
new cabin-boy; pleased i am to see you."

and he took my hand in his large firm grasp.

just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made
for the door. it was close by him, and he was out in the street in a
moment. but his hurry had attracted my notice, and i recognized him at
glance. it was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come
first to the admiral benbow.

"oh," i cried, "stop him! it's black dog!"

"i don't care two coppers who he is," cried silver. "but he hasn't paid
his score. harry, run and catch him."

one of the others who was nearest the door leaped up and started in
pursuit.

"if he were admiral hawke he shall pay his score," cried silver; and
then, relinquishing my hand, "who did you say he was?" he asked. "black
what?"

"dog, sir," said i. "has mr. trelawney not told you of the buccaneers?
he was one of them."

"so?" cried silver. "in my house! ben, run and help harry. one of

 those
swabs, was he? was that you drinking with him, morgan? step up here."

the man whom he called morgan--an old, grey-haired, mahogany-faced
sailor--came forward pretty sheepishly, rolling his quid.

"now, morgan," said long john very sternly, "you never clapped your eyes
on that black--black dog before, did you, now?"

"not i, sir," said morgan with a salute.

"you didn't know his name, did you?"

"no, sir."

"by the powers, tom morgan, it's as good for you!" exclaimed the
landlord. "if you had been mixed up with the like of that, you would
never have put another foot in my house, you may lay to that. and what
was he saying to you?"

"i don't rightly know, sir," answered morgan.

"do you call that a head on your shoulders, or a blessed dead-eye?"
cried long john. "don't rightly know, d

o, perhaps? come, now, what
was he jawing--v'yages, cap'ns, ships? pipe up! what was it?"

"we was a-talkin' of keel-hauling," answered morgan.

"keel-hauling, was you? and a mighty suitable thing, too, and you may
lay to that. get back to your place for a lubber, tom."

and then, as morgan rolled back to his seat, silver added to me in a
confidential whisper that was very flattering, as i thought, "he's
quite an honest man, tom morgan, on'y stupid. and now," he ran on again,
aloud, "let's see--black dog? no, i don't know the name, not i. yet i
kind of think i've--yes, i've seen the swab. he used to come here with a
blind beggar, he used."

"that he did, you may be sure," said i. "i knew that blind man too. his
name was pew."

"it was!" cried silver, now quite excited. "pew! that were his name for
certain. ah, he looked a shark, he did! if we run down this black dog,
now, there'll be news for cap'n trelawney! ben's a good runner; few
seamen run better than ben. he should run him down, hand over

all the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and
down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving
such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge
or a bow street runner. my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on
finding black dog at the spy-glass, and i watched the cook narrowly. but
he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time
the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost
the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, i would have gone
bail for the innocence of long john silver.

"see here, now, hawkins," said he, "here's a blessed hard thing on a
man like me, now, ain't it? there's cap'n trelawney--what's he to think?

ee that here was one of the best of
possible shipmates.

when we got to the inn, the squire and dr. livesey were seated together,
finishing a quart of ale with a toast in it, before they should go
aboard the schooner on a visit of inspection.

long john told the story from first to last, with a great deal of spirit
and the most perfect truth. "that was how it were, now, weren't it,
hawkins?" he would say, now and again, and i could always bear him
entirely out.

the two gentlemen regretted that black dog had got away, but we all
agreed there was nothing to be done, and after he had been complimented,
long john took up his crutch and departed.

"all hands aboard by four this afternoon," shouted the squire after him.

"aye, aye, sir," cried the cook, in the passage.

"well, squire," said dr. livesey, "i don't put much faith in your
discoveries, as a general thing; but i will say this, john silver suits
me."

"the man's a perfect trump," declared the squire.

"and now," added the doctor, "jim may

believe you're the best man here, and if things go to the
worst, i'll take it kind of you to let the doctor know the way i took
it."

"i'll bear it in mind," said silver with an accent so curious that i
could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my
request or had been favourably affected by my courage.

"i'll put one to that," cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--morgan
by name--whom i had seen in long john's public-house upon the quays of
bristol. "it was him that knowed black dog."

"well, and see here," added the sea-cook. "i'll put another again to
that, by thunder! for it was this same boy that faked the chart from
billy bones. first and last, we've split upon jim hawkins!"

"then here goes!" said morgan with an oath.

and he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.

"avast, there!" cried silver. "who are you, tom morgan? maybe you
thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. by the powers, but i'll teach you
better! cross me, and you'll go where many a good ma
