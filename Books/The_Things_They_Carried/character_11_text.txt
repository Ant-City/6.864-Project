waves and gentle winds, all love and lightness.


what they carried varied by mission.
when  a  mission  took  them  to  the  mountains,  they  carried  mosquito

netting, machetes, canvas tarps, and extra bug juice.

if a mission seemed especially hazardous, or if it involved a place they
knew  to  be  bad,  they  carried  everything  they  could.  in  certain  heavily
mined  aos,  where  the  land  was  dense  with  toe  poppers  and  bouncing
betties,  they  took  turns  humping  a  28-pound  mine  detector.  with  its
headphones  and  big  sensing  plate,  the  equipment  was  a  stress  on  the
lower  back  and  shoulders,  awkward  to  handle,  often  useless  because  of
the  shrapnel  in  the  earth,  but  they  carried  it  anyway,  pa

the war wasn't all terror and violence.
sometimes things could almost get sweet. for instance, i remember a
little boy with a plastic leg. i remember how he hopped over to azar and
asked  for  a  chocolate  bar—"gi  number  one,"  the  kid  said—and  azar
laughed  and  handed  over  the  chocolate.  when  the  boy  hopped  away,
azar  clucked  his  tongue  and  said,  "war's  a  bitch."  he  shook  his  head
sadly. "one leg, for chrissake. some poor fucker ran out of ammo."


i  remember  mitchell  sanders  sitting  quietly  in  the  shade  of  an  old

the average age in our platoon, i'd guess, was nineteen or twenty, and

there was no music. most of the hamlet had burned down, including
her house, which was now smoke, and the girl danced with her eyes half
closed,  her  feet  bare.  she  was  maybe  fourteen.  she  had  black  hair  and
brown  skin.  "why's  she  dancing?"  azar  said.  we  searched  through  the
wreckage but there wasn't much to find. rat kiley caught a chicken for
dinner. lieutenant cross radioed up to the gunships and told them to go
away. the girl danced mostly on her toes. she took tiny steps in the dirt
in front of her house, sometimes making a slow twirl, sometimes smiling
to  herself.  "why's  she  dancing?"  azar  said,  and  henry  dobbins  said  it
didn't matter why, she just was. later we found her family in the house.

dly burned. it wasn't a big family: an infant and
an  old  woman  and  a  woman  whose  age  was  hard  to  tell.  when  we
dragged them out, the girl kept dancing. she put the palms of her hands
against  her  ears,  which  must've  meant  something,  and  she  danced
sideways  for  a  short  while,  and  then  backwards.  she  did  a  graceful
movement with her hips. "well, i don't get it," azar said. the smoke from
the  hootches  smelled  like  straw.  it  moved  in  patches  across  the  village
square,  not  thick  anymore,  sometimes  just  faint  ripples  like  fog.  there
were dead pigs, too. the girl went up on her toes and made a slow turn
and  danced  through  the  smoke.  her  face  had  a  dreamy  look,  quiet  and
composed. a while later, when we moved out of the hamlet, she was still
dancing.  "probably  some  weird  ritual,"  azar  said,  but  henry  dobbins
looked back a

that  night,  after  we'd  marched  away  from  the  smoking  village,  azar
mocked  the  girl's  dancing.  he  did  funny  jumps  and  spins.  he  put  the
palms of his hands against his ears and danced sideways for a while, and
then  backwards,  and  then  did  an  erotic  thing  with  his  hips.  but  henry
dobbins,  who  moved  gracefully  for  such  a  big  man,  took  azar  from
behind and lifted him up high and carried him over to a deep well and
asked if he wanted to be dumped in.

azar said no.
"all right, then," henry dobbins said, "dance right."


speaking of courage


the war was over and there was no place in particular to go. norman
bowker  followed  the  tar  road  on  its  seven-mile  loop  around  the  lake,



then  he  started  all  over  again,  driving  slowly,  feeling  safe  inside  his
father's  big  chevy,  now  and  then  looking  out  on  th

father,  not  mentioning  the  shit  field,  just  saying  what  a  fine  soldier
kiowa had been, what a fine human being, and how he was the kind of
son that any father could be proud of forever.


the  search  went  slowly.  for  a  time  the  morning  seemed  to  brighten,
the  sky  going  to  a  lighter  shade  of  silver,  but  then  the  rains  came  back
hard and steady. there was the feel of permanent twilight.

at  the  far  left  of  the  line,  azar  and  norman  bowker  and  mitchell
sanders waded along the edge of the field closest to the river. they were



tall  men,  but  at  times  the  muck  came  to  midthigh,  other  times  to  the
crotch.

azar kept shaking his head. he coughed and shook his head and said,
"man,  talk  about  irony.  i  bet  if  kiowa  was  here,  i  bet  he'd  just  laugh.
eating shit—it's your classic irony."

"fine," said norman bowker. "now pipe down."
azar  sighed.  "wasted  in  the  waste,"  he  said.  "

lance.  their  boots  sank  into  the  ooze,  which  produced  a  powerful
downward suction, and with each step they would have to pull up hard to
break the hold. the rain made quick dents in the water, like tiny mouths,
and the stink was everywhere.

when  they  reached  the  river,  they  shifted  a  few  meters  to  the  north
and  began  wading  back  up  the  field.  occasionally  they  used  their
weapons to test the bottom, but mostly they just searched with their feet.
"a classic case," azar was saying. "biting the dirt, so to speak, that tells

the story."

"enough," bowker said.
"like those old cowboy movies. one more redskin bites the dirt."
"i'm serious, man. zip it shut."
azar smiled and said, "classic."
the  morning  was  cold  and  wet.  they  had  not  slept  during  the  night,
not  even  for  a  few  moments,  and  all  three  of  them  were  feeling  the
tension  as  they  moved  across  the  field  toward  the  river.  there  was
nothing they could do for kiowa. just fi

"whose then?"
"nobody's. nobody knew till afterward."
mitchell  sanders  made  a  sound  in  his  throat.  he  hoisted  up  the
rucksack, slipped into the harness, and pulled the straps tight. "all right,
but this much for sure. the man knew it was raining. he knew about the
river. one plus one. add it up, you get exactly what happened." sanders
glared  at  the  river.  "move  it,"  he  said.  "kiowa's  waiting  on  us."  slowly
then,  bending  against  the  rain,  azar  and  norman  bowker  and  mitchell
sanders began wading again through the deep waters, their eyes down,
circling out from where they had found the rucksack.


first lieutenant jimmy cross stood fifty meters away. he had finished
writing  the  letter  in  his  head,  explaining  things  to  kiowa's  father,  and
now he folded his arms and watched his platoon crisscrossing the wide
field. in a funny way, it reminded him of the municipal golf course in his
hometown in new jersey. a lost ball, he

thought. tired players searching
through the rough, sweeping back and forth in long systematic patterns.
he wished he were there right now. on the sixth hole. looking out across
the  water  hazard  that  fronted  the  small  flat  green,  a  seven  iron  in  his



hand,  calculating  wind  and  distance,  wondering  if  he  should  reach
instead for an eight. a tough decision, but all you could ever lose was a
ball. you did not lose a player. and you never had to wade out into the
hazard and spend the day searching through the slime.

jimmy cross did not want the responsibility of leading these men. he
had never wanted it. in his sophomore year at mount sebastian college
he  had  signed  up  for  the  reserve  officer  training  corps  without  much
thought. an automatic thing: because his friends had joined, and because
it was worth a few credits, and because it seemed preferable to letting the
draft take him. he was unprepared. twenty-four years old and his heart

seemed better not to ask.

he  felt  some  pity  come  on  him.  for  a  moment  the  day  seemed  to
soften. so much hurt, he thought. he watched the young soldier wading
through  the  water,  bending  down  and  then  standing  and  then  bending
down again, as if something might finally be salvaged from all the waste.

jimmy cross silently wished the boy luck.
then  he  closed  his  eyes  and  went  back  to  working  on  the  letter  to

kiowa's father.




across the field azar and norman bowker and mitchell sanders were
wading alongside a narrow dike at the edge of the field. it was near noon
now.

norman  bowker  found  kiowa.  he  was  under  two  feet  of  water.

nothing showed except the heel of a boot.

"that's him?" azar said.
"who else?"
"i don't know." azar shook his head. "i don't know."
norman  bowker  touched  the  boot,  covered  his  eyes  for  a  moment,

then stood up and looked at azar.
"so where's the joke?" he said.
"no joke."

he two boots and pulled up hard. there was only a
slight give. they tried again, but this time the body did not move at all.
after the third try they stopped and looked down for a while. "one more
time," norman bowker said. he counted to three and they leaned back
and pulled.

"stuck," said mitchell sanders.
"i see that. christ."
they tried again, then called over henry dobbins and rat kiley, and
all  five  of  them  put  their  arms  and  backs  into  it,  but  the  body  was
jammed in tight.

azar moved to the dike and sat holding his stomach. his face was pale.
the  others  stood  in  a  circle,  watching  the  water,  then  after  a  time
somebody said, "we can't just leave him there," and the men nodded and
got  out  their  entrenching  tools  and  began  digging.  it  was  hard,  sloppy



work. the mud seemed to flow back faster than they could dig, but kiowa
was their friend and they kept at it anyway.

slowly,  in  little  groups,  the  rest  of  the  platoon  drifted  over  to

 of them it was a relief to have it finished. there was the promise
now  of  finding  a  hootch  somewhere,  or  an  abandoned  pagoda,  where
they could strip down and wring out their fatigues and maybe start a hot
fire.  they  felt  bad  for  kiowa.  but  they  also  felt  a  kind  of  giddiness,  a
secret  joy,  because  they  were  alive,  and  because  even  the  rain  was
preferable  to  being  sucked  under  a  shit  field,  and  because  it  was  all  a
matter of luck and happenstance.

azar sat down on the dike next to norman bowker.
"listen," he said. "those dumb jokes—i didn't mean anything."
"we all say things."
"yeah, but when i saw the guy, it made me feel—i don't know—like he

was listening."



"he wasn't."
"i guess not. but i felt sort of guilty almost, like if i'd kept my mouth

shut none of it would've ever happened. like it was my fault."

norman bowker looked out across the wet field.
"nobody's fault," he said. "everybody's."

the  nights  were  miserable.  sometimes  i'd  roam  around  the  base.  i'd
head down to the wire and stare out at the darkness, out where the war
was, and think up ways to make bobby jorgenson feel exactly what i felt.
i wanted to hurt him.


in march, alpha company came in for stand-down. i was there at the
helipad  to  meet  the  choppers.  mitchell  sanders  and  azar  and  henry
dobbins and dave jensen and norman bowker slapped hands with me
and  we  piled  their  gear  in  my  jeep  and  drove  down  to  the  alpha
hootches. we partied until chow time. afterward, we kept on partying. it
was  one  of  the  rituals.  even  if  you  weren't  in  the  mood,  you  did  it  on
principle.

by midnight it was story time.
"morty phillips used up his luck," bowker said.
i  smiled  and  waited.  there  was  a  tempo  to  how  stories  got  told.

bowker peeled open a

 finger blister and sucked on it.

"go on," azar said. "tell him everything."
"well, that's about it. poor morty wasted his luck. pissed it away."
"on nothing," azar said. "the dummy pisses it away on nothing."
norman  bowker  nodded,  started  to  speak,  but  then  stopped  and  got
up and moved to the cooler and shoved his hands deep into the ice. he
was naked except for his shorts and dog tags. in a way, i envied him—all
of them. their deep bush tans, the sores and blisters, the stories, the in-
it-togethemess.  i  felt  close  to  them,  yes,  but  i  also  felt  a  new  sense  of
separation. my fatigues were starched; i had a neat haircut and the cl

norman  bowker  nodded.  "anyhow,  we  send  out  two  search  patrols.
no dice. not a trace." pausing a second, bowker poured a trickle of beer
onto  his  blister  and  licked  at  it.  "by  then  it's  almost  dark.  lieutenant
cross, he's ready to have a fit—you know how he gets, right?—and then,
guess what? take a guess."

"morty shows," i said.
"you got it, man. morty shows. we almost chalk him up as mia, and

then, bingo, he shows."

"soaking wet," said azar.
"hey, listen—"
"okay, but tell it."
norman  bowker  frowned.  "soaking  wet,"  he  said.  "turns  out  the
moron  went  for  a  swim.  you  believe  that?  all  alone,  he  just  takes  off,
hikes a couple klicks, finds himself a river and strips down and hops in
and  starts  doing  the  goddamn  breast  stroke  or  some  such  fine  shit.  no
security, no nothing. i mean, the dude goes skinny dipping."

azar giggled. "a hot day."
"not that hot," said dave jensen.
"hot, though."

"well, hey," bowker said, "i'm just saying what jorgenson says. maybe
fuckin'  polio.  or  that  weird  elephant  disease.  elephantiasshole  or
whatever."

"yeah, but not polio."
across the hootch, sitting off by himself, azar grinned and snapped his
fingers.  "either  way,"  he  said,  "it  goes  to  show  you.  don't  throw  away
luck on little stuff. save it up."

"there it is," said mitchell sanders.
"morty was due," dave jensen said.
"overdue," sanders said.
norman bowker nodded solemnly. "you don't mess around like that.

you just don't fritter away all your luck."

chest.  number  one:  the  guy  had  almost  killed  me.  number  two:  there
had to be consequences.

that afternoon i asked mitchell sanders to give me a hand.
"no  pain,"  i  said.  "basic  psychology,  that's  all.  mess  with  his  head  a

"negative," sanders said.



"spook the fucker."
sanders shook his head. "man, you're sick."
"all i want is—"
"sick."
quietly, sanders looked at me for a second and then walked away.
i had to get azar in on it.
he  didn't  have  mitchell  sanders's  intelligence,  but  he  had  a  keener
sense  of  justice.  after  i  explained  the  plan,  azar  gave  me  a  long  white
smile.

"tonight?" he said.
"just don't get carried away."
"me?"
still smiling, azar flicked an eyebrow and started snapping his fingers.
it  was  a  tic  of  his.  whenever  things  got  tense,  whenever  there  was  a
prospect for action, he'd do that snapping thing. nobody cared for him,
including myself.

azar winked. "roger-dodger. only a game, right?"



we  called  the  enemy  ghosts.  "bad  night,"  we'd  say,  "the  ghosts  are
out." to get spooked, in the lingo, meant not only to get scared but to get
killed. "don't get spooked," we'd say. "stay cool, stay alive." or we'd say:
"careful,  man,  don't  give  up  the  ghost."  the  countryside  itself  seemed
spooky—shadows and tunnels and incense burning in the dark. the land
was  haunted.  we  were  fighting  forces  that  did  not  obey  the

he could pass through barbed wire and melt away like ice and creep up
on you without sound or footsteps. he was scary. in the daylight, maybe,
you didn't believe in this stuff. you laughed it off. you made jokes. but at
night you turned into a believer: no skeptics in foxholes.



azar  was  wound  up  tight.  all  afternoon,  while  we  made  the
preparations, he kept chanting, "halloween, halloween." that, plus the
finger snapping, almost made me cancel the whole operation. i went hot
and cold. mitchell sanders wouldn't speak to me, which tended to cool it
off,  but  then  i'd  start  remembering  things.  the  result  was  a  kind  of
numbness. no ice, no heat. i just went through the motions, rigidly, by
the numbers, without any heart or real emotion. i rigged up my speci

a  strange  gaze,  too,  straight  on  and  unafraid,  as  if  apologies  were  no
longer  required.  he  was  sitting  there  with  dave  jensen  and  mitchell
sanders and a few others, and he seemed to fit in very nicely, all smiles
and group rapport.

that's probably what cinched it.
i went back to my hootch, showered, shaved, threw my helmet against
the wall, lay down for a while, got up, prowled around, talked to myself,
applied some fresh ointment, then headed off to find azar.

just before dusk, alpha company stood for roll call.
afterward the men separated into two groups. some went off to write
letters or party or sleep; the others trooped down to the base perimeter,
where, for the next eleven hours, they would pull night guard duty. it was
sop—one night on, one night off.

this was jorgenson's night on. i knew that in advance, of course. and
i  knew  his  bunker  assignment:  bunker  six,  a  pile  of  sandbags  at  the
southwest  corner  of  the  perimeter.  t

and the places where he'd take cover in case of trouble. but still, just to
guard  against  freak  screw-ups,  azar  and  i  tailed  him  down  to  the  wire.
we watched him lay out his poncho and connect his claymores to their
firing  devices.  softly,  like  a  little  boy,  he  was  whistling  to  himself.  he

cradled to his chest like a teddy bear.

"a  pigeon,"  azar  whispered.  "roast  pigeon  on  a  spit.  i  smell  it

sizzling."

"except this isn't for real."
azar shrugged. after a second he reached out and clappe

"come on," azar said, "let's do it," but i told him to be patient. waiting
was  the  trick.  so  we  went  to  the  movies,  barbarella  again,  the  eighth
straight  night.  a  lousy  movie,  i  thought,  but  it  kept  azar  occupied.  he
was crazy about jane fonda. "sweet janie," he kept saying. "sweet janie
boosts a man's morale." then, with his hand, he showed me which part
of  his  morale  got  boosted.  it  was  an  old  joke.  everything  was  old.  the

it wasn't yet midnight.
we hiked over to the em club and worked our way through a six-pack.
mitchell sanders was there, at another table, but he pretended not to see
me.

around closing time, i nodded at azar.
"well, goody gumdrop," he said.
we  went  over  to  my  hootch,  picked  up  our  gear,  and  then  moved
through the night down to the wire. i felt like a soldier again. back in the
bush, it seemed. we observed good field discipline, not talking, keeping
to the shadows and joining in with the darkness. when we came up on
bunker six, azar lifted his thumb and peeled away from me and began
circling  to  the  south.  old  times,  i  thought.  a  kind  of  thrill,  a  kind  of

i took a breath, fingered the first rope, and gave it a sharp little jerk.

hooked  up  to  a  homemade  noisemaker  out  in  front  of  jorgenson's
bunker—eight ammo cans filled with rifle cartridges. simple devices, but
they worked. i waited a moment, and then, very gently, i gave all four of
my  ropes  a  little  tug.  delicate,  nothing  loud.  if  you  weren't  listening,

young corpses, lee strunk and kiowa and curt lemon—i was the beast
on their lips—i was nam—the horror, the war.


"creepy," azar said. "wet pants an' goose bumps." he held a beer out

to me, but i shook my head.

we  sat  in  the  dim  light  of  my  hootch,  boots  off,  listening  to  mary

hopkin on my tape deck.

"what next?"
"wait," i said.
"sure, but i mean—"
"shut up and listen."
that  high  elegant  voice.  someday,  when  the  war  was  over,  i'd  go  to
london  and  ask  mary  hopkin  to  marry  me.  that's  another  thing  nam
does to you. it turns you sentimental; it makes you want to hook up with
girls li

ke mary hopkin. you learn, finally, that you'll die, and so you try
to  hang  on  to  your  own  life,  that  gentle,  naive  kid  you  used  to  be,  but
then after a while the sentiment takes over, and the sadness, because you



know  for  a  fact  that  you  can't  ever  bring  any  of  it  back  again.  you  just
can't. those were the days, she sang.

azar switched off the tape.
"shit, man," he said. "don't you got music?"



and now, finally, the moon was out. we slipped back to our positions
and  went  to  work  again  with  the  ropes.  louder  now,  more  insistent.
starlight sparkled in the barbed wire, and there were curious reflections
and  layerings  of  shadow,  and  the  big  white  moon  added  resonance.
there  was  no  wind.  the  night  was  absolute.  slowly,  we  dragged  the
ammo cans closer to bobby jorgenson's bunker, and this,

 plus the moon,
gave a sense of approaching peril, the slow belly-down crawl of evil.

at 0300 hours azar set off the first trip flare.
there  was  a  light  popping  noise,  then  a  sizzle  out  in  front  of  bunker
six. the night seemed to snap itself in half. the white flare burned  ten
paces from the bunker.

i fired off three more flares and it was instant daylight.
then  jorgenson  moved.  he  made  a  short,  low  cry—not  even  a  cry,
really,  just  a  short  lung-and-throat  bark—and  there  was  a  blurred
sequence  as  he  lunged  sideways  and  rolled  toward  a  heap  of  sandba

 future,  leaving  behind  everything  you  ever  were  or  wanted  or
believed in. you know you're about to die. and it's not a movie and you
aren't a hero and all you can do is whimper and wait.

this, now, was something we shared.
i felt close to him. it wasn't compassion, just closeness. his silhouette

was framed like a cardboard cutout against the burning flares.


in the dark outside my hootch, even though i bent toward him, almost

nose to nose, all i could see were the glossy whites of azar's eyes.

"enough," i said.
"oh, sure."



"seriously."
azar gave me a small, thin smile.
"serious?" he said. "that's way too serious for me—i'm your basic fun

lover."

when  he  smiled  again,  i  knew  it  was  hopeless,  but  i  tried  anyway.  i
told him the score was even. we'd made our point, i said, no need to rub
it in.

azar stared at me.
"poor, poor boy," he said. the rest was inflection and white eyes.



an  hour  before  dawn  we  moved  in  for  the  last  phase.  azar  was  in

command now. i tagged after him, thinking maybe i could keep a lid on.
"don't  take  this  personal,"  azar  said  softly.  "it's  my  own  character

flaw. i just like to finish things."

i didn't look at him. as we approached the wire, azar put his hand on
my  shoulder,  guiding  me  over  toward  the  boulder  pile.  he  knelt  down
and  inspected  the  ropes  and  flares,  nodded  to  himself,  peered  out  at
jorgenson's bunker, nodded once more, then took off his helmet and sat
on it.

he was smiling again.
"you  know  something?"  he  said.  his  voice  was  wistful.  "out  here,  at
night,  i  almost  feel  like  a  kid  again.  the  vietnam  experience.  i  mean,
wow, i love this shit."

"let's just—"
"shhhh."
azar put a

 smiling at me, almost kindly.
"this here's what you wanted," he said. "displaying war, right? that's
all this is. a cute little backyard war game. brings back memories, i bet—
those happy soldiering days. except now you're a has-been. one of those
american legion types, guys who like to dress up in a nifty uniform and
go out and play at it. pitiful. it was me, i'd rather get my ass blown away
for real."

my lips had a waxy feel, like soapstone.
"come on," i said. "just quit."
"pitiful."



"azar, for christ sake."
he patted my cheek. "purely pitiful," he said.
we waited another ten minutes. it was cold now, and damp. squatting
down, i felt a sudden brittleness come over me, a hollow sensation, as if
someone could reach out and crush me like a christmas tree ornament.
it was the same feeling i'd had out along the song tra bong. like i was
losing myself, everything spilling out. i remembered how the bullet had
made a soft puffing noise inside me. i remembered lying there for a long
while

y  back.  except  it  wasn't
jorgenson  now—it  was  that  genie—he  was  smiling  down  at  me,  and
winking, and i couldn't buck him off. later on, things clicked into slow
motion.  the  morphine,  maybe.  i  focused  on  jorgenson's  brand-new



boots, then on a pebble, then on my own face floating high above me—
the last things i'd ever see. i couldn't look away. it occurred to me that i
was witness to something rare.

even now, in the dark, there were indications of a spirit world.
azar said, "hey, you awake?"
i nodded.
down at bunker six, things were silent. the place looked abandoned.
azar grinned and went to work on the ropes. it began like a breeze, a
soft  sighing  sound.  i  hugged  myself.  i  watched  azar  bend  forward  and
fire off the first illumination flare. "please," i almost said, but the word
snagged, and i looked up and tracked the flare over jorgenson's bunker.
it exploded almost without noise: a soft red flash.

there was a whimper in the dark. at first i t

hought it was jorgenson.
"please?" i said.
i bit down and folded my hands and squeezed. i had the shivers.
twice more, rapidly, azar fired up red flares. at one point he turned

toward me and lifted his eyebrows.

"timmy, timmy," he said. "such a specimen."
i agreed.
i  wanted  to  do  something,  stop  him  somehow,  but  i  crouched  back
and watched azar pick up a tear-gas grenade and pull the pin and stand
up  and  throw.  the  gas  puffed  up  in  a  thin  cloud  that  partly  obscured
bunker six. even from thirty meters away i could smell it and taste it.

"jesus,  please,"  i  said,  but  azar  lobbed  over  another  one,  waited  for

the hiss, then scrambled over to the rope we hadn't used yet.

it  was  my  idea.  i'd  rigged  it  up  myself:  a  sandbag  painted  white,  a

pulley system.

azar  gave  the  rope  a  quick  tug,  and  out
 
 ___________________________
 
  in  front  of  bunker  six,  the

white sandbag lifted itself up and hovered there in a misty swirl of gas.

jorgenson began firing. just one round at first, a single red tracer that

thumped into the sandbag and burned.

"oooo!" azar murmured.
quickly, talking to himself, azar hurled the last gas grenade, shot up
another flare, then snatched the rope again and made the white sandbag
dance.



"oooo!" he was chanting. "starlight, star bright!"
bobby  jorgenson  did  not  go  nuts.  quietly,  almost  with  dignity,  he
stood up and took aim and fired once more at the sandbag. i could see
his profile against the red flares. his face seemed relaxed, no twitching or
screams. he stared out into the dark for several seconds, as if deciding
something, then he shook his head
 
 ___________________________
 
 and smiled. he stood up straight. he
seemed  to  brace  himself  for  a  moment.  then,  very  slowly,  he  began
marching out toward the wire; his posture was erect; he did not crouch
or squirm or crawl. he walked upright. he moved with a kind of grace.
when  he  reached  the  sandbag,  jorgenson  stopped  and  turned  and
shouted  out  my  name,  then  he  placed  his  rifle  muzzle  up  against  the
white sandbag.

"o'brien!" he yelled, and he fired.
azar dropped the rope.
"well,"  he  muttered,  "show's  over."  he  looked  down  at  me  with  a
mixture of contempt and pity. after a second he shook his head. "man,
i'll tell you something. you're a sorry, sorry case."

i was trembling. i kept hugging myself, rocking, but i couldn't make it

go away.

"disgusting," azar said. "sorriest fuckin' case i ever seen."
he  looked  out  at  jorgenson,  then  at  me.  his  eyes  had  the  opaque,
polished surface of stone. he moved forward as if to help m

 he said.
"pretty much."
again,  i  felt  that  human  closeness.  almost  war  buddies.  we  nearly
shook hands again but then decided against it. jorgenson picked up his
helmet,  brushed  it  off,  and  looked  back  one  more  time  at  the  white
sandbag. his face was filthy.

up at the medic's hootch, he cleaned and bandaged my forehead, then
we went to chow. we didn't have much to say. i told him i was sorry; he
told me the same thing.

afterward, in an awkward moment, i said, "let's kill azar."
jorgenson smiled. "scare him to death, right?"
"right," i said.
"what a movie!"
i shrugged. "sure. or just kill him."


night life


a  few  words  about  rat  kiley.  i  wasn't  there  when  he  got  hurt,  but
mitchell sanders later told me the essential facts. apparently he lost his
cool.

the  platoon  had  been  working  an  ao  out  in  the  foothills  west  of
quang  ngai  city,  and  for  some  time  they'd  been  receiving  intelligence
about  an  nva  buildup  in  the  area.  the  u

then he almost laughed.
"this whole war," he said. "you know what it is? just one big banquet.

meat, man. you and me. everybody. meat for the bugs."

the next morning he shot himself.
he took off his boots and socks, laid out his medical kit, doped himself

up, and put a round through his foot.
nobody blamed him, sanders said.



before  the  chopper  came,  there  was  time  for  goodbyes.  lieutenant
cross  went  over  and  said  he'd  vouch  that  it  was  an  accident.  henry
dobbins and azar gave him a stack of comic books for hospital reading.
everybody stood in a little circle, feeling bad about it, trying to cheer him
up with bullshit about the great night life in japan.
