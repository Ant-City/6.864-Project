for being tom's mother--at the end of the novel we learn that jenny is not 
tom's mother. jenny reappears as "mrs. waters" at upton, where tom saves her 
from a robbery. although jenny does not possess the beauty of a sophia, her very 
white breasts attract tom to her. although she protests to mr. allworthy at the

suggests otherwise. she eventually marries parson supple, a friend of western.
