[CHARACTER] - 
                	
charles's wife and hal's sister. [CHARACTER] is spoiled and pampered,
and her unreasonable demands slow her, hal, and charles on their
journey and contribute to its disastrous ending. her civilized manner,
however, contrasts that of her unprepared brother and husband in
that she initially feels sympathetic for the worn-out sled team.
her behavior, london suggests, demonstrates how civilized women
are unsuited for life in the wild, having been spoiled and babied
by the men around them.
