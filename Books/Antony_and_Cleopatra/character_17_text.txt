caesar.
i should have known no less:
it hath been taught us from the primal state
that he which is was wish'd until he were;
and the ebb'd man, ne'er lov'd till ne'er worth love,
comes dear'd by being lack'd. this common body,
like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
to rot itself with motion.

caesar, i bring thee word
menecrates and menas, famous pirates,
make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
with keels of every kind: many hot inroads
they make in italy; the borders maritime
lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
no vessel can peep forth but 'tis as soon
taken as seen; for pompey's name strikes more
than could his war resisted.

and my auguring hope
says it will come to the full. mark antony
in egypt sits at dinner, and will make
no wars without doors: caesar gets money where
he loses hearts: lepidus flatters both,
of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves
nor either cares for him.

keep his brain fuming; epicurean cooks
sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;

i think so too. but you shall find the band that seems to tie
their friendship together will be the very strangler of their
amity:  octavia is of a holy, cold, and still conversation.

who would not have his wife so?

enobarbus.
not he that himself is not so; which is mark antony. he will to
his egyptian dish again: then shall the sighs of octavia blow the

strength of their amity shall prove the immediate author of their
variance. antony will use his affection where it is: he married
