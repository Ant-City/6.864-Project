The old woman - 
                 The
old woman was born the daughter of a Pope. She has experienced the
death of a fiance, rape by pirates, slavery, and cannibalism in
wartime. She becomes Cunegonde's servant. Her misfortunes have made
her cynical about human nature, but she does not give in to self-pity.
She is wise, practical, and loyal to her mistress. Though she has
often been close to suicide, she always finds a reason to live.
