lebrun is the twenty-six-year-old single man with whom edna falls
in love. dramatic and passionate, he has a history of becoming the
devoted attendant to a different woman each summer at grand isle.

manner, and thus is never taken seriously. as the friendship between
robert and edna becomes more intimate and complex, however, he realizes
that he has genuinely fallen in love with edna. he is torn between
his love for her and society's view that women are the possessions
of their husbands.
