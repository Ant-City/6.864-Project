  theseus. now faire hippolita, our nuptiall houre
drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in
another moon: but oh, me thinkes, how slow
this old moon wanes; she lingers my desires
like to a step-dame, or a dowager,
long withering out a yong mans reuennew

   hip. foure daies wil quickly steep the[m]selues in nights
foure nights wil quickly dreame away the time:
and then the moone, like to a siluer bow,
now bent in heauen, shal behold the night
of our solemnities

   the. go philostrate,
stirre vp the athenian youth to merriments,
awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth,
turne melancholy forth to funerals:
the pale companion is not for our pompe,
hippolita, i woo'd thee with my sword,
and wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries:
but i will wed thee in another key,
with pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling.
enter egeus and his daughter hermia, lysander, and demetrius.

  ege. happy be theseus, our renowned duke

   the. thanks good egeus: what's the news with thee
