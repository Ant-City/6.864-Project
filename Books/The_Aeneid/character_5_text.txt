 did her eyes appear;
  not her own star confess'd a light so clear:
  great in her charms, as when on gods above
  she looks, and breathes herself into their love.
  she held my hand, the destin'd blow to break;
  then from her rosy lips began to speak:
  'my son, from whence this madness, this neglect
  of my commands, and those whom i protect?
  why this unmanly rage? recall to mind
  whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.
  look if your helpless father yet survive,
  or if ascanius or creusa live.
  around your house the greedy grecians err;
  and these had perish'd in the nightly war,
  but for my presence and protecting care.
  not helen's face, nor paris, was in fault;
  but by the gods was this destruction brought.
  now cast your eyes around, while i dissolve
  the mists and films that mortal eyes involve,
  purge from your sight the dross, and make you see
  the shape of each avenging deity.
  enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,
  nor fear obedience to your mother's wi

 and son behold,
  welt'ring in blood, each other's arms infold?
  haste! gird my sword, tho' spent and overcome:
  't is the last summons to receive our doom.
  i hear thee, fate; and i obey thy call!
  not unreveng'd the foe shall see my fall.
  restore me to the yet unfinish'd fight:
  my death is wanting to conclude the night.'
  arm'd once again, my glitt'ring sword i wield,
  while th' other hand sustains my weighty shield,
  and forth i rush to seek th' abandon'd field.
  i went; but sad creusa stopp'd my way,
  and cross the threshold in my passage lay,
  embrac'd my knees, and, when i would have gone,
  shew'd me my feeble sire and tender son:
  'if death be your design, at least,' said she,
  'take us along to share your destiny.
  if any farther hopes in arms remain,
  this place, these pledges of your love, maintain.
  to whom do you expose your father's life,
  your son's, and mine, your now forgotten wife!'
  while thus she fills the house with clam'rous cries,

ds,
  hold you, my father, in your guiltless hands:
  in me 't is impious holy things to bear,
  red as i am with slaughter, new from war,
  till in some living stream i cleanse the guilt
  of dire debate, and blood in battle spilt.'
  thus, ord'ring all that prudence could provide,
  i clothe my shoulders with a lion's hide
  and yellow spoils; then, on my bending back,
  the welcome load of my dear father take;
  while on my better hand ascanius hung,
  and with unequal paces tripp'd along.
  creusa kept behind; by choice we stray
  thro' ev'ry dark and ev'ry devious way.
  i, who so bold and dauntless, just before,
  the grecian darts and shock of lances bore,
  at ev'ry shadow now am seiz'd with fear,
  not for myself, but for the charge i bear;
  till, near the ruin'd gate arriv'd at last,
  secure, and deeming all the danger past,
  a frightful noise of trampling feet we hear.
  my father, looking thro' the shades, with fear,
  cried out: 'haste, haste, my son, the foes are nigh;

  some hostile god, for some unknown offense,
  had sure bereft my mind of better sense;
  for, while thro' winding ways i took my flight,
  and sought the shelter of the gloomy night,
  alas! i lost creusa: hard to tell
  if by her fatal destiny she fell,
  or weary sate, or wander'd with affright;
  but she was lost for ever to my sight.
  i knew not, or reflected, till i meet
  my friends, at ceres' now deserted seat.
  we met: not one was wanting; only she
  deceiv'd her friends, her son, and wretched me.

  "what mad expressions did my tongue refuse!
  whom did i not, of gods or men, accuse!
  this was the fatal blow, that pain'd me more
  than all i felt from ruin'd troy before.

  a guard of grecians had possess'd the porch;
  there phoenix and ulysses watch prey,
  and thither all the wealth of troy convey:
  the spoils which they from ransack'd houses brought,
  and golden bowls from burning altars caught,
  the tables of the gods, the purple vests,
  the people's treasure, and the pomp of priests.
  a rank of wretched youths, with pinion'd hands,
  and captive matrons, in long order stands.
  then, with ungovern'd madness, i proclaim,
  thro' all the silent street, creusa's name:
  creusa still i call; at length she hears,
  and sudden thro' the shades of night appears-
  appears, no more creusa, nor my wife,
  but a pale specter, larger than the life.
  aghast, astonish'd, and struck dumb with fear,
  i stood; like bristles rose my stiffen'd hair.
  then thus the ghost began to soothe my grief
  'nor tears, nor cries, can give the dead relief.
  desist, my much-lov'd lord,'t indulge your pain;
  you bear no more than what the gods ordain.

  long wand'ring ways for you the pow'rs decree;
  on land hard labors, and a length of sea.
  then, after many painful years are past,
  on latium's happy shore you shall be cast,
  where gentle tiber from his bed beholds
  the flow'ry meadows, and the feeding folds.
  there end your toils; and there your fates provide
  a quiet kingdom, and a royal bride:
  there fortune shall the trojan line restore,
  and you for lost creusa weep no more.
  fear not that i shall watch, with servile shame,
  th' imperious looks of some proud grecian dame;
  or, stooping to the victor's lust, disgrace
  my goddess mother, or my royal race.
  and now, farewell! the parent of the gods
  restrains my fleeting soul in her abodes:
  i trust our common issue to your care.'
  she said, and gliding pass'd unseen in air.
  i strove to speak: but horror tied my tongue;
  and thrice about her neck my arms i flung,
  and, thrice deceiv'd, on vai

  be you her comfort; fill my vacant place
  (permit me to presume so great a grace)
  support her age, forsaken and distress'd.
  that hope alone will fortify my breast
  against the worst of fortunes, and of fears."
  he said. the mov'd assistants melt in tears.

  then thus ascanius, wonderstruck to see
  that image of his filial piety:
  "so great beginnings, in so green an age,
  exact the faith which i again ingage.
  thy mother all the dues shall justly claim,
  creusa had, and only want the name.
  whate'er event thy bold attempt shall have,
  't is merit to have borne a son so brave.
  now by my head, a sacred oath, i swear,
  (my father us'd it,) what, returning here
  crown'd with success, i for thyself prepare,
  that, if thou fail, shall thy lov'd mother share."

  he said, and weeping, while he spoke the word,
  from his broad belt he drew a shining sword,
  magnificent with gold. lycaon made,
  and in an ivory scabbard sheath'd the blade.
