 ordered to his
presence the preceptor of templestowe.




chapter xxxvi

     say not my art is fraud--all live by seeming.
     the beggar begs with it, and the gay courtier
     gains land and title, rank and rule, by seeming;
     the clergy scorn it not, and the bold soldier
     will eke with it his service.--all admit it,
     all practise it; and he who is content
     with showing what he is, shall have small credit
     in church, or camp, or state--so wags the world.
     --old play

albert malvoisin, president, or, in the language of the order, preceptor
of the establishment of templestowe, was brother to that philip
malvoisin who has been already occasionally mentioned in this history,
and was, like that baron, in close league with brian de bois-guilbert.

amongst dissolute and unprincipled men, of whom the temple order
included but too many, albert of templestowe might be distinguished; but
with this difference from the audacious bois-guilbert, that he knew how
to throw over his vices an

had not the arrival of the grand master been so unexpectedly sudden,
he would have seen nothing at templestowe which might have appeared to
argue any relaxation of discipline. and, even although surprised, and,
to a certain extent, detected, albert malvoisin listened with such
respect and apparent contrition to the rebuke of his superior, and made
such haste to reform the particulars he censured,--succeeded, in fine,
so well in giving an air of ascetic devotion to a family which had been
lately devoted to license and pleasure, that lucas beaumanoir began to
entertain a higher opinion of the preceptor’s morals, than the first
appearance of the establishment had inclined him to adopt.

but these favourable sentiments on the part of the grand master

 were
greatly shaken by the intelligence that albert had received within a
house of religion the jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the
paramour of a brother of the order; and when albert appeared before him,
he was regarded with unwonted sternness.

“there is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy order
of the temple,” said the grand master, in a severe tone, “a jewish
woman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, sir
preceptor.”

albert malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate
rebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building,
and every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being
known. he read in the looks of beaumanoir ruin to bois-guilbert and to
himself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.

“why are you mute?” continued the grand master.

“is it permitted to me to reply?” answered the preceptor, in a tone of
the deepest humility, although by the questi

“surely, most reverend father,” answered the preceptor, “i have not
risen to this office in the order, being ignorant of one of its most
important prohibitions.”

“how comes it, then, i demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered
a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a jewish sorceress,
into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?”

“a jewish sorceress!” echoed albert malvoisin; “good angels guard us!”

“ay, brother, a jewish sorceress!” said the grand master, sternly. “i
have said it. darest thou deny that this rebecca, the daughter of that
wretched usurer isaac of york, and the pupil of the foul witch
miriam, is now--shame to be thought or spoken!--lodged within this thy
preceptory?”

“your wisdom, reverend father,” answered the preceptor, “hath rolled
away the darkness from my understanding. much did i wonder that so good
a knight as brian de bois

“the laws of england,” interrupted beaumanoir, “permit and enjoin each
judge to execute justice within his own jurisdiction. the most petty
baron may arrest, try, and condemn a witch found within his own domain.
and shall that power be denied to the grand master of the temple within
a preceptory of his order?--no!--we will judge and condemn. the witch
shall be taken out of the land, and the wickedness thereof shall be
forgiven. prepare the castle-hall for the trial of the sorceress.”

albert malvoisin bowed and retired,--not to give directions for
preparing the hall, but to seek out brian de bois-guilbert, and
communicate to him how matters were likely to terminate. it was not
long ere he found him, foaming with indignation at a repulse he had
anew sustained from the fair jewess. “the unthinking,” he said, “the
ungrateful, to scorn him who, amidst blood and flames, would have saved
her life at the risk of his own! by heaven, malvoisin! i abode until
roof and rafters crackled and crashe

stands in this matter.”

“but if,” said the grand master, “our brother brian be under the
influence of a charm or a spell--we speak but for the sake of
precaution, for to the arm of none of our holy order would we more
willingly confide this or a more weighty cause.”

“reverend father,” answered the preceptor of goodalricke, “no spell can
effect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of god.”

“thou sayest right, brother,” said the grand master. “albert malvoisin,
give this gage of battle to brian de bois-guilbert.--it is our charge to
thee, brother,” he continued, addressing himself to bois-guilbert, “that
thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause shall
triumph.--and do thou, rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the third
day from the present to find a champion.”

“that is but brief space,” answered rebecca, “for a stranger, who is
also of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life
and honour for he

foughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the
fourth day from hence.”

“god’s will be done!” said rebecca; “i put my trust in him, to whom an
instant is as effectual to save as a whole age.”

“thou hast spoken well, damsel,” said the grand master; “but well know
we who can array himself like an angel of light. it remains but to name
a fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.--where
is the preceptor of this house?”

albert malvoisin, still holding rebecca’s glove in his hand, was
speaking to bois-guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.

“how!” said the grand master, “will he not receive the gage?”

“he will--he doth, most reverend father,” said malvoisin, slipping the
glove under his own mantle. “and for the place of combat, i hold the
fittest to be the lists of saint george belonging to this preceptory,
and used by us for military exercise.”

“it is well,” said the grand master.--“rebecca, in

nd of the good knight conrade de mont-fitchet; and otherwise he
ought not to be sworn, seeing that his adversary is an unbeliever, and
may take no oath.”

this explanation was satisfactory, to albert’s great joy; for the wily
knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of
prevailing upon brian de bois-guilbert to take such an oath before the
assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his
doing so.

the grand master, having allowed the apology of albert malvoisin,
commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. the trumpets
then again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed
aloud,--“oyez, oyez, oyez.--here standeth the good knight, sir brian
de bois-guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who
will sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the jewess rebecca, to
try by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to
such champion the reverend and valorous grand master here present allows

world of pleasure opens to thee--to me a new career of fame. let them
speak the doom which i despise, and erase the name of bois-guilbert from
their list of monastic slaves! i will wash out with blood whatever blot
they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.”

“tempter,” said rebecca, “begone!--not in this last extremity canst thou
move me one hair’s-breadth from my resting place--surrounded as i am by
foes, i hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy--avoid thee, in the
name of god!”

albert malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their
conference, now advanced to interrupt it.

“hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?” he demanded of bois-guilbert;
“or is she resolute in her denial?”

“she is indeed resolute,” said bois-guilbert.

“then,” said malvoisin, “must thou, noble brother, resume thy place
to attend the issue--the shades are changing on the circle of the
dial--come, brave bois-guilbert--come, thou hope of our holy order, and
soon to be its head.”
