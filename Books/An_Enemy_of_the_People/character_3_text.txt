billing (as he eats). it is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.

mrs. stockmann. my husband makes such a point of having his meals punctually, you know.

billing. that doesn't affect me a bit. indeed, i almost think i enjoy a meal all the better when i can sit down and eat all by myself, and undisturbed.

mrs. stockmann. oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. (turns to the hall door, listening.) i expect that is mr. hovstad coming too.

billing. very likely.

(peter stockmann comes in. he wears an overcoat and his official hat, and carries a stick.)

peter stockmann. good evening, katherine.

mrs. stockmann (coming forward into the sitting-room). ah, good evening—is it you? how good of you to come up and see us!

peter stockmann. i happened to be passing, and so—(looks into the dining-room). but you have company with you, i see.

mrs. stockmann (a little embarrassed). oh, no—it was quite by chance he came in. (hurriedly.) won't you come in and have something,

peter stockmann. i! no, thank you. good gracious—hot meat at night! not with my digestion.

mrs. stockmann. oh, but just once in a way—

peter stockmann. no, no, my dear lady; i stick to my tea and bread and butter. it is much more wholesome in the long run—and a little more economical, too.

mrs. stockmann (smiling). now you mustn't think that thomas and i are spendthrifts.

peter stockmann. not you, my dear; i would never think that of you. (points to the doctor's study.) is he not at home?

mrs. stockmann. no, he went out for a little turn after supper—he and the boys.

peter stockmann. i doubt if that is a wise thing to do. (listens.) i fancy i hear him coming now.

mrs. stockmann. no, i don't think it is he. (a knock is heard at the door.) come in! (hovstad comes in from the hall.) oh, it is you, mr. hovstad!

hovstad. yes, i hope you will forgive me, but i was delayed at th

peter stockmann (bowing a little distantly). good evening. you have come on business, no doubt.

hovstad. partly. it's about an article for the paper.

peter stockmann. so i imagined. i hear my brother has become a prolific contributor to the "people's messenger."

hovstad. yes, he is good enough to write in the "people's messenger" when he has any home truths to tell.

mrs. stockmann (to hovstad). but won't you—? (points to the dining-room.)

peter stockmann. quite so, quite so. i don't blame him in the least, as a writer, for addressing himself to the quarters where he will find the readiest sympathy. and, besides that, i personally have no reason to bear any ill will to your paper, mr. hovstad.

hovstad. i quite agree with you.

peter stockmann. taking one thing with another, there is an excellent spirit of toleration in the town—an admirable municipal spirit. and it all springs from the fact of our having a great common interest to unite us—

an interest that is in an equally high degree the concern of every right-minded citizen.

hovstad. the baths, yes.

peter stockmann. exactly—-our fine, new, handsome baths. mark my words, mr. hovstad—the baths will become the focus of our municipal life! not a doubt of it!

mrs. stockmann. that is just what thomas says.

peter stockmann. think how extraordinarily the place has developed within the last year or two! money has been flowing in, and there is some life and some business doing in the town. houses and landed property are rising in value every day.

hovstad. and unemployment is diminishing,

peter stockmann. yes, that is another thing. the burden on the poor rates has been lightened, to the great relief of the propertied classes; and that relief will be even greater if only we get a really good summer this year, and l

hovstad. and there is a good prospect of that, i hear.

peter stockmann. it looks very promising. inquiries about apartments and that sort of thing are reaching us, every day.

hovstad. well, the doctor's article will come in very suitably.

peter stockmann. has he been writing something just lately?

hovstad. this is something he wrote in the winter; a recommendation of the baths—an account of the excellent sanitary conditions here. but i held the article over, temporarily.

peter stockmann. ah,—some little difficulty about it, i suppose?

hovstad. no, not at all; i thought it would be better to wait until the spring, because it is just at this time that people begin to think seriously about their summer quarters.

peter stockmann. quite righ

hovstad. yes, thomas is really indefatigable when it is a question of the baths.

peter stockmann. well remember, he is the medical officer to the baths.

hovstad. yes, and what is more, they owe their existence to him.

peter stockmann. to him? indeed! it is true i have heard from time to time that some people are of that opinion. at the same time i must say i imagined that i took a modest part in the enterprise.

mrs. stockmann. yes, that is what thomas is always saying.

hovstad. but who denies it, mr. stockmann? you set the thing going and made a practical concern of it; we all know that. i only meant that the idea of it came first from the doctor.

peter stockmann. oh, ideas yes! my brother has had plenty of them in his t

ime—unfortunately. but when it is a question of putting an idea into practical shape, you have to apply to a man of different mettle. mr. hovstad. and i certainly should have thought that in this house at least...

mrs. stockmann. my dear peter—

hovstad. how can you think that—?

mrs. stockmann. won't you go in and have something, mr. hovstad? my husband is sure to be back directly.

hovstad. thank you, perhaps just a morsel. (goes into the dining-room.)

peter stockmann (lowering his voice a little). it is a curious thing that these farmers' sons never seem to lose their want of tact.

mrs. stockmann. surely it is not worth bothering about! cannot you and thomas share the credit as brothers?

peter stockmann. i should have thought so; but apparently some people are not satisfied with a share.

mrs. stockmann. what nonsense! you and thomas get on so capitally together. (listens.) there he is at last, i think. (goes out and opens the door leading to the hall.)

(pushes horster into the dining-room. ejlif and morten go in after them.)

mrs. stockmann. but, thomas, don't you see—?

dr. stockmann (turning in the doorway). oh, is it you, peter? (shakes hands with him.) now that is very delightful.

peter stockmann. unfortunately i must go in a moment—

dr. stockmann. rubbish! there is some toddy just coming in. you haven't forgotten the toddy, katherine?

mrs. stockmann. of course not; the water is boiling now. (goes into the dining-room.)

peter stockmann. toddy too!

dr. stockmann. yes, sit down and we will have it comfortably.

peter stockmann. thanks, i never care about an evening's drinking.

dr. stockmann. but this isn't an evening's drinking.

peter stockmann. it seems to me—. (looks towards t

dr. stockmann (rubbing his hands). yes, isn't it splendid to see young people eat? they have always got an appetite, you know! that's as it should be. lots of food—to build up their strength! they are the people who are going to stir up the fermenting forces of the future, peter.

peter stockmann. may i ask what they will find here to "stir up," as you put it?

dr. stockmann. ah, you must ask the young people that—when the times comes. we shan't be able to see it, of course. that stands to reason—two old fogies, like us.

peter stockmann. really, really! i must say that is an extremely odd expression to—

dr. stockmann. ah, naturally you can't appreciate it as keenly as i. you have lived all your life in these surroundings, and your impressions have been blunted. but i, who have been buried all these years in my little corner up north, almost without ever seeing a stranger who might bring new ideas with him—well, in my case it has just the same effect as if i had been transported into the middle of a crowded city.

peter stockmann. oh, a city—!

mrs. stockmann (from the dining-room). no.

dr. stockmann. and then to be comfortably off, peter! that is something one learns to value, when one has been on the brink of starvation, as we have.

peter stockmann. oh, surely—

dr. stockmann. indeed i can assure you we have often been very hard put to it, up there. and now to be able to live like a lord! today, for instance, we had roast beef for dinner—and, what is more, for supper too. won't you come and have a little bit? or let me show it you, at any rate? come here—

peter stockmann. no, no—not for worlds!

dr. stockmann. well, but just come here then. do you see, we have got a table-cover?

peter stockmann. yes, i noticed it.

peter stockmann. oh, if you can afford luxuries of this kind—

dr. stockmann. yes, i can afford it now. katherine tells me i earn almost as much as we spend.

peter stockmann. almost—yes!

dr. stockmann. but a scientific man must live in a little bit of style. i am quite sure an ordinary civil servant spends more in a year than i do.

peter stockmann. i daresay. a civil servant—a man in a well-paid position...

dr. stockmann. well, any ordinary merchant, then! a man in that position spends two or three times as much as—

peter stockmann. by the way, hovstad was telling me he was going to print another article of yours.

dr. stockmann. an article of mine?

peter stockmann. yes, about the baths. an article you wrote in the winter.

dr. stockmann. oh, that one! no, i don't intend that to appear just for the present.

peter stockmann. why not? it seems to me that this would be the most opportune moment.

dr. stockmann. yes, very likely—under normal conditions. (crosses the room.)

peter stockmann (following him with his eyes). i

dr. stockmann (standing still). to tell you the truth, peter, i can't say just at this moment—at all events not tonight. there may be much that is very abnormal about the present conditions—and it is possible there may be nothing abnormal about them at all. it is quite possible it may be merely my imagination.

peter stockmann. i must say it all sounds most mysterious. is there something going on that i am to be kept in ignorance of? i should have imagined that i, as chairman of the governing body of the baths—

dr. stockmann. and i should have imagined that i—. oh, come, don't let us fly out at one another, peter.

peter stockmann. heaven forbid! i am not in the habit of flying out at people, as you call it. but i am entitled to request most emphatically that all arrangements shall be made in a businesslike mann

dr. stockmann. have i ever at any time tried to go behind your backs?

peter stockmann. you have an ingrained tendency to take your own way, at all events; and, that is almost equally inadmissible in a well ordered community, the individual ought undoubtedly to acquiesce in subordinating himself to the community—or, to speak more accurately, to the authorities who have the care of the community's welfare.

dr. stockmann. very likely. but what the deuce has all this got to do with me?

peter stockmann. that is exactly what you never appear to be willing to learn, my dear thomas.

dr. stockmann. yes, and in such a bad temper.

mrs. stockmann. but, dear thomas, what have you been doing to him again?

dr. stockmann. nothing at all. and, anyhow, he can't oblige me to make my report before the proper time.

mrs. stockmann. what have you got to make a report to him about?

dr. stockmann. i should think it was a good thing. (walks up and down rubbing his hands.) by jove, it's a fine thing to feel this bond of brotherhood between oneself and one's fellow citizens!

petra. and to be able to do so much that is good and useful, father!

dr. stockmann. and for one's own native town into the bargain, my child!

mrs. stockmann. that was a ring at the bell.

dr. stockmann. it must be he, then. (a knock is heard at the door.) come in!

dr. stockmann. glad to see you, peter!

mrs. stockmann. good morning, peter, how are you?

peter stockmann. so so, thank you. (to dr. stockmann.) i received from you yesterday, after office hours, a report dealing with the condition of the water at the baths.

dr. stockmann. yes. have you read it?

peter stockmann. yes, i have,

dr. stockmann. and what have you to say to it?

peter stockmann (with a sidelong glance). hm!—

etra. (she and petra go into the room on the left.)

peter stockmann (after a pause). was it necessary to make all these investigations behind my back?

dr. stockmann. yes, because until i was absolutely certain about it—

peter stockmann. then you mean that you are absolutely certain now?

dr. stockmann. surely you are convinced of that.

peter stockmann. is it your intention to bring this document before the baths committee as a sort of official communication?

dr. stockmann. certainly. something must be done in the matter—and that quickly.

peter stockmann. as usual, you employ violent expressions in your report. you say, amongst other things, that what we offer visitors in our baths is a permanent supply of poison.

dr. stockmann. well, can you describe it any other way, peter? just think—water that is poisonous, whether you drink it or 
 
 ___________________________
 
bathe in it! and this we offer to the poor sick folk who come to us trustfully and pay us at an exorbitant rate to be made well again!

peter stockmann. and your reasoning leads you to this conclusion, that we must build a sewer to draw off the alleged impurities from molledal and must relay the water conduits.

dr. stockmann. yes. do you see any other way out of it? i don't.

peter stockmann. i made a pretext this morning to go and see the town engineer, and, as if only half seriously, broached the subject of these proposals as a thing we might perhaps have to take under consideration some time later on.

dr. stockmann. some time later on!

peter stockmann. he smiled at what he considered to be my extravagance, naturally. have you taken the trouble to consider what your proposed alterations would cost? according to the information i obtained, the expenses would probably mount up to
 
 ___________________________
 
 fifteen or twenty thousand pounds.

dr. stockmann. would it cost so much?

peter stockmann. yes; and the worst part of it would be that the work would take at least two years.

dr. stockmann. two years? two whole years?

peter stockmann. at least. and what are we to do with the baths in the meantime? close them? indeed we should be obliged to. and do you suppose anyone would come near the place after it had got out that the water was dangerous?

dr. stockmann. yes but, peter, that is what it is.

peter stockmann. and all this at this juncture—just as the baths are beginning to be known. there are other towns in the neighbourhood with qualifications to attract visitors for bathing purposes. don't you suppose they would immedi

ately strain every nerve to divert the entire stream of strangers to themselves? unquestionably they would; and then where should we be? we should probably have to abandon the whole thing, which has cost us so much money-and then you would have ruined your native town.

dr. stockmann. i—should have ruined—!

peter stockmann. it is simply and solely through the baths that the town has before it any future worth mentioning. you know that just as well as i.

dr. stockmann. but what do you think ought to be done, then?

peter stockmann. your report has not convinced me that the condition of the water at the baths is as bad as you represent it to be.

dr. stockmann. i tell you it is even worse!—or at all events it will be in summer, when the warm weather comes.

peter stockmann. as i said, i believe you exaggerate th

e matter considerably. a capable physician ought to know what measures to take—he ought to be capable of preventing injurious influences or of remedying them if they become obviously persistent.

dr. stockmann. well? what more?

peter stockmann. the water supply for the baths is now an established fact, and in consequence must be treated as such. but probably the committee, at its discretion, will not be disinclined to consider the question of how far it might be possible to introduce certain improvements consistently with a reasonable expenditure.

dr. stockmann. and do you suppose that i will have anything to do with such a piece of trickery as that?

peter stockmann. trickery!!

dr. stockmann. yes, it would be a trick—a fraud, a

lie, a downright crime towards the public, towards the whole community!

peter stockmann. i have not, as i remarked before, been able to convince myself that there is actually any imminent danger.

dr. stockmann. you have! it is impossible that you should not be convinced. i know i have represented the facts absolutely truthfully and fairly. and you know it very well, peter, only you won't acknowledge it. it was owing to your action that both the baths and the water conduits were built where they are; and that is what you won't acknowledge—that damnable blunder of yours. pooh!—
 
 ___________________________
 
do you suppose i don't see through you?

peter stockmann. and even if that were true? if i perhaps guard my reputation somewhat anxiously, it is in the interests of the town. without moral authority i am powerless to direct public affairs as seems, to my judgment, to be best for the common good. and on that account—and for various other reasons too—it appears to me to be a matter of importance that your report should not be delivered to the committee. in the interests of the public, you must withhold it. then, later on, i will raise the question 
 
 ___________________________
 
and we will do our best, privately; but, nothing of this unfortunate affair not a single word of it—must come to the ears of the public.

dr. stockmann. i am afraid you will not be able to prevent that now, my dear peter.

peter stockmann. it must and shall be prevented.

dr. stockmann. it is no use, i tell you. there are too many people that know about it.

peter stockmann. that know about it? who? surely you don't mean those fellows on the "people's messenger"?

dr. stockmann. yes, they know. the liberal-minded independent press is going to see that you do your duty.

peter stockmann (after a short pause). you are an extraordinarily independent man, thomas. have you given no thought to the consequences this may have for yourself?

dr. stockmann. consequences?—for me?

peter stockmann. for you and yours, yes.

dr. stockmann. what the deuce do you mean?

tockmann. i believe i have always behaved in a brotherly way to you—haven't i always been ready to oblige or to help you?

dr. stockmann. yes, you have, and i am grateful to you for it.

peter stockmann. there is no need. indeed, to some extent i was forced to do so—for my own sake. i always hoped that, if i helped to improve your financial position, i should be able to keep some check on you.

dr. stockmann. what! then it was only for your own sake—!

peter stockmann. up to a certain point, yes. it is painful for a man in an official position to have his nearest relative compromising himself time after time.

dr. stockmann. and do you consider that i do that?

peter stockmann. yes, unfortunately, you do, without even being aware of it. you have a restless, pugnacious, rebellious disposition. and then there is that disastrous propensity of yours to want to write about every sort of possible and impossible thing. the moment an idea comes into your head, you m

dr. stockmann. well, but is it not the duty of a citizen to let the public share in any new ideas he may have?

peter stockmann. oh, the public doesn't require any new ideas. the public is best served by the good, old established ideas it already has.

dr. stockmann. and that is your honest opinion?

peter stockmann. yes, and for once i must talk frankly to you. hitherto i have tried to avoid doing so, because i know how irritable you are; but now i must tell you the truth, thomas. you have no conception what an amount of harm you do yourself by your impetuosity. you complain of the authorities, you even complain of the government—you are always pulling them to pieces; you insist that you have been neglected and persecuted. but what else can such a cantankerous man as you expect?

dr. stockmann. what nex
 
 ___________________________
 
t! cantankerous, am i?

peter stockmann. yes, thomas, you are an extremely cantankerous man to work with—i know that to my cost. you disregard everything that you ought to have consideration for. you seem completely to forget that it is me you have to thank for your appointment here as medical officer to the baths.

dr. stockmann. i was entitled to it as a matter of course!—i and nobody else! i was the first person to see that the town could be made into a flourishing watering-place, and i was the only one who saw it at that time
 
 ___________________________
 
. i had to fight single-handed in support of the idea for many years; and i wrote and wrote—

peter stockmann. undoubtedly. but things were not ripe for the scheme then—though, of course, you could not judge of that in your out-of-the-way corner up north. but as soon as the opportune moment came i—and the others—took the matter into our hands.

dr. stockmann. yes, and made this mess of all my beautiful plan. it is pretty obvious now what clever fellows you were!

peter stockmann. to my mind the whole thing only seems to mean that you are seeking another outlet for your combativeness. you want to pick a quarrel with your superiors—an old habit of yours. you cannot put up with any authority over you. you look askance at anyone who occupies a superior official position; you regard him as a personal enemy, and then any stick is good enough to beat him with. but now i have called your attention to the fact that the town's interests are at stake—and, incidentally, my own
 
 ___________________________
 
 too. and therefore, i must tell you, thomas, that you will find me inexorable with regard to what i am about to require you to do.

dr. stockmann. and what is that?

peter stockmann. as you have been so indiscreet as to speak of this delicate matter to outsiders, despite the fact that you ought to have treated it as entirely official and confidential, it is obviously impossible to hush it up now. all sorts of rumours will get about directly, and everybody who has a grudge against us will take care to embellish these rumours. so it will be necessary for you to refute them publicly.

dr. stockmann. i! how? i don't understand.

peter stockmann. what we shall expect is that, a
 
 ___________________________
 
fter making further investigations, you will come to the conclusion that the matter is not by any means as dangerous or as critical as you imagined in the first instance.

dr. stockmann. oho!—so that is what you expect!

peter stockmann. and, what is more, we shall expect you to make public profession of your confidence in the committee and in their readiness to consider fully and conscientiously what steps may be necessary to remedy any possible defects.

dr. stockmann. but you will never be able to do that by patching and tinkering at it—never! take my word for it, peter; i mean what i say, as deliberately and emphatically as possible.

peter stockmann. as an officer under the committee, you have no right to any individual

 opinion.

dr. stockmann (amazed). no right?

peter stockmann. in your official capacity, no. as a private person, it is quite another matter. but as a subordinate member of the staff of the baths, you have no right to express any opinion which runs contrary to that of your superiors.

dr. stockmann. this is too much! i, a doctor, a man of science, have no right to—!

peter stockmann. the matter in hand is not simply a scientific one. it is a complicated matter, and has its economic as well as its technical side.

dr. stockmann. i don't care what it is! i intend to be free to express my opinion on any subject under the sun.

peter stockmann. as you please—but not on any subject concerning the baths. that we forbid.

dr. stockmann (going up to him). you were saying something about forbidding and obeying?

peter stockmann. you obliged me to take that tone with you.

peter stockmann. we consider it absolutely necessary that you should make some such public statement as i have asked for.

dr. stockmann. and if i do not—obey?

aslaksen. yes he wants to speak to you. he came in by the back door—didn't want to be seen, you understand.

hovstad. what can he want? wait a bit—i will go myself. (goes to the door of the printing room, opens it, bows and invites peter stockmann in.) just see, aslaksen, that no one—

aslaksen. quite so. (goes into the printing-room.)

peter stockmann. you did not expect to see me here, mr. hovstad?

hovstad. no, i confess i did not.

peter stockmann (looking round). you are very snug in here—very nice indeed.

hovstad. oh—

peter stockmann. and here i come, without any notice, to take up your time!

hovstad. by all means, mr. mayor. i am at your service. but let me relieve you of your—(takes stockmann's hat and stick and puts t

peter stockmann (sitting down by the table). thank you. (hovstad sits down.) i have had an extremely annoying experience to-day, mr. hovstad.

hovstad. really? ah well, i expect with all the various business you have to attend to—

peter stockmann. the medical officer of the baths is responsible for what happened today.

hovstad. indeed? the doctor?

peter stockmann. he has addressed a kind of report to the baths committee on the subject of certain supposed defects in the baths.

hovstad. has he indeed?

peter stockmann. yes—has he not told you? i thought he said—

hovstad. ah, yes—it is true he did mention something about—

aslaksen (coming from the printing-room). i ought to have that copy.

hovstad (angrily). ahem!—there it is on the desk.

aslaksen (taking it). right.

peter stockmann. but look there—that is the thing i was speaking of!

hovstad. oh, is that what you were speaking about?

peter stockmann. yes, that is it. what do you think of it?

hovstad. oh, i am only a layman—and i have only taken a very cursory glance at it.

peter stockmann. but you are going to print it?

hovstad. i cannot very well refuse a distinguished man.

aslaksen. i have nothing to do with editing the paper, mr. mayor—

peter stockmann. i understand.

aslaksen. i merely print what is put into my hands.

peter stockmann. quite so.

aslaksen. and so i must— (moves off towards the printing-room).

peter stockmann. no, but wait a moment, mr. aslaksen. you will allow me, mr. hovstad?

hovstad. if you please, mr. mayor.

peter stockmann. you are a discreet and thoughtful man, mr. aslaksen.

aslaksen. i am delighted to hear you think so, sir.

peter stockmann. and a man of very considerable influence.

aslaksen. chiefly among the

small tradesmen, sir.

peter stockmann. the small tax-payers are the majority—here as everywhere else.

aslaksen. that is true.

peter stockmann. and i have no doubt you know the general trend of opinion among them, don't you?

aslaksen. yes i think i may say i do, mr. mayor.

peter stockmann. yes. well, since there is such a praiseworthy spirit of self-sacrifice among the less wealthy citizens of our town—

aslaksen. what?

hovstad. self-sacrifice?

peter stockmann. it is pleasing evidence of a public-spirited feeling, extremely pleasing evidence. i might almost say i hardly expected it. but you have a closer knowledge of public opinion than i.

aslaksen. but, mr. mayor—

peter stockmann. and indeed it is no small sacrifice that the town is going to make.

hovstad. the town?

aslaksen. but i don't understand. is it the baths—?

peter stockmann. at a provisional estimate, the alterations that the medical officer asserts to be desirable will cost somewh

ere about twenty thousand pounds.

aslaksen. that is a lot of money, but—

peter stockmann. of course it will be necessary to raise a municipal loan.

hovstad (getting up). surely you never mean that the town must pay—?

aslaksen. do you mean that it must come out of the municipal funds?—out of the ill-filled pockets of the small tradesmen?

peter stockmann. well, my dear mr. aslaksen, where else is the money to come from?

aslaksen. the gentlemen who own the baths ought to provide that.

peter stockmann. the proprietors of the baths are not in a position to incur any further expense.

aslaksen. is that absolutely certain, mr. mayor?

peter stockmann. i have satisfied myself that it is so. if the town wants these very extensive alterations, it will have to pay for them.

aslaksen. but, damn it all—i beg your pardon—this is quite another matter, mr. hovstad!

hovstad. it is, indeed.

peter stockmann. the most fatal part of it is that we shall be obliged to shut the baths for a couple of year

hovstad. shut them? shut them altogether?

aslaksen. for two years?

peter stockmann. yes, the work will take as long as that—at least.

aslaksen. i'm damned if we will stand that, mr. mayor! what are we householders to live upon in the meantime?

peter stockmann. unfortunately, that is an extremely difficult question to answer, mr. aslaksen. but what would you have us do? do you suppose we shall have a single visitor in the town, if we go about proclaiming that our water is polluted, that we are living over a plague spot, that the entire town—

peter stockmann. what you say is lamentably true, mr. aslaksen. my brother has unfortunately always been a headstrong man.

hovstad. can you suppose for a moment that i—?

peter stockmann. i have drawn up a short resume of the situation as it appears from a reasonable man's point of view. in it i have indicated how certain possible defects might suitably be remedied without outrunning the resources of the baths committee.

hovstad. have you got it with you, mr. mayor?

peter stockmann (fumbling in his pocket). yes, i brought it with me in case you should—

hovstad. you will only find billing in there.

mrs. stockmann. thomas—please don't—!

aslaksen. don't be rash, doctor.

(dr. stockmann has put on the mayor's hat and taken his stick in his hand. he goes up to the door, opens it, and stands with his hand to his hat at the salute. peter stockmann comes in, red with anger. billing follows him.)

peter stockmann. what does this tomfoolery mean?

dr. stockmann. be respectful, my good peter. i am the chief authority in the town now. (walks up and down.)

mrs. stockmann (almost in tears). really, thomas!

aslaksen. no, it is the subscribers, doctor.

peter stockmann. fortunately, yes.

aslaksen. it is public opinion—the enlightened public—householders and people of that kind; they control the newspapers.

dr. stockmann. we have not got to the end yet. (to hovstad.) then it is quite impossible for you to print my article in the "people's messenger"?

hovstad. quite impossible—out of regard for your family as well.

mrs. stockmann. you need not concern yourself about his family, thank you, mr. hovstad.

peter stockmann (taking a paper from his pocket). it will be sufficient, for the guidance of the public, if this appears. it is an official statement. may i trouble you?

hovstad (taking the paper). certainly; i will see that it is printed.

dr. stockmann. but not mine. do you imagine that you can silence me and stifle the truth! you will not find it so easy as you suppose. mr. aslaksen, kindly take my manuscript at once and print it as a pamphlet—at my expense. i will have four hundred copies—no, five or

aslaksen. if you offered me its weight in gold, i could not lend my press for any such purpose, doctor. it would be flying in the face of public opinion. you will not get it printed anywhere in the town.

dr. stockmann. then give it me back.

hovstad (giving him the ms.). here it is.

dr. stockmann (taking his hat and stick). it shall be made public all the same. i will read it out at a mass meeting of the townspeople. all my fellow-citizens shall hear the voice of truth!

peter stockmann. you will not find any public body in the town that will give you the use of their hall for such a purpose.

aslaksen. not a single one, i am certain.

billing. no, i'm damned if you will find one.

mrs. stockmann. but this is too shameful! why should every one turn against you like that?

dr. stockmann (angrily). i will tell you why. it is because all the men in this town are old women—like you; they all think of nothing but their families, and never of the community.

peter stockmann. you are surely not such an errant fool as that!

dr. stockmann. yes, i am.

aslaksen. you won't find a single man in the whole town to go with you.

mrs. stockmann. don't give in, thomas. i will tell the boys to go with you.

aslaksen. and now, as i am in this position, i should like to say a few brief words. i am a quiet and peaceable man, who believes in discreet moderation, and—and—in moderate discretion. all my friends can bear witness to that.

several voices. that's right! that's right, aslaksen!

aslaksen. i have learned in the school of life and experience that moderation is the most valuable virtue a citizen can possess—

peter stockmann. hear, hear!

aslaksen. —and moreover, that discretion and moderation are what enable a man to be of most service to the community. i would therefore suggest to our esteemed fellow-citizen, who has called this meeting, that he should strive to keep strictly within the bounds of moderation.

peter stockmann. in consideration of the close relationship in which, as you all know, i stand to the present medical officer of the baths, i should have preferred not to speak this evening. but my official position with regard to the baths and my solicitude for the vital interests of the town compel me to bring forward a motion. i venture to presume that there is not a single one of our citizens present who considers it desirable that unreliable and exaggerated accounts of the sanitary condition of the baths

dr. stockmann (impatiently). not permit—! what the devil—!

mrs. stockmann (coughing). ahem!-ahem!

dr. stockmann (collecting himself). very well, go ahead!

peter stockmann. in my communication to the "people's messenger," i have put the essential facts before the public in such a way that every fair-minded citizen can easily form his own opinion. from it you will see that the main result of the medical officer's proposals—apart from their constituting a vote of censure on the leading men of the town—would be to saddle the ratepayers with an unnecessary expenditure of at least some thousands of pounds.

dr. stockmann. there is no necessity! tonight i have no intention of dealing with all that filth down at the baths. no; i have something quite different to say to you.

dr. stockmann (continuing). i have thought and pondered a great deal, these last few days—pondered over such a variety of things that in the end my head seemed too full to hold them—

peter stockmann (with a cough). ahem!

dr. stockmann. —but i got them clear in my mind at last, and then i saw the whole situation lucidly. and that is why i am standing here to-night. i have a great revelation to make to you, my fellow-citizens! i will impart to you a discovery of a far wider scope than the trifling matter that our water supply is poisoned and our medicinal baths are standing on pestiferous soil.

peter stockmann. such an insinuation—!

dr. stockmann. i have always loved my native town as a man only can love the home of his youthful days. i was not old when i went away from here; and exile, longing and memories cast as it were an additional halo over both the town and its inhabitants.

(applause and protests.) and then when fate at last decreed for me the great happiness of coming home again—i assure you, gentlemen, i thought i had nothing more in the world to wish for. or rather, there was one thing i wished for—eagerly, untiringly, ardently—and that was to be able to be of service to my native town and the good of the community.

peter stockmann (looking at the ceiling). you chose a strange way of doing it—ahem!

dr. stockmann. and so, with my eyes blinded to the real facts, i revelled in happiness. but yesterday morning—no, to be precise, it was yesterday afternoon—the eyes of my mind were opened wide, and the first thing i realised was the colossal stupidity of the authorities—.

peter stockmann. mr. chairman, can we allow such expressions to pass?

aslaksen. it appears to me that the speaker is wandering a long way from his subject.

peter stockmann. i quite agree with the chairman.

dr. stockmann. have you gone clean out of your senses, peter? i am sticking as closely to my subject as i can; for my subject is precisely this, that it is the masses, the majority—this infernal compact majority—that poisons the sources of our moral life and infects the ground we stand on.

peter stockmann (taking a big letter from his pocket). i have this document for you, from the baths committee.

dr. stockmann. my dismissal?

peter stockmann. yes, dating from today. (lays the letter on the table.) it gives us pain to do it; but, to speak frankly, we dared not do otherwise on account of public opinion.

peter stockmann. the householders' association is circulating a list from house to house. all right-minded citizens are being called upon to give up employing you; and i can assure you that not a single head of a family will risk refusing his signature. they simply dare not.

dr. stockmann. no, no; i don't doubt it. but what then?

peter stockmann. if i might advise you, it would be best to leave the place for a little while—

dr. stockmann. yes, the propriety of leaving the place has occurred to me.

peter stockmann. good. and then, when you have had six months to think things over, if, after mature consideration, you can persuade yourself to write a few words of regret, acknowledging your error—

dr. stockmann. oh, that's what you are after, is it! i will just trouble you to remember what i said to you lately about foxy tricks of that sort!

peter stockmann. your position was quite different then. at that time you had reason to suppose you had the whole town at your back—

dr. stockmann. yes, and now i feel i have the whole town on my back—(flaring up). i would not do it if i had the devil and his dam on my back—! never—never, i tell you!

dr. stockmann. i have no right! there is only one single thing in the world a free man has no r

ight to do. do you know what that is?

peter stockmann. no.

dr. stockmann. of course you don't, but i will tell you. a free man has no right to soil himself with filth; he has no right to behave in a way that would justify his spitting in his own face.

peter stockmann. this sort of thing sounds extremely plausible, of course; and if there were no other explanation for your obstinacy—. but as it happens that there is.

dr. stockmann. what do you mean?

peter stockmann. you understand, very well what i mean. but, as your brother and as a man of discretion, i advise you not to build too much upon expectations and prospects that may so very easily fail you.

dr. stockmann. what in the world is all this about?

peter stockmann. do you really ask me to believe that you are ignorant of the terms of mr. kiil's will?

dr. stockmann. i know that the small amount he possesses is to go to an institution for indigent old workpeople. how does that concern me?

kmann. in the first place, it is by no means a small amount that is in question. mr. kiil is a fairly wealthy man.

dr. stockmann. i had no notion of that!

peter stockmann. hm!—hadn't you really? then i suppose you had no notion, either, that a considerable portion of his wealth will come to your children, you and your wife having a life-rent of the capital. has he never told you so?

dr. stockmann. never, on my honour! quite the reverse; he has consistently done nothing but fume at being so unconscionably heavily taxed. but are you perfectly certain of this, peter?

peter stockmann. i have it from an absolutely reliable source.

dr. stockmann. then, thank god,

 katherine is provided for—and the children too! i must tell her this at once—(calls out) katherine, katherine!

peter stockmann (restraining him). hush, don't say a word yet!

mrs. stockmann (opening the door). what is the matter?

dr. stockmann. oh, nothing, nothing; you can go back. (she shuts the door. dr. stockmann walks up and down in his excitement.) provided for!—just think of it, we are all provided for! and for life! what a blessed feeling it is to know one is provided for!

peter stockmann. yes, but that is just exactly what you are not. mr. kiil can alter his will any day he likes.

dr. stockmann. but he won't do that, my dear peter. the "badger" is much too delighted at my attack on you and your wise friends.

peter stockmann (starts and looks intently at him). ali, that throws a light on various things.

dr. stockmann. what things?

peter stockmann. i see that the whole thing was a combined manoeuvre on your part and his. these violent, reckless attacks that you have made agai

nst the leading men of the town, under the pretence that it was in the name of truth—

dr. stockmann. what about them?

peter stockmann. i see that they were nothing else than the stipulated price for that vindictive old man's will.

dr. stockmann (almost speechless). peter—you are the most disgusting plebeian i have ever met in all my life.

peter stockmann. all is over between us. your dismissal is irrevocable—we have a weapon against you now. (goes out.)

dr. stockmann. for shame! for shame! (calls out.) katherine, you must have the floor scrubbed after him! let—what's her name—devil take it, the girl who has always got soot on her nose—

mrs. stockmann. (in the sitting-room). hush, thomas, be quiet!

petra (coming to the door). father, grandfather is here, asking if he may speak to you alone.

dr. stockmann. certainly he may. (going to
