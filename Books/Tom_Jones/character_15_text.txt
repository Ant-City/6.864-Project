 as indeed she had suspected the second time
she saw this young couple together. this business, she rightly i think
concluded, that she should by no means forward by mixing in the
company while they were together; she therefore ordered her servants,
that when my lord was going, they should tell him she desired to speak
with him; and employed the intermediate time in meditating how best to
accomplish a scheme, which she made no doubt but his lordship would
very readily embrace the execution of.

lord fellamar (for that was the title of this young nobleman) was no
sooner introduced to her ladyship, than she attacked him in the
following strain: ‚Äúbless me, my lord, are you here yet? i thought my
servants had made a mistake, and let you go away; and i wanted to see
you about an affair of some importance.‚Äù----‚Äúindeed, lady bellaston,‚Äù
 said he, ‚Äúi don‚Äôt wonder you are astonished at the length of my
visit; for i have staid above two hours, and i did not think i had
staid above half-a-one.‚Äù-

of those tales, and that the assembly consisted in reality of a set of
very good sort of people, and the fibs which they propagated were of a
harmless kind, and tended only to produce mirth and good humour.

edwards was likewise a member of this comical society. to him
therefore lady bellaston applied as a proper instrument for her
purpose, and furnished him with a fib, which he was to vent whenever
the lady gave him her cue; and this was not to be till the evening,
when all the company but lord fellamar and himself were gone, and
while they were engaged in a rubber at whist.

to this time then, which was between seven and eight in the evening,
we will convey our reader; when lady bellaston, lord fellamar, miss
western, and tom, being engaged at whist, and in the last game of
their rubbers, tom received his cue from lady bellaston, which was, ‚Äúi

d, the usual assistance was summoned, and sophia at
last, as it is usual, returned again to life, and was soon after, at
her earnest desire, led to her own apartment; where, at my lord‚Äôs
request, lady bellaston acquainted her with the truth, attempted to
carry it off as a jest of her own, and comforted her with repeated
assurances, that neither his lordship nor tom, though she had taught
him the story, were in the true secret of the affair.

there was no farther evidence necessary to convince lord fellamar how
justly the case had been represented to him by lady bellaston; and
now, at her return into the room, a scheme was laid between these two
noble persons, which, though it appeared in no very heinous light to
his lordship (as he faithfully promised, and faithfully resolved too,
to make the lady all the subsequent amends in his power by marriage),
yet many of our readers, we doubt not, will see with just detestation.

the next evening at seven was appointed for the fatal purpose, when

containing some matters which may affect, and others which may
surprize, the reader.


the clock had now struck seven, and poor sophia, alone and melancholy,
sat reading a tragedy. it was the fatal marriage; and she was now come
to that part where the poor distrest isabella disposes of her
wedding-ring.

here the book dropt from her hand, and a shower of tears ran down into
her bosom. in this situation she had continued a minute, when the door
opened, and in came lord fellamar. sophia started from her chair at
his entrance; and his lordship advancing forwards, and making a low
bow, said, ‚Äúi am afraid, miss western, i break in upon you abruptly.‚Äù
 ‚Äúindeed, my lord,‚Äù says she, ‚Äúi must own myself a little surprized at
this unexpected visit.‚Äù ‚Äúif this visit be unexpected, madam,‚Äù answered
lord fellamar, ‚Äúmy eyes must have been very faithless interpreters of
my heart, when last i had the honour of seeing you; for surely you

 caused.‚Äù then fetching a deep sigh, and laying hold of her hand,
he ran on for some minutes in a strain which would be little more
pleasing to the reader than it was to the lady; and at last concluded
with a declaration, ‚Äúthat if he was master of the world, he would lay
it at her feet.‚Äù sophia then, forcibly pulling away her hand from his,
answered with much spirit, ‚Äúi promise you, sir, your world and its
master i should spurn from me with equal contempt.‚Äù she then offered
to go; and lord fellamar, again laying hold of her hand, said, ‚Äúpardon
me, my beloved angel, freedoms which nothing but despair could have
tempted me to take.----believe me, could i have had any hope that my
title and fortune, neither of them inconsiderable, unless when
compared with your worth, would have been accepted, i had, in the
humblest manner, presented them to your acceptance.----but i cannot
lose you.--by heaven, i will sooner part with my soul!--you are, you
must, you shall be only mine.‚Äù ‚Äúmy lord,‚Äù

ed forth the word daughter, so sophia, in the midst of her
struggling, cried out upon her father), he thought proper to
relinquish his prey, having only disordered her handkerchief, and with
his rude lips committed violence on her lovely neck.

if the reader‚Äôs imagination doth not assist me, i shall never be able
to describe the situation of these two persons when western came into
the room. sophia tottered into a chair, where she sat disordered,
pale, breathless, bursting with indignation at lord fellamar;
affrighted, and yet more rejoiced, at the arrival of her father.

his lordship sat down near her, with the bag of his wig hanging over
one of his shoulders, the rest of his dress being somewhat disordered,
and rather a greater proportion of linen than is usual appearing at
his bosom. as to the rest, he was amazed, affrighted, vexed, and
ashamed.

as to squire western, he happened at this time to be overtaken by an
enemy, which very frequently pursues, and seldom fails to overtake,
most of the

she knows it was her aunt proposed it to me first.--come, sophy, once
more let me beg you to be a good girl, and gee me your consent before
your cousin.‚Äù

‚Äúlet me give him your hand, cousin,‚Äù said the lady. ‚Äúit is the fashion
now-a-days to dispense with time and long courtships.‚Äù

‚Äúpugh!‚Äù said the squire, ‚Äúwhat signifies time; won‚Äôt they have time
enough to court afterwards? people may court very well after they have
been a-bed together.‚Äù

as lord fellamar was very well assured that he was meant by lady
bellaston, so, never having heard nor suspected a word of blifil, he
made no doubt of his being meant by the father. coming up, therefore,
to the squire, he said, ‚Äúthough i have not the honour, sir, of being
personally known to you, yet, as i find i have the happiness to have
my proposals accepted, let me intercede, sir, in behalf of the young
lady, that she may not be more solicited at this time.‚Äù

‚Äúyou intercede, sir!‚Äù said the squire; ‚

Äúwhy, who the devil are you?‚Äù

‚Äúsir, i am lord fellamar,‚Äù answered he, ‚Äúand am the happy man whom i
hope you have done the honour of accepting for a son-in-law.‚Äù

‚Äúyou are a son of a b----,‚Äù replied the squire, ‚Äúfor all your laced

‚Äúi shall take more from you, sir, than from any man,‚Äù answered the
lord; ‚Äúbut i must inform you that i am not used to hear such language
without resentment.‚Äù

‚Äúresent my a--,‚Äù quoth the squire. ‚Äúdon‚Äôt think i am afraid of such a

after which he mounted
himself, and ordered it to drive to his lodgings. in the way thither
he suffered sophia to be quiet, and entertained himself with reading a
lecture to the parson on good manners, and a proper behaviour to his
betters.

it is possible he might not so easily have carried off his daughter
from lady bellaston, had that good lady desired to have detained her;
but, in reality, she was not a little pleased with the confinement
into which sophia was going; and as her project with lord fellamar had
failed of success, she was well contented that other violent methods
were now going to be used in favour of another man.



chapter vi.

by what means the squire came to discover his daughter.


though the reader, in many histories, is obliged to digest much more
unaccountable appearances than this of mr western, without any
satisfaction at all; yet, as we dearly love to oblige him whenever it
is in our power, we shall now proceed to shew by what method the
squire discovered where his daugh

to none but mr western himself.

‚Äúan officer!‚Äù cries the squire; ‚Äúwhat can any such fellow have to do
with me? if he wants an order for baggage-waggons, i am no justice of
peace here, nor can i grant a warrant.--let un come up then, if he
must speak to me.‚Äù

a very genteel man now entered the room; who, having made his
compliments to the squire, and desired the favour of being alone with
him, delivered himself as follows:--

‚Äúsir, i come to wait upon you by the command of my lord fellamar; but
with a very different message from what i suppose you expect, after
what past the other night.‚Äù

‚Äúmy lord who?‚Äù cries the squire; ‚Äúi never heard the name o‚Äôun.‚Äù

‚Äúhis lordship,‚Äù said the gentleman, ‚Äúis willing to impute everything
to the effect of liquor, and the most trifling acknowledgment of that
kind will set everything right; for as he hath the most violent
attachment to your daughter, you, sir, are the last person upon earth
from whom he would resent an affront; and

humour only, and to her dissatisfaction at the omission of ceremony in
the visit; but blifil saw a little deeper into things. he suspected
somewhat of more consequence, from two or three words which dropt from
the lady; and, to say the truth, he suspected right, as will appear
when i have unfolded the several matters which will be contained in
the following chapter.

schemes of lady bellaston for the ruin of jones.


love had taken too deep a root in the mind of lord fellamar to be
plucked up by the rude hands of mr western. in the heat of resentment
he had, indeed, given a commission to captain egglane, which the
captain had far exceeded in the execution; nor had it been executed at
all, had his lordship been able to find the captain after he had seen
lady bellaston, which was in the afternoon of the day after he had
received the affront; but so industrious was the captain in the
discharge of his duty, that, having after long enquiry found out the
squire‚Äôs lodgin

d this project: for the
fellow, i promise you, however well drest, is but a vagabond, and as
proper as any fellow in the streets to be pressed into the service;
and as for the conscientious part, surely the preservation of a young
lady from such ruin is a most meritorious act; nay, with regard to the
fellow himself, unless he could succeed (which heaven forbid) with my
cousin, it may probably be the means of preserving him from the
gallows, and perhaps may make his fortune in an honest way.‚Äù

lord fellamar very heartily thanked her ladyship for the part which
she was pleased to take in the affair, upon the success of which his
whole future happiness entirely depended. he said, he saw at present
no objection to the pressing scheme, and would consider of putting it
in execution. he then most earnestly recommended to her ladyship to do
him the honour of immediately mentioning his proposals to the family;
to whom he said he offered a _carte blanche_, and would settle his
fortune in almost any manner

 this fair opportunity, which beyond her hopes
offered itself, for she was much better pleased with the prospect of
making the proposals to a woman of sense, and who knew the world, than
to a gentleman whom she honoured with the appellation of hottentot;
though, indeed, from him she apprehended no danger of a refusal.

the two ladies being met, after very short previous ceremonials, fell
to business, which was indeed almost as soon concluded as begun; for
mrs western no sooner heard the name of lord fellamar than her cheeks
glowed with pleasure; but when she was acquainted with the eagerness
of his passion, the earnestness of his proposals, and the generosity
of his offer, she declared her full satisfaction in the most explicit
terms.

in the progress of their conversation their discourse turned to jones,
and both cousins very pathetically lamented the unfortunate attachment
which both agreed sophia had to that young fellow; and mrs western
entirely attributed it to the folly of her brother‚Äôs man

eir inclinations in love thwarted, that they imagine they ought
never to carry enmity higher than upon these disappointments; again,
he will find it written much about the same place, that a woman who
hath once been pleased with the possession of a man, will go above
halfway to the devil, to prevent any other woman from enjoying the
same.

if he will not be contented with these reasons, i freely confess i see
no other motive to the actions of that lady, unless we will conceive
she was bribed by lord fellamar, which for my own part i see no cause
to suspect.

now this was the affair which mrs western was preparing to introduce
to sophia, by some prefatory discourse on the folly of love, and on
the wisdom of legal prostitution for hire, when her brother and blifil
broke abruptly in upon her; and hence arose all that coldness in her
behaviour to blifil, which, though the squire, as was usual with him,
imputed to a wrong cause, infused into blifil himself (he being a much
more cunning man) a suspicion

ance, and begged some of them at least would take care of the
wounded gentleman.

‚Äúay,‚Äù cries one of the fellows, ‚Äúthe wounded gentleman will be taken
care enough of; for i suppose he hath not many hours to live. as for
you, sir, you have a month at least good yet.‚Äù ‚Äúd--n me, jack,‚Äù said
another, ‚Äúhe hath prevented his voyage; he‚Äôs bound to another port
now;‚Äù and many other such jests was our poor jones made the subject of
by these fellows, who were indeed the gang employed by lord fellamar,
and had dogged him into the house of mrs fitzpatrick, waiting for him
at the corner of the street when this unfortunate accident happened.

the officer who commanded this gang very wisely concluded that his
business was now to deliver his prisoner into the hands of the civil
magistrate. he ordered him, therefore, to be carried to a
public-house, where, having sent for a constable, he delivered him to
his custody.

 himself.‚Äù ‚Äúhow! madam!‚Äù cries the aunt; ‚Äúis this the
return you make me for my kindness in relieving you from your
confinement at your father‚Äôs?‚Äù ‚Äúyou know, madam,‚Äù said sophia, ‚Äúthe
cause of that confinement was a refusal to comply with my father in
accepting a man i detested; and will my dear aunt, who hath relieved
me from that distress, involve me in another equally bad?‚Äù ‚Äúand do you
think then, madam,‚Äù answered mrs western, ‚Äúthat there is no difference
between my lord fellamar and mr blifil?‚Äù ‚Äúvery little, in my opinion,‚Äù
 cries sophia; ‚Äúand, if i must be condemned to one, i would certainly
have the merit of sacrificing myself to my father‚Äôs pleasure.‚Äù ‚Äúthen
my pleasure, i find,‚Äù said the aunt, ‚Äúhath very little weight with
you; but that consideration shall not move me. i act from nobler
motives. the view of aggrandizing my family, of ennobling yourself, is
what i proceed upon. have you no sense of ambition? are there no

e dangerous, and that the only way to succeed was to
press the match forward with such rapidity that the young lady should
have no time to reflect, and be obliged to consent while she scarce
knew what she did; in which manner, she said, one-half of the
marriages among people of condition were brought about. a fact very
probably true, and to which, i suppose, is owing the mutual tenderness
which afterwards exists among so many happy couples.

a hint of the same kind was given by the same lady to lord fellamar;
and both these so readily embraced the advice that the very next day
was, at his lordship‚Äôs request, appointed by mrs western for a private
interview between the young parties. this was communicated to sophia
by her aunt, and insisted upon in such high terms, that, after having
urged everything she possibly could invent against it without the
least effect, she at last agreed to give the highest instance of
complacence which any young lady can give, and consented to see his
lordship.

as conv

d--‚Äúis it then,
madam, that i am so unhappy to be the object of your dislike and
scorn; or will you pardon me if i suspect there is some other?‚Äù here
he hesitated, and sophia answered with some spirit, ‚Äúmy lord, i shall
not be accountable to you for the reasons of my conduct. i am obliged
to your lordship for the generous offer you have made; i own it is
beyond either my deserts or expectations; yet i hope, my lord, you
will not insist on my reasons, when i declare i cannot accept it.‚Äù
 lord fellamar returned much to this, which we do not perfectly
understand, and perhaps it could not all be strictly reconciled either
to sense or grammar; but he concluded his ranting speech with saying,
‚Äúthat if she had pre-engaged herself to any gentleman, however unhappy
it would make him, he should think himself bound in honour to desist.‚Äù
 perhaps my lord laid too much emphasis on the word gentleman; for we
cannot else well account for the indignation with which he inspired
sophia, who, in her answe

 an office to which she
could afford no better name than that of procuress.--this discovery
had greatly discomposed her temper, when, coming into the apartment
next to that in which the lovers were, she overheard sophia very
warmly protesting against his lordship‚Äôs addresses. at which the rage
already kindled burst forth, and she rushed in upon her niece in a
most furious manner, as we have already described, together with what
past at that time till his lordship‚Äôs departure.

no sooner was lord fellamar gone than mrs western returned to sophia,
whom she upbraided in the most bitter terms for the ill use she had
made of the confidence reposed in her; and for her treachery in
conversing with a man with whom she had offered but the day before to
bind herself in the most solemn oath never more to have any
conversation. sophia protested she had maintained no such
conversation. ‚Äúhow, how! miss western,‚Äù said the aunt; ‚Äúwill you deny
your receiving a letter from him yesterday?‚Äù ‚Äúa letter, m

say, against my consent.‚Äù ‚Äúindeed, indeed, miss,‚Äù cries
the aunt, ‚Äúyou ought to be ashamed of owning you had received it at
all; but where is the letter? for i will see it.‚Äù

to this peremptory demand, sophia paused some time before she returned
an answer; and at last only excused herself by declaring she had not
the letter in her pocket, which was, indeed, true; upon which her
aunt, losing all manner of patience, asked her niece this short
question, whether she would resolve to marry lord fellamar, or no? to
which she received the strongest negative. mrs western then replied
with an oath, or something very like one, that she would early the
next morning deliver her back into her father‚Äôs hand.

sophia then began to reason with her aunt in the following
manner:--‚Äúwhy, madam, must i of necessity be forced to marry at all?
consider how cruel you would have thought it in your own case, and how
much kinder your parents were in leaving you to your liberty. what
have i done to forfeit this

 the satisfaction he should
always have in hearing of her welfare.

the rest of the conversation which passed at the visit is not
important enough to be here related. the reader will, therefore,
forgive us this abrupt breaking off, and be pleased to hear how this
great good-will of the squire towards his daughter was brought about.

mrs western, on her first arrival at her brother‚Äôs lodging, began to
set forth the great honours and advantages which would accrue to the
family by the match with lord fellamar, which her niece had absolutely
refused; in which refusal, when the squire took the part of his
daughter, she fell immediately into the most violent passion, and so
irritated and provoked the squire, that neither his patience nor his
prudence could bear it any longer; upon which there ensued between
them both so warm a bout at altercation, that perhaps the regions of
billingsgate never equalled it. in the heat of this scolding mrs
western departed, and had consequently no leisure to acquaint he

own goodness: but mr
nightingale here saw him.‚Äù ‚Äúsaw whom, madam?‚Äù answered he. ‚Äúwhy, your
lawyer, sir,‚Äù said she, ‚Äúthat you so kindly sent to enquire into the
affair.‚Äù ‚Äúi am still in the dark, upon my honour,‚Äù said allworthy.
‚Äúwhy then do you tell him, my dear sir,‚Äù cries she. ‚Äúindeed, sir,‚Äù
 said nightingale, ‚Äúi did see that very lawyer who went from you when i
came into the room, at an alehouse in aldersgate, in company with two
of the fellows who were employed by lord fellamar to press mr jones,
and who were by that means present at the unhappy rencounter between
him and mr fitzpatrick.‚Äù ‚Äúi own, sir,‚Äù said mrs miller, ‚Äúwhen i saw
this gentleman come into the room to you, i told mr nightingale that i
apprehended you had sent him thither to inquire into the affair.‚Äù
 allworthy shewed marks of astonishment in his countenance at this
news, and was indeed for two or three minutes struck dumb by it. at
last, addressing himself to mr nightingale, he said, ‚Äúi mus

d by whom, on
the surgeons‚Äô oaths, that the wounded person was out of all manner of
danger from his wound, he was discharged.

one only of these lords, he said, he had ever seen before, and that no
more than once; but the other had greatly surprized him by asking his
pardon for an offence he had been guilty of towards him, occasioned,
he said, entirely by his ignorance who he was.

now the reality of the case, with which jones was not acquainted till
afterwards, was this:--the lieutenant whom lord fellamar had employed,
according to the advice of lady bellaston, to press jones as a
vagabond into the sea-service, when he came to report to his lordship
the event which we have before seen, spoke very favourably of the
behaviour of mr jones on all accounts, and strongly assured that lord
that he must have mistaken the person, for that jones was certainly a
gentleman; insomuch that his lordship, who was strictly a man of
honour, and would by no means have been guilty of an action which the
world in ge

neral would have condemned, began to be much concerned for
the advice which he had taken.

within a day or two after this, lord fellamar happened to dine with
the irish peer, who, in a conversation upon the duel, acquainted his
company with the character of fitzpatrick; to which, indeed, he did
not do strict justice, especially in what related to his lady. he said
she was the most innocent, the most injured woman alive, and that from
compassion alone he had undertaken her cause. he then declared an
intention of going the next morning to fitzpatrick‚Äôs lodgings, in
order to prevail with him, if possible, to consent to a separati

on
from his wife, who, the peer said, was in apprehensions for her life,
if she should ever return to be under the power of her husband. lord
fellamar agreed to go with him, that he might satisfy himself more
concerning jones and the circumstances of the duel; for he was by no
means easy concerning the part he had acted. the moment his lordship
gave a hint of his readiness to assist in the delivery of the lady, it
was eagerly embraced by the other nobleman, who depended much on the
authority of lord fellamar, as he thought it would greatly contribute
to awe fitzpatrick into a compliance; and perhaps he was in the right;
for the poor irishman no sooner saw these noble peers had undertaken
the cause of his wife than he submitted, and articles of separation
were soon drawn up and signed between the parties.

fitzpatrick, who had been so well satisfied by mrs waters concerning
the innocence of his wife with jones at upton, or perhaps, from some
other reasons, was now become so indifferent to that matte

r, that he
spoke highly in favour of jones to lord fellamar, took all the blame
upon himself, and said the other had behaved very much like a
gentleman and a man of honour; and upon that lord‚Äôs further enquiry
concerning mr jones, fitzpatrick told him he was nephew to a gentleman
of very great fashion and fortune, which was the account he had just
received from mrs waters after her interview with dowling.

lord fellamar now thought it behoved him to do everything in his power
to make satisfaction to a gentleman whom he had so grossly injured,
and without any consideration of rivalship (for he had now given over
all thoughts of sophia), determined to procure mr jones‚Äôs liberty,
being satisfied, as well from fitzpatrick as his surgeon, that the
wound was not mortal. he therefore prevailed with the irish peer to
accompany him to the place where jones was confined, to whom he
behaved as we have already related.
