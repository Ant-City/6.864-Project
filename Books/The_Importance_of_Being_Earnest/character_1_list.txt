Algernon Moncrieff - 
The play's secondary hero. Algernon is a charming,
idle, decorative bachelor, nephew of Lady Bracknell, cousin of Gwendolen
Fairfax, and best friend of Jack Worthing, whom he has known for
years as Ernest. Algernon is brilliant, witty, selfish, amoral, and
given to making delightful paradoxical and epigrammatic pronouncements.
He has invented a fictional friend, "Bunbury," an invalid whose
frequent sudden relapses allow Algernon to wriggle out of unpleasant
or dull social obligations.
