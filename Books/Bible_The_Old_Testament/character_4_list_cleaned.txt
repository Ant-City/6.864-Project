[CHARACTER] - 
                the
grandson of abraham, [CHARACTER] is the third patriarch of the israelite
people and the father of the twelve sons who form the tribes of
israel. [CHARACTER] experiences a life fraught with deception, bewilderment,
and change. he steals his brother esau's inheritance right and wrestles with
god on the banks of the jabbok river. appropriately, the nation
that springs from [CHARACTER]'s children derives its name from [CHARACTER]'s
god-given name, "israel." "israel" means "struggles with god," and
[CHARACTER]'s struggles are emblematic of the tumultuous story of the
nation of israel.
