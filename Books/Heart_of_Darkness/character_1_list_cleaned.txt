[CHARACTER] - 
                the
chief of the inner station and the object of marlow's quest. [CHARACTER]
is a man of many talents--we learn, among other things, that he is
a gifted musician and a fine painter--the chief of which are his
charisma and his ability to lead men. [CHARACTER] is a man who understands
the power of words, and his writings are marked by an eloquence
that obscures their horrifying message. although he remains an enigma
even to marlow, [CHARACTER] clearly exerts a powerful influence on the
people in his life. his downfall seems to be a result of his willingness
to ignore the hypocritical rules that govern european colonial conduct:
[CHARACTER] has "kicked himself loose of the earth" by fraternizing excessively with
the natives and not keeping up appearances; in so doing, he has
become wildly successful but has also incurred the wrath of his
fellow white men.
