 when scherk and schwarz proclaimed that string theory should be thought of as a
quantum theory incorporating the gravitational force, they did so because they had found that strings
necessarily  have  a  vibrational  pattern  in  their  repertoire  that  is massless  and  has  spin-2—the
hallmark features of the graviton. where there is a graviton there is also gravity.

supersymmetry and superpartners

as we have emphasized, the concept of spin, although superficially akin to the image of a spinning
top, differs in substantial ways that are rooted in quantum mechanics. its discovery in 1925 revealed
that  there  is  another  kind  of  rotational  motion  that  simply  would  not  exist  in  a  purely  classical
universe.

this suggests the following question: just as ordinary rotational motion allows for the symmetry
principle of rotational invariance ("physics treats all s

patial orientations on an equal footing"), could
it be that the more subtle rotational motion associated with spin leads to another possible symmetry of
the  laws  of  nature?  by  1971  or  so,  physicists  showed  that  the  answer  to  this  question  was  yes.
although  the  full  story  is  quite  involved,  the  basic  idea  is  that  when  spin  is  considered,  there  is
precisely one more symmetry of the laws of nature that is mathematically possible. it is known as
supersymmetry.3

supersymmetry cannot be associated with a simple and intuitive change in observational vantage
point; shifts in time, in spatial location, in angular orientation, and in velocity of motion exhaust these
possibilities.  but  just  as  spin  is  "like  rotational  motion,  with  a  quantum-mechanical  twist,"
supersymmetry  can  be  associated  with  a  change  in  observational  vantage  point  in  a  "quantum-
mechanical extension of space and time." these quotes are especially important, as the last sentenc

is  only  meant  to  give  a  rough  sense  of  where  supersymmetry  fits  into  the  larger  framework  of
symmetry  principles.4  nevertheless,  although  understanding  the  origin  of  supersymmetry  is  rather
subtle, we will focus on one of its primary implications—should the laws of nature incorporate its
principles—and this is far easier to grasp.

in  the  early  1970s,  physicists  realized  that  if  the  universe  is  supersymmetric,  the  particles  of
nature  must  come  in pairs  whose  respective  spins  differ  by  half  a  unit.  such  pairs  of  particles—
regardless of whether they are thought of as pointlike (as in the standard model) or as tiny vibrating
loops—are

 called superpartners. since matter particles have spin-1/2 while some of the messenger
particles  have  spin-1,  supersymmetry  appears  to  result  in  a  pairing—a  partnering—of  matter  and
force  particles.  as  such,  it  seems  like  a  wonderful  unifying  concept.  the  problem  comes  in  the
details.

by the mid-1970s, when physicists sought to incorporate supersymmetry into the standard model,
they found that none of the known particles—those of tables 1.1 and 1.2—could be superpartners of
one  another.  instead,  detailed  theoretical  analysis  showed  that  if  the  universe  incorporates
supersymmetry, then every known particle must have an as-yet-undiscovered superpartner particle,
whose  spin  is  half  a  unit  less  than  its  known  counterpart.  for  instance,  there  should  be  a  spin-0
partner  of  the  electron;  this  hypothetical  particl

been  named  the selectron  (a  contraction  of
supersymmetric-electron).  the  same  should  also  be  true  for  the  other  matter  particles,  with,  for
example, the hypothetical spin-0 superpartners of neutrinos and quarks being called sneutrinos and
squarks. similarly, the force particles should have spin-1/2 superpartners: for photons there should
be photinos, for the gluons there should be gluinos, for the w and z bosons there should be winos and
zinos.

on  closer  inspection,  then,  supersymmetry  seems  to  be  a  terribly  uneconomical  feature;  it

requires  a  whole  slew  of  additional  particles  that  wind  up  doubling  the  list  of  fundamental
ingredients. since none of the superpartner particles has ever been detected, you would be justified to
take rabi's remark from chapter 1 regarding the discovery of the muon one step further, declare that
"nobody ordered supersymmetry," and summarily reject this symmetry principle. for three reasons,
however,  many  physicists  belie

ve  strongly  that  such  an  out-of-hand  dismissal  of  supersymmetry
would be quite premature. let's discuss these reasons.

the case for supersymmetry: prior to string theory

first, from an aesthetic standpoint, physicists find it hard to believe that nature would respect almost,
but not quite all of the symmetries that are mathematically possible. of course, it is possible that an
incomplete utilization of symmetry is what actually occurs, but it would be such a shame. it would be

powerful rifle, so that it hits a specified target on the moon with a margin of error no greater than the
thickness  of  an  amoeba.  although  numerical  adjustments  of  an  analogous  precision  can  be  made
within  the  standard  model,  many  physicists  are  quite  suspect  of  a  theory  that  is  so  delicately
constructed that it falls apart if a number on which it depends is changed in the fifteenth digit after the
decimal point.5

supersymmetry  changes  this  drastically  because bosons—particles  whose  spin  is  a  whole
number (named after the indian physicist satyendra bose)—and fermions—particles whose spin is
half  of  a  whole  (odd)  number  (named  after  the  italian  physicist  enrico  fermi)—tend  to  give
cancelling  quantum-mechanical  contributions.  like  opposite  ends  of  a  seesaw,  when  the  quantum
jitters  of  a  boson  are  positive,  those  of  a  fermion  tend  to  be  negative,  and  vice  versa.

since
supersymmetry ensures that bosons and fermions occur in pairs, substantial cancellations occur from
the outset—cancellations that significantly calm some of the frenzied quantum effects. it turns out that
the consistency of the supersymmetric standard model—the standard model augmented by all of the
superpartner particles—no longer relies upon the uncomfortably delicate numerical adjustments of the
ordinary standard model. although this is a highly technical issue, many particle physicists find that

the third piece of circumstantial evidence for supersymmetry comes from the notion of grand
unification. one of the puzzling features of nature's four forces is the huge range in their intrinsic
strengths. the electromagnetic force has less than 1 percent of the strength of the strong force, the
weak  force  is  some  thousand  times  feebler  than  that,  and  the  gravitational  force  is  some  hundred
million billion billion billion (10-35) times weaker still. following the pathbreaking and ultimately

into  an  energy  realm  many  orders  of  magnitude  beyond  that  which  anyone  had  previously  dared

subsequent work at harvard by georgi, helen quinn, and weinberg in 1974 made the potential
unity of the nongravitational forces within the grand unified framework even more manifest. as their
contribution continues to play an important role in unifying the forces and in assessing the relevance
of supersymmetry to the natural world, let's spend a moment explaining it.

we are all aware that the electrical attraction between two oppositely charged particles or the
gravitational attraction between two massive bodies gets stronger as the distance between the objects
decreases.  these  are  simple  and  well-known  features  of  classical  physics.  there  is  a  surprise,
though, when we study the effect that quantum physics has on force strengths. why should quantum

hermann  fürstenau  of  the  university  of  karlsruhe,  germany,  recalculated  the  georgi,  quinn,  and
weinberg extrapolations making use of these experimental refinements and showed two significant
things.  first,  the  strengths  of  the  three  nongravitational  forces almost  agree,  but  not  quite  at  tiny
distance scales (equivalently, high energy/high temperature) as shown in figure 7.2. second, this tiny
but undeniable discrepancy in their strengths vanishes if supersymmetry is incorporated. the reason
is  that  the  new  superpartner  particles  required  by  supersymmetry  contribute  additional  quantum
fluctuations, and these fluctuations are just right to nudge the strengths of the forces to converge with
one another.

scales—equivalently, as they act on ever higher energy processes.

to many physicists, it is extremely difficult to believe that nature woul
 
 ___________________________
 
d choose the forces so
that  they almost, but not quite, have strengths that microscopically unify—microscopically become
equal.  it's  like  putting  together  a  jigsaw  puzzle  in  which  the  final  piece  is  slightly  misshapen  and

won't cleanly fit into its appointed position. supersymmetry deftly refines its shape so that all pieces
firmly lock into place.

figure 7.2 a refinement of the calculation of force strengths reveals that without supersymmetry they
almost, but not quite, meet.

another aspect of this latter realization is that it provides a possible answer to the question, why
haven't  we  discovered  any  of  the  superpartner  particles?  the  calculations  that  lead  to  the
convergence of the force strengths, as well as other considerations studied by a number of physicists,
indicate  that  the  superpartner  particles  must  be  a  good  deal  heavier  than  the  known  particles.
although no definitive predictions can be made,
 
 ___________________________
 
 studies show that the superpartner particles might be
a  thousand  times  as  massive  as  a  proton,  if  not  heavier. as  even  our  state-of-the-art  accelerators
cannot quite reach such energies, this provides an explanation for why these particles have not, as yet,
been  discovered.  in  chapter  9,  we  will  return  to  a  discussion  of  the  experimental  prospects  for
determining in the near future whether supersymmetry truly is a property of our world.

of  course,  the  reasons  we  have  given  for  believing  in—or  at  least  not  yet  rejecting—
supersymmetry are far from airtight. we have described how supersymmetry elevates our theories to
their most symmetric form—but you might suggest that the universe does not care about attaining the
most symmetric form that is mathematically possible. we have noted the important technical point that
supersymmetry  relieves  us  from  the  delicate  task  of

 tuning  numerical  parameters  in  the  standard
model to avoid subtle quantum problems—but you might argue that the true theory describing nature
may very well walk the fine edge between self-consistency and self-destruction. we have discussed
how  supersymmetry  modifies  the  intrinsic  strengths  of  the  three  nongravitational  forces  at  tiny
distances in just the right way for them to merge together into a grand unified force—but you might
argue, again, that nothing in the design of nature dictates that these force strengths must exactly match
on  microscopic  scales.  and  finally,  you  might  suggest  that  a  simpler  explanation  for  why  the
superpartner  particles  have  never  been  found  is  that  our  universe  is  not  supersymme

therefore, the superpartners do not exist.

no  one  can  refute  any  of  these  responses.  but  the  case  for  supersymmetry  is  strengthened

immensely when we consider its role in string theory.

supersymmetry in string theory

the original string theory that emerged from veneziano's work in the late 1960s incorporated all of
the symmetries discussed at the beginning of this chapter, but it did not incorporate supersymmetry
(which  had  not  yet  been  discovered).  this  first  theory  based  on  the  string  concept  was,  more
precisely,  called  the bosonic string theory.  the  name bosonic  indicates  that  all  of  the  vibrational
patterns of the bosonic string have spins that are a whole number—there are no fermionic patterns,
that is, no patterns with spins differing from a whole number by a half unit. this led to two problems.
first,  if  string  theory  was  to  describe  all  forces  and  all  matter

 subsequent
results of schwarz and andre neveu, a new version of string theory began to emerge. and much to
everyone's surprise, the bosonic and the fermionic patterns of vibration of this new theory appeared
to come in pairs. for each bosonic pattern there was a fermionic pattern, and vice versa. by 1977,
insights  of  ferdinando  gliozzi  of  the  university  of  turin,  scherk,  and  david  olive  of  imperial
college put this pairing into the proper light. the new string theory incorporated supersymmetry, and
the  observed  pairing  of  bosonic  and  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  reflected  this  highly  symmetric
character. supersymmetric string theory—superstring theory, that is—had been born. moreover, the
work of gliozzi, scherk, and olive had one other crucial result: they showed that the troublesome
tachyon vibration of the bosonic string does not afflict the superstring. slowly, the pieces of the string
puzzle were falling into place.

nevertheless, the major initial impact of th

e work of ramond, and also of neveu and schwarz,
was not actually in string theory. by 1973, the physicists julius wess and bruno zumino realized that
supersymmetry—the new symmetry emerging from the reformulation of string theory—was applicable
even to theories based on point particles. they rapidly made important strides toward incorporating
supersymmetry  into  the  framework  of  point-particle  quantum  field  theory. and  since,  at  the  time,
quantum field theory was the central rage of the mainstream particle-physics community—with string
theory increasingly becoming a subject on the fringe—the insights of wess and zumino launched a
tremendous amount of subsequent research on what has come to be called supersymmetric quantum
field theory. the supersymmetric standard model, discussed in the preceding section, is one of the
crowning the

oretical achievements of these pursuits; we now see that, through historical twists and
turns, even this point-particle theory owes a great debt to string theory.

with the resurgence of superstring theory in the mid-1980s, supersymmetry has re-emerged in the
context  of  its  original  discovery.  and  in  this  framework,  the  case  for  supersymmetry  goes  well
beyond that presented in the preceding section. string theory is the only way we know of to merge
general relativity and quantum mechanics. but it's only the supersymmetric version of string theory
that  avoids  the  pernicious  tachyon  problem  and  that  has  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  that  can
account  for  the  matter  particles  constituting  the  world  around  us.  supersymmetry  therefore  comes

claim  of  uniting  all  forces  and  all  of  matter.  if  string  theory  is  right,  physicists  expect  that  so  is
supersymmetry.

until  the  mid-1990s,  however,  one  particularly  troublesome  aspect  plagued  supersymmetric

string theory.

if someone tells you that they have solved the mystery of amelia earhart's fate, you might be skeptical
at first, but if they have a well-documented, thoroughly pondered explanation, you would probably
hear them out and, who knows, you might even be convinced. but what if, in the next breath, they tell

would  feel  no  closer  to  amelia  earhart's  true  fate  than  you  did  at  the  outset.  in  the  arena  of
fundamental explanations, more is definitely less.

by  1985,  string  theory—notwithstanding  the  justified  excitement  it  was  engendering—was
starting to sound like our overzealous earhart expert. the reason is that by 1985 physicists realized
that  supersymmetry,  by  then  a  central  element  in  the  structure  of  string  theory,  could  actually  be
incorporated into string theory in not one but five different ways. each method results in a pairing of
bosonic and fermionic vibrational patterns, but the details of this pairing as well as numerous other
properties of the resulting theories differ substantially. although their names are not all that important,
it's worth recording that these five supersymmetric string theories are called the type i t

requirement,  again,  is  that  all  of  these  dimensions  have  a  spatial  extent  smaller  than  the  smallest
length scales we can probe, since no experiment has yet revealed their existence.

the  most  promising  of  the  higher-dimensional  proposals  were  those  that  also  incorporated
supersymmetry. physicists hoped that the partial cancelling of the most severe quantum fluctuations,
arising from the pairing of superpartner particles, would help to soften the hostilities between gravity
and  quantum  mechanics.  they  coined  the  name higher-dimensional supergravity  to  describe  those
theories encompassing gravity, extra dimensions, and supersymmetry.

sing at first. the new equations resulting from the extra dimensions
were strikingly reminiscent of those used in the description of electromagnetism, and the strong and
the weak forces. but detailed scrutiny showed that the old conundrums persisted. most importantly,
the pernicious short-distance quantum undulations of space were lessened by supersymmetry, but not
sufficiently  to  yield  a  sensible  theory.  physicists  also  found  it  difficult  to  find  a  single,  sensible,
higher-dimensional theory incorporating all features of forces and matter.7

it  gradually  became  clear  that  bits  and  pieces  of  a  unified  theory  were  surfacing,  but  that  a
crucial element capable of tying them all together in a quantum-mechanically consistent manner was

ecific, aspects of a universe consisting of strings. generic in this
context refers to characteristics that are so fundamental to string theory that they are fairly insensitive
to, if not completely independent of, those detailed properties of the theory that are now beyond our
theoretical purview. such characteristics can be discussed with confidence, even with an incomplete
understanding of the full theory. in subsequent chapters we shall return to other examples, but for now
we focus on one: supersymmetry.

as  we  have  discussed,  a  fundamental  property  of  string  theory  is  that  it  is  highly  symmetric,
incorporating  not  only  intuitive  symmetry  principles  but  respecting,  as  well,  the  maximal
mathematical extension of these principles, supersymmetry. this means, as discussed in chapter 7,
that patterns of string vibrations come in pairs—superpartner pairs—differing from each other by a
half unit of spin. if string theory is right, then some of the string vibrations will

and that string theory is wrong. but many particle physicists feel that it means
that  the  superpartners  are  very  heavy  and  are  thus  beyond  our  current  capacity  to  observe

experimentally.  physicists  are  now  constructing  a  mammoth  accelerator  in  geneva,  switzerland,
called the large hadron collider. hopes run high that this machine will be powerful enough to find
the superpartner particles. the accelerator should be ready for operation before 2010, and shortly
thereafter supersymmetry may be confirmed experimentally. as schwarz has said, "supersymmetry
ought to be discovered before too long. and when that happens, it's going to be dramatic."17

you should bear in mind two things, though. even if superpartner particles are found, this fact
alone will not establish that string theory is correct. as we have seen, although supersymmetry was
discovered by studying string theory, it has also been successfully incorporated into point-particle
theories and is therefore not unique to

 determine the possible mass and force charges, they require
a  total  of  10  spacetime  dimensions,  their  curled-up  dimensions  must  be  in  one  of  the  calabi-yau
shapes,  etc.—and  for  this  reason  we  have  not  emphasized  their  differences  in  previous  chapters.
nevertheless,  analyses  in  the  1980s  showed  that  they  do  differ.  you  can  read  more  about  their
properties  in  the  endnotes,  but  it's  enough  to  know  that  they  differ  in  how  they  incorporate
supersymmetry as well as in significant details of the vibrational patterns they support.2 (type i string
theory, for example, has open strings with two loose ends in addition to the closed loops we have
focused on.) this has been an embarrassment for string theorists because although it's impressive to
have a serious proposal for the final unified theory, having five proposals takes significant wind from
the sails of each.

learn about features on the left side of the perpetrator's face by tracking him down and examining it.
but it is often far easier to invoke the left-right symmetry of faces.7

supersymmetry  is  a  more  abstract  symmetry  principle  that  relates  physical  properties  of
elementary  constituents  that  carry  different  amounts  of  spin.  at  best  there  are  only  hints  from
experimental  results  that  the  microworld  incorporates  this  symmetry,  but,  for  reasons  discussed
earlier, there is a strong belief that it does. it is certainly an integral part of string theory. in the 1990s,

realized that supersymmetry provides a sharp and incisive tool that can answer some very difficult
and important questions by indirect means.

even without understanding intricate details of a theory, the fact that it has supersymmetry built
in allows us to place significant constraints on the properties it can have. using a linguistic analogy,
imagine  that  we  are  told  that  a  sequence  of  letters  has  been  written  on  a  slip  of  paper,  that  the
sequence  has  exactly  three  occurrences,  say,  of  the  letter  "y,"  and  that  the  paper  has  been  hidden

subsequently given two further clues: the hidden sequence of letters spells out an english word and it
has the minimum number of letters consistent with the first clue of having three y's. from the infinite
number  of  letter  sequences  at  the  outset,  these  clues  reduce  the  possibilities  to one  word—to  the
shortest english word containing three y's: syzygy.

supersymmetry  supplies  similar  constraining  clues  for  those  theories  that  incorporate  its
symmetry  principles.  to  get  a  feel  for  this,  imagine  that  we  are  presented  with  a  physics  puzzle
analogous to the linguistic puzzle just described. hidden inside a box there is something—its identity
is left unspecified—that has a certain force charge. the charge might be electric, magnetic, or any of
the  other  generalizations,  but  to  be  concrete  let's  say  it  has  three  units  of

but let's now imagine that, as in the case of the linguistic puzzle, we are given two further clues:
the  theory  describing  the  world—and  hence  the  contents  of  the  box—is  supersymmetric,  and  the
contents of the box has the minimum mass consistent with the first clue of having three units of charge.
based on the insights of e. bogomol'nyi, manoj prasad, and charles sommerfield, physicists have
shown that this specification of a tight organizational framework (the framework of supersymmetry,
the analog of the english language) and a "minimality constraint" (minimum mass for a chosen amount
of electric charge, the analog of a minimum word length for a chosen number of y's) implies that the
identity of the hidden contents is nailed down uniquely. that is, merely by ensuring that the contents
of the box is the lightest it could possibly be and still have the specified charge, physicists showed
that its identity is fully established. constituents of minimum mass for a chosen value of

theories  for  a  range  of  possible  values  of  their  respective  coupling  constants,  both  less  than  and
greater  than  1—i.e.,  both  weak  and  strong  coupling.  but  traditional  perturbative  methods  give  no

insight into the strong coupling characteristics of any of the string theories.

recently,  by  making  use  of  the  power  of  supersymmetry,  physicists  have  learned  how  to
calculate some of the strong coupling properties of a given string theory. and to the surprise of most
everyone in the field, the strong coupling properties of the heterotic-o string appear to be identical to
the  weak  coupling  properties  of  the  type  i  string,  and  vice  versa.  moreover,  the  strong  coupling
physics of the type iib string is identical to its own properties when its coupling is weak. these

point-particle  theories  involving  gravity  and  quantum  mechanics  would  be  overcome  by  studying
theories with a great deal of symmetry. in 1976 stanley deser and bruno zumino working at cern,
and independantly, daniel freedman, sergio ferrara, and peter van nieuwenhuizen, all then of the

attempts  to  merge  general  relativity  with  quantum  mechanics  ultimately  met  with  failure.

discovered  in  the  1970s  and  1980s  are  now  understood  to  be  low-energy  relics  of  the  underlying
power of string theory. researchers studying ten-dimensional supergravity had uncovered the tip of a
very  deep  iceberg—the  rich  structure  of  superstring  theory.  in  fact,  it  turns  out  that  there  are  four
different  ten-dimensional  supergravity  theories  that  differ  in  details  regarding  the  precise  way  in
which  supersymmetry  is  incorporated.  three  of  these  turn  out  to  be  the  low-energy  point-particle
approximations to the type iia string, the type iib string, and the heterotic-e string. the fourth gives
the the low-energy point-particle approximation to both the type i string and the heterotic-o string;
in retrospect, this was the first indication of the close connection between these two string theories.

the challenge to the string theorist—or perhaps we should say the m-theorist—is to show that

some point on the theory map of figure 12.11 actually describes our universe. to do this requires
finding the full and exact equations whose solution will pick out this elusive point on the map, and
then  understanding  the  corresponding  physics  with  sufficient  precision  to  allow  comparisons  with
experiment. as

accomplished through the equivalence principle and the introduction of gravity into the structure of
the cosmos. although it requires some mathematical background to appreciate fully, as we indicated
in  chapter  5,  there  is  a  similar  rationale  behind  the  gauge  symmetries  underlying  the  three
nongravitational forces.

string theory takes us down another notch on the scale of explanatory depth because all of these
symmetry  principles,  as  well  as  another—supersymmetry—emerge  from  its  structure.  in  fact,  had
history followed a different course—and had physicists come upon string theory some hundred years
earlier—we can imagine that these symmetry principles would have all been discovered by studying
its properties. but bear in mind that whereas the equivalence principle gives us some understanding
of why gravity exists, and the gauge symmetries give us some sense of why the nongravitational forces
exist, in the context of string theory these symme

must incorporate both. string theory accomplishes this. second, studies by physicists over the past
century  have  revealed  that  there  are  other  key  ideas—many  of  which  have  been  experimentally
confirmed—that appear central to our understanding of the universe. these include the concepts of
spin, the family structure of matter particles, messenger particles, gauge symmetry, the equivalence
principle,  symmetry  breaking,  and  supersymmetry,  to  name  a  few.  all  of  these  concepts  emerge
naturally  from  string  theory.  third,  unlike  more  conventional  theories  such  as  the  standard  model,
which  has  19  free  parameters  that  can  be  adjusted  to  ensure  agreement  with  experimental
measurements,  string  theory  has  no  adjustable  parameters.  in  principle,  its  implications  should  be
thoroughly  definitive—they  should  provide  an  unambiguous  test  of  whether  the  theory  is  right  or
wrong.

at every step of the way, string theorists have sought and will continue to seek experimentally
observable  consequences  of  the  theory.  we  must  not  lose  sight  of  the  long-shot  possibilities  for
finding evidence of string theory discussed in chapter 9. furthermore, as our understanding deepens
there will, no doubt, be other rare processes or features of string theory that will suggest yet other
indirect experimental signatures.

but  most  notably,  the  confirmation  of  supersymmetry,  through  the  discovery  of  superpartner
particles  as  discussed  in  chapter  9,  would  be  a  major  milestone  for  string  theory.  we  recall  that
supersymmetry was discovered in the course of theoretical investigations of string theory, and that it
is  a  central  part  of  the  theory.  its  experimental  confirmation  would  be  a  compelling,  albeit
circumstantial,  piece  of  evidence  for  strings.  moreover,  finding  the  superpartner  particles  would

lenge, since the discovery of supersymmetry would do far more than merely
answer the yes-no question of its relevance to our world. the masses and charges of the superpartner
particles  would  reveal  the  detailed  way  in  which  supersymmetry  is  incorporated  into  the  laws  of
nature. string theorists would then face the challenge of seeing whether this implementation can be

fully realized or explained by string theory. of course, we can be even more optimistic and hope that
within  the  next  decade—before  the  large  hadron  collider  in  geneva  comes  on-line—the
understanding  of  string  theory  will  have  progressed  sufficiently  for  detailed  predictions  about  the
superpartners to be made prior to their hoped

of  the  other  possible  trajectories  and  therefore  applies  to  the  whole  quantum-
mechanical process itself. (feynman's formulation of point-particle quantum mechanics in the sum-
over-paths framework was generalized to string theory through the work of stanley mandelstam of the
university of california at berkeley and by the russian physicist alexander polyakov, who is now on
the faculty of the physics department of princeton university.)

3. the discovery and development of supersymmetry has a complicated history. in addition to
those  cited  in  the  text,  essential  early  contributions  were  made  by  r.  haag,  m.  sohnius,  j.  t.
lopuszanski, y. a. gol'fand, e. p. lichtman, j. l. gervais, b. sakita, v. p. akulov, d. v. volkov,
and v. a. soroka, among many others. some of their work is documented in rosanne di stefano,

4. for the mathematically inclined reader we note that this extension involves augmenting the
familiar  cartesian  coordinates  of  spacetime  with  new  quantum  coordinates,  say u  and v,  that  are
anticommuting: u × v =-v × u. supersymmetry can then be thought of as translations in this quantum-
mechanically augmented form of spacetime.

5. for the reader interested in more details of this technical issue we note the following. in note
6 of chapter 6 we mentioned that the standard model invokes a "mass-giving particle"—the higgs
boson—to endow the particles of tables 1.1 and 1.2 with their observed masses. for this procedure
to work, the higgs particle itself cannot be too heavy; studies show that its mass should certainly be

entical,  while  in  the  former,  they  are  exactly  opposite  in  form. opposite  has  a
precise mathematical meaning in this context, but it's easiest to think about in terms of the spins of the
resulting vibrational patterns in each theory. in the type iib theory, it turns out that all particles spin
in the same direction (they have the same chirality), whereas in the type iia theory, they spin in both
directions  (they  have  both  chiralities).  nevertheless,  each  theory  incorporates  supersymmetry.  the
two  heterotic  theories  differ  in  a  similar  but  more  dramatic  way.  each  of  their  clockwise  string
vibrations looks like those of the type ii string (when focusing on just the clockwise vibrations, the
type iia and type iib theories are the same), but their counterclockwise vibrations are those of the
original bosonic string theory. although the bosonic string has insurmountable problems when chosen
for  both  clockwise  and  counterclockwise  string  vibrations,  in  1985  d

g to make sense of this
perplexing union, gross and his collaborators showed that the extra 16 dimensions on the bosonic
side must be curled up into one of two very special higher-dimensional doughnutlike shapes, giving

rise to the heterotic-o and heterotic-e theories. since the extra 16 dimensions on the bosonic side
are rigidly curled up, each of these theories behaves as though it really has 10 dimensions, just as in
the type ii case. again, both heterotic theories incorporate a version of supersymmetry. finally, the
type i theory is a close cousin of the type iib string except that, in addition to the closed loops of
string we have discussed in previous chapters, it also has strings with unconnected ends—so-called
open strings.

3. when we speak of "exact" answers in this chapter, such as the "exact" motion of the earth,
what  we  really  mean  is  the  exact  prediction  for  some  physical  quantity within  some  chosen
theoretical framework. until we truly have the final theory—perhaps

being a calabi-yau manifold. this is why calabi-yau spaces play such a prominent role in
string theory.

7.  of  course,  nothing  absolutely  ensures  that  these  indirect  approaches  are  justified.  for
example,  just  as  some  faces  are  not  left-right  symmetric,  it might  be  that  the  laws  of  physics  are
different in other far-flung regions of the universe, as we will discuss briefly in chapter 14.

8. the expert reader will recognize that these statements require so-called n=2 supersymmetry.
9. to be a little more precise, if we call the heterotic-o coupling constant gho and the type i
coupling  constant gi,  then  the  relation  between  the  two  theories  states  that  they  are  physically
identical so long as gho = 1/gi, which is equivalent to gi = 1/gho. when one coupling constant is big
the other is small.

10. this is a close analog of the r, 1/r duality discussed previously. if we call the type iib
string coupling constant giib then the statement that appears to be true i
