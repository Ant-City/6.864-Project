or thou wert born a fool. camillo's flight,
added to their familiarity,--
which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
that lack'd sight only, nought for approbation,
but only seeing, all other circumstances
made up to th' deed,--doth push on this proceeding.
yet, for a greater confirmation,--
for, in an act of this importance, 'twere
most piteous to be wild,--i have despatch'd in post
to sacred delphos, to apollo's temple,
cleomenes and dion, whom you know
of stuff'd sufficiency: now, from the oracle
they will bring all, whose spiritual counsel had,
shall stop or spur me. have i done well?

well done, my lord,--

leontes.
though i am satisfied, and need no more
than what i know, yet shall the oracle
give rest to the minds of others such as he
whose ignorant credulity will not
come up to th' truth: so have we thought it good
from our free person she should be confin'd;

                 please your highness, posts
from those you sent to the oracle are come

being well arriv'd from delphos, are both landed,
hasting to the court.

                      so please you, sir, their speed

dion.
               the violent carriage of it

thus by apollo's great divine seal'd up,--
shall the contents discover, something rare
even then will rush to knowledge.--go,--fresh horses;--

you here shall swear upon this sword of justice,

you have not dar'd to break the holy seal,

sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
a saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make
which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
more penitence than done trespass: at the last,
do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
with them, forgive yourself.

                       true, too true, my lord;
if, one by one, you wedded all the world,
or from the all that are took something good,
to make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
would be unparallel'd.

leontes.
                       i think so.--kill'd!
she i kill'd! i did so: but thou strik'st me
sorely, to say i did: it is as bitter
upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
say so but seldom.

cleomenes.
                   not at all, good lady;
you might have spoken a thousand things that would
have done the time more benefit, and grac'd
your kindness better.

should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
should be 'remember mine!'

leontes.

and all eyes else dead coals!--fear thou no wife;
i'll have no wife, paulina.

paulina.
                            will you swear
never to marry but by my free leave?

never, paulina; so be bless'd my spirit!

paulina.
                              i have done.
yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
no remedy but you will,--give me the office
to choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
as was your former; but she shall be such
as, walk'd your first queen's ghost, it should take joy
to see her in you

        pardon, madam:
the one i have almost forgot,--your pardon;--
the other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
will have your tongue too. this is a creature,
would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
of all professors else; make proselytes
of who she but bid follow.

women will love her that she is a woman

for she did print your royal father off,
