[CHARACTER]([CHARACTER]) - 
an english physicist. young disproved newton's conception
of light as a stream of particles. by allowing light to pass through
two pinholes onto a screen, he found that the light beams spread
apart and overlapped. in the area of overlap, young saw bands of
bright light alternating with bands of darkness. with this demonstration,
he revived the century-old wave theory of light and established
the principle of interference of light.
