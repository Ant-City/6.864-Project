natural that he, after all, became the first one to join
shadrack--tar baby and the deweys--on national suicide
day. under eva's distant eye, and prey to her
idiosyncrasies, her own children grew up stealthily: pearl
married at fourteen and moved to flint, michigan, from
where she posted frail letters to her mother with two dollars
folded into the writing paper. sad little nonsense letters
about minor troubles, her husband's job and who the
children favored. hannah married a laughing man named
rekus who died when their daughter sula was about three
years old, at which time hannah moved back into her
mother's big house prepared to take care of it and her
mother forever. with the exception of boyboy, those peace
women loved all men. it was manlove that eva bequeathed
to her daughters. probably, people said, because there
were no men in the house, no men to run it. but actually that
was not true. the peace women simply loved maleness, for
its own sake. eva, old as she was, and with one leg, h

er people's affairs eva was equally prejudiced
about men. she fussed interminably with the brides of the
newly wed couples for not getting their men's supper ready
on time; about how to launder shirts, press them, etc. "yo'
man be here direc'lin. ain't it 'bout time you got busy?" "aw,
miss eva. it'll be ready. we just having spaghetti." "again?"
eva's eyebrows fluted up and the newlywed pressed her
lips together in shame. hannah simply refused to live
without the attentions of a man, and after rekus' death had
a steady sequence of lovers, mostly the husbands of her
friends and neighbors. her flirting was sweet, low and
guileless. without ever a pat of the hair, a rush to change
clothes or a quick application of paint, with no gesture
whatsoever, she rippled with sex. in her same old print
wraparound, barefoot in the summer, in the winter her feet
in a man's leather slippers with the backs flattened under
her heels, she made men aware of her behind, her slim
ankles, the dewsmooth skin and t

omen, who had both husbands
and affairs, because hannah seemed too unlike them,
having no passion attached to her relationships and being
wholly incapable of jealousy. hannah's friendships with
women were, of course, seldom and short-lived, and the
newly married couples whom her mother took in soon
learned what a hazard she was. she could break up a
marriage before it had even become one--she would make
love to the new groom and wash his wife's dishes all in an
afternoon. what she wanted, after rekus died, and what
she succeeded in having more often than not, was some
touching every day. the men, surprisingly, never gossiped
about her. she was unquestionably a kind and generous
woman and that, coupled with her extraordinary beauty and
funky elegance of manner, made them defend her and
protect her from any vitriol that newcomers or their wives
might spill. eva's last child, plum, to whom she hoped to
bequeath everything, floated in a constant swaddle of love
and affection, until 1917 when he
