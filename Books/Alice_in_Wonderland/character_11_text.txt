othing else to say but ‘it belongs to the duchess:
you’d better ask her about it.’

‘she’s in prison,’ the queen said to the executioner: ‘fetch her here.’
and the executioner went off like an arrow.

 the cat’s head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.




chapter ix. the mock turtle’s story

‘you can’t think how glad i am to see you again, you dear old thing!’
said the duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately into alice’s, and
they walked off together.

alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and thought
to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had made her so
savage when they met in the kitchen.

‘when i’m a duchess,’ she said to herself, (not in a very hopeful tone
though), ‘i won’t have any pepper in my kitchen at a

er left off quarrelling with
the other players, and shouting ‘off with his head!’ or ‘off with her
head!’ those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers,
who of course had to leave off being arches to do this, so that by
the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left, and all the
players, except the king, the queen, and alice, were in custody and
under sentence of execution.

then the queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to alice, ‘have
you seen the mock turtle yet?’

‘no,’ said alice. ‘i don’t even know what a mock turtle is.’

‘it’s the thing mock turtle soup is made from,’ said the queen.

‘i never saw one, or heard of one,’ said alice.

‘come on, then,’ said the queen, ‘and he shall tell you his history,’

as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low voice,
to the company generally, ‘you are all pardoned.’ ‘come, that’s a good
thing!’ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at t

up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. ‘what fun!’ said the gryphon,
half to itself, half to alice.

‘what is the fun?’ said alice.

‘why, she,’ said the gryphon. ‘it’s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. come on!’

‘everybody says “come on!” here,’ thought alice, as she went slowly
after it: ‘i never was so ordered about in all my life, never!’

they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. she
pitied him deeply. ‘what is his sorrow?’ she asked the gryphon, and the
gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, ‘it’s all his
fancy, that: he hasn’t got no sorrow, you know. come on!’

so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

‘this here young lady

,’ said the gryphon, ‘she wants for to know your
history, she do.’

‘i’ll tell it her,’ said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow tone: ‘sit
down, both of you, and don’t speak a word till i’ve finished.’

so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to
herself, ‘i don’t see how he can even finish, if he doesn’t begin.’ but
she waited patiently.

‘once,’ said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, ‘i was a real
turtle.’

these words were followed by a very long silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of ‘hjckrrh!’ from the gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, ‘thank you, sir, for your interesting story,’ but she could
not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

‘when we were little,’ the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly,
th

ough still sobbing a little now and then, ‘we went to school in the
sea. the master was an old turtle--we used to call him tortoise--’

‘why did you call him tortoise, if he wasn’t one?’ alice asked.

‘we called him tortoise because he taught us,’ said the mock turtle
angrily: ‘really you are very dull!’

‘you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,’
added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. at last the gryphon said
to the mock turtle, ‘drive on, old fellow! don’t be all day about it!’
and he went on in these words:

‘yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn’t believe it--’

‘i never said i didn’t!’ interrupted alice.

‘you
 
 ___________________________
 
 did,’ said the mock turtle.

‘hold your tongue!’ added the gryphon, before alice could speak again.
the mock turtle went on.

‘we had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--’

‘i’ve been to a day-school, too,’ said alice; ‘you needn’t be so proud
as all that.’

‘with extras?’ asked the mock turtle a little anxiously.

‘yes,’ said alice, ‘we learned french and music.’

‘and washing?’ said the mock turtle.

‘certainly not!’ said alice indignantly.

‘ah! then yours wasn’t a really good school,’ said the mock turtle in
a tone of great relief. ‘now at ours they had at the end of the bill,
“french, music, and washing--extra.”’

‘you couldn’t have wanted it much,’ said alice; ‘living at the bottom of
the sea.’

‘i couldn’t afford to learn it.’ said the mock turtle with a sigh. ‘i
only took the regular course.’

‘what was that?’ inquired alice.

‘reeling and
 
 ___________________________
 
 writhing, of course, to begin with,’ the mock turtle
replied; ‘and then the different branches of arithmetic--ambition,
distraction, uglification, and derision.’

‘i never heard of “uglification,”’ alice ventured to say. ‘what is it?’

the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. ‘what! never heard of
uglifying!’ it exclaimed. ‘you know what to beautify is, i suppose?’

‘yes,’ said alice doubtfully: ‘it means--to--make--anything--prettier.’

‘well, then,’ the gryphon went on, ‘if you don’t know what to 
 
 ___________________________
 
uglify is,
you are a simpleton.’

alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the mock turtle, and said ‘what else had you to learn?’

‘well, there was mystery,’ the mock turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers, ‘--mystery, ancient and modern, with
seaography: then drawling--the drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: he taught us drawling, stretching, and
fainting in coils.’

‘what was that like?’ said alice.

‘well, i can’t show it you myself,’ the mock turtle said: ‘i’m too
stiff. and the gryphon never learnt it.’

‘hadn’t time,’ said the gryphon: ‘i went to the classics master, though.
he w

as an old crab, he was.’

‘i never went to him,’ the mock turtle said with a sigh: ‘he taught
laughing and grief, they used to say.’

‘so he did, so he did,’ said the gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

‘and how many hours a day did you do lessons?’ said alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.

‘ten hours the first day,’ said the mock turtle: ‘nine the next, and so
on.’

‘what a curious plan!’ exclaimed alice.

‘that’s the reason they’re called lessons,’ the gryphon remarked:
‘because they lessen from day to day.’

this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. ‘then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?’

‘of course it was,’ said the mock turtle.

‘and how did you manage on the twelfth?’ alice went on eagerly.

‘that’s enough about less

ons,’ the gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: ‘tell her something about the games now.’




chapter x. the lobster quadrille

the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. ‘same as if he had a bone in his throat,’
said the gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. at last the mock turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks, he went on again:--

‘you may not have lived much under the sea--’ [‘i haven’t,’ said
alice)--‘and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--’
(alice began to say ‘i once tasted--’ but checked herself hastily, and
said ‘no, never’) ‘--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
lobster quadrille is!’

‘no, indeed,’ said alice. ‘what sort of a dance is it?’

‘why,’ said the grypho

n, ‘you first form into a line along the
sea-shore--’

‘two lines!’ cried the mock turtle. ‘seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you’ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--’

‘that generally takes some time,’ interrupted the gryphon.

‘--you advance twice--’

‘each with a lobster as a partner!’ cried the gryphon.

‘of course,’ the mock turtle said: ‘advance twice, set to partners--’

‘--change lobsters, and retire in same order,’ continued the gryphon.

‘then, you know,’ the mock turtle went on, ‘you throw the--’

‘the lobsters!’ shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air.

‘--as far out to sea as you can--’

‘swim after them!’ screamed the gryphon.

‘turn a somersault in the sea!’ cried the mock turtle, capering wildly
about.

‘change lobsters again!’ yelled the gryphon at the top of its voic

e.

‘back to land again, and that’s all the first figure,’ said the mock
turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at alice.

‘it must be a very pretty dance,’ said alice timidly.

‘would you like to see a little of it?’ said the mock turtle.

‘very much indeed,’ said alice.

‘come, let’s try the first figure!’ said the mock turtle to the gryphon.
‘we can do without lobsters, you know. which shall sing?’

‘oh, you sing,’ said the gryphon. ‘i’ve forgotten the words.’

so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 ‘“will you walk a little faster?” said a whiting to a snail.
 “there’s a porpoise close behind us, and he’s t

her side.
 the further off from england the nearer is to france--
 then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

 will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, will you join the dance?
 will you, won’t you, will you, won’t you, won’t you join the dance?”’

‘thank you, it’s a very interesting dance to watch,’ said alice, feeling
very glad that it was over at last: ‘and i do so like that curious song
about the whiting!’

‘oh, as to the whiting,’ said the mock turtle, ‘they--you’ve seen them,
of course?’

‘yes,’ said alice, ‘i’ve often seen them at dinn--’ she checked herself
hastily.

‘i don’t know where dinn may be,’ said the mock turtle, ‘but if you’ve
seen them so often, of course you know what they’re like.’

‘i believe so,’ alice replied thoughtfully. ‘they have their tails in
their mouths--and they’re all over crumbs.’

‘you’re wrong about the crumbs,’ said the mock turtle: ‘crumbs would all
wash off in
 
 ___________________________
 
 the sea. but they have their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is--’ here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--‘tell her
about the reason and all that,’ he said to the gryphon.

‘the reason is,’ said the gryphon, ‘that they would go with the lobsters
to the dance. so they got thrown out to sea. so they had to fall a long
way. so they got their tails fast in their mouths. so they couldn’t get
them out again. that’s all.’

‘thank you,’ said alice, ‘it’s very interesting. i never knew so much
about a whiting before.’

‘i can tell you more than that, if

ent on in a deep voice,
‘are done with a whiting. now you know.’

‘and what are they made of?’ alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

‘soles and eels, of course,’ the gryphon replied rather impatiently:
‘any shrimp could have told you that.’

‘if i’d been the whiting,’ said alice, whose thoughts were still running
on the song, ‘i’d have said to the porpoise, “keep back, please: we
don’t want you with us!”’

‘they were obliged to have him with them,’ the mock turtle said: ‘no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.’

‘wouldn’t it really?’ said alice in a tone of great surprise.

‘of course not,’ said the mock turtle: ‘why, if a fish came to me, and
told me he was going a journey, i should say “with what porpoise?”’

‘don’t you mean “purpose”?’ said alice.

‘i mean what i say,’ the mock turtle replied in an offended tone. and
the gryphon added ‘come, let’s hear some of your adventures.’

‘i could tell you

my adventures--beginning from this morning,’ said
alice a little timidly: ‘but it’s no use going back to yesterday,
because i was a different person then.’

‘explain all that,’ said the mock turtle.

‘no, no! the adventures first,’ said the gryphon in an impatient tone:
‘explanations take such a dreadful time.’

so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the white rabbit. she was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating ‘you ar

e old, father william,’ to the caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath,
and said ‘that’s very curious.’

‘it’s all about as curious as it can be,’ said the gryphon.

‘it all came different!’ the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully. ‘i
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. tell her to
begin.’ he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over alice.

‘stand up and repeat “‘tis the voice of the sluggard,”’ said the
gryphon.

‘how the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!’
thought alice; ‘i might as well be at school at once.’ however, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so full of the lobster

‘that’s different from what i used to say when i was a child,’ said the
gryphon.

‘well, i never heard it before,’ said the mock turtle; ‘but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.’

alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.

‘i should like to have it explained,’ said the mock turtle.

‘she can’t explain it,’ said the gryphon hastily. ‘go on with the next
verse.’

‘but about his toes?’ the mock turtle persisted. ‘how could he turn them
out with his nose, you know?’

‘it’s the first position in dancing.’ alice said; but w

‘what is the use of repeating all that stuff,’ the mock turtle
interrupted, ‘if you don’t explain it as you go on? it’s by far the most
confusing thing i ever heard!’

‘yes, i think you’d better leave off,’ said the gryphon: and alice was
only too glad to do so.

‘shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille?’ the gryphon went
on. ‘or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song?’

‘oh, a song, please, if the mock turtle would be so kind,’ alice
replied, so eagerly that the gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
‘

hm! no accounting for tastes! sing her “turtle soup,” will you, old
fellow?’

the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   who for such dainties would not stoop?
   soup of the evening, beautiful soup!

‘chorus again!’ cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of ‘the trial’s beginning!’ was heard in the
distance.

‘come on!’ cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

‘what trial is it?’ alice panted as she ran; but the gryphon only
answered ‘come on!’ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   ‘soo--oop of the e--e--evening,

would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the queen’s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtle’s
heavy sobs.

lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale, perhaps even
with the dream of wonderland of long ago: and how she would feel with
all their simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their
