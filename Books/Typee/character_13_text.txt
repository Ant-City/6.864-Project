ideas suggested by the feast of calabashes--inaccuracy of certain
published accounts of the islands--a reason--neglected state of
heathenism in the valley--effigy of a dead warrior--a singular
superstition--the priest kolory and the god moa artua--amazing religious
observance--a dilapidated shrine--kory-kory and the idol--an inference

although i had been baffled in my attempts to learn the origin of
the feast of calabashes, yet it seemed very plain to me that it was
principally, if not wholly, of a religious character. as a religious
solemnity, however, it had not at all corresponded with the horrible
descriptions of polynesian worship which we have received in some
published narratives, and especially in those ac

a curious evidence of this was given in a remarkable ceremony in which i
frequently saw mehevi and several other chefs and warriors of note take
part; but never a single female.

among those whom i looked upon as forming the priesthood of the valley,
there was one in particular who often attracted my notice, and whom
i could not help regarding as the head of the order. he was a noble
looking man, in the prime of his life, and of a most benignant aspect.
the authority this man, whose name was kolory, seemed to exercise over
the rest, the episcopal part he took in the feast of calabashes, his
sleek and complacent appearance, the mystic characters which were
tattooed upon his chest, and above all the mitre he frequently wore,
in the shape of a towering head-dress, consisting of part of a cocoanut
branch, the stalk planted uprightly on his brow, and the leaflets
gathered together and passed round the temples and behind the ears, all
these pointed him out as lord primate of typee. kolory was a

wore the dress of a
marquesan warrior, and always carried a long spear, which, instead of
terminating in a paddle at the lower end, after the general fashion of
these weapons, was curved into a heathenish-looking little image. this
instrument, however, might perhaps have been emblematic of his double
functions. with one end in carnal combat he transfixed the enemies of
his tribe; and with the other as a pastoral crook he kept in order his
spiritual flock. but this is not all i have to say about kolory.

his martial grace very often carried about with him what seemed to me
the half of a broken war-club. it was swathed round with ragged bits of
white tappa, and the upper part, which was intended to represent a
human head, was embellished with a strip of scarlet cloth of european
manufacture. it required little observation to discover that this
strange object was revered as a god. by the side of the big and lusty
images standing sentinel over the altars of the hoolah hoolah ground, it

e ti have just risen from their noontide
slumbers. there are no affairs of state to dispose of; and having eaten
two or three breakfasts in the course of the morning, the magnates of
the valley feel no appetite as yet for dinner. how are their leisure
moments to be occupied? they smoke, they chat, and at last one of their
number makes a proposition to the rest, who joyfully acquiescing, he
darts out of the house, leaps from the pi-pi, and disappears in the
grove. soon you see him returning with kolory, who bears the god moa
artua in his arms, and carries in one hand a small trough, hollowed out
in the likeness of a canoe. the priest comes along dandling his charge
as if it were a lachrymose infant he was endeavouring to put into a
good humour. presently entering the ti, he seats himself on the mats as
composedly as a juggler about to perform his sleight-of-hand tricks; and
with the chiefs disposed in a circle around him, commences his ceremony.
in the first place he gives moa artua an affect

caressingly lays him to his breast, and, finally, whispers something in
his ear; the rest of the company listening eagerly for a reply. but
the baby-god is deaf or dumb,--perhaps both, for never a word does, he
utter. at last kolory speaks a little louder, and soon growing angry,
comes boldly out with what he has to say and bawls to him. he put me in
mind of a choleric fellow, who, after trying in vain to communicated a
secret to a deaf man, all at once flies into a passion and screams it
out so that every one may hear. still moa artua remains as quiet as
ever; and kolory, seemingly losing his temper, fetches him a box over
the head, strips him of his tappa and red cloth, and laying him in
a state of nudity in a little tro

ugh, covers him from sight. at this
proceeding all present loudly applaud and signify their approval by
uttering the adjective ‘motarkee’ with violent emphasis. kolory however,
is so desirous his conduct should meet with unqualified approbation,
that he inquires of each individual separately whether under existing
circumstances he has not done perfectly right in shutting up moa artua.
the invariable response is ‘aa, aa’ (yes, yes), repeated over again
and again in a manner which ought to quiet the scruples of the most
conscientious. after a few moments kolory brings forth his doll again,
and while arraying it very carefully in the tappa and red cloth,

toilet being completed, he once
more speaks to it aloud. the whole company hereupon show the greatest
interest; while the priest holding moa artua to his ear interprets to
them what he pretends the god is confidentially communicating to him.
some items intelligence appear to tickle all present amazingly; for one
claps his hands in a rapture; another shouts with merriment; and a third
leaps to his feet and capers about like a madman.

what under the sun moa artua on these occasions had to say to kolory
i never could find out; but i could not help thinking that the former
showed a sad want of spirit in being disciplined into making those
disclosures, which at first he seemed bent on withholding. whether the
priest honestly interpreted what he believed the divinity said to him,
or whether he was not all the while guilty of a vile humbug, i shall
not presume to decide. at any rate, whatever as coming from the god
was imparted to those present seemed to be generally of a complimentary
nature: a f

act which illustrates the sagacity of kolory, or else the
timeserving disposition of this hardly used deity.

moa artua having nothing more to say, his bearer goes to nursing
him again, in which occupation, however, he is soon interrupted by a
question put by one of the warriors to the god. kolory hereupon snatches
it up to his ear again, and after listening attentively, once more
officiates as the organ of communication. a multitude of questions and
answers having passed between the parties, much to the satisfaction of
those who propose them, the god is put tenderly to bed in the trough,
and the whole company unite in a long chant, led off by kolory. this
ended, the ceremony is over; the chiefs rise to their feet in high good
humour, and my lord archbishop, after chatting awhile, and re

for my own part, although hardly a day passed while i remained upon the
island that i did not witness some religious ceremony or other, it was
very much like seeing a parcel of ‘freemasons’ making secret signs to
each other; i saw everything, but could comprehend nothing.

on the whole, i am inclined to believe, that the islanders in the
pacific have no fixed and definite ideas whatever on the subject of
religion. i am persuaded that kolory himself would be effectually posed
were he called upon to draw up the articles of his faith and pronounce
the creed by which he hoped to be saved. in truth, the typees, so far
as their actions evince, submitted to no laws human or divine--always
excepting the thrice mysterious taboo. the ‘independent electors’ of the
valley were not to be brow-beaten by chiefs, priests, idol or devils.
as for the luckless idols, they received more hard knocks than
supplications. i do not wonder that some of
