wafted on the music, she seemed to rise on shining wings, from which
flakes and spangles of gold fell off like stars, and she was gone.

tom woke. was it a dream? let it pass for one. but who shall say that
that sweet young spirit, which in life so yearned to comfort and console
the distressed, was forbidden of god to assume this ministry after
death?

     it is a beautiful belief,
     that ever round our head
     are hovering, on angel wings,
     the spirits of the dead.

cassy


â€œand behold, the tears of such as were oppressed, and they had no
comforter; and on the side of their oppressors there was power, but they
had no comforter.â€--eccl. 4:1

it took but a short time to familiarize tom with all that was to be
hoped or feared in his new way of life. he was an expert and efficient
workman in whatever he undertook; and was, both from habit and
principle, prompt and faithful. quiet and peaceable in his disposition,
he hoped, by unremitting diligence, to avert from

htning suddenly flashed from those black eyes;
and, facing about, with quivering lip and dilated nostrils, she drew
herself up, and fixed a glance, blazing with rage and scorn, on the
driver.

â€œdog!â€ she said, â€œtouch _me_, if you dare! iâ€™ve power enough, yet, to
have you torn by the dogs, burnt alive, cut to inches! iâ€™ve only to say
the word!â€

â€œwhat de devil you here for, den?â€ said the man, evidently cowed, and
sullenly retreating a step or two. â€œdidnâ€™t mean no harm, misse cassy!â€

â€œkeep your distance, then!â€ said the woman. and, in truth, the man
seemed greatly inclined to attend to something at the other end of the
field, and started off in quick time.

the woman suddenly turned to her work, and labored with a despatch that
was perfectly astonishing to tom. she seemed to work by magic. before
the day was through, her basket was filled, crowded down, and piled, and
she had several times put largely into tomâ€™s. long after dusk, the
whole weary train, with their

â€œho, ho! haw! haw! haw!â€ laughed both the sooty wretches; and the
diabolical sounds seemed, in truth, a not unapt expression of the
fiendish character which legree gave them.

â€œwal, but, masâ€™r, tom and misse cassy, and dey among â€˜em, filled lucyâ€™s
basket. i ruther guess der weight â€˜s in it, masâ€™r!â€

â€œ_i do the weighing!_â€ said legree, emphatically.

both the drivers again laughed their diabolical laugh.

â€œso!â€ he added, â€œmisse cassy did her dayâ€™s work.â€

â€œshe picks like de debil and all his angels!â€

â€œsheâ€™s got â€˜em all in her, i believe!â€ said legree; and, growling a
brutal oath, he proceeded to the weighing-room.

tomâ€™s basket was weighed and approved; and he looked, with an anxious
glance, for the success of the woman he had befriended.

tottering with weakness, she came forward, and delivered her basket. it
was of full weight, as legree well perceived; but, affecting anger, he
said,

â€œwhat, you lazy beast! short again! stand aside, youâ€™ll catch it, pretty
soon!â€

the woman gave a groan of utter despair, and sat down on a board.

the person who had been called misse cassy now came forward, and, with
a haughty, negligent air, delivered her basket. as she delivered it,
legree looked in her eyes with a sneering yet inquiring glance.

she fixed her black eyes steadily on him, her lips moved slightly, and
she said something in french. what it was, no one knew; but legreeâ€™s
face became perfectly demoniacal in its expression, as she spoke; he
half raised his hand, as if to strike,--a gesture which she regarded
with fierce disdain, as she turned and walked away.

k air swarmed with myriads of
mosquitos, which increased the restless torture of his wounds; whilst
a burning thirst--a torture beyond all others--filled up the uttermost
measure of physical anguish.

â€œo, good lord! _do_ look down,--give me the victory!--give me the
victory over all!â€ prayed poor tom, in his anguish.

a footstep entered the room, behind him, and the light of a lantern
flashed on his eyes.

â€œwhoâ€™s there? o, for the lordâ€™s massy, please give me some water!â€

the woman cassy--for it was she,--set down her lantern, and, pouring
water from a bottle, raised his head, and gave him drink. another and
another cup were drained, with feverish eagerness.

â€œdrink all ye want,â€ she said; â€œi knew how it would be. it isnâ€™t the
first time iâ€™ve been out in the night, carrying water to such as you.â€

â€œthank you, missis,â€ said tom, when he had done drinking.

â€œdonâ€™t call me missis! iâ€™m a miserable slave, like yourself,--a lower
one than you can ever be!â€ sai

fell on the floor, like one crushed and writhing under the extremity of
mental anguish.

there was a silence, a while, in which the breathing of both parties
could be heard, when tom faintly said, â€œo, please, missis!â€

the woman suddenly rose up, with her face composed to its usual stern,
melancholy expression.

â€œplease, missis, i saw â€˜em throw my coat in that arâ€™ corner, and in my
coat-pocket is my bible;--if missis would please get it for me.â€

cassy went and got it. tom opened, at once, to a heavily marked passage,
much worn, of the last scenes in the life of him by whose stripes we are
healed.

â€œif missis would only be so good as read that arâ€™,--itâ€™s better than
water.â€

cassy took the book, with a dry, proud air, and looked over the passage.
she then read aloud, in a soft voice, and with a beauty of intonation
that was peculiar, that touching account of anguish and of glory. often,
as she read, her voice faltered, and sometimes f

â€œbut why does he put us where we canâ€™t help but sin?â€ said the woman.

â€œi think we _can_ help it,â€ said tom.

again. i know â€˜em; iâ€™ve seen all their doings; i canâ€™t bear to think of

â€œcan i do anything more for you, my poor fellow?â€ she said, approaching
where tom lay; â€œshall i give you some more water?â€

there was a graceful and compassionate sweetness in her voice and
manner, as she said this, that formed a strange contrast with the former
wildness.

tom drank the water, and looked earnestly and pitifully into her face.

â€œo, missis, i wish youâ€™d go to him that can give you living waters!â€

â€œgo to him! where is he? who is he?â€ said cassy.

â€œhim that you read of to me,--the lord.â€

â€œi used to see the picture of him, over the altar, when i was a girl,â€
 said cassy, her dark eyes fixing themselves in an expression of mournful
reverie; â€œbut, _he isnâ€™t here!_ thereâ€™s nothing here, but sin and long,
long, long despair! o!â€ she laid her hand on her breast and drew in her
breath, as if to lift a heavy weight.

tom looked as if he would speak again; but she cut him short, with a
decided gesture.

with a wide, ample fireplace. it had once been hung with a showy

dogs, of whom we have before spoken, had encamped themselves among them,
to suit their own taste and convenience.

legree was just mixing himself a tumbler of punch, pouring his hot water
from a cracked and broken-nosed pitcher, grumbling, as he did so,

â€œplague on that sambo, to kick up this yer row between me and the new
hands! the fellow wonâ€™t be fit to work for a week, now,--right in the
press of the season!â€

â€œyes, just like you,â€ said a voice, behind his chair. it was the woman
cassy, who had stolen upon his soliloquy.

â€œhah! you she-devil! youâ€™ve come back, have you?â€

â€œyes, i have,â€ she said, coolly; â€œcome to have my own way, too!â€

â€œyou lie, you jade! iâ€™ll be up to my word. either behave yourself, or
stay down to the quarters, and fare and work with the rest.â€

â€œiâ€™d rather, ten thousand times,â€ said the woman, â€œlive in the dirtiest
hole at the quarters, than be under your hoof!â€

â€œbut you _are_ under my hoof, for all that,â€ said he, turn

â€œsimon legree, take care!â€ said the woman, with a sharp flash of her
eye, a glance so wild and insane in its light as to be almost appalling.
â€œyouâ€™re afraid of me, simon,â€ she said, deliberately; â€œand youâ€™ve reason
to be! but be careful, for iâ€™ve got the devil in me!â€

the last words she whispered in a hissing tone, close to his ear.

â€œget out! i believe, to my soul, you have!â€ said legree, pushing her
from him, and looking uncomfortably at her. â€œafter all, cassy,â€ he said,
â€œwhy canâ€™t you be friends with me, as you used to?â€

â€œused to!â€ said she, bitterly. she stopped short,--a word of choking
feelings, rising in her heart, kept her silent.

cassy had always kept over legree the kind of influence that a strong,
impassioned woman can ever keep over the most brutal man; but, of late,
she had grown more and more irritable and restless, under the hideous
yoke of her servitude, and her irritability, at times, broke out into
raving insanity; and t

his liability made her a sort of object of dread
to legree, who had that superstitious horror of insane persons which is
common to coarse and uninstructed minds. when legree brought emmeline to
the house, all the smouldering embers of womanly feeling flashed up in
the worn heart of cassy, and she took part with the girl; and a fierce
quarrel ensued between her and legree. legree, in a fury, swore she
should be put to field service, if she would not be peaceable. cassy,
with proud scorn, declared she _would_ go to the field. and she worked
there one day, as we have described, to show how perfectly she scorned
the threat.

legree was secretly uneasy, all day; for cassy had an influence over him
from which he could not free himself. when she presented her basket at
the scales, he had hoped for some concession, and addressed her in a
sort of half conciliatory, half scornful tone; and she had answered with
the bitterest contempt.

the outrageous treatment of poor

 tom had roused her still more; and she
had followed legree to the house, with no particular intention, but to
upbraid him for his brutality.

â€œi wish, cassy,â€ said legree, â€œyouâ€™d behave yourself decently.â€

â€œ_you_ talk about behaving decently! and what have you been doing?--you,
who havenâ€™t even sense enough to keep from spoiling one of your best
hands, right in the most pressing season, just for your devilish
temper!â€

â€œi was a fool, itâ€™s a fact, to let any such brangle come up,â€ said
legree; â€œbut, when the boy set up his will, he had to be broke in.â€

â€œi reckon you wonâ€™t break _him_ in!â€

r dollar, and a long, shining curl
of fair hair,--hair which, like a living thing, twined itself round
legreeâ€™s fingers.

â€œdamnation!â€ he screamed, in sudden passion, stamping on the floor, and
pulling furiously at the hair, as if it burned him. â€œwhere did this come
from? take it off!--burn it up!--burn it up!â€ he screamed, tearing it
off, and throwing it into the charcoal. â€œwhat did you bring it to me
for?â€

sambo stood, with his heavy mouth wide open, and aghast with wonder; and
cassy, who was preparing to leave the apartment, stopped, and looked at
him in perfect amazement.

â€œdonâ€™t you bring me any more of your devilish things!â€ said he, shaking
his fist at sambo, who retreated hastily towards the door; and, picking
up the silver dollar, he sent it smashing through the window-pane, out
into the darkness.

sambo was glad to make his escape. when he was gone, legree seemed a
little ashamed of his fit of alarm. he sat doggedly down in his chair,
and began sullenly sippin

cassy prepared herself for going out, unobserved by him; and slipped
away to minister to poor tom, as we have already related.

and what was the matter with legree? and what was there in a simple
curl of fair hair to appall that brutal man, familiar with every form
of cruelty? to answer this, we must carry the reader backward in his
history. hard and reprobate as the godless man seemed now, there had
been a time when he had been rocked on the bosom of a mother,--cradled

e, to sing and dance one of their hell
dances, and keep off these horrid notions,â€ said legree; and, putting
on his hat, he went on to the verandah, and blew a horn, with which he
commonly summoned his two sable drivers.

legree was often wont, when in a gracious humor, to get these two
worthies into his sitting-room, and, after warming them up with whiskey,
amuse himself by setting them to singing, dancing or fighting, as the
humor took him.

it was between one and two oâ€™clock at night, as cassy was returning
from her ministrations to poor tom, that she heard the sound of wild
shrieking, whooping, halloing, and singing, from the sitting-room,
mingled with the barking of dogs, and other symptoms of general uproar.

she came up on the verandah steps, and looked in. legree and both the
drivers, in a state of furious intoxication, were singing, whooping,
upsetting chairs, and making all manner of ludicrous and horrid grimaces
at each other.

fixedly at them;--there was a world of anguish, scorn, and fierce
bitterness, in her black eyes, as she did so. â€œwould it be a sin to rid

she turned hurriedly away, and, passing round to a back door, glided up
stairs, and tapped at emmelineâ€™s door.

emmeline and cassy


cassy entered the room, and found emmeline sitting, pale with fear,
in the furthest corner of it. as she came in, the girl started up
nervously; but, on seeing who it was, rushed forward, and catching her
arm, said, â€œo cassy, is it you? iâ€™m so glad youâ€™ve come! i was afraid
it was--. o, you donâ€™t know what a horrid noise there has been, down
stairs, all this evening!â€

â€œi ought to know,â€ said cassy, dryly. â€œiâ€™ve heard it often enough.â€

â€œo cassy! do tell me,--couldnâ€™t we get a

care where,--into the swamp among the snakes,--anywhere! _couldnâ€™t_ we
get _somewhere_ away from here?â€

â€œnowhere, but into our graves,â€ said cassy.

â€œdid you ever try?â€

â€œiâ€™ve seen enough of trying and what comes of it,â€ said cassy.

â€œiâ€™d be willing to live in the swamps, and gnaw the bark from trees.
i anâ€™t afraid of snakes! iâ€™d rather have one near me than him,â€ said
emmeline, eagerly.

â€œthere have been a good many here of your opinion,â€ said cassy; â€œbut you
couldnâ€™t stay in the swamps,--youâ€™d be tracked by the dogs, and brought
back, and then--then--â€

â€œwhat would he do?â€ said the girl, looking, with breathless interest,
into her face.

â€œwhat _wouldnâ€™t_ he do, youâ€™d better ask,â€ said c

down by the quarters, where you can see a black, blasted tree, and the
ground all covered with black ashes. ask anyone what was done there, and
see if they will dare to tell you.â€

â€œo! what do you mean?â€

â€œi wonâ€™t tell you. i hate to think of it. and i tell you, the lord only
knows what we may see tomorrow, if that poor fellow holds out as heâ€™s
begun.â€

â€œhorrid!â€ said emmeline, every drop of blood receding from her cheeks.
â€œo, cassy, do tell me what i shall do!â€

â€œwhat iâ€™ve done. do the best you can,--do what you must,--and make it up
in hating and cursing.â€

â€œhe wanted to make me drink some of his hateful brandy,â€ said emmeline;
â€œand i hate it so--â€

â€œyouâ€™d better drink,â€ said cassy. â€œi hated it, too; and now i canâ€™t live
without it. one must have something;--things donâ€™t look so dreadful,
when you take that.â€

â€œmother used to tell me never to touch any such thing,â€ said emmeline.

â€œpity you!--donâ€™t i? havenâ€™t i a daughter,--lord knows where she is,
and whose she is, now,--going the way her mother went, before her, i

t was; and shuddered, with creeping horror, though the
face was veiled. then he thought he felt _that hair_ twining round his
fingers; and then, that it slid smoothly round his neck, and tightened
and tightened, and he could not draw his breath; and then he thought
voices _whispered_ to him,--whispers that chilled him with horror. then
it seemed to him he was on the edge of a frightful abyss, holding on
and struggling in mortal fear, while dark hands stretched up, and were
pulling him over; and cassy came behind him laughing, and pushed him.
and then rose up that solemn veiled figure, and drew aside the veil. it
was his mother; and she turned away from him, and he fell down, down,
down, amid a confused noise of shrieks, and groans, and shouts of demon
laughter,--and legree awoke.

calmly the rosy hue of dawn was stealing into the room. the morning star
stood, with its solemn, holy eye of light, looking down on the man
of sin, from out the brightening sky. o, with what freshness, what

 there is no speech nor language where this voice is not heard; but the
bold, bad man heard it not. he woke with an oath and a curse. what to
him was the gold and purple, the daily miracle of morning! what to him
the sanctity of the star which the son of god has hallowed as his own
emblem? brute-like, he saw without perceiving; and, stumbling forward,
poured out a tumbler of brandy, and drank half of it.

â€œiâ€™ve had a h--l of a night!â€ he said to cassy, who just then entered
from an opposite door.

â€œyouâ€™ll get plenty of the same sort, by and by,â€ said she, dryly.

â€œwhat do you mean, you minx?â€

â€œyouâ€™ll find out, one of these days,â€ returned cassy, in the same tone.
â€œnow simon, iâ€™ve one piece of advice to give you.â€

â€œthe devil, you have!â€

â€œmy advice is,â€ said cassy, steadily, as she began adjusting some things
about the room, â€œthat you let tom alone.â€

â€œwhat business is â€˜t of yours?â€

â€œwhat? to be su

wonâ€™t lose your bet, i suppose? tompkins wonâ€™t lord it over you, i
suppose,--and youâ€™ll pay down your money like a lady, wonâ€™t you? i think
i see you doing it!â€

legree, like many other planters, had but one form of ambition,--to have
in the heaviest crop of the season,--and he had several bets on this
very present season pending in the next town. cassy, therefore, with
womanâ€™s tact, touched the only string that could be made to vibrate.

â€œwell, iâ€™ll let him off at what heâ€™s got,â€ said legree; â€œbut he shall
beg my pardon, and promise better fashions.â€

â€œthat he wonâ€™t do,â€ said cassy.

â€œwonâ€™t,--eh?â€

â€œno, he wonâ€™t,â€ said cassy.

â€œiâ€™d like to know _why_, mistress,â€ said legree, in the extreme of
scorn.

â€œbecause heâ€™s done right, and he knows it, and wonâ€™t say heâ€™s done
wrong.â€

â€œwho a cuss cares

â€œor, youâ€™ll lose your bet on the cotton crop, by keeping him out of the
field, just at this very press.â€

â€œbut he _will_ give up,--course, he will; donâ€™t i know what niggers is?
heâ€™ll beg like a dog, this morning.â€

â€œhe wonâ€™t, simon; you donâ€™t know this kind. you may kill him by
inches,--you wonâ€™t get the first word of confession out of him.â€

â€œweâ€™ll see,--where is he?â€ said legree, going out.

â€œin the waste-room of the gin-house,â€ said cassy.

legree, though he talked so stoutly to cassy, still sallied forth from
the house with a degree of misgiving which was not common with him. his
dreams of the past night, mingled with cassyâ€™s prudential suggestions,
considerably affected his mind. he resolved that nobody should be
witness of his encounter with tom; and determined, if he could not
subdue him by bullying, to defer his vengeance, to be wreaked in a more
convenient season.

looked in through the rude window of the shed where tom was lying; and,
as if descending on that star-beam, came the solemn words, â€œi am the
root and offspring of david, and the bright and morning star.â€ the
mysterious warnings and intimations of cassy, so far from discouraging
his soul, in the end had roused it as with a heavenly call. he did not
know but that the day of his death was dawning in the sky; and his heart
throbbed with solemn throes of joy and desire, as he thought that the
wondrous _all_, of which he had often pondered,--the great white throne,
with its ever radiant rainbow; the white-robed multitude, with voices as
many waters; the crowns, the palms, the harps,--might all break upon
his vision before that sun should set again.

â€œiâ€™ll make ye give out, though, â€˜fore iâ€™ve done!â€ said legree, in a
rage.

â€œi shall have _help_,â€ said tom; â€œyouâ€™ll never do it.â€

â€œwho the devilâ€™s going to help you?â€ said legree, scornfully.

â€œthe lord almighty,â€ said tom.

â€œd--n you!â€ said legree, as with one blow of his fist he felled tom to
the earth.

a cold soft hand fell on legreeâ€™s at this moment. he turned,--it was
cassyâ€™s; but the cold soft touch recalled his dream of the night before,
and, flashing through the chambers of his brain, came all the fearful
images of the night-watches, with a portion of the horror that
accompanied them.

â€œwill you be a fool?â€ said cassy, in french. â€œlet him go! let me alone
to get him fit to be in the field again. isnâ€™t it just as i told you?â€

they say the alligator, the rhinoceros, though enclosed in bullet-proof
mail, have each a spot where they are vulnerable; and

legree turned away, determined to let the point go for the time.

â€œwell, have it your own way,â€ he said, doggedly, to cassy.

â€œhark, ye!â€ he said to tom; â€œi wonâ€™t deal with ye now, because the
business is pressing, and i want all my hands; but i _never_ forget.
iâ€™ll score it against ye, and sometime iâ€™ll have my pay out oâ€™ yer old
black hide,--mind ye!â€

legree turned, and went out.

â€œthere you go,â€ said cassy, looking darkly after him; â€œyour reckoningâ€™s
to come, yet!--my poor fellow, how are you?â€

would watch, day after day, in the vague hope of seeing somebody sent
to redeem him; and, when nobody came, he would crush back to his soul
bitter thoughts,--that it was vain to serve god, that god had forgotten
him. he sometimes saw cassy; and sometimes, when summoned to the house,
caught a glimpse of the dejected form of emmeline, but held very little
communion with either; in fact, there was no time for him to commune
with anybody.

one evening, he was sitting, in utter dejection and prostration, by a
few decaying brands, where his coarse supper was baking. he put a few
bits of brushwood on the fire, and strove to raise the light, and then
drew his worn bible from his pocket. there were all the marked passages,

ignorant, has sprung up into fruit, whose abundance has shamed that of
higher and more skilful culture.

the poor mulatto woman, whose simple faith had been well-nigh crushed
and overwhelmed, by the avalanche of cruelty and wrong which had fallen
upon her, felt her soul raised up by the hymns and passages of holy
writ, which this lowly missionary breathed into her ear in intervals, as
they were going to and returning from work; and even the half-crazed
and wandering mind of cassy was soothed and calmed by his simple and
unobtrusive influences.

stung to madness and despair by the crushing agonies of a life, cassy
had often resolved in her soul an hour of retribution, when her hand
should avenge on her oppressor all the injustice and cruelty to which
she had been witness, or which _she_ had in her own person suffered.

one night, after all in tomâ€™s cabin were sunk in sleep, he was suddenly
aroused by seeing her face at the hole between the logs, that served for

tom came out the door. it was between one and two oâ€™clock at
night,--broad, calm, still moonlight. tom remarked, as the light of
the moon fell upon cassyâ€™s large, black eyes, that there was a wild and
peculiar glare in them, unlike their wonted fixed despair.

â€œcome here, father tom,â€ she said, laying her small hand on his wrist,
and drawing him forward with a force as if the hand were of steel; â€œcome
here,--iâ€™ve news for you.â€

â€œwhat, misse cassy?â€ said tom, anxiously.

â€œtom, wouldnâ€™t you like your liberty?â€

â€œi shall have it, misse, in godâ€™s time,â€ said tom. â€œay, but you may have

â€œnot for ten thousand worlds, misse!â€ said tom, firmly, stopping and
holding her back, as she was pressing forward.

â€œbut think of all these poor creatures,â€ said cassy. â€œwe might set them
all free, and go somewhere in the swamps, and find an island, and live
by ourselves; iâ€™ve heard of its being done. any life is better than
this.â€

â€œno!â€ said tom, firmly. â€œno! good never comes of wickedness. iâ€™d sooner

â€œthen _i_ shall do it,â€ said cassy, turning.

â€œno, no, no!â€ said tom, holding her small hands, which were clenched
with spasmodic violence. â€œno, ye poor, lost soul, that ye mustnâ€™t do.

cassy stood silent, while large, heavy tears dropped from her downcast
eyes.

â€œmisse cassy,â€ said tom, in a hesitating tone, after surveying her
in silence, â€œif ye only could get away from here,--if the thing was
possible,--iâ€™d â€˜vise ye and emmeline to do it; that is, if ye could go
without blood-guiltiness,--not otherwise.â€

you,--itâ€™s moreâ€™n you can stand,--and youâ€™d better go, if you can.â€

â€œi know no way but through the grave,â€ said cassy. â€œthereâ€™s no beast or
bird but can find a home some where; even the snakes and the alligators
have their places to lie down and be quiet; but thereâ€™s no place for us.
down in the darkest swamps, their dogs will hunt us out, and find
us. everybody and everything is against us; even the very beasts side
against us,--and where shall we go?â€

tom stood silent; at length he said,

by what strange law of mind is it that an idea long overlooked, and
trodden under foot as a useless stone, suddenly sparkles out in new
light, as a discovered diamond?

cassy had often revolved, for hours, all possible or probable schemes
of escape, and dismissed them all, as hopeless and impracticable; but
at this moment there flashed through her mind a plan, so simple and
feasible in all its details, as to awaken an instant hope.

â€œfather tom, iâ€™ll try it!â€ she said, suddenly.

â€œamen!â€ said tom; â€œthe lord help ye!â€

told stories about that garret should have an opportunity of
knowing what was there, for he would chain them up there for a week.
this hint was enough to repress talking, though, of course, it did not
disturb the credit of the story in the least.

gradually, the staircase that led to the garret, and even the
passage-way to the staircase, were avoided by every one in the house,
from every one fearing to speak of it, and the legend was gradually
falling into desuetude. it had suddenly occurred to cassy to make use
of the superstitious excitability, which was so great in legree, for the
purpose of her liberation, and that of her fellow-sufferer.

the sleeping-room of cassy was directly under the garret. one day,
without consulting legree, she suddenly took it upon her, with some
considerable ostentation, to change all the furniture and appurtenances
of the room to one at some considerable distance. the under-servants,
who were called on to effect this movement, were running and bustling
about

with great zeal and confusion, when legree returned from a ride.

â€œhallo! you cass!â€ said legree, â€œwhatâ€™s in the wind now?â€

â€œnothing; only i choose to have another room,â€ said cassy, doggedly.

â€œand what for, pray?â€ said legree.

â€œi choose to,â€ said cassy.

â€œthe devil you do! and what for?â€

â€œiâ€™d like to get some sleep, now and then.â€

â€œsleep! well, what hinders your sleeping?â€

â€œi could tell, i suppose, if you want to hear,â€ said cassy, dryly.

â€œspeak out, you minx!â€ said legree.

â€œo! nothing. i suppose it wouldnâ€™t disturb _you!_ only groans, and
people scuffing, and rolling round on the garret floor, half the night,
from twelve to morning!â€

â€œpeople up garret!â€ said legree, uneasily, but forcing a laugh; â€œwho are
they, cassy?â€

cassy raised her sharp, black eyes, and looked in the face of legree,
with an expression that went through his bones, as she said, â€œto be
sure, simon, who are they? iâ€™d like to h

ave _you_ tell me. you donâ€™t
know, i suppose!â€

with an oath, legree struck at her with his riding-whip; but she glided
to one side, and passed through the door, and looking back, said, â€œif
youâ€™ll sleep in that room, youâ€™ll know all about it. perhaps youâ€™d
better try it!â€ and then immediately she shut and locked the door.

legree blustered and swore, and threatened to break down the door;
but apparently thought better of it, and walked uneasily into the
sitting-room. cassy perceived that her shaft had struck home; and, from
that hour, with the most exquisite address, she never ceased to continue
the train of influences she had begun.

in a knot-hole of the garret, that had opened, she had inserted the neck
of an old bottle, in such a manner that when there was the least wind,
most doleful and lugubrious wailing sounds proceeded from it, which,
in a high wind, increased to a perfect shriek, such as to credulous and
superstitious ears might easily seem to be that o

kness and the shadow of death,â€ without any order,
where the light is as darkness. life and death to him are haunted
grounds, filled with goblin forms of vague and shadowy dread.

legree had had the slumbering moral elements in him roused by his
encounters with tom,--roused, only to be resisted by the determinate
force of evil; but still there was a thrill and commotion of the dark,
inner world, produced by every word, or prayer, or hymn, that reacted in
superstitious dread.

the influence of cassy over him was of a strange and singular kind. he
was her owner, her tyrant and tormentor. she was, as he knew, wholly,
and without any possibility of help or redress, in his hands; and yet so
it is, that the most brutal man cannot live in constant association with
a strong female influence, and not be greatly controlled by it. when
he first bought her, she was, as she said, a woman delicately bred; and
then he crushed her, without scruple, beneath the foot of his brutality.

 old sitting-room,
by the side of a flickering wood fire, that threw uncertain glances
round the room. it was a stormy, windy night, such as raises whole
squadrons of nondescript noises in rickety old houses. windows were
rattling, shutters flapping, and wind carousing, rumbling, and tumbling
down the chimney, and, every once in a while, puffing out smoke and
ashes, as if a legion of spirits were coming after them. legree had been
casting up accounts and reading newspapers for some hours, while cassy
sat in the corner; sullenly looking into the fire. legree laid down his
paper, and seeing an old book lying on the table, which he had noticed
cassy reading, the first part of the evening, took it up, and began
to turn it over. it was one of those collections of stories of bloody
murders, ghostly legends, and supernatural visitations, which, coarsely
got up and illustrated, have a strange fascination for one who once
begins to read them.

legree poohed and pished, but read, turning page after p

age, till,
finally, after reading some way, he threw down the book, with an oath.

â€œyou donâ€™t believe in ghosts, do you, cass?â€ said he, taking the tongs
and settling the fire. â€œi thought youâ€™d more sense than to let noises
scare _you_.â€

â€œno matter what i believe,â€ said cassy, sullenly.

â€œfellows used to try to frighten me with their yarns at sea,â€ said
legree. â€œnever come it round me that way. iâ€™m too tough for any such
trash, tell ye.â€

cassy sat looking intensely at him in the shadow of the corner. there
was that strange light in her eyes that always impressed legree with
uneasiness.

â€œthem noises was nothing but rats and the wind,â€ said legree. â€œrats will
make a devil of a noise. i used to hear â€˜em sometimes down in the hold
of the ship; and wind,--lordâ€™s sake! ye can make anything out oâ€™ wind.â€

cassy knew legree was uneasy under her eyes, and, therefore, she made
no answer, but sat fixing them on him, with that str

ange, unearthly
expression, as before.

â€œcome, speak out, woman,--donâ€™t you think so?â€ said legree.

â€œcan rats walk down stairs, and come walking through the entry, and open
a door when youâ€™ve locked it and set a chair against it?â€ said cassy;
â€œand come walk, walk, walking right up to your bed, and put out their
hand, so?â€

cassy kept her glittering eyes fixed on legree, as she spoke, and he
stared at her like a man in the nightmare, till, when she finished by
laying her hand, icy cold, on his, he sprung back, with an oath.

â€œwoman! what do you mean? nobody did?â€

â€œo, no,--of course not,--did i say they did?â€ said cassy, with a smile
of chilling derision.

â€œbut--did--have you really seen?--come, cass, what is it, now,--speak
out!â€

â€œyou may sleep there, yourself,â€ said cassy, â€œif you want to know.â€


 
 ___________________________
 
â€œdid it come from the garret, cassy?â€

â€œ_it_,--what?â€ said cassy.

â€œwhy, what you told of--â€

â€œi didnâ€™t tell you anything,â€ said cassy, with dogged sullenness.

legree walked up and down the room, uneasily.

â€œiâ€™ll have this yer thing examined. iâ€™ll look into it, this very night.
iâ€™ll take my pistols--â€

â€œdo,â€ said cassy; â€œsleep in that room. iâ€™d like to see you doing it.
fire your pistols,--do!â€

legree stamped his foot, and swore violently.

â€œdonâ€™t swear,â€ said cassy; â€œnobody knows who may be hearing you. hark!
what was that?â€

â€œwhat?â€ said legree, starting.

a heavy old dutch clock, that stood in the corner of the room, began,
and slowly struck twelve.

for some reason or other, legree neither spoke nor moved; a vague horror
fell on him; while cassy, with a keen, sneering glitter in her e

yes,
stood looking at him, counting the strokes.

â€œtwelve oâ€™clock; well _now_ weâ€™ll see,â€ said she, turning, and opening
the door into the passage-way, and standing as if listening.

â€œhark! whatâ€™s that?â€ said she, raising her finger.

â€œitâ€™s only the wind,â€ said legree. â€œdonâ€™t you hear how cursedly it
blows?â€

â€œsimon, come here,â€ said cassy, in a whisper, laying her hand on his,
and leading him to the foot of the stairs: â€œdo you know what _that_ is?
hark!â€

a wild shriek came pealing down the stairway. it came from the garret.
legreeâ€™s knees knocked together; his face grew white with fear.

â€œhadnâ€™t you better get your pistols?â€ said cassy, with a sneer that
froze legreeâ€™s blood. â€œitâ€™s time this thing was looked into, you know.
iâ€™d like to have you go up now; _theyâ€™re at it_.â€

â€œi wonâ€™t go!â€ said legre
 
 ___________________________
 
e, with an oath.

â€œwhy not? there anâ€™t any such thing as ghosts, you know! come!â€ and
cassy flitted up the winding stairway, laughing, and looking back after
him. â€œcome on.â€

â€œi believe you _are_ the devil!â€ said legree. â€œcome back you hag,--come
back, cass! you shanâ€™t go!â€

but cassy laughed wildly, and fled on. he heard her open the entry doors
that led to the garret. a wild gust of wind swept down, extinguishing
the candle he held in his hand, and with it the fearful, unearthly
screams; they seemed to be shrieked in his very ear.

legree fled frantically into the parlor, whither, in a few moments, he
was followed by cassy, pale, calm, cold as an avenging spirit, and with
that same fearful light in her eye.

â€œi hope you are satisfied,â€ said she.

â€œblast you, cass!â€
 
 ___________________________
 
 said legree.

â€œwhat for?â€ said cassy. â€œi only went up and shut the doors. _whatâ€™s the
matter with that garret_, simon, do you suppose?â€ said she.

â€œnone of your business!â€ said legree.

â€œo, it anâ€™t? well,â€ said cassy, â€œat any rate, iâ€™m glad _i_ donâ€™t sleep
under it.â€

anticipating the rising of the wind, that very evening, cassy had been
up and opened the garret window. of course, the moment the doors were
opened, the wind had drafted down, and extinguished the light.

this may serve as a specimen of the game that cassy played with legree,
until he would sooner have put his head into a lionâ€™s mouth than to have
explored that garret. meanwhile, in the night, when everybody else
was asleep, cassy slowly and carefully accumulated there a stock
of provisions sufficient to afford subsistence for some time; she
transferred

, article by article, a greater part of her own and
emmelineâ€™s wardrobe. all things being arranged, they only waited a
fitting opportunity to put their plan in execution.

by cajoling legree, and taking advantage of a good-natured interval,
cassy had got him to take her with him to the neighboring town, which
was situated directly on the red river. with a memory sharpened to
almost preternatural clearness, she remarked every turn in the road, and
formed a mental estimate of the time to be occupied in traversing it.

at the time when all was matured for action, our readers may, perhaps,
like to look behind the scenes, and see the final _coup dâ€™etat_.

it was now near evening, legree had been absent, on a ride to a
neighboring farm. for
 
 ___________________________
 
 many days cassy had been unusually gracious and
accommodating in her humors; and legree and she had been, apparently,
on the best of terms. at present, we may behold her and emmeline in the
room of the latter, busy in sorting and arranging two small bundles.

â€œthere, these will be large enough,â€ said cassy. â€œnow put on your bonnet,
and letâ€™s start; itâ€™s just about the right time.â€

â€œwhy, they can see us yet,â€ said emmeline.

â€œi mean they shall,â€ said cassy, coolly. â€œdonâ€™t you know that they must
have their chase after us, at any rate? the way of the thing is to be
just this:--we will steal out of the back door, and run down by the
quarters. sambo or quimbo will be sure to see us. they will give chase,
and we will get into the swamp; then, they canâ€™t follow us any further
till they go up and give the alarm, and turn out the dogs, and so on;
and, while they are blundering round, and tumbling over each other, as
they always do, you and i will

whip in at the back door, and up into the garret, where iâ€™ve got a nice
bed made up in one of the great boxes. we must stay in that garret a
good while, for, i tell you, he will raise heaven and earth after us.
heâ€™ll muster some of those old overseers on the other plantations, and
have a great hunt; and theyâ€™ll go over every inch of ground in that
swamp. he makes it his boast that nobody ever got away from him. so let
him hunt at his leisure.â€

â€œcassy, how well you have planned it!â€ said emmeline. â€œwho ever would
have thought of it, but you?â€

there was neither pleasure nor exultation in cassyâ€™s eyes,--only a
despairing firmness.

â€œcome,â€ she said, reaching her hand to emmeline.

the two fugitives glided noiselessly from the house, and flitted,
through the gathering shadows of evening, along by the quarters. the
crescent moon, set like a silver signet in the western sky, delayed a
little the approach of night. as cassy expected, 
 
 ___________________________
 
when quite near the
verge of the swamps that encircled the plantation, they heard a voice
calling to them to stop. it was not sambo, however, but legree, who was
pursuing them with violent execrations. at the sound, the feebler spirit
of emmeline gave way; and, laying hold of cassyâ€™s arm, she said, â€œo,
cassy, iâ€™m going to faint!â€

â€œif you do, iâ€™ll kill you!â€ said cassy, drawing a small, glittering
stiletto, and flashing it before the eyes of the girl.

the diversion accomplished the purpose. emmeline did not faint, and
succeeded in plunging, with cassy, into a part of the labyrinth of
swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for legree to
think of following them, without assistance.

â€œwell,â€ said he, chuckling brutally; â€œat any rate, theyâ€™ve got
themselves into a trap now--the baggage! theyâ€™re safe enough. they shall
sweat for it!â€

ass, if you like; itâ€™s time she was gone to the devil,
where she belongs; but the gal, not,â€ said legree. â€œand now, boys,
be spry and smart. five dollars for him that gets â€˜em; and a glass of
spirits to every one of you, anyhow.â€

the whole band, with the glare of blazing torches, and whoop, and
shout, and savage yell, of man and beast, proceeded down to the
swamp, followed, at some distance, by every servant in the house. the
establishment was, of a consequence, wholly deserted, when cassy and
emmeline glided into it the back way. the whooping and shouts of their
pursuers were still filling the air; and, looking from the sitting-room
windows, cassy and emmeline could see the troop, with their flambeaux,
just dispersing themselves along the edge of the swamp.

â€œsee there!â€ said emmeline, pointing to cassy; â€œthe hunt is begun! look
how those lights dance about! hark! the dogs! donâ€™t you hear? if we were
only _there_, our chances wouldnâ€™t be worth a picayune. o, for pityâ€

sake, do letâ€™s hide ourselves. quick!â€

â€œthereâ€™s no occasion for hurry,â€ said cassy, coolly; â€œthey are all
out after the hunt,--thatâ€™s the amusement of the evening! weâ€™ll go up
stairs, by and by. meanwhile,â€ said she, deliberately taking a key
from the pocket of a coat that legree had thrown down in his hurry,
â€œmeanwhile i shall take something to pay our passage.â€

she unlocked the desk, took from it a roll of bills, which she counted
over rapidly.

â€œo, donâ€™t letâ€™s do that!â€ said emmeline.

â€œdonâ€™t!â€ said cassy; â€œwhy not? would you have us starve in

the swamps,
or have that that will pay our way to the free states. money will do
anything, girl.â€ and, as she spoke, she put the money in her bosom.

â€œit would be stealing,â€ said emmeline, in a distressed whisper.

â€œstealing!â€ said cassy, with a scornful laugh. â€œthey who steal body and
soul neednâ€™t talk to us. every one of these bills is stolen,--stolen
from poor, starving, sweating creatures, who must go to the devil at
last, for his profit. let _him_ talk about stealing! but come, we may as
well go up garret; iâ€™ve got a stock of candles there, and some books to
pass away the time. you may be pretty sure they wonâ€™t come _there_ to
inquire after us. if they do, iâ€™ll play ghost for them.â€

when emmeline reached the g
 
 ___________________________
 
arret, she found an immense box, in which
some heavy pieces of furniture had once been brought, turned on its
side, so that the opening faced the wall, or rather the eaves. cassy
lit a small lamp, and creeping round under the eaves, they established
themselves in it. it was spread with a couple of small mattresses
and some pillows; a box near by was plentifully stored with candles,
provisions, and all the clothing necessary to their journey, which cassy
had arranged into bundles of an astonishingly small compass.

â€œthere,â€ said cassy, as she fixed the lamp into a small hook, which she
had driven into the side of the box for that purpose; â€œthis is to be our
home for the present. how do you like it?â€

â€œare you sure they wonâ€™t come and search the garret?â€

â€œiâ€™d like to see simon legree doing that,â€ said cassy. â€œno, indeed; he
will be too glad to keep away. as to the servants, they would any of
them stand and be shot, sooner 
 
 ___________________________
 
than show their faces here.â€

somewhat reassured, emmeline settled herself back on her pillow.

â€œwhat did you mean, cassy, by saying you would kill me?â€ she said,
simply.

â€œi meant to stop your fainting,â€ said cassy, â€œand i did do it. and now i
tell you, emmeline, you must make up your mind _not_ to faint, let what
will come; thereâ€™s no sort of need of it. if i had not stopped you, that
wretch might have had his hands on you now.â€

emmeline shuddered.

the two remained some time in silence. cassy busied herself with a
french book; emmeline, overcome with the exhaustion, fell into a doze,
and slept some time. she was awakened by loud shouts and outcries, the
tramp of horsesâ€™ feet, and the baying of

dogs. she started up, with a
faint shriek.

â€œonly the hunt coming back,â€ said cassy, coolly; â€œnever fear. look out
of this knot-hole. donâ€™t you see â€˜em all down there? simon has to give
up, for this night. look, how muddy his horse is, flouncing about in the
swamp; the dogs, too, look rather crestfallen. ah, my good sir, youâ€™ll
have to try the race again and again,--the game isnâ€™t there.â€

â€œo, donâ€™t speak a word!â€ said emmeline; â€œwhat if they should hear you?â€

â€œif they do hear anything, it will make them very particular to keep
away,â€ said cassy. â€œ

in the blackness of earthly darkness, the firmament of the unseen has
blazed with stars of new and significant lustre.

the morning-star now stands over the tops of the mountains, and gales
and breezes, not of earth, show that the gates of day are unclosing.

the escape of cassy and emmeline irritated the before surly temper of
legree to the last degree; and his fury, as was to be expected, fell
upon the defenceless head of tom. when he hurriedly announced the
tidings among his hands, there was a sudden light in tomâ€™s eye, a sudden
upraising of his hands, that did not escape him. he saw that he did not
join the muster of the pursuers. he thought of forcing him to do it;
but, having had, of old, experience of his inflexibility when commanded
to take part in any deed o

succeeded, well and good; if not, he would summon tom before him,
and--his teeth clenched and his blood boiled--_then_ he would break
the fellow down, or--there was a dire inward whisper, to which his soul
assented.

ye say that the _interest_ of the master is a sufficient safeguard for
the slave. in the fury of manâ€™s mad will, he will wittingly, and with
open eye, sell his own soul to the devil to gain his ends; and will he
be more careful of his neighborâ€™s body?

â€œwell,â€ said cassy, the next day, from the garret, as she reconnoitred
through the knot-hole, â€œthe huntâ€™s going to begin again, today!â€

three or four mounted horsemen were curvetting about, on the space
in front of the house; and one or two leashes of strange dogs were
struggling with the negroes who held them, baying and barking at each
other.

the men are, two of them, overseers of plantations in the vicinity;
and others were some of legreeâ€™s associates at the tavern-bar of a
neighboring city, who had

come for the interest of the sport. a more
hard-favored set, perhaps, could not be imagined. legree was serving
brandy, profusely, round among them, as also among the negroes, who had
been detailed from the various plantations for this service; for it was
an object to make every service of this kind, among the negroes, as much
of a holiday as possible.

cassy placed her ear at the knot-hole; and, as the morning air blew
directly towards the house, she could overhear a good deal of the
conversation. a grave sneer overcast the dark, severe gravity of her
face, as she listened, and heard them divide out the ground, discuss the
rival merits of the dogs, give orders about firing, and the treatment of
each, in case of capture.

cassy drew back; and, clasping her hands, looked upward, and said, â€œo,
great almighty god! we are _all_ sinners; but what have 
 
 ___________________________
 
_we_ done, more
than all the rest of the world, that we should be treated so?â€

there was a terrible earnestness in her face and voice, as she spoke.

â€œif it wasnâ€™t for _you_, child,â€ she said, looking at emmeline, â€œiâ€™d
_go_ out to them; and iâ€™d thank any one of them that _would_ shoot
me down; for what use will freedom be to me? can it give me back my
children, or make me what i used to be?â€

emmeline, in her child-like simplicity, was half afraid of the dark
moods of cassy. she looked perplexed, but made no answer. she only took
her hand, with a gentle, caressing movement.

â€œdonâ€™t!â€ said cassy, trying to draw it away; â€œyouâ€™ll get me to loving
you; and i never mean to love anything, again!â€

â€œpoor cassy!â€ said emmeline, â€œdonâ€™t feel so! if the lord gives us
liberty, perhaps heâ€™ll give you back your daughter; at any rate, iâ€™ll be
like a daughter to you. i know iâ€™ll never see my poor old mother again!
i shall love you, cassy, whether you lov

e me or not!â€

the gentle, child-like spirit conquered. cassy sat down by her, put
her arm round her neck, stroked her soft, brown hair; and emmeline then
wondered at the beauty of her magnificent eyes, now soft with tears.

â€œo, em!â€ said cassy, â€œiâ€™ve hungered for my children, and thirsted for
them, and my eyes fail with longing for them! here! here!â€ she said,
striking her breast, â€œitâ€™s all desolate, all empty! if god would give me
back my children, then i could pray.â€

â€œyou must trust him, cassy,â€ said emmeline; â€œhe is our father!â€

â€œhis wrath is upon us,â€ said cassy; â€œhe has turned away in anger.â€

â€œno, cassy! he will be good to us! let us hope in him,â€ said
emmeline,--â€œi always have had hope.â€

the hunt was long, animated, and thorough, but unsuccessful; and, with
grave, ironic exultation, cassy looked down on legree, as, weary and
dispirited, he alighted from his horse.

â€œnow, quimbo,â€ said legree, as he stretched himself down in the
sitting-room, â€œyou jest go and walk that tom up here, right away! the
old cuss is at the bottom of this yer whole matter; and iâ€™ll have it out
of his old black hide, or iâ€™ll know the reason why!â€

sambo and quimbo, both, though hating each other, were joined in one
mind by a no less cordial hatred of tom. legree had told them, at first,
that h

 in which he had always been so abundant.
truly, those poor disciples had little to give,--only the cup of cold
water; but it was given with full hearts.

tears had fallen on that honest, insensible face,--tears of late
repentance in the poor, ignorant heathen, whom his dying love and
patience had awakened to repentance, and bitter prayers, breathed over
him to a late-found saviour, of whom they scarce knew more than the
name, but whom the yearning ignorant heart of man never implores in
vain.

cassy, who had glided out of her place of concealment, and, by
overhearing, learned the sacrifice that had been made for her and
emmeline, had been there, the night before, defying the danger of
detection; and, moved by the last few words which the affectionate soul
had yet strength to breathe, the long winter of despair, the ice of
years, had given way, and the dark, despairing woman had wept and
prayed.

when george entered the shed, he felt his head giddy and his heart sick.

but legree locked his door and set a chair against it; he set a
night-lamp at the head of his bed; and put his pistols there. he
examined the catches and fastenings of the windows, and then swore he
â€œdidnâ€™t care for the devil and all his angels,â€ and went to sleep.

well, he slept, for he was tired,--slept soundly. but, finally, there
came over his sleep a shadow, a horror, an apprehension of something
dreadful hanging over him. it was his motherâ€™s shroud, he thought; but
cassy had it, holding it up, and showing it to him. he heard a confused
noise of screams and groanings; and, with it all, he knew he was
asleep, and he struggled to wake himself. he was half awake. he was sure
something was coming into his room. he knew the door was opening, but he
could not stir hand or foot. at last he turned, with a start; the door
_was_ open, and he saw a hand putting out his light.

it was a cloudy, misty moonlight, and there he saw it!--something white,
gliding in! he heard the

none could bear the horrors of that sick room, when he raved and
screamed, and spoke of sights which almost stopped the blood of those
who heard him; and, at his dying bed, stood a stern, white, inexorable
figure, saying, â€œcome! come! come!â€

by a singular coincidence, on the very night that this vision appeared
to legree, the house-door was found open in the morning, and some of the
negroes had seen two white figures gliding down the avenue towards the
high-road.

it was near sunrise when cassy and emmeline paused, for a moment, in a
little knot of trees near the town.

cassy was dressed after the manner of the creole spanish ladies,--wholly
in black. a small black bonnet on her head, covered by a veil thick
with embroidery, concealed her face. it had been agreed that, in
their escape, she was to personate the character of a creole lady, and
emmeline that of her servant.

she stopped in the outskirts of the town, where she had noticed trunks
for sale, and purchased a handsome one. this she requested the man to
send along with her. and, accordingly, thus escorted by a boy wheeling
her trunk, and emmeline behind her, carrying her carpet-bag and sundry
bundles, she made her appearance at the small tavern, like a lady of
consideration.

the first person that struck her, after her arrival, was george shelby,
who was staying there, awaiting the next boat.

cassy had remarked the young man from her loophole in the garret, and
seen him bear away the body of tom, and observed with secret exultation,
his rencontre with legree. subsequently she had gathered, from the
conversations she had overheard among the negroes, as she glided about
in her ghostly disguise, after nightfall, who he was, and in what
relation he stood to tom. she, therefore, felt an immediate accession of
confidence, when she found that he was, like herself, awaiting the next
boat.

cassyâ

€™s air and manner, address, and evident command of money, prevented
any rising disposition to suspicion in the hotel. people never inquire
too closely into those who are fair on the main point, of paying
well,--a thing which cassy had foreseen when she provided herself with
money.

in the edge of the evening, a boat was heard coming along, and george
shelby handed cassy aboard, with the politeness which comes naturally
to every kentuckian, and exerted himself to provide her with a good
state-room.

cassy kept her room and bed, on pretext of illness, during the whole
time they were on red river; and was waited on, with obsequious
devotion, by her attendant.

when they arrived at the mississippi river, george, having learned that
the course of the strange lady was upward, like his own, proposed to
take a state-room for her on the same boat with himself,--good-na

compassionating her feeble health, and desirous to do what he could to
assist her.

steamer cincinnati, and sweeping up the river under a powerful head of
steam.

cassyâ€™s health was much better. she sat upon the guards, came to the
table, and was remarked upon in the boat as a lady that must have been
very handsome.

from the moment that george got the first glimpse of her face, he was
troubled with one of those fleeting and indefinite likenesses, which
almost every body can remember, and has been, at times, perplexed
with. he could not keep himself from looking at her, and watching her
perpetually. at table, or sitting at her state-room door, still

cassy became uneasy. she began to think that he suspected something;
and finally resolved to throw herself entirely on his generosity, and
intrusted him with her whole history.

george was heartily disposed to sympathize with any one who had escaped
from legreeâ€™s plantation,--a place that he could not remember or speak
of with patience,--and, with the courageous disregard of consequences
which is characteristic of his age and state, he assured her that he
would do all in his power to protect and br

ing them through.

the next state-room to cassyâ€™s was occupied by a french lady, named de
thoux, who was accompanied by a fine little daughter, a child of some
twelve summers.

this lady, having gathered, from georgeâ€™s conversation, that he was from
kentucky, seemed evidently disposed to cultivate his acquaintance; in
which design she was seconded by the graces of her little girl, who
was about as pretty a plaything as ever diverted the weariness of a
fortnightâ€™s trip on a steamboat.

georgeâ€™s chair was often placed at her state-room

 door; and cassy, as
she sat upon the guards, could hear their conversation.

madame de thoux was very minute in her inquiries as to kentucky,
where she said she had resided in a former period of her life. george
discovered, to his surprise, that her former residence must have been
in his own vicinity; and her inquiries showed a knowledge of people and
things in his vicinity, that was perfectly surprising to him.

â€œdo you know,â€ said madame de thoux to him, one day, â€œof any man, in
your neighborhood, of t

â€œwas she born in your house?â€ said madame de thoux.

â€œno. father bought her once, in one of his trips to new orleans, and
brought her up as a present to mother. she was about eight or nine years
old, then. father would never tell mother what he gave for her; but, the
other day, in looking over his old papers, we came across the bill of
sale. he paid an extravagant sum for her, to be sure. i suppose, on
account of her extraordinary beauty.â€

george sat with his back to cassy, and did not see the absorbed
expression of her countenance, as he was giving these details.

at this point in the story, she touched his arm, and, with a face
perfectly white with interest, said, â€œdo you know the names of the
people he bought her of?â€

â€œa man of the name of simmons, i think, was the principal in the
transaction. at least, i think that was the name on the bill of sale.â€

â€œo, my god!â€ said cassy, and fell insensible on the floor of the cabin.

george was wide awake n

ow, and so was madame de thoux. though neither of
them could conjecture what was the cause of cassyâ€™s fainting, still they
made all the tumult which is proper in such cases;--george upsetting a
wash-pitcher, and breaking two tumblers, in the warmth of his humanity;
and various ladies in the cabin, hearing that somebody had fainted,
crowded the state-room door, and kept out all the air they possibly
could, so that, on the whole, everything was done that could be
expected.

poor cassy! when she recovered, turned her face to the wall, and wept
and sobbed like a child,--perhaps, mother, you can tell what she was
thinking of! perhaps you cannot,--but she felt as sure, in that hour,
that god had had mercy on her, and that she should see her daughter,--as
she did, months afterwards,--when--but we anticipate.

elings of humanity, was at the pains to send to cassy the bill
of sale of eliza; whose date and name all corresponded with her own
knowledge of facts, and felt no doubt upon her mind as to the identity
of her child. it remained now only for her to trace out the path of the
fugitives.

madame de thoux and she, thus drawn together by the singular coincidence
of their fortunes, proceeded immediately to canada, and began a tour of
inquiry among the stations, where the numerous fugitives from slavery
are located. at amherstberg they found the missionar

occupation in the shop of a worthy machinist, where he had been earning
a competent support for his family, which, in the mean time, had been

little harry--a fine bright boy--had been put to a good school, and was
making rapid proficiency in knowledge.

the worthy pastor of the station, in amherstberg, where george had first
landed, was so much interested in the statements of madame de thoux and
cassy, that he yielded to the solicitations of the former, to accompany
them to montreal, in their search,--she bearing all the expense of the
expedition.

the scene now changes to a small, neat tenement, in the outskirts of
montreal; the time, evening. a cheerful fire blazes on the hearth; a
tea-table, covered with a snowy cloth, stands prepared for the evening
meal. in one corner of the room was a table covered with a green cloth,
where was an open writing-desk, pens, paper, and over it a shelf of

not to let things out, except according to previous arrangement.

what was the good manâ€™s consternation, therefore, just as he
had motioned to the ladies to be seated, and was taking out his
pocket-handkerchief to wipe his mouth, so as to proceed to his
introductory speech in good order, when madame de thoux upset the whole
plan, by throwing her arms around georgeâ€™s neck, and letting all out at
once, by saying, â€œo, george! donâ€™t you know me? iâ€™m your sister emily.â€

cassy had seated herself more composedly, and would have carried on her
part very well, had not little eliza suddenly appeared before her in
exact shape and form, every outline and curl, just as her daughter was
when she saw her last. the little thing peered up in her face; and cassy
caught her up in her arms, pressed her to her bosom, saying, what, at
the moment she really believed, â€œdarling, iâ€™m your mother!â€

in fact, it was a troublesome matter to do up exactly in proper order;

a letter which we heard read, tells his friends that he is going back a
third time, that he may, at last, bring away his sister. my good sir,
is this man a hero, or a criminal? would not you do as much for your
sister? and can you blame him?

but, to return to our friends, whom we left wiping their eyes, and
recovering themselves from too great and sudden a joy. they are now
seated around the social board, and are getting decidedly companionable;
only that cassy, who keeps little eliza on her lap, occasionally
squeezes the little thing, in a manner that rather astonishes her, and
obstinately refuses to have her mouth stuffed with cake to the extent
the little one desires,--alleging, what the child rather wonders at,
that she has got something better than cake, and doesnâ€™t want it.

and, indeed, in two or three days, such a change has passed over cassy,
that our readers would scarcely know her. the despairing, haggard
expression of her face had given

nto her heart, as something for which it long had waited. indeed, her
love seemed to flow more naturally to the little eliza than to her own
daughter; for she was the exact image and body of the child whom she
had lost. the little one was a flowery bond between mother and daughter,
through whom grew up acquaintanceship and affection. elizaâ€™s steady,
consistent piety, regulated by the constant reading of the sacred
word, made her a proper guide for the shattered and wearied mind of her
mother. cassy yielded at once, and with her whole soul, to every good
influence, and became a devout and tender christian.

after a day or two, madame de thoux told her brother more particularly
of her affairs. the death of her husband had left her an ample fortune,
which she generously offered to share with the family. when she asked
george what way she could best apply it for him, he answered, â€œgive me
an education, emily; that has always been my heartâ€™s desire. then, i can
do all the rest.â€

d, that she was at last recommended,
and approved as a missionary to one of the stations in africa; and we
have heard that the same activity and ingenuity which, when a child,
made her so multiform and restless in her developments, is now employed,
in a safer and wholesomer manner, in teaching the children of her own
country.

p.s.--it will be a satisfaction to some mother, also, to state, that
some inquiries, which were set on foot by madame de thoux, have resulted
recently in the discovery of cassyâ€™s son. being a young man of energy,
he had escaped, some years before his mother, and been received and
educated by friends of the oppressed in the north. he will soon follow
his family to africa.

do very well in this life, but what will become of them in the next?â€™
they too were sent to new orleans; but were afterwards redeemed, at an
enormous ransom, and brought back.â€ is it not plain, from this, that the
histories of emmeline and cassy may have many counterparts?

justice, too, obliges the author to state that the fairness of mind and
generosity attributed to st. clare are not without a parallel, as
the following anecdote will show. a few years since, a young southern
gentleman was in cincinnati, with a favorite servant, who had been his
personal attendant from a boy. the young man took advantage of this
opportunity to secure his own freedom, and fled to the protection of
a quaker, who was quite noted in affairs of this kind.
