ves building barber shop, but this was also babbitt's
one embarrassment. himself, he patronized the glittering pompeian
barber shop in the hotel thornleigh, and every time he passed the
reeves shop--ten times a day, a hundred times--he felt untrue to his own
village.

now, as one of the squirearchy, greeted with honorable salutations by
the villagers, he marched into his office, and peace and dignity were
upon him, and the morning's dissonances all unheard.

they were heard again, immediately.

stanley graff, the outside salesman, was talking on the telephone with
tragic lack of that firm manner which disciplines clients: "say, uh, i
think i got just the house that would suit you--the percival house, in
linton.... oh, you've seen it. well, how'd it strike you?... huh?
...oh," irresolutely, "oh, i see."

as babbitt marched into his private room, a coop with semi-partition of
oak and frosted glass, at the back of the office, he reflected how hard
it was to find employees who had his own faith that he

 was going to make
sales.

there were nine members of the staff, besides babbitt and his partner
and father-in-law, henry thompson, who rarely came to the office. the
nine were stanley graff, the outside salesman--a youngish man given to
cigarettes and the playing of pool; old mat penniman, general utility
man, collector of rents and salesman of insurance--broken, silent, gray;
a mystery, reputed to have been a "crack" real-estate man with a firm
of his own in haughty brooklyn; chester kirby laylock, resident salesman
out at the glen oriole acreage development--an enthusiastic person with
a silky mustache and much family; miss theresa mcgoun, the swift and
rather pretty stenographe

l, like 'we lead, others
follow,' or 'eventually, why not now?' course i believe in using
poetry and humor and all that junk when it turns the trick, but with a
high-class restricted development like the glen we better stick to the
more dignified approach, see how i mean? well, i guess that's all, this
morning, chet."

by a tragedy familiar to the world of art, the april enthusiasm of chet
laylock served only to stimulate the talent of the older craftsman,
george f. babbitt. he grumbled to stanley graff, "that tan-colored voice
of chet's gets on my nerves," yet he was aroused and in one swoop he
wrote:

do you respect your loved ones?

when the last sad rites of bereavement are over, do you know for certain
that you have done your best for the departed? you haven't unless they
lie in the cemetery beautiful,

linden lane

the only strictly up-to-date burial place in or near zenith, where
exquisitely gardened plots look from daisy-dotted hill-slopes across the
smiling fields of dorchester.

he sent mat penniman to the recorder's office to dig out the names
of the owners of houses which were displaying for rent signs of other
brokers; he talked to a man who desired to lease a store-building for
a pool-room; he ran over the list of home-leases which were about to
expire; he sent thomas bywaters, a street-car conductor who played at
real estate in spare time, to call on side-street "prospects" who were
unworthy the strategies of stanley graff. but he had spent his credulous
excitement of creation, and these routine details annoyed him. one
moment of heroism he had, in discovering a new way of stopping smoking.

he stopped smoking at least once a month. he went through with it like
the solid citizen he was: admitted the evils of tobacco, courageously
made resolves, laid out plans to check the vice, tapered off his
allowance of cigars, and expounded the pleasures of virtuousness to
every one he met. he did everything, in fact, except

but as he went through the corridor of the reeves building he sighed,
"poor old paul! i got to--oh, damn noel ryland! damn charley mckelvey!
just because they make more money than i do, they think they're so
superior. i wouldn't be found dead in their stuffy old union club!
i--somehow, to-day, i don't feel like going back to work. oh well--"

he answered telephone calls, he read the four o'clock mail, he signed
his morning's letters, he talked to a tenant about repairs, he fought
with stanley graff.

young graff, the outside salesman, was always hinting that he deserved
an increase of commission, and to-day he complained, "i think i ought
to get a bonus if i put through the heiler sale. i'm chasing around and
working on it every single evening, almost."

babbitt frequently remarked to his wife that it was better to "con your
office-help along and keep 'em happy 'stead of jumping on 'em and poking
'em up--get more work out of 'em that way," but this unexampled lack of
appreciation hurt him

 the effect that there would undoubtedly be important tasks
to-morrow, and miss mcgoun and miss bannigan would do well to be there
early, and for heaven's sake remind him to call up conrad lyte soon 's
he came in. to-night he departed with feigned and apologetic liveliness.
he was as afraid of his still-faced clerks--of the eyes focused on him,
miss mcgoun staring with head lifted from her typing, miss bannigan
looking over her ledger, mat penniman craning around at his desk in the
dark alcove, stanley graff sullenly expressionless--as a parvenu before
the bleak propriety of his butler. he hated to expose his back to their
laughter, and in his effort to be casually merry he stammered and was
raucously friendly and oozed wretchedly out of the door.

but he forgot his misery when he saw from smith street the charms of
floral heights; the roofs of red tile and green slate, the shining new
sun-parlors, and the stainless walls.

he stopped to inform howard littlefield, his scholarly neighbor, that

babbitt was what he called a "joiner" for all these reasons.

behind the gold and scarlet banner of his public achievements was the
dun background of office-routine: leases, sales-contracts, lists of
properties to rent. the evenings of oratory and committees and lodges
stimulated him like brandy, but every morning he was sandy-tongued. week
by week he accumulated nervousness. he was in open disagreement with his
outside salesman, stanley graff; and once, though her charms had always
kept him nickeringly polite to her, he snarled at miss mcgoun for
changing his letters.

but in the presence of paul riesling he relaxed. at least once a week
they fled from maturity. on saturday they played golf, jeering, "as
a golfer, you're a fine tennis-player," or they motored all sunday
afternoon, stopping at village lunchrooms to sit on high stools at a
counter and drink coffee from thick cups. sometimes paul came over in
the evening with his violi

oan and see to it that the loan did not appear on the books of the
bank. thus certain of the options which babbitt and thompson obtained
were on parcels of real estate which they themselves owned, though the
property did not appear in their names.

in the midst of closing this splendid deal, which stimulated business
and public confidence by giving an example of increased real-estate
activity, babbitt was overwhelmed to find that he had a dishonest person
working for him.

the dishonest one was stanley graff, the outside salesman.

for some time babbitt had been worried about graff. he did not keep his
word to tenants. in order to rent a house he would promise repairs
which the owner had not authorized. it was suspected that he juggled
inventories of furnished houses so that when the tenant left he had
to pay for articles which had never been in the house and the price
of which graff put into his pocket. babbitt had not been able to prove
these suspicions, and though he had rather planned to discha

thus at once annoyed his competitor and acquired an excellent man.
young fritz was a curly-headed, merry, tennis-playing youngster. he made
customers welcome to the office. babbitt thought of him as a son, and in
him had much comfort.

an abandoned race-track on the outskirts of chicago, a plot excellent
for factory sites, was to be sold, and jake offut asked babbitt to
bid on it for him. the strain of the street traction deal and his
disappointment in stanley graff had so shaken babbitt that he found
it hard to sit at his desk and concentrate. he proposed to his family,
"look here, folks! do you know who's going to trot up to chicago for a
couple of days--just week-end; won't lose but one day of school--know
who's going with that celebrated business-ambassador, george f. babbitt?
why, mr. theodore roosevelt babbitt!"

"hurray!" ted shouted, and "oh, maybe the babbitt men won't paint that
lil ole town red!"
