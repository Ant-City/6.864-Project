t, but here my plan went slightly
wrong. emma was quite gay and responsive, but something about her hard,
handsome face warned me to lay off. i sensed that while she might willingly
surrender herself (in order to satisfy herself) she was far too sophisticated
and skilled in intrigue to compromise her position as jack's mistress by
revealing anything important to me. so as i danced and sparred with emma i
looked over the party for a second choice.
we were thrown together at the bar. her name was sybil and she
was one of those who assumed that my lectures on the woman question were
based upon a more intimate knowledge than the merely political and had
indicated several times a willingness to know me better. i had always
pretended not to understand, for not only had my first such experience taught
me to avoid such situations, but at the chthonian she was usually slightly
tipsy and wistful -- just the type of misunderstood married woman whom,
even if i had been interested, i would have avoided

could not tell if it were horror speaking to me ont of innocence, or innocence
emerging unscathed from the obscene scheme of the evening. i only knew
that the whole affair was a mistake. she had no information and i decided to
get her out of the apartment before i had to deal definitely with either the
horror or the innocence, while i could still deal with it as a joke. what
would rinehart do about this, i thought, and knowing, determined not to let
her provoke me to violence.
"but, sybil, you can see i'm not like that. you make me feel a
tender, protective passion -- look, it's like an oven in here, why don't we get
dressed and go for a walk in central park?"
"but i need it," she said, uncrossing her thighs and sitting up
eagerly. "you can do it, it'll be easy for you, beautiful. threaten to kill me if
i don't give in. you know, talk rough to me, beautiful. a friend of mine said
the fellow said, 'drop your drawers' . . . and --"
"he said what!" i said.

thing warmly,
infuriatingly feminine about her. i reached out, stroking her hand. "why do
you have such ideas about yourself?" i said, seeing her raise up and pluck at
the corner of the pillow, drawing out a speckled feather and stripping the
down from its shaft.
"repression," she said with great sophistication. "men have repressed
us too much. we're expected to pass up too many human things. but do you
know another secret?"
i bowed my head.
"you don't mind my going on, do you, beautiful?"
"no, sybil."
"well, ever since i first heard about it, even when i was a very little
girl, i've wanted it to happen to me."
"you mean what happened to your friend?"
"uh huh."
"good lord, sybil, did you ever tell that to anyone else?"
"of course not, i wouldn't've dared. are you shocked?"
"some. but sybil, why do you tell me?"
"oh, i know that i can trust you. i just knew you'd understand;
you're not like other men. we're kind of alike."
she was smiling now and reached out and pushed me gently, and i

glass into her hand. "it'll be
better after you've had a drink, more realistic."
"oh, yes, that'll be wonderful." she took a drink and looked up
thoughtfully. "i get so tired of living the way i do, beautiful. soon i'll be old
and nothing will've happened to me. do you know what that means? george
talks a lot about women's rights, but what does he know about what a
woman needs? him with his forty minutes of brag and ten of bustle. oh, you
have no idea what you're doing for me."
"nor you for me, sybil dear," i said, filling the glass again. at last
my drinks were beginning to work.
she shook her long hair out over her shoulders and crossed her
knees, watching me. her head had begun to weave.
"don't drink too much, beautiful," she said. "it always takes the pep
out of george."
"don't worry," i said. "i rapes real good when i'm drunk."
she looked startled. "ooooh, then pour me another," she said, giving
herself a bounce. she was as delighted as a child, holding out her glass
eagerly.

i was annoyed enough to slap her. she lay aggressively receptive,
flushed, her navel no goblet but a pit in an earth-quaking land, flexing taut
and expansive. then she said, "come on, come on!" and i said, "sure, sure,"
looking around wildly and starting to pour the drink upon her and was
stopped, my emotions locked, as i saw her lipstick lying on the table and
grabbed it, saying, "yes, yes," as i bent to write furiously across her belly in
drunken inspiration:

and paused there, trembling above her, my knees on the bed as she waited
with unsteady expectancy. it was a purplish metallic shade of lipstick and as
she panted with anticipation the letters stretched and quivered, up hill and
down dale, and she was lit up like a luminescent sign.
"hurry, boo'ful, hurry," she said.
i looked at her, thinking, just wait until george sees that -- if
george ever gets around to seeing that. he'll read a lecture on an aspect o

the woman question he's never thought about. she lay anonymous beneath my
eyes until i saw her face, shaped by her emotion which i could not fulfill,
and i thought, poor sybil, she picked a boy for a man's job and nothing was
as it was supposed to be. even the black bruiser fell down on the job. she'd
lost control of her liquor now and suddenly i bent and kissed her upon the
lips.
"shhh, be quiet," i said, "that's no way to act when you're being --"
and she raised her lips for more and i kissed her again and calmed her and
she dozed off and i decided again to end the farce. such games were for
rinehart, not me. i stumbled out and got a damp towel and began rubbing

"d'you do it, boo'ful?" she said.
"yes, of course," i said. "isn't that what you wanted?"
"yes, but i don't seem t'remember . . ."
i looked at her and wanted to laugh. she was trying to see me but
her eyes wouldn't focus am aer head kept swinging to one side, yet she was
making a real effort, and suddenly i felt lighthearted.
"by the way," i said, trying to do something with her hair, "what's
your name, lady?"
"it's sybil," she said indignantly, almost tearfully. "boo'ful, you know
i'm sybil."
"not when i grabbed you, i didn't."
her eyes widened and a smile wobbled across her face.
"that's right, you couldn't, could you? you never saw me before." she
was delighted, i could almost see the idea take form in her mind.
"that's right," i said. "i leaped straight out of the wall. i
overpowered you in the empty lobby -- remember? i smothered your terrified
screams."

"sure, it's good to be seen, but we've got to go now," i said seeing
her about to sag to the bed.
she pouted. "i need a lil nightcap, boo'ful," she said.
"you've had enough," i said.
"ah, boo'ful, jus' one . . ."
"okay, just one."
we had another drink and i looked at her and felt the pity and
self-disgust returning and was depressed.
she looked at me gravely, her head to one side.
"boo'ful," she said, "you know what lil ole sybil thinks? she thinks
you're trying to get rid of her."
i looked at her out of a deep emptiness and refilled her glass and
mine. what had i done to her, allowed her to do? had all of it filtered down
to me? my action . . . my -- the painful word formed as disconnectedly as
her wobbly smile -- my responsibility? all of it? i'm invisible. "here," i said,

"you too, boo'ful," she said.
"yes," i said. she moved into my arms.

a childhood prayer spilled through my mind like swift water. then: "hello," i
said.
it was a frantic, unrecognizable voice from the district. "brother, you
better get up here right away --" it said.
"i'm ill," i said. "what's wrong?"
"there's trouble, brother, and you're the only one who can --"
"what kind of trouble?"
"bad trouble, brother; they trying to --"
then the harsh sound of breaking glass, distant, brittle and fine,
followed by a crash, and the line went dead.
"hello," i said, seeing sybil wavering before me, her lips saying,
"boo'ful."
i tried to dial now, hearing the busy signal throbbing back at me:
amen-amen-amen ah man; and i sat there a while. was it a trick? did they
know she was with me? i put it down. her eyes were looking at me from
out of their blue shadow. "boo --"
and now i stood and pulled her arm. "let's go, sybil. they need me
uptown" -- realizing only then that i would go.
'"no," she said.
s'"but yes. come."
she fell back upon the bed defying me. i released her a

"come on," i said, taking her arm quite firmly, pulling her along as
she sighed, her wistful face turned toward me.
we went down smoothly into the street. my head was still badly
fuzzed from the drink, and when i looked down the huge emptiness of the
dark i felt like tears . . . what was happening uptown? why should i worry
over bureaucrats, blind men? i am invisible. i stared down the quiet street,
feeling her stumbling beside me, humming a little tune; something fresh, na?e
and carefree. sybil, my too-late-too-early love . . . ah! my throat throbbed.
the heat of the street clung close. i looked for a taxi but none was passing.
she hummed beside me, her perfume unreal in the night. we moved into the
next block and still no taxis. her high heels unsteadily scrunched the walk. i
stopped her.
"poor boo'ful," she said. "don't know his name . . ."
i turned as though struck. "what?"
"anonymous brute 'n boo'ful buck," she said, her mouth a bleary
smile.
i looked at her, skittering about on h

"sybil," i said, more to myself than to her, "where will it end?"
something told me to go.
"aaaah," she laughed, "in bed. don't go up, boo'ful, sybil'll tuck you
in."
i shook my head. the stars were there, high, high, revolving. then i
closed my eyes and they sailed red behind my lids; then somewhat steadied i
took her arm.
"look, sybil," i said, "stand here a minute while i go over to fifth
for a taxi. stand right here, dear, and hold on."
we tottered before an ancient-looking building, its windows dark.
huge greek medallions showed in spots of light upon its fa?de, above a dark
labyrinthine pattern in the stone, and i propped her against the stoop with
its carved stone monster. she leaned there, her hair wild, looking at me in
the street light, smiling. her face kept swinging to one side, her right eye
desperately closed.

late -- and who?
i hurried ahead, my feet unsteady.
"booo'ful," she called behind me, "boooooo'ful!"
i waved without looking back. never again, no more, no more. i
went on.
at fifth a cab passed and i tried to hail it, only to hear someone's
voice arise, the sound floating gaily by. i looked up the lighted avenue for
another, hearing suddenly the screech of brakes and turning to see the cab
stop and a white arm beckoning. the cab reversed, rolled close, settling with
a bounce. i laughed. it was sybil. i stumbled forward, came to the door. she
smiled out at me, her head, framed in the window, still pulling to one side,
her hair waving down.
"get in, boo'ful, 'n take me to harlem . . ."
i shook my head, feeling it heavy and sad. "no," i said, "i've got
work to do, sybil. you'd better go home . . ."
"no, boo'ful, take me with you."
i turned to the driver, my hand upon the door. he was small,
dark-haired and disapproving, a glint of red from the traffic light coloring the
tip of his nose.

plodded on, my head awhirl.
then near 110th street i saw her again. she was waiting beneath a
street lamp, waving. i wasn't surprised; i had become fatalistic. i came up
slowly, hearing her laugh. she was ahead of me and beginning to run,
barefoot, loosely, as in a dream. running. unsteadily but swift and me
surprised and unable to catch up, lead-legged, seeing her ahead and calling,
"sybil, sybil!" running lead-legged along the park side.
"come on, boo'ful," she called, looking back and stumbling. "catch
sybil . . . sybil," running barefoot and girdleless along the park.
i ran, the brief case heavy beneath my arm. something told me i
had to get to the office . . . "sybil, wait!" i called.
she ran, the colors of her dress flaring flamelike in the bright places
of the dark. a rustling motion, legs working awkwardly beneath her and white
heels flashing, her skirts held high. let her

 go, i thought. but now she was
crossing the street and running wildly only to go down at the curb and
standing and going down again, with a bumped backside, completely unsteady,
now that her momentum was gone.
"boo'ful," she said as i came up. "damn, boo'ful, you push me?"
"get up," i said without anger. "get up," taking her soft arm. she
stood, her arms flung wide for an embrace.
"no," i said, "this isn't thursday. i've got to get there . . . what do
they plan for me, sybil?"
"who, boo'ful?"
"jack and george . . . tobitt and all?"
"you ran me down, boo'ful," she said. "forget them . . . bunch of
dead-heads . . . unhipped, y'know. we didn't make this stinking world,
boo'ful. forget --"
i saw the taxi just in time, approaching swiftly from the corner, a
double-decker bus looming two blocks behind. the cabbie looked over, his
head out of the window, sitting high at the wheel as he made a swift u-turn
and came alongside. his face was shocked, disbelieving.
"come now,

sybil," i said, "and no tricks."
"pardon me, old man," the driver said, his voice concerned, "but
you're not taking her up in harlem are you?"
"no, the lady's going downtown," i said. "get in sybil."
"boo'ful's 'n ole dictator," she said to the driver, who looked at me
silently, as though i were mad.
"a game stud," he muttered, "a most game stud!"
but she got in.
"just 'n ole dictator, boo'ful."
"look," i told him, "take her straight home and don't let her get out
of the cab. i don't want her running around harlem. she's precious, a great
lady --"
"sure, man, i don't blame you," he said. "things is popping up
there."
the cab was already rolling as i yelled, "what's going on?"

ing the joint apart," he called above the shifting of the
gears. i watched them go and made for the bus stop. this time i'll make
sure, i thought, stepping out and flagging the bus and getting on. if she
comes back, she'll find me gone. and i knew stronger than ever that i should
hurry but was still too foggy in my mind, couldn't get myself together.
i sat gripping my brief case, my eyes closed, feeling the bus sailing
swift beneath me. soon it would turn up seventh avenue. sybil, forgive me, i
thought. the bus rolled.
but when i opened my eyes we were turning into riverside drive.
this too i accepted calmly, the whole night was out of joint. i'd had too
many drinks. time ran fluid, invisible, sad. looking out i could see a ship
moving upstream, its running lights bright points in the night. the cool sea
smell came through to me, constant and thick in the swiftly unfolding blur of
anchored boats, dark water and lights pouring past. across the river was

"you were there?" i said.
"same's i'm here. some fellow said the kid made the paddy mad by
grabbing a candy named after a white woman."
"damn if that's the way i heard it," another man said. "when i come
up they said a white woman set it oft by trying to take a black gal's man."
"damn who started it," dupre said. "all i want is for it to last a
while."
"it was a white gal, all right, but that wasn't the way it was. she was
drunk --" another voice said.
but it couldn't have been sybil, i thought; it had already started.
"you wahn know who started it?" a man holding a pair of binoculars
called from the window of a pawnshop. "you wahn really to know?"
"sure," i said.
"well, you don't need to go no further. it was started by that great
leader, ras the destroyer!"
"that monkey-chaser?" someone said.
"listen, bahstard!"
"don't nobody know how it started," dupre said.

wigs, expecting the relief of laughter, but suddenly was more devastated by
the humor than by the horror. but are they unreal, i thought; are they? what
