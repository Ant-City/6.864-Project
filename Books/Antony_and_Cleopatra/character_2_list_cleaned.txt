[CHARACTER] - 
 the nephew and adopted son of julius caesar. octavius
rules the roman empire with antony and lepidus. relations between
caesar and antony are strained throughout the play, for the young
triumvir believes that antony squanders his time and neglects his
duties while in egypt. ambitious and extremely pragmatic, octavius
lacks antony's military might as a general, but his careful and
stoic reasoning enables him to avoid antony's tendency toward heroic
or romantic folly. destined to be the first roman emperor (later renamed
caesar augustus), he symbolizes "western" values in the play, which
stand opposed to the exotic lures of cleopatra's "east."
