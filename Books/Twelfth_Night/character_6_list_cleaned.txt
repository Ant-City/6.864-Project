sir[CHARACTER] - 
                	olivia's
uncle. olivia lets sir[CHARACTER] belch live with her, but she does not
approve of his rowdy behavior, practical jokes, heavy drinking,
late-night carousing, or friends (specifically the idiotic sir andrew).
sir[CHARACTER] also earns the ire of malvolio. but sir[CHARACTER] has an ally, and
eventually a mate, in olivia's sharp-witted waiting-gentlewoman,
maria. together they bring about the triumph of chaotic spirit,
which sir[CHARACTER] embodies, and the ruin of the controlling, self-righteous
malvolio.
