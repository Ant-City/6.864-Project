ivanhoe was highly successful upon its appearance, and may be said to
have procured for its author the freedom of the rules, since he has ever
since been permitted to exercise his powers of fictitious composition in
england, as well as scotland.

the character of the fair jewess found so much favour in the eyes of
some fair readers, that the writer was censured, because, when arranging
the fates of the characters of the drama, he had not assigned the hand
of wilfred to rebecca, rather than the less interesting rowena. but, not
to mention that the prejudices of the age rendered such an union almost
impossible, the author may, in passing, observe, that he thinks a
character of a highly virtuous and lofty stamp, is degraded rather than
exalted by an attempt to reward virtue with temporal prosperity. such
is not the recompense which providence has deemed worthy of suffering
merit, and it is a dangerous and fatal doctrine to teach young persons,
the most common readers of

 romance, that rectitude of conduct and of
principle are either naturally allied with, or adequately rewarded by,
the gratification of our passions, or attainment of our wishes. in a
word, if a virtuous and self-denied character is dismissed with temporal
wealth, greatness, rank, or the indulgence of such a rashly formed or
ill assorted passion as that of rebecca for ivanhoe, the reader will be
apt to say, verily virtue has had its reward. but a glance on the great
picture of life will show, that the duties of self-denial, and the
sacrifice of passion to principle, are seldom thus remunerated; and
that the internal consciousness of their high-minded discharge of duty,
produces on their own reflections a more adequate recompense, in the
form of that peace which the world cannot give or take away.

isaac, who, richly and even magnificently dressed in a gaberdine
ornamented with lace and lined with fur, was endeavouring to make place
in the foremost row beneath the gallery for his daughter, the beautiful
rebecca, who had joined him at ashby, and who was now hanging on her
father’s arm, not a little terrified by the popular displeasure which
seemed generally excited by her parent’s presumption. but isaac, though
we have seen him sufficiently timid on other occasions, knew well that
at present he had nothing to fear. it was not in places of general
resort, or where their equals were assembled, that any avaricious or
malevolent noble durst offer him injury. at such meetings the jews

the quick eye of prince john instantly recognised the jew, but was
much more agreeably attracted by the beautiful daughter of zion, who,
terrified by the tumult, clung close to the arm of her aged father.

the figure of rebecca might indeed have compared with the proudest
beauties of england, even though it had been judged by as shrewd a
connoisseur as prince john. her form was exquisitely symmetrical,
and was shown to advantage by a sort of eastern dress, which she wore
according to the fashion of the females of her nation. her turban
of yellow silk suited well with the darkness of her complexion. the
brilliancy of her eyes, the superb arch of her eyebrows, her well-formed
aquiline nose, her teeth as white as pearl,

however, there was at least as much mockery as courtesy.

gay followers obsequiously joined. “but, daughter or wife, she should

others alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his

in the midst of prince john’s cavalcade, he suddenly stopt, and
appealing to the prior of jorvaulx, declared the principal business of
the day had been forgotten.

“by my halidom,” said he, “we have forgotten, sir prior, to name the
fair sovereign of love and of beauty, by whose white hand the palm is to
be distributed. for my part, i am liberal in my ideas, and i care not if
i give my vote for the black-eyed rebecca.”

“holy virgin,” answered the prior, turning up his eyes in horror, “a
jewess!--we should deserve to be stoned out of the lists; and i am not
yet old enough to be a martyr. besides, i swear by my patron saint, that
she is far inferior to the lovely saxon, rowena.”

“saxon or jew,” answered the prince, “saxon or jew, dog or hog, what
matters it? i say, name rebecca, were it only to mortify the saxon
churls.”

a murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.

in the broad hint which he dropped respecting the daughter of waldemar
fitzurse, john had more than one motive, each the offspring of a mind,
which was a strange mixture of carelessness and presumption with low
artifice and cunning. he wished to banish from the minds of the chivalry
around him his own indecent and unacceptable jest respecting the jewess
rebecca; he was desirous of conciliating alicia’s father waldemar,
of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself
dissatisfied during the course of the day’s proceedings. he had also a
wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for john was
at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition.
but besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against
the disinherited knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong
dislike) a powerful

pareira, the armourer of milan, besides seventy in the hundred of
profits, he cares for it as little as if he had found it in the
highways!”

“if he risks his own person and limbs, father,” said rebecca, “in doing
such a dreadful battle, he can scarce be expected to spare his horse and
armour.”

“child!” replied isaac, somewhat heated, “thou knowest not what thou
speakest--his neck and limbs are his own, but his horse and armour

nging to a wealthy israelite, with
whom isaac, his daughter, and retinue, had taken up their quarters; the
jews, it is well known, being as liberal in exercising the duties of
hospitality and charity among their own people, as they were alleged to
be reluctant and churlish in extending them to those whom they
termed gentiles, and whose treatment of them certainly merited little
hospitality at their hand.

in an apartment, small indeed, but richly furnished with decorations of
an oriental taste, rebecca was seated on a heap of embroidered cushions,
which, piled along a low platform that surrounded the chamber, served,
like the estrada of the spaniards, instead of chairs and stools. she
was watching the motions of her father with a look of anxious and
filial affection, while he paced the apartment with a dejected mien
and disordered step; sometimes clasping his hands together--sometimes
casting his eyes to the roof of the apartment, as one who laboured under
great mental tribulation. “o, jaco

holy fathers of our tribe! what a losing venture is this for one who
hath duly kept every jot and tittle of the law of moses--fifty zecchins
wrenched from me at one clutch, and by the talons of a tyrant!”

“but, father,” said rebecca, “you seemed to give the gold to prince john
willingly.”

“willingly? the blotch of egypt upon him!--willingly, saidst thou?--ay,
as willingly as when, in the gulf of lyons, i flung over my merchandise
to lighten the ship, while she laboured in the tempest--robed the
seething billows in my choice silks--perfumed their briny foam with
myrrh and aloes--enriched their caverns with gold and silver work! and
was not that an hour of unutterable misery, though my own hands made the
sacrifice?”

“but it was a sacrifice which heaven exacted to save our lives,”
 answered rebecca, “and the god of our fathers has since blessed your
store and your gettings.”

“ay,” answered isaac, “but if the tyrant lays hold on them as he did
to-day, and compels me to smile while he is robbing me?--o, daughter,
disinherited and wandering as we are, the worst evil which befalls our
race is, that when we are wronged and plundered, all the world laughs
around, and we are compelled to suppress our sense of injury, and to
smile tamely, when we would revenge bravely.”

some sort dependent on the dispersed children of zion, whom they despise
and persecute. without the aid of our wealth, they could neither furnish
forth their hosts in war, nor their triumphs in peace, and the gold
which we lend them returns with increase to our coffers. we are like the
herb which flourisheth most when it is most trampled on. even this day’s
pageant had not proceeded without the consent of th

the goodly steed and the rich armour, equal to the full profit of my
adventure with our kirjath jairam of leicester--there is a dead loss
too--ay, a loss which swallows up the gains of a week; ay, of the space
between two sabbaths--and yet it may end better than i now think, for
‘tis a good youth.”

“assuredly,” said rebecca, “you shall not repent you of requiting the
good deed received of the stranger knight.”

“i trust so, daughter,” said isaac, “and i trust too in the rebuilding
of zion; but as well do i hope with my own bodily eyes to see the walls
and battlements of the new temple, as to see a christian, yea, the very
best of christians, repay a debt to a jew, unless under the awe of the
judge and jailor.”

so saying, he resumed his discontented walk through the apartment; and
rebecca, perceiving t

ver; for, in the interior of their houses, the
jews refused themselves no expensive indulgences. at the same time the
servant informed isaac, that a nazarene (so they termed christians,
while conversing among themselves) desired to speak with him. he that
would live by traffic, must hold himself at the disposal of every one
claiming business with him. isaac at once replaced on the table the
untasted glass of greek wine which he had just raised to his lips, and
saying hastily to his daughter, “rebecca, veil thyself,” commanded the
stranger to be admitted.

just as rebecca had dropped over her fine features a screen of silver
gauze which reached to her feet, the door opened, and gurth entered,
wrapt in the ample folds of his norman mantle. his appearance was rather
suspicious than prepossessing, especially as, instead of doffing his
bonnet, he pulled it still deeper over his rugged brow.

“art thou isaac the jew of york?” said gurth, in saxon.

“i am,” replied isaac, in the same lan

 will reward thee handsomely.--surely,” he added, looking
earnestly at the bag, “thou hast more coins in that pouch?”

gurth grinned, which was his nearest approach to a laugh, as he replied,
“about the same quantity which thou hast just told over so carefully.”
 he then folded the quittance, and put it under his cap, adding,--“peril
of thy beard, jew, see that this be full and ample!” he filled himself
unbidden, a third goblet of wine, and left the apartment without
ceremony.

“rebecca,” said the jew, “that ishmaelite hath gone somewhat beyond me.
nevertheless his master is a good youth--ay, and i am well pleased that
he hath gained shekels of gold and shekels of silver, even by the speed
of his horse and by the strength of his lance, which, like that of
goliath the philistine, might vie with a weaver’s beam.”

as he turned to receive rebecca’s answer, he observed, that during his
chattering with gurth, she had left the apartment unperceived.

necromancers and cabalists. nevertheless, after a moment’s pause, he
obeyed the beckoning summons of the apparition, and followed her into
the apartment which she indicated, where he found to his joyful surprise
that his fair guide was the beautiful jewess whom he had seen at the
tournament, and a short time in her father’s apartment.

she asked him the particulars of his transaction with isaac, which he
detailed accurately.

“my father did but jest with thee, good fellow,” said rebecca; “he owes
thy master deeper kindness than these arms and steed could pay, were
their value tenfold. what sum didst thou pay my father even now?”

“eighty zecchins,” said gurth, surprised at the question.

“in this purse,” said rebecca, “thou wilt find a hundred. restore to
thy master that which is his due, and enrich thyself with the remainder.

 my master’s,” answered gurth, “of which,
assuredly, i would not have spoken a word, had you been satisfied with
working your will upon mine own property.”

“thou art an honest fellow,” replied the robber, “i warrant thee; and we
worship not st nicholas so devoutly but what thy thirty zecchins may yet
escape, if thou deal uprightly with us. meantime render up thy trust
for a time.” so saying, he took from gurth’s breast the large leathern
pouch, in which the purse given him by rebecca was enclosed, as well as
the rest of the zecchins, and then continued his interrogation.--“who is
thy master?”

“the disinherited knight,” said gurth.

“whose good lance,” replied the robber, “won the prize in to-day’s
tourney? what is his name and lineage?”

“it is his pleasure,” answered gurth, “that they be concealed; and from
me, assuredly, you will learn nought of them.”

“what is thine own name and lineage?”

“to tell that,” said gurth, “might reveal my

ge.”

“good night to you, kind sirs,” said gurth; “i shall remember your
orders, and trust that there is no offence in wishing you a safer and an
honester trade.”

thus they parted, the outlaws returning in the direction from whence
they had come, and gurth proceeding to the tent of his master, to whom,
notwithstanding the injunction he had received, he communicated the
whole adventures of the evening.

the disinherited knight was filled with astonishment, no less at the
generosity of rebecca, by which, however, he resolved he would not
profit, than that of the robbers, to whose profession such a quality
seemed totally foreign. his course of reflections upon these singular
circumstances was, however, interrupted by the necessity for taking
repose, which the fatigue of the preceding day, and the propriety
of refreshing himself for the morrow’s encounter, rendered alike
indispensable.

the knight, therefore, stretched himself for repose upon a rich couch

not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. “we shall
do better,” said he, “to leave them two of our attendants and two horses
to convey them back to the next village. it will diminish our strength
but little; and with your good sword, noble athelstane, and the aid of
those who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those
runagates.”

rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so
near them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. but rebecca
suddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the
attendants to the palfrey of the saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the
oriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of rowena’s
garment. then rising, and throwing back her veil, she implored her
in the great name of the god whom they both worshipped, and by that
revelation of the law upon mount sinai, in which they both believed,
that she would have compassion upon them, and suffer them to go forward
under the

ir safeguard. “it is not for myself that i pray this favour,”
 said rebecca; “nor is it even for that poor old man. i know that to
wrong and to spoil our nation is a light fault, if not a merit, with the
christians; and what is it to us whether it be done in the city, in the
desert, or in the field? but it is in the name of one dear to many,
and dear even to you, that i beseech you to let this sick person be
transported with care and tenderness under your protection. for, if evil
chance him, the last moment of your life would be embittered with regret
for denying tha

the noble and solemn air with which rebecca made this appeal, gave it
double weight with the fair saxon.

“the man is old and feeble,” she said to her guardian, “the maiden young
and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life--jews though
they be, we cannot as christians leave them in this extremity. let them
unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the
serfs. the mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for
the old man and his daughter.”

cedric readily assented to what she prop

“that they should travel in the rear of the whole party,
where wamba,” he said, “might attend them with his shield of boar’s
brawn.”

“i have left my shield in the tilt-yard,” answered the jester, “as has
been the fate of many a better knight than myself.”

athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the
last day of the tournament; while rowena, who was pleased in the same
proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her unfeeling
suitor, requested rebecca to ride by her side.

“it were not fit i should do so,” answered rebecca, with proud humility,
“where my society might be held a disgrace to my protectress.”

by this time the change of baggage was hastily achieved; for the single
word “outlaws” rendered every one sufficiently alert, and the approach
of twilight made the sound yet more impressive. amid the bustle, gurth
was taken from horseback, in the course of which removal he prevailed
upon the jester to slack the cord with which

large room, which, rising on clumsy saxon pillars, resembled those
refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most
ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.

the lady rowena was next separated from her train, and conducted, with
courtesy, indeed, but still without consulting her inclination, to
a distant apartment. the same alarming distinction was conferred on
rebecca, in spite of her father’s entreaties, who offered even money,
in this extremity of distress, that she might be permitted to abide with
him. “base unbeliever,” answered one of his guards, “when thou hast seen
thy lair, thou wilt not wish thy daughter to partake it.” and, without
farther discussion, the old jew was forcibly dragged off in a different

“i care not what he did,” said front-de-boeuf; “the question is, when

“let my daughter rebecca go forth to york,” answered isaac, “with your
safe conduct, noble knight, and so soon as man and horse can return, the

seconds,--“the treasure shall be told down on this very floor.”

such and so licentious were the times, as announced by the public

while the scenes we have described were passing in other parts of the
castle, the jewess rebecca awaited her fate in a distant and sequestered
turret. hither she had been led by two of her disguised ravishers, and
on being thrust into the little cell, she found herself in the presence
of an old sibyl, who kept murmuring to herself a saxon rhyme, as if to
beat time to the revolving dance which her spindle was performing upon
the floor. the hag raised her head as rebecca entered, and scowled at
the fair jewess with the malignant envy with which old age and ugliness,

“answer it to our lord, then, old housefiend,” said the man, and
retired; leaving rebecca in company with the old woman, upon whose
presence she had been thus unwillingly forced.

“what devil’s deed have they now in the wind?” said the old hag,
murmuring to herself, yet from time to time casting a sidelong and
malignant glance at rebecca; “but it is easy to guess--bright eyes,
black locks, and a skin like paper, ere the priest stains it with his

“thou needst say no more,” replied urfried “men know a fox by the train,
and a jewess by her tongue.”

“for the sake of mercy,” said rebecca, “tell me what i am to expect as
the conclusion of the violence which hath dragged me hither! is it
my life they seek, to atone for my religion? i will lay it down
cheerfully.”

“is there no help?--are there no means of escape?” said
rebecca--“richly, richly would i requite thine aid.”

“think not of it,” said the hag; “from hence there is no escape but
through the gates of death; and it is late, late,” she added, shaking
her grey head, “ere these open to us--yet it is comfort to think that we

“stay! stay! for heaven’s sake!” said rebecca; “stay, though it be to

“the presence of the mother of god were no protection,” answered the old
woman. “there she stands,” pointing to a rude image of the virgin mary,
“see if she can avert the fate that awaits thee.”

she left the room as she spoke, her features writhed into a sort of
sneering laugh, which made them seem even more hideous than their
habitual frown. she locked the door behind her, and rebecca might

her curse every step for its steepness, as slowly and with difficulty
she descended the turret-stair.

rebecca was now to expect a fate even more dreadful than that of rowena;
for what probability was there that either softness or ceremony would be
used towards one of her oppressed race, whatever shadow of these might
be preserved towards a saxon heiress? yet had the jewess this advantage,
that she was better prepared by habits of thought, and by natural
strength of mind, to encounter the dangers to which she was exposed. of
a strong and observing character, even from her earliest years, the pomp

alth which her father displayed within his walls, or which she
witnessed in the houses of other wealthy hebrews, had not been able to
blind her to the precarious circumstances under which they were enjoyed.
like damocles at his celebrated banquet, rebecca perpetually beheld,
amid that gorgeous display, the sword which was suspended over the heads
of her people by a single hair. these reflections had tamed and brought
down to a pitch of sounder judgment a temper, which, under other
circumstances, might have waxed haughty, supercilious, and obstinate.

from her father’s example and injunctions, rebecca had learnt to bear
herself courteously towards all who approached her. she could not indeed
imitate his excess of subservience, because she was a

tuation required
all her presence of mind, and she summoned it up accordingly.

her first care was to inspect the apartment; but it afforded few hopes
either of escape or protection. it contained neither secret passage nor
trap-door, and unless where the door by which she had entered joined the
main building, seemed to be circumscribed by the round exterior wall of
the turret. the door had no inside bolt or bar. the single window opened
upon an embattled space surmounting the turret, which gave rebecca,
at first sight, some hopes of escaping; but she soon found it had no
communication with any other part of the battlements, being an isolated
bartisan, or balcony, secured, as usual, by a parapet, with embrasures,
at which a few archers might be stationed for defending the turret, and
flanking with their shot the wall of the castle on that side.

there was therefore no hope but in passive fortitude, and in that strong
reliance on heaven natural to great and generous characters. rebecca,
however

 erroneously taught to interpret the promises of scripture to
the chosen people of heaven, did not err in supposing the present to be
their hour of trial, or in trusting that the children of zion would be
one day called in with the fulness of the gentiles. in the meanwhile,
all around her showed that their present state was that of punishment
and probation, and that it was their especial duty to suffer without
sinning. thus prepared to consider herself as the victim of misfortune,
rebecca had early reflected upon her own state, and schooled her mind to
meet the dangers which she had probably to encounter.

the prisoner trembled, however, and changed colour, when a step was
heard on the stair, and the door of the turret-chamber slowly opened,
and a tall man, dressed as one of those banditti to whom they owed
their misfortune, slowly entered, and shut the door behind him; his cap,
pulled down upon his brows, concealed the upper part of his face, and he

he was himself ashamed, he stood before the affrighted prisoner; yet,
ruffian as his dress bespoke him, he seemed at a loss to express what
purpose had brought him thither, so that rebecca, making an effort
upon herself, had time to anticipate his explanation. she had already
unclasped two costly bracelets and a collar, which she hastened to
proffer to the supposed outlaw, concluding naturally that to gratify his
avarice was to bespeak his favour.

“take these,” she said, “good friend, and for god’s sake be merciful
to me and my aged father! these ornaments are of value, yet are they
trifling to what he would bestow to obtain our dismissal from this
castle, free and uninj

ured.”

“fair flower of palestine,” replied the outlaw, “these pearls are
orient, but they yield in whiteness to your teeth; the diamonds are
brilliant, but they cannot match your eyes; and ever since i have taken
up this wild trade, i have made a vow to prefer beauty to wealth.”

“do not do yourself such wrong,” said rebecca; “take ransom, and have
mercy!--gold will purchase you pleasure,--to misuse us, could only bring
thee remorse. my father will willingly satiate thy utmost wishes; and
if thou wilt act wisely, thou mayst purchase with our spoils thy
restoration to civil society--mayst obtain pardon for past errors, and
be placed beyond the necessity of committing more.”

“it is well spoken,” replied the outlaw in french, finding it difficult
probably to sustain, in saxon, a conversation which rebecca had

 opened
in that language; “but know, bright lily of the vale of baca! that thy
father is already in the hands of a powerful alchemist, who knows how to
convert into gold and silver even the rusty bars of a dungeon grate. the
venerable isaac is subjected to an alembic, which will distil from
him all he holds dear, without any assistance from my requests or thy
entreaty. the ransom must be paid by love and beauty, and in no other
coin will i accept it.”

“thou art no outlaw,” said rebecca, in the same language in which he
addressed her; “no outlaw had refused such offers. no outlaw in this
land uses the dialect in which thou hast spoken. thou art no outlaw, but
a norman--a norman, noble perhaps in birth--o, be so in thy actions, and
cast off this fearful mask of outrage and violence!”

“and thou, who canst guess so truly,” said brian de bois-guilbert,
dropping the mantle from his face, “art no true daughter of israel,
but in all, save youth and beauty, a very witch of

outlaw, then, fair rose of sharon. and i am one who will be more prompt
to hang thy neck and arms with pearls and diamonds, which so well become
them, than to deprive thee of these ornaments.”

“what wouldst thou have of me,” said rebecca, “if not my wealth?--we
can have nought in common between us--you are a christian--i am a
jewess.--our union were contrary to the laws, alike of the church and
the synagogue.”

“it were so, indeed,” replied the templar, laughing; “wed with a jewess?
‘despardieux!’--not if she were the queen of sheba! and know, besides,
sweet daughter of zion, that were the most christian king to offer me
his most christian daughter, with languedoc for a dowery, i could not
wed her. it is against m

y vow to love any maiden, otherwise than ‘par

holy order.”

“darest thou appeal to it,” said rebecca, “on an occasion like the
present?”

“and if i do so,” said the templar, “it concerns not thee, who art no
believer in the blessed sign of our salvation.”

“i believe as my fathers taught,” said rebecca; “and may god forgive my
belief if erroneous! but you, sir knight, what is yours, when you appeal
without scruple to that which you deem most holy, even while you are
about to transgress the most solemn of your vows as a knight, and as a
man of religion?”

“it is gravely and well preached, o daughter of sirach!” answered the
templar; “but, gentle ecclesiastics, thy narrow jewish prejudices make
thee blind to our high privilege. marriage were an enduring crime on
the part of a templar;

wider privileges than we poor soldiers of the
temple of zion have won by our zeal in its defence. the protectors of
solomon’s temple may claim license by the example of solomon.”

“if thou readest the scripture,” said the jewess, “and the lives of the
saints, only to justify thine own license and profligacy, thy crime
is like that of him who extracts poison from the most healthful and
necessary herbs.”

the eyes of the templar flashed fire at this reproof--“hearken,” he
said, “rebecca; i have hitherto spoken mildly to thee, but now my
language shall be that of a conqueror. thou art the captive of my bow
and spear--subject to my will by the laws of all nations; nor will i
abate an inch of my right, or abstain from taking by violence what thou
refusest to entreaty or necessity.”

truth of what she spoke, and that the rules of his order condemned in
the most positive manner, and under high penalties, such intrigues as
he now prosecuted, and that, in some instances, even degradation had
followed upon it--“thou art sharp-witted,” he said; “but loud must be
thy voice of complaint, if it is heard beyond the iron walls of this
castle; within these, murmurs, laments, appeals to justice, and screams
for help, die alike silent away. one thing only can save thee, rebecca.

such state, that many a norman lady shall yield as well in pomp as in
beauty to the favourite of the best lance among the defenders of the
temple.”

“submit to my fate!” said rebecca--“and, sacred heaven! to what
fate?--embrace thy religion! and what religion can it be that
harbours such a villain?--thou the best lance of the templars!--craven
knight!--forsworn priest! i spit at thee, and i defy thee.--the god of

as she spoke this, she clasped her hands and extended them towards
heaven, as if imploring mercy on her soul before she made the final
plunge. the templar hesitated, and a resolution which had never yielded
to pity or distress, gave way to his admiration of her fortitude. “come
down,” he said, “rash girl!--i swear by earth, and sea, and sky, i will
offer thee no offence.”

“i will not trust thee, templar,” said rebecca; “thou hast taught me
better how to estimate the virtues of thine order. the next preceptory
would grant thee absolution for an oath, the keeping of which concerned
nought but the honour or the dishonour of a miserable jewish maiden.”

“you do me injustice,” exclaimed the templar fervently; “i swear to you
by the name which i bear--by the cross on my bosom--by the sword on my
side--by the ancient crest of my fathers do i swear, i will do thee
no injury whatsoever! if not for thyself,

yet for thy father’s sake
forbear! i will be his friend, and in this castle he will need a

“alas!” said rebecca, “i know it but too well--dare i trust thee?”

“may my arms be reversed, and my name dishonoured,” said brian de
bois-guilbert, “if thou shalt have reason to complain of me! many a law,
many a commandment have i broken, but my word never.”

“i will then trust thee,” said rebecca, “thus far;” and she descended
from the verge of the battlement, but remained standing close by one of
the embrasures, or “machicolles”, as they were then called.--“here,” she
said, “i take my stand. remain where thou art, and if thou shalt attempt
to diminish by one step the distance now between us, thou shalt see that
the jewish maiden will rather trust her soul with god, than her honour
to the templar!”

while rebecca spoke thus, her high and firm resolve, which corresponded

 dignity that seemed more than mortal. her
glance quailed not, her cheek blanched not, for the fear of a fate so
instant and so horrible; on the contrary, the thought that she had her
fate at her command, and could escape at will from infamy to death,
gave a yet deeper colour of carnation to her complexion, and a yet
more brilliant fire to her eye. bois-guilbert, proud himself and
high-spirited, thought he had never beheld beauty so animated and so
commanding.

“let there be peace between us, rebecca,” he said.

“peace, if thou wilt,” answered rebecca--“peace--but with this space
between.”

“thou needst no longer fear me,” said bois-guilbert.

“i fear thee not,” replied she; “thanks to him that reared this dizzy
tower so high, that nought could fall from it and live--thanks to him,
and to the god of israel!--i fear thee not.”

honours, purchased by toil and blood, i found her wedded to a gascon

of independence. the templar, a serf in all but the name, can possess
neither lands nor goods, and lives, moves, and breathes, but at the will
and pleasure of another.”

“alas!” said rebecca, “what advantages could compensate for such an
absolute sacrifice?”

“the power of vengeance, rebecca,” replied the templar, “and the
prospects of ambition.”

“an evil recompense,” said rebecca, “for the surrender of the rights
which are dearest to humanity.”

“say not so, maiden,” answered the templar; “revenge is a feast for the
gods! and if they have reserved it, as priests tell us, to themselves,
it is because they hold it an enjoyment too precious for the possessi

ambition may aim at. i have sought but a kindred spirit to share it, and

“sayest thou this to one of my people?” answered rebecca. “bethink

“answer me not,” said the templar, “by urging the difference of our
creeds; within our secret conclaves we hold these nursery tales in
derision. think not we long remained blind to the idiotical folly of our
founders, who forswore every delight of life for the pleasure of dying

he re-entered the turret-chamber, and descended the stair, leaving
rebecca scarcely more terrified at the prospect of the death to which
she had been so lately exposed, than at the furious ambition of the bold
bad man in whose power she found herself so unhappily placed. when she
entered the turret-chamber, her first duty was to return thanks to
the god of jacob for the protection which he had afforded her, and to
implore its continuance for her and for her father. another name glided
into her petition--it was that of the wounded christian, whom fate had
placed in the

 hands of bloodthirsty men, his avowed enemies. her heart
indeed checked her, as if, even in communing with the deity in prayer,
she mingled in her devotions the recollection of one with whose fate
hers could have no alliance--a nazarene, and an enemy to her faith. but
the petition was already breathed, nor could all the narrow prejudices
of her sect induce rebecca to wish it recalled.

when the templar reached the hall of the castle, he found de bracy

later and more reluctantly, and therefore i presume your interview has
proved more agreeable than mine.”

“come this way, father,” said the old hag, “thou art a stranger in this

speak with thee.--and you, daughter of an accursed race, go to the sick
man’s chamber, and tend him until my return; and woe betide you if you
again quit it without my permission!”

rebecca retreated. her importunities had prevailed upon urfried to
suffer her to quit the turret, and urfried had employed her services
where she herself would most gladly have paid them, by the bedside of
the wounded ivanhoe. with an understanding awake to their dangerous
situation, and prompt to avail herself of each means of safety which
occurred, rebecca had hoped something from the presence of a man of
religion, who, she learned from urfried, had penetrated into this
godless castle. she watched th

when urfried had with clamours and menaces driven rebecca back to the
apartment from which she had sallied, she proceeded to conduct the
unwilling cedric into a small apartment, the door of which she heedfully
secured. then fetching from a cupboard a stoup of wine and two flagons,
she placed them on the table, and said in a tone rather asserting a
fact than asking a question, “thou art saxon, father--deny it not,” she
continued, observing that cedric hastened not to reply; “the sounds of

our history must needs retrograde for the space of a few pages, to
inform the reader of certain passages material to his understanding the
rest of this important narrative. his own intelligence may indeed have
easily anticipated that, when ivanhoe sunk down, and seemed abandoned by
all the world, it was the importunity of rebecca which prevailed on her
father to have the gallant young warrior transported from the lists to
the house which for the time the jews inhabited in the suburbs of ashby.

it would not have been difficult to have persuaded isaac to this step in
any other circumstances, for his disposition was kind and grateful. but
he had also the prejudices and scrupulous timidity of his persecuted
people, and those were to be conquered.

“holy abraham!” he exclaimed, “he is a good youth, and my heart bleeds

to see the gore trickle down his rich embroidered hacqueton, and his
corslet of goodly price--but to carry him to our house!--damsel, hast
thou well considered?--he is a christian, and by our law we may not deal
with the stranger and gentile, save for the advantage of our commerce.”

“speak not so, my dear father,” replied rebecca; “we may not indeed mix
with them in banquet and in jollity; but in wounds and in misery, the
gentile becometh the jew’s brother.”

“i would i knew what the rabbi jacob ben tudela would opine on it,”
 replied isaac;--“nevertheless, the good youth must not bleed to death.
let seth and reuben bear him to ashby.”

“nay, let them place him in my litter,” said rebecca; “i will mount one
of the palfreys.”

“that were to expose thee to the gaze of those dogs of ishmael and of
e

dom,” whispered isaac, with a suspicious glance towards the crowd of
knights and squires. but rebecca was already busied in carrying her
charitable purpose into effect, and listed not what he said, until
isaac, seizing the sleeve of her mantle, again exclaimed, in a hurried
voice--“beard of aaron!--what if the youth perish!--if he die in our
custody, shall we not be held guilty of his blood, and be torn to pieces
by the multitude?”

“he will not die, my father,” said rebecca, gently extricating herself
from the grasp of isaac “he will not die unless we abandon him; and if
so, we are indeed answerable for his blood to god and to man.”

“nay,” said isaac, releasing his hold, “it grieveth me as much to see
the drops of his blood, as if they were so many golden byzants from mine
own purse; and i well know, that the lessons of miriam, daughter of the
rabbi manasses of byzantium whose soul is in paradise, have made thee
skilful in the art of healing, and that t

eople of my fathers.”

the apprehensions of isaac, however, were not ill founded; and the
generous and grateful benevolence of his daughter exposed her, on her
return to ashby, to the unhallowed gaze of brian de bois-guilbert. the
templar twice passed and repassed them on the road, fixing his bold
and ardent look on the beautiful jewess; and we have already seen the
consequences of the admiration which her charms excited when accident
threw her into the power of that unprincipled voluptuary.

rebecca lost no time in causing the patient to be transported to their
temporary dwelling, and proceeded with her own hands to examine and
to bind up his wounds. the youngest reader of romances and romantic
ballads, must recollect how often the females, during the dark ages, as
they are called, were initiated into the mysteries of surgery, and how
frequently the gallant knight submitted the wounds of his person to her
cure, whose eyes had yet more deeply penetrated his heart.

but the jews, both male a
 
 ___________________________
 
 contempt with which that malevolence was mingled. a jewish magician
might be the subject of equal abhorrence with a jewish usurer, but he
could not be equally despised. it is besides probable, considering the
wonderful cures they are said to have performed, that the jews possessed
some secrets of the healing art peculiar to themselves, and which, with
the exclusive spirit arising out of their condition, they took great
care to conceal from the christians amongst whom they dwelt.

the beautiful rebecca had been heedfully brought up in all the knowledge
proper to her nation, which her apt and powerful mind had retained,
arranged, and enlarged, in the course of a progress beyond her years,
her sex, and even the age in which she lived. her knowledge of medicine
and of the healing art had been acquired under an aged jewess, the
daughter of one of their most celebrated doctors, who loved rebecca as
her own child, and was believed to have communicated to her secrets,
which had been left to herself 
 
 ___________________________
 
by her sage father at the same time, and
under the same circumstances. the fate of miriam had indeed been to fall
a sacrifice to the fanaticism of the times; but her secrets had survived
in her apt pupil.

rebecca, thus endowed with knowledge as with beauty, was universally
revered and admired by her own tribe, who almost regarded her as one of
those gifted women mentioned in the sacred history. her father himself,
out of reverence for her talents, which involuntarily mingled itself
with his unbounded affection, permitted the maiden a greater liberty
than was usually indulged to those of her sex by the habits of her
people, and was, as we have just seen, frequently guided by her opinion,
even in preferen

ce to his own.

when ivanhoe reached the habitation of isaac, he was still in a state
of unconsciousness, owing to the profuse loss of blood which had taken
place during his exertions in the lists. rebecca examined the wound,
and having applied to it such vulnerary remedies as her art prescribed,
informed her father that if fever could be averted, of which the great
bleeding rendered her little apprehensive, and if the healing balsam of
miriam retained its virtue, there was nothing to fear for his guest’s
life, and that he might with safety travel to york with them on the
ensuing day. isaac looked a little blank at this annunciation. his
charity would willingly have stopped short at ashby, or a

t most would
have left the wounded christian to be tended in the house where he
was residing at present, with an assurance to the hebrew to whom it
belonged, that all expenses should be duly discharged. to this, however,
rebecca opposed many reasons, of which we shall only mention two that
had peculiar weight with isaac. the one was, that she would on no
account put the phial of precious balsam into the hands of another
physician even of her own tribe, lest that valuable mystery should be
discovered; the other, that this wounded knight, wilfred of ivanhoe, was
an intimate favourite of richard coeur-de-lion, and that, in case the
monarch should return, isaac, who had supplied his brother john with
treasure to prosecute 
 
 ___________________________
 
his rebellious purposes, would stand in no small
need of a powerful protector who enjoyed richard’s favour.

“thou art speaking but sooth, rebecca,” said isaac, giving way to these
weighty arguments--“it were an offending of heaven to betray the secrets
of the blessed miriam; for the good which heaven giveth, is not rashly
to be squandered upon others, whether it be talents of gold and
shekels of silver, or whether it be the secret mysteries of a wise
physician--assuredly they should be preserved to those to whom
providence hath vouchsafed them. and him whom the nazarenes of england

and the wound doing well. she performed her task with a graceful and
dignified simplicity and modesty, which might, even in more civilized
days, have served to redeem it from whatever might seem repugnant to
female delicacy. the idea of so young and beautiful a person engaged in
attendance on a sick-bed, or in dressing the wound of one of a different
sex, was melted away and lost in that of a beneficent being contributing
her effectual aid to relieve pain, and to avert the stroke of death.
rebecca’s few and brief directions were given in the hebrew language
to the old domestic; and he, who had been frequently her assistant in
similar cases, obeyed them without reply.

the accents of an unknown tongue, however harsh they might have sounded
when uttered by another, had, coming from the beautiful rebecca,
the romantic and pleasing effect which fancy ascribes to the charms
pronounced by some beneficent fairy, unintelligible, indeed, to the ear,
but, from the sweetness of utterance, and ben

stood by the
turban’d and caftan’d damsel who stood before him--“i pray you, gentle
maiden, of your courtesy---”

but here he was interrupted by his fair physician, a smile which she
could scarce suppress dimpling for an instant a face, whose general
expression was that of contemplative melancholy. “i am of england, sir
knight, and speak the english tongue, although my dress and my lineage
belong to another climate.”

“noble damsel,”--again the knight of ivanhoe began; and again rebecca
hastened to interrupt him.

“bestow not on me, sir knight,” she said, “the epithet of noble. it is
well you should speedily know that your handmaiden is a poor jewess, the
daughter of that isaac of york, to whom you were so lately a good and
kind lord. it well becomes him, and those of his household, to render to
you such careful tendance as your present state necessarily demands.”

i know not whether the fair rowena would have been altogether satisfied
with the species of emotion with

which her devoted knight had hitherto
gazed on the beautiful features, and fair form, and lustrous eyes, of
the lovely rebecca; eyes whose brilliancy was shaded, and, as it were,
mellowed, by the fringe of her long silken eyelashes, and which a
minstrel would have compared to the evening star darting its rays
through a bower of jessamine. but ivanhoe was too good a catholic to
retain the same class of feelings towards a jewess. this rebecca had
foreseen, and for this very purpose she had hastened to mention her
father’s name and lineage; yet--for the fair and wise daughter of isaac
was not without a touch of female weakness--she could not but sigh
internally when the glance of respectful admiration, not altogether
unmixed with tenderness, with which ivanhoe had hitherto regarded his
unknown benefactress, was exchanged at once for a manner cold, composed,
and collected, and fraught with no deeper feeling than that which
expressed
 
 ___________________________
 
 a grateful sense of courtesy received from an unexpected
quarter, and from one of an inferior race. it was not that ivanhoe’s
former carriage expressed more than that general devotional homage which
youth always pays to beauty; yet it was mortifying that one word should
operate as a spell to remove poor rebecca, who could not be supposed
altogether ignorant of her title to such homage, into a degraded class,
to whom it could not be honourably rendered.

but the gentleness and candour of rebecca’s nature imputed no fault to
ivanhoe for sharing in the universal prejudices of his age and religion.
on the contrary the fair jewess, though sensible her patient now
regarded her as one of a race of reprobation, with whom it was
disgraceful to hold any beyond the most necessary intercourse, ceased
not to pay the same patient and devoted attention to his safety and
convalescence. she informed him of the necessity they were under of
removing to york, and of her father’s resolution to transpo

received?--or could he not be transported as far as burton, where he was
sure to find hospitality with waltheoff, the abbot of st withold’s, to
whom he was related?”

“any, the worst of these harbourages,” said rebecca, with a melancholy
smile, “would unquestionably be more fitting for your residence than the
abode of a despised jew; yet, sir knight, unless you would dismiss your
physician, you cannot change your lodging. our nation, as you well know,
can cure wounds, though we deal not in inflicting them; and in our own
family, in particular, are secrets which have been handed down since
the days of solomon, and of which you have already experienced the
advantages. no nazarene--i crave your forgiveness, si

“and how soon wilt thou enable me to brook it?” said ivanhoe,
impatiently.

“within eight days, if thou wilt be patient and conformable to my
directions,” replied rebecca.

“by our blessed lady,” said wilfred, “if it be not a sin to name her
here, it is no time for me or any true knight to be bedridden; and if
thou accomplish thy promise, maiden, i will pay thee with my casque full
of crowns, come by them as i may.”

“i will accomplish my promise,” said rebecca, “and thou shalt bear thine
armour on the eighth day from hence, if thou will grant me but one boon
in the stead of the silver thou dost promise me.”

“if it be within my power, and such

 as a true christian knight may yield
to one of thy people,” replied ivanhoe, “i will grant thy boon blithely
and thankfully.”

“nay,” answered rebecca, “i will but pray of thee to believe
henceforward that a jew may do good service to a christian, without
desiring other guerdon than the blessing of the great father who made
both jew and gentile.”

“it were sin to doubt it, maiden,” replied ivanhoe; “and i repose myself

s household?--what of the lovely lady--” he stopt, as if unwilling
to speak rowena’s name in the house of a jew--“of her, i mean, who was
named queen of the tournament?”

“and who was selected by you, sir knight, to hold that dignity, with
judgment which was admired as much as your valour,” replied rebecca.

the blood which ivanhoe had lost did not prevent a flush from crossing
his cheek, feeling that he had incautiously betrayed a deep interest in
rowena by the awkward attempt he had made to conceal it.

“it was less of her i would speak,” said he, “than of prince john; and i
would fain know somewhat of a faithful squire, and why he now attends me
not?”

“let me use my authority as a leech,” answered rebecca, “and enjoin you
to keep silence, and avoid agitating reflections, whilst

churchmen of his party, after collecting such sums as they could wring,
by fair means or foul, from those who are esteemed the wealthy of the
land. it is said he designs to assume his brother’s crown.”

“not without a blow struck in its defence,” said ivanhoe, raising
himself upon the couch, “if there were but one true subject in england i
will fight for richard’s title with the best of them--ay, one or two, in
his just quarrel!”

“but that you may be able to do so,” said rebecca touching his shoulder
with her hand, “you must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.”

“true, maiden,” said ivanhoe, “as quiet as these disquieted times will
permit--and of cedric and his household?”

“his steward came but brief while since,” said the jewess, “panting with
haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth
of cedric’s flocks, and from him i learned that cedric and athelstane
of coningsburgh had left prince john’s lodging in hig

were about to set forth on their return homeward.”

“went any lady with them to the banquet?” said wilfred.

“the lady rowena,” said rebecca, answering the question with more
precision than it had been asked--“the lady rowena went not to the
prince’s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her
journey back to rotherwood, with her guardian cedric. and touching your
faithful squire gurth---”

“ha!” exclaimed the knight, “knowest thou his name?--but thou dost,” he
immediately added, “and well thou mayst, for it was from thy hand, and,
as i am now convinced, from thine own generosity of spirit, that he

eceived but yesterday a hundred zecchins.”

“speak not of that,” said rebecca, blushing deeply; “i see how easy it
is for the tongue to betray what the heart would gladly conceal.”

“but this sum of gold,” said ivanhoe, gravely, “my honour is concerned
in repaying it to your father.”

“let it be as thou wilt,” said rebecca, “when eight days have passed
away; but think not, and speak not now, of aught that may retard thy
recovery.”

“be it so, kind maiden,” said ivanhoe; “i were most ungrateful to
dispute thy commands. but one word of the fate of poor gurth, and i have
done with questioning thee.”

“i grieve to tell thee, sir knight,” answered the jewess, “that he is in
custody by the order of cedric.”--and then observing the distress which
her communication gave to wilfred, she instantly added

istinguished, thou seest
that the brother most indebted to him is raising his arms to grasp his
crown;--my regard hath brought restraint and trouble on the fairest of
her sex;--and now my father in his mood may slay this poor bondsman
but for his love and loyal service to me!--thou seest, maiden, what an
ill-fated wretch thou dost labour to assist; be wise, and let me go, ere
the misfortunes which track my footsteps like slot-hounds, shall involve
thee also in their pursuit.”

“nay,” said rebecca, “thy weakness and thy grief, sir knight, make thee
miscalculate the purposes of heaven. thou hast been restored to thy
country when it most needed the assistance of a strong hand and a true
heart, and thou hast humbled the pride of thine enemies and those of thy
king, when their horn was most highly exalted, and for the evil which
thou hast sustained, seest thou not that heaven has raised thee a helper
and a physician, even among the most despised of the land?--therefore,
be of good courage,

 and trust that thou art preserved for some marvel
which thine arm shall work before this people. adieu--and having taken
the medicine which i shall send thee by the hand of reuben, compose
thyself again to rest, that thou mayest be the more able to endure the
journey on the succeeding day.”

ivanhoe was convinced by the reasoning, and obeyed the directions, of
rebecca. the drought which reuben administered was of a sedative
and narcotic quality, and secured the patient sound and undisturbed
slumbers. in the morning his kind physician found him entirely free from
feverish symptoms, and fit to undergo the fatigue of a journey.

he was deposited in the horse-litter which had brought him from the
lists, and every precaution taken for his travelling with ease. in one
circumstance only even the entreaties of rebecca were unable to secure
sufficient attention to th

the men, who, like most of their description, were fond of enterprise
and detested inaction, went joyfully to the scene of danger as they were
commanded, and thus the charge of ivanhoe was transferred to urfried,
or ulrica. but she, whose brain was burning with remembrance of injuries
and with hopes of vengeance, was readily induced to devolve upon rebecca
the care of her patient.

     --schiller’s maid of orleans

a moment of peril is often also a moment of open-hearted kindness and
affection. we are thrown off our guard by the general agitation of our
feelings, and betray the intensity of those, which, at more tranquil
periods, our prudence at least conceals, if it cannot altogether
suppress them. in finding herself once

 more by the side of ivanhoe,
rebecca was astonished at the keen sensation of pleasure which she
experienced, even at a time when all around them both was danger, if not
despair. as she felt his pulse, and enquired after his health, there was
a softness in her touch and in her accents implying a kinder interest
than she would herself have been pleased to have voluntarily expressed.
her voice faltered and her hand trembled, and it was only the cold
question of ivanhoe, “is it you, gentle maiden?” which recalled her to
herself, a

nd reminded her the sensations which she felt were not and
could not be mutual. a sigh escaped, but it was scarce audible; and the
questions which she asked the knight concerning his state of health were
put in the tone of calm friendship. ivanhoe answered her hastily that
he was, in point of health, as well, and better than he could have
expected--“thanks,” he said, “dear rebecca, to thy helpful skill.”

“he calls me dear rebecca,” said the maiden to herself, “but it is in
the cold and careless tone which ill suits the word. his war-horse--his
hunting hound, are dearer to him than the despised jewess!”

“my mind, gentle maiden,” continued ivanhoe, “is more disturbed by
anxiety, than my body with pain. from the speeches of those men who
were my warders just now, i learn that i am a prisoner, and, if i judge
aright of the loud hoarse voice which even now dispatched them hence
on some military duty, i am in the

 castle of front-de-boeuf--if so, how
will this end, or how can i protect rowena and my father?”

“he names not the jew or jewess,” said rebecca internally; “yet what is
our portion in him, and how justly am i punished by heaven for
letting my thoughts dwell upon him!” she hastened after this brief
self-accusation to give ivanhoe what information she could; but it
amounted only to this, that the templar bois-guilbert, and the
baron front-de-boeuf, were commanders within the castle; that it was
beleaguered from without, but by whom she knew not. she added, that
there was a christian priest within the castle who might be possessed of

more information.

“a christian priest!” said the knight, joyfully; “fetch him hither,
rebecca, if thou canst--say a sick man desires his ghostly counsel--say
what thou wilt, but bring him--something i must do or attempt, but how
can i determine until i know how matters stand without?”

rebecca in compliance with the wishes of ivanhoe, made that attempt to
bring cedric into the wounded knight’s chamber, which was defeated as we
have already seen by the interference of urfried, who had also been on
the watch to intercept the supposed monk. rebecca retired to communicate
to ivanhoe the result of her errand.

they had not much leisure to regret the failure of this source of
intelligence, or to contrive by what means it might be supplied; for the
noise within the castle, occasioned by t

aversed the
battlements or resounded on the narrow and winding passages and stairs
which led to the various bartisans and points of defence. the voices of
the knights were heard, animating their followers, or directing means
of defence, while their commands were often drowned in the clashing of
armour, or the clamorous shouts of those whom they addressed. tremendous
as these sounds were, and yet more terrible from the awful event which
they presaged, there was a sublimity mixed with them, which rebecca’s
high-toned mind could feel even in that moment of terror. her eye
kindled, although the blood fled from her cheeks; and there was a
strong mixture of fear, and of a thrilling sense of the sublime, as she
repeated, half whispering to herself, half speaking to her companion,
the sacred text,--“the quiver rattleth--the glittering spear and the
shield--the noise of the captains and the shouting!”

but ivanhoe was like the war-horse of that sublime passage, glowing with
impatience at his ina

ctivity, and with his ardent desire to mingle in
the affray of which these sounds were the introduction. “if i could
but drag myself,” he said, “to yonder window, that i might see how
this brave game is like to go--if i had but bow to shoot a shaft, or
battle-axe to strike were it but a single blow for our deliverance!--it
is in vain--it is in vain--i am alike nerveless and weaponless!”

“fret not thyself, noble knight,” answered rebecca, “the sounds have
ceased of a sudden--it may be they join not battle.”

“thou knowest nought of it,” said wilfred, impatiently; “this dead pause
only shows that the men are at their posts on the walls, and expecting
an instant attack; what we have heard was but the instant muttering of
the storm--it will burst anon in all its fury.--could i but reach yonder
window!”

“thou wilt but injure thyself by the attempt, noble knight,” replied his
attendant. observing his extreme solicit

ude, she firmly added, “i myself
will stand at the lattice, and describe to you as i can what passes
without.”

“you must not--you shall not!” exclaimed ivanhoe; “each lattice, each
aperture, will be soon a mark for the archers; some random shaft--”

“it shall be welcome!” murmured rebecca, as with firm pace she ascended
two or three steps, which led to the window of which they spoke.

“rebecca, dear rebecca!” exclaimed ivanhoe, “this is no maiden’s
pastime--do not expose thyself to wounds and death, and render me for
ever miserable for having given the occasion; at least, cover thyself
with yonder ancient buckler, and show as little of your person at the
lattice as may be.”

following with wonderful promptitude the directions of ivanhoe, and
availing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield, which
she placed against the lower part of the window, rebecca, with tolerable
securit

y to herself, could witness part of what was passing without the
castle, and report to ivanhoe the preparations which the assailants were
making for the storm. indeed the situation which she thus obtained was
peculiarly favourable for this purpose, because, being placed on an
angle of the main building, rebecca could not only see what passed
beyond the precincts of the castle, but also commanded a view of the
outwork likely to be the first object of the meditated assault. it was
an exterior fortification of no great height or strength, intended
to protect the postern-gate, through which cedric had been recently
dismissed by front-de-boeuf. the castle moat divided this species of
barbican from the rest of the fortress, so that, in case of its being
taken, it was easy to cut off the communication with t

he main building,
by withdrawing the temporary bridge. in the outwork was a sallyport
corresponding to the postern of the castle, and the whole was surrounded
by a strong palisade. rebecca could observe, from the number of men
placed for the defence of this post, that the besieged entertained
apprehensions for its safety; and from the mustering of the assailants
in a direction nearly opposite to the outwork, it seemed no less plain
that it had been selected as a vulnerable point of attack.

these appearances she hastily communicated to ivanhoe, and added, “the
skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are
advanced from its dark shadow.”

“under what ba
 
 ___________________________
 
nner?” asked ivanhoe.

“under no ensign of war which i can observe,” answered rebecca.

“a singular novelty,” muttered the knight, “to advance to storm such a
castle without pennon or banner displayed!--seest thou who they be that
act as leaders?”

“a knight, clad in sable armour, is the most conspicuous,” said the
jewess; “he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the
direction of all around him.”

“what device does he bear on his shield?” replied ivanhoe.

“something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue on the
black shield.

 [35]

“a fetterlock and shacklebolt azure,” said ivanhoe; “i know not who may
bear the device, but well i ween it might now be mine own. canst thou
not see the motto?”

“scarce the device itself at this distance,” replied rebecca; “but when
the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as i tell you.”

“seem there no other leaders?” exclaimed the anxious enquirer.

“none of mark and distinction that i can behold from this station,” said
rebecca; “but, doubtless, the other side of the castle is also assailed.
they appear even now preparing to advance--god of zion, protect
us!--what a dreadful sight!--those who advance first bear huge shields
and defences made of plank; the others follow, bending their bows
as they come on.--they raise their bows!--god of moses, forgive the
creatures thou hast made!”

her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault,
which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once

uts which arose when either side inflicted or sustained some notable
loss.

“and i must lie here like a bedridden monk,” exclaimed ivanhoe, “while
the game that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of
others!--look from the window once again, kind maiden, but beware that
you are not marked by the archers beneath--look out once more, and tell
me if they yet advance to the storm.”

with patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she had
employed in mental devotion, rebecca again took post at the lattice,
sheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible from beneath.

“what dost thou see, rebecca?” again demanded the wounded knight.

“nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle mine eyes,
and to hide the bowmen who shoot them.”

“that cannot endure,” said ivanhoe; “if they press not right on to
carry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail but little
against stone walls and bulwarks. look for the knight of the fet

terlock,
fair rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for as the leader is, so
will his followers be.”

“i see him not,” said rebecca.

“foul craven!” exclaimed ivanhoe; “does he blench from the helm when the
wind blows highest?”

“he blenches not! he blenches not!” said rebecca, “i see him now; he
leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the barbican. [36]
--they pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down the barriers
with axes.--his high black plume floats abroad over the throng, like
a raven over the field of the slain.--they have made a breach in the
barriers--they rush in--they are thrust back!--front-de-boeuf heads the
defenders; i see his gigantic form above the press. they throng again to
the breach, and the pass is disputed hand to hand, an

of jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce tides--the conflict of two
oceans moved by adverse winds!”

she turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure a
sight so terrible.

“look forth again, rebecca,” said ivanhoe, mistaking the cause of her
retiring; “the archery must in some degree have ceased, since they are
now fighting hand to hand.--look again, there is now less danger.”

rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed, “holy
prophets of the law! front-de-boeuf and the black knight fight hand
to hand on the breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the
progress of the strife--heaven strike with the cause of the oppressed
and of the captive!” she then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed, “he
is down!--he is down!”

“who is down?” cried ivanhoe; “for our dear lady’s sake, tell me which
has fallen?”

“the black knight,” answere

d rebecca, faintly; then instantly again
shouted with joyful eagerness--“but no--but no!--the name of the lord
of hosts be blessed!--he is on foot again, and fights as if there
were twenty men’s strength in his single arm--his sword is broken--he
snatches an axe from a yeoman--he presses front-de-boeuf with blow on
blow--the giant stoops and totters like an oak under the steel of the
woodman--he falls--he falls!”

“front-de-boeuf?” exclaimed ivanhoe.

“front-de-boeuf!” answered the jewess;

“his men rush to the rescue,
headed by the haughty templar--their united force compels the champion
to pause--they drag front-de-boeuf within the walls.”

“the assailants have won the barriers, have they not?” said ivanhoe.

“they have--they have!” exclaimed rebecca--“and they press the besieged
hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and
endeavour to ascend upon the shoulders of each other--down go stones,
beams, and trunks of trees upon their heads, and as fast as they
bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men supply their places in the
assault--great god! hast thou given men thine own image, that it should
be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their brethren!”

“think not of that,” said ivanhoe; “this is no time for
 
 ___________________________
 
 such
thoughts--who yield?--who push their way?”

“the ladders are thrown down,” replied rebecca, shuddering; “the
soldiers lie grovelling under them like crushed reptiles--the besieged
have the better.”

“saint george strike for us!” exclaimed the knight; “do the false yeomen
give way?”

“no!” exclaimed rebecca, “they bear themselves right yeomanly--the black
knight approaches the postern with his huge axe--the thundering blows
which he deals, you may hear them above all the din and shouts of
the battle--stones and beams are hailed down on the bold champion--he
regards them no more than if they were thistle-down or feathers!”

“by saint john of acre,” said ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his
couch, “methought there was but one man in england that might do such a
deed!”

“the postern

 gate shakes,” continued rebecca; “it crashes--it is
splintered by his blows--they rush in--the outwork is won--oh,
god!--they hurl the defenders from the battlements--they throw them
into the moat--o men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no
longer!”

“the bridge--the bridge which communicates with the castle--have they
won that pass?” exclaimed ivanhoe.

“no,” replied rebecca, “the templar has destroyed the plank on which
they crossed--few of the defenders escaped with him into the castle--the
shrieks and cries which you hear tell the fate of the others--alas!--i
see it is still more difficult to look upon victory than upon battle.”

“what do they now, maiden?” said ivanhoe; “look forth yet again--this is
no time to faint at bloodshed.”

“it is over for the time,” answered rebecca; “our friends strengthen
themselves within the outwork which they ha

terval to interval, as if rather to
disquiet than effectually to injure them.”

“our friends,” said wilfred, “will surely not abandon an enterprise so
gloriously begun and so happily attained.--o no! i will put my faith
in the good knight whose axe hath rent heart-of-oak and bars of
iron.--singular,” he again muttered to himself, “if there be two who can
do a deed of such derring-do! [37]--a fetterlock, and a shacklebolt on
a field sable--what may that mean?--seest thou nought else, rebecca, by
which the black knight may be distinguished?”

“nothing,” said the jewess; “all about him is black as the wing of the
night raven. nothing can i spy that can mark him further--but having
once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks i could know
him again among a thousand warriors. he rushes to the fray as if he were
summoned to a banquet. there is more than mere strength, there seems as
if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every
blow which he deals

upon his enemies. god assoilize him of the sin of
bloodshed!--it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and
heart of one man can triumph over hundreds.”

“rebecca,” said ivanhoe, “thou hast painted a hero; surely they rest
but to refresh their force, or to provide the means of crossing the
moat--under such a leader as thou hast spoken this knight to be, there
are no craven fears, no cold-blooded delays, no yielding up a gallant
emprize; since the difficulties which render it arduous render it also
glorious. i swear by the honour of my house--i vow by the name of my
bright lady-love, i would endure ten years’ captivity to fight one day
by that good

knight’s side in such a quarrel as this!”

“alas,” said rebecca, leaving her station at the window, and approaching
the couch of the wounded knight, “this impatient yearning after
action--this struggling with and repining at your present weakness,
will not fail to injure your returning health--how couldst thou hope
to inflict wounds on others, ere that be healed which thou thyself hast
received?”

“rebecca,” he replied, “thou knowest not how impossible it is for one
trained to actions of chivalry to remain passive as a priest, or a
woman, when they are acting deeds of honour around him. the love of
battle is the food upon which we live--the dust of the ‘melee’ is the
breath of our nostrils! we live not--we wish not to live--longer than
while we are victorious and renowned--such, maiden, are the laws of
chivalry to which we are sworn, and to which we offer all that we hold
dear.”

“ala

t knight, save an
offering of sacrifice to a demon of vain glory, and a passing through
the fire to moloch?--what remains to you as the prize of all the blood
you have spilled--of all the travail and pain you have endured--of
all the tears which your deeds have caused, when death hath broken the
strong man’s spear, and overtaken the speed of his war-horse?”

“what remains?” cried ivanhoe; “glory, maiden, glory! which gilds our
sepulchre and embalms our name.”

“glory?” continued rebecca; “alas, is the rusted mail which hangs as a
hatchment over the champion’s dim and mouldering tomb--is the defaced
sculpture of the inscription which the ignorant monk can hardly read to
the enquiring pilgrim--are these sufficient rewards for the sacrifice
of every kindly affection, for a life spent miserably that ye may
make others miserable? or is there such virtue in the rude rhymes of
a wandering bard, that domestic love, kindly affection, peace and
happiness, are so wildly bartered, to

s sing to drunken churls over their evening ale?”

“by the soul of hereward!” replied the knight impatiently, “thou
speakest, maiden, of thou knowest not what. thou wouldst quench the pure
light of chivalry, which alone distinguishes the noble from the base,
the gentle knight from the churl and the savage; which rates our life
far, far beneath the pitch of our honour; raises us victorious over
pain, toil, and suffering, and teaches us to fear no evil but disgrace.
thou art no christian, rebecca; and to thee are unknown those high
feelings which swell the bosom of a noble maiden when her lover hath
done some deed of emprize which sanctions his flame. chivalry!--why,
maiden, she is the nurse of pure and high affection--the stay of the
oppressed, the redresser of grievances, the curb of the power of the
tyrant--nobility were but an empty name without her, and liberty finds
the best protection in her lance and her sword.”

“i am, indeed,” said rebecca, “sprung from a race whose co

towards the court-yard. de bracy himself arose from the ground, and cast
a sorrowful glance after his conqueror. “he trusts me not!” he repeated;
“but have i deserved his trust?” he then lifted his sword from the
floor, took off his helmet in token of submission, and, going to the
barbican, gave up his sword to locksley, whom he met by the way.

as the fire augmented, symptoms of it became soon apparent in the
chamber, where ivanhoe was watched and tended by the jewess rebecca. he
had been awakened from his brief slumber by the noise of the battle; and
his attendant, who had, at his anxious desire, again placed herself at
the window to watch and report to him the fate of the attack, was
for some time prevented from observing either, by the increase of the
smouldering and stifling vapour. at length the volumes of smoke which
rolled into the apartment--the cries for water, which were heard even
above the din of the battle made them sensible of the progress of this
new

danger.

“the castle burns,” said rebecca; “it burns!--what can we do to save
ourselves?”

“fly, rebecca, and save thine own life,” said ivanhoe, “for no human aid
can avail me.”

“i will not fly,” answered rebecca; “we will be saved or perish
together--and yet, great god!--my father, my father--what will be his
fate!”

at this moment the door of the apartment flew open, and the templar
presented himself,--a ghastly figure, for his gilded armour was broken
and bloody, and the plume was partly shorn away, partly burnt from his
casque. “i have found thee,” said he to rebecca; “thou shalt prove i
will keep my word to share weal and woe with thee--there is but one
path to safety, i have cut my way t

hrough fifty dangers to point it to
thee--up, and instantly follow me!” [38]

“alone,” answered rebecca, “i will not follow thee. if thou wert born of
woman--if thou hast but a touch of human charity in thee--if thy heart
be not hard as thy breastplate--save my aged father--save this wounded
knight!”

“a knight,” answered the templar, with his characteristic calmness, “a
knight, rebecca, must encounter his fate, whether it meet him in the
shape of sword or flame--and who recks how or where a jew meets with
his?”

“savage warrior,” said rebecca, “rather will i perish in the flames than
accept safety from thee!”

“thou shalt not choose, rebecca--once didst thou foil me, but never
mortal did so twice.”

so saying, he seized on the terrified maiden, who filled the air with
her shrieks, and bore her out of the room in his arms in spite of her
cries, and without regard

thee!--villain, i will have thy heart’s blood!”

“i had not found thee, wilfred,” said the black knight, who at that
instant entered the apartment, “but for thy shouts.”

“if thou be’st true knight,” said wilfred, “think not of me--pursue yon
ravisher--save the lady rowena--look to the noble cedric!”

“in their turn,” answered he of the fetterlock, “but thine is first.”

and seizing upon ivanhoe, he bore him off with as much ease as the
templar had carried off rebecca, rushed with him to the postern, and
having there delivered his burden to the care of two yeomen, he again
entered the castle to assist in the rescue of the other prisoners.

one turret was now in bright flames, which flashed out furiously from
window and shot-hole. but in other parts, the great thickness of the
walls and the vaulted roofs of the apartments, resisted the progress
of the flames, and there the rage of man still triumphed, as the scarce
more dreadful element held mastery elsewhere

burnt
down. on the other hand, a party of the besiegers who had entered by
the postern were now issuing out into the court-yard, and attacking with
fury the remnant of the defenders who were thus assaulted on both sides
at once.

animated, however, by despair, and supported by the example of their
indomitable leader, the remaining soldiers of the castle fought with
the utmost valour; and, being well-armed, succeeded more than once in
driving back the assailants, though much inferior in numbers. rebecca,
placed on horseback before one of the templar’s saracen slaves, was in
the midst of the little party; and bois-guilbert, notwithstanding the
confusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety.
repeatedly he was by her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held
before her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon
starting from his position by her, he cried his war-cry, dashed forward,
struck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on the same

“the god of my fathers help me!” said the jew; “will ye bear to the

deprive me of the means of livelihood?”

“thou wilt have the less to provide for, jew, if thou art childless,”
 said aymer.

“was not thy daughter dark-haired?” said one of the outlaws; “and wore
she not a veil of twisted sendal, broidered with silver?”

“she did!--she did!” said the old man, trembling with eagerness, as
formerly with fear. “the blessing of jacob be upon thee! canst thou tell

not without some marks of contempt.

“nay, beshrew thee, man, up with thee! i am english born, and love no
such eastern prostrations--kneel to god, and not to a poor sinner, like
me.”

“ay, jew,” said prior aymer; “kneel to god, as represented in the
servant of his altar, and who knows, with thy sincere repentance and due
gifts to the shrine of saint robert, what grace thou mayst acquire for
thyself and thy daughter rebecca? i grieve for the maiden, for she is of
fair and comely countenance,--i beheld her in the lists of ashby. also
brian de bois-guilbert is one with whom i may do much--bethink thee how
thou mayst deserve my good word with him.”

“alas! alas!” said the jew, “on every hand the spoilers arise against
me--i am given as a prey unto the assyrian, and a prey unto him of
egypt.”

“and what else should be the lot of thy accursed race?” answered
the prior; “for what saith holy writ, ‘verb

 thou canst easily gratify his greed; for think not that i am
blinded by thy pretexts of poverty. i am intimately acquainted, isaac,
with the very iron chest in which thou dost keep thy money-bags--what!

the vaulted chamber under thy garden at york?” the jew grew as pale as
death--“but fear nothing from me,” continued the yeoman, “for we are
of old acquainted. dost thou not remember the sick yeoman whom thy fair
daughter rebecca redeemed from the gyves at york, and kept him in
thy house till his health was restored, when thou didst dismiss him
recovered, and with a piece of money?--usurer as thou art, thou didst
never place coin at better interest than that poor silver mark, for it
has this day saved thee five hundred crowns.”

“and thou art he whom we called diccon bend-the-bow?” said isaac; “i
thought ever i knew the accent of thy voice.”

“i am bend-the-bow,” said the captain, “and locksley, and have

“silent as a dormouse,” said the outlaw; “and never trust me but i am
grieved for thy daughter. but i may not help it--the templars lances are
too strong for my archery in the open field--they would scatter us like
dust. had i but known it was rebecca when she was borne off, something
might have been done; but now thou must needs proceed by policy. come,
shall i treat for thee with the prior?”

“in god’s name, diccon, an thou canst, aid me to recover the child of my
bosom!”

“do not thou interrupt me with thine ill-timed avarice,” said the
outlaw, “and i will deal with him in thy behalf.”

he then turned from the jew, who followed him, however, as closely as
his shadow.

“prior aymer,” said the captain, “come apart with

his people, rending his clothes, and saying, “ah, my daughter!--ah, my
daughter!--alas! for the beauty of zion!--alas! for the captivity of
israel!”

“thou seest,” said isaac, “how it stands with me, and that i may not
tarry. peradventure, the presence of this lucas beaumanoir, being the
chief man over them, may turn brian de bois-guilbert from the ill which
he doth meditate, and that he may deliver to me my beloved daughter
rebecca.”

“go thou,” said nathan ben israel, “and be wise, for wisdom availed
daniel in the den of lions into which he was cast; and may it go well
with thee, even as thine heart wisheth. yet, if thou canst, keep thee
from the presence of the grand master, for to do foul scorn to our
people is his morning and evening delight. it may be if thou couldst
speak with bois-guilbert in private, thou shalt the better prevail with
him; for men say that these accursed nazarenes are not of one mind in

whose cures the gentiles slandered as if they had been wrought by
necromancy.”

isaac accordingly bade his friend farewell, and about an hour’s riding
brought him before the preceptory of templestowe.

this establishment of the templars was seated amidst fair meadows and
pastures, which the devotion of the former preceptor had bestowed upon
their order. it was strong and well fortified, a point never neglected
by these knights, and which the disordered

conrade was better acquainted (perhaps by practice) with the jargon of
gallantry, than was his superior; and he expounded the passage which
embarrassed the grand master, to be a sort of language used by worldly
men towards those whom they loved ‘par amours’; but the explanation did
not satisfy the bigoted beaumanoir.

“there is more in it than thou dost guess, conrade; thy simplicity is
no match for this deep abyss of wickedness. this rebecca of york was a
pupil of that miriam of whom thou hast heard. thou shalt hear the jew
own it even now.” then turning to isaac, he said aloud, “thy daughter,
then, is prisoner with brian de bois-guilbert?”

“ay, reverend valorous sir,” stammered poor isaac, “and whatsoever
ransom a poor man may pay for her deliverance---”

“peace!” said the grand master. “this thy daughter hath practised the
art of healing, hath she not?”

house of religion the jewish captive, and, as was to be feared, the
paramour of a brother of the order; and when albert appeared before him,
he was regarded with unwonted sternness.

“there is in this mansion, dedicated to the purposes of the holy order
of the temple,” said the grand master, in a severe tone, “a jewish
woman, brought hither by a brother of religion, by your connivance, sir
preceptor.”

albert malvoisin was overwhelmed with confusion; for the unfortunate
rebecca had been confined in a remote and secret part of the building,
and every precaution used to prevent her residence there from being
known. he read in the looks of beaumanoir ruin to bois-guilbert and to
himself, unless he should be able to avert the impending storm.

“why are you mute?” continued the grand master.

“is it permitted to me to reply?” answered the preceptor, in a tone of
the deepest humility, although by the question he only meant to gain an
instant’s space for arranging

important prohibitions.”

“how comes it, then, i demand of thee once more, that thou hast suffered
a brother to bring a paramour, and that paramour a jewish sorceress,
into this holy place, to the stain and pollution thereof?”

“a jewish sorceress!” echoed albert malvoisin; “good angels guard us!”

“ay, brother, a jewish sorceress!” said the grand master, sternly. “i
have said it. darest thou deny that this rebecca, the daughter of that
wretched usurer isaac of york, and the pupil of the foul witch
miriam, is now--shame to be thought or spoken!--lodged within this thy
preceptory?”

“your wisdom, reverend father,” answered the preceptor, “hath rolled
away the darkness from my understanding. much did i wonder that so good
a knight as brian de bois-guilbert seemed so fondly besotted on the
charms of this female, whom i received into this house merely to place a

maintains she hath cast a spell over you.”

“lucas beaumanoir!”--said bois-guilbert reproachfully--“are these your
precautions, malvoisin? hast thou suffered the dotard to learn that
rebecca is in the preceptory?”

“how could i help it?” said the preceptor. “i neglected nothing that
could keep secret your mystery; but it is betrayed, and whether by the
devil or no, the devil only can tell. but i have turned the matter as i
could; you are safe if you renounce rebecca. you are pitied--the victim
of magical delusion. she is a sorceress, and must suffer as such.”

“she shall not, by heaven!” said bois-guilbert.

“by heaven, she must and will!” said malvoisin. “neith

future honours, all depend on thy place in the order. shouldst thou
adhere perversely to thy passion for this rebecca, thou wilt give
beaumanoir the power of expelling thee, and he will not neglect it. he
is jealous of the truncheon which he holds in his trembling gripe, and
he knows thou stretchest thy bold hand towards it. doubt not he will
ruin thee, if thou affordest him a pretext so fair as thy protection of
a jewish sorceress. give him his scope in this matter, for thou canst
not control him. when the staff is in thine own firm grasp, thou mayest

humour.”

“malvoisin,” said bois-guilbert, “thou art a cold-blooded--”

“friend,” said the preceptor, hastening to fill up the blank, in which
bois-guilbert would probably have placed a worse word,--“a cold-blooded
friend i am, and therefore more fit to give thee advice. i tell thee
once more, that thou canst not save rebecca. i tell thee once more,
thou canst but perish with her. go hie thee to the grand master--throw
thyself at his feet and tell him--”

“not at his feet, by heaven! but to the dotard’s very beard will i
say--”

“say to him, then, to his beard,” continued malvoisin, coolly, “that you
love this captive jewess to distraction; and the more thou dost enlarge
on thy passion, the greater will be his haste to end it by the death of
the fair enchantress; while thou, taken in flagrant delict by

of a crime contrary to thine oath, canst hope no aid of thy brethren,
and must exchange all thy brilliant visions of ambition and power, to
lift perhaps a mercenary spear in some of the petty quarrels between
flanders and burgundy.”

“thou speakest the truth, malvoisin,” said brian de bois-guilbert, after
a moment’s reflection. “i will give the hoary bigot no advantage over
me; and for rebecca, she hath not merited at my hand that i should
expose rank and honour for her sake. i will cast her off--yes, i will
leave her to her fate, unless--”

“qualify not thy wise and necessary resolution,” said malvoisin; “women
are but the toys which amuse our lighter hours--ambition is the serious
business of life. perish a thousand such frail baubles as this jewess,
before thy manly step pause in the brilliant career that lies stretched
before thee! for the present we part, nor must we be

seen to hold close
conversation--i must order the hall for his judgment-seat.”

“what!” said bois-guilbert, “so soon?”

“ay,” replied the preceptor, “trial moves rapidly on when the judge has
determined the sentence beforehand.”

“rebecca,” said bois-guilbert, when he was left alone, “thou art like
to cost me dear--why cannot i abandon thee to thy fate, as this calm
hypocrite recommends?--one effort will i make to save thee--but beware
of ingratitude! for if i am again repulsed, my vengeance shall equal my
love. the life and honour of bois-guilbert must not be hazarded, where
contempt and reproaches are his only reward.”

the preceptor had hardly given the necessary orders, when he was joined
by conrade mont-fitchet, who a

our brethren regard him--but all this will not avail him with our grand
master, should he consider brian as the accomplice, not the victim, of
this jewess. were the souls of the twelve tribes in her single body, it
were better she suffered alone, than that bois-guilbert were partner in
her destruction.”

“i have been working him even now to abandon her,” said malvoisin;
“but still, are there grounds enough to condemn this rebecca for
sorcery?--will not the grand master change his mind when he sees that
the proofs are so weak?”

“they must be strengthened, albert,” replied mont-fitchet, “they must be
strengthened. dost thou understand me?”

“i do,” said the preceptor, “nor do i scruple to do aught for
advancement of the order--but there is little time to find engines
fitting.”

“malvoisin, they must be found,” said conrade; “well will it advantage
both the order and thee. this templestowe is a poo

ay, seek them out instantly--and hark thee, if a byzant or two will
sharpen their memory, let them not be wanting.”

“they would swear the mother that bore them a sorceress for a zecchin,”
 said the preceptor.

“away, then,” said mont-fitchet; “at noon the affair will proceed. i
have not seen our senior in such earnest preparation since he condemned
to the stake hamet alfagi, a convert who relapsed to the moslem faith.”

the ponderous castle-bell had tolled the point of noon, when rebecca
heard a trampling of feet upon the private stair which led to her place
of confinement. the noise announced the arrival of several persons, and
the circumstance rather gave her joy; for she was more afraid of the
solitary visits of the fierce and passionate bois-guilbert than of
any evil that could befall her besides. the door of the chamber was
unlocked, and conrade and the preceptor malvoisin entered, attended by
four warders clothed in black, and bearing halberds.

“daughter of an accursed

 race!” said the preceptor, “arise and follow
us.”

“whither,” said rebecca, “and for what purpose?”

“damsel,” answered conrade, “it is not for thee to question, but to
obey. nevertheless, be it known to thee, that thou art to be brought
before the tribunal of the grand master of our holy order, there to
answer for thine offences.”

“may the god of abraham be praised!” said rebecca, folding her hands
devoutly; “the name of a judge, though an enemy to my people, is to me
as the name of a protector. most willingly do i follow thee--permit me
only to wrap my veil around my head.”

they descended the stair with slow and solemn step, traversed a long
gallery, and, by a pair of folding doors placed at the end, entered the
great hall in which the grand master had for the time established his
court of justice.

halberdiers, to move forward to the seat appointed for her. as she
passed through the crowd, her arms folded and her head depressed, a
scrap of paper was thrust into her hand, which she received almost
unconsciously, and continued to hold without examining its contents. the
assurance that she possessed some friend in this awful assembly gave

     stern was the law which bade its vot’ries leave

     --the middle ages

the tribunal, erected for the trial of the innocent and unhappy rebecca,
occupied the dais or elevated part of the upper end of the great hall--a
platform, which we have already described as the place of honour,
destined to be occupied by the most distinguished inhabitants or guests
of an ancient mansion.

on an elevated seat, directly before the accused, sat the grand master
of the temple, in full and ample robes of flowing white, holding in his
hand the mystic staff, which bore the symbol of the order. at his feet
was placed a table, occupied by two scribes, chap

y be convoked. also, in all such
chapters, it is our duty to hear the advice of our brethren, and to
proceed according to our own pleasure. but when the raging wolf hath
made an inroad upon the flock, and carried off one member thereof, it is
the duty of the kind shepherd to call his comrades together, that with
bows and slings they may quell the invader, according to our well-known
rule, that the lion is ever to be beaten down. we have therefore
summoned to our presence a jewish woman, by name rebecca, daughter
of isaac of york--a woman infamous for sortileges and for witcheries;
whereby she hath maddened the blood, and besotted the brain, not of a
churl, but of a knight--not of a secular knight, but of one devoted
to the service of the holy temple--not of a knight companion, but of a
preceptor of our order, first in honour as in place. our brother, brian
de bois-guilbert, is well known to ourselves, and to all degrees who now

occasioned his utter falling away.--stand forth, therefore, and bear

of the sum and bearing thereof; and judge whether our justice may be
satisfied with the punishment of this infidel woman, or if we must
go on, with a bleeding heart, to the further proceeding against our
brother.”

several witnesses were called upon to prove the risks to which
bois-guilbert exposed himself in endeavouring to save rebecca from the
blazing castle, and his neglect of his personal defence in attending to
her safety. the men gave these details with the exaggerations common to
vulgar minds which have been strongly excited by any remarkable event,
and their natural disposition to the marvellous was greatly increased
by the satisfaction which their evidence seemed to afford to the eminent
person for whose information it had been delivered. thus the dangers
which bois-guilbert surmounted, in themselves sufficiently grea

t, became
portentous in their narrative. the devotion of the knight to rebecca’s
defence was exaggerated beyond the bounds, not only of discretion, but
even of the most frantic excess of chivalrous zeal; and his deference
to what she said, even although her language was often severe and
upbraiding, was painted as carried to an excess, which, in a man of his
haughty temper, seemed almost preternatural.

the preceptor of templestowe was then called on to describe the manner
in which bois-guilbert and the jewess arrived at the preceptory. the
evidence of malvoisin was skil

fully guarded. but while he apparently
studied to spare the feelings of bois-guilbert, he threw in, from time
to time, such hints, as seemed to infer that he laboured under some
temporary alienation of mind, so deeply did he appear to be enamoured of
the damsel whom he brought along with him. with sighs of penitence, the
preceptor avowed his own contrition for having admitted rebecca and
her lover within the walls of the preceptory--“but my defence,” he
concluded, “has been made in my confession to our most reverend father
the grand master; he knows my motives were not evil, though my conduct
may have been irregular. joyfully will i submit to any penance he shall
assign me.”

“thou hast spoken well, brother albert,” said beaumanoir; “thy motives
were good, since thou didst judge it right to arrest thine erring
brother in his career of precipitate folly. but th

ight have incurred by the
guilt of having been cured of the palsy by a jewish damsel. perfectly
cured he certainly was not, for he supported himself forward on crutches
to give evidence. most unwilling was his testimony, and given with many
tears; but he admitted that two years since, when residing at york, he
was suddenly afflicted with a sore disease, while labouring for isaac
the rich jew, in his vocation of a joiner; that he had been unable to
stir from his bed until the remedies applied by rebecca’s directions,
and especially a warming and spicy-smelling balsam, had in some degree
restored him to the use of his limbs. moreover, he said, she had given
him a pot of that precious ointment, and furnished him with a piece of
money withal, to return to the house of his father, near to templestowe.
“and may it please your gracious reverence,” said the man, “i cannot
think the damsel meant harm by me, though she hath the ill hap to be a
jewess; for even when i used her remedy, i said the

faithful service.”

“out with the prating villain!” said beaumanoir, who was not prepared to
refute this practical application of his general maxim.

higg, the son of snell, withdrew into the crowd, but, interested in the
fate of his benefactress, lingered until he should learn her doom, even
at the risk of again encountering the frown of that severe judge, the
terror of which withered his very heart within him.

at this period of the trial, the grand master commanded rebecca to
unveil herself. opening her lips for the first time, she replied
patiently, but with dignity,--“that it was not the wont of the daughters
of her people to uncover their faces when alone in an assembly of
strangers.” the sweet tones of her voice, and the softness of her
reply, impressed on the audience a sentiment of pity and sympathy. but
beaumanoir, in whose mind the suppression of each feeling of humanity
which could interfere with his imagined duty, was a virtue of itself,

ounger knights told each other with their
eyes, in silent correspondence, that brian’s best apology was in the
power of her real charms, rather than of her imaginary witchcraft. but
higg, the son of snell, felt most deeply the effect produced by the
sight of the countenance of his benefactress.

“let me go forth,” he said to the warders at the door of the hall,--“let
me go forth!--to look at her again will kill me, for i have had a share
in murdering her.”

“peace, poor man,” said rebecca, when she heard his exclamation; “thou
hast done me no harm by speaking the truth--thou canst not aid me by
thy complaints or lamentations. peace, i pray thee--go home and save
thyself.”

higg was about to be thrust out by the compassion of the warders,
who were apprehensive lest his clamorous grief should draw upon them
reprehension, and upon himself punishment. but he promised to be silent,
and was permitted to remain. the two men-at-arms, with whom albert
malvoisin had not failed to comm

trivial, and natural in themselves, but rendered pregnant
with suspicion by the exaggerated manner in which they were told, and
the sinister commentary which the witnesses added to the facts. the
circumstances of their evidence would have been, in modern days, divided
into two classes--those which were immaterial, and those which were
actually and physically impossible. but both were, in those ignorant
and superstitions times, easily credited as proofs of guilt.--the first
class set forth, that rebecca was heard to mutter to herself in an
unknown tongue--that the songs she sung by fits were of a strangely
sweet sound, which made the ears of the hearer tingle, and his heart
throb--that she spoke at times to herself, and seemed to look upward
for a reply--that her garments were of a strange and mystic form,
unlike those of women of good repute--that she had rings impressed with
cabalistical devices, and that strange characters were broidered on her
veil.

all these circumstances, so natural and
 
 ___________________________
 
 so trivial, were gravely
listened to as proofs, or, at least, as affording strong suspicions that
rebecca had unlawful correspondence with mystical powers.

but there was less equivocal testimony, which the credulity of
the assembly, or of the greater part, greedily swallowed, however
incredible. one of the soldiers had seen her work a cure upon a wounded
man, brought with them to the castle of torquilstone. she did, he said,
make certain signs upon the wound, and repeated certain mysterious
words, which he blessed god he understood not, when the iron head of a
square cross-bow bolt disengaged itse
 
 ___________________________
 
lf from the wound, the bleeding was
stanched, the wound was closed, and the dying man was, within a quarter
of an hour, walking upon the ramparts, and assisting the witness in
managing a mangonel, or machine for hurling stones. this legend was
probably founded upon the fact, that rebecca had attended on the
wounded ivanhoe when in the castle of torquilstone. but it was the
more difficult to dispute the accuracy of the witness, as, in order to
produce real evidence in support of his verbal testimony, he drew from
his pouch the very bolt-head, which, according to his story, had been
miraculously extracted from the wound; and as the iron weighed a full
ounce, it completely confirmed the tale, however marvellous.

his comrade had been a witness from a neighbouring battlement of the
 
 ___________________________
 

scene betwixt rebecca and bois-guilbert, when she was upon the point of
precipitating herself from the top of the tower. not to be behind his
companion, this fellow stated, that he had seen rebecca perch herself
upon the parapet of the turret, and there take the form of a milk-white
swan, under which appearance she flitted three times round the castle of
torquilstone; then again settle on the turret, and once more assume the
female form.

less than one half of this weighty evidence would have been sufficient
to convict any old woman, poor and ugly, even though she had not been a
jewess. united with that fatal circumstance, the body of proof was too
weighty for rebecca’s youth, though co

beauty.

the grand master had collected the suffrages, and now in a solemn
tone demanded of rebecca what she had to say against the sentence of
condemnation, which he was about to pronounce.

“to invoke your pity,” said the lovely jewess, with a voice somewhat
tremulous with emotion, “would, i am aware, be as useless as i should
hold it mean. to state that to relieve the sick and wounded of another
religion, cannot be displeasing to the acknowledged founder of both our
faiths, were also unavailing; to plead that many things which these men

which thou dost wear, by the name
thou dost inherit--by the knighthood thou dost vaunt--by the honour of
thy mother--by the tomb and the bones of thy father--i conjure thee to
say, are these things true?”

“answer her, brother,” said the grand master, “if the enemy with whom
thou dost wrestle will give thee power.”

in fact, bois-guilbert seemed agitated by contending passions, which
almost convulsed his features, and it was with a constrained voice that
at last he replied, looking to rebecca,--“the scroll!--the scroll!”

“ay,” said beaumanoir, “this is indeed testimony! the victim of her
witcheries can only name the fatal scroll, the spell inscribed on which
is, doubtless, the cause of his silence.”

but rebecca put another interpretation on the words extorted as it were
from bois-guilbert, and glancing her eye upon the slip of parchment
which she continued to hold in her hand, she read written thereupon in
the arabian character, “demand a champion!” the murmuring c

ommentary
which ran through the assembly at the strange reply of bois-guilbert,
gave rebecca leisure to examine and instantly to destroy the scroll
unobserved. when the whisper had ceased, the grand master spoke.

“rebecca, thou canst derive no benefit from the evidence of this unhappy
knight, for whom, as we well perceive, the enemy is yet too powerful.
hast thou aught else to say?”

“there is yet one chance of life left to me,” said rebecca, “even by
your own fierce laws. life has been miserable--miserable, at least, of
late--but i will not cast away the gift of god, while he affords me the
means of defending it. i deny this charge--i maintain my innocence, and
i declare the falsehood of this accusation--i challenge the privilege of
trial by combat, and will appear by my champion.”

“and who, rebecca,” replied the grand master, “will lay lance in rest
for a sorceress? who will be the champion of a jewess?”

“god will

 raise me up a champion,” said rebecca--“it cannot be that in
merry england--the hospitable, the generous, the free, where so many are
ready to peril their lives for honour, there will not be found one
to fight for justice. but it is enough that i challenge the trial by
combat--there lies my gage.”

she took her embroidered glove from her hand, and flung it down before
the grand master with an air of mingled simplicity and dignity, which
excited universal surprise and admiration.

even lucas beaumanoir himself was affected by the mien and appearance
of rebecca. he was not originally a cruel or even a severe man; but
with passions by nature cold, and with a high, though mistaken, sense of
duty, his heart had been gradually hardened by the ascetic life which he

of subduing infidelity and eradicating heresy, which he conceived
peculiarly incumbent on him. his features relaxed in their usual

witchcrafts--turn thee from thine evil faith--embrace this holy
emblem, and all shall yet be well with thee here and hereafter. in some
sisterhood of the strictest order, shalt thou have time for prayer and
fitting penance, and that repentance not to be repented of. this do and

“it was the law of my fathers,” said rebecca; “it was delivered in
thunders and in storms upon the mountain of sinai, in cloud and in fire.

my teachers have not taught me.”

“let our chaplain,” said beaumanoir, “stand forth, and tell this

“forgive the interruption,” said rebecca, meekly; “i am a maiden,
unskilled to dispute for my religion, but i can die for it, if it be
god’s will.--let me pray your answer to my demand of a

champion.”

“give me her glove,” said beaumanoir. “this is indeed,” he continued, as
he looked at the flimsy texture and slender fingers, “a slight and frail
gage for a purpose so deadly!--seest thou, rebecca, as this thin and
light glove of thine is to one of our heavy steel gauntlets, so is
thy cause to that of the temple, for it is our order which thou hast
defied.”

“cast my innocence into the scale,” answered rebecca, “and the glove of
silk shall outweigh the glove of iron.”

“then thou dost persist in thy refusal to confess thy guilt, and in that
bold challenge which thou hast made?”

“i do persist, noble sir,” answered rebecca.

“so be it then, in the name of heaven,” said the grand master; “and may
god show the right!”

“amen,” replied the preceptors around him, and the word was deeply
echoed by the whole assembly.

“brethren,” said beaumanoir, “you are aware that we might w

refused to this woman the benefit of the trial by combat--but though a
jewess and an unbeliever, she is also a stranger and defenceless, and
god forbid that she should ask the benefit of our mild laws, and that it
should be refused to her. moreover, we are knights and soldiers as well
as men of religion, and shame it were to us upon any pretence, to
refuse proffered combat. thus, therefore, stands the case. rebecca,
the daughter of isaac of york, is, by many frequent and suspicious
circumstances, defamed of sorcery practised on the person of a noble
knight of our holy order, and hath challenged the combat in proof of her
innocence. to whom, reverend brethren, is it your opinion that we should
deliver the gage of battle, naming him, at the same time, to be our
champion on the field?”

“to brian de bois-guilbert, whom it chiefly concerns,” said the
preceptor of goodalricke, “and who, moreover, best

ore weighty cause.”

“reverend father,” answered the preceptor of goodalricke, “no spell can
effect the champion who comes forward to fight for the judgment of god.”

“thou sayest right, brother,” said the grand master. “albert malvoisin,
give this gage of battle to brian de bois-guilbert.--it is our charge to
thee, brother,” he continued, addressing himself to bois-guilbert, “that
thou do thy battle manfully, nothing doubting that the good cause shall
triumph.--and do thou, rebecca, attend, that we assign thee the third
day from the present to find a champion.”

“that is but brief space,” answered rebecca, “for a stranger, who is
also of another faith, to find one who will do battle, wagering life
and honour for her cause, against a knight who is called an approved
soldier.”

“we may not extend it,” answered the grand master; “the field must be
foughten in our own presence, and divers weighty causes call us on the
fourth day from hence.”

“god’s will

 be done!” said rebecca; “i put my trust in him, to whom an
instant is as effectual to save as a whole age.”

“thou hast spoken well, damsel,” said the grand master; “but well know
we who can array himself like an angel of light. it remains but to name
a fitting place of combat, and, if it so hap, also of execution.--where
is the preceptor of this house?”

albert malvoisin, still holding rebecca’s glove in his hand, was
speaking to bois-guilbert very earnestly, but in a low voice.

“how!” said the grand master, “will he not receive the gage?”

“he will--he doth, most reverend father,” said malvoisin, slipping the
glove under his own mantle. “and for the place of combat, i hold the
fittest to be the lists of saint george belonging to this preceptory,
and used by us for military exercise.”

“it is well,” said the grand master.--“rebecca, in those lists shalt

one of the chaplains, who acted as clerks to the chapter, immediately
engrossed the order in a huge volume, which contained the proceedings of
the templar knights when solemnly assembled on such occasions; and when
he had finished writing, the other read aloud the sentence of the grand
master, which, when translated from the norman-french in which it was
couched, was expressed as follows.--

“rebecca, a jewess, daughter of isaac of york, being attainted of
sorcery, seduction, and other damnable practices, practised on a knight
of the most holy order of the temple of zion, doth deny the same; and
saith, that the testimony delivered against her this day is false,
wicked, and disloyal; and that by lawful ‘essoine’ [54] of her body as
being unable to combat in her own behalf, she doth offer, by a champion
instead thereof, to avouch her case, he performing his loyal ‘devoir’ in
all knigh

to appear there by her champion, on pain of doom, as a person convicted
of sorcery or seduction; and also the defendant so to appear, under the
penalty of being held and adjudged recreant in case of default; and the
noble lord and most reverend father aforesaid appointed the battle to be
done in his own presence, and according to all that is commendable and
profitable in such a case. and may god aid the just cause!”

“amen!” said the grand master; and the word was echoed by all around.
rebecca spoke not, but she looked up to heaven, and, folding her hands,
remained for a minute without change of attitude. she then modestly
reminded the grand master, that she ought to be permitted some
opportunity of free communication with her friends, for the purpose of
making her condition known to them, and procuring, if possible, some
champion to fight in her behalf.

“it is just and lawful,” said the grand master; “choose what messenger
thou shalt trust, and he shall have free communicatio

n with thee in thy
prison-chamber.”

“is there,” said rebecca, “any one here, who, either for love of a good
cause, or for ample hire, will do the errand of a distressed being?”

all were silent; for none thought it safe, in the presence of the grand
master, to avow any interest in the calumniated prisoner, lest he
should be suspected of leaning towards judaism. not even the prospect of
reward, far less any feelings of compassion alone, could surmount this
apprehension.

rebecca stood for a few moments in indescribable anxiety, and then
exclaimed, “is it really thus?--and, in english land, am i to be
deprived of the poor chance of safety which remains to me, for want of
an act of charity which would not be refused to the worst criminal?”

higg, the son of snell, at length replied, “i am but a maimed man,
but that i can at all stir or move was owing to her charitable
assistance.--i will do thine errand,” he added, addressing rebecca, “as
well as a crippled obj

to repair the mischief done by my tongue. alas! when i boasted of thy
charity, i little thought i was leading thee into danger!”

“god,” said rebecca, “is the disposer of all. he can turn back the
captivity of judah, even by the weakest instrument. to execute his
message the snail is as sure a messenger as the falcon. seek out isaac
of york--here is that will pay for horse and man--let him have this
scroll.--i know not if it be of heaven the spirit which inspires me,
but most truly do i judge that i am not to die this death, and that a
champion will be raised up for me. farewell!--life and death are in thy
haste.”

to proceed to phlebotomy, when the object of his anxious solicitude
suddenly revived; but it was to dash his cap from his head, and to throw
dust on his grey hairs. the physician was at first inclined to ascribe
this sudden and violent emotion to the effects of insanity; and,
adhering to his original purpose, began once again to handle his
implements. but isaac soon convinced him of his error.

“child of my sorrow,” he said, “well shouldst thou be called benoni,
instead of rebecca! why should thy death bring down my grey hairs to the
grave, till, in the bitterness of my heart, i curse god and die!”

“brother,” said the rabbi, in great surprise, “art thou a father in
israel, and dost thou utter words like unto these?--i trust that the
child of thy house yet liveth?”

“she liveth,” answered isaac; “but it is as daniel, who was called
beltheshazzar, even when within the den of the lions. she is captive
unto those men of belial, and they will wreak their crue

rebecca, daughter of rachel! the darkness of the shadow of death hath
encompassed thee.”

“yet read the scroll,” said the rabbi; “peradventure it may be that we
may yet find out a way of deliverance.”

“do thou read, brother,” answered isaac, “for mine eyes are as a
fountain of water.”

the physician read, but in their native language, the following words:--

father; for he hath favour among the strong men of his people, and as
he was our companion in the house of bondage, he may find some one to do
battle for my sake. and say unto him, even unto him, even unto wilfred,
the son of cedric, that if rebecca live, or if rebecca die, she liveth
or dieth wholly free of the guilt she is charged withal. and if it be
the will of god that thou shalt be deprived of thy daughter, do not

     o maid, unrelenting and cold as thou art,
     my bosom is proud as thine own.
     --seward

it was in the twilight of the day when her trial, if it could be
called such, had taken place, that a low knock was heard at the door
of rebecca’s prison-chamber. it disturbed not the inmate, who was then
engaged in the evening prayer recommended by her religion, and which
concluded with a hymn we have ventured thus to translate into english.

     when israel, of the lord beloved,
     out of the land of bondage came,
     her father’s god before her moved,
     an awful guide, in smoke and flame.

     the cloudy pillar glided slow;

     be thou, long-suffering, slow to wrath,
     a burning, and a shining light!

     our harps we left by babel’s streams,
     the tyrant’s jest, the gentile’s scorn;
     no censer round our altar beams,
     and mute our timbrel, trump, and horn.
     but thou hast said, the blood of goat,
     the flesh of rams, i will not prize;
     a contrite heart, and humble thought,
     are mine accepted sacrifice.

when the sounds of rebecca’s devotional hymn had died away in silence,
the low knock at the door was again renewed. “enter,” she said, “if
thou art a friend; and if a foe, i have not the means of refusing thy
entrance.”

“i am,” said brian de bois-guilbert, entering the apartment, “friend or
foe, rebecca, as the event of this interview shall make me.”

alarmed at the sight of this man, whose licentious passion she
considered as the root of her misfortunes, rebecca drew backward with
a cautious and alarm

corner of the apartment, as if determined to retreat as far as she
could, but to stand her ground when retreat became no longer possible.
she drew herself into an attitude not of defiance, but of resolution,
as one that would avoid provoking assault, yet was resolute to repel it,
being offered, to the utmost of her power.

“you have no reason to fear me, rebecca,” said the templar; “or if i
must so qualify my speech, you have at least now no reason to fear me.”

“i fear you not, sir knight,” replied rebecca, although her short-drawn
breath seemed to belie the heroism of her accents; “my trust is strong,
and i fear thee not.”

“you have no cause,” answered bois-guilbert, gravely; “my former frantic
attempts you have not now to dread. within your call are guards, over
whom i have no authority. they are designed to conduct you to death

“may heaven be praised!” said the jewess; “death is the least of my
apprehensions in this den of evil.”

“ay,” replied the templar, “the idea of death is easily received by the
courageous mind, when the road to it is sudden and open. a thrust with a
lance, a stroke with a sword, were to me little--to you, a spring from

compared with what either thinks disgrace. mark me--i say this--perhaps
mine own sentiments of honour are not less fantastic, rebecca, than
thine are; but we know alike how to die for them.”

“unhappy man,” said the jewess; “and art thou condemned to expose thy
life for principles, of which thy sober judgment does not acknowledge
the solidity? surely this is a parting with your treasure for that which
is not bread--but deem not so of me. thy resolution may fluctuate on the
wild and changeful billows of human opinion, but mine is anchored on the
rock of ages.”

“silence, maiden,” answered the templar; “such dis

little. thou art condemned to die not a sudden and easy death, such as
misery chooses, and despair welcomes, but a slow, wretched, protracted
course of torture, suited to what the diabolical bigotry of these men
calls thy crime.”

“and to whom--if such my fate--to whom do i owe this?” said rebecca
“surely only to him, who, for a most selfish and brutal cause, dragged
me hither, and who now, for some unknown purpose of his own, strives to
exaggerate the wretched fate to which he exposed me.”

“think not,” said the templar, “that i have so exposed thee; i would
have bucklered thee against such danger with my own bosom, as freely as
ever i exposed it to the shafts which had otherwise reached thy life.”

“had thy purpose been the honourable protection of the innocent,” said

ebecca, “i had thanked thee for thy care--as it is, thou hast claimed
merit for it so often, that i tell thee life is worth nothing to me,
preserved at the price which thou wouldst exact for it.”

“truce with thine upbraidings, rebecca,” said the templar; “i have my
own cause of grief, and brook not that thy reproaches should add to it.”

“what is thy purpose, then, sir knight?” said the jewess; “speak it
briefly.--if thou hast aught to do, save to witness the misery thou
hast caused, let me know it; and then, if so it please you, leave me to
myself--the step between time and eternity is short but terrible, and i
have few moments to prepare for it.”

“i perceive, rebecca,” said bois-guilbert, “that thou do

st continue to
burden me with the charge of distresses, which most fain would i have
prevented.”

“sir knight,” said rebecca, “i would avoid reproaches--but what is more
certain than that i owe my death to thine unbridled passion?”

“you err--you err,”--said the templar, hastily, “if you impute what
i could neither foresee nor prevent to my purpose or agency.--could i
guess the unexpected arrival of yon dotard, whom some flashes of frantic
valour, and the praises yielded by fools to the stupid self-torments
of an ascetic, have raised for the present above his own merits, above
common sense, above me, and ab

ove the hundreds of our order, who think
and feel as men free from such silly and fantastic prejudices as are the
grounds of his opinions and actions?”

“yet,” said rebecca, “you sate a judge upon me, innocent--most
innocent--as you knew me to be--you concurred in my condemnation, and,
if i aright understood, are yourself to appear in arms to assert my
guilt, and assure my punishment.”

“thy patience, maiden,” replied the templar. “no race knows so well as
thine own tribes how to submit to the time, and so to trim their bark as
to make advantage even of an adverse wind.”

“lamented be the hour,” said rebecca, “that has taught such art to

ut adversity bends the heart as fire bends the
stubborn steel, and those who are no longer their own governors, and
the denizens of their own free independent state, must crouch before
strangers. it is our curse, sir knight, deserved, doubtless, by our own
misdeeds and those of our fathers; but you--you who boast your freedom
as your birthright, how much deeper is your disgrace when you stoop to
soothe the prejudices of others, and that against your own conviction?”

“your words are bitter, rebecca,” said bois-guilbert, pacing the
apartment with impatience, “but i came not hither to bandy reproaches
with you.--know that bois-guilbert yields not to created man, although
circumstances may for a time induce him to alter his plan. his will is
the mountain stream, which may indeed be turned for a little space aside
by the rock, but fails not to find its course to the ocean. that scroll
which warned thee to demand a champion, from whom couldst thou think it

in whom else couldst thou have excited
such interest?”

“a brief respite from instant death,” said rebecca, “which will little
avail me--was this all thou couldst do for one, on whose head thou hast
heaped sorrow, and whom thou hast brought near even to the verge of the
tomb?”

“no maiden,” said bois-guilbert, “this was not all that i purposed. had
it not been for the accursed interference of yon fanatical dotard, and
the fool of goodalricke, who, being a templar, affects to think and
judge according to the ordinary rules of humanity, the office of the

of the order. then i myself--such was my purpose--had, on the sounding
of the trumpet, appeared in the lists as thy champion, disguised indeed
in the fashion of a roving knight, who seeks adventures to prove his
shield and spear; and then, let beaumanoir have chosen not one, but two
or three of the brethren here assembled, i had not doubted to cast them
out of the saddle with my single lance. thus, rebecca, should thine
innocence have been avouched, and to thine own gratitude would i have
trusted for the reward of my victory.”

“this, sir knight,” said rebecca, “is but idle boasting--a brag of what
you would have done had you not found it convenient to do otherwise. you
received my glove, and my champion, if a creature so desolate can find
one, must encounter your lance in the lists--yet you would assume the
air of my friend and protector!”

“thy friend and protector,” said the temp

and then blame me not if i make my stipulations, before i offer up all
that i have hitherto held dear, to save the life of a jewish maiden.”

“speak,” said rebecca; “i understand thee not.”

“well, then,” said bois-guilbert, “i will speak as freely as ever
did doting penitent to his ghostly father, when placed in the tricky
confessional.--rebecca, if i appear not in these lists i lose fame and
rank--lose that which is the breath of my nostrils, the esteem, i mean,
in which i am held by my brethren, and the hopes i have of succeeding to
that mighty authority, which is now wielded by the bigoted dotard lucas
de beaumanoir, but of which i should make a different use. such is my
certain doom, except i appear in arms against thy cause. accursed be he

“and what now avails rant or flattery?” answered rebecca. “thou hast
made thy choice between causing to be shed the blood of an innocent
woman, or of endangering thine own earthly state and earthly hopes--what
avails it to reckon together?--thy choice is made.”

“no, rebecca,” said the knight, in a softer tone, and drawing nearer
towards her; “my choice is not made--nay, mark, it is thine to make the
election. if i appear in the lists, i must maintain my name in arms;
and if i do so, championed or unchampioned, thou diest by the stake and

minion of ivanhoe. ivanhoe, as thou well knowest, is unable to bear
his corslet, and richard is in a foreign prison. if i appear, then thou
diest, even although thy charms should instigate some hot-headed youth
to enter the lists in thy defence.”

“and what avails repeating this so often?” said rebecca.

“much,” replied the templar; “for thou must learn to look at thy fate on
every side.”

“well, then, turn the tapestry,” said the jewess, “and let me see the
other side.”

“if i appear,” said bois-guilbert, “in the fatal lists, thou diest by a
slow and cruel death, in pain such as they say is destined to the guilty
hereafter. but if i appear not, then am i a degraded and dishonoured
knight, accused of witchcraft and of communion with infidels--the
illustrious name which h

as grown yet more so under my wearing, becomes a
hissing and a reproach. i lose fame, i lose honour, i lose the prospect
of such greatness as scarce emperors attain to--i sacrifice mighty
ambition, i destroy schemes built as high as the mountains with which
heathens say their heaven was once nearly scaled--and yet, rebecca,” he
added, throwing himself at her feet, “this greatness will i sacrifice,
this fame will i renounce, this power will i forego, even now when it
is half within my grasp, if thou wilt say, bois-guilbert, i receive thee
for my lover.”

“think not of such foolishness, sir knight,” answered rebecca, “but
hasten to the regent, the queen mother, and to prince john--they cannot,
in honour to the english crown, allow of the proceedings of your grand
master. so shall you give me protection

without sacrifice on your part,
or the pretext of requiring any requital from me.”

“with these i deal not,” he continued, holding the train of her
robe--“it is thee only i address; and what can counterbalance thy
choice? bethink thee, were i a fiend, yet death is a worse, and it is
death who is my rival.”

“i weigh not these evils,” said rebecca, afraid to provoke the wild
knight, yet equally determined neither to endure his passion, nor even
feign to endure it. “be a man, be a christian! if indeed thy faith
recommends that mercy which rather your tongues than your actions
pretend, save me from this dreadful death, without seeking a requital
which would change thy magnanimity into base barter.”

“no, damsel!” said the proud templar, springing up, “thou shalt not thus

 he said, again softening his tone; “england,--europe,--is not the

ambition. we will go to palestine, where conrade, marquis of montserrat,
is my friend--a friend free as myself from the doting scruples which
fetter our free-born reason--rather with saladin will we league
ourselves, than endure the scorn of the bigots whom we contemn.--i will
form new paths to greatness,” he continued, again traversing the room
with

hasty strides--“europe shall hear the loud step of him she has
driven from her sons!--not the millions whom her crusaders send to
slaughter, can do so much to defend palestine--not the sabres of the
thousands and ten thousands of saracens can hew their way so deep into
that land for which nations are striving, as the strength and policy of
me and those brethren, who, in despite of yonder old bigot, will adhere
to me in good and evil. thou shalt be a queen, rebecca--on mount carmel
shall we pitch the throne which my valour will gain for you, and i will
exchange my long-desired batoon for a sceptre!”

“a dream,” said rebecca; “an empty vision of the night, which, were it
a waking reality, affects me not. enough, that the power which thou
mightest acquire, i will never share; nor hold i so light of country or
religious faith, as to esteem him who is willing to barter these ties,
and cast away the bonds of the order of which he is a sworn member,

people.--put not a price on my deliverance, sir knight--sell not a deed
of generosity--protect the oppressed for the sake of charity, and not
for a selfish advantage--go to the throne of england; richard will
listen to my appeal from these cruel men.”

“never, rebecca!” said the templar, fiercely. “if i renounce my order,
for thee alone will i renounce it--ambition shall remain mine, if thou
refuse my love; i will not be fooled on all hands.--stoop my crest to
richard?--ask a boon of that heart of pride?--never, rebecca, will i
place the order of the temple at his feet in my person. i may forsake
the order, i never will degrade or betray it.”

“now god be gracious to me,” said rebecca, “for the succour of man is

“it is i

not any human consideration shall prevent my putting forth my strength;

worst of criminals--to be consumed upon a blazing pile--dispersed to the
elements of which our strange forms are so mystically composed--not a
relic left of that graceful frame, from which we could say this lived
and moved!--rebecca, it is not in woman to sustain this prospect--thou
wilt yield to my suit.”

“bois-guilbert,” answered the jewess, “thou knowest not the heart
of woman, or hast only conversed with those who are lost to her best
feelings. i tell thee, proud templar, that not in thy fiercest battles
hast thou displayed more of thy vaunted courage, than has been shown
by woman when called upon to suffer by affection or duty. i am myself a

heaven that we had never met, or that thou hadst been noble in birth and

and how we are next to meet, i could even wish myself one of thine own
degraded nation; my hand conversant with ingots and shekels, instead of
spear and shield; my head bent down before each petty noble, and my look
only terrible to the shivering and bankrupt debtor--this could i wish,
rebecca, to be near to thee in life, and to escape the fearful share i
must have in thy death.”

“thou hast spoken the jew,” said rebecca, “as the persecution of such
as thou art has made him. heaven in ire has driven him from his country,
but industry has opened to him the only road to power and to influence,
which oppression has left unbarred. read the ancient history of the
people of god, and tell me if those, by whom jehovah wrought such

usurers!--and know, proud knight, we number names amongst us to which
your boasted northern nobility is as the gourd compared with the
cedar--names that ascend far back to those high times when the divine
presence shook the mercy-seat between the cherubim, and which derive
their splendour from no earthly prince, but from the awful voice, which
bade their fathers be nearest of the congregation to the vision--such
were the princes of the house of jacob.”

rebecca’s colour rose as she boasted the ancient glories of her race,
but faded as she added, with at sigh, “such were the princes of judah,
now such no more!--they are trampled down like the shorn grass, and
mixed with the mire of the ways. yet are there those among them who
shame not such high descent, and of such shall be the daughter of isaac

i are but the blind instruments of some irresistible fatality, that
hurries us along, like goodly vessels driving before the storm, which
are dashed against each other, and so perish. forgive me, then, and let
us part, at least, as friends part. i have assailed thy resolution in
vain, and mine own is fixed as the adamantine decrees of fate.”

“thus,” said rebecca, “do men throw on fate the issue of their own wild
passions. but i do forgive thee, bois-guilbert, though the author of my
early death. there are noble things which cross over thy powerful mind;
but it is the garden of the sluggard, and the weeds have rushed up, and
conspired to choke the fair and wholesome blossom.”

“yes,” said the templar, “i am, rebecca, as thou hast spoken me,
untaught, untamed--and proud, that, amidst a shoal of empty fools and
crafty bigots, i have retained the

 preeminent fortitude that places me

in my views, steady and inflexible in pursuing them. such must i
remain--proud, inflexible, and unchanging; and of this the world shall
have proof.--but thou forgivest me, rebecca?”

“as freely as ever victim forgave her executioner.”

“farewell, then,” said the templar, and left the apartment.

the preceptor albert waited impatiently in an adjacent chamber the
return of bois-guilbert.

“thou hast tarried long,” he said; “i have been as if stretched on
red-hot iron with very impatience. what if the grand master, or his spy
conrade, had come hither? i had paid dear for my complaisance.--but what
ails thee, brother?--thy step totters, thy brow is as black a

he left the apartment hastily as he uttered these words, and the
preceptor followed, to watch and confirm him in his resolution; for in
bois-guilbert’s fame he had himself a strong interest, expecting much
advantage from his being one day at the head of the order, not to
mention the preferment of which mont-fitchet had given him hopes, on
condition he would forward the condemnation of the unfortunate rebecca.
yet although, in combating his friend’s better feelings, he possessed
all the advantage which a wily, composed, selfish disposition has over
a man agitated by strong and contending passions, it required all
malvoisin’s art to keep bois-guilbert steady to the purpose he had
prevailed on him to adopt. he was obliged to watch him closely
to prevent his resuming his purpose of flight, to intercept his
communication with the grand master, lest he should come to an open
rupture with his superior

, and to renew, from time to time, the various
arguments by which he endeavoured to show, that, in appearing as
champion on this occasion, bois-guilbert, without either accelerating or
ensuring the fate of rebecca, would follow the only course by which he
could save himself from degradation and disgrace.

our scene now returns to the exterior of the castle, or preceptory, of
templestowe, about the hour when the bloody die was to be cast for the
life or death of rebecca. it was a scene of bustle and life, as if the
whole vicinity had poured forth its inhabitants to a village wake, or
rural feast. but the earnest desire to look on blood and death, is not
peculiar to those dark ages; though in the gladiatorial exercise of
single combat and general tourney, they were habituated to the bloody
spectacle of brave men falling by each other’s hands. even in our own
days, when morals are better understood, an execution, a bruising match,
a riot, or a meeting of radic

this slow procession moved up the gentle eminence, on the summit of
which was the tiltyard, and, entering the lists, marched once around
them from right to left, and when they had completed the circle, made a
halt. there was then a momentary bustle, while the grand master and all
his attendants, excepting the champion and his godfathers, dismounted
from their horses, which were immediately removed out of the lists by
the esquires, who were in attendance for that purpose.

the unfortunate rebecca was conducted to the black chair placed near the
pile. on her first glance at the terrible spot where preparations were
making for a death alike dismaying to the mind and painful to the
body, she was observed to shudder and shut her eyes, praying internally
doubtless, for her lips moved though no speech was heard. in the space
of a minute she opened her eyes, looked fixedly on the pile as if to
familiarize her mind with the object, and then slowly and naturally
turned away her head.

meanwhile,

n, then, acting as godfather of the
champion, stepped forward, and laid the glove of the jewess, which was
the pledge of battle, at the feet of the grand master.

“valorous lord, and reverend father,” said he, “here standeth the good
knight, brian de bois-guilbert, knight preceptor of the order of the
temple, who, by accepting the pledge of battle which i now lay at your
reverence’s feet, hath become bound to do his devoir in combat this
day, to maintain that this jewish maiden, by name rebecca, hath justly
deserved the doom passed upon her in a chapter of this most holy order
of the temple of zion, condemning her to die as a sorceress;--here, i
say, he standeth, such battle to do, knightly and honourable, if such be
your noble and sanctified pleasure.”

“hath he made oath,” said the grand master, “that his quarrel is just
and honourable? bring forward the crucifix and the ‘te igitur’.”

“sir, and most reverend father,” answered malvoisin, readily, “our

assembly, and had invented this excuse to escape the necessity of his
doing so.

the grand master, having allowed the apology of albert malvoisin,
commanded the herald to stand forth and do his devoir. the trumpets
then again flourished, and a herald, stepping forward, proclaimed
aloud,--“oyez, oyez, oyez.--here standeth the good knight, sir brian
de bois-guilbert, ready to do battle with any knight of free blood, who
will sustain the quarrel allowed and allotted to the jewess rebecca, to
try by champion, in respect of lawful essoine of her own body; and to
such champion the reverend and valorous grand master here present allows
a fair field, and equal partition of sun and wind, and whatever else
appertains to a fair combat.” the trumpets again sounded, and there was
a dead pause of many minutes.

“no champion appears for the appellant,” said the grand master. “go,
herald, and ask her whether she expects any one to do battle for her
in this her cause.” the herald w

ent to the chair in which rebecca was
seated, and bois-guilbert suddenly turning his horse’s head toward that
end of the lists, in spite of hints on either side from malvoisin and
mont-fitchet, was by the side of rebecca’s chair as soon as the herald.

“is this regular, and according to the law of combat?” said malvoisin,
looking to the grand master.

“albert de malvoisin, it is,” answered beaumanoir; “for in this appeal
to the judgment of god, we may not prohibit parties from having that
communication with each other, which may best tend to bring forth the
truth of the quarrel.”

in the meantime, the herald spoke to rebecca in these terms:--“damsel,
the honourable and reverend the grand master 
 
 ___________________________
 
demands of thee, if thou
art prepared with a champion to do battle this day in thy behalf, or if
thou dost yield thee as one justly condemned to a deserved doom?”

“say to the grand master,” replied rebecca, “that i maintain my
innocence, and do not yield me as justly condemned, lest i become guilty
of mine own blood. say to him, that i challenge such delay as his forms
will permit, to see if god, whose opportunity is in man’s extremity,
will raise me up a deliverer; and when such uttermost space is passed,
may his holy will be done!” the herald retired to carry this answer to
the grand master.

“god forbid,” said lucas beaumanoir, “that jew or pagan should impeach
us of injustice!--un

til the shadows be cast from the west to the
eastward, will we wait to see if a champion shall appear for this
unfortunate woman. when the day is so far passed, let her prepare for
death.”

the herald communicated the words of the grand master to rebecca, who
bowed her head submissively, folded her arms, and, looking up towards
heaven, seemed to expect that aid from above which she could scarce
promise herself from man. during this awful pause, the voice of
bois-guilbert broke upon her ear--it was but a whisper, yet it startled
her more than the summons of the herald had appeared to do.

“rebecca,” said the templar, “dost thou hear me?”

“i have no portion in thee, cruel, hard-hearted man,” said the
unfortunate maiden.

“ay, but d
 
 ___________________________
 
ost thou understand my words?” said the templar; “for the
sound of my voice is frightful in mine own ears. i scarce know on what
ground we stand, or for what purpose they have brought us hither.--this
listed space--that chair--these faggots--i know their purpose, and yet
it appears to me like something unreal--the fearful picture of a vision,
which appals my sense with hideous fantasies, but convinces not my
reason.”

“my mind and senses keep touch and time,” answered rebecca, “and tell
me alike that these faggots are destined to consume my earthly body, and
open a painful but a brief passage to a better world.”

“dreams, rebecca,--dreams,” answered the templar; “idle visions,
rejected by the wisdom of your own wiser sadducees. hear me, rebecca,”
 he said, proceeding with animation; “a better chance hast thou for life
and liberty than yonder knaves and dotard dream of. mount thee behind me
on my steed--on zamor, the gallant horse that never failed his

rider.
i won him in single fight from the soldan of trebizond--mount, i say,
behind me--in one short hour is pursuit and enquiry far behind--a new
world of pleasure opens to thee--to me a new career of fame. let them
speak the doom which i despise, and erase the name of bois-guilbert from
their list of monastic slaves! i will wash out with blood whatever blot
they may dare to cast on my scutcheon.”

“tempter,” said rebecca, “begone!--not in this last extremity canst thou
move me one hair’s-breadth from my resting place--surrounded as i am by
foes, i hold thee as my worst and most deadly enemy--avoid thee, in the
name of god!”

albert malvoisin, alarmed and impatient at the duration of their
conference, now advanced to interrupt it.

“hath the maiden acknowledged her guilt?” he demanded of bois-guilbert;
“or is she resolute in her denial?”

“she is indeed resolute,” said bois-guilbert.

“then,
 
 ___________________________
 
young and beautiful a creature should
perish without one blow being struck in her behalf! were she ten times
a witch, provided she were but the least bit of a christian, my
quarter-staff should ring noon on the steel cap of yonder fierce
templar, ere he carried the matter off thus.”

it was, however, the general belief that no one could or would appear
for a jewess, accused of sorcery; and the knights, instigated by
malvoisin, whispered to each other, that it was time to declare the
pledge of rebecca forfeited. at this instant a knight, urging his horse
to speed, appeared on the plain advancing towards the lists. a
hundred voices exclaimed, “a champion! a champion!” and despite the
prepossessions and prejudices of the multitude, they shouted unanimously
as the knight rode into the tiltyard. the second glance, however, served
to destroy the hope that his timely arrival had excited. his horse,
urged for many miles to its utmost speed, appeared to reel from fatigue,
and the rider, however

undauntedly he presented himself in the lists,
either from weakness, weariness, or both, seemed scarce able to support
himself in the saddle.

to the summons of the herald, who demanded his rank, his name, and
purpose, the stranger knight answered readily and boldly, “i am a good
knight and noble, come hither to sustain with lance and sword the just
and lawful quarrel of this damsel, rebecca, daughter of isaac of york;
to uphold the doom pronounced against her to be false and truthless, and
to defy sir brian de bois-guilbert, as a traitor, murderer, and liar; as
i will prove in this field with my body against his, by the aid of god,
of our lady, and of monseigneur saint george, the good knight.”

“the stranger must first show,” said malvoisin, “that he is good knight,
and of honourable lineage. the temple sendeth not forth her champions
against nameless men.”

“my name,

--remember the
passage of arms at ashby--remember thy proud vaunt in the halls of
rotherwood, and the gage of your gold chain against my reliquary, that
thou wouldst do battle with wilfred of ivanhoe, and recover the honour
thou hadst lost! by that reliquary and the holy relic it contains, i
will proclaim thee, templar, a coward in every court in europe--in every
preceptory of thine order--unless thou do battle without farther delay.”

bois-guilbert turned his countenance irresolutely towards rebecca, and
then exclaimed, looking fiercely at ivanhoe, “dog of a saxon! take thy
lance, and prepare for the death thou hast drawn upon thee!”

“does the grand master allow me the combat?” said ivanhoe.

“i may not deny what thou hast challenged,” said the grand master,
“provided the maiden accepts thee as her champion. yet i would thou
wert in better plight to do battle. an enemy of our order hast thou ever
been, yet would i have thee honourably met with.”

“thus--thus as i am, and
 
 ___________________________
 
 not otherwise,” said ivanhoe; “it is the
judgment of god--to his keeping i commend myself.--rebecca,” said he,
riding up to the fatal chair, “dost thou accept of me for thy champion?”

“i do,” she said--“i do,” fluttered by an emotion which the fear of
death had been unable to produce, “i do accept thee as the champion whom
heaven hath sent me. yet, no--no--thy wounds are uncured--meet not that
proud man--why shouldst thou perish also?”

but ivanhoe was already at his post, and had closed his visor, and
assumed his lance. bois-guilbert did the same; and his esquire remarked,

ed during the
whole morning of an ashy paleness, was now become suddenly very much
flushed.

the herald, then, seeing each champion in his place, uplifted his voice,
repeating thrice--“faites vos devoirs, preux chevaliers!” after the
third cry, he withdrew to one side of the lists, and again proclaimed,
that none, on peril of instant death, should dare, by word, cry, or
action, to interfere with or disturb this fair field of combat. the
grand master, who held in his hand the gage of battle, rebecca’s glove,
now threw it into the lists, and pronounced the fatal signal words,
“laissez aller”.

the trumpets sounded, and the knights charged each other in full career.
the wearied horse of ivanhoe, and its no less exhausted rider, went
down, as all had expected, before the well-aimed lance and vigorous
steed of the templar. this issue of the combat all had foreseen; but
although the spear of ivanhoe did but, in comparison, touch the shield
of bois-guilbert, that champion, to the astonishm

 master, and no fear of the opposing and superior force,
which compelled them to withdraw.

“by the splendour of our lady’s brow!” said king richard, “it is pity
of their lives that these templars are not so trusty as they are
disciplined and valiant.”

the multitude, like a timid cur which waits to bark till the object of
its challenge has turned his back, raised a feeble shout as the rear of
the squadron left the ground.

during the tumult which attended the retreat of the templars, rebecca
saw and heard nothing--she was locked in the arms of her aged father,
giddy, and almost senseless, with the rapid change of circumstances
around her. but one word from isaac at length recalled her scattered
feelings.

“let us go,” he said, “my dear daughter, my recovered treasure--let us
go to throw ourselves at the feet of the good youth.”

“not so,” said rebecca, “o no--no--no--i must not at this moment dare
to speak to him--alas! i should say more than--no, my father, let us
in

stantly leave this evil place.”

“but, my daughter,” said isaac, “to leave him who hath come forth like a
strong man with his spear and shield, holding his life as nothing, so
he might redeem thy captivity; and thou, too, the daughter of a
people strange unto him and his--this is service to be thankfully
acknowledged.”

“it is--it is--most thankfully--most devoutly acknowledged,” said
rebecca--“it shall be still more so--but not now--for the sake of thy
beloved rachel, father, grant my request--not now!”

“nay, but,” said isaac, insisting, “they will deem us more thankless
than mere dogs!”

“but thou seest, my dear father, that king richard is in presence, and
that---”

“true, my best--my wisest rebecca!--let us hence--let us hence!--money

intimated a wish to discourse with the lady rowena alone. elgitha had no
sooner retired with unwilling steps, than, to the surprise of the lady
of ivanhoe, her fair visitant kneeled on one knee, pressed her hands to
her forehead, and bending her head to the ground, in spite of rowena’s
resistance, kissed the embroidered hem of her tunic.

“what means this, lady?” said the surprised bride; “or why do you offer
to me a deference so unusual?”

“because to you, lady of ivanhoe,” said rebecca, rising up and resuming
the usual quiet dignity of her manner, “i may lawfully, and without
rebuke, pay the debt of gratitude which i owe to wilfred of ivanhoe.
i am--forgive the boldness which has offered to you the homage of my
country--i am the unhappy jewess, for whom your husband hazarded his
life against such fearful odds in the tiltyard of templestowe.”

thee?”

“nothing,” said rebecca, calmly, “unless you will transmit to him my
grateful farewell.”

“you leave england then?” said rowena, scarce recovering the surprise of
this extraordinary visit.

“i leave it, lady, ere this moon again changes. my father had a brother
high in favour with mohammed boabdil, king of grenada--thither we go,
secure of peace and protection, for the payment of such ransom as the
moslem exact from our people.”

“and are you not then as well protected in england?” said rowena.
“my h

generous.”

“lady,” said rebecca, “i doubt it not--but the people of england are a
fierce race, quarrelling ever with their neighbours or among themselves,
and ready to plunge the sword into the bowels of each other. such is
no safe abode for the children of my people. ephraim is an heartless
dove--issachar an over-laboured drudge, which stoops between two
burdens. not in a land of war and blood, surrounded by hostile
neighbours, and distracted by internal factions, can israel hope to rest

she who nursed the sick-bed of ivanhoe,” she continued, rising with
enthusiasm--“she can have nothing to fear in england, where saxon and
norman will contend who shall most do her honour.”

“thy speech is fair, lady,” said rebecca, “and thy purpose fairer; but
it may not be--there is a gulf betwixt us. our breeding, our faith,
alike forbid either to pass over it. farewell--yet, ere i go indulge me
one request. the bridal-veil hangs over thy face; deign to raise it, and
let me see the features of which fame speaks so highly.”

“they are scarce worthy of being looked upon,” said rowena; “but,
expecting the same from my visitant, i remove the veil.”

she took it off accordingly; and, partly from the consciousnes

s of
beauty, partly from bashfulness, she blushed so intensely, that cheek,
brow, neck, and bosom, were suffused with crimson. rebecca blushed also,
but it was a momentary feeling; and, mastered by higher emotions, past
slowly from her features like the crimson cloud, which changes colour
when the sun sinks beneath the horizon.

“lady,” she said, “the countenance you have deigned to show me will long
dwell in my remembrance. there reigns in it gentleness and goodness; and
if a tinge of the world’s pride or vanities may mix with an expression
so lovely, how should we chide that which is of earth for bearing some

art swells when i think of torquilstone and the lists of
templestowe.--farewell. one, the most trifling part of my duty, remains
undischarged. accept this casket--startle not at its contents.”

rowena opened the small silver-chased casket, and perceived a carcanet,
or neck lace, with ear-jewels, of diamonds, which were obviously of
immense value.

“it is impossible,” she said, tendering back the casket. “i dare not
accept a gift of such consequence.”

“yet keep it, lady,” returned rebecca.--“you have power, rank, command,
influence; we have wealth, the source both of our strength and weakness;
the value of these toys, ten times multiplied, would not influence half
so much as your slightest wish. to you, therefore, the gift is of little
value,--and to me, what i part with is of much less. let me not think
you deem so wretchedly ill of my nation as your commons believe. think
ye that i prize these sparkling fragments of stone above my liberty?
or that my father values them in co

mparison to the honour of his only
child? accept them, lady--to me they are valueless. i will never wear
jewels more.”

“you are then unhappy!” said rowena, struck with the manner in which
rebecca uttered the last words. “o, remain with us--the counsel of holy
men will wean you from your erring law, and i will be a sister to you.”

“no, lady,” answered rebecca, the same calm melancholy reigning in her
soft voice and beautiful features--“that--may not be. i may not change
the faith of my fathers like a garment unsuited to the climate in
which i seek to dwell, and unhappy, lady, i will not be. he, to whom i
dedicate my future life, will be my comforter, if i do his will.”

“have you then convents, to one of which you mean to retire?” asked
rowena.

“no, lady,” said the jewess; “but among our people, since the time of
abraham downwards, ha

ve been women who have devoted their thoughts to
heaven, and their actions to works of kindness to men, tending the
sick, feeding the hungry, and relieving the distressed. among these will
rebecca be numbered. say this to thy lord, should he chance to enquire
after the fate of her whose life he saved.”

there was an involuntary tremour on rebecca’s voice, and a tenderness
of accent, which perhaps betrayed more than she would willingly have
expressed. she hastened to bid rowena adieu.

“farewell,” she said. “may he, who made both jew and christian, shower
down on you his choicest blessings! the bark that waits us hence will be
under weigh ere we can reach the port.”

she glided from the apartment, leaving rowena surprised as if a vision
had passed before her. the fair saxon related the singular conference to
her husband, on who

se mind it made a deep impression. he lived long and
happily with rowena, for they were attached to each other by the
bonds of early affection, and they loved each other the more, from the
recollection of the obstacles which had impeded their union. yet it
would be enquiring too curiously to ask, whether the recollection
of rebecca’s beauty and magnanimity did not recur to his mind more
frequently than the fair descendant of alfred might altogether have
approved.

ivanhoe distinguished himself in the service of richard, and was graced
with farther marks of the royal favour. he might have risen still
higher, but for the premature death of the heroic coeur-de-lion, before
the castle of chaluz, near limoges. with the life of a generous, but
rash and romantic monarch, perished all the projects which his ambition
and his gen
