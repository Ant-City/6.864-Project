the sea - its deep warm blue mornings spent lying out on the sands - hugo - 
hugo who had said he loved her... 

she must not think of hugo... 

she opened her eyes and frowned across at the man opposite her. a tall man with 
a brown face, light eyes set rather close together and an arrogant almost cruel 
mouth. 

she thought to herself: 

"i bet he's been to some interesting parts of the world and seen some interesting 
things..."

philip lombard, summing up the girl opposite in a mere flash of his quick 
moving eyes thought to himself: 

"quite attractive - a bit schoolmistressy perhaps..." 

a cool customer, he should imagine - and one who could hold her own - in love or 
war. he'd rather like to take her on... 

he frowned. no, cut out all that kind of stuff. this was business. he'd got to keep 
his mind on the job. 



what exactly was up, he wondered? that little jew had been damned mysterious.

mr. blore was in the slow train from plymouth. there was only one other person 
in his carriage, an elderly seafaring gentleman with a bleary eye. at the present 
moment he had dropped off to sleep. 

mr. blore was writing carefully in a little notebook. 



"that's the lot," he muttered to himself. "emily brent, vera claythorne, dr. 
armstrong, anthony marston, old justice wargrave, philip lombard, general 
macarthur, c.m.g., d.s.o. manservant and wife: mr. and mrs. rogers." 

he closed the notebook and put it back in his pocket. he glanced over at the 
corner and the slumbering man. 

"had one over the eight." diagnosed mr. blore accurately. he went over things 
carefully and conscientiously in his mind. 



"job ought to be easy enough," he ruminated. "don't see how i can slip up on it. 
hope i look all right." 

he stood up and scrutinized himself anxiously in the glass. the face refl

and voice had that slight suggestion of command in it that comes from having 
occupied a position of authority. she might have been directing which tennis sets 
the girls were to play in. 



miss brent said stiffly, "thank you," bent her head and entered one of the taxis, 
the door of which the driver was holding open. 

mr. justice wargrave followed her. 

captain lombard said: 

"i'll wait with miss -" 

"claythorne," said vera. 

"my name is lombard, philip lombard." 

the porters were piling luggage on the taxi. inside, mr. justice wargrave said 
with due legal caution: 

"beautiful weather we are having." 

miss brent said: 

"yes, indeed." 

a very distinguished old gentleman, she thought to herself. quite unlike the 
usual type of man in seaside guest houses. evidently mrs. or miss oliver had 
good connections... 

mr. justice wargrave inquired: 

"do you know this part of the world well?" 



"i have been to cornwall and to torquay, but this is my fi

the three of them got into the waiting taxi. they drove through the sleepy 
streets of little oakbridge and continued about a mile on the main plymouth 
road. then they plunged into a maze of cross country lanes, steep, green and 
narrow. 

general macarthur said: 

"don't know this part of devon at all. my little place is in east devon - just on 
the border-line of dorset." 

vera said: 

"it really is lovely here. the hills and the red earth and everything so green and 
luscious looking." 

philip lombard said critically: 



"it's a bit shut in... i like open country myself. where you can see what's 
coming..." 

general macarthur said to him: 



"you've seen a bit of the world, i fancy?" 

lombard shrugged his shoulders disparagingly. 

"i've knocked about here and there, sir." 

he thought to himself: "he'll ask me now if i was old enough to be in the war. 
these old boys always do." 

but general macarthur did not mention the war.

the party got up. their guide led them along a small stone jetty. alongside it a 
motor boat was lying. 

emily brent said: 

"that's a very small boat." 

the boat's owner said persuasively: 



"she's a fine boat, that, ma'am. you could go to plymouth in her as easy as 
winking." 

mr. justice wargrave said sharply: 

"there are a good many of us." 

"she'd take double the number, sir." 

philip lombard said in his pleasant easy voice: 

"it's quite all right. glorious weather - no swell." 

rather doubtfully, miss brent permitted herself to be helped into the boat. the 
others followed suit. there was as yet no fraternizing among the party. it was as 
though each member of it was puzzled by the other members. 

they were just about to cast loose when their guide paused, boat-hook in hand.

the boat churned its way round the rock. now at last the house came into view. 
the south side of the island was quite different it shelved gently down to the sea. 



the house was there facing south - low and square and modern-looking with 
rounded windows letting in all the light. 

an exciting house - a house that lived up to expectation! 

fred narracott shut off the engine, they nosed their way gently into a little 
natural inlet between rocks. 

philip lombard said sharply: 

"must be difficult to land here in dirty weather." 

fred narracott said cheerfully: 



"can't land on indian island when there's a southeasterly. sometimes 'tis cut off 
for a week or more." 

vera claythorne thought: 

"the catering must be very difficult. that's the worst of an island. all the 
domestic problems are so worrying." 

the boat grated against the rocks. fred narracott jumped out and he and 
lombard helped the others to alight. narracott made the boat fast to a r

general macarthur was frowning to himself. damn it all, the whole thing was 
deuced odd! not at all what he'd been led to expect... 

for two pins he'd make an excuse and get away... throw up the whole business... 

but the motor boat had gone back to the mainland. 

he'd have to stay. 

that fellow lombard now, he was a queer chap. 

not straight. he'd swear the man wasn't straight.

as the gong sounded, philip lombard came out of his room and walked to the 
head of the stairs. he moved like a panther, smoothly and noiselessly. there was 
something of the panther about him altogether. a beast of prey - pleasant to the 
eye. 



he was smiling to himself.

he was going to enjoy that week.

her bible.

general macarthur sat down. his shaking hand pulled at his moustache. the

lombard spoke. his eyes were amused. he said: 

"about those natives -" 

marston said: 

"what about them?" 

philip lombard grinned. 

"story's quite true! i left 'em! matter of self-preservation. we were lost in the

when the gong sounded for breakfast at nine o'clock it found every one up and 
awaiting the summons. 

general macarthur and the judge had been pacing the terrace outside, 
exchanging desultory comments on the political situation. 

vera claythorne and philip lombard had been up to the summit of the island 
behind the house. there they had discovered william henry blore, standing 
staring at the mainland. 

he said: 

"no sign of that motor boat yet. i've been watching for it." 

vera said, smiling: 

"devon's a sleepy county. things are usually late." 

philip lombard was looking the other way, out to sea. 

he said abruptly: 

"what d'you think of the weather?" 

glancing up at the sky, blore remarked: 

"looks all right to me." 

lombard pursed up his mo

blore said: 

"squally - eh?" 

from below them came the boom of a gong. 

philip lombard said: 

"breakfast? well, i could do with some." 

as they went down the steep slope blore said to lombard in a ruminating voice: 

"you know, it beats me - why that young fellow wanted to do himself in! i've been 
worrying about it all night." 

vera was a little ahead. lombard hung back slightly. he said: 

"got any alternative theory?" 

"i'd want some proof. motive, to begin with. well-off i should say he was."

emily brent shrugged her shoulders. 

blore said sharply: 

"what did she have to eat and drink last night after she went up to bed?" 

armstrong said: 



"nothing." 

"she didn't take anything? a cup of tea? a drink of water? i'll bet you she had a 
cup of tea. that sort always does." 

"rogers assures me she had nothing whatsoever." 

"ah," said blore. "but he might say so!" 

his tone was so significant that the doctor looked at him sharply. 

philip lombard said: 

"so that's your idea?" 

blore said aggressively: 

"well, why not? we all heard that accusation last night. may be sheer moonshine 
- just plain lunacy! on the other hand, it may not. allow for the moment that it's 
true. rogers and his missus polished off that old lady. well, where does that get

he said, looking from one to the other: 

"is there anything more i can get you? i'm sorry there was so little toast, but 
we've run right out of bread. the new bread hasn't come over from the mainland 
yet." 

mr. justice wargrave stirred a little in his chair. he asked: 

"what time does the motor boat usually come over?" 

"between seven and eight, sir. sometimes it's a bit after eight. don't know what 
fred narracott can be doing this morning. if he's ill he'd send his brother." 

philip lombard said: 



"what's the time now?" 

"ten minutes to ten, sir." 

lombard's eyebrows rose. he nodded slowly to himself. 

rogers waited a minute or two. 



general macarthur spoke suddenly and explosively. 

"sorry to hear about your wife, rogers. doctor's just been telling us." 

rogers inclined his head. 

"yes, sir. thank you, sir." 

he took up the empty bacon dish and went out. 

again there was silence.

blore nodded his head. 

he said: 

"i know what you're thinking, mr. lombard. i've asked myself the same question. 
motor boat ought to have been here nigh on two hours ago. it hasn't come? why?" 

"found the answer?" asked lombard. 



"it's not an accident - that's what i say. it's part and parcel of the whole business. 
it's all bound up together." 

philip lombard said: 

"it won't come, you think?" 

a voice spoke behind him - a testy impatient voice. 

"the motor boat's not coming," he said. 

blore turned his square shoulder slightly and viewed the last speaker 
thoughtfully. 

"you think not too, general?" 

general macarthur said sharply: 

"of course it won't come. we're counting on the motor boat to take us off the 
island. that's the meaning of the whole business. we're not going to leave the 
island... none of us will ever leave... il's the end,

ed, then he said in a low strange voice: 



"that's peace - real peace. to come to the end - not to have to go on... yes, 
peace..." 

he turned abruptly and walked away. along the terrace, then down the slope 
towards the sea - obliquely - to the end of the island where loose rocks went out 
into the water. 



he walked a little unsteadily, like a man who was only half awake. 

blore said: 

"there goes another one who's balmy! looks as though it'll end with the whole lot 
going that way." 

philip lombard said: 

"i don't fancy you will, blore." 

the ex-inspector laughed. 

"it would take a lot to send me off my head." he added drily: "and i don't think 
you'll be going that way either, mr. lombard." 

philip lombard said: 

"i feel quite sane at the minute, thank you." 



iv 

dr. armstrong came out onto the terrace. he stood there hesitating. to his left 
were blore and lombard. to his right was wargrave, slowly pacing up and down, 
his head bent down. 

armstrong, after a moment of indecisi

said: 



"my dear fellow, i've no medical knowledge." 

"no, no, i mean as to the general situation." 

"oh, that's different." 

armstrong said: 

"frankly, what do you think of the position?" 

lombard reflected a minute. then he said: 

"it's rather suggestive, isn't it?" 

"what are your ideas on the subject of that woman? do you accept blore's 
theory?" 

philip puffed smoke into the air. he said: 

"it's perfectly feasible - taken alone." 

"exactly." 

armstrong's tone sounded relieved. philip lombard was no fool. 

the latter went on: 

"that is, accepting the premise that mr. and mrs. rogers have successfully got 
away with murder in their time. and i don't see why they shouldn't. what do you 
think they did exactly? poisoned the old lady?" 



armstrong said slowly: 

"it might be simpler than that. i asked rogers this morning what this miss 
brady had suffered from. his answer was enlightening. i don't need to go into 
medical details, but in a certain form of cardiac trouble, amyl nitri

if amyl nitrite were withheld - well, the consequences might easily be fatal." 

philip lombard said thoughtfully: 

"as simple as that. it must have been - rather tempting." 

the doctor nodded. 

"yes, no positive action. no arsenic to obtain and administer - nothing definite - 
just - negation! and rogers hurried through the night to fetch a doctor and they 
both felt confident that no one could ever know." 

"and, even if any one knew, nothing could ever be proved against them," added 
philip lombard. 

he frowned suddenly. 

"of course - that explains a good deal." 

armstrong said, 
 
 ___________________________
 
puzzled: 

"i beg your pardon." 

lombard said: 



"i mean - it explains indian island. there are crimes that cannot be brought 
home to their perpetrators. instance, the rogerses'. another instance, old 
wargrave, who committed his murder strictly within the law." 

armstrong said sharply: 

"you believe that story?" 

philip lombard smiled. 

"oh, yes, i believe it. wargrave murdered edward seton all right, murdered him 
as surely as if he'd stuck a stiletto through him! but he was clever enough to do it 
from the judge's seat in wig and gown. so in the ordinary way you can't bring his 
little crime home to him." 

a sudden flash passed like lightning through armstrong's mind. 

"murder in hospital. murder on the operating table. safe - yes, safe as houses!" 

philip lombard was saying: 

"hence - mr. owen - hence - indian

armstrong drew a deep breath. 

"now we're getting down to it. what's the real purpose of getting us all here?" 

philip lombard said: 

"what do you think?" 



armstrong said abruptly: 



"let's go back a minute to this woman's death. what are the possible theories? 
rogers killed her because he was afraid she would give the show away. second 
possibility: she lost her nerve and took an easy way out herself." 

philip lombard said: 

"suicide, eh?" 

"what do you say to that?" 

lombard said: 

"it could have been - yes - if it hadn't been for marston's death. two suicides 
within twelve hours is a little too much to swallow! and if you tell me that 
anthony marston, a young bull with no nerves and precious little brains, got the 
wind up over having mowed down a couple of kids and deliberately put himself 
out of the way - well, the idea's laughable! and anyway, how did he get hold of

armstrong said: 

"nobody in their senses carries potassium cyanide. it might be done by some one 
who was going to take a wasps' nest." 

"the ardent gardener or landowner, in fact? again, not anthony marston. it 
strikes me that cyanide is going to need a bit of explaining. either anthony 
marston meant to do away with himself before he came here, and therefore came 
prepared - or else -" 



armstrong prompted him. 



'or else?" 



philip lombard grinned. 



"why make me say it? when it's on the tip of your own tongue. anthony marston 
was murdered, of course." 



ill 

dr. armstrong drew a deep breath. 

"and mrs. rogers?" 

lombard said slowly: 

"i could believe in anthony's suicide (with difficulty) if it weren't for mrs. rogers. 
i could believe in mrs. rogers' suicide (easily) if it weren't for anthony marston. i 
can believe that rogers put his wife out of the way - if it were not for the

the two little china figures. 



lombard said:

and now there are eight, you say?" 

dr. armstrong recited: 



"ten little indian boys going out to dine; 



one went and choked himself and then there were nine. 



"nine little indian boys sat up very late; 

one overslept himself and then there were eight." 



the two men looked at each other. philip lombard grinned and flung away his 
cigarette. 

"fits too damned well to be a coincidence! anthony marston dies of asphyxiation 
or choking last night after dinner, and mother rogers oversleeps herself with a 
vengeance." 

"and therefore?" said armstrong. 

lombard took him up. 



"and therefore another kind of puzzle. the nigger in the woodpile! x! mr. owen!

philip lombard nodded. 

he said: 

"no motor boat this morning. that fits in. mr. owen's little arrangements again 
to the fore. indian island is to be isolated until mr. owen has finished his job." 

armstrong had gone pale. he said: 

"you realize - the man must be a raving maniac!" 

philip lombard said, and there was a new ring in his voice: 

"there's one thing mr. owen didn't realize."

he paused and said:

think they'd believe that?" 

dr. armstrong said:

philip lombard, his lips curling back from his teeth, said:

he said:

"i doubt it. it's pretty sheer. and where could he hide?" 

blore said:

then turned their attention to the building itself. mrs. rogers' yard measure 
discovered in the kitchen dresser assisted them. but there were no hidden spaces 
left unaccounted for. everything was plain and straightforward, a modern 
structure devoid of concealments. they went through the ground floor first. as 
they mounted to the bedroom floor, they saw through the landing window rogers 
carrying out a tray of cocktails to the terrace. 

philip lombard said lightly: 

"wonderful animal, the good servant. carries on with an impassive

they turned in to the first bedroom.

lombard said doubtfully:

blore snorted, unconvinced. 

"damned queer sort of accident," he grunted. 

there was a pause, then blore said:

"mrs. rogers?" 

"yes. it's possible, isn't it, that that might have been an accident?" 

philip lombard said:

blore looked slightly embarrassed. his red-brick face grew a little deeper in hue. 
he said, almost blurting out the words: 

"look here, doctor, you did give her some dope, you know." 

armstrong stared at him. 



"dope? what do you mean?" 

"last night. you said yourself you'd give her something to make her sleep."

"it's possible, isn't it, that you may have made a mistake? these things do

a cold biting tone: "or do you suggest that i gave her an overdose on purpose?"

uation. this morning 
wargrave had sat huddled in his chair on the terrace refraining from any overt 
activity. now he assumed command with the ease born of a long habit of 
authority. he definitely presided over the court. 

clearing his throat, he once more spoke. 

"this morning, gentlemen, whilst i was sitting on the terrace. i was an observer 
of your activities. there could be little doubt of your purpose. you were searching 
the island for an unknown murderer?" 

"quite right, sir," said philip lombard. 

the judge went on. 



"you had come, doubtless, to the same conclusion that i had - namely that the 
deaths of anthony marston and mrs. rogers were neither accidental nor were 
they suicides. no doubt you also reached a certain conclusion as to the purpose of 
mr. owen in enticing us to this island?" 

blore said hoarsely: 

"he's a madman! a loony." 

the judge coughed. 

"that almost certainly. but it hardly affects the issue. our main preoccupation is 
this - to save our lives."

vera murmured: 



"i can't believe it... i can't..." 

wargrave said: 

"lombard?" 

"i agree, sir, absolutely." 

the judge nodded his head in a satisfied manner. he said: 

"now let us examine the evidence. to begin with, is there any reason for 
suspecting one particular person? mr. blore, you have, i think, something to say." 

blore was breathing hard. he said: 

"lombard's got a revolver. he didn't tell the truth - last night. he admits it." 

philip lombard smiled scornfully. 



he said: 

"i suppose i'd better explain again." 

he did so, telling the story briefly and succinctly. 

blore said sharply: 

"what's to prove it? there's nothing to corroborate your story." 

the judge coughed. 

"unfortunately," he said, "we are all in that position. there is only our own word 
to go upon." 

he leaned forward. 

"you have none of you yet grasped what a very peculiar situation this is. to my 
mind there is only one course of procedure to adopt. is the

have swallowed it obediently without thinking twice about it?" 

there was a silence. blore shifted his feet and frowned. philip lombard said: 

"i don't believe in that story for a minute. besides none of us left this room for 
hours afterwards. there was marston's death and all the rest of it." 

the judge said: 

"some one could have left his or her bedroom - later." 



lombard objected: 

"but then rogers would have been up there." 

dr. armstrong stirred. 



"no," he said. "rogers went downstairs to clear up in the dining-room and pantry. 
any one could have gone up to the woman's bedroom then without being seen."

armstrong said hotly: 

"certainly. that is, lombard went off for a few minutes. i remained where i 
was." 

lombard said with a smile: 

"i wanted to test the possibilities of heliographing to the mainland. wanted to 
find the best spot. i was only absent a minute or two." 

armstrong nodded. he said: 

"that's right. not long enough to do a murder, i assure you." 

the judge said: 

"did either of you two glance at your watches?" 

"well, no." 

philip lombard said: 

"i wasn't wearing one." 

the judge said evenly: 



"a minute or two is a vague expression." 

he turned his head to the upright figure with the knitting lying on her lap. 

"miss brent?" 

emily brent said: 

"i took a walk with miss claythorne up to the top of the island. afterwards i sat 
on the terrace in the sun." 

the judge said: 

"i don't think i noticed you there."

"i would ask you all to consider this carefully and to give me any suggestions that

so far the murderer has had an easy task, since his victims have been 
unsuspicious. from now on, it is our task to suspect each and every one amongst 
us. forewarned is forearmed. take no risks and be alert to danger. that is all." 

philip lombard murmured beneath his breath: 

"the court will now adjourn..."

"do you believe it?" vera asked. 

she and philip lombard sat on the windowsill of the living-room. outside the 
rain poured down and the wind howled in great shuddering gusts against the 
window-panes. 

philip lombard cocked his head slightly on one side before answering. then he 
said: 

"you mean, do i believe that old wargrave is right when he says it's one of us?" 



"yes." 



philip lombard said slowly: 

 
 ___________________________
 

"it's difficult to say. logically, you know, he's right, and yet -" 

vera took the words out of his mouth. 

"and yet it seems so incredible!" 

philip lombard made a grimace. 

"the whole thing's incredible! but after macarthur's death there's no more doubt 
as to one thing. there's no question now of accidents or suicides. it's definitely 
murder. three murders up to date." 

vera shivered. she said: 

"it's like some awful dream. i keep feeling that things like this can't happen!" 

he said with understanding: 

"i know. presently a tap will come on the door, and early morning tea will be 
brought in." 

vera said: 

"oh, how i wish that could happ

en!" 

philip lombard said gravely: 

"yes, but it won't! we're all in the dream! and we've got to be pretty much upon 
our guard from now on." 



vera said, lowering her voice: 

"if- if it is one of them - which do you think it is?" 

philip lombard grinned suddenly. he said: 

"i take it you are excepting our two selves? well, that's all right. i know very well 
that i'm not the murderer, and i don't fancy that there's anything insane about 
you, vera. you strike me as being one of the sanest and most level-headed girls 
i've come across. i'd stake my reputation on your sanity." 

with a slightly wry smile, vera said: 

"thank you." 

he said: 

"come now, miss vera claythorne, aren't you going to return the compliment?" 

vera hesitated 
 
 ___________________________
 


"the doctor, eh? you know, i should have put him last of all." 

vera shook her head. 



"oh, no! two of the deaths have been poison. that rather points to a doctor. and 
then you can't get over the fact that the only thing we are absolutely certain mrs. 
rogers had was the sleeping draught that he gave her." 

lombard admitted: 

"yes, that's true." 

vera persisted: 

"if a doctor went mad, it would be a long time before any one suspected. and 
doctors overwork and have a lot of strain." 

philip lombard said: 

"yes but i doubt if he could have killed macarthur. he wouldn't have had time 
during that brief interval when i left him - not, that is, unless he fairly hared 
down there and back again, and i doubt if he's in good enough training to do that 
and show no signs of it." 

vera said: 

"he didn't do it then. he had an opportunity later." 

"when?" 

"when he went down to call the general to lunch." 

philip whistled again very softly. he said: 

"so you think he did it then? pretty cool

the elder woman replied: 

"no, you do it, dear. that tea-pot is so heavy. and i have lost two skeins of my

vera moved to the tea-table. there was a cheerful rattle and clink of china. 
normality returned. 

tea! blessed ordinary everyday afternoon tea! philip lombard made a cheery 
remark. blore responded. dr. armstrong told a humorous story. mr. justice 
wargrave, who ordinarily hated tea, sipped approvingly. 



into this relaxed atmosphere came rogers. 

and rogers was upset. he said nervously and at random: 

"excuse me, sir, but does any one know what's become of the bathroom curtain?" 

lombard's head went up with a jerk. 

"the bathroom curtain? what the devil do you mean, rogers?" 

"it's gone, sir, clean vanished. i was going round drawing all the

then, extinguishing the lights, he hurried up the stairs and into his new 
bedroom. 

there was only one possible hiding-place in it, the tall wardrobe, and he looked 
into that immediately. then, locking and bolting the door, he prepared for bed. 

he said to himself: 

"no more indian tricks tonight i've seen to that..." 



chapter 11 



philip lombard had the habit of waking at daybreak. he did so on this particular 
morning. he raised himself on an elbow and listened. the wind had somewhat 
abated but was still blowing. he could hear no sound of rain... 

at eight o'clock the wind was blowing more strongly, but lombard did not hear it. 
he was asleep again. 

at nine-thirty he was sitting on the edge of his bed looking at his watch. he put 
it to his ear. then his lips drew back from his teeth in that curious wolf-like 
smile characteristic

 of the man. 

he said very softly: 



"i think the time has come to do something about this." 

at twenty- five minutes to ten he was tapping on the closed door of blore's room. 

the latter opened it cautiously. his hair was tousled and his eyes were still dim 
with sleep. 

philip lombard said affably: 

"sleeping the clock round? well, shows you've got an easy conscience." 

blore said shortly: 



"what's the matter?" 

lombard answered: 

"anybody called you - or brought you any tea? do you know what time it is?" 

blore looked over his shoulder at a small travelling clock by his bedside. 

he said: 

"twenty-five to ten. wouldn't have believed i could have slept like that. where's 
rogers?" 

philip lombard said: 

"it's a case of echo answers where?" 



"what d'you mean?"

asked the other sharply. 

lombard said: 

"i mean that rogers is missing. he isn't in his room or anywhere else. and 
there's no kettle on and the kitchen fire isn't even lit." 

blore swore under his breath. he said: 

"where the devil can he be? out on the island somewhere? wait till i get some 
clothes on. see if the others know anything." 

philip lombard nodded. he moved along the line of closed doors. 

he found armstrong up and nearly dressed. mr. justice wargrave, like blore, 
had to be roused from sleep. vera claythorne was dressed. emily brent's room 
was empty. 

the little party moved through the house. rogers' room, as philip lombard had 
already ascertained, was untenanted. the bed had been slept in, and his razor 
and sponge and soap were wet. 

lombard said: 

"he got up all right." 

vera said in a low voice which she tried to make

she turned and went across the yard into the kitchen saying: "miss brent and i 
are getting you breakfast. can you - bring some sticks to light the fire?" 

the marks of the doctor's hand stood out red on her cheek. 

as she went into the kitchen blore said: 

"well, you dealt with that all right, doctor." 

armstrong said apologetically: 

"had to! we can't cope with hysteria on the top of everything else." 

philip lombard said: 

"she's not a hysterical type." 

armstrong agreed. 

"oh, no. good healthy sensible girl. just the sudden shock. it might happen to 
anybody." 

rogers had chopped a certain amount of firewood before he had been killed. they 
gathered it up and took it into the kitchen. vera and emily brent were busy. 
miss brent was raking out the stove. vera was cutting the rind off the bacon. 

emily brent said:

ex-inspector blore said in a low hoarse voice to philip lombard: 

"know what i'm thinking?" 

philip lombard said: 

"as you're just about to tell me, it's not worth the trouble of guessing." 

ex-inspector blore was an earnest man. a light touch was incomprehensible to 
him. he went on heavily: 

"there was a case in america. old gentleman and his wife - both killed with an 
axe. middle of the morning. nobody in the house but the daughter and the maid.

philip lombard said laconically:

blore went on. 

"but the other! so neat and prim - wrapped up in that apron - mrs. rogers'

philip lombard sighed and said: 

"that's hardly proof positive of an unbalanced mentality, blore." 

but blore went on, ploddingly, perseveringly: 

"and then she was out - in her mackintosh, said she'd been down to look at the 
sea." 

the other shook his head. 

he said: 

"rogers was killed as he was chopping firewood - that is to say first thing when 
he got up. the brent woman wouldn't have needed to wander about outside for 
hours afterwards. if you ask me, the murderer of rogers would take jolly good

blore said: 

"you're missing the point, mr. lombard. if the woman was innocent she'd be too 
dead scared to go wandering about by herself. she'd only do that if she knew that 
she had nothing to fear. that's to say if she herself is the criminal." 

philip lombard said: 



"that's a good point... yes, i hadn't thought of that." 

he added with a faint grin: 

"glad you don't still suspect me." 

blore said rather shamefacedly: 

"i did start by thinking of you - that revolver - and the queer story you told - or 
didn't tell. but i've realized now that that was really a bit too obvious," he 
paused and said: "hope you feel the same about me." 

philip said thoughtfully:

"me?" blore stared at him. "do you think i'm going to go the way of rogers and 
the rest of them? not me! i'm watching out for myself pretty carefully, i can tell 
you." 

lombard said: 

"oh, well - i'm not a betting man. and anyway if you were dead i wouldn't get 
paid." 

"look here, mr. lombard, what do you mean?" 

philip lombard showed his teeth. he said: 

"i mean, my dear blore, that in my opinion you haven't got a chance!" 

"what?" 



"your lack of imagination is going to make you absolutely a sitting target. a 
criminal of the imagination of u.n. owen can make rings round you any time he 
- or she - wants to." 

blore's face went crimson. he demanded angrily: 

"and what about you?" 

philip lombard's face went hard and dangerous.

the meal was over. 

mr. justice wargrave cleared his throat. he said in a small authoritative voice: 

"it would be advisable, i think, if we met to discuss the situation. shall we say in 
half an hour's time in the drawing-room?" 

every one made a sound suggestive of agreement. 

vera began to pile plates together. 

she said: 

"i'll clear away and wash up." 

philip lombard said: 



"we'll bring the stuff out to the pantry for you." 

"thanks." 

emily brent, rising to her feet; sat down again. she said: 

"oh, dear." 

the judge said: 

"anything the matter, miss brent?" 

emily said apologetically: 

"i'm sorry. i'd like to help miss claythorne, but i don't know how it is. i feel just a 
little giddy." 

"giddy, eh?" dr. armstrong came towards her. "quite natural. delayed shock. i

armstrong replied: 

"i have a small medicine case here. you can examine it. you will find some 
sleeping stuff- trional and sulphonal tablets - a packet of bromide, bicarbonate of 
soda, aspirin. nothing else. i have no cyanide in my possession." 

the judge said: 

"i have, myself, some sleeping tablets - sulphonal, i think they are. i presume 
they would be lethal if a sufficiently large dose were given. you, mr. lombard, 
have in your possession a revolver." 

philip lombard said sharply: 

"what if i have?" 

"only this. i propose that the doctor's supply of drugs, my own sulphonal tablets, 
your revolver and anything else of the nature of drugs or firearms should be 
collected together and placed in a safe place. that after this is done, we should 
each of us submit to a search - both of our persons and of our effects." 



lombard said: 

"i'm damned if i'll give up my revolver!" 

wargrave said sharply:

said: 

"that's all very well, but who's to have the key? you, i suppose." 

mr. justice wargrave made no reply. 

he went down to the pantry and the others followed him. there was a small case 
there designed for the purpose of holding silver and plate. by the judge's 
directions, the various drugs were placed in this and it was locked. then, still on 
wargrave's instructions, the chest was lifted into the plate cupboard and this in 
turn was locked. the judge then gave the key of the chest to philip lombard and 
the key of the cupboard to blore. 



he said: 

"you two are the strongest physically. it would be difficult for either of you to get 
the key from the other. it would be impossible for any of us three to do so. to 
break open the cupboard - or the plate chest - would be a noisy and cumbrous 
proceeding and one which could hardly be carried out without attention being 
attracted to what was going on." 

he paused, then went on: 

"we are still faced by one very grave problem. what has bec

blore said:

a white dint showed in philip lombard's nostrils. he said: 

"you damned pig-headed fool! i tell you it's been stolen from me!" 

wargrave asked: 

"when did you see it last?" 

"last night. it was in the drawer when i went to bed - ready in case anything 
happened." 

the judge nodded. 

he said: 



"it must have been taken this morning during the confusion of searching for 
rogers or after his dead body was discovered." 

vera said: 

"it must be hidden somewhere about the house. we must look for it." 

mr. justice wargrave's fi

tual instinct of self-preservation. 

and all of them, suddenly, looked less like human beings. they were reverted to 
more bestial types. like a wary old tortoise, mr. justice wargrave sat hunched 
up, his body motionless, his eyes keen and alert. ex-inspector blore looked 



coarser and clumsier in build. his walk was that of a slow padding animal. his 
eyes were bloodshot. there was a look of mingled ferocity and stupidity about 
him. he was like a beast at bay ready to charge its pursuers. philip lombard's 
senses seemed heightened, rather than diminished. his ears reacted to the 
slightest sound. his step was lighter and quicker, his body was lithe and 
graceful. and he smiled often, his lips curling back from his long white teeth. 

vera claythorne was very quiet. she sat most of the time huddled in a chair. her 
eyes stared ahead of her into space. she looked dazed. she was like a bird that 
has dashed its head against glass and that has been picked up by a human hand.

he thrust the sealed bottle under vera's nose. 

"there you are, my girl. absolutely no deception." he peeled off the tin foil and 
drew the cork. "lucky there's a good supply of spirits in the house. thoughtful of 
u.n. owen." 

vera shuddered violently. 

armstrong held the glass while philip poured the brandy into it. he said: 

"you'd better drink this, miss claythorne. you've had a nasty shock." 

vera drank a little of the spirit. the colour came back to her face. 

philip lombard said with a laugh: 

"well, here's one murder that hasn't gone according to plan!" 

vera said almost in a whisper: 

"you think - that was what was meant?" 



lombard nodded. 

"expected you to pass out through fright! some people would have, wouldn't they, 
doctor?" 

armstrong did not commit himself. he said doubtfully: 

"h'm, impossible to say. young healthy subject - no cardiac weakness. unlikely. 
on the other hand -" 

he picked up the glass of brandy that blore had brought. he dipped

he said - and his voice was expressionless, dead, far away: 

"he's been shot... " 

blore said: 

"god - the revolver!" 

the doctor said, still in the same lifeless voice: 

"got him through the head. instantaneous." 

vera stooped to the wig. she said, and her voice shook with terror: 

"miss brent's missing grey wool..." 



blore said: 

"and the scarlet curtain that was missing from the bathroom..." 

vera whispered: 

"so this is what they wanted them for..." 

suddenly philip lombard laughed - a high unnatural laugh. 

'"five little indian boys going in for law; one got in chancery and then there were 
four.' that's the end of mr. bloody justice wargrave. no more pronouncing 
sentence for him! no more putting on of the black cap! here's the last time he'll 
ever sit in court! no more summing up and sending innocent men to death. how 
edward seton would laugh if he were here! god, how he'd laugh!" 

his outburst shocked and startled the others.

they had carried mr. justice wargrave up to his room and laid him on the bed. 

then they had come down again and had stood in the hall looking at each other. 

blore said heavily:

blore said: 

"he probably will." 



there was an unpleasant tone in his voice. the two men eyed each other. 

armstrong said: 

"four of us, and we don't know which..." 

blore said: 

"i know..." 

vera said: 

"i haven't the least doubt..." 

armstrong said slowly: 

"i suppose i do know really..." 

philip lombard said: 

"i think i've got a pretty good idea now..." 

again they all looked at each other... 

vera staggered to her feet. she said: 

"i feel awful. i must go to bed... i'm dead beat." 

lombard said: 

"might as well. no good sitting watching each other." 



blore said: 

"i've no objection..." 

the doctor murmured: 

"the best thing to do - although i doubt if any of us will sleep." 

they moved to the door. blore said: 

"i wonder where that revolver is now?..."

they went up t

he stairs. 

the next move was a little like a scene in a farce. 

each one of the four stood with a hand on his or her bedroom door handle. then, 
as though at a signal, each one stepped into the room and pulled the door shut. 
there were sounds of bolts and locks, of the moving of furniture. 

four frightened people were barricaded in until morning.

philip lombard drew a breath of relief as he turned from adjusting a chair under 
the door handle. 



he strolled across to the dressing-table. 

by the light of the flickering candle he studied his face curiously. 

he said softly to himself: 

"yes, this business has got you rattled all right." 

his sudden wolf-like smile flashed out. 

he undressed quickly. 

he went over to the bed, placing his wrist-watch on the table by the bed. 

then he opened the drawer of the table. 

he stood there, staring down

again, he had nearly made a fool of himself! this was a trap, perhaps, to 
lure him out of the house! 

but what the other man didn't realize was that he had made a mistake, had 
delivered himself neatly into blore's hands. 

for, of the three tenanted rooms upstairs, one must now be empty. all that had 
to be done was to ascertain which! 

blore went swiftly back along the corridor. 

he paused first at dr. armstrong's door and tapped. there was no answer. 

he waited a minute, then went on to philip lombard's room. 

here the answer came at once. 



"who's there?" 

"it's blore. i don't think armstrong is in his room. wait a minute." 

he went on to the door at the end of the corridor. here he tapped again. 

"miss claythorne. miss claythorne." 

vera's voice, startled, answered him: 



"who is it? what's the matter?" 

"it's all right, miss claythorne. wait a minute. i'll come back." 

he raced back to lombard's room. the door opened as he did so. lombard stood

he joined blore. he said: 

"and now - after him! the hunt's up!" 

blore said: 

"we'd better be careful. he's got a revolver, remember." 

philip lombard raced down the stairs chuckling. 

he said: 



"that's where you're wrong." he undid the front door, remarking: "latch pushed 
back - so that he could get in again easily." 

he went on: 

"i've got that revolver!" he took it half out of his pocket as he spoke. "found it

blore stopped dead on the doorstep. his face changed. philip lombard saw it. 

he said impatiently: 

"don't be a damned fool, blore! i'm not going to shoot you! go back and barricade 
yourse

blore said: 



"look here, mr. lombard, if you're an honest man, as you pretend -" 



philip murmured: 

"when did i lay claims to being an honest man? no, indeed, i never said that." 

blore went on stolidly: 

"if you're speaking the truth - there's only one thing to be done. as long as you 
have that revolver, miss claythorne and i are at your mercy. the only fair thing 
is to put that revolver with the other things that are locked up - and you and i 
will hold the two keys still." 

philip lombard lit a cigarette. 

as he puffed smoke, he said: 

"don't be an ass." 

"you won't agree to that?" 

"no, i won't. that revolver's mine. i need it to defend myself - and i'm going to 
keep it." 

blore said: 

"in that case we're bound to come to one conclusion." 

"that i'm u.n. owen? think what you damned well please. but i'll ask you, if 
that's so, why i didn't pot you with the revolver last night? i could have, about 
twenty times over." 



blore shook his head. 



he said: 



"i don't k

 armstrong all right. but where the devil did he hide himself? 
we went over the place with a fine-tooth comb." 



vera said urgently: 

"if you didn't find him last night, you won't find him now... that's common- 
sense." 

lombard said reluctantly: 

"yes, but -" 

"he must have prepared a secret place beforehand - naturally - of course it's just 
what he would do. you know, like a priest's hole in old manor houses." 

"this isn't an old house of that kind." 

"he could have had one made." 

philip lombard shook his head. 

he said: 

"we measured the place - that first morning. i'll swear there's no space 
unaccounted for." 

vera said: 

"there must be..." 

lombard said: 

"i'd like to see -" 



vera cried: 

"yes, you'd like to see! and he knows that! he's in there - waiting for you." 

lombard said, half bringing out the revolver from his pocket: 

"i've got this, you know." 

"you said blore was all right - that he was more than a match for armstrong. so 
he was physically, and he was on t

he lookout too. but what you don't seem to 
realize is that armstrong is mad! and a madman has all the advantages on his 
side. he's twice as cunning as any one sane can be." 

lombard put back the revolver in his pocket. he said: 

"come on, then."

lombard said at last: 

"what are we going to do when night comes?" 

vera didn't answer. he went on accusingly: 

"you haven't thought of that?" 

she said helplessly: 

"what can we do? oh, my god, i'm frightened..." 



philip lombard said thoughtfully: 

"it's fine weather. there will be a moon. we must find a place - up by the top 
cliffs perhaps. we can sit there and wait for morning. we mustn't go to sleep... 
we must watch the whole time. and if any one comes up towards us, i shall 
shoot!" 

he paused: 

"you'll be cold, perhaps, in that thin dress?" 

vera said with a raucous laugh: 

"cold? i should be colder if i were dead!" 

philip lombard said quietly: 

"yes, that's true..." 

vera moved restlessly. 

she said:

 two rocks, flung there by the tide earlier in the 
day. 



lombard and vera reached it in a last scramble. they bent down. 
a purple discoloured face - a hideous drowned face... 
lombard said: 
"my god! it's armstrong..." 



chapter 16 



aeons passed... worlds span and whirled... time was motionless... it stood still - 
it passed through a thousand ages... 

no, it was only a minute or so... 

two people were standing looking down on a dead man... 

slowly, very slowly, vera claythorne and philip lombard lifted their heads and 
looked into each other's eyes...

lombard laughed. 



he said: 



"so that's it, is it, vera?" 



vera said: 



"there's no one on the island - no one at all - except us two..." 

her voice was a whisper - nothing more. 

lombard said: 

"precisely. so we know where we are, don't we?" 

vera said: 

"how was it worked - that trick with the marble bear?" 

he shrugged his shoulders. 

"a conjuring trick, my dear - a very good one..." 

their eyes met again.

wever, drawing the body clear of the high water mark. 

lombard said as he straightened up: 

"satisfied?" 

vera said: 

"quite." 



her tone warned him. he spun around. even as he clapped his hand to his pocket 
he knew that he would find it empty. 

she had moved a yard or two and was facing him, revolver in hand. 

lombard said: 

"so that's the reason for your womanly solicitude! you wanted to pick my pocket." 

she nodded. 

she held it steadily and unwaveringly. 

death was very near to philip lombard now. it had never, he knew, been nearer. 

nevertheless he was not beaten yet. 

he said authoritatively: 

"give that revolver to me." 

vera laughed. 

lombard said: 

"come on, hand it over." 

his quick brain was working. which way - which method - talk her over - lull her 
into security - or a swift dash - 



all his life lombard had taken the risky way. he took it now. 

he spoke slowly, argumentatively. 

"now look here, my dear girl, you just listen -" 

and then he sprang. quick as a

automatically vera pressed the trigger... 

lombard's leaping body stayed poised in mid-spring, then crashed heavily to the 
ground. 

vera came warily forward, the revolver ready in her hand. 

but there was no need of caution. 

philip lombard was dead - shot through the heart...

relief possessed vera - enormous exquisite relief. 



at last it was over. 



there was no more fear - no more steeling of her nerves. 



she was alone on the island... 



alone with nine dead bodies... 



but what did that matter? she was alive. 



she sat there - exquisitely happy - exquisitely at peace. 



no more fear...

him and he was let off with a fine. 

"can't find anything definite about general macarthur. fine record - war service 

- all the rest of it. arthur richmond was serving under him in france and was 
killed in action. no friction of any kind between him and the general. they were 
close friends, as a matter of fact. there were some blunders made about that time 

- commanding officers sacrificed men unnecessarily - possibly this was a blunder 
of that kind." 

"possibly," said the a.c. 

"now, philip lombard. lombard has been mixed up in some very curious shows 
abroad. he's sailed very near the law once or twice. got a reputation for daring 
and for not being over-scrupulous. sort of fellow who might do several murders in 
some quiet out-of-the-way spot. 

"then we come to blore." maine hesitated. "he of course was one of our lot." 

the other man stirred. 



"blore," said the assistant commissioner forcibly, "was a bad hat!" 

"you think so, sir?" 

the a.c. said: 

"i always thought so. but he

lombard, blore and vera claythorne. lombard was shot. his body was down by 
the sea - near armstrong's. vera claythorne was found hanged in her own 
bedroom. blore's body was on the terrace. his head was crushed in by a heavy 
marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window 
above." 

the a.c. said sharply: 

"whose window?" 

"vera claythorne's. now, sir, let's take each of these cases separately. first 
philip lombard. let's say he pushed over that lump of marble onto blore - then 



he doped vera claythorne and strung her up. lastly, he went down to the 
seashore and shot himself. 

"but if so, woo took away the revolver from him? for that revolver was found up 
in the house just inside the door at the top of the stairs - wargrave's room." 

the a.c. said: 

"any fingerprints on it?" 

"yes, sir, vera claythorne's." 

"but, man alive, then -"

a conversation between two old military gossips in my club put me on the track
