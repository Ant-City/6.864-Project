the staircase stands_ lady chiltern, _a woman of grave greek beauty_,

lord caversham.  hum!  which is goring?  beautiful idiot, or the other
thing?

mabel chiltern.  [_gravely_.]  i have been obliged for the present to put
lord goring into a class quite by himself.  but he is developing
charmingly!

lord caversham.  into what?

mabel chiltern.  [_with a little curtsey_.]  i hope to let you know very
soon, lord caversham!

mason.  [_announcing guests_.]  lady markby.  mrs. cheveley.

_kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair Ã  la marquise and good lace_.
mrs. cheveley, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather slight_.  _lips
very thin and highly-coloured_, _a line of scarlet on a pallid face_.

that move restlessly_.  _she is in heliotrope_, _with diamonds_.  _she

lady markby.  good evening, dear gertrude!  so kind of you to let me
bring my friend, mrs. cheveley.  two such charming women should know each
other!

lady chiltern.  [_advances towards_ mrs. cheveley _with a sweet smile_.
_then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather distantly_.]  i think mrs.
cheveley and i have met before.  i did not know she had married a second
time.

lady markby.  [_genially_.]  ah, nowadays people marry as often as they
can, donâ€™t they?  it is most fashionable.  [_to_ duchess of maryborough.]

mrs. cheveley.  [_playing with her fan_.]  but have we really met before,
lady chiltern?  i canâ€™t remember where.  i have been out of england for
so long.

lady chiltern.  we were at school together, mrs. cheveley.

mrs. cheveley [_superciliously_.]  indeed?  i have forgotten all about my
schooldays.  i have a vague impression that they were detestable.

lady chiltern.  [_coldly_.]  i am not surprised!

mrs. cheveley.  [_in her sweetest manner_.]  do you know, i am quite
looking forward to meeting your clever husband, lady chiltern.  since he
has been at the foreign office, he has been so much talked of in vienna.
they actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  that
in itself is fame, on the continent.

lady chiltern.  i hardly think there will be much in common between you
and my husband, mrs. cheveley!  [_moves away_.]

vicomte de nanjac.  ah! chÃ¨re madame, queue surprise!  i have no

you since berlin!

mrs. cheveley.  not since berlin, vicomte.  five years ago!

vicomte de nanjac.  and you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
how do you manage it?

mrs. cheveley.  by making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming
people like yourself.

vicomte de nanjac.  ah! you flatter me.  you butter me, as they say here.

mrs. cheveley.  do they say that here?  how dreadful of them!

vicomte de nanjac.  yes, they have a wonderful language.  it should be
more widely known.

[sir robert chiltern _enters_.  _a man of forty_, _but looking somewhat
younger_.  _clean-shaven_, _with finely-cut features_, _dark-haired and

are_.  _but intensely admired by the few_, _and deeply respected by the
many_.  _the note of his manner is that of perfect distinction_, _with

john with you?

lady markby.  oh! i have brought a much more charming person than sir
john.  sir johnâ€™s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
become quite unbearable.  really, now that the house of commons is trying
to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.

sir robert chiltern.  i hope not, lady markby.  at any rate we do our
best to waste the public time, donâ€™t we?  but who is this charming person
you have been kind enough to bring to us?

lady markby.  her name is mrs. cheveley!  one of the dorsetshire
cheveleys, i suppose.  but i really donâ€™t know.  families are so mixed
nowadays.  indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley?  i seem to know the name.

lady markby.  she has just arrived from vienna.

sir robert chiltern.  ah! yes.  i think i know whom you mean.

lady markby.  oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant
scandals about all her friends.  i really must go to vienna next winter.
i hope there

sir robert chiltern.  if there is not, the ambassador will certainly have
to be recalled.  pray point out mrs. cheveley to me.  i should like to
see her.

lady markby.  let me introduce you.  [_to_ mrs. cheveley.]  my dear, sir
robert chiltern is dying to know you!

sir robert chiltern.  [_bowing_.]  every one is dying to know the
brilliant mrs. cheveley.  our attachÃ©s at vienna write to us about
nothing else.

mrs. cheveley.  thank you, sir robert.  an acquaintance that begins with
a compliment is sure to develop into a real friendship.  it starts in the
right manner.  and i find that i know lady chiltern already.

sir robert chiltern.  really?

mrs. cheveley.  yes.  she has just reminded me that we were at school
together.  i remember it perfectly now.  she always got the good conduct
prize.  i have a distinct recollection of lady chiltern always getting
the good conduct prize!

sir robert chiltern.  [_smiling_.]
 
 ___________________________
 
  and what prizes did you get, mrs.
cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  my prizes came a little later on in life.  i donâ€™t think
any of them were for good conduct.  i forget!

sir robert chiltern.  i am sure they were for something charming!

mrs. cheveley.  i donâ€™t know that women are always rewarded for being
charming.  i think they are usually punished for it!  certainly, more
women grow old nowadays through the faithfulness of their admirers than
through anything else!  at least that is the only way i can account for
the terribly haggard look of most of your pretty women in london!

sir robert chiltern.  what an appalling philosophy that sounds!  to
attempt to classify you, mrs. cheveley, would be an impertinence.  but
may i ask, at heart, 
 
 ___________________________
 
are you an optimist or a pessimist?  those seem to
be the only two fashionable religions left to us nowadays.

mrs. cheveley.  oh, iâ€™m neither.  optimism begins in a broad grin, and
pessimism ends with blue spectacles.  besides, they are both of them
merely poses.

sir robert chiltern.  you prefer to be natural?

mrs. cheveley.  sometimes.  but it is such a very difficult pose to keep
up.

sir robert chiltern.  what would those modern psychological novelists, of
whom we hear so much, say to such a theory as that?

mrs. cheveley.  ah! the strength of women comes from the fact that
psychology cannot explain us.  men can be analysed, women . . . merely
adored.

sir robert chiltern.  you think science cannot grapple with the problem
of women?

mrs. cheveley.  science can never grapple with the irrational.  that is
why it

 has no future before it, in this world.

sir robert chiltern.  and women represent the irrational.

mrs. cheveley.  well-dressed women do.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with a polite bow_.]  i fear i could hardly agree
with you there.  but do sit down.  and now tell me, what makes you leave
your brilliant vienna for our gloomy londonâ€”or perhaps the question is
indiscreet?

mrs. cheveley.  questions are never indiscreet.  answers sometimes are.

sir robert chiltern.  well, at any rate, may i know if it is politics or
pleasure?

mrs. cheveley.  politics are my only pleasure.  you see nowadays it is
not fashionable to flirt till one is forty, or to be romantic till one is
forty-five, so we poor women who are under thirty, or say we are, have
nothing open to us but politics or philanthropy.  and philanthropy seems
to me to have become simply the refuge of people who wish to annoy

fellow-creatures.  i prefer politics.  i think they are more . . .
becoming!

sir robert chiltern.  a political life is a noble career!

mrs. cheveley.  sometimes.  and sometimes it is a clever game, sir
robert.  and sometimes it is a great nuisance.

sir robert chiltern.  which do you find it?

mrs. cheveley.  i?  a combination of all three.  [_drops her fan_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_picks up fan_.]  allow me!

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.

sir robert chiltern.  but you have not told me yet what makes you honour
london so suddenly.  our season is almost over.

mrs. cheveley.  oh! i donâ€™t care about the london season!  it is too
matrimonial.  people are either hunting for husbands, or hiding from
them.  i wanted to meet you.  it is quite true.  you know what a womanâ€™s
curiosity is.  almost as great as a manâ€™s!  i wanted immensely to meet
you, and . . . to ask you to do something for me.

quite a little thing.

sir robert chiltern.  i am so glad.  do tell me what it is.

mrs. cheveley.  later on.  [_rises_.]  and now may i walk through your
beautiful house?  i hear your pictures are charming.  poor baron
arnheimâ€”you remember the baron?â€”used to tell me you had some wonderful
corots.

sir robert chiltern.  [_with an almost imperceptible start_.]  did you
know baron arnheim well?

mrs. cheveley.  [_smiling_.]  intimately.  did you?

sir robert chiltern.  at one time.

me to introduce to you lord goring, the idlest man in london.

mrs. cheveley.  i have met lord goring before.

lord goring.  [_bowing_.]  i did not think you would remember me, mrs.
cheveley.

mrs. cheveley.  my memory is under admirable control.  and are you still
a bachelor?

lord goring.  i . . . believe so.

mrs. cheveley.  how very romantic!

lord goring.  oh! i am not at all romantic.  i am not old enough.  i
leave romance to my seniors.

sir robert chiltern.  lord goring is the result of boodleâ€™s club, mrs.
cheveley.

mrs. cheveley.  he reflects every credit on the institution.

lord goring.  may i ask are you staying in london long?

mrs. cheveley.  that depends partly on the weather, partly on the
cooking, and partly on sir robert.

sir robert chiltern.  you are not going to plunge us into a european war,

punished.

mrs. marchmont.  [_drawing herself up_.]  oh, dear no!  they are as happy
as possible!  and as for trusting us, it is tragic how much they trust
us.

lady basildon.  perfectly tragic!

lord goring.  or comic, lady basildon?

lady basildon.  certainly not comic, lord goring.  how unkind of you to
suggest such a thing!

mrs. marchmont.  i am afraid lord goring is in the camp of the enemy, as
usual.  i saw him talking to that mrs. cheveley when he came in.

lord goring.  handsome woman, mrs. cheveley!

lady basildon.  [_stiffly_.]  please donâ€™t praise other women in our
presence.  you might wait for us to do that!

lord goring.  i did wait.

mrs. marchmont.  well, we are not going to praise her.  i hear she went
to the opera on monday night, and told tommy rufford at supper that, as
far as she could see, london society was entirely made up of dowdies and
dandies.

lord goring.  she is quite right, too.  the men are all dowdies

and the
women are all dandies, arenâ€™t they?

mrs. marchmont.  [_after a pause_.]  oh! do you really think that is what
mrs. cheveley meant?

lord goring.  of course.  and a very sensible remark for mrs. cheveley to
make, too.

[_enter_ mabel chiltern.  _she joins the group_.]

mabel chiltern.  why are you talking about mrs. cheveley?  everybody is
talking about mrs. cheveley!  lord goring saysâ€”what did you say, lord
goring, about mrs. cheveley?  oh! i remember, that she was a genius in
the daytime and a beauty at night.

lady basildon.  what a horrid combination!  so very unnatural!

mrs. marchmont.  [_in her most dreamy manner_.]  i like looking at
geniuses, and listening to beautiful people.

lord goring.  ah! that is morbid of you, mrs. marchmont!

mrs. marchmont.  [_brightening to a look of real pleasure_.]  i am so
glad to hear you say that.  marchmont and i have been married for seven
years, and he has never once told me that i

mr. montford.  i donâ€™t know that i like being watched when i am eating!

mrs. marchmont.  then i will watch some one else.

mr. montford.  i donâ€™t know that i should like that either.

mrs. marchmont.  [_severely_.]  pray, mr. montford, do not make these
painful scenes of jealousy in public!

[_they go downstairs with the other guests_, _passing_ sir robert

sir robert chiltern.  and are you going to any of our country houses
before you leave england, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  oh, no!  i canâ€™t stand your english house-parties.  in
england people actually try to be brilliant at breakfast.  that is so
dreadful of them!  only dull people are brilliant at breakfast.  and then
the family skeleton is always reading family prayers.  my stay in england
really depends on you, sir robert.  [_sits down on the sofa_.]

mrs. cheveley.  quite seriously.  i want to talk to you about a great
political and financial scheme, about this argentine canal company, in
fact.

sir robert chiltern.  what a tedious, practical subject for you to talk
about, mrs. cheveley!

mrs. cheveley.  oh, i like tedious, practical subjects.  what i donâ€™t
like are tedious, practical people.  there is a wide difference.
besides, you are interested, i know, in international canal schemes.  you
were lord radleyâ€™s secretary, werenâ€™t you, when the government bought the
suez canal shares?

sir robert chiltern.  yes.  but the suez canal was a very great and
splendid undertaking.  it gave us our direct route to india.  it had
imperial value.  it was necessary that we should have control.  thi

argentine scheme is a commonplace stock exchange swindle.

mrs. cheveley.  a speculation, sir robert!  a brilliant, daring
speculation.

sir robert chiltern.  believe me, mrs. cheveley, it is a swindle.  let us
call things by their proper names.  it makes matters simpler.  we have
all the information about it at the foreign office.  in fact, i sent out
a special commission to inquire into the matter privately, and they
report that the works are hardly begun, and as for the money already
subscribed, no one seems to know what has become of it.  the whole thing
is a second panama, and with not a quarter of the chance of success that
miserable affair ever had.  i hope you have no

sure you are far too clever to have done that.

mrs. cheveley.  i have invested very largely in it.

sir robert chiltern.  who could have advised you to do such a foolish
thing?

mrs. cheveley.  your old friendâ€”and mine.

sir robert chiltern.  who?

mrs. cheveley.  baron arnheim.

sir robert chiltern.  [_frowning_.]  ah! yes.  i remember hearing, at the
time of his death, that he had been mixed up in the whole affair.

mrs. cheveley.  it was his last romance.  his last but one, to do him
justice.

sir robert chiltern.  [_rising_.]  but you have not seen my corots yet.
they are in the music-room.  corots seem to go with music, donâ€™t they?
may i show them to you?

mrs. cheveley.  [_shaking her head_.]  i am not in a mood to-night for
silver twilights, or rose-pink dawns.  i want to talk business.

heveley,
except to interest yourself in something less dangerous.  the success of
the canal depends, of course, on the attitude of england, and i am going
to lay the report of the commissioners before the house to-morrow night.

mrs. cheveley.  that you must not do.  in your own interests, sir robert,
to say nothing of mine, you must not do that.

sir robert chiltern.  [_looking at her in wonder_.]  in my own interests?
my dear mrs. cheveley, what do you mean?  [_sits down beside her_.]

mrs. cheveley.  sir robert, i will be quite frank with you.  i want you
to withdraw the report that you had intended to lay before the house, on
the ground that you have reasons to believe that the commissioners have
been prejudiced or misinformed, or something.  then i want you to say a
few words to the effect that the government is going to reconsider the
question, and that you have reason to believe that the canal, if
completed, will be of great international value.  you know the sort of
things ministers

will do.  in modern life nothing produces such an effect as a good
platitude.  it makes the whole world kin.  will you do that for me?

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley, you cannot be serious in making me
such a proposition!

mrs. cheveley.  i am quite serious.

sir robert chiltern.  [_coldly_.]  pray allow me to believe that you are
not.

mrs. cheveley.  [_speaking with great deliberation and emphasis_.]  ah!
but i am.  and if you do what i ask you, i . . . will pay you very
handsomely!

sir robert chiltern.  pay me!

mrs. cheveley.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  i am afraid i donâ€™t quite understand what you mean.

mrs. cheveley.  [_leaning back on the sofa and looking at him_.]  how
very disappointing!  and i have come all the way from vienna in order
that you should thoroughly understand me.

sir robert chiltern.  i fear i donâ€™t.

t nonchalant manner_.]  my dear sir robert,
you are a man of the world, and you have your price, i suppose.
everybody has nowadays.  the drawback is that most people are so
dreadfully expensive.  i know i am.  i hope you will be more reasonable
in your terms.

sir robert chiltern.  [_rises indignantly_.]  if you will allow me, i
will call your carriage for you.  you have lived so long abroad, mrs.
cheveley, that you seem to be unable to realise that you are talking to
an english gentleman.

mrs. cheveley.  [_detains him by touching his arm with her fan_, _and
keeping it there while she is talking_.]  i realise that i am talking to
a man who laid the foundation of his fortune by selling to a stock
exchange speculator a cabinet secret.

sir robert chiltern.  [_biting his lip_.]  what do you mean?

mrs. cheveley.  [_rising and facing him_.]  i mean that i know the real
origin of your wealth and your career, and i have got your letter, too.

sir robert chiltern.  what letter?

mrs. cheveley.  [_con
 
 ___________________________
 
temptuously_.]  the letter you wrote to baron
arnheim, when you were lord radleyâ€™s secretary, telling the baron to buy
suez canal sharesâ€”a letter written three days before the government
announced its own purchase.

sir robert chiltern.  [_hoarsely_.]  it is not true.

mrs. cheveley.  you thought that letter had been destroyed.  how foolish
of you!  it is in my possession.

sir robert chiltern.  the affair to which you allude was no more than a
speculation.  the house of commons had not yet passed the bill; it might
have been rejected.

mrs. cheveley.  it was a swindle, sir robert.  let us call things by
their proper names.  it makes everything simpler.  and now i am going to
sell you that letter, and the price i ask for it is your public support
of the argentine scheme.

mrs. cheveley.  oh, no!  this is the game of life as we all have to play
it, sir robert, sooner or later!

sir robert chiltern.  i cannot do what you ask me.

mrs. cheveley.  you mean you cannot help doing it.  you know you are
standing on the edge of a precipice.  and it is not for you to make
terms.  it is for you to accept them.  supposing you refuseâ€”

sir robert chiltern.  what then?

mrs. cheveley.  my dear sir robert, what then?  you are ruined, that is
all!  remember to what a point your puritanism in england has brought
you.  in old days nobody pretended to be a bit better than his
neighbours.  in fact, to be a bit better than oneâ€™s neighbour was

for what we do.  you have to pay now.  before i leave you to-night, you
have got to promise me to suppress your report, and to speak in the house

sir robert chiltern.  what you ask is impossible.

mrs. cheveley.  you must make it possible.  you are going to make it
possible.  sir robert, you know what your english newspapers are like.

office, and give them this scandal and the proofs of it!  think of their

had heaps of opportunityâ€”you have made an announcement to the house in
the terms i wish, i shall hand you back your letter with the

play fairly . . . when one has the winning cards.  the baron taught me
that . . . amongst other things.

sir robert chiltern.  you must let me have time to consider your
proposal.

mrs. cheveley.  no; you must settle now!

sir robert chiltern.  give me a weekâ€”three days!

mrs. cheveley.  impossible!  i have got to telegraph to vienna to-night.

sir robert chiltern.  my god! what brought you into my life?

mrs. cheveley.  circumstances.  [_moves towards the door_.]

sir robert chiltern.  donâ€™t go.  i consent.  the report shall be
withdrawn.  i will arrange for a question to be put to me on the subject.

mrs. cheveley.  thank you.  i knew we should come to an amicable
agreement.  i understood your nature from the first.  i analysed you,
though you did not adore me.  and now y

sir robert is very entertaining, is he not?

mrs. cheveley.  most entertaining!  i have enjoyed my talk with him
immensely.

lady markby.  he has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  and he
has married a most admirable wife.  lady chiltern is a woman of the very
highest principles, i am glad to say.  i am a little too old now, myself,
to trouble about setting a good example, but i always admire people who
do.  and lady chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life, though her
dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.  but one canâ€™t have every

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.

lady markby.  we might drive in the park at five.  everything looks so
fresh in the park now!

mrs. cheveley.  except the people!

lady markby.  perhaps the people are a little jaded.  i have often
observed that the season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of
the brain.  however, i think anything is better than high intellectual
pressure.  that is the most unbecoming thing there is.  it makes the
noses of the young girls so particularly large.  and there is nothing so
difficult to marry as a large nose; men donâ€™t like them.  good-night,
dear!  [_to_ lady chiltern.]  good-night, gertrude!  [

lady chiltern.  why did you wish to meet my husband, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  oh, i will tell you.  i wanted to interest him in this
argentine canal scheme, of which i dare say you have heard.  and i found
him most susceptible,â€”susceptible to reason, i mean.  a rare thing in a
man.  i converted him in ten minutes.  he is going to make a speech in

lady chiltern.  [_gently_.]  a secret?  between whom?

mrs. cheveley.  [_with a flash of amusement in her eyes_.]  between your
husband and myself.

sir robert chiltern.  [_entering_.]  your carriage is here, mrs.

mrs. cheveley.  thanks!  good evening, lady chiltern!  good-night, lord

lord goring.  if you wish it, mrs. cheveley!

mrs. cheveley.  oh, donâ€™t be so solemn about it, or i shall be obliged to
leave a card on you.  in england i suppose that would hardly be
considered en rÃ¨gle.  abroad, we are more civilised.  will you see me

mabel chiltern.  lord goring, you are always ordering me out of the room.

lady chiltern.  robert, it is not true, is it?  you are not going to lend
your support to this argentine speculation?  you couldnâ€™t!

sir robert chiltern.  [_starting_.]  who told you i intended to do so?

lady chiltern.  that woman who has just gone out, mrs. cheveley, as she
calls herself now.  she seemed to taunt me with it.  robert, i know this
woman.  you donâ€™t.  we were at school together.  she was untruthful,
dishonest, an evil influence on every one whose trust or friendship she
could win.  i hated, i despised her.  she stole things, she was a thief.
she was sent away for being a thief.  why do you let her influence you?

might not know.

lady chiltern.  i was sure of it, robert, i was sure of it.  but why did
you say those dreadful things, things so unlike your real self?  donâ€™t
let us ever talk about the subject again.  you will write, wonâ€™t you, to
mrs. cheveley, and tell her that you cannot support this scandalous
scheme of hers?  if you have given her any promise you must take it back,
that is all!

sir robert chiltern.  must i write and tell her that?

lady chiltern.  surely, robert!  what else is there to do?

sir robert chiltern.  i might see her personally.  it would be better.

that, robert.  it is the only thing to do now.  and you must begin by
telling your wife the whole story.

sir robert chiltern.  that i will not do.

lord goring.  robert, believe me, you are wrong.

sir robert chiltern.  i couldnâ€™t do it.  it would kill her love for me.
and now about this woman, this mrs. cheveley.  how can i defend myself
against her?  you knew her before, arthur, apparently.

lord goring.  yes.

sir robert chiltern.  did you know her well?

lord goring.  [_arranging his necktie_.]  so little that i got engaged to
be married to her once, when i was staying at the tenbysâ€™.  the affair
lasted for three days . . . nearly.

idea.  but every one has some weak point.  there is some flaw in each one
of us.  [_strolls to the fireplace and looks at himself in the glass_.]
my father tells me that even i have faults.  perhaps i have.  i donâ€™t

sir robert chiltern.  in defending myself against mrs. cheveley, i have a
right to use any weapon i can find, have i not?

lord goring.  [_still looking in the glass_.]  in your place i donâ€™t
think i should have the smallest scruple in doing so.  she is thoroughly
well able to take care of herself.

sir robert chiltern.  [_sits down at the table and takes a pen in his

to inquire if there is anything known against her.  there may be some
secret scandal she might be afraid of.

chance, but i believe in it.  and as i fought the age with its own
weapons, i will fight her with her weapons.  it is only fair, and she
looks like a woman with a past, doesnâ€™t she?

lord goring.  most pretty women do.  but there is a fashion in pasts just
as there is a fashion in frocks.  perhaps mrs. cheveleyâ€™s past is merely
a slightly dÃ©colletÃ© one, and they are excessively popular nowadays.
besides, my dear robert, i should not build too high hopes on frightening
mrs. cheveley.  i should not fancy mrs. cheveley is a woman who would be
easily frightened.  she has survived all her creditors, and she shows
wonderful presence of mind.

the womanâ€™s liberal association.  you take far too much interest in the
first subject, and not nearly enough in the second.

lord goring.  you want to talk to me about mrs. cheveley?

lady chiltern.  yes.  you have guessed it.  after you left last night i
found out that what she had said was really true.  of course i made
robert write her a letter at once, withdrawing his promise.

lord goring.  so he gave me to understand.

lady chiltern.  to have kept it would have been the first stain on a
career that has been stainless always.  robert must be above reproach.
he is not like other men.  he cannot afford to do what other men do.

mabel chiltern.  oh! lord goring is president.

mrs. cheveley.  the post should suit him admirably, unless he has

instances of it.

ft on us at the end of an evening.  i know myself that,
when i am coming back from the drawing room, i always feel as if i hadnâ€™t
a shred on me, except a small shred of decent reputation, just enough to
prevent the lower classes making painful observations through the windows
of the carriage.  the fact is that our society is terribly
over-populated.  really, some one should arrange a proper scheme of
assisted emigration.  it would do a great deal of good.

mrs. cheveley.  i quite agree with you, lady markby.  it is nearly six
years since i have been in london for the season, and i must say society
has become dreadfully mixed.  one sees the oddest people everywhere.

lady markby.  that is quite true, dear.  but one neednâ€™t know them.  iâ€™m
sure i donâ€™t know half the people who come to my house.  indeed, from all
i hear, i shouldnâ€™t like to.

lady markby.  [_nodding her head_.]  and very becoming, i am quite sure.

lady chiltern.  has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the

husbands for us.  i think the lower house by far the greatest blow to a
happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called

robert is a great champion of the higher education of women, and so, i am
afraid, am i.

mrs. cheveley.  the higher education of men is what i should like to see.
men need it so sadly.

lady markby.  they do, dear.  but i am afraid such a scheme would be
quite unpractical.  i donâ€™t think man has much capacity for development.
he has got as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?  with regard to
women, well, dear gertrude, you belong to the younger generation, and i
am sure it is all right if you approve of it.  in my time, of course, we
were taught not to understand anything.  that was the

old system, and
wonderfully interesting it was.  i assure you that the amount of things i
and my poor dear sister were taught not to understand was quite
extraordinary.  but modern women understand everything, i am told.

mrs. cheveley.  except their husbands.  that is the one thing the modern
woman never understands.

lady markby.  and a very good thing too, dear, i dare say.  it might
break up many a happy home if they did.  not yours, i need hardly say,
gertrude.  you have married a pattern husband.  i wish i could say as
much for myself.  but since sir john has taken to attending the debates
regularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his language
has become quite impossible.  he always seems to think that

i trust, gertrude, that sir robert is not like that?

lady chiltern.  but i am very much interested in politics, lady markby.
i love to hear robert talk about them.

lady markby.  well, i hope he is not as devoted to blue books as sir john
is.  i donâ€™t think they can be quite improving reading for any one.

mrs. cheveley [_languidly_.]  i have never read a blue book.  i prefer
books . . . in yellow covers.

lady markby.  [_genially unconscious_.]  yellow is a gayer colour, is it
not?  i used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, and would do so
now if sir john was not so painfully personal in his observations, and a
man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not?

mrs. cheveley.  oh, no!  i think men are the only authorities on dress.

lady markby.  really?  one wouldnâ€™t say so from the s

who is in very great trouble.  her daughter, quite a well-brought-up
girl, too, has actually become engaged to be married to a curate in
shropshire.  it is very sad, very sad indeed.  i canâ€™t understand this
modern mania for curates.  in my time we girls saw them, of course,

 quarrelled with his father, and it is said that when they
meet at the club lord brancaster always hides himself behind the money
article in _the times_.  however, i believe that is quite a common
occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of _the
times_ at all the clubs in st. jamesâ€™s street; there are so many sons who
wonâ€™t have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers who
wonâ€™t speak to their sons.  i think myself, it is very much to be
regretted.

mrs. cheveley.  so do i.  fathers have so much to learn from their sons
nowadays.

lady markby.  really, dear?  what?

mrs. cheveley.  the art of living.  the only really fine art we have
produced in modern times.

lady markby.  [_shaking her head_.]  ah!  i am afraid lord brancaster
knew a good deal about that.  more than his poor wife ever did.

life.  [_rising_.]  and now, gertrude, if you will allow me, i shall

an hour.  or perhaps, dear mrs. cheveley, you wouldnâ€™t mind waiting in

mrs. cheveley [_rising_.]  i donâ€™t mind waiting in the carriage at all,

mrs. cheveley.  are you quite sure?

phipps.  his lordship told me that if a lady called i was to ask her to
wait in the drawing-room.  [_goes to the door of the drawing-room and
opens it_.]  his lordshipâ€™s directions on the subject were very precise.

mrs. cheveley.  [_to herself_]  how thoughtful of him!  to expect the
unexpected shows a thoroughly modern intellect.  [_goes towards the
drawing-room and looks in_.]  ugh!  how dreary a bachelorâ€™s drawing-room
always looks.  i shall have to alter all this.  [phipps _brings the lamp
from the writing-table_.]  no, i donâ€™t care for that lamp.  it is far too
glaring.  light some candles.

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley herself.  and the woman i love knows
that i began my career with an act of low dishonesty, that i built up my
life upon sands of shameâ€”that i sold, like a common huckster, the secret

lord goring.  i see you are quite as wilful as you used to be.

mrs. cheveley.  far more!  i have greatly improved.  i have had more

mrs. cheveley.  [_sitting down_.]  oh, no!  a well-made dress has no

lord goring.  what is your price for it?

mrs. cheveley.  how absurdly english you are!  the english think that a
cheque-book can solve every problem in life.  why, my dear arthur, i have
very much more money than you have, and quite as much as robert chiltern
has got hold of.  money is not what i want.

lord goring.  what do you want then, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  why donâ€™t you call me laura?

lord goring.  i donâ€™t like the name.

mrs. cheveley.  arthur, you loved me once.

lord goring.  yes.

mrs. cheveley.  and you asked me to be your wife.

lord goring.  that was the natural result of my loving you.

mrs. cheveley.  and you threw me over because you saw, or said you saw,
poor old lord mortlake trying to have a violent flirtation with me in the
conservatory at tenby.

lord goring.  i am under the impression that my lawyer settled that
matter with you on certain terms . . . dictated by yourself.

mrs. cheveley.  at that time i was poor; you were rich.

lord goring.  quite so.  that is why you pretended to love me.

of those utterly tedious amusements one only finds at an english country
house on an english country sunday.  i donâ€™t think any one at all morally
responsible for what he or she does at an english country house.

lord goring.  yes.  i know lots of people think that.

mrs. cheveley.  i loved you, arthur.

lord goring.  my dear mrs. cheveley, you have always been far too clever
to know anything about love.

mrs. cheveley.  i did love you.  and you loved me.  you know you loved
me; and love is a very wonderful thing.  i suppose that when a man has
once loved a woman, he will do anything for her, except continue to love
her?  [_puts her hand on his_.]

ever have cared for anybody, arthur.  and so, on the morning of the day
you marry me, i will give you robert chilternâ€™s letter.  that is my
offer.  i will give it to you now, if you promise to marry me.

mrs. cheveley.  [_smiling_.]  to-morrow.

mrs. cheveley.  yes, quite serious.

me immensely.

mrs. cheveley.  do you think it is quite charming of you to be so rude to
a woman in your own house?

lord goring.  in the case of very fascinating women, sex is a challenge,
not a defence.

mrs. cheveley.  i suppose that is meant for a compliment.  my dear
arthur, women are never disarmed by compliments.  men always are.  that
is the difference between the two sexes.

lord goring.  women are never disarmed by anything, as far as i know
them.

mrs. cheveley.  [_after a pause_.]  then you are going to allow your
greatest friend, robert chiltern, to be ruined, rather than marry some
one who really has considerable attractions left.  i thought you would
have risen to some great height of self-sacrifice, arthur.  i think you
should.  and the rest of your life you could spend in contemplating your
own perfections.

lord goring.  oh! i do that as it is.  and self-sacrifice is a thing that
should be put down by law.  it is so demoralising to the people f

an act of folly done in his youth, dishonourable, i admit, shameful, i

character.

mrs. cheveley.  how you men stand up for each other!

lord goring.  how you women war against each other!

mrs. cheveley.  [_bitterly_.]  i only war against one woman, against
gertrude chiltern.  i hate her.  i hate her now more than ever.

lord goring.  because you have brought a real tragedy into her life, i
suppose.

future invariably her husband.

orgotten that you came here to-night to talk of
love, you whose lips desecrated the word love, you to whom the thing is a
book closely sealed, went this afternoon to the house of one of the most
noble and gentle women in the world to degrade her husband in her eyes,
to try and kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and
bitterness in her life, to break her idol, and, it may be, spoil her
soul.  that i cannot forgive you.  that was horrible.  for that there can
be no forgiveness.

mrs. cheveley.  arthur, you are unjust to me.  believe me, you are quite
unjust to me.  i didnâ€™t go to taunt gertrude at all.  i had no idea of
doing anything of the kind when i entered.  i called with lady markby
simply to ask whether an ornament, a jewel, that i lost somewhere last
night, had been found at the chilternsâ€™.  if you donâ€™t believe me, you

mrs. cheveley.  yes.  how do you know?

lord goring.  because it is found.  in point of fact, i found it myself,

well on me as a bracelet, doesnâ€™t it?

lord goring.  yes; much better than when i saw it last.

mrs. cheveley.  when did you see it last?

lord goring.  [_calmly_.]  oh, ten years ago, on lady berkshire, from
whom you stole it.

mrs. cheveley.  [_starting_.]  what do you mean?

lord goring.  i mean that you stole that ornament from my cousin, mary
berkshire, to whom i gave it when she was married.  suspicion fell on a
wretched servant, who was sent away in disgrace.  i recognised it last
night.  i determined to say nothing about it till i had found the thief.
i have found the thief now, and i have heard her own confession.

lord goring.  the drawback of stealing a thing, mrs. cheveley, is that
one never knows how wonderful the thing that one steals is.  you canâ€™t
get that bracelet off, unless you know where the spring is.  and i see
you donâ€™t know where the spring is.  it is rather difficult to find.

that terribly distresses me.  yesterday evening you wrote me a very

of your oldest friends, one of your husbandâ€™s oldest friends.  mrs.
cheveley stole that letter from my rooms.

lady chiltern.  well, what use is it to her?  why should she not have it?

lord goring.  [_rising_.]  lady chiltern, i will be quite frank with you.
mrs. cheveley puts a certain construction on that letter and proposes to
send it to your husband.

lady chiltern.  but what construction could she put on it? . . . oh! not
that! not that!  if i inâ€”in trouble, and wanting your help, trusting you,
propose to come to you . . . that you may advise me . . . assist me . . .
oh! are there women so horrible as that . . .?  and she proposes to send
it to my husband?  tell me what happened.  tell me all that happened.

lord goring.  mrs. cheveley was concealed in a

without my knowledge.  i thought that the person who was waiting in that
room to see me was yourself.  robert came in unexpectedly.  a chair or
something fell in the room.  he forced his way in, and he discovered her.
we had a terrible scene.  i still thought it was you.  he left me in
anger.  at the end of everything mrs. cheveley got possession of your
letterâ€”she stole it, when or how, i donâ€™t know.

lady chiltern.  at what hour did this happen?

lord goring.  at half-past ten.  and now i propose that we tell robert
the whole thing at once.

lady chiltern.  [_looking at him with amazement that is almost terror_.]
you want me to tell robert that the woman you expected was not mrs.
cheveley, but myself?  that it was i whom you thought was concealed in a
room in your house, at half-past ten oâ€™clock at night?  you wan

 because i loved you.

[lord goring _passes into the conservatory_.]

sir robert chiltern.  [_kisses her_.]  gertrude, you donâ€™t know what i
feel.  when montford passed me your letter across the tableâ€”he had opened
it by mistake, i suppose, without looking at the handwriting on the
envelopeâ€”and i read itâ€”oh! i did not care what disgrace or punishment was
in store for me, i only thought you loved me still.

lady chiltern.  there is no disgrace in store for you, nor any public
shame.  mrs. cheveley has handed over to lord goring the document that
was in her possession, and he has destroyed it.

sir robert chiltern.  are you sure of this, gertrude?

lady chiltern.  yes; lord goring has just told me.

sir robert chiltern.  then i am safe!  oh! what a wonderful thing to be
safe!  for two days i have been in terror.  i am safe now.  how did
arthur destroy my letter?  tell me.

lady chiltern.  he burned it.

sir robert chiltern.  i wish i had seen that one sin of my youth burning
to ashes.  ho

onservatory,
father, the conservatoryâ€”there is some one there i want you to talk to.

lord caversham.  what about, sir?

lord goring.  about me, father,

lord caversham.  [_grimly_.]  not a subject on which much eloquence is
possible.

lord goring.  no, father; but the lady is like me.  she doesnâ€™t care much
for eloquence in others.  she thinks it a little loud.

[lord caversham _goes out into the conservatory_.  lady chiltern
_enters_.]

lord goring.  lady chiltern, why are you playing mrs. cheveleyâ€™s cards?

lady chiltern.  [_startled_.]  i donâ€™t understand you.

lord goring.  mrs. cheveley made an attempt to ruin your husband.  either
to drive him from public life, or to make him adopt a dishonourable
position.  from the latter tragedy you saved him.  the former you are now
thrusting on him.  why should you do him the wrong mrs. cheveley tried to
do and failed?

lady chiltern.  lord goring?

lord goring.  [_pulling himself together for a great effort_, _and
showing the philosopher th

be broken.

lord goring.  but i love mabel.  no other woman has any place in my life.

lady chiltern.  robert, if they love each other, why should they not be
married?

sir robert chiltern.  arthur cannot bring mabel the love that she
deserves.

lord goring.  what reason have you for saying that?

sir robert chiltern.  [_after a pause_.]  do you really require me to
tell you?

lord goring.  certainly i do.

sir robert chiltern.  as you choose.  when i called on you yesterday
evening i found mrs. cheveley concealed in your rooms.  it was between
ten and eleven oâ€™clock at night.  i do not wish to say anything more.
your relations with mrs. cheveley have, as i said to you last night,
nothing whatsoever to do with me.  i know you were engaged to be married
to her once.  the fascination she exercised over you then seems to have
returned.  you spoke to me last night of her as of a woman pure and
stainless, a woman whom you respected and honoured.  that may be so.  but
i cannot give my sisterâ€™s li

fe into your hands.  it would be wrong of me.
it would be unjust, infamously unjust to her.

lord goring.  i have nothing more to say.

lady chiltern.  robert, it was not mrs. cheveley whom lord goring
expected last night.

sir robert chiltern.  not mrs. cheveley!  who was it then?

lord goring.  lady chiltern!

lady chiltern.  it was your own wife.  robert, yesterday afternoon lord
goring told me that if ever i was in trouble i could come to him for
help, as he was our oldest and best friend.  later on, after that
terrible scene in this room, i wrote to him telling him that i trusted
him, that i had need of him, that i was coming to him for help and
advice.  [sir robert chiltern _takes the letter out of his pocket_.]
yes, that letter.  i didnâ€™t go to

 lord goringâ€™s, after all.  i felt that
it is from ourselves alone that help can come.  pride made me think that.
mrs. cheveley went.  she stole my letter and sent it anonymously to you
this morning, that you should think . . . oh! robert, i cannot tell you
what she wished you to think. . . .

sir robert chiltern.  what!  had i fallen so low in your eyes that you
thought that even for a moment i could have doubted your goodness?
gertrude, gertrude, you are to me the white image of all good things, and
sin can never touch you.  arthur, you can go to mabel, and you have my
best wishes!  oh! stop a moment.  there is no nam

this letter.  the brilliant mrs. cheveley does not seem to have noticed
that.  there should be a name.

lady chiltern.  let me write yours.  it is you i trust and need.  you and
none else.

lord goring.  well, really, lady chiltern, i think i should have back my
own letter.

lady chiltern.  [_smiling_.]  no; you shall have mabel.  [_takes the
letter and writes her husbandâ€™s name on it_.]

lord goring.  well, i hope she hasnâ€™t changed her mind.  itâ€™s nearly
twenty minutes since i saw her last.
