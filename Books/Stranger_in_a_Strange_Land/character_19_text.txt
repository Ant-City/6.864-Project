 captain willem van tromp was a man of humanity and good sense. he radioed
ahead: "my passenger must not, repeat, must not be subjected to the strain of a public reception. provide
low-gee shuttle, stretcher and ambulance service, and anned guard."
 he sent his ship's surgeon dr. nelson along to make sure that valentine michael smith was
installed in a suite in bethesda medical center, transferred gently into a hydraulic bed, and protected
from outside contact by marine guards. van tromp himself went to an extraordinary session of the
federation high council.
 at the moment when valentine michael smith was being lifted into bed, the high minister for
science was saying testily, "granted, captain, that your authority as military commander of what was

 with tom meechum,
smith's special nurse. thaddeus had one eye on his dials and meters and both eyes on his cards;
nevertheless he noted every heart beat of his patient. when a flickering light changed from ninety-two
pulsations per minute to less than twenty, he pushed the cards aside, jumped to his feet, and hurried into
smith's room with meechum at his heels.
 the patient floated in the flexible skin of the hydraulic bed. he appeared to be dead. thaddeus
swore briefly and snapped, "get doctor nelson!"
 meechum said, "yessir!" and added, "how about the shock gear, doc? he's far gone."
 "get doctor nelson!"
 the nurse rushed out. the interne examined the patient as closely as possible but refrained from
touching him. he was still doing so when an older doctor came in, walking with the labored
awkwardness of a man long in space and not yet adjusted to high gravity. "well, doctor?"
 "patient's respiration, temperature, and pulse dropped suddenly, uh, about two minutes ago, sir."
 "what have yo

 "nothing, sir. your instructions-"
 "good." nelson looked smith over briefly, then studied the instruments back of the bed, twins of
those in the watch room. "let me know if there is any change." he started to leave.
 thaddeus looked startled. "but, doctor-" he broke off.
 nelson said grimly, "go ahead, doctor. what is your diagnosis?"
 "uh, i don't wish to sound off about your patient, sir."
 "never mind. i asked for your diagnosis."
 "very well, sir. shock-atypical, perhaps," he hedged, "but shock, leading to termination."
 nelson nodded. "reasonable enough. but this isn't a reasonable case. relax, son. i've seen this
patient in this condition half a dozen times during the trip back. it doesn't mean a thing. watch." nelson
lifted the patient's right arm, let it go. it

 stayed where he had left it.
 "catalepsy?" asked thaddeus.
 "call it that if you like. calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one. don't worry about it, doctor.
there is nothing typical about this case. just keep him from being bothered and call me if there is any
change." he replaced smith's arm.
 when nelson had left, thaddeus took one more look at the patient, shook his head and joined
meechum in the watch room. meechum picked up his cards and said, "crib?"

 meechuin waited, then added, "doc, if you ask me, that one in there is a case for the basket

 down from the ceiling, spinning as it went. smith watched it with
delight and wondered if it were a nestling form of man.
 doctor archer frame, the interne who had relieved thaddeus, walked in at that moment. "good
morning," he said. "how do you feel?"
 smith turned the question over in his mind. the first phrase he recognized as a formal sound,
requiring no answer but which could be repeated-or might not be. the second phrase was listed in his
mind with several possible translations. if doctor nelson used it, it meant one thing; if captain van tromp
used it, it was a formal sound, needing no reply.
 he felt that dismay which so often overtook him in trying to communicate with these creatures-a
frightening sensation unknown to him before he met men. but he forced his body to remain calm and
risked an answer. "feel good."
 "good!" the creature echoed. "doctor nelson will be along in a minute. feel like some
breakfast?"
 all four symbols in the query were in smith's vocabulary but he had troub

le believing that he had
heard them rightly. he knew that he was food, but he did not "feel like" food. nor had he had any
warning that he might be selected for such an honor. he had not known that the food supply was such
that it was necessary to reduce the corporate group. he was filled with mild regret, since there was still
so much to grok of these new events, but no reluctance.
 but he was excused from the effort of translating an answer by the entrance of dr. nelson. the
ship's doctor had had little rest and less sleep; he wasted no time on speech but inspected smith and the
array of dials in silence.
 then he turned to smith. "bowels move?" he asked.
 smith understood this; nelson always asked about it. "no, not yet."
 "we'll take care of that. but first you eat. orderly, fetch in that tray."
 nelson fed him two or three bites, then required him to hold the spoon and feed himself. it was
tiring but gave him a feeling of gay triumph, for it was the first u

reaching this oddly distorted space. he cleaned out the bowl and remembered to ask, "who is this?" so
that he could praise his benefactor.
 "what is this, you mean," nelson answered. "it's a synthetic food jelly, based on amino acids-and
now you know as much as you did before. finished? all right, climb out of that bed."
 "beg pardon?" it was an attention symbol which he had learned was useful when communication

a valve at the head of the bed;
water drained out. smith restrained a feeling of insecurity, knowing that nelson cherished him. shortly he
lay on the floor of the bed with the watertight cover wrinkled around him. nelson added, "doctor frame,
take his other elbow. we'll have to help him and steady him."
 with dr. nelson to encourage him and both of them to help him, smith stood up and stumbled
over the rim of the bed. "steady. now stand up on your own," nelson directed. "don't be afraid. we'll
catch you if necessary."
 he made the effort and stood alone-a slender young man with underdeveloped muscles and
overdeveloped chest. his hair had been cut in the champion and his whiskers removed and inhibited. his
most marked feature was his bland, expressionless, almost babyish face-set with eyes which would have
seemed more at home in a man of ninety.
 he stood alone for a moment, trembling slightly, then tried to walk. he managed three shuffling
steps and

to break his fall. "damn!" nelson fumed. "he's gone into another one. here, help me lift him into the bed.

 frame did so, cutting off the flow when the cover skin floated six inches from the top. they
lugged him into it, awkwardly because he had frozen into the foetal position. "get a collar pillow under his
neck," instructed nelson, "and call me when he comes out of it. no-let me sleep, i need it. unless
something worries you. we'll walk him again this afternoon and tomorrow we'll start systematic exercise.

no attention, unaware that they had been flanked.
 she hesitated at the inner door between the two rooms, feeling some of the sharp excitement she
used to feel when sneaking out of student nurses' quarters. but, she told herself, dr. nelson was asleep
and tad wouldn't tell on her even if he caught her. she didn't blame him for keeping his finger on his
number-but he wouldn't report her. she unlocked the door and looked in.
 the patient was in bed, he looked at her as the door opened. her first impression was that here

 smith translated and examined the questions. the inclusion of herself in the first query was
confusing, but he decided that it might symbolize a wish to cherish and grow close. the second part
matched nelson's speech forms. "yes," he answered.
 "good!" aside from his odd lack of expression she saw nothing strange about him-and if women
were unknown to him, he was certainly managing to conceal it. "is there anything i can do for you?" she
glanced around, noted that there was no glass on the bedside shelf. "may i get you water?"

in mars gravity; he's probably weak as a cat."
 "yes, of course. you could see it, just looking at him. but muscular weakness isn't dangerous;
myasthenia gravis is much worse and we manage all right with such cases."
 "they would want to keep him from catching things, too. he's like those experimental animals at

as typed out, it was marked "first voice," "second voice," and so on, but ben had gone back and
written in names wherever he had been able to make attributions later. he had written across the top: "all
voices, identified or not, are masculine."
 most of the items were of no interest. they simply showed that smith had been fed, or washed,
or massaged, and that each morning and afternoon he had been required to get up and exercise under the
supervision of a voice identified as "doctor nelson" and a second voice marked "second doctor." jill
decided that this must be dr. thaddeus.
 but one longish passage had nothing to do with the physical care of the patient. jill read it and
reread it:
 doctor nelson: how are you feeling, boy? are you strong enough to talk for a while?
 smith: yes.
 doctor nelson: a man wants to talk to you.
 smith: (pause) who? (caxton had written in: all of smith's speeches are preceded by long
pauses, some longer than others.)
 nelson: this man is our great (un

one. will you talk with him?
 smith: (very long pause) i am great happy. the old one will talk and i will listen and grow.

 smith: i cannot teach an old one.
 nelson: the old one wishes it. will you let him ask you questions?

 nelson: this way, sir. uh, i have doctor mahmoud standing by, ready to translate for you.
 jill read "new voice." caxton had scratched this out and had written in: "secretary general

 secretary general: i won't need him. you say smith understands english.
 nelson: well, yes and no, your excellency. he knows quite a number of words, but, as
mahmoud says, he doesn't have any cultural context to hang the words on. it can be rather confusing.

 the secretary general's voice did not appear again, nor that of doctor nelson. jill could guess,
from gossip she had picked up around the hospital, that smith had gone into one of his cataleptic
withdrawals. there were only two more entries, neither of them attributed. one read: no need to

intended to get in.
 how? well, at least he now knew where the putative "man from mars" was being kept. get in
as an electrician? or as a janitor? too obvious; he would never get past the guard, not even as far as
"dr. tanner."
 was "tanner" actually a doctor? it seemed unlikely. medical men, even the worst of them,
tended to shy away from hanky-panky contrary to their professional code. take that ship's surgeon,
nelson-he had quit, washed his hands of the case simply because- wait a minute! dr. nelson was one
man who could tell offhand whether that young fellow was the man from mars, without checking
calluses, using trick questions, or anything. caxton reached for buttons, ordered his cab to ascend to
parking level and hover, and immediately tried to phone dr. nelson, relaying through his office for the
purpose since he neither knew where dr. nelson was, nor had with him the means to find out. nor did
his assistant osbert kilgallen know where he was, either, but he did have at hand resources
 
 ___________________________
 
 to find out; it
was not even necessary to draw on caxton's large account of uncollected favors in the enclave, as the
post syndicate's file on important persons placed him at once in the new mayflower. a few minutes
later caxton was talking with him.
 to no purpose-dr. nelson had not seen the broadcast. yes, he had heard about it; no, he had
no reason to think the broadcast had been faked. did dr. nelson know that an attempt had been made
to coerce valentine smith into surrendering his rights to mars under the larkin decision? no, he did not
know it, had no reason to believe so . . . and would not be interested if it were true; it was preposterous
to talk about anyone "owning" mars; mars belonged to the martians. so? let's propose a hypothetical
question, doctor; if someone were trying to- but dr. nelson had switched off. when caxton tried to
reconnect, a recorded voice stated sweetly: "the sub

scriber has voluntarily suspended service
temporarily. if you care to record-" caxton switched off.
 caxton made a foolish statement concerning dr. nelson's parentage. but what he did next was
much more foolish; he phoned the executive palace, demanded to speak to the secretary general.
 his action was more a reflex than a plan. in his years as a snooper, first as a reporter, then as a
lippmann, he had learned that close-held secrets could often be cracked by going all the way to the top
and there making himself unbearably unpleasant. he knew that such twisting of the tiger's tail was
dangerous, for he understood the psychopathology of great powe

another matter. the concept of fiction was nowhere in mike's experience;
there was nothing on which it could rest, and jubal's attempts to explain the idea were so emotionally
upsetting to mike that jill was afraid that he was about to roll up into a ball and withdraw himself.
 but mike himself saw how perilously close he was coming to that necessity and he had already
learned that he must not resort to this refuge in the presence of his friends, because (with the exception of
his brother doctor nelson) it always caused them emotional disturbance. so he made a mighty effort,
slowed down his heart, calmed his emotions, and smiled. "i will waiting till a grokking comes of itself."
 "that's better," agreed jubal. "but hereafter, before you read anything, ask me or ask jill, or
somebody, whether or not it is fiction. i don't want you to get mixed up."

nominal chief of delegation for his nation, his status under strict protocol was merely that of
assemblyman-but jubal was not even mildly surprised to see the harried assistant chief of protocol drop
what he was doing and rush to seat douglas' chief political enemy at the main table and near the seat
reserved for the secretary general; it simply reinforced jubal's opinion that douglas was no fool.
 dr. nelson, surgeon of the champion, and captain van tromp, her skipper, came in together,
and were greeted with delight by mike. jubal was pleased, too, as it gave the boy something to do,
under the cameras, instead of just sitting still like a dummy. jubal made use of the disturbance to
rearrange the seating since there was now no longer any need to surround the man from mars with a
bodyguard. he placed mike precisely opposite the secretary general's chair and himself took the chair

else is honest-and you are usually right. no, nobody is going to try to poison you . . . but your wife might
collect your insurance simply because you shared a dish with mike."
 "you really think that?"
 "sven, i'll order anything

 she looked thoughtful. "i could look into it."
 "you do that. and come stay with us when you aren't so busy. stay as long as you like and never
wear your hurtin' shoes the whole time. you'll like the boy. he's as weird as snake's suspenders but
sweet as a stolen kiss, too."
 "uh... i will. as soon as i can. thanks, doc."
 they said good-by and jubal returned to find that dr. nelson had taken mike into one of the
bedrooms and was checking him over. he joined them to offer nelson the use of his kit since nelson had
not had with him his professional bag.
 jubal found mike stripped down and the ship's surgeon looking baffled. "doctor," nelson said,
almost angrily, "i saw this patient only ten days ago. tell me where he got those muscles?"
 "why, he sent in a coupon from the back cover of rut: the magazine for he-men. you know,
the ad that tells how a ninety-pound weakling can

 "doctor, please!"
 "why don't you ask him?" jubal suggested.

 nelson did so. "i thinked them," mike answered.
 "that's right," jubal agreed. "he 'thinked' 'em. when i got him, just over a week ago, he was a
mess, slight, flabby, and pale. looked as if he had been raised in a cave-which i gather he was, more or
less. so i told him he had to grow strong. so he did."
 "exercises?" nelson said doubtfully.
 "nothing systematic. swimming, when and as he wished."
 "a week of swimming won't make a man look as if he had been sweating over bar bells for
years!" nelson frowned. "i am aware that mike has voluntary control over the so-called 'involuntary'
muscles, but that is not entirely without precedent. this, on the other hand, requires one to assume that-"
 "doctor," jubal said gently, "why don't you just admit that you don't grok it and save the wear
and tear?"
 nelson sighed. "i m

 "but your concepts of strategy are neanderthal."
 caxton sighed. "i feel better, jubal. for a moment there i thought you had become softly
sentimental in your old age."
 "when i do, please shoot me. captain, how many men did you leave on mars?"
 "twenty-three."
 "and what is their status, under the larkin decision?"
 van tromp looked troubled. "i'm not supposed to talk."
 "then don't," jubal reassured him. "i can deduce it, and so can ben."
 dr. nelson said, "skipper, both stinky and i are civilians again. i shall talk where and how i
please-"
 "and shall i," agreed mahmoud.
 "-and if they want to make trouble for me, they know what they can do with my reserve
commission. what business has the government, telling us we can't talk? those chair-warmers didn't go
to mars. we did."
 "stow it, sven. i intended to talk-these are our water brothers. but, ben, i would rather not see
this in your column. i would like to command a space ship again."

for his martian masters. it is even possible that they are in
telepathic contact with him at all times, that he doesn't even need to report back. i don't know- but i do
know that, after visiting mars, i find such ideas much easier to swallow . . . and i know this: everybody
seems to take it for granted that, finding a human being on mars, we would of course bring him home and
that he would be anxious to come home. nothing could be further from the truth. eh, sven?"
 "mike hated the idea," agreed nelson. "we couldn't even get close to him at first; he was afraid
of us. then he was ordered to go back with us and from then on he did exactly what we told him to do.
he behaved like a soldier carrying out with perfect discipline orders that scared him silly."
 "just a moment," caxton protested. "captain, even so-mars attack us? mars? you know more
about these things than i do, but wouldn't that be about like us attacking jupiter? i mean to say, we have
about two and a half times the surface gravity

 learned years ago never to argue with a
specialist; you can't win. but i also learned that the history of progress is a long, long list of specialists
who were dead wrong when they were most certain-sor1~y, stinky."
 "you're quite right, captain-only i'm not wrong this time."
 "as may be, all mike can settle is whether or not he knows a certain word . . . which might be
like asking a two-year-old to define 'calculus.' proves nothing. i'd like to stick to facts for a moment.
sven? about agnew?"
 nelson answered, "it's up to you, captain"
 "well ... this is still private conversation among water brothers, gentlemen. lieutenant agnew was

our junior medical officer. quite brilliant in his line, sven tells me, and i had no complaints about him
otherwise; he was well-enough liked. but he had an unsuspected latent xenophobia. not against humans.
but he couldn't stand martians. now i bad given orders against going armed out

 shortly thereafter jubal declined to be jockeyed into a seat at the head of a long table, grabbed
one elsewhere. patty sat at one end; the head chair remained vacant . . . except for an eerie feeling which
jubal suppressed that the man from mars was sitting there and that everyone present but himself could
see him_whith was true only in some cases.
 across the table from him was dr. nelson.
 jubal discovered that he would have been surprised only if dr. nelson had not been present. he
nodded and said, "hi, sven."
 "hi, doc. share water."
 "never thirst. what are you around here? staff physician?" nelson shook his bead. "medical
student."
 "so. learn anything?"
 "i've learned that medicine isn't necessary."
 "if youda ast me, i coulda told yah. seen van?"
 "he ought to be in sometime late tonight or early tomorrow. his ship grounded today."
 "does he always come here?" inquired ju

 "call him an extension student. he can't spend much time here."
 "well, it will be good to see him. i haven't laid eyes on him for a year and half, about." jubal
picked up a conversation with the man on his right while nelson talked with dorcas on his right. jubal
noticed the same tingling expectancy at the table which he had felt before, but reinforced. yet there was
still nothing he could put his finger on_lust a quiet family dinner in relaxed intimacy. once, a glass of
water was passed all around the table, but, if there was ritual of words with it, they were spoken too low
to carry. when it reached jubal's placer he took a sip and passed it along to the girl on his
left-round-eyed and too awed to make chit-chat

. then we got to work on it together. 'faith' healing. a miracle. the clinic called it
'spontaneous remission' which i grok means 'i got well.'"
 jubal nodded. "professional double-talk. some cancers go away, we don't know why."
 "i know why this one went away. by then i was beginning to control my own body. with mike's
help i repaired the damage. now i can do it without his help. want to feel a heart stop beating?"
 "thanks, i have observed it in mike, many times. my esteemed colleague, croaker nelson,
would not be sitting across from us if what you are talking about was 'faith healing.' it's voluntary control

of the body. i grok."
 "sorry. we all know that you do. we know."
 "mmm ... i dislike to call mike a liar because he isn't. but the lad happens to be prejudiced in my
case."
 sam shook his head. "i've been talking with you all through dinner. i wanted to check it myself,
despite what mike said. you grok. i'm w
