ity. the pupil reasserted itself quickly, this half-disclosed nature fell again under the reign of prudence, and her astrakhan jacket, moulding a bosom of a certain fullness, struck the note of defiance more definitely.
he met her again a few weeks afterwards at a concert in earlsfort terrace and seized the moments when her daughter’s attention was diverted to become intimate. she alluded once or twice to her husband but her tone was not such as to make the allusion a warning. her name was mrs sinico. her husband’s great-great-grandfather had come from leghorn. her husband was captain of a mercantile boat plying between dublin and holland; and they had one child.
meeting her a third time by accident he found courage to make an appointment. she came. this was the first of many meetings; they met always in the evening and chose the most quiet quarters for their walks together. mr duffy, however, had a distaste for underhand ways and, finding that they were compelled to meet stealthily, he f

orced her to ask him to her house. captain sinico encouraged his visits, thinking that his daughter’s hand was in question. he had dismissed his wife so sincerely from his gallery of pleasures that he did not suspect that anyone else would take an interest in her. as the husband was often away and the daughter out giving music lessons mr duffy had many opportunities of enjoying the lady’s society. neither he nor she had had any such adventure before and neither was conscious of any incongruity. little by little he entangled his thoughts wi

times he caught himself listening to the sound of his own voice. he thought that in her eyes he would ascend to an angelical stature; and, as he attached the fervent nature of his companion more and more closely to him, he heard the strange impersonal voice which he recognised as his own, insisting on the soul’s incurable loneliness. we cannot give ourselves, it said: we are our own. the end of these discourses was that one night during which she had shown every sign of unusual excitement, mrs sinico caught up his hand passionately and pressed it to her cheek.
mr duffy was very much surprised. her interpretation of his words disillusioned him. he did not visit her for a week, then he wrote to her asking her to meet him. as he did not wish their last interview to be troubled by the influence of their ruined confessional they met in a little cakeshop near the parkgate. it was cold autumn weather but in spite of the cold they wandered up and down the roads of the park for nearly three hours. t

four years passed. mr duffy returned to his even way of life. his room still bore witness of the orderliness of his mind. some new pieces of music encumbered the music-stand in the lower room and on his shelves stood two volumes by nietzsche: thus spake zarathustra and the gay science. he wrote seldom in the sheaf of papers which lay in his desk. one of his sentences, written two months after his last interview with mrs sinico, read: love between man and man is impossible because there must not be sexual intercourse and friendship between man and woman is impossible because there must be sexual intercourse. he kept away from concerts lest he should meet her. his father died; the junior partner of the bank retired. and still every morning he went into the city by tram and every evening walked home from the city after having dined moderately in george’s street and read the evening paper for dessert.

               death of a lady at sydney parade
                       a painful case
today at the city of dublin hospital the deputy coroner (in the absence of mr leverett) held an inquest on the body of mrs emily sinico, aged forty-three years, who was killed at sydney parade station yesterday evening. the evidence showed that the deceased lady, while attempting to cross the line, was knocked down by the engine of the ten o’clock slow train from kingstown, thereby sustaining injuries of the head and right side which led to her death.
james lennon, driver of the engine, stated that he had been in the employment of the railway company for fifteen years. on hearing the guard’s whistle he set the train in moti

y, on behalf of the railway company, expressed his deep regret at the accident. the company had always taken every precaution to prevent people crossing the lines except by the bridges, both by placing notices in every station and by the use of patent spring gates at level crossings. the deceased had been in the habit of crossing the lines late at night from platform to platform and, in view of certain other circumstances of the case, he did not think the railway officials were to blame.
captain sinico, of leoville, sydney parade, husband of the deceased, also gave evidence. he stated that the deceased was his wife. he was not in dublin at the time of the accident as he had arrived only that morning from rotterdam. they had been married for twenty-two years and had lived happily until about two years ago when his wife began to be rather intemperate in her habits.
miss mary sinico said that of late her mother had been in the habit of going out at night to buy spirits. she, witness, had often t

ried to reason with her mother and had induced her to join a league. she was not at home until an hour after the accident. the jury returned a verdict in accordance with the medical evidence and exonerated lennon from all blame.
the deputy coroner said it was a most painful case, and expressed great sympathy with captain sinico and his daughter. he urged on the railway company to take strong measures to prevent the possibility of similar accidents in the future. no blame attached to anyone.

mr duffy raised his eyes from the paper and gazed out of his window on the cheerless evening landscape. the river lay quiet beside the empty distillery and from time to time a light appeared in some house on the lucan road. what an end! the whole narrative of her death revolted him and it revolted him to think that he had ever spo
