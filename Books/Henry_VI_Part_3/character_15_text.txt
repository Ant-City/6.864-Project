yorke. oh clifford, but bethinke thee once againe,
and in thy thought ore-run my former time:
and if thou canst, for blushing, view this face,
and bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice,
whose frowne hath made thee faint and flye ere this

   clifford. i will not bandie with thee word for word,
but buckler with thee blowes twice two for one

i would prolong a while the traytors life:
wrath makes him deafe; speake thou northumberland

   northumb. hold clifford, doe not honor him so much,
to prick thy finger, though to wound his heart.
what valour were it, when a curre doth grinne,
for one to thrust his hand betweene his teeth,
when he might spurne him with his foot away?
it is warres prize, to take all vantages,
and tenne to one, is no impeach of valour

that raught at mountaines with out-stretched armes,
yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
what, was it you that would be englands king?
was't you that reuell'd in our parliament,
and made a preachment of your high descent?
where are your messe of sonnes, to back you now?
the wanton edward, and the lustie george?
and where's that valiant crook-back prodigie,

hard-hearted clifford, take me from the world,

i should not for my life but weepe with him,

  edward. i wonder how our princely father scap't:
or whether he be scap't away, or no,
from cliffords and northumberlands pursuit?
had he been ta'ne, we should haue heard the newes;
had he beene slaine, we should haue heard the newes:
or had he scap't, me thinkes we should haue heard
the happy tidings of his good escape.
how fares my brother? why is he so sad?
  richard. i cannot ioy, vntill i be resolu'd
where our right valiant father is become.
i saw him in the battaile range about,
and watcht him how he singled clifford forth.

but in this troublous time, what's to be done?
shall we go throw away our coates of steele,
and wrap our bodies in blacke mourning gownes,
numb'ring our aue-maries with our beads?
or shall we on the helmets of our foes
tell our deuotion with reuengefull armes?

and therefore comes my brother mountague:

and of their feather, many moe proud birds,
haue wrought the easie-melting king, like wax.
he swore consent to your succession,
his oath enrolled in the parliament.
and now to london all the crew are gone,
to frustrate both his oath, and what beside
may make against the house of lancaster.
their power (i thinke) is thirty thousand strong:

  king. once more we sit in englands royall throne,
re-purchac'd with the blood of enemies:
what valiant foe-men, like to autumnes corne,
haue we mow'd downe in tops of all their pride?
three dukes of somerset, threefold renowne,
for hardy and vndoubted champions:
two cliffords, as the father and the sonne,
and two northumberlands: two brauer men,
ne're spurr'd their coursers at the trumpets sound.
with them, the two braue beares, warwick & montague,
that in their chaines fetter'd the kingly lyon,
and made the forrest tremble when they roar'd.
thus haue we swept suspition from our seate,
and made our footstoole of security.
