who
ruled it, and got all the graft, had to be elected first; and so there
were two rival sets of grafters, known as political parties, and the one
got the office which bought the most votes. now and then, the election
was very close, and that was the time the poor man came in. in the
stockyards this was only in national and state elections, for in local
elections the democratic party always carried everything. the ruler of
the district was therefore the democratic boss, a little irishman named
mike scully. scully held an important party office in the state, and
bossed even the mayor of the city, it was said; it was his boast that he
carried the stockyards in his pocket. he was an enormously rich man--he
had a hand in all the big graft in the neighborhood. it was scully, for
instance, who owned that dump which jurgis and ona had seen the first
day of their arrival. not only did he own the dump, but he owned the
brick factory as well, and first he took out the clay and made it into
bricks, and the

it was quite a story. little juozapas, who was near crazy with hunger
these days, had gone out on the street to beg for himself. juozapas had
only one leg, having been run over by a wagon when a little child,
but he had got himself a broomstick, which he put under his arm for a
crutch. he had fallen in with some other children and found the way to
mike scully’s dump, which lay three or four blocks away. to this place
there came every day many hundreds of wagon-loads of garbage and trash
from the lake front, where the rich people lived; and in the heaps the
children raked for food--there were hunks of bread and potato peelings
and apple cores and meat bones, all of it half frozen and quite
unspoiled. little juozapas gorged himself, and came home with a
newspaper full, which he was feeding to antanas when his mother came in.

onist. the people of
packingtown had borne about all that they would bear, and it looked as
if a strike might begin any week.

after this talk the man made inquiries concerning jurgis, and a couple
of days later he came to him with an interesting proposition. he was
not absolutely certain, he said, but he thought that he could get him
a regular salary if he would come to packingtown and do as he was told,
and keep his mouth shut. harper--“bush” harper, he was called--was a
right-hand man of mike scully, the democratic boss of the stockyards;
and in the coming election there was a peculiar situation. there had
come to scully a proposition to nominate a certain rich brewer who lived
upon a swell boulevard that skirted the district, and who coveted the
big badge and the “honorable” of an alderman. the brewer was a jew, and
had no brains, but he was harmless, and would put up a rare campaign
fund. scully had accepted the offer, and then gone to the republicans
with a proposition. he was not s

a, who had called himself one, and
would go out with a couple of other men and a soap-box, and shout
himself hoarse on a street corner saturday nights. tamoszius had tried
to explain to jurgis what it was all about, but jurgis, who was not of
an imaginative turn, had never quite got it straight; at present he was
content with his companion’s explanation that the socialists were the
enemies of american institutions--could not be bought, and would not
combine or make any sort of a “dicker.” mike scully was very much
worried over the opportunity which his last deal gave to them--the
stockyards democrats were furious at the idea of a rich capitalist
for their candidate, and while they were changing they might possibly
conclude that a socialist firebrand was preferable to a republican bum.
and so right here was a chance for jurgis to make himself a place in
the world, explained “bush” harper; he had been a union man, and he
was known in the yards as a workingman; he must have hundreds of

uaintances, and as he had never talked politics with them he might
come out as a republican now without exciting the least suspicion. there
were barrels of money for the use of those who could deliver the goods;
and jurgis might count upon mike scully, who had never yet gone back on
a friend. just what could he do? jurgis asked, in some perplexity, and
the other explained in detail. to begin with, he would have to go to the
yards and work, and he mightn’t relish that; but he would have what he
earned, as well as the rest that came to him. he would get active in the
union again, and perhaps try to get an office, as he, harper, had; he
would tell all his friends the good points of doyle, the republican
nominee, and the bad ones of the “she

wd his department and spoil the record he was trying to make--but
he said not a word except “all right.”

and so jurgis became a workingman once more; and straightway he sought
out his old friends, and joined the union, and began to “root” for
“scotty” doyle. doyle had done him a good turn once, he explained,
and was really a bully chap; doyle was a workingman himself, and would
represent the workingmen--why did they want to vote for a millionaire
“sheeny,” and what the hell had mike scully ever done for them that they
should back his candidates all the time? and meantime scully had given
jurgis a note to the republican leader of the ward, and he had gone
there and met the crowd he was to work with. already they had hired
a big hall, with some of the brewer’s money, and every night jurgis
brought in a dozen new members of the “doyle republican association.”
 pretty soon they had a grand opening night; and there was a brass band,
which marched through the streets, and firewor

 campaign he handled
many hundreds of dollars of the hebrew brewer’s money, administering it
with naive and touching fidelity. toward the end, however, he learned
that he was regarded with hatred by the rest of the “boys,” because he
compelled them either to make a poorer showing than he or to do without
their share of the pie. after that jurgis did his best to please them,
and to make up for the time he had lost before he discovered the extra
bungholes of the campaign barrel.

he pleased mike scully, also. on election morning he was out at four
o’clock, “getting out the vote”; he had a two-horse carriage to ride in,
and he went from house to house for his friends, and escorted them in
triumph to the polls. he voted half a dozen times himself, and voted
some of his friends as often; he brought bunch after bunch of the newest
foreigners--lithuanians, poles, bohemians, slovaks--and when he had put
them through the mill he turned them over to another man to take to

chapter 26


after the elections jurgis stayed on in packingtown and kept his
job. the agitation to break up the police protection of criminals was
continuing, and it seemed to him best to “lay low” for the present. he
had nearly three hundred dollars in the bank, and might have considered
himself entitled to a vacation; but he had an easy job, and force of
habit kept him at it. besides, mike scully, whom he consulted, advised
him that something might “turn up” before long.

jurgis got himself a place in a boardinghouse with some congenial
friends. he had already inquired of aniele, and learned that elzbieta
and her family had gone downtown, and so he gave no further thought
to them. he went with a new set, now, young unmarried fellows who were
“sporty.” jurgis had long ago cast off his fertilizer clothing, and
since going into politics he had donned a linen collar and a greasy red

t and got it, and hurried to
the court, and explained to the magistrate that jurgis was a
decent fellow and a friend of scully’s, who had been attacked by a
strike-breaker. so the bail was reduced to three hundred dollars, and
harper went on it himself; he did not tell this to jurgis, however--nor
did he tell him that when the time for trial came it would be an easy
matter for him to avoid the forfeiting of the bail, and pocket the three
hundred dollars as his reward for the risk of offending mike scully! all
that he told jurgis was that he was now free, and that the best thing
he could do was to clear out as quickly as possible; and so jurgis
overwhelmed with gratitude and relief, took the dollar and fourteen
cents that was left him out of all his bank account, and put it with the
two dollars and quarter that was left from his last night’s celebration,
and boarded a streetcar and got off at the other end of chicago.

wage-earners of the nation.

so jurgis found himself in a large hall, elaborately decorated with
flags and bunting; and after the chairman had made his little speech,
and the orator of the evening rose up, amid an uproar from the
band--only fancy the emotions of jurgis upon making the discovery
that the personage was none other than the famous and eloquent senator
spareshanks, who had addressed the “doyle republican association” at
the stockyards, and helped to elect mike scully’s tenpin setter to the
chicago board of aldermen!

in truth, the sight of the senator almost brought the tears into
jurgis’s eyes. what agony it was to him to look back upon those golden
hours, when he, too, had a place beneath the shadow of the plum tree!
when he, too, had been of the elect, through whom the country is
governed--when he had had a bung in the campaign barrel for his own! and
this was another election in which the republicans had all the money;
and but for that one hideous a
