 as you are kind enough to inform me why you are ernest in town and jack in the country.

jack.  well, produce my cigarette case first.

algernon.  here it is.  [hands cigarette case.]  now produce your explanation, and pray make it improbable.  [sits on sofa.]

jack.  my dear fellow, there is nothing improbable about my explanation at all.  in fact it’s perfectly ordinary.  old mr. thomas cardew, who adopted me when i was a little boy, made me in his will guardian to his grand-daughter, miss cecily cardew.  cecily, who addresses me as her uncle from motives of respect that you could not possibly appreciate, lives at my place in the country under the charge of her admirable governess, miss prism.

algernon.  where is that place in the country, by the way?

jack.  that is nothing to you, dear boy.  you are not going to be invited . . . i may tell you candidly that the place is not in shropshire.

algernon.  i suspected that, my dear fellow!  i have bunburyed all over shropshire on two separate occ

to be back soon.  and you can bring tea.

merriman.  yes, miss.  [goes out.]

cecily.  miss fairfax!  i suppose one of the many good elderly women who are associated with uncle jack in some of his philanthropic work in london.  i don’t quite like women who are interested in philanthropic work.  i think it is so forward of them.

merriman.  miss fairfax.

[enter gwendolen.]

[exit merriman.]

cecily.  [advancing to meet her.]  pray let me introduce myself to you.  my name is cecily cardew.

gwendolen.  cecily cardew?  [moving to her and shaking hands.]  what a very sweet name!  something tells me that we are going to be great friends.  i like you already more than i can say.  my first impressions of people are never wrong.

cecily.  how nice of you to like me so much after we have known each other such a comparatively short time.  pray sit down.

gwendolen.  [still standing up.]  i may call you cecily, may i not?

cecily.  with pleasure!

gwendolen.  and you will always call me

live, that is what i mean—so bunbury died.

lady bracknell.  he seems to have had great confidence in the opinion of his physicians.  i am glad, however, that he made up his mind at the last to some definite course of action, and acted under proper medical advice.  and now that we have finally got rid of this mr. bunbury, may i ask, mr. worthing, who is that young person whose hand my nephew algernon is now holding in what seems to me a peculiarly unnecessary manner?

jack.  that lady is miss cecily cardew, my ward.  [lady bracknell bows coldly to cecily.]

algernon.  i am engaged to be married to cecily, aunt augusta.

lady bracknell.  i beg your pardon?

cecily.  mr. moncrieff and i are engaged to be married, lady bracknell.

lady bracknell.  [with a shiver, crossing to the sofa and sitting down.]  i do not know whether there is anything peculiarly exciting in the air of this particular part of hertfordshire, but the number of engagements that go on seems to me considerably above the proper ave
