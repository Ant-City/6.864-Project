silent.  he thought about the words which
govinda had said to him and thought the words through to their end.

yes, he thought, standing there with his head low, what would remain of
all that which seemed to us to be holy?  what remains?  what can stand
the test?  and he shook his head.

at one time, when the two young men had lived among the samanas for
about three years and had shared their exercises, some news, a rumour, a
myth reached them after being retold many times:  a man had appeared,
gotama by name, the exalted one, the buddha, he had overcome the
suffering of the world in himself and had halted the cycle of rebirths.
he was said to wander through the land, teaching, surrounded by
disciples, without possession, without home, without a wife, in the
yellow cloak of an ascetic, but with a cheerful brow, a man of bliss,
and brahmans and princes would bow down before him and would become his
students.

this myth, this rumour, this legend resounded, its fragrants rose up,
here and there

; in the towns, the brahmans spoke of it and in the
forest, the samanas; again and again, the name of gotama, the buddha
reached the ears of the young men, with good and with bad talk, with
praise and with defamation.

it was as if the plague had broken out in a country and news had been
spreading around that in one or another place there was a man, a wise
man, a knowledgeable one, whose word and breath was enough to heal
everyone who had been infected with the pestilence, and as such news
would go through the land and everyone would talk about it, many would
believe, many would doubt, but many would

get on their way as soon as
possible, to seek the wise man, the helper, just like this this myth
ran through the land, that fragrant myth of gotama, the buddha, the
wise man of the family of sakya.  he possessed, so the believers said,
the highest enlightenment, he remembered his previous lives, he had
reached the nirvana and never returned into the cycle, was never again
submerged in the murky river of physical forms.  many wonderful and
unbelievable things were reported of him, he had performed miracles,
had overcome the devil, had spoken to the gods.  but his enemies and
disbelievers said, this gotama was a vain seducer, he would spent

 news of him, the exalted one, the sakyamuni.

the myth had also reached the samanas in the forest, and also
siddhartha, and also govinda, slowly, drop by drop, every drop laden
with hope, every drop laden with doubt.  they rarely talked about it,
because the oldest one of the samanas did not like this myth.  he had
heard that this alleged buddha used to be an ascetic before and had
lived in the forest, but had then turned back to luxury and worldly
pleasures, and he had no high opinion of this gotama.

"oh siddhartha," govinda spoke one day to his friend.  "today, i was
in the village, and a brahman invited me into his house, and in his
house, there was the son of a brahman from magadha, who has seen the
buddha with his own eyes and has heard him teach.  verily, this made
my chest ache when i breathed, and thought to myself:  if only i would
too, if only we both would too, siddhartha and me, live to see the
hour when we will hear the teachings from the mouth of this perfected
man!  speak, f

if you
only remembered the other thing as well, you've heard from me, which is
that i have grown distrustful and tired against teachings and learning,
and that my faith in words, which are brought to us by teachers, is
small.  but let's do it, my dear, i am willing to listen to these
teachings--though in my heart i believe that we've already tasted the
best fruit of these teachings."

quoth govinda:  "your willingness delights my heart.  but tell me, how
should this be possible?  how should the gotama's teachings, even before
we have heard them, have already revealed their best fruit to us?"

quoth siddhartha:  "let us eat this fruit and wait for the rest, oh
govinda!  but this fruit, which we already now received thanks to the
gotama, consisted in him calling us away from the samanas!  whether he
has also other and better things to give us, oh friend, let us await
with calm hearts."

on this very same day, siddhartha informed the oldest one of the samanas
of his decision, that he wanted to

spoke stammeringly a godly wish for a good journey.  and the young men
returned the bows with thanks, returned the wish, went on their way with
salutations.

on the way, govinda said:  "oh siddhartha, you have learned more from
the samanas than i knew.  it is hard, it is very hard to cast a spell
on an old samana.  truly, if you had stayed there, you would soon have
learned to walk on water."

"i do not seek to walk on water," said siddhartha.  "let old samanas be
content with such feats!"




gotama

in the town of savathi, every child knew the name of the exalted buddha,
and every house was prepared to fill the alms-dish of gotama's
disciples, the silently begging ones.  near the town was gotama's
favourite place to stay, the grove of jetavana, which the rich merchant
anathapindika, an obedient worshipper of the exalted one, had given him
and his people for a gift.

all tales and answers, which the two young ascetics had received in
their search for gotama's abode, had pointed them toward

seen him with your own eyes?"

quoth the woman:  "many times i have seen him, the exalted one.  on many
days, i have seen him, walking through the alleys in silence, wearing
his yellow cloak, presenting his alms-dish in silence at the doors of
the houses, leaving with a filled dish."

delightedly, govinda listened and wanted to ask and hear much more.
but siddhartha urged him to walk on.  they thanked and left and hardly
had to ask for directions, for rather many pilgrims and monks as well
from gotama's community were on their way to the jetavana.  and since
they reached it at night, there were constant arrivals, shouts, and
talk of those who sought shelter and got it.  the two samanas,
accustomed to life in the forest, found quickly and without making any
noise a place to stay and rested there until the morning.

at sunrise, they saw with astonishment what a large crowd of believers
and curious people had spent the night here.  on all paths of the
marvellous grove, monks walked in yellow ro

inwardly.  with a hidden smile, quiet, calm, somewhat resembling a
healthy child, the buddha walked, wore the robe and placed his feet
just as all of his monks did, according to a precise rule.  but his
face and his walk, his quietly lowered glance, his quietly dangling hand
and even every finger of his quietly dangling hand expressed peace,
expressed perfection, did not search, did not imitate, breathed softly
in an unwhithering calm, in an unwhithering light, an untouchable peace.

thus gotama walked towards the town, to collect alms, and the two
samanas recognised him solely by the perfection of his calm, by the
quietness of his appearance, in which there was no searching, no desire,
no imitation, no effort to be seen, only light and peace.

"today, we'll hear the teachings from his mouth." said govinda.

siddhartha did not answer.  he felt little curiosity for the teachings,
he did not believe that they would teach him anything new, but he had,
just as govinda had, heard the conten

ts of this buddha's teachings
again and again, though these reports only represented second- or
third-hand information.  but attentively he looked at gotama's head,
his shoulders, his feet, his quietly dangling hand, and it seemed to
him as if every joint of every finger of this hand was of these
teachings, spoke of, breathed of, exhaled the fragrant of, glistened of
truth.  this man, this buddha was truthful down to the gesture of his
last finger.  this man was holy.  never before, siddhartha had venerated
a person so much, never before he had loved a person as much as this
one.

they both followed the buddha until they reached the town and then

eturned in silence, for they themselves intended to abstain from
on this day.  they saw gotama returning--what he ate could not even have
satisfied a bird's appetite, and they saw him retiring into the shade
of the mango-trees.

but in the evening, when the heat cooled down and everyone in the camp
started to bustle about and gathered around, they heard the buddha
teaching.  they heard his voice, and it was also perfected, was of
perfect calmness, was full of peace.  gotama taught the teachings of
suffering, of the origin of suffering, of the way to relieve suffering.
calmly and clearly his quiet speech flowed on.  suffering was life,
full of suffering was the world, but salvation from suffering had been
found:  salvation was obtained by him who would walk the path of the
buddha.  with a soft, yet firm voice the exalted one spoke, taught the
four main doctrines, taught the eightfold path, patiently he went the
usual path of the teachings, of the examples, of the r

epetitions,
brightly and quietly his voice hovered over the listeners, like a light,
like a starry sky.

when the buddha--night had already fallen--ended his speech, many a
pilgrim stepped forward and asked to accepted into the community, sought
refuge in the teachings.  and gotama accepted them by speaking:  "you
have heard the teachings well, it has come to you well.  thus join us
and walk in holiness, to put an end to all suffering."

behold, then govinda, the shy one, also stepped forward and spoke:  "i
also take my refuge in the exalted one and his teachings," and he asked
to accepted into the community of his disciples and was accepted.

right afterwards, when the buddha had retired for the night, govinda
turned to siddhartha and spoke eagerly:  "siddhartha, it is n

and your parents, renounced your birth and possessions, renounced your
free will, renounced all friendship.  this is what the teachings
require, this is what the exalted one wants.  this is what you wanted
for yourself.  tomorrow, oh govinda, i'll leave you."

for a long time, the friends continued walking in the grove; for a long
time, they lay there and found no sleep.  and over and over again,
govinda urged his friend, he should tell him why he would not want to
seek refuge in gotama's teachings, what fault he would find in these
teachings.  but siddhartha turned him away every time and said:  "be
content, govinda!  very good are the teachings of the exalted one, how
could i find a fault in them?"

very early in the morning, a follower of buddha, one of his oldest
monks, went through the garden and called all those to him who had as
novices taken their refuge in the teachings, to dress them up in the
yellow robe and to instruct them in the first teachings and duties of

r position.  then govinda broke loose, embraced once again his
childhood friend and left with the novices.

but siddhartha walked through the grove, lost in thought.

then he happened to meet gotama, the exalted one, and when he greeted
him with respect and the buddha's glance was so full of kindness and
calm, the young man summoned his courage and asked the venerable one for
the permission to talk to him.  silently the exalted one nodded his
approval.

quoth siddhartha:  "yesterday, oh exalted one, i had been privileged to
hear your wondrous teachings.  together with my friend, i had come from
afar, to hear your teachings.  and now my friend is going to stay with
your people, he has taken

nevertheless broken in one place, through a small gap, this world of
unity is invaded by something alien, something new, something which had
not been there before, and which cannot be demonstrated and cannot be
proven: these are your teachings of overcoming the world, of salvation.
but with this small gap, with this small breach, the entire eternal and
uniform law of the world is breaking apart again and becomes void.
please forgive me for expressing this objection."

quietly, gotama had listened to him, unmoved.  now he spoke, the
perfected one, with his kind, with his polite and clear voice:  "you've
heard the teachings, oh son of a brahman, and good for you that you've
thought about it thus deeply.  you've found a gap in it, an error.  you
should think about this further.  but be warned, oh seeker of knowledge,
of the thicket of opinions and of arguing about words.  there is nothing

me, are no opinion, and their goal is not to explain the world to those
who seek knowledge.  they have a different goal; their goal is salvation
from suffering.  this is what gotama teaches, nothing else."

"i wish that you, oh exalted one, would not be angry with me," said the
young man.  "i have not spoken to you like this to argue with you, to
argue about words.  you are truly right, there is little to opinions.
but let me say this one more thing:  i have not doubted in you for a
single moment.  i have not doubted for a single moment that you are
buddha, that you have reached the goal, the highest goal towards which
so many thousands of brahmans and sons of brahmans are

salvation from the self is what we samanas search for, oh exalted one.
if i merely were one of your disciples, oh venerable one, i'd fear that
it might happen to me that only seemingly, only deceptively my self
would be calm and be redeemed, but that in truth it would live on and
grow, for then i had replaced my self with the teachings, my duty to
follow you, my love for you, and the community of the monks!"

with half of a smile, with an unwavering openness and kindness,
gotama looked into the stranger's eyes and bid him to leave with a
hardly noticeable gesture.

"you are wise, oh samana.", the venerable one spoke.

"you know how to talk wisely, my friend.  be aware of too much wisdom!"

the buddha turned away, and his glance and half of a smile remained
forever etched in siddhartha's memory.

i have never before seen a person glance and smile, sit and walk this
way, he thought; truly, i wish to be able to glance and smile, sit and
walk this way, too, thus free, thus

of my self.

i saw a man, siddhartha thought, a single man, before whom i would have
to lower my glance.  i do not want to lower my glance before any other,
not before any other.  no teachings will entice me any more, since this
man's teachings have not enticed me.

i am deprived by the buddha, thought siddhartha, i am deprived, and
even more he has given to me.  he has deprived me of my friend, the one
who had believed in me and now believes in him, who had been my shadow
and is now gotama's shadow.  but he has given me siddhartha, myself.




awakening

when siddhartha left the grove, where the buddha, the perfected one,
stayed behind, where govinda stayed behind, then he felt that in this
grove his past life also stayed behind and parted from him.  he pondered
about this sensation, which filled him completely, as he was slowly
walking along.  he pondered deeply, like diving into a deep water he
let himself sink down to the ground of the sensation, down to the place
where the ca

on the way, siddhartha also remembered everything he had experienced in
the garden jetavana, the teaching he had heard there, the divine buddha,
the farewell from govinda, the conversation with the exalted one.  again
he remembered his own words, he had spoken to the exalted one, every
word, and with astonishment he became aware of the fact that there he
had said things which he had not really known yet at this time.  what he
had said to gotama: his, the buddha's, treasure and secret was not the
teachings, but the unexpressable and not teachable, which he had
experienced in the hour of his enlightenment--it was nothing but this
very thing which he had now gone to experience, what he now began to
experience.  now, he had to experience his self.  it is true that he had
already known for a long time that his self was atman, in its essence
bearing the same eternal characteristics as brahman.  but never, he had
really found this self, beca

fattened on the other hand.  both,
the thoughts as well as the senses, were pretty things, the ultimate
meaning was hidden behind both of them, both had to be listened to, both
had to be played with, both neither had to be scorned nor overestimated,
from both the secret voices of the innermost truth had to be attentively
perceived.  he wanted to strive for nothing, except for what the voice
commanded him to strive for, dwell on nothing, except where the voice
would advise him to do so.  why had gotama, at that time, in the hour
of all hours, sat down under the bo-tree, where the enlightenment hit
him?  he had heard a voice, a voice in his own heart, which had
commanded him to seek rest under this tree, and he had neither preferred
self-castigation, offerings, ablutions, nor prayer, neither food nor
drink, neither sleep nor dream, he had obeyed the voice.  to obey like
this, not to an external command, only to the voice, to be ready like
this, this was good, this was necessary, nothing else w

.  others have it, who are
small children with respect to their mind.  most people, kamala, are
like a falling leaf, which is blown and is turning around through the
air, and wavers, and tumbles to the ground.  but others, a few, are
like stars, they go on a fixed course, no wind reaches them, in
themselves they have their law and their course.  among all the learned
men and samanas, of which i knew many, there was one of this kind, a
perfected one, i'll never be able to forget him.  it is that gotama,
the exalted one, who is spreading that teachings.  thousands of
followers are listening to his teachings every day, follow his
instructions every hour, but they are all falling leaves, not in
themselves they have teachings and a law."

kamala looked at him with a smile.  "again, you're talking about him,"
she said, "again, you're having a samana's thoughts."

siddhartha said nothing, and they played the game of love, one of the
thirty or forty different games kamala knew.  her body was flexibl

was alien to them.

years passed by; surrounded by the good life, siddhartha hardly felt
them fading away.  he had become rich, for quite a while he possessed a
house of his own and his own servants, and a garden before the city by
the river.  the people liked him, they came to him, whenever they needed
money or advice, but there was nobody close to him, except kamala.

that high, bright state of being awake, which he had experienced that
one time at the height of his youth, in those days after gotama's
sermon, after the separation from govinda, that tense expectation, that
proud state of standing alone without teachings and without teachers,
that supple willingness to listen to the divine voice in his own heart,
had slowly become a memory, had been fleeting; distant and quiet, the
holy source murmured, which used to be near, which used to murmur within
himself.  nevertheless, many things he had learned from the samanas, he
had learned from gotama, he had learned from his father the brahman,

f his mind brought on by sex, by wine, and from there he fled
back into the urge to pile up and obtain possessions.  in this pointless
cycle he ran, growing tired, growing old, growing ill.

then the time came when a dream warned him.  he had spend the hours of
the evening with kamala, in her beautiful pleasure-garden.  they had
been sitting under the trees, talking, and kamala had said thoughtful
words, words behind which a sadness and tiredness lay hidden.  she had
asked him to tell her about gotama, and could not hear enough of him,
how clear his eyes, how still and beautiful his mouth, how kind his
smile, how peaceful his walk had been.  for a long time, he had to tell
her about the exalted buddha, and kamala had sighed and had said:  "one
day, perhaps soon, i'll also follow that buddha.  i'll give him my
pleasure-garden for a gift and take my refuge in his teachings."  but
after this, she had aroused him, and had tied him to her in the act
of making love with painful fervour, biting and

thout an ending?  was it necessary to live for this?  no, it
was not necessary!  the name of this game was sansara, a game for
children, a game which was perhaps enjoyable to play once, twice, ten
times--but for ever and ever over again?

then, siddhartha knew that the game was over, that he could not play it
any more.  shivers ran over his body, inside of him, so he felt,
something had died.

that entire day, he sat under the mango-tree, thinking of his father,
thinking of govinda, thinking of gotama.  did he have to leave them to
become a kamaswami?  he still sat there, when the night had fallen.
when, looking up, he caught sight of the stars, he thought:  "here i'm
sitting under my mango-tree, in my pleasure-garden."  he smiled a little
--was it really necessary, was it right, was it not as foolish game,
that he owned a mango-tree, that he owned a garden?

he also put an end to this, this also died in him.  he rose, bid his
farewell to the mango-tree, his farewell to the pleasure-garden.

 or foolish act he had not
committed, a dreariness of the soul he had not brought upon himself?
was it still at all possible to be alive?  was it possible, to breathe
in again and again, to breathe out, to feel hunger, to eat again, to
sleep again, to sleep with a woman again?  was this cycle not exhausted
and brought to a conclusion for him?

siddhartha reached the large river in the forest, the same river over
which a long time ago, when he had still been a young man and came from
the town of gotama, a ferryman had conducted him.  by this river he
stopped, hesitantly he stood at the bank.  tiredness and hunger had
weakened him, and whatever for should he walk on, wherever to, to which
goal?  no, there were no more goals, there was nothing left but the
deep, painful yearning to shake off this whole desolate dream, to spit
out this stale wine, to put an end to this miserable and shameful life.

been sitting here for a long time and been waiting for him to wake up,
though he did not know him.

"i have been sleeping," said siddhartha.  "however did you get here?"

"you have been sleeping," answered govinda.  "it is not good to be
sleeping in such places, where snakes often are and the animals of the
forest have their paths.  i, oh sir, am a follower of the exalted
gotama, the buddha, the sakyamuni, and have been on a pilgrimage
together with several of us on this path, when i saw you lying and
sleeping in a place where it is dangerous to sleep.  therefore, i sought
to wake you up, oh sir, and since i saw that your sleep was very deep,
i stayed behind from my group and sat with you.  and then, so it seems,
i have fallen asleep myself, i who wanted to guard your sleep.  badly,

men living by that ferry.  the curious people asked many questions, but
they got no answers, and they found neither sorcerers nor wise men, they
only found two friendly little old men, who seemed to be mute and to
have become a bit strange and gaga.  and the curious people laughed and
were discussing how foolishly and gullibly the common people were
spreading such empty rumours.

the years passed by, and nobody counted them.  then, at one time, monks
came by on a pilgrimage, followers of gotama, the buddha, who were
asking to be ferried across the river, and by them the ferrymen were
told that they were most hurriedly walking back to their great
teacher, for the news had spread the exalted one was deadly sick and
would soon die his last human death, in order to become one with the
salvation.  it was not long, until a new flock of monks came along on
their pilgrimage, and another one, and the monks as well as most of the
other travellers and people walking through the land spoke of not

else than of gotama and his impending death.  and as people are flocking
from everywhere and from all sides, when they are going to war or to the
coronation of a king, and are gathering like ants in droves, thus they
flocked, like being drawn on by a magic spell, to where the great buddha
was awaiting his death, where the huge event was to take place and the
great perfected one of an era was to become one with the glory.

often, siddhartha thought in those days of the dying wise man, the
great teacher, whose voice

 had admonished nations and had awoken
hundreds of thousands, whose voice he had also once heard, whose holy
face he had also once seen with respect.  kindly, he thought of him, saw
his path to perfection before his eyes, and remembered with a smile
those words which he had once, as a young man, said to him, the exalted
one.  they had been, so it seemed to him, proud and precocious words;
with a smile, he remembered them.  for a long time he knew that there
was nothing standing between gotama and him any more, though he was
still unable to accept his teachings.  no, there was no teaching a
truly searching person, someone who truly wanted to find, could accept.
but he who had found, he could approve of any teachings, every path,
every goal, there was nothing standing between him and all the other
thousand any more who lived in that what is eternal, who breathed what
is divine.

on one of these days, when so many went on a pilgrimage to the dying
buddha, kamala also went to him, who u

on her way due to the news of the near death of gotama, in simple
clothes, on foot.  with her little son, she was travelling by the river;
but the boy had soon grown tired, desired to go back home, desired to
rest, desired to eat, became disobedient and started whining.

kamala often had to take a rest with him, he was accustomed to having
his way against her, she had to feed him, had to comfort him, had to
scold him.  he did not comprehend why he had to go on this exhausting
and sad pilgrimage with his mother, to an unknown place, to a stranger,

siddhartha said nothing, quietly his eyes looked at hers.

"you have achieved it?" she asked.  "you have found peace?"

he smiled and placed his hand on hers.

"i'm seeing it," she said, "i'm seeing it.  i too will find peace."

"you have found it," siddhartha spoke in a whisper.

kamala never stopped looking into his eyes.  she thought about her
pilgrimage to gotama, which wanted to take, in order to see the face of
the perfected one, to breathe his peace, and she thought that she had
now found him in his place, and that it was good, just as good, as if
she had seen the other one.  she wanted to tell this to him, but the
tongue no longer obeyed her will.  without speaking, she looked at him,
and he saw the life fading from her eyes.  when the final pain filled
her eyes and made them grow dim, when the final shiver ran through her
limbs, his finger closed h

"i'm going into the forests, i'm going into the oneness," spoke vasudeva
with a bright smile.

with a bright smile, he left; siddhartha watched him leaving.  with deep
joy, with deep solemnity he watched him leave, saw his steps full of
peace, saw his head full of lustre, saw his body full of light.




govinda

together with other monks, govinda used to spend the time of rest
between pilgrimages in the pleasure-grove, which the courtesan kamala
had given to the followers of gotama for a gift.  he heard talk of an
old ferryman, who lived one day's journey away by the river, and
who was regarded as a wise man by many.  when govinda went back on his
way, he chose the path to the ferry, eager to see the ferryman.
because, though he had lived his entire life by the rules, though he was
also looked upon with veneration by the younger monks on account of his
age and his modesty, the restlessness and the searching still had not
perished from his heart.

he came to the river and

"you're very good to us monks and pilgrims, you have already ferried
many of us across the river.  aren't you too, ferryman, a searcher for
the right path?"

quoth siddhartha, smiling from his old eyes:  "do you call yourself a
searcher, oh venerable one, though you are already of an old in years
and are wearing the robe of gotama's monks?"

"it's true, i'm old," spoke govinda, "but i haven't stopped searching.
never i'll stop searching, this seems to be my destiny.  you too, so it
seems to me, have been searching.  would you like to tell me something,
oh honourable one?"

quoth siddhartha:  "what should i possibly have to tell you, oh
venerable one?  perhaps that you're searching far too much?  that in all
that searching, you don't find the time for finding?"

"how come?" asked govinda.

thinker, but he knew what is necessary just as well as gotama, he was a
perfect man, a saint."

govinda said:  "still, oh siddhartha, you love a bit to mock people, as
it seems to me.  i believe in you and know that you haven't followed a
teacher.  but haven't you found something by yourself, though you've
found no teachings, you still found certain thoughts, certain insights,
which are your own and which help you to live?  if you would like to
tell me some of these, you would delight my heart."

quoth siddhartha:  "i've had thoughts, yes, and insight, ag

 suspected, what has driven me away from the
teachers.  i have found a thought, govinda, which you'll again regard as
a joke or foolishness, but which is my best thought.  it says:  the
opposite of every truth is just as true!  that's like this: any truth
can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided.
everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with
words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness,
roundness, oneness.  when the exalted gotama spoke in his teachings of
the world, he had to divide it into sansara and nirvana, into deception
and truth, into suffering and salvation.  it cannot be done differently,
there is no other way for him who wants to teach.  but the world itself,
what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided.  a person or
an act is never entirely sansara or entirely nirvana, a person is never
entirely holy or entirely sinful.  it does really seem like this,
because we are subject to deception, as if t

tand," spoke govinda.  "but this very thing was discovered
by the exalted one to be a deception.  he commands benevolence,
clemency, sympathy, tolerance, but not love; he forbade us to tie our
heart in love to earthly things."

"i know it," said siddhartha; his smile shone golden.  "i know it,
govinda.  and behold, with this we are right in the middle of the
thicket of opinions, in the dispute about words.  for i cannot deny, my
words of love are in a contradiction, a seeming contradiction with
gotama's words.  for this very reason, i distrust in words so much, for
i know, this contradiction is a deception.  i know that i am in
agreement with gotama.  how should he not know love, he, who has
discovered all elements of human existence in their transitoriness, in
their meaninglessness, and yet loved people thus much, to use a long,
laborious life only to help them, to teach them!  even with him, even
with your great teacher, i prefer the thing over the words, place more
importance on his acts

, and i wish you to have calm days."

(but secretly he thought to himself:  this siddhartha is a bizarre
person, he expresses bizarre thoughts, his teachings sound foolish.
so differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings, clearer, purer,
more comprehensible, nothing strange, foolish, or silly is contained in
them.  but different from his thoughts seemed to me siddhartha's hands
and feet, his eyes, his forehead, his breath, his smile, his greeting,
his walk.  never again, after our exalted gotama has become one with the
nirvana, never since then have i met a person of whom i felt: this is a
holy man!  only him, this siddhartha, i have found to be like this.  may
his teachings be strange, may his words sound foolish; out of his gaze
and his hand, his skin and his hair, out of every part of him shines a
purity, shines a calmness, shines a cheerfulness and mildness and
holiness, which i have seen in no other person since the final death of
our exalted teacher.)

ater, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was siddhartha's smiling
face, which he, govinda, in this very same moment touched with his lips.
and, govinda saw it like this, this smile of the mask, this smile of
oneness above the flowing forms, this smile of simultaneousness above
the thousand births and deaths, this smile of siddhartha was precisely
the same, was precisely of the same kind as the quiet, delicate,
impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps mocking, wise, thousand-fold
smile of gotama, the buddha, as he had seen it himself with great
respect a hundred times.  like this, govinda knew, the perfected ones
are smiling.

not knowing any more whether time existed, whether the vision had lasted
a second or a hundred years, not knowing any more whether there existed
a siddhartha, a gotama, a me and a you, feeling in his innermost self
as if he had been wounded by a divine arrow, the injury of which tasted
sweet, being enchanted and dissolved in his innermost self, govinda
