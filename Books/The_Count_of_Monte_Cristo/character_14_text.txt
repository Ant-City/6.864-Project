 the unknown,
â€œfarewell kindness, humanity, and gratitude! farewell to all the
feelings that expand the heart! i have been heavenâ€™s substitute to
recompense the good--now the god of vengeance yields to me his power to
punish the wicked!â€

at these words he gave a signal, and, as if only awaiting this signal,
the yacht instantly put out to sea.



chapter 31. italy: sinbad the sailor

towards the beginning of the year 1838, two young men belonging to the
first society of paris, the vicomte albert de morcerf and the baron
franz dâ€™epinay, were at florence. they had agreed to see the carnival at
rome that year, and that franz, who for the last three or four years had
inhabited italy, should act as _cicerone_ to albert. as it is no
inconsiderable affair to spend the carnival at rome, especially when you
have no great desire to sleep on the piazza del popolo, or the campo
vaccino, they wrote to signor pastrini, the proprietor of the hÃ´tel de
londres, piazza di spagna, to reserve comfortable apartmen

aracter, and at which franz had already halted five
or six times, and at each time found it more marvellous and striking.

at last he made his way through the mob, which was continually
increasing and getting more and more turbulent, and reached the hotel.
on his first inquiry he was told, with the impertinence peculiar to
hired hackney-coachmen and innkeepers with their houses full, that there
was no room for him at the hÃ´tel de londres. then he sent his card to
signor pastrini, and asked for albert de morcerf. this plan succeeded;
and signor pastrini himself ran to him, excusing himself for having made
his excellency wait, scolding the waiters, taking the candlestick from
the porter, who was ready to pounce on the traveller and was about to
lead him to albert, when morcerf himself appeared.

the apartment consisted of two small rooms and a parlor. the two rooms
looked onto the street--a fact which signor pastrini commented upon as
an inappreciable advantage. the rest of the floor was hired by a very

 of this, albert displayed his most dazzling and
effective costumes each time he visited the theatres; but, alas, his
elegant toilet was wholly thrown away, and one of the most worthy
representatives of parisian fashion had to carry with him the mortifying
reflection that he had nearly overrun italy without meeting with a
single adventure.

sometimes albert would affect to make a joke of his want of success; but
internally he was deeply wounded, and his self-love immensely piqued, to
think that albert de morcerf, the most admired and most sought after of
any young person of his day, should thus be passed over, and merely have
his labor for his pains. and the thing was so much the more annoying,
as, according to the characteristic modesty of a frenchman, albert had
quitted paris with the full conviction that he had only to show himself
in italy to carry all before him, and that upon his return he should
astonish the parisian world with the recital of his numerous love-
affairs.

alas, poor albert! none

of those interesting adventures fell in his way;
the lovely genoese, florentines, and neapolitans were all faithful, if
not to their husbands, at least to their lovers, and thought not of
changing even for the splendid appearance of albert de morcerf; and all
he gained was the painful conviction that the ladies of italy have this
advantage over those of france, that they are faithful even in their
infidelity.

yet he could not restrain a hope that in italy, as elsewhere, there
might be an exception to the general rule.

albert, besides being an elegant, well-looking young man, was also
possessed of considerable talent and ability; moreover, he was a
viscount--a recently created one, certainly, but in the present day it

commanded an income of 50,000 livres, a more than sufficient sum to
render him a personage of considerable importance in paris. it was
therefore no small mortification to him to have visited most of the
principal cities in italy without having excited the most trifling

â€œwhat conditions have i forgotten, your excellency?â€ inquired the
bandit, with the air of a man who, having committed an error, is anxious
to repair it.

â€œwas it not agreed,â€ asked the count, â€œthat not only my person, but also
that of my friends, should be respected by you?â€

â€œand how have i broken that treaty, your excellency?â€

â€œyou have this evening carried off and conveyed hither the vicomte

shudder, â€œthis young gentleman is one of _my friends_--this young
gentleman lodges in the same hotel as myself--this young gentleman has
been up and down the corso for eight hours in my private carriage, and
yet, i repeat to you, you have carried him off, and conveyed him hither,

a ransom on him, as if he were an utter stranger.â€

and what were those events of his early life--a life as marvellous as

i should like to have answered.â€

â€œmy dear franz,â€ replied albert, â€œwhen, upon receipt of my letter, you
found the necessity of asking the countâ€™s assistance, you promptly went
to him, saying, â€˜my friend albert de morcerf is in danger; help me to

come by his name--his fortune? what are his means of existence? what is
his birthplace? of what country is he a native?â€™ tell me, did he put all
these questions to you?â€

assented; and the following afternoon, at half-past five oâ€™clock, the
young men parted. albert de morcerf to return to paris, and franz
dâ€™epinay to pass a fortnight at venice. but, ere he entered his
travelling carriage, albert, fearing that his expected guest might
forget the engagement he had entered into, placed in the care of a
waiter at the hotel a card to be delivered to the count of monte cristo,
on which, beneath the name of vicomte albert de morcerf, he had written
in pencil:

rue du helder, where albert had invited the count of
monte cristo, everything was being prepared on the morning of the 21st
of may to do honor to the occasion. albert de morcerf inhabited a
pavilion situated at the corner of a large court, and directly opposite
another building, in which were the servantsâ€™ apartments. two windows
only of the pavilion faced the street; three other windows looked into
the court, and two at the back into the garden.

between the court and the garden, built in the heavy style of the
imperial architecture, was the large and fashionable dwelling of the
count and countess of morcerf.

call the intelligent egoism of a youth who is charmed with the indolent,

by means of the two windows looking into the street, albert could see
all that passed; the sight of what is going on is necessary to young
men, who always want to see the world traverse their horizon, even if
that horizon is only a public thoroughfare. then, should anything appear
to merit a more minute examination, albert de morcerf could follow up
his researches by means of a small gate, similar to that close to the
_conciergeâ€™s_ door, and which merits a particular description.

it was a little entrance that seemed never to have been opened since the
house was built, so entirely was it covered with dust and dirt; but the
well-oiled hinges and locks told quite another story. this door was a
mockery to the _concierge_, from whose vigilance and jurisdiction it was
free, and, like that famous portal in the _arabian nights_,

pandemonium, in which the artist and the dandy strove for pre-eminence.

there were collected and piled up all albertâ€™s successive caprices,
hunting-horns, bass-viols, flutes--a whole orchestra, for albert had had
not a taste but a fancy for music; easels, palettes, brushes, pencils--
for music had been succeeded by painting; foils, boxing-gloves,
broadswords, and single-sticks--for, following the example of the
fashionable young men of the time, albert de morcerf cultivated, with
far more perseverance than music and drawing, the three arts that
complete a dandyâ€™s education, i.e., fencing, boxing, and single-stick;
and it was here that he received grisier, cook, and charles leboucher.

the rest of the furniture of this privileged apartment consisted of old
cabinets, filled with chinese porcelain and japanese vases, lucca della

perhaps had sat henry iv. or sully, louis xiii. or richelie

time, preparatory to the countâ€™s arrival, to relate many particulars

assembled at the breakfast given by albert de morcerf; and although
debray was not in the habit of yielding to such feelings, he had never
been able to shake off the powerful influence excited in his mind by the
impressive look and manner of the count, consequently the description
given by lucien to the baroness bore the highly-colored tinge of his own
heated imagination. already excited by the wonderful stories related of
the count by de morcerf, it is no wonder that madame danglars eagerly

chapter 54. a flurry in stocks

some days after this meeting, albert de morcerf visited the count of
monte cristo at his house in the champs-Ã©lysÃ©es, which had already
assumed that palace-like appearance which the countâ€™s princely fortune
enabled him to give even to his most temporary residences. he came to
renew the thanks of madame danglars which had been already conveyed to
the count through the medium of a letter, signed â€œbaronne danglars,
_nÃ©e_ hermine de servieux.â€

albert was accompanied by lucien debray, who, joining in his friendâ€™s
conversation, added s

wearing diamonds to the amount of a million of money, had deputed those

of the mode of life of this incomprehensible person. but the count did
not appear to suspect that there could be the slightest connection
between lucienâ€™s visit and the curiosity of the baroness.

â€œyou are in constant communication with the baron danglars?â€ the count
inquired of albert de morcerf.

â€œyes, count, you know what i told you?â€

â€œall remains the same, then, in that quarter?â€

â€œit is more than ever a settled thing,â€ said lucien,--and, considering
that this remark was all that he was at that time called upon to make,
he adjusted the glass to his eye, and biting the top of his gold headed
cane, began to make the tour of the apartment, examining the arms and
the pictures.

promptly concluded.â€

rose hastily, and was going into the study, when danglars stopped her.

appeared to be unconscious of what passed. albert entered, looking very
handsome and in high spirits. he bowed politely to the baroness,
familiarly to danglars, and affectionately to monte cristo. then turning
to the baroness: â€œmay i ask how mademoiselle danglars is?â€ said he.

forced smile arose, and, making a low bow to m. danglars, said: â€œbaron,
i have the honor of asking of you the hand of mademoiselle eugÃ©nie
danglars for my son, the vicomte albert de morcerf.â€

but danglars, instead of receiving this address in the favorable manner
which morcerf had expected, knit his brow, and without inviting the
count, who was still standing, to take a seat, he said: â€œmonsieur, it
will be necessary to reflect before i give you an answer.â€

â€œto reflect?â€ said morcerf, more and more astonished; â€œhave you not had

since this marriage was first discussed between us?â€

hat, and left the room. he found his carriage at the door, and doing his
utmost to restrain his anger he went at once to find beauchamp, who was
in his office. it was a gloomy, dusty-looking apartment, such as
journalistsâ€™ offices have always been from time immemorial. the servant
announced m. albert de morcerf. beauchamp repeated the name to himself,
as though he could scarcely believe that he had heard aright, and then
gave orders for him to be admitted. albert entered. beauchamp uttered an
exclamation of surprise on seeing his friend leap over and trample under
foot all the newspapers which were strewed about the room. â€œthis way,

man. â€œare you out of your senses, or do you come peaceably to take

not, i ought to be thankful to providence for having released me from my

met with among fashionable ladies, and of which plebeian intercourse can
never entirely deprive them,--â€œit is very true that had not the morcerfs

the apartment on the second floor of the house in the rue saint-germain-

was let to a very mysterious person. this was a man whose face the
concierge himself had never seen, for in the winter his chin was buried
in one of the large red handkerchiefs worn by gentlemenâ€™s coachmen on a
cold night, and in the summer he made a point of always blowing his nose

pointing to the corner of a street. as he spoke, and in the very
direction he indicated, a groan, expressive of bitter grief, was heard,
and a woman was seen waving her hand to a passenger on board the vessel
about to sail. monte cristo looked at her with an emotion that must have
been remarked by morrel had not his eyes been fixed on the vessel.

â€œoh, heavens!â€ exclaimed morrel, â€œi do not deceive myself--that young
man who is waving his hat, that youth in the uniform of a lieutenant, is
albert de morcerf!â€


â€œyes,â€ said monte cristo, â€œi recognized him.â€

â€œhow so?--you were looking the other way.â€

the count smiled, as he was in the habit of doing when he did not want
to make any reply, and he again turned towards the veiled woman, who
soon disappeared at the corner of the street. turning to his friend,--
â€œdear maximilian,â€ said the count, â€œhave you nothing to do in this
land?â€

voice.

riage was about to dash; but the
vehicle turned to one side, leaving the barrier behind and danglars saw
that it was one of the ramparts encircling rome.


â€œ_mon dieu!_â€ cried danglars, â€œwe are not returning to rome; then it is
not justice which is pursuing me! gracious heavens; another idea
presents itself--what if they should be----â€

his hair stood on end. he remembered those interesting stories, so
little believed in paris, respecting roman bandits; he remembered the
adventures that albert de morcerf had related when it was intended that
he should marry mademoiselle eugÃ©nie. â€œthey are robbers, perhaps,â€ he
muttered.

just then the carriage rolled on something harder than gravel road.
danglars hazarded a look on both sides of the road, and perceived
monuments of a singular form, and his mind now recalled all the details
morcerf had related, and comparing them with his own situation, he felt
sure that he must be on the appian way. on the left, in a sort of

had been no bolt, it would have been impossible for him to pass through
the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st. sebastian,
encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the
famous luigi vampa. danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose
existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in
paris; and not only did he recognize him, but the cell in which albert
had been confined, and which was probably kept for the accommodation of
strangers. these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by
danglars, and restored him to some degree of tranquillity. since the
bandits had not despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill
him at all. they had arrested him for the purpose of robbery, and as he
had only a few louis about him, he doubted not he would
