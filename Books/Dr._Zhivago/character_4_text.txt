his uncle calling him from above. he answered and began to climb. suddenly he remembered that he had not prayed for his missing father, as maria nikolaievna had taught him to.
   but his fainting spell had left him with a sense of lightness and well-being that he was unwilling to lose. he thought that nothing terrible would happen if he prayed for his father some other time, as if saying to himself, let him wait. yura did not remember him at all.

in a second-class compartment of the train sat misha gordon, who was travelling with his father, a lawyer from gorenburg. misha was a boy of eleven with a thoughtful face and big dark eyes; he was in his second year of gymnasium. his father, grigory osipovich gordon, was being transferred to a new post in moscow. his mother and sisters had gone on some time before to get their apartment ready.
   father and son had been travelling for three days.
   russia, with its fields, steppes, villages, and towns, bleached lime-white by the sun, flew past them wra

ka. fedka lived in sin with his ward motia and therefore saw himself as a disrupter of the established order and a champion of progressive thought. he did not justify his kinsmans confidence, and even took the money given him for yuras upkeep and spent it on himself. yura was transferred to the professorial family of the gromekos and was still with them.
   the atmosphere at the gromekos was eminently suitable, nikolai nikolaievich thought. they had their daughter, tonia, who was yuras age, and misha gordon, who was yuras friend and classmate, living with them.
   and a comical triumvirate they make, thought nikolai nikolaievich. the three of them had soaked themselves in the meaning of love and the kreutzer sonata and had a mania for preaching chastity. it was right, of course, for adolescents to go through a frenzy of purity, but they were overdoing it a bit, they had lost all sense of proportion.
   how childish and eccentric they were! for some reason, they called the domain of the sensual, wh

ov and alexander gromeko had an argument about it, kerimbekov running it down and gromeko defending it. all around them people smoked, talked, and moved their chairs, till the glittering tablecloth in the adjoining room once again attracted attention. all proposed that the concert be resumed without delay.
   the pianist cast a sideways glance at the audience, and signalled his partners to begin. the violinist and tyshkevich flourished their bows. the music rose plaintively.
   yura, tonia, and misha gordon, who spent half his time at the gromekos, were sitting in the third row.
   egorovna is making signs at you, yura whispered to alexander alexandrovich, who sat directly in front of him.
   egorovna, the gromekos white-haired old servant, stood in the doorway and by staring desperately at yura and nodding with equal energy at alexander alexandrovich tried to make yura understand that she needed urgently to speak to the master.
   alexander alexandrovich turned, gave her a reproachful look, and s

anna ivanovna did not like the wardrobe. its appearance and size reminded her of a catafalque or a royal tomb and filled her with a superstitious dread. she nicknamed it the tomb of askold;7 she meant the horse of prince oleg,8 which had caused its masters death. she had read a great deal, but haphazardly, and she tended to confuse related ideas.
   after that accident anna ivanovna developed a pulmonary weakness.

throughout november, 1911, anna ivanovna stayed in bed with pneumonia.
   yura, misha gordon, and tonia were due to graduate the following spring, yura in medicine, tonia in law, and misha, who studied at the faculty of philosophy, in philology.
   everything in yuras mind was still helter-skelter, but his views, his habits, and his inclinations were all distinctly his own. he was unusually impressionable, and the originality of his vision was remarkable.
   though he was greatly drawn to art and history, he scarcely hesitated over the choice of a career. he thought that art was no mor

h he otherwise regarded as pointless, idle, unnecessary.
   yura realized the great part his uncle had played in molding his character.
   nikolai nikolaievich now lived in lausanne. in his books, published there in russian and in translations, he developed his old view of history as another universe, made by man with the help of time and memory in answer to the challenge of death. these works were inspired by a new interpretation of christianity, and led directly to a new conception of art.
   misha gordon was influenced by these ideas even more than yura. they determined him to register at the faculty of philosophy. he attended lectures on theology, and even considered transferring later to the theological academy.
   yura advanced and became freer under the influence of his uncles theories, but misha was fettered by them. yura realized that his friends enthusiasms were partly accounted for by his origin. being tactful and discreet, he made no attempt to talk him out of his extravagant ideas. bu

 them into this futile and disastrous attitude, this shamefaced, self-denying isolation that brings them nothing but misfortune. but i think some of it also comes from a kind of inner senility, a historical centuries-long weariness. i dont like their ironical whistling in the dark, their prosaic, limited outlook, the timidity of their imagination. its as irritating as old men talking of old age or sick people about sickness. dont you think so?
   i havent thought about it much. i have a friend, misha gordon, who thinks as you do.
   well, i used to go to this place hoping to catch pasha on his way in or out. in tsarist times the governor-general used to have his office in that part of the building. now there is a notice on the door: complaints. have you seen it? its the prettiest place in town. the square in front of it is paved with wooden blocks, and across the square there is the town park, full of maples, hawthorn, honeysuckle. there was always a line in the street outside the door. i used to

 meliuzeievo.
   komarovsky was there.
   was he? quite possible. it wasnt unusual for us to be in the same place. we often saw each other.
   why are you blushing?
   at the sound of komarovskys name coming from you. im no longer used to hearing it, i was taken by surprise.
   there was a school friend of mine who went with me that night, and this is what he told me there in the hotel. he recognized komarvosky as a man he had happened to see once before. as a child, during a journey, this boy, misha gordon, witnessed the suicide of my fatherthe millionaire industrialist. they were in the same train. father jumped deliberately from the moving train and was killed. he was accompanied on the journey by komarovsky, who was his lawyer. he made father drink, he got his business into a muddle, he brought him to the point of bankruptcy, and he drove him to suicide. it was his fault that my father killed himself and that i was left an orphan.
   it isnt possible! its extraordinary! can it really be true?
