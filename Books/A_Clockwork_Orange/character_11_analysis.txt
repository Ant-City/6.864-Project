Prison Chaplain
Throughout the film, the prison chaplain exhibits a certain
blindness to reality, and our first view of him is as a sanctimonious,
foolish, and ineffectual man. He preaches fire and brimstone to
the convicts, and they ignore and ridicule him. He also consistently underestimates
Alex's destructive potential and overestimates his desire for true
moral reform. The chaplain believes, when he and Alex study the
Bible together, that Alex is contemplating the goodness of Jesus
and the evils of sin, but we know he is not. The chaplain believes
Alex sincerely wants to reform, but we know he simply wants his
freedom. This limitation in the prison chaplain's character doesn't
invalidate his argument that even a criminal should not be stripped
of his ability to make moral choices, but it does undermine his
message to a certain extent. 
The prison chaplain is both foolish and authoritarian
in his religious outlook, but he speaks eloquently, if not completely
convincingly, about protecting the individual's ability to make
moral choices. When Alex tells the chaplain he wants to take part
in Ludovico's Technique so that he can make the rest of his life
"one act of goodness," the prison chaplain responds: "The question
is whether or not this technique really makes a man good. Goodness comes
from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot choose, he ceases
to be a man." After the minister of the interior shows off just
how well the state has cured Alex of his violence, the prison chaplain
voices an objection to such far-reaching state power. He says: "The
boy has no real choice, has he? . . . He ceases to be a wrongdoer.
He ceases also to be a creature capable of moral choice." The prison
chaplain is an employee of the state, so his speaking out against
the state is unexpected. The minister of the interior scornfully
dismisses the chaplain's words, but the moral question the chaplain
raises complicates Alex's "cure."
