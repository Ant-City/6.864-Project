bobbie carter had expected sun and relaxation, after two grueling years of residency in
emergency medicine at michael reese in chicago.
she had been in bah¡a anasco now for three weeks. and it had rained every day.
everything else was fine. she liked the isolation of bah¡a anasco, and the friendliness of its
people. costa rica had one of the twenty best medical systems in the world, and even in this
remote coastal village, the clinic was well maintained, amply supplied. her paramedic, manuel
arag6n, was intelligent and well trained. bobbie was able to practice a level of medicine equal to
what she had practiced in chicago.
but the rain! the constant, unending rain! 
across the examining room, manuel cocked his head. "listen," he said.
"believe me, i hear it," bobbie said.
"no. listen."
and then she caught it, another sound blended with the rain, a deeper rumble that built and
emerged until it was clear: the rhythmic thumping of a helicopter. she thought, they can't be
flying in wea

one of those huge american resorts with swimming pools and
tennis courts, where guests could play and drink their daiquiris without having any contact with
the real life of the country.
bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island that the helicopter would fly in this
weather. through the windshield she saw the pilot exhale in relief as the helicopter settled onto
the wet sand of the beach. uniformed men jumped out, and flung open the big side door. she
heard frantic shouts in spanish, and manuel nudged her.
they were calling for a doctor.
two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her, while a white man barked orders. the white
man had a yellow slicker. red hair appeared around the edges of his mets baseball cap. "is there a
doctor here?" he called to her, as she ran up.
"i'm dr. carter," she said. the rain fell in heavy drops, pounding her head and shoulders. the
red-halted man frowned at her. she was wearing cut-off jeans and a tank top. she had a
stethoscope over her shoulder, the

away by air.
"we would, but we can't get over the mountains in this weather. you have to treat him here."
bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic. he was a kid, no
older than eighteen. lifting away the blood-soaked shirt, she saw a big slashing rip along his
shoulder, and another on the leg.
"what happened to him?"
"construction accident," ed shouted. "he fell. one of the backhoes ran over him."
the kid was pale, shivering, unconscious.
manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic, waving his arm. the men brought the body
through and set it on the table in the center of the room. manuel started an intravenous line, and
bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to examine the wounds. immediately she could see
that it did not look good. the kid would almost certainly die.
a big tearing laceration ran from his shoulder down his torso. at the edge of the wound, the
flesh was shredded. at the center, the shoulder was dislocated,

 child who had been attacked
by a rottweiler dog. the other was a drunken circus attendant who had had an encounter with a
bengal tiger. both injuries were similar. there was a characteristic look to an animal attack. 
"mauled?" ed said. "no, no. it was a backhoe, believe me." ed licked his lips as he spoke. he
was edgy, acting as if he had done something wrong. bobbie wondered why. if they were using
inexperienced local workmen on the resort construction, they must have accidents all the time.
manuel said, "do you want lavage?"
"yes," she said. "after you block him."
she bent lower, probed the wound with her fingertips. if an earth mover had rolled over him,
dirt would be forced deep into the wound. but there wasn't any dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam.
and the wound had a strange odor, a kind of rotten stench, a smell of death and decay. she had
never smelled anything like it before.
"how long ago did this happen?"
"an hour."
again she noticed how tense ed regis was. he was one of those e

gain at the head, the arms, the hands -
the hands.
she felt a chill when she looked at the kid's bands. there were short slashing cuts on both
palms, and bruises on the wrists and forearms. she had worked in chicago long enough to know
what that meant.
"all right," she said. "wait outside."
"why?" ed said, alarmed. he didn't like that.
"do you want me to help him, or not?" she said, and pushed him out the door and closed it on
his face. she didn't know what was going on, but she didn't like it. manuel hesitated. "i continue
to wash?"
"yes," she said. she reached for her little olympus point-and-shoot. she took several
snapshots of the injury, shifting her light for a better view. it really did look like bites, she thought.
then the kid groaned, and she put her camera aside and bent toward him. his lips moved, his
tongue thick.
"raptor," he said. "lo sa raptor . . . "
at those words, manuel froze, stepped back in horror.
"what does it mean?" bobbie said.
manuel shook his head. "i do not know,

 doctor. 'lo sa raptor'-no es espa¤ol "
"no?" it sounded to her like spanish. "then please continue to wash him."
"no, doctor." he wrinkled his nose. "bad smell." and he crossed himself.
bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked across the wound. she touched it, rubbing it
between her fingers. it seemed almost like saliva. . . .
the injured boy's lips moved. "raptor," he whispered.
in a tone of horror, manuel said, "it bit him."
"what bit him?"
"raptor."
"what's a raptor?" "it
means hupia."
bobbie frowned. the costa ricans were not especially superstitious, but she had heard the
hupia mentioned in the village before. they were said to be night ghosts, faceless vampires who
kidnapped small children. according to the belief, the hupia had once lived in the mountains of
costa rica, but now inhabited the islands offshore.
manuel was backing away, murmuring and crossing himself. "it is not normal, this s

mell," he
said. "it is the hupia."
bobbie was about to order him back to work when the injured youth opened his eyes and sat
straight up on the table. manuel shrieked in terror. the injured boy moaned and twisted his head, 
looking left and right with wide staring eyes, and then he explosively vomited blood. he went
immediately into convulsions, his body vibrating, and bobbie grabbed for him but he shuddered
off the table onto the concrete floor. he vomited again. there was blood everywhere. ed opened
the door, saying, "what the hell's happening?" and when he saw the blood he turned away, his
hand to his mouth. bobbie was grabbing for a stick to put

 in the boy's clenched jaws, but even as
she did it she knew it was hopeless, and with a final spastic jerk he relaxed and lay still.
she bent to perform mouth-to-mouth, but manuel grabbed her shoulder fiercely, pulling her
back. "no," he said. "the hupia will cross over."
"manuel, for god's sake-"
"no." he stared at her fiercely. "no. you do not understand these things."
bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realized that it didn't matter; there was no
possibility of resuscitating him. manuel called for the men, who came back into the room and took
the body away. ed appeared, wiping his mouth with the back of his hand, muttering, "i'm sure you
did all you could," and then she watched as the men took the body away, back to the helicopter,
and it lifted thunderously up into the sky.
"it is better," manuel said.
bobbie was thinking about the boy's hands. they had been covered with cuts and bruises, in
the characteristic pattern of defense wounds. she was quite sure he had not died in a

construction accident; he had been attacked, and he had held up his bands against his attacker.
"where is this island they've come from?" she asked.
"in the ocean. perhaps a hundred, hundred and twenty miles offshore," "pretty far for a resort,"
she said.
manuel watched the helicopter. "i hope they never come back."
well, she thought, at least she had pictures. but when she turned back to the table, she saw
that her camera was gone.
the rain finally stopped later that night. alone in the bedroom behind the clinic, bobbie thumbed
through her tattered paperback spanish dictionary. the boy had said "raptor," and, despite
manuel's protests, she suspected it was a spanish word. sure enough, she found it in her
dictionary. it meant "ravisher" or "abductor."

d irritated by the conversation, impatient to end it. elena started back
toward the clinic. "i will call to you when she is ready, doctor. i think one hour more, perhaps two." 
bobbie looked at the stars, and listened to the peaceful lapping of the surf at the shore. in the
darkness she saw the shadows of the fishing boats anchored offshore. the whole scene was
quiet, so normal, she felt foolish to be talking of vampires and kidnapped babies.
bobbie went back to her room, remembering again that manuel had insisted it was not a
spanish word. out of curiosity, she looked in the little english dictionary, and to her surprise she
found the word there, too:
