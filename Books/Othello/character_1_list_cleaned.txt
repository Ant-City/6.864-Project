[CHARACTER]	 - 
                the
daughter of the venetian senator brabanzio. [CHARACTER] and othello
are secretly married before the play begins. while in many ways
stereotypically pure and meek, [CHARACTER] is also determined and
self-possessed. she is equally capable of defending her marriage,
jesting bawdily with iago, and responding with dignity to othello's
incomprehensible jealousy.
