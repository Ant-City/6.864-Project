bookseller, i shall continue to do as long as i live.



chapter 1.xv.

the article in my mother's marriage-settlement, which i told the reader
i was at the pains to search for, and which, now that i have found it, i
think proper to lay before him,--is so much more fully express'd in
the deed itself, than ever i can pretend to do it, that it would be
barbarity to take it out of the lawyer's hand:--it is as follows.

'and this indenture further witnesseth, that the said walter shandy,
merchant, in consideration of the said intended marriage to be had,
and, by god's blessing, to be well and truly solemnized and consummated
between the said walter shandy and elizabeth mollineux aforesaid, and
divers other good and valuable causes and considerations him thereunto
specially moving,--doth grant, covenant, condescend, consent, conclude,
bargain, and fully agree to and with john dixon, and james turner,
esqrs. the above-named trustees, &c. &c.--to wit,--that in case it

pass,--that the said walter shandy, merchant, shall have left off
business before the time or times, that the said elizabeth mollineux
shall, according to the course of nature, or otherwise, have left off
bearing and bringing forth children;--and that, in consequence of the
said walter shandy having so left off business, he shall in despight,
and against the free-will, consent, and good-liking of the said
elizabeth mollineux,--make a departure from the city of london, in order
to retire to, and dwell upon, his estate at shandy hall, in the county
of..., or at any other country-seat, castle, hall, mansion-house,

or upon any part or parcel thereof:--that then, and as often as the said

stipulated and agreed upon,--to live and reside in such place or places,
and in such family or families, and with such relations, friends, and
other persons within the said city of london, as she at her own will
and pleasure, notwithstanding her present coverture, and as if she was a

said walter shandy, merchant, thereof made; which said bargain and sale
for a year, bears date the day next before the date of these presents,
and by force and virtue of the statute for

as for thy drink--i need not tell thee, it must be the infusion of
vervain and the herb hanea, of which aelian relates such effects--but

i rest thy affectionate brother,

walter shandy.

morning; so accordingly it was resolv'd upon, for eleven o'clock.

come, my dear, said my father to my mother--'twill be but like a brother
and sister, if you and i take a walk down to my brother
