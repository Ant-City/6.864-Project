sophie had lived for almost fifteen years, and had received quite a lot of letters in her
young life, at least at christmas and on birthdays. but this letter was the strangest one
she had ever received.
it had no postage stamp. it hadn't even been put in the mailbox. it had been brought
straight to sophie's top-secret hideout in the old hedge. the fact that it was wet in the
dry spring weather was also most mystifying.
the strangest thing of all was the silk scarf, of course. the philosopher mu

how had she managed to lose it under sophie's bed?
and alberto knox ... what kind of a name was that?
one thing was confirmed--the connection between the philosopher and hilde moller
knag. but that hilde's own father was now confusing their addresses--that was
completely incomprehensible.
sophie sat for a long time thinking about what connection there could possibly be
between hilde and herself. finally she gave up. the philosopher had written that she
would meet him one day. perhaps she would meet hilde too.
she turned the letter over. she now saw that there w

swarming among the ruins. one of them looked as if he was carrying a notice board.
there it was again. didn't it say "hilde"?
after a minute or two there was a close-up of a middle-aged man. he was rather short,
with a black, well-trimmed beard, and he was wearing a blue beret. he looked into the
camera and said: "welcome to athens, sophie. as you have probably guessed, i am

it was only a quarter past seven. there was no need to hurry home. sophie's mother
always took it easy on sundays, so she would probably sleep for another two hours.
should she go a bit farther into the woods and try to find alberto knox? and why had
the dog snarled at her so viciously?
sophie got up and began to walk down the path hermes had taken. she had the brown
envelope with the pages on plato in her hand. wherever the path diverged she took
the wider one.
birds were chirping everywhere--in the trees and in the air, in bush and thicket. they
were busily occupied with their morning pursuits. they knew no difference between
weekdays and sundays. who had taught them to do all that? was there a tiny
computer inside each one o

 and glasses were piled on a tea towel, some
of them still glistening with drops of soapy water. there was a tin bowl on the floor
with some leftover scraps of food in it. whoever lived here had a pet, a dog or a cat.
sophie went back to the living room. another door led to a tiny bedroom. on the floor
next to the bed there were a couple of blankets in a thick bundle. sophie discovered
some golden hairs on the blankets. here was the evidence! now sophie knew that the
occupants of the cabin were alberto knox and hermes.
back in the living room, sophie stood in front of the mirror. the glass was matte and
scratched, and her reflection correspondingly blurred. sophie began to make faces at
herself like she did at home in the bathroom. her reflection did exactly the same,
which was only to be expected.
but all of a sudden something scary happened. just once--in the space of a split
second--sophie saw quite clearly that the girl in the mirror winked with both eyes.
sophie started back in fright. if she

if this joker really was in lebanon, how had he gotten hold of sophie's address? also,
sophie and hilde had at least two things in common. if hilde's birthday was june 15,
they were both born on the same day. and they both had fathers who were on the
other side of the globe.
sophie felt she was being drawn into an unnatural world. maybe it was not so dumb
after all to believe in fate. still--she shouldn't be jumping to conclusions; it could all
have a perfectly natural explanation. but how had alberto knox found hilde's wallet
when hilde lived in lillesand? lillesand was hundreds of miles away. and why had
sophie found this postcard on her sidewalk? did it fall out of the mailman's bag just
as he got to sophie's mailbox? if so, why should he drop this particular card?
"are you completely insane?" joanna burst out when sophie finally made it to the 
supermarket.
"sorry!"
joanna frowned at her severely, like a schoolteacher.
"you'd better have a good explanation."

3. what is meant by conscience? do you think conscience is the same for everyone?
4. what is meant by priority of values?
sophie sat thinking for a long time before she started to write. could she use any of
the ideas she had learned from alberto knox? she was going to have to, because she
had not opened her religious knowledge book for days. once she began to write, the
words simply flowed from her pen.
she wrote that we know the moon is not made of green cheese and that there are also
craters on the dark side of the moon, that both socrates and jesus were sentenced to
death, that everybody has to die sooner or later, that the great temples on the
acropolis were built after the persian wars in the fifth century b.c. and that the most

the extraordinary feeling was fleeting, but sophie was sure she would never forget it.
it felt as if something inside her had burst through her forehead and become merged
with everything else, the way a drop of color can tint a whole jug of water.
when it was all over, it was like waking up with a headache after a wonderful dream.
sophie registered with a touch of disillusionment that she had a body which was
trying to sit up in bed. lying on her stomach reading the pages from alberto knox
had given her a backache. but she had experienced something unforgettable.
eventually she pulled herself together and stood up. the first thing she did was to
punch holes in the pages and file them in her ring binder together with the other
lessons. then she .went into the garden.

 the small lake. sophie gazed at the cabin
across the water. all the windows were now shuttered up. the red building was the
most deserted place she had seen for ages.
joanna turned toward her. "do we have to walk on the water?"
"of course not. we'll row."
sophie pointed down into the reeds. there lay the rowboat, just as before.
"have you been here before?"
sophie shook her head. trying to explain her previous visit would be far too
complicated. and then she would have to tell her friend about alberto knox and the
philosophy course as well.
they laughed and joked as they rowed across the water. when they reached the
opposite bank, sophie made sure they drew the boat well up on land.
they went to the front door. as there was obviously nobody in the cabin, joanna tried
the door handle.
"locked... you didn't expect it to be open, did you?"
"maybe we can find a key," said sophie. 
she began to search in the crevices of the stonework foundation.
"oh, let's go back to the tent instead," said joanna aft

"yes, i guess i have." 
it suddenly struck her that it would have been a whole lot easier if she had just
admitted she had been here before. it couldn't do any harm if she let her friend in on
the mysterious things she had experienced during the last few days.
"i didn't want to tell you before we were here."
joanna began to read the cards.
"they are all addressed to someone called hilde moller knag."
sophie had not touched the cards yet.
"what address?"
joanna read: "hilde moller knag, c/o alberto knox, lillesand, norway."
sophie breathed a sigh of relief. she was afraid they would say c/o sophie amundsen.
she began to inspect them more closely.
"april 28 ... may 4 ... may 6 ... may 9 ... they were stamped a few days ago."
"but there's something else. all the postmarks are norwegian! look at that... un

a week passed without sophie hearing from alberto knox. there were no more
postcards from lebanon either, although she and joanna still talked about the cards
they found in the major's cabin. joanna had had the fright of her life, but as nothing
further seemed to hap-pen, the immediate terror faded and was submerged in
homework and badminton.
sophie read alberto's letters over and over, looking for some clue that would throw
light on the hilde mystery. doing so also gave her plenty of opportunity to digest the
classical philosophy. she no longer ha

she was nervous, but not scared out of her wits. in front of the altar the monk turned
in a half-circle and then climbed up into the pulpit. he leaned over the edge, looked
down at sophie, and addressed her in latin:
"gloria patri, et filio, et spiritui sancto. sicut erat in principio, et nunc, et semper et
in saecula saeculorum. amen."
"talk sense, silly!" sophie burst out.
her voice resounded all around the old stone church.
although she realized that the monk had to be alberto knox, she regretted her
outburst in this venerable place of worship. but she had been nervous, and when
you're nervous its comforting to break all taboos.
"shhh!" alberto held up one hand as priests do when they want the congregation to be
seated. "middle ages began at four," he said. "middle ages began at four?" asked
sophie, feeling stupid but no longer nervous. "about four o'clock, yes. and then it
was five and six and seven. but it was as if time stood still. and it got to be eight and

it was a strange feeling, being so close to him. under his cowl sophie saw a pair of
deep brown eyes. they belonged to a middle-aged man with dark hair and a little
pointed beard. who are you, she wondered. why have you turned my life upside
down?
"we shall become better acquainted by and by," he said, as if he had read her
thoughts.
as they sat there together, with the light that filtered into the church through the
stained-glass windows becoming sharper and sharper, alberto knox began to talk
about medieval philosophy.
"the medieval philosophers took it almost for granted that christianity was true," he
began. "the question was whether we must simply believe the christian revelation or
whether we can approach the christian truths with the help of reason. what was the
relationship between the greek philosophers and what the bible said? was there a
contradiction between the bible and reason, or were belief and knowledge compatible?

at the clock. she had been asleep for two hours. she sat up in bed,
thinking about the strange dream. it was so real that she felt as if she had actually
lived the experience. she was equally sure that the house and the dock really existed
somewhere. surely it resembled the picture she had seen hanging in the major's cabin?
anyway, there was no doubt at all that the girl in her dream was hilde moller knag
and that the man was her father, home from lebanon. in her dream he had looked a 
lot like alberto knox ...
as sophie stood up and began to tidy her bed, she found a gold crucifix on a chain
under her pillow. on the back of the crucifix there were three letters engraved: hmk.
this was not the first time sophie had dreamed she found a treasure. but this was
definitely the first time she had brought it back from the dream.
"damn!" she said aloud.
she was so mad that she opened the closet door and hurled the delicate crucifix up
onto the top shelf with the silk scarf, the white stocking, and the pos

und the corner.
hermes was already on his way up the stairs. sophie took the postcard with her and
followed. she had to run to keep up with him; he was wagging his tail delightedly.
they passed the second, third, and fourth stories. from then on there was only an attic 
staircase. were they going up to the roof? hermes clambered on up the stairs and
stopped outside a narrow door, which he scratched at with his paw.
sophie heard footsteps approaching from inside. the door opened, and there stood
alberto knox. he had changed his clothes and was now wearing another costume. it
consisted of white hose, red knee-breeches, and a yellow jacket with padded shoulders.
he reminded sophie of a joker in a deck of cards. if she was not much mistaken, this
was a typical renaissance costume.
"what a clown!" sophie exclaimed, giving him a little push so that she could go
inside the apartment.
once again she had taken out her fear and shyness on the unfortunate philosophy
teacher. sophie's thoughts were in a turmo

"now in galileo's time there were no trains. but if you roll a ball along the

"... it goes on rolling ..."
"... because it retains its speed after you let go."
"but it will stop eventually, if the room is long enough."
"that's because other forces slow it down. first, the floor, especially if it is a rough
wooden floor. then the force of gravity will sooner or later bring it to a halt. but wait,
i'll show you something."
alberto knox got up and went over to the old desk. he took something out of one of
the drawers. when he returned to his place he put it on the coffee table. it was just a
wooden board, a few millimeters thick at one end and thin at the other. beside the
board, which almost covered the whole table, he laid a green marble.
"this is called an inclined plane," he said. "what do you think will happen if i let go 
the marble up here, where the plane is thickest?"
sophie sighed resignedly.
"i bet you ten crowns it

language of the people to take precedence over latin was also a
characteristic renaissance feature. but luther was not a humanist like ficino or
leonardo da vinci. he was also opposed by humanists such as erasmus of rotterdam
because they thought his view of man was far too negative; luther had proclaimed
that mankind was totally depraved after the fall from grace. only through the grace
of god could mankind be 'justified,' he believed. for the wages of sin is death."
"that sounds very gloomy."
alberto knox rose. he picked up the little green and black marble and put it in his top
pocket.
"it's after four!" sophie exclaimed in horror.
"and the next great epoch in the history of mankind is the baroque. but we shall have
to keep that for another day, my dear hilde."
"what did you say?" sophie shot up from the chair she had been sitting in. "you
called me hilde!"
"that was a serious slip of the tongue." 
"but a slip of the tongue is never wholly accidental."
"you may be right. you'll notice that hild

"do you think it could have come by mail? and the teacher just popped it in your

"no idea. i don't know whether i dare ask either."
no more was said about the postcard.
"i'm going to have a garden party on midsummer eve," said sophie.
"with boys?"
sophie shrugged her shoulders. "we don't have to invite the worst idiots."
"but you are going to invite jeremy?"
"if you want. by the way, i might invite alberto knox."
"you must be crazy!"
"i know."
that was as far as the conversation got before their ways parted at the supermarket.
the first thing sophie did when she got home was to see if hermes was in the garden.
sure enough, there he was, sniffing around the apple trees.
"hermes!"
the dog stood motionless for a second. sophie knew exactly what was going on in
that second: the dog heard her call, recognized her voice, and decided to see if she 
was there. then, discovering her, he began to run toward her

the baroque period."
"the baroque period? what a strange name."

aristotle had inspired sophie to clean up her own room. and there, together with all
the other stuff, she found the white stocking which had disappeared from hilde's
closet a month ago! sophie put all the pages she had gotten from alberto into a ring
binder. "there were in all over fifty pages." for her own part, hilde had gotten up to
page 124, but then she also had sophie's story on top of all the correspondence from
alberto knox. 
the next chapter was called "hellenism." first of all, sophie finds a postcard with a
picture of a un jeep. it is stamped un battalion, june 15. another of these "cards" to
hilde that her father had put into the story instead of sending by mail.
dear hilde, i assume you are still celebrating your fifteenth birthday. or is this the
morning after? anyway, it makes no difference to your present. in a sense, that will
last a lifetime. but i'd like to wish you a happy birthday one more time. perha

then alberto calls sophie, and this is the first time she hears his voice.
"you make it sound like a war."
"i would rather call it a battle of wills. we have to attract hilde's attention and get her
over on our side before her father comes home to lillesand."
and then sophie meets alberto knox disguised as a medieval monk in the
twelfth-century stone church.
oh, no, the church! hilde looked at the time. a quarter past one ... she had forgotten
all about the time.
maybe it wouldn't matter so much that she cut school on her birthday. but it did mean
that her classmates wouldn't be celebrating with her. oh well, she had always had
plenty of well-wishers.
soon she found herself receiving a long sermon. alberto had no problem slipping into
the role of a medieval priest.

birthday.
"we're having the real party next saturday, but i thought we ought to have a little
celebration today as well."
"how?"
"i have invited joanna and her parents."
"fine with me."
the visitors arrived shortly before half-past seven. the atmosphere was somewhat
formal--sophie's mother very seldom saw joanna's parents socially.
it was not long before sophie and joanna went upstairs to sophie's room to write the
garden party invitations. since alberto knox was also to be invited, sophie had the
idea of inviting people to a "philosophical garden party." joanna didn't object. it was
sophie's party after all, and theme parties were "in" at the moment.
finally they had composed the invitation. it had taken two hours and they couldn't
stop laughing.

 twenty copies, then," said sophie, taking them at their word.
"you must be nuts!" said joanna.
before sophie went to bed that night she stood for a long time gazing out of the
window. she remembered how she had once seen the outline of alberto's figure in the
darkness. it was more than a month ago. now it was again late at night, but this was a
white summer night.
sophie heard nothing from alberto until tuesday morning. he called just after her
mother had left for work.
"sophie amundsen."
"and alberto knox."
"i thought so."
"i'm sorry i didn't call before, but i've been working hard on our plan. i can only be
alone and work undisturbed when the major is concentrating wholly and com-pletely
on you."
 "that's weird." 
"then i seize the opportunity to conceal myself, you see. the best surveillance system
in the world has its limitations when it is only controlled by one single person ... i got
your card."
"you mean the invitation?"
"dare you risk it?"
"why not?"
"anything can happen at a party like

thing. did you remember that it's the day
hilde's father gets back from lebanon?"
"no, i didn't, actually."
"it can't possibly be pure coincidence that he lets you arrange a philosophical garden
party the same day as he gets home to bjerkely."
"i didn't think about it, as i said."
"i'm sure he did. but all right, we'll talk about that later. can you come to the major's
cabin this morning?"
"i'm supposed to weed the flower beds."
"let's say two o'clock, then. can you make that?"
"i'll be there."
alberto knox was sitting on the step again when sophie arrived.
"have a seat," he said, getting straight down to work. 
"previously we spoke of the renaissance, the baroque period, and the enlightenment.
today we are going to talk about romanticism, which could be described as europe's
last great cultural epoch. we are approaching the end of a long story, my child."
"did romanticism last that long?"
"it began toward the end of the eighteenth century and lasted till the middle of the
nineteenth. but after 18

"yes, i remember."
"what i am saying to you now will be read by hilde after her father in lebanon once
imagined that i was telling you he was in lebanon ... imagining me telling you that he
was in lebanon."
sophie's head was swimming. she tried to remember what she had heard about
berkeley and the romantics. alberto knox continued: "but they shouldn't feel so
cocky because of that. they are the last people who should laugh, because laughter
can easily get stuck in their throat."
"who are we talking about?" 
"hilde and her father. weren't we talking about them?"
"but why shouldn't they feel so cocky?"
"because it is feasible that they, too, are nothing but mind."
"how could they be?"
"if it was possible for berkeley and the romantics, it must be possible for them.
maybe the major is also a shadow in a book about

 him and hilde, which is also about
us, since we are a part of their lives."
"that would be even worse. that makes us only shadows of shadows."
"but it is possible that a completely different author is somewhere writing a book
about a un major albert knag, who is writing a book for his daughter hilde. this
book is about a certain alberto knox who suddenly begins to send humble
philosophical lectures to sophie amundsen, 3 clover close."
"do you believe that?"
"i'm just saying it's possible. to us, that author would be a 'hidden god.' although
everything we are and everything we say and do proceeds from him, because we are
him we will never be able to know anything about him. we are in the innermost box."
alberto and sophie now sat for a long time without saying anything. it was sophie

the guests were dumbstruck. mrs. ingebrigtsen gave her husband a significant look.
sophie's mother was so relieved that the man had finally arrived, however, that she
would have forgiven him anything. sophie herself was struggling to suppress her
laughter.
helene amundsen tapped on her glass and said:
"let us also welcome alberto knox to this philosophical garden party. he is not my
new boyfriend, because although my husband is so often away at sea, i don't have a
new boyfriend for the time being. however, this astounding person is sophie's new
philosophy teacher. his prowess extends further than to setting off fireworks.

"many thanks," said alberto. he sat down.
