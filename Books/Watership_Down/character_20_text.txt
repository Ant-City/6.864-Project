n, hazel knew well. he was glad to see him,
for he knew him for a tough, sturdy fellow who was considered certain to get into
the owsla as soon as he reached full weight.
     "but i dare say he's impatient," thought hazel, "or he may have come off worst
in some scuffle over a doe and taken it hard. well, with him and bigwig, at least
we shan't be too badly off if we run into any fighting."
     he did not recognize the other two rabbits and when blackberry told him their
names -- speedwell and acorn -- he was none the wiser. but this was not
surprising, for they were typical outskirters -- thin-looking six-monthers, with the
strained, wary look of those who are only too well used to the thin end of the
stick. they looked curiously at fiver. from what blackberry had told them, they
had been almost expecting to find fiver foretelling doom in a poetic torrent.
instead, he seemed more calm and normal than the rest. the certainty of going
had lifted a weight from fiver.

halting in the bushes with raised ears and staring eyes. the moon was low now
and the light, wherever it slanted through the trees, seemed thicker, older and
more yellow.
     from a thick pile of dead leaves beneath a holly tree, hazel looked down a
narrow path lined on either side with fern and sprouting fireweed. the fern
moved slightly in the breeze, but along the path there was nothing to be seen
except a scatter of last year's fallen acorns under an oak. what was in the
bracken? what lay round the further bend? and what would happen to a rabbit
who left the shelter of the holly tree and ran down the path? he turned to
dandelion beside him.
     "you'd better wait here," he said. "when i get to the bend i'll stamp. but if i
run into trouble, get the others away."
     without waiting for an answer, he ran into the open and down the path. a few
seconds brought him to the oak. he paused a moment, staring about him, and
then ran on t

     as dandelion ended, acorn, who was on the windward side of the little group,
suddenly started and sat back, with ears up and nostrils twitching. the strange,
rank smell was stronger than ever and after a few moments they all heard a heavy
movement close by. suddenly, on the other side of the path, the fern parted and
there looked out a long, dog-like head, striped black and white. it was pointed
downward, the jaws grinning, the muzzle close to the ground. behind, they could
just discern great, powerful paws and a shaggy

are alive to all manner of knowledge about time and the weather; and about
direction, too, as we know from their extraordinary migratory and homing
journeys. the changes in the warmth and dampness of the soil, the falling of the
sunlight patches, the altering movement of the beans in the light wind, the
direction and strength of the air currents along the ground -- all these were
perceived by the rabbit awake.
     the sun was beginning to set when hazel woke to see acorn listening and
sniffing in the silence, between two white-skinned flints. the light was thicker,
the breeze had dropped and the beans were still. pipkin was stretched out a little
way away. a yellow-and-black burying beetle, crawling across the white fur of his
belly, stopped, waved its short, curved antennae and then moved on again. hazel
grew tense with sudden misgiving. he knew that these beetles come to dead
bodies, on which they feed and lay their eggs. they will dig away the earth from

er the bodies of small creatures, such as shrew mice and fallen fledglings, and
then lay their eggs on them before covering them with soil. surely pipkin could
not have died in his sleep? hazel sat up quickly. acorn started and turned toward
him and the beetle scurried away over the pebbles as pipkin moved and woke.
     "how's the paw?" said hazel.
     pipkin put it to the ground. then he stood on it.
     "it feels much better," he said. "i think i shall be able to go as well as the others
now. they won't leave me behind, will they?"
     hazel rubbed his nose behind pipkin's ear. "no one's going to leave anyone
else behind," he said. "if you had to stay, i'd stay with you. but don't pick up any

r view ahead, he heard a movement behind
him and turned to find hawkbit at his shoulder. there was something furtive and
hesitant about him and hazel glanced at him sharply, wondering for a moment
whether he could have sickness or poison on him. "er -- hazel," said hawkbit,
looking past him into the face of the dreary black cliff. "i -- er -- that is to say we
-- er -- feel that we -- well, that we can't go on like this. we've had enough of it."
     he stopped. hazel now saw that speedwell and acorn were behind him,
listening expectantly. there was a pause.
     "go on, hawkbit," said speedwell, "or shall i?"
     "more than enough," said hawkbit, with a kind of foolish importance.
     "well, so have i," answered hazel, "and i hope there won't be much more.
then we can all have a rest."
     "we want to stop now," said speedwell. "we think it was stupid to come so
far."
     "it gets worse and worse the further we go," said acorn. "where are we going
and how long will it be before some of

 us stop running for good and all?"
     "it's the place that worries you," said hazel. "i don't like it myself, but it won't
go on forever."
     hawkbit looked sly and shifty. "we don't believe you know where we are
going," he said. "you didn't know about the road, did you? and you don't know
what there is in front of us."
     "look here," said hazel, "suppose you tell me what you want to do and i'll tell
you what i think about it."
     "we want to go back," said acorn. "we think fiver was wrong."
     "how can you go back through all we've come through?" replied hazel. "and
probably get killed for wounding an owsla officer, if you ever do get back? talk
sense, for frith's sake."
     "it wasn't we who wounded holly," said speedwell.
     "you were there and blackberry brought you there. do you think they won't

     hazel stopped as fiver approached, followed by bigwig.

the moon, smoky and yellow in thin night cloud, stood over a clump of distant
pine trees. they looked southward across the dismal waste. hazel waited for fiver
to speak, but he remained silent.
     "what was it you wanted to say to me?" asked hazel at last.
     fiver made no reply and hazel paused in perplexity. from below, bigwig was
just audible.
     "and you, acorn, you dog-eared, dung-faced disgrace to a gamekeeper's gibbet,
if i only had time to tell you--"
     the moon sailed free of the cloud and lit the heather more brightly, but neither
hazel nor fiver moved from the top of the bank. fiver was looking far out beyond
the edge of the common. four miles away, along the southern skyline, rose the
seven-hundred-and-fifty-foot ridge of the downs. on the highest point, the beech
trees of cottington's clump were moving in a stronger wind than that which bl

there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned
and stared at him expectantly.
     "look," said hazel, "i know there's been some trouble, but the best thing will
be to try to forget it. this is a bad place, but we'll soon

shook the wet from his fur. he could see fiver's hills plainly now, greenish-gray
and seeming close in the rain-laden air. he could even pick out the dots of furze
bushes and stunted yew trees on the steep slopes. as he gazed at them, he heard
an excited voice further down the track.
     "he's done it! didn't i tell you he'd do it?"
     hazel turned his head and saw blackberry on the path. he was bedraggled and
exhausted, but it was he who was speaking. out of the heather behind him came
acorn, speedwell and buckthorn. all four rabbits were now staring straight at
him. he wondered why. then, as they approached, he realized that they were
looking not at him, but past him at something further off. he turned round. the
gravel track led downhill into a narrow belt of silver birch and rowan. beyond was
a thin hedge; and beyond that, a green field between two copses. they had
reached the other side of the common.
     "oh, hazel," said blackberry, coming up to him round a puddle in the gra

was so tired and confused, i actually began to wonder whether you knew where
you were going. i could hear you in the heather, saying 'not far now' and it was
annoying me. i thought you were making it up. i should have known better.
frithrah, you're what i call a chief rabbit!"
     "well done, hazel!" said buckthorn. "well done!"
     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!" he said. "who's going to be first into that field? i can still run." he
was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit and then by fiver. hazel
was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew

     the tired rabbits fed and basked in the sunny meadow as though they had
come no further than from the bank at the edge of the nearby copse. the heather
and the stumbling darkness were forgotten as though the sunrise had melted
them. bigwig and hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. speedwell
jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel and fiver were sitting with dandelion
under a flowering wild cherry. the white petals spun down around them,
covering the grass and speckling their

coming back along the bottom, and the other two with him."
     the three rabbits were returning down the bank of the stream and had not yet
seen hazel and the others. they passed below them, into the narrower part of the
field between the two copses, and it was not until acorn had been sent halfway
down the slope to attract their attention that they turned and came up to the
ditch.
     "i don't think there's going to be much to trouble us here, hazel," said bigwig.
"the farm's a good way away and the fields between don't show any signs of elil at
all. there's a man track -- in fact, there are several -- and they look as though they
were used a good deal. scent's fresh and there are the ends of those little white

then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned
from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.
     "o el-ahrairah!" thought hazel. "these are rabbits we're going to meet. you
know them as well as you know us. let it be the right thing that i'm doing."

ading deeper down below the wood. it was certainly a warren to admire.
sometimes, when they crossed a run that led upward to a hole, he could hear the
rain outside, still falling in the night. but although it had now been raining for
several hours, there was not the least damp or cold either in the deep runs or in
the many burrows that they passed. both the drainage and the ventilation were
better than he had been accustomed to. here and there other rabbits were on the
move. once they came upon acorn, who was evidently being taken on a tour of
the same kind. "very friendly, aren't they?" he said to hazel as they passed one
another. "i never dreamed we'd reach a place like this. you've got wonderful
judgment, hazel." strawberry waited politely for him to finish speaking and
hazel could not help feeling pleased that he must have heard.

distinct smell of rats, they halted in a kind of pit. a steep tunnel led up i

silver and buckthorn fight alone, but he had felt obliged to leave the worst of it to
them. for the first time in his life, bigwig had found himself driven to moderation
and prudence.
     as the sun sank lower and touched the edge of the cloud belt on the horizon,
hazel came out from under the branches and looked carefully round the lower
slope. then he stared upward over the anthills, to the open down rising above.
fiver and acorn followed him out and fell to nibbling at a patch of sainfoin. it was
new to them, but they did not need to be told that it was good and it raised their
spirits. hazel turned back and joined them among the big, rosy-veined, magenta
flower spikes.
     "fiver," he said, "let me get this right. you want us to climb up this place,
however far it is, and find shelter on the top. is that it?"
     "yes, hazel."
     "but the top must be very high. i can't even see it from here. it'll be open and

 "not in the ground: and the soil's so light that we shall be able to scratch some

     hazel considered again. "it's getting started that bothers me. here we are, all
tired out. i'm sure it's dangerous to stay here. we've nowhere to run to. we don't
know the country and we can't get underground. but it seems out of the question
for everybody to climb up there tonight. we should be even less safe."
     "we shall be forced to dig, shan't we?" said acorn. "this place is almost as
open as that heather we crossed, and the trees won't hide us from anything
hunting on four feet."
     "it would have been the same any time we came," said fiver.
     "i'm not saying anything against it, fiver," replied acorn, "but we need holes.
it's a bad place not to be able to get underground."
     "before everyone goes up to the top," said hazel, "we ought to find out what it's
like. i'm going up myself to have a look round. i'll be as quick as i can and you'll

     the hanger might have little or no undergrowth but at least the branches gave
cover from the sky: and kestrels, they soon realized, were common in this
solitude. although kestrels seldom prey on anything bigger than a rat, they will
sometimes attack young rabbits. no doubt this is why most grown rabbits will not
remain under a hovering kestrel. before long, acorn spotted one as it flew up
from the south. he stamped and bolted into the trees, followed by the other
rabbits who were in the open. they had not long come out and resumed digging
when they saw another -- or perhaps the same one -- hovering some way off, high
over the very fields that they had crossed the previous morning. hazel placed
buckthorn as a sentry while the day's haphazard work went on, and twice more
during the afternoon the alarm was given. in the early evening they were
disturbed by

to fiver here as well."
     "i've heard of you," said holly, turning to fiver. "you're the rabbit who saw it
all coming. you talked to the threarah, didn't you?"
     "he talked to me," said fiver.
     "if only he'd listened to you! well, it can't be changed now, till acorns grow on
thistles. silver, there's something i want to say and i can say it more easily to you
than to hazel or bigwig. i'm not out to make any trouble here -- trouble for hazel,
i mean. he's your chief rabbit now, that's plain. i hardly know him, but he must
be good or you'd all be dead; and this is no time to be squabbling. if any of the
other rabbits are wondering whether i might want to alter things, will you let
them know that i shan't?"

hardly a full day had elapsed since holly had come crawling in delirium to the
foot of watership down. yet already he was near recovery, while the more light-
hearted bluebell seemed even less the worse for the dreadful catastrophe that he
had survived. hazel and his companions had suffered extremes of grief and
horror during the telling of holly's tale. pipkin had cried and trembled piteously
at the death of scabious, and acorn and speedwell had been seized with
convulsive choking as bluebell told of the poisonous gas that murdered
underground. yet, as with primitive humans, the very strength and vividness of
their sympathy brought with it a true release. their feelings were not false or
assumed. while the story was being told, they heard it without any of the reserve
or detachment that the kindest of civilized humans retains as he reads his
newspaper. to themselves, they seemed to struggle in the poisoned runs and to

     it followed hazel docilely enough across the grass, but he was careful to keep
out of its reach. their arrival outside the wood caused something of a sensation,
which hazel cut short with a peremptory sharpness quite unlike his usual
manner.
     "come on, get busy," he said to dandelion and buckthorn. "this bird's hurt
and we're going to shelter it until it's better. ask bigwig to show you how to get it
some food. it eats worms and insects. try grasshoppers, spiders -- anything.
hawkbit! acorn! yes, and you too, fiver -- come out of that rapt trance, or
whatever you're in. we need an open, wide hole, broader than it's deep, with a flat
floor a little below the level of the entrance: by nightfall."
     "we've been digging all the afternoon, hazel--"
     "i know. i'll come and help you," said hazel, "in just a little while. only get
started. the night's coming."
     the astonished rabbits obeyed him, grumbling. hazel's authority was put to
something of a test, but held firm with the

eling, latent throughout the
warren, had come to the surface. but his plan to make use of the gull excited
everyone and was seen as something that not even blackberry could have hit
upon. reconnaissance is familiar to all rabbits -- indeed, it is second nature -- but
the idea of making use of a bird, and one so strange and savage, convinced them
that hazel, if he could really do it, must be as clever as el-ahrairah himself.
     for the next few days a lot of hard work went into feeding kehaar. acorn and
pipkin, boasting that they were the best insect-catchers in the warren, brought in
great numbers of beetles and grasshoppers. at first the gull's principal hardship
was lack of water. he suffered a good deal and was reduced to tearing at the
stems of the long grasses for moisture. however, during his third night in the
warren it rained for three or four hours and puddles formed on the track. a

     should he go alone? it would be safer and more pleasant to take a companion;
but not more than one. they must not attract attention. who would be best?
bigwig? dandelion? hazel rejected them. he needed someone who would do as
he was told and not start having ideas of his own. at once he thought of pipkin.
pipkin would follow him without question and do anything he asked. at this
moment he was probably asleep in the burrow which he shared with bluebell and
acorn, down a short run leading off the honeycomb.
     hazel was lucky. he found pipkin close to the mouth of the burrow and already
awake. he brought him out without disturbing the other two rabbits and led him
up by the run that gave on the bank. pipkin looked about him uncertainly,
bewildered and half expecting some danger.
     "it's all right, hlao-roo," said hazel. "there's nothing to be afraid of. i want
you to come down the hill and help me to find a farm i've heard about. we're just

's tough, but if there's real trouble we
ought to save our own rabbits first. let's hope that doesn't happen, though."
     when they came to set out, fiver was nowhere to be seen. hazel felt relieved,
for he had been afraid that fiver might say something that would lower their

spirits. but there was nothing worse to contend with than pipkin's
disappointment at being left behind; and this was dispelled when hazel assured
him that the only reason was that he had already done his bit. bluebell, acorn and
pipkin came with them to the foot of the hill and watched them down the
hedgerow.
     they reached the sheds in the twilight after sunset the summer nightfall was
unbroken by owls and so quiet that they could plainly hear the intermittent,
monotonous "chug chug chug" of a nightingale in the distant woods. two rats
among the swedes showed their teeth, thought better of it and left them alone.
when they had foraged, they rested comfortably in the straw until the western
light was quite gone.

ahead -- and as he did so, felt himself the least convinced of any.
     bigwig had sent acorn to see whether there was anyone still to come. acorn
returned to say that strawberry felt too ill and that he could find neither
blackberry nor fiver.
     "well, leave fiver," said bigwig. "poor fellow, he'll feel better by himself for a
time, i dare say."
     "he's not in his burrow, though," said acorn.
     "never mind," said bigwig. but the thought came to him, "fiver and

remembered the time, on the first night of his leadership, when they had been
forced to rest in the wood above the enborne. at least it was good to see that no
one was exhausted now: they were as tough a bunch of hlessil as ever raided a
garden. not a blade of grass to choose between them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig suddenly. he had spoken very little all the evening
and everyone looked round. "if you're going to tell a story, there's only one i
want," he went on. "'el-ahrai

   "i think so," replied silver. "but we can't make too big a circle or they'll be
completely exhausted. i can't say i know the way, but i can tell the direction all
right."
     "well, we'll just have to take the risk," said hazel. "if only we can get there by
early morning, they can rest at the other end."
     they met with no more adventures that night, moving quietly along the edges
of the fields under the dim light of a quarter-moon. the half-darkness was full of
sounds and movement. once acorn put up a plover, which flew round them,
calling shrilly, until at length they crossed a bank and left it behind. soon after,
somewhere near them, they heard the unceasing bubbling of a nightjar -- a
peaceful sound, without menace, which died gradually away as they pushed on.
and once they heard a corncrake calling as it crept among the long grass of a path
verge. (it makes a sound like a human fingernail drawn down the teeth of a
comb.) but elil they met none and although they were continually

then someone beside him was saying, "hullo, bigwig.
bigwig! bigwig! what do you want us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.

three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then

back, keep away from that ditch!"
     "go back to bluebell! go back to bluebell!" repeated silver, running from side
to side.
     they found bluebell by the hedge at the bottom of the field. he was white-eyed
and ready to bolt.

behind us now. one of them was the biggest rabbit i've ever seen."
     "then don't stay here,"

said silver. "there goes speedwell. and who's that?

acorn and two does with him. that's everyone. come on, quick as you can."
     it was only a short distance now to the river, but among the sodden patches of
rushes, the bushes and sedge and deep puddles, they found it next to impossible
to tell their direction. expecting to be attacked at any moment, they scuttered and
floundered through the undergrowth, finding here a doe and there one of their
own rabbits and forcing them on. without kehaar they would certainly have lost
all touch with each other

 are."
     bigwig ran behind him and came out on the green path by the bank. all the
surface of the river was winking and plopping in the rain. the level did not appear
to have risen much as yet. the boat was just as he remembered it -- one end
against the bank, the other a little way out in the stream. on the raised part at the
near end hazel was crouching, his ears drooping on either side of his head and his
flattened fur completely black with rain. he was holding the taut rope in his
teeth. acorn, hyzenthlay and two more were crouching near him on the wood,
but the rest were huddled here and there along the bank. blackberry was trying
unsuccessfully to persuade them to get out on the boat.
     "hazel's afraid to leave the rope," he said to bigwig. "apparently he's bitten it
very thin already. all these does will say is that you're their officer."
     bigwig turned to thethuthinnang.
     "this is the magic trick now," he said. "get them over there, where
hyzenthlay's sitting, do you s

e bilge. there was a squeal and a rabbit tumbled on top of him. then a
heavy blow vibrated along the length of the punt and its smooth movement was
checked. this was followed by a hollow sound of scraping. it grew dark and a roof
appeared, very low above him. for a moment hazel had the vague idea that he
was underground. then the roof vanished, the punt was gliding on and he heard
kehaar calling. they were below the bridge and still drifting downstream.
     the rabbit who had fallen on him was acorn. he had been struck by the bridge
and the blow had sent him flying. however, though dazed and bruised, he seemed
to have escaped injury.
     "i wasn't quick enough, hazel-rah," he said. "i'd better go to efrafa for a bit."
     "you'd be wasted," said hazel. "but i'm afraid there's someone at the other end
who hasn't been so lucky."
     one of the does had held back from the bilgewater, and the upstream girder
under the bridge had caught her across the back. it was plain that she was
injured,

 the stem.
     "we ought to get back on the bank, kehaar," he said. "how can we do it?
rabbits weren't meant for this, you know."
     "you not stop poat. but again is nudder pridge more. 'e stop 'im."
     there was nothing to be done but wait. they drifted on and came to a second
bend, where the river curved westward. the current did not slacken and the punt
came round the bend almost in the middle of the stream, revolving as it did so.
the rabbits had been frightened by what had happened to acorn and to the doe,
and remained squatting miserably, half in and half out of the bilge. hazel crept
back to the raised bow and looked ahead.
     the river broadened and the current slackened. he realized that they had
begun to drift more slowly. the nearer bank was high and the trees stood close
and thick, but on the further bank the ground was low and open. grassy, it
stretched away, smooth as the mown gallops on watership down. hazel hoped
that they might somehow drop out of the current and rea

r as they swim."
     in spite of what blackavar had said, it was a long time before everyone had left
the boat. there were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where they
were, or looked stupidly at the water until others were brought to take their place.
from time to time bigwig would ask one of the bucks to give a lead and in this
way acorn, hawkbit and bluebell all scrambled over the side. the injured doe,
thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much

woundwort?"
     "no," said blackavar, at his shoulder. "that's captain campion."
     "i see," said hazel. "well, i've heard of you, campion. i don't know whether
you mean us any harm, but the best thing you can do is to let well alone. as far as
we're concerned, our dealings with efrafa are finished."
     "you may think that," replied campion, "but you'll find it's otherwise. that doe
behind you must come with us; and so must any others that are with you."
     as he spoke, silver and acorn appeared lower down the slope, followed by
thethuthinnang. after a glance at the efrafans, silver spoke quickly to
thethuthinnang, who slipped back through the burdocks. then he came up to
hazel.
     "i've sent for the white bird, hazel," he said quietly.
     as a piece of bluff it was effective. they saw campion look upward nervously
and another of the patrol glanced back to the cover of the bushes.
     "what you're saying is stupid," said hazel to campion. "there are a lot of us

     as he came to the end of his story, dandelion remembered that he was
supposed to be relieving acorn as sentry. the post was a little way away, near the
eastern corner of the wood, and hazel -- who wanted to see how boxwood and
speedwell were getting on with a hole they were digging -- went with dandelion
along the foot of the bank. he was just going down the new hole when he noticed
that some small creature was pattering about in the grass. it was the mouse that
he had saved from the kestrel. pleased to see that he was still safe and sound,
hazel turned back to have a word with him. the mouse
