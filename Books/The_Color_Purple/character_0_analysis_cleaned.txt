[CHARACTER] 
as a young girl, [CHARACTER] is constantly subjected to abuse
and told she is ugly. she decides therefore that she can best ensure
her survival by making herself silent and invisible. [CHARACTER]'s letters
to god are her only outlet and means of self-expression. to [CHARACTER],
god is a distant figure, who she doubts cares about her concerns. 

[CHARACTER] does little to fight back against her stepfather,
alphonso. later in life, when her husband, mr. ______, abuses her,
she reacts in a similarly passive manner. however, [CHARACTER] latches
on to shug avery, a beautiful and seemingly empowered woman, as
a role model. after shug moves into [CHARACTER] and mr. ______'s home,
[CHARACTER] has the opportunity to befriend the woman whom she loves and
to learn, at last, how to fight back.
	shug's maternal prodding helps spur [CHARACTER]'s development.
gradually, [CHARACTER] recovers her own history, sexuality, spirituality,
and voice. when shug says [CHARACTER] is "still a virgin" because she
has never had a satisfying sex life, shug demonstrates to [CHARACTER]
the renewing and empowering capacity of storytelling. shug also
opens [CHARACTER]'s eyes to new ideas about religion, empowering [CHARACTER]
to believe in a nontraditional, non-patriarchal version of god. 
nettie's long-lost letters, which [CHARACTER] discovers with
shug's help hidden in mr. ______'s trunk, fortify [CHARACTER]'s sense
of self by informing her of her personal history and of the fate
of her children. as her letters show, [CHARACTER] gradually gains the
ability to synthesize her thoughts and feelings into a voice that
is fully her own. [CHARACTER]'s process of finding her own voice culminates
with her enraged explosion at mr. ______, in which she curses him
for his years of abuse and abasement. mr. ______ responds in his
characteristic insulting manner, but his put-downs have no power
once [CHARACTER] possesses the sense of self-worth she previously lacked.
	the self-actualization [CHARACTER] achieves transforms her
into a happy, successful, independent woman. [CHARACTER] takes the act
of sewing, which is traditionally thought of as a mere chore for
women who are confined to a domestic role, and turns it into an
outlet for creative self-expression and a profitable business. after
being voiceless for so many years, she is finally content, fulfilled,
and self-suf-ficient. when nettie, olivia, and adam return to georgia
from africa, [CHARACTER]'s circle of friends and family is finally reunited.
though [CHARACTER] has endured many years of hardship, she says, "[d]on't
think us feel old at all. . . . matter of fact, i think this the
youngest us ever felt."
