 billy pilgrim has come unstuck in time.
 billy has gone to sleep a senile widower and awakened on his wedding day. he has
walked through a door in 1955 and come out another one in 1941. he has gone back
through that door to find himself in 1963. he has seen his birth and death many times, he
says, and pays random visits to all the events in between.
 he says.
 billy is spastic in time, has no control over where he is goin

other wanderers, not quite so dazed, allowed billy to tag along. two of them were scouts,
and one was an antitank gunner. they were without food or maps. avoiding germans
they were delivering themselves into rural silences ever more profound. they ate snow.
 they went indian file. first came the scouts, clever, graceful quiet. they had rifles.
next came the antitank gunner, clumsy and dense, warning germans away with a colt
.45 automatic in one hand and a trench knife in the other.
 last came billy pilgrim, empty-handed, bleakly ready for death. billy was
preposterous-six feet and three inches tall, with a chest and shoulders like a box of
kitchen matches. he had no helmet, no overcoat, no weapon and no boots. on his feet
were cheap, low-cut civilian shoes which he had bought for his father's funeral. billy had
lost a heel, which made him bob up-and-down, up-and-down. the involuntary dancing up
and down, up and down, made his hip joints sore.
 billy was wearing a thin field jacket, a shirt and tr

was a model one foot high of the famous 'iron maiden of nuremburg.' the real iron
maiden was a medieval torture instrument, a sort of boiler which was shaped like a
woman on the outside-and lined with spikes. the front of the woman was composed of
two hinged doors. the idea was to put a criminal inside and then close the doors slowly.
there were two special spikes where his eyes would be. there was a drain in the bottom
to let out all the blood.
 so it goes.
 weary had told billy pilgrim about the iron maiden, about the drain in the bottom-and
what that was for. he had talked to billy about dum-dums. he told him about his father's
derringer pistol, which could be carried in a vest pocket, which was yet capable of
making a hole in a man 'which a bull bat could fly through without touching either wing.'
 weary scornfully bet billy one time that he didn't even know what a blood gutter was.
billy guessed that it was the drain in the bottom of the iron maiden, but that was wrong.

 she never did decide. she did develop a terrific hankering for a crucifix, though. and
she bought one from a sante f√© gift shop during a trip the little family made out west
during the great depression. like so many americans, she was trying to construct a life
that made sense from things she found in gift shops.
 and the crucifix went up on the wall of billy pilgrim.
 the two scouts, loving the walnut stocks of their rifles in the ditch, whispered that it
was time to move out again. ten minutes had gone by without anybody's coming to see if
they were hit or not, to finish them off. whoever had shot was evidently far away and all
alone.
 and the four crawled out of the ditch without drawing any more fire. they crawled
into a forest like the big, unlucky mammals they were. then they stood up and began to
walk quickly. the forest was dark and cold. the pines

were planted in ranks and files.
there was no undergrowth. four inches of unmarked snow blanketed the ground. the
americans had no choice but to leave trails in the show as unambiguous as diagrams in a
book on ballroom dancing--step, slide, rest-step, slide,-rest.
 'close it up and keep it closed!' roland weary warned billy pilgrim as they moved out.
weary looked like tweedledum or tweedledee, all bundled up for battle. he was short
and thick.
 he had every piece of equipment he had ever been issued, every present he'd received
from home: helmet, helmet liner, wool cap, scarf, gloves, cotton undershirt, woolen
undershirt, wool shirt, sweater, blouse, jacket, overcoat, cotton underpants, woolen
underpants, woolen trousers, cotton socks, woolen socks, combat boots, gas mask,
canteen, mess kit, first-aid kit, trench knife, b

stions such as 'where is your headquarters?' and
'how many howitzers have you?' or to tell them, 'surrender. your situation is hopeless,'
and so on.
 weary had a block of balsa wood which was supposed to be a foxhole pillow. he had a
prophylactic kit containing two tough condoms 'for the prevention of disease only!' he
had a whistle he wasn't going to show anybody until he got promoted to corporal. he had
a dirty picture of a woman attempting sexual intercourse with a shetland pony. he had
made billy pilgrim admire that picture several times.
 the woman and the pony were posed before velvet draperies which were fringed with
deedlee-balls. they were flanked by doric columns. in front of one column was a potted
palm. the picture that weary had was a print of the first dirty photograph in history. the
word photography was first used in 1839, and it was in that year, too, that louis j. m.
daguerre revealed to the french academy that an image formed on a silvered metal plate

ith a clonk. weary didn't
hear it. somewhere a big dog was barking. weary didn't hear that, either. his war story
was at a very exciting point. an officer was congratulating the three musketeers, telling
them that he was going to put them in for bronze stars.
 'anything else i can do for you boys?' said the officer.
 'yes, sir,' said one of the scouts. 'we'd like to stick together for the rest of the war, sir.
is there some way you can fix it so nobody will ever break up the three musketeers?'
 billy pilgrim had stopped in the forest. he was leaning against a tree with his eyes
closed. his head was tilted back and his nostrils were flaring. he was like a poet in the
parthenon.
 this was when billy first came unstuck in time. his attention began to swing grandly
through the full arc of his life, passing into death, which was violet light. there wasn't
anybody else there, or any thing. there was just violet light and a hum.
and then billy swung into life again, going backwards until he was in pre-bir

 dog. they had heard men calling
back and forth, too-calling like hunters who had a pretty good idea of where their quarry
was.
 the banks of the creek were high enough to allow the scouts, to stand without being
seen. billy staggered down the bank ridiculously. after him came weary, clanking and
clinking and tinkling and hot.
 'here he is, boys,' said weary. 'he don't want to live, but he's gonna live anyway.
when he gets out of this, by god, he's gonna owe his life to the three musketeers. '
 billy pilgrim, there in the creekbed, thought he, billy pilgrim, was turning to steam
painlessly. if everybody would leave him alone for just a little while, he thought, he
wouldn't cause anybody any more trouble. he would turn to steam and float up among
the treetops.
 somewhere the big dog barked again. with the help of fear and echoes and winter
silences, that dog had a voice like a big bronze gong.

said.
 billy pilgrim was having a delightful hallucination. he was wearing dry, warm, white
sweatsocks, and he was skating on a ballroom floor. thousands cheered. this wasn't
time-travel. it had never happened, never would happen. it was the craziness of a dying
young man with his shoes full of snow.
 one scout hung his head, let spit fall from his lips. the other did the same. they
studied the infinitesimal effects of spit on snow and history. they were small, graceful
people. they had been behind german lines bef

spinal cords.
 now they twisted out from under weary's loving arms. they told weary that he and
billy had better find somebody to surrender to. the scouts weren't going to wait for them
any more.
 and they ditched weary and billy in the creekbed.
 billy pilgrim went on skating, doing tricks in sweat-socks, tricks that most people
would consider impossible-making turns, stopping on a dime and so on. the cheering
went on, but its tone was altered as the hallucination gave way to time-travel.
 billy stopped skating, found himself at a lectern in a chinese restaurant in ilium, new
york, on an early afternoon in the autumn of 1957. he was receiving a standing ovation
from the lions club. he had just been elected president, and it was necessary that he

 sent back to war.
he was a very good soldier-about to quit, about to find somebody to surrender to. his
bandy legs were thrust into golden cavalry boots which he had taken from a dead
hungarian colonel on the russian front. so it goes.
 those boots were almost all he owned in this world. they were his home. an
anecdote: one time a recruit was watching him bone and wax those golden boots, and he
held one up to the recruit and said, 'if you look in there deeply enough, you'll see adam
and eve.'
 billy pilgrim had not heard this anecdote. but, lying on the black ice there, billy stared
into the patina of the corporal's boots, saw adam and eve in the golden depths. they
were naked. they were so innocent, so vulnerable, so eager to behave decently. billy
pilgrim loved them.
 next to the golden boots were a pair of feet which were swaddled in rags. they were
crisscrossed by canvas straps, were shod with hinged wooden clogs. billy looked up at
the face that went with the clogs. it was the face of a blond

n copy of the review of
optometry there. it was opened to an editorial, which billy now read, his lips moving
slightly.
what happens in 1968 will rule the fare of european optometrists for at least 50
years! billy read. with this warning, jean thiriart, secretary of the national union of
belgium opticians, is pressing for formation of a 'european optometry society.' the
alternatives, he says, will be the obtaining of professional status, or, by 1971, reduction
to the role of spectacle-sellers.
 billy pilgrim tried hard to care.
 a siren went off, scared the hell out of him. he was expecting the third world war at
any time. the siren was simply announcing high noon. it was housed in a cupola atop a
firehouse across the street from billy's office.
 billy closed his eyes. when he opened them, he was back in the second world war
again. his head was on the wounded rabbi's shoulder. a german was kicking his feet,
telling him to wake up, that it was time to move on.
 the americans, with billy among them,

 wanted to talk
about something. the light had changed. billy did the simplest thing. he drove on.
 billy drove through a scene of even greater desolation. it looked like dresden after it
was fire-bombed-like the surface of the moon. the house where billy had grown up used
to be somewhere in what was so empty now. this was urban renewal. a new ilium
government center and a pavilion of the arts and a peace lagoon and high-rise
apartment buildings were going up here soon.
 that was all right with billy pilgrim.
 the speaker at the lions club meeting was a major in the marines. he said that
americans had no choice but to keep fighting in vietnam until they achieved victory or
until the communists realized that they could not force their way of life on weak
countries. the major had been there on two separate tours of duty. he told of many
terrible and many wonderful things he had seen. he was in favor of increased bombings,
of bombing north vietnam back into the stone age, if it refused to see reason.

was simply having lunch with
the lions club, of which he was past president now.
 billy had a framed prayer on his office wall which expressed his method for keeping
going, even though he was unenthusiastic about living. a lot of patients who saw the
prayer on billy's wall told him that it helped them to keep going, too. it went like this
god grant me
the serenity to accept
the things i cannot change
courage
to change the things i can,
and wisdom always
to tell the
difference.
 among the things billy pilgrim could not change were the past, the present and the
future.
 now he was being introduced to the marine major. the person who was performing
the introduction was telling the major that billy was a veteran, and that billy had a son
who was a sergeant in the green berets-in vietnam.
 the major told billy that the green berets were doing a great job, and that he should
be proud of his son.
 'i am. i certainly am,' said billy pilgrim.
 he went home for a nap after lunch. he was under doctor's orders

 to take a nap every
day. the doctor hoped that this would relieve a complaint that billy had: every so often,
for no apparent reason, billy pilgrim would find himself weeping. nobody had ever
caught billy doing it. only the doctor knew. it was an extremely quiet thing billy did,
and not very moist.
 billy owned a lovely georgian home in ilium. he was rich as croesus, something he
had never expected to be, not in a million years. he had five other optometrists working
for him in the shopping plaza location, and netted over sixty thousand dollars a year. in
addition, he owned a fifth of the new holiday inn out on route 54, and half of three

but sleep would not come. tears came instead. they seeped. billy turned on the magic
fingers, and he was jiggled as he wept.
 the doorchimes rang. billy got off the bed and looked down through a window at the
front doorstep, to see if somebody important had come to call. there was a crippled man
down there, as spastic in space as billy pilgrim was in time. convulsions made the man
dance flappingly all the time, made him change his expressions, too, as though he were
trying to imitate various famous movie stars.
 another cripple was ringing a doorbell across the street. he was on crutches. he had
only one leg. he was so jammed between his crutches that his shoulders hid his ears.
 billy knew what the cripples were up to: they were selling subscriptions to magazines
that would never come. people subscribed to them because the salesmen

 boys?'
this was a man who had lost an entire regiment, about forty-five hundred men-a lot of
them children, actually. billy didn't reply. the question made no sense.
 'what was your outfit?' said the colonel. he coughed and coughed. every time he
inhaled his lungs rattled like greasy paper bags.
 billy couldn't remember the outfit he was from.
 'you from the four-fifty-first?'
 'four-fifty-first what?' said billy.
 there was a silence. 'infantry regiment,' said the colonel at last.
 'oh,' said billy pilgrim.
 there was another long silence, with the colonel dying and dying, drowning where he
stood. and then he cried out wetly, 'it's me, boys! it's wild bob!' that is what he had
always wanted his troops to call him: 'wild bob.'
 none of the people who could hear him were actually from his regiment, except for
roland weary, and weary wasn't listening. all weary could think of was the agony in
his own feet.
 but the colonel imagined that he was addressing his beloved troops for the last time,
and he

had never heard of the four-fiftyfirst.
he said that after the war he was going to have a regimental reunion in his home
town, which was cody, wyoming. he was going to barbecue whole steers.
 he said all this while staring into billy's eyes. he made the inside of poor bill's skull
echo with balderdash. 'god be with you, boys!' he said, and that echoed and echoed. and
then he said. 'if you're ever in cody, wyoming, just ask for wild bob!' i was there. so
was my old war buddy, bernard v. o'hare.
 billy pilgrim was packed into a boxcar with many other privates. he and roland
weary were separated. weary was packed into another car in the same train.
 there were narrow ventilators at the comers of the car, under the eaves. billy stood by
one of these, and, as the crowd pressed against him, he climbed part way up a diagonal
corner brace to make more room. he placed his eyes on a level with the ventilator, so he
could see another train about ten yards away.

omer with billy was a former hobo who was forty years old.
 'i been hungrier than this,' the hobo told billy. 'i been in worse places than this. this

 a man in a boxcar across the way called out through the ventilator that a man had just
died in there. so it goes. there were four guards who heard him. they weren't excited by
the news.
 'yo, yo,' said one, nodding dreamily. 'yo, yo.'
 and the guards didn't open the car with the dead man in it. they opened the next car
instead, and billy pilgrim was enchanted by what was in there. it was like heaven. there
was candlelight, and there were bunks with quilts and blankets heaped on them. there
was a cannonball stove with a steaming coffeepot on top. there was a table with a bottle
of wine and a loaf of bread and a sausage on it. there were four bowls of soup.
 there were pictures of castles and lakes and pretty girls on the walls. this was the
rolling home of the railroad guards, men whose business it was to be forever guarding

orange and black, indicating that the train was not fair game for airplanes that it was
carrying prisoners of war.
 the war was nearly over. the locomotives began to move east in late december. the
war would end in may. german prisons everywhere were absolutely full, and there was
no longer any food for the prisoners to eat, and no longer any fuel to keep them warm.
and yet--here came more prisoners.
 billy pilgrim's train, the longest train of all, did not move for two days.
 'this ain't bad,' the hobo told billy on the second day. 'this ain't nothing at all.'
 billy looked out through the ventilator. the railroad yard was a desert now, except for
a hospital train marked with red crosses-on a siding far, far away. its locomotive
whistled. the locomotive of billy pilgrim's train whistled back. they were saying,
'hello.'
 even though billy's train wasn't moving., its boxcars were kept locked tight. nobody

umped them. billy was a dumper. the human beings also
passed canteens, which guards would fill with water. when food came in, the human
beings were quiet and trusting and beautiful. they shared.
 human beings in there took turns standing or lying down. the legs of those who stood
were like fence posts driven into a warm., squirming, fatting, sighing earth. the queer
earth was a mosaic of sleepers who nestled like spoons.
 now the train began to creep eastward.
 somewhere in there was christmas. billy pilgrim nestled like a spoon with the hobo
on christmas night, and he fell asleep, and he traveled in time to 1967 again-to the night
he was kidnapped by a flying saucer from tralfamadore.

 billy pilgrim could not sleep on his daughters wedding night. he was forty-four. the
wedding had taken place that afternoon in a gaily striped tent in billy's backyard. the
stripes were orange and black.

heaped in the middle of the room were all the possessions she could not take on a

tiny night light stared at billy. and then it rang.
 billy answered. there was a drunk on the other end. billy could almost smell his
breath-mustard gas and roses. it was a wrong number. billy hung up. there was a soft
drink bottle on the windowsill. its label boasted that it contained no nourishment
whatsoever.
 billy pilgrim padded downstairs on his blue and ivory feet. he went into the kitchen,
where the moonlight called his attention to a half bottle of champagne on the kitchen
table, all that was left from the reception in the tent. somebody had stoppered it again.

 so billy uncorked it with his thumbs. it didn't make a pop. the champagne was dead.

touchingly, it was mainly women who did this work. the minerals were then shipped to
specialists in remote areas. it was their business to put them into the ground., to hide
them cleverly, so they would never hurt anybody ever again.
 the american fliers turned in their uniforms, became high school kids. and hitler

extrapolating. everybody turned into a baby, and all humanity, without exception,
conspired biologically to produce two perfect people named adam and eve, he supposed.
 billy saw the war movies backwards then forwards-and then it was time to go out into
his backyard to meet the flying saucer. out he went, his blue and ivory feet crushing the
wet salad of the lawn. he stopped, took a swig, of the dead champagne. it was like 7-up.

tralfamadore up there. he would see it soon enough, inside and out, and he would see,
too, where it came from soon enough-soon enough.
 overhead he heard the cry of what might have been a melodious owl, but it wasn't a
melodious owl. it was a flying saucer from tralfamadore, navigating in both space and
time, therefore seeming to billy pilgrim to have come from nowhere all at once.
somewhere a big dog barked.
 the saucer was one hundred feet in diameter, with portholes around its rim. the light
from the portholes was a pulsing purple. the only noise it made was the owl song. it
came down to hover over billy, and to enclose him in a cylinder of pulsing in purple
light. now there was the sound of a seeming kiss as an airtight hatch in the bottom of the
saucer was opened. down snaked a ladder that was outlined in pretty lights like a fe

 so billy stood up again, clung to the cross-brace. 'where can i sleep?' he asked
quietly.

 'not with me, you son of a bitch,' said somebody else. 'you yell. you kick.'
 'i do?'
 "you're god damn right you do. and whimper.'
 'i do?'
 'keep the hell away from here, pilgrim.'
 and now there was an acrimonious madrigal, with parts sung in all quarters of the car.
nearly everybody seemingly, had an atrocity story of something billy pilgrim had done
to him in his sleep. everybody told billy pilgrim to keep the hell away.
 so billy pilgrim had to sleep standing up, or not sleep at all. and food had stopped
coming in through the ventilators, and the days and nights were colder all the time.
 on the eighth day, the forty-year-old hobo said to billy, 'this ain't bad. i can be

 'you can?' said billy.
 on the ninth day, the hobo died. so it goes. his last words were, 'you think this is bad?

 weary, in his nearly continuous delirium, told again and again of the three
musketeers, acknowledged that he was dying, gave many messages to be delivered to his
family in pittsburgh. above all, he wanted to be avenged, so he said again and again the
name of the person who had killed him. everyone on the car learned the lesson well.
 'who killed me?' he would ask.
 and everybody knew the answer, which was this: 'billy pilgrim.'
 listen--on the tenth night the peg was pulled out of the hasp on billy's boxcar door,
and the door was opened. billy pilgrim was lying at an angle on the corner-brace, selfcrucified,
holding himself there with a blue and ivory claw hooked over the sill of the
ventilator. billy coughed when the door was opened, and when he coughed he shit thin

 it was the guards' firmly expressed wish that every american without an overcoat
should take one. the coats were cemented together with ice, so the guards used their
bayonets as ice picks, pricking free collars and hems and sleeves and so on, then peeling
off coats and handing them out at random. the coats were stiff and dome-shaped, having
conformed to their piles.
 the coat that billy pilgrim got had been crumpled and frozen in such a way, and was
so small, that it appeared to be not a coat but a sort of large black, three-cornered hat.
there were gummy stains on it, too, like crankcase drainings or old strawberry jam.
there seemed to be a dead, furry animal frozen to it. the animal was in fact the coat's fur
collar.
 billy glanced dully at the coats of his neighbors. their coats all had brass buttons or

 the worst american body wasn't billy's. the worst body belonged to a car thief from
cicero, illinois. ms name was paul lazzaro. he was tiny, and not only were his bones
and teeth rotten, but his skin was disgusting. lazzaro was polka-dotted all over with
dime-sized scars. he had had many plagues of boils.
 lazzaro, too, had been on roland weary's boxcar, and had given his word of honor to
weary that he would find some way to make billy pilgrim pay for weary's death. he was
looking around now, wondering which naked human being was billy.
 the naked americans took their places under many showerheads along a white-tiled
wall. there were no faucets they could control. they could only wait for whatever was
coming. their penises were shriveled and their balls were retracted. reproduction was
not the main business of the evening.

and the sun went behind a cloud. billy was momentarily dizzy. when he recovered, he
wasn't on the golf course any more. he was strapped to a yellow contour chair in a white
chamber aboard a flying saucer, which was bound for tralfamadore.
 'where am i?' said billy pilgrim.
 'trapped in another blob of amber, mr. pilgrim. we are where we have to be just nowthree
hundred million miles from earth, bound for a time warp which will get us to
tralfamadore in hours rather than centuries.'
 'how-how did i get here?'
 'it would take another earthling to explain it to you. earthlings are the great explainers,

 'if i hadn't spent so much time studying earthlings,' said the tralfamadorian, 'i
wouldn't have any idea what was meant by "free will." i've visited thirty-one inhabited
planets in the universe, and i have studied reports on one hundred more. only on earth is

 billy pilgrim says that the universe does not look like a lot of bright little dots to the
creatures from tralfamadore. the creatures can see where each star has been and where it
is going, so that the

 billy asked for something to read on the trip to tralfamadore. his captors had five
million earthling books on microfilm, but no way to project them in billy's cabin. they
had only one actual book in english, which would be placed in a tralfamadorian
museum. it was valley of the dolls, by jacqueline susann.

k in the war, back in the
delousing station again. the shower was over. an unseen hand had turned the water off.
 when billy got his clothes back, they weren't any cleaner, but all the little animals that
had been living in them were dead. so it goes. and his new overcoat was thawed out and
limp now. it was much too small for billy. it had a fur collar and a g of crimson silk, and
had apparently been made for an impresario about as big as an organ-grinder's monkey. it
was full of bullet holes.
 billy pilgrim dressed himself. he put on the little overcoat, too. it split up the back,
and, at the shoulders, the sleeves came entirely free. so the coat became a fur-collared

all of the second world war. they laughed and laughed.
 and the germans told everybody else to form in ranks of five, with billy as their pivot.

english, and he hauled the american out of ranks knocked him down.
 the american was astonished. he stood up shakily, spitting blood. he'd had two teeth
knocked out. he had meant no harm by what he'd said, evidently, had no idea that the
guard would hear and understand.
 'why me?' he asked the guard.
 the guard shoved him back into ranks. 'vy you? vy anybody?' he said.
 when billy pilgrim's name was inscribed in the ledger of the prison camp, he was
given a number, too, and an iron dogtag in which that number was stamped. a slave
laborer from poland had done the stamping. he was dead now. so it goes.
 billy was told to hang the tag around his neck along with his american dogtags, which
he did. the tag was like a salt cracker, perforated down its middle so that a strong man
could snap it in two with his bare hands. in case billy died, which he didn't, half the tag

half for tennis or croquet. they were so elated by their own hospitality, and by all the
goodies waiting inside, that they did not take a good look at their guests while they sang.
and they imagined that they were singing to fellow officers fresh from the fray.
 they wrestled the americans toward the shed door affectionately, filling the night with
manly blather and brotherly rodomontades. they called them 'yank,' told them 'good
show,' promised them that 'jerry was on the run,' and so on.
 billy pilgrim wondered dimly who jerry was.
 now he was indoors., next to an iron cookstove that was glowing cherry red. dozens
of teapots were boiling there. some of them had whistles. and there was a witches'
cauldron full of golden soup. the soup was thick. primeval bubbles surfaced it with
lethargical majesty as billy pilgrim stared.
 there were long tables set for a banquet. at each place was a bowl made from a can
that had once contained powdered milk. a smaller can was a cup. a taller, more slender

 of fresh baked
white bread on the tables, gobs of butter, pots of marmalade. there were platters of sliced
beef from cans. soup and scrambled eggs and hot marmalade pie were yet to come.
 and, at the far end of the shed, billy saw pink arches with azure draperies hanging
between them, and an enormous clock, and two golden thrones, and a bucket and a mop.
it was in this setting that the evening's entertainment would take place, a musical version
of cinderella, the most popular story ever told.
 billy pilgrim was on fire, having stood too close to the glowing stove. the hem of his
little coat was burning. it was a quiet, patient sort of fire-like the burning of punk.
 billy wondered ff there was a telephone somewhere. he wanted to call his mother, to
tell her he was alive and well.
 there was silence now, as the englishmen looked in astonishment at the frowsy
creatures they had so lustily waltzed inside. one of the englishmen saw that billy was on
fire. 'you're on fire lad!' he said, and he got bill

hat became of your boots, lad?'
 'i don't remember.'
 'is that coat a joke?'
 'sir?'
 'where did you get such a thing?'
 billy had to think hard about that. 'they gave it to me,' he said at last.
 'jerry gave it to you?'
 'who? '
 'the germans gave it to you?'
 'yes.'
 billy didn't like the questions. they were fatiguing.
 'ohhhh-yank, yank, yank,' said the englishman, 'that coat was an insult,
 'sir? '
 'it was a deliberate attempt to humiliate you. you mustn't let jerry do things like that.'
 billy pilgrim swooned.
 billy came to on a chair facing the stage. he had somehow eaten, and now he was
watching cinderella. some part of him had evidently been enjoying the performance for
quite a while. billy was laughing hard.
 the women in the play were really men, of course. the clock had just struck midnight
and cinderella was lamenting
'goodness me, the clock has struckalackaday,
and fuck my luck.'
 billy found the couplet so comical that he not only laughed-he shrieked. he went on
shrieking until he

another, where the hospital was. it
was a six-bed hospital. there weren't any other patients in there.
 billy was put to bed and tied down, and given a shot of morphine. another american
volunteered to watch over him. this volunteer was edgar derby, the high school teacher
who would be shot to death in dresden. so it goes.
 derby sat on a three-legged stool. he was given a book to read. the book was the red
badge of courage, by stephen crane. derby had read it before. now he read it again
while billy pilgrim entered a morphine paradise.
 under morphine, billy had a dream of giraffes in a garden. the giraffes were following
gravel paths, were pausing to munch sugar pears from treetops. billy was a giraffe, too.
he ate a pear. it was a hard one. it fought back against his grinding teeth. it snapped in
juicy protest.
 the giraffes accepted billy as one of their own, as a harmless creature as
preposterously specialized as themselves. two approached him from opposite sides,
leaned against him. they had

long, muscular upper lips which they could shape like the
bells of bugles. they kissed him with these. they were female giraffes-cream and lemon
yellow. they had horns like doorknobs. the knobs were covered with velvet.
 why?
 night came to the garden of the giraffes, and billy pilgrim slept without dreaming for a
while, and then he traveled in time. he woke up with his head under a blanket in a ward
for nonviolent mental patients in a veterans' hospital near lake placid, new york. it was
springtime in 1948, three years after the end of the war.
 billy uncovered his head. the windows of the ward were open. birds were twittering
outside. 'poo-tee-weet?' one asked him. the sun was high. there were twenty-nine other
patients assigned to the ward, but they were all outdoors now,

enjoying the day. they
were free to come and go as they pleased, to go home, even., if they liked-and so was
billy pilgrim. they had come here voluntarily, alarmed by the outside world.
 billy had committed himself in the middle of his final year at the ilium school of
optometry. nobody else suspected that he was going crazy. everybody else thought he
looked fine and was acting fine. now he was in the hospital. the doctors agreed: he was
going crazy.
 they didn't think it had anything to do with the war. they were sure billy was going to
pieces because his father had thrown him into the deep end of the y.m.c.a. swi

 'billy' said valencia merble.
 'hm?'
 'you want to talk about our silver pattern? '
 'sure.'
 'i've got it narrowed down pretty much to either royal danish or rambler rose.'
 'rambler rose,' said billy.
 'it isn't something we should rush into,' she said. 'i mean whatever we decide on, that's
what we're going to have to live with the rest of our lives.'
 billy studied the pictures. 'royal danish.' he said at last.
 'colonial moonlight is nice, too.'
 'yes, it is,' said billy pilgrim.
 and billy traveled in time to the zoo on tralfamadore. he was forty-four years old, on
display under a geodesic dome. he was reclining on the lounge chair which had been his
cradle during his trip through space. he was naked. the tralfamadorians were
interested in his body-all of it. there were thousands of them outside, holding up their
little hands so that their eyes could see him. billy had been on tralfamadore for six
earthling months now. he was used to the crowd.

oenails. he shaved and sprayed
deodorant under his arms, while a zoo guide on a raised platform outside explained what
billy was doing-and why. the guide was lecturing telepathically, simply standing there,
sending out thought waves to the crowd. on the platform with him was the little
keyboard instrument with which he would relay questions to billy from the crowd.
now the first question came-from the speaker on the television set: 'are you happy here?'
 'about as happy as i was on earth,' said billy pilgrim, which was true.
 there were fives sexes on tralfamadore, each of them performing a step necessary in
the creation of a new individual. they looked identical to billy-because their sex
differences were all in the fourth dimension.
 one of the biggest moral bombshells handed to billy by the tralfamadorians,
incidentally, had to do with sex on earth. they said their flying-saucer crews had
identified no fewer than seven sexes on earth, each essential to reproduction. again:

too. '
 'of course.'
 'but you do have a peaceful planet here.'
 'today we do. on other days we have wars as horrible as any you've ever seen or read
about. there isn't anything we can do about them, so we simply don't look at them. we
ignore them. we spend eternity looking at pleasant moments-like today at the zoo. isn't
this a nice moment?'
 'yes.'
 'that's one thing earthlings might learn to do, if they tried hard enough: ignore the
awful times, and concentrate on the good ones.'
 'um,' said billy pilgrim.
 shortly after he went to sleep that night, billy traveled in time to another moment
which was quite nice, his wedding night with the former valencia merble. he had been
out of the veterans' hospital for six months. he was all well. he had graduated from the
ilium school of optometry-third in his class of forty-seven.
 now he was in bed with valencia in a delightful studio apartment which was built on
the end of a wharf on cape ann, massachusetts. across the water were the lights of
gloucester

lights on. its empty holds were resonant, made the song of the engines rich and loud.
the wharf began to sing the same song, and then the honeymooners' headboard sang, too.
and it continued to sing long after the dragger was gone.
 'thank you,' said valencia at last. the headboard was singing a mosquito song.
 'you're welcome.'
 'it was nice.'
 'i'm glad.'
 then she began to cry.
 'what's the matter?'
 'i'm so happy.'
 'good.'
 'i never thought anybody would marry me.'
 'um,' said billy pilgrim.
 'i'm going to lose weight for you,' she said.
 'what?'
 'i'm going to go on a diet. i'm going to become beautiful for you.'
 'i like you just the way you are.'
 'do you really?'
 'really,' said billy pilgrim. he had already seen a lot of their marriage, thanks to timetravel,
knew that it was going to be at least bearable all the way.
 a great motor yacht named the scheherezade now slid past the marriage bed. the
song its engines sang was a very low organ note. all her lights were on.

utiful people, a young man and a young woman in evening clothes, were at the
rail at the stem, loving each other and their dreams and the wake. they were
honeymooning, too. they were lance rumfoord, of newport, rhode island, and his
bride, the former cynthia landry., who had been a childhood sweetheart of john f.
kennedy in hyannis port, massachusetts.
 there was a slight coincidence here. billy pilgrim would later share a hospital room
with rumfoord's uncle, professor bertram copeland rumfoord of harvard, official
historian of the united states air force.
 when the beautiful people were past, valencia questioned her funny-looking husband
about war. it was a simple-minded thing for a female earthling to do, to associate sex
and glamor with war.
 'do you ever think about the war?' she said, laying a hand on his thigh.
 'sometimes,' said billy pilgrim.
 'i look at you sometimes,' said valencia,

secrets.'
 'i'm not,' said billy. this was a lie, of course. he hadn't told anybody about all the
time traveling he'd done, about tralfamadore and so on.
 'you must have secrets about the war. or, not secrets, i guess, but things you don't
want to talk about.'
 'no.'
 'i'm proud you were a soldier. do you know that?'
 'good.'
 'was it awful?'
 'sometimes.' a crazy thought now occurred to billy. the truth of it startled him. it
would make a good epitaph for billy pilgrim-and for me, too.
 'would you talk about the war now, if i wanted you to?' said valencia. in a tiny cavity
in her great body she was assembling the materials for a green beret.
 'it would sound like a dream,' said billy. 'other people's dreams aren't very interesting
usually.'
 'i heard you tell father one time about a german firing squad.' she was referring to the
execution of poor old edgar derby.
 'um.'
 'you had to bury him? '
 'yes.'
 did he see you with your shovels before he was shot?'

 billy reeled away from his vision of hell. he passed three englishmen who were
watching the excrement festival from a distance. they were catatonic with disgust.
 'button your pants!' said one as billy went by.
so billy buttoned his pants. he came to the door of the little hospital by accident. he
went through the door, and found himself honeymooning again, going from the bathroom
back to bed with his bride on cape ann.
 'i missed you' said valencia.
 'i missed you,' said billy pilgrim.
 billy and valencia went to sleep nestled like spoons, and billy traveled in time back to
the train ride he had taken in 194 4 from maneuvers in south carolina to his father's
funeral in ilium. he hadn't seen europe or combat yet. this was still in the days of steam
locomotives.
 billy had to change trains a lot. all the trains were slow. the coaches stunk of coal
smoke and rationed tobacco and rationed booze and the farts of people eating wartime
food. the upholstery of the iron seats was bri

 campbell told what the german experience with captured american enlisted men had
been. they were known everywhere to be the most self-pitying, least fraternal and dirtiest
of all prisoners of war, said campbell. they were incapable of concerted action on their
own behalf. they despised any leader from among their own number, refused to follow
or even listen to him, on the grounds that he was no better than they were, that he should
stop putting on airs.
 and so on. billy pilgrim went to sleep, woke up as a widower in his empty home in
ilium. his daughter barbara was reproaching him for writing ridiculous letters to the
newspapers.
 'did you hear what i said?' barbara inquired. it was 1968 again.
 'of course.' he had been dozing.
 'if you're going to act like a child, maybe we'll just have to treat you like a child.'
 'that isn't what happens next,' said billy.
 'we'll see what happens next.' big barbara now embraced herself. 'it's awfully cold in
here. is the heat on?'

o unpleasant to
see. the head zoo keeper ordered a crane operator, who was standing by, to drop a navy
blue canopy over the dome, thus simulating earthling night inside. real night came to the
zoo for only one earthling hour out of every sixty-two.
 billy switched on a floor lamp. the light from the single source threw the baroque
detailing of montana's body into sharp relief. billy was reminded of fantastic architecture
in dresden, before it was bombed.
 in time, montana came to love and trust billy pilgrim. he did not touch her until she
made it clear that she wanted him to. after she had been on tralfamadore for what would
have been an earthling week, she asked him shyly if he wouldn't sleep with her. which
he did. it was heavenly.
 and billy traveled in time from that delightful bed to a bed in 1968. it was his bed in
ilium, and the electric blanket was turned up high. he was drenched in sweat,
remembered groggily that his daughter had put him to bed, had told him to stay there
until the oil bu

 while he examined the boy's eyes, billy told him matter-of-factly about his adventures
on tralfamadore, assured the fatherless boy that his father was very much alive still in
moments the boy would see again and again.
 'isn't that comforting?' billy asked.
 and somewhere in there, the boy's mother went out and told the receptionist that billy
was evidently going crazy. billy was taken home. his daughter asked him again, 'father,

listen:
 billy pilgrim says he went to dresden germany, on the day after his morphine night in
the british compound in the center of the extermination camp for russian prisoners of
war. billy woke up at dawn on that day in january. there were no windows in the little
hospital, and the ghostly candles had gone out. so the only light came from pin-prick
holes in the walls, and from a sketchy rectangle that outlined the imperfectly fitted door.
little paul lazzaro, with a broken arm, snored on one bed. edgar derby, the

 cot, dared to touch it here and
there. he was seeking the exact source of the radiations.
 he found two small sources, two lumps an inch apart and hidden in the lining. one was
shaped like a pea. the other was shaped like a tiny horseshoe. billy received a message
carried by the radiations. he was told not to find out what the lumps were. he was
advised to be content with knowing that they could work miracles for him, provided he
did not insist on learning their nature. that was all right with billy pilgrim. he was
grateful. he was glad.
 billy dozed, awakened in the prison hospital again. the sun was high. outside were
golgotha sounds of strong men digging holes for upright timbers in hard, hard ground.
englishmen were building themselves a new latrine. they had abandoned their old latrine
to the americans and their theater, the place where the feast had been held, too.
 six englishmen staggered through a hospital with a pool table on which several
mattresses were piled. they were transferring it

ross my friends.'
 'you have friends?' derby wanted to know.
 'in the war?' said lazzaro. 'yeah-i had a friend in the war. he's dead.' so it goes.
 'that's too bad.'
 lazzaro's eyes were twinkling again. 'yeah. he was my buddy on the boxcar. his
name was roland weary. he died in my arms.' now he pointed to billy with his one
mobile hand. 'he died on account of this silly cocksucker here. so i promised him
i'd have this silly cocksucker shot after the war.'
 lazzaro erased with his hand anything billy pilgrim might be about to say. 'just forget
about it, kid,' he said. 'enjoy life while you can. nothing's gonna happen for maybe five,
ten, fifteen, twenty years. but lemme give you a piece of advice: whenever the doorbell
rings, have somebody else answer the door.'
 billy pilgrim says now that this really is the way he is going to die, too. as a timetraveler,
he has seen his own death many times, has described it to a tape recorder. the
tape is locked up with his will and some other valuables in his s

 of the country is behind him. it is a hereford bull on a field of

to laugh with him. 'it is high time i was dead..' he says. 'many years ago.' he said, 'a
certain man promised to have me killed. he is an old man now, living not far from here.
he has read all the publicity associated with my appearance in your fair city. he is
insane. tonight he will keep his promise.'
 there are protests from the crowd.
 billy pilgrim rebukes them. 'if you protest, if you think that death is a terrible thing,
then you have not understood a word i've said.' now he closes his speech as he closes
every speech with these words: 'farewell, hello, farewell, hello.'
 there are police around him as he leaves the stage. they are there to protect him from
the crush of popularity. no threats on his life have been made since 1945. the police
offer to stay with him. they are floridly willing to stand in a circle around him all night,

 'no, no,' says billy serenely. 'it is time for you to go home to your wives and children,
and it is time for me to be dead for a little while-and then live again.' at that moment,
billy's high forehead is in the cross hairs of a high-powered laser gun. it is aimed at him
from the darkened press box. in the next moment, billy pilgrim is dead. so it goes.
 so billy experiences death for a while. it is simply violet light and a hum. there isn't
anybody else there. not even billy pilgrim is there.
 then he swings back into life again, all the way back to an hour after his life was
threatened by lazzaro-in 1945. he has been told to get out of his hospital bed and dress,
that he is well. he and lazzaro and poor old edgar derby are to join their fellows in the
theater. there they will choose a leader for themselves by secret ballot in a free election.
 billy and lazzaro and poor old edgar derby crossed the prison yard to the theater
now. billy was carrying his little coat as thoug

ts and mattresses, so they had none. they had to improvise. the only
space open to them was up on the stage, and they went up there, pulled the azure curtains
down, made nests.
 billy, curled in his azure nest, found himself staring at cinderella's silver boots under a
throne. and then he remembered that his shoes were ruined, that he needed boots. he
hated to get out of his nest, but he forced himself to do it. he crawled to the boots on all
fours, sat, tried them on.
 the boots fit perfectly. billy pilgrim was cinderella, and cinderella was billy pilgrim.
 somewhere in there was a lecture on personal hygiene by the head englishman, and
then a free election. at least half the americans went on snoozing through it all. the
englishman' got up on the stage, and he rapped on the arm of a throne with a swagger
stick, called, 'lads, lads, lad i have your attention, please?' and so on.
 what the englishman said about survival was this 'if you stop taking pride in your
appearance, you will very soon die.'

ently a very easy and painless way to go.' so it goes.
 the englishman said that he, when captured, had made and kept the following vows to
himself: to brush his teeth twice a day, to shave once a day, to wash his face and hands
before every meal and after going to the latrine, to polish his shoes once a day, to
exercise for at least half an hour each morning and then move his bowels, and to look into
a mirror frequently, frankly evaluating his appearance, particularly with respect to
posture.
 billy pilgrim heard all this while lying in his nest. he looked not at the englishman's
face but his ankles.
 'i envy you lads,' said the englishman.
 somebody laughed. billy wondered what the joke was.
 'you lads are leaving this afternoon for dresden-a beautiful city, i'm told. you won't be
cooped up like us. you'll be out where the life is, and the food is certain to be more
plentiful than here. if i may inject a personal note: it has been five years now since i have

e temperature climbed startlingly that day. the noontime was balmy. the germans
brought soup and bread in two-wheeled carts which were pulled by russians. the
englishmen sent over real coffee and sugar and marmalade and cigarettes and cigars, and
the doors of the theater were left open, so the warmth could get in.
 the americans began to feel much better. they were able to hold their food. and then
it was time to go to dresden. the americans marched fairly stylishly out of the british
compound. billy pilgrim again led the parade. he had silver boots now, and a muff, and a
piece of azure curtain which he wore like a toga. billy still had a beard. so did poor old
edgar derby, who was beside him. derby was imagining letters to home, his lips
working tremulously.
 dear margaret-we are leaving for dresden today. don't worry. it will never be
bombed. it is an open city. there was an election at noon, and guess what? and so on.
 they came to the prison railroad yard again. they had arrived on only two car

it goes.
 the trip to dresden was a lark. it took only two hours. shriveled little bellies were full.
sunlight and cold air came in through the ventilators. there were plenty of smokes from
the englishmen.
 the americans arrived in dresden at five in the afternoon. the boxcar doors were
opened, and the doorways framed the loveliest city that most of the americans had ever
seen. the skyline was intricate and voluptuous and enchanted and absurd. it looked like a
sunday school picture of heaven to billy pilgrim.
 somebody behind him in the boxcar said, 'oz.' that was i. that was me. the only
other city i'd ever seen was indianapolis, indiana.
 every other big city in germany had been bombed and burned ferociously. dresden
had not suffered so much as a cracked windowpane. sirens went off every day, screamed
like hell, and people went down into cellars and listened to radios there. the planes were
always bound for someplace else-leipzig, chemnitz, plauen, places like that. so it goes.

ather and his grandson were in the squad. the grandfather was an

 the eight were grim as they approached the boxcars containing their wards. they
knew what sick and foolish soldiers they themselves appeared to be. one of them actually
had an artificial leg, and carried not only a loaded rifle but a cane. still they were
expected to earn obedience and respect from tall cocky, murderous american
infantrymen who had just come from all the killing of the front.
 and then they saw bearded billy pilgrim in his blue toga and silver shoes, with his
hands in a muff. he looked at least sixty years old. next to billy was little paul lazzaro
with a broken arm. he was fizzing with rabies. next to lazzaro was the poor old high
school teacher, edgar derby, mournfully pregnant with patriotism and middle age and
imaginary wisdom. and so on.
 the eight ridiculous dresdeners ascertained that these hundred ridiculous creatures
really were american fighting men fresh from the front. they smiled, and then the

laughed. their terror evaporated. there was nothing to be afraid of. here were more
crippled human beings, more fools like themselves. here was light opera.
 so out of the gate of the railroad yard and into the streets of dresden marched the light
opera. billy pilgrim was the star. he led the parade. thousands of people were on the
sidewalks, going home from work. they were watery and putty-colored, having eaten
mostly potatoes during the past two years. they had expected no blessings beyond the
mildness of the day. suddenly-here was fun.
 billy did not meet many of the eyes that found him so entertaining. he was enchanted
by the architecture of the city. merry amoretti wove garlands above windows. roguish
fauns and naked nymphs peeked down at billy from fes

oners of war. there were bunks in there, and two potbellied stoves
and a water tap. behind it was a latrine, which was a one-rail fence with buckets under it.
 there was a big number over the door of the building. the number was five. before
the americans could go inside, their only english-speaking guard told them to memorize
their simple address, in case they got lost in the big city. their address was this:
'schlachth√∂f-funf.' schlachth√∂f meant slaughterhouse. funf was good old five.

billy pilgrim got onto a chartered airplane in ilium twenty-five years after that. he knew
he was going to crash, but he didn't want to make a fool of himself by saying so. it was
supposed to carry billy and twenty-eight other optometrists to a convention in montreal.
 his wife, valencia, was outside, and his father-in-law, lionel merble, was strapped to
the seat beside him.
 lionel merble was a machine. tralfamadorians, of course, say that every creature and
plant in the universe is a machine. it amuses the

 billy's father-in-law laughed and laughed at that, and he begged the quartet to sing the
other polish song he liked so much. so they sang a song from the pennsylvania coal
mines that began:
 me, and mike, ve vork in mine.
 holy shit, ve have good time.

 holy shit, no vork next day.
 speaking of people from poland: billy pilgrim accidentally saw a pole hanged in
public, about three days after billy got to dresden. billy just happened to be walking to
work with some others shortly after sunrise, and they came to a gallows and a small
crowd in front of a soccer stadium. the pole was a farm laborer who was being hanged
for having had sexual intercourse with a german woman. so it goes.
 billy, knowing the plane was going to crash pretty soon, closed his eyes, traveled in
time back to 1944. he was back in the forest in luxe

 the barbershop quartet on the airplane was singing 'wait till the sun shines, nelly,'
when the plane smacked into the top of sugarbush mountain in vermont. everybody was
killed but billy and the copilot. so it goes.
 the people who first got to the crash scene were young austrian ski instructors from
the famous ski resort below. they spoke to each other in german as they went from body
to body. they wore black wind masks with two holes for their eyes and a red topknot.

 she had two big cans of soup for the americans. it was simmering over low fires on
the gas range. she had stacks of loaves of black bread, too.
 she asked gluck if he wasn't awfully young to be in the army. he admitted that he
was.
 she asked edgar derby if he wasn't awfully old to be in the army. he said he was.
 she asked billy pilgrim what he was supposed to be. billy said he didn't know. he was
just trying to keep warm.
 'all the real soldiers are dead,' she said. it was true. so it goes.
 another true thing that billy saw while he was unconscious in vermont was the work
that he and the others had to do in dresden during the month before the city was
destroyed. they washed windows and swept floors and cleaned lavatories and put jars
into boxes and sealed cardboard boxes in a factory that made malt syrup. the syrup was

decorated with swastikas and stars. he was sheathed in a blue body stocking which had
yellow stripes running from his armpits to his ankles. his shoulder patch was a silhouette
of abraham lincoln's profile on a field of pale green. he had a broad armband which was
red, with a blue swastika in a circle of white.
 he was explaining this armband now in the cement-block hog barn.
 billy pilgrim had a boiling case of heartburn, since he had been spooning malt syrup
all day long at work. the heartburn brought tears to his eves, so that his image of
campbell was distorted by jiggling lenses of salt water.
 'blue is for the american sky,' campbell was saying. 'white is for the race that
pioneered the continent, drained the swamps and cleared the forests and built the roads
and bridges. red is for the blood of american patriots which was shed so gladly in years
gone by.'

 and then the newspaper girl held up her hand. 'mr. trout,' she said, 'if i win, can i take
my sister, too?'
 'hell no,' said kilgore trout. 'you think money grows on trees?'
 trout, incidentally, had written a book about a money tree. it had twenty-dollar bills
for leaves. its flowers were government bonds. its fruit was diamonds. it attracted human
beings who killed each other around the roots and made very good fertilizer.
 so it goes.
 billy pilgrim parked his cadillac in the alley, and waited for the meeting to end. when
the meeting broke up, there was still one boy trout had to deal with. the boy wanted to
quit because the work was so hard and the hours were so long and the pay was so small.
trout was concerned, because, if the boy really quit, trout would have to deliver the
boy's route himself, until he could find another sucker.
 'what are you?' trout asked the boy scornfully. 'some kind of gutless wonder?'
 this, too, was the title o

boy who wanted to quit. he told the boy about all the
millionaires who had carried newspapers as boys, and the boy replied: 'yeah-but i bet
they quit after a week, it's such a royal screwing.'
 and the boy left his full newspaper bag at trout's feet, with the customer book on top.
it was up to trout to deliver these papers. he didn't have a car. he didn't even have a
bicycle, and he was scared to death of dogs.
 somewhere a big dog barked.
 as trout lugubriously slung the bag from his shoulder, billy pilgrim approached him.
 'mr. trout-'
 'yes?'
 "are-are you kilgore trout?
 'yes.' trout supposed that billy had some complaint about the way his newspapers
were being delivered. he did not think of himself as a writer for the simple reason that
the world had never allowed him to think of himself in this way.
 'the-the writer?' said billy.
 'the what?'
 billy was certain that he had made a mistake. 'there's a writer named kilgore trout.'
 'there is?' trout looked foolish and dazed.

party was associated with optometry in some way, except trout. and he alone was
without glasses. he was making a great hit. everybody was glad to have a real author at
the party, even though they had never read his books.
 trout was talking to a maggie white, who had given up being a dental assistant to
become a homemaker for an optometrist. she was very pretty. the last book she had read
was ivanhoe.
 billy pilgrim stood nearby, listening. he was palpating something in his pocket. it was
a present he was about to give his wife, a white satin box containing a star sapphire
cocktail ring. the ring was worth eight hundred dollars.
 the adulation that trout was receiving, mindless and illiterate as it was, affected trout
like marijuana. he was happy and loud and impudent.
 'i'm afraid i don't read as much as i ought to,' said maggie.
 'we're all afraid of something,' trout replied. 'i'm afraid of cancer and r

valencia,
whose anniversary it was. according to plan, the barbershop quartet of optometrists, 'the
febs,' sang while people drank and billy and valencia put their arms around each other,
just glowed. everybody's eyes were shining. the song was 'that old gang of mine.'
 gee, that song went, but i'd give the world to see that old gang of mine. and so on. a
little later it said. so long forever, old fellows and gals, so long forever old sweethearts
and pals-god bless 'em-and so on.
 unexpectedly, billy pilgrim found himself upset by the song and the occasion. he had
never had an old gang, old sweethearts and pals, but he missed one anyway, as the quartet
made slow, agonized experiments with chords-chords intentionally sour, sourer still,
unbearably sour, and then a chord that was suffocatingly sweet, and then some sour ones
again. billy had powerful psychosomatic responses to the changing chords. his mouth
filled with the taste of lemonade, and his face became grotesque, as though he really were

 'you looked as though you'd seen a ghost,' said valencia.
 'no,' said billy. he hadn't seen anything but what was really before him-the faces of
the four singers, those four ordinary men, cow-eyed and mindless and anguished as they
went from sweetness to sourness to sweetness again.
 'can i make a guess?' said kilgore trout 'you saw through a time window.'
 'a what?' said valencia.
 'he suddenly saw the past or the future. am i right?'
 'no,' said billy pilgrim. he got up, put a hand into his pocket, found the box containing
the ring in there. he took out the box, gave it absently to valencia. he had meant to give
it to her at the end of the song, while everybody was watching. only kilgore trout was
there to see.
 'for me?' said valencia.
 'yes'
 'oh my god', she said. then she said it louder, so other people heard. they gathered
around, and she opened it, and she almost screamed when she saw the sapphire with a
star in it. 'oh my god,' she said. she

billy liked him, but didn't know him very well. billy couldn't help suspecting that there
wasn't much to know about robert.
 billy flicked on the light. robert was sitting on the toilet with his pajama bottoms
around his ankles. he was wearing an electric guitar, slung around his neck on a strap. he
had just bought the guitar that day. he couldn't play it yet and, in fact, never learned to
play it. it was a nacreous pink.
 'hello, son,' said billy pilgrim.
 billy went into his bedroom, even though there were guests to be entertained
downstairs. he lay down on his bed, turned on the magic fingers. the mattress trembled,
drove a dog out from under the bed. the dog was spot. good old spot was still alive in
those days. spot lay down again in a corner.
 billy thought hard about the effect the quartet had had on him, and then found an
association with an experience he had had long ago. he did not travel in time to the
experience. he remembered it shi

 the guards drew together instinctively, rolled their eyes. they experimented with one

strawberries and ice cream were millions of light years away.

 'dresden was destroyed on the night of february 13, 1945,' billy pilgrim began. 'we
came out of our shelter the next day.' he told montana about the four guards who, in their
astonishment and grief, resembled a barber-shop quartet. he told her about the stockyards
with all the fenceposts gone, with roofs and windows gone-told her about seeing little
logs lying around. these were people who had been caught in the firestorm. so it goes.
 billy told her what had happened to the buildings that used to form cliffs around the
stockyards. they had collapsed. their wood had

crashed down, had tumbled against one another until they locked at last in low and
graceful curves.

 the guards told the americans to form in ranks of four, which they did. then they had
them march back to the hog barn which had, been their home. its walls still stood, but its
windows and roof were gone, and there was nothing inside but ashes and dollops of
melted glass. it was realized then that there was no food or water, and that the survivors,
if they were going to continue to survive, were going to have to climb over curve after

gave them soup and ersatz coffee and a little beer. then he came out to the stable to listen

here is how billy pilgrim lost his wife, valencia.
 he was unconscious in the hospital in vermont, after the airplane crash on sugarbush
mountain, and valencia, having heard about the crash, was driving from ilium to the
hospital in the family cadillac el dorado coupe de ville. valencia was hysterical,
because she had been told frankly that billy might die, or that, if he lived, he might be a
vegetable.
 valencia adored billy. she was crying and yelping so hard as she drove that she
missed the correct turnoff from the t

with his fifth wife when he broke his leg. her name was lily. lily was twenty-three.
 just about the time poor valencia was pronounced dead, lily came into billy's and
rumfoord's room with an armload of books. rumfoord had sent her down to boston to
get them. he was working on a one-volume history of the united states army air corps
in the second world war. the books were about bombings and sky battles that had
happened before lily was even born.
 'you guys go on without me,' said billy pilgrim deliriously, as pretty little lily came
in. she had been an a-go-go girl when rumfoord saw her and resolved to make her his
own. she was a high school dropout. her i.q. was 103. 'he scares me,' she whispered to
her husband about billy pilgrim.
 'he bores the hell out of me!' rumfoord replied boomingly. 'all he does in his sleep is
quit and surrender and apologize and ask to be left alone.' rumfoord was a retired
brigadier general in the air force reserve, the official air force historian, a fun

t, if they could achieve their
aim, war would become tolerable and decent. they would do well to read this book and
ponder the fate of dresden, where 135,000 people died as the result of an air attack with
conventional weapons. on the night of march 9th, 1945, an air attack on tokyo by
american heavy bombers, using incendiary and high explosive bombs, caused the death
of 83,793 people. the atom bomb dropped on hiroshima killed 71,379 people.
 so it goes.
 'if you're ever in cody, wyoming,' said billy pilgrim behind his white linen screens,
'just ask for wild bob.'
 lily rumfoord shuddered, went on pretending to read the harry truman thing.
 billy's daughter barbara came in later that day. she was all doped up, had the same
glassy-eyed look that poor old edgar derby wore just before he was shot in dresden.
doctors had given her pills so she could continue to function, even though her father was
broken and her mother was dead.

male mongolian idiot in order to prescribe corrective lenses. the idiot's mother was
there, acting as an interpreter.
 'how many dots do you see?' billy pilgrim asked him.
 and then billy traveled in time to when he was sixteen years old, in the waiting room
of a doctor. billy had an infected thumb. there was only one other patient waiting-an old,
old man. the old man was in agony because of gas. he farted tremendously, and then he
belched.
 'excuse me,' he said to billy. then he did it again. 'oh god he said, 'i knew it was
going to be bad getting old.' he shook his head. 'i didn't know it was going to be this bad.'

hundreds of tombstones in a catholic cemetery one time. he was all straightened out
now. his posture was wonderful and his shoes were shined and his trousers were pressed,
and he was a leader of men.

 billy pilgrim closed his eyes again.
 billy had to miss his wife's funeral because he was still so sick. he was conscious,
though, while valencia was being put into the ground in ilium. billy hadn't said much
since regaining consciousness, hadn't responded very elaborately to the news of
valencia's death and robert's coming home from the war and so on-so it was generally
believed that he was a vegetable. there was talk of performing an operation on him later,

 'americans have finally heard about dresden,' said rumfoord, twenty-three years after
the raid. 'a lot of them know now how much worse it was than hiroshima. so i've got to
put something about it in my book. from the official air force standpoint, it'll all be
new.'
 'why would they keep it a secret so long?' said lily.
 'for fear that a lot of bleeding hearts' said rumfoord, 'might not think it was such a
wonderful thing to do.'
 it was now that billy pilgrim spoke up intelligently. 'i was there' he said.
 it was difficult for rumfoord to take billy seriously, since rumfoord, had so long
considered billy a repulsive non-person who would be much better off dead. now, with
billy speaking clearly and to the point, rumfoord's ears wanted to treat the words as a
foreign language that was not worth learning. 'what did he say?' said rumfoord.
 lily had to serve as an interpreter. 'he said he was there.' she explained.
 'he was where?

sible, that nobody should die.
 there in the hospital, billy was having an adventure very common among people
without power in time of war: he was trying to prove to a wilfully deaf and blind enemy
that he was interesting to hear and see. he kept silent until the lights went out at night,
and then, when there had been a long silence containing nothing to echo, he said to
rumfoord, 'i was in dresden when it was bombed. i was a prisoner of war.' rumfoord
sighed impatiently.
 'word of honor,' said billy pilgrim. 'do you believe me?'
 'must we talk about it now?' said rumfoord. he had heard. he didn't believe.
 'we don't ever have to talk about it,' said billy. 'i just want you to know: i was there.'
 nothing more was said about dresden that night, and billy closed his eyes, traveled in
time to a may afternoon, two days after the end of the second world war in europe.
billy and five other american prisoners were riding in a coffin-shaped green wagon,
which they had found abandoned complete with two hor

 and
other things he had found.
 billy stayed in the wagon when it reached the slaughterhouse, sunning himself. the
others went looking for souvenirs. later on in life, the tralfamadorians would advise
billy to concentrate on the happy moments of his life, and to ignore the unhappy ones-to
stare only at pretty things as eternity failed to go by. if this sort of selectivity had been
possible for billy, he might have chosen as his happiest moment his sun-drenched snooze
in the back of the wagon.
 billy pilgrim was armed as he snoozed. it was the first time he had been armed since
basic training. his companions had insisted that he arm himself, since god only knew
what sorts of killers might be in burrows on the face of the moon-wild dogs, packs of rats
fattened on corpses, escaped maniacs and murderers, soldiers who would never quit
killing until they themselves were killed.

man and wife were crooning to the horses. they
were noticing what the americans had not noticed-that the horses' mouths were bleeding,
gashed by the bits, that the horses' hooves were broken, so that every step meant agony,
that the horses were insane with thirst. the americans had treated their form of
transportation as though it were no more sensitive than a six-cylinder chevrolet.
 these two horse pitiers moved back along the wagon to where they could gaze in
patronizing reproach at billy-at billy pilgrim, who was so long and weak, so ridiculous in
his azure toga and silver shoes. they weren't afraid of him. they weren't afraid of
anything. they were doctors, both obstetricians. they had been delivering babies until
the hospitals were all burned down. now they were picnicking near where their
apartment used to be.

never reproduced themselves, though they could have. this was an interesting comment
on the whole idea of reproduction.
 they had nine languages between them. they tried polish on billy pilgrim first, since
he was dressed so clownishly, since the wretched poles were the involuntary clowns of
the second world war.
 billy asked them in english what it was they wanted, and they at once scolded him in
english for the condition of the horses. they made billy get out of the wagon and come
look at the horses. when billy saw the condition of his means of transportation, he burst
into tears. he hadn't cried about anything else in the war.
 later on, as a middle-aged optometrist, he would weep

 russians came on
motorcycles, and they arrested everybody but the horses.
 two days after that, billy was turned over to the americans, who shipped him home
on a very slow freighter called the lucretia a. mott. lucretia a. mott was a famous
american suffragette. she was dead. so it goes.
 'it had to be done,' rumfoord told billy, speaking of the destruction of dresden.
 'i know,' said billy.
 'that's war.'
 'i know. i'm not complaining.'
 'it must have been hell on the ground.'
 'it was,' said billy pilgrim.
 'pity the men who had to do it.'
 'i do.'
 'you must have had mixed feelings, there on the ground.'
 'it was all right.' said billy. 'everything is all right, and everybody has to do exactly
what he does. i learned that on tralfamadore.'
 billy pilgrim's daughter took him home later that day, put him to bed in his house,
turned the magic fingers on. there was a practical nurse there. billy wasn't supposed to
work or even leave the house for a while, at least. he was under observation.

 billy pilgrim checked into the royalton hotel on forty-fourth street in new york. he
by chance was given a room which had once been the home of george jean nathan, the
critic and editor. nathan, according to the earthling concept of time, had died back in
1958. according to the tralfamadorian concept, of course. nathan was still alive
somewhere and always would be.

doors which opened onto a terrace as large as the room. and b

more tralfamadorian than the movies, since you could look at them whenever you
wanted to, and they wouldn't change. twenty years in the future, those girls would still
be young, would still be smiling or smoldering or simply looking stupid, with their legs
wide open. some of them were eating lollipops or bananas. they would still be eating
those. and the peckers of the young men would still be semi-erect, and their muscles
would be bulging like cannonballs.
 but billy pilgrim wasn't beguiled by the back of the store. he was thrilled by the
kilgore trout novels in the front. the tides were all new to him, or he thought they were.
now he opened one. it seemed all right for him to do that. everybody else in the store
was pawing things. the name of the book was the big board. he got a few paragraphs
into it, and then realized that he had read it before-years ago, in the veterans' hospital. it
was about an earthling man and woman who were kidnapped by extra-terrestrials.

they were making money running a paper-and-celluloid whorehouse.

 the clerks occasionally told somebody to buy or get out, not to just look and look and
look and paw and paw. some of the people were looking at each other instead of the
merchandise.

billy was reading were window dressing. 'that ain't what you want, for christ's sake,' he
told billy 'what you want's in back.'

earthling figure who is most engaging to the tralfamadorian mind, he says, is charles
darwin-who taught that those who die are meant to die, that corpses are improvements.
so it goes.
 the same general idea appears in the big board by kilgore trout. the flying saucer
creatures who capture trout's hero ask him about darwin. they also ask him about golf.
