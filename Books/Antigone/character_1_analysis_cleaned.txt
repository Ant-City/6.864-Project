[CHARACTER]
antigone's uncle, the powerfully built king [CHARACTER] is a weary, wrinkled man suffering the burdens of rule. before the deaths of oedipus and his sons, he dedicated himself to art patronage but has now surrendered himself entirely to the throne. a practical man, he firmly distances himself from the tragic aspirations of oedipus and his line. as he tells antigone, his only interest is in political and social order. [CHARACTER] is bound to ideas of good sense, simplicity, and the banal happiness of everyday life. to [CHARACTER], life is but the happiness one makes, the happiness that inheres in a grasped tool, a garden bench, a child playing at one's feet. uninterested in playing the villain in his niece's tragedy, [CHARACTER] has no desire to sentence antigone to death. antigone is far more useful to thebes as mother to its heir than as its martyr, and he orders her crime covered-up. though fond of antigone, [CHARACTER] will have no choice but to but to execute her. as the recalcitrant antigone makes clear, by saying "yes" to state power, [CHARACTER] has committed himself to acts he finds loathsome if the order of the state demands it. antigone's insistence on her desire in face of state power brings ruin into thebes and to [CHARACTER] specifically. with the death of his family, [CHARACTER] is left utterly alone in the palace. his throne even robs him of his mourning, the king and his pace sadly shuttling off to a cabinet meeting after the announcement of the family's deaths.
