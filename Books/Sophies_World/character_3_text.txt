"shut up!" wrote sophie.
"as you wish, sophie. our acquaintance lasted only 13 minutes and 52 seconds. i
shall remember everything we have said. i shall now end the program."
the letter c: once again showed up on the screen.
"now we can sit down again," said alberto.
but sophie had already pressed some other keys.
"knag," she wrote.
immediately the following message appeared on the screen:
"here i am."
now it was alberto who jumped.
"who are you?" wrote sophie.
"major albert knag at your service. i came straight from lebanon. what is your
command?" 
"this beats everything!" breathed alberto. "the rat has sneaked onto the hard disc."
he motioned for sophie to move and sat down in front of the keyboard.
"how did you manage to get into my pc?" he wrote.
"a mere bagatelle, dear colleague. i am exactly where i choose to be."
"you loathsome data virus!"
"now, now! at the moment i am here as a birthday virus. may i send a special
greeting?"
"no thanks, we've had enough of them

before alberto could write again, the sign c: had once again appeared on the screen.
alberto wrote "dir knag*.*," which called up the following information on the screen:

alberto wrote "erase knag*.*" and switched off the computer.
"there--now i have erased him," he said. "but it's impossible to say where he'll turn
up next time."
he went on sitting there, staring at the screen. then he added:
"the worst of it all was the name. albert knag ..." 
for the first time sophie was struck by the similarity between the two names. albert
knag and alberto knox. but alberto was so incensed that she dared not say a word.
they went over and sat by the coffee table again.

they sat silently for a long time. then sophie spoke, trying to get alberto's mind off
what had happened.
"descartes must have been an odd kind of person. did he become famous?"
alberto breathed deeply for a couple of seconds before answer

"and that sun is hilde's father?"
"you could say so."
"are you saying he's been a kind of god for us?" 
"to be perfectly candid, yes. he should be ashamed of himself!"
"what about hilde herself?"
"she is an angel, sophie."
"an angel?"
"hilde is the one this 'spirit' turns to."
"are you saying that albert knag tells hilde about us?"
"or writes about us. for we cannot perceive the matter itself that our reality is made
of, that much we have learned. we cannot know whether our external reality is made
of sound waves or of paper and writing. according to berkeley, all we can know is
that we are spirit."
 "and hilde is an angel..."
"hilde is an angel, yes. let that be the last word. happy birthday, hilde!"
suddenly the room was filled with a bluish light. a few seconds later they heard the

it had once hung down in the "studio." the studio, over the boathouse, was her
father's combined library, writer's workshop, and retreat. albert, as hilde called him
when he was home, had always wanted to write something significant. once he had
tried to write a novel, but he never finished it. from time to time he had had a few
poems and sketches of the archipelago published in a national journal. hilde was so
proud every time she saw his name in print. albert knag. it meant something in
lillesan^, anyway. her great-grandfather's name had also been albert.

exception because it was an old magic mirror great-grandmother had bought from a

it was close to midnight before major albert knag called home to wish hilde a happy
birthday. hilde's mother answered the telephone.
"it's for you, hilde."
"hello?"
"it's dad."
"are you crazy? it's nearly midnight!"
"i just wanted to say happy birthday ..."
"you've been doing that all day."
"... but i didn't want to call before the day was over."
"why?"
"didn't you get my present?"
"yes, i did. thank you very much."

"but why shouldn't they feel so cocky?"
"because it is feasible that they, too, are nothing but mind."
"how could they be?"
"if it was possible for berkeley and the romantics, it must be possible for them.
maybe the major is also a shadow in a book about him and hilde, which is also about
us, since we are a part of their lives."
"that would be even worse. that makes us only shadows of shadows."
"but it is possible that a completely different author is somewhere writing a book
about a un major albert knag, who is writing a book for his daughter hilde. this
book is about a certain alberto knox who suddenly begins to send humble
philosophical lectures to sophie amundsen, 3 clover close."
"do you believe that?"
"i'm just saying it's possible. to us, that author would be a 'hidden god.' although
everything we are and everything we say and do proceeds from him, because we are
him we will never be able to know anything about him. we are in the innermost box."

"would you mind very much waiting till we get home, at least. it is my book, mom."

"does it really say that?"
"yes, it does, sophie. it's written by someone called albert knag. he must be a
newcomer. what's your al-berto's name, by the way?"
"knox."
"it'll probably turn out that this extraordinary person has written a whole book about
you, sophie. it's called using a pseudonym."
"it's not him, mom. why don't you just give up. you don't understand anything
anyway."
"no, i don't suppose i do. the garden party is tomorrow, then everything will be all

"half past eight."
"we'll have to take a few shortcuts. we can't stay behind this trailer, that's for sure."
they turned off into a large wheatfield. sophie looked back and saw that they had left
a broad trail of flattened stalks.
"tomorrow they'll say a freak wind blew over the field," said alberto.

major albert knag had just landed at kastrup airport outside copenhagen. it was half
past four on saturday, june 23. it had already been a long day. this penultimate lap
had been by plane from rome.
he went through passport control in his un uniform, which he was proud to wear. he
represented not only himself and his country. albert knag represented an international
legal system--a century-old tradition that now embraced the entire planet.
he carried only a flight bag. he had checked the rest of his baggage thro

rome. he just needed to hold up his red passport. 
"nothing to declare."
major albert knag had a nearly three-hour wait in the airport before his plane left for
kristiansand. he would have time to buy a few presents for his family. he had sent
the present of his life to hilde two weeks ago. marit, his wife, had put it on her
bedside table for her to discover when she woke up on her birthday. he had not
spoken with hilde since that late night birthday call.
albert bought a couple of norwegian newspapers, found himself a table in the bar,
and ordered a cup of coffee. he had hardly had

time to skim the headlines when he
heard an announcement over the loudspeakers: "this is a personal call for albert
knag. albert knag is requested to contact the sas information desk."
what now? he felt a chill down his spine. surely he was not being ordered back to
lebanon? could something be wrong at home?
he quickly reached the sas information desk.
"i'm albert knag."
"here is a message for you. it is urgent."
he opened the envelope at once. inside lay a smaller envelope. it was addressed to
major albert knag, c/o sas information, kastrup airport, copenhagen.
albert opened the little envelope nervously. it contained a short note:
dear dad, welcome home from lebanon. as you can imagine, i can't even wait till
you get home. forgive me for having you paged over the loud-speakers. it was the
easiest way.
p.s. unfortunately a claim for damages has arrived from

p.s. p.s. i may be sitting in the garden when you get here. but you might also be
hearing from me before that. 
p.s. p.s. p.s. i'm rather scared of staying in the garden too long at a time. it's so easy
to sink into the ground in such places. love from hilde, who has had plenty of time to
prepare your homecoming.
major albert knag's first impulse was to smile. but he did not appreciate being
manipulated in this manner. he had always liked to be in charge of his own life. now
this little vixen in lillesand was directing his movements in kastrup airport! how
had she managed that?
he put the envelope in his breast pocket and began to stroll toward the little shopping
mall. he was just about to enter the danish food deli when he noticed a small
envelope taped to the store window. it had major knag written on it with a thick

marker pen. albert took it down and opened it:
personal message for major albert knag, c/o danish food, kastrup airport. dear
dad, please buy a large danish salami, preferably a two-pound one, and mom would
probably like a cognac sausage. p. s. danish caviar is not bad either. love, hilde.
albert turned around. she wasn't here, was she? had mark given her a trip to
copenhagen so she could meet him here? it was hilde's handwriting ...
suddenly the un observer began to feel himself observed. it was as if someone was
in remote control of everything he did. he felt like a doll in th

 must confess, though, that i share sophie's
liking for such bagatelles. p.s. in case you haven't been there yet, there are further
instructions at the danish food store and the big tax free store that sells wines and 
tobacco. p.s. p.s. i got some money for my birthday, so i can contribute to the
mini-tv with 350 crowns. love, hilde, who has already stuffed the turkey and made
the waldorf salad.
a mini-tv cost 985 danish crowns. that could certainly be called a bagatelle in
comparison with how albert knag felt about being directed hither and thither by his
daughter's sneaky tricks. was she here--or was she not?
from that moment on, he was constantly on guard wherever he went. he felt like a
secret agent and a marionette rolled into one. was he not being deprived of his basic
human rights?
he felt obliged to go into the tax free store as well. there hung a new envelope with
his name on it. the whole airport was becoming a computer game with him as the
cursor. he read the message:

rzipan bar. now there were only two left for hilde. when he
had reclaimed his baggage, a young man stepped forward and explained that he was
under the command of the queen of the mirror, and that he had orders to drive him to
bjerkely. the other demonstrators dispersed into the crowd.
they drove out onto the e 18. every bridge and tunnel they passed was draped with
banners saying: "welcome home!", "the turkey is ready," "i can see you, dad!"
when he was dropped off outside the gate at bjerkely, albert knag heaved a sigh of
relief, and thanked the driver with a hundred crown note and three cans of carlsberg
elephant beer.
his wife was waiting for him outside the house. after a long embrace, he asked:
"where is she?"
"she's sitting on the dock, albert."
alberto and sophie stopped the red convertible on the square in lillesand outside the
hotel norge. it was a quarter past ten. they could see a large bonfire out in the
archipelago. 
 "how do we find bjerkely?" asked sophie.
"we'll just have to hunt
