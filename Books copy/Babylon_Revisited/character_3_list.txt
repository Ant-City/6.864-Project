Lincoln Peters - 
                Marion's husband and Charlie's brother-in-law. Lincoln lacks Charlie's knack for business, but he is a solid, responsible father and husband. He is quieter than his wife and more sympathetic to Charlie's desire to live with Honoria. Still, his primary loyalty is to Marion, whom he truly loves. He takes Marion's side whenever he believes that Charlie's actions are hurting her.
