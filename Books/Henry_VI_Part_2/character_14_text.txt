  car. so, there goes our protector in a rage:
'tis knowne to you he is mine enemy:
nay more, an enemy vnto you all,
and no great friend, i feare me to the king;
consider lords, he is the next of blood,
and heyre apparant to the english crowne:
had henrie got an empire by his marriage,
and all the wealthy kingdomes of the west,
there's reason he should be displeas'd at it:
looke to it lords, let not his smoothing words
bewitch your hearts, be wise and circumspect.
what though the common people fauour him,
calling him, humfrey the good duke of gloster,
clapping their hands, and crying with loud voyce,
iesu maintaine your royall excellence,
with god preserue the good duke humfrey:
i feare me lords, for all this flattering glosse,
he will be found a dangerous protector

   buc. why should he then protect our soueraigne?
he being of age to gouerne of himselfe.

dame elianor giues gold, to bring the witch:
gold cannot come amisse, were she a deuill.

i dare not say, from the rich cardinall,

yet i doe finde it so: for to be plaine,
they (knowing dame elianors aspiring humor)
haue hyred me to vnder-mine the duchesse,
and buzze these coniurations in her brayne.
