[CHARACTER] - 
                [CHARACTER] may be the most influential character
in edna's awakening. she is unmarried and childless, and she devotes
her life to her passion: music. a talented pianist and somewhat
of a recluse, she represents independence and freedom and serves
as a sort of muse for edna. when edna begins actively to pursue
personal independence, she seeks [CHARACTER]'s companionship.
mademoiselle warns edna that she must be brave if she wishes to
be an artist--that an artist must have a courageous and defiant soul.
[CHARACTER] is the only character in the novel who knows
of the love between robert and edna, and she, thus, serves as a
true confidante for edna despite their considerably different personalities. mademoiselle
reisz is also a foil for edna's other close female friend, adele
ratignolle, who epitomizes the conventional and socially acceptable
woman of the late nineteenth century.
