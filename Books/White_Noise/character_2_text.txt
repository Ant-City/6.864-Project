one of deadly serious anticipation, a reward hard-won. the table was crowded and babette and denise
elbowed each other twice, although neither spoke. wilder was still seated on the counter surrounded by
open cartons, crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances covered with plastic
wrap, flip-top rings and twist ties, individually wrapped slices of orange cheese. heinrich came in, studied
the scene carefully, my only son, then walked out the back door and disappeared.

babette  had  made  it  a  rule.  she  seemed  to  think  that  if  kids  watched  television  one  night  a  week  with
parents or stepparents, the effect would be to de-glamorize the medium in their eyes, make it wholesome
domestic  sport.  its  narcotic  undertow  and  eerie  diseased  brain-sucking  power  would  be  gradually
reduced. i felt vaguely slighted by this reasoning. the evening in fact was a subtle form of punishment for
us  all.  heinrich  sat  silent  over  his  egg  rolls.  steffie  became  upset  every  time  something  shameful  or
humiliating  seemed  about  to  happen  to  someone  on  the  screen.  she  had  a  vast  capacity  for  being
embarrassed on other people's behalf. often she would leave the room until denise signaled to her that
the scene was over. denise used these occasions to counsel the younger girl on toughness, the need to

space between things as we felt them at the time and as we speak them now. this is the space reserved
for irony, sympathy and fond amusement, the means by which we rescue ourselves from the past.

i  decided  on  the  twentieth  century.  i  put  on  my  bathrobe  and  went  down  the  hall  to  heinrich's
room  to  find  a  trashy  magazine  babette  might  read  from,  the  type  that  features  letters  from  readers
detailing  their sexual experiences.  this struck  me as  one of  the  few  things  the  modern imagination has
contributed to the history of erotic practices. there is a double fantasy at work in such letters. people write
down  imagined  episodes  and  then  see  them  published  in  a  national  magazine.  which  is  the  greater

we moved together into the ultra-cool interior. wilder sat in the shopping cart trying to grab items
off  the  shelves  as  we  went  by.  it  occurred  to  me  that  he  was  too  old  and  too  big  to  be  sitting  in
supermarket carts. i also wondered why his vocabulary seemed to be stalled at twenty-five words.

the  small  child  moved  in  a  swaying  gait,  great  head  wagging,  and  his  mother  made  faces  of

"what do i forget?" babette said.

"it's all right," denise said. "never mind."

"what do i forget?"

"go ahead and chew. never mind the warning. i don't care."


i scooped wilder off a chair and gave him a noisy kiss on the ear and he shrank away in delight.
then  i  put  him  on  the  counter  and  went  upstairs  to  find  heinrich.  he  was  in  his  room  studying  the
deployment of plastic chessmen.
"still playing with the fellow in prison? how's it going?"

"pretty good. i think i got him cornered."

"what do you know about this fellow? i've been meaning to ask."

"like who did he kill? that's the big thing today. concern for the victim."

babette called me at my office in centenary hall. she said heinrich had been down at the river,
wearing his camouflage cap and carrying an instamatic, to watch them drag for the bodies, and while he
was there word came that the treadwells had been found alive but shaken in an abandoned cookie shack
at  the  mid-village  mall,  a  vast  shopping  center  out  on  the  interstate.  apparently  they'd  been  wandering
through  the  mall  for  two  days,  lost,  confused  and  frightened,  before  taking  refuge  in  the  littered  kiosk.

we  crowded  before  the  window  in  steffie's  small  room,  watching  the  spectacular  sunset.  only  heinrich
stayed away, either because he distrusted wholesome communal pleasures or because he believed there
was something ominous in the modern sunset.

later i sat up in bed in my bathrobe studying german. i muttered words to myself and wondered
whether i'd be able to restrict my german-speaking at the spring conference to brief opening remarks or
whether the other participants would expect the language to be used throughout, in lectures, at meals, in
small talk, as a mark of our seriousness, our uniq

investigation  into  what  he  called  the  society  of  kids.  he  talked  about  the  otherworldly  babble  of  the
american family. he seemed to think we were a visionary group, open to special forms of consciousness.
there were huge amounts of data flowing through the house, waiting to be analyzed.
he went upstairs with the three kids to watch tv. heinrich walked into the kitchen, sat at the table

heinrich stood in a corner of the room, taking up his critical-observer position. i gave murray his
coffee and was about to leave when i glanced in passing at the tv screen. i paused at the door, looked
more closely this time. it was true, it was there. i hissed at the others for silence and they swiveled their
heads in my direction, baffled and annoyed. then they followed my gaze to the sturdy tv at the end of the
bed.

fragments that were mainly fabricated. as the camera pulled back to allow babette to demonstrate some
fine point of standing or walking, wilder approached the set and touched her body, leaving a handprint on
the dusty surface of the screen.

then denise crawled up to the set and turned the volume dial. nothing happened. there was no
sound, no voice, nothing. she turned to look at me, a moment of renewed confusion. heinrich advanced,
fiddled with the dial, stuck his hand behind the set to adjust the recessed knobs. when he tried another
channel, the sound boomed out, raw and fuzzy. back at the cable station, he couldn't raise a buzz and as
we watched babette finish the lesson, we were in a mood of odd misgiving. but as soon as the program
ended, the two girls got excited again and went downstairs to wait for babette at the door and surprise her
with news of what they'd seen.

heinrich crouched on a small ledge outside our attic window. he wore his camouflage jacket and cap, an
outfit with complex meaning for him, at fourteen, struggling to grow and to escape notice simultaneously,
his secrets known to us all. he looked east through binoculars.

i went around back to the kitchen. in the entranceway the washer and dryer were vibrating nicely.

him stand out there, utterly still, his head turned slightly, a honed awareness in his stance. it took me a
while to realize he was listening to the sirens beyond the river.

an  hour  later  he  was  back  in  the  attic,  this  time  with  a  radio  and  highway  map.  i  climbed  the
narrow stairs, borrowed the glasses and looked again. it was still there, a slightly larger accumulation, a

babette's head appeared at the top of the stairway. she said a neighbor had told her the spill from

and behind me.

we  watched  wilder  climb  backwards  down  the  attic  steps,  which  were  higher  than  the  steps
elsewhere  in  the  house.  at  dinner  denise  kept  getting  up  and  walking  in  small  stiff  rapid  strides  to  the
toilet off the hall, a hand clapped to her mouth. we paused in odd moments of chewing or salt-sprinkling
to hear her retch incompletely. heinrich told her she was showing outdated symptoms. she gave him a
slit-eyed  look.  it  was  a  period  of  looks  and  glances,  teeming  interactions,  part  of  the  sensory  array  i
ordinarily  cherish.  heat,  noise,  lights,  looks,  words,  gestures,  personalities,  appliances.  a  colloquial

that only in this way could we avoid being noticed. it was as though the sirens heralded the presence of
some  controlling  mechanism--a  thing  we  would  do  well  not  to  provoke  with  our  contentiousness  and
spilled food.

it wasn't until a second noise became audible in the pulse of the powerful sirens that we thought
to effect a pause in our little episode of decorous hysteria. heinrich ran to the front door and opened it.
the  night's  combined  sounds  came  washing  in  with  a  freshness  and  renewed  immediacy.  for  the  first
time in minutes we looked at each other, knowing the new sound was an amplified voice but not sure what
it  was  saying.  heinrich  returned,  walking  in  an  over-deliberate  and  stylized  manner,  with  elements  of
stealth. this seemed to mean he was frozen with significance.

steffie read a coupon for baby lux, crying softly. this brought denise to life. she went upstairs to

bloody. there was blood on a smashed window. blood soaked upward through newly fallen snow. drops
of  blood  speckled  a  tan  handbag.  the  scene  of  injured  people,  medics,  smoking  steel,  all  washed  in  a
strong  and  eerie  light,  took  on  the  eloquence  of  a  formal  composition.  we  passed  silently  by,  feeling
curiously reverent, even uplifted by the sight of the heaped cars and fallen people.

heinrich kept watching through the rear window, taking up his binoculars as the scene dwindled in
the  distance.  he  described  for  us  in  detail  the  number  and  placement  of  bodies,  the  skid  marks,  the
vehicular damage. when the wreck was no longer visible, he talked about everything that had happened

"it could be true," he said, clearly lying. "they use rats to test for things that humans can catch, so
it means we get the same diseases, rats and humans. besides, they wouldn't use dogs if they thought it
could hurt them."
"why not?"

"a dog is a mammal."

"so's a rat," denise said.

"a rat is a vermin," babette said.

promises a still and deep-lying sleep. but people sat in their dark cars staring out at each other through

most of the lights were out now. the barracks roar had subsided. people were settling in. heinrich
was still awake, sitting on the floor, fully dressed, his back to the wall, reading a red cross resuscitation
manual. he was not,  in any case, a child whose lustrous slumber brought me peace.  a restless, teeth-
