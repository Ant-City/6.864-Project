[CHARACTER]
an earnest spiritual pilgrim, [CHARACTER] is totally consumed
by his quest for spiritual enlightenment. though in his youth he
learns the wisdom of his brahmin heritage and masters the skills
of the samanas and the teachings of gotama, the spiritual explanations that
satisfy those around him are inadequate for [CHARACTER] because they
do not lead to enlightenment. no matter how many others accept a
particular religious explanation, [CHARACTER] will refuse the explanation
if it rings false. [CHARACTER] seeks spiritual enlightenment at any
cost, even when the search complicates other areas of life. friends,
lovers, and family members fall by the wayside when [CHARACTER] believes
they are not compatible with his quest. further, he believes no
leader or philosophy is beyond questioning. guided by a strong belief
in his convictions, he argues with the head of the samanas and even
with the enlightened gotama the buddha himself. [CHARACTER] does
not argue for argument's sake, nor does he question wisdom out of
a sense of pride or superiority. he finds logical flaws in the teachings
put before him, and he seeks the truth.

	[CHARACTER] possesses an incredible degree of patience,
which proves to be important since his quest takes a lifetime to
fulfill. he progresses through successive spiritual explorations,
experiences failure numerous times, but persists until he reaches
his goal. the instantaneous, magical transmission of nirvana from
[CHARACTER] to govinda demonstrates that [CHARACTER] has found the
transcendent understanding they have both sought for so long. he
has finally reached his goal. 
[CHARACTER] is the sanskrit name of the buddha and means
"he who is on the proper road" or "he who achieves his goal." hesse
is not attempting to directly portray the life of the buddha himself through
[CHARACTER] but to use [CHARACTER] as a means of discussing a path
to enlightenment. at the same time, many striking similarities exist
between [CHARACTER] and the actual buddha. for example, both left
promising lives in their pursuit of knowledge. in [CHARACTER]'s case,
he leaves kamala when he becomes disillusioned with the material
world, while the buddha left a wife and son to become an ascetic.
both studied with ascetics, and both spent many years in study by
a river, finally achieving enlightenment. [CHARACTER] has succeeded
in his own arduous quest, and at the end of the novel, he is poised
to take on followers of his own.
