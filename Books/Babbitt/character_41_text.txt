 of bridge.

babbitt recovered from the feeling of being boiled. he won at bridge.
he was again able to endure vergil gunch's inexorable heartiness. but
he pictured loafing with paul riesling beside a lake in maine. it was as
overpowering and imaginative as homesickness. he had never seen maine,
yet he beheld the shrouded mountains, the tranquil lake of evening.
"that boy paul's worth all these ballyhooing highbrows put together," he
muttered; and, "i'd like to get away from--everything."

even louetta swanson did not rouse him.

mrs. swanson was pretty and pliant. babbitt was not an analyst of women,
except as to their tastes in furnished houses to rent. he divided them
into real ladies, working women, old cranks, and fly chickens. he mooned
over their charms but he was of opinion that all of them (save the women
of his own family) were "different" and "mysterious." yet he had known
by instinct that louetta swanson could be approached. her eyes and lips
were moist. her face tapered from a broad fore

mumbled.

mrs orville jones begged, "oh, let's talk to dante! we studied him at
the reading circle. you know who he was, orvy."

"certainly i know who he was! the wop poet. where do you think i was
raised?" from her insulted husband.

"sure--the fellow that took the cook's tour to hell. i've never waded
through his po'try, but we learned about him in the u.," said babbitt.

"page mr. dannnnnty!" intoned eddie swanson.

"you ought to get him easy, mr. frink, you and he being fellow-poets,"
said louetta swanson.

"fellow-poets, rats! where d' you get that stuff?" protested vergil
gunch. "i suppose dante showed a lot of speed for an old-timer--not that
i've actually read him, of course--but to come right down to hard facts,
he wouldn't stand one-two-three if he had to buckle down to practical
literature and turn out a poem for the newspaper-syndicate every day,
like chum does!"

"that's so," from eddie swanson. "those old birds could take their time.
judas priest, i could write poetry myself if i had a

or the gin!"

every one giggled at this naughtiness. in a pleased way eddie swanson
stated that he would have a physician analyze his coffee daily. the
others were diverted to a discussion of the more agreeable recent
murders, but babbitt drew louetta back to personal things:

"that's the prettiest dress i ever saw in my life."

"do you honestly like it?"

"like it? why, say, i'm going to have kenneth escott put a piece in the
paper saying that the swellest dressed woman in the u. s. is mrs. e.
louetta swanson."

"now, you stop teasing me!" but she beamed. "let's dance a little.
george, you've got to dance with me."

even as he protested, "oh, you know what a rotten dancer i am!" he was
lumbering to his feet.

"i'll teach you. i can teach anybody."

her eyes were moist, her voice was jagged with excitement. he was
convinced that he had won her. he clasped her, conscious of her smooth
warmth, and solemnly he circled in a heavy version of the one-step. he
bumped into only one or two people. "gosh, i'm

partments, babbitt had a flat which he had been
holding for sidney finkelstein, but at the thought of driving beside
this agreeable woman he threw over his friend finkelstein, and with a
note of gallantry he proclaimed, "i'll let you see what i can do!"

he dusted the seat of the car for her, and twice he risked death in
showing off his driving.

"you do know how to handle a car!" she said.

he liked her voice. there was, he thought, music in it and a hint of
culture, not a bouncing giggle like louetta swanson's.

he boasted, "you know, there's a lot of these fellows that are so scared
and drive so slow that they get in everybody's way. the safest driver
is a fellow that knows how to handle his machine and yet isn't scared to
speed up when it's necessary, don't you think so?"

"oh, yes!"

"i bet you drive like a wiz."

"oh, no--i mean--not really. of course, we had a car--i mean, before
my husband passed on--and i used to make believe drive it, but i don't
think any woman ever learns to drive like a

teasing at the roughnecks' table. he was wondering what zilla riesling
was doing now. he was wondering whether, after the summer's maturity
of being a garageman, ted would "get busy" in the university. he was
thinking of his wife. "if she would only--if she wouldn't be so darn
satisfied with just settling down--no! i won't! i won't go back! i'll
be fifty in three years. sixty in thirteen years. i'm going to have some
fun before it's too late. i don't care! i will!"

he thought of ida putiak, of louetta swanson, of that nice widow--what
was her name?--tanis judique?--the one for whom he'd found the flat. he
was enmeshed in imaginary conversations. then:

"gee, i can't seem to get away from thinking about folks!"

thus it came to him merely to run away was folly, because he could never
run away from himself.

that moment he started for zenith. in his journey there was no
appearance of flight, but he was fleeing, and four days afterward he was
on the zenith train. he knew that he was slinking back not b

"yuh, lil exercise."

"cold enough for you to-night?"

"well, just about."

"still a widower?"

"uh-huh."

"say, babbitt, while she's away--i know you don't care much for
booze-fights, but the missus and i'd be awfully glad if you could come
in some night. think you could stand a good cocktail for once?"

"stand it? young fella, i bet old uncle george can mix the best cocktail
in these united states!"

"hurray! that's the way to talk! look here: there's some folks coming
to the house to-night, louetta swanson and some other live ones, and i'm
going to open up a bottle of pre-war gin, and maybe we'll dance a while.
why don't you drop in and jazz it up a little, just for a change?"

"well--what time they coming?"

he was at sam doppelbrau's at nine. it was the third time he had entered
the house. by ten he was calling mr. doppelbrau "sam, old hoss."

at eleven they all drove out to the old farm inn. babbitt sat in the
back of doppelbrau's car with louetta swanson. once he had timorously
tried to make

d captivated her poor george.

if once he had doubted his neighbors and the supreme charm of the good
fellows, he was convinced now. you didn't, he noted, "see seneca doane
coming around with any flowers or dropping in to chat with the missus,"
but mrs. howard littlefield brought to the hospital her priceless wine
jelly (flavored with real wine); orville jones spent hours in picking
out the kind of novels mrs. babbitt liked--nice love stories about new
york millionaries and wyoming cowpunchers; louetta swanson knitted a
pink bed-jacket; sidney finkelstein and his merry brown-eyed flapper of
a wife selected the prettiest nightgown in all the stock of parcher and
stein.

all his friends ceased whispering about him, suspecting him. at the
athletic club they asked after her daily. club members whose names he
did not know stopped him to inquire, "how's your good lady getting on?"
babbitt felt that he was swinging from bleak uplands down into the rich
warm air of a valley pleasant with cottages.
