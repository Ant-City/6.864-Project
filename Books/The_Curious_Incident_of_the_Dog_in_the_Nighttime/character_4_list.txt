Mr. Shears (Roger Shears) - 
            Estranged husband of Eileen Shears. Roger Shears once worked at a bank in
                town, but moved to London rather suddenly a couple of years ago, leaving Mrs. Shears
                behind. His mysterious nature leads Christopher to investigate him as a possible
                suspect in Wellington's murder.
