with wrinkles, but his deep-set eyes sparkled with extraordinary
youthfulness, an ardent life, a profound passion. he kept them fixed
incessantly on the gypsy, and, while the giddy young girl of sixteen
danced and whirled, for the pleasure of all, his revery seemed to become
more and more sombre. from time to time, a smile and a sigh met upon his
lips, but the smile was more melancholy than the sigh.

the young girl, stopped at length, breathless, and the people applauded
her lovingly.

“djali!” said the gypsy.

then gringoire saw come up to her, a pretty little white goat, alert,
wide-awake, glossy, with gilded horns, gilded hoofs, and gilded collar,
which he had not hitherto perceived, and which had remained lying curled
up on one corner of the carpet watching his mistress dance.

“djali!” said the dancer, “it is your turn.”

and, seating herself, she gracefully presented her tambourine to the
goat.

“djali,” she continued, “what month is this?”

the goat lifted i

it was the first month in the year, in fact.

“djali,” pursued the young girl, turning her tambourine round, “what day
of the month is this?”

djali raised his little gilt hoof, and struck six blows on the
tambourine.

“djali,” pursued the egyptian, with still another movement of the
tambourine, “what hour of the day is it?”

djali struck seven blows. at that moment, the clock of the pillar house
rang out seven.

the people were amazed.

“there’s sorcery at the bottom of it,” said a sinister voice in the
crowd. it was that of the bald man, who never removed his eyes from the
gypsy.

she shuddered and turned round; but applause broke forth and drowned the
morose exclamation.

it even effaced it so completely from her mind, that she continued to
question her goat.

“djali, what does master guichard grand-remy, capta

of the town do, at the procession of candlemas?”

djali reared himself on his hind legs, and began to bleat, marching
along with so much dainty gravity, that the entire circle of spectators
burst into a laugh at this parody of the interested devoutness of the
captain of pistoliers.

“djali,” resumed the young girl, emboldened by her growing success,
“how preaches master jacques charmolue, procurator to the king in the
ecclesiastical court?”

the goat seated himself on his hind quarters, and began to bleat, waving
his fore feet in so strange a manner, that, with the exception of
the bad french, and worse latin, jacques charmolue was there
complete,--gesture, accent, and attitude.

and the crowd applauded louder than ever.

“sacrilege! profanation!” resumed the voice of t

“really?”

“actually.”

“a bourgeois horse! ‘tis rather too much! if it had been a cavalry
horse, well and good!”

and the windows were closed. but gringoire had lost the thread of his
ideas, nevertheless.

fortunately, he speedily found it again, and he knotted it together
without difficulty, thanks to the gypsy, thanks to djali, who still
walked in front of him; two fine, delicate, and charming creatures,
whose tiny feet, beautiful forms, and graceful manners he was engaged in
admiring, almost confusing them in his contemplation; believing them
to be both young girls, from their intelligence and good friendship;
regarding them both as goats,--so far as the lightness, agility, and
dexterity of their walk were concerned.

but the streets were becoming blacker and more deserted every moment.

it was the gypsy.

“la esmeralda!” said gringoire, stupefied in the midst of his emotions,
by the abrupt manner in which that magic word knotted together all his
reminiscences of the day.

this rare creature seemed, even in the cour des miracles, to exercise
her sway of charm and beauty. the vagabonds, male and female, ranged
themselves gently along her path, and their brutal faces beamed beneath
her glance.

she approached the victim with her light step. her pretty djali followed
her. gringoire was more dead than alive. she examined him for a moment
in silence.

“you are going to hang this man?” she said gravely, to clopin.

“yes, sister,” replied the king of thunes, “unless you will take him for
your husband.”

she made her pretty little pout with her under lip. “i’ll take him,”
 said she.

gringoire firmly believed that he had been in a dream ever since
morning, and that this was the continuation of it.

the change was, in fact, violent, tho

he raised his voice, “mademoiselle!”

she seemed not to hear him.

he repeated, still more loudly, “mademoiselle esmeralda!”

trouble wasted. the young girl’s mind was elsewhere, and gringoire’s
voice had not the power to recall it. fortunately, the goat interfered.
she began to pull her mistress gently by the sleeve.

“what dost thou want, djali?” said the gypsy, hastily, as though
suddenly awakened.

“she is hungry,” said gringoire, charmed to enter into conversation.
esmeralda began to crumble some bread, which djali ate gracefully from
the hollow of her hand.

moreover, gringoire did not give her time to resume her revery. he
hazarded a delicate question.

“so you don’t want me for your husband?”

the young girl looked at him intently, and said, “no.”

“for your lover?” went on gringoire.

she pouted, and replied

re following me also, why were you following me?”

“in good faith,” responded gringoire, “i don’t know either.”

silence ensued. gringoire slashed the table with his knife. the young
girl smiled and seemed to be gazing through the wall at something. all
at once she began to sing in a barely articulate voice,--


   _quando las pintadas aves,
   mudas estan, y la tierra_--*


     *  when the gay-plumaged birds grow weary, and the earth--


she broke off abruptly, and began to caress djali.

“that’s a pretty animal of yours,” said gringoire.

“she is my sister,” she answered.

“why are you called ‘la esmeralda?’” asked the poet.

“i do not know.”

“but why?”

she drew from her bosom a sort of little oblong bag, suspended from her
neck by a string of adrézarach beads. this bag exhaled a strong odor of
camphor. it was covered with green silk, and bore in its centre a large
piece of green glass, in imitation of an emerald.

“perhaps it is because of this

goat. they say she is a sorceress, and that her goat executes
very miraculous tricks.”

“well!” said colombe, “the goat must now amuse us in its turn, and
perform a miracle for us.”

diane and colombe eagerly addressed the gypsy.

“little one, make your goat perform a miracle.”

“i do not know what you mean,” replied the dancer.

“a miracle, a piece of magic, a bit of sorcery, in short.”

“i do not understand.” and she fell to caressing the pretty animal,
repeating, “djali! djali!”

at that moment fleur-de-lys noticed a little bag of embroidered leather
suspended from the neck of the goat,--“what is that?” she asked of the
gypsy.

the gypsy raised her large eyes upon her and replied gravely,--“that is
my secret.”

“i should really like to know what your secret is,” thought
fleur-de-lys.

meanwhile, the good dame had risen angrily,--“come now, gypsy, if
neither you nor your goat can dance for us, what are you doing here?”

the gypsy walked slowly

marvellous memory!” said fleur-de-lys, to the petrified
gypsy. then, bursting into sobs: “oh!” she stammered mournfully, hiding
her face in both her beautiful hands, “she is a magician!” and she
heard another and a still more bitter voice at the bottom of her heart,
saying,--“she is a rival!”

she fell fainting.

“my daughter! my daughter!” cried the terrified mother. “begone, you
gypsy of hell!”

in a twinkling, la esmeralda gathered up the unlucky letters, made a
sign to djali, and went out through one door, while fleur-de-lys was
being carried out through the other.

captain phoebus, on being left alone, hesitated for a moment between the
two doors, then he followed the gypsy.




chapter ii. a priest and a philosopher are two different things.



the priest whom the young girls had observed at the top of the north
tower, leaning over the place and so attentive to the dance of the
gypsy, was, in fact, archdeacon claude frollo.

“are you sure,” persisted claude, with his penetrating glance, “that it
is only a word and not a name?”

“the name of whom?” said the poet.

“how should i know?” said the priest.

“this is what i imagine, messire. these bohemians are something like
guebrs, and adore the sun. hence, phoebus.”

“that does not seem so clear to me as to you, master pierre.”

“after all, that does not concern me. let her mumble her phoebus at her
pleasure. one thing is certain, that djali loves me almost as much as he
does her.”

“who is djali?”

“the goat.”

the archdeacon dropped his chin into his hand, and appeared to reflect
for a moment. all at once he turned abruptly to gringoire once more.

“and do you swear to me that you have not touched her?”

“whom?” said gringoire; “the goat?”

“no, that woman.”

“my wife? i swear to you that i have not.”

“you are often alone with her?”

“a good hour every evening.”

porn claude frowned.

f gringoire, gave passage to a pretty goat with horns and
hoofs of gold. the elegant beast halted for a moment on the threshold,
stretching out its neck as though, perched on the summit of a rock, it
had before its eyes an immense horizon. suddenly it caught sight of the
gypsy girl, and leaping over the table and the head of a clerk, in two
bounds it was at her knees; then it rolled gracefully on its mistress’s
feet, soliciting a word or a caress; but the accused remained
motionless, and poor djali himself obtained not a glance.

“eh, why--‘tis my villanous beast,” said old falourdel, “i recognize the
two perfectly!”

jacques charmolue interfered.

“if the gentlemen please, we will proceed to the examination of the
goat.” he was, in fact, the second criminal. nothing more simple in
those days than a suit of sorcery instituted against an animal. we find,
among others in the accounts of the provost’s office for 1466, a curious
detail concerning the expenses of the trial of g

hat he does
not know what he is doing.”

“silence among the louts at the end of the hail!” said the bailiff
sharply.

jacques charmolue, by the aid of the same manoeuvres of the tambourine,
made the goat perform many other tricks connected with the date of
the day, the month of the year, etc., which the reader has already
witnessed. and, by virtue of an optical illusion peculiar to judicial
proceedings, these same spectators who had, probably, more than once
applauded in the public square djali’s innocent magic were terrified by
it beneath the roof of the palais de justice. the goat was undoubtedly
the devil.

it was far worse when the procurator of the king, having emptied upon a
floor a certain bag filled with movable letters, which djali wore round
his neck, they beheld the goat extract with his hoof from the scattered
alphabet the fatal name of phoebus. the witchcraft of which the captain
had been the victim appeared irresistibly demonstrated, and in the eyes
of all, the gypsy,

that ravishing dancer, who had so often dazzled
the passers-by with her grace, was no longer anything but a frightful
vampire.

however, she betrayed no sign of life; neither djali’s graceful
evolutions, nor the menaces of the court, nor the suppressed
imprecations of the spectators any longer reached her mind.

in order to arouse her, a police officer was obliged to shake her
unmercifully, and the president had to raise his voice,--“girl, you
are of the bohemian race, addicted to deeds of witchcraft. you, in
complicity with the bewitched goat implicated in this suit, during
the night of the twenty-ninth of march last, murdered and stabbed, in
concert with the powers

ps of thousands of chimneys which caused the smoke of all the
fires in paris to rise beneath her eyes. a sad sight for the poor gypsy,
a foundling, condemned to death, an unhappy creature, without country,
without family, without a hearthstone.

at the moment when the thought of her isolation thus appeared to her
more poignant than ever, she felt a bearded and hairy head glide between
her hands, upon her knees. she started (everything alarmed her now) and
looked. it was the poor goat, the agile djali, which had made its escape
after her, at the moment when quasimodo had put to flight charmolue’s
brigade, and which had been lavishing caresses on her feet for nearly
an hour past, without being able to win a glance. the gypsy covered him
with kisses.

“oh! djali!” she said, “how i have forgotten thee! and so thou still
thinkest of me! oh! thou art not an ingrate!”

at the same time, as though an invisible hand had lifted the weight
which had repressed her tears in her heart for so lo

the poor bellringer. he was too ugly.

she had left the whistle which he had given her lying on the ground.
this did not prevent quasimodo from making his appearance from time to
time during the first few days. she did her best not to turn aside with
too much repugnance when he came to bring her her basket of provisions
or her jug of water, but he always perceived the slightest movement of
this sort, and then he withdrew sadly.

once he came at the moment when she was caressing djali. he stood
pensively for several minutes before this graceful group of the goat and
the gypsy; at last he said, shaking his heavy and ill-formed head,--

“my misfortune is that i still resemble a man too much. i should like to
be wholly a beast like that goat.”

she gazed at him in amazement.

he replied to the glance,--

“oh! i well know why,” and he went away.

on another occasion he presented himself at the door of the cell (which
he never entered) at the moment when la esmeralda was

e water with which it had been filled to escape,
and the flowers which it contained were withered. the other was an
earthenware pot, coarse and common, but which had preserved all its
water, and its flowers remained fresh and crimson.

i know not whether it was done intentionally, but la esmeralda took the
faded nosegay and wore it all day long upon her breast.

that day she did not hear the voice singing in the tower.

she troubled herself very little about it. she passed her days in
caressing djali, in watching the door of the gondelaurier house, in
talking to herself about phoebus, and in crumbling up her bread for the
swallows.

she had entirely ceased to see or hear quasimodo. the poor bellringer
seemed to have disappeared from the church. one night, nevertheless,
when she was not asleep, but was thinking of her handsome captain, she
heard something breathing near her cell. she rose in alarm, and saw by
the light of the moon, a shapeless mass lying across her door on the
outside. it wa

the fury of a child. she made her beautiful
hands stiff to bruise his face. “begone, demon!”

“love me! love mepity!” cried the poor priest returning her blows with
caresses.

all at once she felt him stronger than herself.

“there must be an end to this!” he said, gnashing his teeth.

she was conquered, palpitating in his arms, and in his power. she felt a
wanton hand straying over her. she made a last effort, and began to cry:
“help! help! a vampire! a vampire!”

nothing came. djali alone was awake and bleating with anguish.

“hush!” said the panting priest.

all at once, as she struggled and crawled on the floor, the gypsy’s hand
came in contact with something cold and metal-lic-it was quasimodo’s
whistle. she seized it with a convulsive hope, raised it to her lips and
blew with all the strength that she had left. the whistle gave a clear,
piercing sound.

“what is that?” said the priest.

almost at the same instant he felt himself raised by a vigorous arm. th

ome, that i may tell you that very softly. ‘tis a truly gallant
counter-plot, which will extricate us all from the matter. pardieu, it
must be admitted that i am no fool.”

he broke off.

“oh, by the way! is the little goat with the wench?”

“yes. the devil take you!”

“they would have hanged it also, would they not?”

“what is that to me?”

“yes, they would have hanged it. they hanged a sow last month. the
headsman loveth that; he eats the beast afterwards. take my pretty
djali! poor little lamb!”

“malediction!” exclaimed dom claude. “you are the executioner. what
means of safety have you found, knave? must your idea be extracted with
the forceps?”

“very fine, master, this is it.”

gringoire bent his head to the archdeacon’s head and spoke to him in a
very low voice, casting an uneasy glance the while from one end to the
other of the street, though no one was passing. when he had finished,
dom claude took his hand and said coldly: “‘tis well. far

turned round. two men, one of whom carried a lantern, had just entered
her cell. she uttered a feeble cry.

“fear nothing,” said a voice which was not unknown to her, “it is i.”

“who are you?” she asked.

“pierre gringoire.”

this name reassured her. she raised her eyes once more, and recognized
the poet in very fact. but there stood beside him a black figure veiled
from head to foot, which struck her by its silence.

“oh!” continued gringoire in a tone of reproach, “djali recognized me
before you!”

the little goat had not, in fact, waited for gringoire to announce his
name. no sooner had he entered than it rubbed itself gently against his
knees, covering the poet with caresses and with white hairs, for it was
shedding its hair. gringoire returned the caresses.

“who is this with you?” said the gypsy, in a low voice.

“be at ease,” replied gringoire. “‘tis one of my friends.” then the
philosopher setting his lantern on the ground, crouched upon t

and exclaimed enthusiastically, as he pressed djali in his arms,--

“oh! ‘tis a graceful beast, more considerable no doubt, for it’s
neatness than for its size, but ingenious, subtle, and lettered as a
grammarian! let us see, my djali, hast thou forgotten any of thy pretty
tricks? how does master jacques charmolue?...”

the man in black did not allow him to finish. he approached gringoire
and shook him roughly by the shoulder.

gringoire rose.

“‘tis true,” said he: “i forgot that we are in haste. but that is no
reason master, for getting furious with people in this manner. my dear
and lovely child, your life is in danger, and djali’s also. they want
to hang you again. we are your friends, and we have come to sav

izing two oars, seated
himself in the bow, rowing with all his might towards midstream. the
seine is very rapid at this point, and he had a good deal of trouble in
leaving the point of the island.

gringoire’s first care on entering the boat was to place the goat on
his knees. he took a position in the stern; and the young girl, whom the
stranger inspired with an indefinable uneasiness, seated herself close
to the poet.

when our philosopher felt the boat sway, he clapped his hands and kissed
djali between the horns.

“oh!” said he, “now we are safe, all four of us.”

he added with the air of a profound thinker, “one is indebted
sometimes to fortune, sometimes to ruse, for the happy issue of great
enterprises.”

the boat made its way slowly towards the right shore. the young girl
watched the unknown man with secret terror. he had carefully turned off
the light of his dark lantern. a glimpse could be caught of him in the
obscurity, in the bow of the boat, like a spectre. his co

the unhappy girl dropped her head upon her hands, and the unknown began
to row furiously towards the shore. meanwhile our philosopher reflected.
he clasped the goat in his arms, and gently drew away from the gypsy,
who pressed closer and closer to him, as though to the only asylum which
remained to her.

it is certain that gringoire was enduring cruel perplexity. he was
thinking that the goat also, “according to existing law,” would be hung
if recaptured; which would be a great pity, poor djali! that he had thus
two condemned creatures attached to him; that his companion asked no
better than to take charge of the gypsy. a violent combat began between
his thoughts, in which, like the jupiter of the iliad, he weighed in
turn the gypsy and the goat; and he looked at them alternately with eyes
moist with tears, saying between his teeth:

“but i cannot save you both!”

a shock informed them that the boat had reached the land at last. the
uproar still filled the city. the unknown rose,
