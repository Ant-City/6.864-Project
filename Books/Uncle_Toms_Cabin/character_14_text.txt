 and the trader laughed at his joke.

there was something so piquant and original in these elucidations of
humanity, that mr. shelby could not help laughing in company. perhaps
you laugh too, dear reader; but you know humanity comes out in a variety
of strange forms now-a-days, and there is no end to the odd things that
humane people will say and do.

mr. shelbyâ€™s laugh encouraged the trader to proceed.

â€œitâ€™s strange, now, but i never could beat this into peopleâ€™s heads.
now, there was tom loker, my old partner, down in natchez; he was a
clever fellow, tom was, only the very devil with niggers,--on principle
â€˜t was, you see, for a better hearted feller never broke bread; â€˜t was
his _system_, sir. i used to talk to tom. â€˜why, tom,â€™ i used to say,
â€˜when your gals takes on and cry, whatâ€™s the use oâ€™ crackin onâ€™ em over
the head, and knockinâ€™ on â€˜em round? itâ€™s ridiculous,â€™ says i, â€˜and
donâ€™t do no sort oâ€™ good. why, i donâ€™t see no harm in their cryinâ€™,â€™

 this yer way?â€ and
haley relieved himself by repeating over a not very select litany of
imprecations on himself, which, though there was the best possible
reason to consider them as true, we shall, as a matter of taste, omit.

he was startled by the loud and dissonant voice of a man who was
apparently dismounting at the door. he hurried to the window.

â€œby the land! if this yer anâ€™t the nearest, now, to what iâ€™ve heard
folks call providence,â€ said haley. â€œi do bâ€™lieve that arâ€™s tom loker.â€

haley hastened out. standing by the bar, in the corner of the room,
was a brawny, muscular man, full six feet in height, and broad in
proportion. he was dressed in a coat of buffalo-skin, made with the hair
outward, which gave him a shaggy and fierce appearance, perfectly in
keeping with the whole air of his physiognomy. in the head and face
every organ and lineament expressive of brutal and unhesitating violence
was in a state of the highest possible development. indeed, could our

nicely swapped off for a keg oâ€™ whiskey; but come to get him away
from the gal, she was jest like a tiger. so â€˜t was before we started,
and i hadnâ€™t got my gang chained up; so what should she do but ups on
a cotton-bale, like a cat, ketches a knife from one of the deck hands,
and, i tell ye, she made all fly for a minit, till she saw â€˜t wanâ€™t no
use; and she jest turns round, and pitches head first, young un and all,
into the river,--went down plump, and never ris.â€

â€œbah!â€ said tom loker, who had listened to these stories with
ill-repressed disgust,--â€œshifâ€™less, both on ye! _my_ gals donâ€™t cut up
no such shines, i tell ye!â€

â€œindeed! how do you help it?â€ said marks, briskly.

â€œhelp it? why, i buys a gal, and if sheâ€™s got a young un to be sold, i
jest walks up and puts my fist to her face, and says, â€˜look here, now,
if you give me one word out of your head, iâ€™ll smash yer face in. i
wonâ€™t hear one word--not the beginning of a word.â€™ i says to â€˜em, â€˜th

t come natural to him; but, lord, if tharâ€™s a
feller in the country that can swear to anything and everything, and put
in all the circumstances and flourishes with a long face, and carry â€˜t
through better â€˜n i can, why, iâ€™d like to see him, thatâ€™s all! i bâ€™lieve
my heart, i could get along and snake through, even if justices were
more particular than they is. sometimes i rather wish they was more
particular; â€˜t would be a heap more relishinâ€™ if they was,--more fun,
yer know.â€

tom loker, who, as we have made it appear, was a man of slow thoughts
and movements, here interrupted marks by bringing his heavy fist down on
the table, so as to make all ring again, _â€œitâ€™ll do!â€_ he said.

â€œlord bless ye, tom, ye neednâ€™t break all the glasses!â€ said marks;
â€œsave your fist for time oâ€™ need.â€

â€œbut, gentlemen, anâ€™t i to come in for a share of the profits?â€ said
haley.

â€œanâ€™t it enough we catch the boy for ye?â€ said loker. â€œwhat do ye want?â€

 the fighting, george,â€ said phineas, chewing
some checkerberry-leaves as he spoke; â€œbut i may have the fun of looking
on, i suppose. but see, these fellows are kinder debating down there,
and looking up, like hens when they are going to fly up on to the roost.
hadnâ€™t thee better give â€˜em a word of advice, before they come up, just
to tell â€˜em handsomely theyâ€™ll be shot if they do?â€

the party beneath, now more apparent in the light of the dawn, consisted
of our old acquaintances, tom loker and marks, with two constables,
and a posse consisting of such rowdies at the last tavern as could be
engaged by a little brandy to go and help the fun of trapping a set of
niggers.

â€œwell, tom, yer coons are farly treed,â€ said one.

â€œyes, i see â€˜em go up right here,â€ said tom; â€œand hereâ€™s a path. iâ€™m for
going right up. they canâ€™t jump down in a hurry, and it wonâ€™t take long
to ferret â€˜em out.â€

â€œbut, tom, they might fire at us from behind the rocks,â€ said marks.

.â€

â€œugh!â€ said tom, with a sneer. â€œalways for saving your skin, marks! no
danger! niggers are too plaguy scared!â€

â€œi donâ€™t know why i _shouldnâ€™t_ save my skin,â€ said marks. â€œitâ€™s the
best iâ€™ve got; and niggers _do_ fight like the devil, sometimes.â€

at this moment, george appeared on the top of a rock above them, and,
speaking in a calm, clear voice, said,

â€œgentlemen, who are you, down there, and what do you want?â€

â€œwe want a party of runaway niggers,â€ said tom loker. â€œone george
harris, and eliza harris, and their son, and jim selden, and an old
woman. weâ€™ve got the officers, here, and a warrant to take â€˜em; and
weâ€™re going to have â€˜em, too. dâ€™ye hear? anâ€™t you george harris, that
belongs to mr. harris, of shelby county, kentucky?â€

â€œi am george harris. a mr. harris, of kentucky, did call me his
property. but now iâ€™m a free man, standing on godâ€™s free soil; and my
wife and my child i claim as mine. jim and his mother are here. we have

a while we must leave tom in the hands of his persecutors, while we turn
to pursue the fortunes of george and his wife, whom we left in friendly
hands, in a farmhouse on the road-side.

tom loker we left groaning and touzling in a most immaculately clean
quaker bed, under the motherly supervision of aunt dorcas, who found him
to the full as tractable a patient as a sick bison.

imagine a tall, dignified, spiritual woman, whose clear muslin cap
shades waves of silvery hair, parted on a broad, clear forehead, which
overarches thoughtful gray eyes. a snowy handkerchief of lisse crape
is folded neatly across her bosom; her glossy brown silk dress rustles
peacefully, as she glides up and dow

n the chamber.

â€œthe devil!â€ says tom loker, giving a great throw to the bedclothes.

â€œi must request thee, thomas, not to use such language,â€ says aunt
dorcas, as she quietly rearranged the bed.

â€œwell, i wonâ€™t, granny, if i can help it,â€ says tom; â€œbut it is enough
to make a fellow swear,--so cursedly hot!â€

dorcas removed a comforter from the bed, straightened the clothes
again, and tucked them in till tom looked something like a chrysalis;
remarking, as she did so,

â€œi wish, friend, thee would leave off cursing and sw

get away, just to spite marks,--the cursed puppy!--d--n him!â€

â€œthomas!â€ said dorcas.

â€œi tell you, granny, if you bottle a fellow up too tight, i shall
split,â€ said tom. â€œbut about the gal,--tell â€˜em to dress her up some
way, soâ€™s to alter her. her descriptionâ€™s out in sandusky.â€

â€œwe will attend to that matter,â€ said dorcas, with characteristic
composure.

as we at this place take leave of tom loker, we may as well say, that,
having lain three weeks at the quaker dwelling, sick with a rheumatic
fever, which set in, in company with his other afflictions, tom
arose from his bed a somewhat sadder and wiser man; and, in place of
slave-catching, betook himself to life in one of the new settlements,
where his talents developed themselves more happily in trapping bears,
wolves, and other inhabitants of the forest, in which he made himself
quite a name in the land. tom always spoke reverently of t

â€œiâ€™ve heard,â€ said mrs. smyth, â€œthat there have been men down, warning
all the packet captains against a man and woman, with a little boy.â€

â€œthey have!â€ said george. â€œwell, if we see any such people, we can tell
them.â€

a hack now drove to the door, and the friendly family who had received
the fugitives crowded around them with farewell greetings.

the disguises the party had assumed were in accordance with the hints
of tom loker. mrs. smyth, a respectable woman from the settlement in
canada, whither they were fleeing, being fortunately about crossing the
lake to return thither, had consented to appear as the aunt of little
harry; and, in order to attach him to her, he had been allowed to
remain, the two last days, under her sole charge; and an extra amount
of petting, jointed to an indefinite amount of seed-cakes and candy, had
cemented a very close attachment on the part of the young gentleman.
