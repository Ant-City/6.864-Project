there, right through the cotton." 

joad looked where casy's finger pointed. "comin' afoot," he said. "can't see 'im for 
the dust he raises. who the hell's comin' here?" they watched the figure approaching 
in the evening light, and the dust it raised was reddened by the setting sun. "man," said 
joad. the man drew closer, and as he walked past the barn, joad said, "why, i know 
him. you know him—that's muley graves." and he called, "hey, muley! how ya?" 

the approaching man stopped, startled by the call, and then he came on quickly. he 
was a lean man, rather short. his movements were jerky and quick. he carried a gunny 
sack in his hand. his blue jeans were pale at knee and seat, and he wore an old black

they heard a voice speaking reassuringly to the barking dogs and the barking lost its
