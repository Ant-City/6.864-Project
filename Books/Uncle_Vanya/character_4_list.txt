Sofya Alexandrovna (Sonya) (sofya/sonya alexandravna)  - 
      Serebryakov's daughter by his first marriage, Sonya is named after the Greek for wisdom ("sophia"), though one wonders if she is particularly wise. Gentle but homely, she has steadfastly given herself to the maintenance of the estate and pines hopelessly after the brooding Dr. Astrov amidst all her drudgery. Throughout the play, she will be quick to chastise those who would disrupt the household--her father in particular--and will joylessly rededicate herself to her toils at the end of the play.
