 but
my wants were different. i didnâ€™t want just
one  dog.  i  wanted  two,  and  not  just  any
kind  of  a  dog.  they  had  to  be  a  special
kind and a special breed.

i had to have some dogs. i went to my
father  and  had  a  talk  with  him.  he
scratched his head and thought it over.

â€œwell, billy,â€ he said, â€œi heard that old
man  hatfieldâ€™s  collie  is  going  to  have
pups.  iâ€™m  sure  i  can  get  one  of  them  for
you.â€

he may as well have poured cold water
on me. â€œpapa,â€ i said, â€œi donâ€™t want an old

collie  dog.  i  want  houndsâ€”coon  hounds
â€”and i want two of them.â€

i could tell by the look on his face that

he wanted to help me, but couldnâ€™t.

he said, â€œbilly, those kind of dogs cost
money,  and  thatâ€™s  something  we  donâ€™t
have right now. maybe some day when we
can  afford  it,  you  can  have  them,  but  not
right now.â€

i  didnâ€™t  give  up.  after  my  talk  with
papa,  i  went  to  mama.  i  fared  no  better
there. right of

i  was  a  hunter  from  the  time  i  could
walk.  i  caught  lizards  on  the  rail  fences,
rats in the corncrib, and frogs in the little

creek  that  ran  through  the  fields.  i  was  a
young daniel boone.

as  the  days  passed,  the  dog-wanting
disease  grew  worse.  i  began  to  see  dogs
in my sleep. i went back to my father and
mother.  it  was  the  same  old  story.  good
hounds  cost  money,  and  they  just  didnâ€™t
have it.

â€œi know,â€ said papa, â€œand i feel just as
badly as you do, but what can i do? you
know we donâ€™t have that kind of money.â€

my dog-wanting became so bad i began
to  lose  weight  and  my  food  didnâ€™t  taste
good any more. mama noticed this and she
had a talk with papa.
â€œyouâ€™re  going

to  do
something,â€ she said. â€œi never saw a boy
grieve like that. itâ€™s not right, not right at
all.â€

â€œi offered to get him a dog,â€ said papa,
â€œbut he doesnâ€™t want just any kind of dog.
he wants hounds, and they cost money. do
you  know  what  the  parker  boys  paid  for
those  two  hounds  they  bought?  seventy-
five dollars! if i had that much money, iâ€™d
buy another mule. i sure do need one.â€

i had overheard this conversation from
another  room.  at  first  it  made  me  feel
pretty good. at least i was getting to be a
problem.  then  i  didnâ€™t  feel  so  good.  i
knew my mother and father were poor and
didnâ€™t  have

sorry for them and myself.

after  thinking  it  over,  i  figured  out  a
way  to  help.  even  though  it  was  a  great
sacrifice,  i  told  papa  i  had  decided  i
didnâ€™t  want  two  hounds.  one  would  be
enough. i saw the hurt in his eyes. it made
me feel like someone was squeezing water
out of my heart.

papa  set  me  on  his  lap  and  we  had  a
good  talk.  he  told  me  how  hard  times
were,  and  that  it  looked  like  a  man
couldnâ€™t  get  a  fair  price  for  anything  he
raised.  some  of  the  farmers  had  quit
farming  and  were  cutting  railroad  ties  so
they  could  feed  their  families.  if  things
didnâ€™t get better, thatâ€™s what heâ€™d have to
do. he said heâ€™d give anything if he could
get  some  good  hounds  for  me,  but  there
didnâ€™t seem to be any way he could righ

i went off to bed with my heart all torn
up  in  little  pieces,  and  cried  myself  to
sleep.

the  next  day  papa  had  to  go  to  the
store. late that evening i saw him coming
back. as fast as i could, i ran to meet him,
expecting  a  sack  of  candy.  instead  he
handed me three small steel traps.

if santa claus himself had come down
out  of  the  mountains,  reindeer  and  all,  i
would  not  have  been  more  pleased.  i
jumped  up  and  down,  and  cried  a  whole
bucketful  of  tears.  i  hugged  him  and  told
him what a wonderful papa he was.

he  showed  me  how  to  set  them  by
mashing  the

garden  down  under  some  tall  hollyhocks.
thinking  they  were  game  trails,  and  not
knowing
they  were  samieâ€™s  favorite
hunting  trails,  i  set  my  traps.  samie
couldnâ€™t understand what i was doing out
there, messing around his hunting territory.
he went to investigate.

it  wasnâ€™t  long  until  i  had  him  limping
with  all  four  feet.  every  time  papa  saw
samie lying around in the warm sun with
his feet wrapped up in turpentine rags, he
would  laugh  until  big  tears  rolled  down
his cheeks.

mama had another talk with papa. she

papa  looked  over  at  samie.  he  was
lying all sprawled out in the sunshine with
all  four  paws  bandaged  and  sticking
straight up. his long tail was swishing this
way and that.

â€œyou see, papa,â€ i said, â€œheâ€™s watching
me right now, just waiting for me to set my
traps.â€

papa told me to be a little more careful

papa  walked  off  toward  the  barn.  i

heard him laughing fit to kill.

it  finally  got  too  tough  for  samie.  he
left home. oh, he came in once in a while,
all  long  and  lean  looking,  but  he  never

was  the  same  friendly  cat  any  more.  he
was nervous and wouldnâ€™t let anyone pet
him. he would gobble down his milk and
then scoot for the timber.

once  i  decided  to  make  friends  with
him because i felt bad about catching him
in my traps. i reached out my hand to rub
his back.

he swelled up like a sitting hen.
his eyeballs got all green, and he growled
way down deep. he spat at me, and drew
back his paw like he was going to knock
my head off. i decided iâ€™d better leave him
alone.

in no time at all i cleaned out the rats.
then  something  bad  happened.  i  caught
one  of  mamaâ€™s  prize  hens.  i  got  one  of
those  â€œyoung  man  peach  treeâ€  switchings
over that.

papa  told  me  to  go  down  in  the

canebrakes  back  of  our  fields  and  trap.
this opened up all kinds of new wonders.
i  caught  opossums,  skunks,  rabbits,  and
squirrels.

papa showed me how to skin my game.
in neat little rows i tacked the hides on the
smokehouse wall. iâ€™d stand for hours and
admire my magnificent trophies.

there  was  only  one  thing  wrong.  i

steal  the  bait  from  the  traps,  spring  the
triggers,  and  sometimes  even  turn  them
over.

once  i  found  a  small  stick  standing
upright in one of my traps. i showed it to
papa. he laughed and said the stick must
have  fallen  from  a  tree.  it  made  no

the

difference  what  papa  said.  i  was  firmly
convinced  that  a  smart  old  coon  had
deliberately poked that stick in my trap.

traps  helped  my  dog-wanting
considerably,  but  like  a  new  toy,  the
newness  wore  off  and  i  was  right  back
where i started from. only this time it was
worse, much worse. i had been exposed to
the feel of wildlife.

i  started  pestering  mama  again.  she
said,  â€œoh,  no!  not  that  again.  i  thought
youâ€™d  be  satisfied  with  the  traps.  no,
billy, i donâ€™t want to

my eyes were red
and bloodshot. i had lost weight and was
as thin as a bean pole. mama checked me
over. she looked at my tongue and turned
back one of my eyelids.

â€œif i didnâ€™t know better,â€ she said, â€œiâ€™d
swear  you  werenâ€™t  sleeping  well.  are

you?â€

â€œwhy,  mama,â€  i  said,  â€œi  go  to  bed,
donâ€™t i? what does a boy go to bed for if it
isnâ€™t to sleep?â€

by  the  little  wrinkles  that  bunched  up
on  her  forehead,  i  could  tell  that  mama
wasnâ€™t satisfied. papa came in during one
of  these  inspections.  mama  told  him  she
was worried about my health.

â€œaw,â€  he  said,  â€œthereâ€™s  nothing  wrong
with  him.  itâ€™s  just  because  heâ€™s  been
cooped  up  all  winter.  a  boy  needs
sunshine,  and  exercise.  heâ€™s  almost
eleven now, and iâ€™m going to let him help
me in the fields this summer. that will put
the muscles back on him.â€

i thought this was wonderful. iâ€™d finally
grown up to be a man. i was going to help
papa with the farm.

the  dog-wanting  disease  never  did  leave  me
altogether.  with  the  new  work  i  was

just  when  i  had  given  up  all  hope  of
ever  owning  a  good  hound,  something
wonderful  happened.  the  good  lord
figured i had hurt enough, and it was time
to lend a helping hand.

it all started one day while i was hoeing
corn down in our field clo

boy can dream some fantastic dreams.

have two of those pups. every boy in the
country but me had a good hound or two.
but  fifty  dollarsâ€”how  could  i  ever  get
fifty dollars? i knew i couldnâ€™t expect help
from mama and papa.

i remembered a passage from the bible
my  mother  had  read  to  us:  â€œgod  helps
those  who  help  themselves.â€  i  thought  of
the words. i mulled them over in my mind.
i  decided  iâ€™d  ask  god  to  help  me.  there
on  the  banks  of  the  illinois  river,  in  the
cool  shade  of  the  tall  white  sycamores,  i
asked god to help me get two hound pups.
it wasnâ€™t much of a prayer, but it did come
right from the heart.

when  i  left  the  campground  of  the
fishermen, it was late

i  thanked  my  grandfather  with  all  my
heart and asked him how long iâ€™d have to
wait for the notice.

he said, â€œi donâ€™t know, but it shouldnâ€™t

take more than a couple of weeks.â€

i asked how i was going to get my dogs

out from tahlequah.

â€œwell,  thereâ€™s  always  someone  going
in,â€ he said, â€œand you could ride in with
them.â€

that  evening  the  silence  of  our  supper

was  interrupted  when  i  asked  my  father
this  question:  â€œpapa,  how  far  is  it  to
kentucky?â€

i  may  as  well  have  exploded  a  bomb.
for an instant there was complete silence,
and then my oldest sister giggled. the two
little ones stared at me.

with  a  half-hearted  laugh,  my  father
said, â€œwell, now, i donâ€™t know, but itâ€™s a
pretty  good  ways.  what  do  you  want  to
know  for?  thinking  of  taking  a  trip  to
kentucky?â€

â€œno,â€ i said. â€œi just wondered.â€
my  youngest  sister  giggled  and  asked,

â€œcan i go with you?â€

 on their way, i
heard  one  of  them  say  something  to  the
other. the words were hard to catch, but i
did  hear  one  word:  â€œwild.â€  as  i  said
before,  they  couldnâ€™t  help  it,  they  were
womenfolks.

as i turned to leave, my eyes again fell
on  the  overalls  and  the  bolts  of  cloth.  i
thought  of  my  mother,  father,  and  sisters.
here was an opportunity to make amends
for leaving home without telling anyone.

i  entered  the  store.  i  bought  a  pair  of
overalls  for  papa.  after
the
storekeeper  how  big  my  mother  and
sisters  were,  i  bought  several  yards  of

telling

cloth. i also bought a large sack of candy.
glancing  down  at  my  bare  feet,  the
storekeeper  said,  â€œi  have  some  good
shoes.â€

i told him i didnâ€™t need any shoes.
he asked if that would be all.
i nodded.
he added up the bill. i handed him my

ten dollars. he gave me my change.

after  wrapping  up  the  bundles,  he
helped me put them in my sack. lifting it
to my shoulder, i

they  sounded  like  the  squeaky  old  pulley

him the slip my grandpa had given me.

â€œthey  sure  are  fine-looking  pups,â€  he
said.  â€œyouâ€™ll  have  to  go  around  to  the

iâ€™m  sure  my  feet  never  touched  the
ground  as  i  flew  around  the  building.  he
unlocked  the  door,  and  i  stepped  in,
looking  for  my  dogs.  i  couldnâ€™t  see
anything  but  boxes,  barrels,  old  trunks,
and some rolls of barbed wire.

the  kindly  stationmaster  walked  over

to one of the boxes.

you tell us? why?â€

i couldnâ€™t answer.
between  sobs,  i  heard  the  squeals  of

delight from my sisters as they fondled my
pups.

i  heard  my  father  say,  â€œwhatâ€™s  this

other stuff youâ€™ve got?â€

without  raising  my  head  from  my
motherâ€™s  lap,  in  a  choking  voice  i  said,
â€œone is for you, one is for mama, and the
other is for the girls.â€

i  heard  the  snapping  of  string  and  the
rattle of paper. the ohâ€™s and ahâ€™s from my
sisters were wonderful to hear.

papa  came  over  to  mama.  laying  the
cloth  on  the  arm  of  her  chair,  he  said,
â€œwell, youâ€™ve been wanting a new dress.
here is enough cloth to make half a dozen
dresses.â€

realizing that everything was forgiven,
i  stood  up  and  dried  my  eyes.  papa  was
pleased with his new overalls. my sisters

forgot  the  pups  for  the  candy.  the  light
that  was  shining  from  my  motherâ€™s  eyes,
as she fingered the cheap cotton cloth, was
something i will never forget.

the other one put her nickelâ€™s worth in,

â€œwerenâ€™t you scared?â€

wouldnâ€™t live there even if they gave it to

and had even laughed and made fun of me.
he  said,  â€œaw,  i  donâ€™t  think  they  were

making fun of you, were they?â€

â€œyes, they were,â€ i said, â€œand to beat it
all,  the  boys  jumped  on  me  and  knocked

papa  said,  â€œso  you  met  the  marshal.

what did you think of him?â€

i  told  him  he  was  a  nice  man.  he  had

bought me a bottle of soda pop.

at  the  mention  of  soda  pop,  the  blue
eyes  of  my  sisters  opened  wide.  they
started  firing  questions  at  me,  wanting  to
know what color it was, and what it tasted
like. i told them it was strawberry and it
bubbled and tickled when i drank it, and it
made me burp.

with  my  confidence  restored,  it  all
sounded  pretty  good  to  me  and  i  was
anxious  to  try  out  this  wonderful  plan.  i
thanked  him  and,  taking  the  brace  and
nails, i left the store.

by the time i reached home it was too
late  in  the  day  to  start  making  my  traps.
that  night  i  talked  the  idea  over  with
papa.

â€œiâ€™ve  heard  of  coons  being  caught  that
way,â€  he  said,  â€œbut  i  never  paid  much
attention  to  it.  your  grandfather  should
know,  though,  for  he  was  quite  a  coon
hunter when he was a boy.â€

â€œfrom  what  he  told  me,â€  i  said,  â€œit

never fails.â€

make my traps.

papa  asked  if  i  wanted  him  to  help

â€œno,â€  i  said,  â€œi  think  i  can  do  it

myself.â€

i  didnâ€™t  sleep  too  well  that  night.  i
bored holes, drove nails, and fought coons

the stinging stopped.

it  wasnâ€™t  hard  to  find  places  for  my
traps. all  along  the  river  large  sycamore
logs lay partly submerged in the clear blue
water.  on  one  where  i  could  see  the
muddy little tracks of the ringtails, i bored
a  hole,  dropped  in  a  piece  of  tin,  and
drove my nails.

on  down  the  river  i  went,  making  my

traps.  i  stopped  when  i  ran  out  of  nails.
altogether i had fourteen traps.

itâ€™ll take a while for it to go away. now i
wouldnâ€™t get too impatient. iâ€™m pretty sure
youâ€™ll catch one sooner or later.â€

one  morning  i  didnâ€™t  get  up  to  run  my

papaâ€™s words perked me up just like air
does a deflated inner tube. he was right. i
had simply left too much scent around my
traps.  all  i  had  to  do  was  wait  until  it
disappeared and iâ€™d have my coon hide.

morning after morning it was the same
old  disappointment;  no  coon.  when  a
week had gone by and still no results from
my traps, i gave up. what little patience i
had  was  completely  gone.  i  was  firmly
convinced  that  coons  didnâ€™t  walk  on
sycamore logs any more, and brig

use? it was just a waste of time.

when the family sat down to breakfast,
i heard my oldest sister say, â€œmama, isnâ€™t
billy going to get up for breakfast?â€

â€œwhy, is he in his room?â€ mama asked.
â€œi  didnâ€™t  know.  i  thought  he  was  down
looking at his traps.â€

i  heard  papa  say,  â€œiâ€™ll  go  wake  him

up.â€

he came to the door and said, â€œyouâ€™d

better get up, billy. breakfast is ready.â€

â€œi  donâ€™t  want  any  breakfast,â€  i  said.

â€œiâ€™m not hungry.â€

papa took one look at me and saw i had
a bad case of the ringtail blues. he came
over and sat down on the bed.

â€œwhatâ€™s  the  matter?â€  he  asked.  â€œyou

having coon trouble?â€

â€œi  wouldnâ€™t  say  that,â€  papa  said.  â€œi
donâ€™t think your grandpa deliberately lied
to you. besides, iâ€™ve heard of coons being
caught that way.â€

â€œwell, i donâ€™t think iâ€™ve done anything
wrong,â€  i  said.  â€œiâ€™ve  done  everything
exactly  as  he  said,  and  i  havenâ€™t  caught
one yet.â€

â€œi still think itâ€™s that scent,â€ papa said.
â€œyou know, someone told me, or i read it
somewhere, that it takes about a week for
scent  to  die  away.  how  long  has  it  been
since you made those traps?â€

â€œitâ€™s been over a week,â€ i said.
â€œwell, the way i figure, itâ€™s about time

for you to catch one. yes, sir, i wouldnâ€™t
be surprised if you came in with one any
day now.â€

after  papa  had  left  the  room  i  lay
thinking  of  what  he  had  said.  â€œany  day
now.â€ i got up and hurried into my clothes.

in and grabbed him by the hind leg.

with a pup under each arm and running

coming  out  of  the  bottoms  into  a  fresh-

harnessing  his

something  to  him  about  a  snake.  he
dropped the harness, jumped over the rail

mama  reached  me  first.  she  grabbed

â€œhe needs a whipping,â€ the oldest one
said, â€œthatâ€™s what he needs, scaring mama

something busted loose inside me and i

cried a little, too.

â€œi  didnâ€™t  mean  to  scare  mama,â€  i

â€œmaybe  this  is  where  it  came  from,â€

papa said.

he reached down and picked up my boy

open and was bleeding.

i  saw  a  relieved  look  come  over

mamaâ€™s face.

looking  at  me,  she  started  shaking  her
head.  â€œi  donâ€™t  know,â€  she  said.  â€œi  just
donâ€™t know.â€

â€œdid  that  coon  get  hold  of  this  pup?â€

papa asked.

â€œhe  sure  did,  papa,â€  i  said,  â€œbut  it
wasnâ€™t  the  coonâ€™s  fault.  if  it  hadnâ€™t  been
for little ann, heâ€™d have eaten him up.â€

i  told  how  my  dogs  had  tied  into  the

coon.

papa  laughed  as  he  fondled  my  pup.
â€œthis dog is going to be a coon hound,â€ he
said, â€œand i mean a good one.â€

the  coon  started  squalling  as  soon  as

we came in sight.

â€œmy  goodness,â€  mama  said,  â€œyou
wouldnâ€™t think anything so small would be
so vicious.â€

papa  picked  up  a  club.  â€œnow
everybody stand back out of the way,â€ he
said. â€œthis wonâ€™t take long.â€

my  pups  were  wanting  to  get  to  the
coon so badly that they were hard to hold.
i had to squeeze them up tight to keep them
from jumping right out of my arms.

my  sisters,  with  eyes  as  big  as  blue
marbles,  got  behind  mama  and  peeked
around her.

they left. i heard the tall cane rattling as
they ran for the house.

after  the  coon  was  killed,  i  walked
over.  papa  was  trying  to  get  the  coonâ€™s
paw  from  the  trap.  he  couldnâ€™t  do  it.
taking a pair of pliers from his pocket, he
said, â€œitâ€™s a good thing i had these along
or we would have had to cut his foot off.â€
after  papa  had  pulled  the  nails,  he
lifted  the  coonâ€™s  paw  from  the  hole.
there, clamped firmly in it, was the bright
piece of tin.

darned. all  he  had  to  do  was  open  it  up

a  sorrowful  look  came  over  papaâ€™s
face as he ran his fingers through the soft,
yellow hair. â€œbilly,â€ he said, â€œi want you
to  take  a  hammer  and  pull  the  nails  from
every one of those traps. itâ€™s summertime
now and their fur isnâ€™t any good. besides,
i  donâ€™t  think  this  is  very  sportsmanlike.
the  coon  doesnâ€™t  have  a  chance.  itâ€™s  all
right  this  time. you  needed  this  one,  but
from now on i want you to catch them with
your dogs. that way they have a fifty-fifty

â€œno,  i  donâ€™t  think  so,â€  he  said.  â€œiâ€™ve
heard that the younger they are the better it
is.â€

the  day  hunting  season  opened,  i  was  as
nervous  as  samie,  our  house  cat.  part  of
that  seemingly  endless  day  was  spent
getting things ready for the coming night.

i cleaned my lantern and filled it full of
oil. with hog lard i greased my boots until
they were as soft as a hummingbirdâ€™s nest.
i  was  grinding  my  ax  when  papa  came
around.

he  smiled  as  he  said,  â€œthis  is  the  big

night, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œit  sure  is,  papa,â€  i  said,  â€œand  iâ€™ve

waited a long time for it.â€

â€œyes,  i  know,â€  he  said.  â€œiâ€™ve  been
thinkingâ€”thereâ€™s  not  too  much  to  do

pretty sure i can take care of things, so you
just go ahead and hunt all you want to.â€

papa started frowning. â€œyou know,â€ he
said,  â€œyour  mother  doesnâ€™t
this
hunting of yours very much. sheâ€™s worried
about you being out all by yourself.â€

â€œi canâ€™t see why mama has to worry,â€ i
said. â€œhavenâ€™t i been roaming the woods
ever since i was big enough to walk, and
iâ€™m almost fourteen now.â€

â€œi know,â€ said papa. â€œitâ€™s all right with
me,  but  women  are  a  little  different  than
men. they worry more.

â€œnow just to be on the safe side, i think

it would be a good idea for you to tell us
where youâ€™ll be hunting. then if anything
happens, weâ€™ll know where to look.â€

i  told  him  i  would,  but  i  didnâ€™t  think

anything was going to happen.

after  papa  had  left,  i  started  thinking.

boy any more. he talks to me like i was a

â€œiâ€™m not going far,â€ i said, â€œjust down

during supper mama asked me where i

i  could  tell  mama  was  worried  and  it

didnâ€™t make me feel too good.

â€œbilly,â€  she  said,  â€œi  donâ€™t  approve  of
this  hunting,  but  it  looks  like  i  canâ€™t  say
no;  not  after  all  youâ€™ve  been  through,
getting your dogs, and all that training.â€

â€œaw,  heâ€™ll  be  all  right,â€  papa  said.
â€œbesides,  heâ€™s  getting  to  be  a  good-size
man now.â€

â€œman!â€  mama  exclaimed.  â€œwhy,  heâ€™s

still just a little boy.â€

â€œyou  canâ€™t  keep  him  a  little  boy
always,â€ papa said. â€œheâ€™s got to grow up

it, not at all, and i canâ€™t help worrying.â€

â€œmama, please donâ€™t worry about me,â€

over these hills, you know that.â€

some day.â€

said. â€œi promise iâ€™ll be careful.â€

mama  got  up  from  the  table  saying,
â€œwell, itâ€™s like i said, i canâ€™t say no and i
canâ€™t help worrying. iâ€™ll pray every night
youâ€™re out.â€

the way mama had me feeling, i didnâ€™t
know  whether  to  go  hunting  or  not.  papa
must  have  sensed  how  i  felt.  â€œitâ€™s  dark

now,â€  he  said,  â€œand  i  understand  those
coons  start  stirring  pretty  early. you  had
better be going, hadnâ€™t you?â€

while mama was bundling me up, papa
lit my lantern. he handed it to me, saying,
â€œiâ€™d  like  to  see  a  big  coonskin  on  the
smokehouse wall in the morning.â€

the  whole  family  followed  me  out  on
the porch. there we all got a surprise. my
dogs were sitting on the steps, waiting for
me.

to  my  feet.  every  muscle  in  my  body
seemed to be tied in a knot. i was thinking
of  going  down  to  the  river  to  wash  my
face in the cool water when i heard a loud
whoop.  i  recognized  my  fatherâ€™s  voice.  i
whooped to let him know where i was.

papa was riding our red mule. after he
rode  up,  he  just  sat  there  and  looked  me
over. he glanced at my dogs and at the big
sycamore. i saw the worry leave his face.
he  straightened  his  shoulders,  pursed  his
lips,  and  blew  out  a
little  air.  he
reminded  me  of  someone  who  had  just
dropped a heavy load.

in  a  slow,  calm  voice,  he  asked,  â€œare

you all right, billy?â€

â€œyes,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œoh,  iâ€™m  a  little

tired and sleepy, otherwise iâ€™m fine.â€

â€œwhen  you  didnâ€™t  come  in,  we  didnâ€™t
know what had happened. you shouldâ€™ve
come home.â€

i didnâ€™t know what to say. i bowed my
head  and  looked  at  the  ground.  i  was
trying hard to choke back the tears when i
felt his hand on my shoulder.

i nodded my head.
â€œis there a coon in it?â€ he asked.
â€œthere sure is, papa,â€ i said. â€œheâ€™s in

thought  maybe  you  had  an  accident  or
something.â€

i looked up and saw a smile on his face.
he turned and looked again at the tree.
â€œsay,â€ he said, â€œthis is the sycamore you
call â€˜the big tree,â€™ isnâ€™t it?â€

that  hollow  limb.  seeâ€”that  one  way  up
there. thatâ€™s why i couldnâ€™t come home. i
was afraid heâ€™d get away.â€

â€œoh,  heâ€™s  there  all  right,â€  i  said.  â€œmy
dogs werenâ€™t ten feet behind him when he
went up it.â€

â€œwhy are you so determined to get this
coon?â€  papa  asked.  â€œcouldnâ€™t  you  go
somewhere else and tree one? maybe the
tree would be a smaller one.â€

â€œi thought about that, papa,â€ i said, â€œbut
i made a bargain with my dogs. i told them
that if they would put one in a tree, iâ€™d do
the  rest.  well,  they  fulfilled  their  part  of
the  bargain.  now  itâ€™s  up  to  me  to  do  my
part, and iâ€™m going to, papa. iâ€™m going to

cut  it  down.  i  donâ€™t  care  if  it  takes  me  a
year.â€

papa  laughed  and  said,  â€œoh,  i  donâ€™t
think itâ€™ll take that long, but it will take a
while. i tell you what iâ€˜ll do. you take the
mule and go get some breakfast.

â€œno,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œi  donâ€™t  want  any
help. i want to cut it down all by myself.
you see, if someone helps me, i wouldnâ€™t
feel like i kept my part of the agreement.â€
an  astonished  look  came  over  my
fatherâ€™s face. â€œwhy, billy,â€ he said, â€œyou
canâ€™t  stay  down  here  without  anything  to
eat  and  no  sleep.  besides,  itâ€™ll  take  at
least  two  days  to  cut  that  tree  down  and
thatâ€™s hard work.â€

â€œplease,  papa,â€  i  begged,  â€œdonâ€™t  make
me  quit.  i  just  have  to  get  that  coon.  if  i

donâ€™t, my dogs wonâ€™t ever believe in me
again.â€

papa  didnâ€™t  know  what  to  tell  me.  he
scratched  his  head,  looked  over  to  my
dogs  and  back  at  me.  he  started  walking
around.  i  waited  for  him  to  make  up  his
mind. he finally reached a decision.

â€œwell, all right,â€ he said.â€ if thatâ€™s the
way  you  want  it,  iâ€™m  for  it  even  if  it  is

â€œbut  heâ€™ll  be  all  right.  thatâ€™ll  soon  go
away.â€

after  mama  saw  that  there  were  no
broken  bones,  or  legs  chopped  off,  she
smiled and said, â€œi never know any more.
i guess iâ€™ll just have to get used to it.â€

you.â€

â€œweâ€™re having chicken and dumplings,â€

mama  beamed,  â€œand  i  cooked
especially for you.â€

during the meal i told grandpa i didnâ€™t
think that the coon in the big tree was the
same  one  my  dogs  had  been  trailing  at
first.

â€œwhat makes you think that?â€ he asked.
i told how the coon had fooled us and
how  little  ann  had  seen  or  heard  this
other coon. i figured he had just wa

i  thanked  him  for  helping  me  and

walked out to the buggy with him.

â€œoh, i almost forgot,â€ he said. â€œi heard
there was a fad back in the new england

might make a little money.â€

before  i  went  to  bed,  mama  made  me
take  a  hot  bath.  then  she  rubbed  me  all
over  with  some  liniment  that  burned  like

while we were tacking the hide on the

he thought a bit and said, â€œno, i donâ€™t

the  way  it  blew.  it  didnâ€™t  touch  another

enough to catch the wind where the others

coming  to  our  home,  would  say,  â€œyour
grandpa was telling me you got three big
coons over in pea vine hollow the other
night.â€ i would listen, knowing i only got
one, or maybe none, but grandpa was my
pal. if he said i caught ten in one tree, it

was just that way.

because  of  my  grandfatherâ€™s  bragging,
and his firm belief in my dogs and me, a
terrible thing happened.

one  morning,  while  having  breakfast,
mama  said  to  papa,  â€œiâ€™m  almost  out  of
corn meal. do you think you can go to the
mill today?â€

papa said, â€œi intended to butcher a hog.
weâ€™re about out of meat.â€ looking at me,
he said, â€œshell a sack of corn. take one of
the  mules  and  go  to  the  mill  for  your
mother.â€

with the help of my sisters, we shelled
the  corn.  throwing  it  over  our  muleâ€™s
back, i started for the store.

on arriving at the millhouse, i tied my
mule  to  the  hitching  post,  took  my  corn,
and set it by t

arriving  home,  i  awakened  my  mother
and  father.  starting  at  my  grandfatherâ€™s
mill, i told everything that had happened. i

crying  long  before  i  had  completed  my
story.  papa  said  nothing,  just  sat  and
listened.  when  i  had  finished,  he  kept
staring down at the floor in deep thought. i
could hear the sobbing of my mother in the
silence. i walked over to her. she put her
arms around me and said, â€œmy poor little

trapped indoors, i prowled from room to
room. i couldnâ€™t understand why my father
hadnâ€™t  come  back  from  the  pritchardsâ€™.  i
sat by the window and watched the road.

understanding my feelings, mama said,
â€œbilly,  i  wouldnâ€™t  worry.  heâ€™ll  be  back
before  long.  it  takes  time  for  things  like
that.â€

â€œi know,â€ i said, â€œbut you would think

he wouldâ€™ve been back by now.â€

time  dragged  slowly  by.  late  in  the
afternoon,  i  saw  papa  coming.  our  old
mule  was
jogging  along.  water  was
shooting  out  from  under  his  feet  in  small

squirts at every step.

papa had tied the halter rope around the
muleâ€™s neck. he was sitting humped over,
with his hands jammed deep in the pockets
of his patched and worn mackinaw. i felt
sorry for him. he was soaking wet, tired,
sleepy, and hungry.

telling mama, â€œhere he is,â€ i grabbed
my jumper and cap, and ran out to the gate
and waited.

i  was  going  to  ask  him  what  had

and milking.â€

â€œthat would be fine,â€ he said.
after doing the chores, i hurried to the
house. i couldnâ€™t wait any longer. i had to

find out what had happened.

walking  into  the  front  room,  i  saw  my
father  had  changed  clothes.  he  was
standing in front of the fireplace, drinking
coffee.

â€œboy,  thatâ€™s  bad  weather,  isnâ€™t  it?â€  he

met them. they were just this side of their
place.  they  had  started  to  look  for  him.
rainie  had  been  so  dazed  when  he  got

trying  to  tell  them,  but  they  knew  it  must
have been something bad. they wanted to

said  they  were  the  funniest  bunch  he  had
ever  seen.  he  couldnâ€™t  understand  them.
there  wasnâ€™t  one  tear  shed  that  he  could
see. all  of  the  men  had  stayed  out  at  the
barn. they never had been invited in for a
cup of coffee or anything.

â€œthey  have  their  own  graveyard  right
there on the place,â€ papa said. â€œold man
pritchard  said  they  would  take  care  of
everything,  and  didnâ€™t  want  to  bother
people. he said it was too far for anyone

to come, and it was bad weather, too.â€

mama  said  she  couldnâ€™t  help  feeling
sorry for mrs. pritchard, and wished they
were more friendly.

i asked papa about rainie.
papa  said,  â€œaccording  to  what  old
man  pritchard  said,  rainie  just  couldnâ€™t
seem  to  get  over  the  shock.  they  were
figuring on taking him into town to see the
doctor.â€

in  a  stern  voice,  papa  said,  â€œbilly,  i
donâ€™t  want  you  fooling  around  with  the
pritchards  any  more. you  have  plenty  of
country around here so you donâ€™t have to
go there to hunt.â€

i saw the thinking wrinkles bunch up on

grandpaâ€™s forehead.

â€œyou reckon your daddy would like to
go?â€ he asked. â€œas late in the fall as it is,
i donâ€™t think heâ€™s too busy, is he?â€

â€œno, our crops are all gathered,â€ i said.
â€œweâ€™ve been clearing some of the bottom

land, but thatâ€™s almost done now.â€

â€œwell, ask him,â€ he said. â€œtell him iâ€™d

like to have him go.â€

â€œiâ€™ll  ask  him,â€  i  said,  â€œbut  you  know
how  papa  is.  the  farm  comes  first  with
him.â€

â€œi  know,â€  grandpa  said,  â€œbut  you  ask
him  anyway,  and  tell  him  what  i  said.
now itâ€™s getting late and you had better be
heading for home.â€

i was almost to the door when grandpa

said, â€œwait a minute.â€

he  walked  over  behind  the  candy
counter  and  shook  out  one  of  the  quarter
sacks. he filled it up to the brim, bounced
it on the counter a few times, and dropped
in a few more gumdrops.

they  thanked  me  with  their  clear  blue

eyes.

i guess itâ€™s pretty hard for a young boy
to fool his mama. she took one look at me
and  called  me  over.  she  ruffled  up  my
hair,  kissed  me,  and  said,  â€œif  my  little
boyâ€™s eyes get any bigger theyâ€™re going to
pop  right  out  of  his  head.  now  tell  me,
what are you so happy about?â€

before  i  could  say  anything,  papa
chuckled  and  asked,  â€œwhatâ€™s  going  on
between you and your grandpa? what are
you and that old man cooking up now?â€

as  fast  as  i  could  talk  i  started  telling
about  the  big  coon  hunt.  i  told  how  hard
grandpa  had  been  working  to  have  my
dogs  entered,  and  how  he  had  already
paid my entry fee.

catching my breath and looking at papa,
i said, â€œweâ€™re going in his buggy and he
wants you to go.â€

i  waited  in  silence  for  his  reply.  papa

lot of fun and besides the winner receives
a big golden cup.â€

he scratched his head and said, â€œbilly,
iâ€™d sure like to go, but i donâ€™t see how i
can with all this work around here.â€

i  was  beginning  to  think  that  papa
wasnâ€™t  going  to  go.  then  mama  started
talking.

â€œwork?â€  she  said.  â€œwhy,  all  the  work

thing you couldnâ€™t put off for a few days.

i had been so busy with my coon hunting i
hadnâ€™t  noticed  anything  unusual.  mamaâ€™s
tummy was all swelled up. she was going
to have a baby. i felt guilty for not having
noticed.  i  went  over  and  put  my  arms
around her and kissed her.

papa spoke up. â€œitâ€™s sure going to be a

â€œgrandpa  said  there  would  be  hunters
there from everywhere,â€ i said, â€œand some
of the best coon hounds in the country.â€

â€œdo you think you have a chance to win

i  started  to  answer  him  when  the  little

had  candy,  corn  bread,  and  molasses  all
over her face.

i  told  papa  i  didnâ€™t  know  how  good
those dogs were, but there was one thing i
did  know.  if  they  beat  mine,  they  would
have  to  hunt  harder  than  they  ever  had
before.

after i had had my say about the dogs, a
silence  settled  over  the  dining  room.
everyone was looking at papa and waiting
for his answer.

i  saw  a  pleased  smile  spread  over  his
face. he stood up. â€œall right, iâ€™ll go,â€ he
said, â€œand, by golly, weâ€™ll bring that gold
cup back, too.â€

my sisters started clapping their hands

smile spread over my motherâ€™s face.

at  that  moment  iâ€™m  sure  no  boy  in  the
world  could  have  been  happier  than  i.
tears  of  happiness  rolled  down  my
cheeks. mama wiped them away with her
apron.

the  next  few  days  were  busy  ones  for
me.  knowing  that  papa  and  i  would  be
gone  for  several  days,  i  did  everything  i
could
things  convenient  for
mama. i chopped a large pile of wood and
stacked  it  close  to  the  kitchen  door.  to
make it easy for her to feed our stock, i cut
some poles from the hillside and boxed up
one of the stalls in the barn. i filled it full
of hay so she wouldnâ€™t have to climb the
ladder to the loft.

papa  laid  down  the  law  to  my  sisters
about being good and helping mama while
we were gone.

looking  to  the  mountains  around  us,  i
saw that the mysterious artist who comes
at  night  had  paid  us  a  visit.  i  wondered
how  he  could  paint  so  many  different
colors in one night; red, wine, yellow, and
rust.

my dogs were trotting along in front of
us. i smiled at the way their hind quarters
shifted to the right. little ann would jump
and bounce and try to get old dan to play,
but the solemn old boy just jogged along,
heedless of everything.

â€œyou  know,â€  papa  said,  â€œshe  doesnâ€™t
even act like a hound. she is bouncing and
playing  all  the  time.  why,  she  acts  more
like a little pup than a hound.â€

â€œyes, i know,â€ i said. â€œiâ€™ve noticed that
myself,  but  you  know  one  thing,  papa,

sheâ€™s  the  smartest  dog  iâ€™ve  ever  seen.
why,  some  of  the  things  she  does  are
almost unbelievable.â€

â€œyes, i know,â€ said papa, â€œbut still itâ€™s

strange, very strange.â€

â€œthereâ€™s only one thing wrong with her,

papa,â€

i said.

â€œyea, whatâ€™s that?â€ he asked.
â€œyou  wonâ€™t  believe  it,â€  i  said,  â€œbut

sheâ€™s gun-shy.â€

â€œgun-shy?  how  do  you  know  sheâ€™s

gun-shy?â€ papa asked.

â€œi didnâ€™t know for a long time,â€ i said,
â€œuntil  one  day  when  i  was  hoeing  corn
down  in  the  field  by  the  old  slough.  she
and old dan were digging in a bank after
a  ground  hog.  across  the  river  some
fishermen started shooting a gun. it scared
little  ann,  and  she  came  running  to  me,

shaking all over.â€

â€œaw,â€  papa  said,  â€œmaybe  you  just

thought she was scared.â€

â€œno,  i  didnâ€™t,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œit
happened  again  up  at  the

 store  one  day.
grandpa  shot  a  chicken  hawk.  when  the
gun  went  off,  it  scared  her  half  to  death.
no, sheâ€™s gun-shy all right.â€

â€œaw,  well,â€  papa  said,  â€œthat  doesnâ€™t
mean anything. a lot of dogs are afraid of
guns.â€

â€œi  know,â€  i  said,  â€œbut  you  wouldnâ€™t
think she would be that way. i believe if i
had a gun of my own i could break her of
being gun-shy.â€

papa  looked  at  me.  he  said,  â€œfrom
what  your  mother  says,  you  wonâ€™t  be
getting a gun for some time yet.â€

â€œyes, i know,â€ i said.

i  had  never  seen  him  in  such  high
spirits.  he  slapped  papa  on  the  back,
saying, â€œiâ€™m sure glad you could go with
us. itâ€™ll do you good to get out once in a
while.â€

papa laughed and said, â€œit looked like i
had to go or have everyone in the family
mad at me.â€

when we reached the store we saw the

and  get  some  hay  and  make  a  bed  in  the
buggy box for your dogs.â€

â€œaw, grandpa,â€ i said, â€œthey can walk.
they donâ€™t ever get tired; besides, theyâ€™re
used to walking.â€

â€œwalk!â€  grandpa  almost

shouted.
â€œtheyâ€™re not going to walk. no, sir, not if
i can help it. you want them to be footsore
when we get there?â€

papa chuckled and said, â€œwe canâ€™t win
a  gold  cup  with  two  sore-footed  hounds,
can we?â€

â€œof  course  not,â€  grandpa  said.  â€œnow,

you go and get that hay like i said.â€

as i turned to go to the barn i couldnâ€™t
help  but  smile.  it  made  me  feel  good  to
have  my  papa  and  grandpa  so  concerned
about my dogs.

over  a  dim  rocky  road,  in  a  northeasterly
direction, our buggy moved on.

i noticed that the road stayed at the edge
of the foothills, but always in sight of the
river.

about  the  middle  of  the  afternoon  we
stopped  at  a  small  stream  to  water  the
team. papa asked grandpa if he intended
to go all the way to the campground before
stopping.

â€œno,â€ he said, â€œi figure to put up for the
night  when  we  reach  bluebird  creek.
with a good early start in the morning we
can  make  the  campgrounds  in  plenty  of
time to pitch our tent and set up camp.â€

late that evening we reached bluebird
creek.  we  didnâ€™t  set  up  our  tent.  with  a
tarp we made a lean- to and built a large
fire out in front of it.

while  grandpa  fed  and  watered  the

team,  papa  and  i  carried  our  bedding  to
the shelter and made down our beds.

grandpa  said,  â€œwhile  weâ€™re  cooking
supper,  you  see  to  your  dogs.  feed  them
and fix them a warm bed.â€

â€œi figure to cook them some corn-meal
mush,â€ i said. â€œthatâ€™s what theyâ€™re used to
eating.â€

â€œmush!â€  grandpa  growled.  â€œtheyâ€™re
not  going  to  have  mush,  not  if  i  can  help
it.â€

he  walked  over  to  a  grocery  box,

on  another  piece  of  bark.  both  of  them
started eating at the same time.

with  an  astonished  look  on  his  face,

grandpa exclaimed, â€œwell, iâ€™ll be darned.
i  never  saw  anything  like  that.  why,  i
never saw a hound that wouldnâ€™t eat. did
you train them to do that?â€

â€œno,  grandpa,â€

i  said.  â€œtheyâ€™ve
always  been  that  way.  they  wonâ€™t  take
anything  away  from  each  other,  and
everything they do, they do it as one.â€

papa  had  overheard  our  conversation.
he  said,  â€œyou  think  thatâ€™s  strange.  you
should have seen what i saw one day.

â€œone  of  the  girls  threw  two  cold
biscuits out in the back yard to old dan.
he  stood  and  looked  at  them  for  a  bit,
then, picking both of them up in his mouth,
he  trotted  around  the  house.  i  followed
just  to  see  what  he  was  going  to  do.  he
walked  up  in  front  of  the  doghouse,  laid
them down, and growled; not like he was

mad.  it  was  a

  strange  kind  of  a  growl.
little ann  came  out  of  the  doghouse  and
each of them ate a biscuit. now, i saw this
with my own eyes. believe me, those dogs
are close to each otherâ€”real close.â€

after papa had stopped talking, silence

settled over the camp.

grandpa stood staring at my dogs. in a
slow  voice,  as  if  he  were  picking  his
words,  he  said,  â€œyou  know,  iâ€™ve  always
felt like there was something strange about
those  dogs.  i  donâ€™t  know  just  what  it  is,
and i canâ€™t exactly put my finger on it, yet i
can feel it. maybe itâ€™s just my imagination.
i donâ€™t rightly know.â€

turning to my father, he said, â€œdid you
ever notice the way they watch this boy?
they see

papa  said,  â€œyes,  iâ€™ve  noticed  a  lot  of

things they have done. in fact, i could tell
you  of  a  few  that  you  would  never
believe,  but  right  now  hereâ€™s  something
you had better believe. supper is ready.â€

while  i  was  helping  myself  to  hot
dutch-oven corn bread, fried potatoes, and
fresh  side  meat,  grandpa  poured  the
coffee. instead of the two cups i expected
to see, he set out three and filled them to
the brim with the strong black liquid.

coffee  at  home  and  didnâ€™t  exactly  know
what to do. i glanced at papa. he seemed
too  busy  with  his  eating  to  pay  any
attention  to  me.  taking  the  bull  by  the
horns,  i  reached  over  and  ran  my  finger
through the cupâ€™s handle. i held my breath
as i walked over and sat down by a post
oak  stump.  nothing  was  said.  grandpa

and papa paid no attention to what i did.
my head swelled up as big as a number-
four washtub. i thought, â€œiâ€™m not only big
enough  to  help  papa  with  the  farm.  now
iâ€™m big enough to drink coffee.â€

with  supper  over  and

the  dishes
washed,  grandpa  said,  â€œwell,  we  had
better turn in as i want to get an early start
in the morning.â€

long after grandpa and papa had fallen
asleep,  i  lay  thinking  of  the  big  hunt.  my

been  just  one.â€  pointing  to  a  small  red
oak, i said, â€œi think the first time i heard
him, he was over there. the next time, it
was  over  in  that  direction.  maybe  he
changed trees. i sure hope so.â€

grandpa  saw  i  was  bothered.  â€œyou
donâ€™t  believe  that  hogwash  superstition,
do you? bad luck! baw, thereâ€™s nothing to
it.â€

the encouraging words from papa and
grandpa helped some, but there was still
some  doubt.  itâ€™s  hard  for  a  young  boy  to
completely forget things like that.

papa

laughed,  and

said,  â€œthese

man believed it all, heâ€™d go crazy.â€

back in the buggy, we left bluebird creek.
on  that  day  grandpa  drove  a  little
faster  than  he  had  on  the  previous  one.  i

said,

â€œwell,â€  grandpa

â€œthereâ€™s
supposed to be a white flag in the mouth
of black fox. thatâ€™s where we leave the
road. the camp is in the river bottoms.â€

by this time i was so excited, i stood up
in  the  buggy  box  so  i  could  get  a  better
view.

â€œmaybe  you  ought  to  step  them  up  a

when  we  came  in  sight  of  the  camp,  i
couldnâ€™t  believe  what  i  saw.  i  stared  in
amazement.  i  had  never  seen  so  many

people  at  one  gathering.  tents  were
spread  out  over  an  acre  and  a  half  of
ground;  all  colors,  shapes,  and  sizes.
there  were  odd-looking  cars,  buggies,
wagons, and sad

came out in the lead with three big coons
to  their  credit.  the  other  four  sets  were
eliminated.

the  following  morning  all  five  sets  of
dogs were eliminated. none had even tied
the blue ticks, although two sets had gotten
two  coons,  and  one  of  these  had  treed  a
third one in a bluff.

that  day,  while  eating  dinner,  my
grandfather asked me if my dogs had ever
treed three coons in one night.

i  said,  â€œyes,  four  different  times,  but

our night?â€ papa asked.

i told him if we could get our judge to
go  with  us  in  the  buggy,  we  would  be
better  off  if  we  could  go  far  downriver
and get out of the range where other dogs
had hunted.

he said, â€œthatâ€™s a good idea. iâ€™ll go to

he snorted and said he thought a hunter

always whooped to his dogs.

â€œi do, grandpa,â€ i said, â€œbut not before

they strike a trail.â€

we walked on. every now and then we
would  stop  and  listen.  i  could  hear  the
loud snuffing of old dan. once we caught
a  glimpse  of  little  ann  as  she  darted
across  an  opening  that  was  bathed  in
moonlight.  she  was  as  silent  as  a  ghost
and as quick as a flitting shadow.

papa  said,  â€œit  sure  is  a  beautiful  night

for hunting.â€

the  judge  said,  â€œyou  canâ€™t  beat  these
ozark mountain nights for beauty. i donâ€™t
care where you go.â€

grandpa  started  to  say  something.  his
voice  was  drowned  out  by  the  bell-like
cry of little ann.

in  a  whisper,  i  said,  â€œcome  on,  dan.

as if in answer to my words, his deep
voice  hammered  its  way  up  through  the

my veins.

i  could  tell  by  the  dogsâ€™  voices  that  they
were  running  side  by  side,  and  were  hot

almost see them running, bodies stretched
to  their  fullest  length,  legs  pounding  up
and down, white steam rolling from their
hot breath in the frosty night.

upstream.  soon  my  dogs  were  out  of

stay  on  our  side  of  the  river  and  keep
going until we could hear them again.

twenty  minutes  later  we  heard  them

coming back. we stopped.

â€œi  think  they  have  crossed  back  to  our

side,â€ i said.

all at once the voices of my dogs were

â€œwhat in the world was that?â€ grandpa

said.

â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ the judge said. â€œreckon

it was wind or thunder?â€

about that time we heard it again.
the  judge  started  laughing.  â€œi  know
now  what  it  is,â€  he  said.  â€œthose  hounds
have run that coon right back by our camp.
the noise we heard was the other hunters
whooping to them.â€

everyone laughed.
a  few  minutes  later  i  heard  my  dogs
bawling treed. on reaching the tree, papa
ran  his  hand  back  under  his  coat.  he
pulled out grandpaâ€™s gun.

â€œthatâ€™s a funny-looking gun,â€ the judge

said. â€œitâ€™s a 410-gauge pistol, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œitâ€™s  the  very  thing  for  this  kind  of
work,â€  papa  said.  â€œyou  couldnâ€™t  kill  a
coon  with  it  if  you  tried,  especially  if
youâ€™re  using  bird  shot.  all  it  will  do  is
sting his hide a little.â€

at the crack of the gun, the coon gave a
loud squall and jumped. my dogs lost no

grandpa  very  gingerly  started  picking
his  way.  his  tender  old  feet  moved  from
one  smooth  rock  to  another.  everything
was  fine  until  we  reached  midstream,
where  the  current  was  much  swifter.  he
stepped  on  a  loose  round  rock.  it  rolled
and down he went.

as  the  cold  river  water  touched  his
body, he let out a yell that could have been
heard  for  miles.  he  looked  so  funny  we
couldnâ€™t keep from laughing.

papa  and  the  judge  helped  him  to  his
feet.  laughing  every  step  of  the  way,  we
finally  reached  the  other  side.  grandpa
kept  going  in  his  wet  clothes  until  we
reached the tree where the dogs were.

after killing the coon, we built a large

heâ€™d  get  up  as  close  to  the  fire  as  he
could,  and  turn  this  way  and  that.  he

he  looked  over  at  me  and  snapped,

â€œwhatâ€™s so funny?â€
i said, â€œnothing.â€
â€œwell, why are you laughing?â€ he said.
at  this  remark,  papa  and  the  judge

laughed until their eyes watered.

mumbling  and  grumbling,  grandpa
said, â€œif you fellows were as cold as i am,
you wouldnâ€™t be laughing.â€

we knew we shouldnâ€™t be laughing, but

we couldnâ€™t help ourselves.

the  judge  looked  at  his  watch.  â€œitâ€™s
after  three  oâ€™clock,â€  he  said.  â€œdo  you

think theyâ€™ll tree another one?â€

realized we had forgotten the coonskins. i

now  and  then,  leaping  over  old  logs,
tearing  through  the  underbrush,  sniffing
and  searching  for  the  lost  trail.  my  heart
swelled  with  pride.  i  whooped,  urging

them on.

in a low voice, the judge said, â€œiâ€™ll say

one thing. they donâ€™t give up easily.â€

birds began to chirp all around us. the
sky  took  on  a  light  gray  color.  tiny  dim
stars were blinking the night away.

â€œit  looks  like  weâ€™re  beat,â€  papa  said.

â€œitâ€™s getting daylight.â€

at that moment, the loud clear voice of
a  redbone  hound,  bawling  treed,  rang
through the river bottoms. it was the voice
of little ann.

sucking in a mouthful of air, i held it. i
could  feel  my  heart  pounding  against  my
ribs. i closed my eyes tight and gritted my
teeth to keep the tears from coming.
â€œletâ€™s go to them,â€ grandpa said.
â€œno, wait a minute,â€ i said.

hoping you win it, but itâ€™s not going to be
easy. youâ€™re going up against four of the
finest  hounds  there  are.â€  turning  to  my
father, he said, â€œdid you know the two big
walker hounds have won four gold cups?â€
very seriously, papa said, â€œyou know i
have two mules down on my place. one is
almost  as  big  as  a  barn.  the  other  one
isnâ€™t  much  bigger  than  a  jack  rabbit,  but
that  little  mule  can  outpull  the  big  one
every time.â€

smiling, the hunter turned to leave. he

said, â€œyou could be right.â€

papa  asked  me  again  where  i  thought

we should start hunting.

i had been thinking about this all day. i
said,  â€œyou  remember  where  we  jumped
the last coon in the swamp?â€

papa said, â€œye

s.â€
â€œwell, the way i figure, more than one
coon lives in that swamp,â€ i said. â€œitâ€™s a
good  place  for  them  as  there  are  lots  of
crawfish  and  minnows  in  those  potholes.
if a hound jumps one there, he has a good
chance to tree him.â€

papa asked, â€œwhy?â€
â€œitâ€™s a long way back to the river, and
about the same distance to the mountains,â€
i said. â€œeither way he runs, a dog can get
pretty close to him, and so he would have
to take to a tree.â€

with this thing.â€

under my breath, i said, â€œi do, too.â€
after untying the ropes from my dogs, i
held  onto  their  collars  for  a  minute.
pulling  them  up  close,  i  knelt  down  and
whispered, â€œthis is the last night. i know
youâ€™ll do your best.â€

they  seemed  to  understand  and  tugged
at their collars. when i turned them loose,
they  started  for  the  timber.  just  as  they
reached  the  dark  shadows,  they  stopped,
turned  around,  and  stared  straight  at  me
for an instant.

e  judge  saw  their  strange  actions.
laying  a  hand  on  my  shoulder,  he  asked,
â€œwhat did they say, son?â€

i  said,  â€œnothing  that  anyone  could
understand,  but  i  can  feel  that  they  know
this hunt is important. they know it just as
well as you or i.â€

it  was  little  ann  who  found  the  trail.
before the echo of her sharp cry had died
away, old danâ€™s deep voice floated out of
the swamp.

â€œwell, letâ€™s go,â€ papa said eagerly.
â€œno, letâ€™s wait a minute,â€ i said.
â€œwait? why?â€ grandpa asked.
â€œto see which way heâ€™s going to run,â€ i

said.

the  coon  broke  out  of  the  swamp  and
headed for the river. listening to my dogs,
i could tell they were close to him. i said

to papa, â€œi donâ€™t think heâ€™ll ever make it
to  the  river.  theyâ€™re  right  on  his  heels
now.â€

by the time we had circled the swamp,

they were bawling treed.

the judge said, â€œboy, that was fast.â€
i felt my

fatherâ€™s hand on my shoulder.
looking at me, he smiled and nodded his
head.  papa  and  i  knew  i  had  judged  the
coon  perfectly.  he  didnâ€™t  have  time  to
reach the river or the mountains.

my dogs had treed the coon in a tall ash
which  stood  about  fifty  yards  from  the
river. i knew the fifty yards had saved us a
good hour, because he could have pulled
trick  after  trick  if  he  had  gotten  in  the
water.

we  spied  the  coon  in  the  topmost
branches. at  the  crack  of  the  gun,  he  ran

far out on a limb and jumped. he landed
in  an  old  fallen  tr

he  ran  for  the  river.  the  tangled  mass  of
limbs  slowed  my  dogs  and  they  all  but
tore the treetop apart getting out of it. the
coon  was  just  one  step  ahead  of  them  as
they reached the river. we heard them hit
the water.

running  over,  we  stood  and  watched
the  fight.  the  coon  was  at  home  in  the
river. he crawled up on old danâ€™s head,
trying to force him under. before he could
do  it,  little  ann  reached  up  and  pulled
him off.

in  a  scared  voice,  papa  said,  â€œthat

water looks deep to me.â€

â€œmaybe  you  had  better  call  them  off,â€
said the judge. â€œthatâ€™s a big coon and he

could  drown  one  of  them  easily  in  that
deep water.â€

â€œcall  them  off?â€  i  said.  â€œwhy,  you
couldnâ€™t  whip  them  off  with  a  stick.
thereâ€™s  no  use  for  anyone  to  get  scared.
they  know  exactly  what  theyâ€™re  doing.
iâ€™ve seen this more times than one.â€

grandpa  was  scared  and  excited.  he

papa raised the gun to aim.
i  jumped  and  grabbed  his  arm.  â€œdonâ€™t
do that,â€ i yelled. â€œyouâ€™re sure to hit one
of my dogs.â€

round and round in the deep water the
fight  went  on.  the  coon  climbed  on  old
danâ€™s head and sank his teeth in one of his
long  tender  ears.  old  dan  bawled  with
pain. little ann swam in and caught one of

the  coonâ€™s  hind  legs  in  her  mouth.  she
tried  hard  to  pull  him  off.  all  three
disappeared under the water.

â€œshe  always  does  that,â€  i  said.  â€œif
youâ€™ll  watch,  when  she  gets  done  with
him, heâ€™ll do the same for her.â€

we  stood  and  watched  until  they  had
finished  doctoring  each  other.  then,
trotting  side  by  side,  they  disappeared  in
the darkness.

we  followed  along,  stopping  now  and

looking  up  the  sky,  papa  said,  â€œthat  doesnâ€™t
look good up there. i think we are in for a
storm.â€

the  sky  had  turned  a  dark  gray.  fast-
moving  clouds  were  rolling  through  the
heavens.

grandpa said, â€œlooks like weâ€™re going

to get some wind, too.â€

scared  and  thinking  everyone  might
want  to  stop  hunting  because  of  a  few
clouds, i said, â€œif a storm is brewing, itâ€™s
a  good  night  to  hunt.  all  game  stirs  just
before a storm.â€

grandpa  said,  â€œi  was  afraid  of  that.

from far downriver, we heard the deep
baying  of  a  hound  on  a  trail.  it  was  old
dan. seconds later, the rhythmic crying of
little ann could be heard. swallowing the
lump  that  had  jumped  up  in  my  throat,  i
whooped as loud as i could.

the  ground  was  turning  white  with
sleet.  the  storm  had  really  set  in.  we

at this remark, i cried, â€œiâ€™ve been out in

â€œthatâ€™s what has me worried,â€ i cried.
â€œthey  wonâ€™t  come  in.  they  wonâ€™t,  papa.
little ann  might,  but  not  old  dan.  heâ€™d
die before heâ€™d leave a coon in a tree.â€

papa  was  undecided.  making  up  his
mind,  he  stepped  away  from  the  tree  and
said to the others, â€œiâ€™m going on with him.
you fellows coming, or going back?â€

he  turned  and  followed  me.  grandpa

and the judge fell in behind him.

by  this  time  the  ground  was  covered
with  a  thin  white  layer  of  sleet.  we  kept

of pricking needles. strong gusts of

growled  and  moaned  through  the  tops  of
the tall timber.

once  during  a  momentary  lull  of  the
storm,  i  thought  i  heard  the  baying  of  a
hound.  i  told  my  father  i  thought  i  had
heard old dan.

we trudged on. old dan bawled again.

the  sound  of  his  voice  seemed  to  be  all
around us.

â€œthe  way  that  wind  is  whipping  the
sound through this timber,â€ the judge said,
â€œweâ€™d be lucky if we ever found them.â€

papa shouted over the roar of the wind,
â€œwe  canâ€™t  take  much  more  of  this.  weâ€™ll
freeze to death.â€

the men were giving up. i felt the knot
again  as  it  crawled  up  in  my  throat.  salt
water  froze  on  my  eyelashes.  kneeling
down, i put my ear close to the icy ground
in  hopes  i  could  hear  my  dogs,  but  i
couldnâ€™t  hear  anything  above  the  roar  of
the blizzard.

standing up, i peered this way and that.
all  i  could  see  was  a  white  wall  of
whirling sleet. i cl

osed my eyes and said a
silent prayer and hoped for a miracle.

we  heard  a  sharp  crack  and  a  loud
crashing noise. a large limb, torn from a
tree by the strong wind, fell to the ground.
the  sharp  crack  of  the  limb  gave  me  the
idea. shouting to my father, i said, â€œshoot
the  gun.  if  my  dogs  are  close  enough  to
hear it, maybe little ann will come to us.â€
papa  didnâ€™t  hesitate.  pointing  the  gun
high  over  his  head,  he  pulled  the  trigger.
the sharp crack rang out into the teeth of
the storm.

we waited.
just  when  i  had  given  up  all  hope  and
had  sunk  to  the  lowest  depth  of  despair,
out of the white wall of driving sleet, my
little  dog  came  to  me.  i  knelt  down  and
gathered her in my arms.

taking  one  of  the  lead  ropes  from  my
pocket, i tied it to her collar. i said, â€œfind

,  she  led  us
into  a  thick  canebrake.  the  tall  stalks
sheltered us from the storm. the roaring of
the wind didnâ€™t seem as loud. like ghostly
figures,  large  trees  loomed  out  of  the
almost solid mass. falling and stumbling,
we kept pushing on.

grandpa  shouted,  â€œhold  up  a  minute.

iâ€™m just about all in.â€

we stopped.
â€œdo  you  think  that  hound  knows  what
sheâ€™s  doing?â€  the  judge  asked.  â€œmaybe
weâ€™re just running around in circles.â€

looking  at  me,  papa  said,  â€œi  hope  she
does.  some  of  these  canebrakes  cover
miles.  if  we  get  lost  in  here,  weâ€™ll  be  in
bad shape.â€

the  judge  spoke  up,  â€œfellows,  no  dog
is worth the lives of three men. now letâ€™s
do  the  smart  thing  and  get  out  of  here
while we can. our clothes are wet. if we
keep  on  wandering  around  in  this  jungle,

grandpa said, â€œi think weâ€™ve gone too
far.  the  last  time  i  heard  old  dan,  he
sounded quite close.â€

â€œthat was because the

ck  was  covered  with  a  layer  of
frozen  sleet.  his  frost-covered  whiskers
stood out straight as porcupine quills.

i  worked  the  wedges  of  ice  from
between  his  toes,  and  scraped  the  sleet
from  his  body  with  my  hands.  little ann
came over and tried to wash his face. he
didnâ€™t  like  it.  jerking  loose  from  me,  he
ran  over  to  the  tree,  reared  up  on  it,  and
started bawling.

hearing  shouting  from  the  bank  above
me,  i  looked  up.  i  could  dimly  see  papa
and the judge through the driving sleet. at
first  i  thought  they  were  shouting  to  me,
but on peering closer i could see that they

had  their  backs  to  me.  catching  hold  of
some long stalks of cane that were hanging
down from the steep bank, i pulled myself
up.

papa shouted in my ear, â€œsomething has

happened to your grandfather.â€

turning to the judge, he said, â€œhe was
behind  you.  when  was  the  last  time  you
saw him?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know for sure,â€ the judge said.

â€œi guess it was back there when we heard

â€œhow  could  i  hear  anything  in  all  that
noise? i thought he was behind me all the
time,  and  didnâ€™t  miss  him  until  we  got
here.â€

i  tried  to  tear  away  from  him  but  his

grip on my arm was firm.

i  couldnâ€™t  hold  back  the  tears.  my
grandfather was lost and wandering in that
white jungle of cane. screaming for him, i
started back.

papa caught me. he shouted, â€œdonâ€™t do

little ann came up out of the washout.
she  stood  and  stared  at  me.  turning,  she
disappeared  quickly  in  the  thick  cane.
minutes later we heard her. it was a long,
mournful cry.

the  only  times  i  had  ever  heard  my
little  dog  bawl  like  that  were  when  she
was  baying  at  a  bright  ozark  moon,  or

when someone played a french harp or a
fiddle  close  to  her  ear.  she  didnâ€™t  stop
until we reached her.

searing  pain  must  have  made  him
unconscious.

i asked papa if we could get him back
to  the  gully  where  old  dan  was.  i  had
noticed  there  was  very  little  wind  there
and we could build a fire.

â€œthatâ€™s the very place,â€ he said. â€œweâ€™ll
build a good fire and one of us can go for

papa  and  the  judge  made  a  seat  by
catching  each  otherâ€™s  wrists.  they  eased
grandpa between them.

by  the  time  we  reached  the  washout,
grandpa  was  fully  conscious  again,  and

see why they had to carry him like a baby.
after  easing  him  over  the  bank  and
down into the gully, we built a large fire.

look  at  it  for  the  first  time.  my  dogs,
seeing we were finally going to pay some
attention  to  them,  started  bawling  and
running around the tree.

â€œit must be hollow.â€

what we came for, isnâ€™t it?â€

up  until  then,  the  coon-hunting  had

practically been forgotten.

papa  beat  on  its  side  with  the  ax.  it
gave forth a loud booming sound. he said,
â€œitâ€™s hollow all right.â€

he  stepped  back  a  few  steps,  scraped
his  feet  on  the  slick  ground  for  a  good

those hounds. iâ€™m going to cut it down. we
need some wood for our fire anyway.â€

squatting  down  between  my  dogs,  i

held onto their collars.

papa  notched  the  old  snag  so  it  would
fall  away  from  our  fire. as  the  heavy  a

chewed  its  way  into  the  tree,  it  began  to
lean  and  crack.  papa  stopped  chopping.
he said to the judge, â€œcome on and help
me. i think we can push it over now.â€

after  much  grunting  and  pushing,

snapping and popping, it fell.

i turned my dogs loose.
on hitting the ground, the snag split and
broke  up.  goggle-eyed,  i  stood  rooted  in
my  tracks  and  watched  three  big  coons
roll out of the busted old trunk.

one  started  up  the  washout,  running

between  us  and  the  fire.  old  dan  caught
him and the fight was on. the second coon
he

caught him.

hearing  a  loud  yell  from  grandpa,  i
looked  that  way.  old  dan  and  the  coon
were  fighting  close  to  his  feet.  he  was
yelling  and  beating  at  them  with  his  hat.
the judge and papa ran to help.

the  third  coon  started  climbing  up  the
steep  bank  close  to  me.  just  before
reaching the top, his claws slipped in the
icy mud. tumbling end over end, down he
came. i grabbed up a stick and threw it at
him.  growling  and  showing  his  teeth,  he
started for me. i threw the fight to him then

i  turned.  the  coon  was  really
working her over. he had climbed up on
her  back  and  was  tearing  and  slashing.
she  couldnâ€™t  shake  him  off.  grabbing  a
club from the ground, i ran to help her.

before  we  had  killed  our  coon,  old
dan  came  tearing  in.  we  stood  and
watched  the  fight.  when  the  coon  was
dead,  papa  picked  it  up  and  we  walked
back to the fire.

â€œi saw three,â€ i said. â€œthe one that got
away climbed out over there.â€ i pointed in
the direction the coon had taken.

i  never  should  have  pointed.  my  dogs
turned  as  one,  and  started  bawling  and

clawing  their  way  up  the  steep  bank.  i
shouted and scolded, but to no avail. they
disappeared in the rattling cane.

we stood still, listening to their voices.
the sound died away in the roaring storm.
sitting down close to the fire, i buried my
face in my arms and c

i heard the judge say to my father, â€œthis
beats  anything  i  have  ever  seen.  why,
those  dogs  can  read  that  boyâ€™s  mind.  he
just  pointed  at  that  bank  and  away  they
went. i never saw anything like it. i canâ€™t
understand  some  of  the  things  they  have
done  tonight.  hounds  usually  arenâ€™t  that
smart. if they were collies, or some other
breed  of  dog,  it  would  be  different,  but
theyâ€™re

papa  said,  â€œyes,  i  know  what  you

mean.  iâ€™ve  seen  them  do  things  that  i
couldnâ€™t  understand.  iâ€™d  never  heard  of
hounds  that  ever  had  any  affection  for
anyone,  but  these  dogs  are  different.  did
you know they wonâ€™t hunt with anyone but
him, not even me?â€

hearing my grandfather call my name, i
went  over  and  sat  down  by  his  side.
putting his arm around me, he said, â€œnow,
i  wouldnâ€™t  worry  about
those  dogs.
theyâ€™ll  be  all  right.  itâ€™s  not

i  said,  â€œyes,  but  what  if  the  coon
crosses  the  river?  my  dogs  will  follow
him.  if  they  get  wet  they  could  freeze  to
death.â€

â€œweâ€™ll  just  have  to  wait  and  hope  for
the best,â€ he said. â€œnow straighten up and
quit that sniffling. act like a coon hunter.

you  donâ€™t  see  me  bawling,  and  this  old
foot is paining me something awful.â€

i felt better after my talk with grandpa.
â€œcome on, letâ€™s skin these coons,â€ papa

said.

i got up to help him.
after  the  skins  were  peeled  from  the
carcasses,  i  had  an  idea.  holding  one  up
close to the fire until it was warm, i took
it over and wrapped it around grandpaâ€™s
foot.  chuckling,  he  said,  â€œboy,  that  feels
good. heat another skin the same way.â€

i kept it up for the rest of the night.

  in  the  thick  timber  of  the  river
bottoms,  the  sharp  snapping  of  frozen
limbs  could  be  heard.  the  tall  stalks  of
wild  cane  looked  exhausted  from  the
hellish  night.  they  were  drooping  and
bending  from  the  weight  of  the  frozen
sleet.

i  climbed  out  of  the  deep  gully  and
listened for my dogs. i couldnâ€™t hear them.
just  as  i  started  back  down  the  bank,  i
heard something. i listened. again i heard

the sound.

papa was watching me. â€œcan you hear

the dogs?â€ he asked.

â€œno,  not  the  dogs,â€  i  said,  â€œbut  i  can

hear something else.â€

â€œwhat does it sound like?â€ he asked.
â€œlike someone whooping,â€ i said.
papa and the judge hurried up the bank.
we heard the sound again. it was coming
from a different direction.

â€œthe  first  time  i  heard  it,â€  i  said,  â€œit

was over that way.â€

â€œitâ€™s  the  men  from  camp,â€  the  judge

said. â€œtheyâ€™re searching for us.â€

answered.  their  voices  came  from  all
directions.  the  first  one  to  reach  us  was
mr.  kyle.  he  looked  haggard  and  tired.
he asked if everything was all right.

â€œyes, weâ€™re all right,â€ papa said, â€œbut
the old man has a bad ankle. it looks like
weâ€™ll have to carry him out.â€

â€œyour team broke loose and came back
to  camp  about  midnight,â€  mr.  kyle  said.
â€œthis  really  spooked  us.  we  were  sure
something bad had happened. twenty-five
of us have been searching since then.â€

â€œyes,â€  another  said,  â€œand  if  i  know

back in the crowd, i heard another man
say, â€œyou mean that lathman fellow, who
owns  those  black  and  tan  hounds,  is  a
doctor?â€

â€œsure  is,â€  another  said.  â€œone  of  the

mr. kyle asked where my dogs were. i
told him that they were treed somewhere.

papa explained what had happened.
with a wide-eyed look on his face, he
said,  â€œdo  you  mean  to  tell  me  those

i nodded.
looking  at  me,  he  said,  â€œson,  i  hope

the deep voice growled again. â€œi still
think it was a hell of a thing for a man to
do.â€

mr.  kyle  took  over.  â€œnow  letâ€™s  not
have any more of this,â€ he said. â€œwe have
work  to  do.  weâ€™ve  been  standing  here
acting like a bunch of schoolkids. all this
time  that  old  man  has  been  lying  there
suffering.  a  couple  of  you  men  cut  two
poles and make a stretcher to carry him.â€

while  the  men  were  getting  the  poles,
papa  heated  the  coonskins  again  and
rewrapped grandpaâ€™s foot.

more do you want me to do?â€

with  belts  and  long  leather  laces  from
their  boots,  the  hunters  made  a  stretcher.
very gently they put grandpa on it.

again mr. kyle took command. â€œpart of
us will start for camp with him,â€ he said.

looking  at  me,  mr.  kyle  said,  â€œcome

mr.  benson  led  the  way.  â€œas  soon  as

asked.

â€œthe others will go after the dogs.â€

i  figured  i  knew  why  my  dogs  were
covered with ice. the coon had probably
crossed  the  river,  maybe  several  times.

followed  him.  they  had  come  out  of  the
river  with  their  coats  dripping  wet,  and

pain.

little ann was trying hard to get ahold
of  the  coon  but  she  couldnâ€™t.  because  of
his  fast  circling,  old  danâ€™s  feet  flew  out
from  under  him  and  he  fell.  this  gave
little ann a chance. darting in, her jaws
closed  on  the  back  of  the  coonâ€™s  neck.  i
knew the fight was over.

arriving back at camp, i saw that all the
tents  had  been  taken  down  but  ours.  a
hunter  said,  â€œeveryone  was  in  a  hurry  to
get out before another blizzard sets in.â€

papa  told  me  to  take  my  dogs  into  the

tent as grandpa wanted to see them.

i saw tears in my grandfatherâ€™s eyes as
he talked to them. his ankle was wrapped
in  bandages.  his  foot  and  toes  were
swollen  to  twice  their  normal  size.  they
had
turned  a  greenish-yellow  color.
placing my hand on his foot, i could feel
the feverish heat.

dr. lathman came over. â€œare you ready

to go now?â€ he asked.

snorting and growling, grandpa said, â€œi
told you i wasnâ€™t going anywhere till

â€œif you donâ€™t mind, iâ€™ll take it with me. my

grandfather can send it in for me.â€

i went over and kissed grandpa good-

laughing,  he  said,  â€œthatâ€™s  all  right.â€
handing me a slip of paper, he said, â€œthis
is the address where you should send it.â€
grandpa said, â€œnow that thatâ€™s settled,
iâ€™m ready to go to town.â€ turning to papa,
he said, â€œyouâ€™ll have to bring the buggy,
and  i  wish  youâ€™d  look  after  my  stock.  i
know grandma will want to go in with us
and thereâ€™ll be no one there to feed them.

â€œwell  take  care  of  everything,â€  papa
said.  â€œdonâ€™t  worry  about  a  thing.  i  donâ€™t
intend to stop until we get back, because it
looks  like  weâ€™re  in  for  some  more  bad
weather.â€

grandpa  was  carried  out  and  made
comfortable  in  the  back  seat  of  dr.
lathmanâ€™s  car.  i  stood  and  watched  as  it
wheezed and bounced its way out of sight.
â€œwhile iâ€™m harnessing the team,â€ papa
said, â€œyou take the tent down and pack our
gear.â€

on the back seat of the buggy, i made a
bed  out  of  our  bed-clothes.  down  on  the
floor  boards,  i  fixed  a  nice  place  for  my
dogs.

all  through  the  night,  the  creaking
wheels  of  our  buggy  moved  on.  several
times i woke up. my father had wrapped a

could feel my dogs. they were warm and
comfortable.

breakfast. while papa tended to the t

home long before dark.â€

reaching grandpaâ€™s store in the middle
of  the  afternoon,  papa  said,  â€œiâ€™ll  put  the
team in the barn and feed the stock while
you unload the buggy.â€

coming back from the barn, he said, â€œin
the  morning,  iâ€™ll  go  over  and  tell  bill

looking  around,  he  said,  â€œit  snowed

feeling  big  and  important,  i  said,  â€œi

two  hundred  yards  this  side  of  our
home, the road made a turn around a low
foothill shutting our house off from view.
papa  said,  â€œyouâ€™re  going  to  see  a

it  was  more  of  a  stampede  than  a
scramble.  the  little  one  came  out  first,
and  all  but  tore  the  screen  door  from  its
hinges.  the  older  girls  passed  her  just

the  awed  expression  on  my  motherâ€™s
face was wonderful to see. holding a cup
in each hand, she held them out in front of
her.

â€œtwo,â€  she  said.  â€œa  gold  one  and  a
silver  one.  who  would  have  thought
anything
could  have
happened  to  us.  iâ€™m  so  proud;  so  very
proud.â€

so  wonderful

handing the cups back to the girls, she
walked  over  to  papa.  after  kissing  him,
she  said,  â€œi  just  canâ€™t  believe  everything
that  has  happened.  iâ€™m  so  glad  you  went
along. did you enjoy yourself?â€

with  a  smile  on  his  face,  papa  almost
shouted, â€œenjoy myself? why, i never had
such a time in my life.â€

his  voice  trailed  off  to  a  low  calm,

â€œthat  is,  except  for  one  thing.  grandpa
had a bad accident.â€

â€œyes,  i  know,â€  mama  said.  â€œone  of
tom loganâ€™s boys was at the store when
they  arrived.  he

about it. the doctor said it wasnâ€™t as bad

grandpa would be home in a few days.â€

i  was  happy  to  hear  this  news,  and
could  tell  by  the  pleased  look  on  my
fatherâ€™s face, he was glad to hear it, too.

on entering the house, papa said, â€œoh, i
almost  forgot.â€  he  handed  the  box  of
money to mama.

â€œwhatâ€™s this?â€ she asked.
â€œoh, itâ€™s just a little gift from old dan

and little ann,â€ papa said.

mama opened the box. i saw the color
drain  from  her  face.  her  hands  started

trembling.  turning  her  back  to  us,  she
walked  over  and  set  it  on  the  mantel. a
peaceful  silence  settled  over  the  room.  i
could  hear  the  clock  ticking  away.  the
fire in the fireplace crackled and popped.
turning from the mantel, mama looked
straight  at  us.  her  lips  were  tightly
pressed
them  from
quivering.  walking  slowly  to  papa,  she
buried  her  face  in  his  chest.

to  keep

together

there  was  a  celebration  in  our  home
that  night.  to  me  it  was  like  a  second
christmas.

mama  opened  a  jar  of  huckleberries
and  made  a  large  cobbler.  papa  went  to
the  smokehouse  and  came  back  with  a
hickory-cured ham. we sat down to a feast

of the ham, huge plates of fried potatoes,
ham  gravy,  hot  corn  bread,  fresh  butter,
and wild bee honey.

during the course of the meal, the entire
story  of  the  championship  hunt  was  told,
some by papa but mostly by me.

just  when  everything  was  so  perfect
and  peaceful,  an  argument  sprang  up
between  the  two  oldest  girls.  it  seemed
that  each  wanted  to  claim  the  silver

 cup.
just  when  they  were  on  the  verge  of
sawing it in two, so each would have her
allotted  share,  papa  settled  the  squabble
by  giving  the  oldest  one  a  silver  dollar.
once  again  peace  and  harmony  was
restored.

that night as i was preparing for bed, a
light  flashed  by  my  window.  puzzled,  i
tiptoed over and peeked through the pane.

it was mama. carrying my lantern and two
large  plates  heaped  high  with  food,  she
was heading for the doghouse. setting the
light down on the ground in front of it, she
called to my dogs. while they were eating,

after  they  had  eaten  their  food,  mama
started petting them. i could hear her voice
but  couldnâ€™t  make  out  her  words.
whatever  she  was  saying  must  have
pleased  them.  little  ann  wiggled  and
twisted.  even  old  dan  wagged  his  long
red tail, which was very unusual.

papa  came  out.  i  saw  him  put  his  arm
around mama. side by side they stood for
several minutes looking at my dogs. when
they turned to enter the house, i saw mama

lying in bed, staring into the darkness, i
tried hard to figure out the strange actions
of  my  parents.  why  had  mama  knelt  in

glancing at old dan, papa said, â€œitâ€™s in

there was a moaning sigh from mama.
she covered her face with her hands and
started crying.

â€œi  donâ€™t  know,â€  she  sobbed,  â€œi  just
donâ€™t know. to think how close you came
to  being  killed.  i  donâ€™t  think  i  can  stand
any more.â€

â€œnow, now,â€ papa said, as he walked
over and put his arms around her. â€œdonâ€™t
go  all  to  pieces.  itâ€™s  all  over.  letâ€™s  be
thankful and do our best for old dan.â€

â€œdo you think heâ€™ll die, papa?â€ i asked.
â€œi  donâ€™t  know,  billy,â€  papa  said,
shaking his head. â€œheâ€™s lost an awful lot
of blood and heâ€™s a mighty sick dog. all

breathing grew faster and faster, and there
was a terrible rattling in his throat. i knelt

i  looked  to  mama  for  help.  her  face
was  as  white  as  the  bark  on  a  sycamore
tree  and  the  hurt  in  her  eyes  tore  at  my
heart.  she  opened  her  mouth  to  say
something but words wouldnâ€™t come out.

feeling as cold as an arctic wind, i got

up  and  stumbled  to  a  chair.  mama  came
over and said something. her words were
only a murmur in my ears.

very gently papa picked old dan up in
his arms and carried him out on the porch.
when he came back in the house, he said,
â€œwell, we did all we could do, but i guess
it wasnâ€™t enough.â€

at that moment. i knew she was all right.

i  had  never  seen  my  father  and  mother
look so tired and weary as they did on that
night. i knew they wanted to comfort me,
but didnâ€™t know what to say.

papa tried. â€œbilly,â€ he said, â€œi wouldnâ€™t

said, â€œbut how can i forget old dan? he
gave his life for me, thatâ€™s what he didâ€”
just laid down his life for me. how can i
ever forget something like that?â€

mama  said,  â€œitâ€™s  been  a  terrible  night
for all of us. letâ€™s go to bed and try to get
some  rest.  maybe  weâ€™ll  all  feel  better
tomorrow.â€

â€œno, mama,â€ i said. â€œyou and papa go
on to bed. i think iâ€™ll stay up for a while. i
couldnâ€™t sleep anyway.â€

mama started to protest, but papa shook
his head. arm in arm they walked from the
room.

long  after  my  mother  and  father  had
retired, i sat by the fire trying to think and
couldnâ€™t. i felt numb all over. i knew my
dog was dead, but i couldnâ€™t believe it. i

didnâ€™t  want  to.  one  day  they  were  both
alive and happy. then that night, just like
that, one of them was dead.

on, down through our
fields  of  shocked  corn,  until  i  fell  face
down  on  the  riverâ€™s  bank.  there  in  the
gray shadows of a breaking dawn, i cried
until i could cry no more.

the  churring  of  gray  squirrels  in  the
bright morning sun told me it was daylight.
i  got  to  my  feet  and  walked  back  to  the
house.

coming  up  through  our  barn  lot,  i  saw
my father feeding our stock. he came over
and said, â€œbreakfast is about ready.â€

â€œi  donâ€™t  want  any  breakfast,  papa,â€  i
said. â€œiâ€™m not hungry and i have a job to
do. iâ€™ll have to bury my dog.â€

â€œi  tell  you  what,â€  he  said,  â€œiâ€™m  not
going to be very busy today, so letâ€™s have
a good breakfast and then iâ€™ll help you.â€

â€œno, papa,â€ i said. â€œiâ€™ll take care of it.
you go and eat breakfast. tell mama iâ€™m
not hungry.â€

i  saw  a  hurt  look  in  my  fatherâ€™s  eyes.
shaking  his  head,  he  turned  and  walked
away.

from rough pine slabs, i made a box for
my dog. it was

mama said. â€œyour sisters would go all to
pieces. letâ€™s make her comfortable here.â€
raking  some  dead  leaves  into  a  pile,
she  picked  little ann  up  and  laid  her  in
them. taking off my coat, i spread it over
her body. i dreaded to think of what i had

to do on the morrow.

my father and sisters were waiting for
us on the porch. mama told them the sad
story. my sisters broke down and started
crying. they ran to mama and buried their
faces in her long cotton dress.

papa  came  over  and  laid  his  hand  on
my  shoulder.  â€œbilly,â€  he  said,  â€œthere  are
times in a boyâ€™s life when he has to stand
up like a man. this is one of those times. i
know what youâ€™re going through and how
it hurts, but thereâ€™s always an answer. the
good lord has a reason for everything he
does.â€

â€œthere  couldnâ€™t  be  any  reason  for  my
dogs  to  die,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œthere  just
couldnâ€™t.  they  hadnâ€™t  done  anything
wrong.â€

papa glanced at mama. gett

from  her,  he  said,  â€œitâ€™s  getting  cold  out
here.  letâ€™s  go  in  the  house.  i  have
something to show you.â€

â€œguess what weâ€™re having for supper,â€
mama  said,  as  we  turned  to  enter  the
house. â€œyour favorite, billy, sweet potato
pie. youâ€™ll like that, wonâ€™t you?â€

i nodded my head, but my heart wasnâ€™t

in it.

papa  didnâ€™t  follow  us  into  the  kitchen.

he turned and entered his bedroom.

when he came into the room, he had a
small  shoe  box  in  his  hand.  i  recognized
the  box  by  the  bright  blue  ribbon  tied
around it. mama kept her valuables in it.

a  silence  settled  over

the  room.
walking to the head of the table, papa set
the  box  down  and  started  untying  the
ribbon.  his  hands  were  trembling  as  he

fumbled with the knot. with the lid off, he
reached  in  and  started  lif

hills  and  into  town  so  that  you  children
could get an education.â€

i nodded my head.
â€œwell,â€  he  said,  in  a  low  voice,
â€œbecause  of  your  dogs,  her  prayers  have
been answered. this is the money earned
by old dan and little ann. iâ€™ve managed
to make the farm feed us and clothe us and
iâ€™ve saved every cent your furs brought in.
we now have enough.â€

â€œisnâ€™t  it  wonderful,â€  mama  said.  â€œitâ€™s

just like a miracle.â€

â€œi  think  it  is  a  miracle,â€  papa  said.
â€œremember, billy said a prayer when he
asked  for  his  pups  and  then  there  were
your prayers. billy got his pups. through
those  dogs  your  prayers  were  answered.
yes, iâ€™m sure it is a miracle.â€

â€œif he gave them to me, then why did he

take them away?â€ i asked.

â€œi think thereâ€™s an answer for that, too,â€
papa  said.  â€œyou  see,  billy,  your  mother
and i had decided not to separate you from
your dogs. we knew how much you loved
them. we decided that when we mo

town  weâ€™d  leave  you  here  with  your
grandpa  for  a  while.  he  needs  help
anyway. but i guess the good lord didnâ€™t
want that to happen. he doesnâ€™t like to see
families  split  up.  thatâ€™s  why  they  were

taken away.â€

i knew my father was a firm believer in
fate. to him everything that happened was
the will of god, and in his bible he could
always find the answers.

papa  could  see  that  his  talk  had  had
very little effect on me. with a sorrowful
look  on  his  face,  he  sat  down  and  said,
â€œnow let us give thanks for our food and
for all the wonderful things god has done
for  us.  iâ€™ll  say  a  special  prayer  and  ask
him to help billy.â€

i barely heard what papa had to say.
during the meal, i could tell that no one
was enjoying the food. as soon as it was
over, i went to my room and lay down on
the bed.

mama  came  in.  â€œwhy  donâ€™t  you

asked.

â€œit still hurts, mama,â€ i said, as i buried
my face in her dress, â€œbut i do feel a little
better.â€

the  following  spring  we  left  the  ozarks.  the
day we moved i thought everyone would be
sad,  but  it  was  just  the  opposite.  mama
seemed  to  be  the  happiest  one  of  all.  i
could  hear  her  laughing  and  joking  with
my sisters as they packed things. she had a
glow in her eyes i had never seen before
and it made me feel good.

i  even  noticed  a  change  in  papa.  he
didnâ€™t have that whipped look on his face
any  more.  he  was  in  high  spirits  as  we
carried the furniture out to our wagon.

after  the  last  item  was  stored  in  the
wagon,  papa  helped  mama  to  the  spring
seat and we were ready to go.

â€œpapa,  would  you  mind  waiting  a  few
minutes?â€  i  asked.  â€œiâ€™d  like  to  say  good-
bye to my dogs.â€

â€œsure,â€  he  said,  smiling.  â€œwe  have

plenty of time. go right ahead.â€

nearing  the  graves,  i  saw  somethin

remembering

the
legend,  i  turned  and  started  hollering  for
mama.

the  meaning  of

â€œwhat is it, billy? are you all right?â€

â€œmama!  mama!â€  i  shouted.  â€œcome

here! and hurry! you wonâ€™t believe it.â€

in a frightened voice, she shouted back,

â€œiâ€™m  all  right,  mama,â€  i  shouted,  â€œbut

hurry. you just wonâ€™t believe it.â€

holding  her  long  skirt  in  her  hand  and
with a frightened look on her face, mama
came puffing up the hillside. close behind
her came papa and my sisters.

â€œwhat  is  it,  billy?â€  mama  asked,  in  a

scared voice. â€œare you all right?â€

â€œlook!â€ i said, pointing at the red fern.
staring  wide-eyed,  mama  gasped  and
covered her mouth with her hand. i heard
her  say,  almost  in  a  whisper,  â€œoh-h-h-h,
itâ€™s a red fernâ€”a sacred red fern.â€

she  walked  over  and  very  tenderly
started fingering the long red leaves. in an
awed  voice,  she  said,  â€œall  my  life  iâ€™ve
wanted to see one. now i have. itâ€™s a

â€œdonâ€™t  touch  it,  mama,â€  my  oldest

angel.â€

mama  smiled  and  asked,  â€œhave  you

â€œyes,  mama,â€  my

â€œgrandma told me the story, and i believe

sister

with  a  serious  look  on  his  face,  papa
said, â€œthese hills are full of legends. up
until  now  iâ€™ve  never  paid  much  attention
to  them,  but  now  i  donâ€™t  know.  perhaps
there is something to the legend of the red
fern. maybe this is godâ€™s way of helping
billy understand why his dogs died.â€

â€œiâ€™m sure it is, papa,â€ i said, â€œand i do
understand.  i  feel  different  now,  and  i
donâ€™t hurt any more.â€

â€œcome,â€ mama said, â€œletâ€™s go back to
the  wagon.  billy  wants  to  be  alone  with

a while.â€

just  as  they  turned  to  leave,  i  heard
papa murmur in a low voice, â€œwonderful
indeed is the work of our lord.â€

as i stood looking at the two graves, i
noticed  things  i  hadnâ€™t  seen  before.  wild
violets,  rooster  heads,  and  mountain
daisies  had  completely  covered  the  two
little  mounds.  a  summer  breeze  gushed
down from the rugged hills. i felt its warm
caress as it fanned my face. it hummed a
tune  in  the  underbrush  and  rustled  the
leaves  on  the  huge  red  oak.  the  red  fern
wavered  and  danced  to  the

head. in
a  choking  voice,  i  said,  â€œgood-bye,  old
dan and little ann. iâ€™ll never forget you;
and  this  i  knowâ€”if  god  made  room  in

heaven for all good dogs, i know he made
a special place for you.â€

with a heavy heart, i turned and walked
away.  i  knew  that  as  long  as  i  lived  iâ€™d
never  forget  the  two  little  graves  and  the
sacred red fern.

i saw i had left the door to the barn loft

not far from our home, the road wound
its way up and over a hill. at the top papa
stopped  the  team.  we  all  stood  up  and
looked back. it was a beautiful sight, one
iâ€™ll never forget.

as i stood and looked at the home of my
birth, it looked sad and lonely. there was
no spiral of lazy blue smoke twisting from
the  rock  chimney,  no  white  leghorn  hen
chasing  a  june  bug,  no  horse  or  cow
standing  with  head  down  and
tail
switching.

gently in the warm summer breeze.

something  scurried  across  the  vacant

e to my eyes.

i  could  see

the  sorrowful  silence  was  broken  by
my motherâ€™s voice. she asked, â€œbilly, can
you see it?â€

it,â€ she said.

rubbing  my  eyes,  i  looked  to  the
hillside above our home. there it stood in
all its wild beauty, a waving red banner in
a carpet of green. it seemed to be saying,
â€œgood-bye,  and  donâ€™t  worry,  for  iâ€™ll  be
here always.â€

hearing a sniffling, i turned around. my
three  little  sisters  had  started  crying.
mama said something to papa. i heard the
jingle of the trace chains as they tightened
in the singletrees.

our wagon moved on.

i  have  never  been  back  to  the  ozarks.
all  i  have  left  are  my  dreams  and
memories, but if god is willing, some day
