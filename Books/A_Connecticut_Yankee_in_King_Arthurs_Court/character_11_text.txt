one that ever was set up and any nobility that ever
supported it.  we should see certain things yet, let us hope and
believe.  first, a modified monarchy, till arthur’s days were done,
then the destruction of the throne, nobility abolished, every
member of it bound out to some useful trade, universal suffrage
instituted, and the whole government placed in the hands of the
men and women of the nation there to remain.  yes, there was no
occasion to give up my dream yet a while.



chapter xxxi

marco

we strolled along in a sufficiently indolent fashion now, and
talked.  we must dispose of about the amount of time it ought
to take to go to the little hamlet of abblasoure and put justice
on the track of those murderers and get back home again.  and
meantime i had an auxiliary interest which had never paled yet,
never lost its novelty for me since i had been in arthur’s kingdom:
the behavior--born of nice and exact subdivisions of caste--of chance
passers-by toward each other.  toward the s

 the north as they were
in the south, because the one wage had that much more purchasing
power than the other had.

yes, i made various acquaintances in the hamlet and a thing that
gratified me a good deal was to find our new coins in circulation
--lots of milrays, lots of mills, lots of cents, a good many nickels,
and some silver; all this among the artisans and commonalty
generally; yes, and even some gold--but that was at the bank,
that is to say, the goldsmith’s.  i dropped in there while marco,
the son of marco, was haggling with a shopkeeper over a quarter
of a pound of salt, and asked for change for a twenty-dollar gold
piece.  they furnished it--that is, after they had chewed the piece,
and rung it on the counter, and tried acid on it, and asked me
where i got it, and who i was, and where i was from, and where
i was going to, and when i expected to get there, and perhaps
a couple of hundred more questions; and when they got aground,
i went right on and furnished them a lot of info

ad dropped
the names of the former moneys, and spoke of things as being worth
so many dollars or cents or mills or milrays now.  it was very
gratifying.  we were progressing, that was sure.

i got to know several master mechanics, but about the most interesting
fellow among them was the blacksmith, dowley.  he was a live man
and a brisk talker, and had two journeymen and three apprentices,
and was doing a raging business.  in fact, he was getting rich,
hand over fist, and was vastly respected.  marco was very proud of
having such a man for a friend.  he had taken me there ostensibly
to let me see the big establishment which bought so much of his
charcoal, but really to let me see what easy and almost familiar
terms he was on with this great man.  dowley and i fraternized
at once; i had had just such picked men, splendid fellows, under
me in the colt arms factory.  i was bound to see more of him, so
i invited him to come out to marco’s sunday, and dine with us.
marco was appalled, and held

 his breath; and when the grandee
accepted, he was so grateful that he almost forgot to be astonished
at the condescension.

marco’s joy was exuberant--but only for a moment; then he grew
thoughtful, then sad; and when he heard me tell dowley i should
have dickon, the boss mason, and smug, the boss wheelwright, out
there, too, the coal-dust on his face turned to chalk, and he lost
his grip.  but i knew what was the matter with him; it was the
expense.  he saw ruin before him; he judged that his financial
days were numbered.  however, on our way to invite the others,
i said:

“you must allow me to have these friends com

 bear a burden
like to this alone.”

i stopped him, and said:

“now let’s understand each other on the spot, old friend.  i am
only a farm bailiff, it is true; but i am not poor, nevertheless.
i have been very fortunate this year--you would be astonished
to know how i have thriven.  i tell you the honest truth when i say
i could squander away as many as a dozen feasts like this and never
care _that_ for the expense!” and i snapped my fingers.  i could
see myself rise a foot at a time in marco’s estimation, and when
i fetched out those last words i was become a very tower for style
and altitude.  “so you see, you must let me have my way.  you
can’t contribute a cent to this orgy, that’s _settled_.”

“it’s grand and good of you--”

“no, it isn’t.  you’ve opened your house to jones and me in the
most generous way; jones was remarking upon it to-day, just before
you came back from the village; for although he wouldn’t be likely
to say such a thing to you--because

was born.  why, do you know, sometimes in a single week i spend
--but never mind about that--you’d never believe it anyway.”

and so we went gadding along, dropping in here and there, pricing
things, and gossiping with the shopkeepers about the riot, and now
and then running across pathetic reminders of it, in the persons of
shunned and tearful and houseless remnants of families whose homes
had been taken from them and their parents butchered or hanged.
the raiment of marco and his wife was of coarse tow-linen and
linsey-woolsey respectively, and resembled township maps, it being
made up pretty exclusively of patches which had been added, township
by township, in the course of five or six years, until hardly a
hand’s-breadth of the original garments was surviving and present.
now i wanted to fit these people out with new suits, on account of
that swell company, and i didn’t know just how to get at it
--with delicacy, until at last it struck me that as i had al

ready
been liberal in inventing wordy gratitude for the king, it would
be just the thing to back it up with evidence of a substantial
sort; so i said:

“and marco, there’s another thing which you must permit--out of
kindness for jones--because you wouldn’t want to offend him.
he was very anxious to testify his appreciation in some way, but
he is so diffident he couldn’t venture it himself, and so he begged
me to buy some little things and give them to you and dame phyllis
and let him pay for them without your ever knowing they came from
him--you know how a delicate person feels about that sort of thing
--and so i said i would, and we would keep mum

.  well, his idea
was, a new outfit of clothes for you both--”

“oh, it is wastefulness!  it may not be, brother, it may not be.
consider the vastness of the sum--”

“hang the vastness of the sum!  try to keep quiet for a moment,
and see how it would seem; a body can’t get in a word edgeways,
you talk so much.  you ought to cure that, marco; it isn’t good
form, you know, and it will grow on you if you don’t check it.
yes, we’ll step in here now and price this man’s stuff--and don’t
forget to remember to not let on to jones that you know he had
anything to do with it.  you can’t think how curiously sensitive
and proud he is.  he’s a farmer--pretty fairly well-to-do farmer
--and i’m his bailiff; _but_--the imagination of that man!  why,
sometimes when he forgets himself and gets to blowing off, you’d
think he was o

im for a farmer--especially if
he talked agriculture.  he _thinks_ he’s a sheol of a farmer; thinks
he’s old grayback from wayback; but between you and me privately
he don’t know as much about farming as he does about running
a kingdom--still, whatever he talks about, you want to drop your
underjaw and listen, the same as if you had never heard such
incredible wisdom in all your life before, and were afraid you
might die before you got enough of it.  that will please jones.”

it tickled marco to the marrow to hear about such an odd character;
but it also prepared him for accidents; and in my experience when
you travel with a king who is letting on to be something else and
can’t remember it more than about half the time, you can’t take
too many precautions.

this was the best store we had come across yet; it had everything
in it, in small quantities, from anvils and drygoods all the way
down to fish and pinchbeck jewelry.  i concluded i would bunch
my whole invoice right here, an

so i got rid of marco, by sending him off to invite the mason and
the wheelwright, which left the field free to me.  for i never care
to do a thing in a quiet way; it’s got to be theatrical or i don’t
take any interest in it.  i showed up money enough, in a careless
way, to corral the shopkeeper’s respect, and then i wrote down
a list of the things i wanted, and handed it to him to see if he
could read it.  he could, and was proud to show that he could.
he said he had been educated by a priest, and could both

and write.  he ran it through, and remarked with satisfaction that
it was a pretty heavy bill.  well, and so it was, for a little
concern like that.  i was not only providing a swell dinner, but
some odds and ends of extras.  i ordered that the things be carted
out and delivered at the dwelling of marco, the son of marco,
by saturday evening, and send me the bill at dinner-time sunday.
he said i could depend upon his promptness and exactitude, it was
the rule of the house.  he also observed that he would throw in
a couple of miller-guns for the marcos gratis--that everybody
was using them now.  he had a mighty opinion of that clever
device.  i said:

“and please fill them up to the middle mark, too; and add that
to the bill.”

he would, with pleasure.  he filled them, and i took them with
me.  i couldn’t

he merest trifle, and the shopkeeper
got that, not the government.  we furnished them for nothing.

the king had hardly missed us when we got back at nightfall.  he
had early dropped again into his dream of a grand invasion of gaul
with the whole strength of his kingdom at his back, and the afternoon
had slipped away without his ever coming to himself again.

dowley’s humiliation

well, when that cargo arrived toward sunset, saturday afternoon,
i had my hands full to keep the marcos from fainting.  they were
sure jones and i were ruined past help, and they blamed themselves
as accessories to this bankruptcy.  you see, in addition to the
dinner-materials, which called for a sufficiently round sum,
i had bought a lot of extras for the future comfort of the family:
for instance, a big lot of wheat, a delicacy as rare to the tables
of their class as was ice-cream to a hermit’s; also a sizeable
deal dinner-table; also two entire pounds of salt, which was
another piece of ext

ravagance in those people’s eyes; also crockery,
stools, the clothes, a small cask of beer, and so on.  i instructed
the marcos to keep quiet about this sumptuousness, so as to give
me a chance to surprise the guests and show off a little.  concerning
the new clothes, the simple couple were like children; they were up
and down, all night, to see if it wasn’t nearly daylight, so that
they could put them on, and they were into them at last as much
as an hour before dawn was due.  then their pleasure--not to say
delirium--was so fresh and novel and inspiring that the sight of it
paid me well for the interruptions which

the king had slept just as usual--like the dead.  the marcos could
not thank him for their clothes, that being forbidden; but they
tried every way they could think of to make him see how grateful
they were.  which all went for nothing: he didn’t notice any change.

it turned out to be one of those rich and rare fall days which is
just a june day toned down to a degree where it is heaven to be
out of doors.  toward noon the guests arrived, and we assembled
under a great tree and were soon as sociable as old acquaintances.

it caused a visible stir of surprise, it being brand new and a
sumptuous article of deal.  but the surprise rose higher still
when the dame, with a body oozing easy indifference at every pore,
but eyes that gave it all away by absolutely flaming with vanity,
slowly unfolded an actual simon-pure tablecloth and spread it.
that was a notch above even the blacksmith’s domestic grandeurs,
and it hit him hard; you could see it.  but marco was in paradise;
you could see that, too.  then the dame brought two fine new
stools--whew! that was a sensation; it was visible in the eyes of
every guest.  then she brought two more--as calmly as she could.

the mason muttered:

wonder and awe, i sort of waved my hand as if by accident, and
the storekeeper’s son emerged from space and said he had come
to collect.

“that’s all right,” i said, indifferently.  “what is the amount?
give us the items.”

then he read off this bill, while those three amazed men listened,
and serene waves of satisfaction rolled over my soul and alternate
waves of terror and admiration surged over marco’s:

keep the change.”

there was an amazed murmur to this effect:

“verily this being is _made_ of money!  he throweth it away even
as if it were dirt.”

the blacksmith was a crushed man.

the clerk took his money and reeled away drunk with fortune.  i said
to marco and his wife:

“good folk, here is a little trifle for you”--handing the miller-guns
as if it were a matter of no consequence, though each of them
contained fifteen cents in solid cash; and while the poor creatures
went to pieces with astonishment and gratitude, i turned to the
others and said as calmly as one would ask the time of day:

“well, if we are all ready, i judge the dinner is.  come, fall to.”

whitney, morse, stephenson, bell.

the king got his cargo aboard, and then, the talk not turning upon
battle, conquest, or iron-clad duel, he dulled down to drowsiness
and went off to take a nap.  mrs. marco cleared the table, placed
the beer keg handy, and went away to eat her dinner of leavings
in humble privacy, and the rest of us soon drifted into matters
near and dear to the hearts of our sort--business and wages,
of course.  at a first glance, things appeared to be exceeding
prosperous in this little tributary kingdom--whose lord was
king bagdemagus--as compared with the state of things in my own
region.  they had the “protection” system in full force here,

there was a general gasp of awed astonishment, dickon the mason
murmured, with raised eyes and hands:

“more than three weeks’ pay for one day’s work!”

“riches!--of a truth, yes, riches!” muttered marco, his breath
coming quick and short, with excitement.

“wages will keep on rising, little by little, little by little,
as steadily as a tree grows, and at the end of three hundred and
forty years more there’ll be at least _one_ country where the
mechanic’s average wage will be _two hundred_ cents a day!”

it knocked them absolutely dumb!  not a man of them could get
his breath for upwards of two minutes.  then the coal-burner

the yankee and the king sold as slaves

well, what had i better do?  nothing in a hurry, sure.  i must
get up a diversion; anything to employ me while i could think,
and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life
again.  there sat marco, petrified in the act of trying to get
the hang of his miller-gun--turned to stone, just in the attitude
he was in when my pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped in his
unconscious fingers.  so i took it from him and proposed to explain
its mystery.  mystery! a simple little thing like that; and yet it
was mysterious enough, for that race and that age.

i never saw such an awkward people, with machinery; you see, they
were totally unused to it.  the miller-gun was a little double-barreled

t was left in them.  hammering each other--for we stepped
aside and looked on while they rolled, and struggled, and gouged,
and pounded, and bit, with the strict and wordless attention to
business of so many bulldogs.  we looked on without apprehension,
for they were fast getting past ability to go for help against us,
and the arena was far enough from the public road to be safe
from intrusion.

well, while they were gradually playing out, it suddenly occurred
to me to wonder what had become of marco.  i looked around; he
was nowhere to be seen.  oh, but this was ominous!  i pulled the
king’s sleeve, and we glided away and rushed for the hut.  no marco
there, no phyllis there!  they had gone to the road for help, sure.
i told the king to give his heels wings, and i would explain later.
we made good time across the open ground, and as we darted into
the shelter of the wood i glanced back and saw a mob of excited
peasants swarm into view, with marco and his wife at their head.
