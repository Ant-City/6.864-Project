â€œi have.â€

â€œyou intend visiting _il colosseo_.â€

â€œyou mean the colosseum?â€

â€œit is the same thing. you have told your coachman to leave the city by
the porta del popolo, to drive round the walls, and re-enter by the
porta san giovanni?â€

â€œthese are my words exactly.â€

â€œwell, this route is impossible.â€

â€œimpossible!â€

â€œvery dangerous, to say the least.â€

â€œdangerous!--and why?â€

â€œon account of the famous luigi vampa.â€

â€œpray, who may this famous luigi vampa be?â€ inquired albert; â€œhe may be
very famous at rome, but i can assure you he is quite unknown at paris.â€

â€œwhat! do you not know him?â€

â€œi have not that honor.â€

â€œyou have never heard his name?â€

â€œnever.â€

â€œwell, then, he is a bandit, compared to whom the decesaris and the
gasparones were mere children.â€

â€œnow then, albert,â€ cried franz, â€œhere is a bandit for you at last.â€

â€œi forewarn you, signor pastrini, that

â€œon your honor is that true?â€ cried albert.

â€œcount,â€ returned signor pastrini, hurt at albertâ€™s repeated doubts of
the truth of his assertions, â€œi do not say this to you, but to your
companion, who knows rome, and knows, too, that these things are not to
be laughed at.â€

â€œmy dear fellow,â€ said albert, turning to franz, â€œhere is an admirable
adventure; we will fill our carriage with pistols, blunderbusses, and
double-barrelled guns. luigi vampa comes to take us, and we take him--we
bring him back to rome, and present him to his holiness the pope, who
asks how he can repay so great a service; then we merely ask for a
carriage and a pair of horses, and we see the carnival in the carriage,
and doubtless the roman people will crown us at the capitol, and
proclaim us, like curtius and horatius cocles, the preservers of their
country.â€

whilst albert proposed this scheme, signor pastriniâ€™s face assumed an
expression impossible to descri

the â€˜_let him die_,â€™ of corneille, only, when horace made that answer,
the safety of rome was concerned; but, as for us, it is only to gratify
a whim, and it would be ridiculous to risk our lives for so foolish a
motive.â€ albert poured himself out a glass of _lacryma christi_, which
he sipped at intervals, muttering some unintelligible words.

â€œwell, signor pastrini,â€ said franz, â€œnow that my companion is quieted,
and you have seen how peaceful my intentions are, tell me who is this
luigi vampa. is he a shepherd or a nobleman?--young or old?--tall or
short? describe him, in order that, if we meet him by chance, like jean
sbogar or lara, we may recognize him.â€

â€œyou could not apply to anyone better able to inform you on all these
points, for i knew him when he was a child, and one day that i fell into
his hands, going from ferentino to alatri, he, fortunately for me,
recollected me, and set me free, not only without ransom, but made me a
present of a very splendid watch, and relate

â€œlet us hear the history,â€ said franz, motioning signor pastrini to seat
himself.

â€œyour excellencies permit it?â€ asked the host.

â€œ_pardieu!_â€ cried albert, â€œyou are not a preacher, to remain standing!â€

the host sat down, after having made each of them a respectful bow,
which meant that he was ready to tell them all they wished to know
concerning luigi vampa. â€œyou tell me,â€ said franz, at the moment signor
pastrini was about to open his mouth, â€œthat you knew luigi vampa when he
was a child--he is still a young man, then?â€

â€œa young man? he is only two and twenty;--he will gain himself a
reputation.â€

â€œwhat do you think of that, albert?--at two and twenty to be thus
famous?â€

â€œyes, and at his age, alexander, cÃ¦sar, and napoleon, who have all made
some noise in the world, were quite behind him.â€

â€œso,â€ continued franz, â€œthe

â€œâ€˜i accept it,â€™ answered the traveller, â€˜but then the obligation will be
on my side, for this poniard is worth more than two sequins.â€™

â€œâ€˜for a dealer perhaps; but for me, who engraved it myself, it is hardly

â€œâ€˜what is your name?â€™ inquired the traveller.

â€œâ€˜luigi vampa,â€™ replied the shepherd, with the same air as he would have
replied, alexander, king of macedon. â€˜and yours?â€™

â€œâ€˜i,â€™ said the traveller, â€˜am called sinbad the sailor.â€™â€

franz dâ€™epinay started with surprise.

â€œsinbad the sailor?â€ he said.

â€œyes,â€ replied the narrator; â€œthat was the name which the traveller gave
to vampa as his own.â€

â€œwell, and what may you have to say against this name?â€ inquired albert;

to repress her emotion. suddenly, about ten paces from them, a man
advanced from behind a tree and aimed at vampa.

â€œâ€˜not another step,â€™ he said, â€˜or you are a dead man.â€™

â€œâ€˜what, then,â€™ said vampa, raising his hand with a gesture of disdain,
while teresa, no longer able to restrain her alarm, clung closely to
him, â€˜do wolves rend each other?â€™

â€œâ€˜who are you?â€™ inquired the sentinel.

â€œâ€˜i am luigi vampa, shepherd of the san-felice farm.â€™

â€œâ€˜what do you want?â€™

â€œâ€˜i would speak with your companions who are in the glade at rocca
bianca.â€™

â€œâ€˜follow me, then,â€™ said the sentinel; â€˜or, as you know your way, go
first.â€™

â€œvampa smiled disdainfully at this precaution on the part of the bandit,
went before teresa, and continued to advance with the same firm and easy
step as before. at the end of ten minutes the bandit made them a sign to
stop. the two young persons obeyed. then

sentinel.

â€œâ€˜what has he to say?â€™ inquired the young man who was in command in the
chiefâ€™s absence.

â€œâ€˜i wish to say that i am tired of a shepherdâ€™s life,â€™ was vampaâ€™s
reply.

â€œâ€˜ah, i understand,â€™ said the lieutenant; â€˜and you seek admittance into
our ranks?â€™

â€œâ€˜welcome!â€™ cried several bandits from ferrusino, pampinara, and anagni,
who had recognized luigi vampa.

â€œâ€˜yes, but i came to ask something more than to be your companion.â€™

â€œâ€˜and what may that be?â€™ inquired the bandits with astonishment.

â€œâ€˜i come to ask to be your captain,â€™ said the young man.

â€œthe bandits shouted with laughter.

â€œâ€˜and what have you done to aspire to this honor?â€™ demanded the
lieutenant.

â€œand what may a myth be?â€ inquired pastrini.

â€œthe explanation would be too long, my dear landlord,â€ replied franz.

â€œand you say that signor vampa exercises his profession at this moment
in the environs of rome?â€

â€œand with a boldness of which no bandit before him ever gave an
example.â€

â€œthen the police have vainly tried to lay hands on him?â€

andrea rondolo, and peppino, otherwise called rocca priori; the former
found guilty of the murder of a venerable and exemplary priest, named
don cÃ©sar torlini, canon of the church of st. john lateran; and the
latter convicted of being an accomplice of the atrocious and sanguinary
bandit, luigi vampa, and his band. the first-named malefactor will be

transteverin was no other than the bandit luigi vampa himself, and the
man shrouded in the mantle the same he had known as â€œsinbad the sailor,â€
 but who, no doubt, was still pursuing his philanthropic expedition in
rome, as he had already done at porto-vecchio and tunis. time was
getting on, however, and franz deemed it advisable to awaken albert; but

â€œ_if by six in the morning the four thousand piastres are not in my

this second signature explained everything to franz, who now understood
the objection of the messenger to coming up into the apartment; the
street was safer for him. albert, then, had fallen into the hands of the
famous bandit chief, in whose existence he had for so long a time
refused to believe.

earnestness usual to him; â€œand what may it be?â€

â€œyes,â€ replied the count, going to the door, and returning. franz gave
him albertâ€™s letter.

â€œread that,â€ he said.

the count read it.

â€œwell, well!â€ said he.

â€œdid you see the postscript?â€

â€œi did, indeed.

â€œyes, all but eight hundred piastres.â€

the count went to his _secrÃ©taire_, opened it, and pulling out a drawer
filled with gold, said to franz, â€œi hope you will not offend me by
applying to anyone but myself.â€

franz.

 asked the young man, looking fixedly in his turn at the count.

â€œjudge for yourself,â€ replied he. â€œthe postscript is explicit.â€

â€œi think that if you would take the trouble of reflecting, you could
find a way of simplifying the negotiation,â€ said franz.

â€œhow so?â€ returned the count, with surprise.

â€œif we were to go together to luigi vampa, i am sure he would not refuse
you albertâ€™s freedom.â€

â€œwhat influence can i possibly have over a bandit?â€

â€œhave you not just rendered him a service that can never be forgotten?â€

â€œwhat is that?â€

â€œhave you not saved peppinoâ€™s life?â€

â€œwell, well,â€ said the count, â€œwho told you that?â€

instant.

â€œexcellency, the frenchmanâ€™s carriage passed several times the one in
which was teresa.â€

â€œthe chiefâ€™s mistress?â€

â€œyes. the frenchman threw her a bouquet; teresa returned it--all this
with the consent of the chief, who was in the carriage.â€

â€œwhat?â€ cried franz, â€œwas luigi vampa in the carriage with the roman
peasants?â€

â€œit was he who drove, disguised as the coachman,â€ replied peppino.

â€œwell?â€ said the count.

â€œwell, then, the frenchman took off his mask; teresa, with the chiefâ€™s
consent, did the same. the frenchman asked for a rendezvous; teresa gave
him one--only, instead of teresa, it was beppo who was on the steps of

committed.â€ franz approached, the chief advancing several steps to meet
him.

four thousand piastres were paid into his account at his bankerâ€™s, at a

with a postscript of m. luigi vampa. this is all i know, but i know not,
count, how you contrived to inspire so much respect in the bandits of
rome who ordinarily have so little respect for anything. i assure you,
franz and i were lost in admiration.â€

carried off 3,000 crowns from here the other day?â€

â€œno; he really had 3,000 crowns, and we found them. i mean the russian

taking a rosary from his pocket began to mutter a few prayers while the
clerk disappeared through the same door by which danglars and the

â€œoh, god be praised,â€ he said; â€œit is a real bed!â€

â€œ_ecco!_â€ said the guide, and pushing danglars into the cell, he closed
the door upon him. a bolt grated and danglars was a prisoner. if there
had been no bolt, it would have been impossible for him to pass through
the midst of the garrison who held the catacombs of st. sebastian,
encamped round a master whom our readers must have recognized as the
famous luigi vampa. danglars, too, had recognized the bandit, whose
existence he would not believe when albert de morcerf mentioned him in
paris; and not only did he recognize him, but the cell in which albert
had been confined, and which was probably kept for the accommodation of
strangers. these recollections were dwelt upon with some pleasure by
danglars, and restored him to some degree of tranquillity. since the
bandits had not despatched him at once, he felt that they would not kill
him at all. they had arre

could manage to keep out of difficulties. therefore, tolerably secure in
being able to extricate himself from his position, provided he were not
rated at the unreasonable sum of 5,050,000 francs, he stretched himself
on his bed, and after turning over two or three times, fell asleep with
the tranquillity of the hero whose life luigi vampa was studying.
