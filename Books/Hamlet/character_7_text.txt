bseruant watch,
so nightly toyles the subiect of the land,
and why such dayly cast of brazon cannon
and forraigne mart for implements of warre:
why such impresse of ship-wrights, whose sore taske
do's not diuide the sunday from the weeke,
what might be toward, that this sweaty hast
doth make the night ioynt-labourer with the day:
who is't that can informe me?
  hor. that can i,
at least the whisper goes so: our last king,
whose image euen but now appear'd to vs,
was (as you know) by fortinbras of norway,
(thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride)
dar'd to the combate. in which, our valiant hamlet,
(for so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him)
did slay this fortinbras: who by a seal'd compact,
well ratified by law, and heraldrie,
did forfeite (with his life) all those his lands
which he stood seiz'd on, to the conqueror:
against the which, a moity competent
was gaged by our king: which had return'd
to the inheritance of fortinbras,
had he bin vanquisher, as by the s

of vnimproued mettle, hot and full,
hath in the skirts of norway, heere and there,
shark'd vp a list of landlesse resolutes,
for foode and diet, to some enterprize
that hath a stomacke in't: which is no other
(and it doth well appeare vnto our state)
but to recouer of vs by strong hand
and termes compulsatiue, those foresaid lands
so by his father lost: and this (i take it)
is the maine motiue of our preparations,
the sourse of this our watch, and the cheefe head

 him,
together with remembrance of our selues.
therefore our sometimes sister, now our queene,
th' imperiall ioyntresse of this warlike state,
haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy,
with one auspicious, and one dropping eye,
with mirth in funerall, and with dirge in marriage,
in equall scale weighing delight and dole
taken to wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd
your better wisedomes, which haue freely gone
with this affaire along, for all our thankes.
now followes, that you know young fortinbras,
holding a weake supposall of our worth;
or thinking by our late deere brothers death,
our state to be disioynt, and out of frame,
colleagued with the dreame of his aduantage;
he hath not fayl'd to pester vs with message,
importing the surrender of those lands
lost by his father: with all bonds of law
to our most valiant brother. so much for him.
enter voltemand and cornelius.

now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting
thus much the businesse is. we haue heere writ
to norway,

out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch
you good cornelius, and you voltemand,
for bearing of this greeting to old norway,
giuing to you no further personall power
to businesse with the king, more then the scope
of these dilated articles allow:
farewell, and let your hast commend your duty

  volt. most faire returne of greetings, and desires.
vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse
his nephewes leuies, which to him appear'd
to be a preparation 'gainst the poleak:
but better look'd into, he truly found
it was against your highnesse, whereat greeued,
that so his sicknesse, age, and impotence
was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
on fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes,
receiues rebuke from norwey: and in fine,
makes vow before his vnkle, neuer more
to giue th' assay of armes against your maiestie.
whereon old norwey, ouercome with ioy,
giues him three thousand crownes in annuall fee,
and his commission to imploy those soldiers
so leuied as before, against the poleak:
with an intreaty heerein further shewne,
that it might please you to giue quiet passe
through your dominions, for his enterprize,
