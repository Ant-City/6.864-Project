                margaret's sister, a passionate, flighty girl of 
21 who lives for art, literature, and "human 
relations."  like margaret, helen is a representative 
of the idealistic, cultured schlegel family, which 
represents the intellectual aspect of the upper 
classes.  but helen, who is prettier than margaret, 
is also much less grounded and far more prone to 
excessive and dramatic behavior.
