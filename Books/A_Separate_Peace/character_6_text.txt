ir that shriveled, soon to put out the lights on the countryside. one of my legs wouldnt stop trembling, whether from cold or anger i couldnt tell. i wished i had hit him harder.someone was coming toward me along the bent, broken lane which led to the dormitory, a lane out of old london, ancient houses on either side leaning as though soon to tumble into it, cobblestones heaving underfoot like a bricked-over ocean squalla figure of great height advanced down them toward me. it could only be mr. ludsbury; no one else could pass over these stones with such contempt for the idea of tripping.the houses on either side were inhabited by i didnt know who; wispy, fragile old ladies seemed most likely. i couldnt duck into one of them. there were angles and bumps and bends everywhere, but none big enough to conceal me. mr. ludsbury loomed on like a high-masted clipper ship in this rocking passage, and i tried to go stealthily by him on my watery, squeaking sneakers.just one moment, forrester, if you p

lease. mr. ludsburys voice was bass, british, and his adams apple seemed to move as much as his mouth when he spoke. has there been a cloudburst in your part of town?no, sir. im sorry, sir, i fell into the river. i apologized by instinct to him for this mishap which discomforted only me.and could you tell me how and why you fell into the river?i slipped.yes. after a pause he went on. i think you have slipped in any number of ways since last year. i understand for example that there was gaming in my dormitory t

oker and unpredictable games invented by phineas rose up in my mind; the back room of lepers suite, a lamp hung with a blanket so that only a small blazing circle of light fell sharply amid the surrounding darkness; phineas losing even in those games he invented, betting always for what should win, for what would have been the most brilliant successes of all, if only the cards hadnt betrayed him. finny finally betting his icebox and losing it, that contraption, to me.i thought of it because mr. ludsbury was just then saying, and while im putting the dormitory back together id better tell you to get rid of that leaking icebox. nothing like that is ever permitted in the dormitory, of course. i notice that everything went straight to seed during the summer and that none of you old boys who knew our standards so much as lifted a finger to help mr. prudhomme maintain order. as a substitute for the summer he couldnt have been expected to know everything there was to be known at once. you old boys si

mply took advantage of the situation.i stood there shaking in my wet sneakers. if only i had truly taken advantage of the situation, seized and held and prized the multitudes of advantages the summer offered me; if only i had.i said nothing, on my face i registered the bleak look of a defendant who knows the court will never be swayed by all the favorable evidence he has. it was a schoolboy look; mr. ludsbury knew it well.theres a long-distance call for you, he continued in the tone of the judge performing the disagreeable duty of telling the defendant his right. ive written the operators number on the pad beside the telephone in my study. you may go in and call.thank you very much, sir.he sailed on down the lane without further reference to me, and i wondered who was sick at home.but when i reached his studylow-ceilinged, gloomy with books, black leather chairs, a pipe rack, frayed brown rug, a

spent, on you too. so start talking, pal. and it better be good. start with sports. what are you going out for?crew. well, not exactly crew. managing crew. assistant crew manager.assistant crew manager!i dont think ive got the jobassistant crew manager!i got in a fight this afterassistant crew manager!  no voice could course with dumfoundment like finnys you are crazy!listen, finny, i dont care about being a big man on the campus or anything.whaaat? much more clearly than anything in mr. ludsburys study i could see his face now, grimacing in wide, obsessed stupefaction. who said anything about whoever they are!well then what are you so worked up for?what do you want to manage crew for? what do you want to manage for? whats that got to do with sports?the point was, the grace of it was, that it had nothing to do with sports. for i wanted no more of sports. they were barred from me, as though when dr. stanpole said, sports are finished he had been speaking of me. i didnt trust myself in

rrent in his voice, a genuinely conspiratorial note, as though he believed literally everything that had been said. his attitude seemed to me almost obscene, the attitude of someone who discovers a sexual secret of yours and promises not to tell a soul if you will describe it in detail to him.well, i replied in a stronger voice, first i stole all his money. then i found that he cheated on his entrance tests to devon and i blackmailed his parents about that, then i made love to his sister in mr. ludsburys study, then i  it was going well, faint grins were appearing around the room, even the younger boy seemed to suspect that he was being sincere about a joke, a bad mistake to make at devon, then i  i only had to add, pushed him out of the tree and the chain of implausibility would be complete, then i  just those few words and perhaps this dungeon nightmare would end.but i could feel my throat closing on them; i could never say them, never.i swung on the younger boy. what did i do then? i dema

guess i did, in a way.well, he gathered the sheepskin collar around his throat, now you know. and stop talking like a georgia crackerdont guess i did! despite this gibe he was rather impersonal toward me. he seemed older that morning, and leaning quietly against that great tree wrapped in his heavy coat, he seemed smaller too. or perhaps it was only that i, inside the same body, had felt myself all at once grown bigger.we proceeded slowly back to the dormitory. on the steps going in we met mr. ludsbury coming out.ive been watching you from my window, he said in his hooting voice with a rare trace of personal interest. what are you up to, forrester, training for the commandos? there was no rule explicitly forbidding exercise at such an hour, but it was not expected; ordinarily therefore mr. ludsbury would have disapproved. but the war had modified even his standards; all forms of physical exercise had become conventional for the duration.i mumbled some abashed answer, but it was phineas who

made the clear response.hes developing into a real athlete, he said matter-of-factly. were aiming for the 44 olympics.mr. ludsbury emitted a single chuckle from deep in his throat, then his face turned brick red momentarily and he assumed his customary sententiousness. games are all right in their place, he said, and i wont bore you with the eton playing fields observation, but all exercise today is aimed of course at the approaching waterloo. keep that in your sights at all times, wont you.finnys face set in determination, with the older look i had just detected in him. no, he said.i dont believe any student had ever sa

id no flatly to mr. ludsbury before. it flustered him uncontrollably. his face turned brick red again, and for a moment i thought he was going to run away. then he said something so rapid, throaty, and clipped that neither of us understood it, turned quickly and strode off across the quadrangle.hes really sincere, he thinks theres a war on, said finny in simple wonder. now why wouldnt he know? he pondered mr. ludsburys exclusion from the plot of the fat old men as we watched his figure, reedy even in his winter wraps, move away from us. then the light broke. oh, of course! he cried. too thin. of course.i stood there pitying mr. ludsbury for his fatal thinness and reflecting that after all he had always had a gullible side.chapter 9this was my first but not my last lapse into finnys vision of peace. for hours, and sometimes for days, i fell without realizing it into the private explanation of the world. n

, and without that accolade no one at devon could be anyone. no one, with the exception of course of phineas.to the left of the prize table brinker straddled his cache of cider; behind him was the clump of evergreens, and behind them there was after all a gentle rise, where the ski jump committee was pounding snow into a little take-off ramp whose lip was perhaps a foot higher than the slope of the rise. from there our line of snow statues, unrecognizable artistic attacks on the headmaster, mr. ludsbury, mr. patch-withers, dr. stanpole, the new dietitian, and hazel brewster curved in an enclosing half-circle to the icy, muddy, lisping edge of the tidewater naguamsett and back to the other side of the prize table.when the ski jump was ready there was a certain amount of milling around; twenty boys, tightly reined in all winter, stood now as though with the bit firmly clamped between their teeth, ready to stampede. phineas should have started the sports events but he was absorbed in cataloguing

inside it by phil latham. phil and dr. stanpole then got into the car and drove slowly away, the headlights forming a bright parallel as they receded down the road, and then swinging into another parallel at right angles to the first as they turned into the infirmary driveway. the crowd began to thin rapidly; the faculty had at last heard that something was amiss in the night, and several alarmed and alarming masters materialized in the darkness and ordered the students to their dormitories.mr. ludsbury loomed abruptly out of a. background of shrubbery. get along to the dormitory, forrester, he said with a dry certainty in my obedience which suddenly struck me as funny, definitely funny. since it was beneath his dignity to wait and see that i actually followed his order, i was by not budging free of him a moment later. i walked into the bank of shrubbery, circled past trees in the direction of the chapel, doubled back along a large building donated by the alumni which no one had ever been able

; i was on active duty all my time at school; i killed my enemy there.only phineas never was afraid, only phineas never hated anyone. other people experienced this fearful shock somewhere, this sighting of the enemy, and so began an obsessive labor of defense, began to parry the menace they saw facing them by developing a particular frame of mind, you see, their behavior toward everything and everyone proclaimed, i am a humble ant, i am nothing, i am not worthy of this menace, or else, like mr. ludsbury, how dare this threaten me, i am much too good for this sort of handling, i shall rise above this, or else, like quackenbush, strike out at it always and everywhere, or else, like brinker, develop a careless general resentment against it, or else, like leper, emerge from a protective cloud of vagueness only to meet it, the horror, face to face, just as he had always feared, and so give up the struggle absolutely.all of them, all except phineas, constructed at infinite cost to themselves these
