[CHARACTER]  - 
      a man involved in crime, but for whom crime is the wrong business. indeed, though [CHARACTER] is bad at criminal activity, he seems to have no other option. he is bad at tailgating, as illustrated by his poor performance in following marlowe. he plans a moneymaking scheme with agnes--trading his knowledge of the hiding place of mona grant (eddie mars's wife) for money--but gets killed before he ever sees the money. harry is not very smart, but he illustrates a good will when he gives canino the wrong address and when he protects agnes, his partner in crime.
