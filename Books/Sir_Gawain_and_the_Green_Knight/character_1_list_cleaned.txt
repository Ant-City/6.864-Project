[CHARACTER] - 
                 
a mysterious visitor to camelot. the [CHARACTER]'s huge stature,
wild appearance, and green complexion set him apart from the beardless
knights and beautiful ladies of arthur's camelot. he is an ambiguous
figure: he says that he comes in friendship, not wanting to fight,
but the friendly game he proposes is quite deadly. he attaches great
importance to verbal contracts, expecting sir gawain to go to great
lengths to hold up his end of their bargain. the [CHARACTER] shows
himself to be a supernatural being when he picks up his own severed
head and rides out of arthur's court, still speaking. at the same
time, he seems to symbolize the natural world, in that he is killed
and reborn as part of a cycle. at the poem's end, we discover that
the [CHARACTER] is also bertilak, gawain's host, and one of morgan
le faye's minions.
