he members of the family and household of
the oblonskys. the wife did not leave her own room, the husband had not
been at home for three days. the children ran wild all over the house;
the english governess quarreled with the housekeeper, and wrote to a
friend asking her to look out for a new situation for her; the man-cook
had walked off the day before just at dinner time; the kitchen-maid, and
the coachman had given warning.

three days after the quarrel, prince stepan arkadyevitch oblonskyâ€”stiva,
as he was called in the fashionable worldâ€”woke up at his usual hour,
that is, at eight oâ€™clock in the morning, not in his wifeâ€™s bedroom, but
on the leather-covered sofa in his study. he turned over his stout,
well-cared-for person on the springy sofa, as though he would sink into
a long sleep again; he vigorously embraced the pillow on the other side
and buried his face in it; but all at once he jumped up, sat up on the
sofa, and opened his eyes.

"yes, yes, how was it now?" he thought,

swimming with tears.

"dolly!" he said, sobbing now; "for mercyâ€™s sake, think of the children;
they are not to blame! i am to blame, and punish me, make me expiate my
fault. anything i can do, i am ready to do anything! i am to blame, no
words can express how much i am to blame! but, dolly, forgive me!"

she sat down. he listened to her hard, heavy breathing, and he was
unutterably sorry for her. she tried several times to begin to speak,
but could not. he waited.

"you remember the children, stiva, to play with them; but i remember
them, and know that this means their ruin," she saidâ€”obviously one of
the phrases she had more than once repeated to herself in the course of
the last few days.

she had called him "stiva," and he glanced at her with gratitude, and
moved to take her hand, but she drew back from him with aversion.

"i think of the children, and for that reason i would do anything in the
world to save them, but i donâ€™t myself know how to save them. by taking

 in the service, and his
comparative youth, he occupied the honorable and lucrative position of
president of one of the government boards at moscow. this post he had
received through his sister annaâ€™s husband, alexey alexandrovitch
karenin, who held one of the most important positions in the ministry to
whose department the moscow office belonged. but if karenin had not got
his brother-in-law this berth, then through a hundred other
personagesâ€”brothers, sisters, cousins, uncles, and auntsâ€”stiva oblonsky
would have received this post, or some other similar one, together with
the salary of six thousand absolutely needful for him, as his affairs,
in spite of his wifeâ€™s considerable property, were in an embarrassed
condition.

half moscow and petersburg were friends and relations of stepan
arkadyevitch. he was born in the midst of those who had been and are the
powerful ones of this world. one-third of the men in the government, the
older men, had been friends of his fatherâ€™s, and had

own age and standing did get, and he was no worse qualified for
performing duties of the kind than any other man.

stepan arkadyevitch was not merely liked by all who knew him for his
good humor, but for his bright disposition, and his unquestionable
honesty. in him, in his handsome, radiant figure, his sparkling eyes,
black hair and eyebrows, and the white and red of his face, there was
something which produced a physical effect of kindliness and good humor
on the people who met him. "aha! stiva! oblonsky! here he is!" was
almost always said with a smile of delight on meeting him. even though
it happened at times that after a conversation with him it seemed that
nothing particularly delightful had happened, the next day, and the
next, every one was just as delighted at meeting him again.

after filling for three years the post of president of one of the
government boards at moscow, stepan arkadyevitch had won the respect, as
well as the liking, of his fellow-officials, subordinates, an

sympathy and love unfeigned were visible on annaâ€™s face.

"very well," she said all at once. "but i will tell you it from the
beginning. you know how i was married. with the education mamma gave us
i was more than innocent, i was stupid. i knew nothing. i know they say
men tell their wives of their former lives, but stiva"â€”she corrected
herselfâ€”"stepan arkadyevitch told me nothing. youâ€™ll hardly believe it,

infidelity, i regarded it as impossible, and thenâ€”try to imagine itâ€”with

"no," dolly was beginning, but anna cut her short, kissing her hand once
more.

"i know more of the world than you do," she said. "i know how men like
stiva look at it. you speak of his talking of you with her. that never
happened. such men are unfaithful, but their home and wife are sacred to
them. somehow or other these women are still looked on with contempt by
them, and do not touch on their feeling for their family. they draw a
sort of line that canâ€™t be crossed between them and their families. i

the whole of that day anna spent at home, thatâ€™s to say at the
oblonskysâ€™, and received no one, though some of her acquaintances had
already heard of her arrival, and came to call the same day. anna spent
the whole morning with dolly and the children. she merely sent a brief
note to her brother to tell him that he must not fail to dine at home.
"come, god is merciful," she wrote.

oblonsky did dine at home: the conversation was general, and his wife,
speaking to him, addressed him as "stiva," as she had not done before.
in the relations of the husband and wife the same estrangement still
remained, but there was no talk now of separation, and stepan
arkadyevitch saw the possibility of explanation and reconciliation.

immediately after dinner kitty came in. she knew anna arkadyevna, but
only very slightly, and she came now to her sisterâ€™s with some
trepidation, at the prospect of meeting this fashionable petersburg
lady, whom everyone spoke so highly of. but she made a favorable

r face, and broke out in
her smile and her glance, she would rather have passed for a girl of
twenty, had it not been for a serious and at times mournful look in her
eyes, which struck and attracted kitty. kitty felt that anna was
perfectly simple and was concealing nothing, but that she had another
higher world of interests inaccessible to her, complex and poetic.

after dinner, when dolly went away to her own room, anna rose quickly
and went up to her brother, who was just lighting a cigar.

"stiva," she said to him, winking gaily, crossing him and glancing
towards the door, "go, and god help you."

he threw down the cigar, understanding her, and departed through the
doorway.

when stepan arkadyevitch had disappeared, she went back to the sofa
where she had been sitting, surrounded by the children. either because
the children saw that their mother was fond of this aunt, or that they
felt a special charm in her themselves, the two elder ones, and the
younger following their lead, as childr

just ending, and out of that vast circle, happy and gay, there is a path
growing narrower and narrower, and it is delightful and alarming to
enter the ballroom, bright and splendid as it is.... who has not been
through it?"

kitty smiled without speaking. "but how did she go through it? how i
should like to know all her love story!" thought kitty, recalling the
unromantic appearance of alexey alexandrovitch, her husband.

"i know something. stiva told me, and i congratulate you. i liked him so
much," anna continued. "i met vronsky at the railway station."

"oh, was he there?" asked kitty, blushing. "what was it stiva told you?"

"stiva gossiped about it all. and i should be so glad ... i traveled
yesterday with vronskyâ€™s mother," she went on; "and his mother talked
without a pause of him, heâ€™s her favorite. i know mothers are partial,
but..."

"what did his mother tell you?"

the two hundred roubles he had given at the station.

but she did not tell kitty about the two hundred roubles. for some
reason it was disagreeable to her to think of it. she felt that there
was something that had to do with her in it, and something that ought
not to have been.

"she pressed me very much to go and see her," anna went on; "and i shall
be glad to go to see her tomorrow. stiva is staying a long while in
dollyâ€™s room, thank god," anna added, changing the subject, and getting
up, kitty fancied, displeased with something.

"no, iâ€™m first! no, i!" screamed the children, who had finished tea,
running up to their aunt anna.

"all together," said anna, and she ran laughing to meet them, and
embraced and swung round all the throng of swarming children, shrieking
with delight.

e was in the middle stage
between these two; she was excited, and at the same time she had
sufficient self-possession to be able to observe. in the left corner of
the ballroom she saw the cream of society gathered together.
thereâ€”incredibly nakedâ€”was the beauty lidi, korsunskyâ€™s wife; there was
the lady of the house; there shone the bald head of krivin, always to be
found where the best people were. in that direction gazed the young men,
not venturing to approach. there, too, she descried stiva, and there she
saw the exquisite figure and head of anna in a black velvet gown. and
_he_ was there. kitty had not seen him since the evening she refused
levin. with her long-sighted eyes, she knew him at once, and was even
aware that he was looking at her.

"another turn, eh? youâ€™re not tired?" said korsunsky, a little out of
breath.

"no, thank you!"

"where shall i take you?"

"madame kareninaâ€™s here, i think ... take me to her."

"wherever you command."

looking straight into dollyâ€™s face.

and to her surprise dolly saw that anna was blushing up to her ears, up
to the curly black ringlets on her neck.

"yes," anna went on. "do you know why kitty didnâ€™t come to dinner? sheâ€™s
jealous of me. i have spoiled ... iâ€™ve been the cause of that ball being
a torture to her instead of a pleasure. but truly, truly, itâ€™s not my
fault, or only my fault a little bit," she said, daintily drawling the
words "a little bit."

"oh, how like stiva you said that!" said dolly, laughing.

anna was hurt.

"oh no, oh no! iâ€™m not stiva," she said, knitting her brows. "thatâ€™s why
iâ€™m telling you, just because i could never let myself doubt myself for
an instant," said anna.

but at the very moment she was uttering the words, she felt that they
were not true. she was not merely doubting herself, she felt emotion at
the thought of vronsky, and was going away sooner than she had meant,
simply to avoid meeting him.

her mother, so far as filial reverence would allow. during the princeâ€™s
outburst she was silent; she felt ashamed for her mother, and tender
towards her father for so quickly being kind again. but when her father
left them she made ready for what was the chief thing needfulâ€”to go to
kitty and console her.

"iâ€™d been meaning to tell you something for a long while, mamma: did you
know that levin meant to make kitty an offer when he was here the last
time? he told stiva so."

"well, what then? i donâ€™t understand..."

"so did kitty perhaps refuse him?... she didnâ€™t tell you so?"

"no, she has said nothing to me either of one or the other; sheâ€™s too
proud. but i know itâ€™s all on account of the other."

"yes, but suppose she has refused levin, and she wouldnâ€™t have refused
him if it hadnâ€™t been for the other, i know. and then, he has deceived
her so horribly."

it was too terrible for the princess to think how she had sinned against

with its shaft was now all plainly visible against the dark blue sky,
yet still he waited.

"isnâ€™t it time to go home?" said stepan arkadyevitch.

it was quite still now in the copse, and not a bird was stirring.

"letâ€™s stay a little while," answered levin.

"as you like."

they were standing now about fifteen paces from one another.

"stiva!" said levin unexpectedly; "how is it you donâ€™t tell me whether
your sister-in-lawâ€™s married yet, or when sheâ€™s going to be?"

levin felt so resolute and serene that no answer, he fancied, could
affect him. but he had never dreamed of what stepan arkadyevitch
replied.

"sheâ€™s never thought of being married, and isnâ€™t thinking of it; but
sheâ€™s very ill, and the doctors have sent her abroad. theyâ€™re positively
afraid she may not live."

"what!" cried levin. "very ill? what is wrong

thicket to look for the snipe.

"oh, yes, what was it that was unpleasant?" he wondered. "yes, kittyâ€™s
ill.... well, it canâ€™t be helped; iâ€™m very sorry," he thought.

"sheâ€™s found it! isnâ€™t she a clever thing?" he said, taking the warm
bird from laskaâ€™s mouth and packing it into the almost full game bag.
"iâ€™ve got it, stiva!" he shouted.

on the way home levin asked all details of kittyâ€™s illness and the
shtcherbatskysâ€™ plans, and though he would have been ashamed to admit
it, he was pleased at what he heard. he was pleased that there was still
hope, and still more pleased that she should be suffering who had made
him suffer so much. but when stepan arkadyevitch began to speak of the
causes of kittyâ€™s illness, and mentioned vronskyâ€™s name, levin cut him
short.

is nothing now to me but a painful and humiliating reminiscence."

"what ever for? what nonsense!"

"but we wonâ€™t talk about it. please forgive me, if iâ€™ve been nasty,"
said levin. now that he had opened his heart, he became as he had been
in the morning. "youâ€™re not angry with me, stiva? please donâ€™t be
angry," he said, and smiling, he took his hand.

"of course not; not a bit, and no reason to be. iâ€™m glad weâ€™ve spoken
openly. and do you know, stand-shooting in the morning is unusually
goodâ€”why not go? i couldnâ€™t sleep the night anyway, but i might go
straight from shooting to the station."

her husband.

"heâ€™s broken his leg too, so they say," the general was saying. "this is
beyond everything."

without answering her husband, anna lifted her opera glass and gazed
towards the place where vronsky had fallen; but it was so far off, and
there was such a crowd of people about it, that she could make out
nothing. she laid down the opera glass, and would have moved away, but
at that moment an officer galloped up and made some announcement to the
tsar. anna craned forward, listening.

"stiva! stiva!" she cried to her brother.

but her brother did not hear her. again she would have moved away.

"once more i offer you my arm if you want to be going," said alexey
alexandrovitch, reaching towards her hand.

she drew back from him with aversion, and without looking in his face
answered:

"no, no, let me be, iâ€™ll stay."

she saw now that from the place of vronskyâ€™s accident an officer was
running across the course towards the pavilion. betsy waved her

ad to see him at any time, but at this
moment she was specially glad he should see her in all her glory. no one
was better able to appreciate her grandeur than levin.

seeing her, he found himself face to face with one of the pictures of
his daydream of family life.

"youâ€™re like a hen with your chickens, darya alexandrovna."

"ah, how glad i am to see you!" she said, holding out her hand to him.

"glad to see me, but you didnâ€™t let me know. my brotherâ€™s staying with
me. i got a note from stiva that you were here."

"from stiva?" darya alexandrovna asked with surprise.

"yes; he writes that you are here, and that he thinks you might allow me
to be of use to you," said levin, and as he said it he became suddenly
embarrassed, and, stopping abruptly, he walked on in silence by the
wagonette, snapping off the buds of the lime trees and nibbling them. he
was embarrassed through a sense that darya alexandrovna would be annoyed
by receiving from an outsider help that should by rights have co

alexey alexandrovitch said something which dolly could not catch in the
noise of the moving carriages.

"i shall come round tomorrow!" stepan arkadyevitch shouted to him.

alexey alexandrovitch got into his carriage, and buried himself in it so
as neither to see nor be seen.

"queer fish!" said stepan arkadyevitch to his wife, and glancing at his
watch, he made a motion of his hand before his face, indicating a caress
to his wife and children, and walked jauntily along the pavement.

"stiva! stiva!" dolly called, reddening.

he turned round.

"i must get coats, you know, for grisha and tanya. give me the money."

"never mind; you tell them iâ€™ll pay the bill!" and he vanished, nodding
genially to an acquaintance who drove by.

and stepan arkadyevitch smiled. no one else in stepan arkadyevitchâ€™s
place, having to do with such despair, would have ventured to smile (the
smile would have seemed brutal); but in his smile there was so much of
sweetness and almost feminine tenderness that his smile did not wound,
but softened and soothed. his gentle, soothing words and smiles were as
soothing and softening as almond oil. and anna soon felt this.

"no, stiva," she said, "iâ€™m lost, lost! worse than lost! i canâ€™t say yet
that all is over; on the contrary, i feel that itâ€™s not over. iâ€™m an
overstrained string that must snap. but itâ€™s not ended yet ... and it
will have a fearful end."

"no matter, we must let the string be loosened, little by little.
thereâ€™s no position from which there is no way of escape."

"i have thought, and thought. only one..."

"i donâ€™t know you with this short hair. youâ€™ve grown so pretty. a boy.
but how pale you are!"

"yes, iâ€™m very weak," she said, smiling. and her lips began trembling
again.

"weâ€™ll go to italy; you will get strong," he said.

"can it be possible we could be like husband and wife, alone, your
family with you?" she said, looking close into his eyes.

"it only seems strange to me that it can ever have been otherwise."

"stiva says that _he_ has agreed to everything, but i canâ€™t accept _his_
generosity," she said, looking dreamily past vronskyâ€™s face. "i donâ€™t
want a divorce; itâ€™s all the same to me now. only i donâ€™t know what he
will decide about seryozha."

he could not conceive how at this moment of their meeting she could
remember and think of her son, of divorce. what did it all matter?

"donâ€™t speak of that, donâ€™t think of it," he said, turning her hand in
his, and trying to draw her attention to

stopping kitty.

"iâ€™ll do it," said dolly, and getting up, she carefully passed the spoon
over the frothing sugar, and from time to time shook off the clinging
jam from the spoon by knocking it on a plate that was covered with
yellow-red scum and blood-colored syrup. "how theyâ€™ll enjoy this at
tea-time!" she thought of her children, remembering how she herself as a
child had wondered how it was the grown-up people did not eat what was
best of allâ€”the scum of the jam.

"stiva says itâ€™s much better to give money." dolly took up meanwhile the
weighty subject under discussion, what presents should be made to
servants. "but..."

"moneyâ€™s out of the question!" the princess and kitty exclaimed with one
voice. "they appreciate a present..."

"well, last year, for instance, i bought our matrona semyenovna, not a
poplin, but something of that sort," said the princess.

"i remember she was wearing it on your nameday."

no comprehension, and at the teachers for teaching the children so
badly. but he promised his sister-in-law to give the lessons exactly as
she wished. and he went on teaching grisha, not in his own way, but by
the book, and so took little interest in it, and often forgot the hour
of the lesson. so it had been today.

"no, iâ€™m going, dolly, you sit still," he said. "weâ€™ll do it all
properly, like the book. only when stiva comes, and we go out shooting,
then we shall have to miss it."

and levin went to grisha.

varenka was saying the same thing to kitty. even in the happy,
well-ordered household of the levins varenka had succeeded in making
herself useful.

"iâ€™ll see to the supper, you sit still," she said, and got up to go to
agafea mihalovna.

"yes, yes, most likely theyâ€™ve not been able to get chickens. if so,
ours..."

"agafea mihalovna and i will see about it," and varenka vanished with
her.

"maman, heâ€™ll do everything; he has agreed to everything," kitty said,
angry with her mother for appealing to sergey ivanovitch to judge in
such a matter.

in the middle of their conversation they heard the snorting of horses
and the sound of wheels on the gravel. dolly had not time to get up to
go and meet her husband, when from the window of the room below, where
grisha was having his lesson, levin leaped out and helped grisha out
after him.

"itâ€™s stiva!" levin shouted from under the balcony. "weâ€™ve finished,
dolly, donâ€™t be afraid!" he added, and started running like a boy to
meet the carriage.

"_is ea id, ejus, ejus, ejus!_" shouted grisha, skipping along the
avenue.

"and some one else too! papa, of course!" cried levin, stopping at the
entrance of the avenue. "kitty, donâ€™t come down the steep staircase, go
round."

but levin had been mistaken in taking the person sitting in the carriage
for the old prince. as he got nearer to the ca

work on the estate had seemed to him so important as at that moment.
"itâ€™s all holiday for them," he thought; "but these are no holiday

chapter 7


levin came back to the house only when they sent to summon him to
supper. on the stairs were standing kitty and agafea mihalovna,
consulting about wines for supper.

"but why are you making all this fuss? have what we usually do."

"no, stiva doesnâ€™t drink ... kostya, stop, whatâ€™s the matter?" kitty
began, hurrying after him, but he strode ruthlessly away to the dining
room without waiting for her, and at once joined in the lively general
conversation which was being maintained there by vassenka veslovsky and
stepan arkadyevitch.

"well, what do you say, are we going shooting tomorrow?" said stepan
arkadyevitch.

"please, do letâ€™s go," said veslovsky, moving to another chair, where he
sat down sideways, with one fat leg crosse

d under him.

"i shall be delighted, we will go. and have you had any shooting yet
this year?" said levin to veslovsky, looking intently at his leg, but
speaking with that forced amiability that kitty knew so well in him, and
that was so out of keeping with him. "i canâ€™t answer for our finding
grouse, but there are plenty of snipe. only we ought to start early.
youâ€™re not tired? arenâ€™t you tired, stiva?"

"me tired? iâ€™ve never been tired yet. suppose we stay up all night.
letâ€™s go for a walk!"

"yes, really, letâ€™s not go to bed at all! capital!" veslovsky chimed in.

"oh, we all know you can do without sleep, and keep other people up
too," dolly said to her husband, with that faint note of irony in her
voice which she almost always had now with her husband. "but to my
thinking, itâ€™s time for bed now.... iâ€™m going, i donâ€™t want supper."

"no, do stay a little, dolly," said stepan a

"she wonâ€™t scare them," answered levin, sympathizing with his bitchâ€™s
pleasure and hurrying after her.

as she came nearer and nearer to the familiar breeding places there was
more and more earnestness in laskaâ€™s exploration. a little marsh bird
did not divert her attention for more than an instant. she made one
circuit round the clump of reeds, was beginning a second, and suddenly
quivered with excitement and became motionless.

"come, come, stiva!" shouted levin, feeling his heart beginning to beat
more violently; and all of a sudden, as though some sort of shutter had
been drawn back from his straining ears, all sounds, confused but loud,
began to beat on his hearing, losing all sense of distance. he heard the
steps of stepan arkadyevitch, mistaking them for the tramp of the horses
in the distance; he heard the brittle sound of the twigs on which he had
trodden, taking this sound for the flying of a grouse. he heard too, not

after he began snoring himself, and everything was still. he could only
hear the snort of the horses, and the guttural cry of a snipe.

"is it really only negative?" he repeated to himself. "well, what of it?
itâ€™s not my fault." and he began thinking about the next day.

"tomorrow iâ€™ll go out early, and iâ€™ll make a point of keeping cool.
there are lots of snipe; and there are grouse too. when i come back
thereâ€™ll be the note from kitty. yes, stiva may be right, iâ€™m not manly
with her, iâ€™m tied to her apron-strings.... well, it canâ€™t be helped!

half asleep, he heard the laughter and mirthful talk of veslovsky and
stepan arkadyevitch. for an instant he opened his eyes: the moon was up,
and in the open doorway, brightly lighted up by the moonlight, they were
standing talking. stepan arkadyevitch was saying something of the
freshness of one girl, comparing her to a freshly peeled nut, and

"but you are upset about something? what have you come for?" asked
dolly. "whatâ€™s going on there?"

and in the tone of her question levin heard that it would be easy for
him to say what he had meant to say.

"iâ€™ve not been in there, iâ€™ve been alone in the garden with kitty. weâ€™ve
had a quarrel for the second time since ... stiva came."

dolly looked at him with her shrewd, comprehending eyes.

"come, tell me, honor bright, has there been ... not in kitty, but in
that gentlemanâ€™s behavior, a tone which might be unpleasantâ€”not
unpleasant, but horrible, offensive to a husband?"

"you mean, how shall i say.... stay, stay in the corner!" she said to
masha, who, detecting a faint smile in her motherâ€™s face, had been
turning round. "the opinion of the world would be that he is behaving as
young men do behave. _il fait l

husband whoâ€™s a man of the world should only be flattered by it."

"yes, yes," said levin gloomily; "but you noticed it?"

"not only i, but stiva noticed it. just after breakfast he said to me in
so many words, _je crois que veslovsky fait un petit brin de cour Ã 
kitty_."

"well, thatâ€™s all right then; now iâ€™m satisfied. iâ€™ll send him away,"
said levin.

"what do you mean! are you crazy?" dolly cried in horror; "nonsense,
kostya, only think!" she said, laughing. "you can go now to fanny," she
said to masha. "no, if you wish it, iâ€™ll speak to stiva. heâ€™ll take him
away. he can say youâ€™re expecting visitors. altogether he does

nt were succeeded by questions
of the immediate future. she began thinking how she had to get a new
flat in moscow for the coming winter, to renew the drawing room
furniture, and to make her elder girl a cloak. then questions of the
more remote future occurred to her: how she was to place her children in
the world. "the girls are all right," she thought; "but the boys?"

"itâ€™s very well that iâ€™m teaching grisha, but of course thatâ€™s only
because i am free myself now, iâ€™m not with child. stiva, of course,
thereâ€™s no counting on. and with the help of good-natured friends i can
bring them up; but if thereâ€™s another baby coming?..." and the thought
struck her how untruly it was said that the curse laid on woman was that
in sorrow she should bring forth children.

"the birth itself, thatâ€™s nothing; but the months of carrying the
childâ€”thatâ€™s whatâ€™s so intolerable," she thought, picturing to herself
her last pregnancy, and the death of the last baby. and she recalled the

she would have liked to look at herself in the looking
glass. she had a traveling looking glass in her handbag, and she wanted
to take it out; but looking at the backs of the coachman and the swaying
counting house clerk, she felt that she would be ashamed if either of
them were to look round, and she did not take out the glass.

but without looking in the glass, she thought that even now it was not
too late; and she thought of sergey ivanovitch, who was always
particularly attentive to her, of stivaâ€™s good-hearted friend,
turovtsin, who had helped her nurse her children through the scarlatina,
and was in love with her. and there was someone else, a quite young man,
whoâ€”her husband had told her it as a jokeâ€”thought her more beautiful
than either of her sisters. and the most passionate and impossible
romances rose before darya alexandrovnaâ€™s imagination. "anna did quite
right, and certainly i shall never reproach her for it. she is happy,
she makes another person happy, and sheâ€™s n

anna led dolly to her room.

that room was not the smart guest chamber vronsky had suggested, but the
one of which anna had said that dolly would excuse it. and this room,
for which excuse was needed, was more full of luxury than any in which
dolly had ever stayed, a luxury that reminded her of the best hotels
abroad.

"well, darling, how happy i am!" anna said, sitting down in her riding
habit for a moment beside dolly. "tell me about all of you. stiva i had
only a glimpse of, and he cannot tell one about the children. how is my
favorite, tanya? quite a big girl, i expect?"

"yes, sheâ€™s very tall," darya alexandrovna answered shortly, surprised
herself that she should respond so coolly about her children. "we are
having a delightful stay at the levinsâ€™," she added.

"oh, if i had known," said anna, "that you do not despise me!... you
might have all come to us. stivaâ€™s an old friend and a great friend of
alexeyâ€™s, you know," she added,

"oh, i ought to give you a sketch of the company you will meet with us,"
she went on. "iâ€™ll begin with the ladies. princess varvaraâ€”you know her,
and i know your opinion and stivaâ€™s about her. stiva says the whole aim
of her existence is to prove her superiority over auntie katerina

grateful to her. in petersburg there was a moment when a chaperon was
absolutely essential for me. then she turned up. but really she is
good-natured. she did a great deal to alleviate my position. i see you

party in the billiard room, and returned with them to the terrace. there

dolly. "tell me the truth, dolly: isnâ€™t she angry with me?"

"angry? oh, no!" said darya alexandrovna, smiling.

"but she hates me, despises me?"

"oh, no! but you know that sort of thing isnâ€™t forgiven."

"yes, yes," said anna, turning away and looking out of the open window.
"but i was not to blame. and who is to blame? whatâ€™s the meaning of
being to blame? could it have been otherwise? what do you think? could
it possibly have happened that you didnâ€™t become the wife of stiva?"

"really, i donâ€™t know. but this is what i want you to tell me..."

"yes, yes, but weâ€™ve not finished about kitty. is she happy? heâ€™s a very
nice man, they say."

"heâ€™s much more than very nice. i donâ€™t know a better man."

"ah, how glad i am! iâ€™m so glad! much more than very nice," she
repeated.

dolly smiled.

e in them as before.

"for you, for other people," said anna, as though divining her thoughts,
"there may be reason to hesitate; but for me.... you must consider, i am
not his wife; he loves me as long as he loves me. and how am i to keep
his love? not like this!"

she moved her white hands in a curve before her waist with extraordinary
rapidity, as happens during moments of excitement; ideas and memories
rushed into darya alexandrovnaâ€™s head. "i," she thought, "did not keep
my attraction for stiva; he left me for others, and the first woman for
whom he betrayed me did not keep him by being always pretty and lively.
he deserted her and took another. and can anna attract and keep count

table to their new liberal tone.

after dinner several telegrams were sent to people interested in the
result of the election. and stepan arkadyevitch, who was in high good
humor, sent darya alexandrovna a telegram: "nevyedovsky elected by
twenty votes. congratulations. tell people." he dictated it aloud,
saying: "we must let them share our rejoicing." darya alexandrovna,
getting the message, simply sighed over the rouble wasted on it, and
understood that it was an after-dinner affair. she knew stiva had a
weakness after dining for _faire jouer le tÃ©lÃ©graphe._

everything, together with the excellent dinner and the wine, not from
russian merchants, but imported direct from abroad, was extremely
dignified, simple, and enjoyable. the partyâ€”some twentyâ€”had been
selected by sviazhsky from among the more active new liberals, all of
the same way of thinking, who were at the same time clever and well
bred. they drank, also half in jest, to the health of the new marshal of
the province, of th

and by charm could she keep him. and
so, just as before, only by occupation in the day, by morphine at night,
could she stifle the fearful thought of what would be if he ceased to
love her. it is true there was still one means; not to keep himâ€”for that
she wanted nothing more than his loveâ€”but to be nearer to him, to be in
such a position that he would not leave her. that means was divorce and
marriage. and she began to long for that, and made up her mind to agree
to it the first time he or stiva approached her on the subject.

absorbed in such thoughts, she passed five days without him, the five
days that he was to be at the elections.

walks, conversation with princess varvara, visits to the hospital, and,
most of all, readingâ€”reading of one book after anotherâ€”filled up her
time. but on the sixth day, when the coachman came back without him, she
felt that now she was utterly incapable of stifling the thought of him
and of what he was doing there, just at that time her little girl

 said.

"well, if anything happens, i shall be at katavasovâ€™s."

"no, nothing will happen, and donâ€™t think about it. iâ€™m going for a walk
on the boulevard with papa. weâ€™re going to see dolly. i shall expect you
before dinner. oh, yes! do you know that dollyâ€™s position is becoming
utterly impossible? sheâ€™s in debt all round; she hasnâ€™t a penny. we were
talking yesterday with mamma and arseny" (this was her sisterâ€™s husband
lvov), "and we determined to send you with him to talk to stiva. itâ€™s
really unbearable. one canâ€™t speak to papa about it.... but if you and
he..."

"why, what can we do?" said levin.

"youâ€™ll be at arsenyâ€™s, anyway; talk to him, he will tell what we
decided."

"oh, i agree to everything arseny thinks beforehand. iâ€™ll go and see
him. by the way, if i do go to the concert, iâ€™ll go with natalia. well,
good-bye."

on the steps levin was stopped by his old servant kouzma, who had been
with him before his marriage, and now looked after their househol

 the quiet ease with which she held out her little vigorous hand,
introduced him to vorkuev and indicated a red-haired, pretty little girl
who was sitting at work, calling her her pupil, levin recognized and
liked the manners of a woman of the great world, always self-possessed
and natural.

"i am delighted, delighted," she repeated, and on her lips these simple
words took for levinâ€™s ears a special significance. "i have known you
and liked you for a long while, both from your friendship with stiva and
for your wifeâ€™s sake.... i knew her for a very short time, but she left
on me the impression of an exquisite flower, simply a flower. and to
think she will soon be a mother!"

she spoke easily and without haste, looking now and then from levin to
her brother, and levin felt that the impression he was making was good,
and he felt immediately at home, simple and happy with her, as though he
had known her from childhood.

e him, but iâ€™m glad that
this awkwardness is all over," he said, and remembering that by way of
trying not to see him, he had immediately gone to call on anna, he
blushed. "we talk about the peasants drinking; i donâ€™t know which drinks
most, the peasantry or our own class; the peasants do on holidays,
but..."

but kitty took not the slightest interest in discussing the drinking
habits of the peasants. she saw that he blushed, and she wanted to know
why.

"well, and then where did you go?"

"stiva urged me awfully to go and see anna arkadyevna."

and as he said this, levin blushed even more, and his doubts as to
whether he had done right in going to see anna were settled once for
all. he knew now that he ought not to have done so.

kittyâ€™s eyes opened in a curious way and gleamed at annaâ€™s name, but
controlling herself with an effort, she concealed her emotion and
deceived him.

"oh!" was all she said.

"iâ€™m sure you wonâ€™t be angry at my going. stiva begged me to, and dolly

, as a woman she saw something they had in common, which had
made kitty able to love both. yet as soon as he was out of the room, she
ceased to think of him.

one thought, and one only, pursued her in different forms, and refused
to be shaken off. "if i have so much effect on others, on this man, who
loves his home and his wife, why is it _he_ is so cold to me?... not
cold exactly, he loves me, i know that! but something new is drawing us
apart now. why wasnâ€™t he here all the evening? he told stiva to say he
could not leave yashvin, and must watch over his play. is yashvin a
child? but supposing itâ€™s true. he never tells a lie. but thereâ€™s
something else in it if itâ€™s true. he is glad of an opportunity of
showing me that he has other duties; i know that, i submit to that. but
why prove that to me? he wants to show me that his love for me is not to
interfere with his freedom. but i need no proofs, i need love. he ought
to understand all the bitterness of this life for me here in mosc

this life? i am not living, but waiting for an event, which is
continually put off and put off. no answer again! and stiva says he
cannot go to alexey alexandrovitch. and i canâ€™t write again. i can do
nothing, can begin nothing, can alter nothing; i hold myself in, i wait,
inventing amusements for myselfâ€”the english family, writing, readingâ€”but
itâ€™s all nothing but a sham, itâ€™s all the same as morphine. he ought to
feel for me," she said, feeling tears of self-pity coming into her eyes.

she heard vronskyâ€™s abrupt ring and hurriedly dried her tearsâ€”not only
dried her tears, but sat down by a lamp and

e as he had promisedâ€”displeased only, and not on any account
to let him see her distress, and least of all, her self-pity. she might
pity herself, but he must not pity her. she did not want strife, she
blamed him for wanting to quarrel, but unconsciously put herself into an
attitude of antagonism.

"well, youâ€™ve not been dull?" he said, eagerly and good-humoredly, going
up to her. "what a terrible passion it isâ€”gambling!"

"no, iâ€™ve not been dull; iâ€™ve learned long ago not to be dull. stiva has
been here and levin."

"yes, they meant to come and see you. well, how did you like levin?" he
said, sitting down beside her.

"very much. they have not long been gone. what was yashvin doing?"

"he was winningâ€”seventeen thousand. i got him away. he had really
started home, but he went back again, and now heâ€™s losing."

"then what did you stay for?" she asked, suddenly lifting her eyes to
him. the expression of her face was cold and ungracious. "you told stiva

itch was about to go away when korney came in to
announce:

"sergey alexyevitch!"

"whoâ€™s sergey alexyevitch?" stepan arkadyevitch was beginning, but he
remembered immediately.

"ah, seryozha!" he said aloud. "sergey alexyevitch! i thought it was the
director of a department. anna asked me to see him too," he thought.

and he recalled the timid, piteous expression with which anna had said
to him at parting: "anyway, you will see him. find out exactly where he
is, who is looking after him. and stiva ... if it were possible! could
it be possible?" stepan arkadyevitch knew what was meant by that "if it
were possible,"â€”if it were possible to arrange the divorce so as to let
her have her son.... stepan arkadyevitch saw now that it was no good to
dream of that, but still he was glad to see his nephew.

alexey alexandrovitch reminded his brother-in-law that they never spoke
to the boy of his mother, and he begged him not to mention a single word
about her.

r. so itâ€™s really
to be tomorrow?" she said in a cheerful voice; but suddenly her face
changed.

vronskyâ€™s valet came in to ask him to sign a receipt for a telegram from
petersburg. there was nothing out of the way in vronskyâ€™s getting a
telegram, but he said, as though anxious to conceal something from her,
that the receipt was in his study, and he turned hurriedly to her.

"by tomorrow, without fail, i will finish it all."

"from whom is the telegram?" she asked, not hearing him.

"from stiva," he answered reluctantly.

"why didnâ€™t you show it to me? what secret can there be between stiva
and me?"

vronsky called the valet back, and told him to bring the telegram.

"i didnâ€™t want to show it to you, because stiva has such a passion for
telegraphing: why telegraph when nothing is settled?"

"about the divorce?"

"yes; but he says he has not been able to come at anything yet. he has
promised a decisive answer in a day or two. but here it is; read it."

"kitty! kitty, whom vronsky was in love with!" thought anna, "the girl
he thinks of with love. heâ€™s sorry he didnâ€™t marry her. but me he thinks
of with hatred, and is sorry he had anything to do with me."

the sisters were having a consultation about nursing when anna called.
dolly went down alone to see the visitor who had interrupted their
conversation.

"well, so youâ€™ve not gone away yet? i meant to have come to you," she
said; "i had a letter from stiva today."

"we had a telegram too," answered anna, looking round for kitty.

"he writes that he canâ€™t make out quite what alexey alexandrovitch
wants, but he wonâ€™t go away without a decisive answer."

"i thought you had someone with you. can i see the letter?"

"yes; kitty," said dolly, embarrassed. "she stayed in the nursery. she
has been very ill."

"so i heard. may i see the letter?"

"iâ€™ll get it directly. but he doesnâ€™t refuse; on the contrary, stiva has
hopes," said dolly, stopping

soon as she saw annaâ€™s lovely and attractive face, all feeling of
antagonism disappeared.

"i should not have been surprised if you had not cared to meet me. iâ€™m
used to everything. you have been ill? yes, you are changed," said anna.

kitty felt that anna was looking at her with hostile eyes. she ascribed
this hostility to the awkward position in which anna, who had once
patronized her, must feel with her now, and she felt sorry for her.

they talked of kittyâ€™s illness, of the baby, of stiva, but it was
obvious that nothing interested anna.

"i came to say good-bye to you," she said, getting up.

"oh, when are you going?"

but again not answering, anna turned to kitty.

"yes, i am very glad to have seen you," she said with a smile. "i have
heard so much of you from everyone, even from your husband. he came to
see me, and i liked him exceedingly," she said, unmistakably with
malicious intent. "where is he?"

"he has gone back to the country," said kitty, blushing.

freedom, and rapidity of movement, of which she had been deprived during
the months of her pregnancy.

"itâ€™s sergey ivanovitch and katavasov, a professor," she said.

"oh, thatâ€™s a bore in this heat," said the prince.

"no, papa, heâ€™s very nice, and kostyaâ€™s very fond of him," kitty said,
with a deprecating smile, noticing the irony on her fatherâ€™s face.

"oh, i didnâ€™t say anything."

"you go to them, darling," said kitty to her sister, "and entertain
them. they saw stiva at the station; he was quite well. and i must run
to mitya. as ill-luck would have it, i havenâ€™t fed him since tea. heâ€™s
awake now, and sure to be screaming." and feeling a rush of milk, she
hurried to the nursery.

this was not a mere guess; her connection with the child was still so
close, that she could gauge by the flow of her milk his need of food,
and knew for certain he was hungry.

she knew he was crying before she reached the nursery. and he was indeed
crying. she heard him and has
