alive, miss emily had been a tradition, a duty, and a care; a sort of hereditary obligation upon the town, dating from that day in 1894 when colonel sartoris, the mayor--he who fathered the edict that no negro woman should appear on the streets without an apron-remitted her taxes, the dispensation dating from the death of her father on into perpetuity. not that miss emily would have accepted charity. colonel sartoris invented an involved tale to the effect that miss emily's father had loaned money to the town, which the town, as a matter of business, preferred this way of repaying. only a man of colonel sartoris' generation and thought could have in
