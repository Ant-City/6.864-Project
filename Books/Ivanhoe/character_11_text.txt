â€œsaxon or jew,â€ answered the prince, â€œsaxon or jew, dog or hog, what
matters it? i say, name rebecca, were it only to mortify the saxon
churls.â€

a murmur arose even among his own immediate attendants.

â€œthis passes a jest, my lord,â€ said de bracy; â€œno knight here will lay
lance in rest if such an insult is attempted.â€

â€œit is the mere wantonness of insult,â€ said one of the oldest and most
important of prince johnâ€™s followers, waldemar fitzurse, â€œand if your
grace attempt it, cannot but prove ruinous to your projects.â€

â€œi entertained you, sir,â€ said john, reining up his palfrey haughtily,
â€œfor my follower, but not for my counsellor.â€

â€œthose who follow your grace in the paths which you tread,â€ said
waldemar, but speaking in a low voice, â€œacquire the right of
counsellors; for your interest and safety are not more deeply gaged than
their own.â€

from the tone in which this was spoken, john saw the necessity of

â€œbois-guilbert,â€ answered de bracy, â€œis a good lance; but there are
others around these lists, sir prior, who will not fear to encounter
him.â€

â€œsilence, sirs,â€ said waldemar, â€œand let the prince assume his seat.
the knights and spectators are alike impatient, the time advances, and
highly fit it is that the sports should commence.â€

prince john, though not yet a monarch, had in waldemar fitzurse all the
inconveniences of a favourite minister, who, in serving his sovereign,
must always do so in his own way. the prince acquiesced, however,
although his disposition was precisely of that kind which is apt to be
obstinate upon trifles, and, assuming his throne, and being surrounded
by his followers, gave signal to the heralds to proclaim the laws of the
tournament, which were briefly as follows:

first, the five challengers were to undertake all comers.

secondly, any knight proposing to co

prevented by prince john. â€œsilence, sirs!â€ he said; â€œwhat unprofitable
debate have we here?â€

â€œthe victor,â€ said de wyvil, â€œstill waits the pleasure of your
highness.â€

â€œit is our pleasure,â€ answered john, â€œthat he do so wait until we learn
whether there is not some one who can at least guess at his name and
quality. should he remain there till night-fall, he has had work enough
to keep him warm.â€

â€œyour grace,â€ said waldemar fitzurse, â€œwill do less than due honour to
the victor, if you compel him to wait till we tell your highness that
which we cannot know; at least i can form no guess--unless he be one of
the good lances who accompanied king richard to palestine, and who are
now straggling homeward from the holy land.â€

â€œit may be the earl of salisbury,â€ said de bracy; â€œhe is about the same
pitch.â€

â€œsir thomas de multon, the knight of gilsland, rather,â€ said fitzurse;
â€œsalisbury is bigger in the bones.â€

 a whisper arose among the train,
but by whom first suggested could not be ascertained. â€œit might be the
king--it might be richard coeur-de-lion himself!â€

â€œover godâ€™s forbode!â€ said prince john, involuntarily turning at the
same time as pale as death, and shrinking as if blighted by a flash of
lightning; â€œwaldemar!--de bracy! brave knights and gentlemen, remember
your promises, and stand truly by me!â€

â€œhere is no danger impending,â€ said waldemar fitzurse; â€œare you so
little acquainted with the gigantic limbs of your fatherâ€™s son, as
to think they can be held within the circumference of yonder suit
of armour?--de wyvil and martival, you will best serve the prince by
bringing forward the victor to the throne, and ending an error that has
conjured all the blood from his cheeks.--look at him more closely,â€ he
continued, â€œyour highness will see that he wants three inches of king
richardâ€™s height, and twice as much of his shoulder-breadth.

nciliating aliciaâ€™s father waldemar,
of whom he stood in awe, and who had more than once shown himself
dissatisfied during the course of the dayâ€™s proceedings. he had also a
wish to establish himself in the good graces of the lady; for john was
at least as licentious in his pleasures as profligate in his ambition.
but besides all these reasons, he was desirous to raise up against
the disinherited knight (towards whom he already entertained a strong
dislike) a powerful enemy in the person of waldemar fitzurse, who was
likely, he thought, highly to resent the injury done to his daughter, in
case, as was not unlikely, the victor should make another choice.

and so indeed it proved. for the disinherited knight passed the gallery
close to that of the prince, in which the lady alicia was seated in the
full pride of triumphant beauty, and, pacing forwards as slowly as he
had hitherto rode swiftly around the lists, he seemed to exercise his
right of examining the numerous fair faces which adorned that sple

entered the lists. the prince paused a moment beneath the gallery of
the lady alicia, to whom he paid his compliments, observing, at the same
time, to those around him--â€œby my halidome, sirs! if the knightâ€™s feats
in arms have shown that he hath limbs and sinews, his choice hath no
less proved that his eyes are none of the clearest.â€

it was on this occasion, as during his whole life, johnâ€™s misfortune,
not perfectly to understand the characters of those whom he wished to
conciliate. waldemar fitzurse was rather offended than pleased at the
prince stating thus broadly an opinion, that his daughter had been
slighted.

â€œi know no right of chivalry,â€ he said, â€œmore precious or inalienable
than that of each free knight to choose his lady-love by his own
judgment. my daughter courts distinction from no one; and in her own
character, and in her own sphere, will never fail to receive the full
proportion of that which is her due.â€

prince john replied not; but, spurring his horse, as if to g

must see how staffordshire and leicestershire can draw their bows--the
forests of needwood and charnwood must rear good archers.â€

â€œi,â€ said prince john to his attendants, but not in direct reply,--â€œi
will see how he can draw his own; and woe betide him unless his skill
should prove some apology for his insolence!â€

â€œit is full time,â€ said de bracy, â€œthat the â€˜outrecuidanceâ€™ [19] of
these peasants should be restrained by some striking example.â€

waldemar fitzurse, who probably thought his patron was not taking the
readiest road to popularity, shrugged up his shoulders and was silent.
prince john resumed his retreat from the lists, and the dispersion of
the multitude became general.

in various routes, according to the different quarters from which
they came, and in groups of various numbers, the spectators were seen
retiring over the plain. by far the most numerous part streamed towards
the town of ashby, where many of the distinguished persons were lod

â€œfront-de-boeuf must prepare to restore his fief of ivanhoe,â€ said de
bracy, who, having discharged his part honourably in the tournament, had
laid his shield and helmet aside, and again mingled with the princeâ€™s
retinue.

â€œay,â€ answered waldemar fitzurse, â€œthis gallant is likely to reclaim
the castle and manor which richard assigned to him, and which your
highnessâ€™s generosity has since given to front-de-boeuf.â€

â€œfront-de-boeuf,â€ replied john, â€œis a man more willing to swallow three
manors such as ivanhoe, than to disgorge one of them. for the rest,
sirs, i hope none here will deny my right to confer the fiefs of the
crown upon the faithful followers who are around me, and ready to

and were he tenfold our enemy, or the devoted friend of our brother,
which is perhaps the same, his wounds must be looked to--our own
physician shall attend him.â€

a stern smile curled the princeâ€™s lip as he spoke. waldemar fitzurse
hastened to reply, that ivanhoe was already removed from the lists, and
in the custody of his friends.

â€œi was somewhat afflicted,â€ he said, â€œto see the grief of the queen of
love and beauty, whose sovereignty of a day this event has changed into
mourning. i am not a man to be moved by a womanâ€™s lament for her lover,
but this same lady rowena suppressed her sorrow with such dignity of
manner, that it could only be discovered by her folded hands, and her
tearless eye, which trembled as i

john then opened the billet with apparent agitation, which visibly and
greatly increased when he had perused the contents, which were expressed
in these words:

â€œtake heed to yourself for the devil is unchained!â€

the prince turned as pale as death, looked first on the earth, and
then up to heaven, like a man who has received news that sentence of
execution has been passed upon him. recovering from the first effects of
his surprise, he took waldemar fitzurse and de bracy aside, and put
the billet into their hands successively. â€œit means,â€ he added, in a
faltering voice, â€œthat my brother richard has obtained his freedom.â€

â€œthis may be a false alarm, or a forged letter,â€ said de bracy.

â€œit is franceâ€™s own hand and seal,â€ replied prince john.

â€œit is time, then,â€ said fitzurse, â€œto draw our party to a head, either
at york, or some other centrical place. a few days later, and it will be

dressed in the ancient saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome in
itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was
so remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests, that
prince john took great credit to himself with waldemar fitzurse for
refraining from laughter at a sight which the fashion of the day
rendered ridiculous. yet, in the eye of sober judgment, the short close
tunic and long mantle of the saxons was a more graceful, as well as a
more convenient dress, than the garb of the normans, whose under garment
was a long doublet, so loose as to resemble a shirt or waggonerâ€™s frock,
covered by a cloak of scanty dimensions, neither fit to defend the
wearer from cold or from rain, and the only purpose of which appeared

no spider ever took more pains to repair the shattered meshes of his
web, than did waldemar fitzurse to reunite and combine the scattered
members of prince johnâ€™s cabal. few of these were attached to him from
inclination, and none from personal regard. it was therefore necessary,
that fitzurse should open to them new prospects of advantage, and remind
them of those which they at present enjoyed. to the young and wild
nobles, he held out the prospect of unpunished license and uncontrolled
revelry; to the ambitious, that of power, and to the covetous, that of

     king john.--iâ€™ll tell thee what, my friend,
     he is a very serpent in my way;
     and wheresoeâ€™er this foot of mine doth tread,
     he lies before me.--dost thou understand me?
     --king john

there was brave feasting in the castle of york, to which prince john
had invited those nobles, prelates, and leaders, by whose assistance he
hoped to carry through his ambitious projects upon his brotherâ€™s throne.
waldemar fitzurse, his able and politic agent, was at secret work among
them, tempering all to that pitch of courage which was necessary in
making an open declaration of their purpose. but their enterprise was
delayed by the absence of more than one main limb of the confederacy.
the stubborn and daring, though brutal courage of front-de-boeuf; the
buoyant spirits and bold bearing of de bracy; the sagacity, martial
experience, and renowned valour of brian de bois-guilbert, were
important to the success of their c

â€œi have ordered louis winkelbrand, de bracyâ€™s lieutenant, to cause his
trumpet sound to horse, and to display his banner, and to set presently
forth towards the castle of front-de-boeuf, to do what yet may be done
for the succour of our friends.â€

prince johnâ€™s face flushed with the pride of a spoilt child, who has
undergone what it conceives to be an insult. â€œby the face of god!â€
 he said, â€œwaldemar fitzurse, much hast thou taken upon thee! and over
malapert thou wert to cause trumpet to blow, or banner to be raised, in
a town where ourselves were in presence, without our express command.â€

â€œi crave your graceâ€™s pardon,â€ said fitzurse, internally cursing the
idle vanity of his patron; â€œbut when time pressed, and even the loss of
minutes might be fatal, i judged it best to take this much burden upon
me, in a matter of such importance to your graceâ€™s interest.â€

â€œi understand you not,â€ said de bracy. â€œas soon as richardâ€™s return is
blown abroad, he will be at the head of an army, and all is then over
with us. i would counsel you, my lord, either to fly to france or take
the protection of the queen mother.â€

â€œi seek no safety for myself,â€ said prince john, haughtily; â€œthat i
could secure by a word spoken to my brother. but although you, de bracy,
and you, waldemar fitzurse, are so ready to abandon me, i should not
greatly delight to see your heads blackening on cliffordâ€™s gate yonder.
thinkest thou, waldemar, that the wily archbishop will not suffer thee
to be taken from the very horns of the altar, would it make his
peace with king richard? and forgettest thou, de bracy, that robert

earl of essex is gathering his followers? if we had reason to fear these

plagued with a factious priest, and the blood of thomas-a-becket, saint

brito [47] loyal and daring subjects, your names, your spirit, are
extinct! and although reginald fitzurse hath left a son, he hath fallen
off from his fatherâ€™s fidelity and courage.â€

â€œhe has fallen off from neither,â€ said waldemar fitzurse; â€œand since
it may not better be, i will take on me the conduct of this perilous
enterprise. dearly, however, did my father purchase the praise of a
zealous friend; and yet did his proof of loyalty to henry fall far short
of what i am about to afford; for rather would i assail a whole calendar
of saints, than put spear in rest against coeur-de-lion.--de bracy, to
thee i must trust to keep up the spirits of the doubtful, and to guard
prince johnâ€™s person. if you receive such news as i trust

â€œnay, nay,â€ said prince john, impatiently, â€œi promise thee he heard me;
and, besides, i have farther occupation for thee. maurice, come hither;
let me lean on thy shoulder.â€

they walked a turn through the hall in this familiar posture, and prince
john, with an air of the most confidential intimacy, proceeded to say,
â€œwhat thinkest thou of this waldemar fitzurse, my de bracy?--he trusts
to be our chancellor. surely we will pause ere we give an office so high
to one who shows evidently how little he reverences our blood, by his so
readily undertaking this enterprise against richard. thou dost think,
i warrant, that thou hast lost somewhat of our regard, by thy boldly
declining this unpleasing task--but no, maurice! i rather honour thee
for thy virtuous constancy. there are things most necessary to be done,
the perpetrator of which we neither love nor ho

if to grasp the baton of office, and assuming a loftier stride along the
antechamber, â€œthat is indeed a prize worth playing for!â€

de bracy had no sooner left the apartment than prince john summoned an
attendant.

â€œbid hugh bardon, our scout-master, come hither, as soon as he shall
have spoken with waldemar fitzurse.â€

the scout-master arrived after a brief delay, during which john
traversed the apartment with, unequal and disordered steps.

â€œbardon,â€ said he, â€œwhat did waldemar desire of thee?â€

â€œtwo resolute men, well acquainted with these northern wilds, and
skilful in tracking the tread of man and horse.â€

â€œand thou hast fitted him?â€

â€œcome, valiant sir,â€ said wamba, â€œi must be your armourer as well as
your equerry--i have dismounted you, and now i will unhelm you.â€

so saying, with no very gentle hand he undid the helmet of the blue
knight, which, rolling to a distance on the grass, displayed to the
knight of the fetterlock grizzled locks, and a countenance he did not
expect to have seen under such circumstances.

â€œwaldemar fitzurse!â€ he said in astonishment; â€œwhat could urge one of
thy rank and seeming worth to so foul an undertaking?â€

â€œrichard,â€ said the captive knight, looking up to him, â€œthou knowest
little of mankind, if thou knowest not to what ambition and revenge can
lead every child of adam.â€

â€œrevenge?â€ answered the black knight; â€œi never wronged thee--on me thou
hast nought to revenge.â€

on thee thy disobedience to thy father.â€

richardâ€™s eyes sparkled with indignation, but his better nature overcame
it. he pressed his hand against his brow, and remained an instant gazing
on the face of the humbled baron, in whose features pride was contending
with shame.

 of others--but let
us haste to the castle, for richard meditates punishing some of the
subordinate members of the conspiracy, though he has pardoned their
principal.â€

from the judicial investigations which followed on this occasion, and
which are given at length in the wardour manuscript, it appears that
maurice de bracy escaped beyond seas, and went into the service of
philip of france; while philip de malvoisin, and his brother albert, the
preceptor of templestowe, were executed, although waldemar fitzurse, the
soul of the conspiracy, escaped with banishment; and prince john,
for whose behoof it was undertaken, was not even censured by his
good-natured brother. no one, however, pitied the fate of the two
malvoisins, who only suffered the death which they had both well
deserved, by many acts of falsehood, cruelty, and oppression.

briefly after the judicial combat, cedric the saxon was summoned to the
court of richard, which, for the purpose of quieting the counties that
had been disturbed by the
