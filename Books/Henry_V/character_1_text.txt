turning th' accomplishment of many yeeres
into an howre-glasse: for the which supplie,
admit me chorus to this historie;
who prologue-like, your humble patience pray,
gently to heare, kindly to iudge our play.

now all the youth of england are on fire,
and silken dalliance in the wardrobe lyes:
now thriue the armorers, and honors thought
reignes solely in the breast of euery man.
they sell the pasture now, to buy the horse;
following the mirror of all christian kings,
with winged heeles, as english mercuries.
for now sits expectation in the ayre,
and hides a sword, from hilts vnto the point,
with crownes imperiall, crownes and coronets,
promis'd to harry, and his followers.
