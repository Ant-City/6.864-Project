s.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s the thing mock turtle soup is made from,â€™ said the queen.

â€˜i never saw one, or heard of one,â€™ said alice.

â€˜come on, then,â€™ said the queen, â€˜and he shall tell you his history,â€™

as they walked off together, alice heard the king say in a low voice,
to the company generally, â€˜you are all pardoned.â€™ â€˜come, thatâ€™s a good
thing!â€™ she said to herself, for she had felt quite unhappy at the
number of executions the queen had ordered.

they very soon came upon a gryphon, lying fast asleep in the sun.
(if you donâ€™t know what a gryphon is, look at the picture.) â€˜up, lazy
thing!â€™ said the queen, â€˜and take this young lady to see the mock
turtle, and to hear his history. i must go back and see after some
executions i have orderedâ€™; and she walked off, leaving alice alone with
the gryphon. alice did not quite like the look of the creature, but on
the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go
after that savage queen: so she waited

the gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes: then it watched the queen till
she was out of sight: then it chuckled. â€˜what fun!â€™ said the gryphon,
half to itself, half to alice.

â€˜what is the fun?â€™ said alice.

â€˜why, she,â€™ said the gryphon. â€˜itâ€™s all her fancy, that: they never
executes nobody, you know. come on!â€™

â€˜everybody says â€œcome on!â€ here,â€™ thought alice, as she went slowly
after it: â€˜i never was so ordered about in all my life, never!â€™

they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance,
sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and, as they came
nearer, alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break. she
pitied him deeply. â€˜what is his sorrow?â€™ she asked the gry

phon, and the
gryphon answered, very nearly in the same words as before, â€˜itâ€™s all his
fancy, that: he hasnâ€™t got no sorrow, you know. come on!â€™

so they went up to the mock turtle, who looked at them with large eyes
full of tears, but said nothing.

â€˜this here young lady,â€™ said the gryphon, â€˜she wants for to know your
history, she do.â€™

â€˜iâ€™ll tell it her,â€™ said the mock turtle in a deep, hollow tone: â€˜sit
down, both of you, and donâ€™t speak a word till iâ€™ve finished.â€™

so they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes. alice thought to
herself, â€˜i donâ€™t see how he can even finish, if he doesnâ€™t begin.â€™ but
she waited patiently.

â€˜once,â€™ said the mock turtle at last, with a deep sigh, â€˜i was a real
turtle.â€™

these words were followed by a very lo
 
 ___________________________
 
ng silence, broken only by an
occasional exclamation of â€˜hjckrrh!â€™ from the gryphon, and the constant
heavy sobbing of the mock turtle. alice was very nearly getting up and
saying, â€˜thank you, sir, for your interesting story,â€™ but she could
not help thinking there must be more to come, so she sat still and said
nothing.

â€˜when we were little,â€™ the mock turtle went on at last, more calmly,
though still sobbing a little now and then, â€˜we went to school in the
sea. the master was an old turtle--we used to call him tortoise--â€™

â€˜why did you call him tortoise, if he w

asnâ€™t one?â€™ alice asked.

â€˜we called him tortoise because he taught us,â€™ said the mock turtle
angrily: â€˜really you are very dull!â€™

â€˜you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question,â€™
added the gryphon; and then they both sat silent and looked at poor
alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth. at last the gryphon said
to the mock turtle, â€˜drive on, old fellow! donâ€™t be all day about it!â€™
and he went on in these words:

â€˜yes, we went to school in the sea, though you maynâ€™t believe it--â€™

â€˜i never said i didnâ€™t!â€™ interrupted alice.

â€˜you did,â€™ said the mock turtle.

â€˜hold your tongue!â€™ added the gryphon, before alice could speak again.
the mock turtle went on.

â€˜we had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school every day--â€™

â€˜iâ€™ve been to a day-school, too,â€™ sai

 have wanted it much,â€™ said alice; â€˜living at the bottom of
the sea.â€™

â€˜i couldnâ€™t afford to learn it.â€™ said the mock turtle with a sigh. â€˜i
only took the regular course.â€™

â€˜what was that?â€™ inquired alice.

â€˜reeling and writhing, of course, to begin with,â€™ the mock turtle
replied; â€˜and then the different branches of arithmetic--ambition,
distraction, uglification, and derision.â€™

â€˜i never heard of â€œuglification,â€â€™ alice ventured to say. â€˜what is it?â€™

the gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise. â€˜what! never heard of
uglifying!â€™ it exclaimed. â€˜you know what to beautify is, i suppose?â€™

â€˜yes,â€™ said alice doubtfully: â€˜it means--to--make--anything--prettier.â€™

â€˜well, then,â€™ the gryphon went on, â€˜if you donâ€™t know what to uglify is,
you are a simpleton.â€™

alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about it, so she
turned to the mock turtle, and said â€˜what else had you to learn?â€™

â€˜well, there was mystery,â€™ 
 
 ___________________________
 
the mock turtle replied, counting off
the subjects on his flappers, â€˜--mystery, ancient and modern, with
seaography: then drawling--the drawling-master was an old conger-eel,
that used to come once a week: he taught us drawling, stretching, and
fainting in coils.â€™

â€˜what was that like?â€™ said alice.

â€˜well, i canâ€™t show it you myself,â€™ the mock turtle said: â€˜iâ€™m too
stiff. and the gryphon never learnt it.â€™

â€˜hadnâ€™t time,â€™ said the gryphon: â€˜i went to the classics master, though.
he was an old crab, he was.â€™

â€˜i never went to him,â€™ the mock turtle said with a sigh: â€˜he taught
laughing and grief, they used to say.â€™

â€˜so he did, so he did,â€™ said the gryphon, sighing in his turn; and both
creatures hid their faces in their paws.

â€˜and how many hours a day did you do lessons?â€™ said alice, in a hurry to
change the subject.

â€˜ten hours the first day,â€™ said the mock turtle: â€˜nine the next, and so
on.â€™

â€˜wha
 
 ___________________________
 
t a curious plan!â€™ exclaimed alice.

â€˜thatâ€™s the reason theyâ€™re called lessons,â€™ the gryphon remarked:
â€˜because they lessen from day to day.â€™

this was quite a new idea to alice, and she thought it over a little
before she made her next remark. â€˜then the eleventh day must have been a
holiday?â€™

â€˜of course it was,â€™ said the mock turtle.

â€˜and how did you manage on the twelfth?â€™ alice went on eagerly.

â€˜thatâ€™s enough about lessons,â€™ the gryphon interrupted in a very decided
tone: â€˜tell her something about the games now.â€™




chapter x. the lobster quadrille

the mock turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper across
his eyes. he looked at alice, and tried to speak, but for a minute or
two sobs choked his voice. â€˜same as if he had a bone in his throat,â€™
said the gryphon: and it set to work shaking him and punching him in
the back. at last the mock turtle recovered his voice, and, with tears
running down his cheeks,

he went on again:--

â€˜you may not have lived much under the sea--â€™ [â€˜i havenâ€™t,â€™ said
alice)--â€˜and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--â€™
(alice began to say â€˜i once tasted--â€™ but checked herself hastily, and
said â€˜no, neverâ€™) â€˜--so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a
lobster quadrille is!â€™

â€˜no, indeed,â€™ said alice. â€˜what sort of a dance is it?â€™

â€˜why,â€™ said the gryphon, â€˜you first form into a line along the
sea-shore--â€™

â€˜two lines!â€™ cried the mock turtle. â€˜seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when youâ€™ve cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--â€™

â€˜that generally takes some time,â€™ interrupted the gryphon.

â€˜--you advance twice--â€™

â€˜each with a lobster as a partner!â€™ cried the gryphon.

â€˜of course,â€™ the mock turtle said: â€˜advance twice, set to partners--â€™

â€˜--change lobsters, and retire in same order,â€™ continued the

 gryphon.

â€˜then, you know,â€™ the mock turtle went on, â€˜you throw the--â€™

â€˜the lobsters!â€™ shouted the gryphon, with a bound into the air.

â€˜--as far out to sea as you can--â€™

â€˜swim after them!â€™ screamed the gryphon.

â€˜turn a somersault in the sea!â€™ cried the mock turtle, capering wildly
about.

â€˜change lobsters again!â€™ yelled the gryphon at the top of its voice.

â€˜back to land again, and thatâ€™s all the first figure,â€™ said the mock
turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures, who had been
jumping about like mad things all this time, sat down again very sadly
and quietly, and looked at alice.

â€˜it must be a very pretty dance,â€™ said alice timidly.

â€˜would you like to see a little of it?â€™ said the mock turtle.

â€˜very much indeed,â€™ said alice.

â€˜come, letâ€™s try the first figure!â€™ said the mock

turtle to the gryphon.
â€˜we can do without lobsters, you know. which shall sing?â€™

â€˜oh, you sing,â€™ said the gryphon. â€˜iâ€™ve forgotten the words.â€™

so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice, every now and
then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and waving their
forepaws to mark the time, while the mock turtle sang this, very slowly
and sadly:--

 â€˜â€œwill you walk a little faster?â€ said a whiting to a snail.
 â€œthereâ€™s a porpoise close behind us, and heâ€™s treading on my tail.

 see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
 they are waiting on the shingle--wi

e mock turtle, â€˜but if youâ€™ve
seen them so often, of course you know what theyâ€™re like.â€™

â€˜i believe so,â€™ alice replied thoughtfully. â€˜they have their tails in
their mouths--and theyâ€™re all over crumbs.â€™

â€˜youâ€™re wrong about the crumbs,â€™ said the mock turtle: â€˜crumbs would all
wash off in the sea. but they have their tails in their mouths; and the
reason is--â€™ here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyes.--â€˜tell her
about the reason and all that,â€™ he said to the gryphon.

â€˜the reason is,â€™ said the gryphon, â€˜that they would go with the lobsters
to the dance. so they got thrown out to sea. so they had to fall a long
way. so they got their tails fast in their mouths. so they couldnâ€™t get
them out again. thatâ€™s all.â€™

â€˜thank you,â€™ said alice, â€˜itâ€™s very interesting. i never knew so much
about a whiting before.â€™

â€˜i can tell you more than that, if you like,â€™ said the gryphon. â€˜do you
know why itâ€™s called a whiting?â€™

â€˜i never thoug

ht about it,â€™ said alice. â€˜why?â€™

â€˜it does the boots and shoes.â€™ the gryphon replied very solemnly.

alice was thoroughly puzzled. â€˜does the boots and shoes!â€™ she repeated
in a wondering tone.

â€˜why, what are your shoes done with?â€™ said the gryphon. â€˜i mean, what
makes them so shiny?â€™

alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she gave her
answer. â€˜theyâ€™re done with blacking, i believe.â€™

â€˜boots and shoes under the sea,â€™ the gryphon went on in a deep voice,
â€˜are done with a whiting. now you know.â€™

â€˜and what are they made of?â€™ alice asked in a tone of great curiosity.

â€˜soles and eels, of course,â€™ the gryphon replied rather impatiently:
â€˜any shrimp could have told you that.â€™

â€˜if iâ€™d been the whiting,â€™ said alice, whose thoughts were still running
on the song, â€˜iâ€™d have said to the porpoise, â€œkeep back, please: we
donâ€™t want you with us!â€â€™

â€˜they were obliged to have him with them,â€™ th

e mock turtle said: â€˜no
wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.â€™

â€˜wouldnâ€™t it really?â€™ said alice in a tone of great surprise.

â€˜of course not,â€™ said the mock turtle: â€˜why, if a fish came to me, and
told me he was going a journey, i should say â€œwith what porpoise?â€â€™

â€˜donâ€™t you mean â€œpurposeâ€?â€™ said alice.

â€˜i mean what i say,â€™ the mock turtle replied in an offended tone. and
the gryphon added â€˜come, letâ€™s hear some of your adventures.â€™

â€˜i could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,â€™ said
alice a little timidly: â€˜but itâ€™s no use going back to yesterday,
because i was a different person then.â€™

â€˜explain all that,â€™ said the mock turtle.

â€˜no, no! the adventures first,â€™ said the gryphon in an impatient tone:
â€˜explanations take such a dreadful time.â€™

so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first
saw the white ra

was a little nervous about it just at first,
the two creatures got so close to her, one on each side, and opened
their eyes and mouths so very wide, but she gained courage as she went
on. her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about
her repeating â€˜you are old, father william,â€™ to the caterpillar, and the
words all coming different, and then the mock turtle drew a long breath,
and said â€˜thatâ€™s very curious.â€™

â€˜itâ€™s all about as curious as it can be,â€™ said the gryphon.

â€˜it all came different!â€™ the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully. â€˜i
should like to hear her try and repeat something now. tell her to
begin.â€™ he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of
authority over alice.

â€˜stand up and repeat â€œâ€˜tis the voice of the sluggard,â€â€™ said the
gryphon.

â€˜how the creatures order one about, and make one repeat lessons!â€™
thought alice; â€˜i might as well be at school at once.â€™ however, she
got up, and began to repeat it, but

â€˜thatâ€™s different from what i used to say when i was a child,â€™ said the
gryphon.

â€˜well, i never heard it before,â€™ said the mock turtle; â€˜but it sounds
uncommon nonsense.â€™

alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her hands,
wondering if anything would ever happen in a natural way again.

â€˜i should like to have it explained,â€™ said the mock turtle.

â€˜she canâ€™t explain it,â€™ said the gryphon hastily. â€˜go on with the next
verse.â€™

â€˜but about his toes?â€™ the mock turtle persisted. â€˜how could he turn them
out with his nose, you know?â€™

â

€˜itâ€™s the first position in dancing.â€™ alice said; but was dreadfully
puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the subject.

â€˜go on with the next verse,â€™ the gryphon repeated impatiently: â€˜it
begins â€œi passed by his garden.â€â€™

alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come
wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

  â€˜i passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
  how the owl and the panther were sharing a pie--â€™

    [later editions continued as follows
  the panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
  while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
  when the pie was all finished, the owl, as a boon,

 was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
  while the panther received knife and fork with a growl,
  and concluded the banquet--]

â€˜what is the use of repeating all that stuff,â€™ the mock turtle
interrupted, â€˜if you donâ€™t explain it as you go on? itâ€™s by far the most
confusing thing i ever heard!â€™

â€˜yes, i think youâ€™d better leave off,â€™ said the gryphon: and alice was
only too glad to do so.

â€˜shall we try another figure of the lobster quadrille?â€™ the gryphon went
on. â€˜or would you like the mock turtle to sing you a song?â€™

â€˜oh, a song, please, if the mock turtle would be so kind,â€™ alice
replied, so eagerly that the gryphon said, in a rather offended tone,
â€˜hm! no accounting for tastes! sing her â€œturtle soup,â€ will you, old
fellow?â€™

the mock turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes choked
with sobs, to sing this:--

   â€˜beautiful soup, so rich and green,

â€˜chorus again!â€™ cried the gryphon, and the mock turtle had just begun
to repeat it, when a cry of â€˜the trialâ€™s beginning!â€™ was heard in the
distance.

â€˜come on!â€™ cried the gryphon, and, taking alice by the hand, it hurried
off, without waiting for the end of the song.

â€˜what trial is it?â€™ alice panted as she ran; but the gryphon only
answered â€˜come on!â€™ and ran the faster, while more and more faintly
came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the melancholy words:--

   â€˜soo--oop of the e--e--evening,

(she was obliged to say â€˜creatures,â€™ you see, because some of them were
animals, and some were birds,) â€˜i suppose they are the jurors.â€™ she said
this last word two or three times over to herself, being rather proud of
it: for she thought, and rightly too, that very few little girls of her
age knew the meaning of it at all. however, â€˜jury-menâ€™ would have done
just as well.

the twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates. â€˜what are they
doing?â€™ alice whispered to the gryphon. â€˜they canâ€™t have anything to put
down yet, before the trialâ€™s begun.â€™

â€˜theyâ€™re putting down their names,â€™ the gryphon whispered in reply, â€˜for
fear they should forget them before the end of the trial.â€™

â€˜stupid things!â€™ alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but she stopped
hastily, for the white rabbit cried out, â€˜silence in the court!â€™ and the
king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round, to make out who
was talking.

alice could see, as well as if she we

of her little sisterâ€™s dream.

the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by--the
frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the duchessâ€™s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the
lizardâ€™s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock
turtle.

so she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and all
would change to dull reality--the grass would be only rustling in the
wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the reeds--the rattling
teacups would change to tinkling sheep-bells, and the quee

nâ€™s shrill
cries to the voice of the shepherd boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the
shriek of the gryphon, and all the other queer noises, would change (she
knew) to the confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing
of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtleâ€™s
heavy sobs.

lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers
would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how she would
keep, through all her riper years, the simple and loving heart of her
childhood: and how she would gather about her other little children, and
make their
