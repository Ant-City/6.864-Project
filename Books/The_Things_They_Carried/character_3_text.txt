they  carried  jungle  bootsâ€”2.1  poundsâ€”and  dave  jensen  carried  three
pairs  of  socks  and  a  can  of  dr.  scholl's  foot  powder  as  a  precaution
against  trench  foot.  until  he  was  shot,  ted  lavender  carried  6  or  7
ounces  of  premium  dope,  which  for  him  was  a  necessity.  mitchell
sanders, the rto, carried condoms. norman bowker carried a diary. rat
kiley carried comic books. kiowa, a devout baptist, carried an illustrated
new testament that had been presented to him by his father, who taught
sunday  school  in  oklahoma  city,  oklahoma.  as  a  hedge  against  bad 
times,  however,  kiowa  also  carried  his  grandmother's  distrust  of  the
white  man,  his  grandfather's  old  hunting  hatchet.  necessity  dictated.
because  the  land  was  mined  and  booby-trapped,  it  was  sop  for  each
man to carry a steel-centered, nylon-covered flak jacket, which weighed
6.7

except for the ammunition, which was heavy. a single round weighed 10
ounces.  the  typical  load  was  25  rounds.  but  ted  lavender,  who  was
scared, carried 34 rounds when he was shot and killed outside than khe,
and he went down under an exceptional burden, more than 20 pounds of
ammunition, plus the flak jacket and helmet and rations and water and
toilet  paper  and  tranquilizers  and  all  the  rest,  plus  the  unweighed  fear.
he was dead weight. there was no twitching or flopping. kiowa, who saw
it  happen,  said  it  was  like  watching  a  rock  fall,  or  a  big  sandbag  or
somethingâ€”just boom, then downâ€”not  like  the  movies  where  the  dead
guy  rolls  around  and  does  fancy  spins  and  goes  ass  over  teakettleâ€”not
like  that,  kiowa  said,  the  poor  bastard  just  flat-fuck  fell.  boom.  down.

the pain. he blamed himself. they stripped off lavender's canteens and

dead  man's  dope  until  the  chopper  came.  lieutenant  cross  kept  to
himself. he pictured martha's smooth young face, thinking he loved her
more  than  anything,  more  than  his  men,  and  now  ted  lavender  was
dead  because  he  loved  her  so  much  and  could  not  stop  thinking  about
her. when the dustoff arrived, they carried lavender aboard. afterward
they  burned  than  khe.  they  marched  until  dusk,  then  dug  their  holes,
and that night kiowa kept explaining how you had to be there, how fast it
was, how the poor guy just dropped like so much concrete. boom-down,
he said. like cement.


in  addition  to  the  three  standard  weaponsâ€”the  m-60,  m-16,  and  m-

itself,  or  whatever  seemed
appropriate as a means of killing or staying alive. they carried catch-as-

strunk carried a slingshot; a weapon of last resort, he called it. mitchell

feathered  hatchet.  every  third  or  fourth  man  carried  a  claymore
antipersonnel  mineâ€”3.5  pounds  with  its  firing  device.  they  all  carried
fragmentation grenadesâ€”14 ounces each. they all carried at least one m-

on  april  16,  when  lee  strunk  drew  the  number  17,  he  laughed  and

very  still.  not  good,  kiowa  said.  he  looked  at  the  tunnel  opening,  then
out across a dry paddy toward the village of than khe. nothing moved.

burned,  flies  in  his  mouth  and  eyes.  the  boy  wore  black  shorts  and
sandals. at the time of his death he had been carrying a pouch of rice, a
rifle, and three magazines of ammunition.

you want my opinion, mitchell sanders said, there's a definite moral

here.

he put his hand on the dead boy's wrist. he was quiet for a time, as if
counting a pulse, then he patted the stomach, almost affectionately, and
used kiowa's hunting hatchet to remove the thumb.

henry dobbins asked what the moral was.
moral?
you know. moral.
sanders  wrapped  the  thumb  in  toilet  paper  and  handed  it  across  to
norman bowker. there was no blood. smiling, he kicked the boy's head,
watched  the  flies  scatter,  and  said,  it's  like  with  that  old  tv  showâ€”

vietnam, all the mysteries and
unknowns, there was at least the single abiding certainty that they would
never be at a loss for things to carry.


after  the  chopper  took  lavender  away,  lieutenant  jimmy  cross  led
his men into the village of than khe. they burned everything. they shot
chickens  and  dogs,  they  trashed  the  village  well,  they  called  in  artillery
and watched the wreckage, then they marched for several hours through
the  hot  afternoon,  and  then  at  dusk,  while  kiowa  explained  how
lavender died, lieutenant cross found himself trembling.

he  tried  not  to  cry.  with  his  entrenching  tool,  which  weighed  5

pounds, he began digging a hole in the earth.

he felt shame. he hated himself. he had loved martha more than his
men,  and  as  a  consequence  lavender  was  now  dead,  and  this  was
something he would have to carry like a stone in his stomach for the rest
of the war.

all  he  could  do  was  dig.  he  used  his  entrenching  tool  like  an

, feeling both love and hate, and then later, when it was full dark,
he sat at the bottom of his foxhole and wept. it went on for a long while.
in part, he was grieving for ted lavender, but mostly it was for martha,
and for himself, because she belonged to another world, which was not
quite  real,  and  because  she  was  a  junior  at  mount  sebastian  college  in
new jersey, a poet and a virgin and uninvolved, and because he realized
she did not love him and never would.




like  cement,  kiowa  whispered  in  the  dark.  i  swear  to  godâ€”boom,

down. not a word.

i've heard this, said norman bowker.
a pisser, you know? still zipping himself up. zapped while zipping.
all right, fine. that's enough.
yeah, but you had to see it, the guy justâ€”
i heard, man. cement. so why not shut the fuck up?
kiowa  shook  his  head  sadly  and  glanced  over  at  the  hole  where
lieutenant  jimmy  cross  sat  watching  the  night.  the  air  was  thick  and
wet.  a  warm  dense  fog  had  settled

  over  the  paddies  and  there  was  the
stillness that precedes rain.

after a time kiowa sighed.
one thing for sure, he said. the lieutenant's in some deep hurt. i mean
that crying jagâ€”the way he was carrying onâ€”it wasn't fake or anything, it
was real heavy-duty hurt. the man cares.

sure, norman bowker said.
say what you want, the man does care.
we all got problems.
not lavender.
no, i guess not, bowker said. do me a favor, though.
shut up?
that's a smart indian. shut up.
shrugging, kiowa pulled off his boots. he wanted to say more, just to
lighten  up  his  sleep,  but  instead  he  opened  his  new  testament  and
arranged  it  beneath  his  head  as  a  pillow.  the  fog  made  things  seem
hollow  and  unattached.  he  tried  not  to  think  about  ted  lavender,  but
then he was thinking how fast it was, no drama, down and dead, and how
it  was  hard  to  feel  anything  except  surprise.  it  seemed  unchristian.  he
wished he could find some great sadness, or even anger,

but the emotion
wasn't there and he couldn't make it happen. mostly he felt pleased to be
alive.  he  liked  the  smell  of  the  new  testament  under  his  cheek,  the
leather  and  ink  and  paper  and  glue,  whatever  the  chemicals  were.  he
liked  hearing  the  sounds  of  night.  even  his  fatigue,  it  felt  fine,  the  stiff
muscles and the prickly awareness of his own body, a floating feeling. he
enjoyed not being dead. lying there, kiowa admired lieutenant jimmy
cross's capacity for grief. he wanted to share the man's pain, he wanted



to  care  as  jimmy  cross  cared.  and  yet  when  he  closed  his  eyes,  all  he
could  think  was  boom-down,  and  all  he  could  feel  was  the  pleasure  of
having his boots off and the fog curling in around him and the damp soil
and the bible smells and the plush comfort of night.

he loved her but he hated her.

no more fantasies, he told himself.
henceforth, when he thought about martha, it would be only to think
that she belonged elsewhere. he would shut down the daydreams. this
was  not  mount  sebastian,  it  was  another  world,  where  there  were  no
pretty  poems  or  midterm  exams,  a  place  where  men  died  because  of
carelessness and gross stupidity. kiowa was right. boom-down, and you
were dead, never partly dead.

briefly,  in  the  rain,  lieutenant  cross  saw  martha's  gray  eyes  gazing

back at him. he understood.

it was very sad, he thought. the things men carried inside. the things

men did or felt they had to do.

he almost nodded at her, but didn't.
instead he went back to his maps. he was now determined to perform
his  duties  firmly  and  without  negligence.  it  wouldn't  help  lavender,  he
knew that, but from this point on he w

many years after the war jimmy cross came to visit me at my home in
massachusetts, and for a full day we drank coffee and smoked cigarettes
and  talked  about  everything  we  had  seen  and  done  so  long  ago,  all  the
things  we  still  carried  through  our  lives.  spread  out  across  the  kitchen
table were maybe a hundred old photographs. there were pictures of rat
kiley and kiowa and mitchell sanders, all of us, the faces incredibly soft
and young. at one point, i remember, we paused over a snapshot of ted
lavender, and after a while jimmy rubbed his eyes and said he'd never
forgiven himself for lavender's death. it was something that would never
go away, he said quietly, and i nodded and told him i felt the same about
certain things. then for a long time neither of us could think of much to
say. the thing to do, we decided, was to forget the coffee and switch to
gin,

kiowa's  moccasins  and  hunting  hatchet.  rat  kiley's  comic  books.  by
midnight we were both a little high, and i decided there was no harm in
asking  about  martha.  i'm  not  sure  how  i  phrased  itâ€”just  a  general
questionâ€”but jimmy cross looked up in surprise. "you writer types," he
said,  "you've  got  long  memories."  then  he  smiled  and  excused  himself
and  went  up  to  the  guest  room  and  came  back  with  a  small  framed
photograph.  it  was  the  volleyball  shot:  mar

enemy  was  visible,  you  could  watch  the  tactics  unfolding  into  larger
strategies. there was a winner and a loser. there were rules.




i'm forty-three years old, and a writer now, and the war has been over
for a long while. much of it is hard to remember. i sit at this typewriter
and  stare  through  my  words  and  watch  kiowa  sinking  into  the  deep
muck of a shit field, or curt lemon hanging in pieces from a tree, and as
i  write  about  these  things,  the  remembering  is  turned  into  a  kind  of

no beginning and no end:


norman bowker lying on his back one night, watching the stars, then
whispering  to  me,  "i'll  tell  you  something,  o'brien.  if  i  could  have  one
wish, anything, i'd wish for my dad to write me a letter and say it's okay
if i don't win any medals. that's all my old man talks about, nothing else.
how he can't wait to see my goddamn medals."

three  of  them  whooping  and  leaping  around  barefoot  while  a  bunch  of
villagers  looked  on  with  a  mixture  of  fascination  and  giggly  horror.
afterward, rat said, "so where's the rain?" and kiowa said, "the earth is
slow,  but  the  buffalo  is  patient,"  and  rat  thought  about  it  and  said,
"yeah, but where's the rain?"

forty-three years old, and the war occurred half a lifetime ago, and yet
the  remembering  makes  it  now.  and  sometimes  remembering  will  lead
to a story, which makes it forever. that's what stories are for. stories are
for joining the past to the future. stories are for those late hours in the
night  when  you  can't  remember  how  you  got  from  where  you  were  to
where  you  are.

it's all exactly true.
it happened, to me, nearly twenty years ago, and i still remember that
trail junction and those giant trees and a soft dripping sound somewhere
beyond the trees. i remember the smell of moss. up in the canopy there
were  tiny  white  blossoms,  but  no  sunlight  at  all,  and  i  remember  the
shadows spreading out under the trees where curt lemon and rat kiley
were  playing  catch  with  smoke  grenades.  mitchell  sanders  sat  flipping
his yo-yo. norman bowker and kiowa and dave jensen were dozing, or
half dozing, and all around us were those ragged green mountains.

except for the laughter things were quiet.
at one point, i remember, mitchell sanders turned and looked at me,
not  quite  nodding,  as  if  to  warn  me  about  something,  as  if  he  already
knew, then after a while he rolled up his yo-yo and moved away.

the rest of us stood in a ragged circle around the baby buffalo. for a
time  no  one  spoke.  we  had  witnessed  something  essential,  something
brand-new and profound, a piece of the world so startling there was not
yet a name for it.

somebody kicked the baby buffalo.
it was still alive, though just barely, just in the eyes.
"amazing,"  dave  jensen  said.  "my  whole  life,  i  never  seen  anything

like it."

"never?"
"not hardly. not once."
kiowa and mitchell sanders picked up the baby buffalo. they hauled it

across the open square, hoisted it up, and dumped it in the village well.

afterward, we sat waiting for rat to get himself together.
"amazing," dave jensen kept saying. "a new wrinkle. i never seen it

before."

foxholes in the yard, the monks did not seem upset or displeased, though
the  younger  one  performed  a  washing  motion  with  his  hands.  no  one
could decide what it meant. the older monk led us into the pagoda. the
place  was  dark  and  cool,  i  remember,  with  crumbling  walls  and
sandbagged  windows  and  a  ceiling  full  of  holes.  "it's  bad  news,"  kiowa

turning  the  pagoda  into  a  little  fortress,  and  then  for  the  next  seven  or
eight days we used the place as a base of operations. it was mostly a very
peaceful time. each morning the two monks brought us buckets of water.

we  soaped  up  and  splashed  one  another.  on  the  second  day  the  older

squatting  quietly  in  the  cool  pagoda,  they  would  help  dobbins
disassemble and clean his machine gun, carefully brushing the parts with
oil.  the  three  of  them  seemed  to  have  an  understanding.  nothing  in
words, just a quietness they shared.

"you  know,"  dobbins  said  to  kiowa  one  morning,  "after  the  war

maybe i'll join up with these guys."

"join how?" kiowa said.
"wear robes. take the pledge."
kiowa thought about it. "that's a new one. i didn't know you were all

that religious."

"well,  i'm  not,"  dobbins  said.  beside  him,  the  two  monks  were
working on the m-60. he watched them take turns running oiled swabs
through the barrel. "i mean, i'm not the churchy type. when i was a little
kid, way back, i used to sit there on sunday counting bricks in the

church wasn't for me. but then in high school, i started to think how i'd
like to be a minister. free house, free car. lots of potlucks. it looked like
a pretty good life."

"you're serious?" kiowa said.
dobbins  shrugged  his  shoulders.  "what's  serious?  i  was  a  kid.  the
thing  is,  i  believed  in  god  and  all  that,  but  it  wasn't  the  religious  part
that interested me. just being nice to people, that's all. being decent."

"right," kiowa said.
"visit sick people, stuff like that. i would've been good at it, too. not
the  brainy  partâ€”not  sermons  and  all  thatâ€”but  i'd  be  okay  with  the
people part."

henry  dobbins  was  silent  for  a  time.  he  smiled  at  the  older  monk,

who was now cleaning the machine gun's trigger assembly.

"but  anyway,"  dobbins  said,  "i  couldn't  ever  be  a  real  minister,
because  you  have  to  be  super  sharp.  upstairs,  i  mean.  it  takes  brains.
you  have  to  explain  some

the  smarts  for  it.  and  there's  the  religious  thing,  too.  all  these  years,
man, i still hate church."

"maybe you'd change," kiowa said.
henry dobbins closed his eyes briefly, then laughed.



"one thing for sure, i'd look spiffy in those robes they wearâ€”just like
friar tuck. maybe i'll do it. find a monastery somewhere. wear a robe
and be nice to people."

"sounds good," kiowa said.
the two monks were quiet as they cleaned and oiled the machine gun.
though they spoke almost no english, they seemed to have great respect
for  the  conversation,  as  if  sensing  that  important  matters  were  being
discussed. the younge

kiowa  lay  on  his  back,  looking  up  at  the  ceiling,  and  for  a  time  he

didn't speak. then he sat up and took a drink from his canteen.

"not  a  minister,"  he  said,  "but  i  do  like  churches.  the  way  it  feels
inside.  it  feels  good  when  you  just  sit  there,  like  you're  in  a  forest  and
everything's really quiet, except there's still this sound you can't hear."

"you ever feel that?"

one eye was shut and the other was a star-shaped hole.

kiowa glanced at the body.
"all  right,  let  me  ask  a  question,"  he  said.  "you  want  to  trade  places

with him? turn it all upside downâ€”you want that? i mean, be honest."

the star-shaped hole was red and yellow. the yellow part seemed to be
getting wider, spreading out at the center of the star. the upper lip and
gum and teeth were gone. the man's head was cocked at a wrong angle,
as if loose at the neck, and the neck was wet with blood.

"think it over," kiowa said.

airplanes  and  helicopters  and  bombs?  it  did  not  seem  possible.  in  the
presence of his father and uncles, he pretended to look forward to doing
his patriotic duty, which was also a privilege, but at night he prayed with
his  mother  that  the  war  might  end  soon.  beyond  anything  else,  he  was
afraid of disgracing himself, and therefore his family and village. but all
he  could  do,  he  thought,  was  wait  and  pray  and  try  not  to  grow  up  too
fast.

"listen to me," kiowa said. "you feel terrible, i know that."
then he said, "okay, maybe i don't know."
along  the  trail  there  were  small  blue  flowers  shaped  like  bells.  the
young man's head was wrenched sideways, not quite facing the flowers,
and  even  in  the  shade  a  single  blade  of  sunlight  sparkled  against  the
buckle  of  his  ammunition  belt.  the  left  cheek  was  peeled  back  in  three
ragged  strips.  the  wounds  at  his  neck  had  not  yet  clotted,  which  made

kiowa shook his head.
there was some silence before he said, "stop staring."
the young man's fingernails were clean. there was a slight tear at the
lobe of one ear, a sprinkling of blood on the forearm. he wore a gold ring
on  the  third  finger  of  his  right  hand.  his  chest  was  sunken  and  poorly
muscledâ€”a  scholar,  maybe.  his  life  was  now  a  constellation  of
possibilities. so, yes, maybe a scholar. and for years, despite his family's
poverty,  the  man  i  killed  would  have  been

 waited.
and as he waited, in his final year at the university, he fell in love with a
classmate, a girl of seventeen, who one day told him that his wrists were
like  the  wrists  of  a  child,  so  small  and  delicate,  and  who  admired  his
narrow waist and the cowlick that rose up like a bird's tail at the back of
his  head.  she  liked  his  quiet  manner;  she  laughed  at  his  freckles  and
bony legs. one evening, perhaps, they exchanged gold rings.

now one eye was a star.
"you okay?" kiowa said.
the body lay almost entirely in shade. there were gnats at the mouth,
little flecks of pollen drifting above the nose. the butterfly was gone. the
bleeding had stopped except for the neck wounds.

kiowa  picked  up  the  rubber  sandals,  clapping  off  the  dirt,  then  bent
down to search the body. he found a pouch of rice, a comb, a fingernail
clipper, a few soiled piasters, a snapshot of a young woman standing in
front  of  a  parked  motorcycle.  kiowa  placed  these  items  in  his

along with the gray ammunition belt and rubber sandals.

then he squatted down.
"i'll tell you the straight truth," he said. "the guy was dead the second
he stepped on the trail. understand me? we all had him zeroed. a good
killâ€”weapon, ammunition, everything." tiny beads of sweat glistened at
kiowa's forehead. his eyes moved from the sky to the dead man's body to



the  knuckles  of  his  own  hands.  "so  listen,  you  best  pull  your  shit
together. can't just sit here all day."

later he said, "understand?"
then  he  said,  "five  minutes,  tim.  five  more  minutes  and  we're

moving out."

the  one  eye  did  a  funny  twinkling  trick,  red  to  yellow.  his  head  was
wrenched  sideways,  as  if  loose  at  the  neck,  and  the  dead  young  man
seemed  to  be  staring  at  som

the  blood  at  the  neck  had  gone  to  a  deep  purplish  black.  clean
fingernails, clean hairâ€”he had been a soldier for only a single day. after
his years at the university, the man i killed returned with his new wife to
the village of my khe, where he enlisted as a common rifleman with the
48th  vietcong  battalion.  he  knew  he  would  die  quickly.  he  knew  he
would see a flash of light. he knew he would fall dead and wake up in the
stories of his village and people.

kiowa covered the body with a poncho.
"hey,  you're  looking  better,"  he  said.  "no  doubt  about  it.  all  you

needed was timeâ€”some mental r&r."

then he said, "man, i'm sorry."
then later he said, "why not talk about it?"
then he said, "come on, man, talk."
he was a slim, dead, almost dainty young man of about twenty. he lay
with  one  leg  bent  beneath  him,  his  jaw  in  his  throat,  his  face  neither
expressive  nor  inexpressive.  one  eye  was  shut.  the  other  was  a  star-

ambush


when  she  was  nine,  my  daughter  kathleen  asked  if  i  had  ever  killed
anyone. she knew about the war; she knew i'd been a soldier. "you keep
writing  these  war  stories,"  she  said,  "so  i  guess  you  must've  killed
somebody."  it  was  a  difficult  moment,  but  i  did  what  seemed  right,
which was to say, "of course not," and then to take her onto my lap and



hold her for a while. someday, i hope, she'll ask again. but here i want to

 somethingâ€”and  as  he  passed  me  on  the  trail  i  threw  a
grenade that exploded at his feet and killed him.

or to go back:
shortly after midnight we moved into the ambush site outside my khe.
the  whole  platoon  was  there,  spread  out  in  the  dense  brush  along  the
trail,  and  for  five  hours  nothing  at  all  happened.  we  were  working  in
two-man  teamsâ€”one  man  on  guard  while  the  other  slept,  switching  off
every two hoursâ€”and i remember it was still dark when kiowa shook me
awake for the final watch. the night was foggy and hot. for the first few
moments i felt lost, not sure about directions, groping for my helmet and
weapon.  i  reached  out  and  found  three  grenades  and  lined  them  up  in
front of me; the pins had already been straightened for quick throwing.
and  then  for  maybe  half  an  hour  i  kneeled  there  and  waited.  very
gradually, in tiny slivers, dawn began to break through the fog, and from
my position in the brush i could see te

should wake up kiowa and ask for some repellent, then thinking it was a
bad idea, then looking up and seeing the young man come out of the fog.
he wore black clothing and rubber sandals and a gray ammunition belt.
his  shoulders  were  slightly  stooped,  his  head  cocked  to  the  side  as  if
listening for something. he seemed at ease. he carried his weapon in one
hand, muzzle down, moving without any hurry up the center of the trail.
there  was  no  sound  at  allâ€”none  that  i  can  remember.  in  a  way,  i

his rubber sandals had been blown off. there was no wind. he lay at the
center  of  the  trail,  his  right  leg  bent  beneath  him,  his  one  eye  shut,  his
other eye a huge star-shaped hole.

it  was  not  a  matter  of  live  or  die.  there  was  no  real  peril.  almost
certainly the young man would have passed by. and it will always be that
way.

later, i remember, kiowa tried to tell me that the man would've died
anyway. he told me that it was a good kill, that i was a soldier and this
was a war, that i should shape up and stop staring and ask myself what
the dead man would' ve done if things were reversed.

none of it mattered. the words seemed far too complicated. all i could

do was gape at the fact of the young man's body.

other times i don't. in the ordinary hours of life i try not t

and silver flares, all colors, and the rain came down in technicolor.

the field was boiling. the shells made deep slushy craters, opening up
all  those  years  of  waste,  centuries  worth,  and  the  smell  came  bubbling
out of the earth. two rounds hit close by. then a third, even closer, and
immediately,  off  to  his  left,  he  heard  somebody  screaming.  it  was

he knew the voice. a strange gargling noise. rolling sideways, he crawled
toward the screaming in the dark. the rain was hard and steady. along
the  perimeter  there  were  quick  bursts  of  gunfire.  another  round  hit
nearby,  spraying  up  shit  and  water,  and  for  a  few  moments  he  ducked
down beneath the mud. he heard the valves in his heart. he heard the
quick, feathering action of the hinges.

he would've talked about this, and how he grabbed kiowa by the boot
and tried to pull him out. he pulled hard but kiowa was gone, and then
suddenly he felt himself going, too. he could taste it. the shit was in his
nose and eyes. there were flares and mortar rounds, and the stink was
everywhereâ€”it  was  inside  him,  in  his  lungsâ€”and  he  could  no  longer
tolerate it. not here, he thought. not like this. he released kiowa's boot
and  watched  it  slide  away.  slowly,  working  his  way  up,  he  hoisted
himself out of the deep mud, and then he lay still and tasted the shit in
his mouth and closed his eyes and listened to the rain and explosions and
bubbling sounds.
he was alone.
he had lost his weapon but it did not matter. all he wanted was a bath.
nothing else. a hot soapy bath.
circling the lake, norman bowker remembered how his friend kiowa

had disappeared under the waste and water.

on  his  eleventh  revolution  he  switched  off  the  air-conditioning,
opened  up  his  window,  and  rested  his  elbow  comfortably  on  the  sill,
driving with one hand.

there was nothing to say.
he could not talk about it and never would. the evening was smooth

and warm.

if it had been possible, which it wasn't, he would have explained how
his friend kiowa slipped away that night beneath the dark swampy field.
he was folded in with the war; he was part of the waste.

turning  on  his  headlights,  driving  slowly,  norman  bowker
remembered how he had taken hold of kiowa's boot and pulled hard, but
how the smell was simply too much, and how he'd backed off and in that
way had lost the silver star.

he wished he could've explained some of this. how he had been braver

thing real or tangible at stake, certainly not the stakes of
a war. he dropped out after eight months. he spent his mornings in bed.
in the afternoons he played pickup basketball at the y, and then at night
he drove around town in his father's car, mostly alone, or with a six-pack
of beer, cruising.

"the thing is," he wrote, "there's no place to go. not just in this lousy
little town. in general. my life, i mean. it's almost like i got killed over in
nam . . . hard to describe. that night when kiowa got wasted, i sort of
sank down into the sewage with him . . . feels like i'm still in deep shit."

the letter covered seventeen handwritten pages, its tone jumping from
self-pity  to  anger  to  irony  to  guilt  to  a  kind  of  feigned  indifference.  he
didn't  know  what  to  feel.  in  the  middle  of  the  letter,  for  example,  he
reproached himself for complaining too much:

god,  this  is  starting  to  sound  like  some  jerkoff  vet  crying  in  his  beer.

words,  if  you  know  what  i  mean,  and  i  can't  figure  out  what  exactly  to

norman  bowker's  letter  hit  me  hard.  for  years  i'd  felt  a  certain
smugness  about  how  easily  i  had  made  the  shift  from  war  to  peace.  a
nice smooth glideâ€”no flashbacks or midnight sweats. the war was over,
after  all.  and  the  thing  to  do  was  go  on.  so  i  took  pride  in  sliding

few hundred miles south and
transplanted it onto the iowa prairie.

the  writing  went  quickly  and  easily.  i  drafted  the  piece  in  a  week  or
two,  fiddled  with  it  for  another  week,  then  published  it  as  a  separate
short story.

almost immediately, though, there was a sense of failure. the details
of norman bowker's story were missing. in this original version, which i
still conceived as part of the novel, i had been forced to omit the shit field
and the rain and the death of kiowa, replacing this material with events
that better fit the book's narrative. as a consequence i'd lost the natural



counterpoint  between  the  lake  and  the  field.  a  metaphoric  unity  was
broken. what the piece needed, and did not have, was the terrible killing
power of that shit field.

as  the  novel  developed  over  the  next  year,  and  as  my  own  ideas
clarified, it became apparent that the chapter had no proper home in the
larger  narrative.  going  after  cacciato  was  a  war

full and exact truth about
our night in the shit field.

over the next several months, as it often happens, i managed to erase
the story's flaws from my memory, taking pride in a shadowy, idealized
recollection  of  its  virtues.  when  the  piece  appeared  in  an  anthology  of
short fiction, i sent a copy off to norman bowker with the thought that it
might please him. his reaction was short and somewhat bitter.

"it's  not  terrible,"  he  wrote  me,  "but  you  left  out  vietnam.  where's

kiowa? where's the shit?"

eight months later he hanged himself.
in august of 1978 his mother sent me a brief note explaining what had
happened. he'd been playing pickup basketball at the y; after two hours
he went off for a drink of water; he used a jump rope; his friends found
him hanging from a water pipe. there was no suicide note, no message of
any  kind.  "norman  was  a  quiet  boy,"  his  mother  wrote,  "and  i  don't
suppose he wanted to bother anybody."

norman bowker's silence. and i hope it's a better story.
although  the  old  structure  remains,  the  piece  has  been  substantially
revised, in some places by severe cutting, in other places by the addition
of  new  material.  norman  is  back  in  the  story,  where  he  belongs,  and  i
don't  think  he  would  mind  that  his  real  name  appears.  the  central
incidentâ€”our long night in the shit field along the song tra bongâ€”has
been restored to the piece. it was hard stuff to write. kiowa, after all, had
been a close friend, and for years i've avoided thinking about his death
and my own complicity in it. even here it's not easy. in the interests of



truth,  however,  i  want  to  make  it  clear  that  norman  bowker  was  in  no
way  responsible  for  what  happened  to  kiowa.  norman  did  not
experience a failure of nerve that night. he did not freeze up or lose the
silver star for valor. that part of the story is my own.

en soldiers formed into a loose rank
and began wading side by side through the deep muck of the shit field.
they moved slowly in the rain. leaning forward, heads down, they used
the butts of their weapons as probes, wading across the field to the river
and then turning and wading back again. they were tired and miserable;
all they wanted now was to get it finished. kiowa was gone. he was under
the mud and water, folded in with the war, and their only thought was to
find him and dig him out and then move on to someplace dry and warm.
it  had  been  a  hard  night.  maybe  the  worst  ever.  the  rains  had  fallen
without stop, and the song tra bong had overflowed its banks, and the
muck had now risen thigh-deep in the field along the river. a low, gray
mist hovered over the land. off to the west there was thunder, soft little
moaning  sounds,  and  the  monsoon

eutenant jimmy
cross went first, now and then straightening out the rank, closing up the
gaps.  his  uniform  was  dark  with  mud;  his  arms  and  face  were  filthy.
early in the morning he had radioed in the mia report, giving the name
and  circumstances,  but  he  was  now  determined  to  find  his  man,  no
matter what, even if it meant flying in slabs of concrete and damming up
the river and draining the entire field. he would not lose a member of his
command like this. it wasn't right. kiowa had been a fine soldier and a
fine  human  being,  a  devout  baptist,  and  there  was  no  way  lieutenant
cross would allow such a good man to be lost under the slime of a shit
field.

briefly,  he  stopped  and  watched  the  clouds.  except  for  some
occasional thunder it was a deeply quiet morning, just the rain and the
steady sloshing sounds of eighteen men wading through the thick waters.
lieutenant  cross  wished  the  rain  would  let  up.  even  for  an  hour,  it
would make things

erase  identities,  transforming  the  men  into  identical  copies  of  a  single
soldier,  which  was  exactly  how  jimmy  cross  had  been  trained  to  treat
them, as interchangeable units of command. it was difficult sometimes,
but he tried to avoid that sort of thinking. he had no military ambitions.
he  preferred  to  view  his  men  not  as  units  but  as  human  beings.  and
kiowa  had  been  a  splendid  human  being,  the  very  best,  intelligent  and
gentle  and  quiet-spoken.  very  brave,  too.  and  decent.  the  kid's  father
taught sunday school in oklahoma city, where kiowa had been raised to
believe  in  the  promise  of  salvation  under  jesus  christ,  and  this
conviction  had  always  been  present  in  the  boy's  smile,  in  his  posture
toward  the  world,  in  the  way  he  never  went  anywhere  without  an

e from higher, true, but still
he  should've  exercised  some  field  discretion.  he  should've  moved  to
higher ground for the night, should've radioed in false coordinates. there
was  nothing  he  could  do  now,  but  still  it  was  a  mistake  and  a  hideous
waste. he felt sick about it. standing in the deep waters of the field, first
lieutenant jimmy cross began composing a letter in his head to the kid's
father,  not  mentioning  the  shit  field,  just  saying  what  a  fine  soldier
kiowa had been, what a fine human being, and how he was the kind of
son that any father could be proud of forever.


the  search  went  slowly.  for  a  time  the  morning  seemed  to  brighten,
the  sky  going  to  a  lighter  shade  of  silver,  but  then  the  rains  came  back
hard and steady. there was the feel of permanent twilight.

at  the  far  left  of  the  line,  azar  and  norman  bowker  and  mitchell
sanders waded along the edge of the field closest to the river. they were

"fine," said norman bowker. "now pipe down."
azar  sighed.  "wasted  in  the  waste,"  he  said.  "a  shit  field.  you  got  to

admit, it's pure world-class irony."

the  three  men  moved  with  slow,  heavy  steps.  it  was  hard  to  keep
balance.  their  boots  sank  into  the  ooze,  which  produced  a  powerful
downward suction, and with each step they would have to pull up hard to

the story."

"enough," bowker said.
"like those old cowboy movies. one more redskin bites the dirt."
"i'm serious, man. zip it shut."
azar smiled and said, "classic."
the  morning  was  cold  and  wet.  they  had  not  slept  during  the  night,
not  even  for  a  few  moments,  and  all  three  of  them  were  feeling  the
tension  as  they  moved  across  the  field  toward  the  river.  there  was
nothing they could do for kiowa. just find him  and slide him aboard a
chopper. whenever a man died it was always the same, a desire to get it
over with quickly, no fuss or ceremony, and what they wanted now was
to  head  for  a  ville  and  get  under  a  roof  and  forget  what  had  happened
during the night.

halfway  across  the  field  mitchell  sanders  stopped.  he  stood  for  a
moment with his eyes shut, feeling along the bottom with a foot, then he
passed  his  weapon  over  to  norman  bowker  and  reached  down

um frame, but now it had the curious look of
flesh.

"it wasn't the lt's fault," bowker said quietly.
"whose then?"
"nobody's. nobody knew till afterward."
mitchell  sanders  made  a  sound  in  his  throat.  he  hoisted  up  the
rucksack, slipped into the harness, and pulled the straps tight. "all right,
but this much for sure. the man knew it was raining. he knew about the
river. one plus one. add it up, you get exactly what happened." sanders
glared  at  the  river.  "move  it,"  he  said.  "kiowa's  waiting  on  us."  slowly
then,  bending  against  the  rain,  azar  and  norman  bowker  and  mitchell
sanders began wading again through the deep waters, their eyes down,
circling out from where they had found the rucksack.


first lieutenant jimmy cross stood fifty meters away. he had finished
writing  the  letter  in  his  head,  explaining  things  to  kiowa's  father,  and
now he folded his arms and watched his platoon crisscrossing the wide
field. in a funny way, it reminded him of th

earth. it was a dead-fish smell, partly, but something else, too, and then
later  in  the  night  mitchell  sanders  had  crawled  through  the  rain  and
grabbed him hard by the arm and asked what he was doing setting up in
a shit field. the village toilet, sanders said. he remembered the look on
sanders's face. the guy stared for a moment and then wiped his mouth
and whispered, "shit," and then crawled away into the dark.

a stupid mistake. that's all it was, a mistake, but it had killed kiowa.
lieutenant  jimmy  cross  felt  something  tighten  inside  him.  in  the
letter to kiowa's father he would apologize point-blank. just admit to the
blunders.

he  would  place  the  blame  where  it  belonged.  tactically,  he'd  say,  it
was indefensible ground from the start. low and flat. no natural cover.
and so late in the night, when they took mortar fire from across the river,



all they could do was snake down under the slop and lie there and wait.

slop and shrapnel, it all mixed together,
and  the  field  seemed  to  boil.  he  would  explain  this  to  kiowa's  father.
carefully,  not  covering  up  his  own  guilt,  he  would  tell  how  the  mortar
rounds made craters in the slush, spraying up great showers of filth, and
how the craters then collapsed on themselves and filled up with mud and
water,  sucking
things,  weapons  and
entrenching tools and belts of ammunition, and how in this way his son
kiowa had been combined with the waste and the war.

my own fault, he would say.
straightening  up,  first  lieutenant  jimmy  cross  rubbed  his  eyes  and

tried to get his thoughts together. the rain fell in a cold, sad drizzle.

off toward the river he again noticed the young soldier standing alone
at the center of the field. the boy's shoulders were shaking. maybe it was
something  in  the  posture  of  the  soldier,  or  the  way  he  seemed  to  be
reaching  for  som

oo, blamed himself. bent forward at the waist, groping with both
hands,  he  seemed  to  be  chasing  some  creature  just  beyond  reach,
something  elusive,  a  fish  or  a  frog.  his  lips  were  moving.  like  jimmy
cross,  the  boy  was  explaining  things  to  an  absent  judge.  it  wasn't  to
defend himself. the boy recognized his own guilt and wanted only to lay
out the full causes.

wading sideways a few steps, he leaned down and felt along the soft

bottom of the field.

he pictured kiowa's face. they'd been close buddies, the tightest, and
he  remembered  how  last  night  they  had  huddled  together  under  their
ponchos,  the  rain  cold  and  steady,  the  water  rising  to  their  knees,  but
how  kiowa  had  just  laughed  it  off  and  said  they  should  concentrate  on
better things. and so for a long while they'd talked about their families
and hometowns. at one point, the boy remembered, he'd been showing
kiowa  a  picture  of  his  girlfriend.  he  remembered  switc

flashlight. a stupid thing to do, but he did it anyway, and he remembered



kiowa leaning in for a look at the pictureâ€”"hey, she's cute," he'd saidâ€”
and then the field exploded all around them.

like  murder,  the  boy  thought.  the  flashlight  made  it  happen.  dumb

and dangerous. and as a result his friend kiowa was dead.

that simple, he thought.
he wished there were some other way to look at it, but there wasn't.
very  simple  and  very  final.  he  remembered  two  mortar  rounds  hitting
close  by.  then  a  third,  even  closer,  and  off  to  his  left  he'd  heard
somebody  scream.  the  voice  was  ragged  and  clotted  up,  but  he  knew
instantly that it was kiowa.

he  remembered  trying  to  crawl  toward  the  screaming.  no  sense  of
direction,  though,  and  the  field  seemed  to  suck

  him  under,  and
everything  was  black  and  wet  and  swirling,  and  he  couldn't  get  his
bearings, and then another round hit nearby, and for a few moments all
he could do was hold his breath and duck down beneath the water.

later, when he came up again, there were no more screams. there was
an arm and a wristwatch and part of a boot. there were bubbles where
kiowa's head should've been.

he remembered grabbing the boot. he remembered pulling hard, but
how the field seemed to pull back, like a tug-of-war he couldn't win, and
how finally he had to whisper his friend's name and let go and watch the
boot  slide  away.  then  for  a  long  time  there  were  things  he  could  not
remember.  various  sounds,  various  smells.  later  he'd  found  himself
lying on a little rise, face-up, tasting the field in his mouth, listening to
the  rain  and  explosions

and  bubbling  sounds.  he  was  alone.  he'd  lost
everything.  he'd  lost  kiowa  and  his  weapon  and  his  flashlight  and  his
girlfriend's  picture.  he  remembered  this.  he  remembered  wondering  if
he could lose himself.

now,  in  the  dull  morning  rain,  the  boy  seemed  frantic.  he  waded
quickly from spot to spot, leaning down and plunging his hands into the
water. he did not look up when lieutenant jimmy cross approached.

"right here," the boy was saying. "got to be right here."
jimmy  cross  remembered  the  kid's  face  but  not  the  name.  that
happe

ned  sometimes.  he  tried  to  treat  his  men  as  individuals  but
sometimes the names just escaped him.

he watched the young soldier shove his hands into the water. "right

here," he kept saying. his movements seemed random and jerky.



jimmy cross waited a moment, then stepped closer. "listen," he said

quietly, "the guy could be anywhere."
the boy glanced up. "who could?"
"kiowa. you can't expectâ€”"
"kiowa's dead."
"well, yes."
the young soldier nodded. "so what about billie?"
"who?"
"my girl. what about her? this picture, it was the only one i had. right

here, i lost it."

jimmy cross shook his head. it bothered him that he could not come

up with a name.

"slow down," he said, "i don'tâ€”"
"billie's picture. i had it all wrapped up, i had it in plastic, so it'll be
okay if i can . . . last night we were looking at it, me and kiowa. right
here. i know for sure it's right here somewhere."

 the  kid's  weapon  was,  and  his  helmet,  but  it
seemed better not to ask.

he  felt  some  pity  come  on  him.  for  a  moment  the  day  seemed  to
soften. so much hurt, he thought. he watched the young soldier wading
through  the  water,  bending  down  and  then  standing  and  then  bending
down again, as if something might finally be salvaged from all the waste.

jimmy cross silently wished the boy luck.
then  he  closed  his  eyes  and  went  back  to  working  on  the  letter  to

kiowa's father.




across the field azar and norman bowker and mitchell sanders were
wading alongside a narrow dike at the edge of the field. it was near noon
now.

norman  bowker  found  kiowa.  he  was  under  two  feet  of  water.

nothing showed except the heel of a boot.

"that's him?" azar said.
"who else?"
"i don't know." azar shook his head. "i don't know."
norman  bowker  touched  the  boot,  covered  his  eyes  for  a  moment,

then stood up and looked at azar.
"so where's the joke?" he s

aid.
"no joke."
"eating shit. let's hear that one."
"forget it."
mitchell sanders told them to knock it off. the three soldiers moved to
the dike, put down their packs and weapons, then waded back to where
the boot was showing. the body lay partly wedged under a layer of mud
beneath the water. it was hard to get traction; with each movement the
muck  would  grip  their  feet  and  hold  tight.  the  rain  had  come  back
harder  now.  mitchell  sanders  reached  down  and  found  kiowa's  other
boot, and they waited a moment, then sanders sighed and said, "okay,"
and they took hold of the two boots and pulled up hard. there was only a
slight give. they tried again, but this time the body did not move at all.
after the third try they stopped and looked down for a while. "one more
time," norman bowker said. he counted to three and they leaned back
and pulled.

"stuck," said mitchell sanders.
"i see that. christ."
they tried again, then called over henry dobbins and rat kiley, a

all  five  of  them  put  their  arms  and  backs  into  it,  but  the  body  was
jammed in tight.

azar moved to the dike and sat holding his stomach. his face was pale.
the  others  stood  in  a  circle,  watching  the  water,  then  after  a  time
somebody said, "we can't just leave him there," and the men nodded and
got  out  their  entrenching  tools  and  began  digging.  it  was  hard,  sloppy



work. the mud seemed to flow back faster than they could dig, but kiowa
was their friend and they kept at it anyway.

slowly,  in  little  groups,  the  rest  of  the  platoon  drifted  over  to  watch.
only lieutenant jimmy cross and the young soldier were still searching
the field.

"what we should do, i guess," norman bowker said, "is tell the lt."
mitchell  sanders  shook  his  head.  "just  mess  things  up.  besides,  the

man looks happy out there, real content. let him be."

after  ten  minutes  they  uncovered  most  of  kiowa's  lower  body.  the
corpse w
 
 ___________________________
 
as angled steeply into the muck, upside down, like a diver who
had plunged headfirst off a high tower. the men stood quietly for a few
seconds. there was a feeling of awe. mitchell sanders finally nodded and
said,  "let's  get  it  done,"  and  they  took  hold  of  the  legs  and  pulled  up
hard, then pulled again, and after a moment kiowa came sliding to the
surface. a piece of his shoulder was missing; the arms and chest and face
were  cut  up  with  shrapnel.  he  was  covered  with  bluish  green  mud.
"well," henry dobbins said, "it could be worse," and dave jensen said,
"how, man? tell me how." carefully, trying not to look at the body, they
carried kiowa over to the dike and laid him down. they used towels to
clean off the scum. rat kiley went through the kid's pockets, placed his
personal effects in a plastic bag, taped t

he bag to kiowa's wrist, then used
the radio to call in a dustoff.

moving  away,  the  men  found  things  to  do  with  themselves,  some
smoking, some opening up cans of c rations, a few just standing in the
rain.

for all of them it was a relief to have it finished. there was the promise
now  of  finding  a  hootch  somewhere,  or  an  abandoned  pagoda,  where
they could strip down and wring out their fatigues and maybe start a hot
fire.  they  felt  bad  for  kiowa.  but  they  also  felt  a  kind  of  giddiness,  a
secret  joy,  because  they  were  alive,  and  because  even  the  rain  was
preferable  to  being  sucked  under  a  shit  field,  and  because  it  was  all  a
matter of luck and happenstance.

azar sat down on the dike next to norman bowker.
"listen," he said. "those dumb jokesâ€”i didn't mean anything."
"we all say things."
"yeah, but when i saw the guy, it made me feelâ€”i don't knowâ€”like he

was listening."



"he wasn't."
"i guess n
 
 ___________________________
 
ot. but i felt sort of guilty almost, like if i'd kept my mouth

shut none of it would've ever happened. like it was my fault."

norman bowker looked out across the wet field.
"nobody's fault," he said. "everybody's."



near the center of the field first lieutenant jimmy cross squatted in
the  muck,  almost  entirely  submerged.  in  his  head  he  was  revising  the
letter  to  kiowa's  father.  impersonal  this  time.  an  officer  expressing  an
officer's condolences. no apologies were necessary, because in fact it was
one  of  those  freak  things,  and  the  war  was  full  of  freaks,  and  nothing
could ever change it anyway. which was the truth, he thought. the exact
truth.

lieutenant  cross  went  deeper  into  the  muck,  the  dark  water  at  his

throat, and tried to tell himself it was the truth.

beside  him,  a  few  steps  off  to  the  left,  the  young  so

ldier  was  still
searching for his girlfriend's picture. still remembering how he had killed
kiowa.

the boy wanted to confess. he wanted to tell the lieutenant how in the
middle of the night he had pulled out billie's picture and passed it over to
kiowa  and  then  switched  on  the  flashlight,  and  how  kiowa  had
whispered,  "hey,  she's  cute,"  and  how  for  a  second  the  flashlight  had
made billie's face sparkle, and how right then the field had exploded all
around  them.  the  flashlight  had  done  it.  like  a  target  shining  in  the
dark.

the boy looked up at the sky, then at jimmy cross.
"sir?" he said.
the rain and mist moved across the field in broad, sweeping sheets of

gray. close by, there was thunder.

"sir," the boy said, "i got to explain something."
but  lieutenant  jimmy  c

himself  go  deeper  into  the  waste,  just  letting  the  field  take  him.  he  lay
back and floated.

when  a  man  died,  there  had  to  be  blame.  jimmy  cross  understood
this. you could blame the war. you could blame the idiots who made the
war.  you  could  blame  kiowa  for  going  to  it.  you  could  blame  the  rain.



you  could  blame  the  river.  you  could  blame  the  field,  the  mud,  the
climate.  you  could  blame  the  enemy.  you  could  blame  the  mortar
rounds. you could blame people who were too lazy to read a newspaper,
who were bored by the daily body counts, who switched channels at the
mention  of  politics.  you  could  blame  whole  nations.  you  could  blame
god. you could blame the munitions makers or karl marx or a trick of
fate

  a  long  while  jimmy  cross  lay  floating.  in  the  clouds  to  the  east
there was the sound of a helicopter, but he did not take notice. with his
eyes  still  closed,  bobbing  in  the  field,  he  let  himself  slip  away.  he  was
back  home  in  new  jersey.  a  golden  afternoon  on  the  golf  course,  the
fairways lush and green, and he was teeing it up on the first hole. it was a
world without responsibility. when the war was over, he thought, maybe
then he would write a letter to kiowa's father. or maybe not. maybe he
would just take a couple of practice swings and knock the ball down the
middle and pick up his clubs and walk off into the afternoon.

field trip


a  few  months  after  completing  "in  the  field,"  i  returned  with  my
daughter  to  vietnam,  where  we  visited  the  site  of  kiowa's  death,  and
where i looked for signs of forgiveness or personal grace or whatever else
the  land  might  offer.  the  field  was  still  there,  though  not  as  i
remembered  it.  much  smaller,  i  thought,  and  not  nearly  so  menacing,
and in the bright sunlight it was hard to picture what had happened on
this ground some twenty years ago. except for a few marshy spots along
the  river,  everything  was  bone  dry.  no  ghostsâ€”just  a  flat,  grassy  field.
the place was at peace. th

ere were yellow butterflies. there was a breeze
and a wide blue sky. along the river two old farmers stood in ankle-deep
water,  repairing  the  same  narrow  dike  where  we  had  laid  out  kiowa's
body after pulling him from the muck. things were quiet. at one point, i
remember,  one  of  the  farmers  looked  up  and  shaded  his  eyes,  staring
across the field at us, then after a time he wiped his forehead and went
back to work.

i  stood  with  my  arms  folded,  feeling  the  grip  of  sentiment  and  time.

amazing, i thought. twenty years.



behind  me,  in  the  jeep,  my  daughter  kathleen  sat  waiting  with  a
government interpreter, and now and then i could hear the two

,  i'd  arranged
for  the  side  trip  up  to  quang  ngai.  the  tourist  stuff  was  fine,  but  from
the  start  i'd  wanted  to  take  my  daughter  to  the  places  i'd  seen  as  a
soldier. i wanted to show her the vietnam that kept me awake at nightâ€”a
shady  trail  outside  the  village  of  my  khe,  a  filthy  old  pigsty  on  the
batangan peninsula. our time was short, however, and choices had to be
made, and in the end i decided to take her to this piece of ground where
my  friend  kiowa  had  died.  it  seemed  appropriate.  and,  besides,  i  had
business here.

now,  looking  out  at  the  field,  i  wondered  if  it  was  all  a  mistake.
everything was too ordinary. a quiet sunny day, and the field was not the
field i remembered. i pictured kiowa's face, the way he used to smile, but
all i felt was the awkwardness of remembering.

behind  me,  kathleen  let  out  a  little  giggle.  the  interpreter  was

showing her magic tricks.

 turned and moved back to the jeep.

kathleen gave me a little nod.
"well," she said, "i hope you're having fun."
"sure."
"can we go now?"
"in a minute," i said. "just relax."
at the back of the jeep i found the small cloth bundle i'd carried over

from the states.

kathleen's eyes narrowed. "what's that?"
"stuff," i told her.
she  glanced  at  the  bundle  again,  then  hopped  out  of  the  jeep  and
followed me back to the field. we walked past jimmy cross's command
post, past the spot where kiowa had gone under, down to where the field
dipped into the marshland along the river. i took off my shoes and socks.

"okay," kathleen said, "what's going on?"
"a quick swim."
"where?"
"right here," i said. "stay put."
she  watched  me  unwrap  the  cloth  bundle.  inside  were  kiowa's  old

moccasins.



i stripped down to my underwear, took off my wrist-watch, and waded
in. the water was warm against my feet. instantly, i recognized the soft,
fat feel of the bottom. the water here was eight in

ches deep.

kathleen  seemed  nervous.  she  squinted  at  me,  her  hands  fluttering.
"listen, this is stupid," she said, "you can't even hardly get wet. how can
you swim out there?"

"i'll manage."
"but  it's  not  ...  i  mean,  god,  it's  not  even  water,  it's  like  mush  or

something."

she  pinched  her  nose  and  watched  me  wade  out  to  where  the  water
reached my knees. roughly here, i decided, was where mitchell sanders
had found kiowa's rucksack. i eased myself down, squatting at first, then
sitting.  there  was  again  that  sense  of  recognition.  the  water  rose  to
midchest, a deep greenish brown, almost hot. small water bugs skipped
along  the  surface.  right  here,  i  thought.  leaning  forward,  i  reached  in
with the moccasins and wedged them into the soft bottom, letting them
slide  away.  tiny  bubbles  broke  along  the  surface.  i  tried  to  think  of
something  decent  to  say,  something  meaningful  and
 
 ___________________________
 
  right,  but  nothing
came to me.

i looked down into the field.
"well," i finally managed. "there it is."
my  voice  surprised  me.  it  had  a  rough,  chalky  sound,  full  of  things  i
did  not  know  were  there.  i  wanted  to  tell  kiowa  that  he'd  been  a  great
friend, the very best, but all i could do was slap hands with the water.

the sun made me squint. twenty years. a lot like yesterday, a lot like
never.  in  a  way,  maybe,  i'd  gone  under  with  kiowa,  and  now  after  two
decades i'd finally worked my way out. a hot afternoon, a bright august
sun, and the war was over. for a few moments i could not bring myself
to move. like waking from a summer nap, feeling lazy and sluggish, the
world collecting itself around me. fifty meters up the field one of the old
farmers  stood  watching  from  along  the  dike.  the  man's  face  was  dark
and  solemn.  as  we  stared  at  each  other,  neither  of  us  moving,  i  felt
something go shut in my he

with two bullets; i was superstitious; i believed in the odds with the same

i was atrocityâ€”i was jungle fire, jungle drumsâ€”i was the blind stare in

sat watching the shadows come, then rat shook his head.

he said he'd done his best. he'd tried to be a decent medic. win some
and lose some, he said, but he'd tried hard. briefly then, rambling a little,
he talked about a few of the guys who were gone now, curt lemon and
kiowa and ted lavender, and how crazy it was that people who were so
incredibly alive could get so incredibly dead.

then he almost laughed.
"this whole war," he said. "you know what it is? just one big banquet.

the next morning he shot himself.
he took off his boots and socks, laid out his medical kit, doped himself

the lives of the dead


but this too is true: stories can save us. i'm forty-three years old, and a
writer now, and even still, right here, i keep dreaming linda alive. and
ted lavender, too, and kiowa, and curt lemon, and a slim young man i
killed,  and  an  old  man  sprawled  beside  a  pigpen,  and  several  others
whose bodies i once lifted and dumped into a truck. they're all dead. but
in a story, which is a kind of dreaming, the dead sometimes smile and sit
up and return to the world.

start  here:  a  body  without  a  name.  on  an  afternoon  in  1969  the
platoon took sniper fire from a filthy little village along the south china
sea.  it  lasted  only  a  minute  or  two,  and  no

asts. they lifted their canteens and drank to the old
man's  family  and  ancestors,  his  many  grandchildren,  his  newfound  life
after death. it was more than mockery. there was a formality to it, like a
funeral without the sadness.

dave jensen flicked his eyes at me.
"hey,  o'brien,"  he  said,  "you  got  a  toast  in  mind?  never  too  late  for

manners."

i  found  things  to  do  with  my  hands.  i  looked  away  and  tried  not  to

think.

late in the afternoon, just before dusk, kiowa came up and asked if he
could sit at my foxhole for a minute. he offered me a christmas cookie
from  a  batch  his  father  had  sent  him.  it  was  february  now,  but  the
cookies tasted fine.

for a few moments kiowa watched the sky.
"you  did  a  good  thing  today,"  he  said.  "that  shaking  hands  crap,  it
isn't  decent.  the  guys'll  hassle  you  for  a  whileâ€”especially  jensenâ€”but
just keep saying no. should've done it myself. takes guts, i know that."

"it wasn't guts. i was

scared."
kiowa shrugged. "same difference."



"no,  i  couldn't do  it.  a  mental  block  or  something  .  .  .  i  don't  know,

just creepy."

"well, you're new here. you'll get used to it." he paused for a second,
studying  the  green  and  red  sprinkles  on  a  cookie.  "todayâ€”i  guess  this
was your first look at a real body?"

i shook my head. all day long i'd been picturing linda's face, the way

she smiled.

"it sounds funny," i said, "but that poor old man, he reminds me of... i
mean, there's

this girl i used to know. i took her to the movies once. my

kiowa looked at me for a long while. then he leaned back and smiled.
"man," he said, "that's a bad date."



linda  was  nine  then,  as  i  was,  but  we  were  in  love.  and  it  was  real.
when i write about her now, three decades later, it's tempting to dismiss
it as a crush, an infatuation of childhood, but i know for a fact that what
we felt for each other was as deep and rich as love can ever get. it had all
the  shadings  and  complexities  of  mature  adult  love,  and  maybe  more,

him through the days. i remember how peaceful his eyes were. even in
bad  situations  he  had  a  soft,  dreamy  expression  on  his  face,  which  was
what  he  wanted,  a  kind  of  escape.  "how's  the  war  today?"  somebody
would ask, and ted lavender would give a little smile to the sky and say,
"mellowâ€”a nice smooth war today." and then in april he was shot in the
head outside the village of than khe. kiowa and i and a couple of others
were ordered to prepare his body for the dustoff. i remember squatting
down,  not  wanting  to  look  but  then  looking.  lavender's  left  cheekbone
was gone. there was a swollen blackness around his eye. quickly, trying
not  to  feel  anything,  we  went  through  the  kid's  pockets.  i  remember
wishing i had gloves. it wasn't the blood i hated; it was the deadness. we
put his personal effects in a plastic bag and tied the bag to his arm. we
stripped  off  the

we kept the dead alive with stories. when ted lavender was shot in
the  head,  the  men  talked  about  how  they'd  never  seen  him  so  mellow,
how  tranquil  he  was,  how  it  wasn't  the  bullet  but  the  tranquilizers  that
blew  his  mind.  he  wasn't  dead,  just  laid-back.  there  were  christians
among us, like kiowa, who believed in the new testament stories of life
after death. other stories were passed down like legends from old-timer
to  newcomer.  mostly,  though,  we  had  to  make  up  our  own.  often  they
were exaggerated, or blatant lies, but it was a way of bringing body and



soul  back  together,  or  a  way  of  making  new  bodies  for  the  souls  to
inhabit. there was a story, for instance, about how curt lemon had gone

except  she  didn't  look  asleep.  she  looked  dead.  she  looked  heavy  and
totally dead.



i remember closing my eyes. after a while my father stepped up beside

me.

"come on now," he said. "let's go get some ice cream."



in the months after ted lavender died, there were many other bodies.
i  never  shook  handsâ€”not  thatâ€”but  one  afternoon  i  climbed  a  tree  and
threw  down  what  was  left  of  curt  lemon.  i  watched  my  friend  kiowa
sink  into  the  muck  along  the  song  tra  bong.  and  in  early  july,  after  a
battle in the mountains, i was assigned to a six-man detail to police up
the enemy kias. there were twenty-seven bodies altogether, and parts of
several  others.  the  dead  were  everywhere.  some  lay  in  piles.  some  lay
alone.  one,  i  remember,  seemed  to  kneel.  another  was  bent  from  the
waist over a small boulder, the top of his head on the ground, his arms
rigid, the eyes squinting in concentra

embodied  linda;  she's  mostly  made  up,  with  a  new  identity  and  a  new
name,  like  the  man  who  never  was.  her  real  name  doesn't  matter.  she
was nine years old. i loved her and then she died. and yet right here, in
the spell of memory and imagination, i can still see her as if through ice,
as if i'm gazing into some other world, a place where there are no brain
tumors and no funeral homes, where there are no bodies at all. i can see
kiowa,  too,  and  ted  lavender  and  curt  lemon,  and  sometimes  i  can
even  see  timmy  skating  with  linda  under  the  yellow  floodlights.  i'm
young and happy. i'll never die. i'm skimming across the surface of my
own history, moving fast, riding the melt beneath the blades, doing loops
and  spins,  and  when  i  take  a  high  leap  into  the  dark  and  come  down
thirty years later, i realize it is as tim trying to save timmy's life with a
story.
