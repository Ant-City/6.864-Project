ucer was from the planet
tralfamadore, he said. he was taken to tralfamadore, where he was displayed naked in a
zoo, he said. he was mated there with a former earthling movie star named montana
wildhack.
 some night owls in ilium heard billy on the radio, and one of them called billy's
daughter barbara. barbara was upset. she and her husband went down to new york and
brought billy home. billy insisted mildly that everything he had said on the radio was
true. he said he had been kidnapped by the tralfamadorians on the night of his daughter's
wedding. he hadn't been missed, he said, because the tralfamadorians had taken him
through a time warp, so that he could be on tralfamadore for years, and still be away
from earth for only a microsecond.
 another month went by without incident, and then billy wrote a letter to the ilium
news leader, which the paper published. it described the creatures from tralfamadore.
 the letter said that they were two feet high, and green., and shaped like plumber's
friends.

ly about time. billy promised to tell what some of those
wonderful things were in his next letter.
 billy was working on his second letter when the first letter was published. the second
letter started out like this:
 'the most important thing i learned on tralfamadore was that when a person dies he
only appears to die. he is still very much alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to
cry at his funeral. all moments, past, present and future, always have existed, always will
exist. the tralfamadorians can look at all the different moments just that way we can
look at a stretch of the rocky mountains, for instance. they can see how permanent all
the moments are, and they can look at any moment that interests them. it is just an
illusion we have here on earth that one moment follows another one, like beads on a
string, and that once a moment is gone it is gone forever.
 'when a tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in a bad
condition in that particular moment,

but that the same person is just fine in plenty of other
moments. now, when i myself hear that somebody is dead, i simply shrug and say what
the tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is "so it goes."'
 and so on.
 billy was working on this letter in the basement rumpus room of his empty house. it
was his housekeeper's day off. there was an old typewriter in the rumpus room. it was a
beast. it weighed as much as a storage battery. billy couldn't carry it very far very easily,
which was why he was writing in the rumpus room instead of somewhere else.

apart.'
 'where did you get a crazy name like "tralfamadore?"'
 'that's what the creatures who live there call it.
 'oh god,' said barbara, and she turned her back on him. she celebrated frustration by
clapping her hands. 'may i ask you a simple question?'
 'of course.'
 'why is it you never mentioned any of this before the airplane crash?'
 'i didn't think the time was ripe.'
 and so on. billy says that he first came unstuck in time in 1944, long before his trip to
tralfamadore. the tralfamadorians didn't have anything to do with his coming unstuck
they were simply able to give him insights into what was really going on.
 billy first came unstuck while the second world war was in progress. billy was a
chaplain's assistant in the war. a chaplain's assistant is customarily a figure of fun in the
american army. billy was no exception. he was powerless to harm the enemy or to help
his friends. in fact, he had no friends. he was a valet to a preacher, expected no
promotions or medals, bore no

m from one of the portholes. it
became imperative that he take hold of the bottom rung of the sinuous ladder, which he
did. the rung was electrified, so that billy's hands locked onto it hard. he was hauled
into the airlock, and machinery closed the bottom door. only then did the ladder, wound
onto a reel in the airlock, let him go. only then did billy's brain start working again.
 there were two peepholes inside the airlock-with yellow eyes pressed to them. there
was a speaker on the wall. the tralfamadorians had no voice boxes. they communicated
telepathically. they were able to talk to billy by means of a computer and a sort of
electric organ which made every earthling speech sound.
 'welcome aboard, mr. pilgrim,' said the loudspeaker. 'any questions?'
 billy licked his lips, thought a while, inquired at last: 'why me? '
 that is a very earthling question to ask, mr. pilgrim. why you? why us for that
matter? why anything? because this moment simply is. have you ever seen bugs
trapped in amber?'

 billy pilgrim says that the universe does not look like a lot of bright little dots to the
creatures from tralfamadore. the creatures can see where each star has been and where it
is going, so that the heavens are filled with rarefied, luminous spaghetti. and
tralfamadorians don't see human beings as two-legged creatures, either. they see them
as great millipedes with babies' legs at one end and old people's legs at the other,' says
billy pilgrim.
 billy asked for something to read on the trip to tralfamadore. his captors had five
million earthling books on microfilm, but no way to project them in billy's cabin. they
had only one actual book in english, which would be placed in a tralfamadorian
museum. it was valley of the dolls, by jacqueline susann.
 billy read i

dozen of them might have had

 billy couldn't read tralfamadorian, of course, but he could at least see how the books
were laid out-in brief clumps of symbols separated by stars. billy commented that the
clumps might be telegrams.
 'exactly,' said the voice.
 'they are telegrams?'
 'there are no telegrams on tralfamadore. but you're right: each clump of-symbols is a
brief, urgent message describing a situation, a scene, we tralfamadorians read them all at
once, not one after the other. there isn't any particular relationship between all the
messages, except that the author has chosen them carefully, so that, when seen all at
once, they produce an image of life that is beautiful and surprising and deep. there is no
beginning, no middle, no end, no suspense, no moral, no causes, no effects. what we
love in our books are the depths of many marvelous moments seen all at one time.'
 moments after that, the saucer entered a time warp,

ing we should rush into,' she said. 'i mean whatever we decide on, that's
what we're going to have to live with the rest of our lives.'
 billy studied the pictures. 'royal danish.' he said at last.
 'colonial moonlight is nice, too.'
 'yes, it is,' said billy pilgrim.
 and billy traveled in time to the zoo on tralfamadore. he was forty-four years old, on
display under a geodesic dome. he was reclining on the lounge chair which had been his
cradle during his trip through space. he was naked. the tralfamadorians were
interested in his body-all of it. there were thousands of them outside, holding up their
little hands so that their eyes could see him. billy had been on tralfamadore for six
earthling months now. he was used to the crowd.
 escape was out of the question. the atmosphere outside the dome was cyanide, and
earth was 446,120,000,000,000,000 miles away.
 billy was displayed there in the zoo in a simulated earthling habitat. most of the
furnishings had been stolen from the sears & roebuck wareho

come that way. it was a picture of a gay nineties couple on a bicycle built for two.
billy looked at that picture now, tried to think something about the couple. nothing
came to him. there didn't seem to be anything to think about those two people.
 billy ate a good breakfast from cans. he washed his cup and plate and knife and fork
and spoon and saucepan, put them away. then he did exercises he had learned in the
army-straddle jumps, deep knee bends, sit-ups and push-ups. most tralfamadorians had
no way of knowing bill's body and face were not beautiful. they supposed that he was a
splendid specimen. this had a pleasant effect on billy, who began to enjoy his body for
the first time.
 he showered after his exercises and trimmed his toenails. he shaved and sprayed
deodorant under his arms, while a zoo guide on a raised platform outside explained what
billy was doing-and why. the guide was lecturing telepathically, simply standing there,
sending out thought waves to the crowd. on the

t with which he would relay questions to billy from the crowd.
now the first question came-from the speaker on the television set: 'are you happy here?'
 'about as happy as i was on earth,' said billy pilgrim, which was true.
 there were fives sexes on tralfamadore, each of them performing a step necessary in
the creation of a new individual. they looked identical to billy-because their sex
differences were all in the fourth dimension.
 one of the biggest moral bombshells handed to billy by the tralfamadorians,
incidentally, had to do with sex on earth. they said their flying-saucer crews had
identified no fewer than seven sexes on earth, each essential to reproduction. again:
billy couldn't possibly imagine what five of those seven sexes had to do with the making
of a baby, since they were sexually active only in the fourth dimension.
 the tralfamadorians tried to give billy clues that would help him imagine sex in the
invisible dimension. they told him that there could be no earthling babies withou

homosexuals. there could be babies without female homosexuals. there couldn't be
babies without women over sixty-five years old. there could be babies without men over
sixty-five. there couldn't be babies without other babies who had lived an hour or less
after birth. and so on.
 it was gibberish to billy.
 there was a lot that billy said that was gibberish to the tralfamadorians, too. they
couldn't imagine what time looked like to him. billy had given up on explaining that.
the guide outside had to explain as best he could.
 the guide invited the crowd to imagine that they were looking across a desert at a
mountain range on a day that was twinkling bright and clear. they could look at a peak
or a bird or a cloud, at a stone right in front of them, or even down into a canyon behind
them. but among them was this poor earthling, and his head was encased in a steel
sphere

the pipe. the far end of the pipe rested on a bi-pod which was also
bolted to the flatcar. all billy could see was the dot at the end of the pipe. he didn't
know he was on a flatcar, didn't even know there was anything peculiar about his
situation.
 the flatcar sometimes crept, sometimes went extremely fast, often stopped-went
uphill, downhill, around curves, along straightaways. whatever poor billy saw through
the pipe, he had no choice but to say to himself, 'that's life.'
 billy expected the tralfamadorians to be baffled and alarmed by all the wars and other
forms of murder on earth. he expected them to fear that the earthling combination of
ferocity and spectacular weaponry might eventually destroy part or maybe all of the
innocent universe. science fiction had led him to expect that.
 but the subject of war never came up until billy brought it up himself. somebody in
the zoo crowd asked him through the lecturer what the most valuable thing he had
learned on tralfamadore was so far, and billy rep

danger from earth, they soon will be. so tell me the secret so i can take it back to earth
and save us all: how can a planet live at peace?'
 billy felt that he had spoken soaringly. he was baffled when he saw the
tralfamadorians close their little hands on their eyes. he knew from past experience
what this meant: he was being stupid.
 'would-would you mind telling me,' he said to the guide, much deflated, 'what was so
stupid about that?'
 'we know how the universe ends,' said the guide, 'and earth has nothing to do with it,
except that it gets wiped out, too.'
 'how-how does the universe end?' said billy.
 'we blow it up, experimenting with new fuels for our flying saucers. a

who would then straighten out as a member of the famous green berets.
 valencia wasn't a time-traveler, but she did have a lively imagination. while billy was
making love to her, she imagined that she was a famous woman in history. she was being
queen elizabeth the first of england, and billy was supposedly christopher columbus.
 billy made a noise like a small, rusty hinge. he had just emptied his seminal vesicles
into valencia, had contributed his share of the green beret. according to the
tralfamadorians, of course, the green beret would have seven parents in all.
 now he rolled off his huge wife, whose rapt expression did not change when he
departed. he lay with the buttons of his spine along the edge of the mattress, folded his
hands behind his head. he was rich now. he had been rewarded for marrying a girl
nobody in his right mind would have married. his father-in-law had given him a new
buick roadmaster, an all-electric home, and had made him manager of his most
prosperous office, his ilium

 barbara called the oil-burner man, and she made billy go to bed, made him promise to
stay under the electric blanket until the heat came on. she set the control of the blanket at
the highest notch, which soon made billy's bed hot enough to bake bread in.
 when barbara left, slamming the door behind her, billy traveled in time to the zoo on
tralfamadore again. a mate has just been brought to him from earth. she was montana
wildhack, a motion picture star.
 montana was under heavy sedation. tralfamadorians wearing gas masks brought her
in, put her on billy's yellow lounge chair; withdrew through his airlock. the vast crowd
outside was delighted. all attendance records for the zoo were broken. everybody on the
planet wanted to see the earthlings mate.
 montana was naked, and so was billy, of course. he had a tremendous wang,
incidentally. you never know who'll get one.
 now she fluttered her eyelids. her lashes were like buggy whips. 'where am i?' she
said.
 'everything is all right,' said billy g

ently. 'please don't be afraid.
 montana had been unconscious during her trip from earth. the tralfamadorians
hadn't talked to her, hadn't shown themselves to her. the last thing she remembered was
sunning herself by a swimming pool in palm springs, california. montana was only
twenty years old. around her neck was a silver chain with a heart-shaped locket hanging
from it--between her breasts.
 now she turned her head to see the myriads of tralfamadorians outside the dome.
they were applauding her by opening and closing their little green hands quickly.
 montana screamed and screamed.
 all the little green hands closed fight, because montana's terror was so unpleasant to
see. the head zoo keeper ordered a crane operator, who was standing by, to drop a navy
blue canopy over the dome, thus simulating earthling night inside. real night came to the
zoo for only one earthling hour out of every sixty-two.

billy pilgrim got onto a chartered airplane in ilium twenty-five years after that. he knew
he was going to crash, but he didn't want to make a fool of himself by saying so. it was
supposed to carry billy and twenty-eight other optometrists to a convention in montreal.
 his wife, valencia, was outside, and his father-in-law, lionel merble, was strapped to
the seat beside him.
 lionel merble was a machine. tralfamadorians, of course, say that every creature and
plant in the universe is a machine. it amuses them that so many earthlings are offended
by the idea of being machines.
 outside the plane, the machine named valencia merble pilgrim was eating a peter paul
mound bar and waving bye-bye.
 the plane took off without incident. the moment was structured that way. there was a
barbershop quartet on board. they were optometrists, too. they called themselves 'the
febs,' which was an acronym for 'four-eyed bastards.

sians were coming, killing and robbing and raping
and burning, had fled.
 but the russians hadn't come yet, even two days after the war. it was peaceful in the
ruins. billy saw only one other person on the way to the slaughterhouse. it was an old
man pushing a baby buggy. in the buggy were pots and cups and an umbrella frame, and
other things he had found.
 billy stayed in the wagon when it reached the slaughterhouse, sunning himself. the
others went looking for souvenirs. later on in life, the tralfamadorians would advise
billy to concentrate on the happy moments of his life, and to ignore the unhappy ones-to
stare only at pretty things as eternity failed to go by. if this sort of selectivity had been
possible for billy, he might have chosen as his happiest moment his sun-drenched snooze
in the back of the wagon.
 billy pilgrim was armed as he snoozed. it was the first time he had been armed since
basic training. his companions had insisted that he arm himself, since god only knew

is guns. they rust.
 on tralfamadore, says billy pilgrim, there isn't much interest in jesus christ. the
earthling figure who is most engaging to the tralfamadorian mind, he says, is charles
darwin-who taught that those who die are meant to die, that corpses are improvements.
so it goes.
 the same general idea appears in the big board by kilgore trout. the flying saucer
creatures who capture trout's hero ask him about darwin. they also ask him about golf.
 if what billy pilgrim learned from the tralfamadorians is true, that we will all live
forever, no matter how dead we may sometimes seem to be, i am not overjoyed. still-if i
am going to spend eternity visiting this moment and that, i'm grateful that so many of
those moments are nice.
 one of the nicest ones in recent times was on my trip back to dresden with my old war
buddy, o'hare.
