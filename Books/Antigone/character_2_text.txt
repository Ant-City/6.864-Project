the same as in oedipus the king, an open space before the royal palace, once that of oedipus, at thebes. the backscene represents the front of the palace, with three doors, of which the central and largest is the principal entrance into the house. the time is at daybreak on the mornin

g after the fall of the two brothers, eteocles and polyneices, and the flight of the defeated argives. antigone calls ismene forth from the palace, in order to speak to her alone.

antigone
ismene, sister, mine own dear sister, knowest thou what ill there is, of all bequeathed by oedipus, that zeus fulfils not for us twain while we live? nothing painful is there, nothing fraught with ruin, no shame, no dishonour, that i have not seen in thy woes and mine. 

and now what new edict is this of which they tell, that our captain hath just published to all thebes? knowest thou aught? hast thou heard? or is it hidden from thee that our friends are threatened with the doom of our foes?

o word of friends, antigone, gladsome or painful, hath come to me, since we two sisters were bereft of brothers twain, killed in one day by twofold blow; and since in this last night the argive host hath fled, know no more, whether my fortune be brighter, or more grievous.

antigone
i knew it well, and therefore sought to bring thee beyond the gates of the court, that thou mightest hear alone.

ismene
what is it? 'tis plain that thou art brooding on some dark tidings.

antigone
what, hath not creon destined our brothers, the one to honoured burial, the other to unburied shame? eteocles, they say, with due observance of right and custom, he hath laid in the earth, for his honour among the dead below. but the hapless corpse of polyneices-as rumour saith, it hath been published to the town that none shall entomb him or mourn, but leave unwept, unsepulchred, a welcome store for the birds, as the

such, 'tis said, is the edict that the good creon hath set forth for thee and for me,-yes, for me,-and is coming hither to proclaim it clearly to those who know it not; nor counts the matter light, but, whoso disobeys in aught, his doom is death by stoning before all the folk. thou knowest it now; and thou wilt soon show whether thou art nobly bred, or the base daughter of a noble line.

ismene
poor sister,-and if things stand thus, what could i help to do or undo?

antigone
consider if thou wilt share the toil and the deed.

ismene
in what venture? what can be thy meaning?

antigone
wilt thou aid this hand to lift the dead?

ismene
thou wouldst bury him,-when 'tis forbidden to thebes?

antigone
i will do my part,-and thine, if thou wilt not,-to a brother. false to him will i never be found.

ismene
ah, over-bold! when creon hath forbidden?

antigone
nay, he hath no right to keep me f

ismene
ah me! think, sister, how our father perished, amid hate and scorn, when sins bared by his own search had moved him to strike both eyes with self-blinding hand; then the mother wife, two names in one, with twisted noose did despite unto her life; and last, our two brothers in one day,-each shedding, hapless one, a kinsman's blood,-wrought out with mutual hands their common doom. and now we in turn-we two left all alone think how we shall perish, more miserably than all the rest, if, in defiance

or 'tis witless to be over busy.

antigone
i will not urge thee,-no nor, if thou yet shouldst have the mind, wouldst thou be welcome as a worker with me. nay, be what thou wilt; but i will bury him: well for me to die in doing that. i shall rest, a loved one with him whom i have loved, sinless in my crime; for i owe a longer allegiance to the dead than to the living: in that world i shall abide for ever. but if thou wilt, be guilty of dishonouring laws which the gods have stablished in honour.

ismene
i do them no dishonour; but to defy the state,-i have no strength for that.

antigone
such be thy plea:-i, then, will go to heap the earth above the brother whom i love.

ismene
alas, unhappy one! how i fear for thee!

antigone
fear not for me: guide thine own fate aright.

ismene:
at least, then, disclose this plan to none, but hide it closely,-and so, too, will i.

antigone
oh, denounce it! thou wilt be far more hateful for thy silence, if thou proclaim not these things to all.

antigone
i know that i please where i am most bound to please.

ismene
aye, if thou canst; but thou wouldst what thou canst not.

antigone
why, then, when my strength fails, i shall have done.

ismene
a hopeless quest should not be made at all.

antigone
if thus thou speakest, thou wilt have hatred from me, and will justly be subject to the lasting hatred of the dead. but leave me, and the folly that is mine alone, to suffer this dread thing; for i shall not suffer aught so dreadful as an ignoble death.

ismene
go, then, if thou must; and of this be sure,-that though thine errand is foolish, to thy dear ones thou art truly dear.

antigone
nevertheless, hades desires these rites.

creon
but the good desires not a like portion with the evil.

antigone
who knows but this seems blameless in the world below?

creon
a foe is never a friend-not even in death.

antigone
tis not my nature to join in hating, but in loving.

creon
pass, then, to the world of the dead, and, it thou must needs love, love them. while i live, no woman shall rule me.
enter ismene from the house, led in by two attendants.

chorus chanting
lo, yonder ismene comes forth, shedding such tears as fond sisters weep; a cloud upon her brow casts its shadow over her darkly-flushing face, and breaks in rain on her fair cheek.

creon
and thou, who, lurking like a viper in my house, wast secretly draining my life-blood, while i knew not that i was nurturing two pests, to rise against my throne-come, tell me now, wilt thou also confess thy part in this burial, or wilt thou forswear a

ll knowledge of it?

ismene
i have done the deed,-if she allows my claim,-and share the burden of the charge.

antigone
nay, justice will not suffer thee to do that: thou didst not consent to the deed, nor did i give thee part in it.

ismene
but, now that ills beset thee, i am not ashamed to sail the sea of trouble at thy side.

antigone
whose was the deed, hades and the dead are witnesses: a friend in words is not the friend that i love.

ismene
nay, sister, reject me not, but let me die with thee, and duly honour the dead.

antigone
share not thou my death, nor claim deeds to which thou hast not put thy hand: my death will suffice.

ismene
and what life is dear to me, bereft of thee?

antigone
ask creon; all thy care is for him.

ismene
why vex me thus, when it avails thee nought?

antigone
indeed, if i mock, 'tis with pain that i mock thee.

ismene
tell me,-how can i serve thee, even now?

ismene
ah, woe is me! and shall i have no share in thy fate?

antigone
thy choice was to live; mine, to die.

ismene
at least thy choice was not made without my protest.

antigone
one world approved thy wisdom; another, mine.

ismene
howbeit, the offence is the same for both of us.

antigone
be of good cheer; thou livest; but my life hath long been given to death, that so i might serve the dead.

creon
lo, one of these maidens hath newly shown herself foolish, as the other hath been since her life began.

ismene
yea, o king, such reason as nature may have given abides not with the unfortunate, but goes astray.

but there can never be such love as bound him to her.

i like not an evil wife for my son.

haemon, beloved! how thy father wrongs thee!

enough, enough of thee and of thy marriage!

wilt thou indeed rob thy son of this maiden?

'tis death that shall stay these bridals for me.

strophe 1

blest are they whose days have not tasted of evil. for when a house hath once been shaken from heaven, there the curse fails nevermore, passing from life to life of the race; even as, when the surge is driven over the darkness of the deep by the fierce breath of thracian sea-winds, it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and there is sullen roar from wind-vexed headlands that front the blows of the storm.
