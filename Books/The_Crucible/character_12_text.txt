the lord; suspicions and the envy of the miserable toward the happy could and did burst 
out in the general revenge. 
 
reverend parris is praying now, and, though we cannot hear his words, a sense of his 
confusion  hangs  about  him.  he  mumbles,  then  seems  about  to  weep;  then  he  weeps, 
then,prays again; but his daughter does not stir on the bed. 
 
the door opens, and his negro slave enters. tituba is in her forties. parris brought her 
with him from barbados, where he spent some years as a merchant before entering the 
ministry. she enters as one does who can no longer bear to be barred from the sight of 
her  beloved,  but  she is also very frightened because her slave sense has warned her 
that, as always, trouble in this house eventually lands on her back. 
 
tituba, already taking a step backward: my betty be hearty soon? 
 
parris: out of here!

doing that? and i heard a screeching and gibberish coming from her mouth. she were 
swaying like a dumb beast over that fire! 
 

parris: i cannot blink what i saw, abigail, for my enemies will not blink it. i saw a

there are accounts of similar klatches in europe, where the daughters of the towns 
would assemble at night and, sometimes with fetishes, sometimes with a selected young
