    what's past and what's to come she can descry.
    speak, shall i call her in? believe my words,
    for they are certain and unfallible.
  charles. go, call her in.                       [exit bastard]
    but first, to try her skill,
    reignier, stand thou as dauphin in my place;
    question her proudly; let thy looks be stern;
    by this means shall we sound what skill she hath.

  reignier. fair maid, is 't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
  pucelle. reignier, is 't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
    where is the dauphin? come, come from behind;
    i know thee well, though never seen before.
    be not amaz'd, there's nothing hid from me.
    in private will i talk with thee apart.
    stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
  reignier. she takes upon her bravely at first dash.

    the which at touraine, in saint katherine's churchyard,
    out of a great deal of old iron i chose forth.
  charles. then come, o' god's name; i fear no woman.
  pucelle. and while i live i'll ne'er fly from a man.

  pucelle. christ's mother helps me, else i were too weak.
  charles. whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me.
    impatiently i burn with thy desire;

    what ruin happened in revenge of him,
    within their chiefest temple i'll erect
    a tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd;
    upon the which, that every one may read,
    shall be engrav'd the sack of orleans,
    the treacherous manner of his mournful death,
    and what a terror he had been to france.
    but, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
    i muse we met not with the dauphin's grace,

    nor any of his false confederates.

    by fair persuasions, mix'd with sug'red words,
    we will entice the duke of burgundy
    to leave the talbot and to follow us.
  charles. ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
    france were no place for henry's warriors;
    nor should that nation boast it so with us,
