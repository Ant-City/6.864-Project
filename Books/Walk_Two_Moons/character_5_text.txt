porch.


   'in the back of my closet.' i said, 'under the floorboards. i put something
there, and i've got to have it.

   'don't be a goose,' he said. 'come and see margaret.

   i did not want to see margaret. i stood there, looking around, and that's
when i saw the face pressed up against an upstairs window next door. it was
a girl's round face, and it looked afraid. i didn't know it then, but that face
belonged to phoebe winterbottom, the girl who had a powerful imagination,
who would become my friend, and who would have all those peculiar things
happen to her.

   not long ago, when i was locked in a car with my grandparents for six
days, i told them the story of phoebe, and when i finished telling them - or
maybe even as i was telling them - i realized that the story of phoebe was
like the plaster wall in our old house in bybanks, kentucky.

   my father started chipping away at a plaster wall in the living room of our

   but gramps said, 'how about a story? spin us a yam.'

   i certainly do know heaps of stories, but i learned most of them from
gramps gram suggested i tell one about my mother. that, i could not do. i
had just reached the point where i could stop thinking about her every
minute of every day. i wasn't ready - or at least i did not think i was ready -
to talk about her.

   gramps said, 'well, then, what about your friends? you got any tales to
tell about them?'

   instantly, phoebe winterbottom came to mind. there was certainly a hog's
bellyful of things to tell about her. 'i could tell you an extensively strange
story,' i warned.

   'oh, good!' gram said. 'delicious!' and that is how i happened to suspend
my tree prayers and tell them about phoebe winterbottom, her disappearing
mother, and the lunatic. it is also how i discovered that beneath phoebe's
story was another story.

began my story of

rl, mary lou finney, said the most peculiar things, like out
of the blue she would say, 'omnipotent!' or 'beef brain!' i couldn't make any
sense of it. there were japanese twins (a brother and sister), who didn't
speak at all except to say 'yes, yes,' and 'yes, yes.' there were megan and
christy who jumped up and down like parched peas, moody beth ann, and
pink-cheeked alex. there was ben who drew cartoons all day long, and a
most peculiar teacher named mr. birkway.

   and then there was phoebe winterbottom. ben called her 'free-bee ice
bottom' and drew a picture of a bumble-bee with an ice cube on its bottom.
phoebe tore it up.

   phoebe was a quiet girl. she stayed mostly by herself and seemed quite
shy. she had the most pleasant face and huge, enormous sky-blue eyes.
around this pleasant round face, her hair curled in short ringlets as yellow as
a crow's foot.

   during that first week, when my father and i were at margaret's (we ate
dinner there three times the first week), i saw phoebe's fa

phoebe.

   phoebe looked at me, and i pushed her a little closer. mrs. partridge put
her fingers up to phoebe's face and mashed around gently over her eyelids
and down her cheeks. then she said, 'just as i thought. it's two eyes, a nose
and a mouth.' then she laughed a wicked laugh that sounded as if it was
bouncing off jagged rocks. 'you're thirteen years old.'

   'yes' phoebe said.

   'i knew it,' mrs. partridge said. 'i just knew it.' she patted her yellow
feather boa.

   'this is phoebe winterbottom,' i said. 'she lives right next door to you.

   when we left, phoebe whispered, 'i wish you hadn't done that. i wish you
hadn't told her i lived next door.

   'why not? you don't seem to know mrs. cadaver and mrs. partridge very
well--'

   'they haven't lived there very long. only a month or so.'

   'don't you think it's remarkable that she guessed your age like that?'

   'i don't see what is so remarkable about it,' phoebe said. before i could
explain, she started telling me about the tim

   phoebe's mother was in the kitchen baking pies on the counter were two
cartons of blackberries i couldn't keep my eyes off the blackberries. mrs.
winterbottom said, 'i'm making blackberry pie. i hope you like black-
berries - is there something wrong? really, if you don't like blackberries, i
could-'

   'no,' i said. 'i like blackberries very much. i just have some allergies, i
think.'

   'to blackberries''' mrs. winterbottom said,

   'oh, no. not to blackberries.' the truth is, i do not have allergies, but i
could not admit that the sight of blackberries reminded me of my mother.

   mrs. winterbottom made me and phoebe sit down at the kitchen table and
tell her about our day. she brought out a plate of homemade cookies. phoebe
told her about mrs. partridge guessing her age.

   'she's really remarkable,' i said.

   phoebe said, 'it's not that remarkable, sal. i wouldn't exactly use the word
"remarkable".

   gramps pulled out his wallet. 'if you need some cash--'


   'oh, thank you,' she said. 'that's very kind of you, but i'm all set. thank
you for - for' - she looked around at all the pieces of her car - 'for everything.
i'm sure you have to be on your way.

   and, once gramps was satisfied that the mechanic was an honest man who
might actually be able to repair her car, we started on our trip again.

   'salamanca,' gram said, 'tell us more about peeby.'

   'phoebe,' i said.' phoebe winterbottom.'

   'yes, that's right,' gram said. 'peeby.'

   'what was the diabolic thing that happened to mr. cadaver?' gramps
asked. 'you didn't tell us that yet.'

   i explained that just as phoebe was going to divulge the purely awful thing
that had happened to mr. cadaver, her father came home from work and we
all sat down to dinner: me, phoebe, mr. and mrs. winterbottom, and
phoebe's sister, prudence.

   phoebe's parents reminded me a lot of my other grandparents - the
pickford
 
 ___________________________
 
s like the pickfords, mr. and mrs. winterbottom spoke quietly, in
short sentences, and sat straight up as they ate their food. they were
extremely polite to each other, saying 'yes, norma,' and 'yes, george,' and
'would you please pass the potatoes, phoebe?' and 'wouldn't your guest like
another helping?'

   they were picky about their food, too. everything they ate was what my
father would call 'side dishes': potatoes, courgettes, bean salad, and a
mystery casserole that i could not identify. they didn't eat meat, and they
didn't use butte

r. they were very much concerned with cholesterol.

   from what i could gather, mr. winterbottom worked in an office, creating
road maps. mrs. winterbottom baked and cleaned and did laundry and
grocery shopping. i had a funny feeling that mrs. winterbottom did no
actually like all this barking and cleaning and laundry and shopping, and i'm

not quite sure why i had that feeling because if you just listened to the words
she said. it sounded as if she was mrs. supreme housewife.

   for example, at one point mrs. winterbottom said. 'i believe i've made
more pies in the past week than i can count.' she said this in a cheery voice,
but after- wards, in the small silence, when no one commented on all these
pies she had been busy making, she gave a so

ft sigh and looked down at her
plate.

   a little later, she said, 'i couldn't find exactly that brand of muesli you like
so much, george, but i bought something similar.

   'oh?' mr. winterbottom said.

   'i'm sure it's quite similar to what you wanted.'

   mr. winterbottom kept eating and again, in that silence, mrs.
winterbottom gave a soft sigh and examined her plate.

   i was sort of happy for her when she announced that since phoebe and
prudence were back in school, she thought she would return to work.
apparently, during the school terms she worked part-time at rocky's rubber
as a receptionist. i thought this might be a nice change for her, to be out of
the house, but when she mentioned going back to work and no one said any-
thing about it, she sighed agai

n and pushed her potatoes to one side of her
plate.

   a few times, mrs. winterbottom called her husband, 'sweetie pie' and
'honey bun'. she said, 'would you like more courgettes, sweetie pie?' and
'did i make enough potatoes, honey bun?'

   for some reason, that surprised me, those little names she used. she was
dressed in a plain brown skirt and white blouse. on her feet were sensible,
wide, flat shoes. she did not wear make-up. even though she had a pleasant.
round face and long yellow curls, the main impression i got was that she was
used to being plain and ordinary, that s

he was not supposed to do anything
too shocking.

   another odd impression i got was that mr. winterbottom was playing the
role of a father, with a capital 'f'. he sat at the head of the table with his

white shirt cuffs rolled back neatly. he still wore his red and blue striped tie.
he kept his face very serious throughout the entire meal. his voice was
deep, and his words were clear. 'yes, norma,' he said, deeply and clearly.
'no, norma.' he looked more like fifty-two than thirty- eight, but this was
not something i would ever call to his - or phoebe's - attention.

   phoebe's sister prudence wa
 
 ___________________________
 
s quite a bit like her mother. prudence was
seventeen years old, but she acted like she was almost a mother herself. she
ate primly, she nodded politely, she smiled a small, polite smile after
everything she said.

   it all seemed peculiar. they acted so thumpingly tidy and respectable.

   at the end of the dinner, mrs. winterbottom brought in the blackberry pie.
i ate it, even though the black- berries did not have as much flavour as they
did in bybanks, kentucky. mr. winterbottom asked phoebe who was in her
class at school. she started naming everyone, and when she got to mary lou
finney, mr. winterbottom said, 'finney? finney?' he turned to mrs.
winterbottom. 'norma, is mr. finney the one who wears blue jeans? the
one who is always throwing that football?'

   'yes george.'

   to phoebe, he said, 'is mary lou the one who goes around saying
'omnipotent!'?

   phoebe said, 'yes.'

   mrs. winterbottom said, 'i suppose - they probably don't seem - they
probably appear a

bit odd-'

   mr. winterbottom said, 'norma, i wouldn't want to judge.' but he was
judging, i could tell. he didn't like the finneys, or maybe he was jealous of
them.

   mrs. winterbottom gave her soft sigh and folded her napkin. i had the
feeling that there was something she really wanted to say, but she had
already decided that no one would listen.


   after dinner, phoebe walked me home, and on the way, she talked about
mrs. cadaver. she said, 'you wouldn't think it to look at her, but mrs.
cadaver is as strong as an ox.'

   'how do you know that?' i said.

   phoebe looked behind her, as if she was expecting someone to be
following us. 'because,' she said, 'i have seen he

t want gram and gramps to get in a fight over gloria, so i was
happy to continue telling phoebe's story. i was at phoebe's one saturday
morning when mary lou finney called and invited us over to her house.
phoebe's father was off playing golf, and phoebe's mother had just left for
the grocery store.

   phoebe went all around the house checking to make sure that the doors and
windows were locked. her mother had already done this, but she made
phoebe promise to do it as well. 'just in case,' mrs. winterbottom had said. i
was not sure 'just in case' what - maybe in case someone had stuck in and
opened all the windows and unlocked all the doors in the fifteen minutes
between the time she left and the time we did. 'you can never be too careful,'
mrs. winterbottom had said.

   the doorbell rang. phoebe and i looked out the window. standing on the
porch was a young man who looked about seventeen or eighteen, although i
am not as good at guessing people's ages as blind mrs. partridge is the
young man was

 do it together. she opened the door and
said hello in a cool voice to indicate, i think, that she wasn't someone who
could be fooled easily by strangers.

   'is this 49 grey street?' the young man said.

   since phoebe's street had four signs indicating that this was grey street,
and since phoebe's house had rather large and prominent black numbers (49)
over the front door, i did not think this was a particularly intelligent
question. phoebe admitted that yes, it was 49 grey street.

'so, the winterbottoms live here?' he said. phoebe admitted that yes, it was
the winterbottom residence. then she said, 'excuse me a moment, please,'
and closed the door. to me, she said, 'do you detect any signs of lunacy?
there does not appear to be any place he could be hiding a gun. his jeans
are ever so tight and his t-shirt is a bit small. he might, however, have a
knife tucked into his socks.'

   phoebe could really be dramatic. 'he isn't wearing any socks' i said.

   phoebe opened the door again.

   the y

oung man said, 'i want to see mrs. winterbottom. is she here or
what?'

   'yes' phoebe lied.

   the young man looked up and down the street. his hair was curly and
mussed, and there were bright pink circles on his cheeks. he wouldn't look
us straight in the eye, but instead kept glancing left and right.

   'i want to talk to her,' he said.

   'to who?' phoebe said.

   'mrs. winterbottom.'


   he did seem rather persistent.

   'she can't come to the door right phoebe said.

   i thought he might actually cry phoebe said that. he chewed on his lip and
blinked three or four times quickly. 'i'll wait,' he said.

   'just a minute,' phoebe said, closing the door. then she walked through the
downstairs, pretending to look for her mother. 'mom!' she called. 'yoo-hoo!'
she went upstairs, thumping on the steps as loudly as she could. 'mother!'

   phoebe and i returned to the door. 
 
 ___________________________
 
he was still standing there with his
hands in his pockets staring mournfully at phoebe's house. 'that's strange,'
phoebe said to him. 'i thought she was here, but she must have gone out.
there's a whole lot of other people here though,' she added quickly. 'scads
and scads of people, but no mrs. winterbottom.

   he chewed on his lip and hung his head like a sad old dog. 'i'll see mr.
winterbottom then,' he said.

   'sorry,' phoebe said. 'there are scads and scads of other people here, but
no mr. winterbottom either.

   'is mrs. winterbottom your mother?' he asked.

   'yes' phoebe said. 'would you like me to leave a message?'

   the little pink circles on his cheeks became even pinker. 'no!' he said. 'no.
i don't think so. no.' he looked up and down the street and then up at the
number above th

   'phoebe winterbottom?'

   'that's right.'

make a joke about her name, but he didn't. he glanced at me. 'are you a
winterbottom too?' he asked.

   'no,' i said. 'i'm a visitor.

   and then he left. he just turned around, walked slowly down the porch
steps and on down the street. we waited until he had turned the corner
before we left. we ran all the way to mary lou's phoebe was certain that the
young man was going to ambush us. honestly. like i said, she has a vivid
imagination.

am not. i'm just telling you that it seemed awfully loud over there.'

   'i didn't mind,' i said. i was thinking of something my father once said to
my mother: 'we'll fill the house up with children! we'll fill it right up to the
brim!' but they hadn't filled it up. it was just me and them, and then it was
just me and my father.

   when we got back to phoebe's house, her mother was lying on the couch,
dabbing at her eyes with a tissue.

   'is something wrong?' phoebe asked.

   'oh, no,' mrs. winterbottom said. 'nothing's wrong.

   then phoebe told her mother about the potential lunatic who had come to
the house earlier. this news upset mrs. winterbottom. she wanted to know
exactly what he said and what phoebe said and what he looked like and how
he acted and how phoebe acted, on and on. at last, mrs. winterbottom said,
'i think we had better not mention this to your father.' she reached forward
as if to hug phoebe, but phoebe pulled away.

   later, phoebe said, 'that's odd. usually my mother

rinted this message: don't judge a
man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins.

   'what an odd thing,' phoebe said.

   i looked at the paper. at first, i had the funny sensation that it was from
my father, because he is always saying things like this he is a regular book
of proverbs. but the handwriting was not at all like my father's.

   phoebe showed the message to her sister prudence and her mother. mrs.
winterbottom clutched at her collar. 'who could it be for?' she asked.

   mr. winterbottom came in the back door, carrying his golf clubs. mrs.
winterbottom showed him the message. 'who could it be for?' mrs.
winterbottom repeated.

   'i couldn't say, really,' mr. winterbottom said.

   'but, george, why would someone send us that message?'

   'i couldn't say, norma. maybe it isn't for us.' mr. winterbottom set his golf
clubs down beside the refrigerator. he did not seem very bothered by the
message.

   'not for us?' mrs. winterbottom said. 'but, it was on our steps'

   'really,

   prudence said, 'it's not for me.'

   'but, how do you know that?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   'i just know it,' prudence said.

   'phoebe?' mrs. winterbottom asked. 'is it for you?'

   'for me?' phoebe said, 'i don't think so,

   'well. who is it for?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   prudence looked at her father who looked phoebe, who looked at me and i

   'we honestly can't say' phoebe said.

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively worried. i believe she thought it
came from the potential lunatic looked at mrs.

'especially being a mother of one or two. if you have three or four - or more

time to think about anything else. if you've only got one or two, it's almost

   ben touched phoebe's arm. she flinched. 'ha,' he said. 'gotcha. you're
jumpy, too, free bee.'

   and that surprised me. i had already noticed how tense phoebe's whole
family seemed, how tidy, how respectable, and how thumpingly stiff. was i
becoming like that? why were they like that? a couple of times i had seen
phoebe's mother try to touch phoebe or prudence or mr. winterbottom, but
they all drew back from her. it was as if they had outgrown her.

   had i been drawing away from my own mother? did she have empty
spaces left over? was that why she left?

   'i hate it when you ask me three questions in a row, phoebe said. through
the window, we could see ben lugging the axe up the front steps of mrs.

but when mrs. cadaver held the front door open, ben disappeared inside.

   'phoebe, what are you doing?' her mother asked.

   then phoebe pulled the envelope out of her pocket, the envelope
containing the latest message. 'i found this outside,' phoebe said.

   mrs. winterbottom opened the envelope carefully, as if it might contain a
miniature bomb. she read it.

   'oh, sweetie,' she said. 'who is it from? who is it for? what does it mean?'

   phoebe explained what an agenda was.

   'i know what an agenda is, phoebe,' she said. 'i don't like this at all. i want
to know who is sending these.'

   i was waiting for phoebe to tell her about seeing the nervous young man at
the drug store, but phoebe didn't mention it.

   it was with great relief that we saw ben leave m

were excited about mr. birkway. 'isn't he terrific?' they said. at the corner of
my street, as i turned to leave, ben said to phoebe, 'hey, free bee! did you
write about me?'

   for a while, we did not hear any more about the journals. we had
absolutely no idea of all the trouble they were going to cause.


14. the rhododendron


   one saturday, i was at phoebe's again. her father was golfing, and her
mother was running errands. mrs. winterbottom had read out a long list to
us of where she would be in case we needed her. she almost did not go,
because she did not want to leave phoebe and me alone, but phoebe
promised to keep all the doors locked and not open the door for anyone. if
we heard any noises at all, we were supposed to call the police immediately.
'after you call the police,' mrs. winterbottom said, 'call mrs. cadaver. i
think she's home today. i'm sure she would come right over.

   'oh, sure,' phoebe whispered to me. 'that's

ven laugh, and once she
touched his hand, and he let her hand rest there on top of his. i didn't like it. i
didn't want my father to be sad, but at least when he was sad, i knew he was
remembering my mother. so when phoebe suggested that my father and i
should not go to margaret's, i was quite willing to agree with that notion.


   when phoebe's mother came home from running all her errands, she
looked terrible. she was sniffling and blowing her nose. phoebe asked her if
she was sick.

   mrs. winterbottom looked at phoebe and then straight at me. 'no,' she
said, 'i think i have an allergy.'

   phoebe said that we were going to do our home- work. upstairs, i said,
'maybe we should have helped her put away the groceries'

   'she likes to do all that by herself,' phoebe said.

   'are you sure?'

   'of course, i'm sure,' phoebe said. 'i've lived here my whole life, haven't i?'

   i asked phoebe if her mother really had allergies

   'well, gosh, sal, if she says she does, then i guess she does.

row? oh,
please?' prudence tilted her head to the side and tugged at her hair in exactly
the same way phoebe does. prudence smooshed up her mouth into a little
pout.

   in the kitchen, i said to phoebe, 'doesn't prudence know how to sew?'

   'of course, she does' phoebe said. 'why do you ask?'

   'i was just wondering why she doesn't sew her own skirt.'

   'sal,' phoebe said, 'if you don't mind my saying so, i think you're becoming
ever so critical.'

   before i left phoebe's that day, mrs. winterbottom handed prudence her
brown skirt with the newly sewn hem, and all the way home i wondered
about mrs. winterbottom and what she meant about living a tiny life. if she
didn't like all that baking and cleaning and jumping up to get bottles of nail
polish remover and sewing hems, why did she do it? why didn't she tell
them to do some of these things themselves? maybe she was afraid there
would be nothing left for her to do. there would be no need for her and she
would become invisible and no one wou

was sitting at the kitchen table when we walked in. in front of her was a pan
of burned brownies. she was blowing her nose. 'oh, sweetie,' she said to
phoebe, 'you startled me.' we dumped our books on a chair, and mrs.
winterbottom asked, 'how was it?'

   'how was what?' phoebe said.


   'why, sweetie, school of course. how was it? how are your classes? how
was it?' she blew her nose.

   'it was ok.'

   'ok? just ok?' mrs. winterbottom suddenly leaned over and kissed
phoebe's cheek.

   'i'm not a baby, you know,' phoebe said, wiping the kiss off her face.

   mrs. winterbottom glanced at me. 'i know that, phoebe,' she said.

   phoebe kicked her shoe against the table. 'i don't suppose i could get
another pair of loafers?' she asked.

   'another pair? why sweetie, we just bought you a pair.' she looked down
at phoebe's shoes 'don't they fit?'

   'they're a little tight,' phoebe said.

   'maybe they'll stretch.'

   'i don

   mrs. winterbottom was stabbing the brownies with a knife. 'want one?'
she asked.

   'they're a little burned, aren't they?' phoebe said. 'besides, i'm too fat.'

   'oh, sweetie, you're not fat,' mrs. winterbottom said.

   'i am.'

   'no, you're not.'

   'i am, i am, i am!' phoebe shouted at her mother. 'you don't have to bake
things for me,' she said. 'i'm too fat. and. besides, you don't have to wait
here for me to come home. i'm thirteen now.


   phoebe marched upstairs. mrs. winterbottom offered me a brownie, so i
sat down at the table. what i started doing was remembering the day before
my mother left. i did not know it was to be her last day home. several times
that day, my mother asked me if

why do you keep asking me?' i
don't know why i did that. i didn't mean anything by it, but that was one of
the last memories she had of me, and i wished i could take it back.

   phoebe's sister prudence breezed into the house, slamming the door behind
her. 'i just blew it, i know it!' she wailed.

   'oh, sweetie,' her mother said.

   'i did!' prudence said. 'i did, i did, i did.'

   'prudence, your father does not like you to use that phrase "blew it".

   'why not?' prudence asked.

   mrs. winterbottom looked tired and sad. 'oh, i don't know,' she said. 'i
suppose he thinks it doesn't sound - very respectable.' mrs. winterbottom
half-heartedly chipped away at the burned brownies and asked prudence if
she would have another chance at cheerleading try-outs.

   'yes, tomorrow. but i know i'm going to blow--'

   her mother said, 'maybe i'll come along and watch.' i could tell that mrs.
winterbottom was trying to rise above some awful sadness she was feeling,
but prudence couldn't see that. prud

had my own agenda that day my mother wanted me to walk with her. i
couldn't see my own mother's sadness.

   'what?' prudence said. 'come along and watch?'

   'yes, wouldn't that be nice?'

   'no!' prudence said. 'no. no, no. you can't. it would be awful.'


   'awful?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   'awful, awful, awful.'

   as i was wondering why she didn't tell prudence to jump in the lake, mrs.
winterbottom burst into tears and left the table. prudence glowered at me
and stomped out of the kitchen. i sat there looking around at the walls. i
heard the front door open and shut and i heard phoebe call my name. she
came in the house waving a white envelope. 'guess what was on the steps?'
she said.

   mrs. winterbottom reappeared and took the envelope. 'have you opened
it?' she a

sked phoebe.

   'not yet.'

   'i'll open it,' her mother said. she turned the envelope over and over before
she slowly unsealed it and slipped out the message. she held it close to her
so that we couldn't see.

   'well?' phoebe demanded.

   'oh,' mrs. winterbottom said. 'who is doing this?' she held out the piece
of paper. on it was written:

   in the course of a lifetime, what does it matter? prudence joined us 'what
the heck does that mean?' she asked.

   her mother said. 'where are these coming from?'

   'i honestly couldn't say,' phoebe said.

   prudence flopped down on the sofa. 'well, i have more important things to
worry about, i can assure you. i know i'm going to blow those cheerleading
try- outs i just know it.'

   on and on she went, unti

   at that moment, it was as if a click went off in mrs. winterbottom's brain.
she put her hand to her mouth and stared out the window. she was invisible
to prudence and phoebe, though. they did not notice.

   prudence said, 'what is that supposed to mean?'

   phoebe said, 'i was just thinking. are these try-outs such a big deal? will
you even remember them in five years?'

   'yes!' prudence said. 'yes, i most certainly will.'

   'how about ten years? will you remember them in ten?'

   'yes!' prudence said.

   as i walked home, i thought about the message.

people who came back, after death, as a bird or a river or a horse. she even
knew one story about an old warrior who came back as a potato.

   the next thing i knew, mr. birkway was saying, 'right phoebe? phoebe?
are you awake? you have the second report.

   'report?' phoebe said.

   'lucky you! we're letting you go second!'

   'report?'

   mr. birkway clutched his heart and said to the class, 'apparently, miss
phoebe winterbottom did not hear me explain about the reports perhaps you
can enlighten her, mr. finney.

   ben turned slowly around in his chair and cast his sparkling black eyes in
phoebe's direction. he said, 'i'm doing an oral report on prometheus this
friday. you're doing one on pandora next monday.'

   'lucky me,' phoebe muttered. mr. birkway asked me to stay after class for
a minute. phoebe sent me warning messages with her eyebrows. as
everyone else was leaving the room, phoebe said, 'i'll stay with you

and ben. my brain was a mess,
what with trying not to flinch whenever ben brushed against me. when we
left ben and mary lou and turned the corner into phoebe's street, i wasn't
paying much attention. i suppose i was aware that someone was coming
along the sidewalk in our direction, but it wasn't until the person was about
three feet away that i really took notice.

   it was phoebe's lunatic, coming toward us, staring right at us. he stopped
directly in front of us, blocking our way.

   'phoebe winterbottom, right?' he said to phoebe. her voice was a little
squeak. the only sound that came out was a tiny 'erp...

   'what's the matter, phoebe winterbottom?' he said. he slid one hand into
his pocket.


   phoebe pushed him, yanked my arm, and started running. 'oh - my - god!'
she said. 'oh - my - god!'

   i was grateful that we were nearly at phoebe's house, so if he stabbed us in
broad daylight, maybe one of her neighbors would discover our bodies and
take us to the hospital before we bled entir

ely to death. i was actually
beginning to believe he was a lunatic.

   phoebe tugged at her doorknob, but the door was locked. phoebe beat on
the door, and her mother suddenly pulled it open. 'whatever is the matter?'
mrs. winterbottom said. she looked rather pale and shaken herself.

   'it was locked!' phoebe said. 'why was the door locked?'

   'oh, sweetie,' mrs. winterbottom said. 'it's just that - i thought that--' she
peered around us and looked up and down the street. 'did you see someone,
did someone frighten you--?'

   'it was the lunatic,' phoebe said. 'we saw him just now.' she could hardly
catch her breath. 'maybe we should call the police. or tell dad.'

   i took a good long look at phoebe's mother. she did not seem capable of
phoning the police or mr. winterbottom. i think she was more scared than
we were. she went around locking all the doors.

ing more happened that evening and, by the time i went home, the
lunatic did not seem quite so threatening. no one called the police, and, to
my knowledge, mrs. winterbottom had not yet told mr. winterbottom.
right before i left phoebe's house, phoebe said to me, 'if i see the lunatic
once more, i will phone the police myself'


20. the blackberry kiss


   that night, i tried to write the mini journal for mr. birkway. i had a
terrible time coming up with some- thing to write about. first, i made a list
of all the things i liked, and they were all things from bybanks - the trees,
the cows, the chickens, the pigs, the fields, the swimming hole. it was a
complete jumble of things, and when i tried to

d it and sat down, staring at the piece of paper. phoebe
looked over his shoulder and read his note aloud: i had to go away. i can't
explain. i'll call you in a few days. it was signed, norma.

   i had a sinking, sinking feeling.

   prudence started asking a million questions. 'what does she mean? go
away where? why can't she explain? why didn't she tell you? did she
mention this? a few days? where did she go?'

   'maybe we should call the police,' phoebe said.

   'the police? what for?' mr. winterbottom said.

   'i think she was kidnapped or something.

   'oh, phoebe.'

   'i'm serious,' she said. 'maybe a lunatic came in the house and dragged her
off-

   'phoebe, that is not funny.

   'i'm not being funny. i mean it. it could happen.' prudence was still asking
questions. 'where did she go? why didn't she mention this? didn't she tell
you? where did she go?'


   'prudence, i honestly cannot say,' her father said.

   'i think we should call the police,' phoebe said again.

   'phoebe, if

 he said.

   'i think we should call the police,' phoebe said. 'phoebe.

   'i'm serious. i found some suspicious spots.' phoebe pointed toward two
adhesive-taped areas beneath the dining-room table.

   'what's that tape doing down there?' he asked.

   phoebe explained about the potential blood spots

   'blood?' prudence said. she stopped eating.

   phoebe pulled out the envelope and emptied the hair strands on the table
.'strange hairs' phoebe explained.

   prudence said. 'uck.'


   mr. winterbottom tapped his fork against his knife. then he stood up, took
phoebe's arm, and said, 'follow me.' he went to the refrigerator, opened the
freezer compartment, and indicated the plastic containers 'if your mother had
been kidnapped by a lunatic, would she have had time to prepare all these
meals? would she have been able to say, "excuse me, mr. lunatic, while i
prepare ten or twenty meals for my family to eat while i am kidnapped"?'

   'you don't care,' phoebe said. 'nobody cares. everyone has his

 own idiot
agenda.'

   i left shortly after dinner. mr. winterbottom was in his study, phoning his
wife's friends to see if they had any idea of where she might have gone.

   'at least,' phoebe said to me, 'he's taking some action, but i still think
someone should call the police.'

   as i left phoebe's the dead leaf crackly voice of margaret cadaver called
to me from her house next door. 'sal? sal?' i stopped, but i did not go up the
walk. 'do you want to come in?' she said.

   'i have to go home.'

   'but, your father's here - we're having dessert. won't y

he-

   'phoebe, calm down. i don't know why she phoned mrs. cadaver. i haven't
been able to speak to mrs. cadaver myself yet. she isn't home. she left a
note here.' he showed it to phoebe.

   the note said, norma called to say she is ok. beneath mrs. cadaver's
signature was a p.s. saying that mrs. cadaver would be away until monday.


   'i don't believe that mom called mrs. cadaver. mrs. cadaver is making it
up. she probably killed her and chopped her up and buried her under the-

   'phoebe winterbottom--'

   'i'm calling the police.' phoebe said.

   they had a huge argument, but at last phoebe fizzled out. her father said
he had been calling everyone he could think of to see if her mother had
indicated where she might be going. he would continue calling tomorrow,
he promised, and he would speak with mrs. cadaver first thing on monday.
if he did not receive a letter - or a direct phone call - from her mother by
wednesday, he would call the police.

   phoebe came out on the porch with me as

? maybe it was worry. even when everything seems fine and good, i
worry that something will go wrong and change everything.

   my mother, my father and i all seemed fine and happy at our house until
the baby died. could you actually say that the baby died, since it had never
breathed? did its birth and death occur at the same moment? could you die
before you were born?

   phoebe's family had not seemed fine, even before the arrival of the lunatic
and the messages, and the disappearance of mrs. winterbottom. i knew that
phoebe was convinced that her mother was kidnapped because it was
impossible for phoebe to imagine that her mother could leave for any other
reason. i wanted to call phoebe and suggest that maybe her mother had gone
looking for something, maybe her mother was unhappy, maybe there was
nothing phoebe could do about it.

   when i told this part to gram and gramps, gramps said, 'you mean it had
nothing to do with peeby?'

   'right,' i said. 'what phoebe didn't know was that it had no

   'perhaps you could have these analyzed,' she suggested.

   sergeant bickle looked at the woman, and again the corners of his mouth
twitched slightly. the woman removed her glasses and wiped the lenses

   they were not taking us seriously, and i felt my 'ornery donkey-self
waking up. i mentioned the potential blood spots that phoebe had marked
with adhesive tape.


   'but, my father removed the tape,' phoebe said. sergeant bickle said,
'well, thank you very much, miss winterbottom and miss--?'

   'hiddle,' i said. 'salamanca hiddle.'

   'miss winterbottom and miss hiddle, i wonder if you would excuse me a
few minutes? would you mind waiting here?' to the woman, he said, 'why
don't you stay with these young ladies?'

   so, we sat there with the woman. she asked phoebe mrs. said. about
school and about her father and her mother and her sister. she had an awful
lot of questions i kept wondering where sergeant bickle had gone and when
he was coming back. he was gone for o

asked the woman if she might try on her glasses. the woman handed them to
phoebe.

   'goodness!' phoebe said. 'the world must look very different to you than it
does to me.

   'yes' she said, 'i suppose it does.'

   'i am certainly glad that i can see normally,' phoebe said.

   sergeant bickle finally returned. behind him was phoebe's father. phoebe
looked extensively relieved, but i knew it was not a coincidence that her
father had come to the police while we were there as well.

   'miss winterbottom,' sergeant bickle said, 'your father is going to take
you and miss hiddle home now.

   'but--' phoebe said.

   'mr. winterbottom, we'll be in touch. and, remember, if you would like
me to speak with mrs. cadaver--

   'oh, no,' mr. winterbottom said. he looked embarrassed. 'really, that
won't be necessary. i do apologize.


   we followed mr. winterbottom outside. in the car he said nothing. i
thought he might drop me off at my house, but he did not. when we got to
their house, the only thin

m where his own mother was, but it was
too late. the finneys would be asleep.

   instead, i lay there thinking of the poem about the traveller, and i could see
the tide rising and falling, and those horrid little white hands snatching the
traveller. how could it be normal, that traveller dying? and how could such
a thing be normal and terrible both at the same time?

   i stayed awake the whole night. i knew that if i closed my eyes, i would
see the tide and the white hands. i thought about mr. winterbottom crying.
that was the saddest thing. it was sadder than seeing my own father cry,
because my father is the sort of person you expect might cry if he was
terribly upset. but i had never, ever, expected mr. winterbottom - stiff mr.
winterbottom - to cry. it was the first time i realized that he actually cared
about mrs. winterbottom.

   as soon as it was daylight, i phoned phoebe. 'phoebe, we've got to find
her.

   'why would they do that?'

   'who knows? i'm sick of it. my mother can stay there for all i care. she
doesn't need me. she doesn't need any of us.'

   phoebe was like that all the way home on the bus. she was in an
extensively black mood. i did not tell her about ben. we got back to
phoebe's house just as her father pulled in the driveway. prudence rushed
out of the house saying, 'she called, she called, she called!'

   'who called?' mr. winterbottom said.

   prudence was beside herself. 'mom, of course. just ten minutes ago. she's
coming home.'

   'terrific,' phoebe muttered.

   'what was that, phoebe?' her father said.

   'nothing.'

   'she's coming tomorrow,' prudence said. 'but--'

   'what's wrong?' her father said. 'what else did she say?'

   prudence twisted a strand of hair around her finger. 'she sounded a bit
nervous. she wanted to talk with you--'


   'did she leave a number? i'll call her back--

   'no, she didn't leave

and margaret were sitting on the porch.

   'oh, sal,' margaret said. 'my brother told me you're in his english class.
what a surprise.' she must have already told my father this, because he
didn't look too surprised. 'he's a terrific teacher. do you like him?'

   'i suppose.' i didn't want to talk about it. i wanted margaret to vanish.


   i had to wait until she went home to tell my father about phoebe's mother,
and when i did tell him, all he said was, 'so, mrs. winterbottom is coming
home. that's good. then he went over to the window and stared out of it for
the longest time, and i knew he was thinking about my mother.

   all that night i thought about phoebe and prudence and mr. winterbottom.
it seemed like their whole world was going to fall apart the next day when
mrs. winterbottom walked in all cuddly with the lunatic.


40. homecoming


   the next morning, phoebe phoned, begging me to come over. 'i can't stand
it,' she said. 'i want a witness'

   'for what

s too good. your mother will think we can function without her." so
they messed things up a little. he is very put out with me that i wouldn't
help.'

   i tried to think of a good reason why i could not go to phoebe's i did not
want to be a witness to anything, but, in the end, i felt guilty for running
away the day before, and so i agreed.. when i got to her house, phoebe, mr.
winterbottom and prudence were sitting there staring at each other.

   'didn't she say what time she was coming?' mr. winterbottom asked.

   prudence said, 'no, she did not, and i wish you would quit acting as if it is
my fault that she did not say more than she did.'

   mr. winterbottom was a wreck. he jumped up to straighten a pillow, sat
back down, and then he leaped up to mess up the pillow again. he went out
in the yard and walked around in circles. he changed his shirt twice.


   'i hope you don't mind that i am here,' i said.

   'why would i mind?' mr. winterbottom said.

tark raving mad, a taxi pulled up
outside. 'i can't look,' mr. winterbottom said, escaping to the kitchen.

   'i can't look either,' phoebe said. she followed her father, and i followed
phoebe.

   'well, gosh,' prudence said. 'i don't know what has gotten into everybody.
aren't you excited to see her?'

   from the kitchen, we heard prudence open the front door. we heard mrs.
winterbottom say, 'oh, sweetie-- mr. winterbottom wiped the kitchen
counter. we heard prudence gasp and her mother say, 'i'd like you to meet
mike.'

   'mike?' mr. winterbottom said. he was quite red in the face. i was glad
there was no axe in the house or i am fairly certain he would have picked it
up and headed straight for mike.

   phoebe said, 'now, dad, don't do anything too rash--'

   'mike?' he repeated.

   mrs. winterbottom called, 'george? phoebe?' we heard her say to
prudence, 'where are they? didn't you tell them we were coming?

'

   mr. winterbottom took a deep breath. he said, 'phoebe, i'm not sure you
or sal should be around for this'

   'are you kidding?' phoebe said. he took another deep breath. 'ok,' he said.
'ok. here we go.' he stood up straight and tall and walked through to the
living room. phoebe and i followed.

   honest and truly, i think phoebe nearly fainted dead away on the carpet.
there were two reasons for this the first one was that mrs. winterbottom
looked different. her hair was not only short but also quite stylish. she was

wearing lipstick, mascara and a little blush on her cheeks, and her clothes
were altogether unlike anything i had ever seen her in: a white t-shirt, blue
jeans, and flat black shoes dangling from her ears were thin silver hoop
earrings she looked magnificent, but she did not look like phoebe's mother.

   the second reason that i think phoebe nearly fainted dead away was that
there was mike bickle, phoebe's potentia

l lunatic, in her own living room. it
was one thing to think he was coming, and another thing to actually see him
standing there.

   i didn't know what to think. for a second, i thought maybe mike had
kidnapped mrs. winterbottom and was bringing her back for some ransom
money or maybe he was now going to do away with the rest of us but i kept
thinking of seeing them together the day before, and besides, mrs.
winterbottom looked too terrific to have been held captive. mrs.
winterbottom did look a little frightened, but not of mike. she seemed
afraid of her husband.

   'dad,' phoebe whispered, 'that's the lunatic.'

   'oh, phoebe,' her mother said, pressing her fingers to her cheek, and when
she made that familiar gest

ure, phoebe looked as if her heart was splitting
into a thou- sand pieces. mrs. winterbottom hugged phoebe, but phoebe did
not hug her back.

   mr. winterbotttom said, 'norma, i hope you are going to explain exactly
what is going on here.' he was trying to make his voice firm, but it trembled.

   prudence stood there, staring at mike. she seemed to find him quite
handsome and was flirting with him. she fluffed her hair away from her
neck.

   mrs. winterbottom went up to mr. winterbottom and tried to put her arms
around him, but he pulled away. 'i think we deserve an explanation,' he said.
he was staring at mike.

   so was i. i was quite confused. was she in love with mike? and, if she
was in love with him, he seemed awfully, awfully young. he didn't seem
much older than prudence.


   mrs. winterbottom sat down on the sofa and began to cry. it was a terrible,
terrible moment. it was thumpingly hard to make any sense out of what she
said at first. she was talking about being 
 
 ___________________________
 
respectable and how maybe mr.
winterbottom would never forgive her, but she was tired of being so
respectable. she said she had tried very, very hard all these years to be
perfect, but that she had to admit she was quite imperfect. she said there was
something that she had never told her husband, and she feared he would not
forgive her for it.

   mr. winterbottom's hands were trembling. he did not say anything. mrs.
winterbottom motioned for mike to join her on the sofa. mr. winterbottom
cleared his throat several times, but still he said nothing.

   mrs. winterbottom said, 'this is my son.'

   i think that mr. winterbottom, prudence, phoebe and i all said at exactly
the same time, 'your son?'

   mrs. winterbottom stared at her husband. 'george,' she said, 'i know you
will think i am not - or was not - respectable, but it was before i met you,
and i had to give him up for adoption and i could hardly bear to think of it
and--'

   mr. winterbottom said. 'respectable? respecta

ble? the hell with
respectable!' mr. winterbottom did not normally swear.

   mrs. winterbottom stood up. 'mike found me, and at first i was frightened
of what that would mean. i've lived such a tiny life--

   phoebe took her father's hand.

   '-and i had to go away and sort things out. i haven't yet met mike's
adoptive parents, but mike and i have spent a lot of time talking, and i've
been thinking--'

   mike sat there looking down at his feet.

   'are you going to leave?' mr. winterbottom asked.

   mrs. winterbottom looked as if he had slapped her. 'leave?' she said.


   'again, i mean,' mr. winterbottom said.

   'only if you want me to,' she said. 'only if you cannot live with such an
unrespectable--

   'i said to hell with respectable!' mr. winterbottom said. 'what's all this
about respectable? it's not respect- able i'm concerned about. i'm more
concerned that you couldn't - or wouldn't - tell me about any of this.'

   mike stood up. 'i knew it wouldn't work,' he said.

   mr. winterbottom said, 'i have nothing against you, mike - i just don't
know you.' he looked at his wife. 'i don't think i know you, either.

   i was wishing i was invisible. i stared out the window at the leaves falling
to the ground, and i was infinitely sad, sad down to my bones. i was sad for
phoebe and her parents and prudence and mike, i was sad for the leaves that
were dying, and i was sad for myself, for something i had lost.

   i saw mrs. partridge out front, standing on phoebe's front walk.

   mr.

winterbottom said, 'i think we all need to sit down and talk. maybe
we can sort something out. then he did what i think was a noble thing. he
went over to mike and shook his hand and said, 'i did always think a son
would be a nice addition to this family.

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively relieved. prudence smiled at mike.
phoebe stood quite still off to the side.

   'i'd better go,' i said.

   everyone turned to me as if i had just dropped through the roof. mr.
winterbottom said, 'sal, oh, i am sorry, i truly am.' to mike, he said, 'sal is
like another member of the family.

   mrs. winterbottom went over to phoebe. 'you're mad at me, aren't you,
phoebe?'


   'yes,' phoebe said. 'i most certainly am.' phoebe took my sleeve and pulled
me toward the door. s
