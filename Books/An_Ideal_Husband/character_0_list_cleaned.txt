sir[CHARACTER]  - 
      sir robert is the play's "tragic" hero, a government official who owes his success and fortune to secret scandal. as the stage notes indicate, sir robert is a "personality of mark" with a manner of impeccable distinction; the contrast between his chiseled jaw and romantic eyes suggests a violently willed separation of thought and emotion in his personality. sir robert suffers from certain divided loyalties as well. extremely ambitious, sir robert remains tied, even at present, to his mentor baron arnheim' s gospels of wealth and power, gospels that emphasize the domination of others over all else. on the other hand, love has driven him to hide his past in the desperate hope of remaining the ideal husband to his wife. conscious of what his success has c ost him, sir robert suffers from a decidedly nervous and harried temperament.
