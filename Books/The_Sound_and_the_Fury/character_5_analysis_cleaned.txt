[CHARACTER]
a moaning, speechless idiot, benjy is utterly dependent
upon caddy, his only real source of affection. benjy cannot understand any
abstract concepts such as time, cause and effect, or right and wrong--he
merely absorbs visual and auditory cues from the world around him.
despite his utter inability to understand or interpret the world,
however, benjy does have an acute sensitivity to order and chaos,
and he can immediately sense the presence of anything bad, wrong,
or out of place. he is able to sense quentin's suicide thousands
of miles away at harvard, and senses caddy's promiscuity and loss
of virginity. in light of this ability, benjy is one of the only characters
who truly takes notice of the compson family's progressing decline.
however, his disability renders benjy unable to formulate any response
other than moaning and crying. benjy's impotence--and the impotence
of all the remaining compson men--is symbolized and embodied by his
castration during his teenage years.
