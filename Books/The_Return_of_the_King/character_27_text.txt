n silence. then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and merry being thÃ©odenâ€™s esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king.
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragornâ€™s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many captains and knights. never had any king of the mark such company upon the road as went with thÃ©oden thengelâ€™s son to the land of his home.
without haste and at peace they passed into anÃ³rien, and they came to the grey wood under amon din; and there they heard a sound as of drums beating in the hills, though no living thing could be seen. then aragorn let the trumpets be blown; and heralds crie

€˜woods may spread. but not ents. there are no entings.â€™
â€˜yet maybe there is now more hope in your search,â€™ said aragorn. â€˜lands will lie open to you eastward that have long been closed.â€™
but treebeard shook his head and said: â€˜it is far to go. and there are too many men there in these days. but i am forgetting my manners! will you stay here and rest a while? and maybe there are some that would be pleased to pass through fangorn forest and so shorten their road home?â€™ he looked at celeborn and galadriel.
but all save legolas said that they must now take their leave and depart, either south or west. â€˜come, gimli!â€™ said legolas. â€˜now by fangornâ€™s leave i will visit the deep places of the entwood and see such trees as are nowhere else to be found in middle-earth. you shall come with me and keep your word; and thus we will journey on together to our own lands in mirkwood and beyond.â€™ to this gimli agreed, though with no great delight, it seemed.
â€˜here then at last comes the ending of t

 will return to my land with the help that you promised.â€™
â€˜we will come, if our own lords allow it,â€™ said gimli. â€˜well, farewell. my hobbits! you should come safe to your own homes now, and i shall not be kept awake for fear of your peril. we will send word when we may, and some of us may yet meet at times; but i fear that we shall not all be gathered together ever again.â€™
then treebeard said farewell to each of them in turn, and he bowed three times slowly and with great reverence to celeborn and galadriel. â€˜it is long, long since we met by stock or by stone, a vanimar, vanimÃ¡lion nostari!â€™ he said. â€˜it is sad that we should meet only thus at the ending. for the world is changing: i feel it in the water, i feel it in the earth, and i smell it in the air. i do not think we shall meet again.â€™
and celeborn said: â€˜i do not know, eldest.â€™ but galadriel said: â€˜not in middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. then in the willow-meads of tasarinan we ma

n for you would not wish to see what the stone of minas tirith would show you. but the palantÃ­r of orthanc the king will keep, to see what is passing in his realm, and what his servants are doing. for do not forget, peregrin took, that you are a knight of gondor, and i do not release you from your service. you are going now on leave, but i may recall you. and remember, dear friends of the shire, that my realm lies also in the north, and i shall come there one day.â€™
then aragorn took leave of celeborn and galadriel; and the lady said to him: â€˜elfstone, through darkness you have come to your hope, and have now all your desire. use well the days!â€™
but celeborn said: â€˜kinsman, farewell! may your doom be other than mine, and your treasure remain with you to the end!â€™
with that they parted, and it was then the time of sunset; and when after a while they turned and looked back, they saw the king of the west sitting upon his horse with his knights about him; and the falling sun shone upon them and made a

: there countless swans housed in a land of reeds.
so they passed into eregion, and at last a fair morning dawned, shimmering above gleaming mists; and looking from their camp on a low hill the travellers saw away in the east the sun catching three peaks that thrust up into the sky through floating clouds: caradhras, celebdil, and fanuidhol. they were near to the gates of moria.
here now for seven days they tarried, for the time was at hand for another parting which they were loth to make. soon celeborn and galadriel and their folk would turn eastward, and so pass by the redhorn gate and down the dimrill stair to the silverlode and to their own country. they had journeyed thus far by the west-ways, for they had much to speak of with elrond and with gandalf, and here they lingered still in converse with their friends. often long after the hobbits were wrapped in sleep they would sit together under the stars, recalling the ages that were gone and all their joys and labours in the world, or holding council, co
