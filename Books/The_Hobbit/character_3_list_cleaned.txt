[CHARACTER] - 
                    a
strange, small, slimy creature who lives deep in the caves of moria
beneath the misty mountains. there, [CHARACTER] broods over his "precious,"
a magic ring, until he accidentally loses it and bilbo finds it.
we never learn exactly what kind of creature he is. apparently, his
true shape has been too deformed by years of living in darkness
to be recognizable.
