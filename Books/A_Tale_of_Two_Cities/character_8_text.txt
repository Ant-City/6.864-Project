ng whispers of his story, brought him.
his scientific knowledge, and his vigilance and skill in conducting
ingenious experiments, brought him otherwise into moderate request, and
he earned as much as he wanted.

these things were within mr. jarvis lorryâ€™s knowledge, thoughts, and
notice, when he rang the door-bell of the tranquil house in the corner,
on the fine sunday afternoon.

â€œdoctor manette at home?â€

expected home.

â€œmiss lucie at home?â€

expected home.

â€œmiss pross at home?â€

possibly at home, but of a certainty impossible for handmaid to
anticipate intentions of miss pross, as to admission or denial of the
fact.

â€œas i am at home myself,â€ said mr. lorry, â€œiâ€™ll go upstairs.â€

although the doctorâ€™s daughter had known nothing of the country of her
birth, she appeared to have innately derived from it that ability to
make much of little means, which is one of its most useful and most
agreeable characteristics. simple as the furniture

rustle of the plane-tree in the yard, was the
doctorâ€™s bedroom, and there, in a corner, stood the disused shoemakerâ€™s
bench and tray of tools, much as it had stood on the fifth floor of the
dismal house by the wine-shop, in the suburb of saint antoine in paris.

â€œi wonder,â€ said mr. lorry, pausing in his looking about, â€œthat he keeps
that reminder of his sufferings about him!â€

â€œand why wonder at that?â€ was the abrupt inquiry that made him start.

it proceeded from miss pross, the wild red woman, strong of hand, whose
acquaintance he had first made at the royal george hotel at dover, and
had since improved.

â€œi should have thought--â€ mr. lorry began.

â€œpooh! youâ€™d have thought!â€ said miss pross; and mr. lorry left off.

â€œhow do you do?â€ inquired that lady then--sharply, and yet as if to
express that she bore him no malice.

â€œi am pretty well, i thank you,â€ answered mr. lorry, with meekness; â€œhow
are you?â€

â€œnothing to boast of,â

â€œindeed?â€

â€œah! indeed!â€ said miss pross. â€œi am very much put out about my
ladybird.â€

â€œindeed?â€

â€œfor gracious sake say something else besides â€˜indeed,â€™ or youâ€™ll
fidget me to death,â€ said miss pross: whose character (dissociated from
stature) was shortness.

â€œreally, then?â€ said mr. lorry, as an amendment.

â€œreally, is bad enough,â€ returned miss pross, â€œbut better. yes, i am
very much put out.â€

â€œmay i ask the cause?â€

â€œi donâ€™t want dozens of people who are not at all worthy of ladybird, to
come here looking after her,â€ said miss pross.

â€œ_do_ dozens come for that purpose?â€

â€œhundreds,â€ said miss pross.

it was characteristic of this lady (as of some other people before her
time and since) that whenever her original proposition was questioned,
she exaggerated it.

â€œdear me!â€ said mr. lorry, as the sa

fest remark he could think of.

â€œi have lived with the darling--or the darling has lived with me, and
paid me for it; which she certainly should never have done, you may take
your affidavit, if i could have afforded to keep either myself or her
for nothing--since she was ten years old. and itâ€™s really very hard,â€
 said miss pross.

not seeing with precision what was very hard, mr. lorry shook his head;
using that important part of himself as a sort of fairy cloak that would
fit anything.

â€œall sorts of people who are not in the least degree worthy of the pet,
are always turning up,â€ said miss pross. â€œwhen you began it--â€

â€œ_i_ began it, miss pross?â€

â€œdidnâ€™t you? who brought her father to life?â€

â€œoh! if _that_ was beginning it--â€ said mr. lorry.

â€œit wasnâ€™t ending it, i suppose?

 i say, when you began it, it was hard
enough; not that i have any fault to find with doctor manette, except
that he is not worthy of such a daughter, which is no imputation on
him, for it was not to be expected that anybody should be, under any
circumstances. but it really is doubly and trebly hard to have crowds
and multitudes of people turning up after him (i could have forgiven
him), to take ladybirdâ€™s affections away from me.â€

mr. lorry knew miss pross to be very jealous, but he also knew her by
this time to be, beneath the service of her eccentricity, one of those
unselfish creatures--found only among women--who will, for pure love and
admiration, bind themselves willing slaves, to youth when they have lost
it, to beauty that they never had, to accomplishments that they were
never fortunate enough to gain, to bright hopes that never shone upon
their own sombre lives. he knew enough of the world to know that there
is nothing in it bett

er than the faithful service of the heart; so
rendered and so free from any mercenary taint, he had such an exalted
respect for it, that in the retributive arrangements made by his own
mind--we all make such arrangements, more or less--he stationed miss
pross much nearer to the lower angels than many ladies immeasurably
better got up both by nature and art, who had balances at tellsonâ€™s.

â€œthere never was, nor will be, but one man worthy of ladybird,â€ said
miss pross; â€œand that was my brother solomon, if he hadnâ€™t made a
mistake in life.â€

here again: mr. lorryâ€™s inquiries into miss prossâ€™s personal history had
established the fact that her brother solomon was a heartless scoundrel
who had stripped her of everything she possessed, as a stake to
speculate with, and had abandoned her in her poverty for evermore, with
no touch of compunction. miss prossâ€™s fidelity of belief in solomon

â€œas we happen to be alone for the moment, and are both people of
business,â€ he said, when they had got back to the drawing-room and had
sat down there in friendly relations, â€œlet me ask you--does the doctor,
in talking with lucie, never refer to the shoemaking time, yet?â€

â€œnever.â€

â€œand yet keeps that bench and those tools beside him?â€

â€œah!â€ returned miss pross, shaking her head. â€œbut i donâ€™t say he donâ€™t
refer to it within himself.â€

â€œdo you believe that he thinks of it much?â€

â€œi do,â€ said miss pross.

â€œdo you imagine--â€ mr. lorry had begun, when miss pross took him up
short with:

â€œnever imagine anything. have no imagination at all.â€

â€œi stand corrected; do you suppose--you go so far as to suppose,
sometimes?â€

â€œnow and then,â€ said miss pross.

â€œdo you suppose,â€ mr. lorry went on, with a laughing

s it looked kindly at her, â€œthat doctor manette has any
theory of his own, preserved through all those years, relative to
the cause of his being so oppressed; perhaps, even to the name of his
oppressor?â€

â€œi donâ€™t suppose anything about it but what ladybird tells me.â€

â€œand that is--?â€

â€œthat she thinks he has.â€

â€œnow donâ€™t be angry at my asking all these questions; because i am a
mere dull man of business, and you are a woman of business.â€

â€œdull?â€ miss pross inquired, with placidity.

rather wishing his modest adjective away, mr. lorry replied, â€œno, no,
no. surely not. to return to business:--is it not remarkable that doctor
manette, unquestionably innocent of any crime as we are all well assured
he is, should never touch upon that question? i will not say with me,
though he had business relations with me many years ago, and we are now
intimate; i will say with the fair daughter to whom he is so devotedly
attached, and who is so devotedly

pross, i donâ€™t approach the topic with you, out of curiosity, but out of
zealous interest.â€

â€œwell! to the best of my understanding, and badâ€™s the best, youâ€™ll tell
me,â€ said miss pross, softened by the tone of the apology, â€œhe is afraid
of the whole subject.â€

â€œafraid?â€

â€œitâ€™s plain enough, i should think, why he may be. itâ€™s a dreadful
remembrance. besides that, his loss of himself grew out of it. not
knowing how he lost himself, or how he recovered himself, he may never
feel certain of not losing himself again. that alone wouldnâ€™t make the
subject pleasant, i should think.â€

it was a profounder remark than mr. lorry had looked for. â€œtrue,â€ s

he, â€œand fearful to reflect upon. yet, a doubt lurks in my mind, miss
pross, whether it is good for doctor manette to have that suppression
always shut up within him. indeed, it is this doubt and the uneasiness
it sometimes causes me that has led me to our present confidence.â€

in short, must leave it alone, like or no like. sometimes, he gets up in
the dead of the night, and will be heard, by us overhead there, walking
up and down, walking up and down, in his room. ladybird has learnt to

his old prison. she hurries to him, and they go on together, walking up

, until he is composed. but he never says
a word of the true reason of his restlessness, to her, and she finds it
best not to hint at it to him. in silence they go walking up and down
together, walking up and down together, till her love and company have
brought him to himself.â€

notwithstanding miss prossâ€™s denial of her own imagination, there was a
perception of the pain of being monotonously haunted by one sad idea,
in her repetition of the phrase, walking up and down, which testified to
her possessing such a thing.

the corner has been mentioned as a wonderful corner for echoes; it
had begun to echo so resoundingly to the tread of coming feet, that it
seemed as though the very mention of that weary pacing to and fro had
set it going.

it was such a curious corner in its acoustical properties, such a
peculiar ear of a place, that as mr. lorry stood at the open window,
looking for the father and daughter whose steps he heard, he fancied
they would never approach. not only would the echoes die away, as though
the steps had gone; but, echoes of other steps that never came would be
heard in their stead, and would die away for good when they seemed close
at hand. however, father and daughter did at last appear, and miss pross
was ready at the street door to receive them.

miss pross was a pleasant sight, albeit wild, and red, and grim, taking
off her darlingâ€™s bonnet when she came up-stairs, and touching it up
with the ends of her handkerchief, and blowing the dust off it, and
folding her mantle ready for laying by, and smoothing her rich hair with
as much pride as she could possibly have taken in her own hair if she
had been the vainest and handsomest of women. her darling was a pleasant

her taking so much trouble for her--which last she only dared to do
playfully, or miss pross, sorely hurt, would have retired to her own

them, and telling miss pross how she spoilt lucie, in accents and with
eyes that had as much spoiling in them as miss pross had, and would
have had more if it were possible. mr. lorry was a pleasant sight too,
beaming at all this in his little wig, and thanking his bachelor
stars for having lighted him in his declining years to a home. but, no
hundreds of people came to see the sights, and mr. lorry looked in vain
for the fulfilment of miss prossâ€™s prediction.

dinner-time, and still no hundreds of people. in the arrangements of
the little household, miss pross took charge of the lower regions, and
always

 acquitted herself marvellously. her dinners, of a very modest
quality, were so well cooked and so well served, and so neat in their
contrivances, half english and half french, that nothing could be
better. miss prossâ€™s friendship being of the thoroughly practical
kind, she had ravaged soho and the adjacent provinces, in search of
impoverished french, who, tempted by shillings and half-crowns, would
impart culinary mysteries to her. from these decayed sons and daughters
of gaul, she had acquired such wonderful arts, that the woman and girl
who formed the staff of domestics regarded her as quite a sorceress,
or cinderellaâ€™s godmother: who would send out for a fowl, a rabbit,
a vegetable or two from

 the garden, and change them into anything she
pleased.

on sundays, miss pross dined at the doctorâ€™s table, but on other days
persisted in taking her meals at unknown periods, either in the lower
regions, or in her own room on the second floor--a blue chamber, to
which no one but her ladybird ever gained admittance. on this occasion,
miss pross, responding to ladybirdâ€™s pleasant face and pleasant efforts
to please her, unbent exceedingly; so the dinner was very pleasant, too.

it was an oppressive day, and, after dinner, lucie proposed that the
wine should be carried out under the plane-tree, and they should sit
there in the air. as everything turned upon her, and revolved about her,
they went out under the plane-tree, and she carried the wine down for
the special benefit of mr. lorry. she had installed herself, some

plane-tree, talking, she kept his glass replenished. mysterious backs
and ends of houses peeped at them as they talked, and the plane-tree
whispered to them in its own way above their heads.

still, the hundreds of people did not present themselves. mr. darnay
presented himself while they were sitting under the plane-tree, but he
was only one.

doctor manette received him kindly, and so did lucie. but, miss pross
suddenly became afflicted with a twitching in the head and body, and
retired into the house. she was not unfrequently the victim of this
disorder, and she called it, in familiar conversation, â€œa fit of the
jerks.â€

the doctor was in his best condition, and looked specially young. the
resemblance between him and lucie was very strong at such times, and as
they sat side by side, she leaning on his shoulder, and he resting
his arm on the back of her chair, it was very agreeable to tra

towards charles darnay, the same singular look that had been upon it
when it turned towards him in the passages of the court house.

he recovered himself so quickly, however, that mr. lorry had doubts of
his business eye. the arm of the golden giant in the hall was not more
steady than he was, when he stopped under it to remark to them that he
was not yet proof against slight surprises (if he ever would be), and
that the rain had startled him.

her, and yet no hundreds of people. mr. carton had lounged in, but he
made only two.

the night was so very sultry, that although they sat with doors and
windows open, they were overpowered by heat. when the tea-table was
done with, they all moved to one of the windows, and looked out into the
heavy twilight. lucie sat by her father; darnay sat beside her; carton
leaned against a window. the curtains were long and white, and some of

much as a single spoken word, disclosed to her the state of his heart.

that he had his reasons for this, he knew full well. it was again a
summer day when, lately arrived in london from his college occupation,
he turned into the quiet corner in soho, bent on seeking an opportunity
of opening his mind to doctor manette. it was the close of the summer
day, and he knew lucie to be out with miss pross.

he found the doctor reading in his arm-chair at a window. the energy
which had at once supported him under his old sufferings and aggravated
their sharpness, had been gradually restored to him. he was now a
very energetic man indeed, with great firmness of purpose, strength
of resolution, and vigour of action. in his recovered energy he was
sometimes a little fitful and sudden, as he had at first been in the
exercise of his other recovered faculties; but, this had never been

should love you, you shall tell me on your marriage morning. do you
promise?â€

â€œwillingly.

â€œgive me your hand. she will be home directly, and it is better she
should not see us together to-night. go! god bless you!â€

it was dark when charles darnay left him, and it was an hour later and
darker when lucie came home; she hurried into the room alone--for
miss pross had gone straight up-stairs--and was surprised to find his
reading-chair empty.

â€œmy father!â€ she called to him. â€œfather dear!â€

nothing was said in answer, but she heard a low hammering sound in his
bedroom. passing lightly across the intermediate room, she looked in at
his door and came running back frightened, crying to herself, with her
blood all chilled, â€œwhat shall i do! what shall i do!â€

her uncertainty lasted but a moment; she hurried back, and tapped at
his door

he embraced her, solemnly commended her to heaven, and humbly thanked
heaven for having bestowed her on him. by-and-bye, they went into the
house.

there was no one bidden to the marriage but mr. lorry; there was even to
be no bridesmaid but the gaunt miss pross. the marriage was to make no
change in their place of residence; they had been able to extend it,
by taking to themselves the upper rooms formerly belonging to the
apocryphal invisible lodger, and they desired nothing more.

doctor manette was very cheerful at the little supper. they were only
three at table, and miss pross made the third. he regretted that charles
was not there; was more than half disposed to object to the loving
little plot that kept him away; and drank to him affecti

more, and went away. so, the sunrise came, and the shadows of the leaves
of the plane-tree moved upon his face, as softly as her lips had moved
in praying for him.




xviii. nine days


the marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the
closed door of the doctorâ€™s room, where he was speaking with charles
darnay. they were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, mr.
lorry, and miss pross--to whom the event, through a gradual process of
reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss,
but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother solomon should
have been the bridegroom.

â€œand so,â€ said mr. lorry, who could not sufficiently admire the bride,
and who had been moving round her to take in every point of her quiet,
pretty dress; â€œand so it was for this, my sweet lucie, that i brought
you across the channel, such a baby! lord bless me! h

on occasion.)

door at parting.

it was a hard parting, though it was not for long. but her father
cheered her, and said at last, gently disengaging himself from her
enfolding arms, â€œtake her, charles! she is yours!â€

and her agitated hand waved to them from a chaise window, and she was
gone.

the corner being out of the way of the idle and curious, and the
preparations having been very simple and few, the doctor, mr. lorry,
and miss pross, were left quite alone. it was when they turned into
the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that mr. lorry observed a great
change to have come over the doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted
there, had struck him a poisoned blow.

he had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been
expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. but, it was
the old scared lost look that troubled mr. lorry; and through his absent
manner of clasping his head and drearily wander

presently. then, we will take him a ride into the country, and dine
there, and all will be well.â€

it was easier for mr. lorry to look in at tellsonâ€™s, than to look out of
tellsonâ€™s. he was detained two hours. when he came back, he ascended the
old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; goi

he doesnâ€™t know me, and is making shoes!â€

mr. lorry said what he could to calm her, and went himself into the
doctorâ€™s room. the bench was turned towards the light, as it had been
when he had seen the shoemaker at his work before, and his head was bent
down, and he was very busy.

the air. the only ray of hope that mr. lorry could discover, was, that
he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. in that, there
seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity--as though he were
trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.

two things at once impressed themselves on mr. lorry, as important above
all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from lucie;
the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. in
conjunction with miss pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter
precaution, by giving out that the doctor was not well, and required a
few days of complete rest. in aid of the kind deception to be practised
on his daughter, miss pross was to write, describing his having been
called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of
two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been
addressed to her by the same post.

looked up in the old manner, and repeated in the old low voice:

â€œout?â€

â€œyes; for a walk with me. why not?â€

he made no effort to say why not, and said not a word more. but, mr.
lorry thought he saw, as he leaned forward on his bench in the dusk,
with his elbows on his knees and his head in his hands, that he was in
some misty way asking himself, â€œwhy not?â€ the sagacity of the man of
business perceived an advantage here, and determined to hold it.

miss pross and he divided the night into two watches, and observed him
at intervals from the adjoining room. he paced up and down for a long
time before he lay down; but, when he did finally lay himself down, he
fell asleep. in the morning, he was up betimes, and went straight to his
bench and to work.

on this second day, mr. lorry saluted him cheerfully by his name,
and spoke to him on topics that had been of late familiar to them. he
returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was

said, and
that he thought about it, however confusedly. this encouraged mr. lorry
to have miss pross in with her work, several times during the day;
at those times, they quietly spoke of lucie, and of her father then
present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing
amiss. this was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long
enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened mr. lorryâ€™s
friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he
appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding
him.

it was but the inquiry of his first confusion and astonishment, the
answer being obvious. if the impression were not produced by a real
corresponding and sufficient cause, how came he, jarvis lorry, there?
how came he to have fallen asleep, in his clothes, on the sofa in doctor
manetteâ€™s consulting-room, and to be debating these points outside the
doctorâ€™s bedroom door in the early morning?

within a few minutes, miss pross stood whispering at his side. if he
had had any particle of doubt left, her talk would of necessity have
resolved it; but he was by that time clear-headed, and had none.
he advised that they should let the time go by until the regular
breakfast-hour, and should then meet the doctor as if nothing unusual
had occurred. if he appeared to be in his customary state of mind, mr.
lorry would then cautiously proceed to seek direction and guidance from
the opinion he had been, in his anxiety, so

miss pross, submitting herself to his judgment, the scheme was worked
out with care. having abundance of time for his usual methodical
toilette, mr. lorry presented himself at the breakfast-hour in his usual
white linen, and with his usual neat leg. the doctor was summoned in the
usual way, and came to breakfast.

delicate and gradual approaches which mr. lorry felt to be the only safe

would overset the delicate organisation of the mind, and yet with the
confidence of a man who had slowly won his assurance out of personal
endurance and distress. it was not for his friend to abate that
confidence. he professed himself more relieved and encouraged than he
really was, and approached his second and last point. he felt it to
be the most difficult of all; but, remembering his old sunday morning
conversation with miss pross, and remembering what he had seen in the
last nine days, he knew that he must face it.

time, to work at a little forge. we will say that he was unexpectedly

ountry, and the doctor was quite restored. on the
three following days he remained perfectly well, and on the fourteenth
day he went away to join lucie and her husband. the precaution that
had been taken to account for his silence, mr. lorry had previously
explained to him, and he had written to lucie in accordance with it, and
she had no suspicions.

on the night of the day on which he left the house, mr. lorry went into
his room with a chopper, saw, chisel, and hammer, attended by miss pross
carrying a light. there, with closed doors, and in a mysterious and
guilty manner, mr. lorry hacked the shoemakerâ€™s bench to pieces, while
miss pross held the candle as if she were assisting at a murder--for
which, indeed, in her grimness, she was no unsuitable figure. the
burning of the body (previously reduced to pieces convenient for the
purpose) was commenced without delay in the kitchen fire; and the tools,
shoes, and leather, were buried in the garden. so wicked do destruction

when the newly-married pair came home, the first person who appeared, to
offer his congratulations, was sydney carton. they had not been at home
many hours, when he presented himself. he was not improved in habits, or
in looks, or in manner; but there was a certain rugged air of fidelity
about him, which was new to

ever busily winding the golden thread that bound them all together,
weaving the service of her happy influence through the tissue of all
their lives, and making it predominate nowhere, lucie heard in the
echoes of years none but friendly and soothing sounds. her husbandâ€™s
step was strong and prosperous among them; her fatherâ€™s firm and equal.
lo, miss pross, in harness of string, awakening the echoes, as an
unruly charger, whip-corrected, snorting and pawing the earth under the
plane-tree in the garden!

even when there were sounds of sorrow among the rest, they were not
harsh nor cruel. even when golden hair, like her own, lay in a halo on a
pillow round the worn face of a little boy, and he said, with a radiant
smile, â€œdear papa and mamma, i am very sorry to leave you both, and to
leave my pretty sister; but i am called, and i must go!

cries of--â€œlive the bastille prisoner! help for the bastille prisonerâ€™s
kindred in la force! room for the bastille prisoner in front there! save
the prisoner evremonde at la force!â€ and a thousand answering shouts.

he closed the lattice again with a fluttering heart, closed the window
and the curtain, hastened to lucie, and told her that her father was
assisted by the people, and gone in search of her husband. he found
her child and miss pross with her; but, it never occurred to him to be
surprised by their appearance until a long time afterwards, when he sat
watching them in such quiet as the night knew.

lucie had, by that time, fallen into a stupor on the floor at his feet,
clinging to his hand. miss pross had laid the child down on his own
bed, and her head had gradually fallen on the pillow beside her pretty
charge. o the long, long night, with the moans of the poor wife! and o

quarter, near the banking-house. as there was no business objection to
this, and as he foresaw that even if it were all well with charles, and
he were to be released, he could not hope to leave the city, mr. lorry
went out in quest of such a lodging, and found a suitable one, high up
in a removed by-street where the closed blinds in all the other windows
of a high melancholy square of buildings marked deserted homes.

to this lodging he at once removed lucie and her child, and miss pross:
giving them what comfort he could, and much more than he had himself.
he left jerry with them, as a figure to fill a doorway that would bear
considerable knocking on the head, and returned to his own occupations.
a disturbed and doleful mind he brought to bear upon them, and slowly
and heavily the day lagged on with him.

it wore itself out, and wore him out with it, until the bank closed. he
was again alone in his room of the previous night, considering what to
do next, when he heard

reassuring words, as the stony manner of all the three impressed itself
upon him more and more, â€œi state the case, citizen defarge?â€

defarge looked gloomily at his wife, and gave no other answer than a
gruff sound of acquiescence.

â€œyou had better, lucie,â€ said mr. lorry, doing all he could to
propitiate, by tone and manner, â€œhave the dear child here, and our
good pross. our good pross, defarge, is an english lady, and knows no
french.â€

the lady in question, whose rooted conviction that she was more than a
match for any foreigner, was not to be shaken by distress and, danger,
appeared with folded arms, and observed in english to the vengeance,
whom her eyes first encountered, â€œwell, i am sure, boldface! i hope
_you_ are pretty well!â€ she also bestowed a british cough on madame
defarge; but, neither of the two took much heed of her.

in the universal fear and distrust that darkened the time, all the usual
harmless ways of life were changed. in the doctorâ€™s little household, as
in very many others, the articles of daily consumption that were wanted
were purchased every evening, in small quantities and at various small
shops. to avoid attracting notice, and to give as little occasion as
possible for talk and envy, was the general desire.

for some months past, miss pross and mr. cruncher had discharged the
office of purveyors; the former carrying the money; the latter, the
basket. every afternoon at about the time when the public lamps were
lighted, they fared forth on this duty, and made and brought home
such purchases as were needful. although miss pross, through her long
association with a french family, might have known as much of their
language as of her own, if she had had a mind, she had no mind in that
direction; consequently she knew no more of

made a bargain for it, by holding up, as a statement of its just price,
one finger less than the merchant held up, whatever his number might be.

jerry hoarsely professed himself at miss prossâ€™s service. he had worn
all his rust off long ago, but nothing would file his spiky head down.

â€œthereâ€™s all manner of things wanted,â€ said miss pross, â€œand we shall
have a precious time of it. we want wine, among the rest. nice toasts

â€œha!â€ said miss pross, â€œit doesnâ€™t need an interpreter to explain the
meaning of these creatures. they have but one, and itâ€™s midnight murder,
and mischief.â€

â€œhush, dear! pray, pray, be cautious!â€ cried lucie.

â€œyes, yes, yes, iâ€™ll be cautious,â€ said miss pross; â€œbut i may say

â€œfor gracious sake, donâ€™t talk about liberty; we have quite enough of

â€œwell, my sweet,â€ said miss pross, nodding her head emphatically, â€œthe
short and the long of it is, that i am a subject of his most gracious
majesty king george the third;â€ miss pross curtseyed at the name; â€œand
as such, my maxim is, confound their politics, frustrate their knavish
tricks, on him our hopes we fix, god save the king!â€

mr. cruncher, in an access of loyalty, growlingly repeated the words
after miss pross, like somebody at church.

â€œi am glad you have so much of the englishman in you, though i wish you
had never taken that cold in your voice,â€ said miss pross, approvingly.

prospect yet, of our getting out of this place?â€

â€œi fear not yet. it would be dangerous for charles yet.â€

â€œheigh-ho-hum!â€ said miss pross, cheerfully repressing a sigh as she
glanced at her darlingâ€™s golden hair in the light of the fire, â€œthen we
must have patience and wait: thatâ€™s all. we must hold up our heads and
fight low, as my brother solomon used to say. now, mr. cruncher!--donâ€™t

viii. a hand at cards


happily unconscious of the new calamity at home, miss pross threaded her
way along the narrow streets and crossed the river by the bridge of the
pont-neuf, reckoning in her mind the number of indispensable purchases
she had to make. mr. cruncher, with the basket, walked at her side. they
both looked to the right and to the left into most of the shops they
passed, had a wary eye for all gregarious assemblages of people, and
turned out of their road to avoid any very excited group of talkers. it
was a raw evening, and the misty river, blurred to th

lights and to the ear with harsh noises, showed where the barges were
stationed in which the smiths worked, making guns for the army of the
republic. woe to the man who played tricks with _that_ army, or got
undeserved promotion in it! better for him that his beard had never
grown, for the national razor shaved him close.

having purchased a few small articles of grocery, and a measure of oil
for the lamp, miss pross bethought herself of the wine they wanted.
after peeping into several wine-shops, she stopped at the sign of the
good republican brutus of antiquity, not far from the national palace,
once (and twice) the tuileries, where the aspect of things rather
took her fancy. it had a quieter look than any other place of the same
description they had passed, and, though red with patriotic caps, was
not so red as the rest. sounding mr. cruncher, and finding him of her
opinion, miss pross resorted to

like slumbering bears or dogs; the two outlandish customers approached
the counter, and showed what they wanted.

as their wine was measuring out, a man parted from another man in a
corner, and rose to depart. in going, he had to face miss pross. no
sooner did he face her, than miss pross uttered a scream, and clapped
her hands.

in a moment, the whole company were on their feet. that somebody was
assassinated by somebody vindicating a difference of opinion was the
likeliest occurrence. everybody looked to see somebody fall, but only
saw a man and a woman standing staring at each other; the man with all
the outward aspect of a frenchman and a thorough republican; the woman,
evidently english.

good republican brutus of antiquity, except that it was something very
voluble and loud, would have been as so much hebrew or chaldean to miss
pross and her protector, though they had been all ears. but, they had no
ears for anything in their surprise. for, it must be recorded, that
not only was miss pross lost in amazement and agitation, but,
mr. cruncher--though it seemed on his own separate and individual
account--was in a state of the greatest wonder.

â€œwhat is the matter?â€ said the man who had caused miss pross to scream;
speaking in a vexed, abrupt voice (though in a low tone), and in
english.

â€œoh, solomon, dear solomon!â€ cried miss pross, clapping her hands again.
â€œafter not setting eyes upon you or hearing of you for so long a time,
do i find you here!â€

â€œdonâ€™

man, in a furtive, frightened way.

â€œbrother, brother!â€ cried miss pross, bursting into tears. â€œhave i ever
been so hard with you that you ask me such a cruel question?â€

â€œthen hold your meddlesome tongue,â€ said solomon, â€œand come out, if you
want to speak to me. pay for your wine, and come out. whoâ€™s this man?â€

miss pross, shaking her loving and dejected head at her by no means
affectionate brother, said through her tears, â€œmr. cruncher.â€

â€œlet him come out too,â€ said solomon. â€œdoes he think me a ghost?â€

apparently, mr. cruncher did, to judge from his looks. he said not a
word, however, and miss pross, exploring the depths of her reticule
through her tears with great difficulty paid for her wine. as she did
so, solomon turned to the followers of the good republican brutus
of antiquity, and

offered a few words of explanation in the french
language, which caused them all to relapse into their former places and
pursuits.

â€œnow,â€ said solomon, stopping at the dark street corner, â€œwhat do you
want?â€

â€œhow dreadfully unkind in a brother nothing has ever turned my love away
from!â€ cried miss pross, â€œto give me such a greeting, and show me no
affection.â€

â€œthere. confound it! there,â€ said solomon, making a dab at miss prossâ€™s
lips with his own. â€œnow are you content?â€

miss pross only shook her head and wept in silence.

â€œif you expect me to be surprised,â€ said her brother solomon, â€œi am not
surprised; i knew you were here; i know of most people who are here. if
you really donâ€™t want to endanger my existence--which i half believe you
do--go your ways as soon as possible, and let me go mine. i am busy. i
am an official.â€

and tell me there is nothing angry or estranged between us, and i will

good miss pross! as if the estrangement between them had come of any

was more than he could do himself.) â€œjohn solomon, or solomon john? she
calls you solomon, and she must know, being your sister. and _i_ know

miss pross recalled soon afterwards, and to the end of her life
remembered, that as she pressed her hands on sydneyâ€™s arm and looked up
in his face, imploring him to do no hurt to solomon, there was a braced

picture of that younger elderly gentleman from tellsonâ€™s, who had looked
into the red coals at the royal george at dover, now a good many years
ago. he turned his head as they entered, and showed the surprise with
which he saw a stranger.

many hours before, to picture to himself on which of the rough stones of

the difficulty of taking miss pross in it had much engaged mr. lorryâ€™s

but it was of the highest importance that the time occupied in examining
it and its passengers, should be reduced to the utmost; since their
escape might depend on the saving of only a few seconds here and there.
finally, he had proposed, after anxious consideration, that miss pross
and jerry, who were at liberty to leave the city, should leave it at
three oâ€™clock in the lightest

unencumbered with luggage, they would soon overtake the coach, and,
passing it and preceding it on the road, would order its horses in
advance, and greatly facilitate its progress during the precious hours
of the night, when delay was the most to be dreaded.

seeing in this arrangement the hope of rendering real service in that
pressing emergency, miss pross hailed it with joy. she and jerry had
beheld the coach start, had known who it was that solomon brought, had
passed some ten minutes in tortures of suspense, and were now concluding
their arrangements to follow the coach, even as madame defarge,
taking her way through the streets, now drew nearer and nearer to the
else-deserted lodging in which they held their consultation.

â€œnow what do you think, mr. cruncher,â€ said miss pross, whose agitation
was so great that she could hardly sp

â€œwhat do you think of our not starting from this courtyard? another

â€œmy opinion, miss,â€ returned mr. cruncher, â€œis as youâ€™re right. likewise
wot iâ€™ll stand by you, right or wrong.â€

â€œi am so distracted with fear and hope for our precious creatures,â€ said
miss pross, wildly crying, â€œthat i am incapable of forming any plan. are
_you_ capable of forming any plan, my dear good mr. cruncher?â€

â€œrespectinâ€™ a future spear oâ€™ life, miss,â€ returned mr. cruncher, â€œi
hope so. respectinâ€™ any present use oâ€™ this here blessed old head oâ€™
mine, i think not. would you do me the favour, miss, to take notice oâ€™
two promises and wows wot it is my wishes fur to record in this here

â€œoh, for gracious sake!â€ cried miss pross, still

â€œfirst,â€ said mr. cruncher, who was all in a tremble, and who spoke with
an ashy and solemn visage, â€œthem poor things well out oâ€™ this, never no
more will i do it, never no more!â€

â€œi am quite sure, mr. cruncher,â€ returned miss pross, â€œthat you
never will do it again, whatever it is, and i beg you not to think it
necessary to mention more particularly what it is.â€

â€œno, miss,â€ returned jerry, â€œit shall not be named to you. second: them

mrs. cruncherâ€™s flopping, never no more!â€

striving to dry her eyes and compose herself, â€œi have no doubt it
is best that mrs

â€œi go so far as to say, miss, moreover,â€ proceeded mr. cruncher, with a
most alarming tendency to hold forth as from a pulpit--â€œand let my words
be took down and took to mrs. cruncher through yourself--that wot my
opinions respectinâ€™ flopping has undergone a change, and that wot i only
hope with all my heart as mrs. cruncher may be a flopping at the present
time.â€

â€œthere, there, there! i hope she is, my dear man,â€ cried the distracted
miss pross, â€œand i hope she finds it answering her expectations.â€

â€œforbid it,â€ proceeded mr. cruncher, with additional solemnity,
additional slowness, and additional tendency to hold forth and hold
out, â€œas anything wot i have ever said or done should be wisited on my
earnest wishes for them poor creeturs now! forbid it as we shouldnâ€™t all

conclusion after a protracted but vain endeavour to find a better one.

and still madame defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came
nearer and nearer.

â€œif we ever get back to our native land,â€ said miss pross, â€œyou may rely
upon my telling mrs. cruncher as much as i may be able to remember and
understand of what you have so impressively said; and at all events
you may be sure that i shall bear witness to your being thoroughly in
earnest at this dreadful time. now, pray let us think! my esteemed mr.
cruncher, let us think!â€

still, madame defarge, pursuing her way along the streets, came nearer
and nearer.

â€œif you were to go before,â€ said miss pross, â€œand stop the vehicle and

rses from coming here, and were to wait somewhere for me; wouldnâ€™t
that be best?â€

mr. cruncher thought it might be best.

â€œwhere could you wait for me?â€ asked miss pross.

mr. cruncher was so bewildered that he could think of no locality but
temple bar. alas! temple bar was hundreds of miles away, and madame
defarge was drawing very near indeed.

â€œby the cathedral door,â€ said miss pross. â€œwould it be much out of
the way, to take me in, near the great cathedral door between the two
towers?â€

â€œno, miss,â€ answered mr. cruncher.

â€œthen, like the best of men,â€ said miss pross, â€œgo to the posting-house
straight, and make that change.â€

â€œi am doubtful,â€ said mr. cruncher, hesitating and shaking his head,
â€œabout leaving of you, you see. we donâ€™t know what may happen.â€

â€œheaven knows we donâ€™t,â€ returned miss pross, â€œbut have no fear for me.

take me in at the cathedral, at three oâ€™clock, or as near it as you can,
and i am sure it will be better than our going from here. i feel certain
of it. there! bless you, mr. cruncher! think-not of me, but of the lives
that may depend on both of us!â€

this exordium, and miss prossâ€™s two hands in quite agonised entreaty
clasping his, decided mr. cruncher. with an encouraging nod or two, he
immediately went out to alter the arrangements, and left her by herself
to follow as she had proposed.

the having originated a precaution which was already in course of
execution, was a great relief to miss pross. the necessity of composing
her appearance so that it should attract no special notice in the
streets, was another relief. she looked at her watch, and it was twenty

minutes past two. she had no time to lose, but must get ready at once.

afraid, in her extreme perturbation, of the loneliness of the deserted
rooms, and of half-imagined faces peeping from behind every open door
in them, miss pross got a basin of cold water and began laving her eyes,
which were swollen and red. haunted by her feverish apprehensions, she
could not bear to have her sight obscured for a minute at a time by the
dripping water, but constantly paused and looked round to see that there
was no one watching her. in one of those pauses she recoiled and cried
out, for she saw a figure standing in the room.

the basin fell to the ground broken, and the water flowed to the feet of
madame defarge. by strange st

ern ways, and through much staining blood,
those feet had come to meet that water.

madame defarge looked coldly at her, and said, â€œthe wife of evremonde;
where is she?â€

it flashed upon miss prossâ€™s mind that the doors were all standing open,
and would suggest the flight. her first act was to shut them. there were
four in the room, and she shut them all. she then placed herself before
the door of the chamber which lucie had occupied.

madame defargeâ€™s dark eyes followed her through this rapid movement,
and rested on her when it was finished. miss pross had nothing beautiful
about her; years had not tamed the wildness, or softened the grimness,
of her appearance; but, she too

was a determined woman in her different
way, and she measured madame defarge with her eyes, every inch.

â€œyou might, from your appearance, be the wife of lucifer,â€ said miss
pross, in her breathing. â€œnevertheless, you shall not get the better of
me. i am an englishwoman.â€

madame defarge looked at her scornfully, but still with something of
miss prossâ€™s own perception that they two were at bay. she saw a tight,
hard, wiry woman before her, as mr. lorry had seen in the same figure a
woman with a strong hand, in the years gone by. she knew full well that
miss pross was the familyâ€™s devoted friend; miss pross knew full well
that madame defarge was the familyâ€™s malevolent enemy.

â€œon my way yonder,â€ said madame defarge, with a slight movement of
her hand towards the fatal spot, â€œwhere they reserve my chair and my
knitting for

wish to see her.â€

â€œi know that your intentions are evil,â€ said miss pross, â€œand you may
depend upon it, iâ€™ll hold my own against them.â€

each spoke in her own language; neither understood the otherâ€™s words;
both were very watchful, and intent to deduce from look and manner, what
the unintelligible words meant.

â€œit will do her no good to keep herself concealed from me at this
moment,â€ said madame defarge. â€œgood patriots will know what that means.
let me see her. go tell her that i wish to see her. do you hear?â€

madame defarge was not likely to follow these idiomatic remarks in
detail; but, she so far understood them as to perceive that she was set
at naught.

â€œwoman imbecile and pig-like!â€ said madame defarge, frowning. â€œi take no
answer from you. i demand to see her. either tell her that i demand
to see her, or stand out of the way of the door and let me go

 this, with an angry explanatory wave of her right arm.

â€œi little thought,â€ said miss pross, â€œthat i should ever want to
understand your nonsensical language; but i would give all i have,
except the clothes i wear, to know whether you suspect the truth, or any
part of it.â€

neither of them for a single moment released the otherâ€™s eyes. madame
defarge had not moved from the spot where she stood when miss pross
first became aware of her; but, she now advanced one step.

â€œi am a briton,â€ said miss pross, â€œi am desperate. i donâ€™t care an
english twopence for myself. i know that the longer i keep you here, the
greater hope there is for my ladybird. iâ€™ll not leave a handful of that
dark hair upon your head, if you lay a finger on me!â€

thus miss pross, with a shake of her head and a flash of her eyes
between every rapid sentence, and every rapid sentence a whole breath.

 the
irrepressible tears into her eyes. this was a courage that madame
defarge so little comprehended as to mistake for weakness. â€œha, ha!â€ she
laughed, â€œyou poor wretch! what are you worth! i address myself to that
doctor.â€ then she raised her voice and called out, â€œcitizen doctor! wife
of evremonde! child of evremonde! any person but this miserable fool,
answer the citizeness defarge!â€

perhaps the following silence, perhaps some latent disclosure in the
expression of miss prossâ€™s face, perhaps a sudden misgiving apart from
either suggestion, whispered to madame defarge that they were gone.
three of the doors she opened swiftly, and looked in.

â€œthose rooms are all in disorder, there has been hurried packing, there
are odds and ends upon the ground. there is no one in that room behind
you! let me look.â€

â€œnever!â€ said miss pross, who understood the request as perfectly as
madame defarge understood the answer.

â€œif they are not in that room, they

are gone, and can be pursued and
brought back,â€ said madame defarge to herself.

â€œas long as you donâ€™t know whether they are in that room or not, you are
uncertain what to do,â€ said miss pross to herself; â€œand you shall not
know that, if i can prevent your knowing it; and know that, or not know
that, you shall not leave here while i can hold you.â€

â€œi have been in the streets from the first, nothing has stopped me,
i will tear you to pieces, but i will have you from that door,â€ said
madame defarge.

â€œwe are alone at the top of a high house in a solitary courtyard, we are
not likely to be heard, and i pray for bodily strength to keep you here,
while every minute yo

madame defarge made at the door. miss pross, on the instinct of the
moment, seized her round the waist in both her arms, and held her tight.
it was in vain for madame defarge to struggle and to strike; miss pross,
with the vigorous tenacity of love, always so much stronger than hate,
clasped her tight, and even lifted her from the floor in the struggle
that they had. the two hands of madame defarge buffeted and tore her
face; but, miss pross, with her head down, held her round the waist, and
clung to her with more than the hold of a drowning woman.

soon, madame defargeâ€™s hands ceased to strike, and felt at her encircled
waist. â€œit is under my arm,â€ said miss pross, in smothered tones, â€œ

madame defargeâ€™s hands were at her bosom. miss pross looked up, saw
what it was, struck at it, struck out a flash and a crash, and stood
alone--blinded with smoke.

all this was in a second. as the smoke cleared, leaving an awful
stillness, it passed out on the air, like the soul of the furious woman
whose body lay lifeless on the ground.

in the first fright and horror of her situation, miss pross passed the
body as far from it as she could, and ran down the stairs to call for
fruitless help. happily, she bethought herself of the conse

escort appeared, took her in, and took her away.

â€œis there any noise in the streets?â€ she asked him.

â€œthe usual noises,â€ mr. cruncher replied; and looked surprised by the
question and by her aspect.

â€œi donâ€™t hear you,â€ said miss pross. â€œwhat do you say?â€

it was in vain for mr. cruncher to repeat what he said; miss pross could
not hear him. â€œso iâ€™ll nod my head,â€ thought mr. cruncher, amazed, â€œat
all events sheâ€™ll see that.â€ and she did.

â€œis there any noise in the streets now?â€ asked miss pross again,
presently.

again mr. cruncher nodded his head.

â€œi donâ€™t hear it.â€

â€œgone deaf in an hour?â€ said mr. cruncher, ruminating, with his mind
much disturbed; â€œwotâ€™s come to her?â€

â€œi feel,â€ said miss pross, â€œas if there had been a flash and a crash,
and that crash was the last thing i should ever hear in this life.â€

â€œblest if she ainâ€™t in a queer condition!â€ said mr. cruncher, more and
more disturbed. â€œwot can she have been a takinâ€™, to keep her courage up?
hark! thereâ€™s the roll of them dreadful carts! you can hear that, miss?â€

â€œi can hear,â€ said miss pross, seeing that he spoke to her, â€œnothing. o,
my good man, there was first a great crash, and then a great stillness,
and that stillness seems to be fixed and unchangeable, never to be
broken any more as long as my life lasts.â€

â€œif she donâ€™t hear the roll of those dreadful carts, now very nigh their
journeyâ€™s end,â€ said mr. cruncher, glancing over his shoulder, â€œitâ€™s my
opinion that indeed she never will hear anything else in this world.â€

and indeed she never did.
