[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is tom sawyer's villain. his
actions are motivated, from beginning to end, by unadulterated malevolence.
when [CHARACTER] explains his motivation for revenge against dr. robinson
and later against the widow douglas, we see that his personal history involves
others mistreating and excluding him. yet the disproportion between
the wrongs [CHARACTER] has suffered--at least as he enumerates them--and
the level of vengeance he hopes to exact is so extreme that we aren't
tempted to excuse his behavior. in contrast, muff potter's misdeeds
are inconsequential compared to the punishment he stands to receive.
one might also compare [CHARACTER] to sid: both are motivated by malice,
which they paper over with a convincing performance of innocence.

though his appearance changes when he disguises himself
as a deaf and mute spaniard, [CHARACTER] undergoes no real character development
over the course of the novel. he never seems to repent for his crimes
or change his spiteful outlook. his reappearances in different parts
of the novel help to provide a thread of continuity, as they bring
the murder-case plot, the treasure-hunt plot, and the adventures-in-the-cave
plots together into a single narrative. [CHARACTER]'s presence also
adds suspense to the novel, because we have very little sense of
whether tom and huck's constant fear that [CHARACTER] will hurt them
has any basis in reality.
