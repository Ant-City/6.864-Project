the [CHARACTER]  - 
      dressed in modest black and a thick widow's veil. the [CHARACTER]'s face is "wax- like," and her eyes always downcast. she bears the anguish of the characters' drama, serving as its horrified spectator. she is the consummate figure of grief. particularly agonizing to her is the aloofness of her estranged son, whom she will approach to no avail throughout the play.
