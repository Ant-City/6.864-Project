dom claude frollo had, however, abandoned neither science nor the
education of his young brother, those two occupations of his life. but
as time went on, some bitterness had been mingled with these things
which were so sweet. in the long run, says paul diacre, the best lard
turns rancid. little jehan frollo, surnamed (_du moulin_) “of the mill”
 because of the place where he had been reared, had not grown up in the
direction which claude would have liked to impose upon him. the big
brother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil. but
the little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener’s
hopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and
air, the little brother did not grow and did not multiply, but only
put forth fine bushy and luxurian

now, the auditor was deaf. a slight defect in an auditor. master florian
delivered judgment, none the less, without appeal and very suitably. it
is certainly quite sufficient for a judge to have the air of listening;
and the venerable auditor fulfilled this condition, the sole one in
justice, all the better because his attention could not be distracted by
any noise.

moreover, he had in the audience, a pitiless censor of his deeds and
gestures, in the person of our friend jehan frollo du moulin, that
little student of yesterday, that “stroller,” whom one was sure of
encountering all over paris, anywhere except before the rostrums of the
professors.

“stay,” he said in a low tone to his companion, robin poussepain, who
was grinning at his side, while he was making his comments on the scenes
which were being unfolded before his eyes, “yonder is jehanneton
du buisson. the beautiful daughter of the lazy dog at the
marché-neuf!--upon my soul, he is condemning her, the

ning of the sixteenth century. all was clear,
expeditious, explicit. one went straight to the point then, and at the
end of every path there was immediately visible, without thickets and
without turnings; the wheel, the gibbet, or the pillory. one at least
knew whither one was going.

the clerk presented the sentence to the provost, who affixed his seal to
it, and departed to pursue his round of the audience hall, in a frame
of mind which seemed destined to fill all the jails in paris that day.
jehan frollo and robin poussepain laughed in their sleeves. quasimodo
gazed on the whole with an indifferent and astonished air.

however, at the moment when master florian barbedienne was reading the
sentence in his turn, before signing it, the clerk felt himself moved
with pity for the poor wretch of a prisoner, and, in the hope of
obtaining some mitigation of the penalty, he approached as near the
auditor’s ear as possible, and said, pointing to quasimodo, “that man is
deaf.”

he hoped that this co

they placed him on his knees on the circular plank; he made no
resistance. they removed his shirt and doublet as far as his girdle; he
allowed them to have their way. they entangled him under a fresh system
of thongs and buckles; he allowed them to bind and buckle him. only from
time to time he snorted noisily, like a calf whose head is hanging and
bumping over the edge of a butcher’s cart.

“the dolt,” said jehan frollo of the mill, to his friend robin
poussepain (for the two students had followed the culprit, as was to
have been expected), “he understands no more than a cockchafer shut up
in a box!”

there was wild laughter among the crowd when they beheld quasimodo’s
hump, his camel’s breast, his callous and hairy shoulders laid bare.
during this gayety, a man in the livery of the city, short of stature
and robust of mien, mounted the platform and placed himself near the
victim. his name speedily cir

he began by depositing on an angle of the pillory a black hour-glass,
the upper lobe of which was filled with red sand, which it allowed
to glide into the lower receptacle; then he removed his parti-colored
surtout, and there became visible, suspended from his right hand, a
thin and tapering whip of long, white, shining, knotted, plaited thongs,
armed with metal nails. with his left hand, he negligently folded back
his shirt around his right arm, to the very armpit.

in the meantime, jehan frollo, elevating his curly blonde head above
the crowd (he had mounted upon the shoulders of robin poussepain for the
purpose), shouted: “come and look, gentle ladies and men! they are
going to peremptorily flagellate master quasimodo, the bellringer of
my brother, monsieur the archdeacon of josas, a knave of oriental
architecture, who has a back like a dome, and legs like twisted
columns!”

and the crowd burst into a laugh, especially the boys and young girls.

at length the torturer stamped his

deacon on one occasion. meanwhile, the forgotten
bells died away abruptly and all together, to the great disappointment
of the lovers of bell ringing, who were listening in good faith to the
peal from above the pont du change, and who went away dumbfounded, like
a dog who has been offered a bone and given a stone.




chapter iv. _ananke_.


it chanced that upon a fine morning in this same month of march, i think
it was on saturday the 29th, saint eustache’s day, our young friend the
student, jehan frollo du moulin, perceived, as he was dressing himself,
that his breeches, which contained his purse, gave out no metallic ring.
“poor purse,” he said, drawing it from his fob, “what! not the smallest
parisis! how cruelly the dice, beer-pots, and venus have depleted thee!
how empty, wrinkled, limp, thou art! thou resemblest the throat of a
fury! i ask you, messer cicero, and messer seneca, copies of whom, all
dog’s-eared, i behold scattered on the floor, what profits it me to
know, better tha

 of a circle eighty
feet in radius, crashed upon the pavement with its load of ruffians,
more rapidly than a drawbridge when its chains break. there arose an
immense imprecation, then all was still, and a few mutilated wretches
were seen, crawling over the heap of dead.

a sound of wrath and grief followed the first cries of triumph among
the besiegers. quasimodo, impassive, with both elbows propped on the
balustrade, looked on. he had the air of an old, bushy-headed king at
his window.

as for jehan frollo, he was in a critical position. he found himself in
the gallery with the formidable bellringer, alone, separated from his
companions by a vertical wall eighty feet high. while quasimodo was
dealing with the ladder, the scholar had run to the postern which he
believed to be open. it was not. the deaf man had closed it behind him
when he entered the gallery. jehan had then concealed himself behind
a stone king, not daring to breathe, and fixing upon the monstrous
hunchback a frightened gaze, like
