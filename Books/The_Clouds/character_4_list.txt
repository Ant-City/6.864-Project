Unjust Argument - 
      A personified school of thought. Unjust Argument is Just Argument's necessary foil. Like Socrates, Unjust Argument represents all that is wrong with sophistry and the "new education"--the specious moral content masked by slippery, well-wrought persuasion and rhetoric. Like Pheidippides, Unjust Argument is smug and disdainful of tradition. He has a facile mind, if not necessarily an upright set of values.
