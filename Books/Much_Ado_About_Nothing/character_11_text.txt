enter dogbery and his compartner with the watch.

  dog. are you good men and true?
  verg. yea, or else it were pitty but they should suffer
saluation body and soule

   dogb. nay, that were a punishment too good for
them, if they should haue any allegiance in them, being
chosen for the princes watch

   verges. well, giue them their charge, neighbour
dogbery

   dog. first, who thinke you the most desartlesse man
to be constable

   watch.1. hugh ote-cake sir, or george sea-coale, for
they can write and reade

   dogb. come hither neighbour sea-coale, god hath
blest you with a good name: to be a wel-fauoured man,
is the gift of fortune, but to write and reade, comes by
nature

nd reading, let that
appeare when there is no need of such vanity, you are
thought heere to be the most senslesse and fit man for the
constable of the watch: therefore beare you the lanthorne:
this is your charge: you shall comprehend all
vagrom men, you are to bid any man stand in the princes
name

   watch 2. how if a will not stand?
  dogb. why then take no note of him, but let him go,
and presently call the rest of the watch together, and
thanke god you are ridde of a knaue

   verges. if he will not stand when he is bidden, hee is
none of the princes subiects

   dogb. true, and they are to meddle with none but
the princes subiects: you shall also make no noise in the
streetes: for, for the watch to babble and talke, is most
tollerable, and not to be indured

   watch. we will rather sleepe than talke, wee know
what belongs to a watch

   watch. if wee know him to be a thiefe, shall wee not
lay hands on him

   dogb. truly by your office you may, but i think they
that touch pitch will be defil'd: the most peaceable way
for you, if you doe take a theefe, is, to let him shew himselfe
what he is, and steale out of your company

   ver. you haue bin alwaies cal'd a merciful ma[n] partner

   dog. truely i would not hang a dog by my will, much
more a man who hath anie honestie in him

   verges. if you heare a child crie in the night you must
call to the nurse, and bid her still it

   watch. how if the nurse be asleepe and will not
heare vs?
  dog. why then depart in peace, and let the childe
wake her with crying, for the ewe that will not heare
her lambe when it baes, will neuer answere a calfe when
he bleates

   verges. 'tis verie true

   dog. this is the end of the charge: you constable
are to present the princes owne person, if you meete the
prince in the night, y

   dog. fiue shillings to one on't with anie man that
knowes the statutes, he may staie him, marrie not without
the prince be willing, for indeed the watch ought to
offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a man against
his will
