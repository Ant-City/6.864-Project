ain surgeon came up from boston
and operated on him for three hours. billy was unconscious for two days after that, and
he dreamed millions of things, some of them true. the true things were time-travel.
 one of the true things was his first evening in the slaughterhouse. he and poor old
edgar derby were pushing an empty two-wheeled cart down a dirt lane between empty
pens for animals. they were going to a communal kitchen for supper for all. they were
guarded by a sixteen-year-old german named werner gluck. the axles of the cart were
greased with the fat of dead animals. so it goes.
 the sun had just gone down, and its afterglow was backlighting the city, which formed
low cliffs around the bucolic void to the idle stockyards. the city was blacked out
because bombers might come, so billy didn't get to see dresden do one of the most
cheerful things a city is capable of doing when the sun goes down, which is to wink its
lights on one by one.

 there those girls were with all their private parts bare, for anybody to see. and there in
the doorway were gluck and derby and pilgrim-the childish soldier and the poor old high
school teacher and the clown in his toga and silver shoes-staring. the girls screamed.
they covered themselves with their hands and turned their backs and so on, and made
themselves utterly beautiful.
 werner gluck, who had never seen a naked woman before, closed the door. bill had
never seen one, either. it was nothing new to derby.
 when the three fools found the communal kitchen, whose main job was to make lunch
for workers in the slaughterhouse, everybody had gone home but one woman who had
been waiting for them impatiently. she was a war widow. so it goes. she had her hat and
coat on. she wanted to go home, too, even though there wasn't anybody there. her white
gloves were laid out side by side on th
