 up by hand--reproachful-like.

“mr. and mrs. thomas moved away from bolingbroke to marysville, and i
lived with them until i was eight years old. i helped look after the
thomas children--there were four of them younger than me--and i can tell
you they took a lot of looking after. then mr. thomas was killed
falling under a train and his mother offered to take mrs. thomas and the
children, but she didn’t want me. mrs. thomas was at _her_ wits’ end, so
she said, what to do with me. then mrs. hammond from up the river came
down and said she’d take me, seeing i was handy with children, and
i went up the river to live with her in a little clearing among the
stumps. it was a very lonesome place. i’m sure i could never have
lived there if i hadn’t had an imagination. mr. hammond worked a little
sawmill up there, and mrs. hammond had eight children. she had twins
three times. i like babies in moderation, but twins three times in
succession is _too much_. i told mrs. hammond so firmly, when

pair came. i used to get so dreadfully tired carrying them about.

“i lived up river with mrs. hammond over two years, and then mr. hammond
died and mrs. hammond broke up housekeeping. she divided her children
among her relatives and went to the states. i had to go to the asylum
at hopeton, because nobody would take me. they didn’t want me at the
asylum, either; they said they were over-crowded as it was. but they had
to take me and i was there four months until mrs. spencer came.”

anne finished up with another sigh, of relief this time. evidently
she did not like talking about her experiences in a world that had not
wanted her.

“did you ever go

and most of ‘the seasons’ by james thompson. don’t you just love poetry
that gives you a crinkly feeling up and down your back? there is a piece
in the fifth reader--‘the downfall of poland’--that is just full of

fourth--but the big girls used to lend me theirs to read.”

“were those women--mrs. thomas and mrs. hammond--good to you?” asked
marilla, looking at anne out of the corner of her eye.

“o-o-o-h,” faltered anne. her sensitive little face suddenly flushed
scarlet and embarrassment sat on her brow. “oh, they _meant_ to be--i know
they meant to be just as good and kind as possible. and when people
mean to be good to you, you don’t mind very much when they’re not
quite--always. they had a good deal to worry them, you know. it’s  a very

katie was the comfort and consolation of my life. we used to pretend
that the bookcase was enchanted and that if i only knew the spell i
could open the door and step right into the room where katie maurice
lived, instead of into mrs. thomas’ shelves of preserves and china. and
then katie maurice would have taken me by the hand and led me out into a
wonderful place, all flowers and sunshine and fairies, and we would have
lived there happy for ever after. when i went to live with mrs. hammond
it just broke my heart to leave katie maurice. she felt it dreadfully,
too, i know she did, for she was crying when she kissed me good-bye
through the bookcase door. there was no bookcase at mrs. hammond’s. but
just up the river a little way from the house there was a long green
little valley, and the loveliest echo lived there. it echoed back every
word you said, even if you didn’t talk a bit loud. so i imagined that it
was a little girl called violetta and we were great friends and i love

if he’d said so. matthew and i are such kindred spirits i can read his
thoughts without words at all.”

“i don’t believe he’ll find the doctor at carmody,” sobbed diana. “i
know that dr. blair went to town and i guess dr. spencer would go too.
young mary joe never saw anybody with croup and mrs. lynde is away. oh,
anne!”

“don’t cry, di,” said anne cheerily. “i know exactly what to do for
croup. you forget that mrs. hammond had twins three times. when you look
after three pairs of twins you naturally get a lot of experience. they
all had croup regularly. just wait till i get the ipecac bottle--you
mayn’t have any at your house. come on now.”

the two little girls hastened out hand in hand and hurried through
lover’s lane and across the crusted field beyond, for the snow was too
deep to go by the shorter wood way. anne, although sincerely sorry
for minnie may, was far from being insensible to the romance of t

honestly anxious to do all she could, kept up a roaring fire and heated
more water than would have been needed for a hospital of croupy babies.

it was three o’clock when matthew came with a doctor, for he had been
obliged to go all the way to spencervale for one. but the pressing need
for assistance was past. minnie may was much better and was sleeping
soundly.

“i was awfully near giving up in despair,” explained anne. “she got
worse and worse until she was sicker than ever the hammond twins were,
even the last pair. i actually thought she was going to choke to death.
i gave her every drop of ipecac in that bottle and when the last dose
went down i said to myself--not to diana or young mary joe, because i
didn’t want to worry them any more than they were worried, but i had
to say it to myself just to relieve my feelings--‘this is the last
lingering hope and i fear, tis a vain one.’ but in about three minutes
she coughed up the phlegm and began to get better right away.

inter morning, heavy
eyed from loss of sleep, but still talking unweariedly to matthew as
they crossed the long white field and walked under the glittering fairy
arch of the lover’s lane maples.

“oh, matthew, isn’t it a wonderful morning? the world looks like
something god had just imagined for his own pleasure, doesn’t it? those
trees look as if i could blow them away with a breath--pouf! i’m so glad
i live in a world where there are white frosts, aren’t you? and i’m so
glad mrs. hammond had three pairs of twins after all. if she hadn’t i
mightn’t have known what to do for minnie may. i’m real sorry i was
ever cross with mrs. hammond for having twins. but, oh, matthew, i’m so
sleepy. i can’t go to school. i just know i couldn’t keep my eyes open
and i’d be so stupid. but i hate to stay home, for gil--some of
the others will get head of the class, and it’s so hard to get up
again--although of course the harder it is the more satisfaction you
have when you do get
