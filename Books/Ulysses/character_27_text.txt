—it struck me too, martin cunningham said.

mr bloom set his thigh down. glad i took that bath. feel my feet quite

mr dedalus sighed resignedly.

—after all, he said, it’s the most natural thing in the world.

—did tom kernan turn up? martin cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
his beard gently.

—yes, mr bloom answered. he’s behind with ned lambert and hynes.

—and corny kelleher himself? mr power asked.

out the two wreaths. he handed one to the boy.

ned lambert glanced back.

—has still, ned lambert said. he does some canvassing for ads.

john henry menton’s large eyes stared ahead.

the barrow turned into a side lane. a portly man, ambushed among the
grasses, raised his hat in homage. the gravediggers touched their caps.

—john o’connell, mr power said pleased. he never forgets a friend.

mr o’connell shook all their hands in silence. mr dedalus said:

they bent their silk hats in concert and hynes inclined his ear. the

in a discreet tone to their vacant smiles.

face, asked of it sourly:

ned lambert, seated on the table, read on:

newspaper. how’s that for high?

ned lambert, laughing, struck the newspaper on his knees, repeating:

—the pensive bosom and the overarsing leafage. o boys! o boys!

—and xenophon looked upon marathon, mr dedalus said, looking again on
the fireplace and to the window, and marathon looked on the sea.

accent on the whose.

ned lambert nodded.

he took off his silk hat and, blowing out impatiently his bushy
moustache, welshcombed his hair with raking fingers.

ned lambert tossed the newspaper aside, chuckling with delight. an

unshaven blackspectacled face.

towards mr bloom’s face, shadowed by a smile.
