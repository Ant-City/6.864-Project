â€œtell me your name, my boy,â€ he said.
â€œrandolph c. miller,â€ said the boy sharply. â€œand iâ€™ll tell you her name;â€ and he leveled his alpenstock at his sister.
â€œyou had better wait till you are asked!â€ said this young lady calmly.
â€œi should like very much to know your name,â€ said winterbourne.
â€œher name is daisy miller!â€ cried the child. â€œbut that isnâ€™t her real name; that isnâ€™t her name on her cards.â€
â€œitâ€™s a pity you havenâ€™t got one of my cards!â€ said miss miller.
â€œher real name is annie p. miller,â€ the boy went on.
â€œask him his name,â€ said his sister, indicating winterbourne.
but on this point randolph seemed perfectly indifferent; he continued to supply information with regard to his own family. â€œmy fatherâ€™s name is ezra b. miller,â€ he announced. â€œmy father ainâ€™t in eur

poor winterbourne was amused, perplexed, and decidedly charmed. he had never yet heard a young girl express herself in just

 this fashion; never, at least, save in cases where to say such things seemed a kind of demonstrative evidence of a certain laxity of deportment. and yet was he to accuse miss daisy miller of actual or potential inconduite, as they said at geneva? he felt that he had lived at geneva so long that he had lost a good deal; he had become dishabituated to the american tone. never, indeed, since he had grown old enough to appreciate things, had he encountered a young american girl of so pronounced a type as this. certainly she was very charming, but how deucedly sociable! was she simply a pretty girl from new york state? were they all like that, the pretty girls who had a good deal of

gentlemenâ€™s society? or was she also a designing, an audacious, an unscrupulous young person? winterbourne had lost his instinct in this matter, and his reason could not help him. miss daisy miller looked extremely innocent. some people had told him that, after all, american girls were exceedingly innocent; and others had told him that, after all, they were not. he was inclined to think miss daisy miller was a flirtâ€”a pretty american flirt. he had never, as yet, had any relations with young ladies of this category. he had known, here in europe, two or three womenâ€”persons older than miss daisy miller, and provided, for respectabilityâ€™s sake, with husbandsâ€”who were great coquettesâ€”dangerous, terrible women, with whom oneâ€™s relations were liable to take a serious turn. but this young girl was not a coquette in that sense; she was very unsophisticated; she was only a pretty american fli

rt. winterbourne was almost grateful for having found the formula that applied to miss daisy miller. he leaned back in his seat; he remarked to himself that she had the most charming nose he had ever seen; he wondered what were the regular conditions and limitations of oneâ€™s intercourse with a pretty american flirt. it presently became apparent that he was on the way to learn.
â€œhave you been to that old castle?â€ asked the young girl, pointing with her parasol to the far-gleaming walls of the chateau de chillon.
â€œyes, formerly, more than once,â€ said winterbourne. â€œyou too, i suppos

lacidly, â€œi wish you would stay with him!â€ she said.
winterbourne hesitated a moment. â€œi should much rather go to chillon with you.â€
â€œwith me?â€ asked the young girl with the same placidity.
she didnâ€™t rise, blushing, as a young girl at geneva would have done; and yet winterbourne, conscious that he had been very bold, thought it possible she was offended. â€œwith your mother,â€ he answered very respectfully.
but it seemed that both his audacity and his respect were lost upon miss daisy miller. â€œi guess my mother wonâ€™t go, after all,â€ she said. â€œshe donâ€™t like to ride round in the afternoon. but did you really mean what you said just nowâ€”that you would like to go up there?â€
â€œmost earnestly,â€ winterbourne declared.
â€œthen we may arrange it. if mother will stay with randolph, i guess eugenio will.â€
â€œeugenio?â€ the young man inquired.
â€œeugenioâ€™s our courier. he doesnâ€™t like to stay with randolph; heâ€™s the most fastidious man i ever saw. but heâ€™s a splen

did courier. i guess heâ€™ll stay at home with randolph if mother does, and then we can go to the castle.â€
winterbourne reflected for an instant as lucidly as possibleâ€”â€œweâ€ could only mean miss daisy miller and himself. this program seemed almost too agreeable for credence; he felt as if he ought to kiss the young ladyâ€™s hand. possibly he would have done so and quite spoiled the project, but at this moment another person, presumably eugenio, appeared. a tall, handsome man, with superb whiskers, wearing a velvet morning coat and a brilliant watch chain, approached miss miller, looking sharply at her companion. â€œoh, eugenio!â€ said miss miller with the friendliest accent.
eugenio had looked at

 about me,â€ he said, smiling and referring to his aunt.
â€œoh, well, weâ€™ll go some day,â€ said miss miller. and she gave him a smile and turned away. she put up her parasol and walked back to the inn beside eugenio. winterbourne stood looking after her; and as she moved away, drawing her muslin furbelows over the gravel, said to himself that she had the tournure of a princess.
he had, however, engaged to do more than proved feasible, in promising to present his aunt, mrs. costello, to miss daisy miller. as soon as the former lady had got better of her headache, he waited upon her in her apartment; and, after the proper inquiries in regard to her health, he asked her if she had observed in the hotel an american familyâ€”a mamma, a daughter, and a little boy.
â€œand a courier?â€ said mrs. costello. â€œoh yes, i have observed them. seen themâ€”heard themâ€”and kept out of their way.â€ mrs. costello was a widow with a fortune; a person of much distinction, who frequently intimated that, if she

him into many of the secrets of that social sway which, as she gave him to understand, she exerted in the american capital. she admitted that she was very exclusive; but, if he were acquainted with new york, he would see that one had to be. and her picture of the minutely hierarchical constitution of the society of that city, which she presented to him in many different lights, was, to winterbourneâ€™s imagination, almost oppressively striking.
he immediately perceived, from her tone, that miss daisy millerâ€™s place in the social scale was low. â€œi am afraid you donâ€™t approve of them,â€ he said.
â€œthey are very common,â€ mrs. costello declared. â€œthey are the sort of americans that one does oneâ€™s duty by notâ€”not accepting.â€
â€œah, you donâ€™t accept them?â€ said the young man.
â€œi canâ€™t, my dear frederick. i would if i could, but i canâ€™t.â€
â€œthe young girl is very pretty,â€ said winterbourne in a moment.
â€œof course sheâ€™s pretty. but she is very common.â€
â€œi see what

€œi must decline the honor of her acquaintance. i am an old woman, but i am not too old, thank heaven, to be shocked!â€
â€œbut donâ€™t they all do these thingsâ€”the young girls in america?â€ winterbourne inquired.
mrs. costello stared a moment. â€œi should like to see my granddaughters do them!â€ she declared grimly.
this seemed to throw some light upon the matter, for winterbourne remembered to have heard that his pretty cousins in new york were â€œtremendous flirts.â€ if, therefore, miss daisy miller exceeded the liberal margin allowed to these young ladies, it was probable that anything might be expected of her. winterbourne was impatient to see her again, and he was vexed with himself that, by instinct, he should not appreciate her justly.
though he was impatient to see her, he hardly knew what he should say to her about his auntâ€™s refusal to become acquainted with her; but he discovered, promptly enough, that with miss daisy miller there was no great need of walking on tiptoe. he found

â€œhave you been all alone?â€ he asked.
â€œi have been walking round with mother. but mother gets tired walking round,â€ she answered.
â€œhas she gone to bed?â€
â€œno; she doesnâ€™t like to go to bed,â€ said the young girl. â€œshe doesnâ€™t sleepâ€”not three hours. she says she doesnâ€™t know how she lives. sheâ€™s dreadfully nervous. i guess she sleeps more than she thinks. sheâ€™s gone somewhere afte

winterbourne was embarrassed. â€œshe would be most happy,â€ he said; â€œbut i am afraid those headaches will interfere.â€
the young girl looked at him through the dusk. â€œbut i suppose she doesnâ€™t have a headache every day,â€ she said sympathetically.
winterbourne was silent a moment. â€œshe tells me she does,â€ he answered at last, not knowing what to say.
miss daisy miller stopped and stood looking at him. her prettiness was still visible in the darkness; she was opening and closing her enormous fan. â€œshe doesnâ€™t want to know me!â€ she said suddenly. â€œwhy donâ€™t you say so? you neednâ€™t be afraid. iâ€™m not afraid!â€ and she gave a little laugh.
winterbourne fancied there was a tremor in her voice; he was touched, shocked, mortified by it. â€œmy dear young lady,â€ he protested, â€œshe knows no one. itâ€™s her wretched health.â€
the young girl walked o

n a few steps, laughing still. â€œyou neednâ€™t be afraid,â€ she repeated. â€œwhy should she want to know me?â€ then she paused again; she was close to the parapet of the garden, and in front of her was the starlit lake. there was a vague sheen upon its surface, and in the distance were dimly seen mountain forms. daisy miller looked out upon the mysterious prospect and then she gave another little laugh. â€œgracious! she is exclusive!â€ she said. winterbourne wondered whether she was seriously wounded, and for a moment almost wished that her sense of injury might be such as to make it becoming in him to attempt to reassure and comfort her. he had a pleasant sense that she would be very approachable for consolatory purposes. he felt then, for the instant, quite ready to sacrifice his aunt, conversationally; to admit

mmit himself to this perilous mixture of gallantry and impiety, the young lady, resuming her walk, gave an exclamation in quite another tone. â€œwell, hereâ€™s mother! i guess she hasnâ€™t got randolph to go to bed.â€ the figure of a lady appeared at a distance, very indistinct in the darkness, and advancing with a slow and wavering movement. suddenly it seemed to pause.
â€œare you sure it is your mother? can you distinguish her in this thick dusk?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œwell!â€ cried miss daisy miller with a laugh; â€œi guess i know my own mother. and when she has got on my shawl, too! she is always wearing my things.â€
the lady in question, ceasing to advance, hovered vaguely about the spot at which she had checked her steps.
â€œi am afraid your mother doesnâ€™t see you,â€ said winterbourne. â€œor perhaps,â€ he added, thinking, with miss miller, the joke permissibleâ€”â€œperhaps she feels guilty about your shawl.â€
â€œoh, itâ€™s a fearful old thing!â€ the young girl replied serenely. â

â€œah, then,â€ said winterbourne, â€œi had better leave you.â€
â€œoh, no; come on!â€ urged miss daisy miller.
â€œiâ€™m afraid your mother doesnâ€™t approve of my walking with you.â€
miss miller gave him a serious glance. â€œit isnâ€™t for me; itâ€™s for youâ€”that is, itâ€™s for her. well, i donâ€™t know who itâ€™s for! but mother doesnâ€™t like any of my gentlemen friends. sheâ€™s right down timid. she always makes a fuss if i introduce a gentleman. but i do introduce themâ€”almost always. if i didnâ€™t introduce my gentlemen friends to mother,â€ the young girl added in her little soft, flat monoto

â€œto introduce me,â€ said winterbourne, â€œyou must know my name.â€ and he proceeded to pronounce it.
â€œoh, dear, i canâ€™t say all that!â€ said his companion with a laugh. but by this time they had come up to mrs. miller, who, as they drew near, walked to the parapet of the garden and leaned upon it, looking intently at the lake and turning her back to them. â€œmother!â€ said the young girl in a tone of decision. upon this the elder lady turned round. â€œmr. winterbourne,â€ said miss daisy miller, introducing the young man very frankly and prettily. â€œcommon,â€ she was, as mrs. costello had pronounced her; yet it was a wonder to winterbourne that, with her commonness, she had a singularly delicate grace.
her mother was a small, spare, light person, with a wandering eye, a very exiguous nose, and a large forehead, decorated with a certain amount of thin, much frizzled hair. like her daughter, mrs. miller was dressed with extreme elegance; she had enormous diamonds in her ears. so far a

â€œi was telling mr. winterbourne,â€ the young girl went on; and to the young manâ€™s ear her tone might have indicated that she had been uttering his name all her life.
â€œoh, yes!â€ said winterbourne; â€œi have the pleasure of knowing your son.â€
randolphâ€™s mamma was silent; she turned her attention to the lake. but at last she spoke. â€œwell, i donâ€™t see how he lives!â€
â€œanyhow, it isnâ€™t so bad as it was at dover,â€ said daisy miller.
â€œand what occurred at dover?â€ winterbourne asked.
â€œhe wouldnâ€™t go to bed at all. i guess he sat up all night in the public parlor. he wasnâ€™t in bed at twelve oâ€™clock: i know that.â€
â€œit was half-past twelve,â€ declared mrs. miller with mild emphasis.
â€œdoes he sleep much during the day?â€ winterbourne demanded.
â€œi guess he doesnâ€™t sleep much,â€ daisy rejoined.
â€œi wish he would!â€ said her mother. â€œit seems as if he couldnâ€™t.â€
â€œi think heâ€™s real tiresome,â€

daisy pursued.
then, for some moments, there was silence. â€œwell, daisy miller,â€ said the elder lady, presently, â€œi shouldnâ€™t think youâ€™d want to talk against your own brother!â€
â€œwell, he is tiresome, mother,â€ said daisy, quite without the asperity of a retort.
â€œheâ€™s only nine,â€ urged mrs. miller.
â€œwell, he wouldnâ€™t go to that castle,â€ said the young girl. â€œiâ€™m going there with mr. winterbourne.â€
to this announcement, very placidly made, daisyâ€™s mamma offered no response. winterbourne took for granted that she deeply disapproved of the pr

t she had a passion for steamboats. there was always such a lovely breeze upon the water, and you saw such lots of people. the sail was not long, but winterbourneâ€™s companion found time to say a great many things. to the young man himself their little excursion was so much of an escapadeâ€”an adventureâ€”that, even allowing for her habitual sense of freedom, he had some expectation of seeing her regard it in the same way. but it must be confessed that, in this particular, he was disappointed. daisy miller was extremely animated, she was in charming spirits; but she was apparently not at all excited; she was not fluttered; she avoided neither his eyes nor those of anyone else; she blushed neither when she looked at him nor when she felt that people were looking at her. people continued to look at her a great deal, and winterbourne took much satisfaction in his pretty companionâ€™s distinguished air. he had been a little afraid that she would talk loud, laugh overmuch, and even, perhaps, desire to

 the hotel alone.â€ and for the next ten minutes she did nothing but call him horrid. poor winterbourne was fairly bewildered; no young lady had as yet done him the honor to be so agitated by the announcement of his movements. his companion, after this, ceased to pay any attention to the curiosities of chillon or the beauties of the lake; she opened fire upon the mysterious charmer in geneva whom she appeared to have instantly taken it for granted that he was hurrying back to see. how did miss daisy miller know that there was a charmer in geneva? winterbourne, who denied the existence of such a person, was quite unable to discover, and he was divided between amazement at the rapidity of her induction and amusement at the frankness of her persiflage. she seemed to him, in all this, an extraordinary mixture of innocence and crudity. â€œdoes she never allow you more than three days at a time?â€ asked daisy ironically. â€œdoesnâ€™t she give you a vacation in summer? thereâ€™s no one so hard worked b

â€œi donâ€™t want you to come for your aunt,â€ said daisy; â€œi want you to come for me.â€ and this was the only allusion that the young man was ever to hear her make to his invidious kinswoman. he declared that, at any rate, he would certainly come. after this daisy stopped teasing. winterbourne took a carriage, and they drove back to vevey in the dusk; the young girl was very quiet.
in the evening winterbourne mentioned to mrs. costello that he had spent the afternoon at chillon with miss daisy miller.
â€œthe americansâ€”of the courier?â€ asked this lady.
â€œah, happily,â€ said winterbourne, â€œthe courier stayed at home.â€
â€œshe went with you all alone?â€
â€œall alone.â€
mrs. costello sniffed a little at her smelling bottle. â€œand that,â€ she exclaimed, â€œis the young person whom you wanted me to know!â€

winterbourne, who had returned to geneva the day after his excursion to chillon, went to rome toward the end of january. his aunt had been established there for sever

â€œand where is the mother?â€
â€œi havenâ€™t the least idea. they are very dreadful people.â€
winterbourne meditated a moment. â€œthey are very ignorantâ€”very innocent only. depend upon it they are not bad.â€
â€œthey are hopelessly vulgar,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œwhether or no being hopelessly vulgar is being â€˜badâ€™ is a question for the metaphysicians. they are bad enough to dislike, at any rate; and for this short life that is quite enough.â€
the news that daisy miller was surrounded by half a dozen wonderful mustaches checked winterbourneâ€™s impulse to go straightway to see her. he had, perhaps, not definitely flattered himself that he had made an ineffaceable impression upon her heart, but he was annoyed at hearing of a state of affairs so little in harmony with an image that had lately flitted in and out of his own meditations; the image of a very pretty girl looking out of an old roman window and asking herself urgently when mr. winterbourne would arrive

 head, and glancing at him from head to foot, â€œthat, to save my reputation, i ought to get into the carriage?â€
winterbourne colored; for an instant he hesitated greatly. it seemed so strange to hear her speak that way of her â€œreputation.â€ but he himself, in fact, must speak in accordance with gallantry. the finest gallantry, here, was simply to tell her the truth; and the truth, for winterbourne, as the few indications i have been able to give have made him known to the reader, was that daisy miller should take mrs. walkerâ€™s advice. he looked at her exquisite prettiness, and then he said, very gently, â€œi think you should get into the carriage.â€
daisy gave a violent laugh. â€œi never heard anything so stiff! if this is improper, mrs. walker,â€ she pursued, â€œthen i am all improper, and you must give me up. goodbye; i hope youâ€™ll have a lovely ride!â€ and, with mr. giovanelli, who made a triumphantly obsequious salute, she turned away.
mrs. walker sat looking after her, and there

the misfortune not to find them. mrs. walkerâ€™s party took place on the evening of the third day, and, in spite of the frigidity of his last interview with the hostess, winterbourne was among the guests. mrs. walker was one of those american ladies who, while residing abroad, make a point, in their own phrase, of studying european society, and she had on this occasion collected several specimens of her diversely born fellow mortals to serve, as it were, as textbooks. when winterbourne arrived, daisy miller was not there, but in a few moments he saw her mother come in alone, very shyly and ruefully. mrs. millerâ€™s hair above her exposed-looking temples was more frizzled than ever. as she approached mrs. walker, winterbourne also drew near.
â€œyou see, iâ€™ve come all alone,â€ said poor mrs. miller. â€œiâ€™m so frightened; i donâ€™t know what to do. itâ€™s the first time iâ€™ve ever been to a party alone, especially in this country. i wanted to bring randolph or eugenio, or someone, but daisy jus

ence and her apparently inexhaustible good humor. he could hardly have said why, but she seemed to him a girl who would never be jealous. at the risk of exciting a somewhat derisive smile on the readerâ€™s part, i may affirm that with regard to the women who had hitherto interested him, it very often seemed to winterbourne among the possibilities that, given certain contingencies, he should be afraidâ€”literally afraidâ€”of these ladies; he had a pleasant sense that he should never be afraid of daisy miller. it must be added that this sentiment was not altogether flattering to daisy; it was part of his conviction, or rather of his apprehension, that she would prove a very light young person.
but she was evidently very much interested in giovanelli. she looked at him whenever he spoke; she was perpetually telling him to do this and to do that; she was constantly â€œchaffingâ€ and abusing him. she appeared completely to have forgotten that winterbourne had said anything to displease her at mrs. wal

 struck him as so unprecedented in the annals of parental vigilance that he gave up as utterly irrelevant the attempt to place her upon her guard.
after this daisy was never at home, and winterbourne ceased to meet her at the houses of their common acquaintances, because, as he perceived, these shrewd people had quite made up their minds that she was going too far. they ceased to invite her; and they intimated that they desired to express to observant europeans the great truth that, though miss daisy miller was a young american lady, her behavior was not representativeâ€”was regarded by her compatriots as abnormal. winterbourne wondered how she felt about all the cold shoulders that were turned toward her, and sometimes it annoyed him to suspect that she did not feel at all. he said to himself that she was too light and childish, too uncultivated and unreasoning, too provincial, to have reflected upon her ostracism, or even to have perceived it. then at other moments he believed that she carried a

vered with shadow; it was only as he drew near it that he made it out distinctly. then he saw that two persons were stationed upon the low steps which formed its base. one of these was a woman, seated; her companion was standing in front of her.
presently the sound of the womanâ€™s voice came to him distinctly in the warm night air. â€œwell, he looks at us as one of the old lions or tigers may have looked at the christian martyrs!â€ these were the words he heard, in the familiar accent of miss daisy miller.
â€œlet us hope he is not very hungry,â€ responded the ingenious giovanelli. â€œhe will have to take me first; you will serve for dessert!â€
winterbourne stopped, with a sort of horror, and, it must be added, with a sort of relief. it was as if a sudden illumination had been flashed upon the ambiguity of daisyâ€™s behavior, and the riddle had become easy to read. she was a young lady whom a gentleman need no longer be at pains to respect. he stood there, looking at herâ€”looking at her compan

ion and not reflecting that though he saw them vaguely, he himself must have been more brightly visible. he felt angry with himself that he had bothered so much about the right way of regarding miss daisy miller. then, as he was going to advance again, he checked himself, not from the fear that he was doing her injustice, but from a sense of the danger of appearing unbecomingly exhilarated by this sudden revulsion from cautious criticism. he turned away toward the entrance of the place, but, as he did so, he heard daisy speak again.
â€œwhy, it was mr. winterbourne! he saw me, and he cuts me!â€

â€œshe would never have married you?â€
â€œfor a moment i hoped so. but no. i am sure.â€
winterbourne listened to him: he stood staring at the raw protuberance among the april daisies. when he turned away again, mr. giovanelli, with his light, slow step, had retired.
winterbourne almost immediately left rome; but the following summer he again met his aunt, mrs. costello at vevey. mrs. costello was fond of vevey. in the interval winterbourne had often thought of daisy miller and her mystifying manners. one day he spoke of her to his auntâ€”said it was on his conscience that he had done her injustice.
â€œi am sure i donâ€™t know,â€ said mrs. costello. â€œhow did your injustice affect her?â€
â€œshe sent me a message before her death which i didnâ€™t understand at the time; but i have understood it since. she would have appreciated oneâ€™s esteem.â€
â€œis that a modest way,â€ asked mrs. costello, â€œof saying that she would have reciprocated oneâ€™s affection?â€
