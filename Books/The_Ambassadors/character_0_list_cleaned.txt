his life in woollett has entrenched him in boring routine. as he
travels, strether comes to appreciate the freedom and openness he
finds in europe, and he begins to feel as if his new, full european
life makes up for many years of personal stagnation. strether takes
to warning everyone he meets that they may turn out like him--old
and inexperienced--if they do not live life to the fullest while
they are young. strether is predisposed favorably toward most people:
he finds a close friend in maria gostrey, a type of protege in little
bilham, a replacement son in chad, and a feminine ideal in madame
marie de vionnet. at the end of the novel, strether chooses to return
to woollett, but his outlook on life is forever changed by his late-in-life
experience in europe.
