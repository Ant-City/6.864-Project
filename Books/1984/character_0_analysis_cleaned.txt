[CHARACTER]
orwell's primary goal in 1984 is
to demonstrate the terrifying possibilities of totalitarianism.
the reader experiences the nightmarish world that orwell envisions
through the eyes of the protagonist, winston. his personal tendency
to resist the stifling of his individuality, and his intellectual
ability to reason about his resistance, enables the reader to observe
and understand the harsh oppression that the party, big brother,
and the thought police institute. whereas julia is untroubled and
somewhat selfish, interested in rebelling only for the pleasures
to be gained, winston is extremely pensive and curious, desperate
to understand how and why the party exercises such absolute power
in oceania. winston's long reflections give orwell a chance to explore
the novel's important themes, including language as mind control,
psychological and physical intimidation and manipulation, and the
importance of knowledge of the past. 

apart from his thoughtful nature, winston's main attributes
are his rebelliousness and his fatalism. winston hates the party
passionately and wants to test the limits of its power; he commits
innumerable crimes throughout the novel, ranging from writing "down with
big brother" in his diary, to having an illegal love
affair with julia, to getting himself secretly indoctrinated into
the anti-party brotherhood. the effort winston puts into his attempt
to achieve freedom and independence ultimately underscores the party's
devastating power. by the end of the novel, winston's rebellion
is revealed as playing into o'brien's campaign of physical and psychological
torture, transforming winston into a loyal subject of big brother.
one reason for winston's rebellion, and eventual downfall,
is his sense of fatalism--his intense (though entirely justified)
paranoia about the party and his overriding belief that the party
will eventually catch and punish him. as soon as he writes "down
with big brother" in his diary, winston is positive
that the thought police will quickly capture him for committing
a thoughtcrime. thinking that he is helpless to evade his doom,
winston allows himself to take unnecessary risks, such as trusting
o'brien and renting the room above mr. charrington's shop. deep
down, he knows that these risks will increase his chances of being
caught by the party; he even admits this to o'brien while in prison.
but because he believes that he will be caught no matter what he
does, he convinces himself that he must continue to rebel. winston
lives in a world in which legitimate optimism is an impossibility;
lacking any real hope, he gives himself false hope, fully aware
that he is doing so.
