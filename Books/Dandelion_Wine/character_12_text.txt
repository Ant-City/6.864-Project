the bleak mansions across the town ravine opened baleful dragon eyes. soon, in the

morning avenues below, two old women would glide their electric green machine, waving 
at all the dogs. "mr. tridden, run to the carbarn!" soon, scattering hot blue sparks above 
it, the town trolley would sail the rivering brick streets. 

"ready john huff, charlie woodman?" whispered douglas to the street of children. 
"ready!" to baseballs sponged deep in wet lawns, to rope swings hung empty in trees. 

"mom, dad, tom, wake up." 

clock alarms tinkled faintly. the courthouse clock boomed. birds leaped from trees 
like a net thrown by his hand, singing. douglas, conducting an orchestra, pointed to the 
eastern sky. 

the sun began to rise.

m country, moved inward with the thrust of seasons. each night the 
wilderness, the meadows, the far country flowed down-creek through ravine and welled 
up in town with a smell of grass and water, and the town was disinhabited and dead and 
gone back to earth. and each morning a little more of the ravine edged up into town, 
threatening to swamp garages like leaking rowboats, devour ancient cars which had been 
left to the flaking mercies of rain and therefore rust. 

"hey! hey!" john huff and charlie woodman ran through the mystery of ravine and 
town and time. "hey!" 

douglas moved slowly down the path. the ravine was indeed the place where you 
came to look at the two things of life, the ways of man and the ways of the natural 
world. the town was, after all, only a large ship filled with constantly moving survivors, 
bailing out the grass, chipping away the rust. now and again a lifeboat, a shanty, kin to 
the mother ship, lost out to the quiet storm of seasons, sank down in silent waves of

moving toward the porch, he could feel his wife's smile there in the dark. 

five minutes passed in comfortable eating silence, then, holding a spoonful of moon- 
colored ice cream up as if it were the whole secret of the universe to be tasted carefully 
he said, "lena? what would you think if i tried to invent a happiness machine?"

"something's wrong?" she asked quickly. 



grandfather walked douglas and tom home. halfway there, charlie woodman and 
john huff and some other boys rushed by like a swarm of meteors, their gravity so huge 
they pulled douglas away from grandfather and tom and swept him off toward the 
ravine. 

"don't get lost, son!" 

"i won't ... i won't . . ." 

the boys plunged into darkness. 

tom and grandfather walked the rest of the way in silence, except when they turned 
in at home and tom said, "boy, a happiness machine— hot diggety!" 

"don't hold your breath," said grandpa.

's ear. douglas wrote it. 

they both looked at it. 

"i'll be darned!" said douglas. "i never thought of that. that's brilliant! it's true. old 
people never were children!" "and it's kind of sad," said tom, sitting still. "there's 
nothing we can do to help them." 



seems like the town is full of machines . . . ' said douglas, running. "mr. auffmann 
and his happiness machine, miss fern and miss roberta and their green machine. now, 
charlie, what you handing me?" 

"a time machine!" panted charlie woodman, pacing him. "mother's, scout's, injun's 
honor!" 

"travels in the past and future?" john huff asked, easily circling them. 
"only in the past, but you can't have everything. here we are." 
charlie woodman pulled up at a hedge. 

douglas peered in at the old house. "heck, that's colonel freeleigh's place. can't be

building to refresh them as they read the sign they knew by heart, the sign which 
showed them what they'd come searching for: 

summer's ice house. 

summer's ice house on a summer day! they said the words, laughing, and moved to 
peer into that tremendous cavern where in fifty, one-hundred, and two-hundred-pound 
chunks, the glaciers, the icebergs, the fallen but not forgotten snows of january slept in 
ammoniac steams and crystal drippings. 

"feel that," sighed charlie woodman. "what more could you ask?" 

for the winter breath was exhaled again and again about them as they stood in the 
glary day, smelling the wet wood platform with the perpetual mist shimmering in 
rainbows down from the ice machinery above. 

they chewed icicles that froze their fingers so they had to grip the ice in handkerchiefs 
and suck the linen. 

"all that steam, all that fog," whispered tom. "the snow queen. remember that 
story? nobody believes in that stuff, snow queens, now. so don't be

her voice sank to a soft flutter. 
douglas was crying. 

she roused herself again. "now, why are you doing that?" 
"because," he said, "you won't be here tomorrow." 

she turned a small hand mirror from herself to the boy. he looked at her face and 
himself in the mirror and then at her face again as she said, "tomorrow morning i'll get 
up at seven and wash behind my ears; i'll run to church with charlie woodman; i'll picnic 
at electric park; i'll swim, run barefoot, fall out of trees, chew spearmint gum . . . 
douglas, douglas, for shame! you cut your fingernails, don't you?" 

"yes'm."

cells dead and new ones added to your fingers and your heart. you don't mind that, do

ndanna handkerchief and handed it to tom. tom wiped 
his nose and eyes with the handkerchief. 

"it's been a tough summer," tom said. "lots of things have happened to doug." 
"tell me about them," said the junkman. 

"well," said tom, gasping for breath, not quite done crying yet, "he lost his best aggie 
for one, a real beaut. and on top of that somebody stole his catcher's mitt, it cost a 
dollar ninety-five. then there was the bad trade he made of his fossil stones and shell 
collection with charlie woodman for a tarzan clay statue you got by saving up macaroni 
box tops. dropped the tarzan statue on the sidewalk second day he had it." 

"that's a shame," said the junkman and really saw all the pieces on the cement. 

"then he didn't get the book of magic tricks he wanted for his birthday, got a pair of 
pants and a shirt instead. that's enough to ruin the summer right there." 

"parents sometimes forget how it is," said mr. jonas.
