[CHARACTER] - 
                the
supposed translator of benengeli's historical novel, who interjects
his opinions into the novel at key times. [CHARACTER] intentionally
creates the impression that he did not invent the character of don
quixote. like benengeli, [CHARACTER] is not physically present but
is a character nonetheless. in his prologues, dedications, and invention
of benengeli, [CHARACTER] enhances the self-referential nature of
the novel and forces us to think about literature's purpose and
limitations.
