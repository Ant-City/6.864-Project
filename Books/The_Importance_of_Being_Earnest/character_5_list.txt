Miss Prism - 
                Cecily's
governess. Miss Prism is an endless source of pedantic bromides
and cliches. She highly approves of Jack's presumed respectability
and harshly criticizes his "unfortunate" brother. Puritan though
she is, Miss Prism's severe pronouncements have a way of going so far
over the top that they inspire laughter. Despite her rigidity, Miss
Prism seems to have a softer side. She speaks of having once written
a novel whose manuscript was "lost" or "abandoned." Also, she entertains
romantic feelings for Dr. Chasuble.
