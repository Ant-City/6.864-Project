[CHARACTER] - 
      a number of critics have read wilde's [CHARACTER] as an allegory for the work of art as such. born of painting, literature, and drama, she would incarnate the beauty of artifice, ornament, and luxury. importantly, however, this seductive spectacle is also a harbinger of death. [CHARACTER] first appears disgusted by the court, mortified by its crude, painted guests and the incestuous gaze of her stepfather, herod. soon thereafter she is seduced by the imprisoned prophet jokanaan's voice and has him drawn from his tomb, transgressing the order of the tetrarch.
