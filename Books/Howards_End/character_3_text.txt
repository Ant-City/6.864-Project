 a hint that all is not for the best in the best
of all possible worlds, and that beneath these
superstructures of wealth and art there wanders an ill-fed
boy, who has recovered his umbrella indeed, but who has left
no address behind him, and no name.


chapter 6

we are not concerned with the very poor.  they are
unthinkable, and only to be approached by the statistician
or the poet.  this story deals with gentlefolk, or with
those who are obliged to pretend that they are gentlefolk.

the boy, leonard bast, stood at the extreme verge of
gentility.  he was not in the abyss, but he could see it,
and at times people whom he knew had dropped in, and counted
no more.  he knew that he was poor, and would admit it: he
would have died sooner than confess any inferiority to the
rich.  this may be splendid of him.  but he was inferior to
most rich people, there is not the least doubt of it.  he
was not as courteous as the average rich man, nor as
intelligent, nor as healthy, nor as lovable.  his mind and

"no, after houses," said margaret, edging past him into
the box.  "i'm hungry, not tired; i want to eat heaps."

"that's good.  what'll you have?"

"fish pie," said she, with a glance at the menu.

"fish pie!  fancy coming for fish pie to simpson's.
it's not a bit the thing to go for here. "

"go for something for me, then," said margaret, pulling
off her gloves.  her spirits were rising, and his reference
to leonard bast had warmed her curiously.

"saddle of mutton," said he after profound reflection:
"and cider to drink.  that's the type of thing.  i like this
place, for a joke, once in a way.  it is so thoroughly old
english.  don't you agree?"

"yes," said margaret, who didn't.  the order was given,
the joint rolled up, and the carver, under mr. wilcox's
direction, cut the meat where it was succulent, and piled
their plates high.  mr. cahill insisted on sirloin, but
admitted that he had made a mistake later

ominously quiet since the affair was settled.  "here we all
are!" she cried, and took him by one hand, retaining her
sister's in the other.

"here we are.  good-morning, helen."

helen replied, "good-morning, mr. wilcox."

"henry, she has had such a nice letter from the queer,
cross boy--do you remember him?  he had a sad moustache, but
the back of his head was young."

"i have had a letter too.  not a nice one--i want to
talk it over with you:" for leonard bast was nothing to him
now that she had given him her word; the triangle of sex was
broken for ever.

"thanks to your hint, he's clearing out of the porphyrion."

"not a bad business that porphyrion," he said absently,
as he took his own letter out of his pocket.

"not a bad--" she exclaimed, dropping his hand.
"surely, on chelsea embankment--"

luggage and the motor-cars, and the hurrying men who
know so much and connect so little.  she recaptured the
sense of space, which is the basis of all earthly beauty,
and, starting from howards end, she attempted to realize
england.  she failed--visions do not come when we try,
though they may come through trying.  but an unexpected love
of the island awoke in her, connecting on this side with the
joys of the flesh, on that with the inconceivable.  helen
and her father had known this love, poor leonard bast was
groping after it, but it had been hidden from margaret till
this afternoon.  it had certainly come through the house and
old miss avery.  through them: the notion of "through"
persisted; her mind trembled towards a conclusion which only
the unwise have put into words.  then, veering back into
warmth, it dwelt on ruddy bricks, flowering plum-trees, and
all the tangible joys of, spring.

his property, and had explained to her the use and

he then sent the cheque to the address that helen gave
him, and stated that later on he was instructed to forward
five thousand pounds.  an answer came back, very civil and
quiet in tone--such an answer as tibby himself would have
given.  the cheque was returned, the legacy refused, the
writer being in no need of money.  tibby forwarded this to
helen, adding in the fulness of his heart that leonard bast
seemed somewhat a monumental person after all.  helen's
reply was frantic.  he was to take no notice.  he was to go
down at once and say that she commanded acceptance.  he
went.  a scurf of books and china ornaments awaited them.
the basts had just been evicted for not paying their rent,
and had wandered no one knew whither.  helen had begun
bungling with her money by this time, and had even sold out

its murmur came "now," and "now" once more as they trod the
gravel, and "now," as the moonlight fell upon their father's
sword.  they passed upstairs, kissed, and amidst the endless
iterations fell asleep.  the house had enshadowed the tree
at first, but as the moon rose higher the two disentangled,
and were clear for a few moments at midnight.  margaret
awoke and looked into the garden.  how incomprehensible that
leonard bast should have won her this night of peace!  was
he also part of mrs. wilcox's mind?

far different was leonard's development.  the months after
oniton, whatever minor troubles they might bring him, were
all overshadowed by remorse.  when helen looked back she
could philosophize, or she could look into the future and
plan for her child.  but the father saw nothing beyond his
own sin.  weeks afterwards, in the midst of other
occupations, he would suddenly cry out, "brute--you brute, i
