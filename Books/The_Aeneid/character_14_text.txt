 they, and their mix'd allies, now load the plain.
  to the rude shock of war both armies came;
  their leaders equal, and their strength the same.
  the rear so press'd the front, they could not wield
  their angry weapons, to dispute the field.
  here pallas urges on, and lausus there:
  of equal youth and beauty both appear,
  but both by fate forbid to breathe their native air.
  their congress in the field great jove withstands:
  both doom'd to fall, but fall by greater hands.

  meantime juturna warns the daunian chief
  of lausus' danger, urging swift relief.
  with his driv'n chariot he divides the crowd,
  and, making to his friends, thus calls aloud:
  "let none presume his needless aid to join;
  retire, and clear the field; the fight is mine:
  to this right hand is pallas only due;
  o were his father here, my just revenge to view!"
  from the forbidden space his men retir'd.
  pallas their awe, and his stern words, admir'd;
  survey'd him o'er and o'er with wond'ring sight,

  now, side to side, they measure with their eyes
  the champions' bulk, their sinews, and their size:
  the nearer they approach, the more is known
  th' apparent disadvantage of their own.
  turnus himself appears in public sight
  conscious of fate, desponding of the fight.
  slowly he moves, and at his altar stands
  with eyes dejected, and with trembling hands;
  and, while he mutters undistinguish'd pray'rs,
  a livid deadness in his cheeks appears.

  with anxious pleasure when juturna view'd
  th' increasing fright of the mad multitude,
  when their short sighs and thick'ning sobs she heard,
  and found their ready minds for change prepar'd;
  dissembling her immortal form, she took
  camertus' mien, his habit, and his look;
  a chief of ancient blood; in arms well known
  was his great sire, and he his greater son.
  his shape assum'd, amid the ranks she ran,
  and humoring their first motions, thus began:
  "for shame, rutulians, can you bear the sight
  of one expos'd for

r's nephew, and aeneas' son."
  he said; and, striding, issued on the plain.
  anteus and mnestheus, and a num'rous train,
  attend his steps; the rest their weapons take,
  and, crowding to the field, the camp forsake.
  a cloud of blinding dust is rais'd around,
  labors beneath their feet the trembling ground.

  now turnus, posted on a hill, from far
  beheld the progress of the moving war:
  with him the latins view'd the cover'd plains,
  and the chill blood ran backward in their veins.
  juturna saw th' advancing troops appear,
  and heard the hostile sound, and fled for fear.
  aeneas leads; and draws a sweeping train,
  clos'd in their ranks, and pouring on the plain.
  as when a whirlwind, rushing to the shore
  from the mid ocean, drives the waves before;
  the painful hind with heavy heart foresees
  the flatted fields, and slaughter of the trees;
  with like impetuous rage the prince appears
  before his doubled front, nor less destruction bears.
  and now both armies shock in op

  by gyas', mnestheus', and achates' hand.
  the fatal augur falls, by whose command
  the truce was broken, and whose lance, embrued
  with trojan blood, th' unhappy fight renew'd.
  loud shouts and clamors rend the liquid sky,
  and o'er the field the frighted latins fly.
  the prince disdains the dastards to pursue,
  nor moves to meet in arms the fighting few;
  turnus alone, amid the dusky plain,
  he seeks, and to the combat calls in vain.
  juturna heard, and, seiz'd with mortal fear,
  forc'd from the beam her brother's charioteer;
  assumes his shape, his armor, and his mien,
  and, like metiscus, in his seat is seen.

  as the black swallow near the palace plies;
  o'er empty courts, and under arches, flies;
  now hawks aloft, now skims along the flood,
  to furnish her loquacious nest with food:
  so drives the rapid goddess o'er the plains;
  the smoking horses run with loosen'd reins.
  she steers a various course among the foes;

now here, now there, her conqu'ring brother shows;
  now with a straight, now with a wheeling flight,
  she turns, and bends, but shuns the single fight.
  aeneas, fir'd with fury, breaks the crowd,
  and seeks his foe, and calls by name aloud:
  he runs within a narrower ring, and tries
  to stop the chariot; but the chariot flies.
  if he but gain a glimpse, juturna fears,
  and far away the daunian hero bears.

  what should he do! nor arts nor arms avail;
  and various cares in vain his mind assail.
  the great messapus, thund'ring thro' the field,
  in his left hand two pointed jav'lins held:
  encount'ring on the prince, one dart he drew,
  and with unerring aim and utmost vigor threw.
  aeneas saw it come, and, stooping low
  beneath his buckler, shunn'd the threat'ning blow.
  the weapon hiss'd above his head, and tore
  the waving plume which on his

  confus'd with fear, bereft of human aid,
  then turnus to the gods, and first to faunus pray'd:
  "o faunus, pity! and thou mother earth,
  where i thy foster son receiv'd my birth,
  hold fast the steel! if my religious hand
  your plant has honor'd, which your foes profan'd,
  propitious hear my pious pray'r!" he said,
  nor with successless vows invok'd their aid.
  th' incumbent hero wrench'd, and pull'd, and strain'd;
  but still the stubborn earth the steel detain'd.
  juturna took her time; and, while in vain
  he strove, assum'd meticus' form again,
  and, in that imitated shape, restor'd
  to the despairing prince his daunian sword.
  the queen of love, who, with disdain and grief,
  saw the bold nymph afford this prompt relief,
  t' assert her offspring with a greater deed,
  from the tough root the ling'ring weapon freed.

  once more erect, the rival chiefs advance:
  one trusts the sword, and one the pointed lance;
  and both resolv'd alike to try their fatal

  what more attempts for turnus can be made,
  that thus thou ling'rest in this lonely shade?
  is it becoming of the due respect
  and awful honor of a god elect,
  a wound unworthy of our state to feel,
  patient of human hands and earthly steel?
  or seems it just, the sister should restore
  a second sword, when one was lost before,
  and arm a conquer'd wretch against his conqueror?
  for what, without thy knowledge and avow,
  nay more, thy dictate, durst juturna do?
  at last, in deference to my love, forbear
  to lodge within thy soul this anxious care;
  reclin'd upon my breast, thy grief unload:
  who should relieve the goddess, but the god?
  now all things to their utmost issue tend,
  push'd by the fates to their appointed
  while leave was giv'n thee, and a lawful hour
  for vengeance, wrath, and unresisted pow'r,
  toss'd on the seas, thou couldst thy foes distress,
  and, driv'n ashore, with hostile arms oppress;
  deform the royal house; and,

  now cease at my command." the thund'rer said;
  and, with dejected eyes, this answer juno made:
  "because your dread decree too well i knew,
  from turnus and from earth unwilling i withdrew.
  else should you not behold me here, alone,
  involv'd in empty clouds, my friends bemoan,
  but, girt with vengeful flames, in open sight
  engag'd against my foes in mortal fight.
  't is true, juturna mingled in the strife
  by my command, to save her brother's life-
  at least to try; but, by the stygian lake,
  (the most religious oath the gods can take,)
  with this restriction, not to bend the bow,
  or toss the spear, or trembling dart to throw.
  and now, resign'd to your superior might,
  and tir'd with fruitless toils, i loathe the fight.
  this let me beg (and this no fates withstand)
  both for myself and for your father's land,
  that, when the nuptial bed shall bind the peace,

to flit in air,
  with serpents girt alike, and crown'd with hissing hair.
  in heav'n the dirae call'd, and still at hand,
  before the throne of angry jove they stand,
  his ministers of wrath, and ready still
  the minds of mortal men with fears to fill,
  whene'er the moody sire, to wreak his hate
  on realms or towns deserving of their fate,
  hurls down diseases, death and deadly care,
  and terrifies the guilty world with war.
  one sister plague if these from heav'n he sent,
  to fright juturna with a dire portent.
  the pest comes whirling down: by far more slow
  springs the swift arrow from the parthian bow,
  or cydon yew, when, traversing the skies,
  and drench'd in pois'nous juice, the sure destruction flies.
  with such a sudden and unseen a flight
  shot thro' the clouds the daughter of the night.
  soon as the field inclos'd she had in view,
  and from afar her destin'd quarry knew,
  contracted, to the boding bird she turns,
  which haunts the ruin'd piles and hallow'd urns

  and beats about the tombs with nightly wings,
  where songs obscene on sepulchers she sings.
  thus lessen'd in her form, with frightful cries
  the fury round unhappy turnus flies,
  flaps on his shield, and flutters o'er his eyes.

  a lazy chillness crept along his blood;
  chok'd was his voice; his hair with horror stood.
  juturna from afar beheld her fly,
  and knew th' ill omen, by her screaming cry
  and stridor of her wings. amaz'd with fear,
  her beauteous breast she beat, and rent her flowing hair.

  "ah me!" she cries, "in this unequal strife
  what can thy sister more to save thy life?
  weak as i am, can i, alas! contend
  in arms with that inexorable fiend?
  now, now, i quit the field! forbear to fright
  my tender soul, ye baleful birds of night;
  the lashing of your wings i know too well,
