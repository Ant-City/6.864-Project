 now, no tangible evidence to the contrary; but since the previous night a vague dread had hung on his sky-line. it was formed of zeena’s obstinate silence, of mattie’s sudden look of warning, of the memory of just such fleeting imperceptible signs as those which told him, on certain stainless mornings, that before night there would be rain.
his dread was so strong that, man-like, he sought to postpone certainty. the hauling was not over till mid-day, and as the lumber was to be delivered to andrew hale, the starkfield builder, it was really easier for ethan to send jotham powell, the hired man, back to the farm on foot, and drive the load down to the village himself. he had scrambled up on the logs, and was sitting astride of them, close over his shaggy grays, when, coming between him and their streaming necks, he had a vision of the warning look that mattie had given him the night before.
“if there’s going to be any trouble i want to be there,” was his vague reflection, as he threw to

even more disturbing than the other; and it was the one which had come to him the night before, when he had seen her standing in the kitchen door.
now her departure for bettsbridge had once more eased his mind, and all his thoughts were on the prospect of his evening with mattie. only one thing weighed on him, and that was his having told zeena that he was to receive cash for the lumber. he foresaw so clearly the consequences of this imprudence that with considerable reluctance he decided to ask andrew hale for a small advance on his load.
when ethan drove into hale’s yard the builder was just getting out of his sleigh.
“hello, ethe!” he said. “this comes handy.”
andrew hale was a ruddy man with a big gray moustache and a stubbly double-chin unconstrained by a collar; but his scrupulously clean shirt was always fastened by a small diamond stud. this display of opulence was misleading, for though he did a fairly good business it was known that his easygoing habits and the demands of his l

advance of fifty dollars. the blood rushed to his thin skin under the sting of hale’s astonishment. it was the builder’s custom to pay at the end of three months, and there was no precedent between the two men for a cash settlement.
ethan felt that if he had pleaded an urgent need hale might have made shift to pay him; but pride, and an instinctive prudence, kept him from resorting to this argument. after his father’s death it had taken time to get his head above water, and he did not want andrew hale, or any one else in starkfield, to think he was going under again. besides, he hated lying; if he wanted the money he wanted it, and it was nobody’s business to ask why. he therefore made his demand with the awkwardness of a proud man who will not admit to himself that he is stooping; and he was not much surprised at hale’s refusal.
the builder refused genially, as he did everything else: he treated the matter as something in the nature of a practical joke, and wanted to know if ethan medit

ecting the farm enough already,” and this being true, he found no answer, and left her time to add ironically: “better send me over to the almshouse and done with it... i guess there’s been fromes there afore now.”
the taunt burned into him, but he let it pass. “i haven’t got the money. that settles it.”
there was a moment’s pause in the struggle, as though the combatants were testing their weapons. then zeena said in a level voice: “i thought you were to get fifty dollars from andrew hale for that lumber.”
“andrew hale never pays under three months.” he had hardly spoken when he remembered the excuse he had made for not accompanying his wife to the station the day before; and the blood rose to his frowning brows.
“why, you told me yesterday you’d fixed it up with him to pay cash down. you said that was why you couldn’t drive me over to the flats.”
ethan had no suppleness in deceiving. he had never before been convicted of a lie, and all the resources of evasion fai

 days when the glitter of winter shines through a pale haze of spring. every yard of the road was alive with mattie’s presence, and there was hardly a branch against the sky or a tangle of brambles on the bank in which some bright shred of memory was not caught. once, in the stillness, the call of a bird in a mountain ash was so like her laughter that his heart tightened and then grew large; and all these things made him see that something must be done at once.
suddenly it occurred to him that andrew hale, who was a kind-hearted man, might be induced to reconsider his refusal and advance a small sum on the lumber if he were told that zeena’s ill-health made it necessary to hire a servant. hale, after all, knew enough of ethan’s situation to make it possible for the latter to renew his appeal without too much loss of pride; and, moreover, how much did pride count in the ebullition of passions in his breast?
the more he considered his plan the more hopeful it seemed. if he could get mrs. hale
