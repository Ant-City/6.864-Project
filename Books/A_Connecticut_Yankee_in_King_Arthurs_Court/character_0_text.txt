the book down there was a knock at the door, and my
stranger came in.  i gave him a pipe and a chair, and made him
welcome.  i also comforted him with a hot scotch whisky; gave him
another one; then still another--hoping always for his story.
after a fourth persuader, he drifted into it himself, in a quite
simple and natural way:



the stranger’s history

i am an american.  i was born and reared in hartford, in the state
of connecticut--anyway, just over the river, in the country.  so
i am a yankee of the yankees--and practical; yes, and nearly
barren of sentiment, i suppose--or poetry, in other words.  my
father was a blacksmith, my uncle was a horse doctor, and i was
both, along at first.  then i went over to the great arms factory
and learned my real trade; learned all there was to it; learned
to make everything: guns, revolvers, cannon, boilers, engines, all
sorts of labor-saving machinery.  why, i could make anything
a body wanted--anything in the world, it didn’t make any differenc

he handed me his manuscript, and pointed out the place where
i should begin:

“begin here--i’ve already told you what goes before.”  he was
steeped in drowsiness by this time.  as i went out at his door
i heard him murmur sleepily: “give you good den, fair sir.”

i sat down by my fire and examined my treasure.  the first part
of it--the great bulk of it--was parchment, and yellow with age.
i scanned a leaf particularly and saw that it was a palimpsest.
under the old dim writing of the yankee historian appeared traces
of a penmanship which was older and dimmer still--latin words
and sentences: fragments from old monkish legends, evidently.
i turned to the place indicated by my stranger and began to read
--as follows:




the tale of the lost land




chapter i

camelot

“camelot--camelot,” said i to myself.  “i don’t seem to remember
hearing of it before.  name of the asylum, likely.”

it was a soft, reposeful summer landscape, as lovely as a dream,
and as lonesome as sunda

inded me several times, of late, that
the postponement i had asked for, four years before, had about
run out now.  it was a hint that i ought to be starting out to seek
adventures and get up a reputation of a size to make me worthy
of the honor of breaking a lance with sir sagramor, who was still
out grailing, but was being hunted for by various relief expeditions,
and might be found any year, now.  so you see i was expecting
this interruption; it did not take me by surprise.



chapter xi

the yankee in search of adventures

there never was such a country for wandering liars; and they were
of both sexes.  hardly a month went by without one of these tramps
arriving; and generally loaded with a tale about some princess or
other wanting help to get her out of some far-away castle where
she was held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel, usually a giant.
now you would think that the first thing the king would do after
listening to such a novelette from an entire stranger, would be
to ask for crede

, and that there is
no other satisfied ambition, whether of king, conqueror, or poet,
that ever reaches half-way to that serene far summit or yields half
so divine a contentment.

during all the rest of the seance my paper traveled from group to
group all up and down and about that huge hall, and my happy eye
was upon it always, and i sat motionless, steeped in satisfaction,
drunk with enjoyment.  yes, this was heaven; i was tasting it once,
if i might never taste it more.



chapter xxvii

the yankee and the king travel incognito

about bedtime i took the king to my private quarters to cut his
hair and help him get the hang of the lowly raiment he was to wear.
the high classes wore their hair banged across the forehead but
hanging to the shoulders the rest of the way around, whereas the
lowest ranks of commoners were banged fore and aft both; the slaves
were bangless, and allowed their hair free growth.  so i inverted
a bowl over his head and cut away all the locks that hung below it.

but no; you see i was an unknown person, among a cruelly oppressed
and suspicious people, a people always accustomed to having advantage
taken of their helplessness, and never expecting just or kind
treatment from any but their own families and very closest intimates.
appeal to _me_ to be gentle, to be fair, to be generous?  of course,
they wanted to, but they couldn’t dare.



chapter xxxiv

the yankee and the king sold as slaves

well, what had i better do?  nothing in a hurry, sure.  i must
get up a diversion; anything to employ me while i could think,
and while these poor fellows could have a chance to come to life
again.  there sat marco, petrified in the act of trying to get
the hang of his miller-gun--turned to stone, just in the attitude
he was in when my pile-driver fell, the toy still gripped in his
unconscious fingers.  so i took it from him and proposed to explain
its mystery.  myst
