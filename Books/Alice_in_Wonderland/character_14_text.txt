gnorant little girl sheâ€™ll think me for asking! no, itâ€™ll never do to
ask: perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere.â€™

down, down, down. there was nothing else to do, so alice soon began
talking again. â€˜dinahâ€™ll miss me very much to-night, i should think!â€™
(dinah was the cat.) â€˜i hope theyâ€™ll remember her saucer of milk at
tea-time. dinah my dear! i wish you were down here with me! there are no
mice in the air, iâ€™m afraid, but you might catch a bat, and thatâ€™s very
like a mouse, you know. but do cats eat bats, i wonder?â€™ and here alice
began to get rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy
sort of way, â€˜do cats eat bats? do cats eat bats?â€™ and sometimes, â€˜do
bats eat cats?â€™ for, you see, as she couldnâ€™t answer either question,
it didnâ€™t much matter which way she put it. she felt that she was dozing
off, and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with
dinah, and saying to her very earnestly, â€˜now, dinah, tell me the tr

 so much!â€™ said alice, as she swam about, trying
to find her way out. â€˜i shall be punished for it now, i suppose, by
being drowned in my own tears! that will be a queer thing, to be sure!
however, everything is queer to-day.â€™

just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way
off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was: at first she thought
it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then she remembered how small
she was now, and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had
slipped in like herself.

â€˜would it be of any use, now,â€™ thought alice, â€˜to speak to this mouse?
everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that i should think very
likely it can talk: at any rate, thereâ€™s no harm in trying.â€™ so she
began: â€˜o mouse, do you know the way out of this pool? i am very tired
of swimming about here, o mouse!â€™ (alice thought this must be the right
way of speaking to a mouse: she had never done such a thing before, but
she remembered having seen i

n her brotherâ€™s latin grammar, â€˜a mouse--of
a mouse--to a mouse--a mouse--o mouse!â€™) the mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes,
but it said nothing.

â€˜perhaps it doesnâ€™t understand english,â€™ thought alice; â€˜i daresay itâ€™s
a french mouse, come over with william the conqueror.â€™ (for, with all
her knowledge of history, alice had no very clear notion how long ago
anything had happened.) so she began again: â€˜ou est ma chatte?â€™ which
was the first sentence in her french lesson-book. the mouse gave a
sudden leap out of the water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.
â€˜oh, i beg your pardon!â€™ cried alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt
the poor animalâ€™s feelings. â€˜i quite forgot you didnâ€™t like cats.â€™

â€˜not

like cats!â€™ cried the mouse, in a shrill, passionate voice. â€˜would
you like cats if you were me?â€™

â€˜well, perhaps not,â€™ said alice in a soothing tone: â€˜donâ€™t be angry
about it. and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah: i think youâ€™d
take a fancy to cats if you could only see her. she is such a dear quiet
thing,â€™ alice went on, half to herself, as she swam lazily about in the
pool, â€˜and she sits purring so nicely by the fire, licking her paws and
washing her face--and she is such a nice soft thing to

 nurse--and sheâ€™s
such a capital one for catching mice--oh, i beg your pardon!â€™ cried
alice again, for this time the mouse was bristling all over, and she
felt certain it must be really offended. â€˜we wonâ€™t talk about her any
more if youâ€™d rather not.â€™

â€˜we indeed!â€™ cried the mouse, who was trembling down to the end of his
tail. â€˜as if i would talk on such a subject! our family always hated
cats: nasty, low, vulgar things! donâ€™t let me hear the name again!â€™

â€˜i wonâ€™t indeed!â€™ said alice, in a great hurry to change the subject of
conversation. â€˜are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?â€™ the mouse did not
answer, so alice went on eagerly: â€˜there is such a nice little dog near
our house i should like to show you! a little bright-eyed terrier, you
know, with oh, s

says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!â€™ cried alice in a sorrowful
tone, â€˜iâ€™m afraid iâ€™ve offended it again!â€™ for the mouse was swimming
away from her as hard as it could go, and making quite a commotion in
the pool as it went.

so she called softly after it, â€˜mouse dear! do come back again, and we
wonâ€™t talk about cats or dogs either, if you donâ€™t like them!â€™ when the
mouse heard this, it turned round and swam slowly back to her: its
face was quite pale (with passion, alice thought), and it said in a low
trembling voice, â€˜let us get to the shore, and then iâ€™ll tell you my
history, and youâ€™ll understan

get dry again: they had a
consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural
to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them, as if she had
known them all her life. indeed, she had quite a long argument with the
lory, who at last turned sulky, and would only say, â€˜i am older than
you, and must know betterâ€™; and this alice would not allow without
knowing how old it was, and, as the lory positively refused to tell its
age, there was no more to be said.

at last the mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among them,
called out, â€˜sit down, all of you, and listen to me! iâ€™ll soon make you
dry enough!â€™ they all sat down at once, in a large ring, with the mouse
in the middle. alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it, for she felt
sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon.

â€˜ahem!â€™ said the mouse with an important air, â€˜are you all ready? this
is the driest thing i know. silence all round, if you please! â€œwilliam

â€˜not i!â€™ said the lory hastily.

â€˜i thought you did,â€™ said the mouse. â€˜--i proceed. â€œedwin and morcar,

the patriotic archbishop of canterbury, found it advisable--â€œâ€™

â€˜found what?â€™ said the duck.

â€˜found it,â€™ the mouse replied rather crossly: â€˜of course you know what
â€œitâ€ means.â€™

â€˜i know what â€œitâ€ means well enough, when i find a thing,â€™ said the
duck: â€˜itâ€™s generally a frog or a worm. the question is, what did the

ite a chorus of voices asked.

â€˜why, she, of course,â€™ said the dodo, pointing to alice with one finger;
and the whole party at once crowded round her, calling out in a confused
way, â€˜prizes! prizes!â€™

alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand in her
pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had
not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. there was exactly one
a-piece all round.

â€˜but she must have a prize herself, you know,â€™ said the mouse.

â€˜of course,â€™ the dodo replied very gravely. â€˜what else have you got in
your pocket?â€™ he went on, turning to alice.

â€˜only a thimble,â€™ said alice sadly.

â€˜hand it over here,â€™ said the dodo.

then they all crowded round her once more, while the dodo solemnly
presented the thimble, saying â€˜we beg your acceptance of this elegant
thimbleâ€™; and, when it had finished this short speech, they all cheered.

alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked so grave
that

 she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not think of anything
to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble, looking as solemn as she
could.

the next thing was to eat the comfits: this caused some noise and
confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not taste
theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back.
however, it was over at last, and they sat down again in a ring, and
begged the mouse to tell them something more.

â€˜you promised to tell me your history, you know,â€™ said alice, â€˜and why
it is you hate--c and d,â€™ she added in a whisper, half afraid that it
would be offended again.

â€˜mine is a long and a sad tale!â€™ said the mouse, turning to alice, and
sighing.

â€˜it is a long tail, certainly,â€™ said alice, looking down with wonder at
the mouseâ€™s tail; â€˜but why do you call it sad?â€™ and she kept on puzzling
about it while the mouse was speaking, so that her ide

a of the tale was
something like this:--

         â€˜fury said to a

     â€œlet us

      said the

         dear sir,
            with

thinking of?â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon,â€™ said alice very humbly: â€˜you had got to the fifth
bend, i think?â€™

â€˜i had not!â€™ cried the mouse, sharply and very angrily.

â€˜a knot!â€™ said alice, always ready to make herself useful, and looking
anxiously about her. â€˜oh, do let me help to undo it!â€™

â€˜i shall do nothing of the sort,â€™ said the mouse, getting up and walking
away. â€˜you insult me by talking such nonsense!â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t mean it!â€™ pleaded poor alice. â€˜but youâ€™re so easily offended,
you know!â€™

the mouse only growled in reply.

â€˜please come back and finish your story!â€™ alice called after it; and the
others all joined in chorus, â€˜yes, please do!â€™ but the mouse only shook
its head impatiently, and walked a little quicker.

â€˜what a pity it wouldnâ€™t stay!â€™ sighed the lory, as soon as it was quite

 off, and alice was soon left alone.

â€˜i wish i hadnâ€™t mentioned dinah!â€™ she said to herself in a melancholy
tone. â€˜nobody seems to like her, down here, and iâ€™m sure sheâ€™s the best
cat in the world! oh, my dear dinah! i wonder if i shall ever see you
any more!â€™ and here poor alice began to cry again, for she felt very
lonely and low-spirited. in a little while, however, she again heard
a little pattering of footsteps in the distance, and she looked up
eagerly, half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind, and was coming
back to finish his story.




chapter iv. the rabbit sends in a little bill

it was the white rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and looking
anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something; and she heard
it muttering to itself â€˜the duchess! the duchess! oh my dear paws! oh
my fur and whiskers! sheâ€™ll get me executed, as sure as ferrets are
ferrets! where can i have dropped them, i wonder?â€™ alice guessed in a
moment that it was looking for the

knocking, and hurried upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the
real mary ann, and be turned out of the house before she had found the
fan and gloves.

â€˜how queer it seems,â€™ alice said to herself, â€˜to be going messages for
a rabbit! i suppose dinahâ€™ll be sending me on messages next!â€™ and she
began fancying the sort of thing that would happen: â€˜â€œmiss alice! come
here directly, and get ready for your walk!â€ â€œcoming in a minute,
nurse! but iâ€™ve got to see that the mouse doesnâ€™t get out.â€ only i donâ€™t
think,â€™ alice went on, â€˜that theyâ€™d let dinah stop in the house if it
began ordering people about like that!â€™

by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table
in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two or three pairs
of tiny white kid gloves: she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves,
and was just going to leave the room, when her eye fell upon a little
bottle that stood near the looking-glass. there was no l

was so large a house, that she did not like to go nearer till she had
nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom, and raised herself to
about two feet high: even then she walked up towards it rather timidly,
saying to herself â€˜suppose it should be raving mad after all! i almost
wish iâ€™d gone to see the hatter instead!â€™




chapter vii. a mad tea-party

there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the
march hare and the hatter were having tea at it: a dormouse was sitting
between them, fast asleep, and the other two were using it as a
cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking over its head. â€˜very
uncomfortable for the dormouse,â€™ thought alice; â€˜only, as itâ€™s asleep, i
suppose it doesnâ€™t mind.â€™

the table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at
one corner of it: â€˜no room! no room!â€™ they cried out when they saw alice
coming. â€˜thereâ€™s plenty of room!â€™ said alice indignantly, and she sat
down in a large ar

 what you mean,â€™ the march hare went on.

â€˜i do,â€™ alice hastily replied; â€˜at least--at least i mean what i
say--thatâ€™s the same thing, you know.â€™

â€˜not the same thing a bit!â€™ said the hatter. â€˜you might just as well say
that â€œi see what i eatâ€ is the same thing as â€œi eat what i seeâ€!â€™

â€˜you might just as well say,â€™ added the march hare, â€˜that â€œi like what i
getâ€ is the same thing as â€œi get what i likeâ€!â€™

â€˜you might just as well say,â€™ added the dormouse, who seemed to be
talking in his sleep, â€˜that â€œi breathe when i sleepâ€ is the same thing
as â€œi sleep when i breatheâ€!â€™

â€˜it is the same thing with you,â€™ said the hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute, while alice
thought over all she could remember about ravens and writing-desks,
which wasnâ€™t much.

the hatter was the first to break the silence. â€˜what day of the month
is it?â€™ he said, turning to alice: he had taken his watch out o
 
 ___________________________
 
s!â€™

â€˜why should it?â€™ muttered the hatter. â€˜does your watch tell you what
year it is?â€™

â€˜of course not,â€™ alice replied very readily: â€˜but thatâ€™s because it
stays the same year for such a long time together.â€™

â€˜which is just the case with mine,â€™ said the hatter.

alice felt dreadfully puzzled. the hatterâ€™s remark seemed to have no
sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly english. â€˜i donâ€™t quite
understand you,â€™ she said, as politely as she could.

â€˜the dormouse is asleep again,â€™ said the hatter, and he poured a little
hot tea upon its nose.

the dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without opening its
eyes, â€˜of course, of course; just what i was going to remark myself.â€™

â€˜have you guessed the riddle yet?â€™ the hatter said, turning to alice
again.

â€˜no, i give it up,â€™ alice replied: â€˜whatâ€™s the answer?â€™

â€˜i havenâ€™t the slightest idea,â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜nor i,â€™ said the march hare.

alice sighed wearily. â€˜i thi

ent mad, you know--â€™ (pointing
with his tea spoon at the march hare,) â€˜--it was at the great concert
given by the queen of hearts, and i had to sing

     â€œtwinkle, twinkle, little bat!
     how i wonder what youâ€™re at!â€

you know the song, perhaps?â€™

â€˜iâ€™ve heard something like it,â€™ said alice.

â€˜it goes on, you know,â€™ the hatter continued, â€˜in this way:--

     â€œup above the world you fly,
     like a tea-tray in the sky.
         twinkle, twinkle--â€œâ€™

here the dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep â€˜twinkle,
twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--â€™ and went on so long that they had to pinch
it to make it stop.

â€˜well, iâ€™d hardly finished the first verse,â€™ said the hatter, â€˜when the
queen jumped up and bawled out, â€œheâ€™s murdering the time! off with his
head!â€â€™

â€˜how dreadfully savage!â€™ exclaimed alice.

â€˜and ever since that,â€™ the hatter went on in a mournful tone, â€˜he wonâ€™t

to wash the things between whiles.â€™

â€˜then you keep moving round, i suppose?â€™ said alice.

â€˜exactly so,â€™ said the hatter: â€˜as the things get used up.â€™

â€˜but what happens when you come to the beginning again?â€™ alice ventured
to ask.

â€˜suppose we change the subject,â€™ the march hare interrupted, yawning.
â€˜iâ€™m getting tired of this. i vote the young lady tells us a story.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m afraid i donâ€™t know one,â€™ said alice, rather alarmed at the
proposal.

â€˜then the dormouse shall!â€™ they both cried. â€˜wake up, dormouse!â€™ and
they pinched it on both sides at once.

the dormouse slowly opened his eyes. â€˜i wasnâ€™t asleep,â€™ he said in a
hoarse, feeble voice: â€˜i heard every word you fellows were saying.â€™

â€˜tell us a story!â€™ said the march hare.

â€˜yes, please do!â€™ pleaded alice.

â€˜and be quick about it,â€™ added the hatter, â€˜or youâ€™ll be asleep again
before itâ€™s done.â€™

â€˜once upon a time there were three little sisters,â€™ the dormouse b

in a great hurry; â€˜and their names were elsie, lacie, and tillie; and
they lived at the bottom of a well--â€™

â€˜what did they live on?â€™ said alice, who always took a great interest in
questions of eating and drinking.

â€˜they lived on treacle,â€™ said the dormouse, after thinking a minute or
two.

â€˜they couldnâ€™t have done that, you know,â€™ alice gently remarked; â€˜theyâ€™d
have been ill.â€™

â€˜so they were,â€™ said the dormouse; â€˜very ill.â€™

alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways of
living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went on: â€˜but
why did they live at the bottom of a well?â€™

â€˜take some more tea,â€™ the march hare said to alice, very earnestly.

â€˜iâ€™ve had nothing yet,â€™ alice replied in an offended tone, â€˜so i canâ€™t
take more.â€™

â€˜you mean you canâ€™t take less,â€™ said the hatter: â€˜itâ€™s very easy to take
more than nothing.â€™

â€˜nobody asked yo
 
 ___________________________
 
ur opinion,â€™ said alice.

â€˜whoâ€™s making personal remarks now?â€™ the hatter asked triumphantly.

alice did not quite know what to say to this: so she helped herself
to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the dormouse, and
repeated her question. â€˜why did they live at the bottom of a well?â€™

the dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and then
said, â€˜it was a treacle-well.â€™

â€˜thereâ€™s no such thing!â€™ alice was beginning very angrily, but the
hatter and the march hare went â€˜sh! sh!â€™ and the dormouse sulkily
remarked, â€˜if you canâ€™t be civil, youâ€™d better finish the story for
yourself.â€™

â€˜no, please go on!â€™ alice said very humbly; â€˜i wonâ€™t interrupt again. i
dare say there may be one.â€™

â€˜one, indeed!â€™ said the dormouse indignantly. however, he cons

ented to
go on. â€˜and so these three little sisters--they were learning to draw,
you know--â€™

â€˜what did they draw?â€™ said alice, quite forgetting her promise.

â€˜treacle,â€™ said the dormouse, without considering at all this time.

â€˜i want a clean cup,â€™ interrupted the hatter: â€˜letâ€™s all move one place
on.â€™

he moved on as he spoke, and the dormouse followed him: the march hare
moved into the dormouseâ€™s place, and alice rather unwillingly took
the place of the march hare. the hatter was the only one who got any
advantage from the change: and alice was a good deal worse off than
before, as the march hare had just upset the milk-jug into his plate.

alice did not wish to offend the dormouse again, so she began very
cautiously: â€˜but i donâ€™t understand. where did they draw the treacle
from?â€™

â€˜you can draw water out of a water-well,â€™ said the hatter; â€˜so i should
think you could dr

aw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh, stupid?â€™

â€˜but they were in the well,â€™ alice said to the dormouse, not choosing to
notice this last remark.

â€˜of course they wereâ€™, said the dormouse; â€˜--well in.â€™

this answer so confused poor alice, that she let the dormouse go on for
some time without interrupting it.

â€˜they were learning to draw,â€™ the dormouse went on, yawning and rubbing
its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; â€˜and they drew all manner of
things--everything that begins with an m--â€™

â€˜why with an m?â€™ said alice.

â€˜why not?â€™ said the march hare.

alice was silent.

the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going off into
a doze; but, on being pinched by the hatter, it woke up again with
a little shriek, and went on: â€˜--that begins with an m, such as
mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--you

know you say
things are â€œmuch of a muchnessâ€--did you ever see such a thing as a
drawing of a muchness?â€™

â€˜really, now you ask me,â€™ said alice, very much confused, â€˜i donâ€™t
think--â€™

â€˜then you shouldnâ€™t talk,â€™ said the hatter.

this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear: she got up in
great disgust, and walked off; the dormouse fell asleep instantly, and
neither of the others took the least notice of her going, though she
looked back once or twice, half hoping that they would call after her:
the last time she saw them, they were trying to put the dormouse into
the teapot.

â€˜at any rate iâ€™ll never go there again!â€™ said alice as she picked her
way through the wood. â€˜itâ€™s the stupidest tea-party i ever was at in all
my life!â€™

just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a door

abbit blew three
blasts on the trumpet, and called out, â€˜first witness!â€™

the first witness was the hatter. he came in with a teacup in one
hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other. â€˜i beg pardon, your
majesty,â€™ he began, â€˜for bringing these in: but i hadnâ€™t quite finished
my tea when i was sent for.â€™

â€˜you ought to have finished,â€™ said the king. â€˜when did you begin?â€™

the hatter looked at the march hare, who had followed him into the
court, arm-in-arm with the dormouse. â€˜fourteenth of march, i think it
was,â€™ he said.

â€˜fifteenth,â€™ said the march hare.

â€˜sixteenth,â€™ added the dormouse.

â€˜write that down,â€™ the king said to the jury, and the jury eagerly
wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then added them up, and
reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

â€˜take off your hat,â€™ the king said to the hatter.

â€˜it isnâ€™t mine,â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜stolen!â€™ the king exclaimed, turning to the jury, who instantly made a

ther, looking uneasily at the queen, and in
his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the
bread-and-butter.

just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation, which puzzled
her a good deal until she made out what it was: she was beginning to
grow larger again, and she thought at first she would get up and leave
the court; but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as
long as there was room for her.

â€˜i wish you wouldnâ€™t squeeze so.â€™ said the dormouse, who was sitting
next to her. â€˜i can hardly breathe.â€™

â€˜i canâ€™t help it,â€™ said alice very meekly: â€˜iâ€™m growing.â€™

â€˜youâ€™ve no right to grow here,â€™ said the dormouse.

â€˜donâ€™t talk nonsense,â€™ said alice more boldly: â€˜you know youâ€™re growing
too.â€™

â€˜yes, but i grow at a reasonable pace,â€™ said the dormouse: â€˜not in that
ridiculous fashion.â€™ and he got up very sulkily and crossed over to the
other side of the court.

all this time the queen had never left off

just as the dormouse crossed the court, she said to one of the officers
of the court, â€˜bring me the list of the singers in the last concert!â€™ on
which the wretched hatter trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

â€˜give your evidence,â€™ the king repeated angrily, â€˜or iâ€™ll have you
executed, whether youâ€™re nervous or not.â€™

â€˜iâ€™m a poor man, your majesty,â€™ the hatter began, in a trembling voice,
â€˜--and i hadnâ€™t begun my tea--not above a week or so--and what with the
bread-and-butter gett

€˜it began with the tea,â€™ the hatter replied.

â€˜of course twinkling begins with a t!â€™ said the king sharply. â€˜do you
take me for a dunce? go on!â€™

â€˜iâ€™m a poor man,â€™ the hatter went on, â€˜and most things twinkled after
that--only the march hare said--â€™

â€˜i didnâ€™t!â€™ the march hare interrupted in a great hurry.

â€˜you did!â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜i deny it!â€™ said the march hare.

â€˜he denies it,â€™ said the king: â€˜leave out that part.â€™

â€˜well, at any rate, the dormouse said--â€™ the hatter went on, looking
anxiously round to see if he would deny it too: but the dormouse denied
nothing, being fast asleep.

â€˜after that,â€™ continued the hatter, â€˜i cut some more bread-and-butter--â€™

â€˜but what did the dormouse say?â€™ one of the jury asked.

â€˜that i canâ€™t remember,â€™ said the hatter.

â€˜you must remember,â€™ remarked the king, â€˜or iâ€™ll have you executed.â€™

the miserable hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter, and went
down on one knee.

â€˜shanâ€™t,â€™ said the cook.

the king looked anxiously at the white rabbit, who said in a low voice,
â€˜your majesty must cross-examine this witness.â€™

â€˜well, if i must, i must,â€™ the king said, with a melancholy air, and,
after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till his eyes were
nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, â€˜what are tarts made of?â€™

â€˜pepper, mostly,â€™ said the cook.

â€˜treacle,â€™ said a sleepy voice behind her.

â€˜collar that dormouse,â€™ the queen shrieked out. â€˜behead that dormouse!
turn that dormouse out of court! suppress him! pinch him! off with his
whiskers!â€™

for some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the dormouse
turned out, and, by the time they had settled down again, the cook had
disappeared.

â€˜never mind!â€™ said the king, with an air of great relief. â€˜call the next
witness.â€™ and he added in an undertone to the queen, â€˜really, my dear,
you must cross-examine the next witness. it quite

f, and once again the tiny
hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes were looking
up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her voice, and see that
queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that
would always get into her eyes--and still as she listened, or seemed to
listen, the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures
of her little sisterâ€™s dream.

the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried by--the
frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring pool--she
could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends
shared their never-ending meal, and the shrill voice of the queen
ordering off her unfortunate guests to execution--once more the pig-baby
was sneezing on the duchessâ€™s knee, while plates and dishes crashed
around it--once more the shriek of the gryphon, the squeaking of the
lizardâ€™s slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up w
