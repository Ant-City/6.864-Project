[CHARACTER] - 
  the sturdy, good-natured lord of the castle where
gawain spends christmas. we only learn bertilak's name at the end
of sir gawain and the green knight. the poem associates
bertilak with the natural world--his beard resembles a beaver, his
face a fire--but also with the courtly behavior of an aristocratic host.
boisterous, powerful, brave, and generous, lord bertilak provides
an interesting foil to king arthur. at the end of the poem we learn
that bertilak and the green knight are the same person, magically enchanted
by morgan le faye for her own designs.
