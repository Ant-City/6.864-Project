[CHARACTER]  - 
the novel's protagonist. tess is a beautiful, loyal
young woman living with her impoverished family in the village of
marlott. tess has a keen sense of responsibility and is committed
to doing the best she can for her family, although her inexperience
and lack of wise parenting leave her extremely vulnerable. her life
is complicated when her father discovers a link to the noble line
of the d'urbervilles, and, as a result, tess is sent to work at
the d'urberville mansion. unfortunately, her ideals cannot prevent
her from sliding further and further into misfortune after she becomes
pregnant by alec d'urberville. the terrible irony is that tess and
her family are not really related to this branch of the d'urbervilles
at all: alec's father, a merchant named simon stokes, simply assumed
the name after he retired.
