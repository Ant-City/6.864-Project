nless in the sun. now and then
the sails rippled with a little breeze in them, but the ripple ran over
them and ceased. the boat made no motion at all. mr. ramsay sat in the
middle of the boat. he would be impatient in a moment, james thought,
and cam thought, looking at her father, who sat in the middle of the
boat between them (james steered; cam sat alone in the bow) with his
legs tightly curled. he hated hanging about. sure enough, after
fidgeting a second or two, he said something sharp to macalister's boy,
who got out his oars and began to row. but their father, they knew,
would never be content until they were flying along. he would keep
looking for a breeze, fidgeting, saying things under his breath, which
macalister and and macalister's boy would overhear, and they would both
be made horribly uncomfortable. he had made them come. he had forced
them to come. in their anger they hoped that the breeze would never
rise, that he might be thwarted in every possible way, since he had
forced th

 to the death. so there they would sit, one
at one end of the boat, one at the other, in silence. they would say
nothing, only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs
twisted, frowning and fidgeting, and pishing and pshawing and muttering
things to himself, and waiting impatiently for a breeze. and they
hoped it would be calm. they hoped he would be thwarted. they hoped
the whole expedition would fail, and they would have to put back, with
their parcels, to the beach.

but now, when macalister's boy had rowed a little way out, the sails
slowly swung round, the boat quickened itself, flattened itself, and
shot off. instantly, as if some great strain had been relieved, mr.
ramsay uncurled his legs, took out his tobacco pouch, handed it with a
little grunt to macalister, and felt, they knew, for all they suffered,
perfectly content. now they would sail on for hours like this, and mr.
ramsay would ask old macalister a question--about the great storm
last winter probably--and old macalist

er would answer it, and they
would puff their pipes together, and macalister would take a tarry rope
in his fingers, tying or untying some knot, and the boy would fish, and
never say a word to any one. james would be forced to keep his eye all
the time on the sail. for if he forgot, then the sail puckered and
shivered, and the boat slackened, and mr. ramsay would say sharply,
"look out! look out!" and old macalister would turn slowly on his
seat. so they heard mr. ramsay asking some question about the great
storm at christmas. "she comes driving round the point," old
macalister said, describing the great storm last christmas, when ten
ships had been driven into the bay for shelter, and he had seen "one
there, one there, one there" (he pointed slowly round the bay. mr.
ramsay followed him, turning his head). he had seen four men clinging
to the mast. then she was gone. "and at last we shoved her off," he

nt on (but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word
here and there, sitting at opposite ends of the boat, united by their
compact to fight tyranny to the death). at last they had shoved
her off, they had launched the lifeboat, and they had got her out
past the point--macalister told the story; and though they only
caught a word here and there, they were conscious all the time of their
father--how he leant forward, how he brought his voice into tune with
macalister's voice; how, puffing at his pipe, and looking there and
there where macalister pointed, he relished the thought of the storm
and the dark night and the fishermen striving there. he liked that men
should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night; pitting muscle and
brain against the waves and the wind; he liked men to work like that,
and women to keep house, and sit beside sleeping children indoors,
while men were drowned, out there in a storm. so james could tell, so
cam could tell (they lo

oked at him, they looked at each other), from
his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice, and the little
tinge of scottish accent which came into his voice, making him seem
like a peasant himself, as he questioned macalister about the eleven
ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm. three had sunk.

he looked proudly where macalister pointed; and cam thought, feeling
proud of him without knowing quite why, had he been there he would have
launched the lifeboat, he would have reached the wreck, cam thought.
he was so brave, he was so adventurous, cam thought. but she
remembered. there was the compact; to resist tyranny to the death.
their grievance weighed them down. they had been forced; they had been
bidden. he had borne them down once more with his gloom and his
authority, making them do his bidding, on this fine morning,

e. she began to think,
how fast it goes. where are we going? and the movement hypnotised her,
while james, with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon, steered
grimly. but he began to think as he steered that he might escape; he
might be quit of it all. they might land somewhere; and be free then.
both of them, looking at each other for a moment, had a sense of escape
and exaltation, what with the speed and the change. but the breeze
bred in mr. ramsay too the same excitement, and, as old macalister
turned to fling his line overboard, he cried out aloud,

"we perished," and then again, "each alone." and then with his usual
spasm of repentance or shyness, pulled himself up, and waved his hand
towards the shore.

"see the little house," he said pointing, wishing cam to look. she
raised herself reluctantly and looked. but which was it? she could no
longer make out, there on the hillside, which was their house. all
looked distant and peaceful and strange. the shore seemed refined, far
away, un

it shocked her--it outraged her. the
movement roused her father; and he shuddered, and broke off,
exclaiming: "look! look!" so urgently that james also turned his head
to look over his shoulder at the island. they all looked. they looked
at the island.

but cam could see nothing. she was thinking how all those paths and
the lawn, thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there, were
gone: were rubbed out; were past; were unreal, and now this was real;
the boat and the sail with its patch; macalister with his earrings; the
noise of the waves--all this was real. thinking this, she was
murmuring to herself, "we perished, each alone," for her father's words
broke and broke again in her mind, when her father, seeing her gazing
so vaguely, began to tease her. didn't she know the points of the
compass? he asked. didn't she know the north from the south? did she
really think they lived right out there? and he pointed again, and
showed her where their house was, there, by those trees. he wished she

ng in his pocket for a book. but she would answer
him; she wished, passionately, to move some obstacle that lay upon her
tongue and to say, oh, yes, frisk. i'll call him frisk. she wanted
even to say, was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone?
but try as she might, she could think of nothing to say like that,
fierce and loyal to the compact, yet passing on to her father,
unsuspected by james, a private token of the love she felt for him.
for she thought, dabbling her hand (and now macalister's boy had caught
a mackerel, and it lay kicking on the floor, with blood on its gills)
for she thought, looking at james who kept his eyes dispassionately on
the sail, or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon, you're
not exposed to it, to this pressure and division of feeling, this
extraordinary temptation. her father was feeling in his pockets; in
another second, he would have found his book. for no one attracted her
more; his hands were beautiful, and his feet, and his voice, and h

words, and his haste, and his temper, and his oddity, and his passion,
and his saying straight out before every one, we perish, each alone,
and his remoteness. (he had opened his book.) but what remained
intolerable, she thought, sitting upright, and watching macalister's
boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish, was that crass
blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and
raised bitter storms, so that even now she woke in the night trembling
with rage and remembered some command of his; some insolence: "do
this," "do that," his dominance: his "submit to me."

so she said nothing, but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore,
wrapped in its mantle of peace; as if the people there had fallen
asleep, she thought; were free like smoke,

known? for one
moment she felt that if they both got up, here, now on the lawn, and
demanded an explanation, why was it so short, why was it so
inexplicable, said it with violence, as two fully equipped human beings
from whom nothing should be hid might speak, then, beauty would roll
itself up; the space would fill; those empty flourishes would form into
shape; if they shouted loud enough mrs. ramsay would return. "mrs.
ramsay!" she said aloud, "mrs. ramsay!" the tears ran down her face.

to bait his hook with. the mutilated body (it was alive still) was
thrown back into the sea.]

"mrs. ramsay!" lily cried, "mrs. ramsay!" but nothing happened. the pain
increased. that anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of
imbecility, she thought! anyhow the old man had not heard her. he
remained benignant, calm--if one chose to think it, sublime. heaven be
praised, no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry, stop pain,

 which james had his eyes fixed until it had become
to him like a person whom he knew, sagged entirely; there they came to
a stop, flapping about waiting for a breeze, in the hot sun, miles from
shore, miles from the lighthouse. everything in the whole world seemed
to stand still. the lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the
distant shore became fixed. the sun grew hotter and everybody seemed
to come very close together and to feel each other's presence, which
they had almost forgotten. macalister's fishing line went plumb down
into the sea. but mr. ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under
him.

he was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover's
egg. now and again, as they hung about in that horrid calm, he turned
a page. and james felt that each page was turned with a peculiar
gesture aimed at him; now assertively, now commandingly; now with the
intention of making people pity him; and all the time, as his father
read and turned one after another of those li

ster, a man at
the head of some enterprise, that he would fight, that he would track
down and stamp out--tyranny, despotism, he called it--making people
do what they did not want to do, cutting off their right to speak. how
could any of them say, but i won't, when he said, come to the
lighthouse. do this. fetch me that. the black wings spread, and the
hard beak tore. and then next moment, there he sat reading his book;
and he might look up--one never knew--quite reasonably. he might talk
to the macalisters. he might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen
old woman's hand in the street, james thought, and he might be shouting
out at some fisherman's sports; he might be waving his arms in the air
with excitement. or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent
from one end of dinner to the other. yes, thought james, while the
boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun; there was a waste of
snow and rock very lonely and austere; and there he had come to feel,
quite often lately, when his

it was a
valley, full of birds, and flowers, and antelopes... she was falling
asleep.

"come now," said mr. ramsay, suddenly shutting his book.

come where? to what extraordinary adventure? she woke with a start.
to land somewhere, to climb somewhere? where was he leading them? for
after his immense silence the words startled them. but it was absurd.
he was hungry, he said. it was time for lunch. besides, look, he
said. "there's the lighthouse. we're almost there."

"he's doing very well," said macalister, praising james. "he's keeping
her very steady."

but his father never praised him, james thought grimly.

mr. ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them.
now he was happy, eating bread and cheese with these fishermen. he
would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour
spitting with the other old men, james thought, watching him slice his
cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife.

this is right, this is it, cam kept feeling, as she peeled her

s, keeping
his eye on me, she thought.

at the same time they were sailing so fast along by the rocks that it
was very exciting--it seemed as if they were doing two things at once;
they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making
for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck. would the water last?
would the provisions last? she asked herself, telling herself a story
but knowing at the same time what was the truth.

they would soon be out of it, mr. ramsay was saying to old macalister;
but their children would see some strange things. macalister said he
was seventy-five last march; mr. ramsay was seventy-one. macalister said
he had never seen a doctor; he had never lost a tooth. and that's the
way i'd like my children to live--cam was sure that her father was
thinking that, for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and
told her, as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived,
that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel. she
should n

ot waste it. he said it so wisely, as if he knew so well all
the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once, and
then he gave her, from his own parcel, a gingerbread nut, as if he were
a great spanish gentleman, she thought, handing a flower to a lady at a
window (so courteous his manner was). he was shabby, and simple,
eating bread and cheese; and yet he was leading them on a great
expedition where, for all she knew, they would be drowned.

"that was where she sunk," said macalister's boy suddenly.

three men were drowned where we are now, the old man said. he had seen
them clinging to the mast himself. and mr. ramsay taking a look at the
spot was about, james and cam were afraid, to burst out:


but i beneath a rougher sea,


and if he did, they could not bear it; they would shriek aloud; they
could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him;
but to their surprise all he said was "ah" as if he thought to himself.
but why make a fuss about that? natural
