downward path, and upward could ascend?
  not less than theirs from jove my lineage came;
  my mother greater, my descent the same."
  so pray'd the trojan prince, and, while he pray'd,
  his hand upon the holy altar laid.

  then thus replied the prophetess divine:
  "o goddess-born of great anchises' line,
  the gates of hell are open night and day;
  smooth the descent, and easy is the way:
  but to return, and view the cheerful skies,
  in this the task and mighty labor lies.
  to few great jupiter imparts this grace,
  and those of shining worth and heav'nly race.
  betwixt those regions and our upper light,
  deep forests and impenetrable night
  possess the middle space: th' infernal bounds
  cocytus, with his sable waves, surrounds.
  but if so dire a love your soul invades,
  as twice below to view the trembling shades;
  if you so hard a toil will undertake,
  as twice to pass th' innavigable lake;
  receive my counsel. in the neighb'ring grove
  there stands a tree; the queen of st

 with eunuchs, in the mother's rites,
  where with unequal sound the flute invites;
  sing, dance, and howl, by turns, in ida's shade:
  resign the war to men, who know the martial trade!"

  this foul reproach ascanius could not hear
  with patience, or a vow'd revenge forbear.
  at the full stretch of both his hands he drew,
  and almost join'd the horns of the tough yew.
  but, first, before the throne of jove he stood,
  and thus with lifted hands invok'd the god:
  "my first attempt, great jupiter, succeed!
  an annual off'ring in thy grove shall bleed;
  a snow-white steer, before thy altar led,
  who, like his mother, bears aloft his head,
  butts with his threat'ning brows, and bellowing stands,
  and dares the fight, and spurns the yellow sands."

  jove bow'd the heav'ns, and lent a gracious ear,
  and thunder'd on the left, amidst the clear.
  sounded at once the bow; and swiftly flies
  the feather'd death, and hisses thro' the skies.
  the steel thro' both his temples forc'd the

then duteous force they use, and phoebus' name,
  to keep from fight the youth too fond of fame.
  undaunted, they themselves no danger shun;
  from wall to wall the shouts and clamors run.
  they bend their bows; they whirl their slings around;
  heaps of spent arrows fall, and strew the ground;
  and helms, and shields, and rattling arms resound.
  the combat thickens, like the storm that flies
  from westward, when the show'ry kids arise;
  or patt'ring hail comes pouring on the main,
  when jupiter descends in harden'd rain,
  or bellowing clouds burst with a stormy sound,
  and with an armed winter strew the ground.

  whom hiera to bold alcanor bare

  like firs that on their mother mountain rise,

  and of their own accord invite the war.

e on either part divides
  our heav'ns, and arms our powers on diff'rent sides?
  a lawful time of war at length will come,
  (nor need your haste anticipate the doom),
  when carthage shall contend the world with rome,
  shall force the rigid rocks and alpine chains,
  and, like a flood, come pouring on the plains.
  then is your time for faction and debate,
  for partial favor, and permitted hate.
  let now your immature dissension cease;
  sit quiet, and compose your souls to peace."

  thus jupiter in few unfolds the charge;
  but lovely venus thus replies at large:
  "o pow'r immense, eternal energy,
  (for to what else protection can we fly?)
  seest thou the proud rutulians, how they dare
  in fields, unpunish'd, and insult my care?
  how lofty turnus vaunts amidst his train,
  in shining arms, triumphant on the plain?
  ev'n in their lines and trenches they contend,
  and scarce their walls the trojan troops defend:
  the town is fill'd with slaughter, and o'erfloats,
