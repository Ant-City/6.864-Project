nd yoshiko was surprised by her selection as doctor,"
father said, "but she was thrilled. and let's see, there was andrei--i
remember that when we were boys he never wanted to do physical
things. he spent all the recreation time he could with his
construction set, and his volunteer hours were always on building
sites. the elders knew that, of course. andrei was given the
assignment of engineer and he was delighted."

"andrei later designed the bridge that crosses the river to the west
of town," jonas's mother said. "it wasn't there when we were
children."

"there are very rarely disappointments, jonas. i don't think you
need to worry about that," his father reassured him. "and if there
are, you know there's an appeal process." but they all laughed at
that--an appeal went to a committee for study.

"i worry a little about asher's assignment," jonas confessed.
"asher's such fun. but he doesn't really have any serious interests.
he makes a game out of everything."

his father chuckled. "you kno

jonas shrugged. it didn't worry him. how could someone not fit in?
the community was so meticulously ordered, the choices so
carefully made.

even the matching of spouses was given such weighty
consideration that sometimes an adult who applied to receive a
spouse waited months or even years before a match was approved

asked lily. she was kneeling beside the crib, making funny faces at
the little one, who was smiling back at her.

jonas's mother rolled her eyes in dismay.



"no," father said, smiling. he ruffled lily's hair. "it's very rare,
anyway, that a newchild's status is as uncertain as gabriel's. it
probably won't happen again, for a long time.

"anyway," he sighed, "they won't make the decision for a while.
right now we're all preparing for a release we'll probably have to
make very soon. there's a birthmother who's expecting twin males
next month."

"oh, dear," mother said, shaking her head. "if they're identical, i
