nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
sorrow were ever razed, and testy wrath
could never be her mild companion.

antiochus, i thank thee, who hath taught
my frail mortality to know itself,
and by those fearful objects to prepare
this body, like to them, to what i must;
for death remember'd should be like a mirror,
who tells us life 's but breath, to trust it error.
i'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;

pericles; and if i do it not, i am sure to be hanged at home:
'tis dangerous.  well, i perceive he was a wise fellow, and
had good discretion, that, being bid to ask what he would of
the king, desired he might know none of his secrets: now do i
see he had some reason for 't; for if a king bid a man be a
villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to be one.
