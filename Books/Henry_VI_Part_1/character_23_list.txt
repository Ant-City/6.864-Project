John  - 
      Talbot's son, John desires to learn the art of war from his father but arrives on the battlefield in Bordeaux at just the wrong moment. Talbot urges him to flee rather than be killed in the ensuing fight, since the English are doomed, but John refuses. He says to flee would disgrace the family name; he stays and fights and dies with his father.
