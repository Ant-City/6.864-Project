him in her doubtful
fashion. and, as she stood over the washing-tub, the mother brooded over
her son. she saw him saddled with an elegant and expensive wife, earning
little money, dragging along and getting draggled in some small, ugly
house in a suburb. â€œbut there,â€ she told herself, â€œi am very likely
a silly--meeting trouble halfway.â€ nevertheless, the load of anxiety
scarcely ever left her heart, lest william should do the wrong thing by
himself.

presently, paul was bidden call upon thomas jordan, manufacturer of
surgical appliances, at 21, spaniel row, nottingham. mrs. morel was all
joy.

â€œthere, you see!â€ she cried, her eyes shining. â€œyouâ€™ve only written four
letters, and the third is answered. youâ€™re lucky, my boy, as i always
said you were.â€

paul looked at the picture of a wooden leg, adorned with elastic
stockings and other appliances, that figured on mr. jordanâ€™s notepaper,
and he felt alarmed. he had not known that elastic stockings existed.
and he seemed to feel t

 water that
lay between high factory walls.

â€œperhaps,â€ she answered, smiling.

they enjoyed the shops immensely.

â€œnow you see that blouse,â€ she would say, â€œwouldnâ€™t that just suit our
annie? and for one-and-eleven-three. isnâ€™t that cheap?â€

â€œand made of needlework as well,â€ he said.

â€œyes.â€

they had plenty of time, so they did not hurry. the town was strange
and delightful to them. but the boy was tied up inside in a knot of
apprehension. he dreaded the interview with thomas jordan.

it was nearly eleven oâ€™clock by st. peterâ€™s church. they turned up a
narrow street that led to the castle. it was gloomy and old-fashioned,
having low dark shops and dark green house doors with brass knockers,
and yellow-ochred doorsteps projecting on to the pavement; then another
old shop whose small window looked like a cunning, half-shut eye. mother
and son went cautiously, looking everywhere for â€œthomas jordan and
sonâ€. it was like hunting in some wild place. they were on tiptoe o

excitement.

suddenly they spied a big, dark archway, in which were names of various
firms, thomas jordan among them.

â€œhere it is!â€ said mrs. morel. â€œbut now where is it?â€

they looked round. on one side was a queer, dark, cardboard factory, on
the other a commercial hotel.

â€œitâ€™s up the entry,â€ said paul.

and they ventured under the archway, as into the jaws of the dragon.
they emerged into a wide yard, like a well, with buildings all round. it
was littered with straw and boxes, and cardboard. the sunshine actually
caught one crate whose straw was streaming on to the yard like gold

. but
elsewhere the place was like a pit. there were several doors, and two
flights of steps. straight in front, on a dirty glass door at the top of
a staircase, loomed the ominous words â€œthomas jordan and son--surgical
appliances.â€ mrs. morel went first, her son followed her. charles i
mounted his scaffold with a lighter heart than had paul morel as he
followed his mother up the dirty steps to the dirty door.

she pushed open the door, and stood in pleased surprise. in front of her
was a big warehouse, with creamy paper parcels everywhere, and clerks,
with their shirt-sleeves rolled back, were going about in an at-home
sort of way. the light was subdued, the glossy cream parcels seemed

full of life beside the white
lace; her large, well-kept hands worked with a balanced movement, as if
nothing would hurry them. he, not knowing, watched her all the time. he
saw the arch of her neck from the shoulder, as she bent her head; he saw
the coil of dun hair; he watched her moving, gleaming arms.

â€œiâ€™ve heard a bit about you from clara,â€ continued the mother. â€œyouâ€™re
in jordanâ€™s, arenâ€™t you?â€ she drew her lace unceasing.

â€œyes.â€

â€œay, well, and i can remember when thomas jordan used to ask me for one
of my toffies.â€

â€œdid he?â€ laughed paul. â€œand did he get it?â€

â€œsometimes he did, sometimes he didnâ€™t--which was latterly. for heâ€™s the
sort that takes all and gives naught, he is--or used to be.â€

â€œi think heâ€™s very decent,â€ said paul.

â€œyes; well, iâ€™m glad to hear it.â€

mrs. radford looked across at him steadily. there was something
determined about her that he liked. her face was falling loose, but her
eyes were calm, and there was somethi

ce-boy appeared,
holding some white article.

â€œfanny says you could have had it last night if youâ€™d let her know,â€ he
said.

â€œall right,â€ answered paul, looking at the stocking. â€œget it off.â€ dawes
stood frustrated, helpless with rage. morel turned round.

â€œexcuse me a minute,â€ he said to dawes, and he would have run
downstairs.

â€œby god, iâ€™ll stop your gallop!â€ shouted the smith, seizing him by the
arm. he turned quickly.

â€œhey! hey!â€ cried the office-boy, alarmed.

thomas jordan started out of his little glass office, and came running
down the room.

â€œwhatâ€™s a-matter, whatâ€™s a-matter?â€ he said, in his old manâ€™s sharp
voice.

â€œiâ€™m just goinâ€™ ter settle this little--, thatâ€™s all,â€ said dawes
desperately.

â€œwhat do you mean?â€ snapped thomas jordan.

â€œwhat i say,â€ said dawes, but he hung fire.

morel was leaning against the counter, ashamed, half-grinning.

â€œwhatâ€™s it all about?â€ snapped thomas jordan.

â€œcouldnâ€™t say,â€ said paul, sha

€ he said. â€œwhoâ€™s tipsy? iâ€™m no more tipsy than you are!â€

â€œweâ€™ve heard that song before,â€ snapped the old man. â€œnow you get off,
and donâ€™t be long about it. cominâ€™ here with your rowdying.â€

the smith looked down contemptuously on his employer. his hands, large,
and grimy, and yet well shaped for his labour, worked restlessly. paul
remembered they were the hands of claraâ€™s husband, and a flash of hate
went through him.

â€œget out before youâ€™re turned out!â€ snapped thomas jordan.

â€œwhy, whoâ€™ll turn me out?â€ said dawes, beginning to sneer.

mr. jordan started, marched up to the smith, waving him off, thrusting
his stout little figure at the man, saying:

â€œget off my premises--get off!â€

he seized and twitched dawesâ€™s arm.

â€œcome off!â€ said the smith, and with a jerk of the elbow he sent the
little manufacturer staggering backwards.

before anyone could help him, thomas jordan had collided with the flimsy
spring-door. it had given way, and let him crash d

steps into fannyâ€™s room. there was a second of amazement; then men and
girls were running. dawes stood a moment looking bitterly on the scene,
then he took his departure.

thomas jordan was shaken and braised, not otherwise hurt. he was,
however, beside himself with rage. he dismissed dawes from his
employment, and summoned him for assault.

at the trial paul morel had to give evidence. asked how the trouble
began, he said:

â€œdawes took occasion to insult mrs. dawes and me because i accompanied
her to the theatre one evening; then i threw some beer at him, and he
wanted his revenge.â€

â€œ_cherchez la femme!_â€ smiled the magistrate.

the case was dismissed after the magis

?â€

â€œi know nobody nowhere,â€ said dawes.

â€œwell,â€ said paul, â€œitâ€™s because you donâ€™t choose to, then.â€

there was another silence.

â€œwe sâ€™ll be taking my mother home as soon as we can,â€ said paul.

â€œwhatâ€™s a-matter with her?â€ asked dawes, with a sick manâ€™s interest in
illness.

â€œsheâ€™s got a cancer.â€

there was another silence.

â€œbut we want to get her home,â€ said paul. â€œwe sâ€™ll have to get a
motor-car.â€

dawes lay thinking.

â€œwhy donâ€™t you ask thomas jordan to lend you his?â€ said dawes.

â€œitâ€™s not big enough,â€ morel answered.

dawes blinked his dark eyes as he lay thinking.

â€œthen ask jack pilkington; heâ€™d lend it you. you know him.â€

â€œi think i sâ€™ll hire one,â€ said paul.

â€œyouâ€™re a fool if you do,â€ said dawes.

the sick man was gaunt and handsome again. paul was sorry for him
because his eyes looked so tired.

â€œdid you get a job here?â€ he asked.

â€œi was only here a day or two before i was taken bad,â€ dawes replie
