[CHARACTER] - 
one of quannopin's three wives. [CHARACTER] is proud and vain,
concerned primarily with wealth, status, and her own appearance. she is
generally unkind to rowlandson, and only when rowlandson's freedom approaches
does she begin treating her better, possibly because she wants some of the
ransom money the settlers will offer. [CHARACTER] serves as a foil to rowlandson:
her negative qualities contrast strongly with rowlandson's positive
characteristics.
