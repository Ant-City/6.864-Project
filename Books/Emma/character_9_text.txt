they met mr. martin the very next day, as they were walking on the donwell road. he was on foot, and after looking very respectfully at her, looked with most unfeigned satisfaction at her companion. emma was not sorry to have such an opportunity of survey; and walking a few yards forward, while they talked together, soon made her quick eye sufficiently acquainted with mr. robert martin. his appearance was very neat, and he looked like a sensible young man, but his person had no other advantage; and when he came to be contrasted with gentlemen, she thought he must lose all the ground he had gained in harriet’s inclination. harriet was not insensible of manner; she had voluntarily noticed her father’s gentleness with admiration as well as wonder. mr. martin looked as if he did not know what manner was.
they remained but a few minutes together, as miss woodhouse must not be

uent meetings at hartfield, was foundation enough on his side; and on harriet’s there could be little doubt that the idea of being preferred by him would have all the usual weight and efficacy. and he was really a very pleasing young man, a young man whom any woman not fastidious might like. he was reckoned very handsome; his person much admired in general, though not by her, there being a want of elegance of feature which she could not dispense with:—but the girl who could be gratified by a robert martin’s riding about the country to get walnuts for her might very well be conquered by mr. elton’s admiration.




chapter v

“i do not know what your opinion may be, mrs. weston,” said mr. knightley, “of this great intimacy between emma and harriet smith, but i think it a bad thing.”
“a bad thing! do you really think it a bad thing?—why so?”
“i think they will neither of them do the other any good.”
“you surprize me! emma must do harriet good: and by supplying her with a new

hat you ought. while you were at all in suspense i kept my feelings to myself, but now that you are so completely decided i have no hesitation in approving. dear harriet, i give myself joy of this. it would have grieved me to lose your acquaintance, which must have been the consequence of your marrying mr. martin. while you were in the smallest degree wavering, i said nothing about it, because i would not influence; but it would have been the loss of a friend to me. i could not have visited mrs. robert martin, of abbey-mill farm. now i am secure of you for ever.”
harriet had not surmised her own danger, but the idea of it struck her forcibly.
“you could not have visited me!” she cried, looking aghast. “no, to be sure you could not; but i never thought of that before. that would have been too dreadful!—what an escape!—dear miss woodhouse, i would not give up the pleasure and honour of being intimate with you for any thing in the world.”

“then she is a greater simpleton than i ever believed her. what is the foolish girl about?”
“oh! to be sure,” cried emma, “it is always incomprehensible to a man that a woman should ever refuse an offer of marriage. a man always imagines a woman to be ready for any body who asks her.”
“nonsense! a man does not imagine any such thing. but what is the meaning of this? harriet smith refuse robert martin? madness, if it is so; but i hope you are mistaken.”
“i saw her answer!—nothing could be clearer.”
“you saw her answer!—you wrote her answer too. emma, this is your doing. you persuaded her to refuse him.”
“and if i did, (which, however, i am far from allowing) i should not feel that i had done wrong. mr. martin is a very respectable young man, but i cannot admit him to be harriet’s equal; and am rather surprized indeed that he should have ventured to address her. by your acco

unt, he does seem to have had some scruples. it is a pity that they were ever got over.”
“not harriet’s equal!” exclaimed mr. knightley loudly and warmly; and with calmer asperity, added, a few moments afterwards, “no, he is not her equal indeed, for he is as much her superior in sense as in situation. emma, your infatuation about that girl blinds you. what are harriet smith’s claims, either of birth, nature or education, to any connexion higher than robert martin? she is the natural daughter of nobody knows whom, with probably no settled provision at all, and certainly no respectable relations. she is known only as parlour-boarder at a common school. she is not a sensible girl, nor a girl of any information. she has been taught nothing useful, and is too young and too simple to have acquired any thing herself. at her age she can have no experience, and with her little wit, is not very likely ever to have any that can avail her. she is pretty, and she is

will not hold in common sense. she is not to pay for the offence of others, by being held below the level of those with whom she is brought up.—there can scarcely be a doubt that her father is a gentleman—and a gentleman of fortune.—her allowance is very liberal; nothing has ever been grudged for her improvement or comfort.—that she is a gentleman’s daughter, is indubitable to me; that she associates with gentlemen’s daughters, no one, i apprehend, will deny.—she is superior to mr. robert martin.”
“whoever might be her parents,” said mr. knightley, “whoever may have had the charge of her, it does not appear to have been any part of their plan to introduce her into what you would call good society. after receiving a very indifferent education she is left in mrs. goddard’s hands to shift as she can;—to move, in short, in mrs. goddard’s line, to have mrs. goddard’s acquaintance. her friends evidently thought this good enough for her; and it was good enough. she desired not

it was most convenient to emma not to make a direct reply to this assertion; she chose rather to take up her own line of the subject again.
“you are a very warm friend to mr. martin; but,

ing so easy as for a young lady to raise her expectations too high. miss harriet smith may not find offers of marriage flow in so fast, though she is a very pretty girl. men of sense, whatever you may chuse to say, do not want silly wives. men of family would not be very fond of connecting themselves with a girl of such obscurity—and most prudent men would be afraid of the inconvenience and disgrace they might be involved in, when the mystery of her parentage came to be revealed. let her marry robert martin, and she is safe, respectable, and happy for ever; but if you encourage her to expect to marry greatly, and teach her to be satisfied with nothing less than a man of consequence and large fortune, she may be a parlour-boarder at mrs. goddard’s all the rest of her life—or, at least, (for harriet smith is a girl who will marry somebody or other,) till she grow desperate, and is glad to catch at the old writing-master’s son.”

could she but have given harriet her feelings about it all! she had talked her into love; but, alas! she was not so easily to be talked out of it. the charm of an object to occupy the many vacancies of harriet’s mind was not to be talked away. he might be superseded by another; he certainly would indeed; nothing could be clearer; even a robert martin would have been sufficient; but nothing else, she feared, would cure her. harriet was one of those, who, having once begun, would be always in love. and now, poor girl! she was considerably worse from this reappearance of mr. elton. she was always having a glimpse of him somewhere or other. emma saw him only once; but two or three times every day harriet was sure just to meet with him, or just to miss him, just to hear his voice, or see his shoulder, just to have something occur to preserve him

her cheeks flushed at the name, and she felt afraid of something, though she knew not what.
“have you heard from her yourself this morning?” cried he. “you have, i believe, and know the whole.”
“no, i have not; i know nothing; pray tell me.”
“you are prepared for the worst, i see—and very bad it is. harriet smith marries robert martin.”
emma gave a start, which did not seem like being prepared—and her eyes, in eager gaze, said, “no, this is impossible!” but her lips were closed.
“it is so, indeed,” continued mr. knightley; “i have it from robert martin himself. he left me not half an hour ago.”
she was still looking at him with the most speaking amazement.

“you mistake me, you quite mistake me,” she replied, exerting herself. “it is not that such a circumstance would now make me unhappy, but i cannot believe it. it seems an impossibility!—you cannot mean to say, that harriet smith has accepted robert martin. you cannot mean that he has even proposed to her again—yet. you only mean, that he intends it.”
“i mean that he has done it,” answered mr. knightley, with smiling but determined decision, “and been accepted.”
“good god!” she cried.—“well!”—then having recourse to her workbasket, in excuse for leaning down her face, and concealing all the exquisite feelings of delight and entertainment which she knew she must be expressing, she added, “well, now tell me every thing; ma

he wanted her to look up and smile; and having now brought herself not to smile too broadly—she did—cheerfully answering,
“you need not be at any pains to reconcile me to the match. i think harriet is doing extremely well. her connexions may be worse than his. in respectability of character, there can be no doubt that they are. i have been silent from surprize merely, excessive surprize. you cannot imagine how suddenly it has come on me! how peculiarly unprepared i was!—for i had re

r. knightley, are you perfectly sure that she has absolutely and downright accepted him. i could suppose she might in time—but can she already?—did not you misunderstand him?—you were both talking of other things; of business, shows of cattle, or new drills—and might not you, in the confusion of so many subjects, mistake him?—it was not harriet’s hand that he was certain of—it was the dimensions of some famous ox.”
the contrast between the countenance and air of mr. knightley and robert martin was, at this moment, so strong to emma’s feelings, and so strong was the recollection of all that had so recently passed on harriet’s side, so fresh the sound of those words, spoken with such emphasis, “no, i hope i know better than to think of robert martin,” that she was really expecting the intelligence to prove, in some measure, premature. it could not be otherwise.
“do you dare say this?” cried mr. knightley. “do you dare to suppose me so great a blockhead, as not to know wha

rs. goddard? i assured him that i could not. then, he said, he would endeavour to see her in the course of this day.”
“i am perfectly satisfied,” replied emma, with the brightest smiles, “and most sincerely wish them happy.”
“you are materially changed since we talked on this subject before.”
“i hope so—for at that time i was a fool.”
“and i am changed also; for i am now very willing to grant you all harriet’s good qualities. i have taken some pains for your sake, and for robert martin’s sake, (whom i have always had reason to believe as much in love with her as ever,) to get acquainted with her. i have often talked to her a good deal. you must have seen that i did. sometimes, indeed, i have thought you were half suspecting me of pleading poor martin’s cause, which was never the case; but, from all my observations, i am convinced of her being an artless, amiable girl, with very good notions, very seriously good principles, and placing her happiness in the affections and u

serious she was, very serious in her thankfulness, and in her resolutions; and yet there was no preventing a laugh, sometimes in the very midst of them. she must laugh at such a close! such an end of the doleful disappointment of five weeks back! such a heart—such a harriet!
now there would be pleasure in her returning—every thing would be a pleasure. it would be a great pleasure to know robert martin.
high in the rank of her most serious and heartfelt felicities, was the reflection that all necessity of concealment from mr. knightley would soon be over. the disguise, equivocation, mystery, so hateful to her to practise, might soon be over. she could now look forward to giving him that full and perfect confidence which her disposition was most ready to welcome as a duty.

had still, at intervals, an anxious feeling for harriet, a momentary doubt of its being possible for her to be really cured of her attachment to mr. knightley, and really able to accept another man from unbiased inclination, it was not long that she had to suffer from the recurrence of any such uncertainty. a very few days brought the party from london, and she had no sooner an opportunity of being one hour alone with harriet, than she became perfectly satisfied—unaccountable as it was!—that robert martin had thoroughly supplanted mr. knightley, and was now forming all her views of happiness.
harriet was a little distressed—did look a little foolish at first: but having once owned that she had been presumptuous and silly, and self-deceived, before, her pain and confusion seemed to die away with the words, and leave her without a care for the past, and with the fullest exultation in the present and future; for, as to her friend’s approbation, emma had instantly removed every fear of that natu

re, by meeting her with the most unqualified congratulations.—harriet was most happy to give every particular of the evening at astley’s, and the dinner the next day; she could dwell on it all with the utmost delight. but what did such particulars explain?—the fact was, as emma could now acknowledge, that harriet had always liked robert martin; and that his continuing to love her had been irresistible.—beyond this, it must ever be unintelligible to emma.
the event, however, was most joyful; and every day was giving her fresh reason for thinking so.—harriet’s parentage became known. she proved to be the daughter of a tradesman, rich enough to afford her the comfortable maintenance which had ever been hers, and decent enough to have always wished for concealment.—such was the blood of gentility which emma had formerly been so r

eady to vouch for!—it was likely to be as untainted, perhaps, as the blood of many a gentleman: but what a connexion had she been preparing for mr. knightley—or for the churchills—or even for mr. elton!—the stain of illegitimacy, unbleached by nobility or wealth, would have been a stain indeed.
no objection was raised on the father’s side; the young man was treated liberally; it was all as it should be: and as emma became acquainted with robert martin, who was now introduced at hartfield, she fully acknowledged in him all the appearance of sense and worth which could bid fairest for her little friend. she had no doubt of harriet’s happiness with any good-tempered man; but with him, and in the home he offered, there would be the hope of more, of security, stability, and improvement. she would be placed in the midst of those who loved her, and who had better sense than herself; retired enough for safety, and occupied enough for cheerfulness.

 if not quite the luckiest, to yield only to herself.
harriet, necessarily drawn away by her engagements with the martins, was less and less at hartfield; which was not to be regretted.—the intimacy between her and emma must sink; their friendship must change into a calmer sort of goodwill; and, fortunately, what ought to be, and must be, seemed already beginning, and in the most gradual, natural manner.
before the end of september, emma attended harriet to church, and saw her hand bestowed on robert martin with so complete a satisfaction, as no remembrances, even connected with mr. elton as he stood before them, could impair.—perhaps, indeed, at that time she scarcely saw mr. elton, but as the clergyman whose blessing at the altar might next fall on herself.—robert martin and harriet smith, the latest couple engaged of the three, were the first to be married.

ion, and presence of mind of the mr. knightleys, commanded his fullest dependence. while either of them protected him and his, hartfield was safe.—but mr. john knightley must be in london again by the end of the first week in november.
the result of this distress was, that, with a much more voluntary, cheerful consent than his daughter had ever presumed to hope for at the moment, she was able to fix her wedding-day—and mr. elton was called on, within a month from the marriage of mr. and mrs. robert martin, to join the hands of mr. knightley and miss woodhouse.
the wedding was very much like other weddings, where the parties have no taste for finery or parade; and mrs. elton, from the particulars detailed by her husband, thought it all extremely shabby, and very inferior to her own.—“very little white satin, very few lace veils; a most pitiful business!—selina would stare when she heard of it.”—but, in spite of these deficiencies, the wishes, the hopes, the confidence, the predictions o
