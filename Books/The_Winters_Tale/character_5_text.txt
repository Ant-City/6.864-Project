archidamus.
if you shall chance, camillo, to visit bohemia, on the
like occasion whereon my services are now on foot, you shall see,
as i have said, great difference betwixt our bohemia and your
sicilia.

camillo.
i think this coming summer the king of sicilia means to
pay bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.

archidamus.
wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
justified in our loves; for indeed,--

camillo.

archidamus.
believe me, i speak as my understanding instructs me
and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.

camillo.
sicilia cannot show himself overkind to bohemia. they were
trained together in their childhoods; and there rooted betwixt
them then such an affection which cannot choose but branch now.
since their more mature dignities and royal necessities made
separation of their society, their encounters, though not
personal, have been royally attorneyed with interchange of gifts,
letters, loving embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
though absent; shook hands, as over a vast; and embrac

loves!

archidamus.
i think there is not in the world either malice or matter to
alter it. you have an unspeakable comfort of your young prince
mamillius: it is a gentleman of the greatest promise that ever
came into my note.

camillo.
i very well agree with you in the hopes of him. it is a
gallant child; one that indeed physics the subject, makes old
hearts fresh: they that went on crutches ere he was born desire
yet their life to see him a man.

archidamus.
would they else be content to die?

camillo.
yes, if there were no other excuse why they should desire to
live.

archidamus.
if the king had no son, they would desire to live on crutches
till he had one.

the shepherd's note since we have left our throne

would be fill'd up, my brother, with our thanks;
and yet we should, for perpetuity,
go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
yet standing in rich place, i multiply
with one we-thank-you many thousands more

and pay them when you part.

it is a bawdy planet, that will strike

mamillius.
i am like you, they say.

leontes.
                         why, that's some comfort.--

camillo.

leontes.

camillo.

when you cast out, it still came home.

leontes.
                        didst note it?

camillo.
he would not stay at your petitions; made
his business more material.

leontes.
at the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent;
but so it is, it is not. was this taken
by any understanding pate but thine?
for thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
more than the common blocks:--not noted, is't,
but of the finer natures? by some severals
of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
perchance are to this business purblind? say.

leontes.
ay, but why?

camillo.
to satisfy your highness, and the entreaties
of our most gracious mistress.

leontes.
                               satisfy
th' entreaties of your mistress!--satisfy!--
let that suffice. i have trusted thee, camillo,
with all the nearest things to my heart, as well
my chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
hast cleans'd my bosom; i from thee departed
thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
deceiv'd in thy integrity, deceiv'd

camillo.
                            my gracious lord,
i may be negligent, foolish, and fearful;
in every one of these no man is free,
but that his negligence, his folly, fear,
among the infinite doings of the world,
sometime puts forth: in your affairs, my lord,
if ever i were wilful-negligent,
it was my folly; if industriously
i play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
to do a thing, where i the issue doubted,
whereof the execution did cry out

inst the non-performance, 'twas a fear
which oft affects the wisest: these, my lord,
are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
is never free of. but, beseech your grace,
be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
by its own visage: if i then deny it,
'tis none of mine.

leontes.
                   have not you seen, camillo,--
but that's past doubt: you have, or your eye-glass
is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
for, to a vision so apparent, rumour
cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
resides not in that man that does not think it,--
my wife is slippery? if thou wilt confess,--
or else be impudently negative,
to have nor eyes nor ears nor thought,--then say
my wife's a hobby-horse; deserves a name
as rank as any flax-wench that puts to
before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.

i would not be a stander-by to hear
my sovereign mistress clouded so, without
my present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,

as deep as that, though true.

leontes.
                     is whispering nothing?

the covering sky is nothing; bohemia nothing;

inclining to them both.--were my wife's liver

about his neck, bohemia: who--if i

which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,

maliciously like poison: but i cannot
believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
so sovereignly being honourable.

camillo.
                     i must believe you, sir:
i do; and will fetch off bohemia for't;
provided that, when he's remov'd, your highness
will take again your queen as yours at first,
even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
the injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
known and allied to yours.

leontes.
                           thou dost advise me
even so as i mine own course have set down:
i'll give no blemish to her honour, none.

camillo.
o miserable lady!--but, for me,
what case stand i in? i must be the poisoner
of good polixenes: and my ground to do't
is the obedience to a master; one
who, in rebellion with himself, will have
all that are his so too.--to do this deed,
promotion follows: if i could find example
of thousands that had struck anointed kings
and flourish'd after, i'd not do't; but since
nor brass, nor stone, nor parchment, bears not one,
let villainy itself forswear't. i must

the nothing of it. so that, in this time of lethargy, i picked
and cut most of their festival purses; and had not the old man
come in with whoobub against his daughter and the king's son, and

camillo, sir; i spake with him; who now
has these poor men in question. never saw i
wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
forswear themselves as often as they speak:
bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
with divers deaths in death.

i was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old shepherd
deliver the manner how he found it: whereupon, after a little
amazedness, we were all commanded out of the chamber; only this,

i make a broken delivery of the business; but the changes i
perceived in the king and camillo were very notes of admiration.
they seem'd almost, with staring on one another, to tear the
cases of their eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard of a world
ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable passion of wonder appeared
in them; but the wisest beholder, that knew no more but seeing
could not say if the importance were joy or sorrow;--but in the
extremity of the one, it must needs be. here comes a gentleman

but how, is to be question'd: for i saw her,
as i thought, dead; and have, in vain, said many
