 and hazel and fiver had spent
the greater part of their last evening in the warren in persuading him to join
them. pipkin had agreed rather hesitantly. he still felt extremely nervous about
what might happen once they left the warren, and had decided that the best way
to avoid trouble would be to keep close to hazel and do exactly what he said.
     the three were still in the ditch when hazel heard a movement above. he
looked up quickly.
     "who's there?" he said. "dandelion?"
     "no, i'm hawkbit," said the rabbit who was peering over the edge. he jumped
down among them, landing rather heavily. "do you remember me, hazel? we

were in the same burrow during the snow last winter. dandelion told me you
were going to leave the warren tonight. if you are, i'll come with you."
     hazel could recall hawkbit -- a rather slow, stupid rabbit whose company for
five snowbound days underground had been distinctly tedious. still, he thought,
this was no time to pick and choose. although bigwig mig

over one or two, most of the rabbits they could expect to join them would not
come from the owsla. they would be outskirters who were getting a thin time
and wondering what to do about it. he was running over some of these in his
mind when dandelion appeared.
     "the sooner we're off the better, i reckon," said dandelion. "i don't much like
the look of things. after i'd persuaded hawkbit here to join us, i was just starting
to talk to a few more, when i found that toadflax fellow had followed me down
the run. 'i want to know what you're up to,' he said, and i don't think he believed
me when i told him i was only trying to find out whether there were any rabbits
who wanted to leave the warren. he asked me if i was sure i wasn't working up
some kind of plot against the threarah and he got awfully angry and suspicious.

     "i don't blame you," said hazel. "knowing toadflax, i'm surprised he didn't

longer. blackberry ought to be here soon."

northward in the grass. at last, just as hazel was about to run down the slope to
blackberry's burrow, he saw him come out of his hole, followed by no less than
three rabbits. one of these, b

to cross it for? i never heard such nonsense."
     like all wild animals, rabbits can swim if they have to; and some even swim
when it suits them. rabbits have been known to live on the edge of a wood and
regularly swim a brook to feed in the fields beyond. but most rabbits avoid
swimming, and certainly an exhausted rabbit could not swim the enborne.
     "i don't want to jump in there," said speedwell.
     "why not just go along the bank?" asked hawkbit.
     hazel suspected that if fiver felt they ought to cross the river, it might be
dangerous not to. but how were the others to be persuaded? at this moment, as
he was still wondering what to say to them, he suddenly realized that something
had lightened his spirits. what could it be? a smell? a sound? then he knew.
nearby, across the river, a lark had begun to twitter and climb. it was morning. a
blackbird called one or two deep, slow notes and was followed by a wood pigeon.

     "you've got a big thorn in there, hlao," he said. "no wonder you couldn't run.
we'll have to get it out."
     getting the thorn out was not easy, for the foot had become so tender that
pipkin winced and pulled away even from hazel's tongue. but after a good deal of
patient effort hazel succeeded in working out enough of the stump to get a grip
with his teeth. the thorn came out smoothly and the wound bled. the spine was
so long and thick that hawkbit, who happened to be close by, woke speedwell to
have a look at it.
     "frith above, pipkin!" said speedwell, sniffing at the thorn where it lay on a
pebble. "you'd better collect a few more like that: then you can make a notice
board and frighten fiver. you might have poked the lendri's eye out for us, if
you'd only known."
     "lick the place, hlao," said hazel. "lick it until it feels better and then go to
sleep."

azel realized more fully than ever how
dangerous was their position, without holes, wandering in country they did not
know. the lendri, the dog, the crow, the marksman -- they had been lucky to
escape them. how long would their luck hold? would they really be able to travel
on as far as fiver's high place -- wherever it might be?
     "i'd settle for any decent, dry bank, myself," he thought, "as long as there was
some grass and no men with guns. and the sooner we can find one the better."
     hawkbit was the last to return and as he came up hazel set off at once. he
looked cautiously out from among the beans and then darted into the hedgerow.
the wind, as he stopped to sniff it, was reassuring, carrying only the scents of
evening dew, may and cow dung. he led the way into the next field, a pasture, and
here they all fell to feeding, nibbling their way over the grass as easily as though
their warren were close by.
     when he was halfway across the field, hazel became aware of a hrududu

across the open common. a cock crowed. a dog ran barking and a man
shouted at it. a little owl called "kee-wik, kee-wik" and something -- a vole or a
shrew -- gave a sudden squeal. there was not a noise but seemed to tell of danger.
     late in the night, toward moonset, hazel was looking up from a cut where they
were crouching to a little bank above. as he was wondering whether to climb up
to it, to see whether he could get a clear view ahead, he heard a movement behind
him and turned to find hawkbit at his shoulder. there was something furtive and
hesitant about him and hazel glanced at him sharply, wondering for a moment
whether he could have sickness or poison on him. "er -- hazel," said hawkbit,
looking past him into the face of the dreary black cliff. "i -- er -- that is to say we
-- er -- feel that we -- well, that we can't go on like this. we've had enough of it."
     he stopped. hazel now saw that speedwell and acorn were behind him,
listening expectantly. there was a pause.

     "more than enough," said hawkbit, with a kind of foolish importance.
     "well, so have i," answered hazel, "and i hope there won't be much more.
then we can all have a rest."
     "we want to stop now," said speedwell. "we think it was stupid to come so
far."
     "it gets worse and worse the further we go," said acorn. "where are we going
and how long will it be before some of us stop running for good and all?"
     "it's the place that worries you," said hazel. "i don't like it myself, but it won't
go on forever."

     "you were there and blackberry brought you there. do you think they won't

remember that? besides--"
     hazel stopped as fiver approached, followed by bigwig.
     "hazel," said fiver, "could you come up on the bank with me for a few
moments? it's important."
     "and while you're there," said bigwig, scowling round at the others from under
the great sheaf of fur on his head, "i'll just have a few words with these three.
why don't you get washed, hawkbit? you look like the end of a rat's tail left in a
trap. and as for you, speedwell--"
     hazel did not wait to hear what speedwell looked like. following fiver, he
scrambled up the lumps and shelves of peat to the overhang of gravelly earth and
thin grass that topped them. as soon as fiver had found a place to clamber out,
he led the way along the edge to the bank which hazel had been looking at before
hawkbit spoke to him. it stood a few feet above the nodding, windy heather and
was open and g

     when hazel and fiver reached the floor of the hollow they found blackberry
wailing for them, crouching on the peat and nibbling at a few brown stalks of
sedge grass.
     "hello," said hazel. "what's happened? where are the others?"
     "over there," answered blackberry. "there's been a fearful row. bigwig told
hawkbit and speedwell that he'd scratch them to pieces if they didn't obey him.
and when hawkbit said he wanted to know who was chief rabbit, bigwig bit
him. it seems a nasty business. who is chief rabbit, anyway -- you or bigwig?"
     "i don't know," answered hazel, "but bigwig's certainly the strongest. there
was no need to go biting hawkbit: he couldn't have gone back if he'd tried. he
and his friends would have seen that if they'd been allowed to talk for a bit. now
bigwig's put their backs up, an

there are too few of us for giving orders and biting people. frith in a fog! isn't
there enough trouble and danger already?"
     they went over to the far end of the pit. bigwig and silver were talking with
buckthorn under an overhanging broom. nearby, pipkin and dandelion were
pretending to feed on a patch of scrub. some way away, acorn was making a great

business of licking hawkbit's throat, while speedwell watched.
     "keep still if you can, poor old chap," said acorn, who obviously wanted to be
overheard. "just let me clean the blood out. steady, now!" hawkbit winced in an
exaggerated manner and backed away. as hazel came up, all the rabbits turned
and stared at him expectantly.
     "look," said hazel, "i know there's been some trouble, but the best thing will
be to try to forget it. this is a bad place, but we'll soon get out of it."
     "do you really think we wil

     hazel did not know what to reply. he looked at them in silence and it was
acorn who spoke next.
     "come on!" he said. "who's going to be first into that field? i can still run." he
was off, slowly enough, down the slope, but when hazel stamped for him to stop
he did so at once.
     "where are the others?" said hazel. "dandelion? bigwig?"
     at that moment dandelion appeared out of the heather and sat on the path,
looking at the field. he was followed first by hawkbit and then by fiver. hazel
was watching fiver as he took in the sight of the field, when buckthorn drew his
attention back to the foot of the slope.
     "look, hazel," he said, "silver and bigwig are down there. they're waiting for
us."
     silver's light-gray fur showed up plainly against a low spray of gorse, but hazel
could not see bigwig until he sat up and ran toward them.
     "splendid, hazel," he said. "everybody's here. let's get them into that field."

warm wind. hopelessness and reluctance are blown away like a fog and the dumb
solitude where they crept, a place desolate as a crack in the ground, opens like a
rose and stretches to the hills and the sky.
     the tired rabbits fed and basked in the sunny meadow as though they had
come no further than from the bank at the edge of the nearby copse. the heather
and the stumbling darkness were forgotten as though the sunrise had melted
them. bigwig and hawkbit chased each other through the long grass. speedwell
jumped over the little brook that ran down the middle of the field and when
acorn tried to follow him and fell short, silver joked with him as he scrambled
out and rolled him in a patch of dead oak leaves until he was dry. as the sun rose
higher, shortening the shadows and drawing the dew from the grass, most of the
rabbits came wandering back to the sun-flecked shade among the cow parsley
along the edge of the ditch. here, hazel and fiver wer

bigwig, cheerful at the prospect of action. the steady, reliable silver. dandelion,
the dashing storyteller, so eager to be off that he jumped the ditch and ran a little
way into the field before stopping to wait for the rest. buckthorn, perhaps the
most sensible and staunch of them all. pipkin, who looked round for hazel and
then came over to wait beside him. acorn, hawkbit and speedwell, decent
enough rank-and-filers as long as they were not pushed beyond their limits. last
of all came fiver, dejected and reluctant as a sparrow in the frost. as hazel turned
from the hole, the clouds in the west broke slightly and there was a sudden dazzle
of watery, pale gold light.
     "o el-ahrairah!" thought hazel. "these are rabbits we're going to meet. you
know them as well as you know us. let it be the right thing that i'm doing."
     "now, brace up, fiver!" he said aloud

e interrupted him. there seemed
to be plenty for all. from time to time, instinctively, he looked up and sniffed the
wind, but his caution was half-hearted. "if elil come, let them," he thought. "i'll
fight the lot. i couldn't run, anyway. what a country! what a warren! no wonder
they're all as big as hares and smell like princes!" "hello, pipkin! fill yourself up
to the ears! no more shivering on the banks of streams for you, old chap!"
     "he won't know how to shiver in a week or two," said hawkbit, with his mouth
full. "i feel so much better for this! i'd follow you anywhere, hazel. i wasn't
myself in the heather that night. it's bad when you know you can't get
underground. i hope you understand."
     "it's all forgotten," answered hazel. "i'd better ask cowslip what we're
supposed to do about taking some of this stuff back to the warren."
     he found cowslip near the spring. he had evidently finished feeding and was
washing his face with his front paws.

     "i'm the one who ought to get angry," said fiver. "but i'm no good at it, that's
the trouble. why should they listen to me? half of them think i'm mad. you're to
blame, hazel, because you know i'm not and still you won't listen."

     "well, i'd say they've copied a good idea from the squirrels and that makes
them better rabbits."
     "do you suppose the man, whoever he is, puts the roots out there because he
has a kind heart? what's he up to?"

     "bigwig just spoke," he said to him, "but i don't think he can now. he said, 'dig
out the peg.' what does that mean? what have we got to do?"
     "wait a moment," said blackberry. "let me think, and try not to be impatient."
     hazel turned his head and looked down the course of the brook. far away,
between the two copses, he could see the cherry tree where two days before he
had sat with blackberry and fiver in the sunrise. he remembered how bigwig had
chased hawkbit through the long grass, forgetting the quarrel of the previous
night in the joy of their arrival. he could see hawkbit running toward him now
and two or three of the others -- silver, dandelion and pipkin. dandelion, well in
front, dashed up to the gap and checked, twitching and staring.
     "what is it, hazel? what's happened? fiver said--"
     "bigwig's in a wire. let him alone till blackberry tells us. stop the others

have to hope for the best until i get back. you can rest and feed, anyway."
     "you're not going alone," said fiver firmly.
     since each one of them was ready to go with him in spite of their fatigue, hazel
gave in and chose dandelion and hawkbit, who seemed less weary than the
others. they set out up the hillside, going slowly, picking their way from one bush
and tussock to another and pausing continually to sniff and stare along the great
expanse of grass, which stretched on either side as far as they could see.

grows intense enough they can become
glazed and paralyzed by it -- "tharn," to use their own word. hazel and his
companions had been on the jump for nearly two days. indeed, ever since they
had left their home warren, five days before, they had faced one danger after
another. they were all on edge, sometimes starting at nothing and, again, lying
down in any patch of long grass that offered. bigwig and buckthorn smelled of
blood and everyone else knew they did. what bothered hazel, dandelion and
hawkbit was the openness and strangeness of the down and their inability to see
very far ahead. they climbed not over but through the sun-red grass, among the
awakened insect movement and the light ablaze. the grass undulated about
them. they peered over anthills and looked cautiously round clumps of teazle.

     the wind ruffled their fur and tugged at the grass, which smelled of thyme and
self-heal. the solitude seemed like a release and a blessing. the height, the sky
and the distance went to their heads and they skipped in the sunset. "o frith on
the hills!" cried dandelion. "he must have made it for us!"
     "he may have made it, but fiver thought of it for us," answered hazel. "wait
till we get him up here! fiver-rah!"
     "where's hawkbit?" said dandelion suddenly.
     although the light was still clear, hawkbit was not to be seen anywhere on the
upland. after staring about for some time, they ran across to a little mound some
way away and looked again. but they saw nothing except a field mouse, which
came out of its hole and began furricking in a path of seeded grasses.
     "he must have gone down," said dandelion.
     "well, whether he has or not," said hazel, "we can't go on looking for him. the
others are waiting and they

     they made for the steep edge. the light was beginning to fail. they picked their
direction by a clump of stunted trees which they had passed on their way up.
these formed a kind of dry oasis -- a little feature common on the downs. half a
dozen thorns and two or three elders grew together above and below a bank.
between them the ground was bare and the naked chalk showed a pallid, dirty
white under the cream-colored elder bloom. as they approached, they suddenly
saw hawkbit sitting among the thorn trunks, cleaning his face with his paws.
     "we've been looking for you," said hazel. "where in the world have you been?"
     "i'm sorry, hazel," replied hawkbit meekly. "i've been looking at these holes. i
thought they might be some good to us."
     in the low bank behind him were three rabbit holes. there were two more flat
on the ground, between the thick, gnarled roots. they could see no footmarks and
no droppings. the holes were clearly deserted.
     "have you

been down?" asked hazel, sniffing round.
     "yes, i have," said hawkbit. "three of them, anyway. they're shallow and
rather rough, but there's no smell of death or disease and they're perfectly sound.
i thought they might do for us -- just for the moment, anyway."
     in the twilight a swift flew screaming overhead and hazel turned to dandelion.
     "news! news!" he said. "go and get them up here."
     thus it fell to one of the rank and file to make a lucky find that brought them at
last to the downs: and probably saved a life or two, for they could hardly have

    as the rabbits came up by the hole inside the beech wood, a swift gust of wind

passed through the leaves, checkering and dappling the ground beneath, stealing
and giving light under the branches. they listened, but beyond the rustle of the
leaves there came from the open down outside no sound except the monotonous
tremolo of a grasshopper warbler, far off in the grass.
     "what a moon!" said silver. "let's enjoy it while it's here."
     as they went over the bank they met speedwell and hawkbit returning.
     "oh, hazel," said hawkbit, "we've been talking to another mouse. he'd heard
about the kestrel this evening and was very friendly. he told us about a place just
the other side of the wood where the grass has been cut short -- something to do
with horses, he said. 'you like a nice a grass? 'e very fine grass.' so we went there.

     it followed hazel docilely enough across the grass, but he was careful to keep
out of its reach. their arrival outside the wood caused something of a sensation,
which hazel cut short with a peremptory sharpness quite unlike his usual
manner.
     "come on, get busy," he said to dandelion and buckthorn. "this bird's hurt
and we're going to shelter it until it's better. ask bigwig to show you how to get it
some food. it eats worms and insects. try grasshoppers, spiders -- anything.
hawkbit! acorn! yes, and you too, fiver -- come out of that rapt trance, or
whatever you're in. we need an open, wide hole, broader than it's deep, with a flat
floor a little below the level of the entrance: by nightfall."
     "we've been digging all the afternoon, hazel--"
     "i know. i'll come and help you," said hazel, "in just a little while. only get
started. the night's coming."
     the astonished rabbits obeyed him, grumbling. hazel's authority was put to

was secretly disappointed not to have gone on the expedition with holly; and
when the other two pointed out that they were relying on him to tell them how to
get the hutch open, he agreed to come.
     "do we need to take everyone?" he asked. "you say the dog's tied up and i
suppose there can't be more than three cats. too many rabbits will only be a
nuisance in the dark: someone will get lost and we shall have to spend time
looking for him."
     "well, dandelion, speedwell and hawkbit, then," said bigwig, "and leave the
others behind. do you mean to go tonight, hazel-rah?"
     "yes, the sooner the better," said hazel. "get hold of those three and tell them.

     however, their hopes for that night were disappointed, for the rain returned

higher and smaller, settling at last into a mackerel sky like a beach at low tide.
hazel took bigwig and blackberry to the edge of the escarpment, whence they
could look across to nuthanger on its little hill. he described the approach and
went on to explain how the rabbit hutch was to be found. bigwig was in high
spirits. the wind and the prospect of action excited him and he spent some time
with dandelion, hawkbit and speedwell, pretending to be a cat and encouraging
them to attack him as realistically as they could. hazel, whose talk with fiver had
somewhat clouded him, recovered as he watched them tussling over the grass and
ended by joining in himself, first as an attacker and then as the cat, staring and
quivering for all the world like the nuthanger tabby.
     "i shall be disappointed if we don't meet a cat after all this," said dandelion, as
he waited for his turn to run at a fallen beech branch f

struck, for the wounded cat made off across the yard and disappeared under the

round the dark yard as he tried to get his bearings.

     it was hawkbit who found the little yard. hazel had been anxious in case the
shed door might be shut; but it stood just ajar and the five of them slipped in one
after the other. in the thick gloom they could not make out the hutch, but they
could both smell and hear the rabbits.
     "blackberry," said bigwig quickly, "you come with me and get the hutch open.
you other three, keep watching. if another cat comes, you'll have to take it on
yourselves."

at this moment a second cat -- hazel's tabby -- came round the further end of the
farmhouse and made toward them. as it passed the kennel the labrador woke
and sat up, thrusting out its head and shoulders and looking first to one side and
then the other. it saw the rabbits, ran to the length of its rope and began to bark.
     "come on!" said bigwig. "we can't stay here. up the lane, everybody, and
quickly, too." blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit ran at once, taking boxwood

and clover with them into the darkness under the barn. dandelion remained
beside haystack, begging her to move and expecting every moment to feel the
cat's claws in his back. bigwig leaped across to him.
     "dandelion," he said in his ear, "get out of it, unless you want to be killed!"
     "but the--" began dandelion.
     "do as i say!" said bigwig. the noise of barking was fearful and he himself was
close to panic. dandelion hesitated a moment longer. then he

     "because they wouldn't move. it was bad enough before the dog started."
     "is the dog tied?" asked hazel.
     "yes, it's tied. but do you expect any rabbit to stand his ground a few feet from
an angry dog?"
     "no, of course not," replied hazel. "you've done wonders, bigwig. they were
just telling me, before you came, that you gave one of the cats such a beating that
it was afraid to come back for more. now look, do you think you and blackberry,
with speedwell here and hawkbit, can get these two rabbits back to the warren?
i'm afraid you may need most of the night. they can't go very fast and you'll have
to be patient with them. dandelion, you come with me, will you?"
     "where, hazel-rah?"
     "to fetch the other two," said hazel. "you're the fastest, so it won't be so
dangerous for you, will it? now, don't hang about, bigwig, there's a good fellow.

     before bigwig could reply he had disappeared under the elms. dandelion

he was, looking at bigwig uncertainly.
     "are you going to do what he says?" asked bigwig.
     "well, are you?" said dandelion.
     it took bigwig no more than a moment to realize that if he said he was not,
complete disorganization would follow. he could not take all the others back into
the farm, and he could not leave them alone. he muttered something about hazel
being too embleer clever by half, cuffed hawkbit off a sow thistle he was nibbling
and led his five rabbits over the bank into the field. dandelion, left alone, set off
after hazel into the farmyard.
     as he went down the side of the barn, he could hear hazel out in the open, near
the doe haystack. neither of the hutch rabbits had moved from where he and
bigwig had left them. the dog had returned to its kennel; but although it was not
to be seen, he felt that it was awake and watchful. he came cautiously out of the

shadow and approached

 him hit, but they were very close to him."
     "we'd better wait," said bigwig.
     they waited a long time. at last dandelion and bigwig went cautiously back up

the lane. they found the bottom of the ditch trampled by boots and streaked with
blood, and returned to tell the others.
     the journey back, with the three limping hutch rabbits, lasted more than two
weary hours. all were dejected and wretched. when at last they reached the foot
of the down bigwig told blackberry, speedwell and hawkbit to leave them and go
on to the warren. they approached the wood just at first light and a rabbit ran to
meet them through the wet grass. it was fiver. blackberry stopped and waited
beside him while the other two went on in silence.
     "fiver," he said, "there's bad news. hazel--"
     "i know," replied fiver. "i know now."
     "how do you know?" asked blackberry, startled.
     "as you came through the grass just now," said fiver, very low, "there was a
fourth rabbit behind you, limping and

etween them, thought hazel: pipkin and
fiver looked as fresh as silver and bigwig. still, a little entertainment would be all
to the good and raise their spirits. he was just going to speak up when acorn
saved him the trouble.
     "will you tell us a story, dandelion?" he asked.
     "yes! yes!" said several others. "come on! make it a stunner while you're at it!"
     "all right," said dandelion. "how about 'el-ahrairah and the fox in the
water'?"
     "let's have 'the hole in the sky,'" said hawkbit.
     "no, not that," said bigwig suddenly. he had spoken very little all the evening
and everyone looked round. "if you're going to tell a story, there's only one i
want," he went on. "'el-ahrairah and the black rabbit of inlé.'"
     "perhaps not that one," said hazel.
     bigwig rounded on him, snarling. "if there's going to be a story, don't you think
i've got as good a right as anyone to choose it?" he asked.
     hazel did not reply and after a pause, during which no one else spoke,

elds, sloping gently downhill and divided
not by hedges but by broad, low banks, each as wide as a lane and overgrown with
elder, dogwood and spindle. it was true rabbit country, reassuring after the belt
and the tangled, goose-grassed combe; and when they had covered a good
distance over the turf -- halting continually to listen and sniff and running, now
one and now another, from each piece of cover to the next -- hazel felt safe in
giving them a rest. as soon as he had sent out speedwell and hawkbit as sentries,
he led bigwig to one side.
     "i'm angry with you," he said. "you're the one rabbit we're not going to be able
to do without and you have to go and run a silly risk like that. it wasn't necessary
and it wasn't even clever. what were you up to?"
     "i'm afraid i just lost my head, hazel," replied bigwig. "i've been strung up all
day, thinking about this business at efrafa -- got me really on edge. when i feel
like that i have to do something -- you know, fight or run a risk. i t

 was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field. other rabbits began to appear through
the rain: acorn, clearly frightened, but determined not to run; dandelion
encouraging pipkin; speedwell and hawkbit making toward kehaar -- the only
creature visible above the ground haze. bigwig and silver brought them together
as best they could and made them understand that they were to help to get the
does away.
     "go back to blackberry, go back to blackberry," silver kept repeating. "i left
three of our rabbits in different places to mark the way back," he explained to
bigwig. "blackberry's first, then bluebell, then fiver -- he's quite near the river."
     "and there is blackberry," said bigwig.

 but here, on the test, there were no
submerged branches and no gravel spits or beds of weed above the surface at all.
from bank to bank the current, regular and unvaried, flowed as fast as a man
strolling. the punt slipped downstream smoothly, without any alteration of the
speed which it had gained within a few yards of leaving the bank.
     most of the rabbits had very little idea of what was happening. the efrafan
does had never seen a river and it would certainly have been beyond pipkin or
hawkbit to explain to them that they were on a boat. they -- and nearly all the
others -- had simply trusted hazel and done as they were told. but all -- bucks
and does alike -- realized that woundwort and his followers had vanished.
wearied by all they had gone through, the sodden rabbits crouched without
talking, incapable of any feeling but a dull relief and without even the energy to
wonder what was going to happen next.
     that they should feel any relief -- dull or otherwise -- was remarkable i

 straight -- parallel
with the surface and about eight inches above it. just in time hazel saw what
kehaar meant. if the punt did pass under the bridge without sticking, it would do

so by no more than a claw's breadth. any creature above the level of the sides
would be struck and perhaps knocked into the river. he scuttered through the
warm bilgewater to the other end and pushed his way up among the wet, crowded
rabbits.
     "get down in the bottom! get down in the bottom!" he said. "silver, hawkbit --
all of you. never mind the water. you, and you -- what's your name? oh,
blackavar, is it? -- get everyone into the bottom. be quick."
     like bigwig, he found that the efrafan rabbits obeyed him at once. he saw
kehaar fly up from his perch and disappear over the wooden rails. the concrete
abutments projected from each bank, so that the narrowed river ran slightly
faster under the bridge. the punt had been drifting broadside on, but now one
end swung forward, so that hazel lost his bearings

ey swim."
     in spite of what blackavar had said, it was a long time before everyone had left
the boat. there were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where they
were, or looked stupidly at the water until others were brought to take their place.
from time to time bigwig would ask one of the bucks to give a lead and in this
way acorn, hawkbit and bluebell all scrambled over the side. the injured doe,
thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever h

     holly and blackavar reached the long shadow of the wood at top speed, as
though they were being pursued. the watchers expected them to slow down as
they came to the bank, but they kept straight on and appeared actually to be
going to run underground. at the last moment holly stopped, looked about him
and stamped twice. blackavar disappeared down the nearest hole. at the
stamping, all the rabbits above ground ran for cover.
     "here, wait a minute," said hazel, pushing past pipkin and hawkbit as they
came across the grass. "holly, what's the alarm? tell us something, instead of
stamping the place to pieces. what's happened?"
     "get the holes filled in!" gasped holly. "get everyone underground! there's not
a moment to lose." his eyes rolled white and he panted foam over his chin.
     "is it men, or what? there's nothing to be seen, heard or smelled. come on, tell
us something and stop gibbering, there's a good chap."
     "it'll have to be quick, then," said holly. "that combe --
