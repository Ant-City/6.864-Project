you to travel thitherward; when the roads are so unsafe, the escort of
sir brian de bois-guilbert is not to be despised.”

“sir prior,” answered the saxon, “wheresoever i have travelled in this
land, i have hitherto found myself, with the assistance of my good sword
and faithful followers, in no respect needful of other aid. at present,
if we indeed journey to ashby-de-la-zouche, we do so with my noble
neighbour and countryman athelstane of coningsburgh, and with such a
train as would set outlaws and feudal enemies at defiance.--i drink

in adhering to monastic rule,” he added, “as to prefer your acid

thence through france to england. “ivanhoe,” he said, “was so well
acquainted with the language and manners of the french, that there was
no fear of his incurring any hazard during that part of his travels.”

“would to god,” said the lady rowena, “he were here safely arrived, and
able to bear arms in the approaching tourney, in which the chivalry
of this land are expected to display their address and valour. should
athelstane of coningsburgh obtain the prize, ivanhoe is like to hear
evil tidings when he reaches england.--how looked he, stranger, when
you last saw him? had disease laid her hand heavy upon his strength and
comeliness?”

“he was darker,” said the palmer, “and thinner, than when he came from
cyprus in the train of coeur-de-lion, and care seemed to sit heavy on
his brow; but i approached not his presence, because he is unknown to
me.”

the hinds know they must share the high places of the synagogue with

those who occupied the gallery to whom this injurious and unpolite
speech was addressed, were the family of cedric the saxon, with that of
his ally and kinsman, athelstane of coningsburgh, a personage, who, on
account of his descent from the last saxon monarchs of england, was held
in the highest respect by all the saxon natives of the north of england.
but with the blood of this ancient royal race, many of their infirmities
had descended to athelstane. he was comely in countenance, bulky

cedric, were passionately attached to him, contended that this sluggish
temper arose not from want of courage, but from mere want of decision;
others alleged that his hereditary vice of drunkenness had obscured his
faculties, never of a very acute order, and that the passive courage
and meek good-nature which remained behind, were merely the dregs of a
character that might have been deserving of praise, but of which all the

athelstane, utterly confounded at an order which the manners and
feelings of the times rendered so injuriously insulting, unwilling to
obey, yet undetermined how to resist, opposed only the “vis inertiae” to
the will of john; and, without stirring or making any motion whatever of
obedience, opened his large grey eyes, and stared at the prince with
an astonishment which had in it something extremely ludicrous. but the
impatient john regarded it in no such light.

the leader of a band of free companions, or condottieri; that is, of

attendants of prince john; but de bracy, whose profession freed him from
all scruples, extended his long lance over the space which separated
the gallery from the lists, and would have executed the commands of
the prince before athelstane the unready had recovered presence of mind
sufficient even to draw back his person from the weapon, had not cedric,
as prompt as his companion was tardy, unsheathed, with the speed of
lightning, the short sword which he wore, and at a single blow severed
the point of the lance from the handle. the blood rushed into the
countenance of prince john. he swore one of his deepest oaths, and
was about to utter some threat corresponding in violence, when he was
diverted from his purpose, partly by his

but none shared the general feeling of dissatisfaction so keenly as
cedric the saxon, who saw, in each advantage gained by the norman
challengers, a repeated triumph over the honour of england. his own
education had taught him no skill in the games of chivalry, although,
with the arms of his saxon ancestors, he had manifested himself, on
many occasions, a brave and determined soldier. he looked anxiously
to athelstane, who had learned the accomplishments of the age, as if
desiring that he should make some personal effort to recover the victory
which was passing into the hands of the templar and his associates.
but, though both stout of heart, and strong of person, athelstane had a
disposition too inert and unambitious to make the exertions which cedric
seemed to expect from him.

“the day is against england, my lord,” said cedric, in a marked tone;
“are you not tempted to take the lance?”

“i shall

 tilt to-morrow” answered athelstane, “in the ‘melee’; it is not
worth while for me to arm myself to-day.”

two things displeased cedric in this speech. it contained the norman
word “melee”, (to express the general conflict,) and it evinced
some indifference to the honour of the country; but it was spoken by
athelstane, whom he held in such profound respect, that he would not
trust himself to canvass his motives or his foibles. moreover, he had
no time to make any remark, for wamba thrust in his word, observing, “it
was better, though scarce easier, to be the best man among a hundred,
than the best man of two.”

athelstane took the observation as a serious compliment; but cedric,
who better understood the jester’s meaning, darted at him a severe and
menacing look; and lucky it was for wamba, perhaps, th

used had merited his predilection. cedric the saxon, overjoyed at
the discomfiture of the templar, and still more so at the miscarriage of
his two malevolent neighbours, front-de-boeuf and malvoisin, had, with
his body half stretched over the balcony, accompanied the victor in each
course, not with his eyes only, but with his whole heart and soul. the
lady rowena had watched the progress of the day with equal attention,
though without openly betraying the same intense interest. even the
unmoved athelstane had shown symptoms of shaking off his apathy, when,
calling for a huge goblet of muscadine, he quaffed it to the health
of the disinherited knight. another group, stationed under the gallery
occupied by the saxons, had shown no less interest in the fate of the
day.

“father abraham!” said isaac of york, when the first course was run
betwixt the templar and the disinherited knight, “how fiercely that
gentile rides! ah, the good horse that was brought all the long way
from barbary, he takes

on his motions; and then,
gradually and gracefully sinking the point of his lance, he deposited
the coronet which it supported at the feet of the fair rowena. the
trumpets instantly sounded, while the heralds proclaimed the lady rowena
the queen of beauty and of love for the ensuing day, menacing with
suitable penalties those who should be disobedient to her authority.
they then repeated their cry of largesse, to which cedric, in the height
of his joy, replied by an ample donative, and to which athelstane,
though less promptly, added one equally large.

there was some murmuring among the damsels of norman descent, who were
as much unused to see the preference given to a saxon beauty, as the
norman nobles were to sustain defeat in the games of chivalry which they
themselves had introduced. but these sounds of disaffection were drowned
by the popular shout of “long live the lady rowena, the chosen and
lawful queen of love and of beauty!” to which many in the lower area
added, “long live the

it please you to-day, with your noble sire and friends, to grace our
banquet in the castle of ashby, we shall learn to know the empress to

rowena remained silent, and cedric answered for her in his native saxon.

“the lady rowena,” he said, “possesses not the language in which to
reply to your courtesy, or to sustain her part in your festival. i also,
and the noble athelstane of coningsburgh, speak only the language, and
practise only the manners, of our fathers. we therefore decline with
thanks your highness’s courteous invitation to the banquet. to-morrow,
the lady rowena will take upon her the state to which she has been
called by the free election of the victor knight, confirmed by the
acclamations of the people.”

so saying, he lifted the coronet, and placed it upon rowena’s head, in
token of her acceptance of the temporary authority assigned to her.

eral who were too late in
preferring their claim to be included.

about the hour of ten o’clock, the whole plain was crowded with
horsemen, horsewomen, and foot-passengers, hastening to the tournament;
and shortly after, a grand flourish of trumpets announced prince john
and his retinue, attended by many of those knights who meant to take
share in the game, as well as others who had no such intention.

about the same time arrived cedric the saxon, with the lady rowena,
unattended, however, by athelstane. this saxon lord had arrayed his
tall and strong person in armour, in order to take his place among the
combatants; and, considerably to the surprise of cedric, had chosen to
enlist himself on the part of the knight templar. the saxon, indeed, had
remonstrated strongly with his friend upon the injudicious choice he had
made of his party; but he had only received that sort of answer usually
given by those who are more obstinate in following their own course,
than strong in justifying it.

st, if not his only reason, for adhering to the party of brian de

his apathy of disposition prevented his taking any means to recommend
himself to the lady rowena, he was, nevertheless, by no means insensible
to her charms, and considered his union with her as a matter already
fixed beyond doubt, by the assent of cedric and her other friends. it
had therefore been with smothered displeasure that the proud though
indolent lord of coningsburgh beheld the victor of the preceding day
select rowena as the object of that

honour which it became his privilege
to confer. in order to punish him for a preference which seemed to
interfere with his own suit, athelstane, confident of his strength,
and to whom his flatterers, at least, ascribed great skill in arms, had
determined not only to deprive the disinherited knight of his powerful
succour, but, if an opportunity should occur, to make him feel the
weight of his battle-axe.

de bracy, and other knights attached to prince john, in obedience to
a hint from him, had joined the party of the challengers, john being
desirous to secure, if possible, the victory to that side. on the
other hand, many other knights

strife, the templar and the disinherited knight at length encountered
hand to hand, with all the fury that mortal animosity, joined to rivalry
of honour, could inspire. such was the address of each in parrying
and striking, that the spectators broke forth into a unanimous and
involuntary shout, expressive of their delight and admiration.

but at this moment the party of the disinherited knight had the worst;
the gigantic arm of front-de-boeuf on the one flank, and the ponderous
strength of athelstane on the other, bearing down and dispersing
those immediately exposed to them. finding themselves freed from their
immediate antagonists, it seems to have occurred to both these knights
at the same instant, that they would render the most decisive advantage
to their party, by aiding the templar in his contest with his rival.
turning their horses, therefore, at the same moment, the norman spurred
against the disinherited knight on the one side, and the saxon on the
other. it was utterly impossible

 that the object of this unequal and
unexpected assault could have sustained it, had he not been warned by a
general cry from the spectators, who could not but take interest in one
exposed to such disadvantage.

“beware! beware! sir disinherited!” was shouted so universally, that
the knight became aware of his danger; and, striking a full blow at the
templar, he reined back his steed in the same moment, so as to escape
the charge of athelstane and front-de-boeuf. these knights, therefore,
their aim being thus eluded, rushed from opposite sides betwixt the
object of their attack and the templar, almost running their horses
against each other ere they could stop their career. recovering their
horses however, and wheeling them round, the whole three pursued their
united purpose of bearing to the earth the disinherited knight.

nothing could have saved him, except the remarkable strength and
activity of the noble horse which he had won o

this stood him in the more stead, as the horse of bois-guilbert was
wounded, and those of front-de-boeuf and athelstane were both tired with
the weight of their gigantic masters, clad in complete armour, and with
the preceding exertions of the day. the masterly horsemanship of the
disinherited knight, and the activity of the noble animal which he
mounted, enabled him for a few minutes to keep at sword’s point his
three antagonists, turning and wheeling with the agility of a hawk upon
the wing, keeping his enemies as far separate as he could, and rushing
now against the one, now against the other, dealing sweep

 rescue!” it was high time; for, while the disinherited knight was
pressing upon the templar, front-de-boeuf had got nigh to him with his
uplifted sword; but ere the blow could descend, the sable knight dealt
a stroke on his head, which, glancing from the polished helmet, lighted
with violence scarcely abated on the “chamfron” of the steed, and
front-de-boeuf rolled on the ground, both horse and man equally stunned
by the fury of the blow. “le noir faineant” then turned his horse upon
athelstane of coningsburgh; and his own sword having been broken in his
encounter with front-de-boeuf, he wrenched from the hand of the bulky
saxon the battle-axe which he wielded, and, like one familiar with
the use of the weapon, bestowed him such a blow upon the crest, that
athelstane also lay senseless on the field. having achieved this double
feat, for which he was the more highly applauded that it was totally
unexpected from him, the knight seemed to resume the sluggishness of
his character, returni

resist the
temptation of pulling the long beards of the irish chieftains; a
conduct which, as might have been expected, was highly resented by these
insulted dignitaries, and produced fatal consequences to the english
domination in ireland. it is necessary to keep these inconsistencies
of john’s character in view, that the reader may understand his conduct
during the present evening.

in execution of the resolution which he had formed during his cooler
moments, prince john received cedric and athelstane with distinguished
courtesy, and expressed his disappointment, without resentment, when the
indisposition of rowena was alleged by the former as a reason for her
not attending upon his gracious summons. cedric and athelstane were both
dressed in the ancient saxon garb, which, although not unhandsome in
itself, and in the present instance composed of costly materials, was
so remote in shape and appearance from that of the other guests, that
prince john took great credit to himself with waldemar

uliar to their inferior station. prince john, indeed, and those who
courted his pleasure by imitating his foibles, were apt to indulge to
excess in the pleasures of the trencher and the goblet; and indeed it is
well known that his death was occasioned by a surfeit upon peaches and
new ale. his conduct, however, was an exception to the general manners
of his countrymen.

with sly gravity, interrupted only by private signs to each other, the
norman knights and nobles beheld the ruder demeanour of athelstane
and cedric at a banquet, to the form and fashion of which they were
unaccustomed. and while their manners were thus the subject of sarcastic
observation, the untaught saxons unwittingly transgressed several of the
arbitrary rules established for the regulation of society. now, it is
well known, that a man may with more impunity be guilty of an actual
breach either of real good breeding or of good morals, than appear
ignorant of the most minute point of fashionable etiquette. thus cedric,

ied his hands with a towel, instead of suffering the moisture to

his companion athelstane, when he swallowed to his own single share
the whole of a large pasty composed of the most exquisite foreign
delicacies, and termed at that time a “karum-pie”. when, however, it
was discovered, by a serious cross-examination, that the thane of
coningsburgh (or franklin, as the normans termed him) had no idea
what he had been devouring, and that he had taken the contents of the
karum-pie for larks and pigeons, whereas they were in fact beccaficoes
and nightingales, his ignorance brought him

y cup to cedric himself, since he
refuses to pledge his son’s health.”

the cup went round amid the well-dissembled applause of the courtiers,
which, however, failed to make the impression on the mind of the saxon
that had been designed. he was not naturally acute of perception,
but those too much undervalued his understanding who deemed that this
flattering compliment would obliterate the sense of the prior insult. he
was silent, however, when the royal pledge again passed round, “to sir
athelstane of coningsburgh.”

the knight made his obeisance, and showed his sense of the honour by
draining a huge goblet in answer to it.

“and now, sirs,” said prince john, who began to be warmed with the wine
which he had drank, “having done justice to our saxon guests, we
will pray of them some requital to our courtesy.--worthy thane,” he
continued, addressing cedric, “may we pray you to name to us some norman
whose mention may least sully your mouth, and to wash down with a goblet

 their lips, and again replacing it before them. there
were many who, with a more generous feeling, exclaimed, “long live king
richard! and may he be speedily restored to us!” and some few, among
whom were front-de-boeuf and the templar, in sullen disdain suffered
their goblets to stand untasted before them. but no man ventured
directly to gainsay a pledge filled to the health of the reigning
monarch.

having enjoyed his triumph for about a minute, cedric said to his
companion, “up, noble athelstane! we have remained here long enough,
since we have requited the hospitable courtesy of prince john’s banquet.
those who wish to know further of our rude saxon manners must henceforth
seek us in the homes of our fathers, since we have seen enough of royal
banquets, and enough of norman courtesy.”

so saying, he arose and left the banqueting room, followed by
athelstane, and by several other guests, who, partaking of the saxon
lineage, held themselves insulted by the sarcasms of prince john an

ther will i go, were it only to show these proud normans how little
the fate of a son, who could defeat their bravest, can affect a saxon.”

“thither,” said rowena, “do i not go; and i pray you to beware, lest
what you mean for courage and constancy, shall be accounted hardness of
heart.”

“remain at home, then, ungrateful lady,” answered cedric; “thine is the
hard heart, which can sacrifice the weal of an oppressed people to an
idle and unauthorized attachment. i seek the noble athelstane, and with
him attend the banquet of john of anjou.”

he went accordingly to the banquet, of which we have already mentioned
the principal events. immediately upon retiring from the castle, the
saxon thanes, with their attendants, took horse; and it was during the
bustle which attended their doing so, that cedric, for the first time,
cast his eyes upon the deserter gurth. the noble saxon had returned from
the banquet, as we have seen, in no very placid humour, and wanted but a
pretext for wrea

!” he said, “the gyves!--oswald--hundibert!--dogs and
villains!--why leave ye the knave unfettered?”

without daring to remonstrate, the companions of gurth bound him with
a halter, as the readiest cord which occurred. he submitted to the
operation without remonstrance, except that, darting a reproachful
look at his master, he said, “this comes of loving your flesh and blood
better than mine own.”

“to horse, and forward!” said cedric.

“it is indeed full time,” said the noble athelstane; “for, if we
ride not the faster, the worthy abbot waltheoff’s preparations for a
rere-supper [25] will be altogether spoiled.”

the travellers, however, used such speed as to reach the convent of st
withold’s before the apprehended evil took place. the abbot, himself of
ancient saxon descent, received the noble saxons with the profuse and
exuberant hospitality of their nation, wherein they indulged to a late,
or rather an early hour; nor did they take leave of their reverend host
the n

ices which their ancestors had brought
from scandinavia, and piqued themselves upon thinking freely on such
topics.

in the present instance, the apprehension of impending evil was inspired
by no less respectable a prophet than a large lean black dog, which,
sitting upright, howled most piteously as the foremost riders left the
gate, and presently afterwards, barking wildly, and jumping to and fro,
seemed bent upon attaching itself to the party.

“i like not that music, father cedric,” said athelstane; for by this
title of respect he was accustomed to address him.

“nor i either, uncle,” said wamba; “i greatly fear we shall have to pay
the piper.”

“in my mind,” said athelstane, upon whose memory the abbot’s good
ale (for burton was already famous for that genial liquor) had made a
favourable impression,--“in my mind we had better turn back, and abide
with the abbot until the afternoon. it is unlucky to travel where your
path is crossed by a monk, a hare, or a howling dog, un

“if i thought so,” said gurth--“if i could but think so--but no--i saw
the javelin was well aimed--i heard it whizz through the air with all
the wrathful malevolence of him who cast it, and it quivered after it
had pitched in the ground, as if with regret for having missed its mark.
by the hog dear to st anthony, i renounce him!”

and the indignant swineherd resumed his sullen silence, which no efforts
of the jester could again induce him to break.

meanwhile cedric and athelstane, the leaders of the troop, conversed
together on the state of the land, on the dissensions of the royal
family, on the feuds and quarrels among the norman nobles, and on the
chance which there was that the oppressed saxons might be able to
free themselves from the yoke of the normans, or at least to elevate
themselves into national consequence and independence, during the civil
convulsions which were likely to ensue. on this subject cedric was all
animation. the restoration of the independence

of his heart, to which he had willingly sacrificed domestic happiness
and the interests of his own son. but, in order to achieve this great
revolution in favour of the native english, it was necessary that they
should be united among themselves, and act under an acknowledged head.
the necessity of choosing their chief from the saxon blood-royal was not
only evident in itself, but had been made a solemn condition by those
whom cedric had intrusted with his secret plans and hopes. athelstane
had this quality at least; and though he had few mental accomplishments
or talents to recommend him as a leader, he had still a goodly person,
was no coward, had been accustomed to martial exercises, and seemed
willing to defer to the advice of counsellors more wise than himself.
above all, he was known to be liberal and hospitable, and believed to be
good-natured. but whatever pretensions athelstane had to be considered
as head of the saxon confederacy, many of that nation were disposed

it would have been no difficult thing for cedric, had he been so
disposed, to have placed himself at the head of a third party, as
formidable at least as any of the others. to counterbalance their royal
descent, he had courage, activity, energy, and, above all, that devoted
attachment to the cause which had procured him the epithet of the saxon,
and his birth was inferior to none, excepting only that of athelstane
and his ward. these qualities, however, were unalloyed by the slightest
shade of selfishness; and, instead of dividing yet farther his weakened
nation by forming a faction of his own, it was a leading part of
cedric’s plan to extinguish that which already existed, by promoting a
marriage betwixt rowena and athelstane. an obstacle occurred to this his
favourite project, in the mutual attachment of his ward and his son and
hence the original cause of the banishment of wilfred from the house of

it was in vain that he attempted to dazzle her with the prospect of a
visionary throne. rowena, who possessed strong sense, neither considered
his plan as practicable, nor as desirable, so far as she was concerned,
could it have been achieved. without attempting to conceal her avowed
preference of wilfred of ivanhoe, she declared that, were that favoured
knight out of question, she would rather take refuge in a convent, than
share a throne with athelstane, whom, having always despised, she now
began, on account of the trouble she received on his account, thoroughly
to detest.

nevertheless, cedric, whose opinions of women’s constancy was far from
strong, persisted in using every means in his power to bring about the
proposed match, in which he conceived he was rendering an important
service to the saxon cause. the sudden and romantic appearance of his
son in the lists at ashby, he had justly regarded as almost a death’s
blow to his hopes. hi

s paternal affection, it is true, had for an
instant gained the victory over pride and patriotism; but both had
returned in full force, and under their joint operation, he was now bent
upon making a determined effort for the union of athelstane and rowena,
together with expediting those other measures which seemed necessary to
forward the restoration of saxon independence.

on this last subject, he was now labouring with athelstane, not without
having reason, every now and then, to lament, like hotspur, that he
should have moved such a dish of skimmed milk to so honourable an
action. athelstane, it is true, was vain enough, and loved to have
his ears tickled with tales of his high descent, and of his right
by inheritance to homage and sovereignty. but his petty vanity was
sufficiently gratified by receiving this homage at the hands of his
immediate attendants, and of the saxons who approached him. if he had
the courage to
 
 ___________________________
 
 encounter danger, he at least hated the trouble of going
to seek it; and while he agreed in the general principles laid down by
cedric concerning the claim of the saxons to independence, and was still
more easily convinced of his own title to reign over them when that
independence should be attained, yet when the means of asserting these
rights came to be discussed, he was still “athelstane the unready,”
 slow, irresolute, procrastinating, and unenterprising. the warm and
impassioned exhortations of cedric had as little effect upon his
impassive temper, as red-hot balls alighting in the water, which produce
a little sound and smoke, and are instantly extinguished.

if, leaving this task, which might be compared to spurring a tired jade,
or to hammering upon cold iron, cedric fell back to his ward rowena, he
received little more satisfaction from conferring with her. for, as his

presence interrupted the discourse between the lady and her favourite
attendant upon the gallantry and fate of wilfred, elgitha failed not to
revenge both her mistress and herself, by recurring to the overthrow of
athelstane in the lists, the most disagreeable subject which could greet
the ears of cedric. to this sturdy saxon, therefore, the day’s journey
was fraught with all manner of displeasure and discomfort; so that
he more than once internally cursed the tournament, and him who had
proclaimed it, together with his own folly in ever thinking of going
thither.

the travellers had now reached the verge of the wooded country, and were
about to plunge into its recesses, held dangerous at that time from the
number of outlaws whom oppression and poverty had driven to despair,
and who occupied the forests in such large bands as could easily bid
defiance to the feeble police of the period. from these rovers, however,
notwithstanding the lateness of the hour cedric and athelstane accounted
themselves secure, as they had in attendance ten servants, besides wamba
and gurth, whose aid could not be counted upon, the one being a jester
and the other a captive. it may be added, that in travelling thus late
through the forest, cedric and athelstane relied on their descent and
character, as well as their courage. the outlaws, whom the severity of
the forest laws had reduced to this roving and desperate mode of life,
were chiefly peasants and yeomen of saxon descent, and were ge

fashion, while an old man, whose yellow cap proclaimed him to belong
to the same nation, walked up and down with gestures expressive of the
deepest despair, and wrung his hands, as if affected by some strange
disaster.

to the enquiries of athelstane and cedric, the old jew could for some
time only answer by invoking the protection of all the patriarchs of the
old testament successively against the sons of ishmael, who were coming
to smite them, hip and thigh, with the edge of the sword. when he began
to come to himself out of this agony of terror, isaac of york (for it
was our old friend) was at length able to explain, that he had hired
a body-guard of six men at ashby, together with mules for carrying the
litter of a sick friend. this par

 means either of
defence or of retreat, to be plundered, and probably murdered, by the
banditti, who they expected every moment would bring down upon them.
“would it but please your valours,” added isaac, in a tone of deep
humiliation, “to permit the poor jews to travel under your safeguard,
i swear by the tables of our law, that never has favour been conferred
upon a child of israel since the days of our captivity, which shall be
more gratefully acknowledged.”

“dog of a jew!” said athelstane, whose memory was of that petty
kind which stores up trifles of all kinds, but particularly trifling
offences, “dost not remember how thou didst beard us in the gallery at
the tilt-yard? fight or flee, or compound with the outlaws as thou dost
list, ask neither aid nor company from us; and if they rob only such
as thee, who rob all the world, i, for mine own share, shall hold them
right honest folk.”

cedric did not assent to the severe proposal of his companion. “we shall
do better,” s

aid he, “to leave them two of our attendants and two horses
to convey them back to the next village. it will diminish our strength
but little; and with your good sword, noble athelstane, and the aid of
those who remain, it will be light work for us to face twenty of those
runagates.”

rowena, somewhat alarmed by the mention of outlaws in force, and so
near them, strongly seconded the proposal of her guardian. but rebecca
suddenly quitting her dejected posture, and making her way through the
attendants to the palfrey of the saxon lady, knelt down, and, after the
oriental fashion in addressing superiors, kissed the hem of rowena’s
garment. then rising, and throwing back her

 appeal, gave it
double weight with the fair saxon.

“the man is old and feeble,” she said to her guardian, “the maiden young
and beautiful, their friend sick and in peril of his life--jews though
they be, we cannot as christians leave them in this extremity. let them
unload two of the sumpter-mules, and put the baggage behind two of the
serfs. the mules may transport the litter, and we have led horses for
the old man and his daughter.”

cedric readily assented to what she proposed, and athelstane only added
the condition, “that they should travel in the rear of the whole party,
where wamba,” he said, “might attend them with his shield of boar’s
brawn.”

“i have left my shield in the tilt-yard,” answered the jester, “as has
been the fate of many a better knight than myself.”

athelstane coloured deeply, for such had been his own fate on the
last day of the tournament; while rowena, who was pleased in the same
proportion, as if to make amends for the brutal jest of her u

 and when it began to be whispered among them
that gurth had actually disappeared, they were under such immediate
expectation of an attack from the outlaws, that it was not held
convenient to pay much attention to the circumstance.

the path upon which the party travelled was now so narrow, as not to
admit, with any sort of convenience, above two riders abreast, and began
to descend into a dingle, traversed by a brook whose banks were broken,
swampy, and overgrown with dwarf willows. cedric and athelstane, who
were at the head of their retinue, saw the risk of being attacked at
this pass; but neither of them having had much practice in war, no
better mode of preventing the danger occurred to them than that they
should hasten through the defile as fast as possible. advancing,
therefore, without much order, they had just crossed the brook with a
part of their followers, when they were assailed in front, flank,
and rear at once, with an impetuosity to which, in their confused and
ill-prepared condi

etter effect than that which he had hurled at fangs, nailed the
man against an oak-tree that happened to be close behind him. thus far
successful, cedric spurred his horse against a second, drawing his sword
at the same time, and striking with such inconsiderate fury, that
his weapon encountered a thick branch which hung over him, and he
was disarmed by the violence of his own blow. he was instantly made
prisoner, and pulled from his horse by two or three of the banditti who
crowded around him. athelstane shared his captivity, his bridle having
been seized, and he himself forcibly dismounted, long before he could
draw his weapon, or assume any posture of effectual defence.

the attendants, embarrassed with baggage, surprised and terrified at the
fate of their masters, fell an easy prey to the assailants; while
the lady rowena, in the centre of the cavalcade, and the jew and his
daughter in the rear, experienced the same misfortune.

of all the train none escaped except wamba, who showed upon the

a low and cautious tone, “wamba!” and, at the same time, a dog, which he
recognised to be fangs, jumped up and fawned upon him. “gurth!” answered
wamba, with the same caution, and the swineherd immediately stood before
him.

“what is the matter?” said he eagerly; “what mean these cries, and that
clashing of swords?”

“only a trick of the times,” said wamba; “they are all prisoners.”

“who are prisoners?” exclaimed gurth, impatiently.

“my lord, and my lady, and athelstane, and hundibert, and oswald.”

“in the name of god!” said gurth, “how came they prisoners?--and to
whom?”

“our master was too ready to fight,” said the jester; “and athelstane
was not ready enough, and no other person was ready at all. and they are
prisoners to green cassocks, and black visors. and they lie all tumbled
about on the green, like the crab-apples that you shake down to your
swine. and i would laugh at it,” said the honest jester, “if i could for

“i would willingly believe so,” said the woodsman, “for never had this
country such need to be supported by those who love her. hear me, and
i will tell thee of an enterprise, in which, if thou be’st really
that which thou seemest, thou mayst take an honourable part. a band
of villains, in the disguise of better men than themselves, have made
themselves master of the person of a noble englishman, called cedric
the saxon, together with his ward, and his friend athelstane of
coningsburgh, and have transported them to a castle in this forest,
called torquilstone. i ask of thee, as a good knight and a good
englishman, wilt thou aid in their rescue?”

“i am bound by my vow to do so,” replied the knight; “but i would
willingly know who you are, who request my assistance in their behalf?”

country, and of my country’s friends--with this account of me you must

wood by which they were surrounded, than he instantly augured more truly
concerning the cause of his misfortune.

“i did injustice,” he said, “to the thieves and outlaws of these woods,
when i supposed such banditti to belong to their bands; i might as
justly have confounded the foxes of these brakes with the ravening
wolves of france. tell me, dogs--is it my life or my wealth that your
master aims at? is it too much that two saxons, myself and the noble
athelstane, should hold land in the country which was once the patrimony
of our race?--put us then to death, and complete your tyranny by taking
our lives, as you began with our liberties. if the saxon cedric cannot
rescue england, he is willing to die for her. tell your tyrannical
master, i do only beseech him to dismiss the lady rowena in honour and
safety. she is a woman, and he need not dread her; and with us will die
all who dare fight in her cause.”

 as to the former, and
they now stood before the gate of the castle. de bracy winded his horn
three times, and the archers and cross-bow men, who had manned the wall
upon seeing their approach, hastened to lower the drawbridge, and admit
them. the prisoners were compelled by their guards to alight, and were
conducted to an apartment where a hasty repast was offered them, of
which none but athelstane felt any inclination to partake. neither had
the descendant of the confessor much time to do justice to the good
cheer placed before them, for their guards gave him and cedric to
understand that they were to be imprisoned in a chamber apart from
rowena. resistance was vain; and they were compelled to follow to a
large room, which, rising on clumsy saxon pillars, resembled those
refectories and chapter-houses which may be still seen in the most
ancient parts of our most ancient monasteries.

cedric paced the apartment, filled with indignant reflections on the
past and on the present, while the apathy of his companion served,
instead of patience and philosophy, to defend him against every thing
save the inconvenience of the present moment; and so little did he feel
even this last, that he was only from time to time roused to a reply by
cedric’s animated and impassioned appeal to him.

“yes,” said cedric, half speaking to himself, and half addressing
himself to athelstane, “it was in this very hall that my father feasted
with torquil wolfganger, when he entertained the valiant and unfortunate
harold, then advancing against the norwegians, who had united themselves
to the rebel tosti. it was in this hall that harold returned the
magnanimous answer to the ambassador of his rebel brother. oft have
i heard my father kindle as he told the tale. the envoy of tosti was
admitted, when this ample room could scarce contain the crowd of
noble saxon leaders, who were quaf

fing the blood-red wine around their
monarch.”

“i hope,” said athelstane, somewhat moved by this part of his friend’s
discourse, “they will not forget to send us some wine and refactions at
noon--we had scarce a breathing-space allowed to break our fast, and
i never have the benefit of my food when i eat immediately after
dismounting from horseback, though the leeches recommend that practice.”

cedric went on with his story without noticing this interjectional
observation of his friend.

“the envoy of tosti,” he said, “moved up the hall, undismayed by th

hould tosti accept these terms,’ continued the envoy, ‘what lands
shall be assigned to his faithful ally, hardrada, king of norway?’

“‘seven feet of english ground,’ answered harold, fiercely, ‘or, as
hardrada is said to be a giant, perhaps we may allow him twelve inches
more.’

“the hall rung with acclamations, and cup and horn was filled to
the norwegian, who should be speedily in possession of his english
territory.”

“i could have pledged him with all my soul,” said athelstane, “for my
tongue cleaves to my palate.”

“the baffled envoy,” continued cedric, pursuing with animation his tale,
though it interested not the listener, “retreated, to carry to tosti and
his ally the ominous answer of his injured brother. it was then that
the distant towers of york, and the bloody streams of the derwent,

undaunted valour, the king of norway, and tosti, both fell, with ten

the proud day when this battle was won, the very gale which waved the
saxon banners in triumph, was filling the norman sails, and impelling
them to the fatal shores of sussex?--who would have thought that harold,
within a few brief days, would himself possess no more of his kingdom,
than the share which he allotted in his wrath to the norwegian
invader?--who would have thought that you, noble athelstane--that you,
descended of harold’s blood, and that i, whose father was not the worst
defender of the saxon crown, should be prisoners to a vile norman, in
the very hall in which our ancestors held such high festival?”

“it is sad enough,” replied athelstane; “but i trust they will hold us
to a moderate ransom--at any rate it cannot be their purpose to starve
us outright; and yet, although it is high noon, i see no preparations
for serving dinner. look up at the window, noble cedric, and

normandy to adorn his hall with this new species of emblazonment, that
breaks the golden light of god’s blessed day into so many fantastic
hues. the foreigner came here poor, beggarly, cringing, and subservient,
ready to doff his cap to the meanest native of the household. he
returned pampered and proud, to tell his rapacious countrymen of the
wealth and the simplicity of the saxon nobles--a folly, oh, athelstane,
foreboded of old, as well as foreseen, by those descendants of hengist
and his hardy tribes, who retained the simplicity of their manners. we
made these strangers our bosom friends, our confidential servants;
we borrowed their artists and their arts, and despised the honest
simplicity and hardihood with which our brave ancestors supported
themselves, and we became enervated by norman arts long ere we fell
under norman arms. far better was our homely diet, eaten in peace and
liberty, than the l

uxurious dainties, the love of which hath delivered
us as bondsmen to the foreign conqueror!”

“i should,” replied athelstane, “hold very humble diet a luxury at
present; and it astonishes me, noble cedric, that you can bear so truly
in mind the memory of past deeds, when it appeareth you forget the very
hour of dinner.”

“it is time lost,” muttered cedric apart and impatiently, “to speak
to him of aught else but that which concerns his appetite! the soul of
hardicanute hath taken possession of him, and he hath no pleasure save
to fill, to swill, and to call for more.--alas!” said he, looking at
athelstane

 with compassion, “that so dull a spirit should be lodged in
so goodly a form! alas! that such an enterprise as the regeneration of
england should turn on a hinge so imperfect! wedded to rowena, indeed,
her nobler and more generous soul may yet awake the better nature which
is torpid within him. yet how should this be, while rowena, athelstane,
and i myself, remain the prisoners of this brutal marauder and have
been made so perhaps from a sense of the dangers which our liberty might
bring to the usurped power of his nation?”

while the saxon was plunged in these painful reflections, the door of
their prison opened, and gave entrance to a sewer, holding his white rod
of office. this important person advanced into the chamber with a grave
pace, followed by four attendants, bearing in a table covered
with dishes, the sight and smell o

f which seemed to be an instant
compensation to athelstane for all the inconvenience he had undergone.
the persons who attended on the feast were masked and cloaked.

“what mummery is this?” said cedric; “think you that we are ignorant
whose prisoners we are, when we are in the castle of your master?
tell him,” he continued, willing to use this opportunity to open
a negotiation for his freedom,--“tell your master, reginald
front-de-boeuf, that we know no reason he can have for withholding our
liberty, excepting his unlawful desire to enrich h

tell him that we yield to his rapacity, as in similar circumstances we
should do to that of a literal robber. let him name the ransom at which
he rates our liberty, and it shall be paid, providing the exaction is
suited to our means.” the sewer made no answer, but bowed his head.

“and tell sir reginald front-de-boeuf,” said athelstane, “that i send
him my mortal defiance, and challenge him to combat with me, on foot or
horseback, at any secure place, within eight days after our liberation;
which, if he be a true knight, he will not, under these circumstances,
venture to refuse or to delay.”

“i shall deliver to the knight your defiance,” answered the sewer;
“meanwhile i leave you to your food.”

the challenge of athelstane was delivered with no good grace; for a
large mouthful, which required the exercise of both

 jaws at once, added
to a natural hesitation, considerably damped the effect of the bold
defiance it contained. still, however, his speech was hailed by cedric
as an incontestible token of reviving spirit in his companion, whose
previous indifference had begun, notwithstanding his respect for
athelstane’s descent, to wear out his patience. but he now cordially
shook hands with him in token of his approbation, and was somewhat
grieved when athelstane observed, “that he would fight a dozen such men
as front-de-boeuf, if, by so doing, he could hasten his departure from
a dungeon where they put so much garlic into their pottage.”
 notwithstanding this intimation of a relapse into the apathy of
sensuality, cedric placed himself opposite to athelstane, and soon
showed, that if the distresses of his country could banish the
recollection of food while the table was uncovered, yet no sooner were
the victuals put there, than he proved that the a

“then trust him not with thy purpose in words,” answered the templar.
“let him carry a written order to de bracy’s company of free companions,
to repair instantly to their master’s aid. in the meantime, and that the
shaveling may suspect nothing, permit him to go freely about his task of
preparing these saxon hogs for the slaughter-house.”

“it shall be so,” said front-de-boeuf. and he forthwith appointed a
domestic to conduct wamba to the apartment where cedric and athelstane
were confined.

the impatience of cedric had been rather enhanced than diminished by his
confinement. he walked from one end of the hall to the other, with the
attitude of one who advances to charge an enemy, or to storm the breach
of a beleaguered place, sometimes ejaculating to himself, sometimes
addressing athelstane, who stoutly and stoically awaited the issue of
the adventure, digesting, in the meantime, with great composure, the
liberal meal which he had made at noon, and not greatly inte

art thou come hither?”

“to bid you prepare yourselves for death,” answered the jester.

“it is impossible!” replied cedric, starting. “fearless and wicked as
they are, they dare not attempt such open and gratuitous cruelty!”

“alas!” said the jester, “to restrain them by their sense of humanity,
is the same as to stop a runaway horse with a bridle of silk thread.
bethink thee, therefore, noble cedric, and you also, gallant athelstane,
what crimes you have committed in the flesh; for this very day will ye
be called to answer at a higher tribunal.”

“hearest thou this, athelstane?” said cedric; “we must rouse up our
hearts to this last action, since better it is we should die like men,
than live like slaves.”

“i am ready,” answered athelstane, “to stand the worst of their malice,
and shall walk to my death with as much composure as ever i did to my
dinner.”

“let us then unto our holy gear, father,” sai

“leave thee in my stead!” said cedric, astonished at the proposal; “why,
they would hang thee, my poor knave.”

“e’en let them do as they are permitted,” said wamba; “i trust--no
disparagement to your birth--that the son of witless may hang in a chain
with as much gravity as the chain hung upon his ancestor the alderman.”

“well, wamba,” answered cedric, “for one thing will i grant thy request.
and that is, if thou wilt make the exchange of garments with lord
athelstane instead of me.”

“no, by st dunstan,” answered wamba; “there were little reason in that.
good right there is, that the son of witless should suffer to save
the son of hereward; but little wisdom there were in his dying for the
benefit of one whose fathers were strangers to his.”

“villain,” said cedric, “the fathers of athelstane were monarchs of
england!”

“they might be whomsoever they pleased,” replied wamba; “but my neck
stands too straight upon my shoulders to have

it twisted for their sake.
wherefore, good my master, either take my proffer yourself, or suffer me
to leave this dungeon as free as i entered.”

“let the old tree wither,” continued cedric, “so the stately hope of the
forest be preserved. save the noble athelstane, my trusty wamba! it is
the duty of each who has saxon blood in his veins. thou and i will abide
together the utmost rage of our injurious oppressors, while he, free and
safe, shall arouse the awakened spirits of our countrymen to avenge us.”

“not so, father cedric,” said athelstane, grasping his hand,--for, when
roused to think or act, his deeds and sentiments were not unbecoming his
high race--“not so,” he continued; “i would rather remain in this hall
a week without food save th

e prisoner’s stinted loaf, or drink save
the prisoner’s measure of water, than embrace the opportunity to escape
which the slave’s untaught kindness has purveyed for his master.”

“you are called wise men, sirs,” said the jester, “and i a crazed fool;
but, uncle cedric, and cousin athelstane, the fool shall decide this
controversy for ye, and save ye the trouble of straining courtesies any
farther. i am like john-a-duck’s mare, that will let no man mount
her but john-a-duck. i came to save my master, and if he will not
consent--basta--i can but go away home again. kind service cannot be
chucked from hand to hand like a shuttlecock or stool-ball. i’ll hang
for no man but my own born master.”

“go, then, noble cedric,” said athelstane, “neglect not this
opportunity. your

retion. and so
farewell, master, and be kind to poor gurth and his dog fangs; and let
my cockscomb hang in the hall at rotherwood, in memory that i flung away
my life for my master, like a faithful---fool.”

the last word came out with a sort of double expression, betwixt jest
and earnest. the tears stood in cedric’s eyes.

“thy memory shall be preserved,” he said, “while fidelity and affection
have honour upon earth! but that i trust i shall find the means of
saving rowena, and thee, athelstane, and thee, also, my poor wamba, thou
shouldst not overbear me in this matter.”

the exchange of dress was now accomplished, when a sudden doubt struck
cedric.

“i know no language,” he said, “but my own, and a few words of their
mincing norman. how shall i bear myself like a reverend brother?”

“the spell lies in two words,” replied wamba--“‘pax vobiscum’ will
answer all queries. if you go or come, eat or drink, bless or ban, ‘pax

be doubted they may, i will try its weight upon the finisher of the
sentence.”

“if such prove the case,” said the master, “my religious orders are soon
taken--‘pax vobiscum’. i trust i shall remember the pass-word.--noble
athelstane, farewell; and farewell, my poor boy, whose heart might make
amends for a weaker head--i will save you, or return and die with you.
the royal blood of our saxon kings shall not be spilt while mine beats
in my veins; nor shall one hair fall from the head of the kind knave
who risked himself for his master, if cedric’s peril can prevent
it.--farewell.”

“farewell, noble cedric,” said athelstane; “remember it is the true part
of a friar to accept refreshment, if you are offered any.”

battlements, “send me an arrow through yon monk’s frock!--yet stay,” he
said, as his retainers were bending their bows, “it avails not--we must

his commands were obeyed; and, upon entering that gothic apartment, hung
with many spoils won by his own valour and that of his father, he found

handing the cup to him, “rinse thy throat with that noble liquor, and
rouse up thy soul to say what thou wilt do for thy liberty.”

“what a man of mould may,” answered athelstane, “providing it be what a
man of manhood ought.--dismiss me free, with my companions, and i will
pay a ransom of a thousand marks.”

“and wilt moreover assure us the retreat of that scum of mankind who
are swarming around the castle, contrary to god’s peace and the king’s?”
 said front-de-boeuf.

“in so far as i can,” answered athelstane, “i will withdraw them; and i

“we are agreed then,” said front-de-boeuf--“thou and they are to be set
at freedom, and peace is to be on both sides, for payment of a thousand
marks. it is a trifling ransom, saxon, and thou wilt owe gratitude to
the moderation which accepts of it in exchange of your persons. but

“i were unworthy to be called christian, if they did,” replied
athelstane: “deal with the unbelievers as ye list.”

“neither does the ransom include the lady rowena,” said de bracy. “it
shall never be said i was scared out of a fair prize without striking a
blow for it.”

“neither,” said front-de-boeuf, “does our treaty refer to this wretched
jester, whom i retain, that i may make him an example to every knave who
turns jest into earnest.”

“the lady rowena,” answered athelstane, with the most steady
countenance, “is my affianced bride. i wi

like thee?” said de bracy; “saxon, thou dreamest that the days of thy
seven kingdoms are returned again. i tell thee, the princes of the house
of anjou confer not their wards on men of such lineage as thine.”

“my lineage, proud norman,” replied athelstane, “is drawn from a source
more pure and ancient than that of a beggarly frenchman, whose living
is won by selling the blood of the thieves whom he assembles under his
paltry standard. kings were my ancestors, strong in war and wise in

“thou hast it, de bracy,” said front-de-boeuf, well pleased with the
rebuff which his companion had received; “the saxon hath hit thee
fairly.”

“as fairly as a captive can strike,” said de bracy, with apparent
carelessness; “for he whose hands are tied should have his tongue at
freedom.--but thy glibness of reply, comrade,” rejoined he, speaking to
athelstane, “will not win the freedom of the lady rowena.”

to this athelstane, who had already made a longer speech than was his
custom to do on any topic, however interesting, returned no answer. the
conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a menial, who announced
that a monk demanded admittance at the postern gate.

“in the name of saint bennet, the prince of these bull-beggars,” said
front-de-boeuf, “have we a real monk this time, or another impostor?
search him, slaves--for an ye suffer a second impostor to be palmed

this be not a real shaveling. your squire jocelyn knows him well, and
will vouch him to be brother ambrose, a monk in attendance upon the

“admit him,” said front-de-boeuf; “most likely he brings us news from
his jovial master. surely the devil keeps holiday, and the priests are
relieved from duty, that they are strolling thus wildly through the
country. remove these prisoners; and, saxon, think on what thou hast
heard.”

“i claim,” said athelstane, “an honourable imprisonment, with due care
of my board and of my couch, as becomes my rank, and as is due to one
who is in treaty for ransom. moreover, i hold him that deems himself the
best of you, bound to answer to me with his body for this aggression on
my freedom. this defiance hath already been sent to thee by thy sewer;
thou underliest it, and art bound to answer me--there lies my glove.”

“i answer not the challenge of my prisoner,” said front-de-boeuf;
“nor shalt thou, mauri

“but that you may be able to do so,” said rebecca touching his shoulder
with her hand, “you must now observe my directions, and remain quiet.”

“true, maiden,” said ivanhoe, “as quiet as these disquieted times will
permit--and of cedric and his household?”

“his steward came but brief while since,” said the jewess, “panting with
haste, to ask my father for certain monies, the price of wool the growth
of cedric’s flocks, and from him i learned that cedric and athelstane
of coningsburgh had left prince john’s lodging in high displeasure, and
were about to set forth on their return homeward.”

“went any lady with them to the banquet?” said wilfred.

“the lady rowena,” said rebecca, answering the question with more
precision than it had been asked--“the lady rowena went not to the
prince’s feast, and, as the steward reported to us, she is now on her
journey back to rotherwood, with her guardian cedric. and touching your
faithful squire gurth---”

circumstance only even the entreaties of rebecca were unable to secure
sufficient attention to the accommodation of the wounded knight. isaac,
like the enriched traveller of juvenal’s tenth satire, had ever the fear
of robbery before his eyes, conscious that he would be alike accounted
fair game by the marauding norman noble, and by the saxon outlaw. he
therefore journeyed at a great rate, and made short halts, and shorter
repasts, so that he passed by cedric and athelstane who had several
hours the start of him, but who had been delayed by their protracted
feasting at the convent of saint withold’s. yet such was the virtue of
miriam’s balsam, or such the strength of ivanhoe’s constitution, that
he did not sustain from the hurried journey that inconvenience which his
kind physician had apprehended.

in another point of view, however, the jew’s haste proved somewhat more
than good speed. the rapidity with which he insisted on travelling, bred

 strove to avert the blows that were aimed at
his master. the noble saxon was so fortunate as to reach his ward’s
apartment just as she had abandoned all hope of safety, and, with a
crucifix clasped in agony to her bosom, sat in expectation of instant
death. he committed her to the charge of gurth, to be conducted in
safety to the barbican, the road to which was now cleared of the enemy,
and not yet interrupted by the flames. this accomplished, the loyal
cedric hastened in quest of his friend athelstane, determined, at every
risk to himself, to save that last scion of saxon royalty. but ere
cedric penetrated as far as the old hall in which he had himself been
a prisoner, the inventive genius of wamba had procured liberation for
himself and his companion in adversity.

when the noise of the conflict announced that it was at the hottest, the
jester began to shout, with the utmost power of his lungs, “saint george
and the dragon!--bonny saint george for merry england!--the castle is
won!” and

confusion of the bloody fray, showed every attention to her safety.
repeatedly he was by her side, and, neglecting his own defence, held
before her the fence of his triangular steel-plated shield; and anon
starting from his position by her, he cried his war-cry, dashed forward,
struck to earth the most forward of the assailants, and was on the same
instant once more at her bridle rein.

athelstane, who, as the reader knows, was slothful, but not cowardly,
beheld the female form whom the templar protected thus sedulously, and
doubted not that it was rowena whom the knight was carrying off, in
despite of all resistance which could be offered.

“by the soul of saint edward,” he said, “i will rescue her from yonder
over-proud knight, and he shall die by my hand!”

“think what you do!” cried wamba; “hasty hand catches frog for fish--by
my bauble, yonder is none of my lady rowena

loosening the hold which he had hitherto kept upon the saxon’s tunic.

to snatch a mace from the pavement, on which it lay beside one whose
dying grasp had just relinquished it--to rush on the templar’s band, and
to strike in quick succession to the right and left, levelling a warrior
at each blow, was, for athelstane’s great strength, now animated with
unusual fury, but the work of a single moment; he was soon within two
yards of bois-guilbert, whom he defied in his lo

“turn, false-hearted templar! let go her whom thou art unworthy to
touch--turn, limb of a hand of murdering and hypocritical robbers!”

“dog!” said the templar, grinding his teeth, “i will teach thee to
blaspheme the holy order of the temple of zion;” and with these words,
half-wheeling his steed, he made a demi-courbette towards the saxon, and
rising in the stirrups, so as to take full advantage of the descent of
the horse, he discharged a fearful blow upon the head of athelstane.

well said wamba, that silken bonnet keeps out no steel blade. so
trenchant was the templar’s weapon, that it shore asunder, as it had
been a willow twig, the tough and plaited handle of the mace, which the
ill-fated saxon reared to parry the blow, and, descending on his head,
levelled him with the earth.

“‘ha! beau-seant!’” exclaimed bois-guilbert, “thus be it to the
maligners of the temple-knights!” taking advantage of the dismay which
was spread by the fall of athelstane, and

said, turning to the saxon, “that spoil is divided into two portions; do

“they are welcome,” said locksley; “our laws bind none but ourselves.”

“but, thou, my poor knave,” said cedric, turning about and embracing
his jester, “how shall i reward thee, who feared not to give thy body
to chains and death instead of mine!--all forsook me, when the poor fool
was faithful!”

a tear stood in the eye of the rough thane as he spoke--a mark of
feeling which even the death of athelstane had not extracted; but there
was something in the half-instinctive attachment of his clown, that
waked his nature more keenly than even grief itself.

“nay,” said the jester, extricating himself from master’s caress, “if
you pay my service with the water of your eye, the jester must weep
for company, and then what becomes of his vocation?--but, uncle, if you
would indeed pleasure me, i pray you to pardon my playfellow gurth, who

freedom. she herself, richly attired, and mounted on a dark chestnut
palfrey, had recovered all the dignity of her manner, and only an
unwonted degree of paleness showed the sufferings she had undergone. her
lovely brow, though sorrowful, bore on it a cast of reviving hope
for the future, as well as of grateful thankfulness for the past
deliverance--she knew that ivanhoe was safe, and she knew that
athelstane was dead. the former assurance filled her with the most
sincere delight; and if she did not absolutely rejoice at the latter,
she might be pardoned for feeling the full advantage of being freed
from further persecution on the only subject in which she had ever been
contradicted by her guardian cedric.

all his followers, rose to receive her, as if by a general instinct of

greenwood branches, swept slowly round the silvan amphitheatre, and
took the same direction with rowena and her followers. the priests of
a neighbouring convent, in expectation of the ample donation, or
“soul-scat”, which cedric had propined, attended upon the car in which
the body of athelstane was laid, and sang hymns as it was sadly
and slowly borne on the shoulders of his vassals to his castle of
coningsburgh, to be there deposited in the grave of hengist, from whom
the deceased derived his long descent. many of his vassals had assembled
at the news of his death, and followed the bier with all the external
marks, at least, of dejection and sorrow. again the outlaws arose, and
paid the same rude and spontaneous homage to death, which they had

rth, and the magnanimous wamba. it is unnecessary at
present to mention what took place in the interim betwixt wilfred
and his deliverer; suffice it to say, that after long and grave
communication, messengers were dispatched by the prior in several
directions, and that on the succeeding morning the black knight was
about to set forth on his journey, accompanied by the jester wamba, who
attended as his guide.

“we will meet,” he said to ivanhoe, “at coningsburgh, the castle of the
deceased athelstane, since there thy father cedric holds the funeral
feast for his noble relation. i would see your saxon kindred together,
sir wilfred, and become better acquainted with them than heretofore.
thou also wilt meet me; and it shall be my task to reconcile thee to thy
father.”

so saying, he took an affectionate farewell of ivanhoe, who expressed an
anxious desire to attend upon his deliverer. but the black knight would
not listen to the proposal.

“rest this day; thou wilt have scarce strength en

“and i,” said wamba, “will attend you with all my heart. i would fain

and frequent, he will rise from the dead to rebuke cook, sewer, and
cupbearer; and that were a sight worth seeing. always, sir knight, i
will trust your valour with making my excuse to my master cedric, in
case mine own wit should fail.”

“and how should my poor valour succeed, sir jester, when thy light wit

otherwise, may i not aid him were he in danger, by other means than by
force of arms? it is but too well known that the saxons love not the
norman race, and who knows what may be the issue, if he break in upon
them when their hearts are irritated by the death of athelstane,
and their heads heated by the carousal in which they will indulge
themselves? i hold his entrance among them at such a moment most
perilous, and i am resolved to share or avert the danger; which, that i
may the better do, i would crave of thee the use of some palfrey whose

gate was another banner, on which the figure of a white horse,
rudely painted, indicated the nation and rank of the deceased, by the
well-known symbol of hengist and his saxon warriors.

all around the castle was a scene of busy commotion; for such funeral
banquets were times of general and profuse hospitality, which not only
every one who could claim the most distant connexion with the deceased,
but all passengers whatsoever, were invited to partake. the wealth and
consequence of the deceased athelstane, occasioned this custom to be
observed in the fullest extent.

numerous parties, therefore, were seen ascending and descending the hill
on which the castle was situated; and when the king and his attendants
entered the open and unguarded gates of the external barrier, the space
within presented a scene not easily reconciled with the cause of the
assemblage. in one place cooks were toiling to roast huge oxen, and fat
sheep; in another, hogsheads of ale were set abroach, to be drained at

mendicants were of course assembled by the score, together with
strolling soldiers returned from palestine, (according to their own
account at least,) pedlars were displaying their wares, travelling
mechanics were enquiring after employment, and wandering palmers,
hedge-priests, saxon minstrels, and welsh bards, were muttering prayers,
and extracting mistuned dirges from their harps, crowds, and rotes. [58]

one sent forth the praises of athelstane in a doleful panegyric;
another, in a saxon genealogical poem, rehearsed the uncouth and harsh
names of his noble ancestry. jesters and jugglers were not awanting,
nor was the occasion of the assembly supposed to render the exercise of
their profession indecorous or improper. indeed the ideas of the saxons
on these occasions were as natural as they were rude. if sorrow was
thirsty, there was drink--if hungry, there was food--if it sunk down
upon and saddened the heart, here were the means suppl

n each side of this bier
kneeled three priests, who told their beads, and muttered their prayers,
with the greatest signs of external devotion. for this service a
splendid “soul-scat” was paid to the convent of saint edmund’s by the
mother of the deceased; and, that it might be fully deserved, the whole
brethren, saving the lame sacristan, had transferred themselves to
coningsburgh, where, while six of their number were constantly on guard
in the performance of divine rites by the bier of athelstane, the others
failed not to take their share of the refreshments and amusements which
went on at the castle. in maintaining this pious watch and ward, the
good monks were particularly careful not to interrupt their hymns for
an instant, lest zernebock, the ancient saxon apollyon, should lay
his clutches on the departed athelstane. nor were they less careful to
prevent any unhallowed layman from touching the pall, which, having been

if handled by the profane. if, in truth, these attentions could be of
any use to the deceased, he had some right to expect them at the hands
of the brethren of saint edmund’s, since, besides a hundred mancuses
of gold paid down as the soul-ransom, the mother of athelstane had
announced her intention of endowing that foundation with the better part
of the lands of the deceased, in order to maintain perpetual prayers for
his soul, and that of her departed husband. richard and wilfred followed
the saxon cedric into the apartment of death, where, as their guide
pointed with solemn air to the untimely bier of athelstane, they
followed his example in devoutly crossing themselves, and muttering a
brief prayer for the weal of the departed soul.

“these are worthy strangers, come to take a part in thy sorrows. and
this, in especial, is the valiant knight who fought so bravely for the
deliverance of him for whom we this day mourn.”

“his bravery has my thanks,” returned the lady; “although it be the
will of heaven that it should be displayed in vain. i thank, too, his
courtesy, and that of his companion, which hath brought them hither to
behold the widow of adeling, the mother of athelstane, in her deep hour
of sorrow and lamentation. to your care, kind kinsman, i intrust them,
satisfied that they will want no hospitality which these sad walls can
yet afford.”

the guests bowed deeply to the mourning parent, and withdrew from their
hospitable guide.

another winding stair conducted them to an apartment of the same size
with that which they had first entered, occupying indeed the story
immediately above. from this room, ere yet the door was opened,
proceeded a low and melancholy

while this dirge was sung, in a low and melancholy tone, by the female
choristers, the others were divided into two bands, of which one was
engaged in bedecking, with such embroidery as their skill and taste
could compass, a large silken pall, destined to cover the bier of
athelstane, while the others busied themselves in selecting, from
baskets of flowers placed before them, garlands, which they intended for
the same mournful purpose. the behaviour of the maidens was decorous, if
not marked with deep affliction; but now and then a whisper or a smile
called forth the rebuke of the severer matrons, and here and there might
be seen a damsel more interested in endeavouring to find out how her
mourning-robe became her, than in the dismal ceremony for which they
were preparing.

a graceful
courtesy. her demeanour was serious, but not dejected; and it may be
doubted whether thoughts of ivanhoe, and of the uncertainty of his
fate, did not claim as great a share in her gravity as the death of her
kinsman.

to cedric, however, who, as we have observed, was not remarkably
clear-sighted on such occasions, the sorrow of his ward seemed so
much deeper than any of the other maidens, that he deemed it proper
to whisper the explanation--“she was the affianced bride of the noble
athelstane.”--it may be doubted whether this communication went a far
way to increase wilfred’s disposition to sympathize with the mourners of
coningsburgh.

having thus formally introduced the guests to the different chambers in
which the obsequies of athelstane were celebrated under different forms,
cedric conducted them into a small room, destined, as he informed them,
for the exclusive accomodation of honourable guests, whose more slight
connexion with the deceased might render them unwilling to j

very accommodation, and was about to withdraw when the black knight
took his hand.

“i crave to remind you, noble thane,” he said, “that when we last
parted, you promised, for the service i had the fortune to render you,
to grant me a boon.”

“it is granted ere named, noble knight,” said cedric; “yet, at this sad
moment---”

“of that also,” said the king, “i have bethought me--but my time is
brief--neither does it seem to me unfit, that, when closing the grave on
the noble athelstane, we should deposit therein certain prejudices and
hasty opinions.”

“sir knight of the fetterlock,” said cedric, colouring, and interrupting
the king in his turn, “i trust your boon regards yourself and no other;
for in that which concerns the honour of my house, it is scarce fitting
that a stranger should mingle.”

“nor do i wish to mingle,” said the king, mildly, “unless in so far as
you will admit me to have an interest. as yet you have known me but as

decent household. he that would be the son of cedric, must show himself
of english ancestry.--thou art about to speak,” he added, sternly, “and
i guess the topic. the lady rowena must complete two years’ mourning, as
for a betrothed husband--all our saxon ancestors would disown us were
we to treat of a new union for her ere the grave of him she should
have wedded--him, so much the most worthy of her hand by birth and
ancestry--is yet closed. the ghost of athelstane himself would burst
his bloody cerements and stand before us to forbid such dishonour to his
memory.”

it seemed as if cedric’s words had raised a spectre; for, scarce had
he uttered them ere the door flew open, and athelstane, arrayed in
the garments of the grave, stood before them, pale, haggard, and like
something arisen from the dead! [59]

the effect of this apparition on the persons present was utterly
appalling. cedric started back as far as the wall of the apartment would
permit, an

in the meantime, a horrible noise was heard below stairs, some crying,
“secure the treacherous monks!”--others, “down with them into the
dungeon!”--others, “pitch them from the highest battlements!”

“in the name of god!” said cedric, addressing what seemed the spectre of
his departed friend, “if thou art mortal, speak!--if a departed spirit,
say for what cause thou dost revisit us, or if i can do aught that can
set thy spirit at repose.--living or dead, noble athelstane, speak to
cedric!”

“i will,” said the spectre, very composedly, “when i have collected
breath, and when you give me time--alive, saidst thou?--i am as much
alive as he can be who has fed on bread and water for three days, which
seem three ages--yes, bread and water, father cedric! by heaven, and all
saints in it, better food hath not passed my weasand for three livelong
days, and by god’s providence it is that i am now here to tell it.”

“why, noble athelstane,” said the black

knight, “i myself saw you struck

and as i thought, and wamba reported, your skull was cloven through the

“you thought amiss, sir knight,” said athelstane, “and wamba lied. my
teeth are in good order, and that my supper shall presently find--no
thanks to the templar though, whose sword turned in his hand, so that
the blade struck me flatlings, being averted by the handle of the good
mace with which i warded the blow; had my steel-cap been on, i had not
valued it a rush, and had dealt him such a counter-buff as would have
spoilt his retreat. but as it was, down i went, stunned, indeed, but

strange thoughts of what had befallen me, when the door of my dungeon
creaked, and two villain monks entered. they would have persuaded me i
was in purgatory, but i knew too well the pursy short-breathed voice of
the father abbot.--saint jeremy! how different from that tone with which
he used to ask me for another slice of the haunch!--the dog has feasted
with me from christmas to twelfth-night.”

“have patience, noble athelstane,” said the king, “take breath--tell
your story at leisure--beshrew me but such a tale is as well worth
listening to as a romance.”

“ay but, by the rood of bromeholm, there was no romance in the matter!”
 said athelstane.--“a barley loaf and a pitcher of water--that they gave
me, the niggardly traitors, whom my father, and i myself, had enriched,
when their best resources were the flitches of bacon and measures of
corn, out of which they wheedled poor serfs and bondsmen, in exchange

“but, in the name of our lady, noble athelstane,” said cedric, grasping
the hand of his friend, “how didst thou escape this imminent danger--did
their hearts relent?”

“did their hearts relent!” echoed athelstane.--“do rocks melt with the
sun? i should have been there still, had not some stir in the convent,
which i find was their procession hitherward to eat my funeral feast,
when they well knew how and where i had been buried alive, summoned the
swarm out of their hive. i heard them droning out their death-psalms,
little judging they were sung in respect for my soul by those who
were thus famishing my body. they went, however, and i waited long for

the light, the food, the wine, set my invention to work. the staple to
which my chains were fixed, was more rusted than i or the villain abbot
had supposed. even iron could not remain without consuming in the damps
of that infernal dungeon.”

“take breath, noble athelstane,” said richard, “and partake of some
refreshment, ere you proceed with a tale so dreadful.”

“partake!” quoth athelstane; “i have been partaking five times
to-day--and yet a morsel of that savoury ham were not altogether foreign
to the matter; and i pray you, fair sir, to do me reason in a cup of
wine.”

the guests, though still agape with astonishment, pledged their
resuscitated landlord, who thus proceeded in his story:--he had indeed
now many more auditors than those to whom it

having given certain necessary orders for arranging matters within
the castle, had followed the dead-alive up to the stranger’s apartment
attended by as many of the guests, male and female, as could squeeze
into the small room, while others, crowding the staircase, caught up
an erroneous edition of the story, and transmitted it still more
inaccurately to those beneath, who again sent it forth to the vulgar
without, in a fashion totally irreconcilable to the real fact.
athelstane, however, went on as follows, with the history of his
escape:--

“finding myself freed from the staple, i dragged myself up stairs as
well as a man loaded with shackles, and emaciated with fasting, might;
and after much groping about, i was at length directed, by the sound of
a jolly roundelay, to the apartment where the worthy sacristan, an it

fashion of my grave-clothes, as well as the clanking of my chains, made
me more resemble an inhabitant of the other world than of this. both
stood aghast; but when i knocked down the sacristan with my fist,
the other fellow, his pot-companion, fetched a blow at me with a huge
quarter-staff.”

“this must be our friar tuck, for a count’s ransom,” said richard,
looking at ivanhoe.

“he may be the devil, an he will,” said athelstane. “fortunately he
missed the aim; and on my approaching to grapple with him, took to his
heels and ran for it. i failed not to set my own heels at liberty by
means of the fetter-key, which hung amongst others at the sexton’s belt;
and i had thoughts of beating out the knave’s brains with the bunch of
keys, but gratitude for the nook of pasty and the flask of wine which
the rascal had imparted to my captivity, came over my heart; so, with a
brace of hearty kicks, i left him on the floor, po

tregetour’s mummery, and so i got admission, and did but disclose myself
to my mother, and eat a hasty morsel, ere i came in quest of you, my
noble friend.”

“and you have found me,” said cedric, “ready to resume our brave
projects of honour and liberty. i tell thee, never will dawn a morrow so
auspicious as the next, for the deliverance of the noble saxon race.”

“talk not to me of delivering any one,” said athelstane; “it is well i
am delivered myself. i am more intent on punishing that villain abbot.
he shall hang on the top of this castle of coningsburgh, in his cope and
stole; and if the stairs be too strait to admit his fat carcass, i will
have him craned up from without.”

“but, my son,” said edith, “consider his sacred office.”

“consider my three days’ fast,” replied athelstane; “i will have their
blood every one of them. front-de-boeuf was burnt alive for a less
matter, for he ke

slaves, so often the self-invited flatterers at my board, who gave
me neither pottage nor garlic, more or less, they die, by the soul of

“but the pope, my noble friend,”--said cedric--

“but the devil, my noble friend,”--answered athelstane; “they die, and
no more of them. were they the best monks upon earth, the world would go
on without them.”

“for shame, noble athelstane,” said cedric; “forget such wretches in the
career of glory which lies open before thee. tell this norman prince,
richard of anjou, that, lion-hearted as he is, he shall not hold
undisputed the throne of alfred, while a male descendant of the holy
confessor lives to dispute it.”

“how!” said athelstane, “is this the noble king richard?”

it is richard plantagenet himself,” said cedric; “yet i need not remind
thee that, coming hither a guest of free-will, he may neither be injured
nor detained prisoner--thou well knowest thy duty to him as his host.”

“ay, by my faith!” said athelstane; “and my duty as a subject besides,
for i here tender him my allegiance, heart and hand.”

“my son,” said edith, “think on thy royal rights!”

“think on the freedom of england, degenerate prince!” said cedric.

“mother and friend,” said athelstane, “a truce to your
upbraidings--bread and water and a dungeon are marvellous mortifiers of
ambition, and i rise from the tomb a wiser man than i descended into
it. one half of those vain follies were puffed into mine ear by that

and starvation; besides that they can only end in the murder of some

and nowhere else; and my first act of dominion shall be to hang the
abbot.”

“and my ward rowena,” said cedric--“i trust you intend not to desert
her?”

“father cedric,” said athelstane, “be reasonable. the lady rowena cares
not for me--she loves the little finger of my kinsman wilfred’s glove
better than my whole person. there she stands to avouch it--nay, blush
not, kinswoman, there is no shame in loving a courtly knight better than
a country franklin--and do not laugh neither, rowena, for grave-clothes
and a thin visage are, god knows, no matter of merriment--nay, an thou
wilt needs laugh, i will find thee a better jest--give me thy hand, or
rather lend it me, for i but

cousin wilfred of ivanhoe, in thy favour i renounce and abjure---hey!
by saint dunstan, our cousin wilfred hath vanished!--yet, unless my eyes
are still dazzled with the fasting i have undergone, i saw him stand
there but even now.”

all now looked around and enquired for ivanhoe, but he had vanished.
it was at length discovered that a jew had been to seek him; and that,
after very brief conference, he had called for gurth and his armour, and
had left the castle.

“fair cousin,” said athelstane to rowena, “could i think that this
sudden disappearance of ivanhoe was occasioned by other than the
weightiest reason, i would myself resume--”

but he had no sooner let go her hand, on first observing that ivanhoe
had disappeared, than rowena, who had found her situation extremely
embarrassing, had taken the first opportunity to escape from the
apartment.

“certainly,” quoth athelstane, “women are the least to be trusted of all
animals, monks and abbots excepted. i am an infidel, if

but king richard was gone also, and no one knew whither. at length it
was learned that he had hastened to the court-yard, summoned to his
presence the jew who had spoken with ivanhoe, and after a moment’s
speech with him, had called vehemently to horse, thrown himself upon a
steed, compelled the jew to mount another, and set off at a rate, which,
according to wamba, rendered the old jew’s neck not worth a penny’s
purchase.

“by my halidome!” said athelstane, “it is certain that zernebock
hath possessed himself of my castle in my absence. i return in my
grave-clothes, a pledge restored from the very sepulchre, and every one
i speak to vanishes as soon as they hear my voice!--but it skills not
talking of it. come, my friends--such of you as are left, follow me to
the banquet-hall, lest any more of us disappear--it is, i trust, as yet

at they were actually the familiar spirits with whom the witch had
communed, and who, her time being out, stood ready to assist in her
dreadful punishment. they whispered to each other, and communicated all
the feats which satan had performed during that busy and unhappy period,
not failing, of course, to give the devil rather more than his due.

“have you not heard, father dennet,” quoth one boor to another advanced
in years, “that the devil has carried away bodily the great saxon thane,
athelstane of coningsburgh?”

“ay, but he brought him back though, by the blessing of god and saint
dunstan.”

“how’s that?” said a brisk young fellow, dressed in a green cassock
embroidered with gold, and having at his heels a stout lad bearing a
harp upon his back, which betrayed his vocation. the minstrel seemed
of no vulgar rank; for, besides the splendour of his gaily braidered
doublet, he wore around his neck a silver chain, by which hung the
“wrest”, or key, with which he tuned his

harp. on his right arm was a
silver plate, which, instead of bearing, as usual, the cognizance or
badge of the baron to whose family he belonged, had barely the word
sherwood engraved upon it.--“how mean you by that?” said the gay
minstrel, mingling in the conversation of the peasants; “i came to seek
one subject for my rhyme, and, by’r lady, i were glad to find two.”

“it is well avouched,” said the elder peasant, “that after athelstane of
coningsburgh had been dead four weeks--”

“that is impossible,” said the minstrel; “i saw him in life at the
passage of arms at ashby-de-la-zouche.”

“dead, however, he was, or else translated,” said the younger peasant;
“for i heard the monks of saint edmund’s singing the death’s hymn for
him; and, moreover, there was a rich death-meal and dole at the castle
of coningsburgh, as right was; and thither had i gone, but for mabel
parkins, who--”

a merry, who will flourish a quarter-staff, draw a bow, and dance a

“that last part of thy speech, dennet,” said the minstrel, “has saved
thee a rib or twain.”

“tush, man, i fear him not,” said dennet; “i am somewhat old and stiff,
but when i fought for the bell and ram at doncaster--”

“but the story--the story, my friend,” again said the minstrel.

“why, the tale is but this--athelstane of coningsburgh was buried at
saint edmund’s.”

“that’s a lie, and a loud one,” said the friar, “for i saw him borne to
his own castle of coningsburgh.”

“nay, then, e’en tell the story yourself, my masters,” said dennet,
turning sulky at these repeated contradictions; and it was with some
difficulty that the boor could be prevailed on, by the request of
his comrade and the minstrel, to renew his tale.--“these two ‘sober’

for the best part for a summer’s day, when they were aroused by a
deep groan, and a clanking of chains, and the figure of the deceased
athelstane entered the apartment, saying, ‘ye evil shep-herds!--’”

“it is false,” said the friar, hastily, “he never spoke a word.”

“so ho! friar tuck,” said the minstrel, drawing him apart from the
rustics; “we have started a new hare, i find.”

“i tell thee, allan-a-dale,” said the hermit, “i saw athelstane of

y in england;
for, whatever head the saxons might have made in the event of a civil
war, it was plain that nothing could be done under the undisputed
dominion of richard, popular as he was by his personal good qualities
and military fame, although his administration was wilfully careless,
now too indulgent, and now allied to despotism.

but, moreover, it could not escape even cedric’s reluctant observation,
that his project for an absolute union among the saxons, by the marriage
of rowena and athelstane, was now completely at an end, by the mutual
dissent of both parties concerned. this was, indeed, an event which, in
his ardour for the saxon cause, he could not have anticipated, and even
when the disinclination of both was broadly and plainly manifested, he
could scarce bring himself to believe that two saxons of royal descent
should scruple, on personal grounds, at an alliance so necessary for the
public weal of the nation. but it was not the less certain: rowena had
always expressed her rep

ugnance to athelstane, and now athelstane was
no less plain and positive in proclaiming his resolution never to pursue
his addresses to the lady rowena. even the natural obstinacy of cedric
sunk beneath these obstacles, where he, remaining on the point of
junction, had the task of dragging a reluctant pair up to it, one with
each hand. he made, however, a last vigorous attack on athelstane, and
he found that resuscitated sprout of saxon royalty engaged, like country
squires of our own day, in a furious war with the clergy.

it seems that, after all his deadly menaces against the abbot of saint
edmund’s, athelstane’s spirit of revenge, what between the natural
indolent kindness of his own disposition, what through the prayers of
his mother edith, attached, like most ladies, (of the period,) to the
clerical order, had terminated in his keeping the abbot and his monks in
the dun

geons of coningsburgh for three days on a meagre diet. for this
atrocity the abbot menaced him with excommunication, and made out a
dreadful list of complaints in the bowels and stomach, suffered by
himself and his monks, in consequence of the tyrannical and unjust
imprisonment they had sustained. with this controversy, and with the
means he had adopted to counteract this clerical persecution, cedric
found the mind of his friend athelstane so fully occupied, that it had
no room for another idea. and when rowena’s name was mentioned the noble
athelstane prayed leave to quaff a full goblet to her health, and that
she might soon be the bride of his kinsman wilfred. it was a desperate
case therefore. there was obviously no more to be made of athelstane;
or, as wamba expressed it, in a phrase which has descended from saxon
times to ours, he was a cock that would not fight.

there remained betwixt cedric and the determination which t
