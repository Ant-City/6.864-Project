Enobarbus - 
                 Antony's
most loyal supporter. Worldly and cynical, Enobarbus is friendly
with the subordinates of both Pompey and Caesar, yet stays faithful
to his master even after Antony makes grave political and military missteps.
He abandons Antony only when the general appears to be completely
finished.
