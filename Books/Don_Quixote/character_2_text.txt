offspring, full of thoughts of all sorts and such as never came into any

 he strove to adapt it so as
to indicate what he had been before belonging to a knight-errant, and
what he then was; for it was only reasonable that, his master taking a
new character, he should take a new name, and that it should be a
distinguished and full-sounding one, befitting the new order and calling
he was about to follow. and so, after having composed, struck out,
rejected, added to, unmade, and remade a multitude of names out of his
memory and fancy, he decided upon calling him rocinante, a name, to his
thinking, lofty, sonorous, and significant of his condition as a hack
before he became what he now was, the first and foremost of all the hacks
in the world.

having got a name for his horse so much to his taste, he was anxious to
get one for himself, and he was eight days more pondering over this
point, till at last he made up his mind to call himself "don quixote,"
whence, as has been already said, the authors of this veracious history
have inferred that his name must

execution of his design, urged on to it by the thought of all the world
was losing by his delay, seeing what wrongs he intended to right,
grievances to redress, injustices to repair, abuses to remove, and duties
to discharge. so, without giving notice of his intention to anyone, and
without anybody seeing him, one morning before the dawning of the day
(which was one of the hottest of the month of july) he donned his suit of
armour, mounted rocinante with his patched-up helmet on, braced his
buckler, took his lance, and by the back door of the yard sallied forth
upon the plain in the highest contentment and satisfaction at seeing with
what ease he had made a beginning with his grand purpose. but scarcely
did he find himself upon the open plain, when a terrible thought struck
him, one all but enough to make him abandon the enterprise at the very
outset. it occurred to him that he had not been dubbed a knight, and that

alt that night at the inn;
and as, happen what might to our adventurer, everything he saw or imaged
seemed to him to be and to happen after the fashion of what he read of,
the moment he saw the inn he pictured it to himself as a castle with its
four turrets and pinnacles of shining silver, not forgetting the
drawbridge and moat and all the belongings usually ascribed to castles of
the sort. to this inn, which to him seemed a castle, he advanced, and at
a short distance from it he checked rocinante, hoping that some dwarf
would show himself upon the battlements, and by sound of trumpet give
notice that a knight was approaching the castle. but seeing that they
were slow about it, and that rocinante was in a hurry to reach the
stable, he made for the inn door, and perceived the two gay damsels who
were standing there, and who seemed to him to be two fair maidens or
lovely ladies taking their ease at the castle gate.

at this moment it so happened that a swineherd who was going throu

oddest figure that can be imagined; and while they were removing his

belonging to the castle, he said to them with great sprightliness:

he asked her name, and she said it was la molinera, and that she was the
daughter of a respectable miller of antequera; and of her likewise don
quixote requested that she would adopt the "don" and call herself dona
molinera, making offers to her further services and favours.

having thus, with hot haste and speed, brought to a conclusion these
never-till-now-seen ceremonies, don quixote was on thorns until he saw
himself on horseback sallying forth in quest of adventures; and saddling
rocinante at once he mounted, and embracing his host, as he returned
thanks for his kindness in knighting him, he addressed him in language so
extraordinary that it is impossible to convey an idea of it or report it.
the landlord, to get him out of the inn, replied with no less rhetoric
though with shorter words, and without calling upon him to pay the
reckoning let him go with a godspeed.

t, that his joy was like
to burst his horse-girths. however, recalling the advice of his host as
to the requisites he ought to carry with him, especially that referring
to money and shirts, he determined to go home and provide himself with
all, and also with a squire, for he reckoned upon securing a
farm-labourer, a neighbour of his, a poor man with a family, but very
well qualified for the office of squire to a knight. with this object he
turned his horse's head towards his village, and rocinante, thus reminded
of his old quarters, stepped out so briskly that he hardly seemed to
tread the earth.

he had not gone far, when out of a thicket on his right there seemed to
come feeble cries as of some one in distress, and the instant he heard
them he exclaimed, "thanks be to heaven for the favour it accords me,
that it so soon offers me an opportunity of fulfilling the obligation i
have undertaken, and gathering the fruit of my ambition. these cries, no
doubt, come from some man or w

oman in want of help, and needing my aid
and protection;" and wheeling, he turned rocinante in the direction
whence the cries seemed to proceed. he had gone but a few paces into the
wood, when he saw a mare tied to an oak, and tied to another, and
stripped from the waist upwards, a youth of about fifteen years of age,
from whom the cries came. nor were they without cause, for a lusty farmer
was flogging him with a belt and following up every blow with scoldings
and commands, repeating, "your mouth shut and your eyes open!" while the
youth made answer, "i won't do it again, mast

 by the same oath i swear to come back and hunt you out and punish
you; and i shall find you though you should lie closer than a lizard. and
if you desire to know who it is lays this command upon you, that you be
more firmly bound to obey it, know that i am the valorous don quixote of
la mancha, the undoer of wrongs and injustices; and so, god be with you,
and keep in mind what you have promised and sworn under those penalties
that have been already declared to you."

so saying, he gave rocinante the spur and was soon out of reach. the
farmer followed him with his eyes, and when he saw that he had cleared
the wood and was no longer in sight, he turned to his boy andres, and
said, "come here, my son, i want to pay you what i owe you, as that
undoer of wrongs has commanded me."

"my oath on it," said andres, "your worship will be well advised to obey
the command of that good knight--may he live a thousand years--for, as he
is a valiant and just judge, by roque, if you do not pay m

h to-day righted the
greatest wrong and grievance that ever injustice conceived and cruelty
perpetrated: who hath to-day plucked the rod from the hand of yonder
ruthless oppressor so wantonly lashing that tender child."

he now came to a road branching in four directions, and immediately he
was reminded of those cross-roads where knights-errant used to stop to
consider which road they should take. in imitation of them he halted for
a while, and after having deeply considered it, he gave rocinante his
head, submitting his own will to that of his hack, who followed out his
first intention, which was to make straight for his own stable. after he
had gone about two miles don quixote perceived a large party of people,
who, as afterwards appeared, were some toledo traders, on their way to
buy silk at murcia. there were six of them coming along under their
sunshades, with four servants mounted, and three muleteers on foot.
scarcely had don quixote descried them when the fancy possessed

"she distils nothing of the kind, vile rabble," said don quixote, burning
with rage, "nothing of the kind, i say, only ambergris and civet in
cotton; nor is she one-eyed or humpbacked, but straighter than a
guadarrama spindle: but ye must pay for the blasphemy ye have uttered
against beauty like that of my lady."

and so saying, he charged with levelled lance against the one who had
spoken, with such fury and fierceness that, if luck had not contrived
that rocinante should stumble midway and come down, it would have gone
hard with the rash trader. down went rocinante, and over went his master,
rolling along the ground for some distance; and when he tried to rise he
was unable, so encumbered was he with lance, buckler, spurs, helmet, and
the weight of his old armour; and all the while he was struggling to get
up he kept saying, "fly not, cowards and caitiffs! stay, for not by my
fault, but my horse's, am i stretched here."

to all questions the other only went on with his ballad.

seeing this, the good man removed as well as he could his breastplate and
backpiece to see if he had any wound, but he could perceive no blood nor
any mark whatever. he then contrived to raise him from the ground, and
with no little difficulty hoisted him upon his ass, which seemed to him
to be the easiest mount for him; and collecting the arms, even to the
splinters of the lance, he tied them on rocinante, and leading him by the
bridle and the ass by the halter he took the road for the village, very
sad to hear what absurd stuff don quixote was talking.

nor was don quixote less so, for what with blows and bruises he could not
sit upright on the ass, and from time to time he sent up sighs to heaven,
so that once more he drove the peasant to ask what ailed him. and it
could have been only the devil himself that put into his head tales to
match his own adventures, for now, forgetting baldw

on those books of chivalry that have brought your worship to such a
pass."

they carried him to bed at once, and after searching for his wounds could
find none, but he said they were all bruises from having had a severe
fall with his horse rocinante when in combat with ten giants, the biggest
and the boldest to be found on earth.

"so, so!" said the curate, "are there giants in the dance? by the sign of
the cross i will burn them to-morrow before the day over."

they put a host of questions to don quixote, but his only answer to all
was--give him something to eat, and leave him to sleep, for that was what
he needed most. they did so, and the curate questioned the peasant at
great length as to how he had found don quixote. he told

y two leagues long."

"look, your worship," said sancho; "what we see there are not giants but
windmills, and what seem to be their arms are the sails that turned by
the wind make the millstone go."

"it is easy to see," replied don quixote, "that thou art not used to this
business of adventures; those are giants; and if thou art afraid, away
with thee out of this and betake thyself to prayer while i engage them in
fierce and unequal combat."

so saying, he gave the spur to his steed rocinante, heedless of the cries
his squire sancho sent after him, warning him that most certainly they
were windmills and not giants he was going to attack. he, however, was so
positive they were giants that he neither heard the cries of sancho, nor
perceived, near as he was, what they were, but made at them shouting,
"fly not, cowards and vile beings, for a single knight attacks you."

a slight breeze at this moment sprang up, and the great sails began to
move, seeing which don quixote exclaime

so saying, and commending himself with all his heart to his lady
dulcinea, imploring her to support him in such a peril, with lance in
rest and covered by his buckler, he charged at rocinante's fullest gallop
and fell upon the first mill that stood in front of him; but as he drove
his lance-point into the sail the wind whirled it round with such force
that it shivered the lance to pieces, sweeping with it horse and rider,
who went rolling over on the plain, in a sorry condition. sancho hastened
to his assistance as fast as his ass could go, and when he came up found
him unable to move, with such a shock had rocinante fallen with him.

"god bless me!" said sancho, "did i not

eplied don quixote, "the fortunes of war more
than any other are liable to frequent fluctuations; and moreover i think,
and it is the truth, that that same sage friston who carried off my study
and books, has turned these giants into mills in order to rob me of the
glory of vanquishing them, such is the enmity he bears me; but in the end
his wicked arts will avail but little against my good sword."

"god order it as he may," said sancho panza, and helping him to rise got
him up again on rocinante, whose shoulder was half out; and then,
discussing the late adventure, they followed the road to puerto lapice,
for there, said don quixote, they could not fail to find adventures in
abundance and variety, as it was a great thoroughfare. for all that, he
was much grieved at the loss of his lance, and saying so to his squire,
he added, "i remember having read how a spanish knight, diego perez de
vargas by name, having broken his sword in battle, tore from an oak a
ponderous bough or branc

a speedy death as the
just punishment of your evil deeds."

the friars drew rein and stood wondering at the appearance of don quixote
as well as at his words, to which they replied, "senor caballero, we are
not devilish or unnatural, but two brothers of st. benedict following our
road, nor do we know whether or not there are any captive princesses
coming in this coach."

"no soft words with me, for i know you, lying rabble," said don quixote,
and without waiting for a reply he spurred rocinante and with levelled
lance charged the first friar with such fury and determination, that, if
the friar had not flung himself off the mule, he would have brought him
to the ground against his will, and sore wounded, if not killed outright.
the second brother, seeing how his comrade was treated, drove his heels
into his castle of a mule and made off across the country faster than the
wind.

sancho panza, when he saw the friar on the ground, dismounting briskly
from his ass, rushed towards

in the first pamphlet the battle between don quixote and the biscayan was
drawn to the very life, they planted in the same attitude as the history
describes, their swords raised, and the one protected by his buckler, the
other by his cushion, and the biscayan's mule so true to nature that it
could be seen to be a hired one a bowshot off. the biscayan had an
inscription under his feet which said, "don sancho de azpeitia," which no
doubt must have been his name; and at the feet of rocinante was another
that said, "don quixote." rocinante was marvellously portrayed, so long
and thin, so lank and lean, with so much backbone and so far gone in
consumption, that he showed plainly with what judgment and propriety the
name of rocinante had been bestowed upon him. near him was sancho panza
holding the halter of his ass, at whose feet was another label that said,
"sancho zancas," and according to the picture, he must have had a big
belly, a short body, and long shanks, for which re

 discourse that passed between don quixote and his squire
sancho panza


now by this time sancho had risen, rather the worse for the handling of
the friars' muleteers, and stood watching the battle of his master, don
quixote, and praying to god in his heart that it might be his will to
grant him the victory, and that he might thereby win some island to make
him governor of, as he had promised. seeing, therefore, that the struggle
was now over, and that his master was returning to mount rocinante, he
approached to hold the stirrup for him, and, before he could mount, he
went on his knees before him, and taking his hand, kissed it saying, "may
it please your worship, senor don quixote, to give me the government of
that island which has been won in this hard fight, for be it ever so big
i feel myself in sufficient force to be able to govern it as much and as
well as anyone in the world who has ever governed islands."

to which don quixote replied, "thou must take notice, brother s

ancho,
that this adventure and those like it are not adventures of islands, but
of cross-roads, in which nothing is got except a broken head or an ear
the less: have patience, for adventures will present themselves from
which i may make you, not only a governor, but something more."

sancho gave him many thanks, and again kissing his hand and the skirt of
his hauberk, helped him to mount rocinante, and mounting his ass himself,
proceeded to follow his master, who at a brisk pace, without taking
leave, or saying anything further to the ladies belonging to the coach,
turned into a wood that was hard by. sancho followed him at his ass's
best trot, but rocinante stepped out so that, seeing himself left behind,
he was forced to call to his master to wait for him. don quixote did so,
reining in rocinante until his weary squire came up, who on reaching him
said, "it seems to me, senor, i

he huts of some goatherds, so they determined to pass the night there,
and it was as much to sancho's discontent not to have reached a house, as
it was to his master's satisfaction to sleep under the open heaven, for
he fancied that each time this happened to him he performed an act of
ownership that helped to prove his chivalry.

what befell don quixote with certain goatherds


he was cordially welcomed by the goatherds, and sancho, having as best he
could put up rocinante and the ass, drew towards the fragrance that came
from some pieces of salted goat simmering in a pot on the fire; and
though he would have liked at once to try if they were ready to be
transferred from the pot to the stomach, he refrained from doing so as
the goatherds removed them from the fire, and laying sheepskins on the
ground, quickly spread their rude table, and with signs of hearty
good-will invited them both to share what they had. round the skins six

sancho panza, who was wishing the goatherd's loquacity at the devil, on
his part begged his master to go into pedro's hut to sleep. he did so,
and passed all the rest of the night in thinking of his lady dulcinea, in
imitation of the lovers of marcela. sancho panza settled himself between
rocinante and his ass, and slept, not like a lover who had been
discarded, but like a man who had been soundly kicked.

incidents

east, when five of the six goatherds came to rouse don quixote and tell
him that if he was still of a mind to go and see the famous burial of
chrysostom they would bear him company. don quixote, who desired not

chrysostom, he and his squire passed into the same wood which they had
seen the shepherdess marcela enter, and after having wandered for more
than two hours in all directions in search of her without finding her,
they came to a halt in a glade covered with tender grass, beside which
ran a pleasant cool stream that invited and compelled them to pass there
the hours of the noontide heat, which by this time was beginning to come
on oppressively. don quixote and sancho dismounted, and turning rocinante
and the ass loose to feed on the grass that was there in abundance, they
ransacked the alforjas, and without any ceremony very peacefully and
sociably master and man made their repast on what they found in them.

sancho had not thought it worth while to hobble rocinante, feeling sure,
from what he knew of his staidness and freedom from incontinence, that
all the mares in the cordova pastures would not lead him into an
impropriety. chance, however, and the devil, who is not always asleep

, so
ordained it that feeding in this valley there was a drove of galician
ponies belonging to certain yanguesan carriers, whose way it is to take
their midday rest with their teams in places and spots where grass and
water abound; and that where don quixote chanced to be suited the
yanguesans' purpose very well. it so happened, then, that rocinante took
a fancy to disport himself with their ladyships the ponies, and
abandoning his usual gait and demeanour as he scented them, he, without
asking leave of his master, got up a briskish little trot and hastened to
make known his wishes to them; they, however, it seemed, preferred their
pasture to him, and received him with their heels and teeth to such
effect that they soon broke his girths and left him naked without a
saddle to cover him; but what must have been worse to him was that t

carriers, seeing the violence he was offering to their mares, came
running up armed with stakes, and so belaboured him that they brought him
sorely battered to the ground.

by this time don quixote and sancho, who had witnessed the drubbing of
rocinante, came up panting, and said don quixote to sancho:

"so far as i can see, friend sancho, these are not knights but base folk
of low birth: i mention it because thou canst lawfully aid me in taking
due vengeance for the insult offered to rocinante before our eyes."

"what the devil vengeance can we take," answered sancho, "if they are
more than twenty, and we no more than two, or, indeed, perhaps not more
than one and a half?"

"i count for a hundred," replied don quixote, and without m

jerkin he wore, together with a great portion of his shoulder. the
yanguesans, seeing themselves assaulted by only two men while they were
so many, betook themselves to their stakes, and driving the two into the
middle they began to lay on with great zeal and energy; in fact, at the
second blow they brought sancho to the ground, and don quixote fared the
same way, all his skill and high mettle availing him nothing, and fate
willed it that he should fall at the feet of rocinante, who had not yet
risen; whereby it may be seen how furiously stakes can pound in angry
boorish hands.

then, seeing the mischief they had done, the yanguesans with all the
haste they could loaded their team and pursued their journey, leaving the
two adventurers a sorry sight and in sorrier mood.

sancho was the first to come to, and finding himself close to his master
he called to him in a weak and doleful voice, "senor don quixote, ah,

and try, as they say, what chance may do for them; so it is essential
that the new possessor should have good sense to enable him to govern,
and valour to attack and defend himself, whatever may befall him."

"in what has now befallen us," answered sancho, "i'd have been well
pleased to have that good sense and that valour your worship speaks of,
but i swear on the faith of a poor man i am more fit for plasters than
for arguments. see if your worship can get up, and let us help rocinante,
though he does not deserve it, for he was the main cause of all this
thrashing. i never thought it of rocinante, for i took him to be a
virtuous person and as quiet as myself. after all, they say right that it
takes a long time to come to know people, and that there is nothing sure
in this life. who would have said that, after such mighty slashes as your
worship gave that unlucky knight-errant, there was coming, travelling
post and at the very heels of them, such a great storm of sticks

which death does not remove."

"and what greater misfortune can there be," replied panza, "than the one
that waits for time to put an end to it and death to remove it? if our
mishap were one of those that are cured with a couple of plasters, it
would not be so bad; but i am beginning to think that all the plasters in
a hospital almost won't be enough to put us right."

"no more of that: pluck strength out of weakness, sancho, as i mean to
do," returned don quixote, "and let us see how rocinante is, for it seems
to me that not the least share of this mishap has fallen to the lot of
the poor beast."

"there is nothing wonderful in that," replied sancho, "since he is a
knight-errant too; what i wonder at is that my beast should have come off
scot-free where we come out scotched."

"fortune always leaves a door open in adversity in order to bring relief
to it," said don quixote; "i say so because this little beast may now
supply the want of rocinante, carrying me hence to some c

inclemencies of heaven, without their ladies knowing anything of it; and
one of these was amadis, when, under the name of beltenebros, he took up
his abode on the pena pobre for--i know not if it was eight years or
eight months, for i am not very sure of the reckoning; at any rate he
stayed there doing penance for i know not what pique the princess oriana
had against him; but no more of this now, sancho, and make haste before a
mishap like rocinante's befalls the ass."

"the very devil would be in it in that case," said sancho; and letting
off thirty "ohs," and sixty sighs, and a hundred and twenty maledictions
and execrations on whomsoever it was that had brought him there, he
raised himself, stopping half-way bent like a turkish bow without power
to bring himself upright, but with all his pains he saddled his ass, who
too had gone astray somewhat, yielding to the excessive licence of the
day; he next raised up rocinante, and as f

or him, had he possessed a
tongue to complain with, most assuredly neither sancho nor his master
would have been behind him.

to be brief, sancho fixed don quixote on the ass and secured rocinante
with a leading rein, and taking the ass by the halter, he proceeded more
or less in the direction in which it seemed to him the high road might
be; and, as chance was conducting their affairs for them from good to
better, he had not gone a short league when the road came in sight, and
on it he perceived an inn, which to his annoyance and to the delight of
don quixote must needs be a castle. sancho insisted that it was an inn,
and his master that it was not one, but a castle, and the disp

castle being, as i have already said, enchanted, at the time when i was
engaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came,
without my seeing or knowing whence it came, a hand attached to some arm
of some huge giant, that planted such a cuff on my jaws that i have them
all bathed in blood, and then pummelled me in such a way that i am in a
worse plight than yesterday when the carriers, on account of rocinante's
misbehaviour, inflicted on us the injury thou knowest of; whence
conjecture that there must be some enchanted moor guarding the treasure
of this damsel's beauty, and that it is not for me."

"not for me either," said sancho, "for more than four hundred moors have
so thrashed me that the drubbing of the stakes was cakes and fancy-bread
to it. but tell me, senor, what do you call this excellent and rare
adventure that has left us as we are left now? though your worship was

h he was left, not like his master, but so weak and exhausted that he
could not stand. don quixote, however, who, as has been said, felt
himself relieved and well, was eager to take his departure at once in
quest of adventures, as it seemed to him that all the time he loitered
there was a fraud upon the world and those in it who stood in need of his
help and protection, all the more when he had the security and confidence
his balsam afforded him; and so, urged by this impulse, he saddled
rocinante himself and put the pack-saddle on his squire's beast, whom
likewise he helped to dress and mount the ass; after which he mounted his
horse and turning to a corner of the inn he laid hold of a pike that
stood there, to serve him by way of a lance. all that were in the inn,
who were more than twenty persons, stood watching him; the innkeeper's
daughter was likewise observing him, and he too never took his eyes off
her, and from time to time fetched a sigh that he seemed to pluck up from

insufferable toil they endure in seeking adventures by night and by day,
in summer and in winter, on foot and on horseback, in hunger and thirst,
cold and heat, exposed to all the inclemencies of heaven and all the
hardships of earth."

"i have little to do with that," replied the innkeeper; "pay me what you
owe me, and let us have no more talk of chivalry, for all i care about is
to get my money."

"you are a stupid, scurvy innkeeper," said don quixote, and putting spurs
to rocinante and bringing his pike to the slope he rode out of the inn
before anyone could stop him, and pushed on some distance without looking
to see if his squire was following him.

the innkeeper when he saw him go without paying him ran to get payment of
sancho, who said that as his master would not pay neither would he,
because, being as he was squire to a knight-errant, the same rule and
reason held good for him as for his master with regard to not paying
anything in inns and hostelries. at t

beast. when don quixote saw the state he was in he said, "i have now come
to the conclusion, good sancho, that this castle or inn is beyond a doubt
enchanted, because those who have so atrociously diverted themselves with
thee, what can they be but phantoms or beings of another world? and i
hold this confirmed by having noticed that when i was by the wall of the
yard witnessing the acts of thy sad tragedy, it was out of my power to
mount upon it, nor could i even dismount from rocinante, because they no
doubt had me enchanted; for i swear to thee by the faith of what i am
that if i had been able to climb up or dismount, i would have avenged
thee in such a way that those braggart thieves would have remembered
their freak for ever, even though in so doing i knew that i contravened
the laws of chivalry, which, as i have often told thee, do not permit a
knight to lay hands on him who is not one, save in case of urgent and
great necessity in defence of his own life and perso

"that i can well understand," answered sancho; "but where shall we put
this ass where we may be sure to find him after the fray is over? for i
believe it has not been the custom so far to go into battle on a beast of
this kind."

"that is true," said don quixote, "and what you had best do with him is
to leave him to take his chance whether he be lost or not, for the horses
we shall have when we come out victors will be so many that even
rocinante will run a risk of being changed for another. but attend to me
and observe, for i wish to give thee some account of the chief knights
who accompany these two armies; and that thou mayest the better see and
mark, let us withdraw to that hillock which rises yonder, whence both
armies may be seen."

they did so, and placed themselves on a rising ground from which the two
droves that don quixote made armies of might have been plainly seen if
the clouds of dust they raised had not obscured t

at bleating of ewes and sheep," said sancho;
which was true, for by this time the two flocks had come close.

"the fear thou art in, sancho," said don quixote, "prevents thee from
seeing or hearing correctly, for one of the effects of fear is to derange
the senses and make things appear different from what they are; if thou
art in such fear, withdraw to one side and leave me to myself, for alone
i suffice to bring victory to that side to which i shall give my aid;"
and so saying he gave rocinante the spur, and putting the lance in rest,
shot down the slope like a thunderbolt. sancho shouted after him, crying,
"come back, senor don quixote; i vow to god they are sheep and ewes you
are charging! come back! unlucky the father that begot me! what madness
is this! look, there is no giant, nor knight, nor cats, nor arms, nor
shields quartered or whole, nor vair azure or bedevilled. what are you
about? sinner that i am before god!" but not for all these entreaties did

to his ass to get
something wherewith to clean himself, and relieve his master, out of his
alforjas; but not finding them, he well-nigh took leave of his senses,
and cursed himself anew, and in his heart resolved to quit his master and
return home, even though he forfeited the wages of his service and all
hopes of the promised island.

don quixote now rose, and putting his left hand to his mouth to keep his
teeth from falling out altogether, with the other he laid hold of the
bridle of rocinante, who had never stirred from his master's side--so
loyal and well-behaved was he--and betook himself to where the squire
stood leaning over his ass with his hand to his cheek, like one in deep
dejection. seeing him in this mood, looking so sad, don quixote said to
him:

"bear in mind, sancho, that one man is no more than another, unless he
does more than another; all these tempests that fall upon us are signs
that fair weather is coming shortly, and that things will go well with
us, for

attendant who was on foot, seeing the encamisado fall, began to abuse don
quixote, who now moved to anger, without any more ado, laying his lance
in rest charged one of the men in mourning and brought him badly wounded
to the ground, and as he wheeled round upon the others the agility with
which he attacked and routed them was a sight to see, for it seemed just
as if wings had that instant grown upon rocinante, so lightly and proudly
did he bear himself. the encamisados were all timid folk and unarmed, so
they speedily made their escape from the fray and set off at a run across
the plain with their lighted torches, looking exactly like maskers
running on some gala or festival night. the mourners, too, enveloped and
swathed in their skirts and gowns, were unable to bestir themselves, and
so with entire safety to himself don quixote belaboured them all and
drove them off against their will, for

"it cannot be, senor, but that this grass is a proof that there must be
hard by some spring or brook to give it moisture, so it would be well to
move a little farther on, that we may find some place where we may quench
this terrible thirst that plagues us, which beyond a doubt is more
distressing than hunger."

the advice seemed good to don quixote, and, he leading rocinante by the
bridle and sancho the ass by the halter, after he had packed away upon
him the remains of the supper, they advanced the meadow feeling their
way, for the darkness of the night made it impossible to see anything;
but they had not gone two hundred paces when a loud noise of water, as if
falling from great rocks, struck their ears. the sound cheered them
greatly; but halting to make out by listening from what quarter it came
they heard unseasonably another noise which spoiled the sat

to reach a spot in among some tall trees, whose leaves
stirred by a gentle breeze made a low ominous sound; so that, what with
the solitude, the place, the darkness, the noise of the water, and the
rustling of the leaves, everything inspired awe and dread; more
especially as they perceived that the strokes did not cease, nor the wind
lull, nor morning approach; to all which might be added their ignorance
as to where they were.

but don quixote, supported by his intrepid heart, leaped on rocinante,
and bracing his buckler on his arm, brought his pike to the slope, and
said, "friend sancho, know that i by heaven's will have been born in this
our iron age to revive in it the age of gold, or the golden as it
is called; i am he for whom perils, mighty achievements, and valiant
deeds are reserved; i am, i say again, he who is to revive the knights of
the round table, the twelve of france and the nine worthies; and he who
is to consign to oblivion the platirs, the tablantes, the olivant

the moon, and that incessant hammering that wounds and pains our ears;
which things all together and each of itself are enough to instil fear,
dread, and dismay into the breast of mars himself, much more into one not
used to hazards and adventures of the kind. well, then, all this that i
put before thee is but an incentive and stimulant to my spirit, making my
heart burst in my bosom through eagerness to engage in this adventure,
arduous as it promises to be; therefore tighten rocinante's girths a
little, and god be with thee; wait for me here three days and no more,
and if in that time i come not back, thou canst return to our village,
and thence, to do me a favour and a service, thou wilt go to el toboso,
where thou shalt say to my incomparable lady dulcinea that her captive
knight hath died in attempting things that might make him worthy of being
called hers."

when sancho heard his master's words he began to weep in the most
pathetic way, saying:

"senor, i know

 reason to
show that it now wants but little of day."

"let it want what it may," replied don quixote, "it shall not be said of
me now or at any time that tears or entreaties turned me aside from doing
what was in accordance with knightly usage; and so i beg of thee, sancho,
to hold thy peace, for god, who has put it into my heart to undertake now
this so unexampled and terrible adventure, will take care to watch over
my safety and console thy sorrow; what thou hast to do is to tighten
rocinante's girths well, and wait here, for i shall come back shortly,
alive or dead."

sancho perceiving it his master's final resolve, and how little his
tears, counsels, and entreaties prevailed with him, determined to have
recourse to his own ingenuity and compel him, if he could, to wait till
daylight; and so, while tightening the girths of the horse, he quietly
and without being felt, with his ass' halter tied both rocinante's legs,
so that when don quixote strove to go he was unable as the

 horse could
only move by jumps. seeing the success of his trick, sancho panza said:

"see there, senor! heaven, moved by my tears and prayers, has so ordered
it that rocinante cannot stir; and if you will be obstinate, and spur and
strike him, you will only provoke fortune, and kick, as they say, against
the pricks."

don quixote at this grew desperate, but the more he drove his heels into
the horse, the less he stirred him; and not having any suspicion of the
tying, he was fain to resign himself and wait till daybreak or until
rocinante could move, firmly persuaded that all this came of something
other than sancho's ingenuity. so he said to him, "as it is so

, sancho,
and as rocinante cannot move, i am content to wait till dawn smiles upon
us, even though i weep while it delays its coming."

"there is no need to weep," answered sancho, "for i will amuse your
worship by telling stories from this till daylight, unless indeed you
like to dismount and lie down to sleep a little on the green grass after
the fashion of knights-errant, so as to be fresher when day comes and the
moment arrives for attempting this extraordinary adventure you are
looking forward to."

"what

h a way of telling it and ending it was never seen nor will be in a
lifetime; though i expected nothing else from thy excellent
understanding. but i do not wonder, for perhaps those ceaseless strokes
may have confused thy wits."

"all that may be," replied sancho, "but i know that as to my story, all
that can be said is that it ends there where the mistake in the count of
the passage of the goats begins."

"let it end where it will, well and good," said don quixote, "and let us
see if rocinante can go;" and again he spurred him, and again rocinante
made jumps and remained where he was, so well tied was he.

just then, whether it was the cold of the morning that was now
approaching, or that he had eaten something laxative at supper, or that
it was only natural (as is most likely), sancho felt a desire to do what
no one could do for him; but so great was the fear that had penetrated
his heart, he dared not separate himself from his master by as much as
the black of his nail; to

and for the future pay more attention to
thy person and to what thou owest to mine; for it is my great familiarity
with thee that has bred this contempt."

"i'll bet," replied sancho, "that your worship thinks i have done
something i ought not with my person."

"it makes it worse to stir it, friend sancho," returned don quixote.

with this and other talk of the same sort master and man passed the
night, till sancho, perceiving that daybreak was coming on apace, very
cautiously untied rocinante and tied up his breeches. as soon as
rocinante found himself free, though by nature he was not at all
mettlesome, he seemed to feel lively and began pawing--for as to
capering, begging his pardon, he knew not what it meant. don quixote,
then, observing that rocinante could move, took it as a good sign and a
signal that he should attempt the dread adventure. by this time day had
fully broken and everything showed distinctly, and don quixote saw that
he was among some tall trees, chestnuts

, which cast a very deep shade; he
perceived likewise that the sound of the strokes did not cease, but could
not discover what caused it, and so without any further delay he let
rocinante feel the spur, and once more taking leave of sancho, he told
him to wait for him there three days at most, as he had said before, and
if he should not have returned by that time, he might feel sure it had
been god's will that he should end his days in that perilous adventure.
he again repeated the message and commission with which he was to go on
his behalf to his lady dulcinea, and said he was not to be uneasy as to
the payment of his services, for before leaving home he had made his

his ass, his constant comrade in prosperity or adversity; and advancing
some distance through the shady chestnut trees they came upon a little
meadow at the foot of some high rocks, down which a mighty rush of water
flung itself. at the foot of the rocks were some rudely constructed
houses looking more like ruins than houses, from among which came, they
perceived, the din and clatter of blows, which still continued without
intermission. rocinante took fright at the noise of the water and of the
blows, but quieting him don quixote advanced step by step towards the
houses, commending himself with all his heart to his lady, imploring her
support in that dread pass and enterprise, and on the way commending
himself to god, too, not to forget him. sancho who never quitted his
side, stretched his neck as far as he could and peered between the legs
of rocinante to see if he could now discover what it was that caused him

was a new one, he put the basin on his head, and being clean it glittered
at half a league's distance. he rode upon a grey ass, as sancho said, and
this was what made it seem to don quixote to be a dapple-grey steed and a
knight and a golden helmet; for everything he saw he made to fall in with
his crazy chivalry and ill-errant notions; and when he saw the poor
knight draw near, without entering into any parley with him, at
rocinante's top speed he bore down upon him with the pike pointed low,
fully determined to run him through and through, and as he reached him,
without checking the fury of his charge, he cried to him:

"defend thyself, miserable being, or yield me of thine own accord that
which is so reasonably my due."

and making quite another thing of it. this done, they broke their fast on
the remains of the spoils of war plundered from the sumpter mule, and
drank of the brook that flowed from the fulling mills, without casting a
look in that direction, in such loathing did they hold them for the alarm
they had caused them; and, all anger and gloom removed, they mounted and,
without taking any fixed road (not to fix upon any being the proper thing
for true knights-errant), they set out, guided by rocinante's will, which
carried along with it that of his master, not to say that of the ass,
which always followed him wherever he led, lovingly and sociably;
nevertheless they returned to the high road, and pursued it at a venture
without any other aim.

as they went along, then, in this way sancho said to his master, "senor,
would your worship give me leave to speak a little to you? for since you
laid that hard injunction of silence on me several things have gone to
rot in my stomach, and i h

pasamonte, who was anything but meek (being by this time thoroughly
convinced that don quixote was not quite right in his head as he had
committed such a vagary as to set them free), finding himself abused in
this fashion, gave the wink to his companions, and falling back they
began to shower stones on don quixote at such a rate that he was quite
unable to protect himself with his buckler, and poor rocinante no more
heeded the spur than if he had been made of brass. sancho planted himself
behind his ass, and with him sheltered himself from the hailstorm that
poured on both of them. don quixote was unable to shield himself so well
but that more pebbles than i could count struck him full on the body with
such force that they brought him to the ground; and the instant he fell

stockings if his greaves had not prevented them. from sancho they took
his coat, leaving him in his shirt-sleeves; and dividing among themselves
the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more
solicitous about keeping clear of the holy brotherhood they dreaded, than
about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves
before the lady dulcinea del toboso. the ass and rocinante, sancho and
don quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping
head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the
storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; rocinante stretched
beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone;
sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the holy brotherhood; and don
quixote fuming to find himself so served by the very persons for whom he
had done so much.

brothers and brotherhoods in the world."

"senor," replied sancho, "to retire is not to flee, and there is no
wisdom in waiting when danger outweighs hope, and it is the part of wise
men to preserve themselves to-day for to-morrow, and not risk all in one
day; and let me tell you, though i am a clown and a boor, i have got some
notion of what they call safe conduct; so repent not of having taken my
advice, but mount rocinante if you can, and if not i will help you; and
follow me, for my mother-wit tells me we have more need of legs than
hands just now."

don quixote mounted without replying, and, sancho leading the way on his
ass, they entered the side of the sierra morena, which was close by, as
it was sancho's design to cross it entirely and come out again at el viso

escape the search of the brotherhood should they come to look for the

to dread, resolved to
take hiding in the mountains; and his fate and fear led him to the same
spot to which don quixote and sancho panza had been led by theirs, just
in time to recognise them and leave them to fall asleep: and as the
wicked are always ungrateful, and necessity leads to evildoing, and
immediate advantage overcomes all considerations of the future, gines,
who was neither grateful nor well-principled, made up his mind to steal
sancho panza's ass, not troubling himself about rocinante, as being a
prize that was no good either to pledge or sell. while sancho slept he
stole his ass, and before day dawned he was far out of reach.

himself bereft of him he began the saddest and most doleful lament in the

saying, "o son of my bowels, born in my very house, my chil

the knight of the rueful countenance was still very anxious to find out
who the owner of the valise could be, conjecturing from the sonnet and
letter, from the money in gold, and from the fineness of the shirts, that
he must be some lover of distinction whom the scorn and cruelty of his
lady had driven to some desperate course; but as in that uninhabited and
rugged spot there was no one to be seen of whom he could inquire, he saw
nothing else for it but to push on, taking whatever road rocinante
chose--which was where he could make his way--firmly persuaded that among
these wilds he could not fail to meet some rare adventure. as he went
along, then, occupied with these thoughts, he perceived on the summit of
a height that rose before their eyes a man who went springing from rock
to rock and from tussock to tussock with marvellous agility. as well as
he could make out he was unclad, with a thick black beard, long tangled
hair, and bare legs and feet, his thighs were covered by br

he was bareheaded, and notwithstanding the swiftness with which he passed
as has been described, the knight of the rueful countenance observed and
noted all these trifles, and though he made the attempt, he was unable to
follow him, for it was not granted to the feebleness of rocinante to make
way over such rough ground, he being, moreover, slow-paced and sluggish
by nature. don quixote at once came to the conclusion that this was the
owner of the saddle-pad and of the valise, and made up his mind to go in
search of him, even though he should have to wander a year in those
mountains before he found him, and so he directed sancho to take a short
cut over one side of the mountain, while he himself went by the other,
and perhaps by this means they might light upon this ma

"thou art wrong there, sancho," said don quixote, "for now that we have a
suspicion who the owner is, and have him almost before us, we are bound
to seek him and make restitution; and if we do not see him, the strong
suspicion we have as to his being the owner makes us as guilty as if he
were so; and so, friend sancho, let not our search for him give thee any
uneasiness, for if we find him it will relieve mine."

and so saying he gave rocinante the spur, and sancho followed him on foot
and loaded, and after having partly made the circuit of the mountain they
found lying in a ravine, dead and half devoured by dogs and pecked by
jackdaws, a mule saddled and bridled, all which still further
strengthened their suspicion that he who had fled was the owner of the
mule and the saddle-pad.

as they stood looking at it they heard a whistle like that of a shepherd
watching his flock, and suddenly on their left there appeared a great

been unintelligible near at hand, much more at a distance. his garb was
what has been described, save that as he drew near, don quixote perceived
that a tattered doublet which he wore was amber-tanned, from which he
concluded that one who wore such garments could not be of very low rank.

approaching them, the youth greeted them in a harsh and hoarse voice but
with great courtesy. don quixote returned his salutation with equal
politeness, and dismounting from rocinante advanced with well-bred
bearing and grace to embrace him, and held him for some time close in his
arms as if he had known him for a long time. the other, whom we may call
the ragged one of the sorry countenance, as don quixote was of the
rueful, after submitting to the embrace pushed him back a little and,
placing his hands on don quixote's shoulders, stood gazing at him as if
seeking to see whether he knew him, not less amazed, perhaps, at the
sight of the face, figure, and armour of do

don quixote took leave of the goatherd, and once more mounting rocinante
bade sancho follow him, which he having no ass, did very discontentedly.
they proceeded slowly, making their way into the most rugged part of the
mountain, sancho all the while dying to have a talk with his master, and
longing for him to begin, so that there should be no breach of the
injunction laid upon him; but unable to keep silence so long he said to
him:

"senor don quixote, give me your worship's blessing and dismissal, for
i'd like to go home at once to my wife and children wit

they did in the days of guisopete, it would not be so bad, because i
could talk to rocinante about whatever came into my head, and so put up
with my ill-fortune; but it is a hard case, and not to be borne with
patience, to go seeking adventures all one's life and get nothing but
kicks and blanketings, brickbats and punches, and with all this to have
to sew up one's mouth without daring to say what is in one's heart, just
as if one were dumb."

"i understand thee, sancho," replied don quixote; "thou art dying to have
the interdict i placed upon thy tongue removed; consider it re

my fidelity! oh, lonely trees, that from this day forward shall bear me
company in my solitude, give me some sign by the gentle movement of your
boughs that my presence is not distasteful to you! oh, thou, my squire,
pleasant companion in my prosperous and adverse fortunes, fix well in thy
memory what thou shalt see me do here, so that thou mayest relate and
report it to the sole cause of all," and so saying he dismounted from
rocinante, and in an instant relieved him of saddle and bridle, and
giving him a slap on the croup, said, "he gives thee freedom who is
bereft of it himself, oh steed as excellent in deed as thou art
unfortunate in thy lot; begone where thou wilt, for thou bearest written
on thy forehead that neither astolfo's hippogriff, nor the famed frontino
that cost bradamante so dear, could equal thee in speed."

seeing this sancho said, "good luck to him who has saved us the trouble
of stripping the pack-s

le! by my faith he would not have
gone without a slap on the croup and something said in his praise; though
if he were here i would not let anyone strip him, for there would be no
occasion, as he had nothing of the lover or victim of despair about him,
inasmuch as his master, which i was while it was god's pleasure, was
nothing of the sort; and indeed, sir knight of the rueful countenance, if
my departure and your worship's madness are to come off in earnest, it
will be as well to saddle rocinante again in order that he may supply the
want of dapple, because it will save me time in going and returning: for
if i go on foot i don't know when i shall get there or when i shall get
back, as i am, in truth, a bad walker."

"i declare, sancho," returned don quixote, "it shall be as thou wilt, for
thy plan does not seem to me a bad one, and three days hence thou wilt
depart, for i wish thee to observe in the meantime what i do and say for
her sake, that thou mayest be able to tell it."

"purgatory dost thou call it, sancho?" said don quixote, "rather call it
hell, or even worse if there be anything worse."

"for one who is in hell," said sancho, "nulla est retentio, as i have
heard say."

"i do not understand what retentio means," said don quixote.

"retentio," answered sancho, "means that whoever is in hell never comes
nor can come out of it, which will be the opposite case with your worship
or my legs will be idle, that is if i have spurs to enliven rocinante:
let me once get to el toboso and into the presence of my lady dulcinea,
and i will tell her such things of the follies and madnesses (for it is
all one) that your worship has done and is still doing, that i will
manage to make her softer than a glove though i find her harder than a
cork tree; and with her sweet and honeyed answer i will come back through

"that will do," said sancho; "now let your worship sign it."

"there is no need to sign it," said don quixote, "but merely to put my
flourish, which is the same as a signature, and enough for three asses,
or even three hundred."

"i can trust your worship," returned sancho; "let me go and saddle
rocinante, and be ready to give me your blessing, for i mean to go at
once without seeing the fooleries your worship is going to do; i'll say i
saw you do so many that she will not want any more."

"at any rate, sancho," said don quixote, "i should like--and there is
reason for it--i should like thee, i say, to see me stripped to the skin

than half an hour; for having seen them with thine own eyes, thou canst

to lay them at intervals until thou hast come out upon the plain; these
will serve thee, after the fashion of the clue in the labyrinth of
theseus, as marks and signs for finding me on thy return."

"so i will," said sancho panza, and having cut some, he asked his
master's blessing, and not without many tears on both sides, took his
leave of him, and mounting rocinante, of whom don quixote charged him
earnestly to have as much care as of his own person, he set out for the
plain, strewing at intervals the branches of broom as his master had
recommended him; and so he went his way, though don quixote still
entreated him to see him do were it only a couple of mad acts. he had not
gone a hundred paces, however, when he returned and said:

"i must say, senor, your worship said quite right, that in order to be

"did i not tell thee so?" said don quixote. "wait, sancho, and i will do
them in the saying of a credo," and pulling off his breeches in all haste
he stripped himself to his skin and his shirt, and then, without more
ado, he cut a couple of gambados in the air, and a couple of somersaults,
heels over head, making such a display that, not to see it a second time,
sancho wheeled rocinante round, and felt easy, and satisfied in his mind
that he could swear he had left his master mad; and so we will leave him
to follow his road until his return, which was a quick one.

 once recognised him, and said one to the other:

"senor licentiate, is not he on the horse there sancho panza who, our
adventurer's housekeeper told us, went off with her master as esquire?"

"so it is," said the licentiate, "and that is our friend don quixote's
horse;" and if they knew him so well it was because they were the curate
and the barber of his own village, the same who had carried out the
scrutiny and sentence upon the books; and as soon as they recognised
sancho panza and rocinante, being anxious to hear of don quixote, they
approached, and calling him by his name the curate said, "friend sancho
panza, where is your master?"

sancho recognised them at once, and determined to keep secret the place
and circumstances where and under which he had left his master, so he
replied that his master was engaged in a certain quarter on a certain
matter of great importance to him which he could not disclose for the
eyes in his head.

"nay, nay," said the barber, "if you don'

e done is to take steps to coax
your master out of that useless penance you say he is performing; and we
had best turn into this inn to consider what plan to adopt, and also to
dine, for it is now time."

sancho said they might go in, but that he would wait there outside, and
that he would tell them afterwards the reason why he was unwilling, and
why it did not suit him to enter it; but he begged them to bring him out
something to eat, and to let it be hot, and also to bring barley for
rocinante. they left him and went in, and presently the barber brought
him out something to eat. by-and-by, after they had between them
carefully thought over what they should do to carry out their object, the
curate hit upon an idea very well adapted to humour don quixote, and
effect their purpose; and his notion, which he explained to the barber,
was that he himself should assume the disguise of a wandering damsel,
while the other should try as best he could to pass for a squire, and
that they s

and despite of the felons who would gainsay it; and now hands to the
work, for in delay there is apt to be danger."

the distressed damsel strove with much pertinacity to kiss his hands; but
don quixote, who was in all things a polished and courteous knight, would
by no means allow it, but made her rise and embraced her with great
courtesy and politeness, and ordered sancho to look to rocinante's
girths, and to arm him without a moment's delay. sancho took down the
armour, which was hung up on a tree like a trophy, and having seen to the
girths armed his master in a trice, who as soon as he found himself in
his armour exclaimed:

"let us be gone in the name of god to bring aid to this great lady."

the barber was all this time on his knees at great pains to hide his
laughter and not let his beard fall, for had it fallen maybe their fine
scheme would have come to nothing; but

 now seeing the boon granted, and
the promptitude with which don quixote prepared to set out in compliance
with it, he rose and took his lady's hand, and between them they placed
her upon the mule. don quixote then mounted rocinante, and the barber
settled himself on his beast, sancho being left to go on foot, which made
him feel anew the loss of his dapple, finding the want of him now. but he
bore all with cheerfulness, being persuaded that his master had now
fairly started and was just on the point of becoming an emperor; for he
felt no doubt at all that he would marry this princess, and be king of
micomicon at least. the only thing that troubled him was the reflection
that this kingdom was in the land of the blac

believing that thou mayest have gone from this place to el toboso and
returned in such a short time, since, as i have said, some friendly sage
must have carried thee through the air without thee perceiving it."

"that must have been it," said sancho, "for indeed rocinante went like a
gipsy's ass with quicksilver in his ears."

"quicksilver!" said don quixote, "aye and what is more, a legion of
devils, folk that can travel and make others travel without being weary,
exactly as the whim seizes them. but putting this aside, what thinkest
thou i ought to do about my lady's command to go and see her? for though

finds it will not suit him to keep it; but thou rememberest, andres, that

though he were to hide himself in the whale's belly."

"that is true," said andres; "but it was of no use."

"thou shalt see now whether it is of use or not," said don quixote; and
so saying, he got up hastily and bade sancho bridle rocinante, who was
browsing while they were eating. dorothea asked him what he meant to do.
he replied that he meant to go in search of this clown and chastise him
for such iniquitous conduct, and see andres paid to the last maravedi,
despite and in the teeth of all the clowns in the world. to which she

was calling to him from the hole in the wall, which seemed to him to be a
window, and what is more, with a gilt grating, as rich castles, such as
he believed the inn to be, ought to have; and it immediately suggested
itself to his imagination that, as on the former occasion, the fair
damsel, the daughter of the lady of the castle, overcome by love for him,
was once more endeavouring to win his affections; and with this idea, not
to show himself discourteous, or ungrateful, he turned rocinante's head
and approached the hole, and as he perceived the two wenches he said:

"i pity you, beauteous lady, that you should have directed your thoughts
of love to a quarter from whence it is impossible that such a return can
be made to you as is due to your great merit and gentle birth, for which
you must not blame this unhappy knight-errant whom love renders incapable
of submission to any other than her whom, the first moment his eyes
beheld her, he made absolute mistress of his soul. f

beware of that, if he does not want to meet the most disastrous end that
ever father in the world met for having laid hands on the tender limbs of
a love-stricken daughter."

maritornes felt sure that don quixote would present the hand she had
asked, and making up her mind what to do, she got down from the hole and
went into the stable, where she took the halter of sancho panza's ass,
and in all haste returned to the hole, just as don quixote had planted
himself standing on rocinante's saddle in order to reach the grated
window where he supposed the lovelorn damsel to be; and giving her his
hand, he said, "lady, take this hand, or rather this scourge of the
evil-doers of the earth; take, i say, this hand which no other hand of
woman has ever touched, not even hers who has complete possession of my
entire body. i present it to you, not that you may kiss it, but that you
may observe the contexture of the sinews, the close network of the
muscles, the breadth and capacit

 is not to blame for the offence my resolution has
given you, nor is it just to wreak all your vengeance on so small a part;
remember that one who loves so well should not revenge herself so
cruelly."

but there was nobody now to listen to these words of don quixote's, for
as soon as maritornes had tied him she and the other made off, ready to
die with laughing, leaving him fastened in such a way that it was
impossible for him to release himself.

he was, as has been said, standing on rocinante, with his arm passed
through the hole and his wrist tied to the bolt of the door, and in
mighty fear and dread of being left hanging by the arm if rocinante were
to stir one side or the other; so he did not dare to make the least
movement, although from the patience and imperturbable disposition of
rocinante, he had good reason to expect that he would stand without
budging for a whole century. finding himself fast, then, and that the
ladies had retired, he began to fancy that all this wa

again, after having come off so badly the first time; it being a settled
point with knights-errant that when they have tried an adventure, and
have not succeeded in it, it is a sign that it is not reserved for them
but for others, and that therefore they need not try it again.
nevertheless he pulled his arm to see if he could release himself, but it
had been made so fast that all his efforts were in vain. it is true he
pulled it gently lest rocinante should move, but try as he might to seat
himself in the saddle, he had nothing for it but to stand upright or pull
his hand off. then it was he wished for the sword of amadis, against
which no enchantment whatever had any power; then he cursed his ill
fortune; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his
absence while he remained there enchanted, for that he believed he was
beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved

oblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him; then he called
upon the sages lirgandeo and alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked
his good friend urganda to succour him; and then, at last, morning found
him in such a state of desperation and perplexity that he was bellowing
like a bull, for he had no hope that day would bring any relief to his
suffering, which he believed would last for ever, inasmuch as he was
enchanted; and of this he was convinced by seeing that rocinante never
stirred, much or little, and he felt persuaded that he and his horse were
to remain in this state, without eating or drinking or sleeping, until
the malign influence of the stars was overpast, or until some other more
sage enchanter should disenchant him.

but he was very much deceived in this conclusion, for daylight had hardly
begun to appear when there came up to the inn four men on horseback, well
equipped and accoutred, with firelocks across their saddle-bows. they
called ou

"you know but little of the world," returned don quixote, "since you are
ignorant of what commonly occurs in knight-errantry."

but the comrades of the spokesman, growing weary of the dialogue with don
quixote, renewed their knocks with great vehemence, so much so that the
host, and not only he but everybody in the inn, awoke, and he got up to
ask who knocked. it happened at this moment that one of the horses of the
four who were seeking admittance went to smell rocinante, who melancholy,
dejected, and with drooping ears stood motionless, supporting his sorely
stretched master; and as he was, after all, flesh, though he looked as if
he were made of wood, he could not help giving way and in return smelling
the one who had come to offer him attentions. but he had hardly moved at
all when don quixote lost his footing; and slipping off the saddle, he
would have come to the ground, but for being suspended by the arm, which
caused him such agony that he believe

maritornes, who had been by this time roused up by the same outcry,
suspecting what it was, ran to the loft and, without anyone seeing her,
untied the halter by which don quixote was suspended, and down he came to
the ground in the sight of the landlord and the travellers, who
approaching asked him what was the matter with him that he shouted so. he
without replying a word took the rope off his wrist, and rising to his
feet leaped upon rocinante, braced his buckler on his arm, put his lance
in rest, and making a considerable circuit of the plain came back at a
half-gallop exclaiming:

"whoever shall say that i have been enchanted with just cause, provided
my lady the princess micomicona grants me permission to do so, i give him
the lie, challenge him and defy him to single combat."

the newly arrived travellers were amazed at the words of don quixote; but
the landlord removed their surprise by telling them who he was, and not

all she saw, was grave or gay without knowing why, as she watched and
studied the various countenances, but particularly her spaniard's, whom
she followed with her eyes and clung to with her soul. the gift and
compensation which the curate gave the barber had not escaped the
landlord's notice, and he demanded don quixote's reckoning, together with
the amount of the damage to his wine-skins, and the loss of his wine,
swearing that neither rocinante nor sancho's ass should leave the inn
until he had been paid to the very last farthing. the curate settled all
amicably, and don fernando paid; though the judge had also very readily
offered to pay the score; and all became so peaceful and quiet that the
inn no longer reminded one of the discord of agramante's camp, as don
quixote said, but of the peace and tranquillity of the days of
octavianus: for all which it was the universal opinion that their thanks
were due to the great zeal and

"on, then, in god's name," said don quixote; "for, when a lady humbles
herself to me, i will not lose the opportunity of raising her up and
placing her on the throne of her ancestors. let us depart at once, for
the common saying that in delay there is danger, lends spurs to my
eagerness to take the road; and as neither heaven has created nor hell
seen any that can daunt or intimidate me, saddle rocinante, sancho, and
get ready thy ass and the queen's palfrey, and let us take leave of the
castellan and these gentlemen, and go hence this very instant."

sancho, who was standing by all the time, said, shaking his head, "ah!
master, master, there is more mischief in the village than one hears of,
begging all good bodies' pardon."

"what mischief can there be in any village, or in all the cities of the
world, you booby, that can hurt my reputation?" said don quixote.

"if your worship is

f the reward his love had earned, and sancho seeing
this had considered that such freedom was more like a courtesan than a
queen of a great kingdom; she, however, being unable or not caring to
answer him, allowed him to proceed, and he continued, "this i say, senor,
because, if after we have travelled roads and highways, and passed bad
nights and worse days, one who is now enjoying himself in this inn is to
reap the fruit of our labours, there is no need for me to be in a hurry
to saddle rocinante, put the pad on the ass, or get ready the palfrey;
for it will be better for us to stay quiet, and let every jade mind her
spinning, and let us go to dinner."

good god, what was the indignation of don quixote when he heard the
audacious words of his squire! so great was it, that in a voice
inarticulate with rage, with a stammering tongue, and eyes that flashed
living fire, he exclaimed, "rascally clown, boorish, insolent, and
ignorant, ill-spoken, foul-mouthed, impudent backbiter and s

of seems to thee to smell of amber, either thou art deceiving thyself, or
he wants to deceive thee by making thee fancy he is not a devil."

such was the conversation that passed between master and man; and don
fernando and cardenio, apprehensive of sancho's making a complete
discovery of their scheme, towards which he had already gone some way,
resolved to hasten their departure, and calling the landlord aside, they
directed him to saddle rocinante and put the pack-saddle on sancho's ass,
which he did with great alacrity. in the meantime the curate had made an
arrangement with the officers that they should bear them company as far
as his village, he paying them so much a day. cardenio hung the buckler
on one side of the bow of rocinante's saddle and the basin on the other,
and by signs commanded sancho to mount his ass and take rocinante's
bridle, and at each side of the cart he placed two officers with their
muskets; but before th

he kept it, intending to read it when he had an opportunity. he then
mounted and his friend the barber did the same, both masked, so as not to
be recognised by don quixote, and set out following in the rear of the
cart. the order of march was this: first went the cart with the owner
leading it; at each side of it marched the officers of the brotherhood,
as has been said, with their muskets; then followed sancho panza on his
ass, leading rocinante by the bridle; and behind all came the curate and
the barber on their mighty mules, with faces covered, as aforesaid, and a
grave and serious air, measuring their pace to suit the slow steps of the
oxen. don quixote was seated in the cage, with his hands tied and his
feet stretched out, leaning against the bars as silent and as patient as
if he were a stone statue and not a man of flesh. thus slowly and
silently they made, it might be, two leagues, until they reached a valley

salutations were exchanged; and one of the new comers, who was, in fact,
a canon of toledo and master of the others who accompanied him, observing
the regular order of the procession, the cart, the officers, sancho,
rocinante, the curate and the barber, and above all don quixote caged and
confined, could not help asking what was the meaning of carrying the man
in that fashion; though, from the badges of the officers, he already
concluded that he must be some desperate highwayman or other malefactor
whose punishment fell within the jurisdiction of the holy brotherhood.
one of the officers to whom he had put the question, replied, "let the

fuller satisfaction, it would be well if your worship were to try to get
out of this prison (and i promise to do all in my power to help, and even
to take you out of it), and see if you could once more mount your good

shut myself up along with your worship, if so be you are so unfortunate,

protested he would be unable to avoid offending their nostrils unless
they kept their distance.

the canon took his hand, tied together as they both were, and on his word
and promise they unbound him, and rejoiced beyond measure he was to find
himself out of the cage. the first thing he did was to stretch himself
all over, and then he went to where rocinante was standing and giving him
a couple of slaps on the haunches said, "i still trust in god and in his
blessed mother, o flower and mirror of steeds, that we shall soon see
ourselves, both of us, as we wish to be, thou with thy master on thy
back, and i mounted upon thee, following the calling for which god sent
me into the world." and so saying, accompanied by sancho, he withdrew to
a retired spot, from which he came back much relieved and more eager than
ever to put his squire's scheme i

ote when he saw the strange garb of the
penitents, without reflecting how often he had seen it before, took it
into his head that this was a case of adventure, and that it fell to him
alone as a knight-errant to engage in it; and he was all the more
confirmed in this notion, by the idea that an image draped in black they
had with them was some illustrious lady that these villains and
discourteous thieves were carrying off by force. as soon as this occurred
to him he ran with all speed to rocinante who was grazing at large, and
taking the bridle and the buckler from the saddle-bow, he had him bridled
in an instant, and calling to sancho for his sword he mounted rocinante,
braced his buckler on his arm, and in a loud voice exclaimed to those who
stood by, "now, noble company, ye shall see how important it is that
there should be knights in the world professing the order of knight-errantry;
now, i say, ye shall see, by the deliverance of that worthy lady who is
borne captive there, w

he had no spurs--and at a full canter (for in all this veracious history
we never read of rocinante fairly galloping) set off to encounter the
penitents, though the curate, the canon, and the barber ran to prevent
him. but it was out of their power, nor did he even stop for the shouts
of sancho calling after him, "where are you going, senor don quixote?
what devils have possessed you to set you on against our catholic faith?

e what you are doing, senor, for this time it
may be safely said you don't know what you are about." sancho laboured in
vain, for his master was so bent on coming to quarters with these sheeted
figures and releasing the lady in black that he did not hear a word; and
even had he heard, he would not have turned back if the king had ordered
him. he came up with the procession and reined in rocinante, who was
already anxious enough to slacken speed a little, and in a hoarse,
excited voice he exclaimed, "you who hide your faces, perhaps because you
are not good subjects, pay attention and listen to what i am about to say
to you." the first to halt were those who were carrying the image, and
one of the four ecclesiastics who were chanting the litany, struck by the
strange figure of don quixote, the leanness of rocinante, and the other
ludicrous peculiarities he observed, said in reply

be said!"

at the cries and moans of sancho, don quixote came to himself, and the
first word he said was, "he who lives separated from you, sweetest
dulcinea, has greater miseries to endure than these. aid me, friend
sancho, to mount the enchanted cart, for i am not in a condition to press
the saddle of rocinante, as this shoulder is all knocked to pieces."

"that i will do with all my heart, senor," said sancho; "and let us
return to our village with these gentlemen, who seek your good, and there
we will prepare for making another sally, which may turn out more
profitable and creditable to us."

"thou art right, sancho," returned don quixote; "it will be wise to let
the malign influence of the stars which now prevails pass off."

the goatherd took his leave of the party; the officers of the brotherhood
declined to go any farther, and the curate paid them what was due to
them; the canon begged the curate to let him know how don quixote did,
whether he was cured of his madness or still suffered from it, and then
begged leave to continue his journey; in short, they all separated and
went their ways, leaving to themselves the curate and the barber, don
quixote, sancho panza, and the good rocinante, who regarded everything
with as great resignation as his master. the carter yoked his oxen and
made don quixote comfortable on a truss of hay, and at his usual
deliberate pace took the road the curate directed, and at the end of six
days they reached don quixote's village, and entered it about the middle
of the day, which it so happened was a sunday, and the people were all in
the plaza, through which don quixote's cart passed. they all flocked to

the beauty of dulcinea, the form of rocinante, the fidelity of sancho

the benedictine giants, and the battle with the valiant biscayan."

"tell me, senor bachelor," said sancho at this point, "does the adventure
with the yanguesans come in, when our good rocinante went hankering after

"no fear of that," returned samson, "for it is so plain that there is
nothing in it to puzzle over; the children turn its leaves, the young
people read it, the grown men understand it, the old folk praise it; in a
word, it is so thumbed, and read, and got by heart by people of all
sorts, that the instant they see any lean hack, they say, 'there goes
rocinante.' and those that are most given to reading it are the pages,
for there is not a lord's ante-chamber where there is not a 'don quixote'
to be found; one takes it up if another lays it down; this one pounces
upon it, and that begs for it. in short, the said history is the most
delightful and least injurious entertainment that has been hitherto seen,
for there is not to be found in the whole of it even the semblance of an
immodest word, or a thought that is other than catholic."

and righting wrongs, as is the use and custom of good knights-errant."

sancho had hardly uttered these words when the neighing of rocinante fell
upon their ears, which neighing don quixote accepted as a happy omen, and
he resolved to make another sally in three or four days from that time.
announcing his intention to the bachelor, he asked his advice as to the
quarter in which he ought to commence his expedition, and the bachelor
replied that in his opinion he ought to go to the kingdom of aragon, and
the city of saragossa, where there were to be certain solemn joustings at
the festival of st. george, at which he might win r

finally, then, during those three days, don quixote and sancho provided
themselves with what they considered necessary, and sancho having
pacified his wife, and don quixote his niece and housekeeper, at
nightfall, unseen by anyone except the bachelor, who thought fit to
accompany them half a league out of the village, they set out for el
toboso, don quixote on his good rocinante and sancho on his old dapple,
his alforjas furnished with certain matters in the way of victuals, and
his purse with money that don quixote gave him to meet emergencies.
samson embraced him, and entreated him to let him hear of his good or
evil fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with
him over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. don quixote
promised him he would do so, and samson returned to the village, and the
other two took the road for the great

tory may reckon that the achievements and humours of don quixote and
his squire are now about to begin; and he urges them to forget the former
chivalries of the ingenious gentleman and to fix their eyes on those that
are to come, which now begin on the road to el toboso, as the others
began on the plains of montiel; nor is it much that he asks in
consideration of all he promises, and so he goes on to say:

don quixote and sancho were left alone, and the moment samson took his
departure, rocinante began to neigh, and dapple to sigh, which, by both
knight and squire, was accepted as a good sign and a very happy omen;
though, if the truth is to be told, the sighs and brays of dapple were
louder than the neighings of the hack, from which sancho inferred that
his good fortune was to exceed and overtop that of his master, building,
perhaps, upon some judicial astrology that he may have known, though the
history says nothing about it; all that can be said is, that when he

 to seek his master, and found him sighing and uttering a thousand
passionate lamentations. when don quixote saw him he exclaimed, "what
news, sancho, my friend? am i to mark this day with a white stone or a
black?"

"your worship," replied sancho, "had better mark it with ruddle, like the
inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may see
it plain."

"then thou bringest good news," said don quixote.

"so good," replied sancho, "that your worship has only to spur rocinante
and get out into the open field to see the lady dulcinea del toboso, who,
with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your worship."

"holy god! what art thou saying, sancho, my friend?" exclaimed don
quixote. "take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by false joy to
cheer my real sadness."

"what could i get by deceiving your worship," returned sancho,

of the strange adventure which the valiant don quixote had with the car
or cart of "the cortes of death"


dejected beyond measure did don quixote pursue his journey, turning over
in his mind the cruel trick the enchanters had played him in changing his
lady dulcinea into the vile shape of the village lass, nor could he think
of any way of restoring her to her original form; and these reflections
so absorbed him, that without being aware of it he let go rocinante's
bridle, and he, perceiving the liberty that was granted him, stopped at
every step to crop the fresh grass with which the plain abounded.

sancho recalled him from his reverie. "melancholy, senor," said he, "was
made, not for beasts, but for men; but if men give way to it overmuch
they turn to beasts; control yourself, your worship; be yourself again;
gather up rocinante's reins; cheer up, rouse yourself and show that
gallant spirit that knights-errant ought to have. what the devil is

while they were talking, fate so willed it that one of the company in a
mummers' dress with a great number of bells, and armed with three blown
ox-bladders at the end of a stick, joined them, and this merry-andrew
approaching don quixote, began flourishing his stick and banging the
ground with the bladders and cutting capers with great jingling of the
bells, which untoward apparition so startled rocinante that, in spite of
don quixote's efforts to hold him in, taking the bit between his teeth he
set off across the plain with greater speed than the bones of his anatomy
ever gave any promise of.

sancho, who thought his master was in danger of being thrown, jumped off
dapple, and ran in all haste to help him; but by the time he reached him
he was already on the ground, and beside him was rocinante, who had come
down with his master, the usual end and upshot of rocinante's vivacity
and hig

ood squire and good
servant, he let his love for his master prevail over his affection for
his ass; though every time he saw the bladders rise in the air and come
down on the hind quarters of his dapple he felt the pains and terrors of
death, and he would have rather had the blows fall on the apples of his
own eyes than on the least hair of his ass's tail. in this trouble and
perplexity he came to where don quixote lay in a far sorrier plight than
he liked, and having helped him to mount rocinante, he said to him,
"senor, the devil has carried off my dapple."

"what devil?" asked don quixote.

"the one with the bladders," said sancho.

"then i will recover him," said don quixote, "even if he be shut up with
him in the deepest and darkest dungeons of hell. follow me, sancho, for
the cart goes slowly, and with the mules of it i will make good the loss
of dapple."

"you need not take the trouble, senor," said sancho; "keep cool, for as i
now see, the devil has let dapple go and

 he is coming back to his old
quarters;" and so it turned out, for, having come down with dapple, in
imitation of don quixote and rocinante, the devil made off on foot to the
town, and the ass came back to his master.

"for all that," said don quixote, "it will be well to visit the
discourtesy of that devil upon some of those in the cart, even if it were
the emperor himself."

"don't think of it, your worship," returned sancho; "take my advice and
never meddle with actors, for they are a favoured class; i myself have
known an actor taken up for two murders, and yet come off scot-free;

understood them, and, guessing by the words what the speaker's intention
was, death in an instant jumped out of the cart, and the emperor, the
devil carter and the angel after him, nor did the queen or the god cupid
stay behind; and all armed themselves with stones and formed in line,
prepared to receive don quixote on the points of their pebbles. don
quixote, when he saw them drawn up in such a gallant array with uplifted
arms ready for a mighty discharge of stones, checked rocinante and began
to consider in what way he could attack them with the least danger to
himself. as he halted sancho came up, and seeing him disposed to attack
this well-ordered squadron, said to him, "it would be the height of
madness to attempt such an enterprise; remember, senor, that against sops
from the brook, and plenty of them, there is no defensive armour in the
world, except to stow oneself away under a brass bell; and besides, one
should remember that it is rashness, and not valour, f

in conversation of this kind they passed a good part of the night, but
sancho felt a desire to let down the curtains of his eyes, as he used to
say when he wanted to go to sleep; and stripping dapple he left him at
liberty to graze his fill. he did not remove rocinante's saddle, as his
master's express orders were, that so long as they were in the field or
not sleeping under a roof rocinante was not to be stripped--the ancient
usage established and observed by knights-errant being to take off the
bridle and hang it on the saddle-bow, but to remove the saddle from the
horse--never! sancho acted accordingly, and gave him the same liberty he
had given dapple, between whom and rocinante there was a friendship so
unequalled and so strong, that it is handed

chapters to it, which, in order to preserve the propriety and decorum due
to a history so heroic, he did not insert therein; although at times he
forgets this resolution of his and describes how eagerly the two beasts
would scratch one another when they were together and how, when they were
tired or full, rocinante would lay his neck across dapple's, stretching
half a yard or more on the other side, and the pair would stand thus,
gazing thoughtfully on the ground, for three days, or at least so long as
they were left alone, or hunger did not drive them to go and look for
food. i may add that they say the author left it on record that he
likened their friendship to that of nisus and euryalus, and pylades and

"how! not vanquished?" said he of the grove; "by the heaven that is above
us i fought don quixote and overcame him and made him yield; and he is a
man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning
grey, an aquiline nose rather hooked, and large black drooping
moustaches; he does battle under the name of 'the countenance,' and he
has for squire a peasant called sancho panza; he presses the loins and
rules the reins of a famous steed called rocinante; and lastly, he has
for the mistress of his will a certain dulcinea del toboso, once upon a
time called aldonza lorenzo, just as i call mine casildea de vandalia
because her name is casilda and she is of andalusia. if all these tokens
are not enough to vindicate the truth of what i say, here is my sword,
that will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it."

"calm yourself, sir knight," said don quixote, "and give ear to what i am
about to say to you. i would have you know that t

"that," said don quixote, "is enough to convince me that you are under a

brought, and in less time than it would take you to raise your visor, if
god, my lady, and my arm stand me in good stead, i shall see your face,
and you shall see that i am not the vanquished don quixote you take me to
be."

with this, cutting short the colloquy, they mounted, and don quixote
wheeled rocinante round in order to take a proper distance to charge back
upon his adversary, and he of the mirrors did the same; but don quixote
had not moved away twenty paces when he heard himself called by the
other, and, each returning half-way, he of the mirrors said to him,
"remember, sir knight, that the terms of our combat are, that the
vanquished, as i said before, shall be at the victor's disposal."

"i am aware of it already," said don quixote; "provided what is commanded

xote's view, and he was no less amazed than sancho at the sight;
insomuch that he set him down as a monster of some kind, or a human being
of some new species or unearthly breed. sancho, seeing his master
retiring to run his course, did not like to be left alone with the nosy
man, fearing that with one flap of that nose on his own the battle would
be all over for him and he would be left stretched on the ground, either
by the blow or with fright; so he ran after his master, holding on to
rocinante's stirrup-leather, and when it seemed to him time to turn
about, he said, "i implore of your worship, senor, before you turn to
charge, to help me up into this cork tree, from which i will be able to
witness the gallant encounter your worship is going to have with this
knight, more to my taste and better than from the ground."

"it seems to me rather, sancho," said don quixote, "that thou wouldst
mount a scaffold in order to see the bulls without danger."

"to tell the truth," returned

 i dare not stay near him."

"it is," said don quixote, "such a one that were i not what i am it would
terrify me too; so, come, i will help thee up where thou wilt."

while don quixote waited for sancho to mount into the cork tree he of the
mirrors took as much ground as he considered requisite, and, supposing
don quixote to have done the same, without waiting for any sound of
trumpet or other signal to direct them, he wheeled his horse, which was
not more agile or better-looking than rocinante, and at his top speed,
which was an easy trot, he proceeded to charge his enemy; seeing him,
however, engaged in putting sancho up, he drew rein, and halted in mid
career, for which his horse was very grateful, as he was already unable
to go. don quixote, fancying that his foe was coming down upon him
flying, drove his spurs vigorously into rocinante's lean flanks and made
him scud along in such style that the history tells us that on this
occasion only was he known to make something lik

no time to lay in rest. don quixote, however, paid no
attention to these difficulties, and in perfect safety to himself and
without any risk encountered him of the mirrors with such force that he
brought him to the ground in spite of himself over the haunches of his
horse, and with so heavy a fall that he lay to all appearance dead, not
stirring hand or foot. the instant sancho saw him fall he slid down from
the cork tree, and made all haste to where his master was, who,
dismounting from rocinante, went and stood over him of the mirrors, and
unlacing his helmet to see if he was dead, and to give him air if he
should happen to be alive, he saw--who can say what he saw, without
filling all who hear it with astonishment, wonder, and awe? he saw, the
history says, the very countenance, the very face, the very look, the
very physiognomy, the very effigy, the very image of the bachelor samson

during the delay that occurred while the keeper was opening the first
cage, don quixote was considering whether it would not be well to do
battle on foot, instead of on horseback, and finally resolved to fight on
foot, fearing that rocinante might take fright at the sight of the lions;
he therefore sprang off his horse, flung his lance aside, braced his
buckler on his arm, and drawing his sword, advanced slowly with
marvellous intrepidity and resolute courage, to plant himself in front of
the cart, commending himself with all his heart to god and to his lady
dulcinea.

it is to be observed, that on coming to this passage, the author of this
veracious history breaks out into exclamations. "o doughty don quixote!

  "o ye sweet treasures, to my sorrow found!
  once sweet and welcome when 'twas heaven's good-will.

  "o ye tobosan jars, how ye bring back to my memory the
  sweet object of my bitter regrets!"

the student poet, don diego's son, who had come out with his mother to
receive him, heard this exclamation, and both mother and son were filled
with amazement at the extraordinary figure he presented; he, however,
dismounting from rocinante, advanced with great politeness to ask
permission to kiss the lady's hand, while don diego said, "senora, pray
receive with your wonted kindness senor don quixote of la mancha, whom
you see before you, a knight-errant, and the bravest and wisest in the
world."

the lady, whose name was dona christina, received him with every sign of
good-will and great courtesy, and don quixote placed himself at her
service with an abundance of well-chosen and polished phrases. almost the

both father and son were amazed afresh at the strange medley don quixote
talked, at one moment sense, at another nonsense, and at the pertinacity
and persistence he displayed in going through thick and thin in quest of
his unlucky adventures, which he made the end and aim of his desires.
there was a renewal of offers of service and civilities, and then, with
the gracious permission of the lady of the castle, they took their
departure, don quixote on rocinante, and sancho on dapple.

with other truly droll incidents


don quixote had gone but a short distance beyond don diego's village,
when he fell in with a couple of either priests or students, and a couple
of peasants, mounted on four beasts of the ass kind. one of the students
carried, wrapped up in a piece of green buckram by way of a portmanteau,
what seemed to be a little linen and a couple of

you would be stretched dead there for despising skill with the sword."

"we shall soon see," replied corchuelo, and getting off his ass briskly,
he drew out furiously one of the swords the licentiate carried on his
beast.

"it must not be that way," said don quixote at this point; "i will be the
director of this fencing match, and judge of this often disputed
question;" and dismounting from rocinante and grasping his lance, he
planted himself in the middle of the road, just as the licentiate, with
an easy, graceful bearing and step, advanced towards corchuelo, who came
on against him, darting fire from his eyes, as the saying is. the other
two of the company, the peasants, without dismounting from their asses,
served as spectators of the mortal tragedy. the cuts, thrusts, down
strokes, back strokes and doubles, that corchuelo delivered were past
counting, and came thicker than hops o

seems to me, i have not broken the said article."

"i remember no such article, sancho," said don quixote; "and even if it
were so, i desire you to hold your tongue and come along; for the
instruments we heard last night are already beginning to enliven the
valleys again, and no doubt the marriage will take place in the cool of
the morning, and not in the heat of the afternoon."

sancho did as his master bade him, and putting the saddle on rocinante
and the pack-saddle on dapple, they both mounted and at a leisurely pace
entered the arcade. the first thing that presented itself to sancho's
eyes was a whole ox spitted on a whole elm tree, and in the fire at which
it was to be roasted there was burning a middling-sized mountain of
faggots, and six stewpots that stood round the blaze had not been made in
the ordinary mould of common pots, for they were six half wine-jars, each
fit to hold the contents of a slaughter-house; they swallow

concealed a tolerably long rapier; and, what may be called its hilt being
planted in the ground, he swiftly, coolly, and deliberately threw himself
upon it, and in an instant the bloody point and half the steel blade
appeared at his back, the unhappy man falling to the earth bathed in his
blood, and transfixed by his own weapon.

his friends at once ran to his aid, filled with grief at his misery and
sad fate, and don quixote, dismounting from rocinante, hastened to
support him, and took him in his arms, and found he had not yet ceased to
breathe. they were about to draw out the rapier, but the priest who was
standing by objected to its being withdrawn before he had confessed him,
as the instant of its withdrawal would be that of this death. basilio,
however, reviving slightly, said in a weak voice, as though in pain, "if
thou wouldst consent, cruel quiteria, to give me thy hand as my bride in
this last fatal moment, i might still hope

festival, which lasted until night; and thus dragged away, he moodily
followed his master, who accompanied basilio's party, and left behind him
the flesh-pots of egypt; though in his heart he took them with him, and
their now nearly finished skimmings that he carried in the bucket
conjured up visions before his eyes of the glory and abundance of the
good cheer he was losing. and so, vexed and dejected though not hungry,
without dismounting from dapple he followed in the footsteps of
rocinante.

married couple, who felt themselves under an obligation to him for coming
forward in defence of their cause; and they exalted his wisdom to the
same level with his courage, rating him as a cid in arms, and a cicero in
eloquence. worthy sanc

would have great pleasure in conducting him to the mouth of the very
cave, and would show him the lakes of ruidera, which were likewise famous
all over la mancha, and even all over spain; and he assured him he would
find him entertaining, for he was a youth who could write books good
enough to be printed and dedicated to princes. the cousin arrived at
last, leading an ass in foal, with a pack-saddle covered with a
parti-coloured carpet or sackcloth; sancho saddled rocinante, got dapple
ready, and stocked his alforjas, along with which went those of the
cousin, likewise well filled; and so, commending themselves to god and
bidding farewell to all, they set out, taking the road for the famous
cave of montesinos.

on the way don quixote asked the cousin of what sort and character his
pursuits, avocations, and studies were, to which he replied that he was
by profession a humanist, and that his pursuits and studies were making
books for the press, all of great

and now, just as night was falling, they reached the inn, and it was not
without satisfaction that sancho perceived his master took it for a real
inn, and not for a castle as usual. the instant they entered don quixote
asked the landlord after the man with the lances and halberds, and was
told that he was in the stable seeing to his mule; which was what sancho
and the cousin proceeded to do for their beasts, giving the best manger
and the best place in the stable to rocinante.

jousts left him enough for all. with this object in view he followed the
road and travelled along it for two days, without meeting any adventure
worth committing to writing until on the third day, as he was ascending a
hill, he heard a great noise of drums, trumpets, and musket-shots. at
first he imagined some regiment of soldiers was passing that way, and to
see them he spurred rocinante and mounted the hill. on reaching the top
he saw at the foot of it over two hundred men, as it seemed to him, armed
with weapons of various sorts, lances, crossbows, partisans, halberds,
and pikes, and a few muskets and a great many bucklers. he descended the
slope and approached the band near enough to see distinctly the flags,
make out the colours and distinguish the devices they bore, especially
one on a standard or ensign of white satin, on which there was painted in

one of those, however, that stood near him, fancying he was mocking them,
lifted up a long staff he had in his hand and smote him such a blow with
it that sancho dropped helpless to the ground. don quixote, seeing him so
roughly handled, attacked the man who had struck him lance in hand, but
so many thrust themselves between them that he could not avenge him. far
from it, finding a shower of stones rained upon him, and crossbows and
muskets unnumbered levelled at him, he wheeled rocinante round and, as
fast as his best gallop could take him, fled from the midst of them,
commending himself to god with all his heart to deliver him out of this
peril, in dread every step of some ball coming in at his back and coming
out at his breast, and every minute drawing his breath to see whether it
had gone from him. the members of the band, however, were satisfied with
seeing him take to flight, and did not fire on him. they put up sancho,
scarcely restored to his senses, on his ass, a

dapple followed the footsteps of rocinante, from whom he could not remain
a moment separated. don quixote having got some way off looked back, and
seeing sancho coming, waited for him, as he perceived that no one
followed him. the men of the troop stood their ground till night, and as
the enemy did not come out to battle, they returned to their town
exulting; and had they been aware of the ancient custom of the greeks,
they would have erected a trophy on the spot.

ves for better occasions. this proved to be the case with
don quixote, who, giving way before the fury of the townsfolk and the
hostile intentions of the angry troop, took to flight and, without a
thought of sancho or the danger in which he was leaving him, retreated to
such a distance as he thought made him safe. sancho, lying across his
ass, followed him, as has been said, and at length came up, having by
this time recovered his senses, and on joining him let himself drop off
dapple at rocinante's feet, sore, bruised, and belaboured. don quixote
dismounted to examine his wounds, but finding him whole from head to
foot, he said to him, angrily enough, "in an evil hour didst thou take to
braying, sancho! where hast thou learned that it is well done to mention
the rope in the house of the man that has been hanged? to the music of
brays what harmonies couldst thou expect to get but cudgels? give thanks
to god, sancho, that they signed the cross on thee just now with a stick,

be attributed rather to good fortune than to courage; and so i own that i
retired, but not that i fled; and therein i have followed the example of
many valiant men who have reserved themselves for better times; the
histories are full of instances of this, but as it would not be any good
to thee or pleasure to me, i will not recount them to thee now."

sancho was by this time mounted with the help of don quixote, who then
himself mounted rocinante, and at a leisurely pace they proceeded to take
shelter in a grove which was in sight about a quarter of a league off.
every now and then sancho gave vent to deep sighs and dismal groans, and
on don quixote asking him what caused such acute suffering, he replied
that, from the end of his back-bone up to the nape of his neck, he was so
sore that it nearly drove him out of his senses.

"the cause of that soreness," said don quixote, "will be, no doubt, that

ontesinos; for though
master pedro's ape had told him that of those things part was true, part
false, he clung more to their truth than to their falsehood, the very
reverse of sancho, who held them all to be downright lies.

as they were thus proceeding, then, they discovered a small boat, without
oars or any other gear, that lay at the water's edge tied to the stem of
a tree growing on the bank. don quixote looked all round, and seeing
nobody, at once, without more ado, dismounted from rocinante and bade
sancho get down from dapple and tie both beasts securely to the trunk of
a poplar or willow that stood there. sancho asked him the reason of this
sudden dismounting and tying. don quixote made answer, "thou must know,
sancho, that this bark is plainly, and without the possibility of any
alternative, calling and inviting me to enter it, and in it go to give
aid to some knight or other person of distinction in need of it, who is
no doubt in some sore strait; for this is the way of

lty from which he cannot be delivered
save by the hand of another knight, though they may be at a distance of
two or three thousand leagues or more one from the other, they either
take him up on a cloud, or they provide a bark for him to get into, and
in less than the twinkling of an eye they carry him where they will and
where his help is required; and so, sancho, this bark is placed here for
the same purpose; this is as true as that it is now day, and ere this one
passes tie dapple and rocinante together, and then in god's hand be it to
guide us; for i would not hold back from embarking, though barefooted
friars were to beg me."

"as that's the case," said sancho, "and your worship chooses to give in
to these--i don't know if i may call them absurdities--at every turn,
there's nothing for it but to obey and bow the head, bearing in mind the
proverb, 'do as thy master bids thee, and sit down to table with him;'
but for all that, for the sake of easing my conscience, i warn your

some who pretend to know it and don't."

"now they are tied," said sancho; "what are we to do next?"

"what?" said don quixote, "cross ourselves and weigh anchor; i mean,
embark and cut the moorings by which the bark is held;" and the bark
began to drift away slowly from the bank. but when sancho saw himself
somewhere about two yards out in the river, he began to tremble and give
himself up for lost; but nothing distressed him more than hearing dapple
bray and seeing rocinante struggling to get loose, and said he to his
master, "dapple is braying in grief at our leaving him, and rocinante is
trying to escape and plunge in after us. o dear friends, peace be with
you, and may this madness that is taking us away from you, turned into
sober sense, bring us back to you." and with this he fell weeping so
bitterly, that don quixote said to him, sharply and angrily, "what art
thou afraid of, cowardly creature? what art thou weeping at, heart of
butter-paste? who pursu

thou mayest as well pass thy hand down thy thigh, and if thou comest upon
anything alive we shall be no longer in doubt; if not, then we have

"i don't believe a bit of it," said sancho; "still, i'll do as your
worship bids me; though i don't know what need there is for trying these
experiments, for i can see with my own eyes that we have not moved five
yards away from the bank, or shifted two yards from where the animals
stand, for there are rocinante and dapple in the very same place where we
left them; and watching a point, as i do now, i swear by all that's good,
we are not stirring or moving at the pace of an ant."

"try the test i told thee of, sancho," said don quixote, "and don't mind
any other, for thou knowest nothing about colures, lines, parallels,
zodiacs, ecliptics, poles, solstices, equinoxes, planets, signs,
bearings, the measures of which the celestial and terrestrial spheres are

tell your master that he is welcome to my estate, and that nothing could
happen to me that could give me greater pleasure."

sancho returned to his master mightily pleased with this gratifying
answer, and told him all the great lady had said to him, lauding to the
skies, in his rustic phrase, her rare beauty, her graceful gaiety, and
her courtesy. don quixote drew himself up briskly in his saddle, fixed
himself in his stirrups, settled his visor, gave rocinante the spur, and
with an easy bearing advanced to kiss the hands of the duchess, who,
having sent to summon the duke her husband, told him while don quixote
was approaching all about the message; and as both of them had read the
first part of this history, and from it were aware of don quixote's crazy
turn, they awaited him with the greatest delight and anxiety to make his
acquaintance, meaning to fall in with his humour and agree with
everything he said, and, so long as he stayed with them

, and as he seemed about to
dismount sancho made haste to go and hold his stirrup for him; but in
getting down off dapple he was so unlucky as to hitch his foot in one of
the ropes of the pack-saddle in such a way that he was unable to free it,
and was left hanging by it with his face and breast on the ground. don
quixote, who was not used to dismount without having the stirrup held,
fancying that sancho had by this time come to hold it for him, threw
himself off with a lurch and brought rocinante's saddle after him, which
was no doubt badly girthed, and saddle and he both came to the ground;
not without discomfiture to him and abundant curses muttered between his
teeth against the unlucky sancho, who had his foot still in the shackles.
the duke ordered his huntsmen to go to the help of knight and squire, and
they raised don quixote, sorely shaken by his fall; and he, limping,
advanced as best he could to kneel before the noble pair. this, however,
the duke would by no means permi

"he of the lions be it," continued the duke; "i say, let sir knight of
the lions come to a castle of mine close by, where he shall be given that
reception which is due to so exalted a personage, and which the duchess
and i are wont to give to all knights-errant who come there."

by this time sancho had fixed and girthed rocinante's saddle, and don
quixote having got on his back and the duke mounted a fine horse, they
placed the duchess in the middle and set out for the castle. the duchess
desired sancho to come to her side, for she found infinite enjoyment in
listening to his shrewd remarks. sancho required no pressing, but pushed
himself in between them and the duke, who thought it rare good fortune to
receive such a knight-errant and such a homely squire in their castle.

spirits and satisfaction was looking forward to the day fixed for the
battle he was to fight with him who had robbed dona rodriguez's daughter
of her honour, for whom he hoped to obtain satisfaction for the wrong and
injury shamefully done to her. it came to pass, then, that having sallied
forth one morning to practise and exercise himself in what he would have
to do in the encounter he expected to find himself engaged in the next
day, as he was putting rocinante through his paces or pressing him to the
charge, he brought his feet so close to a pit that but for reining him in
tightly it would have been impossible for him to avoid falling into it.
he pulled him up, however, without a fall, and coming a little closer
examined the hole without dismounting; but as he was looking at it he
heard loud cries proceeding from it, and by listening attentively was
able to make out that he who uttered them was saying, "ho, above there!

signal for the onset our lacquey was in an ecstasy, musing upon the
beauty of her whom he had already made mistress of his liberty, and so he
paid no attention to the sound of the trumpet, unlike don quixote, who
was off the instant he heard it, and, at the highest speed rocinante was
capable of, set out to meet his enemy, his good squire sancho shouting
lustily as he saw him start, "god guide thee, cream and flower of
knights-errant! god give thee the victory, for thou hast the right on thy
side!" but though tosilos saw don quixote coming at him he never stirred
a step from the spot where he was posted; and instead of doing so called
loudly to the marshal of the field, to whom when he came up to see what
he wanted he said, "senor, is not this battle to decide whe

"didn't i say so?" said sancho. "i'm a likely one to hide thefts! why if
i wanted to deal in them, opportunities came ready enough to me in my
government."

don quixote bowed his head, and saluted the duke and duchess and all the
bystanders, and wheeling rocinante round, sancho following him on dapple,
he rode out of the castle, shaping his course for saragossa.

take up the pursuit of chivalry once more; and turning to sancho he said,

let us go to put my offer into execution; for with the right that i have
on my side thou mayest reckon as vanquished all who shall venture to
question it;" and in a great rage, and showing his anger plainly, he rose
from his seat, leaving the company lost in wonder, and making them feel
doubtful whether they ought to regard him as a madman or a rational
being. in the end, though they sought to dissuade him from involving
himself in such a challenge, assuring him t

hey admitted his gratitude as
fully established, and needed no fresh proofs to be convinced of his

sufficient, still don quixote persisted in his resolve; and mounted on
rocinante, bracing his buckler on his arm and grasping his lance, he
posted himself in the middle of a high road that was not far from the
green meadow. sancho followed on dapple, together with all the members of
the pastoral gathering, eager to see what would be the upshot of his
vainglorious and extraordinary proposal.

middle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: "ho

a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all
riding in a compact body and in great haste. no sooner had those who were
with don quixote seen them than they turned about and withdrew to some
distance from the road, for they knew that if they stayed some harm might
come to them; but don quixote with intrepid heart stood his ground, and
sancho panza shielded himself with rocinante's hind-quarters. the troop
of lancers came up, and one of them who was in advance began shouting to
don quixote, "get out of the way, you son of the devil, or these bulls
will knock you to pieces!"

"rabble!" returned don quixote, "i care nothing for bulls, be they the
fiercest jarama breeds on its banks. confess at once, scoundrels, that

n if he wished; and so the drove of fierce bulls and tame bullocks,
together with the crowd of herdsmen and others who were taking them to be
penned up in a village where they were to be run the next day, passed
over don quixote and over sancho, rocinante and dapple, hurling them all
to the earth and rolling them over on the ground. sancho was left
crushed, don quixote scared, dapple belaboured and rocinante in no very
sound condition.

they all got up, however, at length, and don quixote in great haste,
stumbling here and falling there, started off running after the drove,
shouting out, "hold! stay! ye rascally rabble, a single knight awaits
you, and he is not of the temper or opinion of those who say, 'for a

haste, however, did not stop for that, or heed his menaces any more than

of the bulls, and by the side of this, having turned dapple and rocinante
loose without headstall or bridle, the forlorn pair, master and man,
seated themselves. sancho had recourse to the larder of his alforjas and
took out of them what he called the prog; don quixote rinsed his mouth
and bathed his face, by which cooling process his flagging energies were
revived. out of pure vexation he remained without eating, and out of pure
politeness sancho did not venture to touch a morsel of what was before
him, but waited for his master to act as taster. seeing, howe

don quixote did as he recommended, for it struck him that sancho's
reasoning was more like a philosopher's than a blockhead's, and said he,
"sancho, if thou wilt do for me what i am going to tell thee my ease of
mind would be more assured and my heaviness of heart not so great; and it
is this; to go aside a little while i am sleeping in accordance with thy
advice, and, making bare thy carcase to the air, to give thyself three or
four hundred lashes with rocinante's reins, on account of the three
thousand and odd thou art to give thyself for the disenchantment of
dulcinea; for it is a great pity that the poor lady should be left
enchanted through thy carelessness and negligence."

"there is a good deal to be said on that point," said sancho; "let us
both go to sleep now, and after that, god has decreed what will happen.
let me tell your worship that for a man to whip himself in cold blood is
a hard thing, especially if the stripes fall upon an il

worse-fed body. let my lady dulcinea have patience, and when she is least
expecting it, she will see me made a riddle of with whipping, and 'until
death it's all life;' i mean that i have still life in me, and the desire
to make good what i have promised."

don quixote thanked him, and ate a little, and sancho a good deal, and
then they both lay down to sleep, leaving those two inseparable friends
and comrades, rocinante and dapple, to their own devices and to feed
unrestrained upon the abundant grass with which the meadow was furnished.
they woke up rather late, mounted once more and resumed their journey,
pushing on to reach an inn which was in sight, apparently a league off. i
say an inn, because don quixote called it so, contrary to his usual
practice of calling all inns castles. they reached it, and asked the
landlord if they could put up there. he said yes, with as much comfort
and as good fare as

to become lord paramount of all asia, neither more nor less could
happen now in dulcinea's disenchantment if i scourge sancho against his
will; for, if it is the condition of the remedy that sancho shall receive
three thousand and odd lashes, what does it matter to me whether he
inflicts them himself, or some one else inflicts them, when the essential
point is that he receives them, let them come from whatever quarter they
may?"

with this idea he went over to sancho, having first taken rocinante's
reins and arranged them so as to be able to flog him with them, and began
to untie the points (the common belief is he had but one in front) by
which his breeches were held up; but the instant he approached him sancho
woke up in his full senses and cried out, "what is this? who is touching
me and untrussing me?"

"it is i," said don quixote, "and i come to make good thy shortcomings
and relieve my own distresses; i come to whip thee, sancho, and wipe off

would not on any account allow him to accompany her; and thanking him for
his offers as well as she could, took leave of him in tears. the servants
of don vicente carried away his body, and roque returned to his comrades,
and so ended the love of claudia jeronima; but what wonder, when it was
the insuperable and cruel might of jealousy that wove the web of her sad
story?

roque guinart found his squires at the place to which he had ordered
them, and don quixote on rocinante in the midst of them delivering a
harangue to them in which he urged them to give up a mode of life so full
of peril, as well to the soul as to the body; but as most of them were
gascons, rough lawless fellows, his speech did not make much impression
on them. roque on coming up asked sancho if his men had returned and
restored to him the treasures and jewels they had stripped off dapple.
sancho said they had, but that three kerchiefs that were worth three
cities were missing.

of them dared to utter a word, such deference did they pay him. roque
then withdrew to one side and wrote a letter to a friend of his at
barcelona, telling him that the famous don quixote of la mancha, the
knight-errant of whom there was so much talk, was with him, and was, he
assured him, the drollest and wisest man in the world; and that in four
days from that date, that is to say, on saint john the baptist's day, he
was going to deposit him in full armour mounted on his horse rocinante,
together with his squire sancho on an ass, in the middle of the strand of
the city; and bidding him give notice of this to his friends the niarros,
that they might divert themselves with him. he wished, he said, his
enemies the cadells could be deprived of this pleasure; but that was
impossible, because the crazes and shrewd sayings of don quixote and the
humours of his squire sancho panza could not help giving general pleasure
to all the world. he despatched the letter by one of his sq

ign to employ it in your service."

the cavalier replied with words no less polite, and then, all closing in
around him, they set out with him for the city, to the music of the
clarions and the drums. as they were entering it, the wicked one, who is
the author of all mischief, and the boys who are wickeder than the wicked
one, contrived that a couple of these audacious irrepressible urchins
should force their way through the crowd, and lifting up, one of them
dapple's tail and the other rocinante's, insert a bunch of furze under
each. the poor beasts felt the strange spurs and added to their anguish
by pressing their tails tight, so much so that, cutting a multitude of
capers, they flung their masters to the ground. don quixote, covered with
shame and out of countenance, ran to pluck the plume from his poor jade's
tail, while sancho did the same for dapple. his conductors tried to
punish the audacity of the boys, but there was no possibility of doing
so, for they hid themselves a

the
chamber where the rest of the gentlemen were assembled. in the meantime
sancho had recounted to them several of the adventures and accidents that
had happened his master.

that afternoon they took don quixote out for a stroll, not in his armour
but in street costume, with a surcoat of tawny cloth upon him, that at
that season would have made ice itself sweat. orders were left with the
servants to entertain sancho so as not to let him leave the house. don
quixote was mounted, not on rocinante, but upon a tall mule of easy pace
and handsomely caparisoned. they put the surcoat on him, and on the back,
without his perceiving it, they stitched a parchment on which they wrote
in large letters, "this is don quixote of la mancha." as they set out
upon their excursion the placard attracted the eyes of all who chanced to
see him, and as they read out, "this is don quixote of la mancha," don
quixote was amazed to see how many people gazed at him, called him by his
name, and recognised

the knight of the white moon had been seen from the city, and it was told
the viceroy how he was in conversation with don quixote. the viceroy,
fancying it must be some fresh adventure got up by don antonio moreno or
some other gentleman of the city, hurried out at once to the beach
accompanied by don antonio and several other gentlemen, just as don
quixote was wheeling rocinante round in order to take up the necessary
distance. the viceroy upon this, seeing that the pair of them were
evidently preparing to come to the charge, put himself between them,
asking them what it was that led them to engage in combat all of a sudden
in this way. the knight of the white moon replied that it was a question
of precedence of beauty; and briefly told him what he had said to don
quixote, and how the conditions of the defiance agreed upon on both sides
had been accepted. the vi

take a little more distance, as he saw his antagonist was doing the same;
then, without blast of trumpet or other warlike instrument to give them
the signal to charge, both at the same instant wheeled their horses; and
he of the white moon, being the swifter, met don quixote after having
traversed two-thirds of the course, and there encountered him with such
violence that, without touching him with his lance (for he held it high,
to all appearance purposely), he hurled don quixote and rocinante to the
earth, a perilous fall. he sprang upon him at once, and placing the lance
over his visor said to him, "you are vanquished, sir knight, nay dead
unless you admit the conditions of our defiance."

don quixote, bruised and stupefied, without raising his visor said in a
weak feeble voice as if he were speaking out of a tomb, "dulcinea del
toboso is the fairest woman in the world, and i the most unfortunate
knight on earth; it is not fitting that this truth should suffer by my

eplied that so long as nothing in
prejudice of dulcinea was demanded of him, he would observe all the rest
like a true and loyal knight. the engagement given, he of the white moon
wheeled about, and making obeisance to the viceroy with a movement of the
head, rode away into the city at a half gallop. the viceroy bade don
antonio hasten after him, and by some means or other find out who he was.
they raised don quixote up and uncovered his face, and found him pale and
bathed with sweat.

rocinante from the mere hard measure he had received lay unable to stir
for the present. sancho, wholly dejected and woebegone, knew not what to
say or do. he fancied that all was a dream, that the whole business was a
piece of enchantment. here was his master defeated, and bound not to take
up arms for a year. he saw the light of the glory of his achievements
obscured; the hopes of the promises lately made him swept away like smoke
before the wind; rocinante, he feared, was crippled for life, and

very sensibly; i know not who taught thee. but i can tell thee there is
no such thing as fortune in the world, nor does anything which takes
place there, be it good or bad, come about by chance, but by the special

the maker of his own fortune.' i have been that of mine; but not with the
proper amount of prudence, and my self-confidence has therefore made me
pay dearly; for i ought to have reflected that rocinante's feeble
strength could not resist the mighty bulk of the knight of the white
moon's horse. in a word, i ventured it, i did my best, i was overthrown,
but though i lost my honour i did not lose nor can i lose the virtue of
keeping my word. when i was a knight-errant, daring and valiant, i
supported my achievements by hand and deed, and now that i am a humble
squire i will support my words by keeping the promise i have given.

"thou sayest well, sancho," said don quixote; "let my armour be hung up
for a trophy, and under it or round it we will carve on the trees what
was inscribed on the trophy of roland's armour--

these let none move
who dareth not his might with roland prove."

"that's the very thing," said sancho; "and if it was not that we should
feel the want of rocinante on the road, it would be as well to leave him
hung up too."

"and yet, i had rather not have either him or the armour hung up," said
don quixote, "that it may not be said, 'for good service a bad return.'"

"your worship is right," said sancho; "for, as sensible people hold, 'the
fault of the ass must not be laid on the pack-saddle;' and, as in this
affair the fault is your worship's, punish yourself and don't let your
anger break out against the already battered and bloody armour, or

travel more than is reasonable."

in converse of this sort the whole of that day went by, as did the four
succeeding ones, without anything occurring to interrupt their journey,
but on the fifth as they entered a village they found a great number of
people at the door of an inn enjoying themselves, as it was a holiday.
upon don quixote's approach a peasant called out, "one of these two
gentlemen who come here, and who don't know the par

the best plan will be for them not to run," said another, "so that
neither the thin man break down under the weight, nor the fat one strip
himself of his flesh; let half the wager be spent in wine, and let's take
these gentlemen to the tavern where there's the best, and 'over me be the
cloak when it rains."

"i thank you, sirs," said don quixote; "but i cannot stop for an instant,
for sad thoughts and unhappy circumstances force me to seem discourteous
and to travel apace;" and spurring rocinante he pushed on, leaving them
wondering at what they had seen and heard, at his own strange figure and
at the shrewdness of his servant, for such they took sancho to be; and
another of them observed, "if the servant is so clever, what must the
master be? i'll bet, if they are going to salamanca to study, they'll
come to be alcaldes of the court in a trice; for it's a mere joke--only
to read and read, and have interest and good luck; and before a man knows

ed pigs to sell at a fair, and were on their way with them at that
hour, and so great was the noise they made and their grunting and
blowing, that they deafened the ears of don quixote and sancho panza, and
they could not make out what it was. the wide-spread grunting drove came
on in a surging mass, and without showing any respect for don quixote's
dignity or sancho's, passed right over the pair of them, demolishing
sancho's entrenchments, and not only upsetting don quixote but sweeping
rocinante off his feet into the bargain; and what with the trampling and
the grunting, and the pace at which the unclean beasts went, pack-saddle,
armour, dapple and rocinante were left scattered on the ground and sancho
and don quixote at their wits' end.

sancho got up as well as he could and begged his master to give him his
sword, saying he wanted to kill half a dozen of those dirty unmannerly
pigs, for he had by this time found out that that was what they were.

and said, "if i could make use of my weapons, and my promise had not tied
my hands, i would count this host that comes against us but cakes and
fancy bread; but perhaps it may prove something different from what we
apprehend." the men on horseback now came up, and raising their lances
surrounded don quixote in silence, and pointed them at his back and
breast, menacing him with death. one of those on foot, putting his finger
to his lips as a sign to him to be silent, seized rocinante's bridle and
drew him out of the road, and the others driving sancho and dapple before
them, and all maintaining a strange silence, followed in the steps of the
one who led don quixote. the latter two or three times attempted to ask
where they were taking him to and what they wanted, but the instant he
began to open his lips they threatened to close them with the points of
their lances; and sancho fared the same way, for the moment he seemed

night, longed for by don quixote with the greatest anxiety in the world,
came at last, though it seemed to him that the wheels of apollo's car had
broken down, and that the day was drawing itself out longer than usual,
just as is the case with lovers, who never make the reckoning of their
desires agree with time. they made their way at length in among some
pleasant trees that stood a little distance from the road, and there
vacating rocinante's saddle and dapple's pack-saddle, they stretched
themselves on the green grass and made their supper off sancho's stores,
and he making a powerful and flexible whip out of dapple's halter and
headstall retreated about twenty paces from his master among some beech
trees. don quixote seeing him march off with such resolution and spirit,
said to him, "take care, my friend, not to cut thyself to pieces; allow
the lashes to wait for one another, and do not be in so great a hurry as

"very true," said samson, "and good sancho panza's view of these cases is
quite right."

"sirs, not so fast," said don quixote, "'in last year's nests there are
no birds this year.' i was mad, now i am in my senses; i was don quixote
