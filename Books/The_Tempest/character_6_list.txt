Antonio - 
                Prospero's
brother. Antonio quickly demonstrates that he is power-hungry and
foolish. In Act II, scene i, he persuades Sebastian to kill the
sleeping Alonso. He then goes along with Sebastian's absurd story
about fending off lions when Gonzalo wakes up and catches Antonio and
Sebastian with their swords drawn.
