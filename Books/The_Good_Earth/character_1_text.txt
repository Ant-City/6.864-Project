' what is this man doing here?' she asked with sudden
anger. it was as though she had forgotten everything. the
gateman's face was immovable. he said nothing.

c i am waiting for the woman, great lady,' said wang
lung in much astonishment.

'the woman? what woman ' the old lady began,

but the slave girl at her side stooped and whispered and
the lady recovered herself. 'ah, yes, i forgot for the mo-
ment — a small affair — you have come for the slave called
o-lan. i remember we promised her to some farmer in
marriage. you are that farmer?'

'i am he/ replied wang lung.

'call o-lan quickly,' said the old lady to jber slave. it
was as though she was suddenly impatient to be done with
all this and to be left alone in the stillness of the great room
with her opium pipe.

and in an instant the slave appeared leading by the hand
a square, rather tall figure, clothed in clean blue cotton
coat and trousers. wang lung glanced once and then away,

woman made all the shoes for himself and for the old
man and for her own feet and the child's. he would not
know what to make of it if she wished to buy shoes!

there was never anything hanging from the rafters in
his uncle's crumbling old house. but in his own there
was even a leg of pork wich he had bought from his
neighbour, ching, when he killed his pig that looked as
though it were sickening for a disease. the pig had been
caught early before it lost flesh and the leg was a large
one and o-lan had salted it thoroughly and hung it to dry.
there were, as well, two of their own chickens killed and
drawn and dried with the feathers on and stuffed with
salt inside.

in the midst of all this plenty they sat in the house,
therefore, when the winds of winter came out of the desert
to the north-east of them — winds bitter and biting. soon
the child could almost sit alone. they had had a feast of
noodles, which mean long life, on his month birthday, when
he was a full moon of age, and wang l

ung felt that if he became too intimate with the others
there would be borrowing. new year was coming and who
had all the money he wanted foftketiew clothes and the
feasting? he stayed in his house, and while the woman
mended and sewed he took his rakes of split bamboo and
examined them, and where the string was broken he wove
in new string made of hemp he grew himself, and where
a prong was broken out he drove in cleverly a new bit of
bamboo.

and what he did for the farm implements, his wife,
o-lan, did for the house implements. if an earthen jar leak-
ed she did not, like other women, cast it aside and talk of
a new one. instead she mixed earth and clay and welded
the crack and heated it slowly and it was as good as new.

they sat in their house, therefore, and they rejoiced in
each other's approval, although their speech was never
anything more than scattered words such as these:

'did you save the seed from the large squash for the
new planting?' or, 'we will sell the wheat stra

burn the bean-stalks in the kitchen.' or perhaps rarely
wang lung would say, 'this is a good dish of noodles,'
and o-lan would answer in deprecation, 'it is good flour
we have this year from the fields.'

from the produce, wang lung in this good year had
a handful of silver dollars over and above what they needed,
and these he was fearful of keeping in his belt or of telling
any except the woman what he had. they plotted where
to keep the silver and at last the woman cleverly dug a
small hole in the inner wall of their room behind the bed
and into this wang lung thrust the silver and with a clod

red the hole, and it was as though there
was nothing there. but to both wang and o-lan it gave a
sense of secret richness and reserve. wang lung was con-
scious that he had money more than he need spend, and
when he walked among his fellows he walked at ease with
himself and with all.

v

the new year approached and in every house
in the village there were preparations. wang lung went
into the town to the candlemaker's shop and he bought*
squares of red paper on which were brushed in gilt ink the
letter for happiness and some with the letter for riches, and
these squares he paste

second day of the new year and carry the cakes for a gift.'

then the cakes were more important than ever, and
wang lung was pleased that to the great hall where he
had stood with so much timidity and in such poverty his

4i



wife should now go as visitor, carrying his son, dressed in
red, and cakes made as these were with the best flour and
sugar and lard.

all else at that new year sank into insignificance beside
this visit. his new coat of black cotton cloth, which o-lan
had made, when he had put it on only made him say so
himself :

c i shall wear it when i take them to the gate of the great
house.'

he even bore carelessly the first day of the new year
when his uncle and his neighbours came crowding into the
house to wish his father and himself well, all boisterous
with food and drink. he had himself seen to it that the
coloured cakes were put away into the basket lest he might
have to offer them to common men, although he found it
very hard when the plain wh

child. wang lung looked
closely at the woman's face for an instant trying to see if
all were well, for he had learned now from that impassive
square countenance to detect small changes at first invis-
ible to him. she wore a look of heavy content, however,
and at once he became impatient to hear her tell of what
had happened in those courts of the ladies into which he
could not go, now that he had business there.

with short bows, therefore, to the gateman and to his
pock-marked wife he hurried o-lan away, and he took into
his own arms the child who was asleep and lying all crum-
pled in his new coat.

'well?' he called back to her over his shoulder as she

followed him. for once he was impatient with her slowness.
she drew a little nearer to him and said in a whisper :

'i believe, if one should ask me, that they are feeling a
pinch this year in that house/

she spoke in a shocked tone as one might speak of gods
being hungry.

' what do you mean?' said wang lung, urging her.

before,' she replied, 'but she said, "this
house cannot stand for ever with all the young lords, five
of them, spending money like waste water in foreign parts
and sending home woman after woman as they weary of
them, and the old lord living at home adding a concu-
bine or two each year, and the old mistress eating enough
opium every day to fill two shoes with gold." '



44



'do they indeed?' murmured wang lung, spell-bound.

'then the third daughter is to be*married in the spring/
continued o-lan, 'and her dowry is a prince's ransom and
enough to buy an official seat in a big city. her clothes
she will have of nothing but the finest satins, with spe-
cial patterns woven in soochow and hangchow, and she
will have a tailor sent from shanghai with his retinue of
under-tailors lest she find her clothes less fashionable than
those of the women in foreign parts.'

'whom will she marry, then, with all this expense?' said
wang lung, struck with admiration and horror at such
pouring out of wealt

h wang lung now owned
was a thing which greatly changed his life. at first, after
he had dug the silver from the wall and taken it to the
great house, after the honour of speaking as an equal
to the old lord's equal was past he was visited with a de-
pression of spirit which was almost regret. when he thought
of the hole in the wall now empty that had been filled with
silver he need not use, he wished that he had his silver
back. after all, this land, it would take hours of labour
again, and as o-lan said, it was far away, more than a til

4 6



which is a third of a mile. and again, the buying of it had
not been quite so filled with glory as he had anticipated. he
had gone too early to the great house and the old lord
was still sleeping. true, it was noon, but when he said in
a loud voice:

'tell his old honour i have important business-tell

'is it male or female?'
she answered calmly:
it is another male.'

they said nothing more to each other, but he was pleas-
ed, and the incessant bending and stooping seemed less
arduous, and working on until the moon rose above a
bank of purple clouds, they finished the field and went
home.

after his meal and after he had washed his sunburnt
body in cool water and had rinsed his mouth with tea,
wang lung went in to look at his second son. o-lan had
lain herself upon the bed after the cooking of the meal
and the child lay beside her— a fat, pl?cid child, well
enough, but not so large as the first one. wang lung look-
ed at him and then went back to the middle room well
content. another son, and another and another each year
—one could not trouble with red eggs every year; it was
enough to do it for the first. sons every year; the house
was full of good fortune— this woman brought him no-
thing but good fortune. he shouted to his

en thus plainly, he went away to his own
house and left his uncle's wife screaming. he had it in his
mind to buy more land this year from the house of hwang
and more land year after year as he was able, and he dream-
ed of adding a new room to his house, and it angered
him that as he saw himself and his sons rising into a landed
family, this shiftless brood of his cousins should be run-
ning loose, bearing the same name as his own.

the next day his uncle came to the field where he was
working. o-lan was not there, for ten moons had pass-
ed since the second child was born and a third birth was
close upon her, and this time she was not so well, and for
a handful of days she had not come to the fields, and so
wang lung worked alone. his uncle came slouching along
a furrow, his clothes never properly buttoned about him,
but caught together and held insecurely with his girdle, so
that it always seemed that if a gust of wind blew at him
he might suddenly stand naked. he came to where wang

d at last dwindled and yellowed into a
barren harvest. the young rice beds which wang lung
had sowed were squares of jade upon the brown earth.
he carried water to them day after day after he had given
up the wheat, the heavy wooden buckets slung upon a
bamboo pole across his shoulders. but though a furrow
grew upon his flesh and a callous formed there as large as
a bowl, no rain came.

56



at last the water in the pond dried into a cake of clay
and even the water in the well sunk so low that o-lan said
to him:

c if the children must drink and the old man have his
hot water the plants must go dry.'

wang lung answered with anger that broke into a sob :

"well, and they must all starve if the plants starve.' it
was true that all their lives depended upon the earth.

only the piece of land by the moat bore harvest, and
this because at last when summer wore away without rain,
wang lung abandoned all his other fields and stayed the
day out at this one, dipping water from the moat to pour
upo

s, the money passed from one hand to the
other and papers were signed and sealed and the land was
wang lung's.

and once again wang lung did not count the passing
of silver, which was his flesh and his blood, a hard thing.
he bought with it the desire of his heart. he had now a
vast field of good land, for the new field was twice as
large as the first. but more to him than its dark fertility
was the fact that it had belonged once to the family of a
prince. and this time he told no one, not even o-lan,
what he had done.

month passed into month and still no rain fell. as
autumn approached the clouds gathered unwillingly in the
sky, small, light clouds, and in the village street one could
see men standing about, idle and anxious, their faces up-

turned to the sky, judging closely of this cloud and that
discussing together as to whether any held rain in it. but
before sufficient cloud could gather for promise, a bitter
wind rose out of the north-west, the acrid wind of the

. when he would have put the cobs away for
fuel, his wife spoke out:

'no — do not waste them in burning. i remember when
i was a child in shantung when years like this came, even
the cobs we ground and ate. it is better than grass.'

when she had spoken they all fell silent, even the
children. ther0 was foreboding in these strange brilliant
days when the land was failing them. only the girl child
knew no fear. for her there were the mother's two great
breasts as yet filled for her needs. but o-lan, giving her
suck, muttered:

£ eat, poor fool — eat, while there is yet that which can
be eaten.'

and then, as though there were not enough evil, o-lan
was again with child, and her milk dried up, and the
frightened house was filled with the sound of a child con-
tinually crying for food.

if one had asked wang lung, c and how are you fed
through the autumn?' he would have answered, 'i do not
know — a little food here and there.'

but there was none to ask him that. none asked of

 mood was, and from his youth he
had known the beast, when they had bought it a small
calf. and he said:

'how can we eat the ox? how shall we plough again?'

but the old man answered, tranquil enough:

'well, and it is your life or the beast's, and your son's
life or the beast's, and a man can buy an ox again more
•easily than his own life.'

but wang lung would not that day kill it. and the next
day passed and the next, and the children cried out for food
and they would not be comforted and o-lan looked at
wang lung, beseeching him for the children, and he saw
at last that the thing had to be done. so he said roughly :
60



'let it be killed then, but i cannot do it.'

he went into the room where he slept and he laid himself
upon the bed and he wrapped the quilt about his head that
he might not hear the beast's bellowing when it died.

then o-lan crept out and she took a great iron knife
she had in the kitchen and she cut a great gash in the
beast's neck, and thus she severed its life.

 and she took
a bowl and caught its blood to cook for them to eat in a
pudding, and she skinned and hacked to pieces the great
carcass, and wang lung would not come out until the
thing was wholly done and the flesh was cooked and upon
the table. but when he tried to eat the flesh of his ox his
gorge rose and he could not swallow it and he drank only
a little of the soup. and o-lan said to him:

'an ox is but an ox and this one grew old. eat, for
there will be another one day and far better than this one.'

wang lung was a little comforted then, and he ate a
morsel and then more, and they all ate. but the ox was
eaten at last and the bones cracked for the marrow, and it
was all too quickly gone, and there was nothing left of it
except the skin, dried and hard and stretched upon the
rack of bamboo o-lan had made to hold it spread.

at first there had been hostility in the

is neighbours,
they fell upon him and pushed him out of the doorway
and threw out of the house his frightened children, and
they fell upon every corner, and they scrabbled every surface
with their hands to find where he has hidden his food.
then when they found his wretched store of a few dried
beans and a bowlful of dried corn they gave a great howl
of disappointment and despair, and they seized his bits
of furniture, the table and the benches and the old man
lay, frightened and weeping.

then o-lan came forward and spoke, and her plain,
slow voice rose above the men:

'not that — not that yet,' she called out. 'it is not yet
time to take our table and the benches and the bed from
our house. you have all our food. but out of your own
houses you have not sold yet your table and your benches.
leave us ours. w t e are even. we have not a bean or a grain
of corn more than you — no, you have more than we, now,
for you have all of ours. heaven will strike you if you take

ons of han.'

his neighbour looked at him patiently. 'ah, you are
young,' he said sadly. 'i am older than you and my wife
is old and we have nothing except one daughter. we can
die well enough.'

'you are more fortunate than 1/ said wang lung. 'i
have my old father and these three small mouths and an-
other about to be born. we must go lest we forget our na-
ture and eat each other as the wild dogs do.'

and then it seemed to him suddenly that what he said
was very right, and he called aloud to o-lan, who lay upon
the bed day after day without speech, now that there was
no food for the stove and no fuel for the oven.

'come, woman, we will go south!'

there was cheer in his voice such as none had heard
in many moons, and the children looked up and the old
man hobbled out from his room and o-lan rose feebly
from her bed and came to the door of their room and
clinging to the door frame she said :

'it is a good thing to do. one can at least die walking.'

the child in her body hung from her l

, but her hour was
upon her and she knew that if she had not any food she
would die in the clutches of her pain.

only a few of the beans did wang lung hide in his
own hand and these he put into his own mouth and he
chewed them into a soft pulp and then putting his lips to
the lips of his daughter he pushed into her mouth the food,
and watching her small lips move he felt himself fed.

that night he stayed in the middle room. the two boys

67



were in the old man's room, and in the third room o-lan
gave birth alone. he sat there as he had sat during the
birth of his first-born son and listened. she would not even
yet have him near her at her hour. she would give birth
alone, squatting over the old tub she kept for the purpose,
creeping about the room afterwards to remove the traces
of what had been, hiding .as an animal does the birth stains
of its young.

he listened intently for the small sharp cry he knew so
well, and he listened with despair. male or female, it mat-
tered nothing to h

 hang for an instant upon the stillness. 'but there is no
mercy of any kind in these days,' he finished bitterly, and
he sat listening.

there was no second cry, and over the house the still-
ness became impenetrable. but for many days there had
been stillness everywhere — the stillness of inactivity and of
people, each in his own house, waiting to die this house
was filled with such stillness. suddenly wang lung could
not bear it. he was afraid. he rose and went to the door
of the room where o-lan was and he called into the crack
and the sound of his own voice heartened him a little.

'you are safe?' he called to the woman. he listened.
suppose she had died as he sat there! but he could hear
a slight rustling. she was moving about and at last she an-
swered, her voice a sigh :

'come!'

he went in then, and she lay there upon the bed, her
body scarcely raising the cover. she lay alone.
'where is the child?' he asked.

she made a slight movement of her hand upon the bed
and he saw upon th

earth from a certain spot in one of his fields and give it to
the children without desiring any of it for himself. this
earth they had been eating in water for some days — god-
dess of mercy earth, it was called, because it had some slight
nutritious quality in it, although in the end it could not
sustain life; but made into a gruel it allayed the children's
craving for a time and put something into their distended,
empty bellies. he steadfastly would not touch the few beans
that o-lan still held in her hand, and it comforted him
vaguely to hear her crunching them, one at a time, a long
time apart.

and then, as he sat there in the doorway, giving up his
hope and thinking with a dreamy pleasure of lying upon
his bed and sleeping easily into death, some on.", came across
the fields — men walking towards him. he continued to sit
as they drew near and he saw that one was his uncle and
with him were three men whom he did not know.

he was weeping violently and his anger went out of
him as suddenly as a wind and he stood shaking and weep-
ing. the men stood here smiling slightly,his uncle among
them, unmoved. this talk was madness and they waited
until wang's anger was spent.

and then suddenly o-lan came to the door and spoke
to them, her voice flat and commonplace as though every
day such things were.

'the land we will not sell, surely,' she said, 'else when
we return from the south we shall have nothing to feed us.
but we will sell the table and the two beds and the bedding
and the four benches and even the cauldron from the stove.
but the rakes and the hoe and the plough we will not sell,
nor the land.'

there was some calmness in her voice which carried
more strength than all wang lun

g's anger, and wang
lung's uncle said uncertainly:

'will you really go south?'

at last the one-eyed man spoke to the others and they
muttered among themselves and the one-eyed man turned
and said:

'they are poor things and fit only for fuel. two silver
bits for the lot and take it or leave it.'

he turned away with contempt as he spoke, but o-lan
answered tranquillly:

'it is less than the cost of one bed, but if you have the
silver give it to me quickly and take the things.'

the one-eyed man fumbled in his girdle and dropped
the silver into her outstretched hand, and the three men
came into the house and between them they took out the
table and the benches and the bed in wang lung's room
i with its bedding, and they wrenched the cauldron from the
i earthen oven in which it stood. but when they went into
the old man's room wang lung's

uncle stood outside. he
mid not wish his elder brother to see him, nor did he wish
to be there when the old man was laid on the floor and
the bed taken from under him. when all was finished and
the house was wholly empty except for the two rakes and
the two hoes and the plough in one corner of the middle
room, o-lan said to her husband:



73



'let us go while we have the two bits of silver and
before we must sell the rafters of the house and have no
hole into which we can crawl when we return.'

and wang lung answered heavily, 'let us go.'

but he looked across the fields at the small figures of
the men receding and he muttered over and over, 'at least
v' i have the land — i have the land.'



x

there was nothing to do but to pull the
door tight upon its wooden hinges and fasten the iron
hasp. all th

eir clothes they had upon them. into each child's
hands o-lan thrust a rice bowl and a pair of chopsticks and
the two little boys grasped at them eagerly and held them
tight as a promise of food to come. thus they started across
the fields, a dreary small procession moving so slowly that
it seemed they would never reach the wail of the town.

the girl wang lung carried in his bosom until he saw
that the old man would fall and then he gave the child to
o-lan and stooping under his father he lifted him on his
back and carried him, staggering under the old man's dry,
wind-light frame. they went on in complete silence past
the little temple with the two small stately gods within,
who never noticed anything that passed. wang lung was
sweating with his weakness in spite of the cold and bitter
wind. this wind never ceased to blow on them and against
them, so that the two boys cried of its cold. but wang
lung coaxed them saying:

'you are two big men and

nd food every day, white rice every
day for all of us and you shall eat and you shall eat.'

in time they reached the gate of the wall, resting con-
tinually every little way, and where wang lung had once
delighted in its coolness, now he clenched his teeth against
the gust of wintry wind that swept furiously through its
channel as icy water will rush between cliffs. beneath their
feet the mud was thick and speared through with needles

74



of ice and the little boys could make no headway and o-lan
was laden with the girl and desperate under the weight of
her own body. wang lung staggered through with the
old man and set him down and then went back and lifted
each child and carried him through, and then when it was
over at last his sweat poured out of him like rain, spending
all his strength with it, so that he had to lean for a long time
against the damp wall, his eyes shut and his breath coming
and going quickly, and his family stood shivering and wait-
ing about him.

they were close t

which one did not know and understand. it is not well for
a man to know more than is necessary for his daily living.

now, however, he turned doubtfully to the woman and
said:

'shall we also then go on this fire-wagon?'

they drew the old man and the children a little away
from the passing crowd and looked at each other anxiously
and afraid. at the instant's respite the old man sank upon
the ground and the little boy lay in the dust, heedless of
the feet trampling everywhere about them. o-lan carried
the girl child still, but the child's head hung over her arm
with such a look of death on its closed eyes that wang
lung, forgetting all else, cried out:

'is the little slave already dead?'

o-lan shook her head.

'not yet. the breath flutters back and forth in her. but
she will die this night and all of us unless '

and then as if she could say no other word she looked
at him, her square face exhausted and gaunt. wang lung
answered nothing, but to himself he thought that another

d he turned away to see
where he could put his hut.

there were already other huts clinging to the wall be-
hind them, but what was inside the wall none knew and
there was no way of knowing. it stretched out long and
grey and very high, and against the base the small mat sheds
clung like fleas to a dog's back. wang lung observed the
huts and he began to shape his own mats this way and that,
but they were stiff and clumsy things at best, being made
of split reeds, and he despaired, when suddenly o-lan said :

"that i can do. i remember it in my childhood.'

and she placed the girl upon the ground and pulled the
mats thus and thus, and shaped a rounded roof reaching to
the ground and high enough for a man to sit under and not
strike the top, and upon the edges of the mats that were
upon the ground she placed bricks that were lying about
and she set the boys to picking up more bricks. when it
was finished they went within and with one mat she had
contrived not to use they made a floor and sat

ang lung looked at g-lan, doubtful as to

what should be done. but it was not with the despair with
which he had looked at her over their blank and empty
fields. here with the coming and going of well-fed people
upon the streets, with meat and vegetables in the markets,
with fish swimming in the tubs in the fish market, surely
it was npt possible for a man and his children to starve. ,
it was not as it was in their own land, where even silver
could not buy food because there was none. and o-lan
answered him steadily, as though this were the life she had
known always:

'i and the children/tan beg and the old man also. his
grey hairs will move some who will not give to me.'

and she called the two boys to her, for, like children
they had forgotten everything except that they had food
again and were in a strange place, and they ran to the
street and stood staring at all that passed, and she said to
them:

'each of you take your bowls and hold them thus and
cry out thus '

and she took he

penny above the rent of the rickshaw, and he went back
to his hut in great bitterness, saying to himself that for
labour greater than the labour of a day in a harvest field
he had earned only one copper penny. then there came
flooding over him the memory of his land. he had not
remembered it once during this strange day, but now the
thought of it lying back there, far away, it is true, but
waiting and his own, filled him with peace, and so h
came to his hut.

when he entered there he found that o-lan had fo
her day's begging received forty small cash, which is less
than fivepence, and of the boys, the elder had eight cash
and the younger thirteen, and with these put together
there was enough to pay for the rice in the morning.
only when they put the younger boy's in with all, he
howled for his own, and he loved the money he had

86



begged, and slept with it that night in his hand, and they
could not take it from him until he gave it himself for his
own rice.

but the old man had received

empty he said merely:

c i have ploughed land, and i have sown seed, and i
have reaped harvest, and thus have i filled my rice bowl.
and i have beyond this begotten a son and son's sons.'

and with this he trusted like a child that now he would
be fed, seeing that he had a son and grandsons.

now after the first sharpness of wang lung's
hunger was over, when he saw that children had daily
something to eat, when he knew there was every morn-
ing rice to be had and of his day's labour and of o-lan's
begging enough to pay for it, the strangeness of his
life passed, and he began to feel what this city was to
whose fringes he clung. running about the streets every
day and all day long he learned to know the city after a
fashion, and he saw this and that of its secret parts. he
learned that in the morning the people he drew in his
vehicle, if they were women, went to the market, and if
they were men, they went to the schools and to the
house of business. but what sort of schools these were h

and left him with two silver pieces in his palm, which was
double the usual fare.

rthen wang lung knew that this was indeed a foreigner
and more foreign yet than he in this city, and that after
all people of black hair and black eyes are one sort and
people of light hair and light eyes of another sort, and after
that he was no longer wholly foreign in the city.

when he went back to the hut that night with the
silver he had rceived still untouched, he told o-lan, and
she said:

'i have seen them. i always beg of them, for they alone
will drop silver rather than copper into my bowl.'

but neither wang lung nor his wife felt that the for-
eigner dropped silver because of any goodness of heart
but rather because of ignorance and not knowing that
copper is more correct to give to beggars than silver.
r ^ nevertheless, through this experience wang lung learned
what the young men had not taught him, that he belonged
to his own kind, who have black hair and b

still, every morning a little after dawn wang lung and
his family came out of their hut and with their bowls and
chopsticks they made a small group in a long procession
of people, each issuing from his hut, shivering in clothes too
thin for the damp river fog, w r alking curved against the
chill morning wind in the public kitchens, where for a
penny a man may buy a bowl of thin rice gruel. and with
all wang lung's pulling and running before his rickshaw
and with all o-lan's begging, they never could gain enough
to cook rice daily in their own hut. if there was a penny

91



over and above the price of the rice at the kitchens for the
poor, they bought a bit of cabbage. but the cabbage was
dear at any price, for the two boys must go to hunt for fuel
to cook it between the two bricks o-lan had set up for a
stove, and this fuel they had to snatch by handfuls as they
could from the farmers who carried the loads of reed
and grass into the city fuel markets. sometime

s the chil-
dren were caught and cuffed soundly and one night the
elder lad, who was more timid than the younger and more
ashamed of what he did, came back with an eye swollen
shut from the blow of a farmer's hand. but the younger
lad grew adept and indeed more adept at petty thieving
than at begging.

to o-lan this was nothing. if the boys could not beg
without laughing and play, let them steal to fill their bellies.
but wang lung, although he had no answer for her, felt
his gorge rise at this thievery of his sons, and he did not
blame the elder when he was slow at the business. the
life in the shadow of the great wall was not the life wang
lung loved. there w t as his land waiting for him.

one night he came late and there was in the stew of
cabbage a good round piece of pork. it was the first time

they had had flesh to eat since they killed their own ox,
and wang lung's eyes widened.

'you must have begged of a foreigner this day,' he
said to o-lan. but she, according to her habit, said no-
thing. then the younger boy, too young for wisdom and
filled with his own pride of cleverness, said:

'i took it — it is mine, this meat. when the butcher
looked the other way after he had sliced it off from the big
piece upon the counter, i ran under an old woman's arm
who had come to buy it and i seized it and ran into an
alley and hid in a dry water jar at a back gate until elder
brother came.'

'now will i not eat this meat!' cried wang lung angr

ily.
'we will eat meat that we can buy or beg, but not
that which we steal. beggars we may be but thieves
we are not.' and he took the meat out of the pot with
his two fingers and threw it upon the ground and was heed-
less of the younger lad's howling*

92



then o-lan came forward in her stolid fashion and she /
picked up the meat and washed it off with a little water
and thrust it back into the boiling pot.

'meat is meat,' she said quietly.

wang lung said nothing then, but he was angry and"
afraid in his heart because his sons were growing into
thieves here ii\ this city. and although he said nothing
when o-lan pulled the tender cooked flesh apart with her
chopsticks, and although he said nothing when she gave
great pieces of it to the old man and to the

the older men and women, it is true, said nothing to any
one. greybeards pulled rickshaws, pushed wheelbarrows of
coal and wood to bakeries and palaces, strained their backs
until the muscles stood forth like ropes as they pushed
and pulled the heavy carts of merchandise over the cobbled
roads, ate frugally of their scanty food, slept their brief
nights out, and were silent. their faces were like the face
of o-lan, inarticulate, dumb. none knew what was in their
minds. if they spoke at all it was of food or of pence.
rarely was the word silver upon their lips because rarely
was silver in their hands.

their faces in repose were twisted as though in anger,
only it was not anger. it was the years of straining at loads
too heavy for them which had lifted their upper lips to
bare their teeth in a seeming snarl, and this labour had
set deep wrinkles in the flesh about their eyes and their
mouths. they themsel

he had eaten he could not sleep at once as was his wont,

here his old father habitually sat, squatting on his thighs
and leaning against the wall, and here he sat now, having
taken his bowl of food there to sup it, now that the chil-
dren filled the hut to bursting when they were clamouring.
the old man held in one hand the end of a loop of cloth
which o-lan had torn from her girdle, and within this loop
the girl child staggered to and fro without falling. thus he
spent his days looking after this child who had now grown
rebellious at having to be in her mother's bosom as she
begged. besides this, o-lan was again with child and the
pressure of the larger child upon her from without was too
painful to bear.

wang lung watched the child falling and scrambling
and falling again and the old man pulling at the loop ends,
and standing thus he felt upon h

 they also would go back, if not this year, then
next, said wang to his own heart. as long as there was
the land! and the thought of it lying there, waiting for
him, rich with the spring rains, filled him with desire. he
went back to the hut and he said roughly to his wife :

'if i had anything to sell i would sell it and go back
to the land. or if it were not for the old head, we would
walk though we starved. but how can he and the small
child walk a hundred miles? and you, with your burden!'

o-lan had been rinsing the rice bowls with a little water
and now she piled them in a corner of the hut and looked
up at him from the spot where she squatted.

'there is nothing to sell except the girl,' she answered
slowly.

wang lung's breath caught.

9 <s



'now, i would not sell a child!' he said loudly.

'i was sold,' she answered very slowly. 'i was sold to a
great house so that my parents could return to their home.'

"and would you sellthe child, therefore?'

'if it were only i, she would be

could go to dig the small green weeds, dandelions and
shepherd's purse that thrust up feeble new leaves, and it
was not necessary as it had been to snatch at vegetables here
and there. a swarm of ragged women and children issued
forth each day from the huts, and with bits of tin and sharp
stones or worn knives, and with baskets made of twisted
bamboo twigs or split reeds they searched the countrysides
and the roadways for the food they could get without
begging and without money. and every day o-lan went
out with this swarm, o-lan and the two boys.

but men must work, and w'ang lung worked on as he
had before, although the lengthening warm days and the
sunshine arid sudden rains filled every one with longings
and discontents. in the winter they had worked and been
silent, enduring stolidly the snow and ice under their straw-
sandalled feet, going back at dark to their huts and eating
without words such food as the day's labour and begging
had brought, falling heavily to sleep, men, women a

 to gain that for their bodies which the food
was too poor and too scanty to give. thus it was in wang

lung's hut, and well he knew it must be so in every other.

but with the coming of spring talk began to surge up
out of their hearts and to make itself heard on their lips.
in the evening when the twilight lingered they gathered
out of their huts and talked together, and wang lung saw
this one and that of the men who had lived near him and
whom through the winter he had not known. had o-lan
been one to tell him things he might have heard, for in-
stance, of this one who beat his wife, of that one who
had a leprous disease that ate his cheeks out, of that other
who was king of a gang of thieves; but beyond the spare
questions and answers she asked and gave she was silent.
and so wang lung stood diffidently on the edge of the
circle and listened to the talk.

most of these ragged men had nothing beyond what
they took in the day's labour and begging, and he was
always conscious that

s. the two boys cried out in delight and horror:
\ 'and see the blood streaming out of his side!'
and the old man said:

'surely this was a very evil man to be thus hung.'

but wang lung was fearful of the picture and pon-
dered as to why a foreigner had given it to him : whether or
not some brother of this foreigner's had not been so treat-
ed and the other brethren sought revenge. he avoided,
therefore, the street on which he had met the man and
after a few days, when the paper was forgotten, o-lan took
it and sewed it into a shoe sole together with other bits of



102



paper she picked up here and there to make the soles firm.

but the next time one handed a paper freely to wang
lung it was a man of the city, a young man well clothed,
who talked loudly as he^disffibuted sheets hither and thither
among the crowds who swarm about anything new and
strange in a street. this paper bore also a picture of blood
and death, but the man who died this time was not white-
skinned and hairy but a

it rain when it will
not, but what has this to do with us? if the rich would
share with us what they have, rain or not would matter to
none, because we would all have money and food.'

a great shout went up from those who listened, but
wang lung turned away unsatisfied. yes, but there was
the land. money and food are eaten and gone, and if there
is not sun and rain in proportion, there is again hunger.
nevertheless, he took willingly the papers the young man
gave him, because he remembered that o-lan had never
enough paper for the shoe soles-, and so he gave them to
her when he went home, saying:

'now there is some stuff for the shoe soles,' and he
worked as before.

but of the men in the huts with whom he talked at eve-
ning there were many who heard eagerly what the young
man said, the more eagerly because they knew that over
the wall there dwelt a rich man and it seemed a small thing
that between them and his riches there was only this layer
of bricks, which might be torn down with a fe

the steam he
saw what wang lung could not see from where he crouch-
ed, that once more the soldiers approached, searching the
streets from which now every able-bodied working man
had fled.

'stoop yet more,' he said to wang lung. 'they are come
again..'

and wang lung crouched low behind the cauldrons
and the soldiers clattered down the cobbles to the west,
and when the sound of their leathern boots was gone wang
lung darted out and seizing his rickshaw he ran with it
empty to the hut.

then to o-lan, who had but just returned from the road-
side to cook a little of the green stuff she had gathered,
he told in broken, panting words what was happening and
how nearly he had not escaped, and as he spoke this new
horror sprang up in him — that he be dragged to battle-
fields, and that not only his old father and his family be
left alone to starve, but that he be slain upon a battlefield
and his blood be spilled out, and he nevermore be able to
see his own land. he looked at o-lan haggardly an

at, his
bare feet slipping on the cobbles, slimy and wet as they
were with dampness of the night. before them to show
the way ran a little lad carrying a flaming torch and in the
light of this torch the faces and the bodies of the men and
the wet stones glistened alike. and wang lung came home
before dawn, gasping and too broken for food until he had
slept. but during the bright day when the soldiers searched
the street he slept safely in the furthermost corner of the
hut behind a pile of straw o-lan gathered to make a shield
for him.

what battles there were or who fought which other one
wang lung did not know. but with the further coming of
spring the city became filled with the unrest of fear. all
during the days carriages drawn by horses pulled rich men
and their possessions of clothing and satin-covered bedding
and their beautiful women and their jewels to the river's
edge where ships carried them away to other places, and
some went to that other house where fire- wagons came and
went.

w means?' the lad cried wist-
fully:

'oh, i wish we might go even now and get it if it is
ours. i should like to taste a cake. i have never tasted a
sweet cake with sesame seed sprinkled on the top.'

the old man looked up from his dreaming at this and
he said as one croons to himself:

'when we had a good harvest w r e had such cakes at
the autumn feast, when the sesame had been threshed and
before it was sold we kept a little back to make such cakes.'

and wang lung remembered the cakes that o-lan had
once made at the new year's feast, cakes of rice-flour and
lard and sugar, and his mouth watered and his heart pained
him with longing for that which was passed.

'if we were only back on our land,' he muttered.

then suddenly it seemed to him that not one more day
could he lie in this wretched hut, which was not wide enough
for him even to stretch his length in behind the pile of
straw, nor could he another night strain the hours through,
his body bent against a rope cutting into his flesh
 
 ___________________________
 
and the streets were wet and more
wet than usual, that the whole hatred of his heart went out
against these stones under his feet, these stones that seemed
to cling and to hang to the wheels of his inhuman load.

'ah, the fair land!' he cried out suddenly and fell [to
weeping so that the children were frightened and the old
man, looking at his son in consternation, twisted his face
this way and that under his sparse beard, as a child's face
twists when he sees his mother weep.

and again it was o-lan who said in her flat, plain voice:

'yet a little while and we shall see a thing. there is talk
everywhere now.'

108



from his hut where wang lung lay hid he heard hour
after hour the passing of feet, the feet of soldiers marching
to battle. lifting sometimes a very little the mat which
stood between thern and him, he put one eye to the crack
and he saw these feet^assing, passing, leather shoes and
cloth covered legs, marching one after the other, pair by
pair, score upon score, thousands up
 
 ___________________________
 

then suddenly aststsat^there came a noise like the crack-
ing of heaven and every one of them fell unthinking on
the ground and hid their faces, for it seemed as though the
hideous roar would catch them all up and crush them.
and wang lung covered the girl child's face with his hand,
not knowing what horror might appear to them out of
this dreadful din, and the old man called out into wang
lung's ear, 'now this i have never heard before in all my
years,' and the two boys yelled with fear.

but o-lan, when silence had fallen as suddenly as it
had gone, lifted her head and said, 'now that which i
have heard of has come to pass. the enemy has broken
in the gates of the city.' and before any could answer her
there was a shout over the city, a rising shout of human
voices, at first faint, as one may hear the wind of a storm
approaching, then gathering in a deep howl, louder and
more loud till it filled the streets.

wang lung sat erect then, on the floor of his hut, and
a strange fear crept ove

ere was only the noise of the gathering
of human beings and each man howling.

then over the wall and not far from them they heard
the sound of a great door creaking upon its hinges and
groaning as it opened unwillingly, and suddenly the man
who had talked to wang lung once at dusk asjd smoked
a short bamboo pipe, thrust his head in at the hut's open-
ing and cried out: ^
'now do you still sit here? the hour has come — the
gates of the rich man are open to us!' and as if by magic
of some kind o-lan was gone, creeping out under the man's
arm as he spoke.

then wang lung rose up, slowly and half dazed, and



he set the girl child down and he went out and there before
the great iron gates of the rich man's house a multitude of
clamouring common people pressed forward, howling
together the deep, tigerish howl that he had heard rising
and swelling out of the streets, and he knew that at the
gates of all rich men there pressed this howling multitude
of men and women who had been starved and im

lling of its shoulder against the wooden yoke
and he called out:

'that is a worthless ox! what will you sell it for in
silver or gold, seeing that i have no animal and am hard
put to it and willing to take anything?'

and the farmer called back:

c i would sooner sell my wife than this ox which is but
three years old and in its prime,' and he ploughed on and
would not stop for wang lung.

then it seemed to wang lung as if out of all the oxen
the world held he must have this one, and he said to o-lan
and to his father:

"how is it for an ox?'

and the old man peered and said, c it seems a beast
well castrated.'

and o-lan said, 'it is a year older than he says.'

but wang lung answered nothing because upon this
ox he had set his heart because of its sturdy pulling of the
soil and because of its smooth yellow coat and its full, dark
eye. with this ox he could plough his fields and cultivate
them, and with this ox tied to his mill he could grind the
grain. and he went to the farmer and said:

r who was passing through to battle.

then wang lung set himself robustly to the soil and
he begrudged even the hours he must spend in the house
for food and sleep. he loved rather to take his roll of
bread and garlic to the field and stand there eating, planning
and thinking. 'here shall i put the black-eyed peas and
here the young rice beds.' and if he grew too weary in
i the day he laid himself into a furrow, and there, with the
good warmth of his own land against , his flesh, he slept.

and o-lan in the house was not idle. with her own
hands she lashed the mats firmly to the rafters and took
earth from the fields and mixed it with water and mended
the walls of the house, and she built again the oven and
filled the holes in the floor that the rain had washed.

then she went into the town one day with wang lung
and together they bought beds and a table and six benches
and a great iron cauldron and then they bought for pleasure
a red clay teapot with a black flower marked on it in ink,
j a

ntent and he said aloud, as one
might speak to a punished child:

'thus it is with gods who do evil to men!'

nevertheless, when the house was itself again, and the

xi8



pewter candlesticks gleaming and the candles burning in
them shining red, anctthe teapot and the bowls upon the
table and the beds in their places with a little bedding
once more, and fresh paper pasted over the hole in the
room where he slept and a new door hung upon its wooden
hinges, wang lung was afraid of his happiness. o-lan
grew great with the next child; his children tumbled like
brown puppies about his threshold and against the southern
wall his old father sat and dozed and smiled as he slept;
in his fields the young rice sprouted as green as jade and
more beautiful, and the young beans lifted their hooded
heads from the soil. and out of the gold there was still
enough left to feed them until the harvest, if they ate
sparingly. looking at the blue heaven above him and the
white clouds driving across it, feeling

they har-
vested it.

he remembered also the idle young lords of the fallen
great house as he worked on the land he had bought from
the house of hwang, and he bade his two sons sharply
each morning to come into the fields with him and he set
them at what labour their small hands could do, guiding
the ox and the ass, and making them, if they could accom-
plish no great labour, at least to know the heat of the sun
on their bodies and the weariness of walking back and forth
along the furrows.

but o-lan he would not allow to work in the fields, for
he was no longer a poor man, but a man who could hire
labour if he would; and never had the land given forth
such harvests as it had this year. he was compelled to build
yet another room to the house to store his harvests in, or
they would not have had space to walk in the house. and
he bought three pigs and a flock of fowls to feed on the
grains spilled from the harvests.

then o-lan worked in the house and made new clothes
for each one and new sho

 when all was finished they were rich in clothing and
in bedding as they had never been. then she laid herself
down upon her bed and gave birth again, although still
she would have no one with her; even though she could
hire whom she chose, she chose to be alone.

this time she was long at labour and when wang lung
came home at evening he found his father standing at the
door and laughing and saying :

'an egg with a double yolk this time!'

and when wang lung went into the inner room there
was o-lan upon the bed with tw t o new-born children, a
boy and a girl as alike as two grains of rice. he laughed



130



boisterously at what she had done and then he thought
tff a merry thing to say:

'so this is why you bore two jewels in your bosom!'

and he laughed again at what he had thought of to
say, and o-lan, seeing how merry he was, smiled her slow,
painful smile.

<r wang lung had, therefore, at this time no sorrow of
any kind /unless it was this sorrow, that his eldest girl
child nei/ther

hese two had nothing to say to a man prosperous and
vigorous. when wang lung had poured the old man a
bowl of tea and had passed his hand over the girl's cheek
and received her sweet, empty smile, which passed with
such sad swiftness from her face, leaving empty the dim
and unshining eyes, there was nothing left. he always turned

137



away from her with a moment's stillness, which was his
daughter's mark of sadness on him, and he looked to his
two younger children, the boy and the girl which o-lan
had borne together and who now ran about the threshold
merrily.

but a man cannot be satisfied with the foolishness of
little children, and after a brief time of laughter and teas-
ing they went off to their own games and wang lung was
alone and filled with restlessness. then it was that he looked
at o-lan, his wife, as a man looks at the woman whose body
he knows thoroughly and to satiation and who has lived
beside him so closely that there is nothing he does not
know of her and nothing new wh

ich he may expect or
hope from her.

and it seemed to wang lung that he looked at o-lan
for the first time in his life and he saw for the first time
that she was a woman whom no man could call other than
\ she was, a dull and common creature, who plodded in
silence without thought of how she appeared to others. he
saw for the first time that her hair was rough and brown
and unoiled and that her face was large and flat and coarse-
skinned, and her features too large altogether and without
| any sort of beauty or light. her eyebrows were scattered
? and the hairs too few, and her li

e flung himself off because he was ashamed that
he was angry at her and angry because she would not be
angry in return but only was frightened. and he drew his
new black robe on him, saying fretfully:

'well, and i will go to the tea-shop and see if i can hear
anything new. there is nothing in my house except fools
and a dotard and two children.'

his ill-temper grew as he walked to the town because
he remembered suddenly that all these new lands of his he
could not have bought in a lifetime if o-lan had not seized
the handful of jewels from the rich man's house and if she
had not given them to him when he commanded her. but



*39



when he remembered this he was the more angry and he
said as if to answer his own heart rebelliously :

4 well, and but she did not. know whar she did. she seized
them for pleasure as a child may seize a handful of red and
green sweets, and she would have hidden them for ever in
her bosom if i had not found it out.'

then he wondered if she still hid the pearl

 or if a child had fallen ill or the old
man had reached suddenly to the end of his days, w t ang
lung might have been caught up in the new thing and so
forgotten the pointed face upon the scroll and the body
of the woman slender as a bamboo.

but except for the slight summer wind that rose at
sunset, the waters lay placid and unmoved, and the old
man dozed, and the two boys trudged to school at dawn
and were away until evening, and in his house wang lung
was restless and he avoided the eyes of o-lan, who looked
at him miserably as he went here and there and flung him-
self down in a chair and rose from it without drinking the
tea she poured and without smoking the pipe he had lit.
at the end of one long day, more long than any other, in
the seventh month, when the twilight lingered murmurous
and sweet with the breath of the lake, he stood at the door
of his house, and suddenly without a word he turned
abruptly and went into his room and put on his new coat,
even the coat of black shining c

loth, as shining almost as
silk, that o-lan made for feast days, and with no word to
any one he went over the narrow paths along the water's
edge and through the fields until he came to the darkness
of the city gate and through this he went and through the
streets until he came to the new tea-shop.

there every light was lit, bright oil lamps which are to
be bought in the foreign cities of the coast, and men sat
under the lights drinking and talking, their robes open to
the evening coolness, and everywhere fans moved to and
fro and good

night
again he was the country fellow who knew nothing, trem-
bling at the door, sitting stiffly beside her, waiting for her
signal of laughter, and then fevered, filled with a sickened
hunger, he followed slavishly, bit by bit, her unfolding,
until the moment of crisis, when, like a flower that is ripe
for plucking, she was willing that he should grasp her
wholly.

yet never could he grasp her wholly, and this it was
which kept him fevered and thirsty, even if she gave him
hetwill of her. when o-lan had come to his house it was
health to his flesh and he lusted for her robustly as a beast
for its mate, and he took her and was satisfied and he
forgot her and did his work content. but there was no
such content now in his love for this girl, and there was no
health in her for him. at night when she would have no
more of him, pushing him out of the door petulantly, with
her small hands suddenly strong on his should.ers, his silver
thrust into her bosom, he went away hungry as he came.

could not understand.

and if any spoke to him, his wife or his children, or if
ching came to him and said, c the waters will soon recede
and what is there we should prepare of seed?' he shouted
and said:

'why do you trouble me?'

and all the time his heart was like to burst because he
could not be satisfied of this girl.

thus as the days went on and he lived only to pass
the day until the evening came, he would not look at the
grave faces of o-lan and of the children, suddenly sober in
their play when he approached, nor even at his old father
who peered at him and asked:

'what is this sickness that turns you full of evil temper
and your skin as yellow as clay?'

and as these days went past to the night, the girl lotus
did what she would with him. when she laughed at the
braid of his hair, although part of every day he spent
in braiding and in brushing it, and said, 'now the men
of the south do not have these monkey tails!' he went

ut a word and had it cut off, although neither by
laughter or scorn had any one been able to persuade him
to it before.

when o-lan saw what he had done she burst out in
terror :

\~ 'you have cut off your life!'
but he shouted at her:

'and shall i look an old-fashioned fool for ever? all
the young men of the city have their hair cut short.'

150



yet he was afraid in his heart of what he had done,
and yet so he would have cut off his life if the girl lotus
had commanded it or desired it, because she had every
beauty wljiich had ever come into his mind to desire in a
woman. \

his good brown body that he washed but rarel

her man's, and he washed himself every day so
that his wife said, troubled:

'you will die with all this washing!'

he bought sweet-smelling soap in the shop, a piece of
red' scented stuff from foreign parts, and he rubbed it on
his flesh, and not for any price would he have eaten a
stalk of garlic, although it was a thing he had loved be-
fore, lest he stink before the girl lotus.

and none in his house knew what to make of all these
things.

he bought also new stuffs for clothes, and although
o-lan had always cut his robes, making them wide and
long for good measure and sewing them stoutly this way
and that for strength, now he was scornful of her cutting
and sewing and he took the stuffs to a tailor in the town
and he had his clothes made as the men in the town had
theirs, light grey silk for a robe, cut neatly to his body
and with little to spare, and over this a black satin sleeve-
less coat. and he bought the first shoes he had had in
his life not made by a woman, and they were black

velvet
shoes such as the old lord had worn flapping at his heels.

but these fine clotjies he was ashamed to wear sud-
denly before o-lan and his children. he kept them folded
in sheets of brown oiled paper and he left them at the tea-
shop with a clerk he had come to know, ^nd for a price
the clerk let him go into an inner room secretly and put
them on before he went up the stairs. and beyond this
he bought a silver ring washed with gold* for his finger,
and as hair grew where it had been shaved above his fore-
head, he smoothed it with a fragrant foreign oil from a
small bottle for which he had paid a whole piece of silver.
but
 
 ___________________________
 
 o-lan looked at him in astonishment and did not

151



know what to make of all this, except that one day after
staring at him for a long time as they ate rice at noon, she
said heavily:

^ 'there is that about you which makes me think of one

of the lords in the great house.'

wang lung laughed loudly then and he said :

'and am i always to look like a hind when we have

enough and to spare?'

but in his heart he was greatly pleased and for that

day he was more kindly with her than he had been for

of her hair
that he might have the delight of seeing her small long-
lobed ears:

'and so will i buy a gold pin for the hair of my jewel.'

for all these names of love she had taught him, as one
teaches new words to a child. she had taught him to say
them to her and he could not say them enough for his
own heart, even while he stammered them, he whose
speech had all his life been only of planting and of harvests
and of sun and rain.

thus the silver came out of the wall and out of the
sack, and o-lan who in the old days might have said to
him easily enough, 'and why do you take the money from
the wall,' now said nothing, only watching him in great
misery, knowing well that he was living some life apart



152



from her and apart even from the land, but not knowing
what life it was. but she had been afraid of him from
that day when he had seen clearly that she had no beauty
of hair or of person and when he had seen her feet were
large, and she was afraid to ask him anything, because of ^

wered her loudly, hardening his heart:

'why should that one wear pearls with her skin as
black as earth? pearls are for fair women!' and then after
an instant's silence he cried out suddenly, 'give them to
me — i have need of them!'

then slowly she thrust her wet wrinkled hand into her
bosom and she drew forth the small package and she gave \
it to him and watched him as he unwrapped it; and the )
pearls lay in his hand they caught softly and fully the
light of the sun, and he laughed.

but o-lan returned to the beating of his clothes, and }
when tears dropped slowly and heavily from her eyes she
did not put up her hand to wipe them away; only she beat
the more steadily with her wooden stick upon the clothes
spread over the stone.

and thus it might have gone on until all the
silver was spent, had not that one, wang lung's uncle
returned suddenly without explanation of where he had
been or of what he had done. he stood in the door as
though he had dropped from a cloud, hi

lung was exceedingly angry and the more angry
because he must bury it all in his heart and answer with
smiles and welcome his relatives. this, although when he
saw the fat smooth face of his uncle's wife he felt fit to
burst with his anger, and when he saw the scampish, im-
pudent face of his uncle's son, he could scarcely keep his
hand down from slapping it! and for three days he did
not go into the town because of his anger.

then when they were all accustomed to what had taken
place and when o-lan had said to him, 'cease to be angry.
it is a thing to be borne,' and wang lung saw that his



155



uncle and his uncle's wife and son would be courteous
enough for the sake of their food and their shelter, then
his thoughts turned more violently than ever to the girl
lotus and he muttered to himself:

'when a man's house is full of wild dogs he must seek
peace elsewhere.'

and all the old fever and pain burned in him and he
was still never satisfied of his love.

now what o-lan had not seen 
 
 ___________________________
 
in her simplicity nor the
old man because of the dimness of his age nor ching be-
cause of his friendship, the wife of wang lung's uncle
saw at once and she cried out, the laughter slanting from
her eyes:

'now wang lung is seeking to pluck a flower some-
where.' and when o-lan looked at her humbly, not un-
derstanding, she laughed and said again, 'the melon must
always be spilt wide open before you can see the seeds,
eh? well, then, plainly, your man is mad over another
woman!'

this wang lung heard his uncle's wife say in the court
outside his window as he lay dozing and weary in his room
one early morning, exhausted with his love. he was quickly
awake, and he listened further, aghast at the sharpness of
this woman's eyes. the thick voice rumbled on, pouring
like oi
 
 ___________________________
 
l from her fat throat.

'well, and i have seen many a man, and when— one
smooths his hair and buys new clothes and will have his
shoes velvet all of a sudden, then there is a new woman
and that is sure.'

there came a broken sound from o-lan, what it was
she said he could not hear, but his uncle's wife said again :
^^and it is not to be thought, poor fool, that one woman
is enough for any man, and if that one is a weary hard-
working woman who has worn away her flesh working for
him, she is less than enough for him. his fancy runs else-
where the more cjuickly, and you, poor fool, have never
been fit for ; a man's fancy and little better than an ox for
his labour. and it is not for you to repine when he has
money and buys himself a
 
 ___________________________
 
 work of any kind in my house but she shall wear only
silken garments and eat shark's fins if she will every day,'
until at last the fat woman grew impatient and cried out at
him, rolling her eyes back and forth:

'enough and enough! am i a fool, or is this the first
time i have managed a man and a maid? leave me alone
and i will do it. i have said everything many times.'

then there was nothing to do except to gnaw his fingers
and to see the house suddenly, as lotus might see it and
he hurried o-lan into this and that, sweeping and washing
and moving tables and chairs, so that she, poor woman,

158



grew more and more terror-stricken, for well she knew by 1
now, although he said nothing, what was to come to her.

now wang lung could not bear to sleep any more with
o-lan and he said to himself that with two women in the
house there must be more rooms and another court and
there must be a place where he could go with his love and
be separate. so while he waited for his uncle's wife to
comp

oors for curtains and he bought a new table
and two carved chairs to put on either side and two painted
scrolls of pictured hills and water to hang upon the wall
behind the table.

and he bought a round red lacquered comfit dish with
a cover, and in this he jput sesame cakes and larded sweets
; and he put'teetjox on the table. then he bought a wide
and deep carven be37big enough for a small room in itself,
land he bought flowered curtains to hang about it. but in
jail this he was ashamed to ask o-lan anything, and so in
the evenings his uncle's wife came in and she hung the
bed curtains and did the things a man is too clumsy to do.

then all was finished and there was nothing to do, and
a moon of days had passed and the thing was not yet
complete. so wang lung dallied alone in the little new
court he had built for lotus and he thought of a little pool
to make in the centre of the court, and he called a labourer
and the man dug a pool three feet square and set it about

 and wang lung went into the city and bought
five goldfish for it. then he could think of nothing more
to be done, and again he waited impatient and fevered.

t)uring all this time he said nothing to any one except to
scold the children if they were filthy at their noses or to roar
out at o-lan that she had not brushed her hair for three
days and more, so that at last one morning o-lan burst
into tears and wept aloud, as he had never seen her weep
before; even when they starved, or at any other time. he
said harshly, therefore:

'now^ what, woman? cannot i say comb out your
horse's tail of hair without this trouble over it?'

but she answered nothing except to say over and over,
moaning:

'i have borne you sons — i have borne you sons '

and he was silenced and uneasy acid muttered to himself,
for he was ashamed before her and so he let her alone.
it was true that before th

ring and swaying upon her little feet, and leaning upon
cuckoo. and as she passed him she did not speak to him,
but she whispered only to cuckoo, faintly:

'where is my apartment?'

then his uncle's wife came forward to her other side j
and between them they led the girl into the court and into !
the new rooms that wang lung had built for her. and of
all wang lung's house there was none to see her pass, for j
he had sent the labourers and ching away for the day to j
work on a distant field, and o-lan had gone somewhere he
knew not and had taken the two little ones with her and
the boys were in school and the old man slept against the
wall and heard and saw nothing, and as for the poor fool, j
she saw no one who came and went and knew no face
except her father's and her mother's. but when lotus had
gone in cuckoo drew the curtains after her. j

then after a time wang lung's uncle's wife came out,
laughing a little maliciously, and she dusted her hands
together as though to free them of somet

and it will be as sweet as the eight jewelled rice at a feast
after your years with the thick-boned slave from the house

but wang lung answered nothing, only he moved here
and there through the house and he listened and he could
not be still. at last he dared to lift the red curtain and to
go into the court he had built for lotus and then into
the darkened room where she was and there he was beside
her for the whole day until night. ^

all this time o-lan had not come near the house. at
dawn she had taken a hoe from the wall and she called the
children and she took a little cold food wrapped up in
a cabbage leaf and she had not returned. but when night
came on she entered, silent and earth-stained and dark
with weariness, and the children silent behind her, and she
said nothing to any one, but she went into the kitchen and i
prepared food and set it upon the table as she always did,
and she called the old man and put the chopsticks in his
hand a

and he ate and drank of his love and he feasted alone,
and he was satisfied.

it was not to be supposed that the coming
of this one called lotus and of her serving-woman
cuckoo into wang lung's house could be accomplished
altogether without stir and discord of some sort, since,
more than one woman under one roof is not for peace.
but wang lung had not foreseen it. and even though he
saw by o-lan's sullen looks and cuckoo's sharpness that
something was amiss, he would not pay heed to it and he
was careless of any one so long as he was still fierce with
his desire.

nevertheless, when day passed into night, and night,
changed into dawn, wang lung saw. that it was true the
sun rose in the morning, and this woman lotus was there,
and the moon rose in its season and she was there for his
hand to grasp when it would, and his thirst of love was
somewhat slaked and he saw things he had not see
 
 ___________________________
 
n before.*

for one thing, he saw that there was trouble at once
between o-lan and cuckoo. this was an astonishment to



164



him, for he was\prepared for o-lan to hate lotus, having
heard many times of such things, and some women will
even hang themselves upon a beam with a rope when a
man takes a second woman into the house, and others will
scold and contrive to make his life worthless for what he ,
has done, and he was glad that o-lan was a silent woman, \
for at least she could not think of words against him. but
he had not foreseen that whereas she would be silent of
lotus, her anger would find its vent against cuckoo.

now wang lung had thought only of lotus and when
she begged him:

'let me have this woman for my servant, seeing thaf^
i am altogether alone in the world, for my father and my
mother died when i could not yet walk and my uncle sold
me as soon as i was pretty to a life such as i have had,
and i have no one.'
 
 ___________________________
 


this she said with her tears, always abundant and ready
and glittering in the corners of her pretty eyes, and wang
lung could have denied her nothing she asked when she
looked up at him so. besides, it was true enough that the
girl had no one to serve her, and it was true she would be
alone in his house, for it was plain enough and to be
expected that o-lan would not serve the second one, and
she would not speak to her or notice that she was in the
house at all. there was only the uncle of lotus then, and
it was against wang lung's stomach to have that one
peeping and prying and near to lotus for her to talk to
of him, and so cuckoo was as good as any and he knew
no other woman who would come. — .

but it seemed that o-lan, when she saw t cuckoo, grew )
angry with a deep and sullen anger that wang lung had /
never seen and did not know was in he

r. cuckoo was
willing enough to be friends, since she had her pay from
wang lung, albeit she did not forget that in the great house
she had been in the lord's chamber and o-lan a kitchen slave
and one of many. nevertheless, she called out to o-lan
well enough when first she saw her :

'well, and my old friend, here we are in a house together i
again, and you mistress and first wife — my mother — and
how things are changed!'



i6 5



but o-lan only stared at her and when it came into
her understanding who it was and what she was, she
answered nothing but she put down the jar of water she
carried and she went into the middle room where wang
lung sat between his times of love, and she said to him
plainly :

'what is this slave woman doing in our house?'

wang lung looked east and west. he would have liked
to speak out and to say in a surly voice of master, 'well,
and it is my house and whoever i say may come in, she
shall come in, and 
 
 ___________________________
 
who are you to ask?' but he could
not because of some shame in him when o-lan was there
before him, and his shame made him angry, because when
he reasoned it, there was no need for shame and he had
done no more than any man may do who has silver to spare.

still, he could not speak out, and he only looked east
and west and feigned to have mislaid his pipe in his
garments, and he fumbled in his girdle. but o-lan stood
there solidly on her big feet and waited and when he said
nothing she asked again plainly in the same words:

'what is this slave woman doing in our house?'

then wang lung, seeing she would have an answer
said feebly:

'and what is it to you?'

and o-lan said:

'i bore her haughty looks all during my youth in the
great house and her running into the kitchen a score of
times a day and crying out "now tea for the lord" — "now
food for the lord" — and it was always this is too hot and
t

hat is too cold, and that is badly cooked, and i was too
ugly and too slow and too this and too that . . .'

but still wang lung did not answer, for he did not
know what to say.

then o-lan waited and when he did riot speak, the
hot scanty tears welled slowly into her eyes, and she
winked them to hold back the tears, and at last she took
the corner of her blue apron and wiped her eyes and she
said at last:

'it is a bitter thing in my own house, and i have no
mother's house to go back to anywhere.'

1 66



and when wang lung was still silent and answered
nothing at all, but he sat down to his pipe and lit it, and
he said nothing still, she looked at him piteously and sadly
out of

that cannot speak, and then she went away, creeping and
feeling for the door because of her tears that blinded her.

wang lung watched her as she went and he was glad
to be alone, but still he was ashamed and he was still
angry that he was ashamed and he said to himself and he
muttered the words aloud and restlessly, as though he
quarrelled with some one:

'well, and other men are so and i have been good
enough to her, and there are men worse than i.' and he
said at last that o-lan must bear it.

but o-lan was not finished with it, and she went her
way silently. in the morning she heated water and pre-
sented it to the old man, and to wang lung if he were
not in the inner court she presented tea, but when cuckoo
went to find hot water for her mistress the cauldron was
empty and not all her loud questionings would stir any.
response from o-lan. then there was nothing but that
cuckoo must herself boil water for her mistress if she would
have it. but then it was time to stir

 the morning gruel
and there was not space in the cauldron for more water
and o-lan would go steadily to her cooking, answering
nothing to cuckoo's loud crying:

c and is my delicate lady to lie thirsting and gasping in
her bed for a swallow of water in the morning?'

but o-lan would not hear her; only she pushed more grass
and straw into the bowels of the oven, spreading it as
carefully and as thriftily as ever she had in the old days
when one leaf was precious enough because of the fire it
would make under food. then cuckoo went complaining
loudly to wang lung and he was angry that his love must
be marred by such things and he went to o-lan to reproach
her and he shouted at her:

'and cannot you add a dipperful of water to the cauldron
in the mornings?'

but she ans

wered with a sullenness deeper than ever
upon her face:

' 'i am not slave of slaves in this house at least.'

r then he was angry beyond bearing and he seized o-lan's

shoulder and he shook her soundly and he said:

| 'do not be yet more of a fool. it is not for the servant

but for the mistress.'

and she bore his violence and she looked at him and
she said simply:

i 'and to that one you gave my two pearls!'
i then his hand dropped and he was speechless and his
^nger was gone and he. went away ashamed and he said
!to cuckoo:

ad to buy for lotus and that she grew
fat and more oily than she had been, but he could say
nothing, for his uncle's wife was clever and she was
courteous to him and flattered him with good words and
rose when he came into the room.

and so his love for lotus was not whole and perfect
as it had been before, absorbing utterly his mind and his
body. it was pierced through and through with small
angers which were the more sharp because they must be
endured and because he could no longer go even to o-lan
freely for speech, seeing that now their life was sundered.

then like a field of thorns springing up from one root
and spreading here and there, there was yet more to trouble
wang lung. one day his father, whom one would say saw
nothing at any time so drowsy with age he was, woke sud-
denly out of his sleeping in the sun and he tottered, lean-
ing on his dragon-headed staff which wang lung had
bought for him on his seventieth birthday, to the doorway
where a curtain hung between the main room 
 
 ___________________________
 
g time away and there were suddenly a multitude
of things he had to do. the land clamoured for ploughing
and planting and day after day he laboured at it, and the
paleness which the summer of his love had set on his flesh
darkened to a deep brown under the sun, and his hands,
which had peeled off their calloused parts under the idle-
ness of love, hardened again where the hoe pressed and
where the plough handles set their mark.

when he came in at noon and at night he ate well of
the food which o-lan prepared for him, good rice and cab-
bage and bean-curd, and good garlic rolled into wheat
bread. when lotus held her small nose under her hand
at his coming and cried out at his reek, he laughed and
cared nothing and he breathed out his stout breath at her
and she must bear it as she could for he would eat of
what he liked. and now that he was full of health again
and free of the sickness of his love he could go to her
and be finished with her and turn himself to other things.

^so these two w

lotus for his toy and his pleasure and to satisfy his delight
in beauty and in smallness and in the joy of her pure sex, /
and o-lan for his woman of work and the mother who had
borne his sons and who kept his house and fed him and
his father and his children!} and it was a pride to wang
jlung in the village that men mentioned with envy the
woman in his inner court; it was as though men spoke of
a rare jewel or an expensive toy that was useless except
i that it was sign and symbol of a man who had passed
beyond the necessity of caring only to be fed and clothed
and could spend his money on joy if he wished.

and foremost amo

e mornings rise out of his bed to go to
school unless wang lung bawled at him or even beat him,
and then he went sullenly and sometimes he spent whole
days idling about the streets of the town, and wang lung
only knew it at night, when the younger boy said spite-
fully:

'elder brother was not in school to-day.'

wang lung was angry at his eldest son then and he
shouted at him:

c and am i to spend good silver for nothing?'

and in his anger he fell upon the boy with a bamboo
and beat him until o-lan, the boy's mother, heard it and
rushed in from the kitchen and stood between her son (
and his father so that the blows rained upon her in spite
of wang lung's turning this way and that to get at the
boy. now the strange thing was that whereas the boy
might burst into weeping at a chance rebuke, he stood
these beatings under the bamboo without a sound, his
face carven and pale as an image. and wang lung could
make nothing of it, although he thought of it night and day.

he thought of it one eve

ning thus after he had eaten
his night's food, because on that day he had beaten his
eldest son for not going to the school, and while he thought, y
o-lan came into the room. she came in silently and she
stood before wang lung and he saw she had that which
she wished to say. so he said:

'say on. what is it, mother of my son?'

and she said, 'it is useless for you to beat the lad as
you do. i have seen this thing come upon the young
lords in the courts of the great house, and it came on them ]
melancholy, and when it came the old lord found slaves i
for them if they had not found any for themselves and the i
thing passed easily.'

'now and it nee

in argument. 'when i was a lad i had no such melan-
choly and no such weepings and tempers, and no slaves
either.'

o-lan waited and then she answered slowly, 'i have not
indeed seen it thus except with young lords. you worked
on the land. but he is like a young lord and he is idle in the
house.' * t ,

wang lung was surprised, after he had pondered a while,
for he saw truth in what she said. it was true that when
he himself was a lad there was no time for melancholy,
for he had to be up at dawn for the ox and out with the
plough and the hoe and at harvest he must needs work
until his back broke, and if he wept he

 his son
ran away from school, for if he did there was nothing for
him to eat on return, and so he was compelled to labour.
he remembered all this and he said to himself:

'but my son is not thus. he is more delicate than i was,
and his father is rich and mine was poor, and there is no
need for his labour, for i have labour in my fields, and
besides, one cannot take a scholar such as my son is and
set him to the plough.'

and he was secretly proud that he had a son like this
. and so he said to o-lan:

' well, and if he is like a young lord it is another matter.
but i cannot buy a slave for him. i will betroth him and
we will marry him early, and there is that to be done.'

then he rose and went into the inner court.

now lotus, seeing wang lung distraught in
her presence and thinking of things other than her beauty,
pouted and said:

'if i had known that in a short year you could look
at me and not see me, i would have stayed in the tea-house.'
and she turned her head away as she

of this and that, had not the lad, his eldest son, come
home one day in the dawn with his face hot and red with
wine drinking, and his breath was fetid and his feet un-
steady. wang lung heard him stumbling in the court and
he ran out to see who it was, and the lad was sick and
vomited before him, for he was unaccustomed to more
than the pale mild wine they made from their own rice
fermented, and he fell and lay on the ground in his vomit
like a dog.

wang lung was frightened and he called for o-lan, and
together they lifted the lad up and o-lan washed him and
laid him upon the bed in her own room, and before she
was finished with him the lad was asleep and heavy as one
dead and could answer nothing to what his father asked.

then wang lung went into the room where the two
boys slept together, and the younger was yawning and
stretching and tying his books into a square cloth to carry
to school, and wang lung said to him :

"was your elder brother not in the bed with you last
night?.'

and

range the matter. let the dowry be good but not too
great if the girl is suitable and if it can be arranged.'

when he had said this to cuckoo he went back to the
room and he sat beside his sleeping son and he brooded,
for he saw how fair and young the boy lay there, and he
saw the quiet face, asleep and smooth with its youth. then
when he thought of the weary painted woman and her thick
lips, his heart swelled with sickness and anger and he sat
there muttering to himself.

and as he sat o-lan came in and stood looking at the
boy, and she saw the clear sweat standing on his skin and
she brought vinegar in warm water and washed the sweat
away gently, as they used to wash the young lords in the
great house when they drank too heavily. then seeing the i
delicate childish face and the drunken sleep that even the fj
washing would not awaken, wang lung rose and went in p
his anger to his uncle's room, and he forgot the brother of
his father and he remembered only that this man was father/

me back
from the grain merchant with news that although the affair
of the betrothal had gone well, the merchant liu was not
willing that anything should take place now except the
exchange of the betrothal papers, for the maid was too
young for marriage, being but fourteen years old, and must
w t ait for another three years. wang lung was dismayed
at three more years of this lad's anger and idleness and
mooning eyes, for he would not go to school now two days
out of ten, and wang lung shouted at o-lan that night
when he ate :

'well, and let us betroth these other children as soon
as we are able, and the sooner the better, and let us marry
them as soon as they begin to yearn, for i cannot have this
over again three more times!'

and the next morning, having slept but little through
the night, he tore off his long robes and kicked off his
shoes and, as was his wont when the affairs of his house
became too deep for him, he took a hoe and he went out
to his fields and he went through the outer

but still the locusts spread up into the air and on over
the land.

then wang lung called his own labourers and ching
stood silent and ready beside him, and there were others
of the younger farmers, and with their own hands these
set fire to certain fields and they burned the good wheat
that stood almost ripe for cutting and they dug wide moats
and ran water into them from the wells, and they worked
without sleeping. o-lan brought them food and the women
brought their men food, and the men ate standing and in
the field, gulping it down as beasts do, as they worked night
and day.

then the sky grew black and the air was filled with
the deep still roar of many wings beating against each
other, and upon the land the locusts fell, flying over this
field and leaving it whole, and falling upon that field, and
eating it as bare as winter. and men sighed and said 'so
heaven wills,' but wang lung was furious and he beat t

were left it was nothing.

nevertheless, for all his fighting wang lung had this
as his reward: the best of his fields were spared; and when
the cloud moved on and they could rest themselves, there
was still wheat that he could reap and his young rice beds
were spared and he was content. then many of the people
ate the roasted bodies of the locusts, but wang lung him-
self would not eat them, for to him they were a filthy thing
because of what they had done to his land. but he said
nothing when o-lan fried them in oil and when the labourers
crunched them between their teeth and the children pulled
them apart delicately and tasted them, afraid of their great
eyes. but as for himself he would not eat.

nevertheless, the locusts did this for him. for seven
days he thought of nothing but his land, and he was healed
j of his troubles and his fears, and he said to himself calmly :

'well, and every man has his troubles and i must make
shift to live with mine as i can, and my uncle is older than

 a plump little
cat. and she slept and ate and took on her body this soft,
smooth flesh. if she was no longer the lotus bud, neither
was she more than the full-blown, flower and if she was
not young, neither did she look old, and youth and age
were equally far from her.

with his life placid again and the lad content., wang
lung might have been satisfied except that one night when
he sat late and alone, reckoning on his fingers what he
could sell of his corn and what he could sell of his rice^j
o-lan came softly into the room. this one, with the passing
of the years had grown lean and gaunt and the rock-like
pones of her face stood forth and her eyes were sunken, j
if one asked her how she did she said no more than this: i

'there is a fire in my vitals.'

her belly was as great as though with child these three
years, only there was no birth. but she rose at dawn and /



she did her work and wang lung saw only as he saw



the table or his chair or* a tree in the court, never even so

or a pig that would not eat. and she did her work alone
and spoke no more than she could escape speaking with
the wife of wang lung's uncle, and she never spoke at all
to cuckoo. never once had o-lan gone into the inner
courts, and rarely, if lotus came out to walk a little in a
place other than her own court, o-lan went into her room
and sat until one said, 4 she is gone.' and she said nothing
but she worked at her cooking and at the washing at the
pool even in the winter when the water was stiff with ice
to be broken. but wang lung never thought to say:

'well, and why do you not with the silver i have to
spare, hire a servant or buy a slave?'

it did not occur to him that there was any need of this,
although he hired labourers for his fields and to help with
the oxen and asses and with the pigs he had,

e pushed him away saying:

'it is hot and you stink and i wish you would wash
yourself before you come to lie beside me.'

she sat up, then, and pushed her hair fretfully back
from her face and she shrugged her shoulders when he
would have drawn her to him, and she would not yield to
his coaxing. then he lay still and he remembered that she
had yielded unwillingly these many nights, and he had
thought it her whim and the heavy hot air of departing
summer that depressed her, but now the words of o-lan
stood out sharply and he rose up roughly and said :

'well, and sleep alone then, and cut my throat if i care!'

he flung himself out of the room and strode into the
middle room of his own house and he put two chairs to-
gether and stretched himself on them. but he could not
sleep and he rose and v/ent out of his gate and he walked
among the bamboos beside the house wall, and there he
felt the cool night wind upon his hot flesh, and there was
the coolness of coming autumn in it.

then he rememb

beauty was more than he could wish and he loved her
when he would not. and it seemed to him suddenly that
he could not bear to know what had passed between these
two and he wished never to know and it was better for
him if he did not. so he groaned again and he went out.
he passed his son's room and he called without entering :

'well, and how put your things in the box and to-morrqw
go south to what you will and do not come home until
i send for you.'

then he went on and there was o-lan sitting sewing
on some garment of his, and when he passed she said
nothing, and if she had heard the beating and the scream-
ing, she made no sign of it. and he went on and out to
his fields and into the high sun of noon, and he was spent
as with the labour of a whole day.

when the eldest son was gone wang lung felt
the house was purged of some surcharge of unrest and
it was a relief to him. he said to himself that it was a good
thing for the young man to be gone, and now he co

shy and half-murmuring:

'because my mother binds a cloth about my feet more
tightly every day and i cannot sleep at night.'

'now i have not heard you weep,' he said, wondering.

i'no,' she said simply, 'and my mother said i was not
to weep aloud because you are too kind and weak for
pain and you might say to leave me as i am, and then my
husband would not love me even as you do not love her.'

this she said as simply as a child recites a tale x _and
wang lung was stabbed at hearing this, that o-lan had
told the child he did not love her who was the child's
' mother, and he said quickly:

j 'well, and to-day i have heard of a pretty husband for
1 you, and we will see if cuckoo can arrange the matter.'
r then the child smiled and dropped her head, suddenly
a maid and no more a child. and wang lung said to
cuckoo on that same evening when he was in the inner
court :

p" 'go and see if it can be done.'

but he slept uneasily beside lotus that night and he
j woke and fell to thinking of his li

fe of how o-lan had
been the first woman he had known and how she had
been a faithful servant beside him. and he thought of
what the child said, and he was sad, because with all her
dimness o-lan had seen the truth in him.

in the near days after this he sent his second son away
into the town and he signed the papers for the second
girl's betrothal and the dowry was decided upon and the
gifts of clothing and jewellery for her marriage day were
fixed. then wang lung rested and he said to his heart:

'well, and now all my children are provided -for, and
my poor fool can do nothing but sit in the sun with her
bit of cloth and the youngest boy i will keep for the land
and he shall not go to

he was proud because he had three sons and one was
a scholar and one a merchant and one a farmer. he was
content, then, and he gave over thinking any more about
his children. but whether he would or not there came
into his mind the thought of the woman who had borne
them to him.

for the fir^t time in his years with her wang lung
began to think about o-lan. even in the days of her new-
coming he had not thought of her for herself and not j
further than because she was a woman and the first he,
had known. and it seemed to him that with this thing!
and that he had been busy and without time to spare, and ;
only now, when his children were settled and his fields '
cared for arid quiet under the coming of winter, and now,
when his life with lotus was regulated and she was sub-
missive to him since he had beat her, now it seemed to
him he had time to 
 
 ___________________________
 
think of what he would and he thought
of o-lan.

he looked at her, not because she was woman this
time, and not that she was ugly and gaunt and yellow-
skinned. but he looked at her with some strange remorse,
and he saw that she had grown thin and her skin was
sere and yellow. she had always been a dark woman, her
skin tuddy and brown when she worked in the fields.
yet now for many years she had not gone into the fields,
except perhaps at harvest time, and not then for two years
and more, for he disliked her to go, lest men say:

'and does

d about, and when she stooped to sweep the
brick floor one day after they had eaten, he saw her face
\ turn grey with some inner pain, and she opened her lips
and panted softly, and she put her hand to her belly,
although still stooping as though to sweep. he asked her
sharply :

'what is it?'

but she averted her face and answered meekly :

'it is only the old pain in my vitals.'

then he stared at her and he said to the younger girl :

'take the broom and sweep, for your mother is ill/
and to o-lan he said more kindly than he had spoken to
her in many years. 'go in and lie on your bed, and i will
bid the girl bring you hot water. do not get up.'

she obeyed him. slowly and without answer, and she -
went in to her room and he heard her dragging about it,
and at last she lay down and moaned softly. then he sat
listening to this moaning until he could not bear it, and
he rose and went in to the town to ask where a doctor's
shop was.

he found a shop recommended to him by a clerk in
the grain
 
 ___________________________
 
e his second son now was, and he
went to it. there the doctor sat idle over a pot of tea. he
was an old man with a long grey beard and brass spectacles
large as an owl's eyes his nose, and he wore a dirty grey
robe whose long sleeves covered his hands altogether.
when wang lung told him what his .wife's symptoms
were, he pursed his lips and opened a drawer of the table
at which he sat, and he took out a bundle, wrapped in a
black cloth and he said:

m will come now.'



206



when they came to o-lan's bed she had fallen into a
light sleep and the sweat stood like dew on her upper
lip and on her forehead, and the old doctor shook his
head to see it. he put forth a hand as dried and yellowed
as an ape's hand and he felt for her pulse, and then after
he had held it for a long time, he shook his head again
gravely, saying:

'the spleen is enlarged and the liver diseased. there
is a rock as large as a man's head in the womb; the stomach
is disintegrated. the heart barely moves and doubtless
the

re are worms in it.'

at these words wang lung's own heart stopped and
he was afraid and he shouted out angrily:

'well, and give her medicine, can you not?'

o-lan opened her eyes as he spoke and looked at them,
not understanding and drowsy with pain. then the old
doctor spoke again:

c it is a difficult case. if yoti do not wish guarantee of
recovery, i will ask for fee ten pieces of silver and i will
give you a prescription of herbs and a tiger's heart dried
in it and the tooth of a dog, and these boil together and
let her drink the broth. but if you wish complete recovery
guarantee, then five hundred pieces of silver.'
"tsfow when o-lan heard the words
 
 ___________________________
 
n. five thousand of silver must i
have if i guarantee full recovery.'

then wang lung looked at the doctor in silence and



207



in sad understanding. he had not so many pieces of silver
in the world unless he sold his land, but he knew that
even though he sold his land it was no avail, for it was
simply that the doctor said, "the woman will die."

he went out with the doctor, therefore, and he paid
him the ten pieces of silver, and when he was gone wang
lung went into the dark kitchen where o-lan had lived
her life for the most part, and where, now that she was not
there, none would see him, and he turned his face to the
blackened wall, and he wept.

biut there was no sudden dying of life in
o-lan's body. she was scarcely past the middle of her span
of years, and her life would not easily pass from her body,
so that she lay dying on her bed for many months. all
through the long months of winter she lay dying and upon
her bed, and for the first time wang lung and his children

food lay under the table and none swept it unless wang
lung grew impatient with the smell of it and called in m
dog from the court to lick it up or shouted at the younger
girl to scrape it up and throw it out.

and the youngest lad did this and that to fill his mother's
place with the old man his grandfather, who was helpless
as a little child now, and wang lung could not make the
old man understand what had happened that o-lan no
longer came to- bring him tea and hot water and to help
him lie down and stand up, and he was peevish because
he called her and she did not come, and he threw his bowl
of tea on the ground like a wilful child. at last wang lung

led him in to o-lan's room and showed him the bed where
she lay, and the old man stared out of his filmed and half-
blind eyes, and he mumbled and wept because he saw
dimly that something was wrong.

rying in the early dawn,
and wang lung was angry and cursed his son and daughter
that they had forgotten the poor fool who was their sister.
then he saw that they were but children trying to take
their mother's place and not able to do it, and he forebore.
and after that he saw to the poor fool himself night and
morning; if it rained or snowed or a bitter wind blew,
he led her in and he let her sit among the warm ashes that
dropped from the kitchen stove.

all during the dark winter months when o-lan lay
dying wang lung paid no heed to the land. he turned
over the winter's work and the men to the government of
ching, and ching laboured faithfully, and night and morn-
ing he came to the door of the room where o-lan lay and
he asked twice each day thus in his piping whisper how
she did. at last wang lung could not bear it because every
d^y and every night he could only say :

' 'to-day she drank a little soup from a fowl,' or 'to-day
she ate a little thin gruel of rice.'

so he commanded chin

g to ask no more but to do
the work well and it would be enough.

all during the cold dark winter wang lung sat often
beside o-lan's bed, and if she* were cold he lit an earthen 1
pot of charcoal and set it beside her bed for warmth, and
she murmured each time faintly:

'well, and it is too expensive.'
. at last one day when she said this he could not bear
it and he burst forth:



5056, 14.



209



'this i cannot bear! i would sell all my land if it could'
heal you/

she smiled at this and said in gasps, whispering:

'no, and i would not — let you. for i must die — some-
i time anyway. but the land is there after me

'no, and my sons can do it for me,' answered wang.
lung, and then he thought of his own father and he had
not yet a coffin for the old man and he was struck with
the thought and he said again, 'but there is my old father
and he will die one day soon, weak as he is on his two
legs and deaf and half blind, and so i will take the :
two.'

and the man promised to paint the coffins again a good ,
' black and send them to wang lung's house. so wang
lung told o-lan what he had done, and she was pleased
i that he had done it for her, and had provided well for
| her death.

thus he sat by her many hours of the day, and they
did not talk much, for she was faint, and besides there had
never been talk between them. often she forgot where she
was as he sat there in stillness and silence, and sometimes
she murmured of her childhood, and for the first time
wang lung saw into her heart, although even now only |
through such brief words as these:

'i will bring the

he heart such,
as lotus could win from him with a pout of her lips, i
when he took this* stiff dying hand he did not love it, andl
even his pity was spoiled with repulsion towards it.

and because of this, he was more kind to her and he
bought her special food and delicate soups made of white
fish and the hearts of young cabbages. moreover, he could
not take his pleasure of lotus, for when he went in to her
to distract his mind from its despair over this long agony
of dying, he could not forget o-lan, and even as he held
lotus, he loosed her, because of o-lan.

there were times when o-lan woke to herself and to
what was about her and once she called for cuckoo, and
when in great astonishment wang lung summoned the
woman, o-lan raised herself trembling upon her arm, and
she said plainly enough:

'well, and you may have lived in the courts of the
old lord, and you were accounted beautiful, but i have
been a man's wife and i have borne him sons, and you
are still a slave.'

when cuckoo would h

ave answered angrily to this,
wang lung besought her and led her out, saying:

'that one does not know what words mean now/

when he went back into the room, o-lan still leaned
her head upon her arm and she said to him :

' after i am dead that one nor her mistress neither is
to come into my room or touch my things, and if they do,
i will send my spirit back for a curse.' then she fell into .
hef fitful sleep, and her head dropped upon the pillow.

but one day before the new year broke, she was sud-
denly better, as a candle flickers brightly at its end, and



she was herself as she had not been and she sat up in bed
and twisted her hair for herself, and

and no meats ready, and i have thought of a thing. i will
not have that slave in my kitchen, but i would have you
send for my daughter-in-law, who is betrothed to our eldest
son. i have not seen her yet, but when she comes i will
tell her what to do/

wang lung was pleased' at her strength, although he
cared nothing for festivities on this year, and he sent cuckoo
in to beseech liu, the grain merchant, seeing how sad the
case was. and after a while liu was willing when he heard
that o-lan would not live the winter out, perhaps, and after
all the girl was sixteen and older than some who go to
their husband's houses.

but because of o-lan there were no feastings. the maiden
came quietly in a sedan chair, except that her mother and
an old servant came with her, and her mother went back
when she had delivered the maiden to o-lan, but the
servant remained for the maiden's use.

now the children were moved from the room where they
had slept and that room was given to the new daughter-
 
 ___________________________
 

in-law, and all was arranged as it should be. wang lung
did not speak with the maiden, since it was not fitting, but
he inclined his head gravely when she bowed and he was
pleased with her, for she knew her duty and she moved
about the house quietly with her eyes downcast. moreover,
she was a goodly maid, fair enough, but not too fair so as
to be vain over it. she was careful and correct in all her
behaviour, and she went into o-lan's room and tended her,
and this eased wang lung of his pain for his wife, because
now there was a woman about her bed, and o-lan was very
content.

o-lan was content for three days and more and then
she thought of another thing and she said to wang lung
when he came in the morning to see how she did through
the night:

'there is another thing before i can die.'
to this he replied angrily:



'you cannot speak of dying and please mep

she smiled slowly then, the same slow smile that ended
before

re a long dark
red gown of satin such as one finds in the shops of the
south, and a short black velvet jacket without sleeves, and
wang lung's heart burst with pride to see his son, and he
forgot everything except this, his goodly son, and he led
him to his mother.

then the young man sat beside his mother's bed and
the tears stood in his eyes to see her thus, but he would
not say anything except cheerful things such as these, 'you
look twice as well as they said and years away from death.'
but o-lan said simply:

£ i will see you wed and then i must die.'

now the maid who was to be wed must not of course
be seen by the young man and lotus took her into the
inner court to prepare her for marriage, and none could do
this better than lotus and cuckoo and the wife of wang
lung's uncle. these three took the maid and on the morn-
ing of her wedding-day they washed her clean from head
to foot, and bound her feet freshly with new white cloths
under her new stockings, and lotus rubbed into her fl

re to continue after him the life of his body. now
the old man, who had not understood what was happening
at all and could hear only the fragments of what was shouted
to him, now suddenly he understood, and he cackled out
with cracked laughter and he said over and over in his
piping old voice:

'there is a marriage and a marriage is children again
and grandchildren!'

and he laughed so heartily that the guests all laughed
to see his mirth and wang lung thought to himself that if



2t 5



only o-lan had been up from her bed it would have been
a merry day.

all this time wang lung looked secretly and sharply
at his son to see if he glanced at the maid, and the young
man did glance secretly and from the corner of his eyes,
but it was enough, for he grew pleased and merry in his
ways and wang said proudly to himself :

'well, and i have chosen one he likes for him.'

then the young man and the maid together bowed to
the old man and to wang lung, and then they went into
the room where o-lan la

y.'

now none would answer her when she spoke thus but
the two sat down side by side, shy of each other and in
silence, and the wife of wang lung's uncle came in, fat
and important with the occasion, bearing two bowls of hot
wine, and the two drank separately, and then mingled the
wine of the two bowls and drank again, thus signifying that
the two were now one, and they ate rice and mingled the
rice and this signified that their life was now one, and thus
they were wed. then they bowed again to o-lan and to
wang lung and then they went out and together they
bowed to the assembled guests.

then the feasting began and the rooms and the courts
were filled with tables and with the smell of cooking and
with the sound of laughter, for the guests came from far
and wide, those whom wang lung had invited and with
them many whom wang lung had never seen, since it was
known he was a rich man and food would never be missed
or counted in his house at such a time. and cuckoo had
brought cooks from the to
 
 ___________________________
 
wn to prepare the feast, for there

216



were to be many delicacies such as cannot be prepared in
a farmer's kitchen and the town cooks came bearing great
baskets of food ready cooked and only to be heated, and
they made much of themselves and flourished their grimy
aprons and bustled here and there in their zeal. and every
one ate more and yet more and drank all he was able to
hold, and they were all very merry.

o-lan would have all the doors open and the curtains
drawn so that she could hear the noise and the laughter
and could smell the food, and she said again and again to
wang lung, who came in often to see how she did:

'and has every one wine? and is the sweet rice dish
in the middle of the feast very hot and have they put full
measure of lard and sugar into it and the eight fruits?'

when he assured her that everything was as she wished
it, she was content and lay listening.

then it w t as over and t
 
 ___________________________
 
he guests were gone and night
came. and with the silence over the house and with the
ebbing of merriment strength passed from o-lan and she
grew weary and faint and she called to her the two who
had been wed that day and she said:

'now i am content and this thing in me may do as it ]
will. my son, look to your father and your grandfather,
and my daughter, look to your husband and your husband's i
father and his grandfather and the poor fool in the court,
there is she. and you have no duty to any other.'

this last she said, meaning lotus, to whom she had
never spoken. then she seemed to fall into a fitful sleep, i
although
 
 ___________________________
 
he hated himself because even as she lay dying he saw how
wide and ghastly her purpled lips drew back from her teeth.
then as he looked she opened her eyes wide and it seemed
there was some strange mist over them, for she stared at
him full and stared again, wondering and fixing her eyes
on him, as though she wondered who he was. suddenly
her head dropped off the round pillow where it^ay, and
she shuddered and was dead.

once she lay dead it seemed to wang lung that he
could not bear to be near o-lan, and he called his uncle's
wife to wash the body for burial, and when it was finished
he would not go in again, but he allowed his uncle's wife
and his eldest son and his daughter-in-law to lift the body
from the bed and set in into the great coffin he had bought.
but to comfort himself he busied himself in going to the i
town and calling men to seal the coffin according to custom
and he went and found a geomancer and asked him for a
lucky day for burials. he found a good day three months
hence
 
 ___________________________
 
 and.it was the first good day the geomancer could
find, so wang lung paid the man and went to the temple
in the town and he bargained with the abbot there and
rented a space for a coffin for three months, and there was
o-lan's coffin brought to rest until the day of burial, for it
seemed to wang lung he could not bear to have it under
his eyes in the house.

then wang lung was scrupulous to do all that should
be done for the one dead, so he caused mourning to be
made for himself and for his children, and their shoes were
made of coarse white cloth, which is the colour of mourning,
and about their ankles they bound bands of white cloth,
and the women in the house bound their hair with white
cord.

after this wang lu
 
 ___________________________
 
ng could not bear to sleep in the
room where o-lan had died and he took his possessions
and moved altogether into the inner court where lotus
lived and he said to his eldest son :

'go with your wife into that room where your mother
lived and died, who conceived and bore you, and beget
there your own sons.'

218



so the two moved into it and were content.

then as though death could not easily leave the house
where it had come once, the old man, wang lung's father,
who had been distraught ever since he saw them putting
the stiff dead body of

o-lan into the coffin, lay down on
his bed one night for sleeping, and when the second daugh-
ter came in to him in the morning to bring him his tea,
there he lay on his bed, his scattered old beard thrust up
into the air, and his head thrown back in death.

she cried out at the sight and ran crying to her father,
and wang lung came in and found the old man so; his
light, stiff old body was dry and cold and thin as a gnarled
pine tree and he had died hours before, perhaps as soon
as he had laid himse

ppointed day after the priests had finished
the night of chanting, wang lung dressed himself in a
robe of white sack-cloth and he gave a robe like it to his
uncle and his uncle's son, and to his own sons each a robe,
and to his son's wife and to his own two daughters. he
called chairs from the town to carry them, for it was not
meet that they walk to the place of burial as though he
were a poor man and a common fellow. so for the first
time he rode on men's shoulders and behind the coffin
where o-lan was. but behind his father's coffin his uncle
i rode first. even lotus, who in o-lan's lifetime could not
appear before her, now that o-lan was dead, came riding
jin a chair in order that before others she might appear
\ dutiful to the first wife of her husband. so for his uncle's
wife and for his uncle's son, wang lung hired chairs also
and for all of them he had robes of sackcloth, and even
for the poor fool he made a robe and hired a chair and
put her in it, although she was sorely bewildere

ed shrilly when there should have been only weeping.

then, mourning and weeping loudly, they went to the
graves, the labourers and ching following and walking and
wearing white shoes. and wang lung stood beside the
two graves. he had caused the coffin of o-lan to be brought
from the temple and it was put on the ground to await
the old man's burial first. and wang lung stood and
watched and his grief was hard and dry, and he would not
cry out loud as others did, for there were no tears in his
eyes, because it seemed to him that what had come about



i was come about, and there was nothing to be done more

i and it was a pain to him, and it was this : that he wished
i he had not taken the two pearls from o-lan that day when
i she was washing his clothes at the pool, and he would
never bear to see lotus put them in her ears again.

thus, thinking heavily, he went on alone and he said
to himself:

pthere n that land of mine is buried the first good half
i of my life and more. it is as though half of me were buried
there, and now it is a. different life in my house/ t

and suddenly he wept a little, and he dried his eyes
with the back of his hand, as a child does.

nt and musing and
he remembered within himself that day and how she had
gone alone into the small dark room and how alone she
had borne him sons and again sons and daughters and she
bore them silently, and how had come to the fields and
worked beside him again. and here was this one, now the
wife of his son, who cried like a child with her pains,
and who had all the slaves running in the house, and her
husband there by her door.

and he remembered as one remembers a dream long \
past how o-lan rested from her work a little while and
fed the~cfiild richly and the white rich milk ran out of her
breast and spilled upon the ground. and this seemed too
long past ever to have been. \

then his son came in smiling and important and he
said loudly:

'thej nan child is born, my father, and now we must
find a woman to nurse him with her breasts, for i will not
have my wife's beauty spoiled with the nursing and her
strength sapped with it. none of the women of position in j
the town do so.'

he ordered a coffin of the best kind, and he hired priests
for the funeral and he walked behind wearing white mourn-
ing. he made his eldest son, even, wear white bands on
his ankles as though a relative had died, although his son
complained and said:

c he was only an upper servant, and it is not suitable so
to mourn for a servant.'

but wang lung compelled him for three days. and
if wang lung had had his way wholly, he would have
buried ching inside the earthen wall where his father and
o-lan were buried. but his sons would not have it and they
complained and said:

'shall our mother and grandfather lie with a servant?
and must we also in our time?'

then wang lung, because he could not contend with
them and because at his age he would have peace in his
house, buried ching at the entrance to the wall and he was
comforted with what he had done, and he said:

'well, and it is meet, for has ever stood guardian to me
against evil.' and he directed his sons that when he himself

hold the silver as dowry for me, my master,' she said,
'and if it is not a trouble to you, wed me to a farmer or
to a good poor man. it will be merit to you, and having
lived with a man, it is hardship to me to go back to my
bed alone.'

then wang lung promised easily, and when he pro-
mised he was struck with a thought and it was this. here
was he promising a woman to a poor man, and once he
had been a poor man come into these courts for his woman.
and he had not for half a lifetime thought of o-lan, and
now he thought of her with sadness that was not sorrow
but only heaviness of memory and things long gone, so
far distant was he from her now. and he said heavily:

'when the old opium dreamer dies, i will find a man
for you, then, and it cannot be long.'

and wang lung did as he said. the woman came to
him one morning and said:

'now redeem your promise, my master, for the old
one died in the early morning without waking at all, and
i have put her in her coffin.'

, and he had set up his
house in a town, and he was rich. but his roots were in
his land and although he forgot if for many months to-
gether, when spring came each year he must go out on to
the land; and now although he could no longer hold a
plough or do anything but see another drive the plough
through the earth, still he must needs go, and he went.
sometimes he took a servant and his bed and he slept
again in the olcj earthen house and in the old bed where
he had begotten children and where o-lan had died. when
he woke in the dawn he went out and with his trembling
hands he reached and plucked a bit of budding willow and
a spray of peach bloom and held them all day in his hand.

thus he wandered one day in a late spring, near summer,
and he went over his fields a little way and he came to the
enclosed place upon a low hill where he had buried his

289



dead. he stood trembling on his staff and he looked at the
graves and he remembered them every one. they were
more clear to him now th

ly, even his little second daughter
of whom he had heard nothing for longer than he could
remember, and he saw her a pretty maid as she had been in
his house, her lips as thin and red as a shred of silk — and
she was to him like these who lay here in the land. then
he mused and he thought suddenly:
'well, and i shall be the next.'

then he went into the enclosure and he looked carefully
and he saw the place where he would lie — below his father
and his uncle and above ching and not far from o-lan.
and he stared at the bit of earth' where he was to lie and
he saw himself in it and back in his own land for ever.
and he muttered :

c i must see to the coffin.'

this thought he held fast and painfully in his mind, and
he went back to the town and he sent for his eldest son,
and he said:

'there is something i have to say.'

'then say on,' answered the son, 'i am here.'

but when wang lung would have spoken he suddenly
could not remember what it was that he wished to say, and
the tears stood
