proctor was a farmer in his middle thirties, he need not have been a partisan of any 
faction in the town, but there is evidence to suggest that he had a sharp and biting way 
with hypocrites. he was the kind of man - powerful of body, even-tempered, and not 
easily  led  -  who  cannot  refuse  support  to  partisans  with-out  drawing  their  deepest 
resentment. in proctorÂ’â€™s presence a fool felt his foolishness insta

surface, and as he enters from the crowded parlor below it is a man in his prime we see, 
with a quiet confidence and an unexpressed, hidden force. mary war-ren, his servant, 
can barely speak for embarrassment and fear. 
 
mary warren: oh! iÂ’â€™m just going home, mr. proctor. 
 
proctor:  be  you  foolish,  mary  warren?  be  you  deaf?  i  for-bid  you  leave  the 
house, did i not? why shall i pay you? i am looking for you more often than my 
cows! 
 
mary warren: i only come to see the great doings in the world. 
 
proctor: iÂ’â€™ll show you a great doin' on your arse one of these days. now get you

has mr. proctor threatened you for this deposition? 
 
mary warren: no, sir.

mary warren, weaker: no, sir.

mary warren: no, sir.

mary warren, faintly: aye, sir. 
 
danforth, turning to abigail: a poppet were discovered in mr. proctorÂ’â€™s house, stabbed 
by a needle. mary warren claims that you sat beside her in the court when she made it, 
and that you saw her make it and witnessed how she herself stuck her needle into it for 
safe-keeping. what say you to that? 
 
abigail, with a slight note of indignation: it is a lie, sir. 
 
danforth, after a slight pause: while you worked for mr. proctor, did you see poppets 
in that house?

cheever: when i spoke with goody proctor in that house, she said she never kept no
