umping  a  28-pound  mine  detector.  with  its
headphones  and  big  sensing  plate,  the  equipment  was  a  stress  on  the
lower  back  and  shoulders,  awkward  to  handle,  often  useless  because  of
the  shrapnel  in  the  earth,  but  they  carried  it  anyway,  partly  for  safety,
partly for the illusion of safety.

on ambush, or other night missions, they carried peculiar little odds
and  ends.  kiowa  always  took  along  his  new  testament  and  a  pair  of
moccasins for silence. dave jensen carried night-sight vitamins high in
carotene.  lee  strunk  carried  his  slingshot;  ammo,  he  claimed,  would
never be a problem. rat kiley carried brandy and m&m's candy. until he
was  shot,  ted  lavender  carried  the  starlight  scope,  which  weighed  6.3



pounds  with  its  aluminum  carrying  case.  henry  dobbins  carried  his
girlfriend's pantyhose wrapped around his neck as a comforter. they all
carried ghosts. when dark came, they would move out single file across
the  meadows

other  missions  were  more  complicated  and  required  special
equipment. in mid-april, it was their mission to search out and destroy
the elaborate tunnel complexes in the than khe area south of chu lai.
to  blow  the  tunnels,  they  carried  one-pound  blocks  of  pentrite  high
explosives, four blocks to a man, 68 pounds in all. they carried wiring,
detonators, and battery-powered clackers. dave jensen carried earplugs.
most  often,  before  blowing  the  tunnels,  they  were  ordered  by  higher
command  to  search  them,  which  was  considered  bad  news,  but  by  and
large  they  just  shrugged  and  carried  out  orders.  because  he  was  a  big
man,  henry  dobbins  was  excused  from  tunnel  duty.  the  others  would
draw numbers. before lavender died there were 17 men in the platoon,
and  whoever  drew  the  number  17  would  strip  off  his  gear  and  crawl  in
headfirst with a

the cheekbone was gone. oh shit, rat kiley said, the guy's dead. the
guy's  dead,  he  kept  saying,  which  seemed  profound—the  guy's  dead.  i

the  things  they  carried  were  determined  to  some  extent  by
superstition. lieutenant cross carried his good-luck pebble. dave jensen
carried a rabbit's foot. norman bowker, otherwise a very gentle person,
carried  a  thumb  that  had  been  presented  to  him  as  a  gift  by  mitchell
sanders. the thumb was dark brown, rubbery to the touch, and weighed
4 ounces at most. it had been cut from a vc corpse, a boy of fifteen or
sixteen.  they'd  found  him  at  the  bottom  of  an  irrigation  ditch,  badly
burned,  flies  in  his  mouth  and  eyes.  the  boy  wore  black  shorts  and
sandals. at the time of his death he had bee

through the pine forests and down to the prairie, and then to vietnam,
where  i  was  a  soldier,  and  then  home  again.  i  survived,  but  it's  not  a
happy ending. i was a coward. i went to the war.

enemies


one morning in late july, while we were out on patrol near lz gator,
lee strunk and dave jensen got into a fistfight. it was about something
stupid—a  missing  jackknife—but  even  so  the  fight  was  vicious.  for  a
while  it  went  back  and  forth,  but  dave  jensen  was  much  bigger  and
much stronger, and eventually he wrapped an arm around strunk's neck
and pinned him down and kept hitting him on the nose. he hit him hard.
and  he  didn't  stop.  strunk's  nose  made  a  sharp  snapping  sound,  like  a
firecracker, but even then jensen kept hitting him, over and over, quick

stiff punches that did not miss. it took three of us to pull him off. when it
was over, strunk had to be choppered back to the rear, where he had his
nose  looked  after,  and  two  days  later  he  rejoined  us  wearing  a  metal
splint and lots of gauze.

in  any  other  circumstance  it  might've  ended  there.  but  this  was
vietnam, where guys carried guns, and dave jensen started to worry. it
was mostly in his head. there were no threats, no vows of revenge, just a
silent tension between them that made jensen take special precautions.
on patrol he was careful to keep track of strunk's whereabouts. he dug



his foxholes on the far side of the perimeter; he kept his back covered; he
avoided  situations  that  might  put  the  two  of  them  alone  together.
eventually,  after  a  week  of  this,  the  strain  began  to  create  problems.
jensen couldn't relax. l

asn't the bizarre part.
because  late  that  same  night  he  borrowed  a  pistol,  gripped  it  by  the

barrel, and used it like a hammer to break his own nose.

afterward,  he  crossed  the  perimeter  to  lee  strunk's  foxhole.  he
showed him what he'd done and asked if everything was square between
them.

strunk nodded and said, sure, things were square.
but  in  the  morning  lee  strunk  couldn't  stop  laughing.  "the  man's

crazy," he said. "i stole his fucking jackknife."

friends


dave jensen and lee strunk did not become instant buddies, but they
did learn to trust each other. over the next month they often teamed up
on ambushes. they covered each other on patrol, shared a foxhole, took
turns pulling guard at night. in late august they made a pact that if one
of  them  should  ever  get  totally  rucked  up—a  wheelchair  wound—the
other guy would automatically find a way to end it. as far as i could tell

 and run, but there was nothing left to run on. he fell
hard.  the  stump  of  his  right  leg  was  twitching.  there  were  slivers  of
bone,  and  the  blood  came  in  quick  spurts  like  water  from  a  pump.  he
seemed  bewildered.  he  reached  down  as  if  to  massage  his  missing  leg,
then he passed out, and rat kiley put on a tourniquet and administered
morphine and ran plasma into him.

there was nothing much anybody could do except wait for the dustoff.
after we'd secured an lz, dave jensen went over and kneeled at strunk's
side. the stump had stopped twitching now. for a time there was some
question as to whether strunk was still alive, but then he opened his eyes
and  looked  up  at  dave  jensen.  "oh,  jesus,"  he  said,  and  moaned,  and
tried to slide away and said, "jesus, man, don't kill me."

"relax," jensen said.
lee strunk seemed groggy and confused. he lay still for a second and
then motioned toward his leg. "really, it's not so bad, not terrible. hey,
really—they c

it happened, to me, nearly twenty years ago, and i still remember that
trail junction and those giant trees and a soft dripping sound somewhere
beyond the trees. i remember the smell of moss. up in the canopy there
were  tiny  white  blossoms,  but  no  sunlight  at  all,  and  i  remember  the
shadows spreading out under the trees where curt lemon and rat kiley
were  playing  catch  with  smoke  grenades.  mitchell  sanders  sat  flipping
his yo-yo. norman bowker and kiowa and dave jensen were dozing, or
half dozing, and all around us were those ragged green mountains.

except for the laughter things were quiet.
at one point, i remember, mitchell sanders turned and looked at me,
not  quite  nodding,  as  if  to  warn  me  about  something,  as  if  he  already
knew, then after a while he rolled up his yo-yo and moved away.

it's hard to tell you what happened next.

somebody kicked the baby buffalo.
it was still alive, though just barely, just in the eyes.
"amazing,"  dave  jensen  said.  "my  whole  life,  i  never  seen  anything

like it."

"never?"
"not hardly. not once."
kiowa and mitchell sanders picked up the baby buffalo. they hauled it

across the open square, hoisted it up, and dumped it in the village well.

afterward, we sat waiting for rat to get himself together.
"amazing," dave jensen kept saying. "a new wrinkle. i never seen it

before."



mitchell  sanders  took  out  his  yo-yo.  "well,  that's  nam,"  he  said.

"garden of evil. over here, man, every sin's real fresh and original."


how do you generalize?
war  is  hell,  but  that's  not  the  half  of  it,  because  war  is  also  mystery
and  terror  and  adventure  and  courage  and  discovery  and  holiness  and
pity and despair and longing and love. war is nasty; war is fun. war is
thrilling; war is drudgery. war

plunged headfirst off a high tower. the men stood quietly for a few
seconds. there was a feeling of awe. mitchell sanders finally nodded and
said,  "let's  get  it  done,"  and  they  took  hold  of  the  legs  and  pulled  up
hard, then pulled again, and after a moment kiowa came sliding to the
surface. a piece of his shoulder was missing; the arms and chest and face
were  cut  up  with  shrapnel.  he  was  covered  with  bluish  green  mud.
"well," henry dobbins said, "it could be worse," and dave jensen said,
"how, man? tell me how." carefully, trying not to look at the body, they
carried kiowa over to the dike and laid him down. they used towels to
clean off the scum. rat kiley went through the kid's pockets, placed his
personal effects in a plastic bag, taped the bag to kiowa's wrist, then used
the radio to call in a dustoff.

moving  away,  the  men  found  things  to  do  with  themselves,  some
smoking, some opening up cans of c rations, a few just standing in the
rain.

ridiculous little mustache.



the  nights  were  miserable.  sometimes  i'd  roam  around  the  base.  i'd
head down to the wire and stare out at the darkness, out where the war
was, and think up ways to make bobby jorgenson feel exactly what i felt.
i wanted to hurt him.


in march, alpha company came in for stand-down. i was there at the
helipad  to  meet  the  choppers.  mitchell  sanders  and  azar  and  henry
dobbins and dave jensen and norman bowker slapped hands with me
and  we  piled  their  gear  in  my  jeep  and  drove  down  to  the  alpha
hootches. we partied until chow time. afterward, we kept on partying. it
was  one  of  the  rituals.  even  if  you  weren't  in  the  mood,  you  did  it  on
principle.

by midnight it was story time.
"morty phillips used up his luck," bowker said.
i  smiled  and  waited.  there  was  a  tempo  to  how  stories  got  told.

bowker peeled open a finger blister and sucked on it.

"

go, he shows."

"soaking wet," said azar.
"hey, listen—"
"okay, but tell it."
norman  bowker  frowned.  "soaking  wet,"  he  said.  "turns  out  the
moron  went  for  a  swim.  you  believe  that?  all  alone,  he  just  takes  off,
hikes a couple klicks, finds himself a river and strips down and hops in
and  starts  doing  the  goddamn  breast  stroke  or  some  such  fine  shit.  no
security, no nothing. i mean, the dude goes skinny dipping."

azar giggled. "a hot day."
"not that hot," said dave jensen.
"hot, though."
"get  the  picture?"  bowker  said.  "this  is  my  khe  we're  talking  about,

dinks everywhere, and the guy goes for a swim."

"crazy," i said.
i  looked  across  the  hootch.  twenty  or  thirty  guys  were  there,  some
drinking,  some  passed  out,  but  i  couldn't  find  morty  phillips  among
them.

bowker  smiled.  he  reached  out  and  put  his  hand  on  my  knee  and

squeezed.

"that's the kicker, man. no more morty."
"no?"
"morty's luck gets all used up," bowker

o. you got it wrong."
"maybe polio."
"no way," said dobbins. "not polio."
"well, hey," bowker said, "i'm just saying what jorgenson says. maybe
fuckin'  polio.  or  that  weird  elephant  disease.  elephantiasshole  or
whatever."

"yeah, but not polio."
across the hootch, sitting off by himself, azar grinned and snapped his
fingers.  "either  way,"  he  said,  "it  goes  to  show  you.  don't  throw  away
luck on little stuff. save it up."

"there it is," said mitchell sanders.
"morty was due," dave jensen said.
"overdue," sanders said.
norman bowker nodded solemnly. "you don't mess around like that.

you just don't fritter away all your luck."

"amen," said sanders.
"fuckin' polio," said henry dobbins.
we sat quietly for a time. there was no need to talk, because we were
thinking the same things: about morty phillips and the way luck worked
and didn't work and how it was impossible to calculate the odds. there
were  a  million  ways  to  die.  getting  shot  was  one  way.  booby  traps  and

't disturb the body, they just

grabbed the old man's hand and offered a few words and moved away.

rat kiley bent over the corpse. "gimme five," he said. "a real honor."
"pleased as punch," said henry dobbins.
i  was  brand-new  to  the  war.  it  was  my  fourth  day;  i  hadn't  yet
developed a sense of humor. right away, as if i'd swallowed something, i



felt a moist sickness rise up in my throat. i sat down beside the pigpen,
closed my eyes, put my head between my knees.

after a moment dave jensen touched my shoulder.
"be polite now," he said. "go introduce yourself. nothing to be afraid

about, just a nice old man. show a little respect for your elders."

"no way."
"maybe it's too real for you?"
"that's right," i said. "way too real."
jensen kept after me, but i didn't go near the body. i didn't even look
at  it  except  by  accident.  for  the  rest  of  the  day  there  was  still  that
sickness  inside  me,  but  it  wasn't  the  old  man's  corpse  so  much,  it  was

 they  crossed  his  legs  and  talked  to  him.
"the  guest  of  honor,"  mitchell  sanders  said,  and  he  placed  a  can  of
orange slices in the old man's lap. "vitamin c," he said gently. "a guy's
health, that's the most important thing."

they proposed toasts. they lifted their canteens and drank to the old
man's  family  and  ancestors,  his  many  grandchildren,  his  newfound  life
after death. it was more than mockery. there was a formality to it, like a
funeral without the sadness.

dave jensen flicked his eyes at me.
"hey,  o'brien,"  he  said,  "you  got  a  toast  in  mind?  never  too  late  for

manners."

i  found  things  to  do  with  my  hands.  i  looked  away  and  tried  not  to

think.

late in the afternoon, just before dusk, kiowa came up and asked if he
could sit at my foxhole for a minute. he offered me a christmas cookie
from  a  batch  his  father  had  sent  him.  it  was  february  now,  but  the
cookies tasted fine.

for a few moments kiowa watched the sky.
"you
