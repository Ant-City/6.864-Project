polly, or the widow, or maybe mary.  aunt polly--tom’s aunt polly, she
is--and mary, and the widow douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as i said before.

now the way that the book winds up is this:  tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  we got six
thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  it was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up.  well, judge thatcher he took it and put it out
at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year
round--more than a body could tell what to do with.  the widow douglas
she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was
rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular
and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when i couldn’t stand
it no longer i lit out.  i got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead
again, and was free and satisfied.  but tom sawyer

why, there ain’t no end to your airs--they say you’re rich.  hey?--how’s
that?”

“they lie--that’s how.”

“looky here--mind how you talk to me; i’m a-standing about all i can
stand now--so don’t gimme no sass.  i’ve been in town two days, and i
hain’t heard nothing but about you bein’ rich.  i heard about it
away down the river, too.  that’s why i come.  you git me that money
to-morrow--i want it.”

“i hain’t got no money.”

“it’s a lie.  judge thatcher’s got it.  you git it.  i want it.”

“i hain’t got no money, i tell you.  you ask judge thatcher; he’ll tell
you the same.”

“all right.  i’ll ask him; and i’ll make him pungle, too, or i’ll know
the reason why.  say, how much you got in your pocket?  i want it.”

“i hain’t got only a dollar, and i want that to--”

“it don’t make no difference what you want it for--you just shell it
out.”

ng down town to get some whisky; said he hadn’t had a drink all day.
when he had got out on the shed he put his head in again, and cussed
me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him; and when i
reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again, and told me
to mind about that school, because he was going to lay for me and lick
me if i didn’t drop that.

next day he was drunk, and he went to judge thatcher’s and bullyragged
him, and tried to make him give up the money; but he couldn’t, and then
he swore he’d make the law force him.

the judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away
from him and let one of them be my guardian; but it was a new judge that
had just come, and he didn’t know the old man; so he said courts mustn’t
interfere and separate families if they could help it; said he’d druther
not take a child away from its father.  so judge thatcher and the wido

that pleased the old man till he couldn’t rest.  he said he’d cowhide
me till i was black and blue if i didn’t raise some money for him.  i
borrowed three dollars from judge thatcher, and pap took it and got
drunk, and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying
on; and he kept it up all over town, with a tin pan, till most midnight;
then they jailed him, and next day they had him before court, and jailed
him again for a week.  but he said _he_ was satisfied; said he was boss
of his son, and he’d make it warm for _him_.

when he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him.
so he took him to his own house, and dressed him up clean and nic

rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places, and was most
froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up.  and when they come
to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could
navigate it.

the judge he felt kind of sore.  he said he reckoned a body could reform
the old man with a shotgun, maybe, but he didn’t know no other way.




chapter vi.

well, pretty soon the old man was up and around again, and then he went
for judge thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money, and he
went for me, too, for not stopping school.  he catched me a couple of
times and thrashed me, but i went to school just the same, and dodged
him or outrun him most of the time.  i didn’t want to go to school much
before, but i reckoned i’d go now to spite pap.  that law trial was a
slow business--appeared like they warn’t ever going to get started on it;
so every now and then i’d borrow two or three dollars off of the judge
for him, to

to see who was aboard when she come along, because she would come in
close, where the bread did.  when she’d got pretty well along down
towards me, i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread,
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  where
the log forked i could peep through.

sawyer, and his old aunt polly, and sid and mary, and plenty more.
 everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
says:

“look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.  i
hope so, anyway.”

i didn’t hope so.  they all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  i cou

dred dollars.  you see, he come to town the
morning after the murder, and told about it, and was out with ‘em on the
ferryboat hunt, and right away after he up and left.  before night they
wanted to lynch him, but he was gone, you see.  well, next day they
found out the nigger was gone; they found out he hadn’t ben seen sence
ten o’clock the night the murder was done.  so then they put it on him,
you see; and while they was full of it, next day, back comes old finn,
and went boo-hooing to judge thatcher to get money to hunt for the
nigger all over illinois with. the judge gave him some, and that evening
he got drunk, and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty
hard-looking strangers, and then went off with them.  well, he hain’t
come back sence, and they ain’t looking for him back till this thing
blows over a little, for people thinks now that he killed his boy and
fixed things so folks would think robbers done it, and then he’d get

and then tom he talked along and talked along, and says, le’s all three
slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit, and go for
howling adventures amongst the injuns, over in the territory, for a
couple of weeks or two; and i says, all right, that suits me, but i
ain’t got no money for to buy the outfit, and i reckon i couldn’t get
none from home, because it’s likely pap’s been back before now, and got
it all away from judge thatcher and drunk it up.

“no, he hain’t,” tom says; “it’s all there yet--six thousand dollars
and more; and your pap hain’t ever been back since.  hadn’t when i come
away, anyhow.”

jim says, kind of solemn:

“he ain’t a-comin’ back no mo’, huck.”

i says:

“why, jim?”

“nemmine why, huck--but he ain’t comin’ back no mo.”

but i kept at him; so at last he says:
