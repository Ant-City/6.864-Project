                pilate's
granddaughter and milkman's lover. [CHARACTER] devotes herself to milkman,
even though he loses interest and frequently rejects her. like her
biblical namesake--a servant who, after bearing abraham's son is
thrown out of the house by his barren wife, sarah--[CHARACTER] is used
and abandoned. her plight demonstrates a central theme in song
of solomon: the inevitable abandonment of women who love
men too much.
