[CHARACTER] - 
                one
of israel's judges and an epic hero who thwarts the neighboring
philistines with his superhuman strength. [CHARACTER] is rash, belligerent,
and driven by lust for foreign women--qualities that contradict jewish religious
ideals. [CHARACTER]'s long hair is both the source of his strength and
the symbol of his religious devotion to god as a nazirite. [CHARACTER]'s
character demonstrates that in the bible, heroic potential is gauged
not by human excellence but by faith in god.
