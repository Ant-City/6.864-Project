treplieff. an elm.

nina. why does it look so dark?

treplieff. it is evening; everything looks dark now. don’t go away early, i implore you.

nina. i must.

treplieff. what if i were to follow you, nina? i shall stand in your garden all night with my eyes on your window.

nina. that would be impossible; the watchman would see you, and treasure is not used to you yet, and would bark.

treplieff. [listening to approaching footsteps] who is that? is it you, jacob?

jacob. [on the stage] yes, sir.

sorin. don’t inflict any of your discussions on me again. [he nods toward the sofa] is that bed for me?
