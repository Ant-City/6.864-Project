weary, and old with seruice, to the mercy
of a rude streame, that must for euer hide me.
vaine pompe, and glory of this world, i hate ye,
i feele my heart new open'd. oh how wretched
is that poore man, that hangs on princes fauours?
there is betwixt that smile we would aspire too,
that sweet aspect of princes, and their ruine,
more pangs, and feares then warres, or women haue;
and when he falles, he falles like lucifer,
neuer to hope againe.
enter cromwell, standing amazed.

why how now cromwell?
  crom. i haue no power to speake sir

   car. what, amaz'd
at my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
a great man should decline. nay, and you weep
i am falne indeed

   crom. how does your grace

   card. why well:
neuer so truly happy, my good cromwell,
i know my selfe now, and i feele within me,
a peace aboue all earthly dignities,
a still, and quiet conscience. the king ha's cur'd me,
i humbly thanke his grace: and from these shoulder

whom the king hath in secrecie long married,
this day was view'd in open, as his queene,

   card. there was the waight that pull'd me downe.
o cromwell,
the king ha's gone beyond me: all my glories
in that one woman, i haue lost for euer.
no sun, shall euer vsher forth mine honors,
or gilde againe the noble troopes that waighted
vpon my smiles. go get thee from me cromwel,
i am a poore falne man, vnworthy now

what, and how true thou art; he will aduance thee:
some little memory of me, will stirre him

so good, so noble, and so true a master?
beare witnesse, all that haue not hearts of iron,
with what a sorrow cromwel leaues his lord.
the king shall haue my seruice; but my prayres
for euer, and for euer shall be yours

in all my miseries: but thou hast forc'd me

cromwel, i charge thee, fling away ambition,
by that sinne fell the angels: how can man then
(the image of his maker) hope to win by it?
loue thy selfe last, cherish those hearts that hate thee;
corruption wins not more then honesty.
still in thy right hand, carry gentle peace
to silence enuious tongues. be iust, and feare not;
let all the ends thou aym'st at, be thy countries,
thy gods, and truths. then if thou fall'st (o cromwell)
thou fall'st a blessed martyr.
serue the king: and prythee leade me in:
there take an inuentory of all i haue,
to the last peny, 'tis the kings. my robe,
and my integrity to heauen, is all,
i dare now call mine owne. o cromwel, cromwel,
had i but seru'd my god, with halfe the zeale
i seru'd my king: he would not in mine age
haue left me naked to mine enemies

   crom. good sir, haue patience

the hopes of court, my hopes in heauen do dwell.
