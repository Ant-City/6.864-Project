  and, where the rafters on the columns meet,

  restor'd with poisonous herbs, his ardent sides

  the halls of audience, and of public state,
  and where the lonely queen in secret sate.
  arm'd soldiers now by trembling maids are seen,
  with not a door, and scarce a space, between.
  the house is fill'd with loud laments and cries,
  and shrieks of women rend the vaulted skies;
  the fearful matrons run from place to place,
  and kiss the thresholds, and the posts embrace.
  the fatal work inhuman pyrrhus plies,
  and all his father sparkles in his eyes;
  nor bars, nor fighting guards, his force sustain:

  ev'n hector now in vain, like priam, would appear.

  or in one common fate with us be join'd.'
  she said, and with a last salute embrac'd

  pursued by pyrrhus, there for safety runs.
  thro' swords and foes, amaz'd and hurt, he flies
  thro' empty courts and open galleries.

  and often reaches, and his thrusts renews.
  the youth, transfix'd, with lamentable cries,
  expires before his wretched parent's eyes:
  whom gasping at his feet when priam saw,
  the fear of death gave place to nature's law;
  and, shaking more with anger than with age,
  'the gods,' said he, 'requite thy brutal rage!

  "this said, his feeble hand a javelin threw,
  which, flutt'ring, seem'd to loiter as it flew:
  just, and but barely, to the mark it held,
  and faintly tinkled on the brazen shield.

  "then pyrrhus thus: 'go thou from me to fate,
  and to my father my foul deeds relate.
  now die!' with that he dragg'd the trembling sire,
  slidd'ring thro' clotter'd blood and holy mire,
  (the mingled paste his murder'd son had made,)
  haul'd from beneath the violated shade,
  and on the sacred pile the royal victim laid.

  the way to death is wide, th' approaches near:
  for soon relentless pyrrhus will appear,
  reeking with priam's blood- the wretch who slew
  the son (inhuman) in the father's view,
  and then the sire himself to the dire altar drew.
  o goddess mother, give me back to fate;
