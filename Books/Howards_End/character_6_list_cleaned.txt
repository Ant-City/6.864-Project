theobald ("[CHARACTER]") schlegel 
 - 
                [CHARACTER] is margaret and helen's younger 
brother, a peevish 16-year-old, who grows up and attends oxford.  
[CHARACTER] is prone to acting out the flaws of the 
schlegel family--their excessive aestheticism, 
indulgence in luxury, and indolence--but shows real 
improvement by the end of the novel.
