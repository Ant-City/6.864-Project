 a man-size game in the lot,” i said.

“but they are interesting--i like them,” jeff objected, “and i’m sure
they are educational.”

“i’m sick and tired of being educated,” terry protested. “fancy going to
a dame school--at our age. i want to get out!”

but we could not get out, and we were being educated swiftly. our
special tutors rose rapidly in our esteem. they seemed of rather finer
quality than the guards, though all were on terms of easy friendliness.
mine was named somel, jeff’s zava, and terry’s moadine. we tried to
generalize from the names, those of the guards, and of our three girls,
but got nowhere.

“they sound well enough, and they’re mostly short, but there’s no
similarity of termination--and no two alike. however, our acquaintance
is limited as yet.”

there were many things we meant to ask--as soon as we could talk well
enough. better teaching i never saw. from morning to night there was
somel, always on call except between two and four; al

understand some time earlier that if we would agree to do no violence
they would withdraw their constant attendance, and we promised most
willingly.

so there we sat, at ease; all in similar dress; our hair, by now, as
long as theirs, only our beards to distinguish us. we did not want those
beards, but had so far been unable to induce them to give us any cutting
instruments.

“ladies,” terry began, out of a clear sky, as it were, “are there no men
in this country?”

“men?” somel answered. “like you?”

“yes, men,” terry indicated his beard, and threw back his broad
shoulders. “men, real men.”

“no,” she answered quietly. “there are no men in this country. there has
not been a man among us for two thousand years.”

her look was clear and truthful and she did not advance this astonishing
statement as if it was astonishing, but quite as a matter of fact.

“but--the people--the children,” he protested, not believing her in the
least, but not wishing

e passed this over rather hurriedly, saying that the same term would
apply, but was seldom used.

“no?” she said. “but one cannot mate without the other surely. is not
each then--virgin--before mating? and, tell me, have you any forms of
life in which there is birth from a father only?”

“i know of none,” he answered, and i inquired seriously.

“you ask us to believe that for two thousand years there have been only
women here, and only girl babies born?”

“exactly,” answered somel, nodding gravely. “of course we know that
among other animals it is not so, that there are fathers as well as
mothers; and we see that you are fathers, that you come from a people
who are of both kinds. we have been waiting, you see, for you to be able
to speak freely with us, and teach us about your country and the rest of
the world. you know so much, you see, and we know only our own land.”

in the course of our previous studies we had been at some pains to tell
them about the big world o

re were a lot of things they did not
know.

they had the evenest tempers, the most perfect patience and good
nature--one of the things most impressive about them all was the absence
of irritability. so far we had only this group to study, but afterward i
found it a common trait.

we had gradually come to feel that we were in the hands of friends, and
very capable ones at that--but we couldn’t form any opinion yet of the
general level of these women.

“we want you to teach us all you can,” somel went on, her firm shapely
hands clasped on the table before her, her clear quiet eyes meeting
ours frankly. “and we want to teach you what we have that is novel and
useful. you can well imagine that it is a wonderful event to us, to have
men among us--after two thousand years. and we want to know about your
women.”

what she said about our importance gave instant pleasure to terry. i
could see by the way he lifted his head that it pleased him. but when
she spoke of our women--someway i had

urse we
see, with our birds, that the father is as useful as the mother, almost.
but among insects we find him of less importance, sometimes very little.
is it not so with you?”

“oh, yes, birds and bugs,” terry said, “but not among animals--have you
no animals?”

“we have cats,” she said. “the father is not very useful.”

“have you no cattle--sheep--horses?” i drew some rough outlines of these
beasts and showed them to her.

“we had, in the very old days, these,” said somel, and sketched with
swift sure touches a sort of sheep or llama, “and these”--dogs, of two
or three kinds, “that that”--pointing to my absurd but recognizable
horse.

“what became of them?” asked jeff.

“we do not want them anymore. they took up too much room--we need all
our land to feed our people. it is such a little country, you know.”

“whatever do you do without milk?” terry demanded incredulously.

“milk? we have milk in abundance--our own.”

“but--but--i mean fo

ttle for their milk, as well as
for their meat,” he explained. “cow’s milk is a staple article of diet.
there is a great milk industry--to collect and distribute it.”

still they looked puzzled. i pointed to my outline of a cow. “the farmer
milks the cow,” i said, and sketched a milk pail, the stool, and in
pantomime showed the man milking. “then it is carried to the city and
distributed by milkmen--everybody has it at the door in the morning.”

“has the cow no child?” asked somel earnestly.

“oh, yes, of course, a calf, that is.”

“is there milk for the calf and you, too?”

it took some time to make clear to those three sweet-faced women the
process which robs the cow of her calf, and the calf of its true food;
and the talk led us into a further discussion of the meat business. they
heard it out, looking very white, and presently begged to be excused.

understand that you keep an animal--an unmated male animal--that
bites children? about how many are there of them, please?”

“thousands--in a large city,” said jeff, “and nearly every family has
one in the country.”

terry broke in at this. “you must not imagine they are all
dangerous--it’s not one in a hundred that ever bites anybody. why, they
are the best friends of the children--a boy doesn’t have half a chance
that hasn’t a dog to play with!”

“and the girls?” asked somel.

“oh--girls--why they like them too,” he said, but his voice flatted a
little. they always noticed little things like that, we found later.

little by little they wrung from us the fact that the friend of man,
in the city, was a prisoner; was taken out for his meager exercise on
a leash; was liable not only to many diseases but to the one destroying
horror of rabies; and, in many cases, for the safety of the citizens,
had to go muzzled. jeff maliciously added vivid instances he had known

then she made notes of “burglars” and went on: “because of the love
which people bear to this animal.”

zava interrupted here. “is it the men or the women who love this animal
so much?”

“both!” insisted terry.

“equally?” she inquired.

and jeff said, “nonsense, terry--you know men like dogs better than
women do--as a whole.”

“because they love it so much--especially men. this animal is kept shut
up, or chained.”

“why?” suddenly asked somel. “we keep our father cats shut up because
we do not want too much fathering; but they are not chained--they have
large grounds to run in.”

“a valuable dog would be stolen if he was let loose,” i said. “we put
collars on them, with the owner’s name, in case they do stray. besides,
they get into fights--a valuable dog might easily be killed by a bigger
one.”

“i see,” she said. “they fight when they meet--is that common?” we
admitted that it was.

“they are kept shut up,

us--what is the work of the world, that men do--which we have not here?”

“oh, everything,” terry said grandly. “the men do everything, with us.”
 he squared his broad shoulders and lifted his chest. “we do not allow
our women to work. women are loved--idolized--honored--kept in the home
to care for the children.”

“what is ‘the home’?” asked somel a little wistfully.

but zava begged: “tell me first, do no women work, really?”

“why, yes,” terry admitted. “some have to, of the poorer sort.”

“about how many--in your country?”

“about seven or eight million,” said jeff, as mischievous as ever.

“i should say not!” protested terry. “we have systems of law that go
back thousands and thousands of years--just as you do, no doubt,” he
finished politely.

“oh no,” moadine told him. “we have no laws over a hundred years old,
and most of them are under twenty. in a few weeks more,” she continued,
“we are going to have the pleasure of showing you over our little land
and explaining everything you care to know about. we want you to see our
people.”

“and i assure you,” somel added, “that our people want to see you.”

terry brightened up immensely at this news, and reconciled himself to
the renewed demands upon our capacity as teachers. it was lucky that we
knew so little, really, and had no books to refer to, else, i fancy we
might all be there yet, teaching those eager-minded women about the rest
of the world.

bundle, to say nothing of the
common needs of all the bundles. but these women were working all
together at the grandest of tasks--they were making people--and they
made them well.

there followed a period of “negative eugenics” which must have been an
appalling sacrifice. we are commonly willing to “lay down our lives” for
our country, but they had to forego motherhood for their country--and it
was precisely the hardest thing for them to do.

when i got this far in my reading i went to somel for more light. we
were as friendly by that time as i had ever been in my life with any
woman. a mighty comfortable soul she was, giving one the nice smooth
mother-feeling a man likes in a woman, and yet giving also the clear
intelligence and dependableness i used to assume to be masculine
qualities. we had talked volumes already.

“see here,” said i. “here was this dreadful period when they got far too
thick, and decided to limit the population. we have a lot of talk about
that among us,

, of whom we
boasted so proudly, were in any way inferior to them. i am ashamed
to say that i equivocated. i told her of certain criminal types of
women--perverts, or crazy, who had been known to commit infanticide. i
told her, truly enough, that there was much in our land which was
open to criticism, but that i hated to dwell on our defects until they
understood us and our conditions better.

and, making a wide detour, i scrambled back to my question of how they
limited the population.

as for somel, she seemed sorry, a little ashamed even, of her too
clearly expressed amazement. as i look back now, knowing them better, i
am more and more and more amazed as i appreciate the exquisite courtesy
with which they had received over and over again statements and
admissions on our part which must have revolted them to the soul.

she explained to me, with sweet seriousness, that as i had supposed, at
first each woman bore five children; and that, in their eager desire
to build up a nation, they had

in this, as in so many other points we had now to observe, there was
shown the action of a practical intelligence, coupled with fine artistic
feeling, and, apparently, untrammeled by any injurious influences.

our first step of comparative freedom was a personally conducted tour of
the country. no pentagonal bodyguard now! only our special tutors,
and we got on famously with them. jeff said he loved zava like an
aunt--“only jollier than any aunt i ever saw”; somel and i were as
chummy as could be--the best of friends; but it was funny to watch terry
and moadine. she was patient with him, and courteous, but it was like
the patience and courtesy of some great man, say a skilled, experienced
diplomat, with a schoolgirl. her grave acquiescence with his most
preposterous expression of feeling; her genial laughter, not only
with, but, i often felt, at him--though impeccably polite; her
innocent questions, which almost invariably led him to say more than he

h that seldom showed.
her eye was as quietly watchful as a fencer’s. she maintained a pleasant
relation with her charge, but i doubt if many, even in that country,
could have done as well.

he called her “maud,” amongst ourselves, and said she was “a good old
soul, but a little slow”; wherein he was quite wrong. needless to
say, he called jeff’s teacher “java,” and sometimes “mocha,” or plain
“coffee”; when specially mischievous, “chicory,” and even “postum.” but
somel rather escaped this form of humor, save for a rather forced “some
‘ell.”

“don’t you people have but one name?” he asked one day, after we
had been introduced to a whole group of them, all with pleasant,
few-syllabled strange names, like the ones we knew.

“oh yes,” moadine told him. “a good many of us have another, as we get
on in life--a descriptive one. that is the name we earn. sometimes even
that is changed, or added to, in an unusually rich life. such as our
present land

air. “no family name?”

“why no,” she said. “why should we? we are all descended from a common
source--all one ‘family’ in reality. you see, our comparatively brief
and limited history gives us that advantage at least.”

“but does not each mother want her own child to bear her name?” i asked.

“no--why should she? the child has its own.”

“why for--for identification--so people will know whose child she is.”

“we keep the most careful records,” said somel. “each one of us has our
exact line of descent all the way back to our dear first mother. there
are many reasons for doing that. but as to everyone knowing which child
belongs to which mother--why should she?”

here, as in so many other instances, we were led to feel the difference
between the purely maternal and the paternal attitude of mind. the
element of personal pride seemed strangely lacking.

“how about your other works?” asked jeff. “don’t you sign your names to
them--books

and statues and so on?”

“yes, surely, we are all glad and proud to. not only books and statues,
but all kinds of work. you will find little names on the houses, on the
furniture, on the dishes sometimes. because otherwise one is likely to
forget, and we want to know to whom to be grateful.”

“you speak as if it were done for the convenience of the consumer--not
the pride of the producer,” i suggested.

“it’s both,” said somel. “we have pride enough in our work.”

“then why not in your children?” urged jeff.

“but we have! we’re magnificently proud of them,” she insisted.

“then why not sign ‘em?” said terry triumphantly.

moadine turned to him with her slightly quizzical smile. “because the
finished product is not a private one. when they are babies, we do speak
of them, at times, as ‘essa’s lato,’ or ‘novine’s amel’; but that is
merely descriptive and conversational. in the records

 careful education, which followed each
slight tendency to differ, and partly to the law of mutation. this they
had found in their work with plants, and fully proven in their own case.

physically they were more alike than we, as they lacked all morbid or
excessive types. they were tall, strong, healthy, and beautiful as a
race, but differed individually in a wide range of feature, coloring,
and expression.

“but surely the most important growth is in mind--and in the things we
make,” urged somel. “do you find your physical variation accompanied by
a proportionate variation in ideas, feelings, and products? or, among
people who look more alike, do you find their internal life and their
work as similar?”

we were rather doubtful on this point, and inclined to hold that there
was more chance of improvement in greater physical variation.

“it certainly should be,” zava admitted. “we have always thought it a
grave initial misfortune to have lost half our little world. perhaps

condition’s sure to have unnatural results. you’ll find some awful
characteristics--see if you don’t! for instance--we don’t know yet what
they do with their criminals--their defectives--their aged. you notice
we haven’t seen any! there’s got to be something!”

i was inclined to believe that there had to be something, so i took the
bull by the horns--the cow, i should say!--and asked somel.

“i want to find some flaw in all this perfection,” i told her flatly.
“it simply isn’t possible that three million people have no faults. we
are trying our best to understand and learn--would you mind helping us
by saying what, to your minds, are the worst qualities of this unique
civilization of yours?”

we were sitting together in a shaded arbor, in one of those
eating-gardens of theirs. the delicious food had been eaten, a plate of
fruit still before us. we could look out on one

side over a stretch of
open country, quietly rich and lovely; on the other, the garden, with
tables here and there, far apart enough for privacy. let me say right
here that with all their careful “balance of population” there was no
crowding in this country. there was room, space, a sunny breezy freedom
everywhere.

somel set her chin upon her hand, her elbow on the low wall beside her,
and looked off over the fair land.

“of course we have faults--all of us,” she said. “in one way you
might say that we have more than we used to--that is, our standard
of perfection seems to get farther and farther away. but we are not
discouraged, because our records do show gain--considerable gain.

“when we began--even with the start of one particularly noble mother--we
inherited the characteristics of a long race-reco

 the girl showing the bad qualities had still the power to appreciate
social duty, we appealed to her, by that, to renounce motherhood. some
of the few worst types were, fortunately, unable to reproduce. but if
the fault was in a disproportionate egotism--then the girl was sure
she had the right to have children, even that hers would be better than
others.”

“i can see that,” i said. “and then she would be likely to rear them in
the same spirit.”

“that we never allowed,” answered somel quietly.

“allowed?” i queried. “allowed a mother to rear her own children?”

“certainly not,” said somel, “unless she was fit for that supreme task.”

this was rather a blow to my previous convictions.

“but i thought motherhood was for each of you--”

“motherhood--yes, that is, maternity, to bear a child. but education is
our highest art, only allowed to our highest artists.”

“education?” i was puzzled again. “i don’t mean education. i mean by

we had been urged to give, as fully as we cared to, a sort of synopsis
of world history, in brief, and to answer questions.

“we are so utterly ignorant, you see,” moadine had explained to us. “we
know nothing but such science as we have worked out for ourselves,
just the brain work of one small half-country; and you, we gather, have
helped one another all over the globe, sharing your discoveries, pooling
your progress. how wonderful, how supremely beautiful your civilization
must be!”

somel gave a further suggestion.

“you do not have to begin all over again, as you did with us. we have
made a sort of digest of what we have learned from you, and it has been
eagerly absorbed, all over the country. perhaps you would like to see
our outline?”

we were eager to see it, and deeply impressed. to us, at first, these
women, unavoidably ignorant of what to us was the basic commonplace of
knowledge, had seemed on the plane of children, or of savages. what we
had been forced to admit, wi

girls--hundreds of them--eager, bright-eyed, attentive young faces;
crowding questions, and, i regret to say, an increasing inability on our
part to answer them effectively.

our special guides, who were on the platform with us, and sometimes
aided in clarifying a question or, oftener, an answer, noticed this
effect, and closed the formal lecture part of the evening rather
shortly.

“our young women will be glad to meet you,” somel suggested, “to talk
with you more personally, if you are willing?”

willing! we were impatient and said as much, at which i saw a flickering
little smile cross moadine’s face. even then, with all those eager young
things waiting to talk to us, a sudden question crossed my mind: “what
was their point of view? what did they think of us?” we learned that
later.

terry plunged in among those young creatures with a sort of rapture,
somewhat as a glad swimmer takes to the sea. jeff, with a

she never gave an inch. a big, handsome creature, rather exceptionally
strong even in that race of strong women, with a proud head and sweeping
level brows that lined across above her dark eager eyes like the wide
wings of a soaring hawk.

i was good friends with all three of them but best of all with ellador,
long before that feeling changed, for both of us.

from her, and from somel, who talked very freely with me, i learned at
last something of the viewpoint of herland toward its visitors.

here they were, isolated, happy, contented, when the booming buzz of our
biplane tore the air above them.

everybody heard it--saw it--for miles and miles, word flashed all over
the country, and a council was held in every town and village.

and this was their rapid determination:

everting to their earlier bi-sexual order of nature.

beside this underlying consideration there was the limitless interest
and curiosity in our civilization, purely impersonal, and held by an
order of mind beside which we were like--schoolboys.

it was small wonder that our lectures were not a success; and none at
all that our, or at least terry’s, advances were so ill received. the
reason for my own comparative success was at first far from pleasing to
my pride.

“we like you the best,” somel told me, “because you seem more like us.”

“more like a lot of women!” i thought to myself disgustedly, and then
remembered how little like “women,” in our derogatory sense, they were.
she was smiling at me, reading my thought.

“we can quite see that we do not seem like--women--to you. of course,
in a bi-sexual race the distinctive feature of each sex must be
intensified. but surely there are characteristics enough which belong
to people, aren’t there? that’s what i mean abou

 agreeable and interesting, and before
them stretched the years of learning and discovery, the fascinating,
endless process of education.

as i looked into these methods and compared them with our own, my
strange uncomfortable sense of race-humility grew apace.

ellador could not understand my astonishment. she explained things
kindly and sweetly, but with some amazement that they needed explaining,
and with sudden questions as to how we did it that left me meeker than
ever.

i betook myself to somel one day, carefully not taking ellador. i did
not mind seeming foolish to somel--she was used to it.

“i want a chapter of explanation,” i told her. “you know my stupidities
by heart, and i do not want to show them to ellador--she thinks me so
wise!”

she smiled delightedly. “it is beautiful to see,” she told me, “this
new wonderful love between you. the whole country is interested, you
know--how can we help it!”

i had not thought of that. we say: “all the world loves a lover,

 at work, slowly and
carefully, developing our whole people along these lines. it is glorious
work--splendid! to see the thousands of babies improving, showing
stronger clearer minds, sweeter dispositions, higher capacities--don’t
you find it so in your country?”

this i evaded flatly. i remembered the cheerless claim that the human
mind was no better than in its earliest period of savagery, only better
informed--a statement i had never believed.

“we try most earnestly for two powers,” somel continued. “the two that
seem to us basically necessary for all noble life: a clear, far-reaching
judgment, and a strong well-used will. we spend our best efforts, all
through childhood and youth, in developing these faculties, individual
judgment and will.”

“as part of your system of education, you mean?”

“exactly. as the most valuable part. with the babies, as you may have
noticed, we first provide an environment which feeds the mind without
tiring it; all manner of simple and int

mind, we provide choices, simple choices, with very obvious causes and
consequences. you’ve noticed the games?”

i had. the children seemed always playing something; or else, sometimes,
engaged in peaceful researches of their own. i had wondered at first
when they went to school, but soon found that they never did--to their
knowledge. it was all education but no schooling.

“we have been working for some sixteen hundred years, devising better
and better games for children,” continued somel.

i sat aghast. “devising games?” i protested. “making up new ones, you
mean?”

“exactly,” she answered. “don’t you?”

then i remembered the kindergarten, and the “material” devised by
signora montessori, and guardedly replied: “to some extent.” but most
of our games, i told her, were very old--came down from child to child,
along the ages, from the remote past.

“and what is their effect?” she asked. “do they develop the faculties
you wish to encourage?”

eception, that jeff and i feared the worst. we tried to
caution him--much good that did. the big handsome fellow drew himself up
to his full height, lifted that great chest of his, and laughed.

“there are three separate marriages,” he said. “i won’t interfere with
yours--nor you with mine.”

so the great day came, and the countless crowds of women, and we three
bridegrooms without any supporting “best men,” or any other men to back
us up, felt strangely small as we came forward.

somel and zava and moadine were on hand; we were thankful to have them,
too--they seemed almost like relatives.

there was a splendid procession, wreathing dances, the new anthem i
spoke of, and the whole great place pulsed with feeling--the deep awe,
the sweet hope, the wondering expectation of a new miracle.

“there has been nothing like this in the country since our motherhood
began!” somel said softly to me, while we watched the symbolic marches.
“you see, it is the dawn of a new era. you d

 lines, reaching higher
and going faster up to the smooth comfort of their present life. we
had learned a little of their psychology, a much wider field than the
history, but here we could not follow so readily. we were now well used
to seeing women not as females but as people; people of all sorts, doing
every kind of work.

this outbreak of terry’s, and the strong reaction against it, gave us
a new light on their genuine femininity. this was given me with great
clearness by both ellador and somel. the feeling was the same--sick
revulsion and horror, such as would be felt at some climactic blasphemy.

they had no faintest approach to such a thing in their minds, knowing
nothing of the custom of marital indulgence among us. to them the one
high purpose of motherhood had been for so long the governing law of
life, and the contribution of the father, though known to them, so
distinctly another method to the same end, that they could not, with all
their effort, get the point of view of the m

ation of revolt had warned us; they had been extracting the
evidence without our knowing it all this time, and now were studying
with the most devout earnestness the matter they had prepared.

the result was rather distressing to us. they first explained the matter
fully to ellador, as she was the one who purposed visiting the rest
of the world. to celis they said nothing. she must not be in any way
distressed, while the whole nation waited on her great work.

finally jeff and i were called in. somel and zava were there, and
ellador, with many others that we knew.

they had a great globe, quite fairly mapped out from the small section
maps in that compendium of ours. they had the different peoples of the
earth roughly outlined, and their status in civilization indicated.
they had charts and figures and estimates, based on the facts in that
traitorous little book and what they had learned from us.

somel explained: “we find that in all your historic period, so much
longer than ours, that w
