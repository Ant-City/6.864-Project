the [CHARACTER] - 
                the
[CHARACTER] of brobdingnag, who is so delighted by gulliver's beauty and
charms that she agrees to buy him from the farmer for 1,000 pieces
of gold. gulliver appreciates her kindness after the hardships he
suffers at the farmer's and shows his usual fawning love for royalty
by kissing the tip of her little finger when presented before her.
she possesses, in gulliver's words, "infinite" wit and humor, though
this description may entail a bit of gulliver's characteristic flattery
of superiors. the [CHARACTER] seems genuinely considerate, asking gulliver
whether he would consent to live at court instead of simply taking
him in as a pet and inquiring into the reasons for his cold good-byes
with the farmer. she is by no means a hero, but simply a pleasant,
powerful person.
