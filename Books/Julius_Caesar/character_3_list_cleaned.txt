talented general and longtime acquaintance of caesar. [CHARACTER] dislikes
the fact that caesar has become godlike in the eyes of the romans.

and must die, finally converting brutus to his cause by sending

about the way the political world works. a shrewd opportunist, he
proves successful but lacks integrity.
