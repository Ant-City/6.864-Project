 grief that thou hast to tell for our princes?

messenger
death; and the living are guilty for the dead.

leader
and who is the slayer? who the stricken? speak.

messenger
haemon hath perished; his blood hath been shed by no stranger.

leader
by his father's hand, or by his own?

messenger
by his own, in wrath with his sire for the murder.

leader
o prophet, how true, then, hast thou proved thy word!

messenger
these things stand thus; ye must consider of the rest.

leader
lo, i see the hapless eurydice, creon's wife, approaching; she comes from the house by chance, haply,-or because she knows the tidings of her son.
enter eurydice from the palace.

eurydice
people of thebes, i heard your words as i was going forth, to salute the goddess pallas with my prayers. even as i was loosing the fastenings of the gate, to open it, the message of a household woe smote on mine ear: i sank back, terror-stricken, into the arms of my handmaids, and my senses fled. but say again what the tidings were; i shal

chorus
thou canst behold: 'tis no longer hidden within.
the doors of the palace are opened, and the corpse of eurydice is disclosed.

creon
antistrophe 2

ah me,-yonder i behold a new, a second woe! what destiny, ah what, can yet await me? i have but now raised my son in my arms,-and there, again, i see a corpse before me! alas, alas, unhappy mother! alas, my child!

messenger
there, at the altar, self-stabbed with a keen knife, she suffered her darkening eyes to close, when she had wailed for the noble fate of megareus who died before, and then for his fate who lies there,-and when, with her last breath, she h
