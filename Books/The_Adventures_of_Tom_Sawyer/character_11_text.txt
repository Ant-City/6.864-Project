preface

most of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred; one or two
were experiences of my own, the rest those of boys who were schoolmates
of mine. huck finn is drawn from life; tom sawyer also, but not from an
individual--he is a combination of the characteristics of three boys whom
i knew, and therefore belongs to the composite order of architecture.

buted themselves about the house and
occupied pews with their parents, so as to be under supervision. aunt
polly came, and tom and sid and mary sat with her--tom being placed next
the aisle, in order that he might be as far away from the open window
and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. the crowd filed up
the aisles: the aged and needy postmaster, who had seen better days;
the mayor and his wife--for they had a mayor there, among other
unnecessaries; the justice of the peace; the widow douglass, fair,
smart, and forty, a generous, good-hearted soul and well-to-do, her hill
mansion the only palace in the town, and the most hospitable and much
the most lavish in the matter of festivities that st. petersburg could
boast; the bent and venerable major and mrs. ward; lawyer riverson, the
new notable from a distance; next the belle of the village, followed by
a troop of lawn-clad and ribbon-decked young heart-breakers; then all
the young clerks in town in a body--for they had stood in the v

him. the last thing mrs.
thatcher said to becky, was:

�you�ll not get back till late. perhaps you�d better stay all night with
some of the girls that live near the ferry-landing, child.�

�then i�ll stay with susy harper, mamma.�

�very well. and mind and behave yourself and don�t be any trouble.�

presently, as they tripped along, tom said to becky:

�say--i�ll tell you what we�ll do. �stead of going to joe harper�s we�ll
climb right up the hill and stop at the widow douglas�. she�ll have
ice-cream! she has it most every day--dead loads of it. and she�ll be
awful glad to have us.�

�oh, that will be fun!�

then becky reflected a moment and said:

�but what will mamma say?�

�how�ll she ever know?�

the girl turned the idea over in her mind, and said reluctantly:

�i reckon it�s wrong--but--�

�but shucks! your mother won�t know, and so what�s the harm? all she
wants is that you�ll be safe; and i bet you she�d �a� said go th

ere if
she�d �a� thought of it. i know she would!�

the widow douglas� splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. it and
tom�s persuasions presently carried the day. so it was decided to say
nothing to anybody about the night�s programme. presently it occurred to
tom that maybe huck might come this very night and give the signal. the
thought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. still he
could not bear to give up the fun at widow douglas�. and why should he
give it up, he reasoned--the signal did not come the night before, so
why should it be any more likely to come tonight? the sure fun of the
evening outweighed the uncertain treasure; and, boy-like, he determined
to yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think of
the box of money another time that day.

three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woody
hollow and tied up. the crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forest

heart. the hooting of an
owl came over the hill--ominous sound! but no footsteps. heavens, was
everything lost! he was about to spring with winged feet, when a man
cleared his throat not four feet from him! huck�s heart shot into his
throat, but he swallowed it again; and then he stood there shaking as
if a dozen agues had taken charge of him at once, and so weak that he
thought he must surely fall to the ground. he knew where he was. he
knew he was within five steps of the stile leading into widow douglas�
grounds. very well, he thought, let them bury it there; it won�t be hard
to find.

now there was a voice--a very low voice--injun joe�s:

�damn her, maybe she�s got company--there�s lights, late as it is.�

�i can�t see any.�

this was that stranger�s voice--the stranger of the haunted house. a
deadly chill went to huck�s heart--this, then, was the �revenge� job! his
thought was, to fly. then he remembered that the widow douglas had been
kind to him more than once,

mfortable. in fact, everything seemed to be
drifting just in the right direction, now; the treasure must be still
in no. 2, the men would be captured and jailed that day, and he and
tom could seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear of
interruption.

just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. huck
jumped for a hiding-place, for he had no mind to be connected even
remotely with the late event. the welshman admitted several ladies and
gentlemen, among them the widow douglas, and noticed that groups of
citizens were climbing up the hill--to stare at the stile. so the news
had spread. the welshman had to tell the story of the night to the
visitors. the widow�s gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.

�don�t say a word about it, madam. there�s another that you�re more
beholden to than you are to me and my boys, maybe, but he don�t allow me
to tell his name. we wouldn�t have been there but for him.�

of course this excited a curiosity so vast tha

 morning dawned at
last, all the word that came was, �send more candles--and send food.�
 mrs. thatcher was almost crazed; and aunt polly, also. judge thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
no real cheer.

the old welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. he found huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
fever. the physicians were all at the cave, so the widow douglas came
and took charge of the patient. she said she would do her best by him,
because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent, he was the lord�s,
and nothing that was the lord�s was a thing to be neglected. the
welshman said huck had good spots in him, and the widow said:

�you can depend on it. that�s the lord�s mark. he don�t leave it off.
he never does. puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from his
hands.�

early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle

 worn, all the time. tom got about, a little, on thursday,
was downtown friday, and nearly as whole as ever saturday; but becky
did not leave her room until sunday, and then she looked as if she had
passed through a wasting illness.

tom learned of huck�s sickness and went to see him on friday, but could
not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on saturday or sunday.
he was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his
adventure and introduce no exciting topic. the widow douglas stayed by
to see that he obeyed. at home tom learned of the cardiff hill event;
also that the �ragged man�s� body had eventually been found in the river
near the ferry-landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape,
perhaps.

about a fortnight after tom�s rescue from the cave, he started off to
visit huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting
talk, and tom had some that would interest him, he thought. judge
thatcher�s house was on tom�s way, and he stopped

 be a merciful ass and trample his duty
under foot. injun joe was believed to have killed five citizens of the
village, but what of that? if he had been satan himself there would
have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their names to a
pardon-petition, and drip a tear on it from their permanently impaired
and leaky water-works.

the morning after the funeral tom took huck to a private place to have
an important talk. huck had learned all about tom�s adventure from the
welshman and the widow douglas, by this time, but tom said he reckoned
there was one thing they had not told him; that thing was what he wanted
to talk about now. huck�s face saddened. he said:

�i know what it is. you got into no. 2 and never found anything but
whiskey. nobody told me it was you; but i just knowed it must �a� ben
you, soon as i heard �bout that whiskey business; and i knowed you
hadn�t got the money becuz you�d �a� got at me some way or other and
told me even if you was mum to everybody el

-i�ll haul the wagon for you. why, it�s not as
light as it might be. got bricks in it?--or old metal?�

�old metal,� said tom.

�i judged so; the boys in this town will take more trouble and fool away
more time hunting up six bits� worth of old iron to sell to the foundry
than they would to make twice the money at regular work. but that�s
human nature--hurry along, hurry along!�

the boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.

�never mind; you�ll see, when we get to the widow douglas�.�

huck said with some apprehension--for he was long used to being falsely
accused:

�mr. jones, we haven�t been doing nothing.�

the welshman laughed.

�well, i don�t know, huck, my boy. i don�t know about that. ain�t you
and the widow good friends?�

�yes. well, she�s ben good friends to me, anyway.�

�all right, then. what do you want to be afraid for?�

this question was not entirely answered in huck�s slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with tom

om and huck appeared they were courted, admired,
stared at. the boys were not able to remember that their remarks had
possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and
repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as
remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying
commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. the village paper
published biographical sketches of the boys.

the widow douglas put huck�s money out at six per cent., and judge
thatcher did the same with tom�s at aunt polly�s request. each lad had
an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in
the year and half of the sundays. it was just what the minister got--no,
it was what he was promised--he generally couldn�t collect it. a dollar
and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.

r had never looked so tall and so superb as when he
walked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. she went straight
off and told tom about it.

judge thatcher hoped to see tom a great lawyer or a great soldier some
day. he said he meant to look to it that tom should be admitted to the
national military academy and afterward trained in the best law school
in the country, in order that he might be ready for either career or
both.

huck finn�s wealth and the fact that he was now under the widow douglas�
protection introduced him into society--no, dragged him into it, hurled
him into it--and his sufferings were almost more than he could bear. the
widow�s servants kept him clean and neat, combed and brushed, and they
bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that had not one little spot
or stain which he could press to his heart and know for a friend. he had
to eat with a knife and fork; he had to use napkin, cup, and plate;
he had to learn his book, he had to go to church; he had to talk
