    will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
  gloucester. is paris lost? is rouen yielded up?
    if henry were recall'd to life again,
    these news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
  exeter. how were they lost? what treachery was us'd?
  messenger. no treachery, but want of men and money.
    amongst the soldiers this is muttered
    that here you maintain several factions;
    and whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
    you are disputing of your generals:
    one would have ling'ring wars, with little cost;
    another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
    a third thinks, without expense at all,
    by guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
    awake, awake, english nobility!
    let not sloth dim your honours, new-begot.
    cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
    of england's coat one half is cut away.
  exeter. were our tears wanting to this funeral,
    these tidings would call forth their flowing tides.

    the french exclaim'd the devil was in arms;
    all the whole army stood agaz'd on him.
    his soldiers, spying his undaunted spirit,
    'a talbot! a talbot!' cried out amain,
    and rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
    here had the conquest fully been seal'd up
    if sir john fastolfe had not play'd the coward.
    he, being in the vaward plac'd behind
    with purpose to relieve and follow them-
    cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke;
    hence grew the general wreck and massacre.
    enclosed were they with their enemies.
    a base walloon, to win the dauphin's grace,
    thrust talbot with a spear into the back;
    whom all france, with their chief assembled strength,
    durst not presume to look once in the face.
  bedford. is talbot slain? then i will slay myself,
    for living idly here in pomp and ease,
    whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
    unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.

    'tis said the stout parisians do revolt
    and turn again unto the warlike french.

    and means to give you battle presently.
  charles. somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;
    but we will presently provide for them.

    now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.
  pucelle. of all base passions fear is most accurs'd.
