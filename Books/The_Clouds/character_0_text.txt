     scene: the interior of a sleeping-apartment:

     midnight.

     strepsiades (sitting up in his bed). ah me! ah me! o
     king jupiter, of what a terrible length the nights are!
     will it never be day? and yet long since i heard the
     cock. my domestics are snoring; but they would not have
     done so heretofore! may you perish then, o war! for many
     reasons; because i may not even punish my domestics.
     neither does this excellent youth awake through the
     night; but takes his ease, wrapped up in five blankets.
     well, if it is the fashion, let us

     strep. though fallen, still i will not lie prostrate:
     but having prayed to the gods, i will go myself to the
     thinking-shop and get taught. how, then, being an old
     man, shall i learn the subtleties of refined
     disquisitions? i must go. why thus do i loiter and not
     knock at the door?

     [knocks at the door.]

     boy! little boy!

     disciple (from within). go to the devil! who it is that
     knocked at the door?

     strep. strepsiades, the son of phidon, of cicynna.

     dis. you are a stupid fellow, by jove! who have kicked
     against the door so very carelessly, and have caused the
     miscarriage of an idea which i had conceived.

     strep. pardon me; for i dwell afar in the country. but
     tell me the thing which has been made to miscarry.

     dis. it is not lawful to mention it, except to
     disciples.

     strep. tell it, then, to me without fear; for i here am
     come as a disciple to the thinking-shop.

s, in order that we may behold clearly the
     far-seen watch-towers, and the fruits, and the
     fostering, sacred earth, and the rushing sounds of the
     divine rivers, and the roaring, loud-sounding sea; for
     the unwearied eye of aether sparkles with glittering
     rays. come, let us shake off the watery cloud from our
     immortal forms and survey the earth with far-seeing eye.

     soc. o ye greatly venerable clouds, ye have clearly
     heard me when i called.

     [turning to strepsiades.]

     did you hear the voice, and the thunder which bellowed
     at the same time, feared as a god?

     strep. i too worship you, o ye highly honoured, and am
     inclined to reply to the thundering, so much do i
     tremble at them and am alarmed. and whether it be
     lawful, or be not lawful, i have a desire just now to
     ease myself.

     soc. don't scoff, nor do what these poor-devil-poets do,
     but use words of good omen, for a great swarm of
     goddesses is in motion wit

     soc. you will no way differ from chaerephon in
     intellect.

     strep. ah me, unhappy! i shall become half-dead.

     soc. don't chatter; but quickly follow me hither with
     smartness.

     strep. then give me first into my hands a honeyed cake;
     for i am afraid of descending within, as if into the
     cave of trophonius.

     soc. proceed; why do you keep poking about the door?

     [exeunt socrates and strepsiades]

     cho. well, go in peace, for the sake of this your
     valour. may prosperity attend the man, because, being
     advanced into the vale of years, he imbues his intellect
     with modern subjects, and cultivates wisdom!

     [turning to the audience.]

     spectators, i will freely declare to you the truth, by
     bacchus, who nurtured me! so may i conquer, and be
     accounted skillful, as that, deeming you to be clever
     spectators, and this to be the cleverest of my comedies,

     will know better that he ought to spend the days of his
     life according to the moon.

     soc. by respiration, and chaos, and air, i have not seen
     any man so boorish, nor so impracticable, nor so stupid,
     nor so forgetful; who, while learning some little petty
     quibbles, forgets them before he has learned them.
     nevertheless i will certainly call him out here to the
     light. where is strepsiades? come forth with your couch.

     strep. (from within). the bugs do not permit me to bring
     it forth.

     soc. make haste and lay it down; and give me your
     attention.

     [enter strepsiades]

     strep. very well.

     soc. come now; what do you now wish to learn first of
     those things in none of which you have ever been
     instructed? tell me. about measures, or rhythms, or
     verses?

     strep. i should prefer to learn about measures; for it
     is but lately i was

     soc. ho you! what are you about? are you not meditating?

     strep. i? yea, by neptune!

     soc. and what, pray, have you thought?

     strep. whether any bit of me will be left by the bugs.

     soc. you will perish most wretchedly.

     strep. but, my good friend, i have already perished.

     soc. you must not give in, but must wrap yourself up;
     for you have to discover a device for abstracting, and a
     means of cheating.

     [walks up and down while strepsiades wraps himself up in
     the blankets.]

     strep. ah me! would, pray, some one would throw over me
     a swindling contrivance from the sheep-skins.

     soc. come now; i will first see this fellow, what he is
     about. ho you! are you asleep?

     strep. no, by apollo, i am not!

     soc. have you got anything?

     strep. no; by jupiter, certainly not!

     soc. nothing at all?

     strep. nothing, except what i have in my right hand.

     go in and wait for me a short time.

     cho. do you perceive that you are soon to obtain the
     greatest benefits through us alone of the gods? for this
     man is ready to do everything that you bid him. but you,
     while the man is astounded and evidently elated, having
     perceived it, will quickly fleece him to the best of
     your power.

     [exit socrates]

     for matters of this sort are somehow accustomed to turn
     the other way.

     [enter strepsiades and phidippides]

     strep. by mist, you certainly shall not stay here any
     longer! but go and gnaw the columns of megacles.

     phid. my good sir, what is the matter with you, o
     father? you are not in your senses, by olympian jupiter!

     strep. see, see, "olympian jupiter!" what folly! to
     think of your believing in jupiter, as old as you are!

     phid. why, pray, did you laugh at this?

     strep. reflecting that you are a child, and have
     antiquated notions. yet, h

     phid. what good could any one learn from them?

     strep. what, really? whatever wisdom there is among men.
     and you will know yourself, how ignorant and stupid you
     are. but wait for me here a short time.

     [runs off]

     phid. ah me! what shall i do, my father being crazed?
     shall i bring him into court and convict him of lunacy,
     or shall i give information of his madness to the
     coffin-makers?

     [re-enter strepsiades with a cock under one arm and a
     hen under the other]

     strep. come, let me see; what do you consider this to
     be? tell me.

     phid. alectryon.

     strep. right. and what this?

     phid. alectryon.

     strep. both the same? you are very ridiculous. do not do
     so, then, for the future; but call this alektryaina, and
     this one alektor.

     phid. alektryaina! did you learn these clever things by
     going in just now to the titans?

     strep. and many others too;

t of pomegranate-rinds, you can't think
     how cleverly. but see that he learns those two causes;
     the better, whatever it may be; and the worse, which, by
     maintaining what is unjust, overturns the better. if not
     both, at any rate the unjust one by all means.

     soc. he shall learn it himself from the two causes in
     person.

     [exit socrates]

     strep. i will take my departure. remember this now, that
     he is to be able to reply to all just arguments.

     [exit strepsiades and enter just cause and unjust cause]

     just cause. come hither! show yourself to the
     spectators, although being audacious.

     unjust cause. go whither you please; for i shall far
     rather do for you, if i speak before a crowd.

     just. you destroy me? who are you?

     unj. a cause.

     just. ay, the worse.

     unj. but i conquer you, who say that you are better than
     i.

     just. by doing what clever trick?

     unj. by discovering new contrivances.

     just.

and look which class among the audience is the
     more numerous.

     just. well now, i'm looking.

     unj. what, then, do you see?

     just. by the gods, the blackguards to be far more
     numerous. this fellow, at any rate, i know; and him
     yonder; and this fellow with the long hair.

     unj. what, then, will you say?

     just. we are conquered. ye blackguards, by the gods,
     receive my cloak, for i desert to you.

     [exeunt the two causes, and re-enter socrates and
     strepsiades.]

     soc. what then? whether do you wish to take and lead
     away this your son, or shall i teach him to speak?

     strep. teach him, and chastise him: and remember that
     you train him properly; on the one side able for petty
     suits; but train his other jaw able for the more
     important causes.

     soc. make yourself easy; you shall receive him back a
     clever sophist.

     strep. nay, rather, pale and wretched.

     olives and vines sprout, they shall be cut down; with
     such slings will we smite them. and if we see him making
     brick, we will rain; and we will smash the tiles of his
     roof with round hailstones. and if he himself, or any
     one of his kindred or friends, at any time marry, we
     will rain the whole night; so he will probably wish
     rather to have been even in egypt than to have judged
     badly.

     second; and then, of all the days i most fear, and
     dread, and abominate, immediately after this there is
     the old and new. for every one to whom i happen to be
     indebted, swears, and says he will ruin and destroy me,
     having made his deposits against me; though i only ask
     what is moderate and just-"my good sir, one part don't
     take just now; the other part put off i pr

ay; and the
     other part remit"; they say that thus they will never
     get back their money, but abuse me, as i am unjust, and
     say they will go to law with me. now therefore let them
     go to law, for it little concerns me, if phidippides has
     learned to speak well. i shall soon know by knocking at
     the thinking-shop.

     [knocks at the door.]

     boy, i say! boy, boy!

     [enter socrates]

     soc. good morning, strepsiades.

     strep. the same to you. but first accept this present;
     for one ought to compliment the teacher with a fee. and
     tell me about my son, if he has learned that cause,
     which you just now brought forward.

     soc. he has learned it.

     strep. well done, o fraud, all-powerful queen!

     soc. so that you can get clear off from whatever suit
     you please.

     strep. even if witnesses were present when i borrowed
     the money?

     soc. yea, much more! even if a thous

     phid. they seem to me to do what the forestallers do: in
     order that they may appreciate the deposits as soon as
     possible, on this account they have the first pick by
     one day.

     strep. (turning to the audience) bravo! ye wretches, why
     do you sit senseless, the gain of us wise men, being
     blocks, ciphers, mere sheep, jars heaped together,
     wherefore i must sing an encomium upon myself and this
     my son, on account of our good fortune. "o happy
     strepsiades! how wise you are yourself, and how
     excellent is the son whom you are rearing!" my friends
     and fellow-tribesmen will say of me, envying me, when
     you prove victorious in arguing causes. but first i wish
     to lead you in and entertain you.

     you to be a witness, for the sake of my own money; and
     further, in addition to this, i shall become an enemy to
     my fellow-tribesman. but never, while i live, will i
     disgrace my country, but will summon strepsiades.

     strep. (from within) who's there?

     pas. for the old and new.

     strep. i call you to witness, that he has named it for
     two days. for what matter do you summon me?

     pas. for the twelve minae, which you received when you
     were buying the dapple-gray horse.

     strep. a horse? do you not hear? i, whom you all know to
     hate horsemanship!

     pas. and, by jupiter! you swore by the gods too, that
     you would repay it.

     strep. ay, by jove! for then my phidi

     by, is ridiculous to the knowing ones.

      pas. you will assuredly suffer punishment, some time or
     other, for this. but answer and dismiss me, whether you
     are going to repay me my money or not.

     strep. keep quiet now, for i will presently answer you
     distinctly.

     [runs into the house.]

     pas. (to his summons-witness). what do you think he will
     do?

     witness. i think he will pay you.

     [re-enter strepsiades with a kneading-trough]

     strep. where is this man who asks me for his money? tell
     me what is this?

     pas. what is this? a kardopos.

     strep. and do you then ask me for your money, being such
     an ignorant person? i would not pay, not even an obolus,
     to any one who called the kardope kardopos.

     pas. then won't you pay me?

     strep. not, as far as i know. will you not then pack off
     as fast as possible from my door?

     amyn. is not this an insult, pray?

     strep. will you move quickly?

      [pricks him behind with the goad.]

     i'll lay on you, goading you behind, you outrigger? do
     you fly?

     i thought i should stir you, together with your wheels
     and your two-horse chariots.

     [exit strepsiades.]

     cho. what a thing it is to love evil courses! for this
     old man, having loved them, wishes to withhold the money
     that he borrowed. and he will certainly meet with
     something today, which will perhaps cause this sophist
     to suddenly receive some misfortune, in return for the
     knaveries he has begun. for i think that he will
     presently find what has been long boiling up, that his
     son is skilful to speak opinions opposed to justice, so
     as to overcome all
