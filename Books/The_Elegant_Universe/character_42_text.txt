  influence  objects  by  vigorously  pushing,  pulling,  or  shaking  them;  by  hurling  or
firing  other  objects  into  them;  by  stretching,  twisting,  or  crushing  them;  or  by  freezing,  heating,  or
burning them. during the past hundred years physicists have accumulated mounting evidence that all
of  these  interactions  between  various  objects  and  materials,  as  well  as  any  of  the  millions  upon
millions of others encountered daily, can be reduced to combinations of four fundamental forces. one
of these is the gravitational force. the other three are the electromagnetic force, the weak force, and
the strong force.

gravity is the most familiar of the forces, being responsible for keeping us in orbit around the
sun as well as for keeping our feet firmly planted on earth. the mass of an object measures how much
gravitational force it can exert as well as feel. the electromagnetic force is the next most familiar of
the  four.  it  is  the  force  driving  all  of  the  conveniences

multiples  of  the  proton  mass.  (the  weak  force  particles  come  in  varieties  with  the  two  possible
masses listed. theoretical studies show that the graviton should be massless.)

notwithstanding  their  common  features,  an  examination  of  the  fundamental  forces  themselves
serves only to compound the questions. why, for instance, are there four fundamental forces? why not
five or three or perhaps only one? why do the forces have such different properties? why are the
strong  and  weak  forces  confined  to  operate  on  microscopic  scales  while  gravity  and  the
electromagnetic  force  have  an  unlimited  range  of  influence? and  why  is  there  such  an  enormous
spread in the intrinsic strength of these forces?

electron  in  your  right  h

the  masses  they  do—on  which  previous  theories  are  completely  silent.  once
again, though, carrying through with such calculations requires that we know which calabi-yau space
to take for the extra dimensions.

the  preceding  discussion  gives  some  idea  of  how  string  theory  may  one  day  explain  the
properties of the matter particles recorded in table 1.1. string theorists believe that a similar story
will one day also explain the properties of the messenger particles of the fundamental forces, listed in
table 1.2. that is, as strings twist and vibrate while meandering through the extended and curled-up
dimensions, a small subset of their vast oscillatory repertoire consists of vibrations with spin equal to
1 or 2. these are the candidate force-carrying string-vibrational states. regardless of the shape of the
calabi-yau space, there is always one vibrational pattern that is massless and has spin-2; we identify
this pattern as the graviton. the precise list of spin-1 messenger parti
