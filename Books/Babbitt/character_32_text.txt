t having to shave till his spirit was moved to it. he
treasured every grease spot and fish-scale on his new khaki trousers.

all morning they fished unenergetically, or tramped the dim and
aqueous-lighted trails among rank ferns and moss sprinkled with crimson
bells. they slept all afternoon, and till midnight played stud-poker
with the guides. poker was a serious business to the guides. they did
not gossip; they shuffled the thick greasy cards with a deft ferocity
menacing to the "sports;" and joe paradise, king of guides, was
sarcastic to loiterers who halted the game even to scratch.

at midnight, as paul and he blundered to their cottage over the pungent
wet grass, and pine-roots confusing in the darkness, babbitt rejoiced
that he did not have to explain to his wife where he had been all
evening.

they did not talk much. the nervous loquacity and opinionation of the
zenith athletic club dropped from them. but when they did talk they
slipped into the naive intimacy of college days. once they dr

ied, "god bless
you, baby!" from the train he waved to her till she was but a scarlet
spot beside the brown bulkier presence of mrs. babbitt, at the end of a
steel and cement aisle ending in vast barred gates. with melancholy he
looked back at the last suburb of zenith.

all the way north he pictured the maine guides: simple and strong and
daring, jolly as they played stud-poker in their unceiled shack, wise
in woodcraft as they tramped the forest and shot the rapids. he
particularly remembered joe paradise, half yankee, half indian. if he
could but take up a backwoods claim with a man like joe, work hard with
his hands, be free and noisy in a flannel shirt, and never come back to
this dull decency!

or, like a trapper in a northern canada movie, plunge through the
forest, make camp in the rockies, a grim and wordless caveman! why not?
he could do it! there'd be enough money at home for the family to live
on till verona was married and ted self-supporting. old henry t. would
look out for them. hon

tly! why not? really live--

he longed for it, admitted that he longed for it, then almost believed
that he was going lo do it. whenever common sense snorted, "nonsense!
folks don't run away from decent families and partners; just simply
don't do it, that's all!" then babbitt answered pleadingly, "well, it
wouldn't take any more nerve than for paul to go to jail and--lord,
how i'd' like to do it! moccasins-six-gun-frontier town-gamblers--sleep
under the stars--be a regular man, with he-men like joe paradise--gosh!"

so he came to maine, again stood on the wharf before the camp-hotel,
again spat heroically into the delicate and shivering water, while the
pines rustled, the mountains glowed, and a trout leaped and fell in a
sliding circle. he hurried to the guides' shack as to his real home,
his real friends, long missed. they would be glad to see him. they would
stand up and shout? "why, here's mr. babbitt! he ain't one of these
ordinary sports! he's a real guy!"

greasy table playing stud-poker with greasy cards: half a dozen wrinkled
men in old trousers and easy old felt hats. they glanced up and nodded.

silence, except for the clatter of chips.

babbitt stood beside them, very lonely. he hinted, after a period of
highly concentrated playing, "guess i might take a hand, joe."

"sure. sit in. how many chips you want? let's see; you were here with
your wife, last year, wa'n't you?" said joe paradise.

that was all of babbitt's welcome to the old home.

he played for half an hour before he spoke again. his head was reeking

things he did to me, and i hope he dies in prison!"

babbitt was up, hat in hand, growling, "well, if that's what you call
being at peace, for heaven's sake just warn me before you go to war,
will you?"

vast is the power of cities to reclaim the wanderer. more than mountains
or the shore-devouring sea, a city retains its character, imperturbable,
cynical, holding behind apparent changes its essential purpose. though
babbitt had deserted his family and dwelt with joe paradise in the
wilderness, though he had become a liberal, though he had been quite
sure, on the night before he reached zenith, that neither he nor the
city would be the same again, ten days after his return he could not
believe that he had ever been away. nor was it at all evident to his
acquaintances that there was a new george f. babbitt, save that he was
more irritable under the incessant chaffing at the athletic club, and
once, when vergil gunch observed that seneca doane ought to be hanged,
