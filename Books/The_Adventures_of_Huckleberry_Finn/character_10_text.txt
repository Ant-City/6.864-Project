scene:  the mississippi valley time:  forty to fifty years ago




chapter i.

you don’t know about me without you have read a book by the name of the
adventures of tom sawyer; but that ain’t no matter.  that book was made
by mr. mark twain, and he told the truth, mainly.  there was things
which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.  that is nothing.  i
never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was aunt
polly, or the widow, or maybe mary.  aunt polly--tom’s aunt polly, she
is--and mary, and the widow douglas is all told about in that book, which
is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as i said before.

now the way that the book winds up is this:  tom and me found the money
that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich.  we got six
thousand dollars apiece--all gold.  it was an awful sight of money when
it was piled up.  well, judge thatcher he took it and put it out
at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the

se she would come in
close, where the bread did.  when she’d got pretty well along down
towards me, i put out my pipe and went to where i fished out the bread,
and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place.  where
the log forked i could peep through.

by and by she come along, and she drifted in so close that they could

 pap, and judge thatcher, and bessie thatcher, and jo harper, and tom
sawyer, and his old aunt polly, and sid and mary, and plenty more.
 everybody was talking about the murder, but the captain broke in and
says:

“look sharp, now; the current sets in the closest here, and maybe he’s
washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water’s edge.  i
hope so, anyway.”

i didn’t hope so.  they all crowded up and leaned over the rails, nearly
in my face, and kept still, watching with all their might.  i could see
them first-rate, but they couldn’t see me.  then the captain sung o

if somebody don’t go, _i’ll_
go. i’ve knowed him all his life, and so has tom, there.  old miss
watson died two months ago, and she was ashamed she ever was going to
sell him down the river, and _said_ so; and she set him free in her
will.”

“then what on earth did _you_ want to set him free for, seeing he was
already free?”

“well, that _is_ a question, i must say; and just like women!  why,
i wanted the _adventure_ of it; and i’d a waded neck-deep in blood
to--goodness alive, _aunt polly!_”

if she warn’t standing right there, just inside the door, looking as
sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie, i wish i may never!

aunt sally jumped for her, and most hugged the head off of her, and
cried over her, and i found a good enough place for me under the bed,
for it was getting pretty sultry for us, seemed to me.  and i peeped
out, and in a little while tom’s aunt polly shook herself loose and
stood there looking across at tom over her spectacles--kind of grinding

bed, huck finn.”

so i done it.  but not feeling brash.

aunt sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons i ever
see--except one, and that was uncle silas, when he come in and they told
it all to him.  it kind of made him drunk, as you may say, and he didn’t
know nothing at all the rest of the day, and preached a prayer-meeting
sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation, because the
oldest man in the world couldn’t a understood it.  so tom’s aunt polly,
she told all about who i was, and what; and i had to up and tell how
i was in such a tight place that when mrs. phelps took me for tom
sawyer--she chipped in and says, “oh, go on and call me aunt sally, i’m
used to it now, and ‘tain’t no need to change”--that when aunt sally took
me for tom sawyer i had to stand it--there warn’t no other way, and
i knowed he wouldn’t mind, because it would be nuts for him, being
a mystery, and he’d make an adventure out of it, and be perfectly

satisfied.  and so it turned out, and he let on to be sid, and made
things as soft as he could for me.

and his aunt polly she said tom was right about old miss watson setting
jim free in her will; and so, sure enough, tom sawyer had gone and took
all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free! and i couldn’t
ever understand before, until that minute and that talk, how he _could_
help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up.

well, aunt polly she said that when aunt sally wrote to her that tom and
_sid_ had come all right and safe, she says to herself:

“look at that, now!  i might have expected it, letting him go off that
way without anybody to watch him.  so now i got to go and trapse all
the way down the river, eleven hundred mile, and find out what that
creetur’s up to _this_ time, as long as i couldn’t seem to get any
answer out of you about it.”

“why, i never heard nothing from you,” says aunt sally.

“well, i w

onder!  why, i wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean
by sid being here.”

“well, i never got ‘em, sis.”

aunt polly she turns around slow and severe, and says:

“you, tom!”

“well--_what_?” he says, kind of pettish.

“don’t you what _me_, you impudent thing--hand out them letters.”

“what letters?”

“_them_ letters.  i be bound, if i have to take a-holt of you i’ll--”

“they’re in the trunk.  there, now.  and they’re just the same as they
was when i got them out of the office.  i hain’t looked into them, i
hain’t touched them.  but i knowed they’d make trouble, and i thoug

run him down the river on the raft, and
have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river, and then tell him about
his being free, and take him back up home on a steamboat, in style,
and pay him for his lost time, and write word ahead and get out all
the niggers around, and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight
procession and a brass-band, and then he would be a hero, and so would
we.  but i reckoned it was about as well the way it was.

we had jim out of the chains in no time, and when aunt polly and uncle
silas and aunt sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse tom,
they made a heap of fuss over him, and fixed him up prime, and give him
all he wanted to eat, and a good time, and nothing to do.  and we had
him up to the sick-room, and had a high talk; and tom give jim forty
dollars for being prisoner for us so patient, and doing it up so good,
and jim was pleased most to death, and busted out, and says:

“dah, now, huck, what i tell you?--what i tell you up dah on jackson
