there  was  a  squeal  and  a  beating  of
wings.  i  heard  the  tinkle  of  a  bell  in  the
distance ahead. i knew it was daisy, our
milk cow. i’d have to start her on the way

home.

i took the magazine from my pocket and
again i read the ad. slowly a plan began to
form. i’d save the money. i could sell stuff
to the fishermen: crawfish, minnows, and
fresh vegetables. in berry season, i could
sell  all  the  berries  i  could  pick  at  my
grandfather’s  store.  i  could  trap  in  the
winter. the more i planned, the more real
it became. there was the way to get those
pups—save my money.

i  could  almost  feel  the  pups  in  my
hands.  i  planned  the  little  doghouse,  and
where  to  put  it.  collars  i  could  make
myself.  then  the  thought  came,  “what
could  i  name  them?”  i  tried  name  after
name,  voicing
loud.  none
seemed to fit. well, there would be plenty
of time for names.

way  down  through  our  fields,  i  caught
crawfish  with  my  bare  hands.  i  trapped
minnows  with  an  old  screen-wire  trap  i
made  myself,  baited  with  yellow  corn
bread  from  my  mother’s  kitchen.  these
were  sold  to  the  fishermen,  along  with

fresh  vegetables  and  roasting  ears.  i  tore
my  way  through  the  blackberry  patches
until  my  hands  and  feet  were  scratched
raw and red from the thorns. i tramped the
hills  seeking  out  the  huckleberry  bushes.
my grandfather paid me ten cents a bucket
for my berries.

once  grandpa  asked  me  what  i  did
with the money i earned. i told him i was
saving it to buy some hunting dogs. i asked
him if he would order them for me when i
had  saved  enough.  he  said  he  would.  i
asked him not to say anything to my father.
he  promised  me  he  wouldn’t.  i’m  sure

i knew he had surely helped,
for  he  had  given  me  the  heart,  courage,
and determination.

early  the  next  morning,  with  the  can
jammed deep in the pocket of my overalls,
i  flew  to  the  store.  as  i  trotted  along,  i
whistled  and  sang.  i  felt  as  big  as  the
tallest mountain in the ozarks.

arriving  at  my  destination,  i  saw  two
wagons were tied up at the hitching rack. i
knew some farmers had come to the store,
so i waited until they left. as i walked in,
i  saw  my  grandfather  behind  the  counter.
tugging and pulling, i worked the can out

of my pocket and dumped it out in front of
him and looked up.

grandpa was dumbfounded. he tried to
say  something,  but  it  wouldn’t  come  out.
he looked at me, and he looked at the pile
of coins. finally, in a voice much louder
than he ordinarily used, he asked, “where
did you get all this?”

“i  told  you,  grandpa,”  i  said,  “i  was
saving  my  money  so  i  could  buy  two
hound  pups,  and  i  did.  you  sa

money and now i want you to order them.”
grandpa stared at me over his glasses,

and then back at the money.

“how long have you been saving this?”

he asked.

“a long time, grandpa,” i said.
“how long?” he asked.

i told him, “two years.”
his  mouth  flew  open  and  in  a  loud

voice he said, “two years!”

i nodded my head.
the  way  my  grandfather  stared  at  me
made  me  uneasy.  i  was  on  needles  and
pins. taking his eyes from me, he glanced
back  at  the  money.  he  saw  the  faded
yellow  piece  of  paper  sticking  out  from
the coins. he worked it out, asking as he
did, “what’s this?”

i told him it was the ad, telling where to

laying a friendly old work-calloused hand
on  my  head,  he  changed  the  conversation
altogether,  saying,  “son,  you  need  a
haircut.”

i told him i didn’t mind. i didn’t like my
hair  short;  flies  and  mosquitoes  bothered
me.

he  glanced  down  at  my  bare  feet  and
asked,  “how  come  your  feet  are  cut  and
scratched like that?”

i  told  him  it  was  pretty  tough  picking

blackberries barefoot.
he nodded his head.
it was too much for my grandfather. he
turned and walked away. i saw the glasses
come  off,  and  the  old  red  handkerchief
come  out.  i  heard  the  good  excuse  of
blowing  his  nose.  he  stood  for  several
seconds  with  his  back  toward  me.  when
he turned around, i noticed his eyes were
moist.

he  walked  over  and  picked  up  the  ad

i nodded.
“well,” he said, “the first thing we have
to  do  is  write  this  outfit.  there  may  not
even be a place like this in kentucky any
more. after all, a lot of things can happen
in two years.”

seeing  that  i  was  worried,  he  said,
“now you go on home. i’ll write to these
kennels  and  i’ll  let  you  know  when  i  get
an answer. if we can’t get the dogs there,
we  can  get

i  told  him  i  wouldn’t,  and  turned  to

leave the store.

as  i  reached  the  door,  my  grandfather

said in a loud voice, “say, it’s been a long
time  since  you’ve  had  any  candy,  hasn’t
it?”

i nodded my head.
he asked, “how long?”
i told him, “a long time.”
“well,”  he  said,  “we’ll  have  to  do

something about that.”

walking  over  behind  the  counter,  he
reached  out  and  got  a  sack.  i  noticed  it
wasn’t one of the nickel sacks. it was one
of the quarter kind.

my  eyes  never  left  my  grandfather’s

mail  buggy  wait  while  he  made  out  the
order. and, another thing, the dog market
had gone downhill. the price of dogs had

dropped five dollars. he handed me a ten-
dollar bill.

“now,  there’s  still  one  stump  in  the
way,”  he  said.  “the  mail  buggy  can’t
carry things like dogs, so they’ll come as
far  as  the  depot  at  tahlequah,  but  you’ll
get the notice here because i ordered them
in your name.”

i  thanked  my  grandfather  with  all  my
heart and asked him how long i’d have to
wait for the notice.

he said, “i don’t know, but it shouldn’t

take more than a couple of weeks.”

i asked how i was going to get my dogs

out from tahlequah.

“well,  there’s  always  someone  going
in,” he said, “and you could ride in with
them.”

that  evening  the  silence  of  our  supper

was  interrupted  when  i  asked  my  father
this  question:  “papa,  how  far  is  it  to

time  they  had  a  cutting. and  i  just  heard
some fellows talking about kentucky up at
the  store,  and  wondered  how  far  away  it
was. much to my relief, the conversation
was ended.

the  days  dragged  by.  a  week  passed
and still no word about my dogs. terrible
thoughts ran through my mind. maybe my
dogs  were  lost;  the  train  had  a  wreck;
someone  stole  my  money;  or  perhaps  the

mailman lost my order. then, at the end of
the second week, the notice came.

my  grandfather  told  me  that  he  had
talked  to  jim  hodges  that  day.  he  was
going  into  town  in  about  a  week  and  i
could ride in with him to pick up my dogs.
again i thanked my grandfather.

i  started  for  home.  walking  along  in
deep thought, i decided it was time to tell
my father the whole story. i fully intended
to  tell  him  that  evening.  i  tried  several
times,  but  somehow  i  couldn’t.  i  wasn’t
scared of him, for he never whipped me.

the  stories  i  had  heard  about  marshals
weren’t  true.  never  again  would  i  be
scared when i saw one.

back  out  on  the  street,  i  shook  hands
with  the  marshal,  saying  as  i  did,  “if
you’re  ever  up  in  my  part  of  the  country
come over and see me. you can find our

in desperation i went to my grandfather.
he  smiled  as  he  listened  to  my  tale  of
woe.  “well,  we’ll  have  to  do  something

about that,” he said. “to train those dogs
right, you’ll need that coon hide, that’s for
sure. now you watch the store while i go
over to my tool shed. i’ll be right back.”

after  what  seemed  like  an  eternity  i
saw him coming. he was carrying a brace

i nodded my head.
“now,”  he  said,  “you  go  down  along

bore a hole down about six inches. drop
one of the bright pieces of tin down in the
hole,  and  be  sure  it’s  laying  right  on  the
bottom.”

i was all ears. i didn’t want to miss one
word my grandfather said. now and then i
would  glance  at  him  to  see  if  he  was
kidding me.

in  a  serious  voice,  he  went  on  talking.

and the sharp slanting points of the nails. i
could  see  the  coon  reaching  in  for  the
shiny  piece  of  metal.  naturally  his  paw
would be much larger when closed than it
was  when  he  reached  in.  it  would  be
impossible for it to pass the sharp nails.

it was all looking pretty good to me and
i was on the point of saying so, when it hit

me. why, all the coon had to do was open
his paw, drop the object, and he was free.
it all blew up then and there. i just knew
my grandfather was playing a joke on me.
i  stepped  back  and  almost  cried  as  i
said,  “grandpa,  you’re  kidding  me.  that
kind of a trap couldn’t catch a coon. why
all he’d have to do is open his paw, drop
the piece of tin, and he could pull it from
the hole.”

grandpa  started  roaring  with  laughter.
this did make me feel bad. with tears in
my eyes, i started for the door.

“wait  a  minute,”  grandpa  said.  “i’m
not kidding you. oh, i know i like to have
my  jokes,  same  as  an

with  my  confidence  restored,  it  all
sounded  pretty  good  to  me  and  i  was
anxious  to  try  out  this  wonderful  plan.  i
thanked  him  and,  taking  the  brace  and
nails, i left the store.

by the time i reached home it was too
late  in  the  day  to  start  making  my  traps.
that  night  i  talked  the  idea  over  with
papa.

“i’ve  heard  of  coons  being  caught  that
way,”  he  said,  “but  i  never  paid  much
attention  to  it.  your  grandfather  should
know,  though,  for  he  was  quite  a  coon
hunter when he was a boy.”

“from  what  he  told  me,”  i  said,  “it

papa  asked  if  i  wanted  him  to  help

“no,”  i  said,  “i  think  i  can  do  it

myself.”

i  didn’t  sleep  too  well  that  night.  i
bored holes, drove nails, and fought coons
practically all night.

early  the  next  morning  i  went  to  the

trash pile. as i stirred around in the rusty
old  cans,  i  thought

paw  from  the  trap.  he  couldn’t  do  it.
taking a pair of pliers from his pocket, he
said, “it’s a good thing i had these along
or we would have had to cut his foot off.”
after  papa  had  pulled  the  nails,  he
lifted  the  coon’s  paw  from  the  hole.
there, clamped firmly in it, was the bright
piece of tin.

in a low voice papa said, “well, i’ll be
darned. all  he  had  to  do  was  open  it  up

and  he  was  free,  but  he  wouldn’t  do  it.
your grandfather was right.”

a  sorrowful  look  came  over  papa’s
face as he ran his fingers through the soft,
yellow hair. “billy,” he said, “i want you
to  take  a  hammer  and  pull  the  nails  from
every one of those traps. it’s summertime
now and their fur isn’t any good. besides,
i  don’t  think  this  is  very  sportsmanlike.

hunting, i’d hang around my grandfather’s

coon  hunters.  some  of  the  tales  i  heard
were long and tall, but i believed them all.
i could always tell when grandpa was
kidding me by the twinkle in his eyes. he
told me how a coon could climb right up

he  could  leap  on  a  horse’s  back  and  run
him  over  your  dogs.  i  didn’t  care,  for  i

the fame of my dogs spread all over our part

country.  no  coon  hunter  came  into  my
grandfather’s store with as many pelts as i
did.  grandpa  never  overlooked  an

but now you listen. if you boys take him up
there to hunt the ghost coon, and jump on
him and beat him up, you’re sure going to

saw  he  had  pushed  my
grandfather  far  enough.  backing  up  a

bills,  saying  to  rubin,  “you  hold  your

you  had  better  pay  off.”  looking  back  to

we crossed an old field and entered the
river  bottoms.  by  this  time  it  was  quite
dark. i lit my lantern and asked which one
wanted to carry my ax.

“it’s  yours,”  rainie  said.  “you  carry

not wanting to argue, i carried both the

lantern and the ax.

rainie started telling me how stingy and
crooked my grandfather was. i told him i
hadn’t  come  to  have  any  trouble  or  to
fight. all  i  wanted  to  do  was  to  hunt  the
ghost  coon.  if  there  was  going  to  be  any
trouble, i would just call my dogs and go
home.

rubin had a nickel’s worth of sense, but
rainie had none at all. rubin told him if
he didn’t shut up, he was going to bloody
his nose. that shut rainie up.

his voice rolled in the silent night.

i looked into his mean eyes. i started to

before you get whipped.”

in  a  loud  voice,  rainie  said,  “bloody

i

i was scared. i couldn’t whip rubin. he
was  too  big  for  me.  i  started  to  turn  and
leave  when
thought  of  what  my
grandfather had told them.

“you  had  better  remember  what  my
grandpa said,” i reminded them. “he’ll do
just what he said he would.”

rubin didn’t hit me. he just grabbed me
and with his brute strength threw me down
on the ground. he had me on my back with
my arms outspread. he had a knee on each

arm. i made no effort to fight back. i was
scared.

on. everything that had happened
on  this  terrible  night  was  because  of  his
very existence, but it wasn’t his fault.

i also knew he was a silent witness to
the horrible scene. behind me lay the still
body  of  a  young  boy.  on  my  left  a  blue
tick  hound  lay  torn  and  bleeding.  even
after all that had happened, i could feel no
hatred  for  the  ghost  coon  and  was  not
sorry i had let him live.

again.

arriving  home,  i  awakened  my  mother
and  father.  starting  at  my  grandfather’s
mill, i told everything that had happened. i

left  nothing  out.  my  mother  had  started
crying  long  before  i  had  completed  my
story.  papa  said  nothing,  just  sat  and
listened.  when  i  had  finished,  he  kept
staring down at the floor in deep thought. i
could hear the sobbing of my mother in the
silence. i walked over to her. she put her
arms around me and said, “my poor little
boy.”

looking at me, he said, “you go across

the  only  man  in  the  country  that  has

bufords, too. tell them to meet us at your
grandfather’s place.”

i hurried to carry the sad message.
the  following  day  was  a  nasty  one. a
slow,  cold  drizzle  had  set  in.  feeling
trapped indoors, i prowled from room to
room. i couldn’t understand why my father
hadn’t  come  back  from  the  pritchards’.  i
sat by the window and watched the road.

understanding my feelings, mama said,
“billy,  i  wouldn’t  worry.  he’ll  be  back
before  long.  it  takes  time  for  things  like
that.”

“i know,” i said, “but you w

all the way home my dogs kept running
out in front of me. they would stop, turn
around, and look at me. i had to smile, for
i  knew  what  they  wanted.  i  stopped  and
petted  them  a  little  and  told  them  that  as
soon as i got home and had my supper, we
would go hunting.

a  few  days  later,  on  his  way  back  from  the
mill,  one  of  the  hatfield  boys  stopped  at
our  place.  he  told  me  my  grandfather
wanted  to  see  me.  it  was  unusual  for
grandpa  to  send  for  me  and  it  had  me
worried. i figured that he wanted to talk to
me  about  the  death  of  rubin  pritchard.  i
always enjoyed talking to my grandpa but
i didn’t want to talk about rubin’s death.
every  time  i  thought  of  him,  i  lived  the
horrible tragedy all over again.

after  a  practically  sleepless  night,  the
next morning i started for the store. i was
walking along deep in thought when little
ann zipped by

scars,  caused  from  the  many  fights  with
tough  old  coons  and  bobcats.  i  held  his
head  in  my  hands  and  felt  sorry  for  him,
but loved him that much more.

i  looked  little  ann  over  and  couldn’t
see  any  scars.  i  laughed  because  i  knew

why. she was too smart to walk right up in
the  face  of  a  fight.  she  would  wait  until
old dan took hold and then dart in.

i  untied  her  rope  and  walked  her  over

to our tent.

my  father  and  grandfather  were  gone.
no  doubt  they  were  over  in  some  tent
visiting old friends and making new ones.
looking  around  to  find  something  i
could  use  to  groom  my  dog,  i  saw
grandpa’s  open  suitcase.  there,  right  on
top,  was  the  very  thing  i  needed,  his
beautiful  bone-handled  hairbrush  and  his
ivory  comb.  picking  them  up,  i  turned
them over and over in my hand.

looking  at  me.

my face, i went off to bed.

the next morning two blue tick hounds,
from  the  smoky  mountains  of  tennessee,
came out in the lead with three big coons
to  their  credit.  the  other  four  sets  were
eliminated.

the  following  morning  all  five  sets  of
dogs were eliminated. none had even tied
the blue ticks, although two sets had gotten
two  coons,  and  one  of  these  had  treed  a
third one in a bluff.

that  day,  while  eating  dinner,  my
grandfather asked me if my dogs had ever
treed three coons in one night.

i  said,  “yes,  four  different  times,  but

our night?” papa asked.

i told him if we could get our judge to
go  with  us  in  the  buggy,  we  would  be
better  off  if  we  could  go  far  downriver
and get out of the range where other dogs
had hunted.

he said, “that’s a good idea. i’ll go to

see the judges about it.”

the third night, the blue ticks were tied
by  two  black  and  tan  hounds  from  the
bayou country of louisiana.

grandpa  was  hopping  around  like  a
grasshopper,  going  here  and  there.  once,
passing a tent, i heard his voice. i knew he
was  bragging  about  my  dogs.  i  smiled  to
myself.

another  hunter  stopped  me  and  asked,
“is it true that your hounds have treed six
coons in one night, three up in one tree, or
is that old man just blowing off steam?”

i  told  him  my  grandfather  had  a  little
steam, but he was the best grandpa a boy
ever had.

he  patted  me  on  the  head,  turned,  and

walked away laughing.

in  the  afternoon  our  judge  came  over  and
introduced  himself.  he  told  us  he’d  be
going with us that night.

about  sundown  we  piled  in  our  buggy
and  drove  a  few  miles  downriver.  i
noticed other hunters doing the same thing.
everyone was trying to get away from the
already-hunted territory.

driven sleet stung our skin like thousands
of pricking needles. strong gusts of wind
growled  and  moaned  through  the  tops  of
the tall timber.

once  during  a  momentary  lull  of  the
storm,  i  thought  i  heard  the  baying  of  a
hound.  i  told  my  father  i  thought  i  had
heard old dan.

“from which direction?” he asked.

we’ll freeze to death. it doesn’t look like
this blizzard is ever going to let up.”

i  could  hear  the  roar  of  the  blizzard
back  in  the  thick  timber  of  the  bottoms.
two large limbs being rubbed together by
the strong wind made a grinding creaking
sound.  the  tall  slender  cane  around  us
rattled and swayed.

i  could  feel  the  silence  closing  in.  i
knew  the  judge’s  cold  logic  had  had  its
effect  on  my  father  and  grandfather.  the
men had given up. there was no hope left
for me.

kneeling  down,  i  put  my  arms  around
little ann.  i  felt  the  warm  heat  from  her
moist tongue caressing my ear. closing my
eyes, i said, “please, dan, bawl one more
time, just one more time.”

i waited for my plea to be answered.

with  its  loud  roaring,  the  north  wind
seemed  to  be  laughing  at  us. all  around,
tall  stalks  of  cane  were  weaving  and
dancing  to  the  rattling  rhythm  of  their
knife-edged blade

ran  over  to  the  tree,  reared  up  on  it,  and
started bawling.

hearing  shouting  from  the  bank  above
me,  i  looked  up.  i  could  dimly  see  papa
and the judge through the driving sleet. at
first  i  thought  they  were  shouting  to  me,
but on peering closer i could see that they

had  their  backs  to  me.  catching  hold  of
some long stalks of cane that were hanging
down from the steep bank, i pulled myself
up.

papa shouted in my ear, “something has

happened to your grandfather.”

turning to the judge, he said, “he was
behind  you.  when  was  the  last  time  you
saw him?”

“i don’t know for sure,” the judge said.
“i guess it was back there when we heard
the hound bawl.”

“didn’t  you  hear  anything?”  papa

asked.

“hear  anything?”  the  judge  exclaimed.
“how  could  i  hear  anything  in  all  that
noise? i thought he was behind me all the

disappeared  quickly  in  the  thick  cane.
minutes later we heard her. it was a long,
mournful cry.

papa lifted him to a sitting position and
told  the  judge  to  start  slapping  his  face.
grandpa moaned and moved his head.
“he’s coming around,” papa said.
i asked papa if we could get him back
to  the  gully  where  old  dan  was.  i  had
noticed  there  was  very  little  wind  there
and we could build a fire.

anyone,  but  these  dogs  are  different.  did
you know they won’t hunt with anyone but

hearing my grandfather call my name, i

putting his arm around me, he said, “now,
i  wouldn’t  worry  about

closed  on  the  back  of  the  coon’s  neck.  i
knew the fight was over.

arriving back at camp, i saw that all the
tents  had  been  taken  down  but  ours.  a
hunter  said,  “everyone  was  in  a  hurry  to
get out before another blizzard sets in.”

papa  told  me  to  take  my  dogs  into  the

tent as grandpa wanted to see them.

i saw tears in my grandfather’s eyes as
he talked to them. his ankle was wrapped
in  bandages.  his  foot  and  toes  were
swollen  to  twice  their  normal  size.  they
had
turned  a  greenish-yellow  color.
placing my hand on his foot, i could feel
the feverish heat.

dr. lathman came over. “are you ready

to go now?” he asked.

snorting and growling, grandpa said, “i
told you i wasn’t going anywhere till i see
the gold cup handed to this boy.”

turning to face the crowd, dr. lathman

down in the gleaming shadows i could see
two  wide  blue  eyes  glued
to  a
windowpane.  i  knew  that  my  little  sister
was watching the road and waiting for our
return.  looking  back  at  the  judge,  i  said,
“if you don’t mind, i’ll take it with me. my

i went over and kissed grandpa good-

laughing,  he  said,  “that’s  all  right.”
handing me a slip of paper, he said, “this
is the address where you should send it.”
