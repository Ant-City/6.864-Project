[CHARACTER]

although [CHARACTER] is kinder to the old man than the other villagers, he is certainly no paragon of compassion and charity. he doesn't club the old man as the neighbor woman suggests, but he does pen the supposed angel in his chicken coop and charge admission to the crowds of curious sightseers. [CHARACTER] is primarily concerned with his family and sick child and is content to leave the theoretical and theological speculations to father gonzaga. his decision to shelter the old man and take some responsibility for him, however, suggests that he isn't as cold or heartless as he might seem. by allowing the old man to stay, [CHARACTER] also invites mystery, wonder, and magic into his life.
