Bezu Fache  - 
                The
captain of the French Judicial Police. Nicknamed "the Bull," Fache
is strong, strong-willed, and religious. He has great faith in the
use of technology in his work, which sometimes leads him down the
wrong road. Fache's policing methods are a bit unorthodox, but he
is good at heart. The name Fache is very similar to fache,
which is French for "angry."
