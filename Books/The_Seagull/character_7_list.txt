Ilya Afanasyevich Shamrayev - 
      Shamrayev is father to Masha and husband to Paulina. He acts as the manager of Sorin's farm and household year round. Shamrayev adores Arkadina's fame and fortune and close ties to Russian artists. He flatters her and attentively listens to her boasts and the details of her life in the theatre. But when it comes to the horses and running the farm, Shamrayev is argumentative about his control. He is cruel and unsympathetic to his daughter's admirer and later, husband, Medvedenko, and unattentive and embarrsassing to his wife, Paulina.
