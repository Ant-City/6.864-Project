CYEANO DE BEKGESACc ' • 



ACT FIRST. 

A PLAY AT THE HOTEL DE BOURGOGNE. 

The great hall of the Hotel de Bourgogne^ 
in I640. A sort of tenriis-court arranged 
and decorated for theatrical performances. 

The hall is a long rectangle, seen o&- 
liquely, so that one side of it constitutes the 
background, tvhich runs from the position 
of the front wing at the right, to the line of 
the furthest wing at the left, and forms an 
angle with the stage, tvhich is equally seen 
obliquely. 

This stage is furnished, on both sides^ 
along the wings, ivith benches. The drop- 
curtain is composed of two tapestry hang- 
ings, which can be drawn apart. Above 
a Harlequin cloak, the royal escutcheon. 
Broad steps lead from the raised platform 
of the stage into the hou^e. On either side 
of these steps, the m^isicians^ seats. A row 
of candles fills the office of footlights. 

Two galleries run along the side; th6 

3 



Cyrano de Bergerac.^ 

lo'ji3r one is divided into boxes. No seats ini 
the pit, which is the stage proper. At the 
oacJc of the pit, that is to say^ at the right ^ 
in the front, a few seats raised like steps, 
one above the other ; and, under a stairway 
which leads to the upper seats, and of ivhich 
the lower end only is visible, a stand decked 
with small candelabra, jars fidl offloivers^ 
flagons and glasses, dishes heaped ivith 
sweetmeats, etc. 

In the centre of the background, under 
the box-tier, the entrance to the theatre., 
large door which half opens to let in the 
spectators. On the panels of this door, 
and in several corners, and above the sweet" 
meat stand, red playbills announcing La 
Clorise. 

At the rise of the curtain, the house ia 
nearly dark, and still empty. The chafide* 
Hers are let down in the middle of the pit, 
until time to light them. 

The audience, arriving gradually. Cav* 
alters, burghers, lackeys, pages, the fiddlers^ 
etc. 

A tumult of voices is heard beyond thi 
door ; enter brusquely a Cavalier.

Citronade . . • 

{The fiddles begin playing.) 

Christian. I fear . . . oh, I fear to 
tind that she is fanciful and intricate ! I 
dare not speak to her, for 1 am of a simple 
wit. The language written and spoken in 
these days bewilders and baffles me. I am 
a plain soldier . . . shy, to boot. — She is 
always at the right, there, the end: the 
empty box. 

Ligniere {ivith show of leaving). I am 
going. 

Christian {still attempting to detain 
him). Oh, no ! . . . Stay, 1 beseech you I 

Ligniere, I cannot. D'Assoucy is ex»

trance of a little, merry-faced^ roly-pol^ 
man.) 

Audience. Ah, Ragueneau ! . . . 

LlGNIERE {to Christian). Ragueneau, 
who keeps the great cook-shop. 

Ragueneau {attired like a pastrycook in 
his Sunday best, coming quickly toward 
LlGNIERE). Monsieur, have you seen Mon- 
sieur de Cyrano ? 

LlGNIERE {presenting Ragueneau to 
Christian). The pastrycook of poets and 
of players I 

Ragueneau {abashed). Too much hon- 
or. .. .

Ragueneau. . . . let. A tart-let. 

LiGNiERE. Kind soul, he tries to cheapen 
his charitable acts I And for a triolet were 
you not known to give . . . ? 

Ragueneau. Rolls. Just rolls. 

LiGNiERE {severely). Buttered ! » . . 
And the play, you are fond of the play ? 

Ragueneau. It is with me a passion I 

LiGNiERE. And you settle for your en- 
trance fee with a pastry currencyo Come 
now, among ourselves, what did you have 
to give to-day for admittance here ? 

Ragueneau. Four custards . . . o eigh- 
teen lady "fingers. {He looks all around). 
Monsieur de Cyrano is not here^ I wonder 
At it. 

Ligniere. And why ? 

RagueneaUo Montfleury is billed to 
play. 

Ligniere. So it is, indeed. That ton of 
man will to-day entrance us in the part of 
Phoedo . . . Phoedo ! . . . But what ia 
khat to Cyrano ? 

Ragueneau. Have you not heard ? Ha 
kiterdicted Montfleury, whom he has taken

in aversion, from appearing for one montli 
upon the stage. 

LiGNiERE (who is at his fourth glass) * 
WelH 

Ragueneau. Montfleury is billed to 
play. 

CuiGY {who has drawn near with his cwu' 
panions). He cannot be prevented. 

RagueneaUo He cannot ? . « . Well, I 
am here to see ! 

First Marquis. What is this Cyrano ? 

CuiGY. A crack-brain ! 

Second Marquis. Of quality ? 

CuiGY. Enough for daily uses. He is 
a cadet in the Guards. (Pointing out a 
gentleman who is coming and going about 
the pit^ as if in search of somebody). But 
his friend Le Bret can tell you. (Calling), 
he Bret ! . . c (Le Bret comes toward 
them). You are looking for Bergerac ? 

Le Bret. Yes. I am uneasy. 

CuiGY. Is it not a fact that he is a most 
uncommon fellow ? 

Le Bret (affectionately). The most ex- 
quisite being he is that walks beneath th« 
moon ! 

« 

RA.GUENEAU. Poet ! 

CuiGY. Swordsman I 
Brissaille. Physicist I 
i6 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. Musician I 

LiGNiERE. And what an extraordinary 
aspect he presents ! 

Ragueneau. I will not go so far as to 
say that I believe our grave Philippe de 
Champaigne will leave us a portrait of 
him ; but, the bizarre, excessive, whimsi- 
cal fellow that he is would certainly have 
furnished the late Jacques Callot with a 
type of madcap fighter for one of his 
masques. Hat with triple feather, doublet 
with twice-triple skirt, cloak which his in- 
terminable rapier lifts up behind, with 
pomp, like the insolent tail of a cock ; 
prouder than all the Artabans that Gascony 
ever bred, he goes about in his stiff Punchi- 
nello ruff, airing a nose. . . . Ah, gentle- 
men, what a nose is that ! One cannot 
look upon such a specimen of the nasigera 
without exclaiming, "No I truly, the man 
exaggerates," . . . After that, one smiles, 
one says : " He will take it off." . . . But 
Monsieur de Bergerac never takes it off at 
all. 

Le Bret {shaking his head). He wears 
it always . . . and cuts down whoever 
breathes a syllable in comment. 

Ra gueneau {proudly) . His blade is hall 
the shears of Fate I

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

First Marquis {shrugging his shoulders). 
He will not come ! 

Eagueneau. He will. I wager you a 
chicken a la Ragueneau. 

First Marquis (laughing). Very well ! 

{Murmur of admiration in the house, 
RoxANE has appeared in her box. She 
takes a seat in thefy^ont, her duenna at the 
back. Christian,^ engaged in paying th9 
sweetmeat vender, does not look.) 

Second Marquis {uttering a series of 
S7nall squeals). Ah, gentlemen, she is hor. 
rifically enticing ! 

First Marquis. A strawberry set in \ 
peach, and smiling ! 

Second Marquis. So fresh, that being 
near her, one might catch cold in hia 
heart ! 

Christian {looks up, sees Roxane, and^ 
agitated, seizes Ligniere by the arm). 
That is she ! 

Ligniere (ZooArmgr). Ah, that is she ! . . , 

Christian. Yes. Tell me at once. . . , 
Oh, I am afraid ! . . . 

Ligniere {sipping his wine slowly),

they were talking. 

(^WJiile he is speaking^ a richly dressed 
noMeniaji, wearing the order of the Holy 
Ghosi on a blue ribbon across his breast, 
enters Roxajce's box, and^ without taking 
a seat^ talks with her a moment.) 

Christian (starting). That man ? . . . 

LiGNiERE (who is beginning to be tipsy, 
winking). He! He I Comte de Guiche. 
Enamored of her. But married to the 
niece of Armand de Richelieu. Wishes to 
manage a match between Roxane and cer- 
tain sorry lord, one Monsieur de Valvert, 
vicomteand . . . easy. She does not sub* 
scribe to his views, but De Guiche is power- 
ful : he can persecute to some purpose a 
simple commoner. But I have duly set 
fortjh his shady machinations in a song 
which . . . Ho! he must bear me a grudge ! 
The end was wicked . . . Listen! . . , 
(He rises, staggering, and lifting his glass, 
is about to sing.) 

Christian. No. Good- evening. 

LiGNiERE. You are going ? . . . 

Christian. To find Monsieur de Val- 
vert. 

LiGNiERE. Have a care. You are the 
one who will get killed. Undicatiiig'RoX'

A.NE by a glance.) Stay. Some one id 
Vooking . . . 

Christian. It is true . . . 

{He remains absorbed in the contempla" 
lion of RoxANE. The pickpockets^ seeing 
his abstracted air, draw nearer to him.) 

LiGNiERE. Ah, you are going to stay. 
Well, I am going. I am thirsty ! And I am 
looked for ... at all the public-houses! 
{Exit unsteadily.) 

Le Bret {who has made the circuit of the 
house, returning toward Ragueneau, in a 
tone of relief). Cyrano is not here. 

Ragueneau. And yet . . . 

Le Bret. I will trust to Fortune he has 
not seen the announcement. 

The Audience. Begin! Begin! 

One op the Marquises {watching Be 
GrUiCHE, who comes from Roxane's box, and 
crosses the pit, surrounded by obsequious 
satellites, among whom the Vicomte de 
Valvert). Always a court about him, De 
Guiche ! 

Other Marquis. Pf ! . . Another Gas- 
con! 

First Marquis. A Gascon, of the cold and 
supple sort. That sort succeeds. Believe 
me, it will be best to offer him our duty. 

{They approach De Guiche.) 
20 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Second Marquis. These admirable rib* 
bons! What color, Comte de Guiche I 
Should you call it Kiss-me-Sweet or . . . 
Expiring Fawn ? 

De Guiche. This shade is called Sick 
Spaniard. 

First Marquis. Appropriately called, 
for shortly, thanks to your valor, the 
Spaniard will be sick indeed, in Flanders I 

De Guiche. I am going upon the stage. 
Are you coming ? {He walks toward the 
stage, followed by all the marquises and 
men of quality. He turns and calls.) Val' 
vert, come! 

Christian {who has been listening and 
watching them, starts on hearing thai 
name). The vicomte! . . . Ah, in his 
face ... in his face I will fling my . . . 
(He puts his hand to his pocket and finds 
the pickpocket's hand. He turns.) Hein ? 

Pickpocket. Ai ! 

Christian {without letting him go). I 
was locking for a glove. 

Pickpocket {with an abject smile). And 
you found a hand. {In a different tone, 
low and rapid.) Let me go ... I wiJi 
tell you a secret.

Christian (as above). Yes ? . . . 

Pickpocket. Has not an hour to liva 
A song he made annoyed one of the 
great, and a hundred men — I am one of 
them — will be posted to-night . . . 

Christian. A hundred ? . . By whom ? 

Pickpocket. Honor . . . 

Christian {shrugging his shoulders). 
Dh! . . . 

Pickpocket {with great dignity) . Among 
rogues I 

Christian. Where will they be posted ? 

Pickpocket. At the Porte de Nesle, on 
his way home. Inform him. 

Christian (letting him go). But where 
can I find him ? 

Pickpocket. Go to all the taverns : the 
Grolden Vat, the Pine- Apple, the Bolt and 
Bosom, the Twin Torches, the Three Fun- 
nels, and in each one leave a scrap of 
writing warning him. 

Christian. Yes. I will run ! . . . Ah, the 
blackguards ! A hundred against one ! . . . 
(Looks lovingly toivard Eoxane.) Leave 
her ! . . . (Furiously, looJciyig toward Val- 
VERT.) And him! . . . But Ligniere must 
be prevented. (Exit running.)

(De Guiche, the Marquises, all the gen* 
try have disappeared behind the curtain^ to 
place themselves on the stage-seats. The 
pit is croivded. There is not an empty seat 
in the boxes or the gallery.) 

The Audience. Begin ! 

A Burgher {whose wig goes sailing off at 
the end of a string held by one of the pages 
in the upper gallery) . My wig ! 

Screams of Delight. He is bald ! . . .

Snuff that candle ! 

Other Marquis {thrusting his head cut 
betiveen the curtains.) A chair ! (A chair 
is passed from hand to hand, above the 
heads. The marquis takes it and disap* 
pears., after kissing his hand repeatedly 
toward the boxes.) 

A Spectator. Silence I 

(Once more, the three knocks. The cur- 
tain opens. Tableau. TJie marquises

Le Bret {to Ragueneau, under breath). 
Is Montfleury the first to appear ?

The Old Burgher {behind Cyrano). 
"^ut without compunction you deprive us 
of hearing La Clorise. I am deter- 
m^ined . . . 

Cyrano {turning his chair around so as 
to face the old gentleman ; respectfully). 
Venerable mule, old Baro's verses being 
what they are, I do it without compunc- 
tion, as you say. 

The VREcrnvsES {in the boxes). Ha! . . . 
Ho! . . . Our own Baro! . . . My dear, 
did you hear that? How can such a thing 
be said? . . . Ha! . . . Ho! . . . 

Cyrano {turning his chair so as to face 
the boxes; gallantly). Beautiful creatures, 
do you bloom and shine, be ministers of 
dreams, your smiles our anodyne. Inspire 
poets, but poems . . . spare to judge ! 

Bellerose. But the money which must 
be given back at the door !

JoDELET. Should we be hooted in a

Bellerose. The house must be evacu- 
ated! 

JoDELET. Evacuate it ! 

(TJie audience begins to Zeare; Cyrano 
looking on ivith a satisfied air. The crowds 
hoicever, becoming interested in the follow- 
ing scene, the exodus is suspended. The 
women in the boxes who tvere already stand- 
ing and had put on their wraps, stop to 
listen and end by resuming their seats.) 

Le Bret (to Cyraxo). What you have 
done ... is mad ! 

A Bore. Montfleury! . . . the eminent 
actor ! . . . What a scandal ! . . . But the 
Due de Candale is his patron ! . . . Have 
you a patron, you ? 

Cyrano. No! 

The Bore. You have not 

Cyrano. No ! 

33 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

The Bore. What ? You are not pro« 
tected by some great nobleman under th« 
cover of whose name. . . . 

Cyrano (exasperated). No, I have told 
you twice. Must I say the same thing 
thrice? No, I have no protector . . . (hand 
on sword) but this will do. 

The Bore. Then, of course, you wiU 
leave town. 

Cyrano. That will depend. 

The Bore. But the Due de Candale has 
a long arm . . . 

Cyrano. Not so long as mine . . . 
(pointing to his sword) pieced out with 
this! 

The Bore. But you carmot have thd 
presumption . . . 

Cyrano. I can, yes. 

The Bore. But . . . 

Cyrano. And now, . . . face about! 

The Bore. But . . . 

Cyrano. Face about, I say ... or 
else, tell me why you are looking at my 
nose. 

The Bore (bewildered). I . . . 

Cyrano (advancing upon him) . In what 
is it unusual? 

The BoRi^ (backing). Your worship ifl 
mistaken 

34 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano (same business as above). Is it 
flabby and pendulous, like a proboscis ? 

The Bore. I never said . . . 

Cyrano. Or hooked like a hawk's beak ? 

The Bore. I . . . 

Cyrano. Do you discern a mole upon 
the tip ? 

The Bore. But . . . 

Cyrano. Or is a fly disporting himself 
thereon ? What is there wonderful about 
it? 

The Bore. Oh . . . 

Cyrano. Is it a freak of nature ? 

The Bore. But I had refrained from 
casting so much as a glance at it ! 

Cyrano. And why, I pray, should you 
not look at it ? 

The Bore. I had . . . 

Cyrano. So it disgusts you ? 

The Bore. Sir . . . 

Cyrano. Its color strikes you as un- 
W^holesome ? 

The Bore. Sir. . . 

Cyrano. Its shape, unfortunate ? 

The Bore. But far from it ! 

Cyrano. Then wherefore that depre- 
ciating air? . . . Perhaps monsieur thinks 
it a shade too large? 

The Bore. Indeed not. No, indeed* 

35 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

I think it small . . , small, — I should have 
said, minute ! 

Cyrano. What? How? Charge me 
with such a ridiculous defect? Small, my 
nose? Ho ! . . 

The Bore. Heavens ! 

Cyrano. Enormous, my nose ! . . , 
Contemptible stutterer, snub-nosed and 
flat-headed, be it known to you that I am 
proud, proud of such an appendage! inas- 
much as a great nose is properly the index 
of an affable, kindly, courteous man, witty, 
liberal, brave, such as I am ! and such as 
you are for evermore precluded from sup- 
posing yourself, deplorable rogue ! For the 
inglorious surface my hand encounters 
above your ruff, is no less devoid — (Strikes 
him). 

The Bore. Ai ! ai ! . . . 

Cyrano. Of pride, alacrity and sweep, 
of perception and of gift, of heavenly 
spark, of sumptuousness, to sum up all, of 
NOSE, than that (turns Mm around by the 
shoulders and suits the action to theivord), 
which stops my boot below your spine !

watch! . . .

might find entertainment in my organ ol

smell .... And if the facetious fellov^ 
be of birth, my custom is, before I let him 
go, to chasten him, in front, and higher up, 
with steel, and not with hide! 

De Guiche (ivho has stepped down from 
the stage with the marquises). He is 
becoming tiresome ! 

Valyert (shrugging his shoulders). It 
is empty bluster! 

De Guiche. Will no one take him 
up? 

Valvert. No one ? . . . Wait ! I will 
have one of those shots at him ! (He ap- 
proaches Cyrano who is ivatching him, and 
stops in front of him, in an attitude of silly 
swagger.) Your . . . your nose is . . . 
errr . . . Your nose ... is very large! 

Cyrano (gravely). Very. 

Valvert (laughs). Ha! . . . 

Cyrano (imperturbable). Is that all? 

Valvert. But . . . 

Cyrano. Ah, no, young man, that is 
not enough! You might have said, dear 
me, there are a thousand things . . . vary- 
ing the tone . . . For instance . . . here 
you are: — Aggressive: "I, monsieur, if I 
had such a nose, nothing would serve but 
I must cut it off!" Amicable: "It must 
be in your way while drinking ; you ought 

37 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

t> have a special beaker made ! " Deecrip« 
tve: " It is a crag! . . . apeak! ... a 
promontory! ... A promonotory, did I 
Bay? . . . It is a peninsula ! " Inquisitive: 
*'What may the oflSce be of that oblong 
receptacle? Is it an inkhorn or a scissor- 
case?" Mincing: "Do you so dote on 
birds, you have, fond as a father, been at 
pains to fit the little darlings with a roost? " 
Blunt : ' ' Tell me, monsieur, you, when you 
smoke, is it possible you blow the vapor 
through your nose without a neighbor cry- 
ing " The chimney is afire?" Anxious: 
*' Go with caution, I beseech, lest your head, 
iragged over by that weight, should drag 
you over! " Tender: " Have a little sun- 
shade made for it ! It might get freckled ! ' 
Learned : ' ' None but the beast, monsieur, 
mentioned by Aristophanes, the hippo- 
campelephantocamelos, can have borne 
beneath his forehead so much cartilage and 
bone!" Off-hand: "What, comrade, is 
that sort of peg in style? Capital to hang 
one's hat upon!" Emphatic: "No wind 
can hope, O lordly nose, to give the whole 
of you a cold, but the Nor-Wester ! " Dra- 
matic : " It is the Red Sea when it bleeds ! " 
Admiring: "What a sign for a perfumer's 
iShop ! " Lyrical : '* Art thou a Triton, and

I& that thy conch?" Simple: "A monu« 
ment! When is admission free?" Deferent: 
*' Suffer, monsieur, that I should pay you 
my respects: that is what I call possessing 
a house of your own!" Rustic: "Hi, 
boys! Call that a nose ? Ye don't gull 
me! It's either a prize carrot or else a 
stunted gourd ! " Military : " Level against 
the cavalry ! " Practical : ' ' Will you put 
it up for raffle ? Indubitablj'', sir, it will 
be the feature of the game ! " And finally 
in parody of weeping Pyramus : ' ' Be- 
hold, behold the nose that traitorously de- 
stroyed the beauty of its master ! and is 
blushing for the same ! " — That, my dear 
sir, or something not unlike, is what you 
would have said to me, had you the small- 
est leaven of letters or of wit ; but of wit, O 
most pitiable of objects made by God, you 
never had a rudiment, and of letters, you 
have just those that are needed to spell 
** fool ! " — But, had it been otherwise, and 
had you been possessed of the fertile fancy 
requisite to shower upon me, here, in this 
noble company, that volley of sprightly 
pleasantries, still should you not have de- 
livered yourself of so much as a quarter of 
the tenth part of the beginning of the 
first. . . . For I let off these good things at 

39 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

myself, and with sufficient zest, but do 
not suffer another to let them off at me ! 

De Guiche {attempting to lead away the 
amazed vicomte). Let be, vicomte! 

Valvert. That insufferable haughty 
bearing! ... A clodhopper without . . . 
without so much as gloves . . . who goes 
abroad without points ... or bow- 
knots ! . . . 

Cyrano. My foppery is of the inner 
man. I do not trick myself out like a pop- 
injay, but I am more fastidious, if I am 
not so showy. I would not sally forth, by 
any chance, not washed quite clean of an 
affront; my conscience foggy about the 
eye, my honor crumpled, my nicety black- 
rimmed. I walk with all upon me fur- 
bished bright. I plume myself with inde- 
pendence and straightforwardness. It is 
not a handsome figure, it is nxy soul, I hold 
erect as in a brace. I go decked with ex- 
ploits in place of ribbon bows. I taper to 
a point my wit like a moustache. And at 
my passage through the crowd true sayings 
ring like spurs ! 

Valvert. But, sir . . . 

Cyrano. I am without gloves ? . . a 
mighty matter ! I only had one left, of a 
very ancient pair, and even that became 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

^ burden to me ... I left it in somebody*a 
face. 

Valvert. Villain, clod-poll, flat-foot, 
refuse of the earth ! 

Cyrano (taking off his hat and hoiving 
as if the Vicomte had been introducing 
himself). Ah ? . . . And mine, Cyrano- 
Savinien-Hercule of Bergerac ! 

Valvert (exasperated). Buffoon! 

Cyrano (giving a sudden cry ^ as if seized 
with a cramp). Ai! . . . 

Valvert (who had started toward the 
hack, turning). What is he saying now ? 

Cyrano (scretving his face as if in pain). 
It must have leave to stir ... it has a 
cramp ! It is bad for it to be kept still so 
long ! 

Valvert. What is the matter ? 

Cyrano. My rapier prickles like a foot 
asleep ! 

Valvert (draiving). So be it ! 

Cyrano. I shall give you a charming 
little hurt I 

Valvert (contemptuous). A poet ! 

Cyrano. Yes, a poet, . . . and to 
such an extent, that while we fence, I 
will, hop ! extempore, compose you a 
ballade ! 

Valvert. A ballade ? 

41 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. I fear you do not know what 
that is. 

Valvert. But . . . 

Cyrano {as if saying a lesson). The bal- 
lade is composed of three stanzas of eight 
lines each. . . 

Yalyert {stamps with his feet). Oh! . . . 

Cyrano {continuing). And an envoi ol 
four. 

Valvert. You . . . 

Cyrano. I will with the same breath 
fight you and compose one. And at the 
last line, I will hit you. 

Valvert. Indeed you will not! 

"Cyrano. No? ... {Declaiming). 
ballade of the duel which in Burgundy 

House 
Monsieur de Bergerac fought with a jack- 
anapes. 

Valvert. And what is that, if you 
please ? 

Cyrano. That is the title. 

The Audience {at the highest pitch of 
excitement). Make room ! . . . Good 
sport I . . . Stand aside ! . . . Keep 
Btill ! . . .

Cyrano (taking off his hat) . Dear child, 
despite my Gascon pride, which forbids 
that I should profit at your hand by the 
most inconsiderable of dainties, I fear too 
much lest a denial should grieve you : I 
will accept therefore . . . (He goes to the 
stand and selects). Oh, a trifle ! . . . A 
grape off this. . . (She proffers the bunchy 
he takes a single grape.) No . . . one I 
This glass of water . . . (She starts to pour 
wine into it ^ he stops her.) No , . . clear! 
And half a macaroon. (He breaks in two 
the macaroon^ and returns half.) 

Le Bret. This comes near being silly ! 

Sweetmeat Vender. Oh, you will take 
something more ! . . . 

Cyrano. Yes. Your hand to kiss, 
(He kisses the hand she holds out to him^ as 
if it were that of a princess.) 

Sweetmeat Vender. Monsieur, I thank 
you. {Curtseys.) Good evening ! (Exit.) 

Cyrano (to Le Bret). I am listening. 
{He establishes himself before the standi 
sets the macaroon before him,) Dinner ! 
(does the same with the glass of water), 
Drink I {and with the grape) . Dessert j

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

(He sits down.) La ! let me begin ! I was 
as hungry as a wolf ! (Eating.) You 
were saying ? 

Le Bret. That if you listen to none but 
those great boobies and swashbucklers your 
judgment will become wholly perverted. 
Inquire, will you, of the sensible, concern- 
ing the effect produced to-day by your 
prowesses. 

Cyrano (finishing his macaroon). Enor- 
mous! 

Le Bret. The cardinal . . . 

Cyrano (beaming). He was there, thd 
cardinal ? 

Le Bret. Must have found what you 
did. ... 

Cyrano. To a degree, original. 

Le Bret. Still . . . 

Cyrano. He is a poet. It cannot be 
distasteful to him wholly that one should 
deal confusion to a fellow-poet's play. 

Le Bret. But, seriously, you make too 
many enemies! 

Cyrano (biting into the grape). How 
many, thereabouts, should you think 1 
made to-night ? 

Le Bret. Eight and forty. Not men 
tloning the women. 

Cyrano. Come, tell them over I 

4S 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. Montfleury , the old merchant, 
De Guiche, the Vicomte, Baro, the whole 
Academy . . . 

Cyrano. Enough! You steep me in 
bliss ! 

Le Bret. But whither will the road you 
follow lead you ? What can your object 
be? 

Cyrano. I was wandering aimlessly; 
too many roads were open . . . too many 
resolves, too complex, allowed of being 
taken. I took . . . 
Le Bret. Which ? 

Cyrano. By far the simplest of them 
all. I decided to be, in every matter, al- 
ways, admirable! 

Le Bret (shrugging his shoii Iders) . That 
will do. — But tell me, will you not, the 
motive — look, the true one ! — of your dis' 
like to Montfleury. 

Cyrano {rising). That old Silenus, who 
has not seen his knees this many a year, 
still believes himself a delicate desperate 
danger to the fair. And as he struts and 
burrs upon the stage, makes sheep's-eyes 
at them with his moist f rog's-eyes. And 1 
have hated him ... oh, properly! . . . 
since the night he was so daring as to 
cast his glance on her . . . her, who— 
i 49 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Oh, I thought I saw a slug crawl over a 
flower ! 

Le Bret {aynazed). Hey ? What ? li 
it possible ? . . . 

Cyrano {ivith a bitter laugh). That I 
should love ? {In a different tone, seriously.) 
I love. 

Le Bret. And may one know ? . . . 
You never told me. . . 

Cyrano. Whom I love ? . . . Come, 
think a little. The dream of being beloved, 
even by the beautiless, is made, to me, an 
empty dream indeed by this good nose, 
my forerunner ever by a quarter of an hour, 
Hence, whom should I love ? ... It seema 
superfluous to tell you ! . . . I love . . . 
it was inevitable ! . . . the most beautiful 
that breathes ! 

Le Bret. The most beautiful ? . . . 

Cyrano. No less, in the whole world! 
And the most resplendent, and the most 
delicate of wit, and among the golden- 
haired . . . {icith overichelmifig despair) 
Still the superlative ! 

Le Bret. Dear me, what is this fair one? 

Cyrano. All unawares, a deadlj' snare, 

exquisite without concern to be so. A 

snare of nature's own, a musk-rose, in 

which ambush Love lies low. Who haa

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

«een her smile remembers the ineffable I 
There is not a thing so common but she 
turns it into prettiness ; and in the merest 
Hod or beck she can make manifest all the 
attributes of a goddess. No, Venus .' you 
cannot step into your iridescent shell, nor, 
Dian, you, walk through the blossoming 
groves, as she steps into her chair and 
walks in Paris ! 

Le Bret. Sapristi ! I understand ! It 
Is clear ! 

Cyrano. It is pellucid. 

Le Bret. Magdeleine Robin, your 
fousin ? 

Cyrano. Yes, Roxane. 

Le Bret. But, what could be bettei ? 
You love her ? Tell her so ! You covered 
yourself with glory in her sight a moment 
since. 

Cyrano. Look well at me, dear friend, 
dnd tell me how much hope you think can 
be justly entertained with this protuber- 
U,nce. Oh, I foster no illusions ! . . . 
Sometimes, indeed, yes, in the violet dusk, 
i yield, even I ! to a dreamy mood. I 
penetrate some garden that lies sweeten 
ing the hour. With my poor great devi. 
of a nose I sniff the April. . . . And as I 
follow with my eyes some woman passing 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

with some cavalier, I think how deal 
would I hold having to walk beside me, 
linked like that, slowly, in the soft moon- 
light, such a one ! I kindle — I forget — ■ 
and then . . . then suddenly I see the 
shadow of my profile upon the garden- 
wall ! 

Le Bret {touched.) My friend . . . 

Cyrano. Friend, I experience a bad 
half hour sometimes, in feeling so un- 
sightly. . . and alone. 

Le Bret {in quick sympathy^ taking Ms 
hand). You weep ? 

Cyrano. Ah, God forbid I That " 
Never ! No, that would be unsightly to 
excess ! That a tear should course the 
whole length of this nose ! Never, so long 
j,s I am accountable, shall the divine loveli- 
ness of tears be implicated with so much 
gross ugliness ! Mark me well, nothing 
is so holy as are tears, nothing ! and never 
shall it be that, rousing mirth through me, 
a single one of them shall seem ridiculous ! 

Le Bret. Come, do not despond ! Love 
is a lottery. 

Cyrano, {shaking his head). No! I 
love Cleopatra: do I resemble Caesar ? I 
worship Berenice : do I put you in mind of 
Titus ? 

52 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. But your courage . . . and 
your wit ! — The little girl who but a mo- 
ment ago bestowed on you that very mod- 
est meal, her eyes, you must have seen aa 
much, did not exactly hate you ! 

Cyrano (impressed). That is true ! 

Le Bret. You see ? So, then ! — But 
Roxane herself, in following your duel, 
went lily-pale. 

Cyrano. Lily-pale ? . . . 

Le Bret. Her mind, her heart as well, 
are struck with wonder ! Be bold, speak 
to her, in order that she may . . . 

Cyrano. Laugh in my face ! . . . 
No, there is but one thing upon earth I 
fear. ... It is that. 

The Doorkeeper {admitting the Duenna 
to Cyrano). Monsieur, you are inquired 
for. 

Cyrano {seeing the duenna). Ah, my 
God ! . . . her duenna ! 

The Duenna {icith a great curtsey). 
Somebody wishes to know of her valor- 
ous cousin where one may, in private, see 
him. 

Cyrano (upset). See me ? 

The Duenna (tcith curtsey). See you. 
There are things for your ear. 

Cyrano. There are . . . ? 

53 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

The Duenna {other curtsey). Things. 

Cyrai^o (staggering) . Ah, my God! . . . 

The Duenna. Somebody intends, to 
morrow, at the earliest roses of the dawn, 
to hear Mass at Saint Roch. 

Cyrano (upholds himself by leaning on 
Le Bret). Ah, my God ! 

The Duenna . That over, where might 
one step in a moment, have a little talk ? 

Cyrano (losing his senses) . Where? . . . 
I . . . But ... Ah, my God! 

The Duenna. Expedition, if you please. 

Cyrano. I am casting about . . . 

The Duenna. Where ? 

Cyrano. At ... at ... at Rague- 
neau's . . . the pastrycook's. 

The Duenna. He lodges ? 

Cyrano. In ... In Rue . . . Ah, my 
God ! my God ! ... St. Honore. 

The Duenna (retiriyig). We will be 
there. Do not fail. At seven. 

Cyrano. I will not fail. 

{Exit Duenna.) 

Cyrano (falling on Le Bret's neck). To 
me . . . from her ... a meeting ! 

Le Bret. Well, your gloom is dis- 
pelled ? 

Cyrano. Ah, to whatever end it maj 
be, she is aware of my existence 1 
54 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. And now you will be calm ? 

Cyrano (beside himself). Now, I shall 
be fulminating and f renetical ! I want an 
army all complete to put to rout ! I have 
ten hearts and twenty arms ... I cannot 
now be suited with felling dwarfs to 
earth. . . . ( At the toiJ of his lungs.) Gianta 
are what I want ! 

(During the last lines., on the stage aX 
the bacJc^ shadoivy shapes of players havo 
been moving about. The rehearsal has 
begun; the fiddlers have resumed their 
places.) 

A Voice (from the stage) . Hey ! Psst ! 
Over there ! A little lower. We are try- 
ing to rehearse ! 

Cyrano (laughing). We are going t 
{He goes toivard the back.) 

(Through the street door., enter CuiGY, 
Brissaille, several Officers supporting 
I-IGNIERE in a state of complete intoxica- 
tion!^ 

CuiGY. Cyrano ! 

Cyrano. What is this ? 

CuiGY. A turdus vinaticus we are bring 
\ng you. 

Cyrano (recoa^iizing him). LigniereJ 
Hey, what has happened to you? 

CuiGY. He is looking for you. 

55 



Cyrano de Bergerac* 

Brissaille. He cannot go home. 

Cyrano. Why ? 

LiGNiERE (m a thick voice, showing him 
a bit of crumpled paper.) This note bida 
me beware ... A hundred men against 
me ... on account of lampoon. . . . 
Grave danger threatening me. . . . Porte 
de Nesle . . . must pass it to get home. 
Let me come and sleep under your roof. 

Cyrano. A hundred, did you say ?— 
You shall sleep at home! 

LiGNiERE (frightened). But . . . 

Cyrano {in a terrible voice, pointing to 
the lighted lantern which the Doorkeeper 
stands swinging as he listens to this scene) . 
Take that lantern (Ligniere hurriedly takes 
it) and walk ! . . . I swear to tuck you in 
your bed to-night myself. {To the Of- 
ficers.) You, follow at a distance. You 
may look on ! 

CuiGY. But a hundred men . . . 

Cyrano. Are not one man too many 
for my mood to-night ! 

{The players, in their several costumes^ 
have stepped down from the stage and come 
nearer.) 

Le Bret. But why take under your 
especial care . . . 

Cyrano. Still Le Bret is not satisfied I 

56 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. That most commonplace of 
eots ? 

Cyrano (slapping Ligniere on the shouh 
der). Because this sot, this cask of mus- 
catel, this hogshead of rosolio, did once 
upon a time a wholly pretty thing. On 
leaving Mass, having seen her whom he 
loved take holy-water, as the rite pre- 
scribes, he, whom the sight of water puts 
to flight, ran to the holy- water bowl, and 
Btooping over, drank it dry. . . . 

An Actress {in the costume of soubrette) 
Tiens, that was nice ! 

Cyrano. Was it not, soubrette ? 

The Soubrette (to the others) . But why 
are they, a hundred, all against one poor 
poet ? 

Cyrano. Let us start ! (To the Of- 
ficers.) And you, gentlemen, when you 
see me attack, whatever you may suppose 
to be my danger, do not stir to second 
me ! 

Another of the Actresses (jumping 
from the stage). Oh, I will not miss see- 
ing this ! 

Cyrano. Come ! 

Another Actress (likewise jumping 
from the stage^ to an elderly actor). Caa* 
eandre, will you not come ? 

57 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. Come, all of you ! the Doctor 
Isabel, Leander, all ! and you shall lend, 
charming fantastic swarm, an air ot 
Italian farce to the Spanish drama in view. 
Yes, you shall be a tinkling heard above a 
roar, like bells about a tambourine ! 

All the Women {in great glee) . Bravo ! 

. . Hurry ! . . . A mantle ! . . . A hood ! 

JoDELET. Let us go ! 

Cyrano (to the fiddlers) . You will favor 
us with a tune, messieurs the violinists ! 

(The fiddlers fall into the train. The 
lighted candles which furnished the foot- 
lights are seized and distributed. The pro- 
cession becomes a torchlight procession.) 

Cyrano. Bravo ! Officers, beauty in 
fancy dress, and, twenty steps ahead . . . 
(he takes the position he describes). I, by 
myself, under the feather stuck, with her 
own hand, by Glory, in my hat ! Proud 
as a Scipio trebly Nasica ! — It is under- 
stood ? Formal interdiction to interfere 
with me ! — We are ready ? One ! Two i 
Three ! Doorkeeper, open the door ! 

(The Doorkeeper opens wide the folding 
door. A picturesque comer of Old Paris 
appears, bathed in moonlight.) 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . Paris floats in dim 
nocturnal mist. . . . The sloping blueish 

S8 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

roofs are washed with moonlight. ... A 
setting, exquisite indeed, offers itself for the 
scene about to be enacted. . . . Yonder, 
under silvery vapor wreathes, like a mys 
terious magic mirror, glimmers the Seine. 
, . . And you shall see what you shall see ! 

All. To the Porte de Nesle ! 

Cyrano {standing on the threshold). To 
the Porte de Nesle! (Before crossing it^ 
he turns to the Soubrette.) Were you not 
asking, mademoiselle, why upon that soli- 
tary rhymster a hundred men were set V 
(He draivs his sword, and tranquilly) . Be- 
cause it was well known he is a friend of 
mine ! (Exit.) 

(To the sound of the violins, hy the flick- 
ering light of the candles, the procession — 
LiGNiERE staggering at the head., the Ac- 
tresses arm in arm icith the Officers, the 
players capering behind,— ^follows out into 
the night. Curtain.)

ACrr SECOND. 

THE COOKSHOP OF POETS. 

Ragueneau's shop, vast kitchen at tJiQ 
torner of Rue St. Honore and Rue de 
VArbre-Sec, which can he seen at the back^ 
through the glass door, gray in the early 
dawn. 

At the left, in front, a counter overhung 
by a icrought-iron canopy from which 
geese, ducks, white peacocks are hanging. 
Jn large china jars, tall nosegays composed, 
of the simpler flowers, mainly sunflowers. 
On the same side, in the middle distance, an 
enormous fireplace, in front of ivhich, be- 
iween huge andirons, each of which sup- 
ports a small iron pot, roasting meats drip 
into appropriate pans. 

At the right, door in the front wing. In 
the middle distance, a staircase leading to 
a loft, the interior of ivhich is seen through 
open shutters ; a spread table lighted by a 
small Flemish candelabmim, shoivs it to b€ 
un eating-room. A wooden gallery oonf 
60 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Hnuing the stairway, suggests other sin^- 
Jar rooms to ivhich it may lead. 

In the center of the shop, an iron hoop— - 
which can he lowered by means of a rope^-" 
to ivhich large i^oasts are hooked. 

In the shadow, under the stairicay, ovens 
are glowing. Copper molds and saucepans 
are shining ; spits turning, hams sivinging, 
pastry pyramids showing fair. It is the 
early beginning of the workday. Bustling 
of hurried scidlions, portly cooks and young 
cook' s -assistants ; sivarnning of caps dec' 
orated with hen feathers and guinea-fowl 
wings. Wicker crates and broad sheets of 
tin are brought in loaded tvith brioches and 
tarts. 

There are tables covered tvith meats 
and cakes ; others, surrounded by chairs, 
await customers. In a corner, a smaller 
table, littered with papers. At the rise 
of the curtain, Ragueneau is discovered 
seated at this table, writing with an 
inspired air^ and counting upon his 
fingers. 

First Pastrycook {bringing in a tatt 
molded pudding) . Noiig:at of fruit ! 

S"ECo:.rD Pastrycook {bringing in the dish 
henanuis). Custard !

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Third Pastrycook (bringing in a fowl 
roasted in its feathei^s) . Peacock ! 

Fourth Pastrycook (bringing in a 
tray of cakes). Mince-pies ! 

Fifth Pastrycook {byHnging in a deep 
earthen dish). Beef stew ! 

Ragueneau (laying down his pen^ and 
looking up). Daybreak already plates 
with silver the copper pans ! Time, 
Ragueneau, to smother within thee the 
singing divinity ! The hour of the lute 
will come anon — now is that of the ladle ! 
(He rises; speaking to 07ie of the cooks.) 
You, sir, be so good as to lengthen this 
gravy, — it is too thick ! 

The Cook. How much ? 

Ragueneau. Three feet. {Goes further,] 

The Cook. What does he mean ? 

First Pastrycook. Let me have the 
tart! 

Second Pastrycook. The dumpling ! 

Ragueneau {standing before the fire-^ 
place). Spread thy wings, Muse, and fly 
further, that thy lovely eyes may not be 
reddened at the sordid kitchen fire ! {To 
one of the cooks, pointing at some small 
loaves of bread.) You have improperly 
placed the cleft in those loaves ; the 
csesura belongs in the middle, — between

the hemistichs ! (To another of the 
Cooks, pointing at an unfinished pasty.) 
This pastry palace requires a roof ! {To a 
young cook's- apprentice^ who, seated upon 
the floor, is putting fowls on a spit.) And 
you, on that long spit, arrange, my son, in 
pleasing alternation, the modest pullet and 
the splendid turkey-cock, — even as our 
wise Malherbe alternated of old the greater 
with th e lesser lines, and_ jQ> jwith-Jiu^asted- 
fOi^LS-CQinppse a poem I 

Another Apprentice {coming forward 
with a platter covered by a napkin). Mas- 
ter, in your honor, see what I have baked. 
... I hope you are pleased with it ! 

Ragueneau {ecstatic) . A lyre ! 

The Apprentice. Of pie-crust ! 

Ragueneau (touched). With candied 
fruits ! 

The Apprentice. And the strings, see, 
«— of spun sugar ! 

Ragueneau {giving him money). Go, 
drink my health ! {Catching sight of Ias^ 
who is entering.) Hush ! My wife ! . . . 
Move on, and hide that money. ( To Lise, 
showing her the lyre, ivith a constrained 
air.) Fine, is it not ? 

Lise. Ridiculous ! {She sets a pile of 
wrapping-paper on the counter.) 

63 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Ragueneau. Paper bags? Good* 
rhanks. {He examines them.) Heavens 1 
My beloved books ! The masterpieces of 
toy friends, — dismembered, — torn ! — to 
fashion paper bags for penny pies 1 — Ah, 
the abominable case is re-enacted of Or- 
pheus and the Maenads ! 

LiSE {drily). And have I not an un- 
questionable right to make what use I can 
of the sole payment ever got from your pal- 
try scribblers of uneven lines ? 

Eagueneau. Pismire ! Forbear to in- 
sult those divine, melodious crickets ! 

LiSE. Before frequenting that low crew, 
toy friend, you did not use to call me a 
Maenad, — no, nor yet a pismire ! 

Ragueneau, Put poems to such a 
use I 

LiSE. To that use and no other I 

Ragueneau. If with poems you do this, 
I should like to know, Madame, what you 
do with prose ! 

{Tioo children have come into the shop.) 

Ragueneau. What can I do for you, 
little ones ? 

First Child. Three patties. 

Ragueneau (ivaiting on them). Ther« 
you are I Beautifully browned, and pip- 
ing hot. . 

64 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Second Child. Please, will you wrap 
them for us ? 

Ragueneau {starting, aside). There goes 
one of my bags ! {To the children.) You 
want them wrapped, do you ? ( He takes 
one of the paper bags, and as he is about to 
put in the patties, reads.) " No otherwise^ 
Ulysses, from Penelope departing. ..." 
Not this one ! {He lays it aside and takes 
another. At the moment of putting in the 
patties, he reads.) " Phoebus of the aureate 
locks. . . " Not that one ! {Same busi- 
ness.) 

LiSE {out of patience). Well, what are 
you waiting for ? 

Ragueneau. Here we are. Here we 
are. Here we are. {He takes a third bag 
and resigns himself.) The sonnet to Phyl- 
lis !.. . It is hard, all the same. 

LiSE. It is lucky you made up your 
mind. {Shrugging her shoulder's.) Nico- 
Jemus ! {She climbs on a chair and ar- 
ranges dishes on a sideboard.) 

Ragueneau {taking advantage of her 
back being turned, calls back the children 
who Jutd already reached the door) . Psst ! 
. . . Children ! Give me back the sonnet 
to Phyllis, and you shall have six patties 
instead of ^-^ree! {The children give back

Cyrano. What time is it ? 

Ragueneau (boiving with eager defer* 
ence). Six o'clock. 

Cyrano (with emotion) . In an hour I 
(He comes and goes in the shop.) 

'Raque^t^av (following him). Bravo I I 
too was witness. . . . 

Cyrano. Of what ? 

Ragueneau. Your fight. 

Cyrano. Which ? 

Ragueneau. At the Hotel de Bourgogne. 

Cyrano (with disdain) . Ah, the duel ! 

Ragueneau (admiringly). Yes, — the 
duel in rhyme. 

LiSE. He can talk of nothing else. 

Cyrano. Let him! ... It does nc 
harm. 

Ragueneau (thrusting with a spit he hah 
seized). ''At the last line, I hit!^^ "At 
the last line I hit ! " — How fine that is ! 
(With groioing enthusiasm.) " At the last 
line, I — 

Cyrano. What time, Ragueneau ? 
66 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Ragueneau {remaining fixed in the atti' 
tude of thrusting, while he looks at ths 
clock). Five minutes past six. — " I hit !^^ 
{He recovers from his duelling posture.) 
Oh, to be able to make a ballade ! 

LiSE {to Cyrano, who in passing her 
counter has absentmindedhj shaken hands 
with her). What ails your hand? 

Cyrano. Nothing. A scratch. 

Ragueneau. You have been exposed to 
some danger ? 

Cyrano. None whatever. 

LiSE {shaking her fiiiger at him) . I fear 
that is a fib ! 

Cyrano. From the swelling of my 
nose ? The fib in that case must have been 
good-sized. . . . {In a different tone.) I 
am expecting some one. You will leave us 
alone in here. 

Ragueneau. But how can I contrive it? 
My poets shortly will be coming- . . . 

Lise {ironically). For breakfast! 

Cyrano. When I sign to you, you will 
clear the place of them. — What time is it? 

Ragueneau. It is ten minutes past six. 

Cyrano {seating himself nervously at 
Ragueneau's table and helping himself to 
paper). A pen? 

67 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Ragtjeneau {taking one from behind his 
ear, and offering it). A swan's quill. 

A MousQUETAiRE {with enonnous mous- 
tachios, enters ; in a stentorian voice). 
Good-morning ! 

(LiSE goes hurriedly to him, toward the 
hack.) 

Cyrano {turning). What is it? 

Ragueneau. a friend of my wife's, — 
a warrior, — terrible, from his own report. 

Cyrano {taking up the pen again, and 
waving Ragueneau away). Hush! . . . 
(To himself.) Write to her, . . . fold the 
letter, . . . hand it to her, . . . and make 
my escape. . . . {Throimng down the pen.) 
Coward ! . . . . But may I perish if I have 
the courage to speak to her, ... to say a 
single word. . , . (Jb Ragueneau.) What 
time is it ? 

Ragueneau. A quarter past six. 

Cyrano (beating his breast). A single 
word of all I carry here ! . . . Whereas 
in writing. . . {He takes up the pen again.) 
Come, let us write it then, in very deed, 
the love-letter I have written in thought so 
many times, I have but to lay my soul be- 
side my paper, and copy !

Enter the poets, clad in black, with hang- 
ing hose, sadly miidsplashed.) 

LiSE {coming forivard, to Ragueneau). 
Here they come, your scarecrows I 

First Poet {entering, to Ragueneau). 
Brother in art ! . . . 

Second Poet {shaking both Ragueneau's 
hands). Dear fellow-bard. . . . 

Third Poet. Eagle of pastrycooks,

Fourth Poet. Phoebus turned baker I 

Fifth Poet. Apollo master-cook ! 

Ragueneau {surrounded, embraced,^ 
shaken by the hand). How at his ease a 
man feels at once with them ! 

First Poet. The reason we are late, is 
the crowd at the Porte de Nesle ! 

Second Poet. Eight ugly ruffians,

Briskly beat to lightness due, 

Eggs, a few; 
With the eggs so beaten, beat — 
Nicely strained for this same use,— 

Lemon-juice, 
Adding milk of almonds, sweet. 

With fine pastry dough, rolled flat, 

After that. 
Line each little scallopped mold ; 
Round the sides, light-fingered, spread 

Marmalade; 
Pour the liquid eggy gold. 

Into each delicious pit ;

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. While you recite your works 
to them, have you a notion how they 
stuff? 

Ragueneau (loiv^ with a smile). Yes, I 
see them . . . without looking, lest they 
should be abashed. I get a double pleasure 
thus from saying my verses over : I satisfy 
a harmless weakness of which I stand con- 
victed, at the same time as giving those 
who have not fed a needed chance to feed I 

Cyrano {slapping him on the shoulder). 
You, ... I like you! (Ragueneau joma 
his friends. Cyrano looks after him ; then^ 
someivhat sharyly.) Hey, Lise ! (Lisk, 
absorbed in tender conversation with the 
Mousquetaire, starts and conies forivard 
toward Cyrano.) Is that captain . . . lay=

Ltis^ (offended). My eyes, sir, have ever

simply returned Cyrano's bow). Really

The Mousquetaire. To his face, indeed \

off. Task folloivs him.)

the door at the right). We shall be much

Welcome! {Approaching the Duenna.) 
Madame, a word with you ! 

The Duenna. A dozen. 

Cyrano. Are you fond of sweets ? 

The Duenna. To the point of indiges- 
tion! 

Cyrano {snatching some paper bags off 
the counter). Good. Here are two son- 
nets of Benserade's. . . 

The Duenna. Pooh! 

Cyrano. Which I fill for you with 
grated almond drops. 

The Duenna {with a different expression). 
Ha! 

Cyrano. Do you look with favor upon 
the cate they call a trifle ? 

The Duenna. I affect it out of measure, 
when it has whipped cream inside. 

Cyrano. Six shall be yours, thrown in 
with a poem by Saint- Amant. And in 
these verses of Chapelain I place this wedge 
of fruit-cake, light by the side of them. . . . 
Oh! And do you like tarts . . . little jam

The Duenna. But . . . 

Cyrano (pushing her out). And do not 
come back till you have finished ! {He closes 
the door upon her, comes foricard toward 
RoxANE, and stands, bareheaded, at a 
respectfid distance.) Blessed forevermore 
among all hours the hour in which, re- 
membering that so lowly a being still 
draws breath, you were so gracious as to 
come to tell me ... to tell me ? . . . 

■RoxANE (ivho has removed her mask). 
First of all, that I thank you. For that 
churl, that coxcomb yesterday, whom you 
taught manners with your sword, is the 
one whom a great nobleman, who fancies 
himself in love with me. . . . 

Cyrano. De Guiche ? 

RoxANE {dropping her eyes). Has tried 
to force upon me as a husband. 

Cyrano. Honorary? {Boiving.) Itj 
appears, then, that I fought, and I am glad 
of it, not for my graceless nose, but youi 
thrice-beautiful eyes.

confession I have in mind to make, I must

brother, with whom as a child I used td 
play, in the park — do you remember ? — by 
the lake ! 

Cyrano. I have not forgotten. Yes . . . 
you came every summer to Bergerac. 

RoxANE. You used to fashion lances out 
of reeds. . . 

Cyrano. The silk of the tasselled com 
furnished hair for your doll . . . 

RoxANE. It was the time of long delight- 
£ul games . . . 

Cyrano. And somewhat sour berries . . , 

RoxANE. The time when you did every- 
thing I bade you ! 

Cyrano. Roxane, wearing short frocks, 
was known as Magdeleine. 

RoxANE. Was I pretty in those days ? 

Cyrano. You were not ill-looking. 

RoxANE. Sometimes, in your venture- 
some climbings you used to hurt yourself. 
You would come running to me, your hand 
bleeding. And, playing at being your 
mamma, I would harden my voice and 
say . . . (She takes his hand.) "Will 
you never keep out of mischief ? " {She 
stops short, amazed.) Oh, it is too muchl 
Here you have done it again! (Cyrano 
tries to draw hack his hand.) No! I-et 
me look at it 1 . . . Aren't you ashamed! 

77 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

A great boy like you ! . . . How did thig 
happen, and where ? 

Cyrano. Oh, fun . . . near the Porte 
de Nesle. 

RoxANE {sitting down at a table and dip- 
ping her handkerchief into a glass oj 
water). Let me have it. 

Cyrano {sitting down too). So prettily, 
so cheeringly maternal ! 

RoxANE. And tell me, while I wash thia 
naughty blood away . . . with how many 
lyere you fighting ? 

Cyrano. Oh, not quite a hundred. 

RoxANE. Tell me about it 

Cyrano. No. What does it matter f 
tou tell me, you . . . what you were going 
to tell me before, and did not dare . . . 

RoxANE {without releasing his hand). I 
do dare, now. I have breathed in courage 
with the perfume of the past. Oh, yes, 
now I dare. Here it is. There is some^ 
one whom I love. 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . 

RoxANE. Oh, he does not know it. 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . 

RoxANE. As yet. ... 

Cyrano. Ah! . . . 

RoxANE. But if he does not know it, he 
3cx)n will.

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . 

RoxANE. A poor boy who until noTP 
has loved me timidly, from a distance, 
without daring to speak. . . . 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . 

RoxANE. No, leave me your hand. It 
is hot, this will cool it. . . But I have 
read his heart in his face. 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . 

RoxANE {completing the bandaging of his 
hand with her small pocket-handkerchief). 
And, cousin, is it not a strange coincidence 
— that he should serve exactly in your 
regiment ! 

Cyrano. Ah ! . . . 

RoxANE (laughing) . Yes. He is a cadet, 
in the same company ! 

Cyrano. Ah! . . . 

RoxANE. He bears plain on his forehead 
the stamp of wit, of genius ! He is proud, 
noble, young, brave, handsome. . . . 

Cyrano {risiJig , pale) . Handsome ! . . 

RoxANE. What . . . what is the mat> 
ter? 

Cyrano. With me? . . . Nothing! . . . 
It is ... it is .. . (Shoiving his hand, 
smiling.) You know! ... It smarts a 
little . . . 

BoxANE. In short, I love him. I must

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

tell you, however, that I have never seen 
him save at the play. 

Cyrano. Then you have never spoken 
to each other ? 

RoxANE. Only with our eyes. 

Cyrano. But, then . . . how can you 
know ? . . . 

RoxANE. Oh, under the lindens of Place 
Royale, people will talk. A trustworthy 
gossip told me many things ! 

Cyrano. A cadet, did you say ? 

RoxANE. A cadet, in your company. 

Cyrano. His name ? 

RoxANE. Baron Christian de Neuvil- 
lette. 

Cyrano. What ? He is not in the cadets. 

RoxANE. He is ! He certainly is, since 
morning. Captain Carbon de Castel- 
Jaloux. 

Cyrano. And quickly, quickly, she 
throws away her heart ! . . . But my poor 
little girl . . .

barian ! 

EoxANE. No! no! . . . He has hair like 
one of D'Urfe's heroes! 

Cyrano. If he had on proof as homely 
a wit as he has pretty hair 1 

RoxANE. No! No! ... I can see at a 
single glance, his utterances are fine, 
pointed . . . 

Cyrano. Ah, yes! A man's utterances 
are invariably like his moustache! . . . 
Still, if he we7'e a ninny ? . . . 

EoxANE {stamping ivith her foot). I 
should die, there! 

Cyrano (after a time). You bade me 
come here that you might tell me this ? I 
scarcely see the appropriateness, Madame. 

Roxane. Ah, it was because someone 
yesterday let death into my soul by telling 
me that in your company you are all Gas- 
cons, ... all! 

Cyrano. And that we pick a quarrel 
with every impudent fledgling, not Gas- 
con, admitted by favor to our thorough- 
bred Gascon ranks ? That is what you 
heard ? 

RoxANE. Yes, and you can imagine how 
distracted I am for him ! 

Cyrano (m his teeth) . You well may bel

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoxANE. But I thought, yesterday^ 
when you towered up, great and invincible, 
giving his due to that miscreant, standing 
your ground against those caitiffs, I thought 
"Were he but willing, he of whom all are 
in awe ..." 

Cyrano. Very well, I will protect your 
little baron. 

RoxANE. Ah, you will . . . you will 
protect him for me ? . . . I have always 
felt for you the tenderest regard ! 

Cyrano. Yes, yes. 

RoxANE. You will be his friend ? 

Cyrano. I will! 

RoxANE. And never shall he have to 
fight a duel ? 

Cyrano. I swear it. 

RoxANE. Oh, I quite love you! . . . 
Now I must go. {She hurriedly resumes 
her mask^ throws a veil over her head ; says 
absentmindedly) . But you have not yet 
told me about last night's encounter. It 
must have been amazing ! . . . Tell him to 
write to me. (She kisses her hand to him.] 
I love you dearly ! 

Cyrano. Yes, yes. 

RoxANE. A hundred men against you 1 
« . . Well, adieu. We are fast friends. 

Cyrano. Yes, yes.

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

EoXANE. Tell him to write me ! ... A 
hundred men ! You shall tell me another 
time. I must not linger now ... A hun- 
dred men ! What a heroic thing to do ! 

Cyrano (bowing). Oh, I have done 
better since ! 

{Exit RoxANE. Cyrano stands motion- 
less^ staring at the ground. Silence. The 
door at the right opens. Ragueneau 
thrusts in his head.) 

Kagneneau. May we come back ? 

Cyrano (without moving). Yes. . . 

(Ragueneau beckons., hisfinends come in 
again. At the same time, in the doorway 
at the back, appears Carbon de Castel- 
Jaloux, costume of a Captain of the 
Guards. On seeing Cyrano, he gesticulates 
exaggeratedly by way of signal to some- 
one out of sight). 

Carbon de Castel-Jaloux. He is here I

Carbon de Castel-Jaloux (exultant). 
Hero! We know all ! . . . About thirty

Le Bret {entering, running to Cyrano). 
They are looking for you! A crowd, gone 
mad as March, led by those who were with 
you last night. 

Cyrano {alarmed) . You never told them 
where to find me ? . . . 

Le Bret (rubbing his hands). I did. 

A Burgher (entering, followed by a 
number of others). Monsieur, the Marais

Cyrano cannot repress^ the croivd draws 
away. De Guiche appears^ escorted by 
officers; among them Cuigy, Brissaille, 
those who followed Cyrano at the end 
of the first act. Cuigy hurries toward 
Cyrano.) 

Cuigy {to Cyrano) . Monsieur de Guiche ! 
{Murmurs. Every one draws hack). He 
comes at the request of the Marshal de 
G-aussion. 

De Guiche (boicing to Cyrano). Who 
wishes to express his admiration for your 
latest exploit, the fame of which has 
reached him. 

The Crowd. Bravo ! 
Cyrano {boicing). The Marshal is quali- 
fied to judge of courage. 

De Guiche. He would scarcely have 
believed the report, had these gentlemen

deed performed.

De Guiche {in whose ear Cuigy has been 
whispering). But this is by no means the 
first gallant achievement marking your 
career. You serve in the madcap Gascon 
company, do you not ? 

Cyrano. In the cadets, yes. 

One of the Cadets (in a great voice). 
Among his countrymen !

line behind Cyraso). Ah, ha!— All these 
gentlemen then of the formidable aspect,

Famed fighters, liars, desperates, 

They are the Gascony Cadets ! 

All, better-born than pickpockets, 

Talk couchant, rampant, . . . pendent,

De Guiche {nonchalantly seated in an 
armchair which Ragueneau has hurriedly 
brought for hi7n). A gentleman provides 
himself to-day, by way of luxury, with a 
poet. May I look upon you as mine ? 

Cyrano. No, your lordship, as nobody's. 

De Guiche. My uncle Richelieu yester- 
day found your spontaneity diverting. I 
shall be pleased to be of use to you with 
him. 

Le Bret {dazzled). Great God! 

De Guiche. I cannot think I am wrong 
in supposing that you have rhymed a 
tragedy? 

Le Bret {ivhispering to Cyrano). My 
boy, your Agrippina will be played ! 

De Guiche. Take it to him. . . . 

Cyrano {tempted and pleased). 
Really . . . 

De Guiche. He has taste in such

matters. He will no more than, here and 
there, alter a word, recast a passage. . . . 

Cyrano {ivhoseface has instantly dark- 
ened). Not to be considered, monsieur ! 
My blood runs cold at the thought of a 
single comma added or suppressed. 

De Guiche. On the other hand, my dear 
sir, when a verse finds favor with him, he 
pays for it handsomely. 

Cyrano. He scarcely can pay me as I 
pay myself, when I have achieved a verse 
to my liking, by singing it over to myself! 

De Guiche. You are proud. 

Cyrano. You have observed it ? 

One op the Cadets (coining in icith a 
number of disreputable, draggled tattered 
hats threaded on his sicordJ). Look, 
Cyrano ! at the remarkable feathered game 
we secured this morning near the Porte de 
Nesle ! The hats of the fugitives ! 

Carbon de Castel-Jaloux. Spolice 
opimce ! 

All {laughing). Ha! Ha! Ha! . . . 

CuiGY. The one who planned that mili- 
tary action, my word! must be proud of 
it to-day! 

Brissaille. Is it known who did it ? 

De Guiche. I! — {The laughter stops 
short)' They had instructions to chastise

The Cadet (under breath, to Cyrano, in- 
dicating the hats). What can we do with 
them ? They are oily. . . . Make them 
into a hotch pot ? 

Cyrano {taking the sivord ivith the hats^ 
and bowing, as he shakes them off at Dn 
Quiche's feet). Monsieur, if you should 
care to return them to your friends ? . . .

The chair is at the door ! 

De Guiche. The chapter of the wind 
mills. 

Cyrano (bowing). Chapter thirteen.

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche. For when a man attacks 
them, it often happens. . . . 

Cyrano. I have attacked, am I to in- 
fer, a thing that veers with every wind? 

De Guiche. That one of their far-reach- 
ing canvas arms pitches him down into 
the mud ! 

Cyrano. Or up among the stars ! 

(Exit De Guiche. He is seeyi getting 
into his chair. The gentlemen withdraw 
whispering. Le Bret goes to the door ivith 
them. The crowd leaves. The Cadets re- 
main seated at the right and left at tables 
ivherefood and drink is brought to them). 

Cyrano (boiving icith a derisive air to 
those who leave without daring to take leave 
of him). Gentlemen . . . gentlemen . , . 
gentlemen. . . . 

Le Bret {coming forward, greatly dis- 
tressed, lifting his hands to Heaven). Oh, 
in what a pretty pair of shoes. . . . 

Cyrano. Oh, you! ... I expect you 
to grumble ! 

Le Bret. But yourself, you will agree 
with me that invariably to cut the throat 
of opportunity becomes an exaggera^ 
tion ! . . . 

Cyrano. Yes. I agree. I do exagger* 
ate. 

93 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret {triumphant). You see, you 
admit it ! . . . 

Cyrano. But for the sake of principle, 
and of example, as well, I think it a good 
thing to exaggerate as I do ! 

Le Bret. Could you but leave apart, 
once in a while, your mousquetaire of a 
soul, fortune, undoubtedly, fame. . . . 

Cyrano. And what should a man do ? 
Seek some grandee, take him for patron, 
and like the obscure creeper clasping a 
tree-trunk, and licking the bark of that 
which props it up, attain to height by craft 
instead of strength? No, I thank you. 
Dedicate, as they all do, poems to finan- 
ciers ? Wear motley in the humble hope 
of seeing the lips of a minister distend for 
once in a smile not ominous of ill ? No, I 
thank you. Eat every day a toad ? Be 
threadbare at the belly with groveling ? 
Have his skin dirty soonest at the knees ? 
Practice feats of dorsal elasticity ? No, I 
thank you. With one hand stroke the 
goat while with the other he waters the 
cabbage ? Make gifts of senna that counter- 
gifts of rhubarb may accrue, and indefa- 
tigably swing his censer in some beard I 
Vo, I thank you. Push himself from lap to

'circle, propel his ship with madrigals for 
oars and in his sails the sighs of the elderly 
ladies ? No, I thank you. Get the good 
editor Sercy to print his verses at proper 
expense ? No, I thank you. Contrive to 
be nominated Pope in conclaves held by 
imbeciles in wineshops ? No, I thank you. 
Work to construct a name upon the basis 
of a sonnet, instead of constructing other 
sonnets ? No, I thank you. Discover 
talent in tyros, and in them alone ? Stand 
in terror of what gazettes may please to 
say, and say to himself "At whatever 
cost, may I figure in the Paris Mercury ! "

it happen that to some small extent he 
triumph, be obliged to render of the glory, 
to Caesar, not one jot, but honestly appro- 
priate it all. In short, scorning to be the 
parasite, the creeper, if even failing to be 
the oak, rise, not perchance to a great 
height, . . . but rise alone ! 

Le Bret. Alone ? Good ! but not one 
against all ! How the devil did you con- 
tract the mania that possesses you for 
making enemies, always, everywhere ? 

CyRiVNO. By seeing you make friends, 
and smile to those same flocks of friends 
with a mouth that takes for model an old 
purse ! I wish not to be troubled to return 
bows in the street, and I exclaim with 
glee "An enemy the more! " 

Le Bret. This is mental aberration ! 

Cyrano. I do not dispute it. I am so 
framed. To displease is my pleasure. I 
love that one should hate me. Dear friend, 
if you but knew how much better a man 
walks under the exciting fire of hostile 
eyes, and how amused he may become 
over the spots on his doublet, spattered by 
Envy and Cowardice ! . . . You, the facile 
Criendship wherewith you surround your- 
•»elf, resembles those wide Italian collars,

loose and easy, with a perforated pattern, 
in which the neck looks like a woman's. 
They are more comfortable, but of less 
high effect ; for the brow not held in proud 
position by any constraint from them, falls 
to nodding this way and that. . . . But 
for me every day Hatred starches and flutes 
the ruff whose stiffness holds the head well 
in place. Every new enemy is another 
plait in it, adding compulsion, but adding, 
as well, a ray: for, similar in every point 
to the Spanish ruff. Hatred is a bondage, 
, . . but is a halo, too ! 

Le Bret {after a pause, slipping his arm 
through Cyrano's) . To the hearing of all 
be proud and bitter, . . , but to me, below 
breath, say simply that she does not love 
you! 

Cyrano (sharply). Not a word! 

(Christian has come in and mingled tvith 
the cadets ; they ignore him ; he has finally 
gone to a little table by himself, where LiSE 
waits on him.) 

One of the Cadets (seated at a table at 
the back, glass in hand). Hey, Cyrano! 
(Cyrano turns toward him) . Your story ! 

Cyrano. Presently! (He goes toward 
the back on Le Bret's arm. TJiey talk 
low.)

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

The Cadet (rising and coming toward 
the front) . The account of your fight ! It 
will be the best lesson (stopping in front of 
the table at which Christian is sitting) for 
this timorous novice ! 

Ckristia^ (looking up). . . . Novice? 

Other Cadet. Yes, sickly product o\ 
the North! 

Christian. Sickly ? 

First Cadet (impressively) . Monsieur d^ 
Neuvillette, it is a good deed to warn you 
that there is a thing no more to be men- 
tioned in our company than rope in the 
house of the hanged ! 

Christian. And what is it ? 

Other Cadet (in a terrifying voice). 
Look at me! (TJiree times, darkly, h6 
places his finger upon his nose.) You have 
understood ? 

Christian. Ah, it is the . . . 

Other Cadet. Silence! . . . Never must 
you so much as breathe that word, or . . . 
(He points toward Cyrano at the back talk 
ing with Le Bret.) You will have him, 
over there, to deal with!

turned toivard the first, has noiselessly 
seated himself on the table behind him). 
Two persons were lately cut off in theil

pride by him for talking through their 
noses. He thought it personal. 

Other Cadet (in a cavernous voice^ as 
he 7Hses from under the table ichere he had 
slipped on all fours). Not the remotest 
allusion, ever, to the fatal cartilage, . . . 
unless you fancy an early grave ! 

Other Cadet. A word will do the busi- 
ness ! What did I say? . . . A word? . . . 
A simple gesture! Make use of your 
pocket-handkerchief, you will shortly have 
use for your shroud ! 

{Silence. All around Christian ivatch 
him., with folded arms. He rises and goes 
to Carbon de Castel- Jaloux, who. in con- 
versation with an officer., affects to notice 
nothing). 

Christian. Captain ! 

Carbon {turning and looking him rather 
contemptuously up anddoivn). Monsieur? 

Christian. What is the proper course 
for a man when he finds gentlemen of the 
South too boastful ? 

Carbon de Castel-Jaloux. He must 
prove to them that one can be of the North, 
yet brave. {He turns his back upon him.) 

Christian. I am mu^ch obliged. 

First Cadet {to Cyrano). And now, the 
tale of your adventure ! 

99 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

All. Yes, yes, now let us hear ! 

Cyrano {coming forward among them). 
My adventure ? (All draw their stools 
nearer, and sit around him, with craned 
necks. Christian sits astride a chair.) 
Well, then, I was marching to meet them. 
The moon up in the skies was shining 
like a silver watch, when suddenly I know 
not what careful watch-maker having 
wrapped it in a cottony cloud, there oc- 
curred the blackest imaginable night ; 
and, the streets being nowise lighted, — 
mordious ! — you could see no further 
than . . . 

Christian. Your nose. 

{Silence. Evei^yone slowly gets up ; all 
look with terror at Cyrano. He has 
stopped short, amazed. Pause.) 

Cyrano. Who is that man ? 

One of the Cadets (low). He joined 
this morning. 

Cyrano {taking a step toward Christian). 
This morning ? 

Carbon de Castel Jaloux (lotv). His 
name is Baron de Neuvill .... 

Cyrano {stopping short). Ah, very 
well. . . . (He turns pale, then red, gives 
evidence of another impulse to throw him- 
%elf upon Christian.) I. . . . {He con

quers it, and says in a stifled voice.) Very 
well. {He takes up his tale.) As I was 
saying . . . {ivith a burst of rage.) Mor- 
dious! . . . {He continues in a natural 
tone) one could not see in the very least. 
{Consternation. All resume their seats, 
staring at one another.) And I was walk- 
ing along, reflecting that for a very in- 
significant rogue I was probably about to 
offend some great prince who would bear 
me a lasting grudge, that, in brief, I was 
about to thrust my . . . 

Christian. Nose . . . 

{All get up. Christian has tilted his 
chair and is rocking on the hind legs.) 

Cyrano {choking). Finger . . . between 
the tree and the bark ; for the aforesaid 
prince might be of sufficient power to tri^ 
me and throw me . . . 

Christian. On my nose . . . 

Cyrano {wipes the sweat from hishrow.) 
But, said I, " Gascony forward ! Never 
falter when duty prompts! Forward, 
Cyrano ! " and, saying this, I advance — • 
when suddenly, in the darkness, I barely 
avoid a blow . . . 

Christian. Upon the nose . . . 

Cyrano. I ward it. . . . and thereupon 
find myself . . .

^Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Christian. Nose to nose . . . 

Cyrano {springing toward him), Ven> 
tr e- Saint- Gr is! . . . {All the Gascons 
rush forward, to see ; Cyrano, on reaching 
Christian, controls himself and proceeds) 
. . . with a hundred drunken brawlers, 
smelling . . . 

Christian. To the nose's limit . . . 

Cyrano {deathly pale, and smiling) . . . 
of garlic and of grease. I leap forward, 
head lowered . . . 

Christian. Nose to the wind ! . . . 

Cyrano. And I charge them. I knock 
two breathless and run a third through the 
body. One lets off at me: Paf I and I re- 
tort . . . 

Christian. Pif ! 

Cryano {exploding). Death and damna. 
tion ! Go, — all of you ! 

{All the Cadets make for the door.) 

First Cadet. The tiger is roused at 
last! 

Cyrano. All! and leave me with thia 
man. 

Second Cadet. Bigre! When we sea 
him again, it will be in the shape of mince- 
meat! 

Ragueneau. Mince-meat ? . . . 

Other Cadet. In one of your pies. 

102 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Ragueneau. I feel myself grow white 
and flabby as a table-napkin ! 

Carbon de Castel-Jaloux. Let us 
go! 

Other Cadet. Not a smudge of him 
will be left I 

Other Cadet. What these walls are 
about to behold gives me gooseflesh to 
think upon! 

Other Cadet (closing the door at the 
right). Ghastly! . . . Ghastly! 

(All have left, by the back or the sides, a 
few up the stairway. Cyrano and Chris- 
tian remain face to face, and look at each 
other a moment.) 

Cyrano. Embrace me I 

Christian. Monsieur . . . 

Cyrano. Brave fellow. 

Christian. But what does this . . . 

Cyrano. Very brave fellow. I wish 
you to. 

Christian. Will you tell me ? . . . 

Cyrano. Embrace me, I am her brother. 

Christian. Whose ? 

Cyrano. Hers ! 

Christian. What do you mean ? 

Cyrano. Eoxane's! 

Christian {running to him). Heavens! 
You, her brother ? 

103 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. Or the same thing: her first 
cousin. 

Christian. And she has . . . 

Cyrano. Told me everything! 

Christian. Does she love me ? 

Cyrano. Perhaps! 

Christian {seizing his hands). How 
happy I am, monsieur, to make your ao- 
quaintance! . . . 

Cyrano. That is what I call a sudden 
sentiment ! 

Christian. Forgive me ! . . . 

Cyrano {looking at him, laying his hand 
upon his shoulder). It is true that he is 
handsome, the rascal ! 

Christian. If you but knew, Monsieur, 
how greatly I admire you ! . . . 

Cyrano. But all those noses which 
you . . . 

Christian. I take them back ! 

Cyrano. Roxane expects a letter to« 
night . . . 

Christian. Alas I 

Cyrano. What is the matter ? 

Christian. I am lost if I cease to be 
dumb I 

Cyrano. How is that ? 

Christian. Alas! I am such a dunce 
(hat I could kill myself for shame I 
104 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. But, no . . . no. . . . You oxt 
Burely not a dunce, if you believe you are! 
Besides, you scarcely attacked me like a 
dunce. 

Christian. Oh, it is easy to find words 
Cn mounting to the assault ! Indeed, I own 
to a certain cheap military readiness, but 
when I am before women, I have not a 
Word to say. . . . Yet their eyes, when 1 
pass by, express a kindness toward me . . . 

Cyrano. And do their hearts not ex- 
press the same when you stop beside them? 

Christian. No! . . . for I am of those 
—I recognize it, and am dismayed ! — who 
do not know how to talk of love. 

Cyrano. Tiensf ... It seems to me 
that if Nature had taken more pains with 
my shape, I should have been of those who 
do know how to talk of it. 

Christian. Oh, to be able to express 
things gracefully ! 

Cyrano. Oh, to be a graceful little 
figure of a passing mousquetaire ! 

Christian. Boxane is a precieuse, . . . 
there is no chance but that I shall be a 
disillusion to Roxane! 

Cyrano (looking at Christian) . If I had, 
to express my soul, such an interpro- 
lert ...

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Christian {desperately) . I ought to have 
eloquence ! . . . 

Cyrano (abruptly). Eloquence I will 
lend you I . . . And you, to me, shall lend 
all-conquering physical charm . . . and 
between us we will compose a hero of 
romance I 

Christian. What ? 

Cyrano. Should you be able to say. 
as your own, things which I day by day 
would teach you ? 

Christian. You are suggesting ? . . . 

Cyrano. Roxane shall not have disil* 
Aisions! Tell me, shall we win her heart, 
we two as one ? will you submit to feel, 
transmitted from my leather doublet into 
your doublet stitched with silk, the soul I 
wish to share ? 

Christian. But Cyrano! . . . 

Cyrano. Christian, will you ? 

Christian. You frighten me ! 

Cyrano. Since you fear, left to yourself, 
to chill her heart, will you consent, — and 
soon it will take fire, I vouch for it! — 
to contribute your lips to my phrases ? 

Christian. Your eyes shine ! . . . 

Cyrano. Will you ? 

Christian. What, would it please you 
60 much ?

a poet. Will you complete me, and let me 
in exchange complete you ? We will walk

you, to me, shall be good looks ! 

Christian. But the letter, which should 
be sent to her without delay ? . . . Never 
snail I be able . . . 

Cyrano {taking from his doublet the 
letter written in the first part of the act). 
The letter ? Here it is 1

Cyrano. It only wants the address. 

Christian. I . . . 

Cyrano. You can send it without un^

very little). Nothing more. . . . The still-

ACT THIRD. 

roxane's kiss. 

A small square in the old Marais. Old- 
fashioned houses. Narrow streets seen in 
perspective. At the right, Roxane's hous6 
and the wall of her garden, above which 
spreading tree-tops. Over the house-door, 
a balcony and window. A bench beside 
the doorstep. 

The wall is overclambered by ivy, the 
balcony wreathed unth jasmine. 

By means of the bench and projecting 
stones in the wall, the balcony can easily 
he scaled. 

On the opposite side, old house in the 
same style of architecture, brick and stone, 
with entrance-door. The door-hnocker is 
swaddled in linen. 

At the rise of the curtain, the Duenna is. 
seated on the bench. The window on 
Roxane's balcony is wide open. 

Ragueneau, in a sort of livery, stands 
near the Duenna ; he is finishing the tale of 
his misfortu7i^s, drying his eyes. 

ITO 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Ragueneau. And then, she eloped with 
a mousquetaire ! Ruined, forsaken, I was 
hanging myself. I had already taken leave 
of earth, when Monsieur de Bergerac 
happening along, unhanged me, and pro- 
posed me to his cousin as her steward. . . 

The Duenna. But how did you fall into 
such disaster ? 

Ragueneau. Lise was fond of soldiers, 
I, of poets ! Mars ate up all left over by 
Apollo. Under those circumstances, you 
conceive, the pantry soon was bare. 

The Duenna {rising and calling toward 
the open windoiv). Roxane, are you 
ready ? . . . They are waiting for us ! . . . 

Roxane's Voice {through the window). 
I am putting on my mantle ! 

The Duenna {to Ragueneau, pointing at 
the door opposite). It is over there, op- 
posite, we are expected. At Clomire's. 
She holds a meeting in her little place. A 
disquisition upon the Softer Sentiments is 
to be read. 

Ragueneau. Upon the Softer Senti- 
ments ? 

The Duenna {coyly). Yes ! . . . {Calh 
ing toward the window.) Roxane, you 
must make haste, or we shall miss the dis' 
%uisition upon the Softer Sentiments I

drawing nearer.) 

Cyrano's Voice (singing in the wings)* 
La ! la! la! la! la! .... 

The Duenna (surprised). We are to 
have music ? 

Cyrano (enters followed by two Pages 
with theorbos) . I tell you it is a demi-semi- 
quaver ! . . . you demi-semi-noddle ! 

First Page (ironically) . Monsieur know% 
then about quavers, semi and demi ? 

Cyrano. I know music, as do all Gas« 
gendi's disciples ! 

The Page (playing and singing). La f 
la ! 

CyraNO (snatching the theorbo from Mm 
and continuing the musical phrase) . I can 
carry on the melody. . . . La, la, la, la, . . . 

Roxane (appearing on the balcony), ft

Cyrano (singing upon the tune he is con* 
tinning). I, mdeed, who salute youi?

ro-o-oses ! . . . 

Roxane. I am coming down 1 {She 
leaves the balcony.) 

The Duenna (pointing at the Pages). 
What is the meaning of these two virtuosi \ 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. A wager I won, from D'As* 
Boucy. We were disputing upon a question 
of grammar. Yes ! No ! Yes ! No ! Sud-

expert at clawing strings, by whom ha

wager a day long of music ! " He lost. 
Until therefore the next rise of the sun, 
I shall have dangling after me these arch- 
lute players, harmonious witnesses of all 
I do ! ... At first I liked it very well, 
but now it palls a little. {To the musi- 
cians) . Hey f . . . Go, from me, to Mont-

Sometimes he is of an absent mood, hia

Cyrano {incredulous). Come! . . . 

EoxANE. Oh, it is too bad ! Men are all 
alike, narrow, narrow: because he is hand- 
some, he cannot possibly be witty ! 

Cyrano. So he talks of the heart in ac- 
ceptable fashion ? 

EoxANE. Talks, cousin, is feeble. . . , 
He dissertates! 

Cyrano. And writes ? . . . 

RoxANE. Still better! Listen now td

Well ? . . . 

Cyrano. Pooh! 

RoxANE. And to this : ' ' Since you hav6 
stolen my heart., and since I must suffer ^ 
to suffer with send me your own ! " 

Cyrano. Now he has too much heart, 
now he has not enough, . . . just what 
does he want, in the matter of quantity ? 

RoxANE. You vex me ! You are eaten 
up with jealousy. . . . 

Cyrano {starting) . Heir ?

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoXANE. Author's jealousy! And this, 
could anything be more exquisitely tender ? 
*' Unanimously, believe it, my heart cries 
out to you, and if kisses could be sent in 
writing, Love, you should read my letter 
with your lips. . . .

satisfaction). Ha ! Ha ! Those particular 
lines seem to me . . . ho ! . . . ho ! . . .

RoxANE. In this art of expressing love 
he is a master ! 

Cyrano {modest). Oh, ... a master ! 

RoxANE {peremptory). A master ! 

Cyrano. As you please, then ... a

ward the house). Go in ! It is perhaps 
better that he should not see you here ! it 
might put him on the scent . . .

Cyrano de Befgerac. 

ROXANE {to Cyrano). Yes, of my deal 
secret I He loves me, he is powerful, . . . 
he must not find out I He might cut in 
sunder our loves . . . with an axe ! 

Cyrano {going into the house). Very 
well, very well. 

(De Guiche appears.) 

RoxANE {to De Guiche, with a curtsey). 
I was leaving the house. 

De Guiche. I have come to bid you 
farewell. 

RoxANE. You are going away ? 

De Guiche. To war. 

RoxANE. Ah ! 

De Guiche. I have my orders. Arraa 
is besieged. 

RoxANE. Ah ! ... it is besieged ? 

De Guiche. Yes. ... I see that my 
departure does not greatly affect you, 

RoxANE. Oh! . . . 

De Guiche. As for me, I own it wrings 
my heart. Shall I see you again ? . . . 
When ? . . . You know that I am made 
commander-in-general ? 

RoxANK {uninterested). I congratulate 
you. 

De Guiche. Of the Guards. 

RoxANE {starting). Ah, ... of ttie 
Guards?

\ Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche. Among whom your cousin 
Berves, . . . the man of the boasts and 
tirades. I shall have opportunity in 
plenty to retaliate upon him down there. 

RoxANE {suffocatmg) . What ? The 
Guards are going down there ? 

De Guiche. Surely. It is my regiment. 

RoxANE (falls sitting upon the bench ; 
aside). Christian I 

De Guiche. What is it troubles you ? 

RoxANE {gi^eatly moved). This depart- 
ure . , . grieves me mortally. When one 
cares for a person ... to know him away 
at the war I 

De Guiche (sicrprised and charmed). 
For the first time you utter a kind and feel 
ing word, when I am leaving ! 

RoxANE {in a different tone, fanning her- 
self). So . . . you are thinking of re- 
venge upon my cousin ? 

De Guiche {smiling). You side with 
Jteim ? 

Roxane. No . . . against him. 

De Guiche. Do you see much of him \ 

Roxane. Very little. 

De Guiche. He is everywhere to be 
met with one of the cadets . . . {tryiiig tn

RoxANE. A tall man ? 

De Guiche. Light haired. 

RoxANE. Red haired. 

De Guiche. Good looking. 

RoxANE. Pooh ! 

De Guiche. But a fool I 

RoxANE. He looks like one. {In a dif 
f event tone.) Your vengeance upon Cyranc 
is then to place him within reach of shot^ 
which is the thing of all he loves \ . , , A 
miserable vengeance ! . . . I know, I do, 
what would more seriously concern him * 

De Guiche. And that is ? 

RoxANE. Why . . . that the regiment 
fthould march, and leave him behind, with 
his beloved cadets, arms folded, the whole 
war through, in Paris ! That is the only 
way to cast down a man like him. You 
wish to punish him ? Deprive him ot 
danger. 

De Guiche. A woman I A woman I 
None but a woman could devise a ven« 
geance of the sort I 

RoxANE. His friends will gnaw their 
fists, and he his very soul, with chagrin 
at not being under fire ; and you will be 
abundantly avenged I 

De Guiche {coming nearer). Then you da 
love me a little ? (Roxane smiles.) I wisli 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

to see in this fact of your espousing my 
grudge a proof of affection, Roxane . . . 

EoxANE. . . . You may ! 

De Guiche {shoiving several folded 
papers). I have here upon me the orders 
to be transmitted at once to each of the 
companies . . . except . . . {lie takes one 
from among the others.) This one ! . . . 
the company of the cadets . . . {He puts it 
in his pocket.) This, I will keep. (Laugh- 
i7ig). Ah, ah, ah ! Cyrano ! his belligerent 
humor! . . . So you sometimes play tricks 
upon people, you ? . . , 

BoxANE. Sometimes. 

De Guiche {very near her). I love you 
to distraction ! This evening . . . listen, 
... it is true that I must be gone. But 
to g3 when I feel that it is a matter for 
your caring ! Listen ! . . . There is, not 
far from here, in Rue Orleans, a convent 
founded by the Capuchins. Father Atha- 
nasius. A layman may not enter. But the 
good fathers ... I fear no difficulty with 
them! They will hide me up their sleeve 
. . . their sleeve is wide. They are the 
Capuchins that serve Richelieu at home. 
Fearing the uncle, they proportionately 
fear the nephew. I shall be thought to 
bave left. I will come to you masked*

Let me delay by a single day, wayward 
enchantress ! 

RoxANE. But if it should transpire . . . 
your fame . . . 

De Guiche. Bah ! 

RoxANE. But ... the siege ... Ar- 
ras I . . . 

De Guiche. Must wait I Allow me, I

Roxane. No! 

De Guiohe. I beseech ! 

Roxane {tenderly). No! Love itself

De Guiche. Ah I 

Roxane. You must go! {Aside.) Chris 
tian will stay ! {Aloud.) For my sake, be 
heroic . . . Antony! 

De Guiche. Ah, heavenly word upon 
your lips! . . . Then you love the one 
who . . . 

Roxane. Who shall have made me 
tremble for his sake . . . 

De Guiche {in a transport of joy). Ah, 
£ will go ! {He hisses her hand.) Are you 
satisfied with me ? 

Roxane. My friend, I am. 

{Exit De Guiche). 

The Duenna {dropping a mocking curtesy 
toward his back). My friend, we are ! 

I.90 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoxANE {to the Duenna). Not a word of 
what I have done: Cyrano would never 
forgive me for defrauding him of his warl 
{She calls toward the house.) Cousin! 
(Cyrano comes out.) We are going to 
Clomire's. (She indicates the house op 
posite.) Alcandre has engaged to speak, 
and so has Lysimon. 

The Duenna {putting her little fi^iger to 
her ear) . Yes, but my little finger tells me 
that we shall be too late to hear them ! 

Cyrano (to Roxane). Of all things do 
tiot miss the trained monkeys !

The Duenna. Seel . . . See! thej^have

softly).

Forward! Free rein! No curb! Improvise! 
Talk of love ! Be magnificent ! 

Cyrano {smiling). Good. 

RoxANE. Hush I 

Cyrano. Hush I 

RoxANE. Not a word ! {She goes in an^

Christian. No, I will await Eoxane

Cyrano. What insanity possesses you t 
Come quickly and learn . . . 

Christian. No, I tell you ! I am weary 
of borrowing my letters, my words . . . 
of playing a part, and living in constant 
fear. ... It was very well at first, but 
now I feel that she loves me. I thank you 
heartily. I am no longer afraid. I will 
Bpeak for myself . . . 

Cyrano. Ouais ? . . . 

Christian. And what tells you that I

utter blockhead, after all! You shall seel 
Your lessons have not been altogethei

Christian. Christian I 

RoxANE {disdainfully). Oh, you I 

Christian. I wish to speak with you. 

Cyrano {under the balcony^ to Chris 
KAN). Speak lowl . , . 

RoxANE. No, your conversation is too 
common. You may go home I 

Christian. In mercy I . . . 

RoxANE. No . . . you do not love me 
any morel 

Christian (i^/iom Cyrano is prompting). 
You accuse me . . . just Heaven I of lov- 
ing you no more. . . . when I can lova 
you no more! 

RoxANE {who was about to close her win- 
dow, stopping). Ah, that is a little better I 

Christian {same business). To what 
a . . . size has Love grown in my . . . 
Bigh-rocked soul which the . . . cruel 
cherub has chosen for his cradle ! 

Roxane {stepping nearer to the edge of 
the balcony). That is distinctly better I , . 
But, since he is so cruel, this Cupid, you 
were unwise not to smother him in hia 
cradle ! 

Christian {same business). I tried to, 
but, Madame, the . . . attempt was f utila

KoxANE (leaning Tier elbows on the bah 
cony -rail). Ah, that is very good 
indeed! . . . But why do you speak so 
slowly and stintedly ? Has your imagin« 
ation gout in its wings ? 

Cyrano {drawing Christian under th\ 
balcony^ and taking his place). Hush! It 
is becoming too difficult! 

Roxane. To-night your w^ords com© 
falteringly. . . . Why is it ? 

Cyrano {talking loio like Christian). 
Because of the dark. They have to gi'ope 
to find your ear. 

RoxANE. My words do not find the 
same difficulty. 

Cyrano. They reach their point at 
once ? Of course they do ! That is because 
I catch them with my heart. My heart, 
you see, is very large, your ear particularly 
email. . . . Besides, your words drop . , • 
that goes quickly ; mine have to climb • • « 
and that takes longer I 

189 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

KoxANE. They have been climbing mor* 
nimbly, however, in the last few minutes. 

Cyrano. They are becoming used to 
this gymnastic feat! 

RoxANE. It is true that I am talking 
with you from a very mountain top ! 

Cyrano. It is sure that a hard word 
dropped from such a height upon my heart 
would shatter it I 

RoxANE {ivWi tlie motion of leaving). I 
will come down. 

Cyhano iquicMy). Do not! 

RoxANE {pointing at the bench at the foot 
of the balcony). Then do you get up on 
the seat! . . . 

Cyrano {drawing away in terror). Noi' 

RoxANE. How do you mean . . . no ? 

Cyrano {with ever-iyicreasing emotion). 
Let us profit a little by this chance of talk- 
mg softly together without seeing each 
other . . . 

RoxANE. Without seeing each 
other? . . . 

Cyrano. Yes, to my mind, delectable 1 
Each guesses at the other, and no more.

never know what these moments are to 
me ! If ever I was eloquent . . . 

RoXANE. You were ! 

Cyrano. My words never till now surged 
from my very heart . . . 

RoxANE. And why ? 

Cyrano. Because, till now, they must 
jtrain to reach you through . . . 

RoxANE. What ? 

Cyrano. Why, the bewildering emotion 
a man feels who sees you, and whom you 
look upon ! . . . But this evening, it 
eeems to me that I am speaking to you for 
the first time ! 

RoxANE. It is true that your voice is 
altogether different. 

Cyrano {coming nearer , feverishly). Yes, 
altogether different, because, protected by 
the dark, I dare at last to be myself. I 
dare . . . (He stops, and distractedly.) 
What was I saying ? ... I do not know. 

. . All this . . . forgive my incoherence ! 
... is so delicious ... is so new to me ! 

RoxANE. So new ? . . . 

Cyrano (ni extreme confusion, still try- 
ing to mend his expressions) . So new . . . 
yes, new, to be sincere ; the fear of being 
mocked always constrains my heart . . . 

Eoxane. Mocked ... for what ? 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. Why, . . . for its impulses, ita 
flights ! . . . Yes, my heart always 
cowers behind the defence of my wit. 1 
set forth to capture a star . . . and then, 
for dread of laughter, I stop and pick e 
flower ... of rhetoric ! 

RoxANE. That sort of flower has its 
pleasing points . . . 

Cyrano. But yet, to-night, let us scorn 
it! 

RoxANE. Never before had you spoken 
as you are speaking ! . . . 

Cyrano. Ah, if far from Cupid-darts 
and quivers, we might seek a place of 
somewhat fresher things ! If instead of 
drinking, flat sip by sip, from a chiselled 
golden thimble, drops distilled and dulci- 
fled, we might try the sensation of quench- 
ing the thirst of our souls by stooping to 
the level of the great river, and setting our 
lips to the stream ! 

RoxANE. But yet, wit . . . fancy . . . 
delicate conceits. . . . 

Cyrano. I gave my fancy leave to 
frame conceits, before, to make you linger, 
. . . but now it would be an affront to this 
balm-breathing night, to Nature and the 
hour, to talk like characters in a pastoral 
performed at Court ! ... Let us give 
132 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Heaven leave, looking at us with all its 
earnest stars, to strip us of disguise and 
artifice : I fear, . . . oh, fear ! . . . lest 
in our mistaken alchemy sentiment should 
be subtilized to evaporation ; lest the life 
of the heart should waste in these empty 
pastimes, and the final refinement of the 
fine be the undoing of the refined ! 

EoxANE. But yet, wit, . . . aptness, 
. . . ingenuity . . . 

Cyrano. I hate them in love ! Crimi- 
nal, when one loves, to prolong over- 
much that paltry thrust and parry ! The 
moment, however, comes inevitably, — and 
I pity those for whom it never comes ! — in 
which, we apprehending the noble depth 
of the love we harbor, a shallow word 
hurts us to utter ! 

RoxANE. If . . . if, then, that moment 
has come for us two, what words will you 
say to me ? 

Cyrano. All those, all those, all those 
that come to me ! Not in formal nosegay 
order, ... I will throw them you in a 
wild sheaf ! I love you, choke with love, 
I love you, dear. . . . My brain reels, I can 
bear no more, it is too much. . . . Your 
name is in my heart the golden clapper iu 
3 bell ; and as I know no rest, Roxane, 



Cyrano de Bergerae. 

always the heart is shaken, and ever rings 
your name ! ... Of you, I remember all, 
all have I loved ! Last year, one day, the 
twelfth of May, in going out at morning 
you changed the fashion of your hair. . . . 
I have taken the light of your hair for my 
light, and as having stared too long at the 
sun, on everything one sees a scarlet wheel, 
on everything when I come from my 
chosen light, my dazzled eye sets swim- 
ming golden blots ! . . . 

RoXANE {in a voice unsteady with emo- 
tion). Yes . . . this is love . . . 

Cyrano. Ah, verily ! The feeling which 
invades me, terrible and jealous, is 
love . . . with all its mournful frenzy ! It 
is love, yet self-forgetting more than the 
wont of love ! Ah, for your happiness now 
readily would I give mine, though you 
should never know it, might I but, from 
a distance, sometimes, hear the happy 
laughter bought by my sacrifice ! Every 
glance of yours breeds in me new strength, 
new valor! Are you beginning to under- 
stand ? Tell me, do you grasp my love's 
measure ? Does some little part of my soul 
make itself felt of you there in the dark« 
ness ? . . . Oh, what is happening to me 
this evening is too sweet, too deeply dear! 

134 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

I fcell you all these things, and you listen 
to me, you ! Not in my least modest hoping 
did I ever hope so much ! I have now only 
to die! It is because of words of mine 
that she is trembling among the dusky 
branches ! For you are trembling, like a 
flower among leaves! Yes, you tremble, 
. . . for whether you will or no, I have 
felt the worshipped trembling of your hand 
all along this thrilled and blissful jasmin- 
bough ! {He madly kisses the end of a pen- 
dant bough.) 

RoxANE. Yes, I tremble . . . and 
weep . . . and love you . . . and am 
yours! . . . For you have carried me 
away . . . away! . . . 

Cyrano. Then, let death come! I have 
moved you, I ! . . . There is but one thing 
more I ask . . . 

Christian (under the balcony). A kiss! 

RoxANE (dr^awing hastily back). What! 

Cyrano. Oh ! 

RoxANE. You ask ? . . . 

Cyrano. Yes . . . I . . . {To Chris- 
tian.) You are in too great haste ! 

Christian. Since she is so moved, 1 
must take advantage of it ! 

Cyrano {to Roxane). I . . . Yes, it ia 
true I asked . . . but, merciful heavens I 

»35 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

... I knew at once that I had been too 
bold. 

RoxANE (a shade disappointed) . You in- 
sist no more than so ? 

Cyrano. Indeed, I insist . . . without 
insisting! Yes! yes! but your modesty 
shrinks! ... I insist, but yet . . . the 
kiss I begged . . . refuse it me ! 

Christian {to Cyrano, pulling at his 
mantle). Why ? 

Cyrano. Hush, Christian! 

RoxANE (bending over the balcony -rail). 
What are you whispering ? 

Cyrano. Reproaches to myself for hav- 
ing gone too far; I was saying " Hush^ 
Christian! " {The theoy-'bos are heard play- 
ing). Your pardon! ... a second! . . . 
Someone is coming! 

(RoxANE closes the window. Cyrano 
listens to the theorbos, one of ivhich plays 
a lively, and the other a lugubrious tune). 

Cyrano. A dance ? . . . A dirge ? . . . 
What do they mean ? Is it a man or a 
woman ? . . . Ah, it is a monk ! 

{Enter a Capuchin Monk, ivho goes from 
house to house, with a lantern, examining 
the doors.) 

Cyrano {to The Capuchin). What are 
you looking for, Dictgenes ? 
136 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

The Capuchin. I am looking for the 
house of Madame . . . 

Christian. He is in the way ! 

The Capuchin. Magdeleine Robin . . . 

Cyrano {pointing up one of the streets). 
This way ! . . . Straight ahead ... go 
straight ahead . . . 

The Capuchin. I thank you. I will 
say ten Aves for your peace. {Exit.) 

Cyrano. My good wishes speed your 
cowl! {He comes foricard toward Chris- 
tian.) 

Christian. Insist upon the kiss ! . . . 

Cyrano. No, I will not I 

Christian. Sooner or later . . . 

Cyrano. It is true ! It must come, the 
moment of inebriation when your lips 
ehall imperiously be impelled toward each 
other, because the one is fledged with 
youthful gold and the other is so soft a 
pink I ... {To himself.) I had rather it 
should be because . . . {Sound of the ivin- 
dow reopening ; Christian hides under the 
balcony.) 

^ RoxANE {stepping forward on the 
balcony). Are you there ? We were 
speaking of ... of ... of a .. . 

Cyrano. Kiss. The word is sweet. 
Why does your fair lip stop at it ? If the 

137 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

mere word burns it, what will be of th^ 
thing itself ? Do not make it into a fear- 
ful matter, and then fear ! Did you not 
a moment ago insensibly leave playfulness 
behind and slip without trepidation from 
a smile to a sigh, from a sigh to a tear ? 
Slip but a little further in the same blessed 
direction : from a tear to a kiss there is 
scarcely a dividing shiver ! 

RoxANE. Say no more ! 

Cyrano. A kiss ! When all is said, 
what is a kiss ? An oath of allegiance 
taken in closer proximity, a promise more 
precise, a seal on a confession, a rose-red 
dot upon the letter i in loving ; a secret 
which elects the mouth for ear ; an instant 
of eternity murmuring like a bee ; balmy 
communion with a flavor of flowers ; a 
fashion of inhaling each other's heart, and 
of tasting, on the brink of the lips, each 
other's soul ! 

RoxANE. Say no more ... no more ! 

Cyrano. A kiss, Madame, is a thing so 
noble that the Queen of France, on the 
most fortunate of lords, bestowed one, did 
the queen herself ! 

RoxANE. If that be so . . . 

Cyrano {with increasing fervor). Lik« 
Buckingham I have suffered in long silence,

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

like him I worship a queen, like him I'am 
sorrowful and unchanging . . . 

RoXANE. Like him you enthrall through 
the eyes the heart that follows you I 

Cyrano {to himself, sobered). True, I 
am handsome ... I had forgotten ! 

RoxANE. Come then and gather it, the 
supreme flower . . . 

Cyrano (pushing Christian toward ihe 
balcony) . Go ! 

RoxANE. . . . tasting of the heart. 

Cyrano. Go ! . . . 

RoxANE. . . . murmuring like a bee . . 

Cyrano. Go ! 

Christian (hesitating). But now I feel 
us if I ought not ! 

RoxANE. . . . making Eternity an in^ 
stant . . . 

Cyrano ( pushing Christian) . Scale the 
balcony, you donkey ! 

(Christian springs toivard the balcony, 
and climbs by means of the bench^ the vine, 
the posts ayid balusters). 

Christian. Ah, Roxane! (He clasps 
her to him, and bends over her lips). 

Cyrano. Hal . . . What a turn of the 
screw to my heart ! . . . Kiss, banquet 
of Love at which I am Lazarus, a crumb 
drops from your table even to me, here in

heart a little falls, as I feel that upon the 
lip pressing her lip Roxane kisses the 
words spoken by me ! . . . {The theorbos 
are heard. ) A merry tune ... a mourn- 
ful one . . . The monk ! {He goes through 
the pretence of arriving on the spot at a 
run, as if from a distance ; calling.) Ho, 
there ! 

RoxANE. What is it ? 

Cyrano. It is I. I was passing this 
way. Is Christian there ? 

Christian {aston ishtd) . Cyrano I 

lloxANE. Good-evening, cousin } 

Cyrano. Cousin, good-evening! 

RoxANE. I will come down. 

(RoxANE disappears in the house. Thes 
Capuchin re-enters at the bach.) 

Christian (seemgrMw). Oh, again ! {H$ 
follows RoXANE.) 

The Capuchin. It is here she lives, I am 
certain . . . Magdeleine Robin. 

Cyrano. You said Ro-lin. 

The Capuchin. No, bin, . . . b, i, n, bin I 

RoxANE {appearing upon the threshold, 
followed by Ragueneau carrying a lantern^ 
and Christian). What is it ? 

The Capuchin. A letter. 

Christian. What ? 
140 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

The Capuchin {to Roxane). Oh, the con- 
tents can be only of a sacred character ! 
It is from a worthy nobleman who . . . 

Roxane {to Christian). It is from De 
Guiche ! 

Christian. He dares to ... ? 

Roxane. Oh, he will not trouble me 
much longer! {Opening the letter.) I love 
you, and if . . . {By the light of Rague- 
NEAU's lantern she reads., aside., low.) 
Mademoiselle: The drums are beating. 
My regiment is buckling on its corselet. 
It is about to leave. I am thought to have 
left already, but lag behind. I am disobey- 
ing you. I am in the convent here. I am 
coming to you, and send you word by a 
friar, silly as a sheep, who has no suspicion 
of the import of this letter. You smiled 
too sweetly upon me an hour ago : I must 
Bee you smile again. Provide to be alone, 
and deign graciously to receive the auda- 
cious worshipper, forgiven already, I can 
but hope, who signs himself your — etc. . . . 
{To The Capuchin.) Father, this is what 
the letter tells me . . . Listen: {All draw 
nearer; she reads aloud.) Mademoiselle : 
The wishes of the cardinal may not be dis- 
regarded, however hard compliance with 
them prove. I have therefore chosen a^

bearer of this letter a most reverend, holy^ 
and sagacious Capuchin ; it is our wish that 
he should at once, in your own dweUing, 
pronounce the nuptial blessing over you. 
Christian must secretly become your hus- 
band. I send him to you. You dislike 
him. Bow to Heaven's will in resignation, 
and be sure that it will bless your zeal, and 
sure, likewise, Mademoiselle, of the re^ 
epect of him wh(? is and will be ever your 
most humble and . . . etc. 

The Capuchin (beaming). The worthy 
gentleman! ... I knew it! You re 
member that I said so: Th€ contents of 
that letter can be only of a sacred charac- 
ter ! 

EoxANE (low, to Christian). I am a 
fluent reader, am I not ? 

Christian. Hm ! 

"RoxA^E {with feigned despair). Ah . , . 
it is horrible ! 

The Capuchin (who has turned the light 
of his lantern upon Cyrano). You are the 
one ? 

Christian. No, I am.

and as if his good looks aroused suspicion'^,,

will bestow upon the convent two hundred 
and fifty crowns. 

The Capuchin. The worthy, worthy gen- 
tleman! (Tb RoxANE.) Be reconciled ! 

RoxANE {icith the expression of a martyr). 
I will endeavor ! ( While Ragueneau opens 
the door for The Capuchin, rt?/io?7i Christian 
is shoiving into the house, Roxane says loiv 
fo Cyrano.) De Guiche is coming! . . . 
Keep him here ! Do not let him enter 
until . . . 

Cyrano. I understand ! (To The Capu- 
chin.) How long will it take to marry 
them ? 

The Capuchin. A quarter of an hour. 

Cyrano (pushing all toward the house). 
Go in ! I shall be here ! 

Roxane (to Christian). Come ! 

(TJiey go in.) 

Cyrano. How can I detain De Guiche 
for a quarter of an hour ? (He jumps upon 

the bench, climbs the wall toward the bal- 
cony rail.) So I . . . I climb up here I . . . 
I know what I will do I . . . (The theor- 
bos play a melancholy tune.) Ho, it is a 
man ! (TJie tune quxivers lugubriously.) 
Ho, ho, this time there is no mistake ! (He 
is on the balcony ; he pidls the brim of his 
hat over his eyes, takes off his sword, wraps

his cloak about him, and bends over the bat 
cony -rail.) No, it is not too far ! (iJ<f 
climbs over the balcony rail, and reaching 
for a long bough that projects beyond 
the garden wall, holds on to it with both 
hands, ready to let himself drop.) I shall 
make a slight commotion in the atmos- 
phere ! 

De Guiche {enters masked, groping in 
the dark). What can that thrice-damned 
Capuchin be about ? 

Cyrano. The devil ! if he should rec- 
ognize my voice ? {Letting go with one 
hand, he makes show of turning a key.) 
Cric ! crac ! {Solemnly.) Cyrano, resume 
the accent of Bergerac ! 

De Guiche (looking at Roxane's house). 
Yes, that is it. I can scarcely see. Thiey 
mask bothers my eyes ! {He is about to 
enter Roxane's house; Cyrano sivings 
from the balcony, holding on to the bough, 
which bends and lets him down betiveen the 
door and De Guiche. He intentionally 
drops very heavily, to give the effect of 
dropping from a great height, and lies 
flattened upon the ground, motionless, as if 
stunyied.) 

De Guiche. What is it ? {When hi 
looks up, the bough has swung into places

h€ sees nothing but the sky). Where did 
this man drop from ? 

Cyrano {rising to a sitting posture). 
From the moon ! 

De Guiche. From the . . . ? 

Cyrano {in a dreamy voice). What time 
is it? 

De Guiche. Is he mad ? 

Cyrano. What time ? What country I 
What day ? What season ? 

De Guiche. But . . . 

Cyrano. I am dazed ! 

De Guiche. Monsieur . . . 

Cyrano. I have dropped from the moon 
like a bomb ! 

De Guiche {impatieyitly) . What are you 
babbling about ? 

Cyrano {rising, in a terrible voice). I 
tell you I have dropped from the moon ! 

De Guiche {backing a step). Very well. 
You have dropped from the moon! . . 
He is perhaps a lunatic ! 

Cyrano {ivalking up close to him). Not 
metaphorically, mind that ! 

De Guiche. But . . . 

Cyrano. A hundred years ago, or else 
a minute, — for I have no conception how 
long I have been falling, — I was up there, 
in th&vt saffron-colored ball ! 
lo 145 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche {shrugging his shoulder^). 
You were. Now, let me pass ! 

Cyrano {standing in his way). Where 
am I ? Be frank with me ! Keep nothing 
from me! In what region, among what 
people, have I been shot like an aerolite ? 

De Guiche. I wish to pass! 

Cyrano. While falling I could not 
choose my way, and have no notion where 
I have fallen ! Is it upon a moon, or is ii 
upon an earth, I have been dragged b;7 
my posterior weight ? 

De Guiche. I tell you, sir . . . 

Cyrano {with a scream of terror at which 
De Guiche starts backward a step) . Great 
God ! . . In this country men's faces are 
soot-black ! 

De Guiche {lifting his hand to his face). 
What does he mean ? 

Cyrano {still ter^iHfied). Am I in Al- 
geria ? Are you a native ? . . . 

De Guiche {who has felt his mask) . Ah, 
my mask ! 

Cyrano {pretending to be easier). So I 
am in Venice ! ... Or am I in Genoa ? 

De Guiche {attempting to pass) . A lady 
is expecting me ! 

Cyrano {completely reassured). Ah, 
then I am in Paris. 

146 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche {smiling in spite of himself). 
The rogue is not far from amusing ! 

Cyrano. Ah, you are laughing! 

De Guiche. I laugh . . . but intend to 
pass! 

Cyrano (beaming). To think I should 
strika Paris! (Quite at his ease^ laughing, 
brushing' himself, boiving.) I arrived— 
pray, pardon my appearance ! — by the last 
whirlwind. I am rather unpresentable- 
Travel, you know ! My eyes are still full 
of star-dust. My spurs are clogged with 
bristles off a planet. (Appearing to pick 
something off his sleeve.) See, on my 
sleeve, a comet's hair! (Re makes a feint 
of blowing it aivay.) 

DkGuicre (beside hiynself). Si"t . . . 

Cyrano (as De Guiche is about to pass^ 
stretching out his leg as if to show some- 
thing on it, thereby stopping him.) Em' 
bedded in my calf, I have brought back 
one of the Great Bear's teeth . . . and as, 
falling too near the Trident, I strained aside 
to clear one of its prongs, I landed sitting 
in Libra, . . . yes, one of the scales ! . . . 
and now my weight is registered up there ! 
(Quickly preventing De Guiche from pass- 
ing, and taking hold of a button on his 
doublet.) And if, Monsieur, you should 

M7 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

take my nose between your fingers and 
compress it . . . milk would result ! 

De Guiche. What are you saying ? 
Milk? . . . 

Cyrano. Of the Milky Way. 

De Guiche. Go to the devil ! 

Cyrano. No ! I am sent from Heaven, 
literally. {Folding his arms.) Will you 
believe — I discovered it in passing — that 
Sirius at night puts on a night-cap ? (Con- 
fidentially.) The lesser Bear is too little yet 
to bite. . . . (Laughing.) I tumbled plump 
through Lyra, and snapped a string ! . . . 
(Magnificent.) But I intend setting all this 
down in a book, and the golden stars I have 
brought back caught in my shaggy mantle, 
when the book is printed, will be seen 
serving as asterisks ! 

De Guiche. I have stood this long 
enough! I want . . . 

Cyrano. I know perfectly what you 
want! 

De Guiche. Man . . . 

Cyrano. You want to know, from me, 
at first hand, what the moon is made of, 
and whether that monumental pumpkin is 
inhabited ? 

De Guiche (shouting). Not in the very 
least! I want . . . 

148 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. To know how I got there ? 1 
got there by a method of my own inven* 
tion. 

De Guiche {discouraged). He is mad I 
. . . stark! 

Cyrano {disdainfully). Do not imagine 
that I resorted to anything so absurd 
as Regiomontanus's eagle, or anything so 
lacking in enterprise as Archytas's 
pigeon! . . . 

De Guiche. The madman is eru- 
dite . . . 

Cyrano. I drew up nothing that had 
ever been thought of before ! (De Guiche 
has succeeded in getting pa6t Cyrano, and 
is nearing Roxane's door ; Cyrano follows 
him., ready to buttonhole him.) I invented 
no less than six ways of storming the bluo 
fort of Heaven ! 

De Guiche {turning around). Six, did 
you say ? 

Cyrano {volubly). One way was to 
Btand naked in the sunshine, in a harness 
thickly studded with glass phials, each 
filled with morning dew. The sun in draw. 
ing up the dew, you see, could not have 
helped drawing me up too ! 

De Guiche {surprised, taking a step to 
MJard Cyrano). True. That is one! 
149 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano {taking a step backward^ with a 
mew to drawing De Guiche away from the 
door). Or else, I could have let the wind 
into a cedar coffer, then rarified the im- 
prisoned element by means of cunningly 
adjusted burning-glasses, and soared up 
with it ! 

De Guiche {taking another step toward 
Cyrano). Two! 

Cyrano (backing). Or else, mechanic as 
well as artificer, I could have fashioned a 
giant grasshopper, with steel joints, which, 
impelled by successive explosions of salt 
peter, would have hopped with me to the 
azure meadows where graze the starry 
flocks ! 

De Guiche {unconsciously following 
Cyrano, andlcounting on his fingers) . That 
makes three ! 

Cyrano. Since smoke by its nature 
ascends, I could have blown into an appro- 
priate globe a sufficient quantity to ascend 
with me ! 

De Guiche {as above, more and more as- 
tonished). Four ! 

Cyrano. Since Phoebe, the moon- 
goddess, when she is at wane, is greedy, 
beeves ! of your marrow, . . . with thai 
marrow have besmeared myself I 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche {amazed). Five ! 

Cyrano {who while talking has bacJced, 
followed hy De Guiche, to the further side of 
Ihe square, near a feench). Or else, I could 
have placed myself upon an iron plate, 
have taken a magnet of suitable size, and 
thrown it in the air ! That way is a very 
good one ! The magnet flies upward, the 
iron instantly after ; the magnet no sooner 
overtaken than you fling it up again. . . . 
The rest is clear ! You can go upward in- 
definitely. 

De Guiche. Six ! . . . But here are six 
excellent methods ! Which of the six, my 
dear sir, did you select ? 

Cyrano. A seventh ! 

De Guiche. Did you, indeed ? And 
what was that ? 

Cyrano. I give you a hundred guesses ! 

De Guiche. I must confess that I should 
like to know ! 

Cyrano {imitatiyig the noise of the surf 
and making great mysterious gestures], 
Hoo-ish! hoo-ish! 

De Guiche. Well ! What is that ? 

Cyrano. Cannot you guess ? 

De Guiche. No ! 

Cyrano. The tide! . . . At the hour in 
which the moon attracts the deep, I lay

and, my head being dravm up first, — the 
reason of this, you see, that the hair will 
hold a quantity of water in its mop ! — 1 
rose in the air, straight, beautifully 
straight, like an angel. I rose ... I rose 
softly . . . without an effort . . . when, 
suddenly, I felt a shock. Then . . . 

De Guiche {lured on by curiosity^ tak-> 
ing a seat on the bench). Well, . . . 
then ? 

Cyrano. Then . . . {resuming his nat- 
ural voice.) The time is up, Monsieur, an(t 
I release you. They are married. 

De Guiche {getting to his feet with a leap). 
I am dreaming or drunk ! That voice ? 
( T^e cZoor o/Roxane's house opens; lack- 
eys appear carrying lighted candelabra. 
Cyrano removes his hat.) And that nose!

precisely rich in game. . . .

hunting !

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano {coming out of the tent, tranquil. 
a pen behind his ear, a book in his hand). 
What is the matter ? {Silence. To FiRSt 
Cadet.) Why do you go off like that, with 
that slouching gait ? 

The Cadet. I have something away 
down in my heels which inconveniencea 
me. 

Cyrano. And what is that? 

The Cadet. My stomach. 

Cyrano. That is where mine is, too. 

The Cadet. Then you too must be in- 
convenienced. 

Cyrano. No. The size of the hollow 
within me merely increases my sense of 
my size. 

Second Cadet. I happen to have teeth, 
long ones ! 

Cyrano. The better will you bite . . . 
in good time ! 

Third Cadet. I reverberate like a drum I 

Cyrano. You will be of use ... to 
sound the charge I 

Other Cadet. I have a buzzipg in my 
ears! 

Cyrano. A mistake. Empty belly, no 
ears. You hear no buzzing. 

Other Cadet. Ah, a trifling article t« 
eat . . . and a little oil upon it I 
162 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano {taking off the Cadet's morion 
and placi7ig it in his hand). That is 
Beasoned. 

Other Cadet. What is there we could 
devour ? 

Cyrano {tossing him the book he has 
been holding). Try the Iliad! 

Other Cadet. The minister, in Paris, 
makes his four meals a day I 

Cyrano. You feel it remiss in him not 
to send you a bit of partridge ? 

The Same. Why should he not ? And 
some wine I 

Cyrano. Richelieu, some Burgundy, if 
jrou please ? 

The Same. He might, by one of his 
capuchins ! 

Cyrano. By his Eminence, perhaps, in 
^ober gray ? 

Other Cadet. No ogre was ever so 
liungry ! 

Cyrano. You may have your fill yet 
Df humble-pie ! 

First Cadet {shrugging his shoidders). 
Forever jests! . . . puns! . . . mots! 

Cyrano. Le mot forever, indeed ! And 

1 would wish to die, on a fine evening, 

under a rose-flushed sky, delivering myself 

of a good mot in a good cause ! . . . Ah,

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

yes, the best were indeed, far from fever- 
bed and potion, pierced with the only nobl* 
weapon, by an adversary worthy of one- 
self, to fall upon a glorious field, the point 
of a sword through his heart, the point of 
a jest on his lips ! . . . 

All {in a luail) . I am hungry ! 

Cyrano {folding his arms). God ha'' 
mercy ! can you think of nothing but eating? 
. . . Come here, Bertrandou the fifer, once 
the shepherd ! Take from the double casG 
one of your fifes : breathe into it, play to 
ihis pack of guzzlers and of gluttons our 
homely melodies, of haunting rhythm, 
every note of which appeals like a little 
sister, through whose every strain are heard 
strains of beloved voices . . . mild melodies 
whose slowness brings to mind the slowness 
of the smoke upcurling from our native 
hamlet hearths . . . melodies that seem to 
speak to a man in his native dialect! . . (TJ10 
old fifer sits down and makes ready his fife.) 
To-day let the fife, martial unwillingly, be 
reminded, while your fingers upon its 
slender stem flutter like birds in a delicate 
minuet, that before being ebony it was 
reed ; surprise itself by what you make it 
sing, ... let it feel restored to it the soul 
of its youth, rustic and peaceable! (27»fl

old man begins playing Languedoc tunes) 
Listen, Gascons ! It is no more, beneath 
his fingers, the shrill fife of the camp, 
but the soft flute of the woodland ! It is no 
more, between his lips, the whistling note of 
battle, but the lowly lay of goatherds lead' 
ing their flocks to feed ! . . . Hark ! . . . 
It sings of the valley, the heath, the 
forest! ... of the little shepherd, sun- 
burned under his crimson cap! . . . the 
green delight of evening on the river ! . . . 
Hark, Gascons all I It sings of Gascony !

grown dreamy ; tears are furtively brushed 
aicay ivith a sleeve, the hem of a cloak) . 

Carbon (to Cyrano, loic). You are 
making them weep ! 

Cyrano. With homesickness! ... a 
nobler pain than hunger . . . not physi- 
cal : mental ! I am glad the seat of their 
suffering should have removed . . . that 
the gripe should now afflict their hearts ! 

Carbon. But you weaken them, making 
them weep!

Never fear ! The hero in their veins i3

One of the Cadets (looJcing off at the

selves to playing ivith cards and dice, on 
the heads of drums, on stools, on cloaks

He goes toward Carbon.) 

De Guiche {to Carbon). Ah, good- 
morning. {Tliey look at each other at^

is pale as plaster.

here are the w^-ongheaded rascals ? . . • 
167 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Yes, gentlemen, it is reported to me on 
every side that I am your scoff and deri- 
Bion ; that the cadets, highland nobility, 
Bearn clodhoppers, Perigord baronets, 
cannot express sufficient contempt for their 
colonel ; call me intriguer, courtier, find 
it irksome to their taste that I should wear, 
with my cuirass, a collar of Genoese point, 
and never cease to air their wondering in- 
dignation that a man should be a Gascon 
without being a vagabond ! {Silence. 
The Cadets continue smoking and playing)* 
Shall I have you punished by your cap- 
tain ? ... I do not like to. 

Carbon. Did you otherwise, however, 
, . . I am free, and punish only . . . 

De Guiche. Ah ? . . . 

Carbon. My company is paid by my 
^elf, belongs to me. I obey no orders but 
«uch as relate to war. 

De Guiche. Ah, is it so ? Enough, then. 
I will treat your taunts with simple scorn. 
My fashion of deporting myself under fire 
is well known. You are not unaware of 
the manner in which yesterday, at Bapau- 
me, I forced back the columns of the Comt6 
de Bucquoi ; gathering my men together 
to plunge forward like an avalanche, threi 
times I charged him. . . . 
l63 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano {ivithout lifting his nose from 
his book). And your white scarf ? 

De Guiche {surprised and self-satisfied). 
you heard of that circumstance ? ... In 
fact, it happened that as I was wheeling 
about to collect my men for the third 
charge, I was caught in a stream of 
fugitives which bore me onward to the 
edge of the enemy. I was in danger of 
being captured and cut off wath an arque- 
buse, when I had the presence of mind to 
untie and let slip to the ground the white 
scarf which proclaimed my military grade. 
Thus was I enabled, undistinguished, to 
withdraw from among the Spaniards, and 
thereupon returning with my reinspirited 
men, to defeat them. Well ? . . . What 
do you say to the incident ? 

{Tfie Cadets have appeared not to be 
listening ; at this point, however, hands 
with cards and dice-boxes remain suspended 
In the air; no piije-smolce is ejected; all 
expresses expectation.) 

Cyrano. That never would Henry the 
Fourth, however great the number of his 
opponents, have consented to diminish hia 
presence by the size of his white plume. 

(Silent joy. Cards fall, dice rattle^ 
Wioke upwreathes.) 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Dk GriCHE. The trick was successful| 
however 1 

(As before, expectation suspends gam* 
bling and smoking.) 

Cyrano. Very likely. But one should 
not resign the honor of being a target. 
{Cards, dice, smoke, fall, rattle, and up- 
wreathe, as before, in expression of increas 
ing glee.) Had I been at hand when you 
allowed your scarf to drop — the quality of 
our courage, monsieur, shows different in 
this, — I would have picked it up and worn 
it. . . . 

De Guiche. Ah, yes, — more of your 
Srascon bragging ! . . 

Cyrano. Bragging ? . . . Lend me the 
scarf. I engage to mount, ahead of all, to 
the assault, wearing it crosswise upon my 
breast ! 

De Guiche, A Gascon's offer, that too! 
You know that the scarf was left in the 
enemy's camp, by the banks of the Scarpe, 
where bullets since then have hailed . . . 
ivhence no one can bring it back ! 

Cyrano {taking a tchite scarf from his 
pocket and handing it to De Guiche) . Here 
it is. 

{Silence. The Cadets smother theif 
laughter behind cards and in dice-boxes, 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche turns around, looks at them{ 
instantly they become grave ; one of theni^ 
with an air of unconcern, whistles the tuni 
played earlier by the fifer) . 

De Guiche {taking the scarf). I thank 
you. I shall be able with this shred of 
white to make a signal . . . which I was 
hesitating to make. . . {He goes to the top 
of the bank and waves the scarf.) 

All. What now ? . . . What is this ? 

The Sentinel {at the top of the bank). 
A man . . . over there . . . running 
off . . . 

De Guiche {coming forward again) . It 
is a supposed Spanish spy. He is very 
useful to us. The information he carries 
to the enemy is that which I give him, — 
so that their decisions are influenced by us. 

Cyrano. He is a scoundrel ! 

De Guiche {coolly tying on his scarf) _ 
fle is a convenience. We were saying ? 
. . , Ah, I was about to tell you. Last 
night, having resolved upon a desperate 
stroke to obtain supplies, the Marshal 
secretly set out for Dourlens. The royal 
Butlers are encamped there. He expects to 
join them by way of the tilled fields ; but, t<? 
provide against interference, he took with 
him troops in such number that, certainly, 
171 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

if we were now attacked, the enemy would 
find easy work. Half of the army is 
absent from the \^amp. 

Carbon. If the Spaniards knew that, it 
might be serious. But they do not know. 

De Guiche. They do. And are going 
k) attack us. 

Carbon. Ah ! 

De Guiche. My pretended spy came 
to warn me of their intention. He said, 
moreover: I can direct the attack. At 
what point shall it be ? I will lead 
them to suppose it the least strong, and 
they will centre their efforts against it. I 
answered : Very well. Go from the camp. 
Look down the line. Let them attack 
at the point I signal from. 

Carbon {to the Cadets). Gentlemen, 
get ready ! {All get up. Noise of mvorda 
and belts being buckled on.) 

De Guiche. They will be here in an houi 

First Cadet. Oh ! ... if there ia ^ 
whole hour ! . - . 

(All sit doum again, and go on with their 
games.) 

De Guiche {to Carbon). The main ob« 
5ect is to gain time. The Marshal is on hi| 
way back. 

Carbon. And to gain time ? 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche. You will be so obliging as 
to keep them busy killing you. 

Cyrano. Ah, this is your revenge ! 

De Guiche. I will not pretend that if 1 
had been fond of you, I would have thus 
singled out you and yours ; but, as your 
bravery is unquestionably beyond that of 
others, I am serving my King at the same 
time as my inclination. 

Cyrano. Suffer me, monsieur, to ex' 
press my gratitude. 

De Guiche. I know that you affect 
fighting one against a hundred. You will 
not complain of lacking opportunity. {He 
goes toivard the back with Carbon.) 

Cyrano {to the Cadets). We shall now 
be able, gentlemen, to add to the Gascon 
escutcheon, which bears, as it is, six chev- 
rons, or and azure, the chevron that was 
wanting to complete it, — blood-red ! 

(De Guiche at the back speaks Joiuwith 
Carbox. Orders are given. All is made 
ready to repel an attach, Cyrano goes

Christian. I wish I might at least put 
my whole heart's last blessing in a beauti* 
ful letter ! 

Cyrano. I mistrusted that it would 
come to-day. . . {he takes a letter from his 
doublet) and I have written your fare^ 
wells. 

Christian, Let me see ! 

Cyrano. You wish to see it ? . . . 

Christian {taking the letter). Yes ! 
{He opens the letter^ begins to read^ stops 
short.) Ah ? . . . 

Cyrano. What ? 

Christian. That little round blister ? 

Cyrano {hurriedly taking back the letter, 
and looking at it -with an artless air). A 
blister ? 

Christian. It is a tear ! 

Cyrano. It looks like one, does it not I 
... A poet, you see, is sometimes caught 
in his own snare, — that is what constitutes 
the interest, the charm ! . . . This letter, 
you must know, is very touching. Iij 
writing it I apparently made myself shei 
tears. 

Christian. Shed tears ? . . . 

Cyrano. Yes, because . . . well, to dn 
is not terrible at all . . . but never to see hei 
again, . . . never I . . . that, you know, 

174

is horrible beyond all thinking. . . . And, 
things having taken the turn they have, 1 
shall not see her . . . (Christian looks at 
him) we shall not see her . . . (Hastily) 
you will not see her. . . . 

Christian {snatching the letter from him). 
Give me the letter ! 

(Noise in the distance.) 

Voice of a Sentinel. Ventrebieu^ who 
goes there ? 

(Shots. Noise of voices, tinkling of 
hells.) 

Carbon. What is it ? 

The Sentinel {on the top of the bank). 
A coach ! 

(All run to see.) 

{Noisy exclamations.) What ? — In the 
camp ? — It is driving into the camp ! — It 
comes from the direction of the enemy ! 
The devil ! Fire upon it ! — No ! the coach- 
man is shouting something ! — What does 
he say ? — He shouts : Service of the King! 

De Guiche. What ? Service of the 
King? 

(All come down from the hanh and fall 
into order.) 

Carbon. Hats off, all I 

De Guiche {at the corner). Service of

covered with mud and dust . Tlie ctiT" 
tains are drawn. Two lackeys behind. 
It comes to a standstill.) 

Carbon {shouting). Salute !

door opens.) 

EoxANE {stepping from the carriage. 
Good-morning !

De Guiche. Service of the King ! You ? 

RoxANE. Of the only King ! . . of Love ! 

Cyrano. Ah, great God ! 

Christian (rushing to her ). You 1! 
Why are you here ? 

RoxANE. This siege lasted too long ! 

Christian. Why have you come ? 

RoxANE. I will tell you ! 

Cyrano {who at the sound of her voice 
has started^ then stood motionless without 
venturing to look her way). God I . . , 
tan I trust myself to look at her ? 
176 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche. You cannot remain here. 

RoxANE. But I can, — I can, indeed ! 
Will you favor me with a drum ? {She 
seats herself upon a drum brought foricard 
for her.) There ! I thank you ! {She 
laughs.) They fired upon my carriage. 
{Proudly.) A patrol! — It does look rather 
as if it were made out of a pumpkin, does 
it not ? like Cinderella's coach ! and the 
footmen made out of rats ! {Blowing a kiss 
to Christian.) How do you do ? {Looking 
at them all.) You do not look overjoyed !

you know it ? {Catching sight of Cyrano.) 
Cousin, delighted ! 

Cyrano {coming toward her). But how 
did you . . . ? 

RoxANE. How did I find the army \ 
Dear me, cousin, that was simple: I fol- 
lowed straight along the line of devasta- 
tion. . . . Ah, I should never have be- 
lieved in such horrors had I not seen them 1 
Gentlemen, if that is the service of your 
King, I like mine better !

what way did you come ? 

RoxANE. Way ? . . . I d ytve through 
the Spaniards' camp.

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

First Cadet. Ah, what will keep lovely 
woman from her way ! 

De Guiche. But how did you contrive 
to get through their lines ? 

Le Bret. That must have been diffi. 
cult . . . 

Roxane. No, not very. I simply drove 
through them, in my coach, at a trot. If 
a hidalgo, with arrogant front, showed 
likely to stop us, I put my face at the 
window, wearing my sweetest smile, and, 
those gentlemen being, — let the French not 
grudge my saying so ! — the most gallant 
in the world, ... I passed ! 

Carbon. Such a smile is a passport, 
certainly ! . . . But you must have been 
not unfrequently bidden to stand and de- 
liver where you were going ? 

Roxane. Not unfrequently, you are 
right. Whereupon I would say, "I am 
going to see my lover ! " At once, the 
fiercest looking Spaniard of them all would 
gravely close my carriage door ; and, with 
a gesture the King might emulate, motion 
aside the musket-barrels levelled at me j 
and, superb at once for grace and haughti- 
ness, bringing his spurs together, and lift* 
ing his plumed hat, bow low and say 
*' Pass, senorita, pass ! "

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Christian. But, Roxane . . . 

RoxANE. I said, " My lover / " yes, foi> 
give me ! — You see, if I had said, ' ' My hus*

Christian. But . . . 

RoxANE. What troubles you ? 

De Guiche. You must leave at once 

RoxANE. I ? 

Cyrano. At once I 

Le Bret, As fast as you can. 

Christian. Yes, you must. 

Roxane. But why ? 

Christian {embarrassed). Because . . . 

Cyrano {embarrassed too). In three 
Quarters of an hour . . . 

De Guiche {the same). Or an hour . . . 

Carbon {the same). You had much 
better . . . 

Le Bret {the same). You might . . , 

Roxane. I shall remain. You are going 
to fight. 

All. Oh, no ! ... No ! 

Roxane. He is my husband ! {She 
throws herself in Christian's arms.) Let 
me be killed with you ! 

Christian. How your eyes shine ! 

Roxane. I will tell you why they shine! 

De Guiche {desperately). It is a post of 
horrible probabilities !

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoxANE {turning toward him). What— • 
of horrible ? . . . 

Cyrano. In proof of which he appointed 
us to it ! . . . 

RoxANE. Ah, you wish me made a 
widow ? 

De Guiche. I swear to you . . . 

RoxANE. No ! Now I have lost all re« 
gard. . . . Now I will surely not go. . . , 
Besides, I think it fun I 

Cyrano. What ? The precieuse con- 
tained a heroine ? 

RoxANE. Monsieur de Bergerac, I am 4 
cousin of yours ! 

One of the Cadets. Never think but 
that we will take good care of you ! 

Roxane {more and more excited). I am 
sure you will, my friends ! 

Other Cadet. The whole camp smells 
of iris ! 

Roxane. By good fortune I put on a hat 
that will look well in battle ! {Glancing 
toward De Guiche.) But perhaps it ia 
time the Count should go. — The battle 
might begin.

RoxANE {opens her hand; the handker- 
chief drops). Why ? 

{Tlie whole company starts forward to 
pick it up). 

Carbon {instantly catching it). My 
company had no flag! Now, my word,

Roxane {smiling). It is rather small! 

Carbon {fastenirig the handkerchief on 
the staff of his captain's spear). But it is

One of the Cadets. Bring you some ? 

Other Cadet. And where, great God, 
shall we get them ? 

RoxANE {quietly). In my coach. 

All. What ? 

RoxANE. But there is much to be done, 
carving and boning and serving. Look 
more closely at my coachman, gentlemen, 
and you will recognize a precious individ- 
ual : the sauces, if we wish, can be warmed 
over . . .

no heed took they . . . (he takes a dish from 
the box-seat) ... of galantine ! 

{Applause. The galantine is passed 
from hand to hand.) 

Cyrano ijow to Christian). A word 
with you. . . 

Ragueneau. Venus kept their eyes fixed 
upon herself, while Diana slipped past with 
the . . . (he brandishes a joint) game ! 

(Enthusiasm. The joint is seized hy 
twenty hands at once.) 

Cyrano {low to Christian). I must 
speak with you. 

Roxane {to the Cadets who come for- 
ward^ their arms full of provisions). 
Spread it all upon the ground ! 

{Assisted ly the two imperturhdble foot^ 
men ivho were on the lack of the coach, she 
arranges everything on the grass.) 

Roxane (to Christian whom Cyrano i% 
trying to draw aside). Make yourself 
useful, sir ! 

(Christiai^ comes and helps her. Cy- 
xtAN'O gives evidence of uneasiriess.) 

Ragueneau. A truffled peacock ! 

First Cadet {radiant, comes forward 
cutting off a large slice of ham). Praise

Ragueneau {leaving one of the coach 
lanterns) . Each lantern is a little larder I 

Cyrano {loiv to Christian, while together 
they spread the cloth) . I must speak with 
you before you speak with her . . . 

Ragueneau. The handle of my whip, 
behold, is a sausage ! 

Roxane {pouring wine^ dispensing it). 
Since we are the ones to be killed, moi^bleu, 
we will not fret ourselves about the rest of 
the army ! Everything for the Gascons !

tnust invite him ! {Going from one to the

FmsT Cadet. It is too good ! 

RoxANE. Hush ! White wine or red t^ 
Bread for Monsieur de Carbon ! — A knife t 
— Pass your plate ! — You prefer crust ? — 
— A little more ? — Let me help you. — 
Champagne ? — A wing ? — 

Cyrano {following Roxane, Ms hands 
full of dishes y helping her). I adore 
her ! 

RoxANE {going to Christian). What 
will you take ? 

Christian. Nothing ! 

RoxANE. Oh, but you must take some- 
thing ! This biscuit — in a little Muscatel 
— just a little ? 

Christian {trying to keep her from going). 
Tell me what made you come ? 

RoxANE. I owe myself to those poor 
fellows .... Be patient, ... By and 
by . . . 

Le Bret {who had gone toward the back 
to pass a loaf of bread on the end of a pike 
to the Sentinel upon the earthwork). De

Take a flying leap on to your box ! — li

{Li a luink, all the eatables have teen 
pushed into the tents, or hidden under 
clothes, cloaks, hats. Enter De Guiche, 
hurriedly; he stops short, sniffing the 
air. Silence.) 

De Guiche. What a good smell ! 

One of the Cadets (singing, ivith effect 
of mental abstraction). To lo lo lo. . . . 

De Guiche (stopping and looking at him 
closely). What is the matter with you— 
you, there ? You are red as a crab . 

The Cadet I ? Nothing ... It is just 
itiy Mood. . . We : re going to fight: it 
tells . . . 

Other Cadet. Poom . . . poom . . . 
poom . . . 

De Guiche (turnmg). What is this ? 

The Cadet (slightly intoxicated). 
N'othing . . A song . . . just a little song. 

De Guiche. You look in good spirits, 
my boy ! 

The Cadet. Danger a^ects me that 
way! 

De Guiche (calling Carbon de Oa<3TEL« 
J ALOUX to give an order). Captain, I . . . 
{Hestopsat sight of his face.) Peste! You 
look in good spirits, too. 

Carbon (Hushed, holding a bottle behind 
him; ivith an evasive gesture). Oh I . . , 
i8^ 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche. I had a cannon left over, 
which I have ordered them to place {hi 
points in the wing) there, in that corner, 
and which your men can use, if neces- 
sary . . . 

One of the Cadets (swaying from on$ 
foot to the other). Charming attention I 

Other Cadet {smiling sugarily). Our 
thanks for your gracious thoughtful- 
ness ! 

De Guiche. Have they gone mad ? 
. . . {Drily.) As you are not accustomed 
to handling a cannon, look out for itf 
kicking . . . 

First Cadet. Ah, pfft ! . . . 

De Guiche {going toward him, furious). 
But . . . 

The Cadet. A cannon knows better than 
to kick a Gascon ! 

De Guiche {seizing him by the arm and 
shaking him). You are all tipsy: on 
^hat ? 

The C^det {magnificently). The smell 
of powder ! 

De Guiche {shrugs his shoulders, pushes 
aside the Cadet, and goes rapidly toward 
]Boxane). Quick, Madame ! what have 
you condescended to decide ? 

Boxane. I remain. 
i83 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

/)e Guiche. Retire, I beseech you I 

ROXANE. No. 

De Guiche. If you are determined, then 
, . . Let me have a musket ! 

Carbon. What do you mean ? 

De Guiche. I, too, will remain. 

Cyrano. At last, Monsieur, an instance 
of pure and simple bravery ! 

First Cadet. Might you be a Gascon, 
lace collar notwithstanding ? 

De Guiche I do not leave a woman in 
danger. 

Second Cadet {to First Cadet)). Look 
here ! I think he might be given some- 
Uiing to eat 1 

{All the food reappears, as ifhy magic.) 

De Guiche {his eyes brightening). Pro- 
4sions ? 

Third Cadet. Under every waistcoat f 

De Guiche {mastering himself, haugh- 
My). Do you imagine that I will eat your 
leavings ? 

Cyrano (boicing). You are improving ! 

De Guiche {proudly, falling at the last 
qf the sentence into a slightly Gascon 
Accent). I will fight before I eat ! 

First Cadet {exultant). Fight ! Eat I 

. . He spoke with an accent ! 

De Guiche {laughing). I did ? 
189 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

The Cadet. He is one of us I 

{All fall to dancing.) 

Carbon (ivho a moment before disap* 
geared behind the earthivorks, reappearing 
at the top). I have placed my pikemen, 
They are a determined troop . . . 

(He points at a line of pikes projecting 
above the bank). 

De Guiche (to Roxane, bowing). Will you 
accept my hand and pass them in review f 

(She takes his hand ; they go toivard the 
banJc. Every one imcovers and follows.) 

Christian {going to Cyrano, quickly). 
Speak ! Be quick ! 

{As Roxane appears at the top of the 
the hank, the pikes disappear, loivered in 
a salute, and a cheer goes up j RoxakB 

b02US.) 

Pikemen (outside). Vivat ! 

Christian. What did you want to tel) 
me ? 

Cyrano. In case Roxane . . . 

Christian. Well ? 

Cyrano. Should speak to you of tha 
letters . . . 

Christian. Yes, the letters. I know I 

Cyrano. Do not commit the blunder o( 
appearing surprised . . . 

Christian. At what ? 
190 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. I must tell you! ... It w 
quite simple, and merely comes into my 
mind to-day because I see her. You 
have . . . 

Christian. Hurry ! 

Cyrano. You . . . you have written to 
\er oftener than you suppose . . . 

Christian. Oh, have I ? 

Cyrano. Yes. It was my business, you 
Bee. I had undertaken to interpret your 
passion, and sometimes I wrote without 
having told you I should write. 

Christian. Ah ? 

Cyrano. It is very simple. 

Christian. But how did you succeed 
pince we have been so closely surrounded, 
In ... ? 

Cyrano. Oh, before daybreak I could 
cross the lines . . . 

Christian {folding his arms). Ah, that 
Is very simple, too ? . . . And how many 
times a week have I been writing ? Twice 'i 
Three times ? Four ? . . . 

Cyrano. More. 

Christian. Every day ? 

Cyrano. Yes, every day . . . twice. 

Christian (violently). And you cared «?o 
much about it that you were willing to 
brave death. . . . 

191 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano (seeing Eoxane who returns.) 
Be still . . . Not before her ! {He goei 
quickly into his tent.) 

(Cadets come and go at the hacJc, Car* 
BON" and De Guiche give orders.) 

RoxANE (running to Christian). And 
now, Christian . . . 

Christian (taking her hands). And now, 
you shall tell me why, over these fearful 
roads, through these ranks of rough sol- 
diery, you risked your dear self to join 
me? 

RoxANE. Because of the letters I 

Christian. The . . . ? What did you 
say ? 

Roxane. It is through your fault that 
I have been exposed to such and so many 
dangers. It is your letters that have gone 
to my head 1 Ah, think how many you 
have written me in a month, each one more 
beautiful . . . 

ChristIxVN. What ? . . . Because of a 
few little love letters . . . 

Roxane. Say nothing ! You cannot 
understand ! Listen : The truth is that I 
took to idolizing you one evening, when, be» 
low my window, in a voice I did not know 
before, your soul began to reveal itself .... 
Think then what the effect should be of 

IP2 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

your letters, which have been like your 
voice heard constantly for one month, your 
▼oice of that evening, so tender, caressing 
. . . STou must bear it as you can, I have 
come to you ! Prudent Penelope would 
not have stayed at home with her eternal 
tapestry, if Ulysses, her lord, had written 
as you write . . . but, impulsive as Helen, 
have tossed aside her yarns, and flown to 
join him ! 

Christian. But . . . 

RoxANE. I read them, I re-read them, 
in reading I grew faint ... I became your 
own indeed ! Each fluttering leaf was like 
a petal of your soul wafted to me ... In 
every word of those letters, love is felt as 
a flame would be felt,— love, compelling, 
sincere, profound . . . 

Christian. Ah, sincere, profound ? . . . 
You say that it can be felt, Roxane t 

RoxANE. He asks me 1 

Christian. And so you came ? . j 5 

RoxANE. I came— oh Christian, my own, 
my master ! If I were to kneel at your 
feet you would lift me, I know. It is my 
soul therefore which kneels, and never can 
you lift it from that posture ! — I came to 
implore your pardon — as it is fitting, for 
f^e are both perhaps about to die I — ^youf 

13 193 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

pardon for having done you the wrong, at 
first, in my shallowness, of loving you . , . 
for mere looking ! 

Christian (maZarm). Ah, Eoxane!. . • 

RoxANE. Later, dear one, grown less 
shallow — similar to a bird which flutters 
before it can fly, — your gallant exterior ap- 
pealing to me still, but your soul appealing 
equally, I loved you for both ! . . . 

Christian. And now ? 

RoxANE. Now at last yourself are van- 
quished by yourself : I love you for your 
soul alone . . . 

Christian {drawing away) . Ah , Roxane 1 

RoxANE. Rejoice ! For to be loved for 
that wherewith we are clothed so fleetingly 
must put a noble heart to torture. . . . 
Your dear thought at last casts your dear 
face in shadow : the harmonious linea- 
ments whereby at first you pleased me, 
I do not see them, now my eyes ar^ 
open! 

Christian. Oh ! 

RoxANE. You question your own 
triumph ? 

Christian {sorrowfully). Roxane! 

Roxane. I understand, you cannot con* 
teive of such a love in me ? 

Christian. I do not wish to be loved 

194 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

/ike that! I wish to be loved quite 
eimply . . . 

RoxANE. For that which other women 
till now have loved in you ? Ah, let your- 
eelf be loved in a better way 

Christian. No ... I was happier be- 
fore! . . . 

RoxANE. Ah, you do not understand! 
It is now that I love you most, that I truly 
k)ve you. It is that which makes you, you 
—can you not grasp it ? — that I wor- 
ship . . . And did you no longer walk our 
earth like a young martial Apollo . . . 

Christian. Say no more! 

RoxANE. Still would I love you! . . . 
Yes, though a blight should have fallen 
Upon your ftice and form . . . 

Christian. Do not say it ! 

RoxANE. But I do say it, ... I do! 

Christian. What ? If I were ugly, dis- 
tinctly, oftensively ? 

RoxANE. If you were ugly, dear, I 
swear it ! 

Christian. God ! 

RoxANE. And you are glad, profoundly 
glad? 

Christian {in a smothered voice} 
Ves . . . 

Roxane. What is it ? 

195 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Christian (pushing her gently awajfy, 
Nothing. I have a word or two to saj^ 
to some one : your leave, for a second . . » 

KoxANE. But . . . 

Christian {pointing at a group o/CADETa 
at the hack). In my selfish love, I have 
kept you from those poor brothers. . . . 
Go, smile on them a little, before they die, 
dear . . . go! 

RoxANE {moved). Dear Christian! 

{81ie goes toward the Gascons at fht 
hack; they respectfully gather around 
her.) 

Christian {calling toward Cyrano'^J 
tent). Cyrano! 

Cyrano {appears, armed for battle). 
What is it ? . . . How pale you are ! 

Christian. She does not love me any 
more! 

Cyrano. What do you mean ? 

Christian. She loves you. 

Cyrano. No! 

Christian. She only loves my soul! 

Cyrano. No ! 

Christian. Yes! Therefore it is yoo 
she loves . . . and you love her , . • 

Cyrano. I . . . 

Christian. I know it! 

Cyrano. It is true. 
196 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Christian. To madness! 

Cyrano. More. 

Christian. Tell her then. 

Cyrano. No ! 

Christian. Why not ? 

Cyrano. Look at me ! 

Christian. She would love me grown 
ugly. 

Cyrano. She told you so ? 

Christian. With the utmost frankness! 

Cyrano, Ah! I am glad she should 
have told you that ! But, believe me, be- 
lieve me, place no faith in such a mad as- 
severation I Dear God, I am glad such a 
thought should have come to her, and that 
she should have spoken it, — but believe 
me, do not take her at her word : Nevei 
cease to be the handsome fellow you 
are .... She would not forgive me ! 

Christian. That is what I wish to dis- 
cover. 

Cyrano. No ! no ! 

Christian. Let her choose between us ! 
You shall tell her everything. 

Cyrano. No ... No ... I refuse the 
ordeal ! 

Christian. Shall I stand in the way of 
your happiness because my outside is not 
not so much amiss ? 

197 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Cyrano. And I ? shall I destroy yours, 
because, thanks to the hazard that sets ua 
upon earth, I have the gift of expressing 
. . . what you perhaps feel ? 

Christian. You shall tell her every- 
thing ! 

Cyrano. He persists in tempting me . . . 
It is a mistake . . . and cruel ! 

Christian. I am weary of carrying 
about, in my own self, a rival ! 

Cyrano. Christian 1 

Christian. Our marriage . . . con- 
tracted without witnesses . . . can be an- 
nulled ... if we survive ! 

Cyrano. He persists ! . . . 

Christian. Yes. I will be loved for 
my sole self, or not at all ! — I am going to 
see what they are about. Look ! I will 
walk to the end of the line and back . . . 
Tell her, and let her pronounce between 
us. 

Cyrano. She will pronounce for 
you. 

Christian. I can but hope she will I 
{calling) Roxane ! 

Cyrano. No ! No ! 

Roxane {coming forward). What is it I 

Christian. Cyrano has something to 
•ell you . . . something important ! 
198 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

(RoxANE goes hurriedly to Cyrano. Exit 
Christian.) 

RoxANE. Something important ? 

Cyrano {distracted). He is gone ! . . . 
(To RoxANE.) Nothing whatever ! He 
attaches — but you must know him of old ! 
—he attaches importance to trifles . . . 

RoxANE {quickly). He did not believe 
what I told him a moment ago ? . . . I 
saw that he did not believe . . . 

Cyrano {taking her hand). But did you 
in very truth tell him the truth ? 

RoxANE. Yes. Yes. I should love him 
even . . . {She hesitates a second.) 

Cyrano {smiling sadly). You do not 
like to say it before me ? 

Roxane. But . . . 

Cyrano. I shall not mind ! . . . Even 
if he were ugly ? 

RoxANE. Yes . . . Ugly. {Musket shots 
outside.) They are firing ! 

Cyrano {ardently). Dreadfully ugly ? 

RoxANE. Dreadfully. 

Cyrano. Disfigured ? 

RoxANE. Disfigured ! 

Cyrano. Grotesque ? 

RoxANE. Nothing could make him gro- 
tesque ... to me. 

Cyrano. You would love him still ? 
199 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoxANE. I believe that I should love 
him more ... if that were possible ! 

Cyrano {losing his head^ aside). My 
God, perhaps she means it . . . perhaps it 
is true . . . and that way is happiness ! 
(TbKoxANE.) I . . . Roxane . . . listen! 

Le Bret (comes in hurriedly; calls 
softly). Cyrano ! 

Cyrano (turning). Hein ? 

Le Bret. Hush I (He whispers a few 
words to Cyrano.) 

Cyrano (letting Roxane's hand drop^ 
with a cry). Ah! . . . 

Roxane. What ails you ? 

Cyrano (to himself^ in consternation). 
It is finished ! 

(Musket reports.) 

Roxane. What is it ? What is happen- 
ing ? Who is firing ? (She goes to the 
back to look off.) 

Cyrano. It is finished. . . . My lip? 
are sealed for evermore ! 

(Cadets come in, attempting to conceal 
S07nethi7ig they carry among them ; they 
surround it, preventing Koxane's seei7ig 
it.) 

Roxane. What has happened ? 

Cyrano (quickly stopping her as sh* 
starts toward them) . Nothing ! 
200 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoxANE. These men ? . . . 

Cyrano (draivivg her aivay). Pay no 
attentioQ to them ! 

RoxANE. But what were you about to 
say to me before ? 

Cyrano. What was I about to say ? . . . 
Oh, nothing! . . . Nothing whatever, I 
assure you. {Solemnly.) I swear that 
Christian's spirit, that his soul, were . . .

greatest that . . .

Ah ! . . . {Buns to the group of Cadets,

ACT FIFTH. 
Cyrano's gazette. 

Fifteen years later, 1655. The parh 
belonging to the convent of the Sisters of 
the Cross, in Paris. 

Superb shade-trees. At the left, the

terrace ivith steps. In the centre of the 
stage, huge trees standing alone in a clear 
oval space. At the right, first wing, a 
semicircular stone seat, surrounded hy 
large hox-trees. 

All along the hach of the stage, an avenue 
of chestnut-trees, ivhich leads, at the right, 
fourth wing, to the door of a chapel seen 
through trees. Through the double row 
of trees overarching the ave^iue are seen 
lawns, other avenues, clumps of trees, the 
further recesses of the park, the shy.

It is Autumn. The leaves are turning , 
above the still fresh grass. Dark patches 
of evergreens, box and yew. Under eacn 
tree a mat of yellow leaves. Fallen leavif 
litter the whole stage, crackle underfoct, 
lie thick on the terrace and the seats. 

Between the seat at the right and the 
tree in the centre, a large embroidery 
frame, in front of which a small chair. 
Baskets full of wools, in skei?is and balls. 
On the frame, a piece of tapestry, partl][ 
do7ie. 

At the rise of the curtain, nuns come 
and go in the park ; a few are seated on 
the stone seat around an older nun; 
leaves are falling. 

Sister Martha {to Moth3:r Margaret). 
Sister Claire, after putting on her cap 
went back to the mirror, to see herself, 
again. 

Mother Margaret {to Sister Claire). 
It was unbecoming, my child. 

Sister Claire. But Sister Martha, to- 
day, after finishing her portion, went back 
to the tart for a plum. I saw her! 

Mother Margaret {to Sister Martha).. 
My child, it was ill done.

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Sister Claire. I merely glanced! . . . 

Sister Martha. The plum was about so 
big ! . . . 

Mother Margaret. This evening, when 
Monsieur Cyrano comes, I will tell him. 

Sister Claire (alarmed) . No ! He will 
laugh at us ! 

Sister Martha. He will say that nuns 
are very vain ! 

Sister Claire. And very greedy ! 

Mother Margaret. And really very 
good. 

Sister Claire. Mother Margaret, is it [ 
not true that he has come here every 
Saturday in the last ten years ? 

Mother Margaret. Longer! Ever since 
his cousin brought among our linen coifs 
her coif of crape, the worldly symbol of 
her mourning, which settled like a sable 
bird amidst our flock of white some four 
teen years ago. 

Sister Martha. He alone, since she 
took her abode in our cloister, has art to 
dispel her never-lessening sorrow. 

All the Nuns. He is so droll ! — It is 
merry when he comes ! — He teases us !^ 
He is delightful !— We are greatly attached 
to him ! — We are making Angelica pasta 
to offer him ! 

209 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Sister Martha. He is not, however, a 
Tjery good Catholic ! 

Sister Claire. We will convert him. 

The Nuns. We will ! We will ! 

Mother Margaret. I forbid your re« 
Hewing that attempt, my children. Do 
not trouble him ; he might not come sa 
often ! 

Sister Martha. But . . . God ! 

Mother Margaret. Set your hearts at 
rest : God must know him of old ! 

Sister Martha. But every Saturday, 
when he comes, he says to me as soon aa 
he sees me, ' ' Sister, I ate meat, yester- 
day ! " 

Mother Margaret. Ah, that is what he 
says ? . . . Well, when he last said it, he 
had eaten nothing for two days. 

Sister Martha. Mother ! 

Mother Margaret. He is poor. 

Sister Martha. Who told you ? 

Mother Margaret. Monsieur Le Bret. 

Sister Martha. Does no one offer him 
assistance ? 

Mother Margaret. No, he would take 
offence.

come forward silently, and stop near the 
embroidery frame. A pause.) 

De Guiche. And so you live here, use- 
lessly fair, always in mourning ? 

RoxANE. Always. 

De Guiche. As faithful as of old ? 

RoxANE. As faithful. 

De Guiche {after a time). Have vou 
forgiven me ? 

RoxANE. Since I am here. 

{Other silence.) 

De Guiche, And he was really such a 
rare being ? 

311 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

RoxANE. To understand, one must 
have known him ! 

De Guiche. Ah, one must have known 
him ! . . . Perhaps I did not know him 
well enough. And his last letter, still and 
always, against your heart ? 

Roxane. I wear it on this velvet, as a 
more holy scapular. 

De Guiche. Even dead, you love him ? 

Roxane. It seems to me sometimes he 
is but half dead, that our hearts have not 
been severed, that his love still wraps me 
round, no less than ever living ! 

De Guiche {after another silence). Does 
Cyrano come here to see you ? 

Roxane. Yes, often. That faithful 
friend fulfils by me the office of gazette. 
His visits are regular. He comes : when 
the weather is fine, his armchair is brought 
out under the trees. I wait for him here 
with my work ; the hour strikes ; on the 
last stroke, I hear — I do not even turn to 
see who comes ! — his cane upon the steps ; 
he takes his seat ; he rallies me upon my 
never-ending tapestry ; he tells off the 
events of the week, and . . . (Le Bret op- 
pears on the steps) Ah, Le Bret ! (Lh 
Bret comes dozen the steps) ! How doea 
your friend ? 

212 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. 111. 

The Duke. Oh ! 

RoxANE. He exaggerates ! . . . 

Le Bret. All is come to pass as I fore* 
told : neglect ! poverty ! his writings ever 
breeding him new enemies ! Fraud he 
attacks in every embodiment : usurpers, 
pious pretenders, plagiarists, asses in 
lions' skins ... all I He attacks all ! 

Roxane. No one, however, but stands in 
profound respect of his sword. They will 
never succeed in silencing him. 

De Guiche {shaking his head). Who 
knows ? 

Le Bret. What I fear is not the ag- 
gression of man ; what I fear is loneliness 
and want and winter creeping upon him 
like stealthy wolves in his miserable attic \ 
they are the insidious foes that will have 
him by the throat at last ! . . . Every day 
he tightens his belt by an eyelet ; his poor 
great nose is pinched, and turned the sal- 
low of old ivory ; the worn black serge you 
see him in is the only coat he has ! 

De Guiche. Ah, there is one who did 
not succeed! . . . Nevertheless, do not 
pity him too much. 

Le Bret {icith a hitter smile). Mai> 
Bhall . . . 

215 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

De Guiche. Do not pity him too much.' 
he signed no bonds with the world ; he has 
lived free in his thought as in his actions. 

Le Bret {as above). Duke . . . 

De Guiche {haughtily). I know, yes: I 
have everything, he has nothing. . . . 
But I should like to shake hands with him. 
CBott'mgf toRoxANE.) Good-bye. 

EoxANE. I will go with you to the door. 

(De Guiche hows to Le Bret and goes 
with RoxANE toward the terrace stejjs.) 

De Guiche {stopping.^ while she goes up 
the steps). Yes, sometimes I envy him. 
You see, when a man has succeeded too 
well in life, he is not unlikely to feel — dear 
me! without having committed any very 
serious wrong! — a multitudinous disgust 
of himself, the sum of which does not con- 
stitute a real remorse, but an obscure un- 
easiness ; and a ducal mantle, while it 
sweeps up the stairs of greatness, may trail 
in its furry lining a rustling of ser^ illusions 
and regrets, as, when you slowly climb to- 
ward those doors, your black gown trails 
the withered leaves. 

RoxANE {ironical). Are you not un- 
usually pensive ? . , . 

De Guiche. Ah, yes! {As he is about 
to leave^ abruptly.) Monsieur Le Bretl

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

iTo RoxANE.) Will you allow me ? A 
word. {He goes to Le Bret, and lowering 
his voice.) It is true that no one will dar» 
overtly to attack your friend, but many 
have him in particular disrelish ; and 
some one was saying to me yesterday, at 
the Queen's, "It seems not unlikely that 
this Cyrano will meet with an accident.'* 

Le Bret. Ah ? . . . 

De Guiche. Yes. Let him keep in- 
doors. Let him be cautious. 

Le Bret (lifting his arms totvaroi 
Heaven). Cautious! . . . He is coming 
here. I will warn him. Warn him ! . . . 
Yes, but . . . 

Roxane {who has been standing at th6 
head of the steps., to a nun who comes to- 
ward her). What is it ? 

The Nun. Ragueneau begs to see you, 
Madame. 

Roxane. Let him come in. (To D' 
Guiche and Le Bret.) He comes to plead 
dstress. Having determined one day ta 
be an author, he became in turn precen'

RoxANE {smiling) . Begin telhng your mis 
fortunes to Le Bret. I am coming back. 

Ragueneau. But, Madame . . . 

(RoxANE leaves without listening, with 
ihe Duke. Ragueneau goes to Le Bret). 

Ragueneau. It is better so. Since you 
are here, I had liefer not< tell her! Less 
than half an hour ago, I was going to see 
your friend. I was not thirty feet from 
his door, when I saw him come out. I 
hurried to catch up with him. He waa 
about to turn the corner. I started to run, 
when from a window below which he was 
passing — was it pure mischance ? It may 
have been! — a lackey drops a block of 
wood . . . 

Le Bret. Ah, the cowards! . . . 
Cyrano ! 

Ragueneau. I reach the spot, and find 
him . . . 

Le Bret. Horrible ! 

Ragueneau. Our friend, Monsieur, oui 
poet, stretched upon the ground, with a 
great hole in his head ! 
216 



Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. He is dead ? 

Bagueneau. No, but . . . God have 
mercy ! I carried him to his lodging . . , 
flh, his lodging ! You should see that 
lodging of his ! 

Le Bret. Is he in pain ? 

Ragueneau. No, Monsieur, he is uncon 
Bcious. 

Le Bret. Has a doctor seen him ? 

Ragueneau. One came . . . out of 
good nature. 

Le Bret. My poor, poor Cyrano ! . . . 
We must not tell Roxane outright. And 
the doctor ? . . . 

Ragueneau. He talked ... I hardly 
grasped ... of fever . . . cerebral in- 
flammation ! Ah, if you should see him, 
with his head done up in cloths ! . . . Let 
us hurry . . . No one is there to tend 
him . . . And he might die if he attempted 
to get up ! 

Le Bret {dragging Ragueneau off at the 
right). This way. Come, it is shorter

Cyrano. Cousin, it was a troublesome 
Madam. 

RoxANE. You excused yourself ? 

Cyrano. Yes. I said, ''Your pardon, 
but this is Saturday, on which day I am 
due in certain dwelling. On no account 
do I ever fail. Come back in an hour ! " 

RoxANE {lightly). Well, she will have 
to wait some time to see you. I shall not 
let you go before evening. 

Cyrano. Perhaps ... I shall have to 
go a little earlier. {He closes his eyes and 
is silent a tnoment.)

from the chapel to the terrace. Roxanbi 
sees her and beckons to her by a slight mo- 
tion of her head.)

reasonable to-day ! 

RoxANE {hearing them ivhisper). She is 
trying to convert you ? 

Sister Martha. Indeed I am not ! 

Cyrano. It is true, you, usually almost 
discursive in the holy cause, are reading 
me no sermon! You amaze me! {With 
comical fury.) I will amaze you, too !

it ! In that brief fluttering from bough to 
ground, how they contrive still to put 
beauty ! And though foredoomed to 
moulder upon the earth that draws them, 
they wish their fall invested with the grace 
of a free bird's flight !

more closely over his head, and shrinks 
back in his armchair in terror) . No ! no !

close to him, makes a gesture of dismay and 
hangs his head. Then, in the darkness

a hero, with an honest sword through his 
heart ! " I am quoting from myself ! . . . 
Fate will have his laugh at us ! . . . Here 
am I killed, in a trap, from behind, by a

a decent death ! -^ ^

nant ! Yesterday, they were giving Sea- 
pin, and I saw that he has appropriated a 
scene of yours. 

Le Bret. A whole scene ? 

Ragueneau. Yes, monsieur. The one 
In which occurs the famous " What the 
devil was he 4oing in . . ."

Cyrano de Bergerac. 

Le Bret. Moliere has taken that from 
fou I 

Cyrano. Hush ! hush ! He did well to 
take it! (To Ragueneau.) The scene was 
very effective, was it not ? 

Ragueneau. Ah, monsieur, the public 
laughed . . . laughed ! 

Cyrano. Yes, to the end, I shall have 
Wen the one who prompted . . . and was 
forgotten! (To Roxane.) Do you remem- 
ber that evening on which Christian spoke 
fco you from bel(?w the balcony ? There 
was the epitome of my life : while 1 
have stood below in darkness, others have 
climbed to gather the kiss and glory ! It- 
is well done, and on the brink of my grave 1 
approve it : Moliere has genius . . . Chris- 
tian was a fine fellow ! (At this moment, 
the chapel bell having rung, the Nuns are 
seen passing at the bach, along the avenue, 
on their way to service.) Let them hasten 
to their prayers . . . the bell is summon- 
ing them . . . 

RoxANE (rising and calling). Sister \ 
Sister ! 

Cyrano (holding her bach). No! Nol 
do not leave me to fetch anybody ! When 
you came back I might not be here to re- 
joice . . . (The Nuns have gone into thi

thapel; the organ is heard.) I longed for 
a little music ... it comes in time ! 

RoxANE. I love you . . . you shall 
live! 

Cyrano. No ! for it is only in the fairy- 
tale that the shy and awkward prince 
when he hears the beloved say ' ' I love 
you ! " feels his ungainliness melt and 
drop from him in the sunshine of those 
words I . . . But you would always know 
full well, dear Heart, that there had taken 
place in your poor slave no beautifying 
change ! 

KoxANE. I have hurt you ... I have 
wrecked your life, I! . . . I! 

Cyrano. You? . . . The reverse! Wa« 
man's sweetness I had never known. My 
mother . . . thought me unflattering. I 
liad no sister. Later, I shunned Love's 
cross-road in fear of mocking eyes. To 
you I owe having" had, at least, among 
the gentle and fair, a friend. Thanks to 
you there has papsed across my life the 
rustle of a woman's gown. 

Le Bret {calling his attention to the 
moonlight peering through the branches). 
Your other friend, among the gentle 
and fair, is there . . . she comes to sea 
you!

Cyrano (smiling to the moon) . I see her' 

RoxANE. I never loved but one . . . 
and twice I lose him ! 

Cyrano. Le Bret, I shall ascend inta 
the opalescent moon, without need thi< 
time of a flying-machine ! 

RoxANE. What are you saying ? 

Cyrano. Yes, it is there, you may be 
sure, I shall be sent for my Paradise. 
More than one soul of those I have 
loved must be apportioned there . . . 
There I shall find Socrates and Galileo ! 

Le Bret (in revolt). No ! No ! It is too 
senseless, too cruel, too unfair I So true a 
poet ! So great a heart ! To die . . . like 
this ! To die ! . . . 

Cyrano. As ever . . . Le Bret is 
grumbling ! 

Le Bret {bursting into tears). My 
friend ! My friend ! 

Cyrano {lifting himself, his eyes ivild). 
They are the Gascony Cadets ! . . . Man 
in the gross . . . Eh, yes ! . . . the weak- 
ness of the weakest point . . . 

Le Bret. Learned . . . even in his 
delirium ! . . . 

Cyrano. Copernicus said . . .

Cyrano. But what the devil wa« he

dropped in his chair; Roxane's iceeping 
calls him back to reality ; he looks at her 
and gently stroking her mourning veil.) I 
do not wish . . . indeed, I do not wish . . . 
that you should sorrow less for Christian,

that when the everlasting cold shall have 
seized upon my fibres, this funereal veil 
should have a twofold meaning, and the 
mourning you wear for him be worn for 
me too ... a little I

raises his sword.) What are you saying i

I will fight you, I will fight you, I will

sweeping circles, and stops, panting.) Yes, 
you have wrested from me everything, 
'*»urel as well as rose . . . Work your 
TVills! . . . Spite of your worst, some-
