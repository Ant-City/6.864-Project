Thought - 
                Thought
is the second highest grade of cognitive activity. As with understanding,
the objects of thought are the Forms of the intelligible realm.
Unlike understanding, though, thought can only proceed 
with the crutches of images and hypotheses (i.e. unproven assumptions).
See also Belief, 
Imagination, Understanding.
