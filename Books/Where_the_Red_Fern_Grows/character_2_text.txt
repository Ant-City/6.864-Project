 heart.
in the center of the heart were two names,
â€œdanâ€  and  â€œann.â€  the  name  dan  was  a
little  larger  than  ann.  it  was  wide  and
bold. the scar stood out more. the name
ann  was  small,  neat,  and  even.  i  stared
unbelievingâ€”for  there  were  my  names.
they were perfect.

i walked over and picked up my pups.
looking  at  him,  i  said,  â€œyour  name  is
dan.  iâ€™ll  call  you  old  dan.â€  looking  at

her, i said, â€œyour name, little girl, is ann.
iâ€™ll call you little ann.â€

i stayed at the campground until dark. i

it  was  then  i  realized  it  was  all  too
perfect.  here  in  this  fishermenâ€™s  camp,  i
had  found  the  magazine  and  the  ad.  i
looked  over  at  the  old  sycamore  log.
there i had asked god to help me get two
hound pups. there were the pups, rolling
and playing in the warm sand. i thought of
the old k. c. baking powder can, and the
fishermen. how freely they had given their
nickels and dimes.

i  looked  up  again  to  the  names  ca

â€œboy, thatâ€™s a keen way of getting out of

my  pups  were  put  in  the  corncrib  for
the night. i covered them with shucks and
kissed them good night.

the  next  day  was  a  busy  one  for  me.
with  the  hampering  help  of  my  sisters  i
made the little doghouse.

papa  cut  the  ends  off  his  check  lines
and  gave  them  to  me  for  collars.  with
painstaking care, deep in the tough leather
i  scratched  the  name  â€œold  danâ€  on  one
and â€œlittle annâ€ on the other. with a nail

and  a  rock  two  holes  were  punched  in
each end of the straps. i put them around
their  small  necks  and  laced  the  ends
together with bailing wire.

that  evening  i  had  a  talk  with  my
mother.  i  told  her  about  praying  for  the
two  pups,  about  the  magazine  and  the
plans  i  had  made.  i  told  her  how  hard  i
had tried to find names for them and how
strange  it  was  finding  them  carved  in  the
bark of a sycamore tree.

pup. his little black nose was split wide
open and was bleeding.

i  saw  a  relieved  look  come  over

mamaâ€™s face.

looking  at  me,  she  started  shaking  her
head.  â€œi  donâ€™t  know,â€  she  said.  â€œi  just
donâ€™t know.â€

â€œdid  that  coon  get  hold  of  this  pup?â€

papa asked.

â€œhe  sure  did,  papa,â€  i  said,  â€œbut  it
wasnâ€™t  the  coonâ€™s  fault.  if  it  hadnâ€™t  been
for little ann, heâ€™d have eaten him up.â€

i  told  how  my  dogs  had  tied  into  the

coon.

papa  laughed  as  he  fondled  my  pup.
â€œthis dog is going to be a coon hound,â€ he
said, â€œand i mean a good one.â€

the  coon  started  squalling  as  soon  as

we came in sight.

â€œmy  goodness,â€  mama  said,  â€œyou
wouldnâ€™t think anything so small would be
so vicious.â€

papa  picked  up  a  club.  â€œnow
everybody stand back out of the way,â€ he
said. â€œthis wonâ€™t take long.â€

 down  on  their
rears,  they  would  cry  and  beg  for  help.
with a pup under each arm, iâ€™d wade out
into  the  stream  and  set  them  down  in  the
cool water. nine times out of ten, one pup
would  swim  one  way  and  the  other  one
would  go  just  the  opposite  way.  i  had  a
time with this part of their training, but my
persistence had no bounds.

it  wasnâ€™t  long  until  they  loved  the
water. old dan would jump as far out as
he  could  and  practically  knock  the  river
dry. little ann would ease herself in and
swim  like  a  muskrat  for  the  opposite
shore.

i taught my dogs every trick i knew and
any new ones i heard about. i taught them
how  to  split  up  on  a  riverbank  to  search
for  the  hidden  trail,  because  it  was

impossible  to  tell  where  a  coon  would
come  out  of  the  water.  sometimes  he
might  swim  downstream  and  other  times
he might swim upstream. maybe he would
come back to the bank he had just left, or
he  would  cross  over  to  the  ot

we all had to laugh at her.
the last thing i heard as i left the house
was the voice of my mother. â€œbe careful,
billy,â€ she said, â€œand donâ€™t stay out late.â€
it was a beautiful night, still and frosty.
a  big  grinning  ozark  moon  had  the
countryside bathed in a soft yellow glow.

handle broken off.

e  of  them  to  bawl,
but when it came it startled me. the deep
tones  of  old  danâ€™s  voice  jarred  the
silence  around  me.  i  dropped  my  ax  and
almost  dropped  my  lantern.  a  strange
feeling came over me. i took a deep breath
and threw back my head to give the call of
the hunter, but something went wrong. my
throat felt like it had been tied in a knot. i
swallowed a couple of times and the knot
disappeared.

as loud as i could, i whooped, â€œwho-

e-e-e. get him, dan. get him.â€

little ann came in. the bell-like tones
of  her  voice  made  shivers  run  up  and
down my spine. i whooped to her. â€œwho-
e-e-e.  tell  it  to  him,  little  girl.  tell  it  to
him.â€

this was what i had prayed for, worked

and  sweated  for,  my  own  little  hounds
bawling  on  the  trail  of  a  river  coon.  i
donâ€™t know why i cried, but i did. while
the  tears  rolled,  i  whooped  again  and
again.

they  straightened  the  trail  out  and
headed down river. i took off after them as
fast as

experienced  coon  hound,  the  crude  trick
would  have  been  nothing  at  all,  but  my
dogs  were
just  big,  awkward  pups,

trailing their first live coon.

i stood and watched, wondering if they
would  remember  the  training  i  had  given
them.  now  and  then  i  would  whoop,
urging them on.

old  dan  was  having  a  fit.  he  whined
and he bawled. he whimpered and cried.
he came to me and reared up, begging for
help.

little ann came to me. i could see the
pleading  in  her  warm  gray  eyes.  â€œiâ€™m
ashamed  of  you,  little  girl,â€  i  said.  â€œi

â€œiâ€™m not going to help you,â€ i scolded,
â€œand  youâ€™re  not  going  to  find  him  out  on
that  drift.  if  you  would  just  remember
some of the training i gave you, you could
find the trail. now go find that coon.â€

he ran back out on the drift and started

searching.

said.  â€œi  know  he  climbed  it,  but  heâ€™s  not
there now. maybe itâ€™s like grandpa said,
he just climbed right on out through the top
and disappeared in the stars.â€

my dogs didnâ€™t know it, but i was pretty
well  convinced  that  that  was  what  the
coon had done.

they wouldnâ€™t give up. once again they
crossed over to the other shore. it was no
use.  the  coon  hadnâ€™t  touched  that  bank.
they  came  back.  old  dan  went  up  the
river and little ann worked downstream.
an  hour  and  a  half  later  they  gave  up
and  came  to  me  begging  for  help.  i  knelt
down  between  their  wet  bodies.  while  i

â€œiâ€™m not mad,â€ i said. â€œi know you did
your best. if that coon can fool both of us,
then weâ€™re just beat. weâ€™ll go someplace
else  to  hunt.  heâ€™s  not  the  only  coon  in
these bottoms.â€

just  as  i  picked  up  my  ax  and  lantern,
little  ann  let  out  a  bawl  and  tore  out
down  the  riverbank.  old  dan,  with

  a
bewildered  look  on  his  face,  stood  for  a
moment  looking  after  her.  then,  raising
his  head  high  in  the  air,  he  made  my

hear  the  underbrush  popping  as  he  ran  to
join her.

scratched and petted them, i let them know
that i still loved them.

i  couldnâ€™t  figure  out  what  had  taken
place. surely little ann had heard or seen
something. i could tell by their voices that

whatever it was they were after, they were
close enough to see it and were probably
running by sight.

the animal left the bottoms and headed
for the mountains. whatever it was, it must
have  realized  my  dogs  were  crowding  it
too closely. at the edge of the foothills it
turned and came back toward the river.

i was still trying to figure out what was
going on, when i realized that on striking
the river the animal had again tu

on the trunk, and started bawling.

â€œi know heâ€™s there,â€ i said, â€œbut thereâ€™s
nothing i can do. i canâ€™t climb it. why itâ€™s
sixty feet up to the first limb and it would
take me a month to cut it down.â€

there had been very little hope from the
beginning, but on seeing the hollow i gave
up.  â€œcome  on,â€  i  said  to  my  dogs.
â€œthereâ€™s  nothing  i  can  do.  weâ€™ll  go
someplace else and find another coon.â€

again i turned and started on my way.
little ann  came  to  me.  she  reared  up
and started licking my hands. swallowing
the  knot  in  my  throat,  i  said,  â€œiâ€™m  sorry,
little girl. i want him just as badly as you
do, but thereâ€™s no way i can get him.â€

she  ran  back  to  the  tree  and  started
digging  in  the  soft  ground  close  to  the
roots.

â€œcome on now,â€ i said in a gruff voice.
â€œyouâ€™re  both  acting  silly. you  know  iâ€™d
get the coon for you if i could but i canâ€™t.â€
with  a  whipped-dog  look  on  her

and you would do the rest.â€

with tears in my eyes, i looked again at
the big sycamore. a wave of anger came
over me. gritting my teeth, i said, â€œi donâ€™t

care how big you are, iâ€™m not going to let
my  dogs  down.  i  told  them  if  they  put  a
coon in a tree i would do the rest and iâ€™m
going  to.  iâ€™m  going  to  cut  you  down.  i
donâ€™t care if it takes me a whole year.â€

i walked over and sank my ax as deep
as  i  could  in  the  smooth  white  bark.  my
dogs threw a fit. little ann started turning
in  circles.  i  could  hear  her  pleased
whimpering  cry.  old  dan  bawled  and
started gnawing on the big treeâ€™s trunk.

at  first  it  was  easy.  my  ax  was  sharp
and the chips flew. two hours later things
were different. my arms felt like two dead
grapevines, and my back felt like someone
had pulled a plug out of one end of it and
drained all the sap out.

while  taking  a  breather,  i  saw  i  was
making  more  progress  than  i  thought  i

fifteen  or  twenty  feet.  he  then  turned
around and came down in his same tracks.
he backtracked on his original trail for a
way. when he heard your dogs coming he
leaped  far  up  on  the  side  of  the  nearest
tree  and  climbed  up.  he  was  in  that  tree
all the time your dogs were searching for

the lost trail. after everything had quieted
down,  he  figured  that  they  had  given  up.
thatâ€™s  when  he  came  down  and  thatâ€™s

very  seriously,  â€œyou  mark  my  word,

i  quit  the  table  on  the  run  and  headed
for  my  doghouse.  i  didnâ€™t  have  to  go  all
the way. little ann met me on the porch. i
asked her where old dan was and called

his name. he was nowhere around.

little ann started acting strangely. she

back, and reared up on me.

â€œiâ€™m  going  to  get  him,  mama,â€  i  said,
â€œand  iâ€™m  going  to  get  him  today  if  i

papa  laughed  and  said,  â€œlooks  like
there  wasnâ€™t  any  use  in  building  that
scarecrow. all you had to do was tell old
dan to stay and watch the tree.â€

i left the house in a run. now and then i
would  stop  and  whoop.  each  time  i  was
answered by the deep voice of old dan.

little ann ran ahead of me. by the time
i  reached  the  big  tree,  their  voices  were
making the bottoms ring.

when  i  came

tearing  out  of

the
underbrush, old dan threw a fit. he tried
to  climb  the  sycamore.  he  would  back
way off, then, bawling and running as fast
as he could, he would claw his way far up
on its side.

little ann, not to be outdone, reared up
and  placed  her  small  front  paws  on  the
smooth  white  bark.  she  told  the  ringtail
coon that she knew he was there.

you coming back. the coon wouldnâ€™t have
gotten  away.  thatâ€™s  why  we  built  the
scarecrow.â€

little ann came over and started rolling
in  the  leaves.  the  way  i  was  feeling
toward  her,  i  couldnâ€™t  even  smile  at  her
playful mood. â€œof course you feel good,â€
i  said  in  an  irritated  voice,  â€œand  itâ€™s  no
wonder, you had a good nightâ€™s sleep in a
nice warm doghouse, but old dan didnâ€™t.
he  was  down  here  in  the  cold  all  by
himself, watching the tree. the way youâ€™re

skyward and rained out over the bottoms.
with a cyclone roar, the big tree crashed
to the ground, and then silence settled over
the bottoms.

out of the broken, twisted, tangled mass
streaked  a  brown  furry  ball.  i  turned  my
dogs  loose  and  started  screaming  at  the
top of my voice, â€œget him, dan, get him.â€
in  his  eagerness,  old  dan  ran  head  on
into a bur oak tree. he sat down and with
his deep voice told the river bottoms that

it was little ann who caught the coon. i
heard the ringtail squall when she grabbed
him. scared half to death, i snatched up a
club and ran to help her.

the coon was all over her. he climbed
up  on  her  head,  growling,  slashing,
ripping,  and  tearing.  yelping  with  pain,
she shook him off and he streaked for the
river. i thought surely he was going to get
away. at the very edge of the riverâ€™s bank,
she caught him again.

anger at the bur oak tree was taken out on
the coon.

them and pinned him to the ground. it was

timber  of  the  bottoms,  tearing  my  way

logs,

it wasnâ€™t too hard for a smart old coon
to fool old dan, but there were none that
prowled the riverbanks that could fool my
little ann.

as grandpa had predicted, the price of
coonskins  jumped  sky-high.  a  good-size
hide  was  worth  from  four  to  ten  dollars,
depending on the grade and quality.

i  kept  the  side  of  our  smokehouse
plastered  with  hides.  of  course  i  would

grandpa would never say anything while i
was  telling  my  stories.  he  just  puttered
around the store with a silly little grin on
his  face.  once  in  a  while  when  i  got  too
far  off  the  beaten  path,  he  would  come
around  and  cram  a  bar  of  soap  in  my
pocket. my face would get all red, iâ€™d cut
my story short, fly out the door, and head
for home.

dog.â€ â€œsome of these nights a big old coon
is  going  to  carry  her  off  to  his  den  and
raise some little coon puppies.â€

i always took their kidding with a smile
on my face, but it made my blood boil like
the  water  in  mamaâ€™s  teakettle.  i  had  one
way  of  shutting  them  up.  â€œletâ€™s  all  go  in

the  opposite.  he
strutted  around  with  a  belligerent  and
tough  attitude.  although  he  wasnâ€™t  a  tall
dog, he was heavy. his body was long and
his  chest  broad  and  thick.  his  legs  were
short,  big,  and  solid.  the  muscles  in  his
body  were  hard  and  knotty.  when  he
walked,  they  would  twist  and  jerk  under
the skin.

he was a friendly dog. there were no
strangers to him. he loved everyone. yet

he was a strange dog. he would not hunt
with another hound, other than little ann,
or another hunter, not even my father. the
strangest thing about old dan was that he
would  not  hunt,  even  with  me,  unless
little ann was with him. i found this out
the first night i tried it.

little ann  had  cut  the  pad  of  her  right
foot on a sharp jagged flint rock. it was a
nasty  cut.  i  made  a  little  boot  of  leather
and  put  it  on  her  wounded  foot.  to  keep
her from following me, i locked her in the
corncrib.

two nights later i decided to take old
dan hunting for

by  some  strange  twist  of  nature,  little
ann  was  destined  to  go  through  life
without  being  a  mother.  perhaps  it  was
because  she  was  stunted  in  growth,  or
maybe because she was the runt in a large
litter. that may have had something to do
with it.

imes  when  i
came  home,  the  sun  was  high  in  the  sky.
after each hunt, i always took care of my
dogs. the flint rocks and saw briers were
hard  on  their  feet.  with  a  bottle  of
peroxide  and  a  can  of  salve  i  would
doctor their wounds.

i  never  knew  what  to  expect  from  old
dan.  i  never  saw  a  coon  hound  so
determined  or  one  that  could  get  into  so
many predicaments. more than one time, it
would  have  been  the  death  of  him  if  it
hadnâ€™t been for smart little ann.

one  night,  not  long  after  i  had  entered
the bottoms, my dogs struck the trail of an
old boar coon. he was a smart old fellow
and had a sackful of tricks. he crossed the
river time after time. finally, swimming to
the middle and staying in the swift current,

he swam downstream.

knowing  he  would  have  to  come  out

in the moonlight.

little ann worked downriver, and then
she came up. i saw her when she passed
me  going  up
the  bank,  sniffing  and
searching  for  the  trail.  she  came  back  to
me. i patted her head, scratched her ears,
and talked to her. she kept staring across
the river to where old dan was searching
for the trail.

she waded in and swam across to help
him. i knew that the coon had not come out
of  the  river  on  her  side.  if  he  had,  she
would have found the trail. i walked up to

across.

my dogs worked the riverbank, up and
down.  they  circled  far  out  into  the
bottoms. i could hear the loud snuffing of
old dan. he was bewildered and mad. i
was  getting  a  thrill  from  it  all,  as  i  had
never seen them fooled like this.

there  was  a  loud  splash.  i  saw  old

old dan gave up on his side, piled into
the  river,  and  swam  across  to  the  side
little ann had worked. i knew that it was
useless for him to do that.

i was on the point of giving up, calling
them to me, and going elsewhere to hunt,
when  i  heard  the  bawl  of  little  ann.  i
couldnâ€™t believe what i heard. she wasnâ€™t
bawling on a trail. she was sounding the
tree bark. i hurried down the bank.

clearly.  his  powerful  front  legs  were

g the water.

then i saw a sight that makes a hunterâ€™s
heart  swell  with  pride.  still  swimming,
old  dan  raised  his  head  high  out  of  the
water and bawled. he couldnâ€™t wait until
he  reached  the  bank  to  tell  little ann  he
was coming. from far out in the river he
told her.

reaching  the  shallows,  he  plowed  out
of  the  river  onto  a  sand  bar.  not  even
taking  time  to  shake  the  water  from  his
body,  again  he  raised  his  head  and
bawled, and tore out down the bank.

in  a  trot,  i  followed,  whooping  to  let
them  know  i  was  coming.  before  i

reached  the  tree,  old  danâ€™s  deep  voice
was making the timber shake.

the  tree  was  a  large  birch,  standing
right  on  the  bank

of  the  river.  the  swift
current  had  eaten  away  at  the  footing,
causing it to lean. the lower branches of
the tree dangled in the water.

i  saw  how  the  smart  old  coon  had
pulled  his  trick.  coming  in  toward  the
bank  from  midstream,  he  had  caught  the
dangling limbs and climbed up. exhausted
from the long swim, he stayed there in the
birch thinking he had outsmarted my dogs.
i couldnâ€™t understand how little ann had
found him.

it was impossible to fall the tree toward
the bottoms. it was too much off balance. i
did the next best thing. i cut a long elder
switch. unbuckling one of my suspenders,

i tied it to the end and climbed the tree.

the coon was sitting in a fork of a limb.
taking my switch, i whopped him a good
one  and  out  he  came.  he  sailed  out  over
the  river.  with  a  loud  splash,  he  hit  the
water  and  swam  for  the  other  side.  my
dogs jumped off the bank after him. they

an  into  the  river.  on
the other side was a bluff. i could hear one
of my dogs over there. as i watched and
waited, i heard a dog jump in the water. it
was  little  ann.  she  swam  across  and
came up to me. staying with me for just a
second,  she  jumped  in  the  slough  and
swam back to the other side.

i could hear her sniffing and whining. i
couldnâ€™t  figure  out  where  old  dan  was.
by squatting down and holding the lantern
high over my head, i could dimly see the

opposite bank. little ann was running up
and down. i noticed she always stayed in
one  place  of  about  twenty-five  yards,
never leaving that small area.

she  ran  down  to  the  waterâ€™s  edge  and
stared  out  into  the  slough.  the  horrible
thought came that old dan had drowned. i
knew a big coon was capable of drowning
a  dog  in  water  by  climbing  on  his  head
and forcing him under.

as  fast  as  i  could  run,  i  circled  the
slough,  climbed  up  over  the  bluff,  and
came down to where little ann wa

was sure he was gone.

several  minutes  passed,  and  all  that
time  little  ann  had  never  stopped.
running here and there along the bank, she
kept sniffing and whining.

i  heard  when  she  started  digging.  i
looked around. she was ten feet from the
waterâ€™s  edge.  i  got  up  and  went  over  to
her. she was digging in a small hole about
the size of a big apple. it was the air hole
for a muskrat den.

i pulled little ann away from the hole,
knelt  down,  and  put  my  ear  to  it.  i  could
hear something, and feel a vibration in the
ground. it was an eerie sound and seemed
to  be  coming  from  far  away.  i  listened.
finally i understood what the noise was.

it was the voice of old dan. little ann
had  opened  the  hole  up  enough  with  her
digging  so  his  voice  could  be  heard
faintly. in some way he had gotten into that
old muskrat den.

i knew that down under the bank, in the
water,  the  entrance

my ax and lantern, i ran for home. picking
up a long-handled shovel, i hurried back.
the sun was high in the sky before i had
dug  old  dan  out.  he  was  a  sight  to  see,
nothing but mud from the tip of his nose to
the end of his tail. i held on to his collar
and led him down to the river to wash him
off.  the  water  there  was  much  warmer

than the cold spring water of the slough.

after washing him, i turned him loose.
right  back  to  the  hole  he  ran.  little ann
was already digging. i knew the coon was
still there. working together, we dug him
out.

after  the  coon  was  killed,  i  saw  what
had  made  him  so  smart.  his  right  front
foot  was  twisted  and  shriveled.  at  one
time  he  must  have  been  caught  in  a  trap
and  had  pulled  himself  free.  he  was  an
old coon. his face was almost white. he
was big and heavy and had beautiful fur.

tired, muddy, wet, and hungry, i started

for home.

iâ€™ve  often  wondered  how  old  dan  got

path  of  the  cyclone  was  several  miles
wide  and  several  miles  long.  it  was
wonderful  place  to  hunt  as  it  abounded
with game.

my dogs had struck the trail of a coon
about  an  hour  before.  they  had  really
been warming him up. i knew it was about
time  for  him  to  take  up  a  tree,  and  sure
enough, i heard the deep voice of old dan
telling the world he had a coon up a tree.

i  was  trotting  along,  going  to  them,
when  his  voice  stopped.  i  could  hear

little ann,  but  not  old  dan.  i  wondered
why,  and  was  a  little  scared,  for  i  just
knew  something  had  happened.  then  i
heard  his  voice.  it  seemed  louder  than  it
had been before. i felt much better.

when  i  came  up  to  the  tree  i  thought
little  ann  had  treed  old  dan.  she  was
sitting  on  her  haunches  staring  up  and
bawling  the  tree  bark.  there,  a  good
fifteen feet from the ground, with his hind
legs  planted  firmly  in  the  center  of  a  big
limb, and his

between  the  eyes.  this  did  rile  me  up.  i
didnâ€™t like to be kissed like that. it seemed
that i could practically rub my skin off and
still feel it, all wet and sticky, and kind of
burning.

sometime  on  the  fifth  night,  the  storm
blew itself out and it snowed about three
inches. the next morning i went out to my
doghouse.  scraping  the  snow  away  from
the  two-way  door,  i  stuck  my  head  in.  it
was  as  warm  as  an  oven.  i  got  my  face
washed all over by little ann. old danâ€™s
tail thumped out a tune on the wall.

i  told  them  to  be  ready  because  we
were  going  hunting  that  night.  i  knew  the
old ringtails would be hungry and stirring
for  they  had  been  denned  up  during  the

rolled  around  under

just  before  i  reached  the  timber,  old
dan  shook  the  snow  from  the  underbrush
with  his  deep  voice.  i  stopped  and
listened. he bawled again. the deep bass
tones
tall
sycamores, tore their way out of the thick
timber,  traveled  out  over  the  fields,  and
slammed  up  against  the  foothills.  there
they seemed to break up and die away in
the mountains.

old  dan  was  working  the  trail  slowly
and i knew why. he would never line out
until little ann was running by his side. i
thought  she  would  never  get  there.  when
she  did,  her  beautiful  voice  made  the
blood  pound  in  my  temples.  i  felt  the
excitement of the hunt as it ate its way into
my  body.  taking  a  deep  breath,  i  reared

the  coon  ran  upriver  for  a  way  and
then, cutting out of the bottoms, he headed
for  the  mountains.  i  stood  and  listened
until  their  voices  went  out  of  hearing.
slipping  and  sliding,  i  started  in  the
direction  i  had

t to my right and ran
between  our  house  and  me.  i  heard
screaming and yelling from my sisters. my
father started whooping.

i knew my whole family was out on the
porch  listening  to  the  beautiful  voices  of
my  little  red  hounds.  i  felt  as  tall  as  the
tallest sycamore on the riverbank. i yelled
as  loud  as  i  could.  again  i  heard  the
squealing  of  my  sisters  and  the  shouts  of
my father.

the deep â€œou-ou-ouâ€™sâ€ of old dan and
the sharp â€œaw-aw-aw-awâ€™sâ€ of little ann
bored  a  hole  in  the  inky-black  night.  the
vibrations  rolled  and  quivered  in  the  icy
silence.

the  coon  was  heading  for  the  river.  i
could  tell  my  dogs  were  crowding  him,
and wondered if heâ€™d make it to the water.
i  was  hoping  he  wouldnâ€™t,  for  i  didnâ€™t
want to wade the cold water unless i had
to do it.

i

i  figured  the  smart  old  coon  had  a
reason for turning and coming back to the
river  and  wondered  what  trick  he  had  in
mind.
something  my
gr

 cry i
had ever heard. turning around, he trotted
back out on the ice and disappeared in the
fog.

i  knew  something  had  happened  to
little  ann.  i  called  her  name.  she
answered with a pleading cry. although i
couldnâ€™t  see  her,  i  guessed  what  had
happened.  the  coon  had  led  them  to  the
river.  running  out  on  the  ice,  he  had
leaped across the trough. my dogs, hot on
the  trail,  had  followed.  old  dan,  a  more
powerful  dog  than  little  ann,  had  made
his leap. little ann had not made it. her
small  feet  had  probably  slipped  on  the
slick  ice  and  she  had  fallen  into  the  icy

waters.  old  dan,  seeing  the  fate  of  his
little friend, had quit the chase and come
back to help her. the smart old coon had
pulled his trick, and a deadly one it was.

i had to do something. she would never
be able to get out by herself. it was only a
matter  of  time  until  her  body  would  be
paralyzed by the freezing water.

laying  my  ax  down,  i  held  my  lanter

out in front of me and stepped out on the
ice.  it  started  cracking  and  popping.  i
jumped back to the bank. although it was
thick enough to hold the light weight of my
dogs, it would never hold me.

little ann started whining and begging
for  help.  i  went  all  to  pieces  and  started
crying.  something  had  to  be  done  and
done  quickly  or  my  little  dog  was  lost.  i
thought of running home for a rope or for

my  father,  but  i  knew  she  couldnâ€™t  last
until  i  got  back.  i  was  desperate.  it  was
impossible for me to swim in the freezing
water.  i  wouldnâ€™t  last  for  a  minute.  she
cried  again,  begging  for  the  one  thing  i
couldnâ€™t give her, help.

i thought, â€œif

i  saw  old  dan  first.  he  was  sitting
close  to  the  edge  of  the  trough,  looking
down.  then  i  saw  her.  i  groaned  at  her
plight. all  i  could  see  was  her  head  and
her  small  front  paws.  her  claws  were
spread  out  and  digging  into  the  ice.  she
knew  if  she  ever  lost  that  hold  she  was
gone.

old  dan  raised  his  head  and  howled.
hound though he was, he knew it was the
end of the trail for his little pal.

i  wanted  to  get  my  light  as  close  to
little ann as i could, but my pole was a
good  eight  feet  short.  setting  the  lantern
down,  i  eased  the  pole  from  under  the
handle, i thought, â€œiâ€™m no better off than i
was before. in fact iâ€™m worse off. now i

slip on the ice. her body settled lower in
the  water.  old  dan  howled  and  started
fidgeting. he knew the end was close.

toward my dog. i had taken only two steps

only he would help me.

still  saying  my  prayer  and  making
promises, i heard a sharp metallic sound. i
jumped  up  and  stepped  away  from  the
tree.  i  was  sure  the  noise  i  heard  was
made by a rattling chain on the front end of

were the cries of little ann.

again i hollered. â€œover here. over on
the  bank.  can  you  see  my  light?  i  need
help. please hurry.â€

i  held  my  breath  waiting  for  an
answering  shout.  i  shivered  from  the
freezing  cold  of  my  wet  shoes  and
overalls. a  straining  silence  settled  over
the river. a feathery rustle swished by in
the blackness. a flock of low-flying ducks
had  been  disturbed  by  my  loud  shouts.  i
strained my ears for some sound. now and
then  i  could  hear  the  lapping  slap  of

end.  with  one  of  my  shoelaces  i  tied  the
wire to the end of the cane pole. i left the
hook sticking out about six inches beyond
the end of it.

i  started  shouting  encouragement  to
little ann. i told her to hang on and not to
give  up  for  i  was  going  to  save  her.  she
answered with a low cry.

with  the  hook  stuck  in  one  of  the
ventilating  holes  in  the  top  of  my  light,  i
lifted  it  back  out  on  the  ice  and  set  it
down. after a little wiggling and pushing,
i worked the hook loose and laid the pole
down.

i took off my clothes, picked up my ax,
and stepped down into the hole in the icy
water. it came to my knees. step by step,
breaking the ice with my ax,

the water came up to my hips, and then
to  my  waist.  the  cold  bite  of  it  took  my
breath away. i felt my body grow numb. i
couldnâ€™t feel my feet at all but i knew they
were moving. when the water reached my
armpits  i  stopped  and  worked  my  pole
toward little ann. stretching my arms as
far out as i could, i saw i was still a foot
short.  closing  my  eyes  and  gritting  my
teeth, i moved on. the water reached my
chin.

i was close enough. i started hooking at
the collar of little ann. time after time i
felt  the  hook  almost  catch.  i  saw  i  was
fishing on a wrong angle. she had settled

as gently as i could i dragged her over
the  rim  of  the  ice.  at  first  i  thought  she
was  dead.  she  didnâ€™t  move.  old  dan
started  whining  and  licking  her  face  and
ears. she moved her head. i started talking
to  her.  she  made  an  effort  to  stand  but
couldnâ€™t. her muscles were paralyzed and
the blood had long since ceased to flow.

at the movement of little ann, old dan
threw  a  fit.  he  started  barking  and
jumping. his long red tail fanned the air.

still  holding  onto  my  pole,  i  tried  to
take  a  step  backward.  my  feet  wouldnâ€™t
move. a cold gripping fear came over me.
i  thought  my  legs  were  frozen.  i  made
another  effort  to  lift  my  leg.  it  moved.  i

realized that my feet were stuck in the soft
muddy bottom.

i started backing out, dragging the body
of my little dog. i couldnâ€™t feel the pole in
my  hands.  when  my  f

feeling in my body was gone.

i  wrapped  little  ann  in  my  coat  and
hurried  into  my  clothes.  with  the  pole  i
fished my light back.

close by was a large drift. i climbed up
on top of it and dug a hole down through
the  ice  and  snow  until  i  reached  the  dry
limbs.  i  poured  half  of  the  oil  in  my
lantern down into the hole and dropped in
a match. in no time i had a roaring fire.

i laid little ann close to the warm heat
and  went  to  work.  old  dan  washed  her
head  with  his  warm  red  tongue  while  i

i could tell by her cries when the blood
started  circulating.  little  by  little  her
strength came back. i stood her on her feet
and  started  walking  her.  she  was  weak
and wobbly but i knew she would live. i
felt  much  better  and  breathed  a  sigh  of
relief.

old  dan  opened  up  first.  it  was  a
beautiful thing to hear. the deep tones of
his voice rolled in the silent night.

a  bird  in  a  canebrake  on  our  right
started chirping. a big swamp rabbit came

running  down  the  riverbank  as  if  all  hell
was  close  to  his  heels.  a  bunch  of
mallards,  feeding  in  the  shallows  across
the  river,
took  flight  with  frightened
quacks. a feeling that only a hunter knows
slowly crept over my body. i whooped to
my dogs, urging them on.

little ann came in. her bell-like tones
blended  with  old  danâ€™s,
in  perfect
rhythm.  we  stood  and  listened  to  the
beautiful music, the deep-throated notes of
hunting hounds on the hot-scented trail of a
river coon.

rubin said, â€œif he crosses the river up
at  the  buck  ford,  itâ€™s  the  ghost  coon,  as
thatâ€™s the way he always runs.â€

we stood and listened. sure enough, the
voices  of  my  dogs  were  silent  for  a  few
minutes.  old  dan,  a  more  powerful

swimmer than little ann,

had kicked it.

the  wily  old  coon  crossed  the  river
several times, but couldnâ€™t shake my dogs
from his trail. he cut out from the bottoms,
walked  a  rail  fence,  and  jumped  from  it

into  a  thick  canebrake.  he  piled  into  an
old  slough.  where  it  emptied  into  the
river,  he  swam  to  the  middle.  doing
opposite to what most coons do, which is
swim downstream, he swam upstream. he
stopped at an old drift in the middle of it.
little ann found him. when she jumped
him  from  the  drift,  old  dan  was  far
downriver  searching  for  the  trail.  if  he
could  have  gotten  there  in  time,  it  would
have  been  the  last  of  the  ghost  coon,  but
little ann couldnâ€™t do much by herself in
the  water.  he  fought  his  way  free  from
her, swam to our side, and ran upstream.

i  could  hear  old  dan  coming  through
the  bottoms  on  the  other  side,  bawling  at
every jump. i could feel the driving power
in his voice. we

little  ann  was  warming  up  the  ghost
coon.  i  could  tell  by  her  voice  that  she
was close to him.

reaching  our  side,  old  dan  tore  out
after her. he was a mad hound. his deep
voice was telling her he was coming.

we  were  trotting  along,  following  my
dogs,  when  i  heard  little annâ€™s  bawling
stop.

â€œwait a minute,â€ i said. â€œi think she has

down  into  the  dark  hollow.  i  knew  that

somewhere down below the surface there
had  to  be  another  hole  in  the  trunk,  as
water  had  filled  the  hollow  to  the  river
level.

rubin, looking over my shoulder, said,
â€œthat coon couldnâ€™t be in there. if he was,
heâ€™d be drowned.â€

i agreed.
rainie  spoke  up.  â€œyou  ready  to  pay
off?â€  he  asked.  â€œi  told  you  them  hounds
couldnâ€™t tree the ghost coon.â€

i told him the show wasnâ€™t over.
little ann had never bawled treed, and
i  knew  she  wouldnâ€™t  until  she  knew

bank  up  and  down,  and  not  finding  the

hearing a whine, i turned around. little
ann  had  crawled  up  on  the  log  and  was
inching  her  way  down  the  slick  trunk
toward the water. i held my lantern up so i
could  see  better.  spraddle-legged,  claws

little ann eased herself into the water.

around. in places it was thin and her legs
would  break  through.  climbing,  clawing,

over, looking for the lost trail.

slowly  and  carefully  she  worked  her
way through the tangled mass. i lost sight
of  her  when  she  came  close  to  the
undermined  bank.  she  wormed  her  way
under  the  overhang.  i  could  hear  her
clawing  and  wallowing  around,  and  then
all  hell  broke  loose.  out  from  under  the
bank  came  the  biggest  coon  i  had  ever
seen, the ghost coon.

he came out right over little ann. she
caught him in the old treetop. i knew she

clawing his way free of the limbs and
logs, he was on his way.

on reaching midstream, the ghost coon
headed downriver with little ann still on
his tail.

we ran down the riverbank. i could see
my  dogs  clearly  in  the  moonlight.  the
ghost coon was about fifteen feet ahead of

twenty-five  yards
little  ann.  about
behind them came old dan, trying so hard
to catch up. i whooped to them.

rubin grabbed a pole, saying, â€œhe may

come out on this side.â€

knowing the ghost coon was desperate,
i wondered what he would do. reaching a
gravel  bar  below  the  high  bank,  we  ran
out  on  it  to  the  waterâ€™s  edge.  then

the
ghost  coon  did  something  that  i  never
expected. coming even with us, he turned
from midstream and came straight for us.
i heard rubin yell, â€œhere he comes!â€
he  churned  his  way

the
shallows and ran right between us. rubin
swung  his  pole,  missed  the  coon,  and
almost hit little ann. the coon headed for
the  river  bottoms  with  her  right  on  his
heels.

through

the  bawling  of  little  ann  and  our
screaming  and  hollering  made  so  much
noise,  i  didnâ€™t  hear  old  dan  coming.  he
tore out of the river, plowed into me, and
knocked me down.

we  ran  through  the  bottoms,  following
my  dogs.  i  thought  the  ghost  coon  was
going  back  to  the  sycamore  log  but  he
didnâ€™t. he ran upriver.

while  hurrying  after  them,  i  looked
over at rainie. for 
 
 ___________________________
 
once in his life, i think
he  was  excited.  he  was  whooping  and
screaming,  and  falling  over  logs  and
limbs.

i felt good all over.
glancing  over  at  me,  rainie  said,

â€œthey ainâ€™t got him yet.â€

the  ghost  coon  crossed  the  river  time
after  time.  seeing  that  he  couldnâ€™t  shake

old dan and little ann from his trail, he
cut  through  the  river  bottoms  and  ran  out
into an old field.

at this maneuver, rubin said to rainie,

â€œheâ€™s heading for that tree.â€

â€œwhat tree?â€ i asked.
â€œyouâ€™ll  see,â€  rainie  said.  â€œwhen  he
gets  tired,  he  always  heads  for  that  tree.
thatâ€™s  where  he  gets  his  name,  the  ghost
coon. he just disappears.â€

â€œif  he  disappears,  my  dogs  will

disappear with him,â€ i said.

rainie laughed.
i had to admit one thing. the pritchard

the tree was easy to climb. i looked all
over  it,  on  each  limb,  and  in  every  dark

place.  i  looked  for  a  hollow.  the  ghost
coon wasnâ€™t there. i climbed back down,
scolded old dan to stop his loud bawling,
and looked for little ann.

i  saw  her  far  up  the  old  fence  row,
sniffing and running here and there. i knew
the ghost coon had pulled a real trick, but i
couldnâ€™t figure out what it was. little ann
had never yet barked treed. i knew if the
coon was in the tree she wouldnâ€™t still be
searching for a trail.

old dan started working again.
my  dogs  covered

the  field.  they
circled and circled. they ran up and down
the barbed-wire fence on both sides.

i  knew  the  coon  hadnâ€™t  walked  the

couldnâ€™t do that. i walked over to the old
gate  and  looked  around.  i  sat  down  and

stared up into the tree. little ann came to
me.

old  dan,  giving  up  his  search,  came
back  to  the  tree  and  bawled  a  couple  of
times. i scolded him again.

rubin  came  over.  leering  at  me,  he

said, â€œyou give up?â€

i didnâ€™t answer.
little ann once again started searching
for  the  lost  trail.  old  dan  went  to  help
her.

rainie  said,  â€œi

that  you
couldnâ€™t  tree  the  ghost  coon.  why  donâ€™t
you pay off so we can go home?â€

i  told  him  i  hadnâ€™t  given  up.  my  dogs
were  still  hunting.  when  they  gave  up,  i
would, too.

rubin  said,  â€œwell,  weâ€™re  not  going  to

stay here all night.â€

perhaps  i  had  overlooked  something.  i

back. we may never catch the ghost coon,
but  weâ€™ll  run  him  until  he  leaves  the
country.

she licked my hands and whined.
a small breeze began to stir. glancing
up  into  the  tree,  i  saw  some  leaves
shaking.  i  said  to  rubin,  â€œlooks  like  the
wind  is  coming  up.  it  may  blow  up  a
storm. weâ€™d better be heading for home.â€
just as i turned, i saw little ann throw
up  her  head  and  whine.  her  body  grew
stiff  and  taut.  i  watched  her.  she  was
testing  the  wind.  i  knew  she  had  scented
something in the breeze. stiff-legged, head
high in the air, she started walking toward
the tree. almost there, she turned back and
stopped.  i  knew  she  had  caught  the  scent

but  could  only  catch  it  when  a  breeze
came.

looking at rubin, i said, â€œi havenâ€™t lost

that two dollars yet.â€

slowly  she  walked  straight  to  the  large
gatepost,  reared  up  on  it  with  her  front
feet,  and  bawled  the  most  beautiful  tree
bark i ever heard in my life.

old  dan,  not  understanding  why  little
ann  was  bawling,  stood  and  looked.  he
walked  over  to  the  post,  reared  up  on  it,
and  sniffed.  then,  raising  his  head,  he
shook the dead leaves in the bur oak tree
with his deep voice.

i  looked  at  rainie.  laughing,  i  said,
â€œthereâ€™s

the big hound pushed old dan over.

i  told  rubin  to  let  me  up  so  we  could

stop the fight.

he laughed, â€œwhile my dog is whipping
yours,  i  think  iâ€™ll  just  work  you  over  a
little.â€  so  saying,  he  jerked  my  cap  off,
and started whipping me in the face with
it.

i  heard  rainie  yell,  â€œrubin,  theyâ€™re

killing old blue.â€

rubin jumped up off me.
i clambered up and looked over to the
fight.  what  i  saw  thrilled  me.  faithful
little ann, bitch though she was, had gone
to the assistance of old dan.

i knew my dogs were very close to each
other. everything they did was done as a
combination,  but  i  never  expected  this.  it
is a very rare occasion for a bitch dog to

fight another dog, but fight she did.

i could see that little annâ€™s jaws were
glued  to  the  throat  of  the  big  hound.  she
would never loosen that deadly hold until
the last breath of life was gone.

old dan was tearing and slashing at the
soft belly. i

in front of him. i knew i could never get to

i was screaming, â€œno, rubin, no!â€
i  saw  the  small  stick  when  it  whipped
up from the ground. as if it were alive, it
caught  between  rubinâ€™s  legs.  i  saw  him
fall. i ran on by.

reaching  the  dogfight,  i  saw  the  big
hound was almost gone. he had long since
ceased  fighting.  his  body  lay  stretched
full-length  on  the  ground.  i  grabbed  old
danâ€™s collar and pulled him back. it was
different with little ann. pull as i might,
she wouldnâ€™t let go of the houndâ€™s throat.
her jaws were locked.

i  turned  old  dan  loose  and,  getting
astraddle  of  little ann,  i  pried  her  jaws
apart with my hands. old dan had darted
back  in.  grabbing  his  collar  again,  i
pulled them off to one side.

the  blue  hound  lay  where  he  was.  i
thought perhaps he was already dead, and
then i saw him move a little.

still holding my dogs by their collars, i
looked back. i couldnâ€™t understand what i
saw.

between  their  legs  and  trotting  side  by
side,  they  started  back.  every  little  way
they  would  stop  and  look  back  at  me.  it
was too much. i couldnâ€™t stand it. i began

to feel bad all over.

â€œwell, all right,â€ i said. â€œcome on, you
can  go,  but,  dan,  if  there  are  any  dogs
around the store, and you get in a fight, i
wonâ€™t  take  you  hunting  for  a  whole  year,
and i mean that,â€ although i knew i didnâ€™t.
they  came  running,  tickled  to  death.
little ann took one of her silly spells. she
started nipping at the long red tail of old
dan.  not  getting  any  reaction  from  him,
she jumped over him. she barked at him.
he  wouldnâ€™t  even  look  at  her.  she  ran
around  in  front  of  him  and  laid  down  in
the trail, acting like a cat ready to spring.
stiff-legged,  he  walked  up  close  to  her,
stopped,  and  showed  his  teeth.  i  laughed
out loud. i knew he wouldnâ€™t bite her any
more than he would bite me. he was just

for  a  hundred  miles.  after  several

asked,  â€œdidnâ€™t  i  see  your  dogs  with  you

â€œyes,

store,  walking  like  she  was  scared.  old
dan came to the door and stopped. i tried
to  coax  him  in.  it  was  no  use.  my  dogs,
never  being  allowed  in  the  house,  were
scared to come in.

grandpa  came  back  and  set  little ann
up  on  the  counter.  he  chuckled  as  he
broke  the  cheese  up  in  small  pieces  and
fed her.

grandpa  walked  over  to  a  hoop  of
cheese  and  cut  off  two  chunks  about  the
size  of  my  fist.  he  walked  to  the  door,
talking

well, that shows youâ€™re a good dog.â€

he handed him a piece of the cheese. i
heard it rattle in his throat as he gulped it
down.

grandpa  didnâ€™t  have  to  say  that.  the
way i was feeling, i already had the cup.
all i had to do was go and get it.

finished with his feeding of little ann,
grandpa  said,  â€œnow,  letâ€™s  see.  the  hunt
starts  on  the  twenty-third.  thatâ€™s  aboutâ€”
well,  letâ€™s  seeâ€”this  is  the  seventeenth.â€
counting on his fingers he finally figured
it out. â€œthatâ€™s six days from now,â€ he said
in a jubilant voice.

â€œyes, sir,â€ he said, â€œi think we have the
best  darn  coon  hounds  in  these  ozark
mountains,  and  just  as  sure  as  shootinâ€™,
weâ€™re going to win that gold cup.â€

i nodded my head.

around her and kissed her.

papa spoke up. â€œitâ€™s sure going to be a
big  hunt,â€  he  said.  â€œi  heard  something

about it up at the store one day.â€

â€œgrandpa  said  there  would  be  hunters
there from everywhere,â€ i said, â€œand some
of the best coon hounds in the country.â€

â€œdo you think you have a chance to win

the cup?â€ papa asked.

i  started  to  answer  him  when  the  little
one  piped  up.  â€œthey  canâ€™t  beat  old  dan
and little ann,â€ she said. â€œi just bet they
canâ€™t.â€

everyone

laughed  at  her

serious
remark.  i  would  have  kissed  her  but  she
had  candy,  corn  bread,  and  molasses  all
over her face.

i  told  papa  i  didnâ€™t  know  how  good
those dogs were, but there was one thing i
did  know.  if  they  beat  mine,  they  would
have  to  hunt  harder  than  they  ever  had
before.

after i had had my say about the dogs, a
silence  settled  over  the  dining  room.
everyone was looking at papa and w

the  gray  ones  were  winging  their  way
southward.  i  listened  to  their  talking  and

wondered what they were saying.

looking  to  the  mountains  around  us,  i
saw that the mysterious artist who comes
at  night  had  paid  us  a  visit.  i  wondered
how  he  could  paint  so  many  different
colors in one night; red, wine, yellow, and
rust.

my dogs were trotting along in front of
us. i smiled at the way their hind quarters
shifted to the right. little ann would jump
and bounce and try to get old dan to play,
but the solemn old boy just jogged along,
heedless of everything.

â€œyou  know,â€  papa  said,  â€œshe  doesnâ€™t
even act like a hound. she is bouncing and
playing  all  the  time.  why,  she  acts  more
like a little pup than a hound.â€

â€œyes, i know,â€ i said. â€œiâ€™ve noticed that

i wanted to hug my old grandpaâ€™s neck.
â€œsure,  grandpa,â€  i  said,  â€œtheyâ€™ll  love
that.â€

opening one of the cans, i dumped it out
on a piece of bark in front of old dan. he
sniffed at it and refused to eat. i laughed,
for i knew why. while i was opening the
other can, grandpa came over.

â€œwhatâ€™s  the  matter,â€  he  asked.  â€œwonâ€™t

he eat it?â€

â€œsure, grandpa,â€ i said, â€œheâ€™ll eat, but

not before little ann gets her share.â€

with  the  second  can  opened,  i  fed  her
on  another  piece  of  bark.  both  of  them
started eating at the same time.

with  an  astonished  look  on  his  face,

grandpa exclaimed, â€œwell, iâ€™ll be darned.
i  never  saw  anything  like  that.  why,  i
never saw a hound that wouldnâ€™t eat. did
you train them to do that?â€

he  said,  â€œyou  think  thatâ€™s  strange.  you
should have seen what i saw one day.

â€œone  of  the  girls  threw  two  cold
biscuits out in the back yard to old dan.
he  stood  and  looked  at  them  for  a  bit,
then, picking both of them up in his mouth,
he  trotted  around  the  house.  i  followed
just  to  see  what  he  was  going  to  do.  he
walked  up  in  front  of  the  doghouse,  laid
them down, and growled; not like he was

mad.  it  was  a  strange  kind  of  a  growl.
little ann  came  out  of  the  doghouse  and
each of them ate a biscuit. now, i saw this
with my own eyes. believe me, those dogs
are close to each otherâ€”real close.â€

after papa had stopped talking, silence

settled over the camp.

grandpa stood staring at my dogs. in a
slow  voice,  as  if  he  were  picking  his
words,  he  said,  â€œyou  know,  iâ€™ve  always
felt like there was something strange about

i told her to act like a lady. she wagged
her tail as though she understood. i untied
the rope and stepped back.

i couldnâ€™t speak. i just nodded my head.

after  the  dogs  were  all  lined  up,  the
judging  started.  four
judges  walked
around  and  around  the  table,  looking  at
them  from  all  angles.  when  one  of  them
would  point  at  a  hound,  he  was  taken
down  and  eliminated  from  the  contest.
dog after dog was disqualified. little ann
was still on the table.

my eyes were wide, my throat dry, and
my  heart  thumping.  one  judge  stopped  in
front of little ann. my heart stopped, too.
reaching over, he patted her on the head.
turning  to  me,  he  asked,  â€œis  this  your

dog?â€

he said, â€œsheâ€™s a beautiful hound.â€
he walked on down the line. my heart

started beating again.

there  were  eight  dogs  left.  little ann
was  still  holding  her  own.  then  there
were four. i was ready to cry. two more

a  friendly  hunter  looked  at  me  and
asked, â€œdo you think he could have fooled
your dogs?â€

thinking his question over, i said, â€œyou
know, sometimes when i am hunting, away
back  in  the  mountains  or  down  on  the
river, i sing a little song i made up myself.
one of the verses goes like this:

you  can  swim  the  river,

and  play  your  tricks  out
one by one.
it  wonâ€™t  do  any  good,  old

slapped me on the back.

thatâ€™s all.â€

tired  and  sleepy,  but  with  a  smile  on

my face, i went off to bed.

the next morning two blue tick hounds,
from  the  smoky  mountains  of  tennessee,
came out in the lead with three big coons
to  their  credit.  the  other  four  sets  were

in  the  afternoon  our  judge  came  over  and
introduced  himself.  he  told  us  heâ€™d  be
going with us that night.

about  sundown  we  piled  in  our  buggy
and  drove  a  few  miles  downriver.  i
noticed other hunters doing the same thing.
everyone was trying to get away from the
already-hunted territory.

it  was  dark  by  the  time  grandpa
stopped. i untied the ropes from my dogs.
little ann  reared  up  on  me  and  whined.
old dan walked off a few yards, stretched
his  body,  and  dragged  his  claws  through
the soft bottom soil. opening his mouth, he
let  out  one
then

loud  bawl,  and

disappeared in the thick timber. little ann
was right on his heels.

we took off after them.
grandpa  got  nervous.  he  said  to  me,
â€œdonâ€™t  you  think  you  ought  to  whoop  to
them?â€

i told him to wait a little while. there

would be plenty of time for whooping.

loud snuffing of old dan. once we caught
a  glimpse  of  little  ann  as  she  darted
across  an  opening  that  was  bathed  in
moonlight.  she  was  as  silent  as  a  ghost
and as quick as a flitting shadow.

papa  said,  â€œit  sure  is  a  beautiful  night

for hunting.â€

the  judge  said,  â€œyou  canâ€™t  beat  these
ozark mountain nights for beauty. i donâ€™t
care where you go.â€

grandpa  started  to  say  something.  his
voice  was  drowned  out  by  the  bell-like
cry of little ann.

in  a  whisper,  i  said,  â€œcome  on,  dan.

hurry and help her.â€

as if in answer to my words, his deep
voice  hammered  its  way  up  through  the
river  bottoms.  i  felt  the  blood  tingling  in
my veins. that wonderful feeling that only
a hunter knows crept over my body.

looking over at grandpa, i said, â€œnow

you can whoop.â€

jerking  off  his  hat  and  throwing  back
his  head,  he  let  out  a  yell.  it  wasnâ€™t  a

whoop, or a screech, it was about halfway
in between. ev

in a low voice, the judge said, â€œiâ€™ll say

one thing. they donâ€™t give up easily.â€

birds began to chirp all around us. the
sky  took  on  a  light  gray  color.  tiny  dim
stars were blinking the night away.

â€œit  looks  like  weâ€™re  beat,â€  papa  said.

â€œitâ€™s getting daylight.â€

at that moment, the loud clear voice of
a  redbone  hound,  bawling  treed,  rang
through the river bottoms. it was the voice
of little ann.

sucking in a mouthful of air, i held it. i
could  feel  my  heart  pounding  against  my
ribs. i closed my eyes tight and gritted my
teeth to keep the tears from coming.
â€œletâ€™s go to them,â€ grandpa said.
â€œno, wait a minute,â€ i said.
â€œwhy?â€ he asked.

â€œwait  till  old  dan  gets  there,â€  i  said.
â€œitâ€™s  daylight  now,  and  if  we  walk  up  to
the tree, the coon will jump out. itâ€™s hard
to  keep  a  coon  in  a  tree  after  daylight.

iled  over  it.  we  could  hear  the  tall
stalks  rattling  as  he  plowed  his  way
through  them.  a  bunch  of  sleepy  snow
birds  rose  from  the  thick  cane,  flitted
over, and settled in a row on the old rail
fence.

nearing the tree, we could see it was a
tall  sycamore,  and  there  high  in  the  top
was the coon.

grandpa threw a fit. he hopped around
whooping and hollering. he threw his old

hat down on the ground and jumped up and
down  on  it.  then  he  ran  over  and  kissed
little ann right on the head.

after  we  killed  and  skinned  the  coon,
the  judge  said,  â€œletâ€™s  walk  back  to  that
old  fence.  i  think  i  know  how  the  old
fellow pulled his trick.â€

back  at  the  fence,  the  judge  stood  and
looked around for a few minutes. smiling,
he said, â€œyes, thatâ€™s how he did it.â€

â€œhow?â€ grandpa asked.
still smiling, the judge said, â€œthat old
coon walked this rail fence. coming even
with  the  hackberry  tree,  he  leaped  up  on
its side, and cli

the  timber  is  around  here.  see  that  limb
way up there in the top, the one that runs
over and almost touches the sycamore?â€

we saw what he meant.

â€œthe coon walked out on that limb,â€ he
said,  â€œleaped  over,  and  caught
the
sycamore  limb.  repeating  this  over  and
over, from tree to tree, he worked his way
far out into the river bottoms. what i canâ€™t
figure out is how that hound found him.â€

gazing at little ann, he shook his head
and  said,  â€œiâ€™ve  been  hunting  coons  and
judging coon hunts for forty years, but iâ€™ve
never seen anything like that.â€

he looked at me. â€œwell, son,â€ he said,
â€œyou have tied the leading teams. thereâ€™s
only one more night of eliminations. even
if some of them get more than three coons,
you  will  still  be  in  the  runoff,  and  from
what  iâ€™ve  seen  here  tonight,  you  have  a
good chance of winning the cup.â€

i  knew  that  little ann  had  scented

over.  we  could  tell  they  were  coming
back so we doused all the fires and, sure
enough,  they  came  right  through  camp.
those two little hounds werenâ€™t fifty yards
behind  the  coon,  running  side  by  side.
boy, they were picking them up and laying
them down, and bawling every time their
feet  touched  the  ground.  iâ€™ll  tell  you,  it
was the prettiest sight i ever saw.â€

when the judge started telling about the
last  coon  little ann  had  treed  i  took  my
dogs over to our tent and fed and watered
them. after they had had their fill, i gave
them  a  good  rubdown  with  a  piece  of
gunny sack. taking them out to the buggy, i
tied  them  up.  i  stood  and  watched  while
they twisted around in the hay making their
bed.

that day i tried to get some sleep in our
tent, but the soaking grandpa had taken in
the  river  had  given  him  a  cold,  causing
him to snore. i never heard such a racket
in  all  my  life.  iâ€™d  ha

little ann had wiggled up as close to old
dan as she could. prying them apart, i lay
down between them and fell asleep.

the last night of the eliminations turned
out  like  the  second  night.  none  of  the
judges turned in more than two hides.

that day, about noon, the owners of the
other winning teams and i were called for
a conference with the head judge. he said,
â€œgentlemen,  the  eliminations  are  over.
only  three  sets  of  hounds  are  left  for  the
runoff.  the  winner  of  tonightâ€™s  hu

grandpa  was  scared  and  excited.  he
was jumping up and down, whooping and
hollering.

papa raised the gun to aim.
i  jumped  and  grabbed  his  arm.  â€œdonâ€™t
do that,â€ i yelled. â€œyouâ€™re sure to hit one
of my dogs.â€

round and round in the deep water the
fight  went  on.  the  coon  climbed  on  old
danâ€™s head and sank his teeth in one of his
long  tender  ears.  old  dan  bawled  with
pain. little ann swam in and caught one of

the  coonâ€™s  hind  legs  in  her  mouth.  she
tried  hard  to  pull  him  off.  all  three
disappeared under the water.

the  judge  said,  â€œwell,  have  you  ever

the water churned and boiled. all three
came to the top about the same time. the
coon  was  between  the  bank  we  were
standing  on  and  my  dogs.  he  swam
toward  us.  they  caught  him  again  just  as
he reached shore. he fought his way free
and  ran  for  a  large  sycamore.

thirty  minutes

later,  papa

said,

â€œlisten.â€

weâ€™re going to get some wind.â€

we  heard  a  rattling  in  the  leaves  and
underbrush. it was beginning to sleet. the
air turned cold and chilly.

we  stood  still.  a  low  moaning  sound
could  be  heard  in  the  tops  of  the  tall
sycamores.

grandpa  said,  â€œi  was  afraid  of  that.

from far downriver, we heard the deep
baying  of  a  hound  on  a  trail.  it  was  old
dan. seconds later, the rhythmic crying of
little ann could be heard. swallowing the
lump  that  had  jumped  up  in  my  throat,  i
whooped as loud as i could.

the  ground  was  turning  white  with
sleet.  the  storm  had  really  set  in.  we
hurried along.

i said to papa, â€œif this keeps up that old
coon  wonâ€™t  run  long.  heâ€™ll  head  for  his

â€œif it gets much worse,â€ grandpa said,
â€œi know some coon hunters that wonâ€™t be

stiff to run.â€

the judge asked if there was any dange

still  no  one  spoke  or  made  a  move  to

stepping over to my father, i buried my
face in his old mackinaw coat. sobbing, i
pleaded with him not to turn back.

he patted my head. â€œbilly,â€ he said, â€œa
man  could  freeze  to  death  in  this  storm,
and  besides,  your  dogs  will  give  up  and
come in.â€

â€œthatâ€™s what has me worried,â€ i cried.
â€œthey  wonâ€™t  come  in.  they  wonâ€™t,  papa.
little ann  might,  but  not  old  dan.  heâ€™d
die before heâ€™d leave a coon in a tree.â€

papa  was  undecided.  making  up  his
mind,  he  stepped  away  from  the  tree  and
said to the others, â€œiâ€™m going on with him.
you fellows coming, or going back?â€

he  turned  and  followed  me.  grandpa

and the judge fell in behind him.

by  this  time  the  ground  was  covered
with  a  thin  white  layer  of  sleet.  we  kept

slipping and falling. i could hear grandpa
mumbling  and  grumbling.  the

standing up, i peered this way and that.
all  i  could  see  was  a  white  wall  of
whirling sleet. i closed my eyes and said a
silent prayer and hoped for a miracle.

we  heard  a  sharp  crack  and  a  loud
crashing noise. a large limb, torn from a
tree by the strong wind, fell to the ground.
the  sharp  crack  of  the  limb  gave  me  the
idea. shouting to my father, i said, â€œshoot
the  gun.  if  my  dogs  are  close  enough  to
hear it, maybe little ann will come to us.â€
papa  didnâ€™t  hesitate.  pointing  the  gun
high  over  his  head,  he  pulled  the  trigger.
the sharp crack rang out into the teeth of
the storm.

we waited.
just  when  i  had  given  up  all  hope  and
had  sunk  to  the  lowest  depth  of  despair,
out of the white wall of driving sleet, my
little  dog  came  to  me.  i  knelt  down  and
gathered her in my arms.

taking  one  of  the  lead  ropes  from  my
pocket, i tied it to her collar. i said, â€œfind

him, little

ver going to let up.â€

i  could  hear  the  roar  of  the  blizzard
back  in  the  thick  timber  of  the  bottoms.
two large limbs being rubbed together by
the strong wind made a grinding creaking
sound.  the  tall  slender  cane  around  us
rattled and swayed.

i  could  feel  the  silence  closing  in.  i
knew  the  judgeâ€™s  cold  logic  had  had  its
effect  on  my  father  and  grandfather.  the
men had given up. there was no hope left
for me.

kneeling  down,  i  put  my  arms  around
little ann.  i  felt  the  warm  heat  from  her
moist tongue caressing my ear. closing my
eyes, i said, â€œplease, dan, bawl one more
time, just one more time.â€

i waited for my plea to be answered.

with  its  loud  roaring,  the  north  wind
seemed  to  be  laughing  at  us. all  around,
tall  stalks  of  cane  were  weaving  and
dancing  to  the  rattling  rhythm  of  their
knife-edged blades.

my father tried to talk above the wind,
but his words were lost in the storm. just
before another blast,

clear as a foghorn on
a  stormy  sea,  old  danâ€™s  voice  rang  loud
and  clear.  it  seemed  louder  than  the  roar
of the wind or the skeleton-like rustling of
the tall swaying cane.

i  jumped  to  my  feet.  my  heart  did  a
complete  flip-flop.  the  knot  in  my  throat
felt as big as an apple. i tried to whoop,
but it was no use. little ann bawled and
tugged on the rope.

there  was  no  mistaking  the  direction.
we knew that little ann had been right all

along. straight as an arrow, she had led us
to him.

old  dan  was  treed  down  in  a  deep
gully.  i  slid  off  the  bank  and  ran  to  him.
his  back  was  covered  with  a  layer  of
frozen  sleet.  his  frost-covered  whiskers
stood out straight as porcupine quills.

i  worked  the  wedges  of  ice  from
between  his  toes,  and  scraped  the  sleet
from  his  body  with  my  hands.  little ann
came over and tried to wash his face. he
didnâ€™t  like  it.  jerking  lo

that.â€

i  tried  to  tear  away  from  him  but  his

grip on my arm was firm.

i  couldnâ€™t  hold  back  the  tears.  my
grandfather was lost and wandering in that
white jungle of cane. screaming for him, i
started back.

papa caught me. he shouted, â€œdonâ€™t do

â€œshoot the gun,â€ the judge said.
papa  shot  time  after  time.  it  was

useless. we got no answer.

little ann came up out of the washout.
she  stood  and  stared  at  me.  turning,  she
disappeared  quickly  in  the  thick  cane.
minutes later we heard her. it was a long,
mournful cry.

the  only  times  i  had  ever  heard  my
little  dog  bawl  like  that  were  when  she
was  baying  at  a  bright  ozark  moon,  or

when someone played a french harp or a
fiddle  close  to  her  ear.  she  didnâ€™t  stop
until we reached her.

grandpa  lay  as  he  had  fallen,  face
down  in  the  icy  sleet.  his

at the crack of the gun, the coon ran far
out on a big limb and stopped. again the
hunter sprinkled him with bird shot. this
time  he  jumped.  hitting  the  ground,  he
crouched down.

old  dan  made  a  lunge.  just  as  he
reached  him,  the  coon  sprang  straight  up
and  came  down  on  his  head.  holding  on
with his claws, the coon sank his teeth in a
long tender ear. old dan was furious. he
started  turning  in  a  circle,  bawling  with
pain.

little ann was trying hard to get ahold
of  the  coon  but  she  couldnâ€™t.  because  of
his  fast  circling,  old  danâ€™s  feet  flew  out
from  under  him  and  he  fell.  this  gave
little ann a chance. darting in, her jaws
closed  on  the  back  of  the  coonâ€™s  neck.  i
knew the fight was over.

arriving back at camp, i saw that all the
tents  had  been  taken  down  but  ours.  a
hunter  said,  â€œeveryone  was  in  a  hurry  to
get out before another blizzard sets in.â€

papa  told  me  to  t

o  me,  saying,  â€œson,  this
makes me very proud. itâ€™s a great honor to
present you with this championship cup.â€
the  crowd  exploded.  the  huntersâ€™

shouts were deafening.

i donâ€™t know from where the two silly
old  tears  came.  they  just  squeezed  their
way  out.  i  felt  them  as  they  rolled  down
my  cheeks.  one  dropped  on  the  smooth

surface of the cup and splattered. i wiped
it away with my sleeve.

turning  to  my  dogs,  i  knelt  down  and
showed the cup to them. little ann licked
it.  old  dan  sniffed  one  time,  and  then
turned his head away.

the judge said, â€œson, thereâ€™s a place on
the cup to engrave the names of your dogs.
i can take it into oklahoma city and have
it done, or you can have it done yourself.
the  engraving  charge  has  already  been
paid by the association.â€

looking  at  the  cup,  it  seemed  that  far
down in the gleaming shadows i could see
two  wide  blue  eyes  glued
to  a
windowpane.  i  knew  that  my  little  sister

as  mama  took  the  beautiful  cup,  she
looked at me. she started to say something
but  was  interrupted  by  the  cries  from  the
other girls.

â€œwe have one, too, mama,â€ they cried,

â€œand itâ€™s just as pretty as that one.â€

â€œitâ€™s not either,â€ the little one piped in a
defiant  voice.  â€œitâ€™s  not  even  as  big  as
mine.â€

â€œtwo  cups!â€  mama  exclaimed.  â€œdid

you win two?â€

â€œyes,  mama,â€  i  said.  â€œlittle ann  won

the  awed  expression  on  my  motherâ€™s
face was wonderful to see. holding a cup
in each hand, she held them out in front of
her.

â€œtwo,â€  she  said.  â€œa  gold  one  and  a

grandpa would be home in a few days.â€

i  was  happy  to  hear  this  news,  and
could  tell  by  the  pleased  look  on  my
fatherâ€™s face, he was glad to hear it, too.

on entering the house, papa said, â€œoh, i
almost  forgot.â€  he  handed  the  box  of
money to mama.

â€œwhatâ€™s this?â€ she asked.
â€œoh, itâ€™s just a little gift from old dan

and little ann,â€ papa said.

mama opened the box. i saw the color
drain  from  her  face.  her  hands  started

trembling.  turning  her  back  to  us,  she
walked  over  and  set  it  on  the  mantel. a
peaceful  silence  settled  over  the  room.  i
could  hear  the  clock  ticking  away.  the
fire in the fireplace crackled and popped.
turning from the mantel, mama looked

big cats, for their fur wasnâ€™t any good, and
all i could expect was two cut-up hounds.
they could kill the largest bobcat in the
hills, and had on several occasions, but to
me it was useless. the only good i could
see  in  killing  one  was  getting  rid  of  a
vicious predatory animal.

the fourth time they treed, they were on
top of a mountain. after the long chase, i
figured the animal was winded and would
stay in the tree. in a trot i started to them.

as i neared the tree, little ann came to
me,  reared  up,  and  whined.  by  her

actions,  i  knew  something  was  wrong.  i
stopped. in the moonlight, i could see old
dan sitting on his haunches, staring up at
the tree and bawling.

the tree had lots of dead leaves on it. i
knew it was a large white oak because it
is one of the last trees in the mountains to
lose its leaves.

old  dan  kept  bawling.  then  he  did
something he had never done before. for
seconds  his  deep  voice  was  still,  and
silence  settled  over  t

growl  from  the  lion.  i  saw  him  crouch.  i
knew what was coming. my hands felt hot
and  sweaty  on  the  smooth  ash  handle  of
the  ax.  with  a  blood-curdling  scream  he
sprang from the tree with claws outspread
and long, yellow fangs bared.

old dan didnâ€™t wait. rearing up on his
hind  legs,  he  met  the  lion  in  the  air.  the
heavy weight bowled him over and over.
he wound up in a fallen treetop.

the impact of the two bodies threw the
lion off balance. little ann darted in. her
aim was true. i heard the snap of her steel-
trap jaws as they closed on his throat.

with a squall of pain and rage, the big
cat rolled over on his side, dragging little

ann with him. his right paw reached out
and  curved  over  her  shoulder.  sinews
tightened  and  razor-sharp  claws  dug
inward. with a cry of pain, she loosened
her  hold.  i  saw  the  blood  squirting  from
the  deep  wound  in  her  shoulder.  she
ignored it and bored back into the fight.

he  loosened  his  hold  on  the  throat  of
old dan. with a scream of pain, he reared
up on his hind legs and started pawing the
air. little ann dangled from his neck, still
holding  on.  her  eyes  were  shut  tight  and
her small feet were digging and clawing at
the body.

old dan, spewing blood from a dozen

wounds, leaped high in the air. his long,
red body sailed in between the outspread
paws  of  the  lion.  i  heard  the  snap  of  his
powerful  jaws  as  they  closed  on  the
throat.

my  numb  brain  started  working.  i
thought  of  another  time  the  ax  had  been
covered  with  blood.  i  donâ€™t  know  why  i
thought of rubin pritchard at that time, or
why  i  thought  of  these  words  i  had  often
heard: â€œthere is a little good in all evil.â€
i  got  to  my  feet  and  went  over  to  my
dogs. i knew i had to inspect them to see
how  badly  they  were  hurt.  it  wasnâ€™t  too
hard to get little ann to loosen her hold. i

examined her body. she was cut in several
places,  but  nothing  fatal.  the  only  bad
wound she had was in her shoulder. it was

i hadnâ€™t gone far when i heard a cry. at
first  i  thought  it  was  a  bird,  or  a  night
hawk. i stood still and listened. i glanced
at little ann. she was looking behind me.
i  turned  around  and  looked  for  old  dan.
he was nowhere in sight.

the  cry  came  again,  low  and  pitiful.
instantly  little ann  started  back  the  way
we had come. i followed as fast as i could
run.

i  found  old  dan  lying  on  his  side,
pleading for help. what i saw was almost
more than i could stand. there, tangled in
the  low  branches  of  a  huckleberry  bush,
were  the  entrails  of  my  dog.  with  a
gasping cry i knelt down by his side.

i kne

and  father.  together  we  doctored  my
dogs.  old  dan  was  taken  care  of  first.
very gently mama worked the entrails out
and  in  a  pan  of  warm  soapy  water,
washed  them  clean  of  the  pine  needles,
leaves, and grit.

â€œif  i  only  knew  what  i  was  doing,â€
mama  said,  as  she  worked,  â€œiâ€™d  feel
better.â€

with  gentle  hands,  she  worked  the
entrails  back  through  the  opening.  the
wound was sewn up and bandaged with a
clean white cloth.

little ann wasnâ€™t hard to doctor. i held
her head while mama cleaned her wounds

with  peroxide.  feeling  the  bite  of  the
strong liquid, she whined and licked at my
hands.

â€œitâ€™s all right, little girl,â€ i said. â€œyouâ€™ll

be well in no time.â€

i  opened  the  door  and  watched  her  as

she limped off to the doghouse.

hearing  a  whimper,  i  turned  around.
there  in  the  doorway  to  the  room  stood
my  sisters.  i  could  tell  by  the  looks  on
their faces that they had been wat

they all started crying.
â€œnow  here,â€  mama  said,  going  over,
â€œyou  girls  get  back  in  bed. youâ€™ll  take  a
death  of  cold  being  up  like  this  in  your
bare feet.â€

â€œmommie,â€  the  little  one  said.  â€œgod

wonâ€™t let old dan die, will he?â€

â€œi  donâ€™t  think  so,  honey,â€  mama  said.

â€œnow off to bed.â€

their room.

they turned and walked slowly back to

â€œit  was,  papa,â€  i  said.  â€œi  never  saw
anything like it. little ann wouldnâ€™t have
fought  the  lion  if  it  hadnâ€™t  been  for  old
dan. all she was doing was helping him.
he  wouldnâ€™t  quit.  he  just  stayed  right  in
there  till  the  end.  i  even  had  to  pry  his
jaws loose from the lionâ€™s throat after the
lion was dead.â€

glancing at old dan, papa said, â€œitâ€™s in
his  blood,  billy.  heâ€™s  a  hunting  hound,
and the best one i ever saw. he only has
two lovesâ€”you and hunting. thatâ€™s all he
knows.â€

i told them how the lion had leape

it wasnâ€™t enough.â€

at that moment. i knew she was all right.

i  had  never  seen  my  father  and  mother
look so tired and weary as they did on that
night. i knew they wanted to comfort me,
but didnâ€™t know what to say.

papa tried. â€œbilly,â€ he said, â€œi wouldnâ€™t
think  too  much  about  this  if  i  were  you.
itâ€™s not good to hurt like that. i believe iâ€™d
just try to forget it. besides, you still have
little ann.â€

i wasnâ€™t even thinking about little ann

â€œiâ€™m  thankful  that  i  still  have  her,â€  i
said, â€œbut how can i forget old dan? he
gave his life for me, thatâ€™s what he didâ€”
just laid down his life for me. how can i
ever forget something like that?â€

mama  said,  â€œitâ€™s  been  a  terrible  night
for all of us. letâ€™s go to bed and try to get
some  rest.  maybe  weâ€™ll  all  feel  better
tomorrow.â€

â€œno, mama,â€ i said. â€œyou and papa go
on to bed. i think iâ€™ll sta

w  how  long  i  had  been
sitting  there  when  i  heard  a  noise  out  on
the  porch.  i  got  up,  walked  over  to  the
door,  and  listened.  it  came  again,  a  low
whimper and a scratchy sound.

i could think of only one thing that could
have made the noise. it had to be my dog.
he wasnâ€™t dead. he had come back to life.
with a pounding heart, i opened the door
and stepped out on the porch.

what  i  saw  was  more  than  i  could
stand.  the  noise  i  had  heard  had  been
made  by  little ann. all  her  life  she  had
slept by old danâ€™s side. and although he
was dead, she had left the doghouse, had
come  back  to  the  porch,  and  snuggled  up

close to his side.

she looked up at me and whimpered. i
couldnâ€™t  stand  it.  i  didnâ€™t  know  i  was
running until i tripped and fell. i got to my
feet and ran on and on, down through our
fields  of  shocked  corn,  until  i  fell  face
down  on  the  riverâ€™s  bank.  there  in  the
gray shadows of a breaking dawn, i cried
until i

in  my  heart  i  knew  that  there  in  the

grave lay a manâ€™s best friend.

two  days  later,  when  i  came  in  from
the  bottoms  where  my  father  and  i  were
clearing land, my mother said, â€œbilly, you
had better look after your dog. she wonâ€™t
eat.â€

i  started  looking  for  her.  i  went  to  the
barn,  the  corncrib,  and  looked  under  the
porch. i called her name. it was no use.

i  rounded  up  my  sisters  and  asked  if
they had seen little ann. the youngest one
said  she  had  seen  her  go  down  into  the
garden. i went there, calling her name. she
wouldnâ€™t answer my call.

i was about to give up, and then i saw
her.  she  had  wiggled  her  way  far  back
under  the  thorny  limbs  of  a  blackberry

bush in the corner of the garden. i talked to
her and tried to coax her out. she wouldnâ€™t
budge.  i  got  down  on  my  knees  and
crawled back to her. as i did, she raised
her head and looked at me.

her  eyes  told  the  story.

hy  must  i  hurt  so?  what
have i done wrong?â€

i  heard  a  noise  behind  me.  it  was  my
mother.  she  sat  down  and  put  her  arm
around me.

â€œyouâ€™ve  done  no  wrong,  billy,â€  she
said.  â€œi  know  this  seems  terrible  and  i
know  how  it  hurts,  but  at  one  time  or
another, everyone suffers. even the good

lord  suffered  while  he  was  here  on
earth.â€

â€œi  know,  mama,â€  i  said,  â€œbut  i  canâ€™t
understand.  it  was  bad  enough  when  old
dan died. now little ann is gone. both of
them gone, just like that.â€

â€œbilly,  you  havenâ€™t  lost  your  dogs
altogether,â€  mama  said.  â€œyouâ€™ll  always
have their memory. besides, you can have
some more dogs.â€

i  rebelled  at  this.  â€œi  donâ€™t  want  any
more  dogs,â€  i  said.  â€œi  wonâ€™t  ever  want
another  dog.  they  wouldnâ€™t  be  like  old
dan and little ann.â€

â€œwe all feel that way, billy,â€ she said.
â€œi  do  especially.  theyâ€™ve  fulfilled  a
prayer  that  i  thought  would

me  now,â€  mama  said.  â€œi  have
supper ready and your father wants to talk
to you. i think when youâ€™ve heard what he
has to say, youâ€™ll feel better.â€

â€œi  canâ€™t  leave  little  ann  like  this,
mama,â€  i  said.  â€œitâ€™ll  be  cold  tonight.  i
think iâ€™ll carry her back to the house.â€

â€œno, i donâ€™t think you should do that,â€
mama said. â€œyour sisters would go all to
pieces. letâ€™s make her comfortable here.â€
raking  some  dead  leaves  into  a  pile,
she  picked  little ann  up  and  laid  her  in
them. taking off my coat, i spread it over
her body. i dreaded to think of what i had

to do on the morrow.

my father and sisters were waiting for
us on the porch. mama told them the sad
story. my sisters broke down and started
crying. they ran to mama and buried their
faces in her long cotton dress.

papa  came  over  and  laid  his  hand  on
my  shoulder.  â€œbilly,â€  he  said,  â€œthere  are
times in a boyâ€™s life when he has to stand
up like a man. this is one o

after  stacking  them  in  a  neat  pile,  he
raised his head and looked straight at me.
â€œbilly,â€  he  said,  â€œyou  know  how  your
mother  has  prayed  that  some  day  weâ€™d
have  enough  money  to  move  out  of  these
hills  and  into  town  so  that  you  children
could get an education.â€

i nodded my head.
â€œwell,â€  he  said,  in  a  low  voice,
â€œbecause  of  your  dogs,  her  prayers  have
been answered. this is the money earned
by old dan and little ann. iâ€™ve managed
to make the farm feed us and clothe us and
iâ€™ve saved every cent your furs brought in.
we now have enough.â€

â€œisnâ€™t  it  wonderful,â€  mama  said.  â€œitâ€™s

just like a miracle.â€

â€œi  think  it  is  a  miracle,â€  papa  said.
â€œremember, billy said a prayer when he
asked  for  his  pups  and  then  there  were
your prayers. billy got his pups. through
those  dogs  your  prayers  were  answered.
yes, iâ€™m sure it is a miracle.â€

â€œif he gave them to me, then

for  us.  iâ€™ll  say  a  special  prayer  and  ask
him to help billy.â€

i barely heard what papa had to say.
during the meal, i could tell that no one
was enjoying the food. as soon as it was
over, i went to my room and lay down on
the bed.

mama  came  in.  â€œwhy  donâ€™t  you  go  to
bed,â€  she  said,  â€œand  get  a  good  nightâ€™s

sleep. youâ€™ll feel better tomorrow.â€

â€œno, i wonâ€™t, mama,â€ i said. â€œiâ€™ll have

to bury little ann tomorrow.â€

â€œi  know,â€  she  said,  as  she  turned  my
covers  down.  â€œiâ€™ll  help  if  you  want  me
to.â€

â€œno,  mama,â€  i  said,  â€œi  donâ€™t  want
anyone  to  help.  iâ€™d  rather  do  it  all  by
myself.â€

â€œbilly,  youâ€™re  always  doing  things  by
yourself,â€  mama  said.  â€œthatâ€™s  not  right.
everyone  needs  help  some  time  in  his
life.â€

â€œi  know,  mama,â€  i  said,â€  but,  please,
not  this  time.  ever  since  my  dogs  were
puppies,  weâ€™ve  al

together.

â€œdid you know, mama, that little ann
used to come every night and peek in my
window  just  to  see  if  i  was  all  right?  i
guess  thatâ€™s  why  i  want  to  be  by  myself
when i bury her.â€

â€œnow say your prayers and go to sleep.
iâ€™m sure youâ€™ll feel better in the morning.â€
i didnâ€™t feel like saying any prayers that
night.  i  was  hurting  too  much.  long  after
the rest of the family had gone to bed, i lay
staring  into  the  darkness,  trying  to  think
and not able to.

some time in the night i got up, tiptoe

the  room,  â€œbut

after mama had left the room, i buried
my face in my pillow and cried myself to
sleep.

the next morning i made another box. it
was smaller than the first one. each nail i
drove in the rough pine boards caused the
knot in my throat to get bigger and bigger.
my sisters came to help. they stood it
for a while, then with tears streaming, they
ran for the house.

i  buried  little ann  by  the  side  of  old
dan. i knew that was where she wanted to
be.  i  also  buried  a  part  of  my  life  along

with my dog.

remembering  a  sandstone  ledge  i  had
seen  while  prowling  the  woods,  i  went
there. i picked out a nice stone and carried
it  back
the  graves.  then,  with
painstaking  care,  i  carved  their  names
deep in its red surface.

as i stood looking at the two graves, i
tried hard to understand some of the things
my  father  had  told  me,  but  i  couldnâ€

d  things  i  hadnâ€™t  seen  before.  wild
violets,  rooster  heads,  and  mountain
daisies  had  completely  covered  the  two
little  mounds.  a  summer  breeze  gushed
down from the rugged hills. i felt its warm
caress as it fanned my face. it hummed a
tune  in  the  underbrush  and  rustled  the
leaves  on  the  huge  red  oak.  the  red  fern
wavered  and  danced  to  the  music  of  the
hills.

taking off my cap, i bowed my head. in
a  choking  voice,  i  said,  â€œgood-bye,  old
dan and little ann. iâ€™ll never forget you;
and  this  i  knowâ€”if  god  made  room  in

heaven for all good dogs, i know he made
a special place for you.â€

with a heavy heart, i turned and walked
away.  i  knew  that  as  long  as  i  lived  iâ€™d
never  forget  the  two  little  graves  and  the
sacred red fern.

i saw i had left the door to the barn loft

not far from our home, the road wound
its way up and over a hill. at the top papa
stopped  the  team.  we  all  stood  up  and
looked back. it was a bea
