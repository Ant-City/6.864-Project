the miller's tale.


the prologue.


when that the knight had thus his tale told
in all the rout was neither young nor old,
that he not said it was a noble story,
and worthy to be *drawen to memory*;                          *recorded*
and *namely the gentles* every one.          *especially the gentlefolk*
our host then laugh'd and swore, "so may i gon,*                *prosper
this goes aright; *unbuckled is the mail;*        *the budget is opened*

the miller that fordrunken was all pale,
so that unnethes* upon his horse he sat,                *with difficulty
he would avalen* neither hood nor hat,                          *uncover

for i will speak, or elles go my way!"
our host answer'd; "*tell on a devil way*;             *devil take you!*
thou art a fool; thy wit is overcome."
"now hearken," quoth the miller, "all and some:
but first i make a protestatioun.
that i am drunk, i know it by my soun':
and therefore if that i misspeak or say,
*wite it* the ale of southwark, i you pray:             *blame it on*<2>
for i will tell a legend and a life
both of a carpenter and of his wife,
how that a clerk hath *set the wrighte's cap*."   *fooled the carpenter*
the reeve answer'd and saide, "*stint thy clap*,      *hold your tongue*

this drunken miller spake full soon again,
and saide, "leve brother osewold,

there be full goode wives many one.
why art thou angry with my tale now?

he would his wordes for no man forbear,
but told his churlish* tale in his mannere;               *boorish, rude

and therefore every gentle wight i pray,
for godde's love to deem not that i say
of evil intent, but that i must rehearse

upon the whiche brook there stands a mill:
and this is *very sooth* that i you tell.               *complete truth*
a miller was there dwelling many a day,
as any peacock he was proud and gay:
pipen he could, and fish, and nettes bete*,                     *prepare
and turne cups, and wrestle well, and shete*.                     *shoot

into some worthy blood of ancestry.
for holy church's good may be dispended*                          *spent
on holy church's blood that is descended.
therefore he would his holy blood honour
though that he holy churche should devour.

great soken* hath this miller, out of doubt,    *toll taken for grinding
with wheat and malt, of all the land about;
and namely* there was a great college                        *especially
men call the soler hall at cantebrege,<4>
there was their wheat and eke their malt y-ground.
