proctor: excellency, does it not strike upon you that so many of these women 
have lived so long with such upright reputation, and - 
parris: do you read the gospel, mr. proctor? proctor: i read 
the gospel. 
 
parris: i think not, or you should surely know that cain were an upright man,

proctor: aye, god tells us that. to danforth: but who tells us rebecca nurse 
murdered seven babies by sending out her spirit on them? it is the children only, 
and this one will swear she lied to you.

danforth, surprised: he bids her confess? 
 
parris, sitting: hear me. rebecca have not given me a word this three month since she 
came. now she sits with him, and her sister and martha corey and two or three others, 
and he pleads with them, confess their crimes and save their lives. 
 
danforth: why - this is indeed a providence. and they soften, they soften?
