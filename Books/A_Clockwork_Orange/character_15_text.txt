wonâ€™t be no more of them singing ptitsas in here.â€ then he gave his old dim guff, a clowny big hohohohoho. it seemed like he was too dim to take much offence.

so off we went our several ways, me belching arrrrgh on the cold coke iâ€™d peeted. i had my cut-throat britva handy in case any of billyboyâ€™s droogs should be around near the flat-block waiting, or for that matter any of the other bandas or gruppas or shaikas that from time to time were at war with one. where i lived was with my dadda and mum in the flats of municipal flatblock 18a, between kingsley avenue and wilsonsway. i got to the big main door with no trouble, though i did pass one young malchick sprawling and creeching and moaning in the gutter, all cut about lovely, and saw in the lamplight also streaks of blood here and there like signatures, my brothers, of the nightâ€™s fillying. and too i saw just by 18a a pair of devotchkaâ€™s neezhnies doubtless rudely wrenched off in the heat of the moment, o my brothers. and

aid to me. â€œi met your mother, yes. she said something about a pain somewhere. hence not at schol, yes.â€

â€œa rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir,â€ i said in my gentlemanâ€™s goloss. â€œi think it should clear by this afternoon.â€

â€œor certainly by this evening, yes,â€ said p. r. deltoid. â€œthe evening is the great time, isnâ€™t it, alex boy? sit,â€ he said, â€œsit, sit,â€ as though this was his domy and me his guest. and he sat in this starry rocking-chair of my dadâ€™s and began rocking, as if that was all he had come for. i said:

â€œa cup of the old chai, sir? tea, i mean.â€

â€œno time,â€ he said. and he rocked, giving me the old glint under frowning brows, as if with all the time in the world. â€œno time, yes,â€ he said, gloopy. so i put the kettle on. then i said:

â€œto what do i owe the extreme pleasure? is anything wrong, sir?â€

â€œwrong?â€ he said, very skorry and sly, sort of hunched looking at me but still rocking away. then he ca

 in factory the one, store the other. the poor old. the pitiable starry. i put on my over-gown and looked out, in guise of loving only son, to say:

â€œhi hi hi, there. a lot better after the dayâ€™s rest. ready now for evening work to earn that little bit.â€ for thatâ€™s what they said they believed i did these days. â€œyum, yum, mum. any of that for me?â€ it was like some frozen pie that sheâ€™d unfroze and then warmed up and it looked not so very appetitish, but i had to say what i said. dad looked at me with a not-so-pleased suspicious like look but said nothing, knowing he dared not, and mum gave me a tired like little smeck, to thee fruit of my womb my only son sort of. i danced to the bathroom and had a real skorry cheest all over, feeling dirty and gluey, then back to my den for the eveningâ€™s platties. then, shining, combed, brushed and gorgeous, i sat to my lomtick of pie. papapa said:

â€œnot that i want to pry, son, but where exactly is it you go to work of evenings?â€

â€œoh,â€ i chewed, â€œitâ€™s mostly odd things, helping like. here and there, as it might be.â€ i gave him a straight dirty glazzy, as to say to mind his own and iâ€™d mind mine. â€œi never ask for money, do i? not money for clothes or for pleasures? all right, then, why ask?â€

my dad was like humble mumble chumble. â€œsorry, son,â€ he said. â€œbut i get worried sometimes. sometimes i have dreams. you can laugh if you like, but thereâ€™s a lot in dreams. last night i had this dream with you in it and i didnâ€™t like it one bit.â€

â€œoh?â€ he had gotten me interessovatted now, dreaming of me like that. i had like a feeling i had had a dream, too, but i could not remember proper what. â€œyes?â€ i said, stopping chewing my gluey pie.

â€œit was vivid,â€ said my dad. â

â€œoh?â€ i had an in-grin at that, papapa believing i had really reformed or believing he believed. and then i remembered my own dream, which was a dream of that morning, of georgie giving his generalâ€™s orders and old dim smecking around toothless as he wielded the whip. but dreams go by opposites i was once told. â€œnever worry about thine only son and heir, o my father,â€ i said. â€œfear not. he canst taketh care of himself, verily.â€

â€œand,â€ said my dad, â€œyou were like helpless in your blood and you couldnâ€™t fight back.â€ that was real opposites, so i had another quiet malenky grin within and then i took all the deng out of my carmans and tinkled it on the saucy table-cloth. i said:

â€œhere, dad, itâ€™s not much. itâ€™s what i earned last night. but perhaps for the odd peet of scotchman in the snug somewhere for you and mum.â€

â€œthanks, son,â€ he said. â€œbut we donâ€™t go out much now. we darenâ€™t go out much, the streets being

it did not take long to quieten these two wounded soldiers down in the snug of the duke of new york, what with large brandies (bought with their own cutter, me having given all to my dad, and a wipe with tashtooks dipped in the water-jug. the old ptitsas weâ€™d been so horrorshow to last night were there again, going, â€œthanks, ladsâ€ and â€œgod bless you, boysâ€ like they couldnâ€™t stop, though we had not repeated the old sammy act with them. but pete said: â€œwhatâ€™s it to be, girls?â€ and bought black and suds for them, him seeming to have a fair amount of pretty polly in his carmans, so they were on louder than ever with their â€œgod bless and keep you all, ladsâ€ an

â€œwhatâ€™s it going to be then, eh?â€

i take it up now, and this is the real weepy and like tragic part of the story beginning, my brothers and only friends, in staja (state jail, that is) number 84f. you will have little desire to slooshy all the cally and horrible raskazz of the shock that sent my dad beating his bruised and krovvy rockers against unfair like bog in his heaven, and my mum squaring her rot for owwwww owwwww owwwww in her motherâ€™s grief at her only child and son of her bosom like letting everybody down real horrorshow. then there was the starry very grim magistrate in the lower court govoreeting some very hard slovos against your friend and humble narrator, after all the cally and grahzny slander spat forth by p. r. deltoid and the rozzes, bog blast them. then there was bein

med that he had been doing a bit of boasting, looking forward to a nice crime-free era in which there would be no more fear of cowardly attacks from young hooligans and perverts and burglars and all that cal. so i went arghhhhhh and threw this gazetta on the floor, so that it covered up stains of spilled chai and horrible spat gobs from the cally animals that used thus caff.

â€œwhatâ€™s it going to be then, eh?â€

what it was going to be now, brothers, was homeways and a nice surprise for dadada and mum, their only son and heir back in the family bosom. then i could lay back on the bed in my own malenky den and slooshy some lovely music, and at the same time i could think over what to do now with my jeezny. the discharge officer had given me a long list the day before of jobs i could try for, and he had telephoned to different vecks about me, but i had no intention, my brothers, of going off to rabbit right away. a malenky bit of a rest first, yes, and a quiet think on the bed to th

zzies looking at me, and it was pee and em having their breakfast, but it was also another veck that i had never viddied in my jeezny before, a bolshy thick veck in his shirt and braces, quite at home, brothers, slurping away at the milky chai and munchmunching at his eggiweg and toast. and it was this stranger veck who spoke first, saying:

â€œwho are you, friend? where did you get hold of a key? out, before i push your face in. get out there and knock. explain your business, quick.â€

my dad and mum sat like petrified, and i could viddy they had not yet read the gazetta, then i remembered that the gazetta did not arrive till papapa had gone off to his work. but then mum said: â€œoh, youâ€™ve broken out. youâ€™ve escaped. whatever shall we do? we shall have the police here, oh oh oh. oh, you bad and wicked boy, disgracing us all like this.â€ and, believe it or kiss my sharries, she started to go boo hoo. so i started to try and explain, they could ring up the staja if they wanted,

and all the time this stranger veck sat there like frowning and looking as if he could push my litso in with his hairy bolshy beefy fist. so i said:

â€œhow about you answering a few, brother? what are you doing here and for how long? i didnâ€™t like the tone of what you said just then. watch it. come on, speak up.â€ he was a working-man type veck, very ugly, about thirty or forty, and he sat now with his rot open at me, not govoreeting one single slovo. then my dad said:

â€œthis is all a bit bewildering, son. you should have let us know you were coming. we thought it would be at least another five or six years before they let you out. not,â€ he said, and he said it very like gloomy, â€œthat weâ€™re not very pleased to see you again and a free man, too.â€

â€œwho is this?â€ i said. â€œwhy canâ€™t he speak up? whatâ€™s going on in here?â€

â€œthis is joe,â€ said my mum. â€œhe lives here now. the lodger, thatâ€™s what he is. oh, dear dear dear,â€

veck had put up pictures of boxers, also like a team sitting smug with folded rookers and silver like shield in front. and then i viddied what else was missing. my stereo and my disc-cupboard were no longer there, nor was my locked treasure-chest that contained bottles and drugs and two shining clean syringes.

â€œthereâ€™s been some filthy vonny work going on here,â€ i creeched. â€œwhat have you done with my own personal veshches, you horrible bastard?â€ this was to this joe, but it was my dad that answered, saying:

â€œthat was all took away, son, by the police. this new regulation, see, about compensation for the victims.â€

i found it very hard not to be very ill, but my gulliver was aching shocking and my rot was so dry that i had to take a skorry swig from the milk-bottle on the table, so that this joe said: â€œfilthy piggish manners.â€ i said:

â€œbut she died. that one died.â€

â€œit was the cats, son,â€ said my dad like sorrowful, â€œthat were left with nobody to

, and this joe said: â€œask permission before you sit, you mannerless young swine,â€ so i cracked back skorry with a â€œshut your dirty big fat hole, you,â€ feeling sick. then i tried to be all reasonable and smiling for my healthâ€™s sake like, so i said: â€œwell, thatâ€™s my room, thereâ€™s no denying that. this is my home also. what suggestions have you, my pee and em, to make?â€ but they just looked very glum, my mum shaking a bit, her litso all lines and wet with like tears, and then my dad said:

â€œall this needs thinking about, son. we canâ€™t very well just kick joe out, not just like that, can we? i mean, joeâ€™s here doing a job, a contract it is, two years, and we made like an arrangement, didnâ€™t we, joe? i mean son, thinking you were going to stay in prison a long time and that room going begging.â€ he was a bit ashamed, you could viddy that from his litso. so i just smiled and like nodded, saying:

â€œi viddy all. you got used to a bit of peace and you got used to

a bit of extra pretty polly. thatâ€™s the way it goes. and your son has just been nothing but a terrible nuisance.â€ and then, my brothers, believe me or kiss my sharries, i started to like cry, feeling very like sorry for myself. so my dad said:

â€œwell, you see, son, joeâ€™s paid next monthâ€™s rent already. i mean, whatever we do in the future we canâ€™t say to joe to get out, can we, joe?â€ this joe said:

â€œitâ€™s you two iâ€™ve got to think of, whoâ€™ve been like a father and mother to me. would it be right or fair to go off and leave you to the tender mercies of this young monster who has been like no real son at all? heâ€™s weeping now, but thatâ€™s his craft and artfulness. let him go off and find a room somewhere.

 let him learn the error of his ways and that a bad boy like heâ€™s been doesnâ€™t deserve such a good mum and dad as what heâ€™s had.â€

â€œall right,â€ i said, standing up in all like tears still. â€œi know how things are now. nobody wants or loves me. iâ€™ve suffered and suffered and suffered and everybody wants me to go on suffering. i know.â€

â€œyouâ€™ve made others suffer,â€ said this joe. â€œitâ€™s only right you should suffer proper. iâ€™ve been told everything that youâ€™ve done, sitting here at night round the family table, and pretty shocking it was to listen to. made me real sick a lot

â€œi wish,â€ i said, â€œi was back in the prison. dear old staja as it was. iâ€™m ittying off now,â€ i said. â€œyou wonâ€™t ever viddy me no more. iâ€™ll make my own way, thank you very much. let it lie heavy on your consciences.â€ my dad said:

â€œdonâ€™t take it like that, son,â€ and my mum just went boo hoo hoo, her litso all screwed up real ugly, and this joe put his rooker round her again, patting her and going there there there like bezoomny. and so i just sort of staggered to the door and went out, leaving them to their horrible guilt, o my brothers.

â€œminding his own business he was,â€ said my pee. â€œand the police told him to move on. waiting at a corner he was, son, to see a girl he was going to meet. and they told him to move on and he said he had rights like everybody else, and then they sort of fell on top of him and hit him about cruel.â€

â€œterrible,â€ i said. â€œreally terrible. and where is the poor boy now?â€

â€œowwwww,â€ boohooed my mum. â€œgone back owwwwwwme.â€

â€œyes,â€ said dad. â€œheâ€™s gone back to his own home town to get better. theyâ€™ve had to give his job here to somebody else.â€

â€œso now,â€ i said, â€œyouâ€™re willing for me to move back in again and things be like they were before.â€

â€œyes, son,â€ said my papapa. â€œplease, son.â€
