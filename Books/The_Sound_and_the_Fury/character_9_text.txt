igesting 
any of it, as a moth or a goat might. after the sound and the fury and 
without heeding to open another book and in a series of delayed 
repercussions like summer thunder, i discovered the flauberts and 
dostoievskys and conrads whose books i had read ten years ago. with the 
sound and the fury i learned to read and quit reading, since i have read 
nothing since.  
     nor do i seem to have learned anything since. while writing sanctuary, 
the next novel to the sound and the fury, that part of me which learned as 
i wrote, which perhaps is the very force which drives a writer to the travail 
of invention and the drudgery of putting seventy- five or a hundred 
thousand words on paper, was absent because i was still reading by 
repercussion the books which i had swallowed whole ten years and more 
ago. i learned only from the writing of sanctuary that there was something 
missing; something which the sound and the fury gave me and sanctuary 
did not. when i began as i lay dying i

had discovered what it was and 
knew that it would be also missing in this case because this would be a 
deliberate book. i set out deliberately to write a tour-de-force. before i ever 
put pen to paper and set down the first word, i knew what the last word 
would be and almost where the last period would fall. before i began i said, 
i am going to write a book by which, at a pinch, i can stand or fall if i never 
touch ink again. so when i finished it the cold satisfaction was there, as i 
had expected, but as i had also expected the other quality which the sound 

and the fury had given me was absent that emotion definite and physical 
and yet nebulous to describe: that ecstasy, that eager and joyous faith and 
anticipation of surprise which the yet unmarred sheet beneath my hand

joy which alone ever made 
writing pleasure to me. the book was almost finished before i acquiesced 
to the fact that it would not recur, since i was now aware before each word 
was written down just what the people would do, since now i was 
deliberately choosing among possibilities and probabilities of behavior and 
weighing and measuring each choice by the scale of the jameses and 
conrads and balzacs. i knew that i had read too much, that i had reached 
that stage which all young writers must pass through, in which he believes 
that he has learned too much about his trade. i received a copy of the 
printed book and i found that i didn't even want to see what kind of jacket 
smith had put on it. i seemed to have a vision of it and the other ones 
subsequent to the sound and the fury ranked in order upon a shelf while 
i looked at the titled backs of them with a flagging attention which was 
almost distaste, and upon which each succeeding title registered less and 
less, until at last at

tention itself seemed to say, thank god i shall never 
need to open any one of them again. i believed that i knew then why i had 
not recaptured that first ecstasy, and that i should never again recapture it; 
that whatever treenovels i should write in the future would be written 
without reluctance, but also without anticipation or joy: that in the sound 
and the fury i had already put perhaps the only thing in literature which 
would ever move me very much: caddy climbing the pear tree to look in 

the window at her grandmother's funeral while quentin and jason and 
benjy and the negroes looked up at the muddy seat of her drawers.  
     this is the only one of the seven novels which i wrote without any 
accompanying feeling of drive or effort, or any following feeling of 
exhaustion or relief or distaste. when i began it i had no plan at all. i 
wasn't even writing a book. i

was thinking of books, publication, only in the 
reverse, in saying to myself, i wont have to worry about publishers liking or 
not liking this at all. four years before i had written soldiers' pay. it didn't 
take long to write and it got published quickly and made me about five 
hundred dollars. i said, writing novels is easy. you dont make much doing 
it, but it is easy. i wrote mosquitoes. it wasn't quite so easy to write and it 
didn't get published quite as quickly and it made me about four hundred 
dollars. i said, apparently there is more to writing novels, being a novelist, 
than i thought. i wrote sartoris. it took much longer, and the publisher 
refused it at once. but i continued to shop it about for three years with a 
stubborn and fading hope, perhaps to justify the time which i had spent 
writing it. this hope died slowly, though it didn't hurt at all. one day i 
seemed to shut a door between me and all publishers' address

nothing left with which to speak--a single week, say, of furious endeavor

, since oratory is our heritage. we seem to try in the 
simple furious breathing (or writing) span of the individual to draw a 
savage indictment of the contemporary scene or to escape from it into a 
makebelieve region of swords and magnolias and mockingbirds which 
perhaps never existed anywhere. both of the courses are rooted in 
sentiment; perhaps the ones who write savagely and bitterly of the incest in 
clayfloored cabins are the most sentimental. anyway, each course is a 
matter of violent partisanship, in which the writer unconsciously writes 
into every line and phrase his violent despairs and rages and frustrations 
or his violent prophesies of still more violent hopes. that cold intellect 
which can write with calm and complete detachment and gusto of its 
contemporary scene is not among us; i do not believe there lives the 
southern writer who can say without lying that writing is any fun to him. 
perhaps we do not want it to be.  
     i seem to have tried both of the courses.

was conquered or perhaps hurt. or perhaps he knew that he was the baby

did so, when she quit the water fight and stooped in her wet garments 
above him, the entire story, which is all told by that same little brother in

sense i could then give a final turn to the screw and extract some ultimate 
distillation. yet it took me better than a month to take pen and write the 
day dawned bleak and chill before i did so. there is a story somewhere 
about an old roman who kept at his bedside a tyrrhenian vase which he 
loved and the rim of which he wore slowly away with kissing it. i had made 
myself a vase, but i suppose i knew all the time that i could not live forever 
inside of it, that perhaps to have it so that i too could lie in bed and look at 
it would be better; surely so when that day should come when not only the 
ecstasy of writing would be gone, but the unreluctance and the something 
worth saying too. it's fine to think that you will leave something behind you

minute, so i'd have to turn my back to it, feeling the eyes animals used to 
have in the back of their heads when it was on top, itching. it's always the 
idle habits you acquire which you will regret. father said that. that christ 
was not crucified: he was worn away by a minute clicking of little wheels. 
that had no sister.   
     and so as soon as i knew i couldn't see it, i began to wonder what time it 
was. father said that constant speculation regarding the position of 
mechanical hands on an arbitrary dial which is a symptom of mind-
function. excrement father said like sweating. and i saying all right. 
wonder.

out of his pocket and remove his shoes and put them on while the coffee 
cooled. about noon you'd see him with a shirt and collar on, like anybody 
else. the others passed him running, but he never increased his pace at all. 
after a while the quad was empty.   
     a sparrow slanted across the sunlight, onto the window ledge, and 
cocked his head at me. his eye was round and bright. first he'd watch me 
with one eye, then flick! and it would be the other one, his throat pumping 
faster than any pulse. the hour began to strike. the sparrow quit swapping 
eyes and watched me steadily with the same one until the chimes ceased, 
as if he were listening too. then he flicked off the ledge and was gone.   
     it was a while before the last stroke ceased vibrating. it stayed in the air, 
more felt than heard, for a long time. like all the bells that ever rang still 
ringing in the long dying light-rays and jesus and saint francis talking 
about his sister. because if i

tapped the crystal on the corner of the dresser and caught the fragments of 
glass in my hand and put them into the ashtray and twisted the hands off

painted it again. i put on my new suit and put my watch on and packed the 
other suit and the accessories and my razor and brushes in my hand bag,

addressed it to father, and wrote the two notes and sealed them.

t was on decoration day, 
in a g.a.r. uniform, in the middle of the parade. if you waited long enough 
on any corner you would see him in whatever parade came along. the one 
before was on columbus' or garibaldi's or somebody's birthday. he was in 
the street sweepers' section, in a stovepipe hat, carrying a two inch italian 
flag, smoking a cigar among the brooms and scoops. but the last time was 
the g.a.r. one, because shreve said:   
     "there now. just look at what your grandpa did to that poor old 
nigger."   
     "yes," i said. "now he can spend day after day marching in parades. if it 

hadn't been for my grandfather, he'd have to work like whitefolks."   
     i didn't see him anywhere. but i never knew even a working nigger that 
you could find when you wanted him, let alone one that lived off the fat of 
the land. a car came along. i went over to town and went to parker's and 
had a good breakfast. while i was eating i heard a clock strike the hour.

window. he was going bald. there was a glass in his eye--a metal tube 
screwed into his face. i went in.   
     the place was full of ticking, like crickets in september grass, and i 
could hear a big clock on the wall above his head. he looked up, his eye big 
and blurred and rushing beyond the glass. i took mine out and handed it to 
him.   
     "i broke my watch."   
     he flipped it over in his hand. "i should say you have. you must have 
stepped on it."   
     "yes, sir. i knocked it off the dresser and stepped on it in the dark. it's 
still running though."   
     he pried the back open and squinted into it. "seems to be all right. i 
cant tell until i go over it, though. i'll go into it this afternoon."   
     "i'll bring it back later," i said. "would you mind telling me if any of

     he held my watch on his palm and looked up at me with his blurred 
rushing eye.   
     "i made a

watches in the window, a dozen different hours and each with the same 
assertive and contradictory assurance that mine had, without any hands at 
all. contradicting one another. i could hear mine, ticking away inside my 
pocket, even though nobody could see it, even though it could tell nothing 
if anyone could.   
     and so i told myself to take that one. because father said clocks slay 
time. he said time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; 

only when the clock stops does time come to life. the hands were extended, 
slightly off the horizontal at a faint angle, like a gull tilting into the wind. 
holding all i used to be sorry about like the new moon holding water, 
niggers say. the jeweller was working again, bent over his bench, the tube 
tunnelled into his face. his hair was parted in the center. the part ran up 
into the bald spot, like a drained marsh in december.

take all people, black or white, is to take them for what they think they

white people he lives among. but i thought at first that i ought to miss 
having a lot of them around me because i thought that northerners 
thought i did, but i didn't know that i really had missed roskus and dilsey 
and them until that morning in virginia. the train was stopped when i 
waked and i raised the shade and looked out. the car was blocking a road 
crossing, where two white fences came down a hill and then sprayed 
outward and downward like part of the skeleton of a horn, and there was a 

nigger on a mule in the middle of the stiff ruts, waiting for the train to 
move. how long he had been there i didn't know, but he sat straddle of the 
mule, his head wrapped in a piece of blanket, as if they had been built there 
with the fence and the road, or with th

     the car stopped, started, stopped again. below the window i watched 
the crowns of people's heads passing beneath new straw hats not yet 
unbleached. there were women in the car now, with market baskets, and 
men in work-clothes were beginning to outnumber the shined shoes and 
collars.   
     the nigger touched my knee. "pardon me," he said. i swung my legs out 
and let him pass. we were going beside a blank wall, the sound clattering 
back into the car, at the women with market baskets on their knees and

like she was moving without visible means. a man naked to the waist was 
coiling down a line on the fo'c's'le head. his body was burned the color of 
leaf tobacco. another man in a straw hat withoutany crown was at the 
wheel. the ship went through the bridge, moving under bare poles like a

never raised it, yet on a still night we have heard it from our front porch.

 a shadow hanging like a 
fat arrow stemming into the current. mayflies skimmed in and out of the 
shadow of the bridge just above the surface. if it could just be a hell beyond 
that: the clean flame the two of us more than dead. then you will have 
only me then only me then the two of us amid the pointing and the horror 
beyond the clean flame the arrow increased without motion, then in a 
quick swirl the trout lipped a fly beneath the surface with that sort of 
gigantic delicacy of an elephant picking up a peanut. the fading vortex 
drifted away down stream and then i saw the arrow again, nose into the 
current, wavering delicately to the motion of the water above which the 
may flies slanted and poised. only you and me then amid the pointing and 
the horror walled by the clean flame  
     the trout hung, delicate and motionless among the wavering shadows. 
three boys with fishing poles came onto the bridge and we leaned on the 
rail and looked down at the trout. they knew the fish. he

     "do you think so?" the boy said. they continued to jeer at him, but he 
said nothing more. he leaned on the rail, looking down at the trout which 
he had already spent, and suddenly the acrimony, the conflict, was gone 
from their voices, as if to them too it was as though he had captured the 
fish and bought his horse and wagon, they too partaking of that adult trait 
of being convinced of anything by an assumption of silent superiority. i 
suppose that people, using themselves and each other so much by words, 
are at least consistent in attributing wisdom to a still tongue, and for a 
while i could feel the other two seeking swiftly for some means by which to 
cope with him, to rob him of his horse and wagon.   
     "you couldn't get twenty-five dollars for that pole," the first said. "i bet 
anything you couldn't."   
     "he hasn't caught that trout yet," the third said suddenly, then they both 
cried:   
     "yah, what'd i tell you? what's

ond said. "look. here he comes again." they 
leaned on the rail, motionless, identical, their poles slanting slenderly in 
the sunlight, also identical. the trout rose without haste, a shadow in faint 
wavering increase; again the little vortex faded slowly downstream. "gee," 
the first one murmured.   
     "we dont try to catch him anymore," he said. "we just watch boston 
folks that come out and try."   
     "is he the only fish in this pool?"   
     "yes. he ran all the others out. the best place to fish around here is 
down at the eddy."   
     "no it aint," the second said. "it's better at bigelow's mill two to one." 
then they argued for a while about which was the best fishing and then left 
off all of a sudden to watch the trout rise again and the broken swirl of 
water suck down a little of the sky. i asked how far it was to the nearest 
town. they told me.   
     "but the closest car line is that way," the second said, pointing back 
down the road. "where are you going?"

away, as though it were running through another month or another 
summer somewhere, rushing away under the poised gull and all things 
rushing. except gerald. he would be sort of grand too, pulling in lonely 
state across the noon, rowing himself right out of noon, up the long bright 
air like an apotheosis, mounting into a drowsing infinity where only he and 
the gull, the one terrifically motionless, the other in a steady and measured 
pull and recover that partook of inertia itself, the world punily beneath 
their shadows on the sun. caddy that blackguard that blackguard caddy  
     their voices came over the hill, and the three slender poles like balanced 
threads of running fire. they looked at me passing, not slowing.   
     "well," i said. "i dont see him."   
     "we didn't try to catch him," the first said. "you cant catch that fish."

went on in the dappled shade. we came to an orchard, pink and white. it 
was full of bees; already we could hear them.   
     "let's go to the mill and go swimming," the third said. a lane turned off 
beside the orchard. the third boy slowed and halted. the first went on, 
flecks of sunlight slipping along the pole across his shoulder and down the 
back of his shirt. "come on," the third said. the second boy stopped too. 
why must you marry somebody caddy  
     do you want me to say it do you think that if i say it it wont be

leaves in the thin dust. in the orchard the bees sounded like a wind getting 
up, a sound caught by a spell just under crescendo and sustained. the lane 
went along the wall, arched over, shattered with bloom, dissolving into 
trees. sunlight slante

dirt ridged into her flesh. the coin was damp and warm. i could smell it, 

faintly metallic.   
     "have you got a five cent loaf, please, ma'am?"   
      from beneath the counter she produced a square cut from a newspaper 
sheet and laid it on the counter and wrapped a loaf into it. i laid the coin 
and another one on the counter. "and another one of those buns, please, 
ma'am."   
      she took another bun from the case. "give me that parcel," she said. i 
gave it to her and she unwrapped it and put the third bun in and wrapped 
it and took up the coins and found two coppers in her apron and gave them 
to me. i handed them to the little girl. her fingers closed about them, damp 
and hot, like worms.   
     "you going to give her that bun?" the woman said.   
     "yessum," i said. "i expect your cooking smells as good to her as it does

      we went on. "well," i said. "how about some ice cream?" she was 
eating the gnarled cake. "do you like ice cream?" she gave me a black still 
look, chewing. "come on."   
      we came to the drugstore and had some ice cream. she wouldn't put 
the loaf down. "why not put it down so you can eat better?" i said, offering 
to take it. but she held to it, chewing the ice cream like it was taffy. the 
bitten cake lay on the table. she ate the ice cream steadily, then she fell to 
on the cake again, looking about at the showcases. i finished mine and we 
went out.

e looked at me. she chewed quietly and steadily; at regular intervals a 
small distension passed smoothly down her throat. i opened my package 
and gave her one of the buns. "goodbye," i said.   
      i went on. then i looked back. she was behind me. "do you live down 
this way?" she said nothing. she walked beside me, under my elbow sort 
of, eating. we went on. it was quiet, hardly anyone about getting the odor 
of honeysuckle all mixed she would have told me not to let me sit there on 
the steps hearing her door twilight slamming hearing benjy still crying 
supper she would have to come down then getting honeysuckle all mixed 

up in it    we reached the corner.   
     "well, i've got to go down this way," i said. "goodbye." she stopped too. 
she swallowed the last of the cake, then she began on the bun, watching me 
across it. "goodbye," i said. i turned into the street and went on, but i went 
to the next corner before i stopped.   
     "which way do you live?" i said. "this way?"

    "them furriners. i cant tell one from another. you might take her across 
the tracks where they live, and maybe somebody'll claim her."   
      we went to the postoflice. it was back down the street. the man in the 
frock coat was opening a newspaper.   
     "anse just drove out of town," he said. "i guess you'd better go down 
past the station and walk past them houses by the river. somebody there'll 
know her."   
     "i guess i'll have to," i said. "come on, sister." she pushed the last piece 
of the bun into her mouth and swallowed it. "want another?" i said. she 
looked at me, chewing, her eyes black and unwinking and friendly. i took 
the other two buns out and gave her one and bit into the other. i asked a 
man where the station was and he showed me. "come on, sister."   
      we reached the station and crossed the tracks, where the river was. a 
bridge crossed it, and a street of jumbled frame houses followed the river, 
backed onto it. a shabby street, but with an air hete

back at her. "here?" i said. "this look like your house?"   
      she nodded her head rapidly, looking at me, gnawing into the damp 
halfmoon of the bread. we went on. a walk of broken random flags, 
speared by fresh coarse blades of grass, led to the broken stoop. there was 
no movement about the house at all, and the pink garment hanging in no 
wind from the upper window. there was a bell pull with a porcelain knob, 
attached to about six feet of wire when i stopped pulling and knocked. the 
little girl had the crust edgeways in her chewing mouth.   
      a woman opened the door. she looked at me, then she spoke rapidly to 
the little girl in italian, with a rising inflexion, then a pause, interrogatory. 
she spoke to her again the little girl looking at her across the end of the 
crust, pushing it into her mouth with a dirty hand   

     "she says she lives here." i said. "i met her down town. is this your 
bread?   
     "no spika," the woman said.

she spoke to the little girl again. the little 
girl just looked at her.   
     "no live here?" i said. i pointed to the girl, then at her, then at the door. 
the woman shook her head. she spoke rapidly. she came to the edge of the 
porch and pointed down the road, speaking.   
      i nodded violently too. "you come show?" i said. i took her arm, waving 
my other hand toward the road. she spoke swiftly, pointing. "you come 
show," i said, trying to lead her down the steps.   
     "si, si," she said, holding back, showing me whatever it was. i nodded 
again.   
     "thanks. thanks. thanks." i went down the steps and walked toward 
the gate, not running, but pretty fast. i reached the gate and stopped and 
looked at her for a while. the crust was gone now, and she looked at me 
with her black, friendly stare. the woman stood on the stoop, watching us.   
     "come on, then," i said. "we'll have to find the right one sooner or 
later."

could just slice the walls away all of a sudden. madam, your daughter, if 
you please. no. madam, for god's sake, your daughter. she moved along 
just under my elbow, her shiny tight pigtails, and then the last house 
played out and the road curved out of sight beyond a wall, following the 
river. the woman was emerging from the broken gate, with a shawl over 
ner head and clutched under her chary. the road curved on, empty. i found 
a coin and gave it to the little girl. a quarter. "goodbye, sister," i said. then

     the road went on, still and empty, the sun slanting more and more. her 
stiff little pigtails were bound at the tips with bits of crimson cloth. a 
corner of the wrapping flapped a little as she walked, the nose of the loaf 
naked. i stopped.   
     "look here. do you live down this road? we haven't passed a house in a 
mile, almost."   
     she looked at me, black and secret and friendly.   
     "where do you live, sister? dont you live back there in town?"   
     there was a bird somewhere in the woods, beyond the broken and 
infrequent slanting of sunlight.   
     "your papa's going to be worried abou

the bird whistled again, invisible, a sound meaningless and profound, 
inflexionless, ceasing as though cut off with the blow of a knife, and again, 
and that sense of water swift and peaceful above secret places, felt, not 
seen not heard.   
     "oh, hell, sister." about half the paper hung limp. "that's not doing any 
good now." i tore it off and dropped it beside the road. "come on. we'll 
have to go back to town. we'll go back along the river."   
     we left the road. among the moss little pale flowers grew, and the sense 
of water mute and unseen. i hold to use like this i mean i use to hold she

home now. i've got to get back to school. look how late it's getting. you'll 
go home now, wont you?" but she just looked at me with her black, secret, 

friendly gaze, the half-naked loaf clutched to her breast. "it's wet. i thought 
we jumped back in time." i took my handkerchief and tried to wipe the 
loaf, but the crust began to come off, so i stopped. "we'll just have to let it 
dry itself. hold it like this." she held it like that. it looked kind of like rats 
had been eating it now.    and the water building and building up the

pattering surface like grease on a hot stove. i told you i'd make you

criminal assault. here, you, make that gal shut up that noise."   
     "oh," i said. then i began to laugh. two more boys with plastered heads 
and round eyes came out of the bushes, buttoning shirts that had already 
dampened onto their shoulders and arms, and i tried to stop the laughter, 
but i couldn't.   
     "watch him, anse, he's crazy, i believe."   
     "i'll h-have to qu-quit," i said. "it'll stop in a mu-minute. the other time

they watching me, and the little girl with her streaked face and the gnawed 
looking loaf, and the water swif and peaceful below the path. after a while 
the laughter ran out. but my throat wouldn't quit trying to laugh, like

but she made no reply, only her head turned slowly as the car passed, 
following us with her unwinking gaze. then we ran beside the wall, our 
shadows running along the wall, and after a while we passed a piece of torn 
newspaper lying beside the road and i began to laugh again. i could feel it 
in my throat and i looked off into the trees where the afternoon slanted, 
thinking of afternoon and of the bird and the boys in swimming. but still i 
couldn't stop it and then i knew that if i tried too hard to stop it i'd be 
crying and i thought about how i'd thought about i could not be a virgin, 
with so many of them walking along in the shadows and whispering with 
their soft girlvoices lingering in the shadowy places and the words coming 
out and perfume and eyes you could feel not see, but if it was that simple to 
do it wouldn't be anything and if it wasn't anything, what was i and then

her face looked off into the trees where the sun slanted and where the bird

her blood surged steadily beating and beating against my hand

dead, and my eye, and the cut place on my finger was smarting again. i 
could hear shreve working the pump, then he came back with the basin 
and a round blob of twilight wobbling in it, with a yellow edge like a fading 
balloon, then my reflection. i tried to see my face in it.   
     "has it stopped?" shreve said. "give me the rag." he tried to take it from 
my hand.   
     "look out," i said. "i can do it. yes, it's about stopped now." i dipped the 
rag again, breaking the balloon. the rag stained the water. "i wish i had

went down to the road. roses grew on both sides of the path. i went 
through the gate, onto the road. it dropped downhill, toward the woods, 
and i could make out the auto beside the road. i went up the hill. the light 
increased as i mounted, and before i reached the top i heard a car. it 
sounded far away across the twilight and i stopped and listened to it. i 
couldn't make out the auto any longer, but shreve was standing in the road 
before the house, looking up the hill. behind him the yellow light lay like a 
wash of paint on the roof of the house. i lifted my hand and went on over 
the hill, listening to the car. then the house was gone and i stopped in the 
green and yellow light and heard the car growing louder and louder, until 
just as it began to die away it ceased all together. i waited until i heard it 
start again

. then i went on.   
      as i descended the light dwindled slowly, yet at the same time without 
altering its quality, as if i and not light were changing, decreasing, though 
even when the road ran into trees you could have read a newspaper. pretty 
soon i came to a lane. i turned into it. it was closer and darker than the 
road, but when it came out at the trolley stop--another wooden marquee--
the light was still unchanged. after the lane it seemed brighter, as though i 
had walked through night in the lane and come out into morning again. 
pretty soon the car came. i got on it, they turning to look at my eye, and 
found a seat on the left side.   
      the lights were on in the car, so while we ran between trees i couldn't 
see anything except my own face and a woman across the aisle with a hat 
sitting right on top of her head, with a broken feather in it,

 but when we 

ran out of the trees i could see the twilight again, that quality of light as if 
time really had stopped for a while, with the sun hanging just under the 
horizon, and then we passed the marquee where the old man had been 
eating out of the sack, and the road going on under the twilight, into 
twilight and the sense of water peaceful and swift beyond. then the car 
went on, the draft building steadily up in the open door until it was 
drawing steadily through the car with the odor of summer and darkness 
except honeysuckle. honeysuckle was the saddest odor of all, i think. i 
remember lots of th

      this was where i saw the river for the last time this morning, about 
here. i could feel water beyond the twilight, smell. when it bloomed in the 
spring and it rained the smell was everywhere you didn't notice it so much 
at other times but when it rained the smell began to come into the house at 
twilight either it would rain more at twilight or there was something in the 
light itself but it always smelled strongest then until i would lie in bed 
thinking when will it stop when will it stop. the draft in the door smelled of 
water, a damp steady breath. sometimes i could put myself to sleep saying 
that over and over until after the honeysuckle got all mixed up in it the 
whole thing came to symbolis night and unrest i seemed to be lying neither 
asleep nor awake looking down a long corridor of gray halflight where all 
stable things had become shadowy paradoxical all i had done shadows all i 
had felt suffered taking visible form antic and perverse mocking withou

three policemen to subdue one of them. yes jesus o good man jesus o

      the car stopped. i got out, with them looking at my eye. when the 
trolley came it was full. i stopped on the back platform.   
     "seats up front," the conductor said. i looked into the car. there were no 
seats on the left side.   
     "i'm not going far," i said. "i'll just stand here."   
      we crossed the river. the bridge, that is, arching slow and high into 
space, between silence and nothingness where lights-- yellow and red and 
green--trembled in the clear air, repeating themselves.

she stumbled back against the wall, holding her kimono shut.  
      "all right," i says. "we'll just put this off a while. but dont think you can

her. "quentin," mother says. "you, quentin." quentin ran on. i could hear 
her when she reached the top, then in the hall. then the door slammed.  
      mother had stopped. then she came on. "dilsey," she says.

wall, but be damned if i was going to put it on. i backed out and turned 
around. she was standing by the drive. i says,

hands and made like she would tear it.  
      "you tear that dress," i says, "and i'll give you a whipping right here 
that you'll remember all your life."  
      "see if i dont," she says. then i saw that she really was trying to tear it, 
to tear it right off of her. by the time i got the car stopped and grabbed her 
hands there was about a dozen people looking. it made me so mad for a 
minute it kind of blinded me.  
      "you do a thing like that again and i'll make you sorry you ever drew 
breath," i says.  
      "i'm sorry now," she says. she quit, then her eyes turned kind of funny 
and i says to myself if you cry here in this car, on the street, i'll whip you. 
i'll wear you out. lucky for her she didn't, so i turned her wrists loose and

sorry now," she says. "i dont see why i was ever born."  
      "and i know of at least one other person that dont understand all he

had rung, and the last of them were just going in. "you're on time for once, 
anyway," i says. "are you going in there and stay there, or am i coming 
with you and make you?" she got out and banged the door. "remember 
what i say," i says. "i mean it. let me hear one more time that you are

up."  
      i went on to the back, where old job was uncrating them, at the rate of 
about three bolts to the hour.

stop my clock with a nose spray and then you can send ben to the navy i 
says or to the cavalry anyway, they use geldings in the cavalry. then when 
she sent quentin home for me to feed too i says i guess that's right too, 
instead of me having to go way up north for a job they sent the job down 
here to me and then mother begun to cry and i says it's not that i have any 
objection to having it here; if it's any satisfaction to you i'll quit work and 
nurse it myself and let you and dilsey keep the f

grandparents it's got can say for certain. only i says it's only a question of 
time. if you believe she'll do what she says and not try to see it, you fool 
yourself because the first time that was the mother kept on saying thank 
god you are not a compson except in name, because you are all i have left 
now, you and maury and i says well i could spare uncle maury myself and 
then they came and said they were ready to start. mother stopped crying 
then. she pulled her veil down and we went down stairs. uncle maury was 
coming out of the diningroom, his handkerchief to his mouth. they kind of 
made a lane and we went out the door just in time to see dilsey driving ben 
and t. p. back around the corner. we went down the steps and got in. 
uncle maury kept saying poor little sister, poor little sister, talking around 
his mouth and patting mother's hand. talking around whatever it was.  
      "have you got your band on?" she says

      "hush, caroline," father says.  
      "what you want to go on like that fo jason fer?" dilsey says.  
      "i've tried to protect him," mother says. "i've always tried to protect him 
from it. at least i can do my best to shield her."  
      "how sleepin in dis room gwine hurt her, i like to know," dilsey says.  
      "i cant help it," mother says. "i know i'm just a troublesome old 
woman. but i know that people cannot flout god's laws with impunity."  
      "nonsense," father says. "fix it in miss caroline's room then, dilsey."  
      "you can say nonsense," mother says. "but she must never know. she 
must never even learn that name. dilsey, i forbid you ever to speak that 
name in her hearing. if she could grow up never to know that she had a 
mother, i would thank god."  
      "dont be a fool," father says.

      dilsey fixed the cradle and undressed her and put her in it. she never 
had waked up since he brought her in the house.  
      "she pretty near too big fer hit," dilsey says. "dar now. i gwine spread 
me a pallet right across de hall, so you wont need to git up in de night."  
      "i wont sleep," mother says. "you go on home. i wont mind. i'll be 
happy to give the rest of my life to her, if i can just prevent--"  
      "hush, now," dilsey says. "we gwine take keer of her. en you go on to 
bed too," she says to me. "you got to go to school tomorrow."  
      so i went out, then mother called me back and cried on me a while.  
      "you are my only hope," she says. "every night i thank god for you." 
while we were waiting there for them to start she says thank god if he had 
to be taken too, it is you left me and not quentin. thank god you are not a

and maury and i says, well i 
could spare uncle maury myself. well, he kept on patting her hand with 
his black glove, talking away from her. he took them off when his turn with 
the shovel came. he got up near the first, where they were holding the 
umbrellas over them, stamping every now and then and trying to kick the 
mud off their feet and sticking to the shovels so they'd have to knock it off, 
making a hollow sound when it fell on it, and when i stepped back around 
the hack i could see him behind a tombstone, taking another one out of a 
bottle. i thought he never was going to stop because i had on my new suit 
too, but it happened that there wasn't much mud on the wheels yet, only 

mother saw it and says i dont know when you'll ever have another one and 
uncle maury says, "now, now. dont you worry at all. you have me to 
depend on, always."  
      and we have. always. the fourth letter was from him. but there wasn't 
any need to open it

. i could have written it myself, or recited it to her from 
memory, adding ten dollars just to be safe. but i had a hunch about that 
other letter. i just felt that it was about time she was up to some of her 
tricks again. she got pretty wise after that first time. she found out pretty 
quick that i was a different breed of cat from father. when they begun to 
get it filled up toward the top mother started crying sure enough, so uncle 
maury got in with her and drove off. he says you can come in with 
somebody; they'll be glad to give you a lift. i'll have to take your mother on 
and i thought about saying, yes you ought to brought two bottles instead of 
just one only i thought about where we were, so i let them go on. little 
they cared how wet i got, because then mother could have a whale of a time 
being afraid i was taking pneumonia.  
      well, i got to thinking about that a

wouldn't come back here. i thought you had more sense than that."  
      "yes?" she says. she looked at the flowers again. there must have been 
fifty dollars' worth. somebody had put one bunch on quentin's. "you did?" 
she says.  
      "i'm not surprised though," i says. "i wouldn't put anything past you.

jason."

have come back. there's not anything left. ask uncle maury, if you dont

and took the money. she still held to it. "you'll do it?" she says, looking at 
me from under the veil. "you promise?"  
      "let go," i says. "you want somebody to come along and see us?"  
      she let go. i put the money in my pocket. "you'll do it, jason?" she says.

asked if they had paid for it yet and he said no and i said mrs compson 
forgot something and wanted it again, so they let me take it. mink was 
driving. i bought him a cigar, so we drove around until it begun to get dark 
on the back streets where they wouldn't see him. then mink said he'd have 
to take the team on back and so i said i'd buy him another cigar and so we 
drove into the lane and i went across the yard to the house. i stopped in the 
hall until i could hear mother and uncle maury upstairs, then i went on 
back to the kitchen. she and ben were there with dilsey. i said mother 
wanted her and i took her into the house. i found uncle maury's raincoat 
and put it around her and picked her up and went back to the lane and got 
in the hack. i told mink to drive to the depot. he was afraid to pass the 
stable, so we had to go the back way and i saw her standing on the corner 
under the light and i told mink to drive clos

      "hit 'em, mink!" i says, and mink gave them a cut and we went past her 
like a fire engine. "now get on that train like you promised," i says. i could 
see her running after us through the back window. "hit 'em again," i says. 

"let's get on home." when we turned the corner she was still running.  
      and so i counted the money again that night and put it away, and i 
didn't feel so bad. i says i reckon that'll show you. i reckon you'll know now 
that you cant beat me out of a job and get away with it. it never occurred to 
me she wouldn't keep her prom

you'd thought we were killing him. so i made dilsey own up, then i told 
mother. we had to take her up to bed then, and after things got quieted 
down a little i put the fear of god into dilsey. as much as you can into a 
nigger, that is. that's the trouble with nigger servants, when they've been 
with you for a long time they get so full of self importance that they're not 
worth a dam. think they run the whole family.  
      "i like to know whut's de hurt in lettin dat po chile see her own baby," 
dilsey says. "if mr jason was still here hit ud be different."  
      "only mr jason's not here," i says. "i know you wont pay me any mind, 
but i reckon you'll do what mother says. you keep on worrying her like this 
until you get her into the graveyard too, then you can fill the whole house 
full of ragtag and bobtail. but what did you want to let that dam boy see her 
for?"

      "say it out," i says. "i dont reckon it's any secret what you and i think of 
one another. maybe you want the money back," i says.  
      "listen, jason," she says. "dont lie to me now. about her. i wont ask to

that she'll--that she--you can do that. things for her. be kind to her. little

"i run more risk than you do, because you haven't got anything at stake. so 
if you expect--"  
      "no," she says, then she begun to laugh and to try to hold it back all at 
the same time. "no. i have nothing at stake," she says, making that noise, 
putting her hands to her mouth. "nuh-nuh-nothing," she says.  
      "here," i says. "stop that!"  
      "i'm tr-trying to," she says, holding her hands over her mouth. "oh god, 
oh god."

of town now, you hear?"  
      "wait," she says, catching my arm. "i've stopped. i wont again. you 
promise, jason?" she says, and me feeling her eyes almost like they were 
touching my face. "you promise? mother--that--money if sometimes she 
needs things-- if i send checks for her to you, other ones besides those,

      and so when earl came up front with his hat on he says, "i'm going to 
step up to rogers' and get a snack. we wont have time to go home to 
dinner, i reckon."  
      "what's the matter we wont have time?" i says.  
      "with this show in town and all," he says. "they're going to give an 
afternoon performance too, and they'll all want to get done trading in time 
to go to it. so we'd better just run up to rogers'."

      so when i went back and opened it the only thing that surprised me was 
it was a money order not a check. yes, sir. you cant trust a one of them. 

after all the risk i'd taken, risking mother finding out about her coming 
down here once or twice a year sometimes, and me having to tell mother 
lies about it. that's gratitude for you. and i wouldn't put it past her to try 
to notify the postoffice not to let anyone except her cash it. giving a kid like 
that fifty dollars. why i never saw fifty dollars until i was twentyone years 
old, with all the other boys with the afternoon off and all day saturday and 
me working in a store. like i say, how can they expect anybody to control 
her, with her giving her money behind our backs. she has the same home 
you had i says, and the same raising. i reckon mother is a better judge of 
what she needs than you

looking at me.

      "now you go on back to school this afternoon, you hear?" i says. she 
didn't answer. she crumpled the bill up in her hand like it was a rag or 
something and went on out the front door just as earl came in. a customer 
came in with him and they stopped up front. i gathered up the things and 
put on my hat and went up front.

      "not much," i says. he looked out the door.

      we ate for a while. mother sent dilsey to the front to look for quentin

      "i keep telling you she's not coming to dinner," i says.  
      "she knows better than that," mother says. "she knows i dont permit

      "if you wouldn't come interfering, i'd make her mind," i says. "it 
wouldn't take me but about one day to straighten her out."

mine until we get done collecting every month. that's why it's late 
sometimes."

alone, because i've got to get on back. i'll get the bank book."  
      "i'll get it," she says.  
      "keep still," i says. "i'll get it." i went up stairs and got the bank book 
out of her desk and went back to town. i went to the bank and deposited 
the check and the money order and the other ten, and stopped at the 
telegraph office. it was one point above the opening. i had already lost 
thirteen points, all because she had to come helling in there at twelve, 
worrying me about that letter.

a man gets into a rut the best thing you can do is let him stay there. and 
when a man gets it in his head that he's got to tell something on you for 
your own good, goodnight. i'm glad i haven't got the sort of conscience i've 
got to nurse like a sick puppy all the time. if i'd ever be as careful over 
anything as he is to keep his little shirt tail full of business from making 
him more than eight percent. i reckon he thinks they'd get him on the 
usury law if he netted more than eight percent. what the hell chance has a 
man got, tied down in a town like this and to a business like this. why i 
could take his business in one year and fix him so he'd never have to work 
again, only he'd give it all away to the church or something. if there's one 
thing gets under my skin, it's a dam hypocrite. a man that thinks anything

and whirled and just as i was thinking what the hell they were up to, i saw 
that red tie. then i recognised her face looking back through the window. 
it whirled into the alley. i saw it turn again, but when i got to the back 
street it was just disappearing, running like hell.  
      i saw red. when i recognised that red tie, after all i had told her, i 
forgot about everything. i never thought about my head even until i came 
to the first forks and had to stop. yet we spend money and spend money on 
roads and dam if it isn't like trying to drive over a sheet of corrugated iron 
roofing. i'd like to know how a man could be expected to keep up with even 
a wheelbarrow. i think too much of my car; i'm not going to hammer it to 
pieces like it was a ford. chances were they had stolen it, anyway, so why 
should they give a dam. like i say blood always tells. if you've got blood 
like that in you, you'll do anything. i says whatever claim you believe she

says if i've got to spend half my time being a dam detective, at least i'll go 
where i can get paid for it.  
      so i had to stop there at the forks. then i remembered it. it felt like 
somebody was inside with a hammer, beating on it. i says i've tried to keep 
you from being worried by her; i says far as i'm concerned, let her go to 
hell as fast as she pleases and the sooner the better. i says what else do you 
expect except every dam drummer and cheap show that comes to town 
because even these town jellybeans give her the go-by now. you dont know 
what goes on i says, you dont hear the talk that i hear and you can jus

l at it as she did at everything else she did. like i say it's 
not that i object to so much; maybe she cant help that, it's because she 
hasn't even got enough consideration for her own family to have any 

discretion. i'm afraid all the time i'll run into them right in the middle of 
the street or under a wagon on the square, like a couple of dogs.  
      i parked and got out. and now i'd have to go way around and cross a 
plowed field, the only one i had seen since i left town, with every step like 
somebody was walking along behind me, hitting me on the head with a 
club. i kept thinking that when i got across the field at least i'd have 
something level to walk on, that wouldn't jolt me every step, but when i got 
into the woods it was full of underbrush and i had to twist around through 
it, and then i came to a ditch full of briers. i went along it for a while, but it 
got thicker and thicker, and all the time earl probably telephoning home 
about where i was and getting mother al

      when i finally got through i had had to wind around so much that i had 
to stop and figure out just where the car would be. i knew they wouldn't be 
far from it, just under the closest bush, so i turned and worked back 
toward the road. then i couldn't tell just how far i was, so i'd have to stop 
and listen, and then with my legs not using so much blood, it all would go 
into my head like it would explode any minute, and the sun getting down 
just to where it could shine straight into my eyes and my ears ringing so i 
couldn't hear anything. i went on, trying to move quiet, then i heard a dog 
or something and i knew that when he scented me he'd have to come 
helling up, then it would be all off.  
      i had gotten beggar lice and twigs and stuff all over me, inside my 
clothes and sh

oes and all, and then i happened to look around and i had 
my hand right on a bunch of poison oak. the only thing i couldn't 
understand was why it was just poison oak and not a snake or something. 
so i didn't even bother to move it. i just stood there until the dog went 
away. then i went on.  
      i didn't have any idea where the car was now. i couldn't think about 
anything except my head, and i'd just stand in one place and sort of 
wonder if i had really seen a ford even, and i didn't even care much 
whether i had or not. like i say, let her lay out all day and all night with 
everthing in town that wears pants, what do i care. i dont owe anyt

ard sundown, and town was 
about five miles. they never even had guts enough to puncture it, to jab a 
hole in it. they just let the air out. i just stood there for a while, thinking 
about that kitchen full of niggers and not one of them had time to lift a tire 
onto the rack and screw up a couple of bolts. it was kind of funny because 
even she couldn't have seen far enough ahead to take the pump out on 
purpose, unless she thought about it while he was letting out the air maybe. 

but what it probably was was somebody took it out and gave it to ben to 
play with for a squirt gun because they'd take the whole car to pieces if he 
wanted it and dilsey says, aint nobody teched yo car. what we want to fool 
with hit fer? and i says you're a nigger. you're lucky, do you know it? i says 
i'll swap with you any day because it takes a white man not to have 
anymore sense than to worry about what a little slut of a girl does.  
      i walked up to russell's. he had a pump. that was just an ove

their part, i reckon. only i still couldn't believe she'd have had the nerve to. 
i kept thinking that. i dont know why it is i cant seem to learn that a 
woman'll do anything. i kept thinking, let's forget for a while how i feel 
toward you and how you feel toward me: i just wouldn't do you this way. i 
wouldn't do you this way no matter what you had done to me. because like 
i say blood is blood and you cant get around it. it's not playing a joke that 
any eight year old boy could have thought of, it's letting your own uncle be 
laughed at by a man that would wear a red tie. they come into town and 
call us all a bunch of hicks and think it's too small to hold them. well he 
doesn't know just how right he is. and her too. if that's the way she feels 
about it, she'd better keep right on going and a dam good riddance.

worthy of you and i says yes i could. you'd get right up out of your grave

care of now if i married a wife she'd probably turn out to be a hophead or 
something. that's all we lack in this family, i says.  
      the sun was down beyond the methodist church now, and the pigeons 
were flying back and forth around the steeple, and when the band stopped 
i could hear them cooing. it hadn't been four months since christmas, and 
yet they were almost as thick as ever. i reckon parson walthall was getting 
a belly full of them now. you'd have thought we were shooting people, with 
him making speeches and even holding onto a man's gun when they came 
over. talking about peace on earth good will toward all and not a sparrow 
can fall to earth. but what does he care how thick they get, he hasn't got 
anything to do: what does he care what time it

until he got back with it." i ate for a while.  
      "who was it?" mother says.  
      "it was one of those show men," i says. "it seems his sister's husband 
was out riding with some town woman, and he was chasing them."  
      quentin sat perfectly still, chewing.

opened and dilsey emerged once more, this time in a man's felt hat and an 
army overcoat, beneath the frayed skirts of which her blue gingham dress 
fell in uneven balloonings, streaming too about her as she crossed the yard 
and mounted the steps to the kitchen door.    
     a moment later she emerged, carrying an open umbrella now, which she 
slanted ahead into the wind, and crossed to the woodpile and laid the 
umbrella down, still open. immediately she caught at it and arrested it and 
held to it for a while, looking about her. then she closed it and laid it down 
and stacked stovewood into her crooked arm, against her breast, and 
picked up the umbrella and got it open at last and returned to the steps and

room. as she got into bed again she could hear dilsey yet descending the 
stairs with a sort of painful and terrific slowness that would have become 
maddening had it not presently ceased beyond the flapping diminishment 
of the pantry door.    
     she entered the kitchen and built up the fire and began to prepare 
breakfast. in the midst of this she ceased and went to the window and 
looked out toward her cabin, then she went to the door and opened it and 
shouted into the driving weather.

     he loaded himself mountainously with stove wood. he could not see 
over it, and he staggered to the steps and up them and blundered crashing 
against the door, shedding billets. then dilsey came and opened the door 
for him and he blundered across the kitchen. "you, luster!"hah!"" she 
shouted, but he had already hurled the wood into the box with a 
thunderous crash. "hah!" he said.

ground the sifter steadily above the bread board, she sang, to herself at 
first, something without particular tune or words, repetitive, mournful and 
plaintive, austere, as she ground a faint, steady snowing of flour onto the 
bread board. the stove had begun to heat the room and to fill it with 
murmurous minors of the fire, and presently she was singing louder, as if 
her voice too had been thawed out by the growing warmth, and then mrs

mounted, steadying herself against the wall with one hand, holding her 
skirts up with the other.    
     "are you going to wake him up just to dress him?" she said.    
     dilsey stopped. with her foot lifted to the next step she stood there, her 
hand against the wall and the gray splash of the window behind her, 
motionless and shapeless she loomed.

day in and day out. you owe nothing to them, to mr compson's memory. i 
know you have never had any tenderness for jason. you've never tried to

body from step to step, as a small child does, her hand against the wall.

     she returned to the kitchen. she looked into the stove, then she drew

harsh and minute, but the scene was empty of all else that moved. she

appeared to have been shaped of some substance whose particles would 
not or did not cohere to one another or to the frame which supported it. 
his skin was dead looking and hairless; dropsical too, he moved with a 
shambling gait like a trained bear. his hair was pale and fine. it had been 
brushed smoothly down upon his brow like that of children in 
daguerrotypes. his eyes were clear, of the pale sweet blue of cornflowers, 
his thick mouth hung open, drooling a little.

his hand.

his voice ceased, ebbed, left him staring at his mother with eyes that for an 
instant were quite empty of anything. it was as though his eyes were 
holding their breath, while his mother looked at him, her face flaccid and 
querulous, interminable, clairvoyant yet obtuse. as they sat so dilsey said,    
     "quentin. dont play wid me, honey. come on to breakfast, honey. dey

     "i cant understand it," mrs compson said. "it's just as if somebody had 
tried to break into the house--" jason sprang up. his chair crashed over 
backward. "what--" mrs compson said, staring at him as he ran past her 
and went jumping up the stairs, where he met dilsey. his face was now in 
shadow, and dilsey said,    
     "she sullin. yo maw aint unlocked--" but jason ran on past her and

room, then he stepped aside. "go in," he said in a thick, light voice. they 
went in. it was not a girl's room. it was not anybody's room, and the faint 
scent of cheap cosmetics and the few feminine objects and the other 
evidences of crude and hopeless efforts to feminise it but added to its 
anonymity, giving it that dead and stereotyped transience of rooms in 
assignation houses. the bed had not been disturbed. on the floor lay a

wind, and an automobile passed somewhere and died away also. his 
mother spoke his name again beyond the door, but he didn't move. he 
heard dilsey lead her away up the hall, and then a door closed. then he 
replaced the box in the closet and flung the garments back into it and went 
down stairs to the telephone. while he stood there with the receiver to his 
ear waiting dilsey came down the stairs. she looked at him, without 
stopping, and went on.    
     the wire opened. "this is jason compson," he said, his voice so harsh 
and thick that he had to repeat himself. "jason compson," he said, 
controlling his voice. "have a car ready, with a deputy, if you cant go, in ten

     they went out. dilsey stood for a while at the table, then she went and 
cleared the breakfast things from the diningroom and ate her breakfast and 
cleaned up the kitchen. then she removed her apron and hung it up and 
went to the foot of the stairs and listened for a moment. there was no 
sound. she donned the overcoat and the hat and went across to her cabin.    
     the rain had stopped. the air now drove out of the southeast, broken 
overhead into blue patches. upon the crest of a hill beyond the trees and 
roofs and spires of town sunlight lay like a pale scrap of cloth, was blotted 
away. upon the air a bell came, then as if at a signal, other bells took up the 
sound and repeated it.    
     the cabin door opened and dilsey emerged, again in the maroon cape 
and the purple gown, and wearing soiled white elbow-length gloves and 
minus her headcloth now. she came into the

 yard and called luster. she 
waited a while, then she went to the house and around it to the cellar door, 
moving close to the wall, and looked into the door. ben sat on the steps. 

before him luster squatted on the damp floor. he held a saw in his left 
hand, the blade sprung a little by pressure of his hand, and he was in the 
act of striking the blade with the worn wooden mallet with which she had 
been making beaten biscuit for more than thirty years. the saw gave forth 
a single sluggish twang that ceased with lifeless alacrity, leaving the blade 
in a thin clean curve between luster's hand and the floor. still, inscrutable, 
it bellied.    
     "dat's de way he

     he put the saw away and brought the mallet to her. then ben wailed 
again, hopeless and prolonged. it was nothing. just sound. it might have 
been all time and injustice and sorrow become vocal for an instant by a 
conjunction of planets.    
     "listen at him," luster said. "he been gwine on dat way ev'y since you 
vent us outen de house. i dont know whut got in to him dis mawnin."    
     "bring him here," dilsey said.    
     "come on, benjy," luster said. he went back down the steps and took 
ben's arm. he came obediently, wailing, that slow hoarse sound that ships 
make, that seems to begin before the sound itself has started, seems to 
cease before the sound itself has stopped.    
     "run and git his cap," dilsey said. "dont make no noise miss cahline kin 
hear. hurry, now. we already late."    
     "she gwine hear him anyhow, ef you dont stop him," luster said.    
     "he stop when we git off de place," dilsey said. "he smellin hit. dat's

door, ben one step below her. the sky was broken now into scudding 
patches that dragged their swift shadows up out of the shabby garden, over 
the broken fence and across the yard. dilsey stroked ben's head, slowly and 
steadily, smoothing the bang upon his brow. he wailed quietly, 

unhurriedly. "hush," dilsey said. "hush, now. we be gone in a minute. 
hush, now." he wailed quietly and steadily.    
     luster returned, wearing a stiff new straw hat with a colored band and 
carrying a cloth cap. the hat seemed

flowered hat. she was a thin woman, with a flat, pleasant face.    
     "you got six weeks' work right dar on yo back," dilsey said. "whut you 
gwine do ef hit rain?"    
     "git wet, i reckon," frony said. "i aint never stopped no rain yit."

     a street turned off at right angles, descending, and became a dirt road. 
on either hand the land dropped more sharply; a broad flat dotted with 
small cabins whose weathered roofs were on a level with the crown of the 
road. they were set in small grassless plots littered with broken things, 
bricks, planks, crockery, things of a once utilitarian value. what growth 
there was consisted of rank weeds and the trees were mulberries and 
locusts and sycamores--trees that partook also of the foul desiccation 
which surrounded the houses; trees whose very burgeoning seemed to be 
the sad and stubborn remnant of september, as if even spring had passed 
them by, leaving them to feed upon the rich and unmistakable smell of 
negroes in which they grew.    
     from the doors negroes spoke to them as they passed, to dilsey 
usually:    
     "sis' gibson! how you dis mawnin?" "i'm well. is you well?"    
     "i'm right well, i thank you."

     "dat's too bad. but rev'un shegog'll kyo dat. he'll give her de comfort en

     the road rose again, to a scene like a painted backdrop. notched into a 
cut of red clay crowned with oaks the road appeared to stop short off, like a 
cut ribbon. beside it a weathered church lifted its crazy steeple like a 
painted church, and the whole scene was as flat and without perspective as 
a painted cardboard set upon the ultimate edge of the flat earth, against the 
windy sunlight of space and april and a midmorning filled with bells. 
toward the church they thronged with slow sabbath deliberation, the 
women and children went on in, the men stopped outside and talked in 
quiet groups until the bell ceased ringing

the pulpit was empty, though the choir was already in place, fanning 
themselves although it was not warm.    
     most of the women were gathered on one side of the room. they were 
talking. then the bell struck one time and they dispersed to their seats and 
the congregation sat for an instant, expectant. the bell struck again one 

time. the choir rose and began to sing and the congregation turned its 
head as one as six small children--four girls with tight pigtails bound with 
small scraps of cloth like butterflies, and two boys with close napped 
heads--entered and marched up the aisle, strung together in a harness of 
white ribbons and flowers, and followed by two men in single file. the 
second man was huge, of a light coffee color, imposing in a frock coat and 
white tie. his head was magisterial and profound, his neck rolled above his 
collar in rich folds. but he was familiar to them, and so the heads were still 
reverted when he had passed, a

reading desk with one arm resting upon it at shoulder height and his 
monkey body as reft of all motion as a mummy or an emptied vessel, the 
congregation sighed as if it waked from a collective dream and moved a 
little in its seats. behind the pulpit the choir fanned steadily. dilsey 

whispered, "hush, now. dey fixin to sing in a minute."    
     then a voice said, "brethren."    
     the preacher had not moved. his arm lay yet across the desk, and he 
still held that pose while the voice died in sonorous echoes between the 
walls. it was as different as day and dark from his former tone, with a sad, 
timbrous quality like an alto horn, sinking into their hearts and speaking 
there again when it had ceased in fading and cumulate echoes.    
     "brethren and sisteren," it said again. the preacher removed his arm 
and he began to walk back and forth before the desk, his hands clasped 
behind him, a meagre figure, hunched over upon itself like that of one long

     before they reached the street though she stopped and lifted her skirt 
and dried her eyes on the hem of her topmost underskirt. then they went 
on. ben shambled along beside dilsey, watching luster who anticked along 
ahead, the umbrella in his hand and his new straw hat slanted viciously in 
the sunlight, like a big foolish dog watching a small clever one. they 
reached the gate and entered. immediately ben began to whimper again, 
and for a while all of them looked up the drive at the square, paintless

     luster gave her the hat and he and ben went on across the back yard. 
ben was still whimpering, though not loud. dilsey and frony went to the 
cabin. after a while dilsey emerged, again in the faded calico dress, and 
went to the kitchen. the fire had died down. there was no sound in the 
house. she put on the apron and went up s

     dilsey crossed to the bed and groped among the shadows beneath the 
edge of it and found the bible, face down. she smoothed the bent pages and 
laid the book on the bed again. mrs compson didn't open her eyes. her 
hair and the pillow were the same color, beneath the wimple of the 
medicated cloth she looked like an old nun praying. "dont put it there

lines of the hymn which she remembered. "y'all kin g'awn en eat," she said. 
"jason aint comin home."    
     he was twenty miles away at that time. when he left the house he drove 
rapidly to town, overreaching the slow sabbath groups and the peremptory 
bells along the broken air. he crossed the empty square and turned into a 
narrow street that was abruptly quieter even yet, and stopped before a 
frame house and went up the flower bordered walk to the porch.    
     beyond the screen door people were talking. as he lifted his hand to 
knock he heard steps, so he withheld his hand until a big man in black 
broadcloth trousers and a stiff bosomed white shirt without collar opened 
the door. he had vigorous untidy iron-gray hair and his gray eyes were 
round and shiny like a little boy's. he took jason's hand and drew him into 
the house, still shaking it.

looked out across the street, his hands in his pockets.    
     "and when i come to you, a commissioned officer of the law," jason 
said.    
     "that show's in mottson this week," the sheriff said.    
     "yes," jason said. "and if i could find a law officer that gave a solitary 
damn about protecting the people that elected him to office, i'd be there 
too by now." he repeated his story, harshly recapitulant, seeming to get an 
actual pleasure out of his outrage and impotence. the sheriff did not 
appear to be listening at all.    
     "jason," he said. "what were you doing with three thousand dollars hid 
in the house?"    
     "what?" jason said. "that's my business where i keep my money. your 
business is to help me get it back."

     "that's your answer, is it?" jason said. "think well, now."    
     "that's it, jason."    
     "all right," jason said. he put his hat on. "you'll regret this. i wont be 
helpless. this is not russia, where just because he wears a little metal 
badge, a man is immune to law." he went down the steps and got in his car 
and started the engine. the sheriff watched him drive away, turn, and rush 
past the house toward town.    
     the bells were ringing again, high in the scudding sunlight in bright 
disorderly tatters of sound. he stopped at a filling station and had his tires 
examined and the tank filled.    
     "gwine on a trip, is you?" the negro asked him. he didn't answer. "look

aining like hell by twelve oclock." he 
looked at the sky, thinking about rain, about the slick clay roads, himself 
stalled somewhere miles from town. he thought about it with a sort of 
triumph, of the fact that he was going to miss dinner, that by starting now 
and so serving his compulsion of haste, he would be at the greatest possible 
distance from both towns when noon came. it seemed to him that in this 
circumstance was giving him a break, so he said to the negro:    
     "what the hell are you doing? has somebody paid you to keep this car 
standing here as long as you can?"    
     "dis here ti' aint got no air a-tall in hit," the negro said.    
     "then get the hell away from there and let me have that tube," jason 
said.

gine, jamming 
the throttle down and snapping the choker in and out savagely. "it's going 
to rain," he said. "get me half way there, and rain like hell." and he drove 
on out of the bells and out of town, thinking of himself slogging through 
the mud, hunting a team. "and every damn one of them will be at church." 
he thought of how he'd find a church at last and take a team and of the 
owner coming out, shouting at him and of himself striking the man down. 
"i'm jason compson. see if you can stop me. see if you can elect a man to 
office that can stop me," he said, thinking of himself entering the 

courthouse with a file of soldiers and dragging the sheriff out. "thinks he 
can sit with his hands folded and see me lose my job. i'll show him about 
jobs." of his niece he did not think at all, nor of the arbitrary valuation of 
the money. neither of them had had entity or individuality for him for ten 
years; together they merely symbolised the job in the bank of which he had 
been depri

     the air brightened, the running shadow patches were now the obverse, 
and it seemed to him that the fact that the day was clearing was another 
cunning stroke on the part of the foe, the fresh battle toward which he was 
carrying ancient wounds. from time to time he passed churches, 
unpainted frame buildings with sheet iron steeples, surrounded by 
tethered teams and shabby motorcars, and it seemed to him that each of 
them was a picket-post where the rear guards of circumstance peeped 
fleetingly back at him. "and damn you, too," he said. "see if you can stop 
me," thinking of himself, his file of soldiers with the manacled sheriff in the 
rear, dragging omnipotence down from his throne, if necessary; of the 
embattled legions of both hell and heaven through which he tore his way 
and put his hands at last on his fleeing niece.    
     the wind was out of the southeast. it blew steadily upon his cheek. it 
seemed that he could

feel the prolonged blow of it sinking through his 
skull, and suddenly with an old premonition he clapped the brakes on and 
stopped and sat perfectly still. then he lifted his hand to his neck and 
began to curse, and sat there, cursing in a harsh whisper. when it was 
necessary for him to drive for any length of time he fortified himself with a 
handkerchief soaked in camphor, which he would tie about his throat when 
clear of town, thus inhaling the fumes, and he got out and lifted the seat 
cushion on the chance that there might be a forgotten one there. he looked 
beneath both seats and stood again for a while, cursing, seeing him

hey told him that the tent was not up yet, but that the show 
cars were on a siding at the station. he drove there.    
     two gaudily painted pullman cars stood on the track. he reconnoitred 
them before he got out. he was trying to breathe shallowly, so that the 
blood would not beat so in his skull. he got out and went along the station 
wall, watching the cars. a few garments hung out of the windows, limp and 
crinkled, as though they had been recently laundered. on the earth beside 
the steps of one sat three canvas chairs. but he saw no sign of life at all 
until a man in a dirty apron came to the door and emptied a pan of 
dishwater with a broad gesture, the sunlight glinting on the metal belly of 
the pan, then entered the car again.    
     now i'll have to take him by surprise, before he can warn them, he 
thought. it never occurred to him that they might not be there, in the car.

whether he saw them

nature and contrary to the whole rhythm of events. and more than that: he 
must see them first, get the money back, then what they did would be of no 
importance to him, while otherwise the whole world would know that he, 
jason compson, had been robbed by quentin, his niece, a bitch.    
     he reconnoitred again. then he went to the car and mounted the steps, 
swiftly and quietly, and paused at the door. the galley was dark, rank with 
stale food. the man was a white blur, singing in a cracked, shaky tenor. an 
old man, he thought, and not as big as i am. he entered the car as the man 
looked up.    
     "hey?" the man said, stopping his song.    
     "where are they?" jason said. "quick, now. in the sleeping car?"    
     "where's who?" the man said.

there was no sound. she returned through the kitchen and out the outer 
door and stopped on the steps. ben and luster were not in sight, but while 
she stood there she heard another sluggish twang from the direction of the 
cellar door and she went to the door and looked down upon a repetition of 
the morning's scene.

saw with a kind of hopeful dejection. "i aint got de right thing to hit it wid

     "now, dont you git started," luster said. "i had enough trouble wid you

wires. luster lay down in the swing, but ben went on vaguely and 
purposelessly. he began to whimper again. "hush, now," luster said. "i

 ben had stopped moving, but 
luster could hear him whimpering. "is you gwine hush, er aint you?" 
luster said. he got up and followed and came upon ben squatting before a 
small mound of earth. at either end of it an empty bottle of blue glass that 
once contained poison was fixed in the ground. in one was a withered stalk 
of jimson weed. ben squatted before it, moaning, a slow, inarticulate 
sound. still moaning he sought vaguely about and found a twig and put it 
in the other bottle. "whyn't you hush?" lu

     "here, caddie. bring the bag."    
     "hush, benjy," luster said, but ben went on at his shambling trot, 
clinging to the fence, wailing in his hoarse, hopeless voice. the man played 
and went on, ben keeping pace with him until the fence turned at right 
angles, and he clung to the fence, watching the people move on and away.    
     "will you hush now?" luster said. "will you hush now?" he shook ben's 
arm. ben clung to the fence, wailing steadily and hoarsely. "aint you gwine 
stop?" luster said. "or is you?" ben gazed through the fence. "all right, 
den," luster said. "you want somethin to belier about?" he looked over his 
shoulder, toward the house. then he whispered: "caddy! beller now. 
"caddy! "caddy! "caddy!

than astonishment in it, it was horror; shock; agony eyeless, tongueless; 
just sound, and luster's eyes backrolling for a white instant. "gret god," he 
said. "hush! hush! gret god!" he whirled again and struck queenie with 
the switch. it broke and he cast it away and with ben's voice mounting 
toward its unbelievable crescendo luster caught up the end of the reins

and sawed queenie about and doubled the reins back and slashed her 
across the hips. he cut her again and again, into a plunging gallop, while 
ben's hoarse agony roared about them, and swung her about to the right of 
the monument. then he struck luster over the head with his fist.

sometimes "de l'homme") by his fosterbrother, a chevalier of france, who 
had he not been born too late could have been among the brightest in that 
glittering galaxy of knightly blackguards who were napoleon's marshals, 
who thus translated the chickasaw title meaning "the man"; which 
translation ikkemotubbe, himself a man of wit and imagination as well as a 
shrewd judge of character, including his own, carried one step further and 
anglicised it to "doom." who granted out of his vast lost domain a solid 
square mile of virgin north mississippi dirt as truly angled as the four 
corners of a cardtable top (forested then because these were the old days 
before 1833 when the stars fell and jefferson mississippi was one long 
rambling onestorey mudchinked log building housing the chickasaw agent 
and his tradingpost store) to the grandson of a scottish refugee who had

railed enclosure cluttered with shelves and pigeonholes bearing spiked 

dust-and-lintgathering gin receipts and ledgers and cottonsamples and 
rank with the blended smell of cheese and kerosene and harnessoil and the 
tremendous iron stove against which chewed tobacco had been spat for 
almost a hundred years, and up to the long high sloping counter behind 
which jason stood and, not looking again at the overalled men who had 
quietly stopped talking and even chewing when she entered, with a kind of 
fainting desperation she opened the handbag and fumbled something out 
of it and laid it open on the counter and stood trembling and breathing 
rapidly while jason looked down at it--a picture, a photograph in color 
clipped obviously from a slick magazine--a picture filled with luxury and 
money and sunlight--a cannebière backdrop of mountains and palms and 
cypresses and the sea, an open powerful expensive chromium/rimmed

      and the library was still locked all the next day too when at three oclock 
in the afternoon, footsore and spent yet still unflagging and still clasping 
the handbag tightly under her arm, she turned into a neat small yard in the 
negro residence section of memphis and mounted the steps of the neat 
small house and rang the bell and the door opened and a black woman of 
about her own age looked quietly out at her. 'it's frony, isn't it?' the 
librarian said. 'dont you remember me--melissa meek, from jefferson--'    
      'yes,' the negress said. 'come in. you want to see mama.' and she 
entered the room, the neat yet cluttered bedroom of an old negro, rank 
with the smell of old people, old women, old negroes, where the old 
woman herself sat in a rocker beside the hearth whe

already shown the picture to jason.    
      'dont you know what he said?' she cried. 'when he realised she was in 
danger, he said it was her, even if i hadn't even had a picture to show him. 
but as soon as he realised that somebody, anybody, even just me, wanted 
to save her, would try to save her, he said it wasn't. but it is! look at it!'    
      'look at my eyes,' the old negress said. 'how can i see that picture?'    
      'call frony!' the librarian cried. 'she will know her!' but already the old 
negress was folding the clipping carefully back into its old creases, handing 
it back.    
      'my eyes aint any good anymore,' she said. 'i cant see it.'

he learned to class and grade cotton, and so established his own business

brother because of their mother, sacrificing what pleasures might have 
been the right and just due and even the necessity of a thirty-year-old 
bachelor, so that his mother's life might continue as nearly as possible to 
what it had been this not because he loved her but (a sane man always) 
simply because he was afraid of the negro cook whom he could not even
