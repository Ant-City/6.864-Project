me in to dinner talked to me about his wife the whole
time.

mrs. marchmont.  how very trivial of him!

lady basildon.  terribly trivial!  what did your man talk about?

mrs. marchmont.  about myself.

lady basildon.  [_languidly_.]  and were you interested?

mrs. marchmont.  [_shaking her head_.]  not in the smallest degree.

lady basildon.  what martyrs we are, dear margaret!

mrs. marchmont.  [_rising_.]  and how well it becomes us, olivia!

[_they rise and go towards the music-room_.  _the_ vicomte de nanjac, _a
young attaché known for his neckties and his anglomania_, _approaches
with a low bow_, _and enters into conversation_.]

mason.  [_announcing guests from the top of the staircase_.]  mr. and
lady jane barford.  lord caversham.

[_enter_ lord caversham, _an old gentleman of seventy_, _wearing the
riband and star of the garter_.  _a fine whig type_.  _rather like a
portrait by lawrence_.]

lord caversham.  good evening, lady chiltern!  has my good-for-nothing
young son been here?

lady chiltern.  [_coldly_.]  i am not surprised!

mrs. cheveley.  [_in her sweetest manner_.]  do you know, i am quite
looking forward to meeting your clever husband, lady chiltern.  since he
has been at the foreign office, he has been so much talked of in vienna.
they actually succeed in spelling his name right in the newspapers.  that
in itself is fame, on the continent.

lady chiltern.  i hardly think there will be much in common between you
and my husband, mrs. cheveley!  [_moves away_.]

vicomte de nanjac.  ah! chère madame, queue surprise!  i have not seen
you since berlin!

mrs. cheveley.  not since berlin, vicomte.  five years ago!

vicomte de nanjac.  and you are younger and more beautiful than ever.
how do you manage it?

mrs. cheveley.  by making it a rule only to talk to perfectly charming
people like yourself.

vicomte de nanjac.  ah! you flatter me.  you butter me, as they say here.

mrs. cheveley.  do they say that here?  how dreadful of them!

vicomte de nanjac.  yes, they have a won

 that woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the
room with your brother?

mabel chiltern.  oh, i think lady markby brought her.  why do you ask?

lord goring.  i haven’t seen her for years, that is all.

mabel chiltern.  what an absurd reason!

lord goring.  all reasons are absurd.

mabel chiltern.  what sort of a woman is she?

lord goring.  oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!

mabel chiltern.  i dislike her already.

lord goring.  that shows your admirable good taste.

vicomte de nanjac.  [_approaching_.]  ah, the english young lady is the
dragon of good taste, is she not?  quite the dragon of good taste.

lord goring.  so the newspapers are always telling us.

vicomte de nanjac.  i read all your english newspapers.  i find them so
amusing.

lord goring.  then, my dear nanjac, you must certainly read between the
lines.

vicomte de nanjac.  i should like to, but my professor objects.  [_to_
mabel chiltern.]  may i have the pleasure of escorting you to the
music-room, mademoisel

mabel chiltern.  [_looking very disappointed_.]  delighted, vicomte,
quite delighted!  [_turning to_ lord goring.]  aren’t you coming to the
music-room?

lord goring.  not if there is any music going on, miss mabel.

mabel chiltern.  [_severely_.]  the music is in german.  you would not
understand it.

[_goes out with the_ vicomte de nanjac.  lord caversham _comes up to his
son_.]

lord caversham.  well, sir! what are you doing here?  wasting your life
as usual!  you should be in bed, sir.  you keep too late hours!  i heard
of you the other night at lady rufford’s dancing till four o’clock in the
morning!

lord goring.  only a quarter to four, father.

lord caversham.  can’t make out how you stand london society.  the thing
has gone to the dogs, a lot of damned nobodies talking about nothing.

lord goring.  i like you immensely.

mabel chiltern.  well, i wish you’d show it in a more marked way!  [_they
go downstairs_.]

mrs. marchmont.  olivia, i have a curious feeling of absolute faintness.
i think i should like some supper very much.  i know i should like some
supper.

lady basildon.  i am positively dying for supper, margaret!

mrs. marchmont.  men are so horribly selfish, they never think of these
things.

lady basildon.  men are grossly material, grossly material!

[_the_ vicomte de nanjac _enters from the music-room with some other
guests_.  _after having carefully examined all the people present_, _he
approaches_ lady basildon.]

vicomte de nanjac.  may i have the honour of taking you down to supper,
comtesse?

lady basildon.  [_coldly_.]  i never take supper, thank you, vicomte.
[_the_ vicomte _is about to retire_.  lady basildon, _seeing this_,
_rises at once and takes his arm_.]  but i will come down with you with
pleasure.

stion to be put to me on the subject.

mrs. cheveley.  thank you.  i knew we should come to an amicable
agreement.  i understood your nature from the first.  i analysed you,
though you did not adore me.  and now you can get my carriage for me, sir
robert.  i see the people coming up from supper, and englishmen always
get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.  [_exit_ sir
robert chiltern.]

[_enter guests_, lady chiltern, lady markby, lord caversham, lady
basildon, mrs. marchmont, vicomte de nanjac, mr. montford.]

lady markby.  well, dear mrs. cheveley, i hope you have enjoyed yourself.
sir robert is very entertaining, is he not?

mrs. cheveley.  most entertaining!  i have enjoyed my talk with him
immensely.

lady markby.  he has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  and he
has married a most admirable wife.  lady chiltern is a woman of the very
highest principles, i am glad to say.  i am a little too old now, myself,
to trouble about setting a good example, but i always admire p
