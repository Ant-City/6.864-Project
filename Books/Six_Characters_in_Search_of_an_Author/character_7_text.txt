e of remorse. in fact, especially then.

the father. remorse? no, that isn't true. i've done more than use words to quieten the remorse in me.

the step-daughter. yes, there was a bit of money too. yes, yes, a bit of money. there were the hundred lire he was about to offer me in payment, gentlemen . . . [sensation of horror among the actors.]

the son [to the step-daughter]. this is vile.

the step-daughter. vile? there they were in a pale blue envelope on a little mahogany table in the back of madame pace's shop. you know madame pace -- one of those ladies who attract poor girls of good family into their ateliers, under the pretext of their selling robes et manteaux.

the son. and he thinks he has bought the right to tyrannize over us all with those hundred lire he was going to pay; but which, fortunately -- note this, gentlemen -- he had no chance of paying.

the step-daughter. it was a near thing, though, you know! [laughs ironically.]

the mother [protesting]. shame, my daughter, shame!

origin. that was, anyway, the reason i married her. unpleasant all this may be, but how can it be helped? my mistake possibly, but there we are! all my life i have had these confounded aspirations towards a certain moral sanity. [at this point the step-daughter bursts into a noisy laugh.] oh, stop it! stop it! i can't stand it.

the manager. yes, please stop it, for heaven's sake.

the step-daughter. but imagine moral sanity from him, if you please -- the client of certain ateliers like that of madame pace!

the father. fool! that is the proof that i am a man! this seeming contradiction, gentlemen, is the strongest proof that i stand here a live man before you. why, it is just for this very incongruity in my nature that i have had to suffer what i have. i could not live by the side of that woman [indicating the mother.] any longer; but not so much for the boredom she inspired me with as for the pity i felt for her.

the mother. and so he turned me out -- -.

the father. -- well provided for! yes,

it is.

the manager. let's come to the point. this is only discussion.

the father. very good, sir! but a fact is like a sack which won't stand up when it is empty. in order that it may stand up, one has to put into it the reason and sentiment which have caused it to exist. i couldn't possibly know that after the death of that man, they had decided to return here, that they were in misery, and that she [pointing to the mother.] had gone to work as a modiste, and at a shop of the type of that of madame pace.

the step-daughter. a real high-class modiste, you must know, gentlemen. in appearance, she works for the leaders of the best society; but she arranges matters so that these elegant ladies serve her purpose . . . without prejudice to other ladies who are . . . well . . . only so so.

the mother. you will believe me, gentlemen, that it never entered my mind that the old hag offered me work because she had her eye on my daughter.

the step-daughter. poor mamma! do you know, sir, what that woman

did when i brought her back the work my mother had finished? she would point out to me that i had torn one of my frocks, and she would give it back to my mother to mend. it was i who paid for it, always i; while this poor creature here believed she was sacrificing herself for me and these two children here, sitting up at night sewing madame pace's robes.

the manager. and one day you met there . . .

the step-daughter. him, him. yes sir, an old client. there's a scene for you to play! superb!

the father. she, the mother arrived just then . . .

the step-daughter [treacherously]. almost in time!

the father [crying out]. no, in time! in time! fortunately i recognized her . . . in time. and i took them back home with me to my house. you can imagine now her position and mine; she, as you see her; and i who cannot look her in the face.

[to the actors and characters.] stand back -- stand back! let me see, and don't let's lose any more time! [to the step-daughter.] is it all right as it is now?

the step-daughter. well, to tell the truth, i don't recognize the scene.

the manager. my dear lady, you can't possibly suppose that we can construct that shop of madame pace piece by piece here? [to the father.] you said a white room with flowered wall paper, didn't you?

the father. yes.

the manager. well then. we've got the furniture right more or less. bring that little table a bit further forward. [the stage hands obey the order. to property man.] you go and find an envelope, if possible, a pale blue one; and give it to that gentleman. [indicates father.]

property man. an ordinary envelope?

manager and father. yes, yes, an ordinary envelope.

the manager. ready, everyone! first scene -- the young lady. [the leading lady comes forward.] no, no, you must wait. i meant her [indicating the step-daughter.] you just watch --

the step-daughter [adding at once]. how i shall play it, how i shall live it! . . .

leading lady.[offended]. i shall live it also, you may be sure, as soon as i begin!

the manager [with his hands to his head]. ladies and gentlemen, if you please! no more useless discussions! scene i: the young lady with madame pace: oh! [looks around as if lost.] and this madame pace, where is she?

the father. she isn't with us, sir.

the manager. then what the devil's to be done?

the father. but she is alive too.

the manager. yes, but where is she?

the father. one minute. let me speak! [turning to the actresses.] if these ladies would be so good as to give me their hats for a moment . . .

the actresses [half surprised, half laughing, in chorus]. what?

why?

our hats?

what does he say?

the manager. what are you go

there you are!

this is really funny.

we've got to put them on show.

the father. exactly; just like that, on show.

the manager. may we know why?

the father. i'll tell you. who knows if, by arranging the stage for her, she does not come here herself, attracted by the very articles of her trade? [inviting the actors to look towards the exit at back of stage.] look! look!

[the door at the back of stage opens and madame pace enters and takes a few steps forward. she is a fat, oldish woman with puffy oxygenated hair. she is rouged and powdered, dressed with a comical elegance in black silk. round her waist is a long silver chain from which hangs a pair of scissors. the step-daughter runs over to her at once amid the stupor of the actors.]

the step-daughter [turning towards her]. there she is! there she is!

the father [radiant]. it's she! i said so, didn't i? there she is!

l'ing√©nue. they've been holding her in reserve, i guess.

leading lady. a vulgar trick!

the father [dominating the protests]. excuse me, all of you! why are you so anxious to destroy in the name of a vulgar, commonplace sense of truth, this reality which comes to birth attracted and formed by the magic of the stage itself, which has indeed more right to live here than you, since it is much truer than you -- if you don't mind my saying so? which is the actress among you who is to play madame pace? well, here is madame pace herself. and you will allow, i fancy, that the actress who acts her will be less true than this woman here, who is herself in person. you see my daughter recognized her and went over to her at once. now you're going to witness the scene!

[but the scene between the step-daughter and madame pace has already begun despite the protest of the actors and the reply of the father. it has begun quietly, naturally, in a manner impossible for the stage. so when the actors, call

ed to attention by the father, turn round and see madame pace, who has placed one hand under the step-daughter's chin to raise her head, they observe her at first with great attention, but hearing her speak in an unintelligible manner their interest begins to wane.]

the manager. well? well?

leading man. what does she say?

leading lady. one can't hear a word.

juvenile lead. louder! louder please!

the step-daughter [leaving madame pace, who smiles a sphinx-like smile, and advancing towards the actors]. louder? louder? what are you talking about? these aren't matters which can be shouted at the top of one's voice. if i have spoken them out loud, it was to shame him and have my revenge. [indicates father.] but for madame it's quite a different matter.

the manager. indeed? indeed? but here, you know, people have got to make themselves heard, my dear. even we who are on the stage can't hear you. what will it be when the public's

 in the theatre? and anyway, you can very well speak up now among yourselves, since we shan't be present to listen to you as we are now. you've got to pretend to be alone in a room at the back of a shop where no one can hear you.

[the step-daughter coquettishly and with a touch of malice makes a sign of disagreement two or three times with her finger.]

the manager. what do you mean by no?

the step-daughter [sotto voce, mysteriously]. there's someone who will hear us if she [indicating madame pace.] speaks out loud.

the manager [in consternation]. what? have you got someone else to spring on us now? [the actors burst out laughing.]

the father. no, no sir. she is alluding to me. i've got to be here -- there behind that door, in waiting; and madame pace knows it. in fact, if you will allow me, i'll go there at once, so i can be quite ready. [moves away.]

the manager [stopping him]. no! wait! wait! we must observe the conventions of the theatre. before you are ready . . .

ter [interrupting him]. no, get on with it at once! i'm just dying, i tell you, to act this scene. if he's ready, i'm more than ready.

the manager [shouting]. but, my dear young lady, first of all, we must have the scene between you and this lady . . . [indicates madame pace.] do you understand? . . .

the step-daughter. good heavens! she's been telling me what you know already: that mamma's work is badly done again, that the material's ruined; and that if i want her to continue to help us in our misery i must be patient . . .

madame pace [coming forward with an air of great importance]. yes indeed, sir, i no wanta take advantage of her, i no wanta be hard . . .

[note. madame pace is supposed to talk in a jargon half italian, half english.]

the manager [alarmed]

the step-daughter [also laughing]. yes yes, that's the way she talks, half english, half italian! most comical it is!

madame pace. itta seem not verra polite gentlemen laugha atta me eef i trya best speaka english.

the manager. diamine! of course! of course! let her talk like that! just what we want. talk just like that, madame, if you please! the effect will be certain. exactly what was wanted to put a little comic relief into the crudity of the situation. of course she talks like that! magnificent!

the step-daughter. magnificent? certainly! when certain suggestions are made to one in language of that kind, the effect

is certain, since it seems almost a joke. one feels inclined to laugh when one hears her talk about an "old signore" "who wanta talka nicely with you." nice old signore, eh, madame?

madame pace. not so old my dear, not so old! and even if you no lika him, he won't make any scandal!

the mother [jumping up amid the amazement and consternation of the actors who had not been noticing her. they move to restrain her]. you old devil! you murderess!

the step-daughter [running over to calm her mother]. calm yourself, mother, calm yourself! please don't ...

the father [going to her also at the same time]. calm yourself! don't get excited! sit down now!

the mother. well then, take that woman

for this reason, you see: that woman there was not with us when we came . . . if they are on together, the whole thing is given away inevitably, as you see.

the manager. it doesn't matter. this is only a first rough sketch -- just to get an idea of the various points of the scene, even confusedly . . . [turning to the mother and leading her to her chair.] come along, my dear lady, sit down now, and let's get on with the scene . . .

[meanwhile, the step-daughter, coming forward again, turns to madame pace.]

the step-daughter. come on, madame, come on!

madame pace [offended]. no, no, grazie. i not do anything witha your mother present.

the step-daughter. nonsense! introduce this "old signore" who wants to talk nicely to me. [addressing the company imperiously.] we've got to do this scene one way or another, haven't we? come on! [to madame pace.] you can go!

madame pace. ah yes! i go'way! i go'way! certainly! [exits furious.]

the step-daughter [to the father]. now you make your entry. no, you

that scene, where he offers her the hat, eh?

the step-daughter. the best's coming now. why can't we go on?

the manager. have a little patience! [to the actors.] of course, it must be treated rather lightly.

leading man. still, with a bit of go in it!

leading lady. of course! it's easy enough! [to leading man.] shall you and i try it now?

leading man. why, yes! i'll prepare my entrance. [exit in order to make his entrance.]

the manager [to leading lady]. see here! the scene between you and madame pace is finished. i'll have it written out properly after. you remain here . . . oh, where are you going?

leading lady. one minute. i want to put my hat on again. [goes over to hat-rack and puts her hat on her head.]

the manager. good! you stay here with your head bowed down a bit.

the step-daughter. but she isn't dressed in black.

leading lady. but i shall be, and much more effectively than you.

the manager [to step-daughter]. be quiet please, and watch! you'll be able to learn something. [cla

 at the unrevealed interior life of each. i am willing to admit, my dear young lady, that from your point of view it would be a fine idea if each character could tell the public all his troubles in a nice monologue or a regular one hour lecture. [good humoredly.] you must restrain yourself, my dear, and in your own interest, too; because this fury of yours, this exaggerated disgust you show, may make a bad impression, you know. after you have confessed to me that there were others before him at madame pace's and more than once . . .

the step-daughter [bowing her head, impressed]. it's true. but remember those others mean him for me all the same.

the manager [not understanding]. what? the others? what do you mean?

the step-daughter. for one who has gone wrong, sir, he who was responsible for the first fault is responsible for all that follow. he is responsible for my faults, was, even before i was born. look at him, and see if it isn't true!

the manager. well, well! and does the weight of so m
