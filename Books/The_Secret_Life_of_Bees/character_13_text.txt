but no, they held a special service in the pink house, and 
people  came  to  them.  it  was  a  group  called  the  
daughters of mary, which august had organized.

the daughters of mary started showing up in the 
parlor before 10:00 a.m. first was an old woman named 
queenie  and  her  grown  daughter,  violet.  they  were 
dressed  alike in  bright yellow  skirts  and white  blouses, 
though  they  wore  different  hats,  at  least.  next  came 
lunelle,  mabelee,  and  cressie,  who  wore  the  fanciest 
hats i'd ever laid eyes on. 

it turned out lunelle was a hatmaker without the 
least bit of shyness. i'm talking about purple felt the size 
of  a  sombrero  with  fake  fruit  on  the  back.  that  was 
lunelle's. 

mabelee  wore  a  creation  of  tiger  fur  wrapped 
with gold fringe, but it was cressie who carried the day 
in a  crimson smokestack with black netting and ostrich 
feathers. 

if this was not enough, they wore clip-on earbobs 
of  various  colored

laying the bible in her chair, she said, "it's been a 
while since we've told the story  of our lady of chains, 
and since we have visitors who've never heard the story 
of our statue, i thought we'd tell it again." 

one thing i was starting to understand was that 

august loved to tell a good story.

"really,  it's  good  for  all  of  us  to  hear  it  again," 
she said. "stories have to be told or they die, and when 
they die, we can't remember who we are or why we're 
here." 

cressie  nodded,  making  the  ostrich  feathers 
wave through the air so you had the impression of a real 
bird in the room. "that's right. tell the story," she said. 

august  pulled  her  chair  close  to  the  statue  of 
black mary and sat facing us. when she began, it didn't 
sound like august talking at all but like somebody talking 
through her, someone from another time and place. all 
the  while  her  eyes  looked  off  toward  the  window,  like 
she was seeing the drama play out in the sky.

broke  them."  june  wedged  the  cello  between  her  legs 
and played "amazing grace," and the daughters of mary 
got  to  their  feet  and  swayed  together  like  colorful 
seaweed  on  the  ocean  floor.  i  thought  this  was  the 
grand  finale,  but  no,  june  switched  over  to  the  piano 
and banged out a jazzed-up version of "go tell it on the 
mountain." that's when august started a conga-line. she 
danced  over  to  lunelle,  who  latched  on  to  august's 
waist.  cressie  hooked  on  to  lunelle,  followed  by 
mabelee, and  off  they  went around the  room,  causing 
cressie to grab hold of her crimson hat. 

when  they  swung  back  by,  queenie  and  violet 
joined them, then sugar-girl.  i wanted  to be  part of it, 
too,  but  i only watched,  and  so  did rosaleen and otis. 
june seemed to play faster and faster. i fanned my face, 
trying to get a little air, feeling light-headed. when the 
dance  ended,  the  daughters  stood  panting  in  a  half 
circl

 i'd  seen 
them,  queenie  and  her  daughter,  violet,  had  on  the 
smallest hats in the group, and this time they'd left them 
off completely. i think it was because queenie hated to 
cover the whiteness of her hair, which she was proud to 
have, and violet, who had to be forty at least, couldn't 
bring herself to wear a hat if her mother wasn't wearing 
one.  if  queenie  went  into  the  kitchen  and  stuck  her 
head in the oven, violet would go stick hers in, too. 

lunelle,  mabelee,  cressie,  and  sugar-girl  each 
wore  a  black  hat,  not  as  spectacular  as  the  previous 
ones, except for lunelle's, which had both a red veil and 
a red feather. they took off the hats and lined them up 
on  the  piano  as  soon  as  they  came  in,  so  that  you  
wanted to say, what's the use? 

they got under way slicing ham, laying out fried 
chicken,  shaking  paprika  on  the  deviled  eggs.  we  had

ower,  sesame,  pumpkin,  and  pomegranate  seeds 
drizzled with honey and baked to perfection. they ate it 
by  the  handfuls,  saying  they  wouldn't  dream  of  sitting 
with  the  dead  without  eating  seeds.  seeds  kept  the 
living from despair, they explained. 

mabelee  said,  "she  looks  so  good—doesn't  she 

look good?" 

queenie snorted. "if she looks that good, maybe 
we ought to put her on display in the drive-by window at 
the funeral home." 

"oh, queenie!" cried mabelee. 
cressie noticed rosaleen and me sitting there in 
the  dark  and  said,  "the  funeral  home  in  town  has  a 
drive-by window. it used to be a bank." 

"nowadays they put the open casket right up in 
the window where we used to drive through and get our 
checks cashed," said queenie. "people can drive through 
and  pay  their  respects  without having  to get  out.  they

"you ain't serious," said rosaleen.

waiting  for  the  body  of  the  mother,  i  heard  june's 
whisper brush my ear—"i'm sorry for being hard on you 
when  you  first  got  here"—and  then  the  sweetness  of 
honey cake spread through my mouth. 

i wished it could have been zach standing next to 
me so i could lay the cake on his tongue. i would have 
said, i hope this softens you toward the world. i hope it 
brings  you  a  tender  feeling.  instead  i  got  to  give  the  
pinch of cake to cressie, who ate it with her eyes closed.

after we were all fed, zach and neil went to the 
parlor  and  returned  carrying  our  lady  of  chains.  otis 
followed  after  them,  lugging  the  pile  of  chain.  they 
stood her upright in the red wagon. august leaned over 
to me. "we're going to reenact the story of our lady of 
chains.  we're  taking  her  over  to  the  honey  house  and 
chaining her in there for the night." 

i thought,  our lady is spending the night in  the

sign of love. 

zach  and  i  had  hung  around  outside  till  the 
daughters  of  mary  finished  in  the  honey  house.  we'd 
helped them clean up the mess in the yard, me stacking 
plates and cups and zach folding up card tables. queenie 
had smiled and said, "how come you two left before we 
finished?" 

"it got too long," said zach. 
"so that's what it was," she teased, and cressie 

giggled. 

when  zach  left,  i  slipped  back  into  the  honey 
house  and  retrieved  my  mother's  photograph  and  her 
black  mary  picture 
from  underneath  my  pillow. 
clutching them in my hands, i glided past the daughters 
as they finished up the dishes in the kitchen. they called 
to me, "where're you going, lily?" 

i hated to be rude, but i found i couldn't answer, 
couldn't  speak  a  word  of  idle  talk.  i  wanted  to  know  
about my mother. i didn't care about anything el

ese  women  did  would  ever 
surprise  me  again,  but  that  lasted  about  one  second, 
because next the daughters swarmed around our  lady 
like a circle of bee attendants and rubbed the honey into 
the wood, working it into the top of her head, into her 
cheeks,  her  neck  and  shoulders  and  arms,  across  her 
breasts, her belly. 

"come  on,  lily,  and  help  us,"  said  mabelee. 
rosaleen had already dived in and was coating honey all 
over our lady's thighs. 

i  hung  back,  but  cressie  took  my  hands  and 
dragged  me  over  to  mary,  slapped  them  down  in  the 
muck of sun-warmed honey, right on top of our lady's 
red heart. 

i  remembered  how  i'd  visited  our  lady  in  the 
middle  of  the  night,  how  i'd  placed  my  hand  on  that 
same spot. you are my mother, i'd told her then. you are 
the mother of thousands. 

"i don't get why we're doing this," i said. 
"we  always  bathe  her  in  honey,"  said  cressie.  

"every year." 

"but how come?"

it  was  pride  now,  all  pride.  how  could  he  back

the  front  door  opened,  and  queenie,  violet, 
lunelle,  and  mabelee  stumbled  into  the  house,  all 
wound  up  and  looking  like  they  had  their  clothes  on 
backward. queenie stared at my cheek. 

"everybody all right?" she said, out of breath. 
"we're all right," said august. "this is mr. owens, 

lily's father. he came for a visit."

us,  clutching their  pocketbooks  up against their  bodies 
like they might have to use them to beat the living hell 
out of somebody.

women—mabelee four foot ten, lunelle's hair standing 
straight  up  on  her  head  begging  to  be  braided,  violet 
muttering,  "blessed  mary,"  and  queenie—tough  old 
queenie—with her hands on her hips and her lip shoved

ge.  i  watch  them 
now from my upstairs room, the room june left behind 
when  she  got  married  last  month.  i  could  not  have 
dreamed such a room. august bought me a new bed and 
a dressing table, white french provincial from the sears 
and  roebuck  catalog.  violet  and  queenie  donated  a 
flowered rug that had been laying around in their extra 
room  going  to  waste,  and  mabelee  sewed  blue-and-
white  polka  dot  curtains  for  the  windows  with  fringe 
balls along the hem. cressie crocheted four eight-legged 
octopuses out of various colors of yarn to sit on the bed. 
one  octopus  would  have  been  enough  for  me,  but  it's 
the only handicraft cressie knows how to do, so she just 
keeps doing it. 

lunelle created me a hat that outdid every other 
hat  she'd  ever  made,  including  june's  wedding  hat.  it 
reminds me a little of the pope's hat. it is tall, just goes 
up  into  the  air  and  keeps  going.  it  does  have  more  
roundness  than  the  pope's  hat,
