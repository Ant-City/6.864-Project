[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is a perfect match for her husband, pelayo, being equally ordinary and concerned with practical matters. if anything, [CHARACTER] is the more practical of the two because she suggests charging admission to see the "angel." despite the many material advantages the old man brings, [CHARACTER]'s attitude toward him is primarily one of annoyance and exasperation. once the old man's usefulness as a roadside attraction dwindles, [CHARACTER] sees him only as a nuisance. indeed, the old man becomes so troublesome to her that she even refers to her new home--purchased with proceeds from exhibiting the old man--as a "hell full of angels." the old man becomes so ordinary in [CHARACTER]'s eyes that it isn't until he finally flies away that she seems to see him for the wonder he is. [CHARACTER] watches him fly away with wistfulness, as if finally realizing that something extraordinary has left her life forever.
