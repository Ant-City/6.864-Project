ass pride, a new sense of “selfesteem,”
and thus she is “grateful” to porter (201). sending out contradictory
messages, the narrative presents porter as a gentle lover and potential rescuer
of corinthians but also as a killer. and even as it seems intent on humanizing
porter and thus counteracting the initial shaming and racist representation of
him as a “wild man in the attic,” it also reminds readers that he is the “same 
shame, trauma, and race in the novels of toni morrison 73
henry porter” who had “screamed, wept, waved a shotgun, and urinated over
the heads of the women in the yard” (28, 199).

corinthians another option via her sister. when milkman attempts to prevent
corinthians from dating henry porter, lena comes to her rescue. lena
practically attacks milkman on her sister’s behalf, questioning, “where do
you get the right to decide our lives?” (song 215). she then assaults milkman’s
own sexuality by referring to his penis as a “little hog’s gut,” and tells him
that he has “pissed” his “last in this house,” meaning, of course, that he can
