Charles - 
                	A
professional wrestler in Duke Frederick's court. Charles demonstrates
both his caring nature and his political savvy when he asks Oliver
to intercede in his upcoming fight with Orlando: he does not want
to injure the young man and thereby lose favor among the nobles
who support him. Charles's concern for Orlando proves unwarranted
when Orlando beats 
him senseless.
