The Dauphin  - 
                The
son of the king of France and heir to the throne (until Henry takes
this privilege from him). The Dauphin is a headstrong and overconfident
young man, more inclined to mock the English than to make preparations
to fight them. He also mocks Henry, making frequent mention of the
king's irresponsible youth.
