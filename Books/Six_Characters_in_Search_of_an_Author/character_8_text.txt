gifts or to be able to work wonders. who was sancho panza? who was don abbondio? yet they live eternally because -- live germs as they were -- they had the fortune to find a fecundating matrix, a fantasy which could raise and nourish them: make them live for ever!

the manager. that is quite all right. but what do you want here, all of you?

the father. we want to live.

the manager [ironically]. for eternity?

the father. no, sir, only for a moment . . . in you.

an actor. just listen to him!

leading lady. they want to live, in us . . ..

juvenile lead [pointing to the step-daughter]. i've no objection, as far as that one is concerned!

the father. look here! look here! the comedy has to be made. [to the manager.] but if you and your actors are willing, we can soon concert it among ourselves.

the manager [annoyed]. but what do you want to concert? we don't go in for concerts here. here we play dramas and comedies!

the father. exactly! that is just why we have come to you.

the manager. and whe

the mother. leave the poor boy alone. why do you want to make me appear ungrateful, daughter? i don't want to offend your father. i have answered him that i didn't abandon my house and my son through any fault of mine, nor from any wilful passion.

the father. it is true. it was my doing.

leading man [to the company]. what a spectacle!

leading lady. we are the audience this time.

juvenile lead. for once, in a way.

the manager [beginning to get really interested]. let's hear them out. listen!

the son. oh yes, you're going to hear a fine bit now. he will talk to you of the demon of experiment.

the father. you are a cynical imbecile. i've told you so already a hundred times. [to the manager.] he tries to make fun of me on account of this expression which i have found to excuse myself with.

the son [with disgust]. yes, phrases! phrases!

the step-daughter. yes, but ask him how his intelligence has helped us.

the father. if we could see all the evil that may spring from good, what should we do? [at this point the leading lady who is biting her lips with rage at seeing the leading man flirting with the step-daughter, comes forward and says to the manager.]

leading lady. excuse me, but are we going to rehearse today?

manager. of course, of course; but let's hear them out.

juvenile lead. this is something quite new.

l'ingénue. most interesting!

leading lady. yes, for the people who like that kind of thing. [casts a glance at leading man.]

the manager [to father]. you must please explain yourself quite clearly. [

the manager. yes, yes. come on! come on! [moves away and then turning to the actors.] be punctual, please! [manager and the six characters cross the stage and go off. the other actors remain, looking at one another in astonishment.]

leading man. is he serious? what the devil does be want to do?

juvenile lead. this is rank madness.

third actor. does he expect to knock up a drama in five minutes?

juvenile lead. like the improvisers!

leading lady. if he thinks i'm going to take part in a joke like this . . .

juvenile lead. i'm out of it anyway.

fourth actor. i should like to know who they are.. [alludes to characters].

third actor. what do you suppose? madmen or rascals!

juvenile lead. and he takes them seriously!

l'ingénue. vanity! he fancies himself as an author now.

leading man. it's absolutely unheard of. if the stage has come to this . . . well i'm . . .

fifth actor. it's rather a joke.

third actor. well, we'll see what's

the manager. good! [turning to a stage hand.] go and get some paper from my office, plenty, as much as you can find. [the stage hand goes off, and soon returns with a handful of paper which he gives to the prompter.]

the manager [to prompter]. you follow the scenes as we play them, and try and get the points down, at any rate the most important ones. [then addressing the actors.] clear the stage, ladies and gentlemen! come over here [pointing to the left.] and listen attentively.

leading lady. but, excuse me, we . . .

the manager [guessing her thought]. don't worry! you won't have to improvise.

leading man. what have we to do then?

the manager. nothing. for the moment you just watch and listen. everybody will get his part written out afterwards. at present we're going to try the thing as best we can. they're going to act now.

the father [as if fallen from the clouds into the confusion of the stage]. we? what do you mean, if you please, by a rehearsal?

the manager. a rehearsal f

the manager. don't you worry about it. it'll be our job to find the right tones. and as for her name, if you want her amalia, amalia it shall be; and if you don't like it, we'll find another! for the moment though, we'll call the characters in this way: [to juvenile lead.] you are the son. [to the leading lady.] you naturally are the step-daughter . . .

the step-daughter [excitedly]. what? what? i, that woman there? [bursts out laughing.]

the manager [angry]. what is there to laugh at?

leading lady.[indignant]. nobody has ever dared to laugh at me. i insist on being treated with respect; otherwise i go away.

the step-daughter. no, no, excuse me . . . i am not laughing at you . . .

the manager [to step-daughter]. you ought to feel honored to be played by . . .

leading lady.[at once, contemptuous

the father. yes.

the manager. well then. we've got the furniture right more or less. bring that little table a bit further forward. [the stage hands obey the order. to property man.] you go and find an envelope, if possible, a pale blue one; and give it to that gentleman. [indicates father.]

property man. an ordinary envelope?

manager and father. yes, yes, an ordinary envelope.

property man. at once, sir. [exit.]

the manager. ready, everyone! first scene -- the young lady. [the leading lady comes forward.] no, no, you must wait. i meant her [indicating the step-daughter.] you just watch --

the step-daughter [adding at once]. how i shall play it, how i shall live it! . . .

leading lady.[offended]. i shall live it also, you may be sure, as soon as i begin!

the step-daughter [turning towards her]. there she is! there she is!

the father [radiant]. it's she! i said so, didn't i? there she is!

the manager [conquering his surprise, and then becoming indignant]. what sort of a trick is this?

leading man [almost at the same time]. what's going to happen next?

juvenile lead. where does she come from?

l'ingénue. they've been holding her in reserve, i guess.

leading lady. a vulgar trick!

the father [dominating the protests]. excuse me, all of you! why are you so anxious to destroy in the name of a vulgar, commonplace sense of truth, this reality which comes to birth attracted and formed by the magic of the stage itself, which has indeed more right to live here than you, since it is much truer than you -- if you don't mind my saying so? which is the actress among you who is to play madame pace? well, here is madame pace herself. and you will allow, i fancy, tha

the manager. well? well?

leading man. what does she say?

leading lady. one can't hear a word.

juvenile lead. louder! louder please!

the step-daughter [leaving madame pace, who smiles a sphinx-like smile, and advancing towards the actors]. louder? louder? what are you talking about? these aren't matters which can be shouted at the top of one's voice. if i have spoken them out loud, it was to shame him and have my revenge.

the step-daughter. the best's coming now. why can't we go on?

the manager. have a little patience! [to the actors.] of course, it must be treated rather lightly.

leading man. still, with a bit of go in it!

leading lady. of course! it's easy enough! [to leading man.] shall you and i try it now?

leading man. why, yes! i'll prepare my entrance. [exit in order to make his entrance.]

the manager [to leading lady]. see here! the scene between you and madame pace is finished. i'll have it written out properly after. you remain here . . . oh, where are you going?

leading lady. one minute. i want to put my hat on again. [goes over to hat-rack and puts her hat on her head.]

the father. yes, yes, the manner, the tone . . .

the manager. good, but not quite so heavily. like this. [acts himself.] "this isn't the first time that you have come here" . . . [to leading lady.] and you say: "no, sir."

leading lady. no, sir.

leading man. you've been here before, more than once.

the manager. no, no, stop! let her nod "yes" first. "you've been here before, eh?" [the leading lady lifts up her head slightly and closes her eyes as though in disgust. then she inclines her head twice.]

the step-daughter [unable to contain herself]. oh my god! [puts a hand to her mouth to prevent herself from laughing.]

the manager [turning round]. what's the matter?

leading man. you've been here before, eh? well then, there's no need to be so shy, is there? may i take off your hat?

[the leading man says this last speech in such a tone and with such gestures that the step-daughter, though she has her hand to her mouth, cannot keep from laughing.]

leading lady. [indignant]. i'm not going to stop here to be made a fool of by that woman there.

leading man. neither am i! l'm through with it!

the manager.. why not?

the step-daughter. because he [indicates the son again.] is always shut up alone in his room. and then there's all the part of that poor dazed-looking boy there which takes place indoors.

the manager. maybe! on the other hand, you will understand -- we can't change scenes three or four times in one act.

the leading man. they used to once.

the manager. yes, when the public was up to the level of that child there.

the leading lady. it makes the illusion easier.

the father [irritated]. the illusion! for heaven's sake, don't say illusion. please don't use that word, which is particularly painful for us..

the manager [astounded]. and why, if you please?

the father. it's painful, cruel, really cruel; and you ought to understand that.

the manager. but why? what ought we to say then? the illusion, i tell you, sir, which we've got to create for the audience . . .

the leading man. with our acting.

the manager. the illusion

 of a reality.

the father. i understand; but you, perhaps, do not understand us. forgive me! you see . . . here for you and your actors, the thing is only -- and rightly so . . . a kind of game ...

the leading lady [interrupting indignantly]. a game! we're not children here, if you please! we are serious actors.

the father. i don't deny it. what i mean is the game, or play, of your art, which has to give, as the gentleman says, a perfect illusion of reality.

the manager. precisely -- !

the father. now, if you consider the fact that we [indicates himself and the other five characters.], as we are, have no other reality outside of this illusion . . .

the manager [annoyed]. but we've had all this over once before. do you want to begin again?

the father. no, no! that wasn't my meaning! in fact, i should like to request you to abandon this game of art [looking at the leading lady as if anticipating her.] which you are accustomed to play here with your actors, and to ask you seriously once again: who are you?

the manager [astonished and irritated, turning to his actors]. if this fellow here hasn't got a nerve! a man who calls himself a character comes and asks me who i am!

the father [with dignity, but not offended]. a character, sir, may always ask a man who he is. because a character has really a life of his own, marked with his especial characteristics; for which re
