  king john. hubert, away with him; imprison him;
    and on that day at noon whereon he says
    i shall yield up my crown let him be hang'd.
    deliver him to safety; and return,
    for i must use thee.

    o my gentle cousin,
    hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arriv'd?
  bastard. the french, my lord; men's mouths are full of it;
    besides, i met lord bigot and lord salisbury,
    with eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
    and others more, going to seek the grave
    of arthur, whom they say is kill'd to-night
    on your suggestion.
  king john. gentle kinsman, go
    and thrust thyself into their companies.
    i have a way to will their loves again;
    bring them before me.
  bastard. i will seek them out.
  king john. nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
    o, let me have no subject enemies
    when adverse foreigners af

 be pitiful and hurt me not!
    there's few or none do know me; if they did,
    this ship-boy's semblance hath disguis'd me quite.
    i am afraid; and yet i'll venture it.
    if i get down and do not break my limbs,
    i'll find a thousand shifts to get away.
    as good to die and go, as die and stay.              [leaps

    o me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones.
    heaven take my soul, and england keep my bones!

  salisbury. lords, i will meet him at saint edmundsbury;
    it is our safety, and we must embrace
    this gentle offer of the perilous time.
  pembroke. who brought that letter from the cardinal?
  salisbury. the count melun, a noble lord of france,
    whose private with me of the dauphin's love
    is much more general than these lines import.
  bigot. to-morrow morning let us meet him then.
  salisbury. or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
    two long days' journey, lord

ers, reason now.
  bastard. but there is little reason in your grief;
    therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
  pembroke. sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
  bastard. 'tis true-to hurt his master, no man else.
  salisbury. this is the prison. what is he lies here?
  pembroke. o death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
    the earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
  salisbury. murder, as hating what himself hath done,
    doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
  bigot. or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
    found it too precious-princely for a grave.
  salisbury. sir richard, what think you? have you beheld,
    or have you read or heard, or could you think?
    or do you almost think, although you see,
    that you do see? could thought, without this object,
    form such another? this is the very top,
    the height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
    of murder's arms; this is the bloodiest shame,
    the wildest savagery, the vilest

  it is the shameful work of hubert's hand;
    the practice and the purpose of the king;
    from whose obedience i forbid my soul
    kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
    and breathing to his breathless excellence
    the incense of a vow, a holy vow,
    never to taste the pleasures of the world,
    never to be infected with delight,
    nor conversant with ease and idleness,
    till i have set a glory to this hand
    by giving it the worship of revenge.
  pembroke. and bigot. our souls religiously confirm thy words.

                     enter hubert

  hubert. lords, i am hot with haste in seeking you.
    arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.
  salisbury. o, he is bold, and blushes not at death!
    avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
  hubert. i am no villain.
  salisbury. must i rob the law?                  [drawing his
sword]
  bastard. your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
  salisbury. not till i sheathe it in a murderer's

  hubert. stand back, lord salisbury, stand back, i say;
    by heaven, i think my sword's as sharp as yours.
    i would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
    nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
    lest i, by marking of your rage, forget
    your worth, your greatness and nobility.
  bigot. out, dunghill! dar'st thou brave a nobleman?
  hubert. not for my life; but yet i dare defend
    my innocent life against an emperor.
  salisbury. thou art a murderer.
  hubert. do not prove me so.
    yet i am none. whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
    not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
  pembroke. cut him to pieces.
  bastard. keep the peace, i say.
  salisbury. stand by, or i shall gall you, faulconbridge.
  bastard. thou wert better gall the devil, salisbury.

 thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
    or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
    i'll strike thee dead. put up thy sword betime;
    or i'll so maul you and your toasting-iron
    that you shall think the devil is come from hell.
  bigot. what wilt thou do, renowned faulconbridge?
    second a villain and a murderer?
  hubert. lord bigot, i am none.
  bigot. who kill'd this prince?
  hubert. 'tis not an hour since i left him well.
    i honour'd him, i lov'd him, and will weep
    my date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
  salisbury. trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
    for villainy is not without such rheum;
    and he, long traded in it, makes it seem
    like rivers of remorse and innocency.
    away with me, all you whose souls abhor
    th' uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;

    beyond the infinite and boundless reach
    of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,

    perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
    or, if he do, let it at least be said
    they saw we had a purpose of defence.
  king john. have thou the ordering of this present time.

  prince henry. it is too late; the life of all his blood
    is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain.
    which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
    doth by the idle comments that it makes
    foretell the ending of mortality.

  pembroke. his highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
    that, being brought into the open air,
    it would allay the burning quality
    of that fell poison which assaileth him.

    leaves them invisible, and his siege is now

    confound themselves. 'tis strange that death should s
