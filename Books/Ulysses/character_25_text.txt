 iâ€™m greatly mistaken. what do you think, martin?

â€”it struck me too, martin cunningham said.

mr bloom set his thigh down. glad i took that bath. feel my feet quite
clean. but i wish mrs fleming had darned these socks better.

mr dedalus sighed resignedly.

â€”after all, he said, itâ€™s the most natural thing in the world.

â€”did tom kernan turn up? martin cunningham asked, twirling the peak of
his beard gently.

â€”yes, mr bloom answered. heâ€™s behind with ned lambert and hynes.

â€”and corny kelleher himself? mr power asked.

â€”at the cemetery, martin cunningham said.

â€”i met mâ€™coy this morning, mr bloom said. he said heâ€™d try to come.

the carriage halted short.

â€”whatâ€™s wrong?

â€”weâ€™re stopped.

â€”where are we?

mr bloom put his head out of the window.

â€”the grand canal, he said.

he followed his companions. mr kernan and ned lambert followed, hynes
walking after them. corny kelleher stood by the opened hearse and took
out the two wreaths. he handed one to the boy.

where is that childâ€™s funeral disappeared to?

a team of horses passed from finglas with toiling plodding tread,
dragging through the funereal silence a creaking waggon on which lay a
granite block. the waggoner marching at their head saluted.

martin cunningham whispered:

â€”i was in mortal agony with you talking of suicide before bloom.

into the chapel. which end is his head?

after a moment he followed the others in, blinking in the screened
light. the coffin lay on its bier before the chancel, four tall yellow
candles at its corners. always in front of us. corny kelleher, laying a
wreath at each fore corner, beckoned to the boy to kneel. the mourners
knelt here and there in prayingdesks. mr bloom stood behind near the
font and, when all had knelt, dropped carefully his unfolded newspaper
from his pocket and knelt his right knee upon it. he fitted his black
hat gently on his left knee and, holding its brim, bent over piously.

a server bearing a brass bucket with something in it came out through a
door. the whitesmocked priest came after him, tidying his stole w

the priest closed his book and went off, followed by the server. corny
kelleher opened the sidedoors and the gravediggers came in, hoisted the
coffin again, carried it out and shoved it on their cart. corny kelleher
gave one wreath to the boy and one to the brother-in-law. all followed
them out of the sidedoors into the mild grey air. mr bloom came last
folding his paper again into his pocket. he gazed gravely at the ground
till the coffincart wheeled off to the left. the metal wheels ground the
gravel with a sharp grating cry and the pack of blunt boots followed the
trundled barrow along a lane of sepulchres.

breaking down, he began to weep to himself quietly, stumbling a little
in his walk. mr power took his arm.

â€”sheâ€™s better where she is, he said kindly.

â€”i suppose so, mr dedalus said with a weak gasp. i suppose she is in
heaven if there is a heaven.

corny kelleher stepped aside from his rank and allowed the mourners to
plod by.

â€”sad occasions, mr kernan began politely.

mr bloom closed his eyes and sadly twice bowed his head.

â€”the others are putting on their hats, mr kernan said. i suppose we can
do so too. we are the last. this cemetery is a treacherous place.

they covered their heads.

â€”the reverend gentleman read the service too quickly, donâ€™t you think?
mr kernan said with reproof.

mr bloom nodded gravely looking in the quick bloodshot ey

traipsing about in the fog they found the grave sure enough. one of the
drunks spelt out the name: terence mulcahy. the other drunk was blinking
up at a statue of our saviour the widow had got put up.

the caretaker blinked up at one of the sepulchres they passed. he
resumed:

â€”and, after blinking up at the sacred figure, not a bloody bit like the
man, says he. thatâ€™s not mulcahy, says he, whoever done it.

rewarded by smiles he fell back and spoke with corny kelleher, accepting
the dockets given him, turning them over and scanning them as he walked.

â€”thatâ€™s all done with a purpose, martin cunningham explained to hynes.

â€”i know, hynes said. i know that.

â€”to cheer a fellow up, martin cunningham said. itâ€™s pure
goodheartedness: damn the thing else.

the caretaker put the papers in his pocket. the barrow had ceased to
trundle. the mourners split and moved to each side of the hole, stepping
with care round the graves. the gravediggers bore the coffin and set its
nose on the brink, looping the bands round it.

a flushed young man came from a gap of a hedge and after him came a

his cap abruptly: the young woman abruptly bent and with slow care
detached from her light skirt a clinging twig.

father conmee blessed both gravely and turned a thin page of his
breviary. sin: principes persecuti sunt me gratis: et a verbis tuis

corny kelleher closed his long daybook and glanced with his drooping eye
at a pine coffinlid sentried in a corner. he pulled himself erect,
went to it and, spinning it on its axle, viewed its shape and brass
furnishings. chewing his blade of hay he laid the coffinlid by and came
to the doorway. there he tilted his hatbrim to give shade to his eyes
and leaned against the doorcase, looking idly out.

corny kelleher sped a silent jet of hayjuice arching from his mouth
while a generous white arm from a window in eccles street flung forth a
coin.

young fellows of his age particularly if they had acquired drinking
