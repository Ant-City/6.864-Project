was not borne in upon him.

"what?" he asked.

"where yeh hit?" repeated the tattered man.

"why," began the youth, "i--i--that is--why--i--"

he turned away suddenly and slid through the crowd. his brow was heavily flushed, and his fingers were picking nervously at one of his buttons. he bent his head and fastened his eyes studiously upon the button as if it were a little problem.

the tattered man looked after him in astonishment.




chapter 9

the youth fell back in the procession until the tattered soldier was not in sight. then he started to walk on with the others.

but he was amid wounds. the mob of men was bleeding. because of the tattered soldier's question he now felt that his shame could be viewed. he was continually casting sidelong glances to see if the men were contemplating the letters of guilt he felt burned into his brow.

at times he regarded the wounded soldiers in an envious way. he conceived persons with torn bodies to be peculiarly happy. he wished that he, too, had a wound, a r

alking specter of a soldier. he went stonily forward. the youth wished his friend to lean upon him, but the other always shook his head and strangely protested. "no--no--no--leave me be--leave me be--"

his look was fixed again upon the unknown. he moved with mysterious purpose, and all of the youth's offers he brushed aside. "no--no--leave me be--leave me be--"

the youth had to follow.

presently the latter heard a voice talking softly near his shoulder. turning he saw that it belonged to the tattered soldier. "ye'd better take 'im outa th' road, pardner. there's a batt'ry comin' helitywhoop down th' road an' he 'll git runned over. he 's a goner anyhow in about five minutes--yeh kin see that. ye 'd better take 'im outa th' road. where th' blazes does hi git his stren'th from?"

"lord knows!" cried the youth. he was shaking his hands helplessly.

he ran forward presently and grasped the tall soldier by the arm. "jim! jim!" he coaxed, "come with me."

the tall soldier weakly tried to wrench himself f

outh, aghast and filled with wonder at the tall soldier, began quaveringly to question him. "where yeh goin', jim? what you thinking about? where you going? tell me, won't you, jim?"

the tall soldier faced about as upon relentless pursuers. in his eyes there was a great appeal. "leave me be, can't yeh? leave me be for a minnit."

the youth recoiled. "why, jim," he said, in a dazed way, "what 's the matter with you?"

the tall soldier turned and, lurching dangerously, went on. the youth and the tattered soldier followed, sneaking as if whipped, feeling unable to face the stricken man if he should again confront them. they began to have thoughts of a solemn ceremony. there was something rite-like in these movements of the doomed soldier. and there was a resemblance in him to a devotee of a mad religion, blood-sucking, muscle-wrenching, bone-crushing. they were awed and afraid. they hung back lest he have at command a dreadful weapon.

at last, they saw him stop and stand motionless. hastening up, they

 slowly enveloped him. for a moment the tremor of his legs caused him to dance a sort of hideous hornpipe. his arms beat wildly about his head in expression of implike enthusiasm.

his tall figure stretched itself to its full height. there was a slight rending sound. then it began to swing forward, slow and straight, in the manner of a falling tree. a swift muscular contortion made the left shoulder strike the ground first.

the body seemed to bounce a little way from the earth. "god!" said the tattered soldier.

the youth had watched, spellbound, this ceremony at the place of meeting. his face had been twisted into an expression of every agony he had imagined for his friend.

he now sprang to his feet and, going closer, gazed upon the pastelike face. the mouth was open and the teeth showed in a laugh.

as the flap of the blue jacket fell away from the body, he could see that the side looked as if it had been chewed by wolves.

the youth turned, with sudden, livid rage, toward the battlefield. he shoo

ead in the tomb of his mouth. he threw himself again upon the ground and began to brood.

the tattered man stood musing.

"look-a-here, pardner," he said, after a time. he regarded the corpse as he spoke. "he 's up an' gone, ain't 'e, an' we might as well begin t' look out fer ol' number one. this here thing is all over. he 's up an' gone, ain't 'e? an' he 's all right here. nobody won't bother 'im. an' i must say i ain't enjoying any great health m'self these days."

the youth, awakened by the tattered soldier's tone, looked quickly up. he saw that he was swinging uncertainly on his legs and that his face had turned to a shade of blue.

"good lord!" he cried, "you ain't goin' t'--not you, too."

the tattered man waved his hand. "nary die," he said. "all i want is some pea soup an' a good bed. some pea soup," he repeated dreamfully.

the youth arose from the ground. "i wonder where he came from. i left him over there." he pointed. "and now i find 'im here. and he was coming from over there, too." he i

ommencin' t' feel pretty damn' bad."

the youth groaned. "oh lord!" he wondered if he was to be the tortured witness of another grim encounter.

but his companion waved his hand reassuringly. "oh, i'm not goin' t' die yit! there too much dependin' on me fer me t' die yit. no, sir! nary die! i can't! ye'd oughta see th' swad a' chil'ren i've got, an' all like that."

the youth glancing at his companion could see by the shadow of a smile that he was making some kind of fun.

as the plodded on the tattered soldier continued to talk. "besides, if i died, i wouldn't die th' way that feller did. that was th' funniest thing. i'd jest flop down, i would. i never seen a feller die th' way that feller did.

"yeh know tom jamison, he lives next door t' me up home. he's a nice feller, he is, an' we was allus good friends. smart, too. smart as a steel trap. well, when we was a-fightin' this atternoon, all-of-a-sudden he begin t' rip up an' cuss an' beller at me.

ch these things. he spent delightful minutes viewing the gilded images of memory.

he saw that he was good. he recalled with a thrill of joy the respectful comments of his fellows upon his conduct.

nevertheless, the ghost of his flight from the first engagement appeared to him and danced. there were small shoutings in his brain about these matters. for a moment he blushed, and the light of his soul flickered with shame.

a specter of reproach came to him. there loomed the dogging memory of the tattered soldier--he who, gored by bullets and faint of blood, had fretted concerning an imagined wound in another; he who had loaned his last of strength and intellect for the tall soldier; he who, blind with weariness and pain, had been deserted in the field.

for an instant a wretched chill of sweat was upon him at the thought that he might be detected in the thing. as he stood persistently before his vision, he gave vent to a cry of sharp irritation and agony.

his friend turned. "what's the matter, henry?"

"didn't i tell yeh we'd come aroun' in behint 'em? didn't i tell yeh so? we--"

"oh, shet yeh mouth!"

for a time this pursuing recollection of the tattered man took all elation from the youth's veins. he saw his vivid error, and he was afraid that it would stand before him all his life. he took no share in the chatter of his comrades, nor did he look at them or know them, save when he felt sudden suspicion that they were seeing his thoughts and scrutinizing each detail of the scene with the tattered soldier.

yet gradually he mustered force to put the sin at a distance. and at last his eyes seemed to open to some new ways. he found that he could look back upon the brass and bombast of his earlier gospels and see them truly. he was gleeful when he discovered that he now despised them.

with this conviction came a store of assurance. he felt a quiet manhood, nonassertive but of sturdy and strong blood. he knew that he would no more quail before his guides wherever they should point. he had been to t
