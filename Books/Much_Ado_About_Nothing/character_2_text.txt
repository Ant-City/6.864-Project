   leon. a victorie is twice it selfe, when the atchieuer
brings home full numbers: i finde heere, that don peter
hath bestowed much honor on a yong florentine, called
claudio

   mess. much deseru'd on his part, and equally remembred
by don pedro, he hath borne himselfe beyond the
promise of his age, doing in the figure of a lambe, the
feats of a lion, he hath indeede better bettred expectation,
then you must expect of me to tell you how
