Antonio - 
                	A
man who rescues Sebastian after his shipwreck. Antonio has become
very fond of Sebastian, caring for him, accompanying him to Illyria,
and furnishing him with money--all because of a love so strong that
it seems to be romantic in nature. Antonio's attraction to Sebastian,
however, never bears fruit. Despite the ambiguous and shifting gender
roles in the play, Twelfth Night remains a romantic comedy in which
the characters are destined for marriage. In such a world, homoerotic
attraction cannot be fulfilled.
