[CHARACTER]
the commander of the russian forces against napoleon,
kutuzov is old, fat, and one-eyed--hardly the archetypal image of
military leadership. yet kutuzov is a brilliant strategist as well
as a practiced philosopher of human nature, and tolstoy's respect
for him is greater than for any other government functionary among
the french or russians--greater even than his respect for the somewhat oblivious
tsar alexander. kutuzov is humble and spiritual, in sharp contrast
to the vain and self-absorbed napoleon with his cold use of logic.
after the battle of borodino, kutuzov stops at a church procession
and kneels in gratitude to a holy icon, demonstrating a humility
of which napoleon certainly would be incapable. kutuzov is motivated
by personal belief rather than the desire for acceptance, which
makes his final fall from grace only a minor tragedy for him. whereas
napoleon is always convinced of being absolutely right, kutuzov
is more realistic and wary about the state of things. he hesitates
to declare a russian victory at borodino despite the obvious advantages
of doing so, partly because the experiences of his long career have
proved that reality is always more complex than one initially thinks.
such awareness of the mysteries of existence win kutuzov our--and
tolstoy's--approval.
