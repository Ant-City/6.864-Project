diver was already carrying a tent and a beach umbrella up
to a waiting car, so she went into the water to wash off the
sweat. he came back and gathering up a rake, a shovel, and
a sieve, stowed them in a crevice of a rock. he glanced up
and down the beach to see if he had left anything.
â€˜do you know what time it is?â€™ rosemary asked.
â€˜itâ€™s about half-past one.â€™
they faced the seascape together momentarily.
â€˜itâ€™s not a bad time,â€™ said dick diver. â€˜itâ€™s not one of worst
times of the day.â€™

he looked at her and for a moment she lived in the bright
blue worlds of his eyes, eagerly and confidently. then he
shouldered his last piece of junk and went up to his car, and
rosemary came out of the water, shook out her peignoir and
walked up to the hotel.

the matter was solved for her. the mckiscos were not yet
there and she had scarcely spread her peignoir when two
menâ€”the man with the jockey cap and the tall blonde man,
given to sawing waiters in twoâ€” left the group and came
down toward her.
â€˜good morning,â€™ said dick diver. he broke down.
â€˜lookâ€”sunburn or no sunburn, why did you stay away yesterday?
we worried about you.â€™
she sat up and her happy little laugh welcomed their intrusion.
â€˜we wondered,â€™ dick diver said, â€˜if you wouldnâ€™t come
over this morning. we go in, we take food and drink, so itâ€™s
a substantial invitation.â€™

these three were different. barban was less civilized,
more skeptical and scoffing, his manners were formal, even
perfunctory. abe north had, under his shyness, a desperate
humor that amused but puzzled her. her serious nature distrusted
its ability to make a supreme impression on him.

admired him. his complexion was reddish and weatherburned,
so was his short hairâ€”a light growth of it rolled
down his arms and hands. his eyes were of a bright, hard

â€˜yesâ€”well they were having words and she tossed some

her face in the sand. we wereâ€”electrified. i wanted dick to

â€˜i think,â€™ said dick diver, staring down abstractedly at
the straw mat, â€˜that iâ€™ll go over and invite them to dinner.â€™
â€˜no, you wonâ€™t,â€™ nicole told him quickly.
â€˜i think it would be a very good thing. theyâ€™re hereâ€”letâ€™s

â€˜weâ€™re very well adjusted,â€™ she insisted, laughing. â€˜iâ€™m not

 intensity out of proportion to their importance,
generating a really extraordinary virtuosity with
people. save among a few of the tough-minded and perennially
suspicious, he had the power of arousing a fascinated
and uncritical love. the reaction came when he realized the
waste and extravagance involved. he sometimes looked
back with awe at the carnivals of affection he had given, as a
general might gaze upon a massacre he had ordered to satisfy
an impersonal blood lust.
but to be included in dick diverâ€™s world for a while was a
remarkable experience: people believed he made special reservations
about them, recognizing the proud uniqueness of
their destinies, buried under the compromises of how many
years. he won everyone quickly with an exquisite consideration
and a politeness that moved so fast and intuitively that

rosemary, saying with a lightness seeming to conceal a paternal
interest, â€˜iâ€™m going to save your reasonâ€”iâ€™m going to
give you a hat to wear on the beach.â€™
he turned them from the garden to the terrace, where he
poured a cocktail. earl brady arrived, discovering rosemary
with surprise. his manner was softer than at the studio, as if
his differentness had been put on at the gate, and rosemary,
comparing him instantly with dick diver, swung sharply
toward the latter. in comparison earl brady seemed faintly
gross, faintly ill-bred; once more, though, she felt an electric
response to his person.
he spoke familiarly to the children who were getting up
from their outdoor supper.
â€˜hello, lanier, how about a song? will you and topsy

â€˜what shall we sing?â€™ agreed the little boy, with the
odd chanting accent of american children brought up in

she felt far from him. the undertone of his words repelled
her and she withdrew her adoration for the divers
from the profanity of his bitterness. she was glad he was
not next to her at dinner and she was still thinking of his
words â€˜especially herâ€™ as they moved toward the table in the
garden.
for a moment now she was beside dick diver on the
path. alongside his hard, neat brightness everything faded
into the surety that he knew everything. for a year, which
was forever, she had had money and a certain celebrity and
contact with the celebrated, and these latter had presented
themselves merely as powerful enlargements of the people
with whom the doctorâ€™s widow and her daughter had associated
in a hÃ´tel-pension in paris. rosemary was a romantic
and her career had not provided many satisfactory opportunities
on that score. he

rosemary was already beyond thatâ€”she was in the movies

dick diver in her motherâ€™s face it meant that he was â€˜the real
thingâ€; it meant permission to go as far as she could.

not at that precise moment.
â€˜i want,â€™ insisted mrs. mckisco, â€˜to go to the bathroom.â€™
as a frank outspoken woman she walked toward the house,
dragging her secret after her, while rosemary looked after
with reprobation. earl brady proposed that they walk down
to the sea wall but she felt that this was her time to have a
share of dick diver when he reappeared, so she stalled, listening
to mckisco quarrel with barban.

which reached its apogee in the â€˜harvard mannerâ€™

type, and being drunk rashly forgot that he was in awe of
himâ€”this led up to the trouble in which he presently found
himself.
feeling vaguely ashamed for mckisco, rosemary waited,
placid but inwardly on fire, for dick diverâ€™s return. from
her chair at the deserted table with barban, mckisco, and
abe she looked up along the path edged with shadowy myrtle
and fern to the stone terrace, and falling in love with her
motherâ€™s profile against a lighted door, was about to go there
when mrs. mckisco came hurrying down from the house.

they were at voisins waiting for nicole, six of them,
rosemary, the norths, dick diver and two young french
musicians. they were looking over the other patrons of the
restaurant to see if they had reposeâ€”dick said no american
men had any repose, except himself, and they were seeking
an example to confront him with. things looked black for
themâ€”not a man had come into the restaurant for ten minutes
without raising his hand to his face.
â€˜we ought never to have given up waxed mustaches,â€™
said abe. â€˜nevertheless dick isnâ€™t the only man with reposeâ€”â€˜

they stood in an uncomfortable little group weighted
down by abeâ€™s gigantic presence: he lay athwart them like
the wreck of a galleon, dominating with his presence his
own weakness and self-indulgence, his narrowness and bitterness.
all of them were conscious of the solemn dignity
that flowed from him, of his achievement, fragmentary,
suggestive and surpassed. but they were frightened at his
survivant will, once a will to live, now become a will to die.
dick diver came and brought with him a fine glowing
surface on which the three women sprang like monkeys
with cries of relief, perching on his shoulders, on the beautiful
crown of his hat or the gold head of his cane. now, for a
moment, they could disregard the spectacle of abeâ€™s gigantic
obscenity. dick saw the situation quickly and grasped it
quietly. he pulled them out of themselves into the station,

vienna under the impression that, if he did not make haste,
the great freud would eventually succumb to an aeroplane
bomb. even then vienna was old with death but dick managed
to get enough coal and oil to sit in his room in the
damenstiff strasse and write the pamphlets that he later destroyed,
but that, rewritten, were the backbone of the book
he published in zurich in 1920.
most of us have a favorite, a heroic period, in our lives
and that was dick diverâ€™s. for one thing he had no idea that
he was charming, that the affection he gave and inspired was
anything unusual among healthy people. in his last year at
new haven some one referred to him as â€˜lucky dickâ€™â€”the
name lingered in his head.
â€˜lucky dick, you big stiff,â€™ he would whisper to himself,
walking around the last sticks of flame in his room. â€˜you

along.â€™

it was a damp april day, with long diagonal clouds over
the albishorn and water inert in the low places. zurich is
not unlike an american city. missing something ever since
his arrival two days before, dick perceived that it was the

more. in zurich there was a lot besides zurichâ€”the

upon his duel with tommy barban, upon the basis of which,
as it withered in his memory, he had created, afresh, a new
self-respect.
spotting dick diver the second day out, he eyed him
tentatively, then introduced himself in a friendly way and
sat down. dick laid aside his reading and, after the few
minutes that it took to realize the change in mckisco, the
disappearance of the manâ€™s annoying sense of inferiority,
found himself pleased to talk to him. mckisco was â€˜wellinformedâ€™
on a range of subjects wider than goetheâ€™sâ€”it
was interesting to listen to the innumerable facile combinations
that he referred to as his opinions. they struck
