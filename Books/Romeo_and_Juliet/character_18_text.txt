    and therefore hath the wind-swift cupid wings.
    now is the sun upon the highmost hill
    of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
    is three long hours; yet she is not come.
    had she affections and warm youthful blood,
    she would be as swift in motion as a ball;
    my words would bandy her to my sweet love,
    and his to me,
    but old folks, many feign as they were dead-
    unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.

    one who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
    hath sorted out a sudden day of joy
    that thou expects not nor i look'd not for.

  jul. madam, in happy time! what day is that?

  lady. marry, my child, early next thursday morn

  jul. now by saint peter's church, and peter too,
    he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
    i wonder at this haste, that i must wed
    ere he that should be husband comes to woo.
    i pray you tell my lord and father, madam,
    i will not marry yet; and when i do, i swear
    it shall be romeo, whom you know i hate,
    rather than paris. these are news indeed!
