s edison? isn't it all teamwork now?" bloody chiclitz, in his welcoming speech this morning, had stressed 
teamwork. 

"teamwork," koteks snarled, "is one word for it, yeah. what it really is is a way to avoid responsibility. it's a symptom of 

the gutlessness of the whole society." 
"goodness," said oedipa, "are you allowed to talk like that?" 

koteks looked to both sides, then rolled his chair closer. "you know the nefastis machine?" oedipa only widened her 
eyes. "well this was invented by john nefastis, who's up at berkeley now. john's somebody who still invents things. here. i 
have a copy of the patent." from a drawer he produced a xeroxed wad of papers, showing a box with a sketch of a bearded 
victorian on its outside, and coming out of the top two pistons attached to a crankshaft and flywheel. 

"who's that with the beard?" asked oedipa. james clerk maxwell, explained koteks, a famous scotch scientist who had 

once postulated a tiny intelligence, known as maxwell's demon. the demon coul

face congealed, a mask of distrust. "it's w.a.s.t.e., lady," he told her, "an acronym, not 
'waste,' and we had best not go into it any further." 

"i saw it in a ladies' john," she confessed. but stanley koteks was no longer about to be sweet-talked. 
"forget it," he advised; opened a book and proceeded to ignore her. 

 
she in her turn, clearly, was not about to forget it. the envelope she'd seen koteks doodling what she'd begun to think of 
as the "waste symbol" on had come, she bet, from john nefastis. or somebody like him. her suspicions got embellished 
by, of all people, mike fallopian of the peter pinguid society. 

"sure this koteks is part of some underground," he told her a few days later, "an underground of the unbalanced, 

possibly, but then how can you blame them for being maybe a little bitter? look what's happening to them. in school they 
got brainwashed, like all of us, into believing the myth of the american inventor—morse and his telegraph, bell and his 
telephone, edison

of ford, webster, toumeur and wharfinger, published by the lectern press, berkeley, california, 
back in 1957. she poured herself half a tumbler of jack daniels (the paranoids having left them a fresh bottle the evening before) 
and called the l.a. library. they checked, but didn't have the hardcover. they could look it up on inter-library loan for her. 
"wait," she said, having just got an idea, "the publisher's up in berkeley. maybe i'll try them directly." thinking also that she 
could visit john nefastis. 

she had caught sight of the historical marker only because she'd gone back, deliberately, to lake invera-rity one day, owing to this, 
what you might have to call, growing obsession, with "bringing something of herself" —even if that something was just her presence—to 
the scatter of business interests that had survived inverar-ity. she would give them order, she would create constellations; next day 
she drove out to vesperhaven house, a home for senior citizens that inverarity had put

now all transferred, deserted, in stir, fleeing the skip-tracers, out of their skull, on horse, alcoholic, fanatic, under aliases, dead, 
impossible to find ever again. among them they had managed to turn the young oedipa into a rare creature indeed, unfit 
perhaps for marches and sit-ins, but just a whiz at pursuing strange words in jacobean texts. 

she pulled the impala into a gas station somewhere along a gray stretch of telegraph avenue and found in a phone 

book the address of john nefastis. she then drove to a pseudo-mexican apartment house, looked for his name among the u. s. 
mailboxes, ascended outside steps and walked down a row of draped windows till she found his door. he had a crewcut and the 
same underage look as koteks, but wore a shirt on various polynesian themes and dating from the truman administration. 

introducing herself, she invoked the name of stanley koteks. "he said you could tell me whether or not i'm a 'sensitive'." 
nefastis had been watching on his tv se

explained. "there's something about a little chick that age." 

"so does my husband," she said. "i understand." 

john nefastis beamed at her, simpatico, and brought out his machine from a workroom in back. it looked about the way the 
patent had described it. "you know how this works?" 

 
"stanley gave me a kind of rundown." he began then, bewilderingly, to talk about something called entropy. the word bothered 
him as much as "trystero" bothered oedipa. but it was too technical for her. she did gather that there were two distinct kinds 
of this entropy. one having to do with heat-engines, the other to do with commun

g in san francisco? smog, according to the 
folklore, did not begin till farther south. it had to be the angle of the sun. 

amid the exhaust, sweat, glare and ill-humor of a summer evening on an american freeway, oedipa maas pondered her trystero 

problem. all the silence of san narciso—the calm surface of the motel pool, the contemplative contours of residential streets like 
rakings in the sand of a japanese garden—had not allowed her to think as leisurely as this freeway madness. 

for john nefastis (to take a recent example) two kinds of entropy, thermodynamic and informational, happened, say by 

coincidence, to look alike, when you wrote them down as equations. yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable, with the 
help of maxwell's demon. 

now here was oedipa, faced with a metaphor of god knew how many parts; more than two, anyway. with coincidences 

blossoming these days wherever she looked, she had nothing but a sound, a word, trystero,   a to hold them together.

 he said. 

"remember your friends," said the arthritic, watching the ten. 
"bitch," said the sailor. "why didn't you wait till he was gone?" 
oedipa watched him make adjustments so he'd fit easier against the mattress. that stuffed memory. regis-tera . . . 
"give me a cigarette, ramirez," the sailor said. "i know you got one." 
would it be today? "ramirez," she cried. the arthritic looked around on his rusty neck. "he's going to die," she said. 

"who isn't?" said ramirez. 

 

she remembered john nefastis, talking about his machine, and massive destructions of information. so when this mattress 

flared up around the sailor, in his viking's funeral: the stored, coded years of uselessness, early death, self-harrowing, the sure decay of 
hope, the set of all men who had slept on it, whatever their lives had been, would truly cease to be, forever, when the mattress burned. 
she stared at it in wonder. it was as if she had just discovered the irreversible process. it astonished her to think that so

with two- or three-bedroom houses, all their windows giving blankly back only the sun. one by one his sack of letters emptied. at 
length he climbed on a berkeley bus.  oedipa followed. halfway up telegraph the carrier got off and led her down the street to a 
pseudo-mexican apartment house. not once had he looked behind him. john nefastis lived here. she was back where she'd 
started, and could not believe 24 hours had passed. should it have been more or less? 

back in the hotel she found the lobby full of deaf-mute delegates in party hats, copied in crepe paper after the fur chinese 
communist jobs made popular during the korean conflict. they were every one of them drunk, and a few of the men 
grabbed her, thinking to bring her along to a party in the grand ballroom. she tried to struggle out of the silent, gesturing swarm,
