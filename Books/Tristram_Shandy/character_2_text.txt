the life and opinions of tristram shandy, gentleman


to the right honourable mr. pitt.

sir,

never poor wight of a dedicator had less hopes from his dedication,
than i have from this of mine; for it is written in a bye corner of the
kingdom, and in a retir'd thatch'd house, where i live in a constant
endeavour to fence against the infirmities of ill health, and other
evils of life, by mirth; being firmly persuaded that every time a man
smiles,--but much more so, when he laughs, it adds something to this
fragment of life.

under your protection,--it must protect itself, but)--into the country
with you; where, if i am ever told, it has made you smile; or can
conceive it has beguiled you of one moment's pain--i shall think myself
as happy as a minister of state;--perhaps much happier than any one (one
only excepted) that i have read or heard of.

i am, great sir, (and, what is more to your honour) i am, good sir, your
well-wisher, and most humble fellow-subject,

the author.




the life and opinions of tristram shandy, gent.--volume the first



chapter 1.i.

i wish either my father or my mother, or indeed both of them, as they
were in duty both equally bound to it, had minded what they were about
when they begot me; had they duly consider'd how much depended upon what
they were then doing;--that not only the production of a rational
being was concerned in it, but that possibly the happy formation and
temperature of his body, perhaps his genius and the very cast of his
mind;--and, for aught they knew to the

ility worn down to a thread;--his own animal
spirits ruffled beyond description,--and that in this sad disorder'd
state of nerves, he had lain down a prey to sudden starts, or a
series of melancholy dreams and fancies, for nine long, long months
together.--i tremble to think what a foundation had been laid for
a thousand weaknesses both of body and mind, which no skill of the
physician or the philosopher could ever afterwards have set thoroughly
to rights.



chapter 1.iii.

to my uncle mr. toby shandy do i stand indebted for the preceding
anecdote, to whom my father, who was an excellent natural philosopher,
and much given to close reasoning upon the smallest matters, had oft,
and heavily complained of the injury; but once more particularly, as
my uncle toby well remember'd, upon his observing a most unaccountable
obliquity, (as he call'd it) in my manner of setting up my top, and
justifying the principles upon which i had done it,--the old gentleman
shook his head, and in a tone more expres

 along foreboded, and he saw it verified
in this, and from a thousand other observations he had made upon me,
that i should neither think nor act like any other man's child:--but
alas! continued he, shaking his head a second time, and wiping away
a tear which was trickling down his cheeks, my tristram's misfortunes
began nine months before ever he came into the world.

--my mother, who was sitting by, look'd up, but she knew no more than
her backside what my father meant,--but my uncle, mr. toby shandy, who
had been often informed of the affair,--understood him very well.



chapter 1.iv.

i know there are readers in the world, as well as many other good people
in it, who are no readers at all,--who find themselves ill at ease,
unless they are let into the whole secret from first to last, of every
thing which concerns you.

it is in pure compliance with this humour of theirs, and from a
backwardness in my nature to disappoint any one soul living, that i have
been so very particular already. a

what follows in the beginning of the next chapter, puts it beyond all
possibility of a doubt.

--but pray, sir, what was your father doing all december, january, and
february?--why, madam,--he was all that time afflicted with a sciatica.



chapter 1.v.

on the fifth day of november, 1718, which to the aera fixed on, was
as near nine kalendar months as any husband could in reason have
expected,--was i tristram shandy, gentleman, brought forth into this
scurvy and disastrous world of ours.--i wish i had been born in the
moon, or in any of the planets, (except jupiter or saturn, because i
never could bear cold weather) for it could not well have fared worse
with me in any of them (though i will not answer for venus) than it
has in this vile, dirty planet of ours,--which, o' my conscience, with
reverence be it spoken, i take to be made up of the shreds and clippings
of the rest;--not but the planet is well eno

i solemnly declare to all mankind, that the above dedication was made
for no one prince, prelate, pope, or potentate,--duke, marquis, earl,
viscount, or baron, of this, or any other realm in christendom;--nor has
it yet been hawked about, or offered publicly or privately, directly
or indirectly, to any one person or personage, great or small; but is
honestly a true virgin-dedication untried on, upon any soul living.

the moon, who, by the bye, of all the patrons or matrons i can think of,
has most power to set my book a-going, and make the world run mad after
it.

chapter 1.x.

whatever degree of small merit the act of benignity in favour of the
midwife might justly claim, or in whom that claim truly rested,--at
first sight seems not very material to this history;--certain however it
was, that the gentlewoman, the parson's wife, did run away at that time
with the whole of it: and yet, for my life, i cannot help thinking but
that the parson himself, though he had not the good fortune to hit upon
the design first,--yet, as h

chapter 1.xv.

the article in my mother's marriage-settlement, which i told the reader
i was at the pains to search for, and which, now that i have found it, i
think proper to lay before him,--is so much more fully express'd in
the deed itself, than ever i can pretend to do it, that it would be
barbarity to take it out of the lawyer's hand:--it is as follows.

'and this indenture further witnesseth, that the said walter shandy,
merchant, in consideration of the said intended marriage to be had,
and, by god's blessing, to be well and truly solemnized and consummated
between the said walter shandy and elizabeth mollineux aforesaid, and
divers other good and valuable causes and considerations him thereunto
specially moving,--doth grant, covenant, condescend, consent, conclude,

bearing and bringing forth children;--and that, in consequence of the
said walter shandy having so left off business, he shall in despight,
and against the free-will, consent, and good-liking of the said
elizabeth mollineux,--make a departure from the city of london, in order
to retire to, and dwell upon, his estate at shandy hall, in the county
of..., or at any other country-seat, castle, hall, mansion-house,

or upon any part or parcel thereof:--that then, and as often as the said

witnesseth, that for the more effectually carrying of the said covenant
into execution, the said walter shandy, merchant, doth hereby grant,

possession now being, by virtue of an indenture of bargain and sale for

for a year, bears date the day next before the date of these presents,

rectory or parsonage of shandy aforesaid, and all and every the tenths,
tythes, glebe-lands.'--in three words,--'my mother was to lay in (if she
chose it) in london.'

but in order to put a stop to the practice of any unfair play on
the part of my mother, which a marriage-article of this nature too
manifestly opened a door to, and which indeed had never been thought of
at all, but for my uncle toby shandy;--a clause was added in security of
my father which was this:--'that in case my mother hereafter should, at
any time, put

me few scruples and uneasinesses which hung upon my father's spirits
in relation to this choice.--to say nothing of the natural workings
of humanity and justice--or of the yearnings of parental and connubial
love, all which prompted him to leave as little to hazard as possible in
a case of this kind;--he felt himself concerned in a particular manner,
that all should go right in the present case;--from the accumulated
sorrow he lay open to, should any evil betide his wife and child in
lying-in at shandy-hall.--he knew the world judged by events, and would
add to his afflictions in such a misfortune, by loading him with the
whole blame of it.--'alas o'day;--had mrs. shandy, poor gentlewoman!
had but her wish in going up to town just to lye-in and come down
again;--which they say, she begged and prayed for upon her bare
knees,--and which, in my opinion, considering the fortune which mr.
shandy got with her,--was no such mighty matter to have complied with,
the lady and her babe might both of the

 a variety of characters,--'twas no fair match:--'twas seven
to one.--what could my mother do?--she had the advantage (otherwise
she had been certainly overpowered) of a small reinforcement of chagrin
personal at the bottom, which bore her up, and enabled her to dispute
the affair with my father with so equal an advantage,--that both sides
sung te deum. in a word, my mother was to have the old woman,--and the
operator was to have licence to drink a bottle of wine with my father
and my uncle toby shandy in the back parlour,--for which he was to be
paid five guineas.

i must beg leave, before i finish this chapter, to enter a caveat in the
breast of my fair reader;--and it is this,--not to take it absolutely
for granted, from an unguarded word or two which i have dropp'd in
it,--'that i am a married man.'--i own, the tender appellation of
my dear, dear jenny,--with some other strokes of conjugal knowledge,
interspersed here and there, might, naturally enough, have misled
the most candid judge i

r impossibility, for some volumes, that you, or the most
penetrating spirit upon earth, should know how this matter really
stands.--it is not impossible, but that my dear, dear jenny! tender as
the appellation is, may be my child.--consider,--i was born in the
year eighteen.--nor is there any thing unnatural or extravagant in
the supposition, that my dear jenny may be my friend.--friend!--my
friend.--surely, madam, a friendship between the two sexes may subsist,
and be supported without--fy! mr. shandy:--without any thing, madam,
but that tender and delicious sentiment which ever mixes in friendship,
where there is a difference of sex. let me intreat you to study the
pure and sentimental parts of the best french romances;--it will really,
madam, astonish you to see with what a variety of chaste expressions
this delicious sentiment, which i have the honour to speak of, is
dress'd out.

--i wonder what's all that noise, and running backwards and forwards
for, above stairs, quoth my father, addressing himself, after an hour
and a half's silence, to my uncle toby,--who, you must know, was sitting
on the opposite side of the fire, smoaking his social pipe all the time,
in mute contemplation of a new pair of black plush-breeches which he
had got on:--what can they be doing,

uctions of it, had not there appeared too many
strong lines in it of a family-likeness, which shewed that he derived
the singularity of his temper more from blood, than either wind or
water, or any modifications or combinations of them whatever: and i
have, therefore, oft-times wondered, that my father, tho' i believe he
had his reasons for it, upon his observing some tokens of eccentricity,
in my course, when i was a boy,--should never once endeavour to account
for them in this way: for all the shandy family were of an original
character throughout:--i mean the males,--the females had no character
at all,--except, indeed, my great aunt dinah, who, about sixty years
ago, was married and got with child by the coachman, for which my
father, according to his hypothesis of christian names, would often say,
she might thank her godfathers and godmothers.

it will seem strange,--and i would as soon think of dropping a riddle
in the reader's way, which is not my interest to do, as set him upon
guessi

he interruption of
the peace and unity, which otherwise so cordially subsisted, between my
father and my uncle toby. one would have thought, that the whole force
of the misfortune should have spent and wasted itself in the family at
first,--as is generally the case.--but nothing ever wrought with our
family after the ordinary way. possibly at the very time this happened,
it might have something else to afflict it; and as afflictions are sent
down for our good, and that as this had never done the shandy family
any good at all, it might lie waiting till apt times and circumstances
should give it an opportunity to discharge its office.--observe,
i determine nothing upon this.--my way is ever to point out to the
curious, different tracts of investigation, to come at the first springs
of the events i tell;--not with a pedantic fescue,--or in the decisive
manner or tacitus, who outwits himself and his reader;--but with the
officious humility of a heart devoted to the assistance merely of the

itive;--to them i write,--and by them i shall be read,--if any
such reading as this could be supposed to hold out so long,--to the very
end of the world.

why this cause of sorrow, therefore, was thus reserved for my father and
uncle, is undetermined by me. but how and in what direction it exerted
itself so as to become the cause of dissatisfaction between them, after
it began to operate, is what i am able to explain with great exactness,
and is as follows:

my uncle toby shandy, madam, was a gentleman, who, with the virtues
which usually constitute the character of a man of honour and
rectitude,--possessed one in a very eminent degree, which is seldom
or never put into the catalogue; and that was a most extreme and
unparallel'd modesty of nature;--though i correct the word nature, for
this reason, that i may not prejudge a point which must shortly come
to a hearing, and that is, whether this modesty of his was natural or
acquir'd.--whichever way my uncle toby came by

ruing the words to my uncle toby, as he went along, amicus plato;
that is, dinah was my aunt;--sed magis amica veritas--but truth is my
sister.

this contrariety of humours betwixt my father and my uncle, was the
source of many a fraternal squabble. the one could not bear to hear the
tale of family disgrace recorded,--and the other would scarce ever let a
day pass to an end without some hint at it.

for god's sake, my uncle toby would cry,--and for my sake, and for all
our sakes, my dear brother shandy,--do let this story of our aunt's
and her ashes sleep in peace;--how can you,--how can you have so little
feeling and compassion for the character of our family?--what is the
character of a family to an hypothesis? my father would reply.--nay,
if you come to that--what is the life of a family?--the life of a
family!--my uncle toby would say, throwing himself back in his arm
chair, and lifting up his hands, his eyes, and one leg--yes, the
life,--my father would say, maintaining his point. how ma

 counterscarp, before the gate
of st. nicolas, extending itself from the bank of the maes, quite up
to the great water-stop,--the ground was cut and cross cut with such a
multitude of dykes, drains, rivulets, and sluices, on all sides,--and
he would get so sadly bewildered, and set fast amongst them, that
frequently he could neither get backwards or forwards to save his life;
and was oft-times obliged to give up the attack upon that very account
only.

these perplexing rebuffs gave my uncle toby shandy more perturbations
than you would imagine; and as my father's kindness to him was
continually dragging up fresh friends and fresh enquirers,--he had but a
very uneasy task of it.

no doubt my uncle toby had great command of himself,--and could guard
appearances, i believe, as well as most men;--yet any one may imagine,
that when he could not retreat out of the ravelin without getting into
the half-moon, or get out of the covered-way without falling down the
counterscarp, nor cross the dyke with

s advice,--he privately ordered
trim, his man, to pack up a bundle of lint and dressings, and hire a
chariot-and-four to be at the door exactly by twelve o'clock that day,
when he knew my father would be upon 'change.--so leaving a bank-note
upon the table for the surgeon's care of him, and a letter of
tender thanks for his brother's--he packed up his maps, his books of
fortification, his instruments, &c. and by the help of a crutch on one
side, and trim on the other,--my uncle toby embarked for shandy-hall.

the reason, or rather the rise of this sudden demigration was as
follows:

the table in my uncle toby's room, and at which, the night before this
change happened, he was sitting with his maps, &c. about him--being
somewhat of the smallest, for that infinity of great and small
instruments of knowledge which usually lay crowded upon it--he had
the accident, in reaching over for his tobacco-box, to throw down his
compasses, and in stooping to take the compasses up, with his sleeve he
threw

ot taste it.--trim, quoth my uncle toby, get me to bed.--'twas
all one.--corporal trim's description had fired his imagination,--my
uncle toby could not shut his eyes.--the more he considered it, the more
bewitching the scene appeared to him;--so that, two full hours before
day-light, he had come to a final determination and had concerted the
whole plan of his and corporal trim's decampment.

my uncle toby had a little neat country-house of his own, in the village
where my father's estate lay at shandy, which had been left him by
an old uncle, with a small estate of about one hundred pounds a-year.
behind this house, and contiguous to it, was a kitchen-garden of about
half an acre, and at the bottom of the garden, and cut off from it by
a tall yew hedge, was a bowling-green, containing just about as much
ground as corporal trim wished for;--so that as trim uttered the
words, 'a rood and a half of ground to do what they would with,'--this
identical bowling-green instantly presented itself, and

d three-fifths,--should take upon him
to insult over me for such a breach in the unity, or rather probability
of time;--i would remind him, that the idea of duration, and of its
simple modes, is got merely from the train and succession of our
ideas--and is the true scholastic pendulum,--and by which, as a scholar,
i will be tried in this matter,--abjuring and detesting the jurisdiction
of all other pendulums whatever.

i would therefore desire him to consider that it is but poor eight miles
from shandy-hall to dr. slop, the man-midwife's house:--and that whilst
obadiah has been going those said miles and back, i have brought my
uncle toby from namur, quite across all flanders, into england:--that
i have had him ill upon my hands near four years;--and have since
travelled him and corporal trim in a chariot-and-four, a journey of near
two hundred miles down into yorkshire.--all which put together, must
have prepared the reader's imagination for the entrance of dr. slop upon
the stage,--as much,
 
 ___________________________
 
-have been a subject of juster apprehension to dr. slop
in his situation, than the worst of whiston's comets?--to say nothing of
the nucleus; that is, of obadiah and the coach-horse.--in my idea, the
vortex alone of 'em was enough to have involved and carried, if not the
doctor, at least the doctor's pony, quite away with it. what then do you
think must the terror and hydrophobia of dr. slop have been, when you
read (which you are just going to do) that he was advancing thus warily
along towards shandy-hall, and had approached to within sixty yards of
it, and within five yards of a sudden turn, made by an acute angle
of the garden-wall,--and in the dirtiest part of a dirty
lane,--when obadiah and his coach-horse turned the corner, rapid,
furious,--pop,--full upon him!--nothing, i think, in nature, can be
supposed more terrible than such a rencounter,--so imprompt! so ill
prepared to stand the shock of it as dr. slop was.

what could dr. slop do?--he crossed himself + --pugh!--but the doctor,

 
 ___________________________
 

uncle toby was not very expert at it, you may think, he might not care
to use it.--no; the reason was,--'twas not his nature to insult.

dr. slop's presence at that time, was no less problematical than the
mode of it; tho' it is certain, one moment's reflexion in my father
might have solved it; for he had apprized dr. slop but the week before,
that my mother was at her full reckoning; and as the doctor had heard
nothing since, 'twas natural and very political too in him, to have
taken a ride to shandy-hall, as he did, merely to see how matters went
on.

but my father's mind took unfortunately a wrong turn in the
investigation; running, like the hypercritick's, altogether upon
the ringing of the bell and the rap upon the door,--measuring their
distance, and keeping his mind so intent upon the operation, as to have
power to think of nothing else,--common-place infirmity of the greatest
mathematicians! working with might and main at the demonstration, and so
wasting all their strength upon it,

tins and
horn-works.--that i dare say you would not, quoth dr. slop, interrupting
him, and laughing most immoderately at his pun.

dennis the critic could not detest and abhor a pun, or the insinuation
of a pun, more cordially than my father;--he would grow testy upon it at
any time;--but to be broke in upon by one, in a serious discourse, was
as bad, he would say, as a fillip upon the nose;--he saw no difference.

sir, quoth my uncle toby, addressing himself to dr. slop,--the
curtins my brother shandy mentions here, have nothing to do with
beadsteads;--tho', i know du cange says, 'that bed-curtains, in all
probability, have taken their name from them;'--nor have the horn-works
he speaks of, any thing in the world to do with the horn-works of
cuckoldom: but the curtin, sir, is the word we use in fortification, for
that part of the wall or rampart which lies between the two bastions and
joins them--besiegers seldom offer to carry on their attacks directly
against the curtin, for this reason, b

mes as much, brother. but 'tis ungenerous, replied my father,
to hurt any man;--a brother worse;--but to hurt a brother of such gentle
manners,--so unprovoking,--and so unresenting;--'tis base:--by heaven,
'tis cowardly.--you are heartily welcome, brother, quoth my uncle
toby,--had it been fifty times as much.--besides, what have i to do,
my dear toby, cried my father, either with your amusements or your
pleasures, unless it was in my power (which it is not) to increase their
measure?

--brother shandy, answered my uncle toby, looking wistfully in his
face,--you are much mistaken in this point:--for you do increase my
pleasure very much, in begetting children for the shandy family at your
time of life.--but, by that, sir, quoth dr. slop, mr. shandy increases
his own.--not a jot, quoth my father.

my brother does it, quoth my uncle toby, out of principle.--in a family
way, i suppose, quoth dr. slop.--pshaw!--said my father,--'tis not worth
talking of.

advancement in the church;--i leave that to others;--but i
find myself impelled by two reasons, which i cannot withstand.

the first is, that in doing justice, i may give rest to yorick's
ghost;--which--as the country-people, and some others believe,--still
walks.

the second reason is, that, by laying open this story to the world,
i gain an opportunity of informing it,--that in case the character of
parson yorick, and this sample of his sermons, is liked,--there are now
in the possession of the shandy family, as many as will make a handsome
volume, at the world's service,--and much good may they do it.



chapter 1.xliii.

obadiah gained the two crowns without dispute;--for he came in jingling,
with all the instruments in the green baize bag we spoke of, flung
across his body, just as corporal trim went out of the room.

it is now proper, i think, quoth dr. slop, (clearing up his looks) as
we are in a condition to be of some service to mrs. shandy, to send up
stairs to know how she goes on.

 
 ___________________________
 
reto,--you was led, i
think, into an opinion,--(and i am sure i said as much) that my father
was a gentleman altogether as odd and whimsical in fifty other opinions.
in truth, there was not a stage in the life of man, from the very first
act of his begetting,--down to the lean and slippered pantaloon in
his second childishness, but he had some favourite notion to himself,
springing out of it, as sceptical, and as far out of the high-way of
thinking, as these two which have been explained.

my father, who dipped into all kinds of books, upon looking into
lithopaedus senonesis de portu difficili, (the author is here twice
mistaken; for lithopaedus should be wrote thus, lithopaedii senonensis
icon. the second mistake is, that this lithopaedus is not an author,
but a drawing of a petrified child. the account of this, published by
athosius 1580, may be seen at the end of cordaeus's works in spachius.
mr. tristram shandy has been led into this error, either from seeing
lithopaedus's name of late in a catalogue of learned writers in dr...,
or by mistaking lithopaedus for trinecavellius,--from the too great
similitude of the names.) published by adrianus smelvgot, had found out,
that the lax and pliable state of a child's head in parturition, the
bones of the cranium having no sutures at that time, was such,--that by
force of the woman's efforts, which, in strong labour-pains, was

belly of the mother might be opened extremely well to give a passage to
the child.--he mentioned the thing one afternoon to my mother,--merely
as a matter of fact; but seeing her turn as pale as ashes at the very
mention of it, as much as the operation flattered his hopes,--he
thought it as well to say no more of it,--contenting himself with
admiring,--what he thought was to no purpose to propose.

this was my father mr. shandy's hypothesis; concerning which i have only
to add, that my brother bobby did as great honour to it (whatever he did
to the family) as any one of the great heroes we spoke of: for happening
not only to be christened, as i told you, but to be born too, when my
father was at epsom,--being moreover my mother's first child,--coming
into the world with his head foremost,--and turning out afterwards a lad
of wonderful slow parts,--my father spelt all these together into his
opinion: and as he had fail

he did not conceive how the greatest family in england could stand
it out against an uninterrupted succession of six or seven short
noses.--and for the contrary reason, he would generally add, that it
must be one of the greatest problems in civil life, where the same
number of long and jolly noses, following one another in a direct
line, did not raise and hoist it up into the best vacancies in the
kingdom.--he would often boast that the shandy family rank'd very
high in king harry the viiith's time, but owed its rise to no state
engine--he would say--but to that only;--but that, like other families,
he would add--it had felt the turn of the wheel, and had never recovered
the blow of my great-grandfather's nose.--it was an ace of clubs indeed,
he would cry, shaking his head--and as vile a one for an unfortunate
family as ever turn'd up trumps.

up an opinion, sir, as a man in a state of nature picks up an apple.--it

rather than give it up.

i am aware that didius, the great civilian, will contest this point;
and cry out against me, whence comes this man's right to this apple? ex
confesso, he will say--things were in a state of nature--the apple, is
as much frank's apple as john's. pray, mr. shandy, what patent has he
to shew for it? and how did it begin to be his? was it, when he set his
heart upon it? or when he gathered it? or when he chew'd it? or when he
roasted it? or when he peel'd, or when he brought it home? or when he
digested?--or when he--?--for 'tis plain, sir, if the first picking up
of the apple, made it not his--that no subsequent act could.

sat down to write the story of)--where the characters of it were cast or
contrasted with so dramatick a felicity as ours was, for this end; or in
which the capacities of affording such exquisite scenes, and the powers
of shifting them perpetually from morning to night, were lodged and
intrusted with so unlimited a confidence, as in the shandy family.

not any one of these was more diverting, i say, in this whimsical
theatre of ours--than what frequently arose out of this self-same
chapter of long noses--especially when my father's imagination was
heated with the enquiry, and nothing would serve him but to heat my
uncle toby's too.

my uncle toby would give my father all possible fair play in this
attempt; and with infinite patience would sit smoking his pipe for
whole hours together, whilst my father was practising upon his head,

testily--but i say toby, when one runs over the catalogue of all the
cross-reckonings and sorrowful items with which the heart of man is
overcharged, 'tis wonderful by what hidden resources the mind is enabled
to stand out, and bear itself up, as it does, against the impositions
laid upon our nature.--'tis by the assistance of almighty god, cried
my uncle toby, looking up, and pressing the palms of his hands close
together--'tis not from our own strength, brother shandy--a centinel
in a wooden centry-box might as well pretend to stand it out against a
detachment of fifty men.--we are upheld by the grace and the assistance
of the best of beings.

--that is cutting the knot, said my father, instead of untying it,--but
give me leave to lead you, brother toby, a little deeper into the

is it not a shame to make two chapters of what passed in going down one
pair of stairs? for we are got no farther yet than to the first landing,
and there are fifteen more steps down to the bottom; and for aught i

be as many chapters as steps:--let that be as it will, sir, i can no
more help it than my destiny:--a sudden impulse comes across me--drop

whether, lastly, it was from the sinister turn which every thing

our reproach, that instead of the bend-dexter, which since harry the

it be whose it would--or coach-man, or coach-horse, or coach-hire, could
never be named in the family, but he constantly complained of carrying
this vile mark of illegitimacy upon the door of his own; he never once
was able to step into the coach, or out of it, without turning round to

my brother's child, cried my uncle toby, has nothing to do with the
pope--'tis the plain child of a protestant gentleman, christen'd
tristram against the wills and wishes both of his father and mother, and
all who are a-kin to it.--

if the wills and wishes, said kysarcius, interrupting my uncle toby, of
those only who stand related to mr. shandy's child, were to have weight
in this matter, mrs. shandy, of all people, has the least to do in
it.--my uncle toby lay'd down his pipe, and my father drew his chair
still closer to the table, to hear the conclusion of so strange an
introduction.

--it has not only been a question, captain shandy, amongst the (vide
swinburn on testaments, part 7. para 8.) best lawyers and civilians in
this land, continued kysarcius, 'whether the mother be of kin to her
child,'--but, after much dispassionate enqu

this determination, continued kysarcius, how contrary soever it may seem
to run to the stream of vulgar ideas, yet had reason strongly on its
side; and has been put out of all manner of dispute from the famous
case, known commonly by the name of the duke of suffolk's case.--it
is cited in brook, said triptolemus--and taken notice of by lord coke,
added didius.--and you may find it in swinburn on testaments, said
kysarcius.

the case, mr. shandy, was this:

in the reign of edward the sixth, charles duke of suffolk having issue a
son by one venter, and a daughter by another venter, made his last will,
wherein he devised goods to his son, and died; after whose death the son
died also--but without will, without wife, and without child--his mother
and his sister by the father's side (for she was born of the former
venter) then living. the mother took the administration of her son's

this stair-case conversation is not so long as the last--and pray,
yorick, said my uncle toby, which way is this said affair of tristram
at length settled by these learned men? very satisfactorily, replied
yorick; no mortal, sir, has any concern with it--for mrs. shandy the
mother is nothing at all a-kin to him--and as the mother's is the surest
side--mr. shandy, in course is still less than nothing--in short, he is
not as much a-kin to him, sir, as i am.--

this was not altogether so easy to be done; for though 'tis certain
my father had long before set his heart upon this necessary part of my
brother's education, and like a prudent man had actually determined to
carry it into execution, with the first money that returned from the
second creation of actions in the missisippi-scheme, in which he was an
adventurer--yet the ox-moor, which was a fine, large, whinny, undrained,
unimproved common, belonging to the shandy-estate, had almost as old
a claim upon him: he had long and affectionately set his heart upon
turning it likewise to some account.

but having never hitherto been pressed with such a conjuncture of
things, as made it necessary to settle either the priority or justice of
their claims--like a wise man he had refrained entering into any nice
or critical examination about them: so that upon the dismission of every
other project at this crisis--the two old projects, the ox-moor and

the benefit of exercise and change of so much air--but simply for the
mere delectation of his fancy, by the feather put into his cap, of
having been abroad--tantum valet, my father would say, quantum sonat.

now as this was a reasonable, and in course a most christian
indulgence--to deprive him of it, without why or wherefore--and thereby
make an example of him, as the first shandy unwhirl'd about europe in a
post-chaise, and only because he was a heavy lad--would be using him ten
times worse than a turk.

on the other hand, the case of the ox-moor was full as hard.

exclusive of the original purchase-money, which was eight hundred
pounds--it had cost the family eight hundred pounds more in a law-suit
about fifteen years before--besides the lord knows what trouble and

my father had certainly sunk under this evil, as certainly as he had
done under that of my christian name--had he not been rescued out of
it, as he was out of that, by a fresh evil--the misfortune of my brother
bobby's death.

what is the life of man! is it not to shift from side to side?--from
sorrow to sorrow?--to button up one cause of vexation--and unbutton
another?



chapter 2.lxvii.

from this moment i am to be considered as heir-apparent to the shandy
family--and it is from this point properly, that the story of my life
and my opinions sets out. with all my hurry and precipitation, i have
but been clearing the ground to raise the building--and such a building
do i foresee it will turn out, as never was planned, and as never was
executed since adam. in less than five minutes i shall have thrown
my pen into the fire, and the little drop of thick ink which is left
remaining at the bottom of my ink-horn, after it--i have but half a

and so with this moral for the present, may it please your worships and
your reverences, i take my leave of you till this time twelve-month,
when, (unless this vile cough kills me in the mean time) i'll have
another pluck at your beards, and lay open a story to the world you
little dream of.

(my father found he got great ease, and went on)--'kingdoms and
provinces, and towns and cities, have they not their periods? and
when those principles and powers, which at first cemented and put
them together, have performed their several evolutions, they fall
back.'--brother shandy, said my uncle toby, laying down his pipe at the
word evolutions--revolutions, i meant, quoth my father,--by heaven!
i meant revolutions, brother toby--evolutions is nonsense.--'tis not
nonsense--said my uncle toby.--but is it not nonsense to break the
thread of such a discourse upon such an occasion? cried my father--do
not--dear toby, continued he, taking him by the hand, do not--do not, i
beseech thee, interrupt me at this crisis.--my uncle toby put his pipe

he might fancy to the contrary, was not so much a state of composition,
as a state of warfare; and his probation in it, precisely that of any
other man militant upon earth,--both depending alike, not half so much
upon the degrees of his wit--as his resistance.

my father was hugely pleased with this theory of john de la casse,
archbishop of benevento; and (had it not cramped him a little in his
creed) i believe would have given ten of the best acres in the shandy
estate, to have been the broacher of it.--how far my father actually
believed in the devil, will be seen, when i come to speak of my father's
religious notions, in the progress of this work: 'tis enough to say
here, as he could not have the honour of it, in the literal sense of
the doctrine--he took up with the allegory of it; and would often say,
especially when his pen was a little retrograde, there was as much good

abreast,--and do you, corporal, follow a few paces behind us.--and
susannah, an' please your honour, said trim, shall be put in the
rear.--'twas an excellent disposition,--and in this order, without
either drums beating, or colours flying, they marched slowly from my
uncle toby's house to shandy-hall.

--i wish, said trim, as they entered the door,--instead of the sash
weights, i had cut off the church spout, as i once thought to have
done.--you have cut off spouts enow, replied yorick.

as many pictures as have been given of my father, how like him soever
in different airs and attitudes,--not one, or all of them, can ever help
the reader to any kind of preconception of how my father would think,

world besides us, have such eternal squabbles about nothing.--she looks
at her outside,--i, at her in.... how is it possible we should agree
about her value?



chapter 3.xxv.

'tis a point settled,--and i mention it for the comfort of confucius,
(mr shandy is supposed to mean..., esq; member for...,--and not the
chinese legislator.) who is apt to get entangled in telling a plain
story--that provided he keeps along the line of his story,--he may go
backwards and forwards as he will,--'tis still held to be no digression.

this being premised, i take the benefit of the act of going backwards
myself.

uncle toby,--do tell me what a polemic divine is?--the best description,
captain shandy, i have ever read, is of a couple of 'em, replied yorick,
in the account of the battle fought single hands betwixt gymnast and
captain tripet; which i have in my pocket.--i beg i may hear it, quoth
my uncle toby earnestly.--you shall, said yorick.--and as the corporal
is waiting for me at the door,--and i know the description of a battle
will do the poor fellow more good than his supper,--i beg, brother,
you'll give him leave to come in.--with all my soul, said my
father.--trim came in, erect a

into the corporal's head to maintain that due contention betwixt the
radical heat and the radical moisture, by reinforceing the fever, as he
did all along, with hot wine and spices; whereby the corporal kept up
(as it were) a continual firing, so that the radical heat stood its
ground from the beginning to the end, and was a fair match for the
moisture, terrible as it was.--upon my honour, added my uncle toby,
you might have heard the contention within our bodies, brother shandy,
twenty toises.--if there was no firing, said yorick.

the word--was i a judge, and the laws of the country which made me one

they had had their clergy...--yorick, foreseeing the sentence was likely
to end with no sort of mercy, laid his hand upon my father's breast, and

i infer, an' please your worship, replied trim, that the radical
moisture is nothing in the world but ditch-water--and that the radical
heat, of those who can go to the expence of it, is burnt brandy,--the
radical heat and moisture of a private man, an' please your honour, is
nothing but ditch-water--and a dram of geneva--and give us but enough
of it, with a pipe of tobacco, to give us spirits, and drive away the
vapours--we know not what it is to fear death.

i am at a loss, captain shandy, quoth doctor slop, to determine in which
branch of learning your servant shines most, whether in physiology or
divinity.--slop had not forgot trim's comment upon the sermon.--

it is but an hour ago, replied yorick, since the corporal was examined
in the latter, and passed muster with great honour.--

learned all the sciences and liberal arts without being taught any one
of them?--what shall we say of the great piereskius?--that's the very

a matter of five hundred miles, reckoning from paris to shevling, and
from shevling back again, merely to see stevinus's flying chariot.--he
was a very great man! added my uncle toby (meaning stevinus)--he was so,
brother toby, said my father (meaning piereskius)--and had multiplied
his ideas so fast, and increased his knowledge to such a prodigious
stock, that, if we may give credit to an anecdote concerning him, which
we cannot withhold here, without shaking the authority of all a

moderate, and gentle-tempered, and good? said yorick:--and why not,
cried my uncle toby, free, and generous, and bountiful, and brave?--he

his hand.--then, brother shandy, answered my uncle toby, raising himself
off the chair, and laying down his pipe to take hold of my father's
other hand,--i humbly beg i may recommend poor le fever's son to you;--a
tear of joy of the first water sparkled in my uncle toby's eye, and
another, the fellow to it, in the corporal's, as the proposition was
made;--you will see why when you read le fever's story:--fool that i

matter with me, an' please your honour? nothing in the world, trim,
said my uncle toby, blowing his nose,--but that thou art a good-natured
fellow.

when i gave him the toast, continued the corporal, i thought it was
proper to tell him i was captain shandy's servant, and that your honour
(though a stranger) was extremely concerned for his father;--and that
if there was any thing in your house or cellar--(and thou might'st have
added my purse too, said my uncle toby),--he was heartily welcome to
it:--he made a very low bow (which was meant to your honour), but no
answer--for his heart was full--so he went up stairs with the toast;--i

lieutenant.

he did not offer to speak to me, till i had walked up close to his
bed-side:--if you are captain shandy's servant, said he, you must
present my thanks to your master, with my little boy's thanks along
with them, for his courtesy to me;--if he was of levens's--said the

toby thought my father at first somewhat fanciful in the accomplishments
he required, he forbore mentioning le fever's name,--till the character,

gentle-tempered, and generous, and good, it impressed the image of
le fever, and his interest, upon my uncle toby so forcibly, he rose
instantly off his chair; and laying down his pipe, in order to take hold
of both my father's hands--i beg, brother shandy, said my uncle toby,
i may recommend poor le fever's son to you--i beseech you do, added
yorick--he has a good heart, said my uncle toby--and a brave one too,
an' please your honour, said the corporal.

toby.--and the greatest cowards, an' please your honour, in our
regiment, were the greatest rascals in it.--there was serjeant kumber,

and shifting his pillow a little towards my mother's, as he opened the
debate--we should begin to think, mrs. shandy, of putting this boy into
breeches.--

we should so,--said my mother.--we defer it, my dear, quoth my father,
shamefully.--

i think we do, mr. shandy,--said my mother.

--not but the child looks extremely well, said my father, in his vests
and tunicks.--

--he does look very well in them,--replied my mother.--

him out of 'em.--

(the dialogue ceased for a moment.)

--i am very short myself,--continued my father gravely.

you are very short, mr. shandy,--said my mother.

humph! quoth my father to himself, a second time: in muttering which, he
plucked his pillow a little further from my mother's,--and turning about
again, there was an end of the debate for three minutes and a half.

--when he gets these breeches made, cried my father in a higher tone,
he'll look like a beast in 'em.

he will be very awkward in them at first, replied my mother.

time, he shall have no pockets in them.--

i mean in his coat and waistcoat,--cried my father.

--i mean so too,--replied my mother.

--though if he gets a gig or top--poor souls! it is a crown and a
sceptre to them,--they should have where to secure it.--

order it as you please, mr. shandy, replied my mother.--

--but don't you think it right? added my father, pressing the point home
to her.

perfectly, said my mother, if it pleases you, mr. shandy.--

--there's for you! cried my father, losing his temper--pleases me!--you
never will distinguish, mrs. shandy, nor shall i ever teach you to do
it, betwixt a point of pleasure and a point of convenience.--this was on
the sunday night:--and further this chapter sayeth not.

 a short time, these led the way for a train
of somewhat larger,--and so on--(as must always be the case in
hobby-horsical affairs) from pieces of half an inch bore, till it came
at last to my father's jack boots.

the next year, which was that in which lisle was besieged, and at the
close of which both ghent and bruges fell into our hands,--my uncle
toby was sadly put to it for proper ammunition;--i say proper
ammunition--because his great artillery would not bear powder; and 'twas
well for the shandy family they would not--for so full were the papers,
from the beginning to the end of the siege, of the incessant firings
kept up by the besiegers,--and so heated was my uncle toby's imagination
with the accounts of them, that he had infallibly shot away all his
estate.

something therefore was wanting as a succedaneum, especially in one or
two of the more violent paroxysms of the siege, to keep up something
like a continual firing in the imagination,--and this something, the
corporal, whose pri

i love them;--thou knowest the secrets of my heart, and that i would

thou hast but a dozen in the world,--and 'twill break thy set.--

no matter for that, eugenius; i would give the shirt off my back to be

many sparks at one good stroke, a good flint and steel could strike

my brother toby's justification of his own principles and conduct in
wishing to continue the war.

i may safely say, i have read over this apologetical oration of my uncle
toby's a hundred times, and think it so fine a model of defence,--and
shews so sweet a temperament of gallantry and good principles in him,
that i give it the world, word for word (interlineations and all), as i
find it.



chapter 3.lxxv.

my uncle toby's apologetical oration.

i am not insensible, brother shandy, that when a man whose profession
is arms, wishes, as i have done, for war,--it has an ill aspect to the
world;--and that, how just and right soever his motives the intentions
may be,--he stands in an uneasy posture in vindicating himself from
private views in doing it.

for this cause, if a soldier is a prudent man, which he may be without
being a jot the less brave, he will be sure not to utter his wish in
the hearing of an enemy; for say what he will, an enemy will not believe
him.--he will 
 
 ___________________________
 
be cautious of doing it even to a friend,--lest he may
suffer in his esteem:--but if his heart is overcharged, and a secret
sigh for arms must have its vent, he will reserve it for the ear of
a brother, who knows his character to the bottom, and what his true
notions, dispositions, and principles of honour are: what, i hope, i
have been in all these, brother shandy, would be unbecoming in me to
say:--much worse, i know, have i been than i ought,--and something
worse, perhaps, than i think: but such as i am, you, my dear brother
shandy, who have sucked the same breasts with me,--and with whom i have
been brought up from my cradle,--and from whose knowledge, from the
first hours of our boyish pastimes, down to this, i have concealed
no one action of my life, and scarce a thought in it--such as i am,
brother, you must by this time know me, with all my vices,
 
 ___________________________
 
 and with
all my weaknesses too, whether of my age, my temper, my passions, or my
understanding.

tell me then, my dear brother shandy, upon which of them it is, that
when i condemned the peace of utrecht, and grieved the war was not
carried on with vigour a little longer, you should think your brother
did it upon unworthy views; or that in wishing for war, he should be bad
enough to wish more of his fellow-creatures slain,--more slaves made,
and more families driven from their peaceful habitations, merely for his
own pleasure:--tell me, brother shandy, upon what one deed of mine do
you ground it? (the devil a deed do i know o

hundred pounds, which i lent thee to carry on these cursed sieges.)

if, when i was a school-boy, i could not hear a drum beat, but my heart
beat with it--was it my fault?--did i plant the propensity there?--did i
sound the alarm within, or nature?

when guy, earl of warwick, and parismus and parismenus, and valentine
and orson, and the seven champions of england, were handed around the
school,--were they not all purchased with my own pocket-money? was that
selfish, brother shandy? when we read over the siege of troy, which
lasted ten years and eight months,--though with such a train of
artillery as we had at namur, the town might have been carried in a
week--was i not as much concerned for the destruction of the greeks and
trojans as any boy of the whole school? had i not three strokes of a
ferula given me, two on my right hand, and one on my left, for calling
helena a bitch for it? did any one of you shed more tears for hector?
and when king priam came to the camp to b

weeping back to troy without it,--you know, brother, i could not eat my
dinner.--

--did that bespeak me cruel? or because, brother shandy, my blood flew
out into the camp, and my heart panted for war,--was it a proof it could
not ache for the distresses of war too?

o brother! 'tis one thing for a soldier to gather laurels,--and 'tis
another to scatter cypress.--(who told thee, my dear toby, that cypress
was used by the antients on mournful occasions?)

--'tis one thing, brother shandy, for a soldier to hazard his own
life--to leap first down into the trench, where he is sure to be cut in
pieces:--'tis one thing, from public spir

it and a thirst of glory, to
enter the breach the first man,--to stand in the foremost rank, and
march bravely on with drums and trumpets, and colours flying about his
ears:--'tis one thing, i say, brother shandy, to do this,--and
'tis another thing to reflect on the miseries of war;--to view the
desolations of whole countries, and consider the intolerable fatigues
and hardships which the soldier himself, the instrument who works them,
is forced (for sixpence a day, if he can get it) to undergo.

need i be told, dear yorick, as i was by you, in le fever's funeral
sermon, that so soft and gentle a creature, born to love, to mercy, and
kindness, as man is, was not shaped for this?--but why did you not add

yorick,--if not by nature--that he is so by necessity?--for what is war?
what is it, yorick, when fought as ours has been, upon principles of
liberty, and upon principles of honour--what is it, but the getting
together of quiet and harmless people, with their swords in their hands,
to keep the ambitious and the turbulent within bounds? and heaven is
my witness, brother shandy, that the pleasure i have taken in these
things,--and that infinite delight, in particular, which has attended
my sieges in my bowling-green, has arose within me, and i hope in the
corporal too, from the consciousness we both had, that in carrying them
on, we were answering the great ends of our creation.

chapter 4.xxxii.

my uncle toby and the corporal had posted down with so much heat and
precipitation, to take possession of the spot of ground we have so often
spoke of, in order to open their campaign as early as the rest of the
allies; that they had forgot one of the most necessary articles of the
whole affair, it was neither a pioneer's spade, a pickax, or a shovel--

--it was a bed to lie on: so that as shandy-hall was at that time
unfurnished; and the little inn where poor le fever died, not yet built;
my uncle toby was constrained to accept of a bed at mrs. wadman's, for
a night or two, till corporal trim (who to the character of an excellent
valet, groom, cook, sempster, surgeon, and engineer, super-added that of
an excellent upholsterer too), with the help of a carpenter and a couple
of taylors, constructed one in my uncle toby's house.

did it out of good-nature.

--she often told me, quoth trim, she did it for the love of christ--i
did not like it.--i believe, trim, we are both wrong, said my uncle
toby--we'll ask mr. yorick about it to-night at my brother shandy's--so
put me in mind; added my uncle toby.

the young beguine, continued the corporal, had scarce given herself time
to tell me 'she would be my nurse,' when she hastily turned about to
begin the office of one, and prepare something for me--and in a short
time--though i thought it a long one--she came back with flannels, &c.
&c. and having fomented my knee soundly for a couple of hours, &c. and
made me a thin bason of gruel for my supper--she wish'd me rest, and

in the attack of the sentry-box, was so outdone by that of the fair
beguine's, in trim's story--that just then, that particular attack,
however successful before--became the most heartless attack that could
be made--

o! let woman alone for this. mrs. wadman had scarce open'd the
wicker-gate, when her genius sported with the change of circumstances.

--she formed a new attack in a moment.



chapter 4.xlviii.

--i am half distracted, captain shandy, said mrs. wadman, holding up her
cambrick handkerchief to her left eye, as she approach'd the door of my
uncle toby's sentry-box--a mote--or sand--or something--i know not what,
has got into this eye of mine--do look into it--it is not in the white--

in saying which, mrs. wadman edged herself close in beside my uncle
toby, and squeezing herself down upon the corner of his bench, she gave
him an opportunity of doing it without rising up--do look into it--said
she.

honest soul! thou didst look

romping or a wanton one--nor
was it an eye sparkling--petulant or imperious--of high claims and
terrifying exactions, which would have curdled at once that milk of
human nature, of which my uncle toby was made up--but 'twas an eye
full of gentle salutations--and soft responses--speaking--not like the
trumpet stop of some ill-made organ, in which many an eye i talk to,
holds coarse converse--but whispering soft--like the last low accent of
an expiring saint--'how can you live comfortless, captain shandy, and
alone, without a bosom to lean your head on--or trust your cares to?'

it was an eye--

but i shall be in love with it myself, if i say another word about it.

--it did my uncle toby's business.



chapter 4.l.

there is nothing shews the character of my father and my uncle toby, in
a more entertaining light, than their different manner of deportment,
under the same accident--for i call not love a misfortune, from a
persuasion, that a man's heart is ever the better for it--great god!

sat solitary and pensive with his pipe--looking at his lame leg--then
whiffing out a sentimental heigh ho! which mixing with the smoke,
incommoded no one mortal.

he took it like a lamb--i say.

in truth he had mistook it at first; for having taken a ride with my
father, that very morning, to save if possible a beautiful wood, which
the dean and chapter were hewing down to give to the poor (mr. shandy
must mean the poor in spirit; inasmuch as they divided the money amongst
themselves.); which said wood being in full view of my uncle toby's
house, and of singular service to him in his description of the battle
of wynnendale--by trotting on too hastily to save it--upon an uneasy
saddle--worse horse, &c. &c...it had so happened, that the serous part
of the blood had got betwixt the two skins, in the nethermost part of
my uncle toby--the first shootings of which (as my uncle toby had no

choice of words, had enquired after the part by its proper name: so
notwithstanding my mother, doctor slop, and mr. yorick, were sitting in
the parlour, he thought it rather civil to conform to the term my father
had made use of than not. when a man is hemm'd in by two indecorums, and
must commit one of 'em--i always observe--let him chuse which he will,
the world will blame him--so i should not be astonished if it blames my
uncle toby.

my a..e, quoth my uncle toby, is much better--brother shandy--my father
had formed great expectations from his asse in this onset; and would
have brought him on again; but doctor slop setting up an intemperate
laugh--and my mother crying out l... bless us!--it drove my father's
asse off the field--and the laugh then becoming general--there was no
bringing him back to the charge, for some time--

and so the discourse went on without him.

every body, said my mother, says you are in love, brother toby,--and we
hope it is true.

i am as much in love, sister

my uncle toby's reply put my father into good temper--so he charg'd o'
foot.



chapter 4.lvii.

as the ancients agree, brother toby, said my father, that there are two
different and distinct kinds of love, according to the different parts
which are affected by it--the brain or liver--i think when a man is in
love, it behoves him a little to consider which of the two he is fallen
into.

what signifies it, brother shandy, replied my uncle toby, which of the
two it is, provided it will but make a man marry, and love his wife, and
get a few children?

--a few children! cried my father, rising out of his chair, and looking
full in my mother's face, as he forced his way betwixt her's and doctor
slop's--a few children! cried my father, repeating my uncle toby's words
as he walk'd to and fro--

--not, my dear brother toby, cried my father, recovering himself all at
once, and coming close up to the back of my uncle to

snuff.

now i would not, quoth my uncle toby, get a child, nolens, volens, that
is, whether i would or no, to please the greatest prince upon earth--

--and 'twould be cruel in me, brother toby, to compel thee; said my
father--but 'tis a case put to shew thee, that it is not thy begetting
a child--in case thou should'st be able--but the system of love and
marriage thou goest upon, which i would set thee right in--

there is at least, said yorick, a great deal of reason and plain sense
in captain shandy's opinion of love; and 'tis amongst the ill-spent
hours of my life, which i have to answer for, that i have read so many
flourishing poets and rhetoricians in my time, from whom i never could
extract so much--i wish, yorick, said my father, you had read plato;
for there you would have learnt that there are two loves--i know there
were two religions, replied yorick, amongst the ancients--one--for the
vulgar, and another for the learned;--but i think one love might have
served both of them very w

had it been the good pleasure of him who disposes of our lots--and
thou no sufferer by the knowledge, i had been well content that thou
should'st have dipp'd the pen this moment into the ink, instead of

me, preparing for bed--i have thrown together without order, and just as
they have come into my mind, such hints and documents as i deem may be
of use to thee; intending, in this, to give thee a token of my love; not
doubting, my dear toby, of the manner in which it will be accepted.

in the first place, with regard to all which concerns religion in the
affair--though i perceive from a glow in my cheek, that i blush as
i begin to speak to thee upon the subject, as well kn

the stead of them.

there is nothing further for thee, which occurs to me at present--

toby, for best,

chapter 4.lix.

whilst my father was writing his letter of instructions, my uncle toby
and the corporal were busy in preparing every thing for the attack. as
the turning of the thin scarlet breeches was laid aside (at least for
the present), there was nothing which should put it off beyond the next
morning; so accordingly it was resolv'd upon, for eleven o'clock.

come, my dear, said my father to my mother--'twill be but like a brother
and sister, if you and i take a walk down to my brother

said my mother.

--particularly the cuvetts; replied my father.

'tis enough--he tasted the sweet of triumph--and went on.

--not that they are, properly speaking, mrs. wadman's premises, said my
father, partly correcting himself--because she is but tenant for life--

--that makes a great difference--said my mother--

--in a fool's head, replied my father--

unless she should happen to have a child--said my mother--

--but she must persuade my brother toby first to get her one--

to be sure, mr. shandy, quoth my mother.

--though if it comes to persuasion--said my father--lord have mercy upon
them.

amen: said my mother, piano.

amen: cried my father, fortissime.

amen: said my mother again--but with such a sighing cadence of personal
pity at the end of it, as discomfited every fibre about my father--he
instantly took out his almanack; but before he could untie it, yorick's
congregation coming out of church, became a full answer to one half
of his business with it--and my mother telling him i

 wherein silence on one
side or the other, generally becomes indecent: so edging herself a
little more towards him, and raising up her eyes, sub blushing, as
she did it--she took up the gauntlet--or the discourse (if you like it
better) and communed with my uncle toby, thus:

the cares and disquietudes of the marriage state, quoth mrs. wadman,
are very great. i suppose so--said my uncle toby: and therefore when
a person, continued mrs. wadman, is so much at his ease as you are--so
happy, captain shandy, in yourself, your friends and your amusements--i
wonder, what reasons can incline you to the state--

--they are written, quoth my uncle toby, in the common-prayer book.

thus far my uncle toby went on warily, and kept within his depth,
leaving mrs. wadman to sail upon the gulph as she pleased.

--as for children--said mrs. wadman--though a principal end perhaps of
the institution, and the natural wish, i suppose, of every parent--yet
do not we all find, they are certain sorrows, and very unce

-nor does any body wonder, if he goes on and asks

it was just as natural for mrs. wadman, whose first husband was all his
time afflicted with a sciatica, to wish to know how far from the hip
to the groin; and how far she was likely to suffer more or less in her
feelings, in the one case than in the other.

she had accordingly read drake's anatomy from one end to the other. she
had peeped into wharton upon the brain, and borrowed graaf (this must be
a mistake in mr. shandy; for graaf wrote upon the pancreatick juice,
and the parts of generation.) upon the bones and muscles; but could make
nothing of it.

she had reason'd likewise from her own powers--laid down theorems--drawn
consequences, and come to no conclusion.

to clear up all, she had twice asked doctor slop, 'if poor captain
shandy was ever likely to recover of his wound--?'

--he is recovered, doctor slop would say--

what! quite?

quite: madam--

but what do you mean by a recovery? mrs. wadman would say

distinctly, as he assigned his reason--

'the knee is such a distance from the main body--whereas the groin, your
honour knows, is upon the very curtain of the place.'

my uncle toby gave a long whistle--but in a note which could scarce be
heard across the table.

the corporal had advanced too far to retire--in three words he told the
rest--

my uncle toby laid down his pipe as gently upon the fender, as if it had
been spun from the unravellings of a spider's web--

--let us go to my brother shandy's, said he.



chapter 4.xci.

there will be just time, whilst my uncle toby and trim are walking to
my father's, to inform you that mrs. wadman had, some moons before this,
made a confident of my mother; and that mrs. bridget, who had the burden
of her own, as well as her mistress's secret to carry, had got happily
delivered of both to susannah behind the garden-wall.

as for my mother, she saw nothing at all in it, to make the least bustle
about--but susannah was sufficient by herself for all
