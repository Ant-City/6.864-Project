 found two features common to all these forces. first, as
we will discuss in chapter 5, at a microscopic level all the forces have an associated particle that
you can think of as being the smallest packet or bundle of the force. if you fire a laser beam—an
"electromagnetic  ray  gun"—you  are  firing  a  stream  of photons,  the  smallest  bundles  of  the
electromagnetic  force.  similarly,  the  smallest  constituents  of  weak  and  strong  force  fields  are
particles  called weak gauge bosons  and gluons.  (the  name gluon is particularly descriptive: you
can think of gluons as the microscopic ingredient in the strong glue holding atomic nuclei together.)
by 1984 experimenters had definitively established the existence and the detailed properties of these
three kinds of force particles, recorded in table 1.2. physicists believe that the gravitational force
also  has  an  associated  particle—the  graviton—but  its  existence  has  yet  to  be  confirmed
experimentally.

measured  these  properties,  no  one  has  any  explanation  of why  our  universe  is  composed  of  these
particular particles, with these particular masses and force charges.

serves only to compound the questions. why, for instance, are there four

messenger particles

according to the standard model, just as the photon is the smallest constituent of an electromagnetic
field, the strong and the weak force fields have smallest constituents as well. as we discussed briefly
in chapter 1, the smallest bundles of the strong force are known as gluons, and those of the weak
force are known as weak gauge bosons (or more precisely, the w and z bosons). the standard model
instructs us to think of these force particles as having no internal structure—in this framework they
are every bit as elementary as the particles in the three families of matter.

the  photons,  gluons,  and  weak  gauge  bosons  provide  the  microscopic  mechanism  for
transmitting  the  forces  they  constitute.  for  example,  when  one  electrically  charged  particle  repels
another of like electric charge, you can think of i

 photon  is  not  so  much  the  transmitter  of  the  force  per  se,  but  rather  the
transmitter of a message of how the recipient must respond to the force in question. for like-charged
particles,  the  photon  carries  the  message  "move  apart,"  while  for  oppositely  charged  particles  it
carries  the  message  "come  together."  for  this  reason  the  photon  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the
messenger particle for the electromagnetic force. similarly, the gluons and weak gauge bosons are
the messenger particles for the strong and weak nuclear forces. the strong force, which keeps quarks
locked  up  inside  of  protons  and  neutrons,  arises  from  individual  quarks  exchanging  gluons.  the
gluons, so to speak, provide the "glue" that keeps these subatomic particles stuck together. the weak
force, which is responsible for certain kinds of particle transmutations involved in radioactive decay,
is mediated by the weak gauge bosons.

lthough  the  reasoning  involved  is  somewhat  more  abstract,  physicists  have  found  that  a  similar
alignment exists between other detailed aspects of a string's pattern of vibration and its properties vis
a vis other forces. the electric charge, the weak charge, and the strong charge carried by a particular
string, for instance, are determined by the precise way it vibrates. moreover, exactly the same idea
holds for the messenger particles themselves. particles like photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons
are yet other resonant patterns of string vibration. and of particular importance, among the vibrational
string patterns, one matches perfectly the properties of the graviton, ensuring that gravity is an integral
part of string theory.7

so we see that, according to string theory, the observed properties of each elementary particle
arise because its internal string undergoes a particular resonant vibrational pattern. this perspective
differs sharply from that espoused by physicists

out the three families of
table 1.1. this is true down to the last detail: all of the matter particles (and their antimatter partners
as well) have spin equal to that of the electron. in the language of the trade, physicists say that matter
particles  all  have  "spin-1/2,"  where  the  value  1/2  is,  roughly  speaking,  a  quantum-mechanical
measure  of  how  quickly  the  particles  rotate.2  moreover,  physicists  have  shown  that  the
nongravitational force carriers—photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—also possess an intrinsic
spinning characteristic that turns out to be twice that of the matter particles. they all have "spin-1."

what  about  gravity?  well,  even  before  string  theory,  physicists  were  able  to  determine  what
spin the hypothesized graviton must have to be the transmitter of the gravitational force. the answer:
twice the spin of photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—i.e., "spin-2."

partner  of  the  electron;  this  hypothetical  particle  has  been  named  the selectron  (a  contraction  of
supersymmetric-electron).  the  same  should  also  be  true  for  the  other  matter  particles,  with,  for
example, the hypothetical spin-0 superpartners of neutrinos and quarks being called sneutrinos and
squarks. similarly, the force particles should have spin-1/2 superpartners: for photons there should
be photinos, for the gluons there should be gluinos, for the w and z bosons there should be winos and
zinos.

on  closer  inspection,  then,  supersymmetry  seems  to  be  a  terribly  uneconomical  feature;  it

ingredients. since none of the superpartner particles has ever been detected, you would be justified to

thickness  of  an  amoeba.  although  numerical  adjustments  of  an  analogous  precision  can  be  made
within  the  standard  model,  many  physicists  are  quite  suspect  of  a  theory  that  is  so  delicately
constructed that it falls apart if a number on which it depends is changed in the fifteenth digit after the
decimal point.5

supersymmetry  changes  this  drastically  because bosons—particles  whose  spin  is  a  whole
number (named after the indian physicist satyendra bose)—and fermions—particles whose spin is
half  of  a  whole  (odd)  number  (named  after  the  italian  physicist  enrico  fermi)—tend  to  give
cancelling  quantum-mechanical  contributions.  like  opposite  ends  of  a  seesaw,  when  the  quantum
jitters  of  a  boson  are  positive,  those  of  a  fermion  tend  to  be  negative,  and  vice  versa.  since

immensely when we consider its role in string theory.

supersymmetry in string theory

the original string theory that emerged from veneziano's work in the late 1960s incorporated all of
the symmetries discussed at the beginning of this chapter, but it did not incorporate supersymmetry
(which  had  not  yet  been  discovered).  this  first  theory  based  on  the  string  concept  was,  more
precisely,  called  the bosonic string theory.  the  name bosonic  indicates  that  all  of  the  vibrational
patterns of the bosonic string have spins that are a whole number—there are no fermionic patterns,
that is, no patterns with spins differing from a whole number by a half unit. this led to two problems.
first,  if  string  theory  was  to  describe  all  forces  and  all  matter,  it  would  somehow  have  to
incorporate  fermionic  vibrational  patterns,  since  the  known  matter  particles  all  have  spin-1/2.

second, and far more troubling, was the realization that there was one pattern of vibration in bosonic
string theory whose mass (more precisely, whose mass squared) was negative—a so-called tachyon.
even before string theory, physicists had studied the possibility that our world might have tachyon
particles, in addition to the familiar particles that all have positive masses, but their efforts showed
that it is difficult if not impossible for such a theory to be logically sensible. similarly, in the context
of  bosonic  string  theory,  physicists  tried  all  sorts  of  fancy  footwork  to 
 
 ___________________________
 
 make  sense  of  the  bizarre
prediction of a tachyon vibrational pattern, but to no avail. these features made it increasingly clear
that although it was an interesting theory, the bosonic string was missing something essential.

in  1971,  pierre  ramond  of  the  university  of  florida  took  up  the  challenge  of  modifying  the
bosonic  string  theory  to  include  fermionic  patterns  of  vibration.  through  his  work  and  subsequent
results of schwarz and andre neveu, a new version of string theory began to emerge. and much to
everyone's surprise, the bosonic and the fermionic patterns of vibration of this new theory appeared
to come in pairs. for each bosonic pattern there was a fermionic pattern, and vice versa. by 1977,
insights  of  ferdinando  gliozzi  of  the  university  of  turin,  scherk,  and  david  olive  of

college put this pairing into the proper light. the new string theory incorporated supersymmetry, and
the  observed  pairing  of  bosonic  and  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  reflected  this  highly  symmetric
character. supersymmetric string theory—superstring theory, that is—had been born. moreover, the
work of gliozzi, scherk, and olive had one other crucial result: they showed that the troublesome
tachyon vibration of the bosonic string does not afflict the superstring. slowly, the pieces of the string
puzzle were falling into place.

nevertheless, the major initial impact of the work of ramond, and also of neveu and schwarz,
was not actually in string theory. by 1973, the physicists julius wess and bruno zumino realized that
supersymmetry—the new symmetry emerging from the reformulation of string theory—was applicable
even to theories based on point particles. they rapidly made important strides toward incorporat

fundamental explanations, more is definitely less.

by  1985,  string  theory—notwithstanding  the  justified  excitement  it  was  engendering—was
starting to sound like our overzealous earhart expert. the reason is that by 1985 physicists realized
that  supersymmetry,  by  then  a  central  element  in  the  structure  of  string  theory,  could  actually  be
incorporated into string theory in not one but five different ways. each method results in a pairing of
bosonic and fermionic vibrational patterns, but the details of this pairing as well as numerous other
properties of the resulting theories differ substantially. although their names are not all that important,
it's worth recording that these five supersymmetric string theories are called the type i theory, the
type iia theory, the type iib theory, the heterotic type o(32) theory (pronounced "oh-thirty-two"),
and the heterotic type e8 × e8 theory (pronounced "e-eight times e-eight"). all the features

e  was  that  the  inconsistencies  between
point-particle  theories  involving  gravity  and  quantum  mechanics  would  be  overcome  by  studying
theories with a great deal of symmetry. in 1976 stanley deser and bruno zumino working at cern,
and independantly, daniel freedman, sergio ferrara, and peter van nieuwenhuizen, all then of the
state  university  of  new  york  at  stony  brook,  discovered  that  the  most  promising  were  those
involving  supersymmetry,  since  the  tendency  of  bosons  and  fermions  to  give  cancelling  quantum
fluctuations helps to calm the violent microscopic frenzy. the authors coined the term supergravity to
describe  supersymmetric  quantum  field  theories  that  try  to  incorporate  general  relativity.  such
attempts  to  merge  general  relativity  with  quantum  mechanics  ultimately  met  with  failure.
nevertheless,  as  mentioned  in  chapter  8,  there  was  a  prescient  lesson  to  be  learned  from  these
investigations, one that presage

6. the standard model does suggest a mechanism by which particles acquire mass—the higgs
mechanism, named after the scottish physicist peter higgs. but from the point of view of explaining
the particle masses, this merely shifts the burden to explaining properties of a hypothetical "mass-
giving particle"—the so-called higgs boson. experimental searches for this particle are underway,
but once again, if it is found and its properties measured, these will be input data for the standard
model, for which the theory offers no explanation.

7.  for  the  mathematically  inclined  reader,  we  note  that  the  association  between  string
vibrational patterns and force charges can be described more precisely as follows. when the motion
of a string is quantized, its possible vibrational states are represented by vectors in a hi

 note that this extension involves augmenting the
familiar  cartesian  coordinates  of  spacetime  with  new  quantum  coordinates,  say u  and v,  that  are
anticommuting: u × v =-v × u. supersymmetry can then be thought of as translations in this quantum-
mechanically augmented form of spacetime.

5. for the reader interested in more details of this technical issue we note the following. in note
6 of chapter 6 we mentioned that the standard model invokes a "mass-giving particle"—the higgs
boson—to endow the particles of tables 1.1 and 1.2 with their observed masses. for this procedure
to work, the higgs particle itself cannot be too heavy; studies show that its mass should certainly be
no greater than about 1,000 times the mass of a proton. but it turns out that quantum fluctuations tend
to contribute substantially to the mass of the higgs particle, potentially driving its mass all the way to
the planck scale. theorists have found, however, that this outcome, which would uncover a m

ame chirality), whereas in the type iia theory, they spin in both
directions  (they  have  both  chiralities).  nevertheless,  each  theory  incorporates  supersymmetry.  the
two  heterotic  theories  differ  in  a  similar  but  more  dramatic  way.  each  of  their  clockwise  string
vibrations looks like those of the type ii string (when focusing on just the clockwise vibrations, the
type iia and type iib theories are the same), but their counterclockwise vibrations are those of the
original bosonic string theory. although the bosonic string has insurmountable problems when chosen
for  both  clockwise  and  counterclockwise  string  vibrations,  in  1985  david  gross,  jeffrey  harvey,
emil martinec, and ryan rhom (all then at princeton university and dubbed the "princeton string
quartet") showed that a perfectly sensible theory emerges if it is used in combination with the type ii
string.  the  really  odd  feature  of  this  union  is  that  it  has  been  known  since  the  work  of

1972  that  the  bosonic  string  requires  a  26-dimensional  spacetime,  whereas  the  superstring,  as  we
have  discussed,  requires  a  10-dimensional  one.  so  the  heterotic  string  constructions  are  a  strange
hybrid—a heterosis—in  which  counterclockwise  vibrational  patterns  live  in  26  dimensions  and
clockwise patterns live in 10 dimensions! before you get caught up in trying to make sense of this
perplexing union, gross and his collaborators showed that the extra 16 dimensions on the bosonic

side must be curled up into one of two very special higher-dimensional doughnutlike shapes, giving

rise to the heterotic-o and heterotic-e theories. since the extra 16 dimensions on the bosonic side
are rigidly curled up, each of these theories behaves as though it really has 10 dimensions, just as in
the type ii case. again, both heterotic theories incorporate a version of supersymmetry. finally, the
type i theory is a close cousin of the type iib string except that, in addition to the closed loops of
string we have discussed in previous chapters, it also has strings with unconnected ends—so-called
open strings.
