dr.[CHARACTER] 
throughout iola leroy, dr.[CHARACTER] remains passionately
committed to the social cause of empowering blacks, and unlike dr. gresham, he
lives his beliefs. though he is a mulatto who appears white, he decides to pass
as black and to relinquish his white grandmother's inheritance. he sacrifices
his lucrative medical practice in the north to serve the needy in the south.
passing as white would have given dr.[CHARACTER] a comfortable upper-class
existence, but he freely chooses a life fraught with toil. the fact that dr.
latimer is a learned scholar and a doctor who presents his research at
conferences demonstrates blacks' intelligence, and his nobility and purity
overturn the nineteenth-century misconception that blacks were inferior to
whites. through dr.[CHARACTER], harper attempts to reverse ingrained cultural and
social assumptions about blacks' status as unequal. 
dr.[CHARACTER] also helps emphasize and promote black authorship and
scholarly contributions. he urges iola to write a book for a black audience and
encourages her to be a voice for her race and a model for what it can attain.
dr.[CHARACTER] attests to the idea that blacks must create their own literature and
scholarship to shape a legacy of intellectual achievement. in addition,
according to dr.[CHARACTER], white authors cannot satisfactorily write about
blacks' history and life experience. he attempts to inspire iola to accomplish
what harper herself realized through her career as a poet, novelist, essayist,
and orator. indeed, dr.[CHARACTER]'s deep respect for iola, her pursuit of
knowledge, and her socially conscious contributions to society eventually
becomes love. theirs is an intellectualized romance, and harper deliberately
fashions the relationship as such to reinforce to her audience blacks'
intelligence and purity.
