Octavius - 
                Caesar's
adopted son and appointed successor. Octavius, who had been traveling
abroad, returns after Caesar's death; he then joins with Antony
and sets off to fight Cassius and Brutus. Antony tries to control Octavius's
movements, but Octavius follows his adopted father's example and
emerges as the authoritative figure, paving the way for his eventual seizure
of the reins of Roman government.
