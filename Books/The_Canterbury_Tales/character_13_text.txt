to sue in his name defaulters and offenders against the imposts
which he was charged to enforce. one of these trustees was
called richard forrester; the other was john gower, the poet,
the most famous english contemporary of chaucer, with whom
he had for many years been on terms of admiring friendship --
although, from the strictures passed on certain productions of
gower's in the prologue to the man of law's tale,<6> it has
been supposed that in the later years of chaucer's life the
friendship suffered some diminution. to the "moral gower" and
"the philosophical strode," chaucer "directed" or dedicated his
"troilus and cressida;" <7> while, in the "confessio amantis,"
gower introduces a handsome compliment to his greater
contemporary, as the "disciple and the poet" of venus, with
whose glad songs and ditties, made in her praise during the
flowers of his youth, the land was filled everywhere.  gow

gaunt, in the end of 1371, married his second wife, constance,

age. see the introductory notes to it and to the legend of good

notes to the prologue


1. tyrwhitt points out that "the bull" should be read  here, not
"the ram," which would place the time of  the pilgrimage in the
end of march; whereas, in the prologue to the man of law's
tale, the date is given as the "eight and  twenty day of april,
that is messenger to may."

2. dante, in the "vita nuova," distinguishes three classes of
pilgrims: palmieri - palmers who go beyond  sea to the east,
and often bring back staves of palm-wood; peregrini, who go
the shrine of st jago in galicia; romei, who go to rome.   sir
walter scott, however, says that palmers were in the habit of
passing from shrine to shrine, living on charity -- pilgrims on the
other hand, made the journey

4. the cook's tale is unfinished in all the manuscripts; but in
some, of minor authority, the cook is made to break off his
tale, because "it is so foul," and to tell the story of gamelyn, on
which shakespeare's "as you like it" is founded. the story is
not chaucer's, and is different in metre, and inferior in
composition to the tales. it is supposed that chaucer expunged
the cook's tale for the same reason that made him on his death-
bed lament that he had written so much "ribaldry."

the prologue.


our hoste saw well that the brighte sun
th' arc of his artificial day had run

and, though he were not deep expert in lore,
he wist it was the eight-and-twenty day
of april, that is messenger to may;
and saw well that the shadow of every tree
was in its length of the same quantity
that was the body erect that caused it;
and therefore by the shadow he took his wit*,                 *knowledge

and with that word, he with a sober cheer
began his tale, and said as ye shall hear.


notes to the prologue to the man of law's tale


1. plight: pulled; the word is an obsolete past tense from
"pluck."

2. no more than will malkin's maidenhead: a proverbial saying;
which, however, had obtained fresh point from the reeve's
tale, to which the host doubtless refers.

3. de par dieux jeo asente: "by god, i agree".  it is
characteristic that the somewhat pompous sergeant of law
should couch his assent in the semi-barbarous french, then
familiar in law procedure.

notes to the man of law's tale


1. this tale is believed by tyrwhitt to have been taken, with no
material change, from the "confessio amantis" of john gower,
who was contemporary with chaucer, though somewhat his
senior.  in the prologue, the references to the stories of canace,
and of apollonius tyrius, seem to be an attack on gower, who
had given these tales in his book; whence tyrwhitt concludes
that the friendship between the two poets suffered some
interruption in the latter part of their lives.  gower was not t

17. lepe:  a town near cadiz, whence a stronger wine than the
gascon vintages afforded was imported to england. french
wine was often adulterated with the cheaper and stronger
spanish.

and in some passages, especially where husband and wife debate
the merits or demerits of women, and where prudence dilates
on the evils of poverty, chaucer only reproduces much that had
been said already in the tales that preceded -- such as the
merchant's and the man of law's.

latin, which reads:

notes to the court of love


1. so the man of law, in the prologue to his tale, is made to
say that chaucer "can but lewedly (ignorantly or imperfectly) on
metres and on rhyming craftily." but the humility of those
apologies is not justified by the care and finish of his earlier
poems.

2. born: burnish, polish: the poet means, that his verses do not
display the eloquence or brilliancy of cicero in setting forth his
subject-matter.

composition a less flattering allusion is made in

and, since each had made great efforts or sacrifices for love, the
pair are fitly placed as king and queen in the court of love.

12. in the prologue to the "legend of good women," chaucer
says that behind the god of love, upon the green, he "saw
coming in ladies nineteen;" but the stories of only nine good
women are there told. in the prologue to the man of law's
tale, sixteen ladies are named as having their stories written in
the "saints' legend of cupid" -- now known as the "legend of
good women" -- (see note 5 to the prologue to the man of
law's tale); and in the "retractation," at the end of the parson's
tale, the "book of the twenty-five ladies" is enumerated
among the works of which the poet repents -- but there "xxv" is
supposed to have been by some copyist written for "xix."

semiramis was queen of ninus, the mythical founder of

chaucer's dream.


[this pretty allegory, or rather conceit, containing one or two
passages that for vividness and for delicacy yield to nothing in
the whole range of chaucer's poetry, had never been printed
before the year 1597, when it was included in the edition of
speght. before that date, indeed,
