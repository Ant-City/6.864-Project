rty brought with them a huge pot of palm-
wine. and there was eating and drinking till night, when
okonkwo's in-laws began to leave for their homes the second day
of the new year was the day of the great wrestling match between
okonkwo's village and their neighbors. it was difficult to say
which the people enjoyed more, the feasting and fellowship of the
first day or the wrestling contest of the second. but there was one
woman who had no doubt whatever in her mind. she was
okonkwo's second wife ekwefi, whom he nearly shot. there was
no festival in all the seasons of the year which gave her as much
pleasure as the wrestling match. many years ago when she was the
village beauty okonkwo had won her heart by throwing the cat in
the greatest contest within living memory. she did not marry him
then because he was too poor to pay her bride-price. but a few
years later she ran away from her husband and came to live with
okonkwo. all this happened many years ago. now ekwefi was a
woman of forty-five

who had suffered a great deal in her time. but
her love of wrestling contests was still as strong as it was thirty
years ago.

it was not yet noon on the second day of the new yam festival.
ekwefi and her only daughter, ezinma, sat near the fireplace
waiting for the water in the pot to boil. the fowl ekwefi had just
killed was in the wooden mortar. the water began to boil, and in
one deft movement she lifted the pot from the fire and poured the
boiling water over the fowl. she put back the empty pot on the
circular pad in the corner, and looked at her palms, which were
black with soot. ezinma was always surprised that her mother
could lift a pot from the fire with her bare hands.



"ekwefi," she said, "is it true that when people are grown up, fire
does not burn them?" ezinma, unlike most childr

en, called her
mother by her name.



"yes," replied ekwefi, too busy to argue. her daughter was only
ten years old but she was wiser than her years.

"but nwoye's mother dropped her pot of hot soup the other day
and it broke on the floor."

ekwefi turned the hen over in the mortar and began to pluck the
feathers.

"ekwefi," said ezinma, who had joined in plucking the feathers,
"my eyelid is twitching."

"it means you are going to cry," said her mother.

"no," ezinma said, "it is this eyelid, the top one."

"that means you will see something."

"what will i see?" she asked.

"how can i know?" ekwefi wanted her to work it out herself.

"oho," said ezinma at last. "i know what it is—the wrestling
match."

at last the hen was plucked clean. ekwefi tried to pull out the
horny beak but it was too hard. she turned ro

und on her low stool
and put the beak in the fire for a few moments. she pulled again
and it came off.

"ekwefi!" a voice called from one of the other huts. it was
nwoye's mother, okonkwo's first wife.



"is that me?" ekwefi called back. that was the way people
answered calls from outside. they never answered yes for fear it
might be an evil spirit calling.



"will you give ezinma some fire to bring to me?" her own
children and ikemefuna had gone to the stream.

ekwefi put a few live coals into a piece of broken pot and ezinma
carried it across the clean swept compound to nwoye's mother.

"thank you, nma," she said. she was peeling new yams, and in a
basket beside her were green vegetables and beans.

"let me make the fire for you," ezinma offered.

"thank you, ezigbo," she said. she often called her ezigbo, which
means "the good one."

ezinma went outside and brought some sticks from a huge bundle
of firewood. she broke them into little pieces across the sol

wrestling," said ezinma to her mother.

"they will not begin until the sun goes down."

"but they are beating the drums."

"yes. the drums begin at noon but the wrestling waits until the sun
begins to sink. go and see if your father has brought out yams for
the afternoon."

"he has. nwoye's mother is already cooking."

"go and bring our own, then. we must cook quickly or we shall be
late for the wrestling."

ezinma ran in the direction of the barn and brought back two yams
from the dwarf wall.

ekwefi peeled the yams quickly. the troublesome nanny-goat
sniffed about, eating the peelings. she cut the yams into small
pieces and began to prepare a pottage, using some of the chicken.

at that moment they heard someone crying just outside their
compound. it was very much like obiageli, nwoye's sister.

"is that not obiageli weeping?" ekwefi called across the yard to
nwoye's mother.



"yes," she replied. "she must have broken her waterpot."



the weeping was now quite close and soon the childre

d, folded her
arms in front of her and began to sway her waist like a grown-up
young lady. when the pot fell down and broke she burst out
laughing. she only began to weep when they got near the iroko
tree outside their compound.

the drums were still beating, persistent and unchanging. their
sound was no longer a separate thing from the living village. it was
like the pulsation of its heart. it throbbed in the air, in the sunshine,
and even in the trees, and filled the village with excitement.

ekwefi ladled her husband's share of the pottage into a bowl and
covered it. ezinma took it to him in his obi.

okonkwo was sitting on a goatskin already eating his first wife's
meal. obiageli, who had brought it from her mother's hut, sat on
the floor waiting for him to finish. ezinma placed her mother's dish
before him and sat with obiageli.



"sit like a woman!" okonkwo shouted at her. ezinma brought her
two legs together and stretched them in front of her.



"father, will you go to see the wres

sweat, and they took up fans and began to
fan themselves. they also drank water from small pots and ate kola
nuts. they became ordinary human beings again, talking and
laughing among themselves and with others who stood near them.
the air, which had been stretched taut with excitement, relaxed
again. it was as if water had been poured on the tightened skin of a
drum. many people looked around, perhaps for the first time, and
saw those who stood or sat next to them.

"i did not know it was you," ekwefi said to the woman who had
stood shoulder to shoulder with her since the beginning of the
matches.

"i do not blame you," said the woman. "i have never seen such a
large crowd of people. is it true that okonkwo nearly killed you
with his gun?"

"it is true indeed, my dear friend. i cannot yet find a mouth with
which to tell the story."

"your chi is very much awake, my friend. and how is my daughter,
ezinma?"

"she has been very well for some time now. perhaps she has come
to stay."



"i think
 
 ___________________________
 
 she has. how old is she now?"

"she is about ten years old."



"i think she will stay. they usually stay if they do not die before
the age of six."

"i pray she stays," said ekwefi with a heavy sigh.

the woman with whom she talked was called chielo. she was the
priestess of agbala, the oracle of the hills and the caves. in
ordinary life chielo was a widow with two children. she was very
friendly with ekwefi and they shared a common shed in the market.
she was particularly fond of ekwefi's only daughter, ezinma,
whom she called "my daughter." quite often she bought beancakes
and gave ekwefi some to take home to ezinma. anyone seeing
chielo in ordinary life would hardly believe she was the same
person who prophesied when the spirit of agbala was upon her.

the drummers took up their sticks and the air shivered and grew
tense like a tightened bow.

the two teams were ranged facing each other across the clear
space. a young man from one team danced across the center to the

slipped out of the hut as soon as he noticed him dozing.

he did not sleep at night. he tried not to think about ikemefuna,-
but the more he tried the more he thought about him. once he got



up from bed and walked about his compound. but he was so weak
that his legs could hardly carry him. he felt like a drunken giant
walking with the limbs of a mosquito. now and then a cold shiver
descended on his head and spread down his body.



on the third day he asked his second wife, ekwefi, to roast
plantains for him. she prepared it the way he liked—with slices of
oil-bean and fish.

"you have not eaten for two days," said his daughter ezinma when
she brought the food to him. "so you must finish this." she sat
down and stretched her legs in front of her. okonkwo ate the food
absent-mindedly. 'she should have been a boy,' he thought as he
looked at his ten-year-old daughter. he passed her a piece of fish.

"go and bring me some cold water," he said. ezinma rushed out of
the hut

t it was as silly as all women's stories. mosquito,
she had said, had asked ear to marry him, whereupon ear fell on
the floor in uncontrollable laughter. "how much longer do you
think you will live?" she asked. "you are already a skeleton."
mosquito went away humiliated, and any time he passed her way
he told ear that he was still alive.

okonkwo turned on his side and went back to sleep. he was
roused in the morning by someone banging on his door.

"who is that?" he growled. he knew it must be ekwefi.



of his three wives ekwefi was the only one who would have the
audacity to bang on his door.



"ezinma is dying," came her voice, and all the tragedy and sorrow
of her life were packed in those words.

okonkwo sprang from his bed, pushed back the bolt on his door
and ran into ekwefi's hut.

ezinma lay shivering on a mat beside a huge fire that her mother
had kept burning all night.

"it is iba," said okonkwo as he took his machete and went into the
bush to collect the leaves and grasses an

d barks of trees that went
into making the medicine for iba.

ekwefi knelt beside the sick child, occasionally feeling with her
palm the wet, burning forehead.

ezinma was an only child and the center of her mother's world.
very often it was ezinma who decided what food her mother
should prepare. ekwefi even gave her such delicacies as eggs,
which children were rarely allowed to eat because such food
tempted them to steal. one day as ezinma was eating an egg
okonkwo had come in unexpectedly from his hut. he was greatly
shocked and swore to beat ekwefi if she dared to give the child
eggs again. but it was impossible to refuse ezinma anything. after
her father's rebuke she developed an even keener appetite for eggs.
and she enjoyed above all the secrecy in which she now ate them.

ys took her into their bedroom and shut the door.

ezinma did not call her mother nne like all children. she called her
by her name, ekwefi, as her father and other grownup people did.
the relationship between them was not only that of mother and
child. there was something in it like the companionship of equals,



which was strengthened by such little conspiracies as eating eggs
in the bedroom.



ekwefi had suffered a good deal in her life. she had borne ten
children and nine of them had died in infancy, usually before the
age of three. as she buried one child after another her sorrow gave
way to despair and then to grim resignation. the birth of her
children, which should be a woman's crowning glory, became for
ekwefi mere physical agony devoid of promise. the naming
ceremony after seven market weeks became an empty ritual. her
deepening despair found expression in the names she gave her
chil

dren. one of them was a pathetic cry, onwumbiko—"death, i
implore you." but death took no notice,- onwumbiko died in his
fifteenth month. the next child was a girl, ozoemena—"may it not
happen again." she died in her eleventh month, and two others
after her. ekwefi then became defiant and called her next child
onwuma—"death may please himself." and he did.

after the death of ekwefi's second child, okonkwo had gone to a
medicine man, who was also a diviner of the afa oracle, to inquire
what was amiss. this man told him that the child was an ogbanje,
one of those wicked children who, when they died, entered their
mothers' wombs to be born again.

"when your wife becomes pregnant again," he said, "let her not
sleep in her hut. let her go and stay with her people. in that way
she will elude her wicked tormentor and break its evil cycle of
birth and death."

ekwefi did as she 
 
 ___________________________
 
rought out a sharp razor from the goatskin
bag slung from his left shoulder and began to mutilate the child.
then he took it away to bury in the evil forest, holding it by the
ankle and dragging it on the ground behind him. after such
treatment it would think twice before coming again, unless it was
one of the stubborn ones who returned, carrying the stamp of their



mutilation—a missing finger or perhaps a dark line where the
medicine man's razor had cut them.



by the time onwumbiko died ekwefi had become a very bitter
woman. her husband's first wife had already had three sons, all
strong and healthy. when she had borne her third son in succession,
okonkwo had slaughtered a goat for her, as was the custom.
ekwefi had nothing but good wishes for her. but she had grown so
bitter about her own chi that she could not rejoice with others over
their good fortune. and so, on the day that nwoye's mother
celebrated the birth of her three sons with feasting and music,
ekwefi was the only person
 
 ___________________________
 
 in the happy company who went about
with a cloud on her brow. her husband's wife took this for
malevolence, as husbands' wives were wont to. how could she
know that ekwefi's bitterness did not flow outwards to others but
inwards into her own soul,- that she did not blame others for their
good fortune but her own evil chi  who denied her any?

at last ezinma was born, and although ailing she seemed
determined to live. at first ekwefi accepted her, as she had
accepted others—with listless resignation. but when she lived on
to her fourth, fifth and sixth years, love returned once more to her
mother, and, with love, anxiety. she determined to nurse her child
to health, and she put all her being into it. she was rewarded by
occasional spells of health during which ezinma bubbled with
energy like fresh palm-wine. at such times she seemed beyond
danger. but all of a sudden she would go down again. everybody
knew she was an ogba

nje. these sudden bouts of sickness and
health were typical of her kind. but she had lived so long that
perhaps she had decided to stay. some of them did become tired of
their evil rounds of birth and death, or took pity on their mothers,
and stayed. ekwefi believed deep inside her that ezinma had come
to stay. she believed because it was that faith alone that gave her
own life any kind of meaning. and this faith had been strengthened
when a year or so ago a medicine man had dug up ezinma's iyi-



uwa. everyone knew then that she would live because her bond
with the world of ogbanje had been broken. ekwefi was reassured.
but such was her anxiety for her daughter that she could not rid
herself completely of her fear. and although she believed tha

 okonkwo, who stood beside
her. all the family were there and some of the neighbors too.

"leave her to me," the medicine man told okonkwo in a cool,
confident voice. he turned again to ezinma. "where did you bury
your iyi-uwa?"

"where they bury children," she replied, and the quiet spectators
murmured to themselves.



"come along then and show me the spot," said the medicine man.



the crowd set out with ezinma leading the way and okagbue
following closely behind her. okonkwo came next and ekwefi
followed him. when she came to the main road, ezinma turned left
as if she was going to the stream.

"but you said it was where they bury children?" asked the
medicine man.

"no," said ezinma, whose feeling of importance was manifest in
her sprightly walk. she sometimes broke into a run and stopped
again suddenly. the crowd followed her silently. women and
children returning from the stream with pots of water on their
heads wondered what was happening until they saw okagbue and
guessed that it

must be something to do with ogbanje. and they all
knew ekwefi and her daughter very well.

when she got to the big udala tree ezinma turned left into the bush,
and the crowd followed her. because of her size she made her way
through trees and creepers more quickly than her followers. the
bush was alive with the tread of feet on dry leaves and sticks and
the moving aside of tree branches. ezinma went deeper and deeper
and the crowd went with her. then she suddenly turned round and
began to walk back to the road. everybody stood to let her pass
and then fil

"it is near that orange tree," ezinma said.

"and why did you not say so, you wicked daughter of akalogoli?"
okonkwo swore furiously. the medicine man ignored him.

"come and show me the exact spot," he said quietly to ezinma.

"it is here," she said when they got to the tree.

"point at the spot with your finger," said okagbue.

"it is here," said ezinma touching the ground with her finger.
okonkwo stood by, rumbling like thunder in the rainy season.

"bring me a hoe," said okagbue.

'when ekwefi brought the hoe, he had already put aside his
goatskin bag and his big cloth and was in his underwear, a long
and thin strip of cloth wound round the waist like a belt and then
passed between the legs to be fastened to the belt behind. he
immediately set to work digging a pit where ezinma had indicated.
the neighbors sat around watching the pit becoming deeper and
deeper. the dark top soil soon gave way to the bright red earth
with which women scrubbed the floors and walls of huts. okagbue

ed tirelessly and in silence, his back shining with perspiration.
okonkwo stood by the pit. he asked okagbue to come up and rest
while he took a hand. but okagbue said he was not tired yet.

ekwefi went into her hut to cook yams. her husband had brought
out more yams than usual because the medicine man had to be fed.
ezinma went with her and helped in preparing the vegetables.

"there is too much green vegetable," she said.



"don't you see the pot is full of yams?" ekwefi asked. "and you
know how leaves become smaller after cooking."



"yes," said ezinma, "that was why the snake-lizard killed his
mother."

"very true," said ekwefi.

"he gave his mother seven baskets of vegetables to cook and in the
end there were only three. and so he killed her," said ezinma.

"that is not the end of the story."

"oho," said ezinma. "i remember now. he brought another seven
baskets and cooked them himself. and there were again only three.
so he killed himself too."

because he wanted to take in all that happened.

okagbue had again taken over the digging from okonkwo. he
worked, as usual, in silence. the neighbors and okonkwo's wives
were now talking. the children had lost interest and were playing.

suddenly okagbue sprang to the surface with the agility of a
leopard.

"it is very near now," he said. "i have felt it."

there was immediate excitement and those who were sitting
jumped to their feet.



"call your wife and child," he said to okonkwo. but ekwefi and
ezinma had heard the noise and run out to see what it was.



okagbue went back into the pit, which was now surrounded by
spectators. after a few more hoe-fuls of earth he struck the iyi-uwa.
he raised it carefully with the hoe and threw it to the surface.
some women ran away in fear when it was thrown. but they soon
returned and everyone was gazing at the rag from a reasonable
distance. okagbue emerged and without saying a word or even
looking at the spectators he went to his goatskin bag,
 
 ___________________________
 
 took out two
leaves and began to chew them. when he had swallowed them, he
took up the rag with his left hand and began to untie it. and then
the smooth, shiny pebble fell out. he picked it up.

"is this yours?" he asked ezinma.

"yes," she replied. all the women shouted with joy because
ekwefi's troubles were at last ended.

all this had happened more than a year ago and ezinma had not
been ill since. and then suddenly she had begun to shiver in the
night. ekwefi brought her to the fireplace, spread her mat on the
floor and built a fire. but she had got worse and worse. as she
knelt by her, feeling with her palm the wet, burning forehead, she
prayed a thousand times. although her husband's wives were
saying that it was nothing more than iba, she did not hear them.

okonkwo returned from the bush carrying on his left shoulder a
large bundle of grasses and leaves, roots and barks of medicinal
trees and shrubs. he went into ekwefi's hut, put down his load

and
sat down.

"get me a pot," he said, "and leave the child alone."



ekwefi went to bring the pot and okonkwo selected the best from
his bundle, in their due proportions, and cut them up. he put them
in the pot and ekwefi poured in some water.



"is that enough?" she asked when she had poured in about half of
the water in the bowl.

"a little more… i said a little. are you deaf?" okonkwo roared at
her.

she set the pot on the fire and okonkwo took up his machete to
return to his obi.

"you must watch the pot carefully," he said as he went, "and don't
allow it to boil over. if it does its power will be gone." he went
away to his hut and ekwefi began to tend the medicine pot almost
as if it was itself a sick ch

dicine had cooked long
anough. he looked it over and said it was done.

"bring me a low stool for ezinma," he said, "and a thick mat."

he took down the pot from the fire and placed it in front of the
stool. he then roused ezinma and placed her on the stool, astride
the steaming pot. the thick mat was thrown over both. ezinma
struggled to escape from the choking and overpowering steam, but
she was held down. she started to cry.

when the mat was at last removed she was drenched in
perspiration. ekwefi mopped her with a piece of cloth and she lay
down on a dry mat and was soon asleep.

   large crowds began to gather on the village ilo as soon as the
edge had worn off the sun's heat and it was no longer painful on
the body. most communal ceremonies took place at that time of the
day, so that even when it was said that a ceremony would begin
"after the midday meal" everyone understood that it would begin a
long time later, when the sun's heat had softened.

turned it on to his left palm, but
nothing came out. he hit the bottle against his knee to shake up the
tobacco. that was always the trouble with okeke's snuff. it very
quickly went damp, and there was too much saltpeter in it.
okonkwo had not bought snuff from him for a long time. idigo
was the man who knew how to grind good snuff. but he had
recently fallen ill.

low voices, broken now and again by singing, reached okonkwo
from his wives' huts as each woman and her children told folk
stories. ekwefi and her daughter, ezinma, sat on a mat on the floor.
it was ekwefl's turn to tell a story.

"once upon a time," she began, "all the birds were invited to a
feast in the sky. they were very happy and began to prepare
themselves for the great day. they painted their bodies with red
cam wood and drew beautiful patterns on them with uli.

"tortoise saw all these preparations and soon discovered what it all
meant. nothing that happened in the world of the animals ever

tortoise looked down from the sky and saw his wife bringing
things out, but it was too far to see what they were. when all
seemed ready he let himself go. he fell and fell and fell until he
began to fear that he would never stop falling. and then like the
sound of his cannon he crashed on the compound." ';,; "did he
die?" asked ezinma.

"no," replied ekwefi. "his shell broke into pieces. but there was a
great medicine man in the neighborhood. tortoise's wife sent for
him and he gathered all the bits of shell and stuck them together.
that is why tortoise's shell is not smooth."

"there is no song in the story," ezinma pointed out.

"no," said ekwefi. "1 shall think of another one with a song. but it
is your turn now."

"once upon a time," ezinma began, "tortoise and cat went to
wrestle against yams—no, that is not the beginning. once upon a

estess of agbala, prophesying. there was nothing new in that.
once in a while chielo was possessed by the spirit of her god and
she began to prophesy. but tonight she was addressing her
prophecy and greetings to okonkwo, and so everyone in his family
listened. the folk stories stopped.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o-o," came the voice like a
sharp knife cutting through the night. "okonkwo! agbala ekme gio-
o-o-o! agbala cholu ifu ada ya ezinmao-o-o-oi"

at the mention of ezinma's name ekwefi jerked her head sharply
like an animal that had sniffed death in the air. her heart jumped
painfully within her.

the priestess had now reached okonkwo's compound and was
talking with him outside his hut. she was saying again and again
that agbala wanted to see his daughter, ezinma. okonkwo pleaded
with her to come back in the morning because ezinma was now
asleep. but chielo ignored what he was trying to say and went on
shouting that agbala wanted to see his daughter. her voice was as
clear as

 metal, and okonkwo's women and children heard from
their huts all that she said. okonkwo was still pleading that the girl
had been ill of late and was asleep. ekwefi quickly took her to their
bedroom and placed her on their high bamboo bed.

the priestess screamed. "beware, okonkwo!" she warned.
"beware of exchanging words with agbala. does a man speak
when a god speaks? beware!"

she walked through okonkwo's hut into the circular compound
and went straight toward ekwefi's hut. okonkwo came after her.

"ekwefi," she called, "agbala greets you. where is my daughter,
ezinma? agbala wants to see her."



ekwefi came out from her hut carrying her oil lamp in her left
hand. there was a light wind blowing, so she cupped her right
hand to shelter the flame. nwoye's mother, also carrying an oil
lamp, emerged from her hut. the children stood in the darkness
outside their hut watching the strange event. okonkwo's youngest
wife also came out and joined the others.



"wh
 
 ___________________________
 
ere does agbala want to see her?" ekwefi asked.

"where else but in his house in the hills and the caves?" replied the
priestess.

"i will come with you, too," ekwefi said firmly.

"tufia-al" the priestess cursed, her voice cracking like the angry
bark of thunder in the dry season. "how dare you, woman, to go
before the mighty agbala of your own accord? beware, woman,
lest he strike you in his anger. bring me my daughter."

ekwefi went into her hut and came out again with ezinma.

"come, my daughter," said the priestess. "i shall carry you on my
back. a baby on its mother's back does not know that the way is
long."

ezinma began to cry. she was used to chielo calling her "my
daughter." but it was a different chielo she now saw in the yellow
half-light.

"don't cry, my daughter," said the priestess, "lest agbala be angry
with you."

"don't cry," said ekwefi, "she will bring you back very soon. i
shall give you some fish t

o eat." she went into the hut again and
brought down the smoke-black basket in which she kept her dried
fish and other ingredients for cooking soup. she broke a piece in
two and gave it to ezinma, who clung to her.



"don't be afraid," said ekwefi, stroking her head, which was
shaved in places, leaving a regular pattern of hair. they went
outside again. the priestess bent down on one knee and ezinma
climbed on her back, her left palm closed on her fish and her eyes
gleaming with tears.



"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! …" chielo began once
again to chant greetings to her god. she turned round sharply and
walked through okonkwo's hut, bending very low at the eaves.
ezinma was crying loudly now, calling on her mother. the two

ces disappeared into the thick darkness.

a strange and sudden weakness descended on ekwefi as she stood
gazing in the direction of the voices like a hen whose only chick
has been carried away by a kite. ezinma's voice soon faded away
and only chielo was heard moving farther and farther into the
distance.

"why do you stand there as though she had been kidnapped?"
asked okonkwo as he went back to his hut.

"she will bring her back soon," nwoye's mother said.

but ekwefi did not hear these consolations. she stood for a while,
and then, all of a sudden, made up her mind. she hurried through
okonkwo's hut and went outside. "where are you going?" he asked.

"i am following chielo," she replied and disappeared in the
darkness. okonkwo cleared his throat, and brought out his snuff-
bottle from the goatskin bag by his side.

the priestess' voice was already growing faint in the distance.
ekwefi hurried to the main footpath and turned left in the direction

eless to her in the darkness. but she
picked her way easily on the sandy footpath hedged on either side
by branches and damp leaves. she began to run, holding her





breasts with her hands to stop them flapping noisily against her
body. she hit her left foot against an outcropped root, and terror
seized her. it was an ill omen. she ran faster. but chielo's voice
was still a long way away. had she been running too? how could
she go so fast with ezinma on her back? although the night was
cool, ekwefi was beginning to feel hot from her running. she
continually ran into the luxuriant weeds and creepers that walled in
the path. once she tripped up and fell. only then did she realize,
with a start, that chielo had stopped her chanting. her heart beat
violently and she stood still. then chielo's renewed outburst came
from only a few paces ahead. but ekwefi could not see her. she
shut her eyes for a while and opened them again in an effort to see.
but it was useless. she could not see beyond her

nose.

there were no stars in the sky because there was a rain-cloud.
fireflies went about with their tiny green lamps, which only made
the darkness more profound. between chielo's outbursts the night
was alive with the shrill tremor of forest insects woven into the
darkness.

"agbala do-o-o-o!… agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! …" ekwefi trudged
behind, neither getting too near nor keeping too far back. she
thought they must be going towards the sacred cave. now that she
walked slowly she had time to think. what would she do when
they got to the cave? she would not dare to enter. she would wait
at the mouth, all alone in that fearful place. she thought of all the
terrors of the night. she remembered that night, long ago, when she
had seen ogbu-agali-odu, one of those evil essences loosed upon
the world by the potent "medicines"

 which the tribe had made in
the distant past against its enemies but had now forgotten how to
control. ekwefi had been returning from the stream with her
mother on a dark night like this when they saw its glow as it flew
in their direction. they had thrown down their water-pots and lain
by the roadside expecting the sinister light to descend on them and
kill them. that was the only time ekwefi ever saw ogbu-agali-odu.



but although it had happened so long ago, her blood still ran cold
whenever she remembered that night.



the priestess' voice came at longer intervals now, but its vigor was
undiminished. the air was cool and damp with dew. ezinma
sneezed. ekwefi muttered, "life to you." at the same time the
priestess also said, "life to you, my daughter."

ezinma's voice from the darkness warmed her mother's heart. she
trudged slowly along.

and then the priestess screamed. "someb

ody is walking behind
me!" she said. "whether you are spirit or man, may agbala shave
your head with a blunt razor! may he twist your neck until you see
your heels!"

ekwefi stood rooted to the spot. one mind said to her: "woman,
go home before agbala does you harm." but she could not. she
stood until chielo had increased the distance between them and she
began to follow again. she had already walked so long that she
began to feel a slight numbness in the limbs and in the head. then
it occurred to her that they could not have been heading for the
cave. they must have bypassed it long ago,- they must be going
towards umuachi, the farthest village in the clan. chielo

now came after long intervals.

it seemed to ekwefi that the night had become a little lighter. the
cloud had lifted and a few stars were out. the moon must be
preparing to rise, its sullenness over. when the moon rose late in
the night, people said it was refusing food, as a sullen husband
refuses his wife's food when they have quarrelled.

"agbala do-o-o-o! umuachi! agbala ekene unuo-o-ol" it was just
as ekwefi had thought. the priestess was now saluting the village
of umuachi. it was unbelievable, the distance they had covered. as
they emerged into the open village from the narrow forest track the



darkness was softened and it became possible to see the vague
shape of trees. ekwefi screwed her eyes up in an effort to see her
daughter and the priestess, but



whenever she thought she saw their shape it immediately dissolved
like a melting lump of darkness. she walked numbly along.

chielo's voice 
 
 ___________________________
 
was now rising continuously, as when she first set
out. ekwefi had a feeling of spacious openness, and she guessed
they must be on the village ilo, or playground. and she realized too
with something like a jerk that chielo was no longer moving
forward. she was, in fact, returning. ekwefi quickly moved away
from her line of retreat. chielo passed by, and they began to go
back the way they had come.

it was a long and weary journey and ekwefi felt like a sleepwalker
most of the way. the moon was definitely rising, and although it
had not yet appeared on the sky its light had already melted down
the darkness. ekwefi could now discern the figure of the priestess
and her burden. she slowed down her pace so as to increase the
distance between them. she was afraid of what might happen if
chielo suddenly turned round and saw her.

she had prayed for the moon to rise. but now she found the half-
light of the incipient moon more terrifying

than darkness. the
world was now peopled with vague, fantastic figures that dissolved
under her steady gaze and then formed again in new shapes. at one
stage ekwefi was so afraid that she nearly called out to chielo for
companionship and human sympathy. what she had seen was the
shape of a man climbing a palm tree, his head pointing to the earth
and his legs skywards. but at that very moment chielo's voice rose
again in her possessed chanting, and ekwefi recoiled, because
there was no humanity there. it was not the same chielo who sat
with her in the market and sometimes bought beancakes for
ezinma, whom she called her daughter. it was a different




woman—the priestess of agbala, the oracle of the hills and caves.
ekwefi trudged along between two fears. the sound of her
benumbed steps seemed to come from some other person walking
behind her. her arms were folded across her bare breasts. dew fell
heavily and the air was cold. she could no l

onger think, not even
about the terrors of night. she just jogged along in a half-sleep,
only waking to full life when chielo sang.

at last they took a turning and began to head for the caves. from
then on, chielo never ceased in her chanting. she greeted her god
in a multitude of names—the owner of the future, the messenger of
earth, the god who cut a man down when his life was sweetest to
him. ekwefi was also awakened and her benumbed fears revived.

the moon was now up and she could see chielo and ezinma
clearly. how a woman could carry a child of that size so easily and
for so long was a miracle. but ekwefi was not thinking about that.
chielo was not a woman that night.

"agbala do-o-o-o! agbala ekeneo-o-o-o! chi negbu madu ubosi
ndu ya nato ya uto daluo-o-o! …"

ekwefi could already see the hills looming in the moonlight. they
formed a circular ring with a break at one point through wh

ich the
foot-track led to the center of the circle.

as soon as the priestess stepped into this ring of hills her voice was
not only doubled in strength but was thrown back on all sides. it
was indeed the shrine of a great god. ekwefi picked her way
carefully and quietly. she was already beginning to doubt the
wisdom of her coming. nothing would

happen to ezinma, she thought. and if anything happened to her
could she stop it? she would not dare to enter the underground
caves. her coming was quite useless, she thought.





as these things went through her mind she did not realize how
close they were to the cave mouth. and so when the priestess with
ezinma on her back disappeared through a hole hardly big enough
to pass a h

en, ekwefi broke into a run as though to stop them. as
she stood gazing at the circular darkness which had swallowed
them, tears gushed from her eyes, and she swore within her that if
she heard ezinma cry she would rush into the cave to defend her
against all the gods in the world. she would die with her.

having sworn that oath, she sat down on a stony ledge and waited.
her fear had vanished. she could hear the priestess' voice, all its
metal taken out of it by the vast emptiness of the cave. she buried

her face in her lap and waited.

she did not know how long she waited. it must have been a very
long time. her back was turned on the footpath that led out of the
hills. she must have heard a noise behind her and turned round
sharply. a man stood there with a machete in his hand. ekwefi
uttered a scream and sprang to her feet.

"don't be foolish," said okonkwo's voice. "1 thought you were
going into the shrine with chielo," he mocked.

ekwefi did not answer. tears of gratitude filled her eyes. she knew
her daughter was safe.

"go home and sleep," said okonkwo. "1 shall wait here."

"i shall wait too. it is almost dawn. the first cock has crowed."

as they stood there together, ekwefi's mind went back to the days
when they were young. she had married anene because okonkwo
was too poor then to marry. two years after her marriage to anene
she could bear it no longer and she ran away to okonkwo. it had
been early in the morning. the moo

 but happy task of cooking for a whole
village.

okonkwo's family was astir like any other family in the
neighborhood. nwoye's mother and okonkwo's youngest wife
were ready to set out for obierika's compound with all their
children. nwoye's mother carried a basket of coco-yams, a cake of
salt and smoked fish which she would present to obierika's wife.
okonkwo's youngest wife, ojiugo, also had a basket of plantains
and coco-yams and a small pot of palm-oil. their children carried
pots of water.

ekwefi was tired and sleepy from the exhausting experiences of
the previous night. it was not very long since they had returned.
the priestess, with ezinma sleeping on her back, had crawled out
of the shrine on her belly like a snake. she had not as much as

them at the mouth of the cave. she looked straight ahead of her and
walked back to the village. okonkwo and his wife followed at a
respectful distance. they thought the priestess m

ight be going to
her house, but she went to okonkwo's compound, passed through
his obi and into ekwefi's hut and walked into her bedroom. she
placed ezinma carefully on the bed and went away without saying
a word to anybody.

ezinma was still sleeping when everyone else was astir, and
ekwefi asked nwoye's mother and ojiugo to explain to obierika's
wife that she would be late. she had got ready her basket of coco-
yams and fish, but she must wait for ezinma to wake.

"you need some sleep yourself," said nwoye's mother. "you look
very tired."

as they spoke ezinma emerged from the hut, rubbing her eyes and
stretching her spare frame. she saw the other children with their
water-pots and remembered that they were going to fetch water for
obierika's wife. she went back to the hut and br

ought her pot.

"have you slept enough?" asked her mother.

"yes," she replied. "let us go."

"not before you have had your breakfast," said ekwefi. and she
went into her hut to warm the vegetable soup she had cooked last
night.

"we shall be going," said nwoye's mother. "i will tell obierika's
wife that you are coming later." and so they all went to help
obierika's wife—nwoye's mother with her four children and
ojiugo with her two.



as they trooped through okonkwo's obi he asked: "who will
prepare my afternoon meal?"



"i shall return to do it," said ojiugo.

okonkwo was also feeling tired, and sleepy, for although nobody
else knew

it, he had not slept at all last night. he had felt very
anxious but did not show it. when ekwefi had followed the
priestess, he had allowed what he regarded as a reasonable and
manly interval to pass and then gone with his machete to the shrine,
where he thought they must be. it was only when he had got there
that it had occurred to him that the priestess might have chosen to
go round the villages first. okonkwo had returned home and sat
waiting. when he thought he had waited long enough he again
returned to the shrine. but the hills and the caves were as silent as
death. it was only on hi

s fourth trip that he had found ekwefi, and
by then he had become gravely worried.

obierika's compound was as busy as an anthill. temporary
cooking tripods were erected on every available space by bringing
together three blocks of sun-dried earth and making a fire in their
midst. cooking pots went up and down the tripods and foo-foo was
pounded in a hundred wooden mortars some of the women cooked
the yams and the cassava, and others prepared vegetable soup.
young men pounded the foo-foo or split firewood. the children

r and lighter until it fell in
slanting showers. sometimes the sun shone through the rain and a
light breeze blew. it was a gay and airy kind of rain. the rainbow
began to appear, and sometimes two rainbows, like a mother and
her daughter, the one young and beautiful, and the other an old and
faint shadow. the rainbow was called the python of the sky.

okonkwo called his three wives and told them to get things
together for a great feast. "i must thank my mother's kinsmen
before i go," he said.

ekwefi still had some cassava left on her farm from the previous
year. neither of the other wives had. it was not that they had been



lazy, but that they had many children to feed. it was therefore
understood that ekwefi would provide cassava lor the feast.
nwoye's mother and ojiugo would provide the  other things like
smoked fish, palm-oil and pepper for the soup. okonkwo would
take care of meat and yams.



ekwefi rose early on the following morning and went to her farm
with her daughter, ezinma,

 and ojiugo's daughter, obiageli, to
harvest cassava tubers. each of them carried a long cane basket, a
machete for cutting down the soft cassava stem, and a little hoe for
digging out the tuber. fortunately, a light rain had fallen during the
night and the soil would not be very hard.

"it will not take us long to harvest as much as we like," said
ekwefi.

"but the leaves will be wet," said ezinma. her basket was
balanced on her head, and her arms folded across her breasts. she
felt cold. "i dislike cold water dropping on my back. we should
have waited for the sun to rise and dry the leaves."

obiageli called her "salt" because she said that she disliked water.
"are you afraid you may dissolve?"

the harvesting was easy, as ekwefi had said. ezinma shook every
tree violently with a long stick before she bent down to cut the
stem and dig out the

tuber. sometimes it was not necessary to dig.
they just pulled the stump, and earth rose, roots snapped below,
and the tuber was pulled out.

when they had harvested a sizable heap they carried it down in
two trips to the stream, where every woman had a shallow well for
fermenting her cassava.

"it should be ready in four days or even three," said obiageli.
"they are young tubers."



"they are not all that young," said ekwefi. "i planted the farm
nearly two years ago. it is a poor soil and that is why the tubers are
so small."



okonkwo never did things by halves. when his wife ekwefi
protested that two goats were sufficient for the feast he told her
that it was not her affair.

"i am calling a feast because i have the wherewithal. i cannot live
on the bank of a river and wash my hands with spittle. my mother's
people have been good to me and 1 must show my gratitude."

and so three goats were slaughtered and a num
