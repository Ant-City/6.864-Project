the [CHARACTER]  - 
                although
he recounts the story's events, the [CHARACTER] (an engineer by profession)
plays no part in the story itself. that he remains nameless highlights
the thinness of his character. as a stranger to starkfield, he views
ethan frome's story with fresh eyes and operates as a conduit between
the closely guarded story of frome's tragedy and the reader in the
world outside the novel.
