[CHARACTER] - 
                the
narrator and protagonist of the story. although lemuel [CHARACTER]'s
vivid and detailed style of narration makes it clear that he is
intelligent and well educated, his perceptions are naive and gullible.
he has virtually no emotional life, or at least no awareness of
it, and his comments are strictly factual. indeed, sometimes his obsession
with the facts of navigation, for example, becomes unbearable for
us, as his fictional editor, richard sympson, makes clear when he
explains having had to cut out nearly half of [CHARACTER]'s verbiage. [CHARACTER]
never thinks that the absurdities he encounters are funny and never
makes the satiric connections between the lands he visits and his
own home. [CHARACTER]'s naivete makes the satire possible, as we pick up
on things that [CHARACTER] does not notice.
