[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is the ultimate victorian woman. van helsing's
praise of mina testifies to the fact that she is indeed the embodiment
of the virtues of the age. she is "one of god's women, fashioned
by his own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where
we can enter, and that its light can be here on earth. so true,
so sweet, so noble. . . ." mina stands as the model of domestic
propriety, an assistant schoolmistress who dutifully studies newfangled machines
like the typewriter so as to be useful to her husband. unlike lucy,
she is not most noteworthy for her physical beauty, which spares
mina her friend's fate of being transformed into a voluptuous she-devil.

mina's sexuality remains enigmatic throughout the whole
of dracula. though she marries, she never gives voice to anything resembling
a sexual desire or impulse, which enables her to retain her purity.
indeed, the entire second half of the novel concerns the issue of
mina's purity. stoker creates suspense about whether mina, like
lucy, will be lost. given that dracula means to use women to access
the men of england, mina's loss could have terrifying repercussions. 
we might expect that mina, who sympathizes with the boldly progressive
"new women" of england, would be doomed to suffer lucy's fate as
punishment for her progressiveness. but stoker instead fashions
mina into a goddess of conservative male fantasy. though resourceful
and intelligent enough to conduct the research that leads van helsing's
crew to the count, mina is far from a "new woman" herself. rather,
she is a dutiful wife and mother, and her successes are always in
the service of men. mina's moral perfection remains as stainless,
in the end, as her forehead.
