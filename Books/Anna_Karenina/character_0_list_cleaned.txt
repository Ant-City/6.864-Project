[CHARACTER]  - 
a beautiful, aristocratic married woman from st.
petersburg whose pursuit of love and emotional honesty makes her
an outcast from society. anna's adulterous affair catapults her
into social exile, misery, and finally suicide. anna is a beautiful
person in every sense: intelligent and literate, she reads voraciously,
writes children's books, and shows an innate ability to appreciate
art. physically ravishing yet tastefully reserved, she captures
the attentions of virtually everyone in high society. anna believes
in love--not only romantic love but family love and friendship as
well, as we see from her devotion to her son, her fervent efforts
to reconcile stiva and dolly oblonsky in their marital troubles,
and her warm reception of dolly at her country home. anna abhors nothing
more than fakery, and she comes to regard her husband, karenin,
as the very incarnation of the fake, emotionless conventionality
she despises.
