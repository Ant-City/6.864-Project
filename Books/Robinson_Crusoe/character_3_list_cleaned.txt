the [CHARACTER] - 
                 one
of the men from the spanish ship that is wrecked off crusoe's island,
and whose crew is rescued by the cannibals and taken to a neighboring
island. the [CHARACTER] is doomed to be eaten as a ritual victim of
the cannibals when crusoe saves him. in exchange, he becomes a new
"subject" in crusoe's "kingdom," at least according to crusoe. the
[CHARACTER] is never fleshed out much as a character in crusoe's narrative,
an example of the odd impersonal attitude often notable in crusoe.
