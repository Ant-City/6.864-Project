but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,
cheerfully apologizing for his lateness. lucy, who had not yet acquired
decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: â€œoh, oh! why, itâ€™s
mr. beebe! oh, how perfectly lovely! oh, charlotte, we must stop now,
however bad the rooms are. oh!â€

miss bartlett said, with more restraint:

â€œhow do you do, mr. beebe? i expect that you have forgotten us: miss
bartlett and miss honeychurch, who were at tunbridge wells when you
helped the vicar of st. peterâ€™s that very cold easter.â€

the clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember
the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. but he came forward
pleasantly enough and accepted the chair into which he was beckoned by
lucy.

â€œi am so glad to see you,â€ said the girl, who was in a state of
spiritual starvation, and would have been glad to see the waiter if
her cousin had permitted it. â€œjus

â€œmiss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street,â€ said miss

of conversation that you have just accepted the living--â€

â€œyes, i heard from mother so last week. she didnâ€™t know that i knew you
at tunbridge wells; but i wrote back at once, and i said: â€˜mr. beebe

rather like to go out, as it was her first day in florence, but, of
course, she could go alone. miss bartlett could not allow this. of
course she would accompany lucy everywhere. oh, certainly not; lucy
would stop with her cousin. oh, no! that would never do. oh, yes!

at this point the clever lady broke in.

â€œif it is mrs. grundy who is troubling you, i do assure you that you
can neglect the good person. being english, miss honeychurch will be
perfectly safe. italians understand. a dear friend of mine, contessa
baroncelli, has two daughters, and when she cannot send a maid to school
with them, she lets them go in sailor-hats instead. every one takes
them for english, you see, especially if their hair is strained tightly
behind.â€

miss bartlett was unconvinced by the safety of contessa baroncelliâ€™s
daughters. she was determined to take lucy herself, her head not being
so very bad. the clever lady then said that sh

lucy said that this was most kind, and at once opened the baedeker, to
see where santa croce was.

miss lavish--for that was the clever ladyâ€™s name--turned to the right
along the sunny lungâ€™ arno. how delightfully warm! but a wind down
the side streets cut like a knife, didnâ€™t it? ponte alle
grazie--particularly interesting, mentioned by dante. san
miniato--beautiful as well as interesting; the crucifix that kissed
a murderer--miss honeychurch would remember the story. the men on the
river were fishing. (untrue; but then, so is most information.) then
miss lavish darted under the archway of the white bullocks, and she
stopped, and she cried:

â€œa smell! a true florentine smell! every city, let me teach you, has its
own smell.â€

â€œis it a very nice smell?â€ said lucy, who had inherited from her mother
a distaste to dirt.

â€œthen make my boy think like us. make him realize that by the side of

or a yes, or something!

made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or

miss bartlett looking for miss lavish, nor of miss lavish looking for
her cigarette-case. like every true performer, she was intoxicated by
the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by
touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.

mr. beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical
element in miss honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at tunbridge
wells when he had discovered it. it was at one of those entertainments
where the upper classes entertain the lower. the seats were filled with
a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under
the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing
of a champagne cork. among the promised items was â€œmiss honeychurch.

adelaida, or the march of

â€œcousin of one of my parishioners. i do not consider her choice of a
piece happy. beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal
that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if
anything, disturbs.â€

â€œintroduce me.â€

â€œshe will be delighted. she and miss bartlett are full of the praises of
your sermon.â€

â€œmy sermon?â€ cried mr. beebe. â€œwhy ever did she listen to it?â€

when he was introduced he understood why, for miss honeychurch,
disjoined from her music stool, was only a young lady with a quantity of
dark hair and a very pretty, pale, undeveloped face. she loved going to
concerts, she loved stopping with her cousin, she loved iced coffee and
meringues. he did not doubt that she loved his sermon also. but before
he left tunbridge wells he made a remark to the vicar, which he now
made to lucy herself when she closed the little piano and moved dreamily
towards him:

â€œif miss honeychurch ever takes to live as s

lucy at once re-entered daily life.

â€œoh, what a funny thing! some one said just the same to mother, and she
said she trusted i should never live a duet.â€

â€œdoesnâ€™t mrs. honeychurch like music?â€

â€œshe doesnâ€™t mind it. but she doesnâ€™t like one to get excited over
anything; she thinks i am silly about it. she thinks--i canâ€™t make
out. once, you know, i said that i liked my own playing better than any
oneâ€™s. she has never got over it. of course, i didnâ€™t mean that i played
well; i only meant--â€

â€œof course,â€ said he, wondering why she bothered to explain.

â€œmusic--â€ said lucy, as if attempting some generality. she could not

lucy, for the third time, said that poor charlotte would be sopped. the
arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts
upon the foreshore. but in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze
of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse. she
opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered the room, drawing
a plaintive cry from miss catharine alan, who entered at the same moment
by the door.

â€œoh, dear miss honeychurch, you will catch a chill! and mr. beebe here
besides. who would suppose this is italy? there is my sister actually
nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.â€

she sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was
on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.

â€œi could hear your beautiful playing, miss honeychurch, though i was in
my room with the door shut. doors shut; indeed, most necessary. no one

unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes
rise odours reminiscent of spring. she felt she had made almost too many
allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.

â€œall the same, she is a little too--i hardly like to say unwomanly, but
she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived.â€

mr. beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she
would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.

â€œi donâ€™t know, miss honeychurch, if you have noticed that miss pole, the
lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. that old mr. emerson,
who puts things very strangely--â€

her jaw dropped. she was silent. mr. beebe, whose social resources were
endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to lucy in a
hasty whisper:

â€œstomach. he warned miss pole of her stomach-acidity, he called it--and
he may have meant to be kind. i must say i forgot myself and laughed; it
was so sudden. as teresa truly said,

approval to every well-known name.

but though she spent nearly seven lire, the gates of liberty seemed
still unopened. she was conscious of her discontent; it was new to her
to be conscious of it. â€œthe world,â€ she thought, â€œis certainly full
of beautiful things, if only i could come across them.â€ it was not
surprising that mrs. honeychurch disapproved of music, declaring that it
always left her daughter peevish, unpractical, and touchy.

â€œnothing ever happens to me,â€ she reflected, as she entered the piazza
signoria and looked nonchalantly at its marvels, now fairly familiar to
her. the great square was in shadow; the sunshine had come too late to
strike it. neptune was already unsubstantial in the twilight, half god,
half ghost, and his fountain plashed dreamily to the men and satyrs who
idled together on its marge.

his hand was still extended.

â€œoh, my photographs!â€ she exclaimed suddenly.

â€œwhat photographs?â€

â€œi bought some photographs at alinariâ€™s. i must have dropped them out
there in the square.â€ she looked at him cautiously. â€œwould you add to
your kindness by fetching them?â€

he added to his kindness. as soon as he had turned his back, lucy arose
with the running of a maniac and stole down the arcade towards the arno.

â€œmiss honeychurch!â€

she stopped with her hand on her heart.

â€œyou sit still; you arenâ€™t fit to go home alone.â€

â€œyes, i am, thank you so very much.â€

â€œno, you arenâ€™t. youâ€™d go openly if you were.â€

â€œbut i had rather--â€

â€œthen i donâ€™t fetch your photographs.â€

â€œi had rather be alone.â€

he said imperiously: â€œthe man is dead--the man is probably dead; sit
down till you are rested.â€ she was bewildered, and obeyed him. â€œand

hat she was ready for an adventure,
not that she had encountered it. this solitude oppressed her; she was
accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,
contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking
right or wrong.

at breakfast next morning she took decisive action. there were two plans
between which she had to choose. mr. beebe was walking up to the
torre del gallo with the emersons and some american ladies. would miss
bartlett and miss honeychurch join the party? charlotte declined for
herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. but
she thought it an admirable idea for lucy, who hated shopping, changing
money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties--all of which miss
bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.

â€œno, charlotte!â€ cried the girl, with real warmth. â€œitâ€™s very kind of
mr. beebe, but i am certainly coming with you. i had much rather.â€

moment she understood the nature of ghosts.

the exact site of the murder was occupied, not by a ghost, but by miss
lavish, who had the morning newspaper in her hand. she hailed them
briskly. the dreadful catastrophe of the previous day had given her an
idea which she thought would work up into a book.

â€œoh, let me congratulate you!â€ said miss bartlett. â€œafter your despair
of yesterday! what a fortunate thing!â€

â€œaha! miss honeychurch, come you here i am in luck. now, you are to tell
me absolutely everything that you saw from the beginning.â€ lucy poked at
the ground with her parasol.

â€œbut perhaps you would rather not?â€

â€œiâ€™m sorry--if you could manage without it, i think i would rather not.â€

the elder ladies exchanged glances, not of disapproval; it is suitable
that a girl should feel deeply.

and truth and human interest. she told me also that she has a high
opinion of the destiny of woman--mr. eager! why, how nice! what a

â€œwe were chatting to miss lavish.â€

his brow contracted.

â€œso i saw. were you indeed? andate via! sono occupato!â€ the last remark
was made to a vender of panoramic photographs who was approaching with a
courteous smile. â€œi am about to venture a suggestion. would you and

drive in the hills? we might go up by fiesole and back by settignano.

â€œthis very square--so i am told--witnessed yesterday the most sordid of
tragedies. to one who loves the florence of dante and savonarola
there is something portentous in such desecration--portentous and
humiliating.â€

â€œhumiliating indeed,â€ said miss bartlett. â€œmiss honeychurch happened to
be passing through as it happened. she can hardly bear to speak of it.â€
 she glanced at lucy proudly.

â€œand how came we to have you here?â€ asked the chaplain paternally.

miss bartlettâ€™s recent liberalism oozed away at the question. â€œdo
not blame her, please, mr. eager. the fault is mine: i left her

sympathetic reproof but at the same time indicated that a few harrowing

â€œhe is not; he made an advantageous marriage.â€

he uttered this remark with a voice full of meaning, and ended with a
sigh.

â€œoh, so he has a wife.â€

â€œdead, miss bartlett, dead. i wonder--yes i wonder how he has the
effrontery to look me in the face, to dare to claim acquaintance with

when he was with miss honeychurch, i snubbed him. let him beware that he
does not get more than a snub.â€

â€œwhat?â€ cried lucy, flushing.

â€œexposure!â€ hissed mr. eager.

he tried to change the subject; but in scoring a dramatic point he had
interested his audience more than he had intended. miss bartlett was
full of very natural curiosity. lucy, though she wished never to see the
emersons again, was not disposed to condemn them on a single word.

â€œdo you mean,â€ she asked, â€œthat he is an irreligious man

miss bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

hills?â€

they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.

it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his masterâ€™s horses up
the stony hill. mr. beebe recognized him at once. neither the ages of
faith nor the age of doubt had touched him; he was phaethon in tuscany
driving a cab. and it was persephone whom he asked leave to pick up on
the way, saying that she was his sister--persephone, tall and slender

had nearly joined the party to the torre del gallo. but each time that
she avoided george it became more imperative that she should avoid
him again. and now celestial irony, working through her cousin and two
clergymen, did not suffer her to leave florence till she had made this
expedition with him through the hills.

meanwhile mr. eager held her in civil converse; their little tiff was
over.

â€œso, miss honeychurch, you are travelling? as a student of art?â€

â€œoh, dear me, no--oh, no!â€

â€œperhaps as a student of human nature,â€ interposed miss lavish, â€œlike
myself?â€

â€œoh, no. i am here as a tourist.â€

â€œoh, indeed,â€ said mr. eager. â€œare you indeed? if you will not think me

anglo-saxon tourist is nothing less than a menace.â€

at the furniture. â€œthis is indeed a joyous day! i feel sure that you
will make our dear lucy happy.â€

looking very cross and almost handsome?

lucy rose from the seat. she moved across the lawn and smiled in at
them, just as if she was going to ask them to play tennis. then she saw
her brotherâ€™s face. her lips parted, and she took him in her arms. he
said, â€œsteady on!â€

â€œnot a kiss for me?â€ asked her mother.

lucy kissed her also.

â€œwould you take them into the garden and tell mrs. honeychurch all about
it?â€ cecil suggested. â€œand iâ€™d stop here and tell my mother.â€

â€œwe go with lucy?â€ said freddy, as if taking orders.

â€œyes, you go with lucy.â€

they passed into the sunlight. cecil watched them cross the terrace,
and descend out of sight by the steps. they would descend--he knew their
ways--past the shrubbery, and past the tennis-lawn and the dahlia-bed,
until they reached the kitchen garden, and there, in the presence of the
potatoes and the peas, the great

then he lit another cigarette, which did not seem quite as divine as
the first, and considered what might be done to make windy corner

letter. he did not want to read that letter--his temptations never lay
in that direction; but he worried about it none the less. it was his
own fault that she was discussing him with his mother; he had wanted her
support in his third attempt to win lucy; he wanted to feel that others,
no matter who they were, agreed with him, and so he had asked their
permission. mrs. honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials,
while as for freddy--â€œhe is only a boy,â€ he reflected. â€œi

the honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize
that lucy was of another clay; and perhaps--he did not put it very
definitely--he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as
soon as possible.

â€œmr. beebe!â€ said the maid, and the new rector of summer street was
shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to lucyâ€™s
praise of him in her letters from florence.

cecil greeted him rather critically.

â€œiâ€™ve come for tea, mr. vyse. do you suppose that i

â€œi should say so. food is the thing one does get here--donâ€™t sit in that
chair; young honeychurch has left a bone in it.â€

â€œpfui!â€

â€œi know,â€ said cecil. â€œi know. i canâ€™t think why mrs. honeychurch allows
it.â€

for cecil considered the bone and the maplesâ€™ furniture separately; he
did not realize that, taken together, they kindled the room into the
life that he desired.

â€œiâ€™ve come for tea and for gossip. isnâ€™t this news?â€

â€œnews? i donâ€™t understand you,â€ said cecil. â€œnews?â€

grotesque mistake had he fallen! was it likely that a clergyman and a
gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? but his
stiffness remained, and, though he asked who cissie and albert might be,
he still thought mr. beebe rather a bounder.

â€œunpardonable question! to have stopped a week at windy corner and not
to have met cissie and albert, the semi-detached villas that have been
run up opposite the church! iâ€™ll set mrs. honeychurch after you.â€

â€œiâ€™m shockingly stupid over local affairs,â€ said the young man
languidly. â€œi canâ€™t even remember the difference between a parish
council and a local government board. perhaps there is no difference, or
perhaps those arenâ€™t the right names. i only go into the country to see
my friends and to enjoy the scenery. it is very remiss of me. italy and
london are the only places where i donâ€™t feel to exist on sufferance.â€

care a straw about, but somehow, iâ€™ve not been able to begin.â€

â€œyou are very fortunate,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œit is a wonderful
opportunity, the possession of leisure.â€

his voice was rather parochial, but he did not quite see his way to
answering naturally. he felt, as all who have regular occupation must
feel, that others should have it also.

â€œi am glad that you approve. i darenâ€™t face the healthy person--for
example, freddy honeychurch.â€

â€œoh, freddyâ€™s a good sort, isnâ€™t he?â€

â€œadmirable. the sort who has made england what she is.â€

cecil wondered at himself. why, on this day of all others, was he so
hopelessly contrary? he tried to get right by inquiring effusively after
mr. beebeâ€™s mother, an old lady for whom he had no particular regard.
then he flattered the clergyman, praised his liberal-mindedness, his
enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.

â€œthe fault of euphemia is that she will not, simply will not, chop the
suet sufficiently small.â€

they both laughed, and things began to go better.

â€œthe faults of freddy--â€ cecil continued.

â€œah, he has too many. no one but his mother can remember the faults of
freddy. try the faults of miss honeychurch; they are not innumerable.â€

â€œshe has none,â€ said the young man, with grave sincerity.

â€œi quite agree. at present she has none.â€

â€œat present?â€

â€œiâ€™m not cynical. iâ€™m only thinking of my pet theory about miss

wonderfully, and live so quietly? i suspect that one day she will be
wonderful in both. the water-tight compartments in her will break down,
and music and life will mingle. then we shall have her

florence either, but i kept on expecting that she would be.â€

â€œin what way?â€

conversation had become agreeable to them, and they were pacing up and
down the terrace.

â€œi could as easily tell you what tune sheâ€™ll play next. there was simply
the sense that she had found wings, and meant to use them. i can show
you a beautiful picture in my italian diary: miss honeychurch as a
kite, miss bartlett holding the string. picture number two: the string
breaks.â€

the sketch was in his diary, but it had been made afterwards, when he
viewed things artistically. at the time he had given surreptitious tugs
to the string himself.

â€œbut the string never broke?â€

â€œno. i mightnâ€™t have seen miss honeychurch rise, but i should certainly
have heard miss bartlett fall.â€

from the world? of course, he despised the world as a whole; every
thoughtful man should; it is almost a test of refinement. but he was
sensitive to the successive particles of it which he encountered.

occasionally he could be quite crude.

â€œi am sorry i have given you a shock,â€ he said dryly. â€œi fear that
lucyâ€™s choice does not meet with your approval.â€

â€œnot that. but you ought to have stopped me. i know miss honeychurch
only a little as time goes. perhaps i oughtnâ€™t to have discussed her so
freely with any one; certainly not with you.â€

â€œyou are conscious of having said something indiscreet?â€

mr. beebe pulled himself together. really, mr. vyse had the art of
placing one in the most tiresome positions. he was driven to use the
prerogatives of his profession.

also sincere; â€œlet it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to

garden. â€œoh, mr. beebe, have you heard the news?â€

freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. youth seldom
criticizes the accomplished fact.

not act the parson any longer--at all events not without apology.

hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. anne,
putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them
greatly. they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave
them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. mr. beebe chirruped. freddy
was at his wittiest, referring to cecil as the â€œfiascoâ€--family honoured
pun on fiance. mrs. honeychurch, amusing and portly, promised well as
a mother-in-law. as for lucy and cecil, for whom the temple had been
built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest
worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.

cecil was more than presentable; he looked distinguished, and it was
very pleasant to see his slim figure keeping step with lucy, and his
long, fair face responding when lucy spoke to him. people congratulated
mrs. honeychurch, which is, i believe, a social blunder, but it pleased
her, and she introduced cecil rather indiscriminately to some stuffy
dowagers.

at tea a misfortune took place: a cup of coffee was upset over lucyâ€™s
figured silk, and though lucy feigned indifference, her mother feigned
nothing of the sort but dragged her indoors to have the frock treated
by a sympathetic maid. they were gone some time, and cecil was left with
the dowagers. when they returned he was not as pleasant as he had been

â€œdo you go to much of this sort of thing?â€ he asked when they were
driving home.

â€œoh, now and then,â€ said lucy, who had rather enjoyed herself.

â€œis it typical of country society?â€

â€œi suppose so. mother, would it be?â€

â€œplenty of society,â€ said mrs. honeychurch, who was trying to remember
the hang of one of the dresses.

seeing that her thoughts were elsewhere, cecil bent towards lucy and
said:

â€œto me it seemed perfectly appalling, disastrous, portentous.â€

â€œi am so sorry that you were stranded.â€

â€œnot that, but the congratulations. it is so disgusting, the way an
engagement is regarded as public property--a kind of waste place where
every outsider may shoot his vulgar sentiment. all those old women
smirking!â€

â€œwe all have our limitations, i suppose,â€ said wise lucy.

â€œsometimes they are forced on us, though,â€ said cecil, who saw from her
remark that she did not quite understand his position.

â€œhow?â€

â€œit makes a difference doesnâ€™t it, whether we fully fence ourselves in,
or whether we are fenced out by the barriers of others?â€

she thought a moment, and agreed that it did make a difference.

â€œdifference?â€ cried mrs. honeychurch, suddenly alert. â€œi donâ€™t see any
difference. fences are fences, especially when they are in the same
place.â€

â€œwe were speaking of motives,â€ said cecil, on whom the interruption
jarred.

â€œmy dear cecil, look here.â€ she spread out her knees and perched her
card-case on her lap. â€œthis is me. thatâ€™s windy corner. the rest of the
pattern is the other people. motives are all very well, but the fence
comes here.â€

â€œwe werenâ€™t talking of real fences,â€ said lucy,

what sort of things?â€

â€œthere was an old man at the bertolini whom he said had murdered his
wife.â€

â€œperhaps he had.â€

â€œno!â€

â€œwhy â€˜noâ€™?â€

â€œhe was such a nice old man, iâ€™m sure.â€

cecil laughed at her feminine inconsequence.

â€œwell, i did try to sift the thing. mr. eager would never come to the
point. he prefers it vague--said the old man had â€˜practicallyâ€™ murdered
his wife--had murdered her in the sight of god.â€

â€œhush, dear!â€ said mrs. honeychurch absently.

â€œbut isnâ€™t it intolerable that a person whom weâ€™re told to imitate
should go round spreading slander? it was, i believe, chiefly owing to
him that the old man was dropped. people pretended he was vulgar, but he
certainly wasnâ€™t that.â€

â€œpoor old man! what was his name?â€

â€œharris,â€ said lucy glibly.

â€œletâ€™s hope that mrs. harris there warnâ€™t no sich person,â€ said her
mother.

cecil nodded intelligently.

â€œisnâ€™t mr. eager a parson of the cu

â€œmy goodness gracious me, child!â€ said mrs. honeychurch. â€œyouâ€™ll blow
my head off! whatever is there to shout over? i forbid you and cecil to
hate any more clergymen.â€

he smiled. there was indeed something rather incongruous in lucyâ€™s moral
outburst over mr. eager. it was as if one should see the leonardo on the
ceiling of the sistine. he longed to hint to her that not here lay
her vocation; that a womanâ€™s power and charm reside in mystery, not
in muscular rant. but possibly rant is a sign of vitality: it mars the

contemplated her flushed face and excited gestures with a certain
approval. he forebore to repress the sources of youth.

nature--simplest of topics, he thought--lay around them. he praised the
pine-woods, the deep lasts of bracken, the crimson leaves that spotted
the hurt-bushes, the serviceable beauty of the turnpike road. the
outdoor world was not very familiar to him, and occasionally he went
wrong in a question of fact. mrs. honeychurchâ€™s mouth twitched when he
spoke of the perpetual green of the larch.

â€œi count myself a lucky person,â€ he concluded, â€œwhen iâ€™m in london i
feel i could never live out of it. when iâ€™m in the country i feel the
same about the country. after all, i do believe that birds and trees and

mrs. honeychurch started and smiled. she had not been attending.
cecil, who was rather crushed on the front seat of the victoria, felt
irritable, and determined not to say anything interesting again.

lucy had not attended either. her brow was wrinkled, and she still
looked furiously cross--the result, he concluded, of too much moral
gymnastics. it was sad to see her thus blind to the beauties of an
august wood.

hills?â€™ let us take mrs. honeychurchâ€™s advice and hate clergymen no
more. whatâ€™s this place?â€

â€œsummer street, of course,â€ said lucy, and roused herself.

the woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was
occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled
spire. mr. beebeâ€™s house was near the church. in height it scarcely
exceeded the cottages. some great mansions were at hand, but they were

in nottingham lace. â€œcissieâ€ was to let. three notice-boards, belonging
to dorking agents, lolled on her fence and announced the not surprising
fact. her paths were already weedy; her pocket-handkerchief of a lawn
was yellow with dandelions.

â€œthe place is ruined!â€ said the ladies mechanically. â€œsummer street will
never be the same again.â€

as the carriage passed, â€œcissieâ€™sâ€ door opened, and a gentleman came out
of her.

â€œstop!â€ cried mrs. honeychurch, touching the coachman with her parasol.
â€œhereâ€™s sir harry. now we shall know. sir harry, pull those things down
at once!â€

sir harry otway--who need not be described--came to the carriage and
said â€œmrs. honeychurch, i meant to. i canâ€™t, i really canâ€™t turn out
miss flack.â€

â€œam i not always right? she ought to have gone before the contract was
signed. does she still live rent free, as she did in her nephewâ€™s time?â€

â€œbut what can i do?â€ he lowered his voice.

mr. flack replied that all the columns had been ordered, adding, â€œand
all the capitals different--one with dragons in the foliage, another
approaching to the ionian style, another introducing mrs. flackâ€™s
initials--everyone different.â€ for he had read his ruskin. he built
his villas according to his desire; and not until he had inserted an
immovable aunt into one of them did sir harry buy.

this futile and unprofitable transaction filled the knight with sadness
as he leant on mrs. honeychurchâ€™s carriage. he had failed in his duties
to the country-side, and the country-side was laughing at him as well.
he had spent money, and yet summer street was spoilt as much as ever.
all he could do now was to find a desirable tenant for â€œcissieâ€--some
one really desirable.

â€œthe rent is absurdly low,â€ he told them, â€œand perhaps i am an easy
landlord. but it is such an awkward size. it is too large for the
peasant class and too small for any one the least like ourselves.â€

unsatisfactory--people swindlers, or not respectable. and oh, the
deceit! i have seen a good deal of the seamy side this last week. the
deceit of the most promising people. my dear lucy, the deceit!â€

she nodded.

â€œmy advice,â€ put in mrs. honeychurch, â€œis to have nothing to do with
lucy and her decayed gentlewomen at all. i know the type. preserve me
from people who have seen better days, and bring heirlooms with them
that make the house smell stuffy. itâ€™s a sad thing, but iâ€™d far rather

come down.â€

â€œitâ€™s i who am tiresome,â€ he replied. â€œi oughtnâ€™t to come with my

will only say that i cannot be too careful, which is quite true, but no
real help.â€

â€œthen may i write to my misses alan?â€

â€œplease!â€

but his eye wavered when mrs. honeychurch exclaimed:

â€œbeware! they are certain to have canaries. sir harry, beware of
canaries: they spit the seed out through the bars of the cages and then
the mice come. beware of women altogether. only let to a man.â€

remark.

sir harry blushed. neither he nor cecil enjoyed these open compliments
to their sex. even the exclusion of the dirty did not leave them much
distinction. he suggested that mrs. honeychurch, if she had time, should
descend from the carriage and inspect â€œcissieâ€ for herself. she was
delighted. nature had intended her to be poor and to live in such a
house. domestic arrangements always attracted her, especially when they
were on a small scale.

cecil pulled lucy back as she followed her mother.

â€œmrs. honeychurch,â€ he said, â€œwhat if we two walk home and leave you?â€

â€œcertainly!â€ was her cordial reply.

himself. soon after his marriage the social atmosphere began to alter.
other houses were built on the brow of that steep southern slope and
others, again, among the pine-trees behind, and northward on the chalk
barrier of the downs. most of these houses were larger than windy

from london, and who mistook the honeychurches for the remnants of an
indigenous aristocracy. he was inclined to be frightened, but his wife

â€œminnie, donâ€™t you listen to her.â€

â€œsaturn doesnâ€™t bounce.â€

â€œsaturn bounces enough.â€

â€œno, he doesnâ€™t.â€

â€œwell; he bounces better than the beautiful white devil.â€

â€œhush, dear,â€ said mrs. honeychurch.

â€œbut look at lucy--complaining of saturn, and all the timeâ€™s got the
beautiful white devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. thatâ€™s right,
minnie, go for her--get her over the shins with the racquet--get her
over the shins!â€

lucy fell, the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand.

mr. beebe picked it up, and said: â€œthe name of this ball is vittoria
corombona, please.â€ but his correction passed unheeded.

freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little

â€œemerson. iâ€™ll bet you anything you like.â€

â€œwhat a weathercock sir harry is,â€ said lucy quietly. â€œi wish i had
never bothered over it at all.â€

then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. mr. beebe,
whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that that was
the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.

meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs. honeychurch from
the contemplation of her own abilities.

â€œemerson, freddy? do you know what emersons they are?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know whether theyâ€™re any emersons,â€ retorted freddy, who was
democratic. like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally
attracted by the idea of equality, and the undeniable fact that there
are different kinds of emersons annoyed him beyond measure.

â€œi trust they are the right sort of person. all right, lucyâ€--she was
sitting up again--â€œi see

when she exclaimed, â€œbut cecilâ€™s emersons--they canâ€™t possibly be the
same ones--there is that--â€ he did not consider that the exclamation
was strange, but saw in it an opportunity of diverting the conversation
while she recovered her composure. he diverted it as follows:

â€œthe emersons who were at florence, do you mean? no, i donâ€™t suppose it
will prove to be them. it is probably a long cry from them to friends
of mr. vyseâ€™s. oh, mrs. honeychurch, the oddest people! the queerest
people! for our part we liked them, didnâ€™t we?â€ he appealed to lucy.
â€œthere was a great scene over some violets. they picked violets and
filled all the vases in the room of these very miss alans who have
failed to come to cissie villa. poor little ladies! so shocked and so
pleased. it used to be one of miss catharineâ€™s great stories. â€˜my dear
sister loves flowers,â€™ it began. they found the whole room a mass of
blue--vases and jugs--and the sto

â€œthese particular emersons consisted of a father and a son--the son
a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, i fancy, but very
immature--pessimism, et cetera. our special joy was the father--such a
sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.â€

in his normal state mr. beebe would never have repeated such gossip,
but he was trying to shelter lucy in her little trouble. he repeated any
rubbish that came into his head.

â€œmurdered his wife?â€ said mrs. honeychurch. â€œlucy, donâ€™t desert us--go
on playing bumble-puppy. really, the pension bertolini must have been
the oddest place. thatâ€™s the second murderer iâ€™ve heard of as being
there. whatever was charlotte doing to stop? by-the-by, we really must
ask charlotte here some time.â€

mr. beebe could recall no second murderer. he suggested that his hostess
was mistaken. at the hint of opposition she warmed. she was perfectly
sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had

ough able to look after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of mr. vyse. his idea of bringing the emersons to
windy corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. sir harry otway signed the agreement,
met mr. emerson, who was duly disillusioned. the miss alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. mr. beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told mrs. honeychurch that freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. indeed, so ample was the museâ€™s equipment that she
permitted mr. harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head,
to be forgotten, and to die.

lucy--to descend from bright heaven to earth, whereon there are shadows
because there are hills--lucy was at first plunged into despair, but
settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.
now that she was engaged, the emersons would scarcely insult her and

cannot tell whether our secret is important or not. were lucy and her
cousin closeted with a great thing which would destroy cecilâ€™s life if
he discovered it, or with a little thing which he would laugh at? miss
bartlett suggested the former. perhaps she was right. it had become a
great thing now. left to herself, lucy would have told her mother

and even with cecil she was mechanical, and behaved as if he was not one

â€œmake lucy one of us,â€ she said, looking round intelligently at the end
of each sentence, and straining her lips apart until she spoke again.
â€œlucy is becoming wonderful--wonderful.â€

â€œher music always was wonderful.â€

â€œyes, but she is purging off the honeychurch taint, most excellent
honeychurches, but you know what i mean. she is not always quoting
servants, or asking one how the pudding is made.â€

â€œi fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. what have they
got? byron. exactly. a shropshire lad. never heard of it. the way of

generation knows its own business, honeychurch.â€

â€œmr. beebe, look at that,â€ said freddy in awestruck tones.

on the cornice of the wardrobe, the hand of an amateur had painted this
inscription: â€œmistrust all enterprises that require new clothes.â€

â€œi know. isnâ€™t it jolly? i like that. iâ€™m certain thatâ€™s the old manâ€™s

george ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.

â€œlet me introduce mr. honeychurch, a neighbour.â€

then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. perhaps he was shy,
perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that georgeâ€™s face wanted
washing. at all events he greeted him with, â€œhow dâ€™ye do? come and have
a bathe.â€

â€œoh, all right,â€ said george, impassive.

mr. beebe was highly entertained.

â€œâ€˜how dâ€™ye do? how dâ€™ye do? come and have a bathe,â€™â€ he chuckled.
â€œthatâ€™s the best conversational opening iâ€™ve ever heard. but iâ€™m

philosophy that was approaching him.

â€œi believed in a return to nature once. but how can we return to
nature when we have never been with her? to-day, i believe that we must
discover nature. after many conquests we shall attain simplicity. it is

â€œhow do you do? very glad to see you, and that you are taking george for

is a duty. i am sure that she will be happy, for we know mr. vyse, too.

â€œit is. i have reflected. it is fate. everything is fate. we are flung
together by fate, drawn apart by fate--flung together, drawn apart. the
twelve winds blow us--we settle nothing--â€

â€œyou have not reflected at all,â€ rapped the clergyman. â€œlet me give you
a useful tip, emerson: attribute nothing to fate. donâ€™t say, â€˜i didnâ€™t

did you first meet miss honeychurch and myself?â€

â€œitaly.â€

â€œand where did you meet mr. vyse, who is going to marry miss

â€œnational gallery.â€

â€œlooking at italian art. there you are, and yet you talk of coincidence
and fate. you naturally seek out things italian, and so do we and our
friends. this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.â€

â€œit is fate that i am here,â€ persisted george. â€œbut you can call it
italy if it makes you less unhappy.â€

mr. beebe slid away

stcoat under his arm, george with a wide-awake
hat on his dripping hair.

â€œthatâ€™ll do!â€ shouted mr. beebe, remembering that after all he was in
his own parish. then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a rural
dean. â€œhi! steady on! i see people coming you fellows!â€

yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.

â€œhi! hi! ladies!â€

neither george nor freddy was truly refined. still, they did not hear
mr. beebeâ€™s last warning or they would have avoided mrs. honeychurch,
cecil, and lucy, who were walking down to call on old mrs. butterworth.
freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some
bracken. george whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the
path to the pond, still clad in mr. beebeâ€™s hat.

â€œgracious alive!â€ cried mrs. honeychurch. â€œwhoever were those
unfortunate people? oh, dears, look away! and poor mr. beebe, too!
whatever has happened?â€

â€œcome this way immediately,â€ commanded cecil, who always fel

t that he
must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he
knew not against what. he led them now towards the bracken where freddy
sat concealed.

â€œoh, poor mr. beebe! was that his waistcoat we left in the path? cecil,
mr. beebeâ€™s waistcoat--â€

â€œno business of ours,â€ said cecil, glancing at lucy, who was all parasol
and evidently â€˜minded.â€™

â€œi fancy mr. beebe jumped back into the pond.â€

â€œthis way, please, mrs. honeychurch, this way.â€

they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant
expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.

â€œwell, i canâ€™t help it,â€ said a voice close ahead, and freddy reared a
freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds. â€œi canâ€™t
be trodden on, can i?â€

â€œgood gracious me, dear; so itâ€™s you! what miserable management! why not
have a comfortable bath at home, with hot and cold laid on?â€

for mr. beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface
garments of an intimate nature did float; while george, the world-weary
george, shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish.

â€œand me, iâ€™ve swallowed one,â€ answered he of the bracken. â€œiâ€™ve
swallowed a pollywog. it wriggleth in my tummy. i shall die--emerson you
beast, youâ€™ve got on my bags.â€

â€œhush, dears,â€ said mrs. honeychurch, who found it impossible to remain
shocked. â€œand do be sure you dry yourselves thoroughly first. all these
colds come of not drying thoroughly.â€

â€œmother, do come away,â€ said lucy. â€œoh for goodnessâ€™ sake, do come.â€

â€œhullo!â€ cried george, so that again the ladies stopped.

he regarded himself as dressed. barefoot, bare-chested, radiant and
personable against the shadowy woods, he called:

â€œhullo, miss honeychurch! hullo!â€

â€œbow, lucy; better bow. whoever is

miss honeychurch bowed.

that evening and all that night the water ran away. on the morrow the
pool had shrunk to its old size and lost its glory. it had been a
call to the blood and to the relaxed will, a passing benediction whose
influence did not pass, a holiness, a spell, a momentary chalice for
youth.

n a way that promised well
for their married peace. no one is perfect, and surely it is wiser to
discover the imperfections before wedlock. miss bartlett, indeed, though
not in word, had taught the girl that this our life contains nothing
satisfactory. lucy, though she disliked the teacher, regarded the
teaching as profound, and applied it to her lover.

â€œlucy,â€ said her mother, when they got home, â€œis anything the matter
with cecil?â€

the question was ominous; up till now mrs. honeychurch had behaved with
charity and restraint.

â€œno, i donâ€™t think so, mother; cecilâ€™s all right.â€

â€œperhaps heâ€™s tired.â€

lucy compromised: perhaps cecil was a little tired.

â€œbecause otherwiseâ€--she pulled out her bonnet-pins with gathering
displeasure--â€œbecause otherwise i cannot account for him.â€

â€œi do think mrs. butterworth is rather tiresome, if you mean that.â€

girl, and nothing will

trouble ahead. â€œitâ€™s part of his ideals--it is really that that makes
him sometimes seem--â€

â€œoh, rubbish! if high ideals make a young man rude, the sooner he gets
rid of them the better,â€ said mrs. honeychurch, handing her the bonnet.

â€œnow, mother! iâ€™ve seen you cross with mrs. butterworth yourself!â€

â€œnot in that way. at times i could wring her neck. but not in that way.
no. it is the same with cecil all over.â€

â€œby-the-by--i never told you. i had a letter from charlotte while i was
away in london.â€

this attempt to divert the conversation was too puerile, and mrs.
honeychurch resented it.

â€œsince cecil came back from london, nothing appears to please him.

london, would not come forth in an effective form. the two civilizations
had clashed--cecil hinted that they might--and she was dazzled and
bewildered, as though the radiance that lies behind all civilization
had blinded her eyes. good taste and bad taste were only catchwords,
garments of diverse cut; and music itself dissolved to a whisper through
pine-trees, where the song is not distinguishable from the comic song.

she remained in much embarrassment, while mrs. honeychurch changed
her frock for dinner; and every now and then she said a word, and made
things no better. there was no concealing the fact, cecil had meant
to be supercilious, and he had succeeded. and lucy--she knew not
why--wished that the trouble could have come at any other time.

â€œgo and dress, dear; youâ€™ll be late.â€

he seized her by the elbows and humorously danced her up and down the
passage. she pretended not to mind, but she could have screamed with
temper. cecil glanced at them as he proceeded to his toilet and they
impeded mary with her brood of hot-water cans. then mrs. honeychurch
opened her door and said: â€œlucy, what a noise youâ€™re making! i
have something to say to you. did you say you had had a letter from
charlotte?â€ and freddy ran away.

â€œyes. i really canâ€™t stop. i must dress too.â€

mrs. honeychurch might have flamed out. she did not. she said: â€œcome
here, old lady--thank you for putting away my bonnet--kiss me.â€ and,
though nothing is perfect, lucy felt for the moment that her mother and
windy corner and the weald in the declining sun were perfect.

so the grittiness went out of life. it generally did at windy corner.

nothing untoward occurred until the pudding. then freddy said:

reply.

â€œis he the clever sort, or is he a decent chap?â€

â€œask cecil; it is cecil who brought him here.â€

â€œhe is the clever sort, like myself,â€ said cecil.

freddy looked at him doubtfully.

â€œhow well did you know them at the bertolini?â€ asked mrs. honeychurch.

â€œoh, very slightly. i mean, charlotte knew them even less than i did.â€

â€œoh, that reminds me--you never told me what charlotte said in her
letter.â€

â€œone thing and another,â€ said lucy, wondering whether she would get
through the meal without a lie. â€œamong other things, that an awful
friend of hers had been bicycling through summer street, wondered if
sheâ€™d come up and see us, and mercifully didnâ€™t.â€

for nothing roused mrs. honeychurch so much as literature in the hands
of females. she would abandon every topic to inveigh against those women
who (instead of minding their houses and their children) seek notoriety
by print. her attitude was: â€œif books must be written, let them be
written by menâ€; and she developed it at great length, while cecil
yawned and freddy played at â€œthis year, next year, now, never,â€ with his
plum-stones, and lucy artfully fed the flames of her motherâ€™s wrath. but
soon the conflagration

â€œno, i donâ€™t. and no more does cecil. she gets on our nerves. you
havenâ€™t seen her lately, and donâ€™t realize how tiresome she can be,
though so good. so please, mother, donâ€™t worry us this last summer; but
spoil us by not asking her to come.â€

â€œhear, hear!â€ said cecil.

mrs. honeychurch, with more gravity than usual, and with more feeling
than she usually permitted herself, replied: â€œthis isnâ€™t very kind of
you two. you have each other and all these woods to walk in, so full of
beautiful things; and poor charlotte has only the water turned off and
plumbers. you are young, dears, and however clever young people are, and
however many books they read, they will never guess what it feels like
to grow old.â€

admirable cooking.

â€œi didnâ€™t mean the egg was well boiled,â€ corrected freddy, â€œbecause in
point of fact she forgot to take it off, and as a matter of fact i donâ€™t
care for eggs. i only meant how jolly kind she seemed.â€

cecil frowned again. oh, these honeychurches! eggs, boilers, hydrangeas,
maids--of such were their lives compact. â€œmay me and lucy get down from

â€œminnie, donâ€™t be late. here comes the horseâ€--it was always the horse,
never the carriage. â€œwhereâ€™s charlotte? run up and hurry her. why is she
so long? she had nothing to do. she never brings anything but blouses.
poor charlotte--how i do detest blouses! minnie!â€

mselves, and she did not want to
overhaul herself; she did not know it was done. honest orthodoxy
cecil respected, but he always assumed that honesty is the result of a
spiritual crisis; he could not imagine it as a natural birthright, that
might grow heavenward like flowers. all that he said on this subject
pained her, though he exuded tolerance from every pore; somehow the
emersons were different.

she saw the emersons after church. there was a line of carriages down
the road, and the honeychurch vehicle happened to be opposite cissie
villa. to save time, they walked over the green to it, and found father
and son smoking in the garden.

â€œintroduce me,â€ said her mother. â€œunless the young man considers that he
knows me already.â€

he probably did; but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them
formally. old mr. emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how
glad he was that she was going to be married. she said yes, she was glad
too; and then, as miss bartlett a

nd minnie were lingering behind with
mr. beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and
asked him how he liked his new house.

â€œvery much,â€ he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;
she had never known him offended before. he added: â€œwe find, though,
that the miss alans were coming, and that we have turned them out. women
mind such a thing. i am very much upset about it.â€

â€œi believe that there was some misunderstanding,â€ said mrs. honeychurch
uneasily.

â€œour landlord was told that we should be a different type of person,â€
 said george, who seemed disposed to carry the matter further. â€œhe
thought we should be artistic. he is disappointed.â€

â€œand i wonder whether we ought to write to the miss alans and offer to
give it up. what do you think?â€ he appealed to lucy.

â€œoh, stop now you have come,â€ said lucy lightly. she must avoid
censuring cecil. for it was on cecil that the little episode turned,
though his n

â€œso george says. he says that the miss alans must go to the wall. yet it
does seem so unkind.â€

â€œthere is only a certain amount of kindness in the world,â€ said george,
watching the sunlight flash on the panels of the passing carriages.

â€œyes!â€ exclaimed mrs. honeychurch. â€œthatâ€™s exactly what i say. why all
this twiddling and twaddling over two miss alans?â€

â€œthere is a certain amount of kindness, just as there is a certain
amount of light,â€ he continued in measured tones. â€œwe cast a shadow
on something wherever we stand, and it is no good moving from place to
place to save things; because the shadow always follows. choose a place
where you wonâ€™t do harm--yes, choose a place where you wonâ€™t do very
much harm, and stand in it for all you

se days.

she turned to george: â€œand then he wants to give up his house to the
miss alans.â€

â€œi know,â€ said george, and put his arm round his fatherâ€™s neck. the
kindness that mr. beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came
out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape--a touch of the
morning sun? she remembered that in all his perversities he had never
spoken against affection.

miss bartlett approached.

â€œyou know our cousin, miss bartlett,â€ said mrs. honeychurch pleasantly.
â€œyou met her with my daughter in florence.â€

â€œyes, indeed!â€ said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the
garden to meet the lady. miss bartlett promptly got into the victoria.
thus entrenched, she emitted a formal bow. it was the pension bertolini
again, the dining-table with the decanters of water and wine. it was the
old, old battle of the room with the view.

george did not respond to the bow. like any boy, he blushed and was
ashamed; he knew that t

â€œgeorge, donâ€™t go,â€ cried his father, who thought it a great treat for
people if his son would talk to them. â€œgeorge has been in such good
spirits today, and i am sure he will end by coming up this afternoon.â€

lucy caught her cousinâ€™s eye. something in its mute appeal made her
reckless. â€œyes,â€ she said, raising her voice, â€œi do hope he will.â€ then
she went to the carriage and murmured, â€œthe old man hasnâ€™t been told;
i knew it was all right.â€ mrs. honeychurch followed her, and they drove
away.

satisfactory that mr. emerson had not been told of the florence
escapade; yet lucyâ€™s spirits should not have leapt up as if she had
sighted the ramparts of heaven. satisfactory; yet surely she greeted
it with disproportionate joy. all the way home the horsesâ€™ hoofs sang a
tune to her: â€œhe has not told, he has not told.â€ her brain expanded the
melody: â€œhe has not told his father--to whom he tells all things. it was
not an exploit. he did not

n oneâ€™s nose at this. â€œthen certainly i wonâ€™t play,â€ said
cecil, while miss bartlett, under the impression that she was snubbing
george, added: â€œi agree with you, mr. vyse. you had much better not
play. much better not.â€

minnie, rushing in where cecil feared to tread, announced that she would
play. â€œi shall miss every ball anyway, so what does it matter?â€ but
sunday intervened and stamped heavily upon the kindly suggestion.

â€œthen it will have to be lucy,â€ said mrs. honeychurch; â€œyou must fall
back on lucy. there is no other way out of it. lucy, go and change your
frock.â€

lucyâ€™s sabbath was generally of this amphibious nature. she kept it
without hypocrisy in the morning, and broke it without reluctance in
the afternoon. as she changed her frock, she wondered whether cecil was
sneering at her; really she must overhaul herself and settle everything
up before she married him.

hypocrisy; they feel and produce discomfort wherever they go. they have
sinned against eros and against pallas athene, and not by any heavenly
intervention, but by the ordinary course of nature, those allied deities
will be avenged.

lucy entered this army when she pretended to george that she did not
love him, and pretended to cecil that she loved no one. the night
received her, as it had received miss bartlett thirty years before.



chapter xviii: lying to mr. beebe, mrs. honeychurch, freddy, and the
servants

windy corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet
down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses
that supported the hill. on either side of it was a shallow ravine,
filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran
the highway into the weald.

whenever mr. beebe crossed the ridge and caught sight of these noble
dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them, windy
corner,--he

 laughed. the situation was so glorious, the house so
commonplace, not to say impertinent. the late mr. honeychurch had
affected the cube, because it gave him the most accommodation for his
money, and the only addition made by his widow had been a small turret,
shaped like a rhinocerosâ€™ horn, where she could sit in wet weather and
watch the carts going up and down the road. so impertinent--and yet the
house â€œdid,â€ for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings
honestly. other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive
architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sed

ould not play the piano as she did. he had a theory that musicians are
incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want
and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their friends;
that their psychology is a modern development, and has not yet been
understood. this theory, had he known it, had possibly just been
illustrated by facts. ignorant of the events of yesterday he was only
riding over to get some tea, to see his niece, and to observe whether
miss honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies
to visit athens.

a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner, and just as he caught
sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly
when it reached the main road. therefore it must be the horse, who
always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him. the
door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom mr. beebe recognized
as cecil and freddy. they were an odd couple to go driving; but he s

going away, while freddy (a cap)--was seeing him to the station. they
walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the
carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.

they shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.

â€œso youâ€™re off for a minute, mr. vyse?â€ he asked.

cecil said, â€œyes,â€ while freddy edged away.

â€œi was coming to show you this delightful letter from those friends
of miss honeychurch.â€ he quoted from it. â€œisnâ€™t it wonderful? isnâ€™t it
romance? most certainly they will go to constantinople. they are taken
in a snare that cannot fail. they will end by going round the world.â€

cecil listened civilly, and said he was sure that lucy would be amused
and interested.

â€œisnâ€™t romance capricious! i never notice it in you young people; you
do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the

. oh, what a glorious riddance!â€ and, after a little thought, he
negotiated the slope into windy corner, light of heart. the house was
again as it ought to be--cut off forever from cecilâ€™s pretentious world.

he would find miss minnie down in the garden.

in the drawing-room lucy was tinkling at a mozart sonata. he hesitated a
moment, but went down the garden as requested. there he found a mournful
company. it was a blustering day, and the wind had taken and broken the
dahlias. mrs. honeychurch, who looked cross, was tying them up,
while miss bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of
assistance. at a little distance stood minnie and the â€œgarden-child,â€ a
minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.

â€œoh, how do you do, mr. beebe? gracious what a mess everything is! look
at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the
ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage
having to go out, when i h

one their due--does tie up dahlias properly.â€

evidently mrs. honeychurch was shattered.

â€œhow do you do?â€ said miss bartlett, with a meaning glance, as though
conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn
gales.

â€œhere, lennie, the bass,â€ cried mrs. honeychurch. the garden-child, who
did not know what bass was, stood rooted to the path with horror. minnie
slipped to her uncle and whispered that everyone was very disagreeable
to-day, and that it was not her fault if dahlia-strings would tear
longways instead of across.

â€œcome for a walk with me,â€ he told her. â€œyou have worried them as much
as they can stand. mrs. honeychurch, i only called in aimlessly. i shall
take her up to tea at the beehive tavern, if i may.â€

â€œoh, must you? yes

erated everyone, except minnie, by a refusal, she turned round and
exasperated minnie by an acceptance. as they walked up the garden, the
orange cactus fell, and mr. beebeâ€™s last vision was of the garden-child
clasping it like a lover, his dark head buried in a wealth of blossom.

â€œit is terrible, this havoc among the flowers,â€ he remarked.

â€œit is always terrible when the promise of months is destroyed in a
moment,â€ enunciated miss bartlett.

â€œperhaps we ought to send miss honeychurch down to her mother. or will
she come with us?â€

â€œi think we had better leave lucy to herself, and to her own pursuits.â€

â€œtheyâ€™re angry with miss honeychurch because she was late for
breakfast,â€ whispered minnie, â€œand floyd has gone, and mr. vyse has
gone, and freddy wonâ€™t play with me. in fact, uncle arthur, the house is
not at all what it was yesterday.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be a prig,â€ said her uncle arthur. â€œgo and put on your boots.â€

â€œhow do you do? miss bartlett and minnie are coming with me to tea at
the beehive. would you come too?â€

â€œi donâ€™t think i will, thank you.â€

â€œno, i didnâ€™t suppose you would care to much.â€

lucy turned to the piano and struck a few chords.

â€œhow delicate those sonatas are!â€ said mr. beebe, though at the bottom
of his heart, he thought them silly little things.

lucy passed into schumann.

â€œmiss honeychurch!â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œi met them on the hill. your brother told me.â€

â€œoh he did?â€ she sounded annoyed. mr. beebe felt hurt, for he had
thought that she would like him to be told.

â€œi neednâ€™t say that it will go no further.â€

â€œmother, charlotte, cecil, freddy, you,â€ said lucy, playing a note for
each person who knew, and then playing a sixth note.

â€œif youâ€™ll let me say so, i am very glad, and i am certain that you have
done the right thing.â€

other people would think, but they donâ€™t seem to.â€

â€œi could see that miss bartlett thought it unwise.â€

â€œso does mother. mother minds dreadfully.â€

â€œi am very sorry for that,â€ said mr. beebe with feeling.

mrs. honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as
much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. it was really
a ruse of lucyâ€™s to justify her despondency--a ruse of which she was not
herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.

â€œand freddy minds.â€

â€œstill, freddy never hit it off with vyse much, did he? i gathered that
he disliked the engagement, and felt it might separate him from you.â€

â€œboys are so odd.â€

â€œshe must spare me!â€ cried lucy, in growing excitement. â€œi simply must
go away. i have to.â€ she ran her fingers hysterically through her hair.
â€œdonâ€™t you see that i have to go away? i didnâ€™t realize at the time--and
of course i want to see constantinople so particularly.â€

â€œyou mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel--â€

â€œyes, yes. i knew youâ€™d understand.â€

mr. beebe did not quite understand. why could not miss honeychurch
repose in the bosom of her family? cecil had evidently taken up the
dignified line, and was not going to annoy her. then it struck him that
her family itself might be annoying. he hinted this to her, and she
accepted the hint eagerly.

â€œyes, of course; to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea
and everything has calmed down.â€

â€œi am afraid it has been a bothersome business,â€ he said gently.

â€œno, not at all. cecil was very kind indeed; only--i had better tell

mr. beebe considered.

â€œit is absolutely necessary,â€ she continued, lowering her veil and
whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
â€œi know--i know.â€ the darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd
woman really did know. â€œshe must not stop here a moment, and we must
keep quiet till she goes. i trust that the servants know nothing.
afterwards--but i may have said too much already. only, lucy and i are
helpless against mrs. honeychurch alone. if you help we may succeed.
otherwise--â€

â€œotherwise--?â€

â€œotherwise,â€ she repeated as if the word held finality.

â€œyes, i will help her,â€ said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm. â€œcome,
let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.â€

miss bartlett burst into florid gratitude. the tavern sign--a beehive
trimmed evenly with bees--creaked in the wind outside as she thanked
him. mr. beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did

flowers.

â€œit gets too dark,â€ she said hopelessly. â€œthis comes of putting off. we

go to greece. i donâ€™t know what the worldâ€™s coming to.â€

drawing-room, and mr. beebe heard her kiss lucy and say: â€œi am sorry i

they regarded travel as a species of warfare, only to be undertaken
by those who have been fully armed at the haymarket stores. miss

quinine could now be obtained in tabloids; paper soap was a great help
towards freshening up oneâ€™s face in the train. lucy promised, a little
depressed.

â€œbut, of course, you know all about these things, and you have mr. vyse

mrs. honeychurch, who had come up to town with her daughter, began to

perhaps he will come out and join you later on.â€

â€œbut why shouldnâ€™t it be everywhere in no time?â€

â€œbecause i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england. i

â€œhereâ€ was the british museum. mrs. honeychurch refused. if they must
take shelter, let it be in a shop. lucy felt contemptuous, for she was
on the tack of caring for greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a
mythical dictionary from mr. beebe to get up the names of the goddesses
and gods.

lucy was silent. she was drifting away from her mother. it was quite
easy to say, â€œbecause george emerson has been bothering me, and if he
hears iâ€™ve given up cecil may begin againâ€--quite easy, and it had
the incidental advantage of being true. but she could not say it. she
disliked confidences, for they might lead to self-knowledge and to that
king of terrors--light. ever since that last evening at florence she had
deemed it unwise to reveal her soul.

mrs. honeychurch, too, was silent. she was thinking, â€œmy daughter wonâ€™t
answer me; she would rather be with those inquisitive old maids than
with freddy and me. any rag, tag, and bobtail apparently does if she
can leave her home.â€ and as in her case thoughts never remained unspoken
long, she burst out with: â€œyouâ€™re tired of windy corner.â€

this was perfectly true. lucy had hoped to return to windy corner when
she escaped from cecil, but she discovered that her home existed no
longer. it migh

driven by nameless bewilderment, by what is in older people termed
â€œeccentricity,â€ lucy determined to make this point clear. â€œiâ€™ve seen the
world so little--i felt so out of things in italy. i have seen so little
of life; one ought to come up to london more--not a cheap ticket like
to-day, but to stop. i might even share a flat for a little with some
other girl.â€

â€œand mess with typewriters and latch-keys,â€ exploded mrs. honeychurch.
â€œand agitate and scream, and be carried off kicking by the police. and
call it a mission--when no one wants you! and call it duty--when
it means that you canâ€™t stand your own home! and call it work--when

blurred by the soft road. â€œcanâ€™t we have the hood down?â€ she demanded,
and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: â€œvery well, old lady, stop
the horse.â€ and the horse was stopped, and lucy and powell wrestled with
the hood, and squirted water down mrs. honeychurchâ€™s neck. but now
that the hood was down, she did see something that she would have
missed--there were no lights in the windows of cissie villa, and round
the garden gate she fancied she saw a padlock.

me first. he ought not to have tried. i knew nothing about it at all.â€

if only she could remember how to behave!

 i said: â€˜when love
comes, that is reality.â€™ i said: â€˜passion does not blind. no. passion
is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever
really understand.â€™â€ he sighed: â€œtrue, everlastingly true, though my day
is over, and though there is the result. poor boy! he is so sorry!
he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that
whatever you felt you did not mean. yetâ€--his voice gathered strength:
he spoke out to make certain--â€œmiss honeychurch, do you remember italy?â€

lucy selected a book--a volume of old testament commentaries. holding
it up to her eyes, she said: â€œi have no wish to discuss italy or any
subject connected with your son.â€

â€œbut you do remember it?â€

â€œhe has misbehaved himself from the first.â€

â€œi only was told that he loved you last sunday. i never could judge
behaviour. i--i--suppose he has.â€

feeling a little steadier, she put the book back and turned round to
him. his face was droop

ing and swollen, but his eyes, though they were
sunken deep, gleamed with a childâ€™s courage.

â€œwhy, he has behaved abominably,â€ she said. â€œi am glad he is sorry. do
you know what he did?â€

â€œnot â€˜abominably,â€™â€ was the gentle correction. â€œhe only tried when he
should not have tried. you have all you want, miss honeychurch: you are
going to marry the man you love. do not go out of georgeâ€™s life saying
he is abominable.â€

â€œno, of course,â€ said lucy, ashamed at the reference to cecil.
â€œâ€˜abominableâ€™ is much too strong. i am sorry i used it about your son. i
think i will go to church, after all. my mother and my cousin have gone.
i shall not be so very late--â€

â€œespecially as he has gone under,â€ he said quietly.

â€œwhat was that?â€

â€œgone under naturally.â€ he beat his palms toge

ght that fever
when he was twelve and she turned round. she thought it a judgement.â€ he
shuddered. â€œoh, horrible, when we had given up that sort of thing and
broken away from her parents. oh, horrible--worst of all--worse than
death, when you have made a little clearing in the wilderness, planted
your little garden, let in your sunlight, and then the weeds creep in
again! a judgement! and our boy had typhoid because no clergyman had
dropped water on him in church! is it possible, miss honeychurch? shall
we slip back into the darkness for ever?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ gasped lucy. â€œi donâ€™t understand this sort of thing. i
was not meant to understand it.â€

â€œbut mr. eager--he came when i was out, and acted according to his
principles. i donâ€™t blame him or any one... but by the time george
was well she was ill. he made her think about sin, and she went under
thinking about it.â€

it was thus that mr. emerson had murdered his wife in the sight of god.

â€œoh, how te

hey were piled on the
tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. to lucy who could not see
that mr. emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from mr. beebe
chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion--it seemed dreadful that the
old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be
dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.

more certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.

â€œno, please sit still. i think i will sit in the carriage.â€

â€œmiss honeychurch, you do sound tired.â€

â€œnot a bit,â€ said lucy, with trembling lips.

â€œbut you are, and thereâ€™s a look of george about you. and what were you
saying about going abroad?â€

she was silent.

â€œgreeceâ€--and she saw that he was thinking the word over--â€œgreece; but
you were to be married this year, i thought.â€

â€œnot till january, it wasnâ€™t,â€ said lucy, clasping her hands. would she
tell an actual lie when it came to the point?

â€œi suppose that mr. vyse is goin

her company. itâ€™s pouring again. the entire congregation,
which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands
waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. did powell go
round?â€

â€œi think so; iâ€™ll see.â€

â€œno--of course, iâ€™ll see. how are the miss alans?â€

â€œvery well, thank you.â€

â€œdid you tell mr. emerson about greece?â€

â€œi--i did.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you think it very plucky of her, mr. emerson, to undertake the
two miss alans? now, miss honeychurch, go back--keep warm. i think three
is such a courageous number to go travelling.â€ and he hurried off to the
stables.

â€œhe is not going,â€ she said hoarsely. â€œi made a slip. mr. vyse does stop
behind in england.â€

somehow it was impossible to cheat this old man. to george, to cecil,
she would have lied again; but he seemed so near the end of things, so
dignified in his approach to the gulf, of which he gave one account, and
the books that surrounded him another, so mild to the

 rough paths that
he had traversed, that the true chivalry--not the worn-out chivalry
of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the
old--awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that cecil was
not her companion to greece. and she spoke so seriously that the risk
became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: â€œyou are leaving
him? you are leaving the man you love?â€

â€œi--i had to.â€

â€œwhy, miss honeychurch, why?â€

terror came over her, and she lied again. she made the long, convincing
speech that she had made to mr. beebe, and intended to make to the world
when she announced that her engagement was no more. he heard her in
silence, and then said: â€œmy dear, i am worried about you. it seems to
meâ€--dreamily; she was not alarmed--â€œthat you are in a muddle.â€

she shook her head.

â€œtake an old manâ€™s word; thereâ€™s nothing worse than a muddle in all the
world. it is easy to fa

 might have avoided. we can help one another but little. i
used to think i could teach young people the whole of life, but i know
better now, and all my teaching of george has come down to this: beware
of muddle. do you remember in that church, when you pretended to be
annoyed with me and werenâ€™t? do you remember before, when you refused
the room with the view? those were muddles--little, but ominous--and i
am fearing that you are in one now.â€ she was silent. â€œdonâ€™t trust me,
miss honeychurch. though life is very glorious, it is difficult.â€
 she was still silent. â€œâ€˜lifeâ€™ wrote a friend of mine, â€˜is a public
performance on the violin, in which you must learn the instrument as you
go along.â€™ i think he puts it well. man has to pick up the use of his
functions as he goes along--especially the function of love.â€ then he
burst out excitedly; â€œthatâ€™s it; thatâ€™s what i mean. you love george!â€
 and after his long preamble, the three words burst against lucy like

â€œi mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george. they have
loved one another all along.â€

mr. beebe looked at the sobbing girl. he was very quiet, and his white
face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. a long black
column, he stood and awaited her reply.

â€œi shall never marry him,â€ quavered lucy.

a look of contempt came over him, and he said, â€œwhy not?â€

â€œmr. beebe--i have misled you--i have misled myself--â€

â€œoh, rubbish, miss honeychurch!â€

â€œit is not rubbish!â€ said the old man hotly. â€œitâ€™s the part of people
that you donâ€™t understand.â€

mr. beebe laid his hand on the old manâ€™s shoulder pleasantly.

â€œlucy! lucy!â€ called voices from the carriage.

â€œmr. beebe, could you help me?â€

he looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: â€œi
am more grieved than i can possibly express. it is lamentable,
lamentable--incredible.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with the boy?â€ fired up the other

 again.

â€œnothing, mr. emerson, except that he no longer interests me. marry
george, miss honeychurch. he will do admirably.â€

he walked out and left them. they heard him guiding his mother
up-stairs.

â€œlucy!â€ the voices called.

she turned to mr. emerson in despair. but his face revived her. it was
the face of a saint who understood.

â€œnow it is all dark. now beauty and passion seem never to have existed.

if i were george, and gave you one kiss, it would make you brave. you
