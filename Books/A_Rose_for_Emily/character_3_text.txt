when miss emily grierson died, our whole town went to her funeral: the men through a sort of respectful affection for a fallen monument, the women mostly out of curiosity to see the inside of her house, which no one save an old man-servant--a combined gardener and cook--had seen in at least ten years.
it was a big, squarish frame house that had once been white, decorated with cupolas and spires and scrolled balconies in the heavily lightsome style of the seventies, set on what had once been our most select street. but

her father's death she went out very little; after her sweetheart went away, people hardly saw her at all. a few of the ladies had the temerity to call, but were not received, and the only sign of life about the place was the negro man--a young man then--going in and out with a market basket.
"just as if a man--any man--could keep a kitchen properly, "the ladies said; so they were not surprised when the smell developed. it was another link between the gross, teeming world and the high and mighty griersons.
a neighbor, a woman, complained to the mayor, judge stevens, eighty years old.
"but what will you have me do about it, madam?" he said.
"why, send her word to stop it," the woman said. "isn't there a law? "
"i'm sure that won't be necessary," judge stevens said. "it's probably just a snake or a rat that nigger of hers killed in the yard. i'll speak to him about it."
the next day he received two more complaints, one from a man who came in diffident deprecation. "we really must do something abo

e outbuildings. as they recrossed the lawn, a window that had been dark was lighted and miss emily sat in it, the light behind her, and her upright torso motionless as that of an idol. they crept quietly across the lawn and into the shadow of the locusts that lined the street. after a week or two the smell went away.
that was when people had begun to feel really sorry for her. people in our town, remembering how old lady wyatt, her great-aunt, had gone completely crazy at last, believed that the griersons held themselves a little too high for what they really were. none of the young men were quite good enough for miss emily and such. we had long thought of them as a tableau, miss emily a slender figure in white in the background, her father a spraddled silhouette in the foreground, his back to her and clutching a horsewhip, the two of them framed by the back-flung front door. so when she got to be thirty and was still single, we were not pleased exactly, but vindicated; even with insanity in th

ear him cuss the niggers, and the niggers singing in time to the rise and fall of picks. pretty soon he knew everybody in town. whenever you heard a lot of laughing anywhere about the square, homer barron would be in the center of the group. presently we began to see him and miss emily on sunday afternoons driving in the yellow-wheeled buggy and the matched team of bays from the livery stable.
at first we were glad that miss emily would have an interest, because the ladies all said, "of course a grierson would not think seriously of a northerner, a day laborer." but there were still others, older people, who said that even grief could not cause a real lady to forget noblesse oblige- -
without calling it noblesse oblige. they just said, "poor emily. her kinsfolk should come to her." she had some kin in alabama; but years ago her father had fallen out with them over the estate of old lady wyatt, the crazy woman, and there was no communication between the two families. they had not even been repre

eople said, "poor emily," the whispering began. "do you suppose it's really so?" they said to one another. "of course it is. what else could . . ." this behind their hands; rustling of craned silk and satin behind jalousies closed upon the sun of sunday afternoon as the thin, swift clop-clop-clop of the matched team passed: "poor emily."
she carried her head high enough--even when we believed that she was fallen. it was as if she demanded more than ever the recognition of her dignity as the last grierson; as if it had wanted that touch of earthiness to reaffirm her imperviousness. like when she bought the rat poison, the arsenic. that was over a year after they had begun to say "poor emily," and while the two female cousins were visiting her.
"i want some poison," she said to the druggist. she was over thirty then, still a slight woman, though thinner than usual, with cold, haughty black eyes in a face the flesh of which was strained across the temples and about the eyesockets as you imagine a

ad blood-kin under her roof again and we sat back to watch developments. at first nothing happened. then we were sure that they were to be married. we learned that miss emily had been to the jeweler's and ordered a man's toilet set in silver, with the letters h. b. on each piece. two days later we learned that she had bought a complete outfit of men's clothing, including a nightshirt, and we said, "they are married." we were really glad. we were glad because the two female cousins were even more grierson than miss emily had ever been.
so we were not surprised when homer barron--the streets had been finished some time since--was gone. we were a little disappointed that there was not a public blowing-off, but we believed that he had gone on to prepare for miss emily's coming, or to give her a chance to get rid of the cousins. (by that time it was a cabal, and we were all miss emily's allies to help circumvent the cousins.) sure enough, after another week they departed. and, as we had expected all
