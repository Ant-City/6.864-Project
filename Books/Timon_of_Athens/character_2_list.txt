Alcibiades - 
      
        Alcibiades is an acquaintance of Timon, apparently a soldier. When one of his friends is sentenced to death by the Senators, Alcibiades protests and is banished. He promises to raise an army and conquer Athens. He encounters Timon in the woods after he has left Athens, and offers to help him after he sacks Athens. Timon enthusiastically supports the idea of destroying Athens, and gives Alcibiades a sum of gold to aid his army. So when Alcibiades stands outside the gates of Athens, he attempts to right both the wrongs done to him and those done to Timon, becoming his final champion after his death.
