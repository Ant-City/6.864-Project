lunatics.  just what society should be.

lord caversham.  hum!  which is goring?  beautiful idiot, or the other
thing?

mabel chiltern.  [_gravely_.]  i have been obliged for the present to put
lord goring into a class quite by himself.  but he is developing
charmingly!

lord caversham.  into what?

mabel chiltern.  [_with a little curtsey_.]  i hope to let you know very
soon, lord caversham!

_kindly_, _popular woman_, _with gray hair à la marquise and good lace_.
mrs. cheveley, _who accompanies her_, _is tall and rather slight_.  _lips

_venetian red hair_, _aquiline nose_, _and long throat_.  _rouge
accentuates the natural paleness of her complexion_.  _gray-green eyes

schools_.]

lady markby.  good evening, dear gertrude!  so kind of you to let me
bring my friend, mrs. cheveley.  two such charming women should know each
other!

lady chiltern.  [_advances towards_ mrs. cheveley _with a sweet smile_.
_then suddenly stops_, _and bows rather distantly_.]  i think mrs.
cheveley and i have met before.  i did not know she had married a second
time.

can, don’t they?  it is most fashionable.  [_to_ duchess of marybor

sir robert chiltern.  good evening, lady markby!  i hope you have brought
sir john with you?

lady markby.  oh! i have brought a much more charming person than sir
john.  sir john’s temper since he has taken seriously to politics has
become quite unbearable.  really, now that the house of commons is trying
to become useful, it does a great deal of harm.

sir robert chiltern.  i hope not, lady markby.  at any rate we do our
best to waste the public time, don’t we?  but who is this charming person
you have been kind enough to bring to us?

lady markby.  her name is mrs. cheveley!  one of the dorsetshire
cheveleys, i suppose.  but i really don’t know.  families are so mixed
nowadays.  indeed, as a rule, everybody turns out to be somebody else.

sir robert chiltern.  mrs. cheveley?  i seem to know the name.

lady markby.  she has just arrived from vienna.

sir robert chiltern.  ah! yes.  i think i know whom you mean.

lady markby.  oh! she goes everywhere there, and has such pleasant
scandals about all her friends.  i really must go to vienna next winter.
i hope there is a good chef at the embassy.

sir robert chiltern.  if there is not, the ambassador will certainly have
to be recalled.  pray point out mrs. cheveley to me.  i should like to
see her.

lady markby.  let me introduce you.  [_to_ mrs. cheveley.]  my dear, sir
robert chiltern is dying to know you!

lord goring.  quite dreadful!  when i think of them at night i go to
sleep at once.

mabel chiltern.  well, i delight in your bad qualities.  i wouldn’t have
you part with one of them.

lord goring.  how very nice of you!  but then you are always nice.  by
the way, i want to ask you a question, miss mabel.  who brought mrs.
cheveley here?  that woman in heliotrope, who has just gone out of the
room with your brother?

mabel chiltern.  oh, i think lady markby brought her.  why do you ask?

lord goring.  i haven’t seen her for years, that is all.

mabel chiltern.  what an absurd reason!

lord goring.  all reasons are absurd.

mabel chiltern.  what sort of a woman is she?

lord goring.  oh! a genius in the daytime and a beauty at night!

mabel chiltern.  i dislike her already.

lord goring.  that shows your admirable good taste.

vicomte de nanjac.  [_approaching_.]  ah, the english young lady is the
dragon of good taste, is she not?  quite the drag

mrs. cheveley.  thank you.  i knew we should come to an amicable
agreement.  i understood your nature from the first.  i analysed you,
though you did not adore me.  and now you can get my carriage for me, sir
robert.  i see the people coming up from supper, and englishmen always
get romantic after a meal, and that bores me dreadfully.  [_exit_ sir
robert chiltern.]

basildon, mrs. marchmont, vicomte de nanjac, mr. montford.]

lady markby.  well, dear mrs. cheveley, i hope you have enjoyed yourself.
sir robert is very entertaining, is he not?

mrs. cheveley.  most entertaining!  i have enjoyed my talk with him
immensely.

lady markby.  he has had a very interesting and brilliant career.  and he
has married a most admirable wife.  lady chiltern is a woman of the very
highest principles, i am glad to say.  i am a little too old now, myse

to trouble about setting a good example, but i always admire people who
do.  and lady chiltern has a very ennobling effect on life, though her
dinner-parties are rather dull sometimes.  but one can’t have everything,
can one?  and now i must go, dear.  shall i call for you to-morrow?

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.

lady markby.  we might drive in the park at five.  everything looks so
fresh in the park now!

mrs. cheveley.  except the people!

lady markby.  perhaps the people are a little jaded.  i have often
observed that the season as it goes on produces a kind of softening of
the brain.  however, i think anything is better than high intellectual
pressure.  that is the most unbecoming thing there is.  it makes the
noses of the young girls so particularly large.  and there is nothing so
difficult to marry as a large nose; men don’t like them.  good-night,
dear!  [_to_ lady chiltern.]  good-night, gertrude!  [_goes out on_ lord

you know who is coming to see you?  that dreadful mrs. cheveley, in a
most lovely gown.  did you ask her?

lady chiltern.  [_rising_.]  mrs. cheveley!  coming to see me?
impossible!

mabel chiltern.  i assure you she is coming upstairs, as large as life
and not nearly so natural.

lady chiltern.  you need not wait, mabel.  remember, lady basildon is
expecting you.

mabel chiltern.  oh! i must shake hands with lady markby.  she is
delightful.  i love being scolded by her.

lady chiltern.  [_advancing to meet them_.]  dear lady markby, how nice
of you to come and see me!  [_shakes hands with her_, _and bows somewhat
distantly to_ mrs. cheveley.]  won’t you sit down, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.  isn’t that miss chiltern?  i should like so much
to know her.

lady chiltern.  mabel, mrs. cheveley wishes

 to know you.

[mabel chiltern _gives a little nod_.]

mrs. cheveley [_sitting down_.]  i thought your frock so charming last
night, miss chiltern.  so simple and . . . suitable.

mabel chiltern.  really?  i must tell my dressmaker.  it will be such a
surprise to her.  good-bye, lady markby!

lady markby.  going already?

mabel chiltern.  i am so sorry but i am obliged to.  i am just off to
rehearsal.  i have got to stand on my head in some tableaux.

lady markby.  on your head, child?  oh! i hope not.  i believe it is most
unhealthy.  [_takes a seat on the sofa next_ lady chiltern.]

mabel chiltern.  but it is for an excellent charity: in aid of the
undeserving, the only people i am really interested in.  i am the
secretary, and tommy trafford is treasurer.

mrs. cheveley.  and what is lord goring?

mabel chiltern.  oh! lord goring is president.

mrs. cheveley.  the post should suit him admirably, unless he has
deteriorated since i knew him first.

little too modern, perhaps.  nothing is so dangerous as being too modern.
one is apt to grow old-fashioned quite suddenly.  i have known many
instances of it.

mabel chiltern.  what a dreadful prospect!

lady markby.  ah! my dear, you need not be nervous.  you will always be
as pretty as possible.  that is the best fashion there is, and the only
fashion that england succeeds in setting.

mabel chiltern.  [_with a curtsey_.]  thank you so much, lady markby, for
england . . . and myself.  [_goes out_.]

lady markby.  [_turning to_ lady chiltern.]  dear gertrude, we just
called to know if mrs. cheveley’s diamond brooch has been found.

lady chiltern.  here?

mrs. cheveley.  yes.  i missed it when i got back

thought i might possibly have dropped it here.

lady chiltern.  i have heard nothing about it.  but i will send for the
butler and ask.  [_touches the bell_.]

mrs. cheveley.  oh, pray don’t trouble, lady chiltern.  i dare say i lost
it at the opera, before we came on here.

lady markby.  ah yes, i suppose it must have been at the opera.  the fact
is, we all scramble and jostle so much nowadays that i wonder we have
anything at all left on us at the end of an evening.  i know myself that,
when i am coming back from the drawing room, i always feel as if i hadn’t
a shred on me, except a small shred of decent reputation, just enough to
prevent the lower classes making painful observations through the windows
of the carriage.  the fact is that our society is terribly
over-popula

ted.  really, some one should arrange a proper scheme of
assisted emigration.  it would do a great deal of good.

mrs. cheveley.  i quite agree with you, lady markby.  it is nearly six
years since i have been in london for the season, and i must say society
has become dreadfully mixed.  one sees the oddest people everywhere.

lady markby.  that is quite true, dear.  but one needn’t know them.  i’m
sure i don’t know half the people who come to my house.  indeed, from all
i hear, i shouldn’t like to.

[_enter_ mason.]

lady chiltern.  what sort of a brooch was it that you lost, mrs.
cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  a diamond snake-brooch with a ruby, a rather large ruby.

lady markby.  i thought you said there was a sapphire on the head, dear?

mrs. cheveley [_smiling_.]  no, lady markby—a ruby.

lady markby.  [_nodding her h

ead_.]  and very becoming, i am quite sure.

lady chiltern.  has a ruby and diamond brooch been found in any of the
rooms this morning, mason?

mason.  no, my lady.

mrs. cheveley.  it really is of no consequence, lady chiltern.  i am so
sorry to have put you to any inconvenience.

lady chiltern.  [_coldly_.]  oh, it has been no inconvenience.  that will
do, mason.  you can bring tea.

[_exit_ mason.]

lady markby.  well, i must say it is most annoying to lose anything.  i
remember once at bath, years ago, losing in the pump room an exceedingly
handsome cameo bracelet that sir john had given me.  i don’t think he has
ever given me anything since, i am sorry to say.  he has sadly
degenerated.  really, this horrid house of commons quite ruins our
husbands for us.  i think the lower house by far the greatest blow to a
happy married life that there has been since that terrible thing called
the higher educa

tion of women was invented.

lady chiltern.  ah! it is heresy to say that in this house, lady markby.
robert is a great champion of the higher education of women, and so, i am
afraid, am i.

mrs. cheveley.  the higher education of men is what i should like to see.
men need it so sadly.

lady markby.  they do, dear.  but i am afraid such a scheme would be
quite unpractical.  i don’t think man has much capacity for development.
he has got as far as he can, and that is not far, is it?  with regard to
women, well, dear gertrude, you belong to the younger generation, and i
am sure it is all right if you approve of it.  in my time, of course, we
were taught not to understand anything.  that was the old system, and
wonderfully interesting it was.  i assure you that the amount of things i

y poor dear sister were taught not to understand was quite
extraordinary.  but modern women understand everything, i am told.

mrs. cheveley.  except their husbands.  that is the one thing the modern
woman never understands.

lady markby.  and a very good thing too, dear, i dare say.  it might
break up many a happy home if they did.  not yours, i need hardly say,
gertrude.  you have married a pattern husband.  i wish i could say as
much for myself.  but since sir john has taken to attending the debates
regularly, which he never used to do in the good old days, his language
has become quite impossible.  he always seems to think that he is
addressing the house, and consequently whenever he discusses the state of
the agricultural

n assembly of gentlemen.  but in his
present state, sir john is really a great trial.  why, this morning
before breakfast was half over, he stood up on the hearthrug, put his
hands in his pockets, and appealed to the country at the top of his
voice.  i left the table as soon as i had my second cup of tea, i need
hardly say.  but his violent language could be heard all over the house!
i trust, gertrude, that sir robert is not like that?

lady chiltern.  but i am very much interested in politics, lady markby.
i love to hear robert talk about them.

lady markby.  well, i hope he is not as devoted to blue books as sir john
is.  i don’t think they can be quite improving reading for any one.

mrs. cheveley [_languidly_.]  i have never read a blue book.  i prefer
books . . . in yellow covers.

lady markby.  [_genially unconscious_.]  yellow is a gayer colour, is it
not?  i used to wear yellow a good deal in my early days, and would do so
now if sir john was not so painfully personal in his observation

s, and a
man on the question of dress is always ridiculous, is he not?

mrs. cheveley.  oh, no!  i think men are the only authorities on dress.

lady markby.  really?  one wouldn’t say so from the sort of hats they
wear? would one?

[_the butler enters_, _followed by the footman_.  _tea is set on a small
table close to_ lady chiltern.]

lady chiltern.  may i give you some tea, mrs. cheveley?

mrs. cheveley.  thanks.  [_the butler hands_ mrs. cheveley _a cup of tea
on a salver_.]

lady chiltern.  some tea, lady markby?

lady markby.  no thanks, dear.  [_the servants go out_.]  the fact is, i
have promised to go round for ten minutes to see poor la

d brancaster always hides himself behind the money
article in _the times_.  however, i believe that is quite a common
occurrence nowadays and that they have to take in extra copies of _the
times_ at all the clubs in st. james’s street; there are so many sons who
won’t have anything to do with their fathers, and so many fathers who
won’t speak to their sons.  i think myself, it is very much to be
regretted.

mrs. cheveley.  so do i.  fathers have so much to learn from their sons
nowadays.

lady markby.  really, dear?  what?

mrs. cheveley.  the art of living.  the only really fine art we have
produced in modern times.

lady markby.  [_shaking her head_.]  ah!  i am afraid lord brancaster
knew a good deal about that.  more than his poor wife ever did.
[_turning to_ lady chiltern.]  you know lady brancaster, don’t you, dear?

lady chiltern.  just slightly.  she was staying at langton last autumn,
when we were there.

lady markby.  well, like all stout women, she looks the very picture of

ok up.  i know she had lost all sense of pleasure in
life.  [_rising_.]  and now, gertrude, if you will allow me, i shall
leave mrs. cheveley in your charge and call back for her in a quarter of
an hour.  or perhaps, dear mrs. cheveley, you wouldn’t mind waiting in
the carriage while i am with lady brancaster.  as i intend it to be a
visit of condolence, i shan’t stay long.

mrs. cheveley [_rising_.]  i don’t mind waiting in the carriage at all,
provided there is somebody to look at one.

lady markby.  well, i hear the curate is always prowling about the house.

mrs. cheveley.  i am afraid i am not fond of girl friends.

lady chiltern [_rising_.]  oh, i hope mrs. cheveley will stay here a
little.  i should like to have a few minutes’ conversation with her.

mrs. cheveley.  how very kind of you, lady chiltern!  believe me, nothing
would give me greater pleasure.

lady markby.  ah! no doubt you both have many pleasant reminiscences of
your schooldays to talk over together.  good-bye, dear g

genius.  he does . . . nothing at all, i believe.  that is a great
comfort, is it not?

lady chiltern.  robert and i are dining at home by ourselves to-night,
and i don’t think i shall go anywhere afterwards.  robert, of course,
will have to be in the house.  but there is nothing interesting on.

lady markby.  dining at home by yourselves?  is that quite prudent?  ah,
i forgot, your husband is an exception.  mine is the general rule, and
nothing ages a woman so rapidly as having married the general rule.
[_exit_ lady markby.]

mrs. cheveley.  wonderful woman, lady markby, isn’t she?  talks more and
says less than anybody i ever met.  she is made to be a public speaker.
much more so than her husband, though he is a typical englishman, always
dull and usually violent.

to try and kill her love for him, to put poison in her heart, and
bitterness in her life, to break her idol, and, it may be, spoil her
soul.  that i cannot forgive you.  that was horrible.  for that there can
be no forgiveness.

mrs. cheveley.  arthur, you are unjust to me.  believe me, you are quite
unjust to me.  i didn’t go to taunt gertrude at all.  i had no idea of
doing anything of the kind when i entered.  i called with lady markby
simply to ask whether an ornament, a jewel, that i lost somewhere last
night, had been found at the chilterns’.  if you don’t believe me, you
can ask lady markby.  she will tell you it is true.  the scene that
occurred happened after lady markby had left, and was really forced on me
by gertrude’s rudeness and sneers.  i called, oh!—a little out of malice
if you like—but really to ask if a diamond brooch of mine had been found.
that was the origin of the whole thing.
