 at school said that when mother died she had gone to heaven. that was because mrs. forbes 
is  very  old  and  she  believes  in  heaven.  and  she  wears  tracksuit  trousers  because  she  says  that  they  are 
more  comfortable  than  normal  trousers.  and  one  of  her  legs  is  very  slightly  shorter  than  the  other  one 
because of an accident on a motorbike. 
 
but when mother died she didn't go to heaven because heaven doesn't exist. 
 
mrs. peters's husband is a vicar called the reverend peters, and he comes to our school sometimes to talk 
to us, and i asked him where heaven was and he said, "it's not in our universe. it's another kind of place 
altogether." 
 
the reverend peters makes a funny ticking noise with his tongue sometimes when he is thinking. and he 
smokes cigarettes and you can smell them on his breath and i don't like this. 
 
i  said  that  there  wasn't  anything  outside  the  universe  and  there  wasn't  another  kind  of  place  altogether. 
except  that  there

waves are how we get information about things which are far away. and if heaven was on the other side 
of a black hole, dead people would have to be fired into space on rockets to get there, and they aren't or 
people would notice. 
 
i think people believe in heaven because they don't like the idea of dying, because they want to carry on 
living and they don't like the idea that other people will move into their house and put their things into the 
rubbish. 
 
the reverend peters said, "well, when i say that heaven is outside the universe it's really just a manner of 
speaking. i suppose what it really means is that they are with god." 
 
and i replied, "but where is god?" 
 
and the reverend peters said that we should talk about this on another day when he had more time. 
 
what actually happens when you die is that your brain stops working and your body rots, like rabbit did 
when  he  died  and  we  buried  him  in  the  earth  at  the  bottom  of  the  garden.  and

ngs she was embarrassed to say in front of me, and she said 
no, so he said, "say them now, then." 
 
and she said that if i sat an a level i would have to have a member of staff looking after me on my own 
in a separate room. and father said he would pay someone Â£50 to do it after school and he wasn't going 
to  take  no  for  an  answer.  and  she  said  she'd  go  away  and  think  about  it.  and  the  next  week  she  rang 
father at home and told him that i could take the a level and the reverend peters would be what is called 
the invigilator. 
 
and after i've taken a-level maths i am going to take a-level further maths and physics and then i can go 
to university. there is not a university in our town, which is swindon, because it is a small place. so we 
will have to move to another town where there is a university because i don't want to live on my own or 
in a house with other students. but that will be all right because father wants to move to a different town 
as well. he sometimes say

and i said, "i have to go back to swindon." 
 
and mother said, "christopher, you've only just got here." 
 

 

and i said, "i have to go back because i have to sit my maths a level." 
 
and mother said, "you're doing maths a level?" 
 
and i said, "yes. i'm taking it on wednesday and thursday and friday next week." 
 
and mother said, "god." 
 
and i said, "the reverend peters is going to be the invigilator." 
 
and mother said, "i mean, that's really good." 
 
and i said, "i'm going to get an a grade. and that's why i have to go back to swindon. except i don't 
want to see father. so i have to go to swindon with you." 
 
then mother put her hands over her face and breathed out hard, and she said, "i don't know whether that's 
going to be possible." 
 
and i said, "but i have to go." 
 
and mother said, "let's talk about this some other time, ok?" 
 
and i said, "ok.

illegal and she was going to complain, but mr. shears said, "don't be a bloody fool. it was a temporary 
job, for christ's sake." 
 
and when mother came into the spare room before i went to sleep i said, "i have to go to swindon to take 
my a level." 
 
and she said, "christopher, not now. i'm getting phone calls from your father threatening to take me to 
court. i'm getting it in the neck from roger. it's not a good time." 
 
and i said, "but i have to go because it's been arranged and the reverend peters is going to invigilate." 
 
and she said, "look. it's only an exam. i can ring the school. we can get it postponed. you can take it 
some other time." 
 
and  i  said,  "i  can't  take  it  another  time.  it's  been  arranged.  and  i've  done  lots  of  revision.  and  mrs. 
gascoyne said we could use a room at school." 
 
and mother said, "christopher, i am just about holding this together. but i am this close to losing it, all 
right? so just give me some --"

and siobhan said, "you don't have to do it, christopher. if you say you don't want to do it no one is going 
to be angry with you. and it won't be wrong or illegal or stupid. it will just be what you want and that 
will be fine," 
 
and i said, "i want to do it," because i don't like it when i put things in my timetable and i have to take 
them out again, because when i do that it makes me feel sick. 
 
and siobhan said, "ok." 
 
and she rang the reverend peters and he came into school at 3:27 p.m. and he said, "so, young man, are 
we ready to roll?" 
 
and  i  did  paper  1  of  my  maths  a  level  sitting  in  the  art  room.  and  the  reverend  peters  was  the 
invigilator and he sat at a desk while i did the exam and he read a book called the cost of discipleship 
by  dietrich  bonhoeffer  and  ate  a  sandwich.  and  in  the  middle  of  the  exam  he  went  and  smoked  a 
cigarette outside the window, but he watched me through the window in c

and when i opened the paper and read through it i couldn't think how to answer any of the questions and 
also i couldn't breathe properly. and i wanted to hit somebody or stab them with my swiss army knife, 
but there wasn't anyone to hit or stab with my swiss army knife except the reverend peters and he was 
very tall and if i hit him or stabbed him with my swiss army knife he wouldn't be my invigilator for the 
rest  of  the  exam.  so  i  took  deep  breaths  like  siobhan  said  i  should  do  when  i  want  to  hit  someone  in 
school and i counted 50 breaths and did cubes of the cardinal numbers as i counted, like this 

1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, 343, 512, 729, 1000, 1331, 1728, 2197, 2744, 3375, 4096, 4913. . . etc.

then he got some keys out of his pocket and got into his car and drove away and mother ran out of the 
house and she ran into the street and shouted, "don't fucking bother coming back, either!" and she threw 
the box of muesli and it hit the boot of his car as he drove away and mrs. shears was looking out of her 
window when mother did this. 
 
the next day i did paper 3 and the reverend peters read the daily mail and smoked three cigarettes. 
 
and this was my favorite question 

prove the following result: 
 
a triangle with sides that can be written in the form n2 + 1, n2 - 1 and 2n (where n > 1) is right-angled. 
 
show, by means of a counterexample, that the converse is false. 

and i was going to write out how i answered the question except siobhan said it wasn't very interesting, 
but i said it was. and she said people wouldn't want to read the answers to a maths question in a
