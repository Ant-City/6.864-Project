jane smile. henrietta turn the dial as high as it can go. got on some real sorry whitefolks music sound like i don't know

so short it look fuzzy. his eyes real bright blue and never hardly blink. good god, i think.

e to say for miss eleanor jane, her dishes almost always fool henrietta. and that mean a
lots to me. of course i never tell henrietta where they come from. if i did, out the window they would go. else she'd
vomit, like it made her sick.

but finally, the end come to sofia and miss eleanor jane, i think. and it wasn't nothing to do with henrietta, who hate
miss eleanor jane's guts. it was miss eleanor jane herself and that baby she went and had. every time sofia turned round
miss eleanor jane was shoving reynolds stanley earl in her face. he a little fat white something without much hair, look
like he headed for the navy.

for him and look so much like him, too.

of his big stuck open eyes.

he sure fat, say sofia, turning over the dress she ironing.

and he sweet, too, say miss eleanor jane.

just as plump as he can be, say sofia. and tall.

but he sweet, too, say eleanor jane. and he smart. she haul off and kiss him up side the head. he rub his head, say yee.
ain't he the smartest baby you ever saw? she ast sofia.

 on him, say sofia. you know some peoples place a lot of weight on head size. not a whole lot of
hair on it either. he gon be cool this summer, for sure. she fold the piece she iron and put it on a chair.

just a sweet, smart, cute, innocent little baby boy, say miss eleanor jane. don't you just love him? she ast sofia point
blank.

sofia sigh. put down her iron. stare at miss eleanor jane and reynolds stanley. all the time me and henrietta over in the
corner playing pitty pat. henrietta act like miss eleanor jane ain't alive, but both of us hear the way the iron sound when
sofia put it down. the sound have a lot of old and new stuff in it.

no ma'am, say sofia. i do not love reynolds stanley earl. now. that's what you been trying to find out ever since he was
born. and now you know.

or where he crawling
round knocking stuff over. head straight for sofia's stack of ironed clothes and pull it down on his head. sofia take up the
clothes, straighten them out, stand by the ironing board with her hand on the iron. sofia the kind of woman no matter
what she have in her hand it look like a weapon.

eleanor jane start to cry. she always have felt something for sofia. if not for her, sofia never would have survive living in
her daddy's house. but so what? sofia never wanted to be there in the first place. never wanted to leave her own
children.

too late to cry. miss eleanor jane, say sofia. all us can do now is laugh. look at him, she say. and she do laugh. he can't
even walk and already he in my house messing it up. did i ast him to come? do i care whether he sweet or not? will it
make any difference

you just don't like him cause he look like daddy, say miss eleanor jane.

you don't like him cause he look like daddy, say sofia. i don't feel nothing about him at all. i don't love him, i don't hate
him. i just wish he couldn't run loose all the time messing up folks stuff.

times.

i feel like he been here forever, say sofia.

i just don't understand, say miss eleanor jane. all the other colored women i know love children. the way you feel is
something unnatural.

more than i do. but if you so badly raise as to ast 'em, what you expect them to say? some colored peopl

what you want from me? say sofia. i feel something for you because out of all the people in your daddy's house you
showed me some human kindness. but on the other hand, out of all the people in your daddy's house, i showed you
some. kind feeling is all i have to offer you. i don't have nothing to offer your relatives but just what they offer me. i don't
have nothing to offer him.

and henrietta reach up on the windowsill and hand him a cracker.

you and whose army? say sofia. the first word he likely to speak won't be nothing he learn from you.

you telling me i won't even be able to love my own son, say miss eleanor jane.

no, say sofia. that's not what i'm telling you. i'm telling you i won't be able to love your own son. you can love him just as
much as you want to. but be ready to suffer the consequences. that's how the colored live.

little reynolds stanley all up on top henrietta's face by now, just slobbering and sucking. trying to kiss. any second i think
she gon knock him silly. but she lay real still while he zamine her. every once in a while he act like he peeking into her

places to go.

thank you for all you done for us, say sofia. she don't look so good herself, and a little water stand in her eyes. after miss
eleanor jane and reynolds stanley leave, she say. it's times like this make me know us didn't make this world. and all the
colored folks talking bout loving everybody just ain't looked hard at what they thought they said.

so what else new?
