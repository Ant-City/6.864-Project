 therefore, courage, good aliena.

  celia. i pray you bear with me; i cannot go no further.

  touchstone. for my part, i had rather bear with you than bear you;
    yet i should bear no cross if i did bear you; for i think you
    have no money in your purse.

  rosalind. well,. this is the forest of arden.

  touchstone. ay, now am i in arden; the more fool i; when i was at
    home i was in a better place; but travellers must be content.

    young man and an old in solemn talk.

  corin. that is the way to make her scorn you still.

  silvius. o corin, that thou knew'st how i do love her!

  corin. i partly guess; for i have lov'd ere now.

  silvius. no, corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
    though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
    as ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow.
    but if thy love were ever like to mine,

    if thou rememb'rest not the slightest folly
    that ever love did make thee run into,
    thou hast not lov'd;
    or if thou hast not sat as i do now,
    wearing thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,

    between the pale complexion of true love

d yet his pride becomes him.
    he'll make a proper man. the best thing in him
    is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
    did make offence, his eye did heal it up.
    he is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall;
    his leg is but so-so; and yet 'tis well.
    there was a pretty redness in his lip,
    a little riper and more lusty red
    than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
    betwixt the constant red and mingled damask.
    there be some women, silvius, had they mark'd him
    in parcels as i did, would have gone near
    to fall in love with him; but, for my part,
    i love him not, nor hate him not; and yet
    i have more cause to hate him than to love him;
    for what had he to do to chide at me?
    he said mine eyes were black, and my hair black,
    and, now i am rememb'red, scorn'd at me.
