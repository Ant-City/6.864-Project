"on the fiftieth anniversary," the president continues, 
"as a reminder that two rebels died for each capitol 
citizen, every district was required to send twice as 
many tributes." 

i imagine facing a field of forty- seven instead of 
twenty-three. worse odds, less hope, and ultimately 
more dead kids. that was the year haymitch won... 

"i had a friend who went that year," says my mother 
quietly. "maysilee donner. her parents owned the 
sweetshop. they gave me her songbird after. a 
canary." 

prim and i exchange a look. it's the first we've ever 
heard of maysilee donner. maybe because my mother 
knew we would want to know how she died.

"and now we honor our third quarter quell," says the 
president. the little boy in white steps forward, 
holding out the box as he opens the lid. we can see 
the tidy, upright rows of yellowed envelopes. whoever

 in honor of the quarter 
quell, there will be twice the number of tributes. the 
editors smash cut right into the reapings, where 
name after name after name is called. 

by the time we get to district 12, i'm completely 
overwhelmed by the sheer number of kids going to 
certain death. there's a woman, not effie, calling the 
names in 12, but she still begins with "ladies first!" 
she calls out the name of a girl who's from the seam, 
you can tell by the look of her, and then i hear the 
name "maysilee donner." 

"oh!" i say. "she was my mother's friend." the camera 
finds her in the crowd, clinging to two other girls. all 
blond. all definitely merchants' kids. 

"i think that's your mother hugging her," says peeta 
quietly. and he's right. as maysilee donner bravely 
disengages herself and heads for the stage, i catch a

exaggerated her beauty. holding her hand and 
weeping is another girl who

i think of madge's mother. mayor undersee's wife. 
who spends half her life in bed immobilized with 
terrible pain, shutting out the world. i think of how i 
never realized that she and my mother shared this 
connection. of madge showing up in that snowstorm

and how it means something completely different now 
that i know that its former owner was madge's aunt, 
maysilee donner, a tribute who was murdered in the 
arena. 

haymitch's name is called last of all. it's more of a 
shock to see him than my mother. young. strong. 
hard to admit, but he was something of a looker. his 
hair dark and curly, those gray seam eyes bright and, 
even then, dangerous. 

"oh. peeta, you don't think he killed maysilee, do 
you?" i burst out. i don't know why, but i can't stand 
the thought. 

"with forty-eight players? i'd say the odds are against 
it," says peeta.

too directly â€” is deadly poisonous. only 
the rainwater and the food provided at the 
cornucopia are safe to consume. there's also a large, 
well-stocked career pack of ten tributes scouring the 
mountain area for victims. 

haymitch has his own troubles over in the woods, 
where the fluffy golden squirrels turn out to be 
carnivorous and attack in packs, and the butterfly 
stings bring agony if not death. but he persists in 
moving forward, always keeping the distant mountain 
at his back. 

maysilee donner turns out to be pretty resourceful 
herself, for a girl who leaves the cornucopia with only 
a small backpack. inside she finds a bowl, some dried 
beef, and a blowgun with two dozen darts. making 
use of the readily available poisons, she soon turns 
the blowgun into a deadly weapon by dipping the 
darts in lethal substances and directing them into her 
opponents' flesh. 

four days in, the picturesque mountain erupts in a 
volcano that wipes out another dozen players, 
including all but five

woods. 



haymitch seems bent on continuing in the same 
direction, away from the now volcanic mountain, but 
a maze of tightly woven hedges forces him to circle 
back into the center of the woods, where he 
encounters three of the careers and pulls his knife. 
they may be much bigger and stronger, but haymitch 
has remarkable speed and has killed two when the 
third disarms him. that career is about to slit his 
throat when a dart drops him to the ground. 

maysilee donner steps out of the woods. "we'd live 
longer with two of us." 

"guess you just proved that," says haymitch, rubbing 
his neck. "allies?" maysilee nods. and there they are, 
instantly drawn into one of those pacts you'd be hard- 
pressed to break if you ever expect to go home and 
face your district. 

just like peeta and me, they do better together. get 
more rest, work out a system to salvage more 
rainwater, fight as a team, and share the food from 
the dead tributes' packs. but haymitch is st

"what's that?" finnick asks me. 

"it's a bird that we take down into the mines to warn 
us if there's bad air," i say.

"what's it do, die?" asks johanna. 

"it stops singing first. that's when you should get out. 
but if the air's too bad, it dies, yes. and so do you." i 
don't want to talk about dying songbirds. they bring 
up thoughts of my father's death and rue's death and 
maysilee donner's death and my mother inheriting 
her songbird. oh, great, and now i'm thinking of gale, 
deep down in that horrible mine, with president 
snow's threat hanging over his head. so easy to make 
it look like an accident down there. a silent canary, a 
spark, and nothing more. 

i go back to imagining killing the president. 

despite her annoyance at wiress, johanna's as happy 
as i've seen her in the arena. while i'm adding to my 
stock of arrows, she pokes around until she comes up
