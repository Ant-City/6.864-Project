ad got the face of a little old man, and grinned at her.

â€˜they donâ€™t keep this room so tidy as the other,â€™ alice thought to
herself, as she noticed several of the chessmen down in the hearth among
the cinders: but in another moment, with a little â€˜oh!â€™ of surprise, she
was down on her hands and knees watching them. the chessmen were walking
about, two and two!

â€˜here are the red king and the red queen,â€™ alice said (in a whisper, for
fear of frightening them), â€˜and there are the white king and the white
queen sitting on the edge of the shovel--and here are two castles
walking arm in arm--i donâ€™t think they can hear me,â€™ she went on, as she
put her head closer down, â€˜and iâ€™m nearly sure they canâ€™t see me. i feel
somehow as if i were invisible--â€™

here something began squeaking on the table behind alice, and made her
turn her head just in time to see one of the white pawns roll over and
begin kicking: she watched it with great curiosity to see what would
happen next.

as covered with ashes from head to foot.

alice was very anxious to be of use, and, as the poor little lily was
nearly screaming herself into a fit, she hastily picked up the queen and
set her on the table by the side of her noisy little daughter.

the queen gasped, and sat down: the rapid journey through the air had
quite taken away her breath and for a minute or two she could do nothing
but hug the little lily in silence. as soon as she had recovered her
breath a little, she called out to the white king, who was sitting
sulkily among the ashes, â€˜mind the volcano!â€™

â€˜what volcano?â€™ said the king, looking up anxiously into the fire, as if
he thought that was the most likely place to find one.

â€˜blew--me--up,â€™ panted the queen, who was still a little out of breath.
â€˜mind you come up--the regular way--donâ€™t get blown up!â€™

alice watched the white king as he slowly struggled up from bar to bar,
till at last she said, â€˜why, youâ€™ll be hours and hours getting to the
table, at tha

ng; but alice was too strong for him,
and at last he panted out, â€˜my dear! i really must get a thinner pencil.
i canâ€™t manage this one a bit; it writes all manner of things that i
donâ€™t intend--â€™

â€˜what manner of things?â€™ said the queen, looking over the book (in which
alice had put â€˜the white knight is sliding down the poker. he balances
very badlyâ€™) â€˜thatâ€™s not a memorandum of your feelings!â€™

there was a book lying near alice on the table, and while she sat
watching the white king (for she was still a little anxious about him,
and had the ink all ready to throw over him, in case he fainted again),
she turned over the leaves, to find some part that she could read,
â€˜--for itâ€™s all in some language i donâ€™t know,â€™ she said to herself.

it was like this.

evidently humpty dumpty was very angry, though he said nothing for a
minute or two. when he did speak again, it was in a deep growl.

â€˜it is a--most--provoking--thing,â€™ he said at last, â€˜when a person
doesnâ€™t know a cravat from a belt!â€™

â€˜i know itâ€™s very ignorant of me,â€™ alice said, in so humble a tone that
humpty dumpty relented.

â€˜itâ€™s a cravat, child, and a beautiful one, as you say. itâ€™s a present
from the white king and queen. there now!â€™

â€˜is it really?â€™ said alice, quite pleased to find that she had chosen a
good subject, after all.

â€˜they gave it me,â€™ humpty dumpty continued thoughtfully, as he crossed
one knee over the other and clasped his hands round it, â€˜they gave it
me--for an un-birthday present.â€™

â€˜i beg your pardon?â€™ alice said with a puzzled air.

â€˜iâ€™m not offended,â€™ said humpty dumpty.

â€˜i mean, what is an un-birthday present?â€™

â€˜a present given when it isnâ€™t yo
