eard.
it was a random, bristly beard, and some of the bristles were white, even though billy
was only twenty-one years old. he was also going bald. wind and cold and violent
exercise had turned his face crimson.
 he didn't look like a soldier at all. he looked like a filthy flamingo.
 and on the third day of wandering, somebody shot at the four from far away-shot four
times as they crossed a narrow brick road. one shot was for the scouts. the next one was
for the antitank gunner, whose name was roland weary.
 the third bullet was for the filthy flamingo, who stopped dead center in the road when
the lethal bee buzzed past his ear. billy stood there politely, giving the marksman another
chance. it was his addled understanding of the rules of warfare that the marksman should
be given a second chance. the next shot missed billy's kneecaps by inches, going endon-end,
from the sound of it.
 roland weary and the scouts were safe in a ditch, and weary growled at billy, 'get
out of the road, you dumb mothe

from a 57-millimeter antitank gun. the gun made
a ripping sound like the opening of a zipper on the fly of god almighty. the gun lapped
up snow and vegetation with a blowtorch feet long. the flame left a black arrow on the
ground, showing the germans exactly where the gun was hidden. the shot was a miss.
 what had been missed was a tiger tank. it swiveled its 88-millimeter snout around
sniffingly, saw the arrow on the ground. it fired. it killed everybody on the gun crew but
weary. so it goes.
 roland weary was only eighteen, was at the end of an unhappy childhood spent
mostly in pittsburgh, pennsylvania. he had been unpopular in pittsburgh. he had been
unpopular because he was stupid and fat and mean, and smelled like bacon no matter how
much he washed. he was always being ditched in pittsburgh by people who did not want
him with them.
 it made weary sick to be ditched. when weary was ditched, he would find somebody
who was even more unpopular than himself, and he would horse around with that per

t of the ditch without drawing any more fire. they crawled
into a forest like the big, unlucky mammals they were. then they stood up and began to
walk quickly. the forest was dark and cold. the pines were planted in ranks and files.
there was no undergrowth. four inches of unmarked snow blanketed the ground. the
americans had no choice but to leave trails in the show as unambiguous as diagrams in a
book on ballroom dancing--step, slide, rest-step, slide,-rest.
 'close it up and keep it closed!' roland weary warned billy pilgrim as they moved out.
weary looked like tweedledum or tweedledee, all bundled up for battle. he was short
and thick.
 he had every piece of equipment he had ever been issued, every present he'd received
from home: helmet, helmet liner, wool cap, scarf, gloves, cotton undershirt, woolen
undershirt, wool shirt, sweater, blouse, jacket, overcoat, cotton underpants, woolen
underpants, woolen trousers, cotton socks, woolen socks, combat boots, gas mask,
canteen, mess kit, first-aid

 where weary bought his picture, too-in the tuileries. le fèvre argued
that the picture was fine art, and that his intention was to make greek mythology come
alive. he said that columns and the potted palm proved that.
 when asked which myth he meant to represent, le fèvre, replied that there were
thousands of myths like that, with the woman a mortal and the pony a god.
 he was sentenced to six months in prison. he died there of pneumonia. so it goes.
 billy and the scouts were skinny people. roland weary had fat to burn. he was a
roaring furnace under all his layers of wool and straps and canvas. he had so much
energy that he bustled back and forth between billy and the scouts, delivering dumb
messages which nobody had sent and which nobody was pleased to receive. he also
began to suspect, since he was so much busier than anybody else, that he was the leader.
 he was so hot and bundled up, in fact, that he had no sense of danger. his vision of the
outside world was limited to what he could see

ches, and searched again. amazingly, he was eventually
hard against the right-hand door, without having found the wheel. he concluded that
somebody had stolen it. this angered him as he passed out.
 he was in the back seat of his car, which was why he couldn't find the steering wheel.
 now somebody was shaking billy awake. billy stiff felt drunk, was still angered by the
stolen steering wheel. he was back in the second world war again, behind the german
lines. the person who was shaking him was roland weary. weary had gathered the front
of billy's field jacket into his hands. he banged billy against a tree, then puffed him
away from it, flung him in the direction he was supposed to take under his own power.
 billy stopped, shook his head. 'you go on,' he said.
 'what? '
 'you guys go on without me. i'm all right.'
 'you're what?'
 'i'm o.k.'
 'jesus-i'd hate to see somebody sick,' said weary, through five layers of humid scarf
from home. lilly had never seen weary's face. he had tried to imagine i

 billy pilgrim, there in the creekbed, thought he, billy pilgrim, was turning to steam
painlessly. if everybody would leave him alone for just a little while, he thought, he
wouldn't cause anybody any more trouble. he would turn to steam and float up among
the treetops.
 somewhere the big dog barked again. with the help of fear and echoes and winter
silences, that dog had a voice like a big bronze gong.
 roland weary, eighteen years old, insinuated himself between the scouts, draped a
heavy arm around the shoulder of each. 'so what do the three musketeers do now?' he
said.
 billy pilgrim was having a delightful hallucination. he was wearing dry, warm, white
sweatsocks, and he was skating on a ballroom floor. thousands cheered. this wasn't
time-travel. it had never happened, never would happen. it was the craziness of a dying
young man with his shoes full of snow.
 one scout hung his head, let spit fall from

a voice box was a little whistle cut from a willow switch. worse-he
had nothing to say. the crowd quieted down. everybody was pink and beaming.
 billy opened his mouth, and out came a deep, resonant tone. his voice was a gorgeous
instrument. it told jokes which brought down the house. it grew serious, told jokes again,
and ended on a note of humility. the explanation of the miracle was this: billy had taken
a course in public speaking.
 and then he was back in the bed of the frozen creek again. roland weary was about to
beat the living shit out of him.
 weary was filled with a tragic wrath. he had been ditched again. he stuffed his pistol
into its holster. he slipped his knife into its scabbard. its triangular blade and blood
gutters on all three faces. and then he shook billy hard, rattled his skeleton, slammed
him against a bank.
 weary barked and whimpered through his layers of scarf from home. he spoke
unintelligibly of the sacrifices he had made on billy's behalf. he dilated upon the piety

 off billy., and then they searched him for weapons.
he didn't have any. the most dangerous thing they found on his person was a two-inch
pencil stub.
 three inoffensive bangs came from far away. they came from german rifles. the two
scouts who had ditched billy and weary had just been shot. they had been lying in
ambush for germans. they had been discovered and shot from behind. now they were
dying in the snow, feeling nothing, turning the snow to the color of raspberry sherbet. so
it goes. so roland weary was the last of the three musketeers.
 and weary, bug-eyed with terror, was being disarmed. the corporal gave weary's
pistol to the pretty boy. he marveled at weary's cruel trench knife, said in german that
weary would no doubt like to use the knife on him, to tear his face off with the spiked
knuckles, to stick the blade into his belly or throat. he spoke no english, and billy and
weary understood no german.
 "nice playthings you have", the corporal told weary, and he handed the knife to an ol

gh noon. it was housed in a cupola atop a
firehouse across the street from billy's office.
 billy closed his eyes. when he opened them, he was back in the second world war
again. his head was on the wounded rabbi's shoulder. a german was kicking his feet,
telling him to wake up, that it was time to move on.
 the americans, with billy among them, formed a fools' parade on the road outside.
 there was a photographer present, a german war correspondent with a leica. he took
pictures of billy's and roland weary's feet. the picture was widely published two days
later as heartening evidence of how miserably equipped the american army often was,
despite its reputation for being rich.
 the photographer wanted something more lively, though, a picture of an actual
capture. so the guards staged one for him. they threw billy into shrubbery. when billy
came out of the shrubbery, his face wreathed in goofy good will, they menaced him with
their machine pistols, as though they were capturing him then.

 to themselves. the west-bound lane
boiled and boomed with vehicles which were rushing german reserves to the front. the
reserves were violent, windburned, bristly men. they had teeth like piano keys.
 they were festooned with machine-gun belts, smoked cigars, and guzzled booze. they
took wolfish bites from sausages, patted their horny palms with potato-masher grenades.
 one soldier in black was having a drunk herd's picnic all by himself on top of a tank.
he spit on the americans. the spit hit roland weary's shoulder, gave weary a
fourragière of snot and blutwurst and tobacco juice, and schnapps.
 billy found the afternoon stingingly exciting. there was so much to see-dragon's teeth,
killing machine, corpses with bare feet that were blue and ivory. so it goes.
 bobbing up-and-down, up-and-down, billy beamed lovingly at a bright lavender
farmhouse that had been spattered with machine-gun bullets. standing in its cock-eyed
doorway was a german colonel. with him was his unpainted whore.

r the outfit he was from.
 'you from the four-fifty-first?'
 'four-fifty-first what?' said billy.
 there was a silence. 'infantry regiment,' said the colonel at last.
 'oh,' said billy pilgrim.
 there was another long silence, with the colonel dying and dying, drowning where he
stood. and then he cried out wetly, 'it's me, boys! it's wild bob!' that is what he had
always wanted his troops to call him: 'wild bob.'
 none of the people who could hear him were actually from his regiment, except for
roland weary, and weary wasn't listening. all weary could think of was the agony in
his own feet.
 but the colonel imagined that he was addressing his beloved troops for the last time,
and he told them that they had nothing to be ashamed of, that there were dead germans
all over the battlefield who wished to god that they had never heard of the four-fiftyfirst.
he said that after the war he was going to have a regimental reunion in his home
town, which was cody, wyoming. he was going to barbecue whole steer

standing up, or not sleep at all. and food had stopped
coming in through the ventilators, and the days and nights were colder all the time.
 on the eighth day, the forty-year-old hobo said to billy, 'this ain't bad. i can be
comfortable anywhere.'
 'you can?' said billy.
 on the ninth day, the hobo died. so it goes. his last words were, 'you think this is bad?
this ain't bad.'
 there was something about death and the ninth day. there was a death on the ninth
day in the car ahead of billy's too. roland weary died--of gangrene that had started in his
mangled feet. so it goes.
 weary, in his nearly continuous delirium, told again and again of the three
musketeers, acknowledged that he was dying, gave many messages to be delivered to his
family in pittsburgh. above all, he wanted to be avenged, so he said again and again the
name of the person who had killed him. everyone on the car learned the lesson well.
 'who killed me?' he would ask.
 and everybody knew the answer, which was this: 'billy pilgrim.

the first thing they told him to
do on tralfamadore, too.
 a german measured billy's upper right arm with his thumb and forefinger, asked a
companion what sort of an army would send a weakling like that to the front. they
looked at the other american bodies now, pointed out a lot more that were nearly as bad
as billy's.
 one of the best bodies belonged to the oldest american by far, a high school teacher
from indianapolis. his name was edgar derby. he hadn't been in billy's boxcar. he'd
been in roland weary's car, had cradled weary's head while he died. so it goes. derby
was forty-four years old. he was so old he had a son who was a marine in the pacific
theater of war.
 derby had pulled political wires to get into the army at his age. the subject he had
taught in indianapolis was contemporary problems in western civilization. he also
coached the tennis team, and took very good care of his body.
 derby's son would survive the war. derby wouldn't. that good body of his would be
filled with holes by

 a firing squad in dresden in sixty-eight days. so it goes.
 the worst american body wasn't billy's. the worst body belonged to a car thief from
cicero, illinois. ms name was paul lazzaro. he was tiny, and not only were his bones
and teeth rotten, but his skin was disgusting. lazzaro was polka-dotted all over with
dime-sized scars. he had had many plagues of boils.
 lazzaro, too, had been on roland weary's boxcar, and had given his word of honor to
weary that he would find some way to make billy pilgrim pay for weary's death. he was
looking around now, wondering which naked human being was billy.
 the naked americans took their places under many showerheads along a white-tiled
wall. there were no faucets they could control. they could only wait for whatever was
coming. their penises were shriveled and their balls were retracted. reproduction was
not the main business of the evening.

illy died, which he didn't, half the tag
would mark his body and half would mark his grave.
 after poor edgar derby, the high school teacher, was shot in dresden later on, a doctor
pronounced him dead and snapped his dogtag in two. so it goes.
 properly enrolled and tagged, the americans were led through gate after gate again. in
two days' time now their families would learn from the international red cross that they
were alive.
 next to billy was little paul lazzaro, who had promised to avenge roland weary.
lazzaro wasn't thinking about vengeance. he was thinking about his terrible bellyache.
his stomach had shrunk to the size of a walnut. that dry, shriveled pouch was as sore as
a boil.
 next to lazzaro was poor, doomed old edgar derby, with his american and german
dogs displayed like a necklace, on the outside of his clothes. he had expected to become
a captain, a company commander, because of his wisdom and age. now here he was on
the czechoslovakian border at midnight.
 'halt,' said a guard.

aveling expenses. he had a list in his head, he said.
 derby asked him who all was on the list, and lazzaro said, 'just make fucking sure you
don't get on it. just don't cross me, that's all.' there was a silence, and then he added,
'and don't cross my friends.'
 'you have friends?' derby wanted to know.
 'in the war?' said lazzaro. 'yeah-i had a friend in the war. he's dead.' so it goes.
 'that's too bad.'
 lazzaro's eyes were twinkling again. 'yeah. he was my buddy on the boxcar. his
name was roland weary. he died in my arms.' now he pointed to billy with his one
mobile hand. 'he died on account of this silly cocksucker here. so i promised him
i'd have this silly cocksucker shot after the war.'
 lazzaro erased with his hand anything billy pilgrim might be about to say. 'just forget
about it, kid,' he said. 'enjoy life while you can. nothing's gonna happen for maybe five,
ten, fifteen, twenty years. but lemme give you a piece of advice: whenever the doorbell
rings, have somebody else answer the d

c, about three days after billy got to dresden. billy just happened to be walking to
work with some others shortly after sunrise, and they came to a gallows and a small
crowd in front of a soccer stadium. the pole was a farm laborer who was being hanged
for having had sexual intercourse with a german woman. so it goes.
 billy, knowing the plane was going to crash pretty soon, closed his eyes, traveled in
time back to 1944. he was back in the forest in luxembourg again-with the three
musketeers. roland weary was shaking him, bonking his head against a tree. 'you guys
go on without me,' said billy pilgrim.
 the barbershop quartet on the airplane was singing 'wait till the sun shines, nelly,'
when the plane smacked into the top of sugarbush mountain in vermont. everybody was
killed but billy and the copilot. so it goes.
 the people who first got to the crash scene were young austrian ski instructors from
the famous ski resort below. they spoke to each other in german as they went from body
to body. t
