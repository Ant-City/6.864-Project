s  really  a 
large house, white with black shutters and a wraparound 
porch  with  big  rocking  chairs,  which  must  been  for 
people to collapse into with relief after they'd won their 
cases. a sign on the lawn said 

clayton 

attorney at law. 

forrest, 

his secretary was a white lady who looked about 
eighty years old. she sat at a desk in the reception area, 
putting  on  fire-red  lipstick.  her  hair  was  permed  into 
tight curls that had a faint blue cast.

"hi,  miss  lacy,"  zach  said.  "i  brought  more 

honey." 

she  worked  the  lipstick  back  into  the  tube, 
looking mildly annoyed. "more honey," she said, shaking 
her head. she let out an overdone sigh and reached into 
a drawer. "the money for the last batch is in here." she 
dropped an envelope onto the desk. 

she looked me over. "you're new." 
"i'm lily," i said. 
"she's staying with august," zach explained. 
"you're staying in her house?" she said. 
i wanted to tell her that her lipstick was bleed

now, doesn't that seem strange to you? 
as  she  left,  mr.  forrest  came  out  of  his  office. 
the first thing i noticed was his red suspenders. i'd never 
seen  a  thin  person wear suspenders,  and  it  was  a  nice 
look, the way it matched his red bow tie. he had sandy

hair,  and  bushy  eyebrows  that  curled  toward  his  blue 
eyes, and smile crinkles in his face that signaled a good 
person.  so  good  that  apparently  he  couldn't  bring 
himself to get rid of miss lacy. 

he  looked  at  me.  "and  who  would  this  pretty 
young lady be?" "lily uh—" i could not remember what 
last  name  i  was  currently  using.  i  think  it  was  because  
he'd referred to me as pretty, which had been a shock to 
my system. "just lily." 

i stood there 
looking gawky, with one foot tucked behind the 
other. "i'm staying with august till i go live with my aunt 
in virginia." him being a lawyer, i worried he might ask 
me to take a lie-detector test. 

"how nice. august i

was  it unthinkable  he  could  speak  one of  them 
to  me,  even  the  one  reserved  for  lesser  things  like 
peanuts in your coke? was it so out of the question that 
t. ray knew i loved the color blue? what if he was home 
missing me, saying, why oh why didn't i love her better? 
miss lacy's telephone sat right there on her desk. 
i picked up the receiver and dialed 0 for operator. "i am 
making  a  collect  call,"  i  told  her,  and  gave  her  the  
number. almost faster than i would've believed, i heard 
the  phone  in  my  house  ringing.  i  stared  down  the 
hallway at the closed door and counted the rings. 

three, four, five, six. 
"hello."  his  voice  caused  my  stomach  to  pitch  
into my throat. i was unprepared for the way it buckled 
my knees. i had to sit down

"i  have  a  collect  call  from  lily  owens,"  the  

operator said. 

"will you accept the charge?" 
"you're  goddamn  right  i'll  accept  it,"  he  said. 
then,  without  waiting  for  me  to  say  p-turkey,  he  
launched right in. "lily, where the hell are you?" 

i  had  to  hold  the  phone  from  my  eardrum  for 
fear of him rupturing it. "t. ray, i'm sorry i had to leave, 
but—" 

"you  tell  me  where  you  are  right  now,  do  you

after  nonstop  mourning  all  week,  just  when  i 
thought we would go on forever in our private, grieving 
worlds  and  never  again  eat  another  meal  together  or 
work side by side in the honey house, i found rosaleen 
in the kitchen laying the table for four, using the sunday-
china plates with pink flowers and lacy scallops around 
the  edge.  i  broke  out  with  happiness  because  life 
seemed headed back to normal. 

rosaleen put a beeswax candle on the table, and 
i believe that was the first candle-lit meal of my entire 
life.  here  was  the  menu:  smothered  chicken,  rice  and 
gravy,  butter  beans,  sliced  tomatoes,  biscuits,  and 
candlelight. 

we had barely started in when rosaleen said to 

june, "so are you gonna marry neil or not?" 

august and i both stopped chewing and sat up.

big mistake, lily, calling me collect." 

"you  went  to  mr.  clayton's  and  he  told  you  

where i was?" 

"no,  but  he  has  an  old-lady  secretary  who  was 
more than happy to fill me in. she said i would find you 
right here." 

stupid miss lacy. 
"where's rosaleen?" he said. 
"she took off a long time ago," i lied. 
he  might  kidnap  me  back  to  sylvan,  but  there 
was  no  need  for  him  to  know  where  rosaleen  was.  i 
could spare her that much at least. 

he  didn't  comment  on  rosaleen,  though.  he 
seemed happy to carve up the arm of the rocking chair 
like he was all of eleven years old, putting his initials in a 
tree. i think he was glad he didn't have to fool with her. i 
wondered how i would survive back in sylvan
