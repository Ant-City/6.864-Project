Edmund
Of all of the play's villains, Edmund is the most complex
and sympathetic. He is a consummate schemer, a Machiavellian character eager
to seize any opportunity and willing to do anything to achieve his
goals. However, his ambition is interesting insofar as it reflects not
only a thirst for land and power but also a desire for the recognition
denied to him by his status as a bastard. His serial treachery is not
merely self-interested; it is a conscious rebellion against the social
order that has denied him the same status as Gloucester's legitimate
son, Edgar. "Now, gods, stand up for bastards," Edmund commands,
but in fact he depends not on divine aid but on his own initiative
(1.2.22). He is the ultimate self-made man,
and he is such a cold and capable villain that it is entertaining
to watch him work, much as the audience can appreciate the clever
wickedness of Iago in Othello. Only at the close
of the play does Edmund show a flicker of weakness. Mortally
wounded, he sees that both Goneril and Regan have died for him,
and whispers, "Yet Edmund was beloved" (5.3.238).
After this ambiguous statement, he seems to repent of his villainy
and admits to having ordered Cordelia's death. His peculiar change
of heart, rare among Shakespearean villains, is enough to make the
audience wonder, amid the carnage, whether Edmund's villainy sprang
not from some innate cruelty but simply from a thwarted, misdirected
desire for the familial love that he witnessed around him.
