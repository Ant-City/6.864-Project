[CHARACTER] - 
                the
daughter of prospero, [CHARACTER] was brought to the island at an early
age and has never seen any men other than her father and caliban,
though she dimly remembers being cared for by female servants as
an infant. because she has been sealed off from the world for so
long, [CHARACTER]'s perceptions of other people tend to be naive and
non-judgmental. she is compassionate, generous, and loyal to her
father.
