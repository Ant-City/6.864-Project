[CHARACTER] 
though his history and character are more fully explored
in the lord of the rings and the silmarillion, [CHARACTER]
remains a looming mystery in the hobbit, a constant
reminder that middle-earth is more vast and cryptic than bilbo realizes.
a powerful wizard, [CHARACTER] generally prefers to keep his powers
and motives closely guarded. he never reveals, for instance, why
he chooses to help thorin in his quest; he certainly has no interest
in the treasure, and he leaves the company in mirkwood while he
goes to fight against the necromancer. something both inspiring
and dangerous defines [CHARACTER]'s character--he is an unshakable bulwark
against evil, and yet he seems to have an enlightened, almost godlike
knowledge of every person's place in the world. 
[CHARACTER]'s sweeping, epic personality separates him from
the vast majority of characters that commercial fantasy literature
has produced in the decades since the hobbit was
first published. though [CHARACTER] can be viewed as the source of the
stereotypical figure of fantasy wizard, [CHARACTER] himself is more
than just an old man with powerful spells and a pointy hat. tolkien
imbues [CHARACTER] with a sense of heightened awareness, ensuring that
[CHARACTER] always knows more about what is happening than we do, even
when the other characters are left in the dark.
