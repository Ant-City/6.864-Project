Form - 
                According
to Plato's metaphysical theory, there is an aspect of reality beyond
the one which we can see, an aspect of reality even more real than
the one we see. This aspect of reality, the intelligible realm,
is comprised of unchanging, eternal, absolute entities, which are
called "Forms." These absolute entities--such as Goodness, Beauty,
Redness, Sourness, and so on--are the cause of all the objects we
experience around us in the visible realm. An apple is red and sweet,
for instance, because it participates in the Form of Redness and
the Form of Sweetness. A woman is beautiful because she participates
in the Form of Beauty. Only the Forms can be objects of knowledge (that
is, Forms are the only things we can know about).
