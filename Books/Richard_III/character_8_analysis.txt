Margaret 

Though she plays a very minor role in the play's plot,
mostly prowling around the castle cursing to herself, Margaret is
nevertheless one of the most important and memorable characters
in Richard III. The impotent, overpowering rage
that she directs at Richard and his family stands for the helpless,
righteous anger of all Richard's victims. The curses she levels
at the royals in Act I, which are among the most startling and memorable
in all of Shakespeare, foreshadow and essentially determine future
events of the play. Her lesson to Elizabeth and the duchess about
how to curse paints a striking picture of the psychology of victimization
and the use of language as a means of alleviating anguish.
As the wife of the dead and vanquished King Henry VI,
Margaret also represents the plight of women under the patriarchal
power structure of Renaissance England. Without a husband to grant
her status and security, she is reduced to depending on the charity
of her family's murderers to survive--a dire situation that she later
wishes on Elizabeth. Margaret is a one-dimensional character, representing rage
and pain, but she is vital to the play for the sheer focus of torment
she brings to the world surrounding Richard's irresistible evil.
