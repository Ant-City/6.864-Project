Big bang - 
                    The
widely accepted theory concerning the origin of the universe. The
big bang theory posits that the universe evolved approximately 10
to 15 billion years ago from the explosion of an incredibly dense,
hot substance that was contained at one point. The universe has
been expanding since the first fraction of a second after the big
bang occurred.
