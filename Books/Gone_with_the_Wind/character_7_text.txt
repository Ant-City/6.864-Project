he thought only of the most
direct steps by which to reach it.

first, she would be "prideful," as gerald had commanded.  from the
moment she arrived at twelve oaks, she would be her gayest, most
spirited self.  no one would suspect that she had ever been
downhearted because of ashley and melanie.  and she would flirt
with every man there.  that would be cruel to ashley, but it would
make him yearn for her all the more.  she wouldn't overlook a man
of marriageable age, from ginger-whiskered old frank kennedy, who
was suellen's beau, on down to shy, quiet, blushing charles
hamilton, melanie's brother.  they would swarm around her like
bees around a hive, and certainly ashley would be drawn from
melanie to join the circle of her admirers.  then somehow she
would maneuver to get a few minutes alone with him, away from the
crowd.  she hoped everything would work out that way, because it
would be more difficult otherwise.  but if ashley didn't make the
first move, she would simply have to do it herself.

 seen, but scarlett knew she probably was
in the kitchen giving final instructions to the servants.  poor
india, thought scarlett, she's had so much trouble keeping house
since her mother died that she's never had the chance to catch any
beau except stuart tarleton, and it certainly wasn't my fault if
he thought i was prettier than she.

john wilkes came down the steps to offer his arm to scarlett.  as
she descended from the carriage, she saw suellen smirk and knew
that she must have picked out frank kennedy in the crowd.

if i couldn't catch a better beau than that old maid in britches!
she thought contemptuously, as she stepped to the ground and
smiled her thanks to john wilkes.

frank kennedy was hurrying to the carriage to assist suellen, and
suellen was bridling in a way that made scarlett want to slap her.
frank kennedy might own more land than anyone in the county and he
might have a very kind heart, but these things counted for nothing
against the fact that he was forty, slight and nervous

cade lounged gracefully on her left, plucking at her skirt to
attract her attention and staring up with smoldering eyes at
stuart.  already the air was electric between him and the twins
and rude words had passed.  frank kennedy fussed about like a hen
with one chick, running back and forth from the shade of the oak
to the tables to fetch dainties to tempt scarlett, as if there
were not a dozen servants there for that purpose.  as a result,
suellen's sullen resentment had passed beyond the point of
ladylike concealment and she glowered at scarlett.  small carreen
could have cried because, for all scarlett's encouraging words
that morning, brent had done no more than say "hello, sis" and
jerk her hair ribbon before turn

now!"

scarlett could not speak.  the defection of her beaux was almost
insulting.  especially when she recalled how wildly both the twins
had acted when she told them she was going to marry charles.
stuart had even threatened to shoot charles, or scarlett, or
himself, or all three.  it had been most exciting.

"suellen?" questioned melly, breaking into a pleased smile.  "but
i thought mr. kennedy--"

"oh, him?" said gerald.  "frank kennedy still pussyfoots about,
afraid of his shadow, and i'll be asking him his intentions soon
if he doesn't speak up.  no, 'tis me baby."

"carreen?"

"she's nothing but a child!" said scarlett sharply, finding her
tongue.

"she's little more than a year younger than you were, miss, when
you were married," retorted gerald.  "is it you're grudging your
old beau to your sister?"

melly blushed, unaccustomed to such frankness, and signaled peter
to bring in the sweet potato pie.  frantically she cast a

eep.  the demands of the
confederate commissary were growing heavier by the month, and hers
was the task of making tara produce.  even gerald was busy, for
the first time in many years, for he could get no overseer to take
jonas wilkerson's place and he was riding his own acres.  with
ellen too busy for more than a goodnight kiss and gerald in the
fields all day, scarlett found tara boring.  even her sisters were
taken up with their own concerns.  suellen had now come to an
"understanding" with frank kennedy and sang "when this cruel war
is over" with an arch meaning scarlett found well-nigh
unendurable, and carreen was too wrapped up in dreams of brent
tarleton to be interesting company.

though scarlett always went home to tara with a happy heart, she
was never sorry when the inevitable letters came from pitty and
melanie, begging her to return.  ellen always sighed at these
times, saddened by the thought of her oldest daughter and her only
grandchild leaving her.

under the strain she grew white and thin.  the pretty roundness
left her face, throwing her cheek bones into prominence,
emphasizing her slanting green eyes and giving her the look of a
prowling, hungry cat.

"daytime is enough like a nightmare without my dreaming things,"
she thought desperately and began hoarding her daily ration to eat
it just before she went to sleep.



at christmas time frank kennedy and a small troop from the
commissary department jogged up to tara on a futile hunt for grain
and animals for the army.  they were a ragged and ruffianly
appearing crew, mounted on lame and heaving horses which obviously
were in too bad condition to be used for more active service.  like
their animals the men had been invalided out of the front-line
forces and, except for frank, all of them had an arm missing or an
eye gone or stiffened joints.  most of them wore blue overcoats of
captured yank

as they had been accustomed to do in days long past.  they refused
to be serious about the war, told outrageous lies to make the girls
laugh and brought to the bare and looted house the first lightness,
the first hint of festivity it had known in many a day.

"it's almost like the old days when we had house parties, isn't
it?" whispered suellen happily to scarlett.  suellen was raised to
the skies by having a beau of her own in the house again and she
could hardly take her eyes off frank kennedy.  scarlett was
surprised to see that suellen could be almost pretty, despite the
thinness which had persisted since her illness.  her cheeks were
flushed and there was a soft luminous look in her eyes.

"she really must care about him," thought scarlett in contempt.
"and i guess she'd be almost human if she ever had a husband of her
own, even if her husband was old fuss-budget frank."

carreen had brightened a little too, and some of the sleep-walking
look left her eyes that night.  she had fou

hastily handed it back amid roars of laughter.  she met melanie's
eyes and the same thought was plain in both faces. . . .  "how can
they go on fighting if they have only this stuff to eat?"

the meal was gay enough and even gerald, presiding absently at the
head of the table, managed to evoke from the back of his dim mind
some of the manner of a host and an uncertain smile.  the men
talked, the women smiled and flattered--but scarlett turning
suddenly to frank kennedy to ask him news of miss pittypat, caught
an expression on his face which made her forget what she intended
to say.

his eyes had left suellen's and were wandering about the room, to
gerald's childlike puzzled eyes, to the floor, bare of rugs, to the
mantelpiece denuded of its ornaments, the sagging springs and torn
upholstery into which yankee bayonets had ripped, the cracked
mirror above the sideboard, the unfaded squares on the wall where
pictures had hung before the looters came, the scant t

fishlines in the river rebaited.  there were beds to be made and
floors to be swept, food to be cooked and dishes washed, hogs and

pastured near the swamp and someone had to watch her all day for

"what do you mean?"

"just what i say.  what's going to happen to them?  there's no one
to marry them.  why, melly, with all the boys dead, there'll be
thousands of girls all over the south who'll die old maids."

"and never have any children," added melanie, to whom this was the
most important thing.

evidently the thought was not new to suellen who sat in the back of
the wagon, for she suddenly began to cry.  she had not heard from
frank kennedy since christmas.  she did not know if the lack of
mail service was the cause, or if he had merely trifled with her
affections and then forgotten her.  or maybe he had been killed in
the last days of the war!  the latter would have been infinitely
preferable to his forgetting her, for at least there was some
dignity about a dead love, such as carreen and india wilkes had,
but none about a deserted fiancee.

"oh, in the name of god, hush!" said scarlett.

"oh, you can talk," sobbed suellen, "beca

"miss scarlett, what are you doing over in this section by
yourself?  don't you know it's dangerous these days?  and you are
soaking wet.  here, wrap the robe around your feet."

as he fussed over her, clucking like a hen, she gave herself up to
the luxury of being taken care of.  it was nice to have a man
fussing and clucking and scolding, even if it was only that old
maid in pants, frank kennedy.  it was especially soothing after
rhett's brutal treatment.  and oh, how good to see a county face
when she was so far from home!  he was well dressed, she noticed,
and the buggy was new too.  the horse looked young and well fed,
but frank looked far older than his years, older than on that
christmas eve when he had been at tara with his men.  he was thin
and sallow faced and his yellow eyes were watery and sunken in
creases of loose flesh.  his ginger-colored beard was scantier than

"i'm glad you agree with me, miss scarlett.  in a way, it's been on
my conscience.  lots of folks have told me:  'oh, forget about it,

done what wasn't right.  do you think i did right?"

"of course," she said, wondering what the old fool had been talking
about.  some struggle with his conscience.  when a man got as old
as frank kennedy he ought to have learned not to bother about
things that didn't matter.  but he always was so nervous and fussy
and old maidish.

no explanations were asked, no reproaches made.  mammy understood
and was silent.  in mammy, scarlett had found a realist more
uncompromising than herself.  the mottled wise old eyes saw deeply,
saw clearly, with the directness of the savage and the child,
undeterred by conscience when danger threatened her pet.  scarlett
was her baby and what her baby wanted, even though it belonged to
another, mammy was willing to help her obtain.  the rights of
suellen and frank kennedy did not even enter her mind, save to
cause a grim inward chuckle.  scarlett was in trouble and doing the
best she could, and scarlett was miss ellen's child.  mammy rallied
to her with never a moment's hesitation.

scarlett felt the silent reinforcement and, as the hot brick at her
feet warmed her, the hope which had flickered faintly on the cold
ride home grew into a flame.  it swept through her, making her
heart pump the blood through her veins in pounding surges.

hastily.  "i will sit them out."

her eyes singled out frank kennedy and beckoned him from the side
of mrs. elsing.

"i'll sit in that alcove yonder if you'll bring me some
refreshments and then we can have a nice chat," she told frank as
the other three men moved off.

when he had hurried away to bring her a glass of wine and a paper
thin slice of cake, scarlett sat down in the alcove at the end of
the drawing room and carefully arranged her skirts so that the
worst spots would not show.  the humiliating events of the morning

going to rush into life and wrest from it what she could.  her
father had started as a poor immigrant boy and had won the broad
acres of tara.  what he had done, his daughter could do.  she
wasn't like these people who had gambled everything on a cause that
was gone and were content to be proud of having lost that cause,
because it was worth any sacrifice.  they drew their courage from
the past.  she was drawing hers from the future.  frank kennedy, at
present, was her future.  at least, he had the store and he had
cash money.  and if she could only marry him and get her hands on
that money, she could make ends meet at tara for another year.  and
after that--frank must buy the sawmill.  she could see for herself
how quickly the town was rebuilding and anyone who could establish
a lumber business now, when there was so little competition, would
have a gold mine.

if he possessed those qualities, he'd probably have sense enough to
feel the desperation that lurked just beneath her demurely
fluttering eyelids.  as it was, he didn't know enough about women
even to suspect what she was up to.  that was her good fortune but
it did not increase her respect for him.



chapter xxxvi


she married frank kennedy two weeks later after a whirlwind
courtship which she blushingly told him left her too breathless to
oppose his ardor any longer.

he did not know that during those two weeks she had walked the
floor at night, gritting her teeth at the slowness with which he
took hints and encouragements, praying that no untimely letter from
suellen would reach him and ruin her plans.  she thanked god that
her sister was the poorest of correspondents, delighting to receive
letters and disliking to write them.

fairs."

she made him feel, for the first time in his old-maidish life, that
he was a strong upstanding man fashioned by god in a nobler mold
than other men, fashioned to protect silly helpless women.

when, at last, they stood together to be married, her confiding
little hand in his and her downcast lashes throwing thick black
crescents on her pink cheeks, he still did not know how it all came
about.  he only knew he had done something romantic and exciting
for the first time in his life.  he, frank kennedy, had swept this
lovely creature off her feet and into his strong arms.  that was a
heady feeling.

no friend or relative stood up with them at their marriage.  the
witnesses were strangers called in from the street.  scarlett had
insisted on that and he had given in, though reluctantly, for he
would have liked his sister and his brother-in-law from jonesboro
to be with him.  and a reception with toasts drunk to the bride in
miss pitty's parlor amid happy friends would have been a joy to
him.  b

 that the deed was done, she
realized this with a wave of homesickness hard to dispel.  but
there it was.  she had made her bargain and she intended to stand
by it.  and she was so grateful to frank for saving tara she felt a
warm affection for him and an equally warm determination that he
should never regret marrying her.

the ladies of atlanta knew their neighbors' business only slightly
less completely than they knew their own and were far more
interested in it.  they all knew that for years frank kennedy had
had an "understanding" with suellen o'hara.  in fact, he had said,
sheepishly, that he expected to get married in the spring.  so the
tumult of gossip, surmise and deep suspicion which followed the
announcement of his quiet wedding to scarlett was not surprising.
mrs. merriwether, who never let her curiosity go long unsatisfied
if she could help it, asked him point-blank just what he meant by
marrying one sister when he was betrothed to the other.  she
reported to mrs. elsing that all the a

he sank into a chair beside her and grinned.

"i hear you couldn't even wait two weeks for me," he said and gave
a mock sigh.  "how fickle is woman!"

when she did not reply he continued.

"tell me, scarlett, just between friends--between very old and very
intimate friends--wouldn't it have been wiser to wait until i got
out of jail?  or are the charms of wedlock with old frank kennedy
more alluring than illicit relations with me?"

as always when his mockery aroused wrath within her, wrath fought
with laughter at his impudence.

"don't be absurd."

"and would you mind satisfying my curiosity on one point which has
bothered me for some time?  did you have no womanly repugnance, no
delicate shrinking from marrying not just one man but two for whom
you had no love or even affection?  or have i been misinformed
about the delicacy of our southern womanhood?"

"rhett!"

"i have my

you everything before you get home--i want to ask your opinion on a
matter. i figger you're the head of the house now."

"what is it, will?"

he turned his mild sober gaze on her for a moment.

"i just wanted your approval to my marryin' suellen."

scarlett clutched the seat, so surprised that she almost fell
backwards.  marry suellen!  she'd never thought of anybody marrying
suellen since she had taken frank kennedy from her.  who would have
suellen?

"goodness, will!"

"then i take it you don't mind?"

"mind?  no, but--  why, will, you've taken my breath away!  you
marry suellen?  will, i always thought you were sweet on carreen."

will kept his eyes on the horse and flapped the reins.  his profile
did not change but she thought he sighed slightly.

"maybe i was," he said.

"well, won't she have you?"

"i never asked her."

"oh, will, you're a fool.  ask her.  she's worth two of suellen!"

"scarlett, you

proud to wear them.  but not suellen.  and she wanted a horse and
carriage too.  she pointed out that you had one."

"it's not a carriage, it's an old buggy," said scarlett indignantly.

"well, no matter what.  i might as well tell you suellen never has
got over your marryin' frank kennedy and i don't know as i blame
her.  you know that was a kind of scurvy trick to play on a
sister."

scarlett rose from his shoulder, furious as a rattler ready to
strike.

head, will benteen!  could i help it if he preferred me to her?"

"you'll tell me now."

"hate to say it in front of ladies.  if you ladies'll step out of
the room--"

"i won't go," cried melanie, dabbing angrily at her eyes with her
handkerchief.  "i have a right to know.  where was my husband?"

"at belle watling's sporting house," said rhett, looking abashed.
"he was there and hugh and frank kennedy and dr. meade and--and a
whole lot of them.  had a party.  big party.  champagne.  girls--"

"at--at belle watling's?"

melanie's voice rose until it cracked with such pain that all eyes
turned frightenedly to her.  her hand went clutching at her bosom
and, before archie could catch her, she had fainted.  then a hubbub
ensued, archie picking her up, india running to the kitchen for
water, pitty and scarlett fanning her and slapping her wrists,
while hugh elsing shouted over and over:  "now you'

before dawn, every ex-confederate family in town knew everything.
and their negroes, who had been told nothing, knew everything too,
by that black grapevine telegraph system which defies white
understanding.  everyone knew the details of the raid, the killing
of frank kennedy and crippled tommy wellburn and how ashley was
wounded in carrying frank's body away.

some of the feeling of bitter hatred the women bore scarlett for
her share in the tragedy was mitigated by the knowledge that her
husband was dead and she knew it and could not admit it and have
the poor comfort of claiming his body.  until morning light
disclosed the bodies and the authorities notified her, she must
know nothing.  frank and tommy, pistols in cold hands, lay

what i can't understand is why he is doing all this--going to all

about him and mrs. kennedy.  i've seen them coming in from rides
