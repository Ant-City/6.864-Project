  the good aeneas, paternal care
  iulus' absence could no longer bear,
  dispatch'd achates to the ships in haste,
  to give a glad relation of the past,
  and, fraught with precious gifts, to bring the boy,
  snatch'd from the ruins of unhappy troy:
  a robe of tissue, stiff with golden wire;
  an upper vest, once helen's rich attire,
  from argos by the fam'd adultress brought,
  with golden flow'rs and winding foliage wrought,
  her mother leda's present, when she came
  to ruin troy and set the world on flame;
  the scepter priam's eldest daughter bore,
  her orient necklace, and the crown she wore
  of double texture, glorious to behold,
  one order set with gems, and one with gold.
  instructed thus, the wise achates goes,
  and in his diligence his duty shows.

  my father's image fill'd my pious mind,
  lest equal years might equal fortune find.
  again i thought on my forsaken wife,
  and trembled for my son's abandon'd life.
  i look'd about, but found myself alone,
  deserted at my need! my friends were gone.
  some spent with toil, some with despair oppress'd,
  leap'd headlong from the heights; the flames consum'd the rest.
  thus, wand'ring in my way, without a guide,
  the graceless helen in the porch i spied
  of vesta's temple; there she lurk'd alone;
  muffled she sate, and, what she could, unknown:
  but, by the flames that cast their blaze around,
  that common bane of greece and troy i found.
  for ilium burnt, she dreads the trojan sword;
  more dreads the vengeance of her injur'd lord;
  ev'n by those gods who refug'd her abhorr'd.
  trembling with rage, the strumpet i regard,
  resolv'd to give her guilt the due reward:

  then from her rosy lips began to speak:
  'my son, from whence this madness, this neglect
  of my commands, and those whom i protect?
  why this unmanly rage? recall to mind
  whom you forsake, what pledges leave behind.
  look if your helpless father yet survive,
  or if ascanius or creusa live.
  around your house the greedy grecians err;
  and these had perish'd in the nightly war,
  but for my presence and protecting care.
  not helen's face, nor paris, was in fault;
  but by the gods was this destruction brought.
  now cast your eyes around, while i dissolve
  the mists and films that mortal eyes involve,
  purge from your sight the dross, and make you see
  the shape of each avenging deity.
  enlighten'd thus, my just commands fulfil,
  nor fear obedience to your mother's will.

  not forc'd, like us, to hard captivity,
  or in a haughty master's arms to lie.
  in grecian ships unhappy we were borne,
  endur'd the victor's lust, sustain'd the scorn:
  thus i submitted to the lawless pride
  of pyrrhus, more a handmaid than a bride.

  and helen's lovely daughter sought to wed;

  these words proceeded from his mouth divine:
  'o goddess-born, (for heav'n's appointed will,
  with greater auspices of good than ill,
  foreshows thy voyage, and thy course directs;
  thy fates conspire, and jove himself protects,)
  of many things some few i shall explain,
  teach thee to shun the dangers of the main,
  and how at length the promis'd shore to gain.
  the rest the fates from helenus conceal,
  and juno's angry pow'r forbids to tell.
  first, then, that happy shore, that seems so nigh,
  will far from your deluded wishes fly;
  long tracts of seas divide your hopes from italy:
  for you must cruise along sicilian shores,
  and stem the currents with your struggling oars;
  then round th' italian coast your navy steer;
  and, after this, to circe's island veer;
  and, last, before your new foundations rise,
  must pass the stygian lake, and view the nether skies.

  "'besides, if faith to helenus be due,

  i know, my dearest lord, the time will come,
  you in vain, reverse your cruel doom;
