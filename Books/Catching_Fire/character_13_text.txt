 see him nod in our direction and then 
they follow him over to greet us. 

i know chaff by sight because i've spent years 
watching him pass a bottle back and forth with 
haymitch on television. he's dark skinned, about six 
feet tall, and one of his arms ends in a stump because 
he lost his hand in the games he won thirty years 
ago. i'm sure they offered him some artificial 
replacement, like they did peeta when they had to 
amputate his lower leg, but i guess he didn't take it. 

the woman, seeder, looks almost like she could be 
from the seam, with her olive skin and straight black 
hair streaked with silver. only her golden brown eyes 
mark her as from another district. she must be 
around sixty, but she still looks strong, and there's no 
sign she's turned to liquor or morphling or any other 
chemical form of escape over the years. before either 
of us says a word, she embraces me. i know somehow 
it must be because of rue and thresh. before i can 
stop myself, i whisper, "the familie

letting it drop to the floor, and then 
kicks it away in disgust. except for her forest green 
slippers, she doesn't have on a stitch of clothing. 
"that's better." 

we end up on the same elevator with her, and she 
spends the whole ride to the seventh floor chatting to 
peeta about his paintings while the light of his still- 
glowing costume reflects off her bare breasts. when 
she leaves, i ignore him, but i just know he's 
grinning. i toss aside his hand as the doors close 
behind chaff and seeder, leaving us alone, and he 
breaks out laughing. 

"what?" i say, turning on him as we step out on our 
floor. 

"it's you, katniss. can't you see?" he says. "what's 
me?" i say. 

"why they're all acting like this. finnick with his 
sugar cubes and chaff kissing you and that whole 
thing with johanna stripping down." he tries to take 
on a more serious tone, unsuccessfully. "they're 
playing with you because you're so... you know." 

"no, i don't know," i say. and i really have no idea 
what he

 my mind 
about saving him in the arena, but i don't owe him 
more than that. 

as i watch the procession to the city circle, i think 
how it's bad enough that they dress us all up in 
costumes and parade us through the streets in 
chariots on a regular year. kids in costumes are silly, 
but aging victors, it turns out, are pitiful. a few who

are on the younger side, like johanna and finnick, or 
whose bodies haven't fallen into disrepair, like seeder 
and brutus, can still manage to maintain a little 
dignity. but the majority, who are in the clutches of 
drink or morphling or illness, look grotesque in their 
costumes, depicting cows and trees and loaves of 
bread. last year we chattered away about each 
contestant, but tonight there's only the occasional 
comment. small wonder the crowd goes wild when 
peeta and i appear, looking so young and strong and 
beautiful in our brilliant costumes. the very image of 
what tributes should be.

rategy, hasn't it? to train like 
careers?" counters haymitch. "and who makes up 
the career pack is generally agreed upon before the 
games begin. peeta barely got in with them last year." 

i think of the loathing i felt when i discovered peeta 
was with the careers during the last games. "so we're 
to try to get in with finnick and brutus — is that what 
you're saying?" 

"not necessarily. everyone's a victor. make your own 
pack if you'd rather. choose who you like. i'd suggest 
chaff and seeder. although finnick's not to be 
ignored," says haymitch. "find someone to team up 
with who might be of some use to you. remember, 
you're not in a ring full of trembling children 
anymore. these people are all experienced killers, no 
matter what shape they appear to be in." 

maybe he's right. only who could i trust? seeder 
maybe. but do i really want to make a pact with her, 
only to possibly have to kill her later? no. still, i made 
a pact with rue under the same circumstances. i tell

i confess. "last year i shot an arrow 
at them during my private training session." beetee 
and wiress look at me curiously. "i was provoked. so, 
do all force fields have a spot like that?" 

"chink," says wiress vaguely. 

"in the armor, as it were," finishes beetee. "ideally it'd 
be invisible, wouldn't it?" 

i want to ask them more, but lunch is announced. i 
look for peeta, but he's hanging with a group of about 
ten other victors, so i decide just to eat with district 
3. maybe i can get seeder to join us. 

when we make our way into the dining area, i see 
some of peeta's gang have other ideas. they're 
dragging all the smaller tables to form one large table 
so that we all have to eat together. now i don't know 
what to do. even at school i used to avoid eating at a 
crowded table. frankly, i'd probably have sat alone if 
madge hadn't made a habit of joining me. i guess i'd 
have eaten with gale except, being two grades apart, 
our lunch never fell at the same time. 

i take a tray

"forget it," i say with a shake of my head. "it's a lot of 
things." 

"darius," he says. 

"darius. the games. haymitch making us team up 
with the others," i say.

"it can just be you and me, you know," he says. 



"i know. but maybe haymitch is right," i say. "don't 
tell him i said so, but he usually is, where the games 
are concerned." 

"well, you can have final say about our allies. but 
right now, i'm leaning toward chaff and seeder," says 
peeta. 

"i'm okay with seeder, not chaff," i say. "not yet, 
anyway." 

"come on and eat with him. i promise, i won't let him 
kiss you again," says peeta. 

chaff doesn't seem as bad at lunch. he's sober, and 
while he talks too loud and makes bad jokes a lot, 
most of them are at his own expense. i can see why 
he would be good for haymitch, whose thoughts run 
so darkly. but i'm still not sure i'm ready to team up 
with him. 

i try hard to be more sociable, not just with chaff but

seeder quietly ruminates about how, back in district 
11, everyone assumes president snow is all-powerful. 
so if he's all-powerful, why doesn't he change the 
quell? and chaff, who comes right on her heels, 
insists the president could change the quell if he 
wanted to, but he must not think it matters much to 
anyone.

finnick and mags. but it turns out to be plenty hard 
for me as well. seeing the faces of the eight dead 
victors projected into the sky. 

the man from district 5, the one finnick took out 
with his trident, is the first to appear. that means 
that all the tributes in 1 through 4 are alive — the four 
careers, beetee and wiress, and, of course, mags and 
finnick. the man from district 5 is followed by the 
male morphling from 6, cecelia and woof from 8, 
both from 9, the woman from 10, and seeder from 11. 
the capitol seal is back with a final bit of music and 
then the sky goes dark except for the moon. 

no one speaks. i can't pretend i knew any of them 
well. but i'm thinking of those three kids hanging on 
to cecelia when they took her away. seeder's 
kindness to me at our meeting. even the thought of 
the glazed-eyed morphling painting my cheeks with 
yellow flowers gives me a pang. all dead. all gone. 

i don't know how long we might have sat here if it 
weren't for the arrival of
