antigone: 

dear sister! dear ismene! how many evils 

our father, oedipus, bequeathed to us! 

and is there one of them— do you know of one 

that zeus has not showered down upon our heads? 

i have seen pain, dishonor, shame, and ruin, 

i have seen them all, in what we have endured. 

and now comes this new edict by the king 

proclaimed throughout the city. have you heard? 

do you not know, even yet, our friends are threatened? 

they are to meet the fate of enemies. 10

our friends, antigone? no, i have heard

i have no news except that we two sisters 

lost our two brothers when they killed each other. 

i know the argive army fled last night, 

but what that means, or whether it makes my life 

harder or easier, i cannot tell. 

antigone: 

this i was sure of. so i brought you here 
beyond the palace gates to talk alone. 

ismene: 

what is the matter? i know you are deeply troubled. 20 

antigone: 

yes, for our brothers' fate. creon has given 

an honored burial to one, to the other 

only unburied shame. eteocles 

is laid in the earth with all the rites observed 

that give him his due honor with the dead. 

but the decree concerning polyneices 

published through thebes is that his wretched body 

shall lie unmourned, unwept, unsepulchered. 

sweet will he seem to the vultures when they find him, 

a welcome feast
