i was surprised that he gave his teal name to a stranger. everyone in our tribe had two names, the real one which was secret
and was seldom used, and one which was common, for if people use your secret name it becomes worn out and loses its
magic. thus i was known as won-a-pa-lei, which means the girl with the long black hair, though my secret name is 
karana. my father's secret name was chowig. why he gave it to a stranger i do not know.
the russian smiled and held up his hand, calling himself captain orlov. my father also held up his hand. i could not see his
face, but i doubted that he smiled in return.
'i have come with forty of my men,' said the russian. ‘we come to hunt sea otter. we wish to camp on your island while we
are hunting.'
my father said nothing. he was a tall man, though not so tall as captain orlov, and he stood with his bare shoulders thrown
back, thinking about what the russian had said. he was in no hurry to reply be- cause the aleuts had come before to hunt
otter. that was

long in the past, but my father still remembered them.
'you remember another hunt,' captain orlov said when my father was silent. 'i have heard of it, too. it was led by captain
mitriff who was a fool and is now dead. the trouble arose because you and your tribe did all of the hunting.'
'we hunted,' said my father, ‘but the one you call a fool wished us to hunt from one moon to the next, never ceasing.' 'this
time you will need to do nothing,' captain orlov said. 'my men will hunt and we will divide the catch. one part for you, to be
paid in goods, and two parts for us.'
'the parts must be equal,' my father said. captain orlov gazed off towards the sea. 'we can talk of that later when my
supplies are safe ashore,' he replied.
the morning was fair with little wind, yet it was the season of the year when storms could be looked for, so i understood
why the russian wished to move on to our island.
'it is better to agree now,' said my father.

ther, then turned and faced him. ‘one part to you is fair since the work is
ours and ours the risk.'
my father shook his head.
the russian grasped his beard. ‘since the sea is not yours, why do i have to give you any part ?' 
'the sea which surrounds the island of the blue dolphins belongs to us,' answered my father.
he spoke softly as he did when be was angry.
'from here to the coast of santa barbara - twenty leagues away?'
'no, only that which touches the island and where the otter live.'
captain orlov made a sound in his throat. he looked at our men standing on the beach and towards those who had now come
from behind the rocks. he looked at my father and shrugged his shoulders. suddenly he smiled, showing his long teeth.
'the parts shall be equal,' he said.
he said more, but i did not hear it, for at that instant in my great excitement i moved a small rock, which clattered down the
cliff and fell at his feet. everyone on the beach looked up. silently i left the toyon bushes and ran without s

captain orlov and his aleut hunters moved to the island that morning, making many trips from their ship to the beach of
coral cove. since the beach was small and almost flooded when the tide was in, he asked if he could camp on higher ground.
this my father agreed to.
perhaps i should tell you about our island so you will know how it looks and where our village was and where the aleuts
camped for most of the summer.
our island is two leagues long and one league wide, and if you were standing on one of the hi

my father's words were obeyed. we -did not go to the ateut camp and they did not come to our village. but this is not to say
that we did not know what they did - what they ate and in what way they cooked it, how many otter were killed each day, and
other things as well - for someone was always watching from the cliffs while they were hunting, or from the ravine when they
were in camp.
ramo, for instance, brought news about captain orlov.
'in the morning when he crawls out of his tent he sits on a rock and combs until the beard shines like a cormorant's wing,'
ramo said.
my sister ulape, who was two years older than i, gathered the most curious news of all. she swore that there was an aleut
girl among the hunters.
'she is dressed in skins just like the men,' ulape said. ‘but she wears a fur cap and under the cap she has thick hair that falls
to her waist.'
no one believed ulape. everyone laughed at the idea that hunters would

rty in your camp,' my father replied, 'and more than that of us. besides, you have your own fish, the dried ones
that you brought.'
'we tire of that kind,' the aleut said. he was a short man who only came to my father's shoulders, and he had small eyes like
black pebbles and a mouth like the edge of a stone knife. the other aleut looked very much like him.
'you are hunters,' my father said. ‘go and hunt your own fish if you are tired of what you are now eating. i have my people to
think of.'
'captain orlov will hear that you refuse to share the fish.'
'yes, tell him,' my father said. ‘but also why we refuse.'
the aleut grunted to his companion and the two of them stalked off on their short legs across the sand dunes that lay between
the village and their camp.
we ate the rest of the white bass that night and there was much rejoicing. but little did we know, as we ate and sang and the
older men told stories around the fire, that our good fortune would soon bring trouble to ghalas-at.

 some of our young men to the beach
to build a canoe from a log which had drifted in from the sea. 
there are no trees on the island except the small ones stunted by the wind. when a log came ashore, as happened once in a
long time, it was always carried to the village and worked on where a chance wave could not wash it away. that the men
were sent to hollow out the log in the cove, and to sleep beside it during the night, meant that they were there to watch the
aleuts, to give the alarm should captain orlov try to sail off without paying us for the otter skins.
everyone was afraid he might, so besides the men in the cove who watched the aleut ship, others kept watch on the camp.
every hour someone brought news. ulape said that the aleut woman spent a whole afternoon cleaning her skin aprons, which
she had not done before while she had been there. early one morning, ramo said he had just seen captain orlov carefully
trimming his beard so that it looked the way it did when he first came. the aleuts

who sharpened the long spears stopped this
work and gave all their time to skinning the otter which were brought in at dusk.
we in the village of ghalas-at knew that captain orlov and his hunters were getting ready to leave the island. would he pay
us for the otter he had slain or would he try to sneak away in the night ! \would our men have to fight for our rightful share !
these questions everyone asked while the aleuts went about their preparations - everyone except my father, who said
nothing, but each night worked on the new spear he was making.

the aleuts left on a sunless day. out of the north deep waves rolled down upon the island. they broke against the rocks

and
roared into the caves, sending up white sprays of water. before night a storm would certainly strike.
not long after dawn the aleuts took down their skin tents and carried them to the beach.
captain orlov had not paid my father for the otter he had killed. so when the news came that the hunters had packed their
tents, all of our tribe left the village and hurried towards coral cove. the men with their weapons went first and the women
followed. the men took the trail that led to the beach, but the women hid themselves among the brush on the cliff.
ulape and i went together far out on the ledge where i had hidden before when the hunters first came. 
the tide was low and the rocks and the narrow be

ach were scattered with bundles of otter pelts. half of the hunters were on
the ship. the rest were wading into the water, tossing the pelts into a boat. the aleuts laughed while they worked, as if they
were happy to leave the island.
my father was talking to captain orlov. i could not hear their words because of the noise the hunters made, but from the way
my father shook his head, i knew that he was not pleased.
'he is angry,' ulape whispered.
'not yet,' i said. ‘when he's really angry, he pulls his ear.
the men who were working on the canoe had stopped and were watching my father and captain orlov. the other men of our
tribe stood at the foot of the trail.
the boat went off to the ship filled with otter. as it reached the ship, captain orlov raised his hand

and gave a signal. when
the boat came back it held a black chest which two of the hunters carried to the beach.
captain orlov raised the lid and pulled out several necklaces. there was little light in the sky, yet the beads sparkled as he
named them this way and that. beside me, ulape drew in her breath in excitement, and i could hear cries of delight from the
women hidden in the brush.
but the cries suddenly ceased as my father shook his head and turned his back on the chest. the aleuts stood silent. our men
left their places at the foot of the trail and moved forward a few steps and waited, watching my father.
'one

string of beads for one otter pelt is not our bargain,' my father said.
'one string and one iron spearhead,' said captain orlov, lifting two fingers.
'the chest does not hold that much,' my father answered.
'there are more chests on the ship,' said the russian.
'then bring them to the shore,' my father said. 'you have one hundred and five bales of otter on the ship. there are fifteen
here in the cove. you will need three more chests of this size.' 
captain orlov said something to his aleuts that i could not understand, but its meaning was soon clear. there were many
hunters in the cove and as soon as he spoke they began to carry the otter pelts to the boat.
beside me ulape was scarcely breathing. ‘do you think that he will give us the other chests!' she whispered.
‘i do not trust him.'
'when he gets the pelts to the ship he may leave.'
'it is possible.'
the hunters had to pass my father to reach the boat, and when the first one approached him, he s

tepped in his path.
'the rest of the pelts must stay here,' he said, facing captain orlov, 'until the chests are brought.'
the russian drew himself up stiffly and pointed to the clouds that were blowing in towards the island.
'i load the ship before the storm arrives,' he said.
'give us the other chests. then i will help you with our canoes,' my father replied.
captain orlov was silent. his gaze moved slowly around the cove. he looked at our men standing on the ledge of rock a
dozen paces away. he looked upward towards the cliff and back at my father. then he spoke to his aleuts.
i do not know what happened first, whether it was my father who raised his hand against the hunter whose path he barred,
whether it was this man who stepped forward with a bale of pelts on his back and shoved my father aside. it all happened so
quickly that i could not tell one act from th

e other. but as i jumped to my feet and ulape screamed and other cries sounded
along the cliff, i saw a figure lying on the rocks. it was my father and blood was on his face. slowly he got to his feet.
with their spears raised our men rushed down across the ledge. a puff of white smoke came from the deck of the ship. a
loud noise echoed against the cliff. five of our warriors fell and lay quiet.
ulape screamed again and hung a rock into the cove. it fell harmlessly beside captain orlov. rocks showered into the cove
from many places along the cliff, striking several of the hunters. then our warriors rushed in upon them and it was hard to tell 
one from the other.
ulape and i: stood on the cliff, and watched helplessly, afraid to use the rocks we held lest we injure our own men.
the aleuts had dropped the bales of otter. they drew knives from their belts and as our warriors rushed upon them the two
lines surged back and forth along the beach. men fell to the sand and rose to fi

ght again. others fell and did not get up. my
father was one of these.
for a long time it seemed that we would win the battle. but captain orlov, who had rowed off to the ship when the battle
started, returned with more of his aleuts.
our warriors were forced backward to the cliffs. there were few of them left, yet they fought at the foot of the trail and
would not retreat.
the wind began to blow. suddenly captain orlov and his aleuts turned and ran to the boat. our men did not pursue them.
the hunters reached the ship, the red sails went up, and that ship moved slowly between the two rocks that guard the cove.
once more before it disappeared a white puff of smoke rose from the deck. as ulape and i ran along the cliffs a whirring
sound like a great bird in flight passed above our heads.

that night was the most terrible time in all the memory of ghalas-at. when the fateful day had dawned the tribe numbered
