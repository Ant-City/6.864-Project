 sent, but what else could be done?--and who, as the holidays were
about to begin, would be back from one day to the other. there had
been for the two children at first a young lady whom they had had the
misfortune to lose. she had done for them quite beautifully--she was a
most respectable person--till her death, the great awkwardness of which
had, precisely, left no alternative but the school for little miles.
mrs. grose, since then, in the way of manners and things, had done as
she could for flora; and there were, further, a cook, a housemaid, a
dairywoman, an old pony, an old groom, and an old gardener, all likewise
thoroughly respectable.

so far had douglas presented his picture when someone put a question.
“and what did the former governess die of?--of so much respectability?”

our friend’s answer was prompt. “that will come out. i don’t
anticipate.”

“excuse me--i thought that was just what you are doing.”

“in her successor’s place,” i suggested, “i should h

but within, that i had fancied i heard. there had been a moment when i
believed i recognized, faint and far, the cry of a child; there had been
another when i found myself just consciously starting as at the passage,
before my door, of a light footstep. but these fancies were not marked
enough not to be thrown off, and it is only in the light, or the gloom,
i should rather say, of other and subsequent matters that they now come
back to me. to watch, teach, “form” little flora would too evidently
be the making of a happy and useful life. it had been agreed between us
downstairs that after this first occasion i should have her as a matter
of course at night, her small white bed being already arranged, to that
end, in my room. what i had undertaken was the whole care of her, and
she had remained, just this last time, with mrs. grose only as an effect
of our consideration for my inevitable strangeness and her natural
timidity. in spite of this timidity--which the child

deep, sweet serenity indeed of one of raphael’s holy infants, to be
discussed, to be imputed to her, and to determine us--i feel quite sure
she would presently like me. it was part of what i already liked mrs.
grose herself for, the pleasure i could see her feel in my admiration
and wonder as i sat at supper with four tall candles and with my pupil,
in a high chair and a bib, brightly facing me, between them, over bread
and milk. there were naturally things that in flora’s presence could
pass between us only as prodigious and gratified looks, obscure and
roundabout allusions.

“and the little boy--does he look like her? is he too so very
remarkable?”

one wouldn’t flatter a child. “oh, miss, most remarkable. if you think
well of this one!”--and she stood there with a plate in her hand,
beaming at our companion, who looked from one of us to the other with
placid heavenly eyes that contained nothing to check us.

“yes; if i do--?”

just a storybook over which i had fallen adoze and adream? no; it was a
big, ugly, antique, but convenient house, embodying a few features of
a building still older, half-replaced and half-utilized, in which i had
the fancy of our being almost as lost as a handful of passengers in a
great drifting ship. well, i was, strangely, at the helm!

this came home to me when, two days later, i drove over with flora to
meet, as mrs. grose said, the little gentleman; and all the more for
an incident that, presenting itself the second evening, had deeply
disconcerted me. the first day had been, on the whole, as i have
expressed, reassuring; but i was to see it wind up in keen apprehension.
the postbag, that evening--it came late--contained a letter for me,
which, however, in the hand of my employer, i found to be composed but
of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal
still unbroken.

 be incredible.”

she was evidently grateful for such a profession. “see him, miss, first.
then believe it!” i felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was
the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen
almost to pain. mrs. grose was aware, i could judge, of what she had
produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. “you might as
well believe it of the little lady. bless her,” she added the next
moment--“look at her!”

i turned and saw that flora, whom, ten minutes before, i had established
in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of
nice “round o’s,” now presented herself to view at the open door.
she expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from
disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish
light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had
conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should
follow me. i needed nothing more than

t was exactly present to me--by which i mean the face
was--when, on the first of these occasions, at the end of a long june
day, i stopped short on emerging from one of the plantations and coming
into view of the house. what arrested me on the spot--and with a shock
much greater than any vision had allowed for--was the sense that my
imagination had, in a flash, turned real. he did stand there!--but high
up, beyond the lawn and at the very top of the tower to which, on that
first morning, little flora had conducted me. this tower was one of
a pair--square, incongruous, crenelated structures--that were
distinguished, for some reason, though i could see little difference,
as the new and the old. they flanked opposite ends of the house and were
probably architectural absurdities, redeemed in a measure indeed by
not being wholly disengaged nor of a height too pretentious, dating, in
their gingerbread antiquity, from a romantic revival that was already a
respectable past. i admired them, had fanc

unobserved, enjoyed the prospect from the best point of view, and then
stolen out as he came. if he had given me such a bold hard stare, that
was but a part of his indiscretion. the good thing, after all, was that
we should surely see no more of him.

this was not so good a thing, i admit, as not to leave me to judge that
what, essentially, made nothing else much signify was simply my charming
work. my charming work was just my life with miles and flora, and
through nothing could i so like it as through feeling that i could throw
myself into it in trouble. the attraction of my small charges was a
constant joy, leading me to wonder afresh at the vanity of my original
fears, the distaste i had begun by entertaining for the probable gray
prose of my office. there was to be no gray prose, it appeared, and no
long grind; so how could work not be charming that presented itself as
daily beauty? it was all the romance of the nursery and the poetry of

actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer. i walked
in a world of their invention--they had no occasion whatever to draw
upon mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some
remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that
was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly
distinguished sinecure. i forget what i was on the present occasion;
i only remember that i was something very important and very quiet and
that flora was playing very hard. we were on the edge of the lake, and,
as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the sea of azof.

suddenly, in these circumstances, i became aware that, on the other
side of the sea of azof, we had an interested spectator. the way this
knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world--the
strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly
merged itself. i had sat down with a piece of work--for i was something

ttle effect on my practical certitude
as i was conscious--still even without looking--of its having upon the
character and attitude of our visitor. nothing was more natural than
that these things should be the other things that they absolutely were
not.

of the positive identity of the apparition i would assure myself as
soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right
second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, i
transferred my eyes straight to little flora, who, at the moment, was
about ten yards away. my heart had stood still for an instant with the
wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and i
held my breath while i waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden
innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me. i waited,
but nothing came; then, in the first place--and there is something
more dire in this, i feel, than in anything i have to relate--i was
determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds fr

no intelligible account of how i fought out the interval. yet i still
hear myself cry as i fairly threw myself into her arms: “they know--it’s
too monstrous: they know, they know!”

“and what on earth--?” i felt her incredulity as she held me.

“why, all that we know--and heaven knows what else besides!” then, as
she released me, i made it out to her, made it out perhaps only now with
full coherency even to myself. “two hours ago, in the garden”--i could
scarce articulate--“flora saw!”

mrs. grose took it as she might have taken a blow in the stomach. “she
has told you?” she panted.

“not a word--that’s the horror. she kept it to herself! the child of
eight, that child!” unutterable still, for me, was the stupefaction of
it.

mrs. grose, of course, could only gape the wider. “then how do you
know?”

“i was there--i saw with my eyes: saw that she was perfectly aware.”

“do you mean aware of him?”

“no--of her.” i was conscious as i spoke that

my friend, with an odd impulse, fell back a step. “was she someone
you’ve never seen?”

“yes. but someone the child has. someone you have.” then, to show how i
had thought it all out: “my predecessor--the one who died.”

“miss jessel?”

“miss jessel. you don’t believe me?” i pressed.

she turned right and left in her distress. “how can you be sure?”

this drew from me, in the state of my nerves, a flash of impatience.
“then ask flora--she’s sure!” but i had no sooner spoken than i caught
myself up. “no, for god’s sake, don’t! she’ll say she isn’t--she’ll
lie!”

mrs. grose was not too bewildered instinctively to protest. “ah, how can
you?”

“because i’m clear. flora doesn’t want me to know.”

“it’s only then to spare you.”

“no, no--there are depths, depths! the more i go over it, the more i see
in it, and the more i see in it, the more i fear. i don’t know what i

“god help us, no. of something much worse.”

“worse than dislike?--this left her indeed at a loss.

“with a determination--indescribable. with a kind of fury of intention.”

i made her turn pale. “intention?”

“to get hold of her.” mrs. grose--her eyes just lingering on mine--gave
a shudder and walked to the window; and while she stood there looking
out i completed my statement. “that’s what flora knows.”

after a little she turned round. “the person was in black, you say?”

“in mourning--rather poor, almost shabby. but--yes--with extraordinary
beauty.” i now recognized to what i had at last, stroke by stroke,
brought the victim of my confidence, for she quite visibly weighed
this. “oh, handsome--very, very,” i insisted; “wonderfully handsome. but
infamous.”

she slowly came back to me. “miss jessel--was infamous.” she once more

suddenly become the least of my discomforts. it was my new suspicion
that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours
of the day had brought a little ease.

on leaving her, after my first outbreak, i had of course returned to my
pupils, associating the right remedy for my dismay with that sense of
their charm which i had already found to be a thing i could positively
cultivate and which had never failed me yet. i had simply, in other
words, plunged afresh into flora’s special society and there become
aware--it was almost a luxury!--that she could put her little conscious
hand straight upon the spot that ached. she had looked at me in sweet
speculation and then had accused me to my face of having “cried.” i had
supposed i had brushed away the ugly signs: but i could literally--for
the time, at all events--rejoice, under this fathomless charity, that
they had not entirely disappeared. to gaze into the depths of blue of
the child’s eyes and pronounce

happy capacity for an occasional slip. “if quint--on your remonstrance
at the time you speak of--was a base menial, one of the things miles
said to you, i find myself guessing, was that you were another.” again
her admission was so adequate that i continued: “and you forgave him
that?”

“wouldn’t you?”

“oh, yes!” and we exchanged there, in the stillness, a sound of the
oddest amusement. then i went on: “at all events, while he was with the
man--”

“miss flora was with the woman. it suited them all!”

it suited me, too, i felt, only too well; by which i mean that it suited
exactly the particularly deadly view i was in the very act of forbidding
myself to entertain. but i so far succeeded in checking the expression
of this view that i will throw, just here, no further light on it than
may be offered by the mention of my final observation to mrs. grose.

i was wholly awake. i recall further both a general conviction that it

figure, finally, that the white curtain draping, in the fashion of those
days, the head of flora’s little bed, shrouded, as i had assured myself
long before, the perfection of childish rest. i recollect in short that,
though i was deeply interested in my author, i found myself, at the turn
of a page and with his spell all scattered, looking straight up from
him and hard at the door of my room. there was a moment during which

there being something undefinably astir in the house, and noted the soft

i remained awhile at the top of the stair, but with the effect presently
of understanding that when my visitor had gone, he had gone: then i
returned to my room. the foremost thing i saw there by the light of the
candle i had left burning was that flora’s little bed was empty; and on
this i caught my breath with all the terror that, five minutes before,
i had been able to resist. i dashed at the place in which i had left her
lying and over which (for the small silk counterpane and the sheets were
disarranged) the white curtains had been deceivingly pulled forward;
then my step, to my unutterable relief, produced an answering sound: i
perceived an agitation of the window blind, and the child, ducking down,
emerged rosily from the other side o

, why not frankly
confess it to me, so that we may at least live with it together and
learn perhaps, in the strangeness of our fate, where we are and what
it means?” this solicitation dropped, alas, as it came: if i could
immediately have succumbed to it i might have spared myself--well,
you’ll see what. instead of succumbing i sprang again to my feet,
looked at her bed, and took a helpless middle way. “why did you pull the
curtain over the place to make me think you were still there?”

flora luminously considered; after which, with her little divine smile:
“because i don’t like to frighten you!”

“but if i had, by your idea, gone out--?”

she absolutely declined to be puzzled; she turned her eyes to the flame
of the candle as if the question were as irrelevant, or at any rate as
impersonal, as mrs. marcet or nine-times-nine. “oh, but you know,” she
quite adequately answered, “that you might come back, you dear, and that
you have!” and after a little, when she had

that indeed, from the particular
quality of its unexpectedness, proved quite my sharpest shock. it was
precisely the first night during this series that, weary with watching,
i had felt that i might again without laxity lay myself down at my
old hour. i slept immediately and, as i afterward knew, till about one
o’clock; but when i woke it was to sit straight up, as completely roused
as if a hand had shook me. i had left a light burning, but it was now
out, and i felt an instant certainty that flora had extinguished it.
this brought me to my feet and straight, in the darkness, to her bed,
which i found she had left. a glance at the window enlightened me
further, and the striking of a match completed the picture.

the child had again got up--this time blowing out the taper, and had
again, for some purpose of observation or response, squeezed in behind
the blind and was peering out into the night. that she now saw--as she
had not, i had satisfied myself, the previous time--was proved to me b

the long halter
of my boldness?

this thought held me sufficiently to make me cross to his threshold and
pause again. i preternaturally listened; i figured to myself what might
portentously be; i wondered if his bed were also empty and he too were
secretly at watch. it was a deep, soundless minute, at the end of which
my impulse failed. he was quiet; he might be innocent; the risk was
hideous; i turned away. there was a figure in the grounds--a figure
prowling for a sight, the visitor with whom flora was engaged; but it
was not the visitor most concerned with my boy. i hesitated afresh, but
on other grounds and only for a few seconds; then i had made my choice.
there were empty rooms at bly, and it was only a question of choosing
the right one. the right one suddenly presented itself to me as the
lower one--though high above the gardens--in the solid corner of the
house that i have spoken of as the old tower. this was a large, square
chamber, arranged with some state as a bedroom, the extra

account of himself that permitted least of my going behind it, and it
was only with the effect of confirming my acceptance of it that, as i
presently glanced about the room, i could say--

“then you didn’t undress at all?”

he fairly glittered in the gloom. “not at all. i sat up and read.”

“and when did you go down?”

“at midnight. when i’m bad i am bad!”

“i see, i see--it’s charming. but how could you be sure i would know
it?”

“oh, i arranged that with flora.” his answers rang out with a readiness!
“she was to get up and look out.”

“which is what she did do.” it was i who fell into the trap!

“so she disturbed you, and, to see what she was looking at, you also
looked--you saw.”

“while you,” i concurred, “caught your death in the night air!”

he literally bloomed so from this exploit that he could afford radiantly
to assent. “how otherwise should i have been bad enough?” he asked.
then, after another embrace, the incident

it revealed a real acceptance of my further proof of what, in the bad
time--for there had been a worse even than this!--must have occurred.
there could have been no such justification for me as the plain assent
of her experience to whatever depth of depravity i found credible in
our brace of scoundrels. it was in obvious submission of memory that she
brought out after a moment: “they were rascals! but what can they now
do?” she pursued.

“do?” i echoed so loud that miles and flora, as they passed at their
distance, paused an instant in their walk and looked at us. “don’t
they do enough?” i demanded in a lower tone, while the children, having
smiled and nodded and kissed hands to us, resumed their exhibition. we
were held by it a minute; then i answered: “they can destroy them!” at
this my companion did turn, but the inquiry she launched was a silent
one, the effect of which was to make me more explicit. “they don’t know,
as yet, quite how--but they’re try

d my first sight of quint, and in which,
too, at those other instants, i had, after seeing him through the
window, looked for him in vain in the circle of shrubbery. i recognized
the signs, the portents--i recognized the moment, the spot. but they
remained unaccompanied and empty, and i continued unmolested; if
unmolested one could call a young woman whose sensibility had, in the
most extraordinary fashion, not declined but deepened. i had said in my
talk with mrs. grose on that horrid scene of flora’s by the lake--and
had perplexed her by so saying--that it would from that moment distress
me much more to lose my power than to keep it. i had then expressed what
was vividly in my mind: the truth that, whether the children really
saw or not--since, that is, it was not yet definitely proved--i greatly
preferred, as a safeguard, the fullness of my own exposure. i was ready
to know the very worst that was to be known. what i had then had an ugly
glimpse of was that my eyes might be sealed just

any deepened exhilaration or quickened recitation or louder strum of the
piano. then it was that the others, the outsiders, were there. though
they were not angels, they “passed,” as the french say, causing me,
while they stayed, to tremble with the fear of their addressing to their
younger victims some yet more infernal message or more vivid image than
they had thought good enough for myself.

what it was most impossible to get rid of was the cruel idea that,
whatever i had seen, miles and flora saw more--things terrible and
unguessable and that sprang from dreadful passages of intercourse in the
past. such things naturally left on the surface, for the time, a chill
which we vociferously denied that we felt; and we had, all three, with
repetition, got into such splendid training that we went, each time,
almost automatically, to mark the close of the incident, through the
very same movements. it was striking of the children, at all events,
to kiss me inveterately with a kind of wild irr

e silent; and i thought with envy of the comparative dusk of the pew
and of the almost spiritual help of the hassock on which i might bend
my knees. i seemed literally to be running a race with some confusion
to which he was about to reduce me, but i felt that he had got in first
when, before we had even entered the churchyard, he threw out--

“i want my own sort!”

it literally made me bound forward. “there are not many of your own
sort, miles!” i laughed. “unless perhaps dear little flora!”

“you really compare me to a baby girl?”

this found me singularly weak. “don’t you, then, love our sweet flora?”

“if i didn’t--and you, too; if i didn’t--!” he repeated as if retreating
for a jump, yet leaving his thought so unfinished that, after we had
come into the gate, another stop, which he imposed on me by the pressure
of his arm, had become inevitable. mrs. grose and flora had passed into
the church, the other worshippers had followed, and we were, for the
minute

she showed her surprise. “a friend--you?”

“oh, yes, i have a couple!” i laughed. “but did the children give you a
reason?”

“for not alluding to your leaving us? yes; they said you would like it
better. do you like it better?”

my face had made her rueful. “no, i like it worse!” but after an instant
i added: “did they say why i should like it better?”

“no; master miles only said, ‘we must do nothing but what she likes!’”

“i wish indeed he would. and what did flora say?”

“miss flora was too sweet. she said, ‘oh, of course, of course!’--and i
said the same.”

i thought a moment. “you were too sweet, too--i can hear you all. but
nonetheless, between miles and me, it’s now all out.”

“all out?” my companion stared. “but what, miss?”

“everything. it doesn’t matter. i’ve made up my mind. i came home, my
dear,” i went on, “for a talk with miss jessel.”

i had by this time formed the habit of having mrs. grose literally well

“and what did she say?” i can hear the good woman still, and the candor
of her stupefaction.

“that she suffers the torments--!”

it was this, of a truth, that made her, as she filled out my picture,
gape. “do you mean,” she faltered, “--of the lost?”

“of the lost. of the damned. and that’s why, to share them-” i faltered
myself with the horror of it.

but my companion, with less imagination, kept me up. “to share them--?”

“she wants flora.” mrs. grose might, as i gave it to her, fairly have
fallen away from me had i not been prepared. i still held her there, to
show i was. “as i’ve told you, however, it doesn’t matter.”

“because you’ve made up your mind? but to what?”

“to everything.”

“and what do you call ‘everything’?”

“why, sending for their uncle.”

“oh, miss, in pity do,” my friend broke out. “ah, but i will, i will! i
see it’s the only way. what’s ‘out,’ as i told you, with

my question had a sarcastic force that i had not fully intended, and

again in her eyes. “ah, miss, you write!”

“well--tonight,” i at last answered; and on this we separated.

i went so far, in the evening, as to make a beginning. the weather had
changed back, a great wind was abroad, and beneath the lamp, in my room,
with flora at peace beside me, i sat for a long time before a blank
sheet of paper and listened to the lash of the rain and the batter of
the gusts. finally i went out, taking a candle; i crossed the passage
and listened a minute at miles’s door. what, under my endless obsession,
i had been impelled to listen for was some betrayal of his not being at
rest, and i presently caught one, but not in the form i had expected.
his voice tinkled out. “i say, you there--come in.” it was a gaiety in
the gloom!

played; and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking
a football i can only say that i wholly agree with them. for at the
end of a time that under his influence i had quite ceased to measure, i
started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post. it
was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet i hadn’t
really, in the least, slept: i had only done something much worse--i had
forgotten. where, all this time, was flora? when i put the question to
miles, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say:
“why, my dear, how do _i_ know?”--breaking moreover into a happy laugh
which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he
prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.

i went straight to my room, but his sister was not there; then, before
going downstairs, i looked into several others. as she was nowhere
about she would surely be with mrs. grose, whom, in the comfort of that

acquaintance with sheets of water was small, and the pool of bly, at all
events on the few occasions of my consenting, under the protection of
my pupils, to affront its surface in the old flat-bottomed boat moored
there for our use, had impressed me both with its extent and its
agitation. the usual place of embarkation was half a mile from the
house, but i had an intimate conviction that, wherever flora might
be, she was not near home. she had not given me the slip for any small
adventure, and, since the day of the very great one that i had shared
with her by the pond, i had been aware, in our walks, of the quarter to
which she most inclined. this was why i had now given to mrs. grose’s
steps so marked a direction--a direction that made her, when she
perceived it, oppose a resistance that showed me she was freshly
mystified. “you’re going to the water, miss?--you think she’s in--?”

“beyond a doubt. you shall see.”

“oh, thank you!” my friend cried, planted so firm that, taking it in, i
went straight on without her. by the time i reached the pool, however,
she was close behind me, and i knew that, whatever, to her apprehension,
might befall me, the exposure of my society struck her as her least
danger. she exhaled a moan of relief as we at last came in sight of the
greater part of the water without a sight of the child. there was no
trace of flora on that nearer side of the bank where my observation of
her had been most startling, and none on the opposite edge, where, save
for a margin of some twenty yards, a thick copse came down to the water.
the pond, oblong in shape, had a width so scant compared to its length
that, with its ends out of view, it might have been taken for a scant
river. we looked at the empty expanse, and then i felt the suggestion
of my friend’s eyes. i knew what she meant and i replied with a negative

this time, too long among wonders and had panted to too many livelier
measures. there was a gate in the fence, through which we passed, and
that brought us, after a trifling interval, more into the open. then,
“there she is!” we both exclaimed at once.

flora, a short way off, stood before us on the grass and smiled as if
her performance was now complete. the next thing she did, however, was
to stoop straight down and pluck--quite as if it were all she was there
for--a big, ugly spray of withered fern. i instantly became sure she
had just come out of the copse. she waited for us, not herself taking a
step, and i was conscious of the rare solemnity with which we presently
approached her. she smiled and smiled, and we met; but it was all done

ence by this time flagrantly ominous. mrs. grose was the first
to break the spell: she threw herself on her knees and, drawing the
child to her breast, clasped in a long embrace the little tender,
yielding body. while this dumb convulsion lasted i could only watch
it--which i did the more intently when i saw flora’s face peep at me
over our companion’s shoulder. it was serious now--the flicker had left
it; but it strengthened the pang with which i at that moment envied mrs.
grose the simplicity of her relation. still, all this while, nothing
more passed between us save that flora had let her foolish fern again
drop to the ground. what she and i had virtually said to each other was
that pretexts were useless now. when mrs. grose finally got up she kept
the child’s hand, so that the two were still be

fore me; and the singular
reticence of our communion was even more marked in the frank look she
launched me. “i’ll be hanged,” it said, “if _i_‘ll speak!”

it was flora who, gazing all over me in candid wonder, was the first.
she was struck with our bareheaded aspect. “why, where are your things?”

“where yours are, my dear!” i promptly returned.

she had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an
answer quite sufficient. “and where’s miles?” she went on.

there was something in the small valor of it that quite finished me:
these three words from her were, in a flash like the glitter of a drawn
blade, the jostle of the cup that

 which, in turn, within a
few seconds, was completed by a gasp of my own. i seized my colleague’s
arm. “she’s there, she’s there!”

miss jessel stood before us on the opposite bank exactly as she had
stood the other time, and i remember, strangely, as the first feeling
now produced in me, my thrill of joy at having brought on a proof. she
was there, and i was justified; she was there, and i was neither cruel
nor mad. she was there for poor scared mrs. grose, but she was there
most for flora; and no moment of my monstrous time was perhaps so
extraordinary as that in which i consciously threw out to her--with
the sense that, pale and ravenous demon as she was, she would catch and
understand it--an inarticulate message of gratitude. she rose erect on
the spot my friend and i had lately quitted, and there was not, in all
the long reach of her desire, an inch of her evil that fell short. this
first vividness of vision and emotion were things of a few seconds,
during which mrs. grose’

s dazed blink across to where i pointed struck
me as a sovereign sign that she too at last saw, just as it carried my
own eyes precipitately to the child. the revelation then of the manner
in which flora was affected startled me, in truth, far more than it
would have done to find her also merely agitated, for direct dismay
was of course not what i had expected. prepared and on her guard as our
pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal; and i
was therefore shaken, on the spot, by my first glimpse of the particular
one for which i had not allowed. to see her, without a convulsion of
her small pink face, not even feign to glance in the direction of the
prodigy i announced, bu

ompassion--the mixture with her pity of
her relief at her exemption--a sense, touching to me even then, that she
would have backed me up if she could. i might well have needed that, for
with this hard blow of the proof that her eyes were hopelessly sealed
i felt my own situation horribly crumble, i felt--i saw--my livid
predecessor press, from her position, on my defeat, and i was conscious,
more than all, of what i should have from this instant to deal with in
the astounding little attitude of flora. into this attitude mrs. grose
immediately and violently entered, breaking, even while there pierced
through my sense of ruin a prodigious private triumph, into breathless
reassurance.

“she isn’t there, little lady, and nobody’s there--and you never see
nothing, my sweet! how can poor miss jessel--when poor miss jessel’s
dead and buried? we know, don’t we, love?”--and she appealed, blundering
in, to the child. “it’s all a mere mistake and a worry and a joke--and

 as fast as we can!”

our companion, on this, had responded with a strange, quick primness of
propriety, and they were again, with mrs. grose on her feet, united, as
it were, in pained opposition to me. flora continued to fix me with
her small mask of reprobation, and even at that minute i prayed god to
forgive me for seeming to see that, as she stood there holding tight
to our friend’s dress, her incomparable childish beauty had suddenly
failed, had quite vanished. i’ve said it already--she was literally,
she was hideously, hard; she had turned common and almost ugly. “i don’t
know what you mean. i see nobody. i see nothing. i never have. i think
you’re cruel. i don’t like you!” then,

made me understand that i must have thrown myself, on my face, on the
ground and given way to a wildness of grief. i must have lain there long
and cried and sobbed, for when i raised my head the day was almost done.
i got up and looked a moment, through the twilight, at the gray pool and
its blank, haunted edge, and then i took, back to the house, my dreary
and difficult course. when i reached the gate in the fence the boat,
to my surprise, was gone, so that i had a fresh reflection to make on
flora’s extraordinary command of the situation. she passed that night,
by the most tacit, and i should add, were not the word so grotesque a
false note, the happiest of arrangements, with mrs. grose. i saw
neither of them on my return, but, on the other hand, as by an ambiguous
compensation, i saw a great deal of miles. i saw--i can use no other
phrase--so much of him that it was as if it were more than it had ever
been. no evening i had passed at bly had the portentous quality of
this one; in spit

e of which--and in spite also of the deeper depths of
consternation that had opened beneath my feet--there was literally, in
the ebbing actual, an extraordinarily sweet sadness. on reaching the
house i had never so much as looked for the boy; i had simply gone
straight to my room to change what i was wearing and to take in, at
a glance, much material testimony to flora’s rupture. her little
belongings had all been removed. when later, by the schoolroom fire, i
was served with tea by the usual maid, i indulged, on the article of my
other pupil, in no inquiry whatever. he had his freedom now--he might
have it to the end! well, he did have it; and it consisted--in part at
least--of his coming in at about eight o’clock and sitting down with me
in silence. on the removal of the tea things i had blown out the candles
and drawn my chair closer: i was conscious o

f a mortal coldness and felt
as if i should never again be warm. so, when he appeared, i was sitting
in the glow with my thoughts. he paused a moment by the door as if to
look at me; then--as if to share them--came to the other side of the
hearth and sank into a chair. we sat there in absolute stillness; yet he
wanted, i felt, to be with me.

before a new day, in my room, had fully broken, my eyes opened to mrs.
grose, who had come to my bedside with worse news. flora was so markedly
feverish that an illness was perhaps at hand; she had passed a night of
extreme unrest, a night agitated above all by fears that had for their
subject not in the least her former, but wholly her present, governess.
it was not against the possible re-entrance of miss jessel on the scene
that she protested--it was conspicuously and passionately against mine.
i was promptly on my feet of course, and with an immense deal to ask;
the more that my friend had discernibly now girded her

r word about miss
jessel?”

“not one, miss. and of course you know,” my friend added, “i took it
from her, by the lake, that, just then and there at least, there was
nobody.”

“rather! and, naturally, you take it from her still.”

“i don’t contradict her. what else can i do?”

“nothing in the world! you’ve the cleverest little person to deal with.
they’ve made them--their two friends, i mean--still cleverer even than
nature did; for it was wondrous material to play on! flora has now her
grievance, and she’ll work it to the end.”

“yes, miss; but to what end?”

“why, that of dealing with me to her uncle. she’ll make me out to him
the lowest creature--!”

i winced at the fair show of the scene in mrs. grose’s face; she looked
for a minute as if she sharply saw them together. “and him who thinks so
well of you!”

“he has an odd way--it comes over me now,” i laughed,”--of proving it!
but that doesn’t matter. what flora wants, of course, is t

o get rid of
me.”

my companion bravely concurred. “never again to so much as look at you.”

“so that what you’ve come to me now for,” i asked, “is to speed me on my
way?” before she had time to reply, however, i had her in check. “i’ve a
better idea--the result of my reflections. my going would seem the right
thing, and on sunday i was terribly near it. yet that won’t do. it’s you
who must go. you must take flora.”

my visitor, at this, did speculate. “but where in the world--?”

“away from here. away from them. away, even most of all, now, from me.
straight to her uncle.”

“only to tell on you--?”

“no, not ‘only’! to leave me, in addition, with my remedy.”

she was still vague. “and what is your remedy?”

“your loyalty, to begin with. and then miles’s.”

she looked at me hard. “do you think he--?”

“won’t, if he has the chance, turn on me? yes, i venture still t

o think
it. at all events, i want to try. get off with his sister as soon as
possible and leave me with him alone.” i was amazed, myself, at the
spirit i had still in reserve, and therefore perhaps a trifle the more
disconcerted at the way in which, in spite of this fine example of it,
she hesitated. “there’s one thing, of course,” i went on: “they mustn’t,
before she goes, see each other for three seconds.” then it came over me
that, in spite of flora’s presumable sequestration from the instant of
her return from the pool, it might already be too late. “do you mean,” i
anxiously asked, “that they have met?”

at this she quite flushed. “ah, miss, i’m not such a fool as that! if
i’ve been obliged to leave her three or four times, it has been each
time with one of the maids, and at present, though she’s alone, she’s
locked in safe. and yet--and yet!” there were too many things.

“and yet what?”

“well, are you so sur

 of course--it occurs to me--to remember. my letter, giving the
alarm, will have reached town before you.”

i now perceived still more how she had been beating about the bush and
how weary at last it had made her. “your letter won’t have got there.
your letter never went.”

“what then became of it?”

“goodness knows! master miles--”

“do you mean he took it?” i gasped.

she hung fire, but she overcame her reluctance. “i mean that i saw
yesterday, when i came back with miss flora, that it wasn’t where you
had put it. later in the evening i had the chance to question luke, and
he declared that he had neither noticed nor touched it.” we could only
exchange, on this, one of our deeper mutual soundings, and it was mrs.
grose who first brought up the plumb with an almost elated “you see!”

“yes, i see that if miles took it instead he probably will have read it
and destroyed it.”

“and don’t you see anything else?”

i faced her a moment with a sad smile. “

hat manner, for the next hour or two, all over the place
and looked, i have no doubt, as if i were ready for any onset. so, for
the benefit of whom it might concern, i paraded with a sick heart.

the person it appeared least to concern proved to be, till dinner,
little miles himself. my perambulations had given me, meanwhile, no
glimpse of him, but they had tended to make more public the change
taking place in our relation as a consequence of his having at the
piano, the day before, kept me, in flora’s interest, so beguiled and
befooled. the stamp of publicity had of course been fully given by her
confinement and departure, and the change itself was now ushered in
by our nonobservance of the regular custom of the schoolroom. he had
already disappeared when, on my way down, i pushed open his door, and
i learned below that he had breakfasted--in the presence of a couple of
the maids--with mrs. grose and his sister. he had then gone out, as he
said, for a stroll; than which nothing, i reflec

the roast mutton was on the table, and i had dispensed with attendance.
miles, before he sat down, stood a moment with his hands in his pockets
and looked at the joint, on which he seemed on the point of passing some
humorous judgment. but what he presently produced was: “i say, my dear,
is she really very awfully ill?”

“little flora? not so bad but that she’ll presently be better. london
will set her up. bly had ceased to agree with her. come here and take
your mutton.”

he alertly obeyed me, carried the plate carefully to his seat, and,
when he was established, went on. “did bly disagree with her so terribly
suddenly?”

“not so suddenly as you might think. one had seen it coming on.”

“then why didn’t you get her off before?”

“before what?”

“before she became too ill to travel.”

i found myself

 impulse flame up to convert the climax
of his dismay into the very proof of his liberation. “no more, no
more, no more!” i shrieked, as i tried to press him against me, to my
visitant.

“is she here?” miles panted as he caught with his sealed eyes the
direction of my words. then as his strange “she” staggered me and, with
a gasp, i echoed it, “miss jessel, miss jessel!” he with a sudden fury
gave me back.

i seized, stupefied, his supposition--some sequel to what we had done to
flora, but this made me only want to show him that it was better still
than that. “it’s not miss jessel! but it’s at the window--straight
before us. it’s there--the coward horror, there for the last time!”

at this, after a second in which his head made the movement of a baffled
dog’s on a scent and then gave a frantic little shake for air and light,
he was at me in a white rage, bewildered, glaring vainly over the place
and missing wholly, though it now, to my sense, filled the room like
