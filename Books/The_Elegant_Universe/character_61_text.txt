even in the midst
of some of the greatest scientific achievements in historyâ€”physicists have been quietly aware of a
dark cloud looming on a distant horizon. the problem is this: there are two foundational pillars upon
which modern physics rests. one is albert einstein's general relativity, which provides a theoretical
framework for understanding the universe on the largest of scales: stars, galaxies, clusters of galaxies,
and beyond to the immense expanse of the universe itself. the other is quantum mechanics, which
provides a theoretical framework for understanding the universe on the smallest of scales: molecules,
atoms,  and  all  the  way  down  to  subatomic  particles  like  electrons  and  quarks.  through  years  of
research,  physicists  have  experimentally  confirmed  to  almost  unimaginable  accuracy  virtually  all
predictions  made  by  each  of  these  theories.  but  these  same  theoretical  tools  inexorably  lead  to
another  disturbing  conclusion:  as  they  are  currently  for

  depths  of  a  black  hole  an  enormous  mass  is
crushed to a minuscule size. at the moment of the big bang the whole of the universe erupted from a
microscopic nugget whose size makes a grain of sand look colossal. these are realms that are tiny
and  yet  incredibly  massive,  therefore  requiring  that  both  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity
simultaneously be brought to bear. for reasons that will become increasingly clear as we proceed,
the equations of general relativity and quantum mechanics, when combined, begin to shake, rattle, and
gush  with  steam  like  a  red-lined  automobile.  put  less  figuratively,  well-posed  physical  questions
elicit nonsensical answers from the unhappy amalgam of these two theories. even if you are willing
to keep the deep interior of a black hole and the beginning of the universe shrouded in mystery, you
can't help feeling that the hostility between quantum mechanics and general relativity cries out for a
deeper  level  of  understanding.  can  it

  really  be  that  the  universe  at  its  most  fundamental  level  is
divided, requiring one set of laws when things are large and a different, incompatible set when things
are small?

superstring theory, a young upstart compared with the venerable edifices of quantum mechanics
and  general  relativity,  answers  with  a  resounding  no.  intense  research  over  the  past  decade  by
physicists and mathematicians around the world has revealed that this new approach to describing

matter  at  its  most  fundamental  level  resolves  the  tension  between  general  relativity  and  quantum
mechanics. in fact, superstring theory shows more: within this new framework, general relativity and
quantum  mechanics require  one  another  for  the  theory  to  make  sense.  ac

because these features of string theory require that we drastically change our understanding of
space, time, and matter, they will take some time to get used to, to sink in at a comfortable level. but
as shall become clear, when seen in its proper context, string theory emerges as a dramatic yet natural
outgrowth of the revolutionary discoveries of physics during the past hundred years. in fact, we shall
see that the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics is actually not the first, but the
third in a sequence of pivotal conflicts encountered during the past century, each of whose resolution
has resulted in a stunning revision of our understanding of the universe.

the three conflicts

the first conflict, recognized as far back as the late 1800s, concerns puzzling properties of the motion
of light. briefly put, according to isaac newton's laws of motion, if you run fast enough you can catch
up  with  a  departing  beam  of  light,  whereas  accor

therefore, can no longer to be thought of as an inert backdrop on which the events of the universe play
themselves  out;  rather,  through  special  and  then  general  relativity,  they  are  intimate  players  in  the
events themselves.

once again the pattern repeated itself: the discovery of general relativity, while resolving one
conflict, led to another. over the course of the three decades beginning in 1900, physicists developed
quantum mechanics (discussed in chapter 4) in response to a number of glaring problems that arose
when  nineteenth-century  conceptions  of  physics  were  applied  to  the  microscopic  world.  and  as
mentioned  above,  the  third  and  deepest  conflict  arises  from  the  incompatibility  between  quantum
mechanics and general relativity. as we will see in chapter 5, the gently curving geometrical form of
space  emerging  from  general  relativity  is  at  loggerheads  with  the  frantic,  roiling,  microsco

behavior of the universe implied by quantum mechanics. as it was not until the mid-1980s that string
theory  offered  a  resolution,  this  conflict  is  rightly  called  the  central  problem  of  modern  physics.
moreover, building on special and general relativity, string theory requires its own severe revamping
of our conceptions of space and time. for example, most of us take for granted that our universe has
three spatial dimensions. but this is not so according to string theory, which claims that our universe
has many more dimensions than m

€”gravity and electromagnetismâ€”deeply troubling. einstein did
not accept that nature is founded on such an extravagant design. this launched his thirty-year voyage
in search of the so-called unified field theory that he hoped would show that these two forces are
really manifestations of one grand underlying principle. this quixotic quest isolated einstein from the
mainstream  of  physics,  which,  understandably,  was  far  more  excited  about  delving  into  the  newly
emerging framework of quantum mechanics. he wrote to a friend in the early 1940s, "i have become a
lonely  old  chap  who  is  mainly  known  because  he  doesn't  wear  socks  and  who  is  exhibited  as  a
curiosity on special occasions."3

einstein was simply ahead of his time. more than half a century later, his dream of a unified
theory  has  become  the  holy  grail  of  modern  physics.  and  a  sizeable  part  of  the  physics  and
mathematics  community  is  becoming  increasingly  convinced  that  string  theory  may  provi

 the heart and the soul of darkness, the
german  physicist  max  planck  shed  the  first  ray  of  light  on  quantum  mechanics,  a  conceptual
framework that proclaims, among other things, that the h-bar experiences of george and gracieâ€”
when  scaled  down  to  the  microscopic  realmâ€”need  not  be  attributed  to  clouded  faculties.  such
unfamiliar  and  bizarre  happenings  are  typical  of  how  our  universe,  on  extremely  small  scales,
actually behaves.

the quantum framework

quantum mechanics is a conceptual framework for understanding the microscopic properties of the
universe.  and  just  as  special  relativity  and  general  relativity  require  dramatic  changes  in  our
worldview when things are moving very quickly or when they are very massive, quantum mechanics
reveals that the universe has equally if not more startling properties when examined on atomic and
subatomic distance scales. in 1965, richard feynman, one of the greatest practitioners of quantum
mechanics, wrote,

here was a time when the newspapers said that only twelve men understood the theory of
relativity. i do not believe there ever was such a time. there might have been a time when
only one man did because he was the only guy who caught on, before he wrote his paper.
but after people read the paper a lot of people understood the theory of relativity in one
way or other, certainly more than twelve. on the other hand i think i can safely say that
nobody understands quantum mechanics.1

although  feynman  expressed  this  view  more  than  three  decades  ago,  it  applies  equally  well
today. what he meant is that although the special and general theories of relativity require a drastic
revision of previous ways of seeing the world, when one fully accepts the basic principles underlying
them,  the  new  and  unfamiliar  implications  for  space  and  time  follow  directly  from  careful  logical
reasoning.  if  you  ponder  the  descriptions  of  einstein's  work  in  th

adequate  intensity,  you  willâ€”if  even  for  just  a  momentâ€”recognize  the  inevitability  of  the
conclusions  we  have  drawn.  quantum  mechanics  is  different.  by  1928  or  so,  many  of  the
mathematical formulas and rules of quantum mechanics had been put in place and, ever since, it has
been  used  to  make the most precise and successful numerical predictions in the history of science.
but in a real sense those who use quantum mechanics find themselves following rules and formulas
laid down by the "founding fathers" of the theoryâ€”calculational procedures that are straightforward
to carry outâ€”without really understanding why the procedures work or what they really mean. unlike
relativity, few if any people ever grasp quantum mechanics at a "soulful" level.

what are we to make of this? does it mean that on a microscopic level the universe operates in
ways so obscure and unfamiliar that the human mind, evolved over eons to c

familiar everyday scales, is unable to fully grasp "what really goes on"? or, might it be that through
historical  accident  physicists  have  constructed  an  extremely  awkward  formulation  of  quantum
mechanics  that,  although  quantitatively  successful,  obfuscates  the  true  nature  of  reality?  no  one
knows. maybe some time in the future some clever person will see clear to a new formulation that
will fully reveal the "whys" and the "whats" of quantum mechanics. and then again, maybe not. the
only thing we know with certainty is that quantum mechanics absolutely and unequivocally shows us
that a number of basic concepts essential to our understanding of the familiar everyday world fail to
have  any  meaning  when  our  focus  narrows  to  the  microscopic  realm.  as  a  result,  we  must
significantly modify both our language and our reasoning when attempting to understand and explain
the universe on atomic and subatomic scales.

in the following sec

tions we will develop the basics of this language and describe a number of
the remarkable surprises it entails. if along the way quantum mechanics seems to you to be altogether
bizarre  or  even  ludicrous,  you  should  bear  in  mind  two  things.  first,  beyond  the  fact  that  it  is  a
mathematically coherent theory, the only reason we believe in quantum mechanics is because it yields
predictions  that  have  been  verified  to  astounding  accuracy.  if  someone  can  tell  you  volumes  of
intimate details of your childhood in excruciating detail, it's hard not to believe their claim of being

your long-lost sibling. second, you are not alone in having this reaction to quantum mechanics. it is a
view held to a greater or lesser extent by some of the most revered physicists of all time. einstein
refused  to  accept  quantum  mechanics  fully. and  even

  niels  bohr,  one  of  the  central  pioneers  of
quantum  theory  and  one  of  its  strongest  proponents,  once  remarked  that  if  you  do  not  get  dizzy
sometimes when you think about quantum mechanics, then you have not really understood it.

it's too hot in the kitchen

the road to quantum mechanics began with a puzzling problem. imagine that your oven at home is
perfectly insulated, that you set it to some temperature, say 400 degrees fahrenheit, and you give it
enough  time  to  heat  up.  even  if  you  had  sucked  all  the  air  from  the  oven  before  turning  it  on,  by
heating its walls you generate waves of radiation in its interior. this is the same kind of radiationâ€”
heat and light in the form of electromagnetic wavesâ€”that is emitted by the surface of the sun, or a

however,  some  of  newton's  colleagues,  most  notably  the  dutch  physicist  christian  huygens,
disagreed  with  him  and  argued  that  light  is  a  wave.  the  debate  raged  but  ultimately  experiments
carried  out  by  the  english  physicist  thomas young  in  the  early  1800s  showed  that  newton  was
wrong.

a  version  of  young's  experimental  setupâ€”known  as 

the  double-slit  experimentâ€”is
schematically illustrated in figure 4.3. feynman was fond of saying that all of quantum mechanics can
be  gleaned  from  carefully  thinking  through  the  implications  of  this  single  experiment,  so  it's  well
worth discussing. as we see from figure 4.3, light is shone on a thin solid barrier in which two slits
are  cut.  a  photographic  plate  records  the  light  that  gets  through  the  slitsâ€”brighter  areas  of  the
photograph  indicate  more  incident  light.  the  experiment  consists  of  comparing  the  images  on
photographic plates that result when either or both of the

bring the lesson home. the photoelectric effect shows that light has particle properties. the double-
slit experiment shows that light manifests the interference properties of waves. together they show
that light has both wave-like and particle-like properties. the microscopic world demands that we
shed our intuition that something is either a wave or a particle and embrace the possibility that it is
both. it is here that feynman's pronouncement that "nobody understands quantum mechanics" comes to
the fore. we can utter words such as "wave-particle duality." we can translate these words into a
mathematical  formalism  that  describes  real-world  experiments  with  amazing  accuracy.  but  it  is
extremely hard to understand at a deep, intuitive level this dazzling feature of the microscopic world.

matter particles are also waves

in the first few decades of the twentieth century, many of the greatest theoretical physicists grappled
tirelessly to develop a mathematically sound

 and the evolution of probability waves, or as they came to be known,
wave  functions.  it  was  not  long  before  schrÃ¶dinger's  equation  and  the  probabilistic  interpretation
were being used to make wonderfully accurate predictions. by 1927, therefore, classical innocence
had been lost. gone were the days of a clockwork universe whose individual constituents were set in
motion at some moment in the past and obediently fulfilled their inescapable, uniquely determined
destiny. according to quantum mechanics, the universe evolves according to a rigorous and precise
mathematical formalism, but this framework determines only the probability that any particular future
will happenâ€”not which future actually ensues.

many find this conclusion troubling or even downright unacceptable. einstein was one. in one of
physics' most time-honored utterances, einstein admonished the quantum stalwarts that "god does not
play dice with the universe." he felt that probability was turning up in fundamental physics b

ads toward the left slit, but suddenly changes
course and heads through the right. it meanders back and forth, finally passing through the left slit. it
goes on a long journey to the andromeda galaxy before turning back and passing through the left slit
on its way to the screen. and on and on it goesâ€”the electron, according to feynman, simultaneously
"sniffs" out every possible path connecting its starting location with its final destination.

figure 4.10 according to feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics, particles must be viewed as
travelling  from  one  location  to  another  along  every  possible  path.  here,  a  few  of  the  infinity  of
trajectories for a single electron travelling from the source to the phosphorescent screen are shown.
notice that this one electron actually goes through both slits.

feynman showed that he could assign a number to each of these paths in such a way that their
combined  average  yields  exactly  the  same  result  for  the  probability  calculated  using 
 
 ___________________________
 
 the  wave-
function approach. and so from feynman's perspective no probability wave needs to be associated
with the electron. instead, we have to imagine something equally if not more bizarre. the probability
that the electronâ€”always viewed as a particle through and throughâ€”arrives at any chosen point on
the screen is built up from the combined effect of every possible way of getting there. this is known
as feynman's "sum-over-paths" approach to quantum mechanics.7

at this point your  classical  upbringing  is  balking:  how  can  one  electron simultaneously  take
different pathsâ€”and no less than an infinite number of them? this seems like a defensible objection,
but quantum mechanicsâ€”the physics of our worldâ€”requires that you hold such pedestrian complaints
in  abeyance.  the  result  of  calculations  using  feynman's  approach  agree  with  those  of  the  wave
function method, which agree with experiments. you must allow nature to dictate wh

ion. but for microscopic objects, feynman's
rule for assigning numbers to paths shows that many different paths can and often do contribute to an
object's motion. in the double-slit experiment, for example, some of these paths pass through different
slits, giving rise to the interference pattern observed. in the microscopic realm we therefore cannot
assert  that  an  electron  passes  through  only  one  slit  or  the  other.  the  interference  pattern  and
feynman's alternative formulation of quantum mechanics emphatically attest to the contrary.

just as we may find that varying interpretations of a book or a film can be more or less helpful in
aiding our understanding of different aspects of the work, the same is true of the different approaches
to  quantum  mechanics.  although  their  predictions  always  agree  completely,  the  wave  function
approach  and  feynman's  sum-over-paths  approach  give  us  different  ways  of  thinking  about  what's
going on. as we shall see later on, for some ap

plications, one or the other approach can provide an
invaluable explanatory framework.

quantum weirdness

by now you should have some sense of the dramatically new way that the universe works according
to quantum mechanics. if you have not as yet fallen victim to bohr's dizziness dictum, the quantum
weirdness we now discuss should at least make you feel a bit lightheaded.

even  more  so  than  with  the  theories  of  relativity,  it  is  hard  to  embrace  quantum  mechanics
viscerallyâ€”to  think  like  a  miniature  person  born  and  raised  in  the  microscopic  realm.  there  is,
though, one aspect of the theory that can act as a guidepost for your intuition, as it is the hallmark
feature  that  fundamenta

confined to ever smaller regions of space.

the uncertainty principle also gives rise to a striking effect known as quantum tunneling. if you
fire  a  plastic  pellet  against  a  ten-foot-thick  concrete  wall,  classical  physics  confirms  what  your
instincts tell you will happen: the pellet will bounce back at you. the reason is that the pellet simply
does not have enough energy to penetrate such a formidable obstacle. but at the level of fundamental
particles, quantum mechanics shows unequivocally that the wave functionsâ€”that is, the probability
wavesâ€”of the particles making up the pellet all have a tiny piece that spills out through the wall.
this means that there is a smallâ€”but not zeroâ€”chance that the pellet actually can penetrate the wall
and emerge on the other side. how can this be? the reason comes down, once again, to heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

the mathematics of quantum mechanics shows that the greater the energy barrier, the lower the

has the money to lend. you remember, though, that an old friend of yours works for an airline and you
implore him with the same request. again, he cannot afford to lend you the money but he does offer a
solution. the accounting system of the airline is such that if you wire the ticket payment within 24
hours of arrival at your destination, no one will ever know that it was not paid for prior to departure.
in this way you are able to claim your inheritance.

the accounting procedures of quantum mechanics are quite similar. just as heisenberg showed
that  there  is  a  trade-off  between  the  precision  of  measurements  of  position  and  velocity,  he  also
showed that there is a similar trade-off in the precision of energy  measurements  and how long one
takes  to  do  the  measurement.  quantum  mechanics  asserts  that  you  can't  say  that  a  particle  has
precisely such-and-such energy at precisely such-and-such moment in time. ever increasing precision
of energy measurements require e

at the energy a particle has can wildly fluctuate so long as this fluctuation is over a short enough
time scale. so, just as the accounting system of the airline "allows" you to "borrow" the money for a
plane  ticket  provided  you  pay  it  back  quickly  enough,  quantum  mechanics  allows  a  particle  to
"borrow"  energy  so  long  as  it  can  relinquish  it  within  a  time  frame  determined  by  heisenberg's
uncertainty principle.

tunneling is commonplace. but the probability rules of quantum mechanicsâ€”and, in particular, the
actual smallness of h in the real worldâ€”show that if you walked into a solid wall every second, you
would  have  to  wait  longer  than  the  current  age  of  the  universe  to  have  a  good  chance  of  passing
through it on one of your attempts. with eternal patience (and longevity), though, you couldâ€”sooner
or laterâ€”emerge on the other side.

deepest  level  of  understanding.  since  their  usual  domains  of  applicability  are  so  different,  most
situations  require  the  use  of  quantum  mechanics or  general  relativity,  but  not  both.  under  certain
extreme conditions, however, where things are very massive and very smallâ€”near the central point
of  black  holes  or  the  whole  universe  at  the  moment  of  the  big  bang,  to  name  two  examplesâ€”we
require both general relativity and quantum mechanics for proper understanding. but like the mixing
of fire and gunpowder, when we try to combine quantum mechanics and general relativity, their union
brings violent catastrophe. well-formulated physical problems elicit nonsensical answers when the
equations of both these theories are commingled. the nonsense often takes the form of a prediction
that  the  quantum-mechanical  probability  for  some  process  is  not  20  percent  or  73  percent  or  91
percent but infinity. what in the world does a

 probability greater than one mean, let alone one that is
infinite? we are forced to conclude that there is something seriously wrong. by closely examining the
basic properties of general relativity and quantum mechanics, we can identify what that something is.

the heart of quantum mechanics

when  heisenberg  discovered  the  uncertainty  principle,  physics  turned  a  sharp  corner,  never  to
retrace  its  steps.  probabilities,  wave  functions,  interference,  and  quanta  all  involve  radically  new
ways of seeing reality. nevertheless, a die-hard "classical" physicist might still have hung on to a
thread of hope that when all was said and done these departures would add up to a framework not too
distant from old ways of thinking. but the uncertainty principle cleanly and d

y principle
tells  us  that  from  a  microscopic  vantage  point  there  is  a  tremendous  amount  of  activity. and  this
activity gets increasingly agitated on ever smaller distance and time scales.

quantum accounting is essential to understand this. we saw in the preceding chapter that just as
you might temporarily borrow money to overcome an important financial obstacle, a particle such as
an electron can temporarily borrow energy to overcome a literal physical barrier. this is true. but
quantum mechanics forces us to take the analogy one important step further. imagine someone who is
a  compulsive  borrower  and  goes  from  friend  to  friend  asking  for  money.  the  shorter  the  time  for
which  a  friend  can  lend  him  money,  the  larger  the  loan  he  seeks.  borrow  and  return,  borrow  and
returnâ€”over and over again with unflagging intensity he takes in money only to give it back in short
order.  like  stock  prices  on  a  wild,  roller-coaster  day  on  wall  street,  the  amo

capable  of  dealing  with  this  microscopic
obstreperousness.  they  found  that  schrÃ¶dinger's  quantum  wave  equation  (mentioned  in  chapter  4)
was actually only an approximate description of microscopic physicsâ€”an approximation that works
extremely  well  when  one  does  not  probe  too  deeply  into  the  microscopic  frenzy  (either
experimentally or theoretically), but that certainly fails if one does.

the central piece of physics that schrÃ¶dinger ignored in his formulation of quantum mechanics is
special  relativity.  in  fact,  schrÃ¶dinger did  try  to  incorporate  special  relativity  initially,  but  the
quantum equation to which this led him made predictions that proved to be at odds with experimental
measurements of hydrogen. this inspired schrÃ¶dinger to adopt the time-honored tradition in physics
of divide and conquer: rather than trying, through one leap, to incorporate all we know about the
physical universe in developing a new theory, it is often far more profitable to ta
 
 ___________________________
 
  to  incorporate  quantum  mechanics  into  general
relativity we should seek a quantum field theory of the gravitational force, much as physicists have
discovered successful quantum field theories of the other three forces. over the years, such reasoning
has inspired a prodigious and distinguished group of physicists to follow this path vigorously, but the
terrain has proven to be fraught with danger, and no one has succeeded in traversing it completely.
let's see why.

general relativity vs. quantum mechanics

the usual realm of applicability of general relativity is that of large, astronomical distance scales. on
such  distances  einstein's  theory  implies  that  the  absence  of  mass  means  that  space  is  flat,  as
illustrated in figure 3.3. in seeking to merge general relativity with quantum mechanics we must now
change  our  focus  sharply  and  examine  the microscopic  properties  of  space.  we  illustrate  this  in
figure 5.1 by zooming in and sequentially magnifying ever smaller region

5.1, the structure of space retains the same basic form. reasoning from a purely classical standpoint,
we would expect this placid and flat image of space to persist all the way to arbitrarily small length
scales.  but  quantum  mechanics  changes  this  conclusion  radically. everything  is  subject  to  the
quantum  fluctuations  inherent  in  the  uncertainty  principleâ€”even  the  gravitational  field.  although
classical reasoning implies that empty space has zero gravitational field, quantum mechanics shows
that on average it is zero, but that its actual value undulates up and down due to quantum fluctuations.
moreover, the uncertainty principle tells us that the size of the undulations of the gravitational field
gets  larger  as  we  focus  our  attention  on  smaller  regions  of  space.  quantum  mechanics  shows  that
nothing likes to be cornered; narrowing the spatial focus leads to ever larger undulations.

uppermost  part  of  the  figure.  john  wheeler  coined  the  term quantum  foam  to  describe  the  frenzy
revealed by such an ultramicroscopic examination of space (and time)â€”it describes an unfamiliar
arena of the universe in which the conventional notions of left and right, back and forth, up and down
(and even of before and after) lose their meaning. it is on such short distance scales that we encounter
the fundamental incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. the notion of a
smooth  spatial  geometry,  the  central  principle  of  general  relativity,  is  destroyed  by  the  violent
fluctuations of the quantum world on short distance scales. on ultramicroscopic scales, the central
feature of quantum mechanicsâ€”the uncertainty principleâ€”is in direct conflict with the central feature
of general relativityâ€”the smooth geometrical model of space (and of spacetime).

would barely expand to the height of an average tree.

and  so  we  see  that  the  incompatability  between  general  relativity  and  quantum  mechanics
becomes apparent only in a rather esoteric realm of the universe. for this reason you might well ask
whether it's worth worrying about. in fact, the physics community does not speak with a unified voice
when  addressing  this  issue.  there  are  those  physicists  who  are  willing  to  note  the  problem,  but
happily go about using quantum mechanics and general relativity for problems whose typical lengths
far exceed the planck length, as their research requires. there are other physicists, however, who are
deeply unsettled by the fact that the two foundational pillars of physics as we know it are at their core
fundamentally  incompatible,  regardless  of  the  ultramicroscopic  distances  that  must  be  probed  to
expose the problem. the incompatibility, they argue, points to an essential flaw in our understanding

average they are about as long as the planck lengthâ€”that they appear pointlike even when examined
with our most powerful equipment.

yet  the  simple  replacement  of  point  particles  with  strands  of  string  as  the  fundamental
ingredients of everything has far-reaching consequences. first and foremost, string theory appears to
resolve the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics. as we shall see, the spatially
extended nature of a string is the crucial new element allowing for a single harmonious framework
incorporating both theories. second, string theory provides a truly unified theory, since all matter and
all forces are proposed to arise from one basic ingredient: oscillating strings. finally, as discussed

 suggested that string theory had failed in its initial attempt because physicists had
unduly constrained its scope. string theory is not just a theory of the strong force, they proclaimed; it
is a quantum theory that includes gravity as well.3

the  physics  community  did  not  receive  this  suggestion  with  unbridled  enthusiasm.  in  fact,
schwarz recounts that "our work was universally ignored."4 the path of progress was already littered
with numerous failed attempts to unite gravity and quantum mechanics. string theory had been shown
wrong in its initial effort to describe the strong force, and it seemed to many that it was senseless to
try to use the theory to pursue an even grander goal. even more devastating, subsequent studies during
the late 1970s and early 1980s showed that string theory and quantum mechanics suffered from their
own subtle conflicts. it appeared that the gravitational force had, once again, resisted incorporation
into the microscopic description of the universe.

ating string is determined by two things: the
precise manner in which it vibrates (more frantic patterns corresponding to higher energies) and the
tension of the string (higher tension corresponding to higher energy). at first, this description might
lead  you  to  think  that  by  taking  on  ever  gentler  vibrational  patternsâ€”patterns  with  ever  smaller
amplitudes and fewer peaks and troughsâ€”a string can embody less and less energy. but as we found
in chapter 4 in a different context, quantum mechanics tells us that this reasoning is not right. like all
vibrations or wavelike disturbances, quantum mechanics implies that they can exist only in discrete
units. roughly speaking, just as the money carried by a comrade in the warehouse is a whole number
multiple of the monetary denomination with which he or she is entrusted, the energy embodied in a
string vibrational pattern is a whole number multiple of a minimal energy denomination. in particular,

theory is the planck scale.

this raises a crucial question directly related to the goal of reproducing the particle properties
in tables 1.1 and 1.2: if the "natural" energy scale of string theory is some ten billion billion times
that of a proton, how can it possibly account for the far-lighter particlesâ€”electrons, quarks, photons,
and so onâ€”making up the world around us?

the answer, once again, comes from quantum mechanics. the uncertainty principle ensures that
nothing is ever perfectly at rest. all objects undergo quantum jitter, for if they didn't we would know
where  they  were  and  how  fast  they  were  moving  with  complete  precision,  in  violation  of
heisenberg's dictum. this holds true for the loops in string theory as well; no matter how placid a
string appears it will always experience some amount of quantum vibration. the remarkable thing, as
originally worked out in the 1970s, is that there can

however, it is possible that such a super-heavy vibrational string stateâ€”a relic from the big bangâ€”
did survive to the present. finding such particles, as we discuss more fully in chapter 9, would be a
monumental discovery, to say the least.

gravity and quantum mechanics in string theory

the unified framework that string theory presents is compelling. but its real attraction is the ability to
ameliorate  the  hostilities  between  the  gravitational  force  and  quantum  mechanics.  recall  that  the
problem in merging general relativity and quantum mechanics turns up when the central tenet of the
formerâ€”that  space  and  time  constitute  a  smoothly  curving  geometrical  structureâ€”confronts  the
essential feature of the latterâ€”that everything in the u

indicates the window of uncertainty in its position. this fact reflects our discussion of heisenberg's
uncertainty principle in chapter 4, in which we found that the margin of error incurred when using a
point  particle  as  a  probe  (we  focused  on  photon  probes  but  the  discussion  applies  to  all  other
particles) is about equal to the probe particle's quantum wave-length. in somewhat looser language,
the probing sensitivity of a point particle is smeared out by the jitteriness of quantum mechanics, in
much the same way that the precision of a surgeon's scalpel is compromised if he or she has hands
that  shake.  but  recall  that  in  chapter  4  we  also  noted  the  important  fact  that  a  particle's  quantum
wavelength is inversely proportional to its momentum, which, roughly speaking, is its energy. and so,
by increasing a point particle's energy, its quantum wavelength can be made shorter and shorterâ€”
quantum smearing can be decreased further and furtherâ€”and hence we can use it

ion between point particles and strands of string becomes manifest.
just as was the case for plastic pellets probing the surface features of a peach pit, the string's inherent
spatial extent prevents it from probing the structure of anything substantially smaller than its own size
â€”in  this  case  structures  arising  on  length  scales  shorter  than  the  planck  length.  somewhat  more
precisely, in 1988 david gross, then of princeton university, and his student paul mende showed that
when quantum mechanics is taken into account, continually increasing the energy of a string does not
continually increase its ability to probe finer structures, in direct contrast with what happens for a
point particle. they found that when the energy of a string is increased, it is at first able to probe
shorter-scale structures, just like an energetic point particle. but when its energy is increased beyond
the value required for probing structures on the scale of the planck length, the additional energy does

it's as if a string, unlike a point particle, has two sources of
smearing: quantum jitters, as for a point particle, and also its own inherent spatial extent. increasing a
string's energy decreases the smearing from the first source but ultimately increases the smearing from
the second. the upshot is that no matter how hard you try, the extended nature of a string prevents you
from using it to probe phenomena on sub-planck-length distances.

but the whole conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics arises from the sub-
planck-length properties of the spatial fabric. if the elementary constituent of the universe cannot
probe sub-planck-scale distances, then neither it nor anything made from it can be affected by the

supposedly disastrous short-distance quantum undulations. this is similar to what happens as we
draw our hand across a highly polished granite surface. although at a microscopic level the granite is
discrete,  grainy,  and  bumpy,  our  fingers  are  unable  to  detect  these

discreteness.  similarly,  since  the  string  has  spatial  extent,  it  also  has  limits  on  its  short-distance
sensitivity. it cannot detect variations on sub-planck-distance scales. like our fingers on granite, the
string  smears  out  the  jittery  ultramicroscopic  fluctuations  of  the  gravitational  field.  although  the
resulting  fluctuations  are  still  substantial,  this  smearing  smooths  them  out  just  enough  to  cure  the
incompatibility between general relativity and quantum mechanics. and, in particular, the pernicious
infinities (discussed in the preceding chapter) that arise in the point-particle approach to forming a
quantum theory of gravity are done away with by string theory.

an essential difference between the granite analogy and our real concern with the spatial fabric
is that there are ways in which the microscopic discreteness of the granite's surface can be exposed:

is discussion may leave you feeling dissatisfied. instead of showing that string theory tames the
sub-planck-length quantum undulations of space, we seem to have used the string's nonzero size to
skirt the whole issue completely. have we actually solved anything? we have. the following two
points will serve to emphasize this.

first, what the preceding argument implies is that the supposedly problematic sub-planck-length
spatial fluctuations are an artifact of formulating general relativity and quantum mechanics in a point-
particle framework. in a sense, therefore, the central conflict of contemporary theoretical physics has
been a problem of our own making. because we previously envisioned all matter particles and all
force particles to be pointlike objects with literally no spatial extent, we were obligated to consider
properties of the universe on arbitrarily short distance scales. and on the tiniest of distances we ran
into seemingly insurmountable problems. string theory tells us that we encounte

l sense, a limit to how finely our conventional
notion of distance can even be applied to the ultramicroscopic structure of the cosmos. the supposed
pernicious spatial fluctuations are now seen to have arisen in our theories because we were unaware
of  these  limits  and  were  thus  led  by  a  point-particle  approach  to  grossly  overstep  the  bounds  of

physical reality.

given  the  apparent  simplicity  of  this  solution  for  overcoming  the  problem  between  general
relativity and quantum mechanics, you might wonder why it took so long for someone to suggest that
the point-particle description is merely an idealization and that in the real world elementary particles
do have some spatial extent. this takes us to our second point. long ago, some of the greatest minds
in  theoretical  physics,  such  as  pauli,  heisenberg,  dirac,  and  feynman, did  suggest  that  nature's
constituents might not actually be points but rather small undulating "blobs" or "nuggets." they and
others found, how

like  viewing  the  world  through  glasses  that  are  too  weak  or  too  strong,  fine  sub-planckian
details that would be accessible to a point-particle probe are smeared together by string theory and
rendered harmless. and unlike the case with poor eyesight, if string theory is the ultimate description
of the universe, there is no corrective lens to bring the supposed sub-planck-scale fluctuations into
sharp focus. the incompatibility of general relativity and quantum mechanicsâ€”which would become
apparent only on sub-planck-scale distancesâ€”is avoided in a universe that has a lower limit on the
distances that can be accessed, or even said to exist, in the conventional sense. such is the universe
described  by  string  theory,  in  which  we  see  that  the  laws  of  the  large  and  the  small  can  be
harmoniously merged together as the supposed catastrophe arising on ultramicroscopic distances is
summarily done away with.

supersymmetry and superpartners

as we have emphasized, the concept of spin, although superficially akin to the image of a spinning
top, differs in substantial ways that are rooted in quantum mechanics. its discovery in 1925 revealed
that  there  is  another  kind  of  rotational  motion  that  simply  would  not  exist  in  a  purely  classical
universe.

this suggests the following question: just as ordinary rotational motion allows for the symmetry
principle of rotational invariance ("physics treats all spatial orientations on an equal footing"), could
it be that the more subtle rotational motion associated with spin leads to another possible symmetry of
the  laws  of  nature?  by  1971  o

turns, even this point-particle theory owes a great debt to string theory.

with the resurgence of superstring theory in the mid-1980s, supersymmetry has re-emerged in the
context  of  its  original  discovery.  and  in  this  framework,  the  case  for  supersymmetry  goes  well
beyond that presented in the preceding section. string theory is the only way we know of to merge
general relativity and quantum mechanics. but it's only the supersymmetric version of string theory
that  avoids  the  pernicious  tachyon  problem  and  that  has  fermionic  vibrational  patterns  that  can
account  for  the  matter  particles  constituting  the  world  around  us.  supersymmetry  therefore  comes

unresolved,  many  felt  that  the  major  questions  concerning  the  strong,  weak,  and  electromagnetic
forces had been answered.

the time was finally ripe to return to the grandest question of all: the enigmatic conflict between
general relativity and quantum mechanics. the success in formulating a quantum theory of three of
nature's forces emboldened physicists to try to bring the fourth, gravity, into the fold. having pursued
numerous  ideas  that  all  ultimately  failed,  the  mind-set  of  the  community  became  more  open  to
comparatively radical approaches. after being left for dead in the late 1920s, kaluza-klein theory

result in infinite probabilities. as we have discussed, string theory cures these infinities. but what we
have not as yet mentioned is that a residual, somewhat more subtle problem still remains. in the early
days of string theory physicists found that certain calculations yielded negative probabilities, which
are also outside of the acceptable range. so, at first sight, string theory appeared to be awash in its

â€”in fact, string theory has been hailed as the most important and exciting development in theoretical
physics since the discovery of quantum mechanics. this comparison is particularly apt because the
history of quantum mechanics teaches us that revolutions in physics can easily take many decades to
reach  maturity.  and  compared  to  today's  string  theorists,  the  physicists  working  out  quantum

  but  will  it  be  sufficient  to
overcome present hurdles and yield definitive, experimentally testable predictions? will the indirect
tests we have discussed above result in a true smoking gun for string theory? these questions are of
central concern to all string theorists, but they are also questions about which nothing can really be
said. only the passage of time will reveal the answers. the beautiful simplicity of string theory, the
way in which it tames the conflict between gravity and quantum mechanics, its ability to unify all of
nature's  ingredients,  and  its  potential  of  limitless  predictive  power  all  serve  to  provide  rich
inspiration that makes the risk worth taking.

these  lofty  considerations  have  been  continually  reinforced  by  the  ability  of  string  theory  to

to general relativity, to the size of a molecule, an atom, and in a final inexorable cosmic crunch to no
size at all. according to conventional theory, the universe began with a bang from an initial state of
zero size, and if it has enough mass, it will end with a crunch to a similar state of ultimate cosmic
compression.

but when the distance scales involved are around the planck length or less, quantum mechanics
invalidates the equations of general relativity, as we are now well aware. we must instead make use
of  string  theory. and  so,  whereas  einstein's  general  relativity  allows  the  geometrical  form  of  the
universe  to  get  arbitrarily  smallâ€”in  exactly  the  same  way  that  the  mathematics  of  riemannian
geometry allows an abstract shape to take on as small a size as the intellect can imagineâ€”we are led

anything from escaping its gravitational grip. this reasoning led roger penrose of oxford university
to speculate on a "cosmic censorship hypothesis" that allows these kinds of spatial irregularities to
occur only if they are deeply hidden from our view behind the shroud of an event horizon. on the
other hand, prior to the discovery of string theory, some physicists surmised that a proper merger of
quantum mechanics and general relativity would show that the apparent puncture of space is actually
smoothed outâ€”"sewn up," so to speakâ€”by quantum considerations.

with  the  discovery  of  string  theory  and  the  harmonious  merger  of  quantum  mechanics  and

you might well ask, what if such a tear should occur, and it just so happens that there are no
strings in the vicinity to shield it? moreover, you might also be concerned that at the instant in time
that a tear occurs, a stringâ€”an infinitely thin loopâ€”would provide as effective a barrier as shielding
yourself from a cluster bomb by hiding behind a hula hoop. the resolution to both of these issues
relies on a central feature of quantum mechanics that we discussed in chapter 4. there we saw that in
feynman's formulation of quantum mechanics, an object, be it a particle or a string, travels from one
location to another by "sniffing out" all possible trajectories. the resulting motion that is observed is
a combination of all possibilities, with the relative contributions of each possible trajectory precisely
determined by the mathematics of quantum mechanics. should a tear in the fabric of space occur, then

as those in figure 11.6. even if no strings seem to be near the tear when it occurs, quantum mechanics
takes account of physical effects from all possible string trajectories and among these are numerous
(infinite, in fact) protective paths that encircle the tear. it is these contributions that witten showed
precisely to cancel out the cosmic calamity that the tear would otherwise create.

cannot. but at low enough energiesâ€”large enough distancesâ€”these problems are not encountered,

black holes: a string/m-theory perspective

the preâ€“string theory conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics was an affront to
our visceral sense that the laws of nature should fit together in a seamless, coherent whole. but this
antagonism  was  more  than  a  towering  abstract  disjunction.  the  extreme  physical  conditions  that
occurred  at  the  moment  of  the  big  bang  and  that  prevail  within  black  holes cannot  be  understood

being equal to that of an average grain of dust, is quite tiny.) and so, physicists who speculated that

black hole entropy

for many years, some of the most accomplished theoretical physicists speculated about the possibility
of  space-tearing  processes  and  of  a  connection  between  black  holes  and  elementary  particles.
although such speculations might have sounded like science fiction at first, the discovery of string
theory, with its ability to merge general relativity and quantum mechanics, has allowed us now to
plant these possibilities firmly at the forefront of cutting-edge science. this success emboldens us to
ask  whether  any  of  the  other  mysterious  properties  of  our  universe  that  have  stubbornly  resisted
resolution for decades might also succumb to the powers of string theory. foremost among these is the
notion of black hole entropy. this is the arena in which string theory has most impressively flexed its
muscles, successfully solving a quarter-century-old pro

hawking  and  most  everyone  else  agreed  that  this  definitively  ruled  out  bekenstein's  suggestion.
instead, hawking was willing to accept that if matter carrying entropy is dropped into a black hole,
this entropy is lost, plain and simple. so much for the second law of thermodynamics.

this  was  the  case  until  hawking,  in  1974,  discovered  something  truly  amazing.  black  holes,
hawking announced, are not completely black. if one ignores quantum mechanics and invokes only
the laws of classical general relativity, then as originally found some six decades previously, black
holes  certainly  do  not  allow  anythingâ€”not  even  lightâ€”to  escape  their  gravitational  grip.  but  the
inclusion of quantum mechanics modifies this conclusion in a profound way. even though he was not
in possession of a quantum-mechanical version of general relativity, hawking was able to finesse a

calculations  unequivocally  established  that  this  truly  reflects  the  enormous  amount  of  disorder
embodied by a black hole.

but disorder of what? as we have seen, black holes appear to be terribly simple objects, so
what  is  the  source  of  this  overwhelming  disorder?  on  this  question,  hawking's  calculations  were
completely silent. his partial merger of general relativity and quantum mechanics could be used to
find the numerical value of a black hole's entropy, but offered no insight into its microscopic meaning.
for nearly a quarter of a century, some of the greatest physicists tried to understand what possible
microscopic properties of black holes could account for their entropy. but without a fully trustworthy
amalgam  of  quantum  mechanics  and  general  relativity,  glimpses  of  an  answer  may  have  been
uncovered, but the mystery remained unsolved.

precise positions and velocities of the constituents of the universe. instead, these classical properties
are replaced by quantum wave functions, which tell us only the probability that any given particle is

the downfall of laplace's vision, however, does not leave the concept of determinism in total

huge mass and small size leading to unimaginably large density invalidate the sole use of einstein's
classical theory and require that quantum mechanics be brought to bear as well. this leads us to ask,
what does string theory have to say about the spacetime singularity at the center of a black hole? this
is a topic of intense current research, but as with the question of information loss, it has not yet been
settled. string theory deftly deals with a variety of other singularitiesâ€”the rips and tears in space

the currently accepted scientific theory of creation declares that the universe experienced the
most  extreme  of  conditionsâ€”enormous  energy,  temperature,  and  densityâ€”during  its  earliest
moments. these conditions, as is by now familiar, require that both quantum mechanics and gravity be
taken into account, and hence the birth of the universe provides a profound arena for exercising the

rooted in the classical gravitational framework of general relativity, has completely broken down.

nature is telling us emphatically that under such conditions we must merge general relativity and
quantum mechanicsâ€”in other words, we must make use of string theory. currently, research on the
implications of string theory for cosmology is at an early stage of development. perturbative methods
can,  at  best,  give  skeletal  insights,  since  the  extremes  of  energy,  temperature,  and  density  require
precision  analysis. although  the  second  superstring  revolution  has  provided  some  nonperturbative
techniques,  it  will  be  some  time  before  they  are  honed  for  the  kinds  of  calculatio

what  the  more
complete framework for incorporating space and time may involve.

finding the correct mathematical apparatus for formulating string theory without recourse to a
pre-existing notion of space and time is one of the most important issues facing string theorists. an
understanding  of  how  space  and  time  emerge  would  take  us  a  huge  step  closer  to  answering  the
crucial question of which geometrical form actually does emerge.

will string theory lead to a reformulation of quantum mechanics?

the universe is governed by the principles of quantum mechanics to fantastic accuracy. even so, in
formulating theories over the past half century, physicists have followed a strategy that, structurally
speaking,  places  quantum  mechanics  in  a  somewhat  secondary  position.  in  devising  theories,
physicists often start by working in a purely classical language that ignores quantum probabilities,
wave functions, and so forthâ€”a language that would be perfectly intelligible to physicist

fact,  in  chapter  12  we  have  seen  this  procedure  in  action:  the  loop  processes  (see  figure  12.6)
incorporate quantum conceptsâ€”in this case, the momentary quantum-mechanical creation of virtual
string  pairsâ€”with  the  number  of  loops  determining  the  precision  with  which  quantum-mechanical
effects are accounted for.

the strategy of beginning with a theoretical description that is classical and then subsequently
including the features of quantum mechanics has been extremely fruitful for many years. it underlies,
for example, the standard model of particle physics. but it is possible, and there is growing evidence
that it is likely, that this method is too conservative for dealing with theories that are as far-reaching
as string theory and m-theory. the reason is that once we realize that the universe is governed by
quantum-mechanical principles, our theories really should be quantum mechanical from the start. we

that 

the duality translations often take a process, described in one of the five string theories, that is
strongly dependent on quantum mechanics (for example, a process involving string interactions that
would  not  happen  if  the  world  were  governed  by  classical,  as  opposed  to  quantum,  physics)  and
reformulate it as a process that is weakly dependent on quantum mechanics from the perspective of
one  of  the  other  string  theories  (for  example,  a  process  whose  detailed  numerical  properties  are

our understanding. for example, as cumrun vafa has said, "i think that a reformulation of
quantum mechanics which will resolve many of its puzzles is just around the corner. i think many
share the view that the recently uncovered dualities point toward a new, more geometrical framework
for  quantum  mechanics,  in  which  space,  time,  and  quantum  properties  will  be  inseparably  joined
together."5 and according to edward witten, "i believe the logical status of quantum mechanics is
going to change in a manner that is similar to the way that the logical status of gravity changed when

einstein  discovered  the  equivalence  principle.  this  process  is  far  from  complete  with  quantum
mechanics, but i think that people will one day look back on our epoch as the period when it began."6
with guarded optimism, we can envision that a reframing of the principles of quantum mechanics
within string theory may yield a more powerful formalism that is capable of giving us an

values dictate so much about the universe? as in the previous sections, we will have to surmount
numerous theoretical hurdles on the way to these goalsâ€”currently, the most prominent is achieving a
full nonperturbative formulation of string/m-theory.

but is it possible that even if we had an exact understanding of string/-m-theory, framed within a
new and far more transparent formulation of quantum mechanics, we could still fail in our quest to
calculate  particle  masses  and  force  strength?  is  it  possible  that  we  would  still  have  to  resort  to
experimental  measurements,  rather  than  theoretical  calculations,  for  their  values? and,  moreover,
might it be that this failing does not mean that we need to look for an even deeper theory, but simply
reflects that there is no explanation for these observed properties of reality?

one immediate answer to all these questions is yes. as e

and  the  challenges  these  developments  pose  to  our  previous  way  of  seeing  the  world  are
monumental: loops of strings and oscillating globules, uniting all of creation into vibrational patterns
that are meticulously executed in a universe with numerous hidden dimensions capable of undergoing
extreme contortions in which their spatial fabric tears apart and then repairs itself. who could have
guessed that the merging of gravity and quantum mechanics into a unified theory of all matter and all
forces would yield such a revolution in our understanding of how the universe works?

no  doubt,  there  are  even  grander  surprises  in  store  for  us  as  we  continue  to  seek  a  full  and
calculationally tractable understanding of superstring theory. already, through studies in m-theory,

6. during the development of the quantum theories of the three nongravitational forces, physicists
also  came  upon  calculations  that  gave  infinite  results.  in  time,  though,  they  gradually  realized  that
these  infinities  could  be  done  away  with  through  a  tool  known  as renormalization.  the  infinities
arising in attempts to merge general relativity and quantum mechanics are far more severe and are not
amenable  to  the  renormalization  cure.  even  more  recently,  physicists  have  realized  that  infinite
answers are a signal that a theory is being used to analyze a realm that is beyond the bounds of its
applicability. since the goal of current research is to find a theory whose range of applicability is, in
principle,  unboundedâ€”the  "ultimate"  or  "final"  theoryâ€”physicists  want  to  find  a  theory  in  which

is often meant in an approximate sense, indicating a length that is within a few orders of magnitude of
10â€“33 centimeters.

8. currently, in addition to string theory, two other approaches for merging general relativity and
quantum mechanics are being pursued vigorously. one approach is led by roger penrose of oxford

string theory, all three approaches are honing in on the same solution for merging general relativity

2. in case you are wondering why the possible uniform vibrational energies are whole number
multiples of 1/r, you need only think back to the discussion of quantum mechanicsâ€”the warehouse in
particularâ€”from  chapter  4.  there  we  learned  that  quantum  mechanics  implies  that  energy,  like
money,  comes  in  discrete  lumps:  whole  number  multiples  of  various  energy  denominations.  in  the
case of uniform vibrational string motion in the garden-hose universe, this energy denomination is
precisely  1/r,  as  we  demonstrated  in  the  text  using  the  uncertainty  principle.  thus  the  uniform
vibrational energies are whole number multiples of 1/r.
