he killed this one, anyway. he kills owls too. we never need to dig. no
one's dug in my lifetime. a lot of the burrows are lying empty, you know: rats, live
in one part, but the man kills them as well, when he can. we don't need
expeditions. there's better food here than anywhere else. your friends will be

happy living here."
     but he himself did not sound particularly happy and once again hazel felt
oddly perplexed. "where does the man--" he began. but he was interrupted.
     "i'm called strawberry. this is my doe, nildro-hain.* some of the best empty
burrows are quite close. i'll show you, in case your friends want to settle into
them. the great burrow is a splendid place, don't you think? i'm sure there can't
be many warrens where all the rabbits can meet together underground. the roofs
all tree roots, you know, and of course the tree outside keeps the rain from
coming through. it's a wonder the tree's alive, but it is."
     hazel suspected that strawberry's talking had the real purpos

e of preventing
his own questions. he was partly irritated and partly mystified.
     "never mind," he thought. "if we all get as big as these chaps, we shall do
pretty well. there must be some good food round here somewhere. his doe's a
beautiful creature, too. perhaps there are some more like her in the warren."
     strawberry moved out of the burrow and hazel followed him into another run,
leading deeper down below the wood. it was certainly a warren to admire.
sometimes, when they crossed a run that led upward to a hole, he could hear the
rain outside, still falling in the night. but although it had now been raining for
several hours, there was not the least damp or cold either in the deep runs or in
the many burrows that they passed. both the drainage and the ventilation were
better than he had been accustomed to.

 here and there other rabbits were on the
move. once they came upon acorn, who was evidently being taken on a tour of
the same kind. "very friendly, aren't they?" he said to hazel as they passed one
another. "i never dreamed we'd reach a place like this. you've got wonderful
judgment, hazel." strawberry waited politely for him to finish speaking and
hazel could not help feeling pleased that he must have heard.
     at last, after skirting carefully round some openings from which there was a
distinct smell of rats, they halted in a kind of pit. a steep tunnel led up into the
air. rabbit runs tend to be bow-shaped; but this was straight, so that above them,
through the mouth of the hole, hazel could see leaves against the night sky. he
realized that one wall of the pit was convex and made of som

e hard substance. he
sniffed at it uncertainly.
     "don't you know what those are?" said strawberry. "they're bricks; the stones
that men make their houses and barns out of. there used to be a well here long
ago, but it's filled up now -- the men don't use it any more. that's the outer side of
the well shaft. and this earth wall here is completely flat because of some man
thing fixed behind it in the ground, but i'm not sure what."
     "there's something stuck on it," said hazel. "why, they're stones, pushed into
the surface! but what for?"
     "do you like it?" asked strawberry.
     hazel
 
 ___________________________
 
 puzzled over the stones. they were all the same size, and pushed at
regular intervals into the soil. he could make nothing of them.
     "what are they for?" he asked again.
     "it's el-ahrairah," said strawberry. "a rabbit called laburnum did it, some
time ago now. we have others, but this is the best. worth a visit, don't you
think?"
     hazel was more at a loss than ever. he had never seen a laburnum and was

puzzled by the name, which in lapine is "poison tree." how could a rabbit be
called poison? and how could stones be el-ahrairah? what, exactly, was it that
strawberry was saying was el-ahrairah? in confusion he said, "i don't
understand."
     "it's what we call a shape," explained strawberry.
 
 ___________________________
 
 "haven't you seen one
before? the stones make the shape of el-ahrairah on the wall. stealing the king's
lettuce. you know?"
     hazel had not felt so much bewildered since blackberry had talked about the
raft beside the enborne. obviously, the stones could not possibly be anything to
do with el-ahrairah. it seemed to him that strawberry might as well have said
that his tail was an oak tree. he sniffed again and then put a paw up to the wall.
     "steady, steady," said strawberry. "you might damage it and that wouldn't do.
never mind. we'll come again some other time."
     "but where are--" hazel was beginning, when strawberry once more
interrupted him.
     "i expect you'll be hungry now. i know i am. it's going on raining all night, i'm
certain of that, but we can feed underground here, you know. and then you can
sleep in the great burrow, or in my place if you prefer. we can go back more
quickly than we came. there's a run that goes almost straight. actually, it pas

ses
across--"
     he chatted on relentlessly, as they made their way back. it suddenly occurred
to hazel that these desperate interruptions seemed to follow any question
beginning "where?" he thought he would put this to the proof. after a while
strawberry ended by saying, "we're nearly at the great burrow now, but we're
coming in by a different way."
     "and where--" said hazel. instantly strawberry turned into a side run and
called, "kingcup? are you coming down to the great burrow?" there was silence,
"that's odd!" said strawberry, returning and once more leading the way. "he's
generally there about this time. i often call for him, you know."
     hazel, hanging back, made a quick search with nose and whiskers. the
threshold of the burrow was covered with a day-old fall of soft soil from the roof
above. strawberry's prints had marked it plainly and there were no others
whatsoever.

er and seemed to be feeding as well. there was a smell
of greenstuff. evidently some kind of food was available underground, like the

threarah's lettuce. hazel stopped to speak to nildro-hain. she asked whether he
had gone as far as the well pit and the el-ahrairah of laburnum.
     "yes, we did," said hazel. "it's something quite strange to me, i'm afraid. but
i'd rather admire you and your friends than stones on a wall."
     as he said this, he noticed that cowslip had joined them and that strawberry
was talking to him quietly. he caught the words "never been near a shape" and a
moment later cowslip replied, "well, it makes no difference from our point of
view."
     hazel suddenly felt tired and depressed. he heard blackberry behind cowslip's
sleek, heavy shoulder and went across to him.
     "come out into the grass," he said quietly. "bring anyone else who'll come."
     at that moment cowslip turned to him and said, "you'll be glad of something
to eat now. i'll show you what we've got d

ad been walking over the ground
outside. that must have been what had awakened him.
     hazel lay in the warm, dark burrow with a delightful sense of security. he
could smell the man. the man could not smell him. all the man could smell was
the nasty smoke he was making. he fell to thinking of the shape in the well pit,
and then dropped into a drowsy half-dream, in which el-ahrairah said that it was
all a trick of his to disguise himself as poison tree and put the stones in the wall,
to engage strawberry's attention while he himself was getting acquainted with
nildro-hain.
     pipkin stirred and turned in his sleep, murmuring, "sayn lay narn, marli?" ("is
groundsel nice, mother?") and hazel, touched to think that he must be dreaming
of old days, rolled over on his side to give him room to settle again. at that
moment, however, he heard a rabbit approaching down some run close by.
whoever it was, he was calling -- and stamping as well, hazel noticed -- in an
unnatural way. the sound, as blackbe

rry had said, was not unlike birdsong. as he
came closer, hazel could distinguish the word.
     "flayrah! flayrah!"
     the voice was strawberry's. pipkin and blackberry were waking, more at the
stamping than the voice, which was thin and novel, not striking through their
sleep to any deep instinct. hazel slipped out of the burrow into the run and at
once came upon strawberry busily thumping a hind leg on the hard earth floor.

     "my mother used to say, 'if you were a horse the ceiling would fall down,'" said
hazel. "why do you stamp underground?"
     "to wake everyone," answered strawberry. "the rain went on nearly all night,
you know. we generally sleep right through the early morning if it's rough
weather. but it's turned fine now."
     "why actually wake everybody, though?"
     "well, the man's gone by and cowslip and i thought the flayrah ought not to li

about for long. if we don't go and get it the rats and rooks come and i don't like
fighting rats. i expect it's all in the day's work to an adventurous lot like you."
     "i don't understand,"
     "well, come along with me. i'm just going back along this run for nildro-hain.
we haven't got a litter at present, you see, so she'll come out with the rest of us."
     other rabbits were making their way along the run and strawberry spoke to
several of them, more than once remarking that he would enjoy taking their new
friends across the field. hazel began to realize that he liked strawberry. on the
previous day he had been too tired and bewildered to size him up. but now that
he had had a good sleep, he could see that strawberry was really a harmless,
decent sort of fellow. he was touchingly devoted to the beautiful nildro-hain; and
he evidently had moods of gaiety and a great capacity for enjoyment. as they
came up into

well, these mad rabbits probably dance in the moonlight or something."
     "i wouldn't be surprised," said hazel. "it would be just like them. let's ask
cowslip."
     "that's the only silly thing you've said so far. tell me, since we came here has
cowslip answered any question you've asked him?"
     "well, no -- not many."
     "try asking him where he dances in the moonlight. say 'cowslip, where--'"
     "oh, you've noticed that, too, have you? he won't answer 'where' anything.
neither will strawberry. i think they may be nervous of us. pipkin was right when

he said they weren't fighters. so they're keeping up a mystery to stay even with us.
it's best just to put up with it. we don't want to upset them and it's bound to
smooth itself out in time."
     "there's more rain coming tonight," said bigwig. "soon, too, i think. let's go
underground and see if we can get them to talk a bit more freely."
     "i think that's something we can only wait for. but i agree about going

bodies. gradually the talkative groups
settled into a contented silence, but no one seemed disposed to go to sleep.
rabbits are lively at nightfall, and when evening rain drives them underground
they still feel gregarious. hazel noticed that almost all his companions seemed to
have become friendly with the warren rabbits. also, he found that whenever he
moved into one group or another, the warren rabbits evidently knew who he was
and treated him as the leader of the newcomers. he could not find strawberry,
but after a time cowslip came up to him from the other end of the hall.
     "i'm glad you're here, hazel," he said. "some of our lot are suggesting a story
from somebody. we're hoping one of your people would like to tell one, but we
can begin ourselves, if you'd prefer."
     there is a rabbit saying, "in the warren, more stories than passages"; and a
rabbit can no more refuse to tell a story than an irishman can refuse to fight.

ld as much, but after a few moments realized
with surprise that their hosts were evidently less enthusiastic.
     "very nice," said cowslip. he seemed to be searching for something more to
say, but then repeated, "yes, very nice. an unusual tale."
     "but he must know it, surely?" muttered blackberry to hazel.
     "i always think these traditional stories retain a lot of charm," said another of
the rabbits, "especially when they're told in the real, old-fashioned spirit."

     "yes," said strawberry. "conviction, that's what it needs. you really have to
believe in el-ahrairah and prince rainbow, don't you? then all the rest follows."
     "don't say anything, bigwig," whispered hazel: for bigwig was scuffling his
paws indignantly. "you can't force them to like it if they don't. let's wait and see
what they can do themselves." aloud, he said, "our stories haven't changed in
generations, you know. after all, we haven't changed ourselves. our lives have

sturdy readiness.
     "what did you say? what's wrong?"
     "fiver's gone."
     "where's he gone?"
     "silf -- outside. it can only be silf. you know he wouldn't go wandering about in
the warren. he hates it."
     "he's a nuisance, isn't he? he's left this burrow cold, too. you think he's in
danger, don't you? you want to go and look for him?"
     "yes, i must. he's upset and overwrought and it's not light yet. there may be
elil, whatever strawberry says."
     bigwig listened and sniffed for a few moments.
     "it's very nearly light," he said. "there'll be light enough to find him by. well,
i'd better come with you, i suppose. don't worry -- he can't have gone far. but by
the king's lettuce! i won't half give him a piece of my mind when we catch him."
     "i'll hold him down while you kick him, if only we can find him. come on!"
     they went up the run to the mouth of the hole and paused together. "since our
friends aren't here to pu

the smell of blood attracts elil. you know that, don't you?"
     "yes, hazel. i'm sorry. will bigwig--"
     "and another thing," said hazel desperately. "what was it you were telling me
about cowslip? did you say he told fiver to be quiet?"
     "yes, hazel. fiver came into the warren and told us about the snare, and that
poor bigwig--"
     "yes, all right. and then cowslip--?"
     "cowslip and strawberry and the others pretended not to hear. it was
ridiculous, because fiver was calling out to everybody. and then as we were
running out silver said to cowslip, 'surely you're coming?' and cowslip simply
turned his back. so then fiver went up and spoke to him very quietly, but i heard

e slope. the rabbit
who was coming was running in a curious, headlong manner. once he ran
straight into a thick-stemmed thistle, knocking himself sideways and rolling over
and over. but he got up and came blundering on toward them.
     "is it the white blindness?" said buckthorn. "he's not looking where he's
going."
     "frith forbid!" said blackberry. "shall we run away?"
     "no, he couldn't run like that with the white blindness," said hazel. "whatever
ails him, it isn't that."
     "it's strawberry!" cried dandelion.
     strawberry came through the hedge by the crab-apple tree, looked about him
and made his way to hazel. all his urbane self-possession had vanished. he was
staring and trembling and his great size seemed only to add to his air of stricken
misery. he cringed before them in the grass as hazel waited, stern and
motionless, with silver at his side.
     "hazel," said strawberry, "are you going away?"
     hazel made no answer, but silver said sharply, "what's that to you?"

  "take me with you." there was no reply and he repeated, "take me with you."
     "we don't care for creatures who deceive us," said silver. "better go back to
nildro-hain. no doubt she's less particular."
     strawberry gave a kind of choking squeal, as though he had been wounded. he
looked from silver to hazel and then to fiver. at last, in a pitiful whisper, he said,
     "the wires."
     silver was about to answer, but hazel spoke first.
     "you can come with us," he said. "don't say any more. poor fellow."
     a few minutes later the rabbits had crossed the cart track and vanished into
the copse beyond. a magpie, seeing some light-colored object conspicuous on the
empty slope, flew closer to look. but

fiver's insight, blackberry's wits or
hazel's authority. when the rats came, buckthorn and silver had obeyed bigwig
and stood their ground. the rest had followed hazel when he roused them and,
without explanation, told them to go quickly outside the barn. later, hazel had
said that there was nothing for it but to cross the open pasture and under silver's
direction they had crossed it, with dandelion running ahead to reconnoiter.
when fiver said the iron tree was harmless they believed him.
     strawberry had had a bad time. his misery made him slow-witted and careless
and he was ashamed of the part he had played at the warren. he was soft and
more used than he dared admit to indolence and good food. but he made no
complaint and it was plain that he was determined to show what he could do and
not to be left behind. he had proved useful in the woodland, being better
accustomed to thick woods than any of the others. "he'll be all right, you know, if
we give him a chance," said hazel to bigwig by t

to be," replied bigwig, "the great dandy" -- for by their standards strawberry was
scrupulously clean and fastidious. "well, i won't have him brow-beaten, bigwig,
mind. that won't help him." this bigwig had accepted, though rather sulkily. yet
he himself had become less overbearing. the snare had left him weak and
overwrought. it was he who had given the alarm in the barn, for he could not
sleep and at the sound of scratching had started up at once. he would not let
silver and buckthorn fight alone, but he had felt obliged to leave the worst of it to
them. for the first t

like to copy it. it's a wonderful idea to have a place underground where everybody
can be together -- talk and tell stories and so on. what do you think? could it be
done?"
     bigwig considered. "i know this," he said. "if you make a burrow too big the
roof starts falling in. so if you want a place like that you'll need something to hold
the roof up. what did cowslip have?"
     "tree roots."
     "well, there are those where we're digging. but are they the right sort?"
     "we'd better get strawberry to tell us what he knows about the great burrow;
but it may not be much, i'm sure he wasn't alive when it was dug."
     "he may not be dead when it falls in either. that warren's tharn as an owl in
daylight. he was wise to leave when he did."
     twilight had fallen over the cornfield, for although long red rays still lit the
upper down, the sun had set below. the uneven shadow of the hedge had faded
and disappeared. there was a cool smell of moisture and approaching darkness. a

     "i don't know," replied hazel, "and neither does anyone else yet. we'll have to
wait until tomorow. holly may stop running, but i don't think bluebell will. now
let me alone to do this leg of buckthorn's."
     the wound was a great deal better and soon hazel fell asleep.
     the next day was as hot and cloudless as the last. neither pipkin nor
dandelion was at morning silflay; and hazel relentlessly took the others up to the
beech hanger to go on with the digging. he questioned strawberry about the great
burrow and learned that its ceiling, as well as being vaulted with a tangle of
fibers, was strengthened by roots going vertically down into the floor. he
remarked that he had not noticed these.
     "there aren't many, but they're important," said strawberry. "they take a lot of
the load. if it weren't for those roots the ceiling would fall after heavy rain. on
stormy nights you could sense the extra weight in the earth above, but there was
no danger."
     hazel and bigwig went

 underground with him. the beginnings of the new
warren had been hollowed out among the roots of one of the beech trees. it was
still no more than a small, irregular cave with one entrance. they set to work to
enlarge it, digging between the roots and tunneling upward to make a second run
that would emerge inside the wood. after a time strawberry stopped digging and
began moving about between the roots, sniffing, biting and scuffling in the soil
with his front paws. hazel supposed that he was tired and pretending to be busy
while he had a rest, but at length he came back to them and said that he had some
suggestions.
     "it's this way," he explained. "there isn't a big spread of fine roots above here.
that was a lucky chance in the great burrow and i don't think you can expect to
find it again. but, all the same, we can do pretty well

     "and what have we got?" asked blackberry, who had come down the run while
he was talking.
     "well, we've got several thick roots that go straight down -- more than there
were in the great burrow. the best thing will be to dig round them and leave
them. they shouldn't be gnawed through and taken out. we shall need them if
we're going to have a hall of any size."
     "then our hall will be full of these thick, vertical roots?" asked hazel. he felt
disappointed.
     "yes, it will," said strawberry, "but i can't see that it's going to be any the worse
for that. we can go in and out among them and they won't hinder anyone who's
talking or telling a story. they'll make the place warmer and they'll help to
conduct sound from above, which might be useful some time or other."
     the excavation of the hall (which came to be known among them as the
honeycomb) turned out to be something of a triumph for strawberry. hazel
contented himself with organizing the diggers and left it to strawberry to

 went on in shifts and the rabbits took it in
turns to feed, play and lie in the sun above ground. throughout the day the
solitude remained unbroken by noise, men, tractors, or even cattle, and they

began to feel still more deeply what they owed to fiver's insight. by the late
afternoon the big burrow was beginning to take shape. at the north end, the
beech roots formed a kind of irregular colonnade. this gave way to a more open
central space: and beyond, where there were no supporting roots, strawberry left
blocks of the earth untouched, so that the south end consisted of three or four
separate bays. these narrowed into low-roofed runs that led away into sleeping
burrows.
     hazel, much better pleased now that he could see for himself how the business
was going to turn out, was sitting with silver in the mouth of the run when
suddenly there was a stamping of "hawk! hawk!" and a dash for cover by the
rabbits outside. hazel, safe where he was, remained looking out past the shadow

as glad to see that holly was evidently in better spirits. he began to say
that he hoped he felt well enough to join the others, but holly soon interrupted
him with questions.
     "are there many of you?" he asked.
     "hrair," said bigwig.
     "all that left the warren with you?"
     "every one," replied hazel proudly.
     "no one hurt?"
     "oh, several have been hurt, one way and another."
     "never a dull moment, really," said bigwig.
     "who's this coming? i don't know him."
     strawberry came running down from the hanger and as he joined them began
to make the same curious dancing gesture of head and forepaws which they had
first seen in the rainy meadow before they entered the great burrow. he checked
himself in some confusion and, to forestall bigwig's rebuke, spoke to hazel at
once.
     "hazel-rah," he said (holly looked startled, but said nothing), "everyone wants
to stay in the new warren tonight: and they're all hoping that captain holly will
feel able to tell them what'

     "well, naturally, we all want to know," said hazel to holly. "this is strawberry.
he joined us on our journey and we've been glad to have him. but do you think
you can manage it?"
     "i can manage it," said holly. "but i must warn you that it will strike the frost
into the heart of every rabbit that hears it."
     he himself looked so sad and dark as he spoke that no one made any reply, and
after a few moments all six rabbits made their way up the slope in silence. when
they reached the corner of the wood, they found the others feeding or basking in
the evening sun on th

     "an idea we found on the way," said bigwig.
     "lying in a field," said bluebell. "it's all right, master, i'll be quiet while you're
speaking."
     "yes, you must," said holly. "soon no one will want jokes."
     almost all the rabbits had followed them down. the honeycomb, though big
enough for everybody, was not so airy as the great burrow and on this june
evening it seemed somewhat close.
     "we can easily make it cooler, you know," said strawberry to hazel. "in the
great burrow they used to open tunnels for the summer and close them for the
winter. we can dig another run on the evening side tomorrow and pick up the
breeze."
     hazel was just going to ask holly to begin when speedwell came down the
eastern run. "hazel," he said, "your -- er -- visitor -- your mouse. he wants to
speak to you."
     "oh, i'd forgotten him," said hazel. "where is he?"
     "up the run."
     hazel went up. the mouse was waiting at the top.

size, and although my ear was pouring with blood i was never really in danger. all
the same, they were too many for us, and we had to run. bluebell and i had just
got clear of the ditch when we realized that pimpernel was still there. he was ill,
as i told you, and he didn't wake in time. so after all he'd been through, poor
pimpernel was killed by rabbits. what do you think of that?"
     "i think it was a damned shame," said strawberry, before anyone else could
speak.
     "we were running down the fields, beside a little stream," holly went on.
"some of these rabbits were still chasing us and suddenly i thought, 'well, i'll
have one of them anyway.' i didn't care for the idea of doing nothing more than
just run away to save our skins -- not after pimpernel. i saw that this cowslip was
ahead of the others and out on his own, so i let him catch me up and then i
suddenly turned and went for him. i had him down and i was just go

 "you and your mouse. mind
you, we'd have found the place ourselves sooner or later, but not as soon as this."
     hazel could have pressed his chin glands for satisfaction, but he replied
merely, "we shan't need to go down the hill so much, after all." then he added,
"but, holly, you smell of blood, you know. it may be dangerous, even here. let's
go back to the wood. it's such a beautiful night that we can sit near the holes to
chew pellets and bluebell can tell us his story."
     they found strawberry and buckthorn on the bank; and when everyone was
comfortably chewing, with ears laid flat, bluebell began.

surprised, as a matter of fact, that i should be the first one of us to start thinking
about it. unless we can find the answer, then this warren's as good as finished, in
spite of all we've done."
     "why, how can that be, hazel?" said bigwig.
     "do you remember nildro-hain?" asked hazel.
     "she stopped running. poor strawberry."
     "i know. and we have no does -- not one -- and no does means no kittens and
in a few years no warren."
     it may seem incredible that the rabbits had given no thought to so vital a
matter. but men have made the same mistake more than once -- left the whole
business out of account, or been content to trust to luck and the fortune of war.
rabbits live close to death and when death comes closer than usual, thinking
about survival leaves little room for anything else. but now, in the eveni

nts to do that."
     "what we want is to get some does and bring them back here," said hazel.

"will that be difficult, do you think?"
     "i should have thought not," said holly. "big warrens are often overcrowded
and some of the rabbits can't get enough to eat. the young does get edgy and
nervous and some of them don't have any kittens on that account. at least, the
kittens begin to grow inside them and then they melt away again into their
bodies. you know this?"
     "i didn't know," said strawberry.
     "that's because you've never been overcrowded. but our warren -- the
threarah's warren -- was overcrowded a year or two back and a lot of the younger
does were re-absorbing their litters before they were born. the threarah told me
that long ago el-ahrairah made a bargain with frith. frith promised him that
rabbits were not to be born dead or unwanted. if there's little chance of a decent
life for them, it's a doe's privilege to take them back into her body unborn."

rn, discussing who would
be the most likely to survive the long journey, to arrive in good shape and to go
down well in a strange warren. bigwig, rejected on the grounds that he might
quarrel in strange company, was inclined to be sulky at first, but came round
when he remembered that he could go on looking after kehaar. holly himself
wanted to take bluebell but, as blackberry said, one funny joke at the expense of
the chief rabbit might ruin everything. finally they chose silver, buckthorn and
strawberry. strawberry said little, but was obviously very much pleased. he had
suffered a good deal to show that he was no coward and now he had the

satisfaction of knowing that he was worth something to his new friends.
     they started early in the morning, in the gray light. kehaar had undertaken to
fly out later in the day, to make sure they were going in the right direction and
bring back news of their progress. hazel and bigwig went with them to the
southern end of the hanger and watched as they

appear.
     it was a dismal welcome for the strangers. not even bluebell could find a
cheerful word. dandelion was inconsolable to think that he might have stopped
hazel breaking from the ditch. the meeting came to an end in a dreary silence
and a half-hearted silflay.
     later that morning holly came limping into the warren. of his three
companions, only silver was alert and unharmed. buckthorn was wounded in the
face and strawberry was shivering and evidently ill from exhaustion. there were
no other rabbits with them.

anyway, it woke you from a nightmare, if i know anything. you were thrashing
about and calling out for hazel. you poor old chap! what a miserable thing it is to
have happened! we must try to bear it as best we can. we've all got to stop
running one day, you know. they say frith knows all the rabbits, every one."
     "is it evening?" asked fiver.
     "not yet, no. but it's a fair time after ni-frith. holly and the others have come
back, you know. strawberry's very ill and they haven't any does with them -- not
one. everything's as bad as it could be. holly's still asleep -- he was completely
exhausted. he said he'd tell us what happened this evening. when we told him
about poor hazel, he said -- fiver, you're not listening. i expect you'd rather i
kept quiet."
     "blackberry," said fiver, "do you know the place where hazel was shot?"

make themselves at home in strange conditions and a place where everyone was
lost so poorly in his thoughts? they would die, perhaps, or wander away. he

buckled once more to the task of explaining that he was sure better times lay
ahead -- and as he did so, felt himself the least convinced of any.
     bigwig had sent acorn to see whether there was anyone still to come. acorn
returned to say that strawberry felt too ill and that he could find neither
blackberry nor fiver.
     "well, leave fiver," said bigwig. "poor fellow, he'll feel better by himself for a
time, i dare say."
     "he's not in his burrow, though," said acorn.
     "never mind," said bigwig. but the thought came to him, "fiver and
blackberry? could they have left the warren without telling anyone? if they have,
what will happen when the others get to know?" should he ask kehaar to go and
look for them while there was still light? 
 
 ___________________________
 
but if kehaar found them, what then?
they could not be compelled to return. or if they were, what good would that do,
if they wanted to be gone? at that moment holly began to speak and everyone
became quiet.
     "we all know we're in a mess," said holly, "and i suppose before long we shall
have to talk about what's best to be done. but i thought that first of all i ought to
tell you how it is that we four -- silver, buckthorn, strawberry and i -- have come
back without any does. you don't have to remind me that when we set out,
everyone thought it was going to be straightforward. and here we are, one rabbit
sick, one wounded and nothing to show for it. you're all wondering why."
     "no one's blaming you, holly," said bigwig.
     "i don't know whether i'm to blame or not," replied holly. "but you'll tell me
that when you've heard the story.

     "i said they should remember that we were representing another warren, even
if it was smaller than theirs. we thought of ourselves as their guests. and it was
only when i'd said that that i realized with a horrible shock that they thought of
us as their prisoners: or as good as prisoners, whatever they might call it.
     "well, i'd rather say no more about the end of that meeting. strawberry tried
all he could to help me. he spoke very well about the decency and comradeship
natural to animals. 'animals don't behave like men,' he said. 'if they have to fight,
they fight; and if they have to kill they kill. but they don't sit down and set their
wits to work to devise ways of spoiling other creatures' lives and hurting them.

direction. you know how you always do. the rain had stopped and we set out. but
it was a very hard journey back. we were exhausted long before the end -- all
except silver: i don't know what we'd have done without him. we went on for a
day and a night without any real rest at all. we all felt that the only thing we
wanted to do was to get back here as soon as we could. when i reached the wood
this morning i was just limping along in a bad dream. i'm not really much better
than poor old strawberry, i'm afraid. he never complained, but he'll need a long

rest and i rather think i shall, too. and buckthorn -- that's the second bad wound
he's had. but that's not the worst now, is it? we've lost hazel: the worst thing that
could have happened. some of you asked me earlier this evening if i would be
chief rabbit. i'm glad to know you trust me, but i'm completely done in and i
can't possibly take it on yet. i feel as dry and empty as an autumn puffball -- i feel
as though the wind could blow

simply by proving to themselves through their senses that this was
really hazel-rah. it was all he could do to stand up to the rough play. "i wonder
what would happen if i lay down under it?" he thought. "they'd kick me out, i
dare say. they wouldn't have a crippled chief rabbit. this is a test as well as a
welcome, even though they don't know it themselves. i'll test them, the rascals,
before i'm done."
     he pushed buckthorn and speedwell off his back and broke away to the edge
of the wood. strawberry and boxwood were on the bank and he joined them and
sat washing and combing himself in the sunrise.
     "we can do with a few well-behaved fellows like you," he said to boxwood.
"look at that rough lot out there -- they nearly finished me off! what on earth do
you make of us and how are you settling down?"
     "well, of course we find it strange," said boxwood, "but we're learning.
strawberry here has been helping me a great deal. we were just seeing how many
smells i could tell on the wind,

but that's something that'll only come slowly. the
smells are awfully strong on a farm, you know, and they don't mean much when
you live behind wire. as far as i can make out, you all live by smell."
     "don't take too many risks to begin with," said hazel. "keep near the burrows
-- don't go out alone -- all that sort of thing. and how about you, strawberry? are
you better?"
     "more or less," answered strawberry, "as long as i sleep a lot and sit in the sun,
hazel-rah. i've been terrified half out of my wits -- that's the bottom of it. i've had
the shivers and the horrors for days. i kept thinking i was back in efrafa."
     "what was it like in efrafa?" asked hazel.
     "i'd rather die than go back to efrafa," said strawberry, "or risk going
anywhere near it. i don't know which was worse, the boredom or the fear. all the
same," he added after a few moments, "there are rabbits there who'd be the same

     bigwig came up the run, put his head out of the hole and stopped in horror.
     "frith up a tree!" he said. "what a fearful smell! did you kill it, kehaar, or did
it die under a stone?"
     "you like, meester pigvig? i pring you nice liddle pit, ya?"
     "bigwig," said hazel, "go and tell all the others that we're setting off at
daybreak tomorrow. holly will be chief rabbit here until we get back and
buckthorn, strawberry and the farm rabbits are to stay with him. anyone else
who wants to stay will be perfectly free to do so."
     "don't worry," said bigwig, from the hole. "i'll send them all up to silflay with
kehaar. they'll go anywhere you like before a duck can dive."

his favor. he knew that they were afraid, for he was afraid himself.
indeed, he guessed that they, like himself, could not be free from the thought of
efrafa and its grim owsla. but working against this fear was their longing and
need to find more does and the knowledge that there were plenty of does in
efrafa. then there was their sense of mischief. all rabbits love to trespass and
steal and when it comes to the point very few will admit that they are afraid to do
so; unless (like buckthorn or strawberry on this occasion) they know that they
are not fit and that their bodies may let them down in the pinch. again, in
speaking about his secret plan, hazel had aroused their curiosity. he had hoped
that, with fiver behind him, he could lure them with hints and promises: and he
had been right. the rabbits trusted him and fiver, who had gotten them out of
sandleford before it was too late, crossed the enborne and the common, taken

racing back.
     "hazel-rah, i've been quite close to that wood you spoke of," he said, "and
there are two rabbits playing about on a patch of short grass just outside it."
     "i'll come and see," said hazel. "dandelion, you come, too, will you?"
     as they ran down the hill to the right of the track, hazel fairly skipped to
recognize the beech hanger. he noticed one or two yellow leaves and a faint touch
of bronze here and there in the green boughs. then he caught sight of buckthorn

and strawberry running toward them across the grass.
     "hazel-rah!" cried buckthorn. "dandelion! what happened? where are the
others? did you get any does? is everyone all right?"
     "they'll be here very soon," said hazel. "yes, we've got a lot of does and
everyone who went has come back. this is blackavar, who's come out of efrafa."
     "good for him," said strawberry. "oh, hazel-rah, we've watched at the end of
the wood every evening since you went. holly and boxwood are all right -- they're

     "you don't know these efrafans," said blackavar. "my mother used to tell me
what happened at nutley copse. it would be better to go now."
     "well, go on, then," answered hazel. "i'm not stopping you. and i'm not
leaving this warren. it's my home." he looked at hyzenthlay, heavy with young,
who was sitting in the mouth of the nearest hole and listening to the talk. "how
far do you think she'll get? and clover -- do we leave her or what?"

     "no, we must stay," said strawberry. "i believe el-ahrairah will save us from
this woundwort; and if he doesn't, i'm not going back to efrafa, i'll tell you that."
     "fill in the holes," said hazel.
     as the sun set, the rabbits fell to clawing and scrabbling in the runs. the sides
were hard with the hot weather. it was not easy to get started, and when the soil
began to fall, it was light and powdery and did little to block the holes. it was

they told tales on a sunny
evening by the beech trees, he could not clearly recall whether they were about
himself or about some other rabbit hero of days gone by.
     the warren prospered and so, in the fullness of time, did the new warren on
the belt, half watership and half efrafan -- the warren that hazel had first
envisaged on that terrible evening when he set out alone to face general
woundwort and try to save his friends against all odds. groundsel was the first
chief rabbit; but he had strawberry and buckthorn to give him advice and he had
learned better than to mark anyone or to order more than a very occasional wide
patrol. campion readily agreed to send some rabbits from efrafa and the first
party was led by none other than captain avens, who acted sensibly and made a
very good job of it.
     general woundwort was never seen again. but it was certainly true, as
groundsel said, that no one ever found his body, so it may perhaps be that, after
all, that extraordinary rabbit really did
