two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her, while a white man barked orders. the white
man had a yellow slicker. red hair appeared around the edges of his mets baseball cap. "is there a
doctor here?" he called to her, as she ran up.
"i'm dr. carter," she said. the rain fell in heavy drops, pounding her head and shoulders. the
red-halted man frowned at her. she was wearing cut-off jeans and a tank top. she had a
stethoscope over her shoulder, the bell already rusted from the salt air.
"ed regis. we've got a very sick man here, doctor."
"then you better take him to san jos‚," she said. san jos‚ was the capital, just twenty minutes
away by air.
"we would, but we can't get over the mountains in this weather. you have to treat him here."
bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic. he was a kid, no
older than eighteen. lifting away the blood-soaked shirt, she saw a big slashing rip along his
shoulder, and another on the leg.
"what happened to him?"

manuel said, "do you want lavage?"
"yes," she said. "after you block him."
she bent lower, probed the wound with her fingertips. if an earth mover had rolled over him,
dirt would be forced deep into the wound. but there wasn't any dirt, just a slippery, slimy foam.
and the wound had a strange odor, a kind of rotten stench, a smell of death and decay. she had
never smelled anything like it before.
"how long ago did this happen?"
"an hour."
again she noticed how tense ed regis was. he was one of those eager, nervous types. and
he didn't look like a construction foreman. more like an executive. he was obviously out of his
depth.
bobbie carter turned back to the injuries. somehow she didn't think she was seeing
mechanical trauma. it just didn't look right. no soil contamination of the wound site, and no crushinjury
component. mechanical trauma of any sort-an auto injury, a factory accident-almost always
had some component of crushing. but here there was none. instead,

t his feet. there were
flashing lights at the corners of the cross. the pilot corrected slightly and touched down on a
helipad. the sound of the rotors faded, and died.
grant sighed, and released his seat belt.
"we have to come down fast, that way," hammond said, "because of the wind shear. there is
often had wind shear on this peak, and . . . well, we're safe."
someone was running up to the helicopter. a man with a baseball cap and red hair. he threw
open the door and said cheerfully, "hi, i'm ed regis. welcome to isla nublar, everybody. and
watch your step, please."
a narrow path wound down the hill. the air was chilly and damp. as they moved lower, the mist
around them thinned, and grant could see the landscape better. it looked, he thought, rather like
the pacific northwest, the olympic peninsula.
"that's right," regis said. "primary ecology is deciduous rain forest. rather different from the
vegetation on the mainland, which is more classical rain forest. but this is a microclimate that o

l laughing as he saw a fifth and a sixth neck crane up above the palm trees. the
sauropods watched the people arrive. they reminded grant of oversize giraffes-they had the
same pleasant, rather stupid gaze.
"i take it they're not animatronic," malcolm said. "they're very lifelike."
"yes, they certainly are," hammond said. "well, they should be, shouldn't they?"
from the distance, they heard the trumpeting sound again. first one animal made it, and then
the others joined in.
"that's their call," ed regis said. "welcoming us to the island."
grant stood and listened for a moment, entranced.
"you probably want to know what happens next," hammond was saying, continuing down the
path. "we've scheduled a complete tour of the facilities for you, and a trip to see the dinosaurs in
the park later this afternoon. i'll be joining you for dinner, and will answer any remaining questions
you may have then. now, if you'll go with mr. regis . . ."
the group followed ed regis toward the nearest buildings. over

inuously with ammals-discouraging some with bark and thorns; poisoning others, and feeding
still others to advance their own reproduction, to spread their pollen and seeds. it was a complex,
dynamic process which she never ceased to find fascinating. and which she knew most people
simply didn't understand.
but if planting deadly ferns at poolside was any indication, then it was clear that the designers of
jurassic park had not been as careful as they should have been.
"isn't it just wonderful?" ed regis was saying. "if you look up ahead, you'll see our safari
lodge." ellie saw a dramatic, low building, with a series of glass pyramids on the roof. "that's
where you'll all be staying here in jurassic park."
grant's suite was done in beige tones, the rattan furniture in green jungle-print motifs. the room
wasn't quite finished; there were stacks of lumber in the closet, and pieces of electrical conduit on
the floor. there was a television set in the corner, with a card on top:

"it's not-"
"and i'll demonstrate its safety-"
"and i want you to put them tight back on that helicopter," gennaro said.
"can't," hammond said, pointing toward the clouds. "it's already leaving." and, indeed, the
sound of the rotors was fading.
"god damn it," gennaro said, "don't you see you're needlessly risking-"
"ah ah," hammond said. "let's continue this later. i don't want to upset the children."
grant turned, and saw two children coming down the hillside, led by ed regis. there was a
bespectacled boy of about eleven, and a girl a few years younger, perhaps seven or eight, her
blond hair pushed up under a mets baseball cap, and a baseball glove slung over her shoulder.
the two kids made their way nimbly down the path from the helipad, and stopped some distance
from gennaro and hammond.
low, under his breath, gennaro said, "christ."
"now, take it easy," hammond said. "their parents are getting a divorce, and i want them to
have a fun weekend here."

"hi, grandpa," she said. "we're here."
the tour
tim murphy could see at once that something was wrong. his grandfather was in the middle of
an argument with the younger, red-faced man opposite him. and the other adults, standing
behind, looked embarrassed and uncomfortable. alexis felt the tension, too, because she hung
back, tossing her baseball in the air. he had to push her: "go on, lex."
"go on yourself, timmy."
"don't be a worm," he said.
lex glared at him, but ed regis said cheerfully, "i'll introduce you to everybody, and then we
can take the tour."
"i have to go," lex said.
"i'll just introduce you first," ed regis said.
"no, i have to go."
but ed regis was already making introductions. first to grandpa, who kissed them both, and
then to the man he was arguing with. this man was muscular and his name was gennaro. the
rest of the introductions were a blur to tim. there was a blond woman wearing shorts, and a
man with a beard who wore jeans and a hawaiian shi

books.
"dinosaurs on the brain?" the bearded man said. "well, as a matter of fact, i have that same
problem."
"dad says dinosaurs are really stupid," lex said. "he says tim should get out in the air and
play more sports,"
tim felt embarrassed. "i thought you had to go," he said. "in a
minute," lex said.
"i thought you were in such a rush."
"i'm the one who would know, don't you think, timothy?" she said putting her hands on her
hips, copying her mother's most irritating stance.
"tell you what," ed regis said. "why don't we all just head on over to the visitor center and we
can begin our tour." everybody started walking. tim heard gennaro whisper to his grandfather, "i
could kill you for this," and then tim looked up and saw that dr grant had fallen into step beside
him.
"how old are you, tim?"
"eleven."
"and how long have you been interested in dinosaurs?" grant asked.
tim swallowed. "a while now," he said. he felt nervous to be talking to dr. grant. "we go to
museums sometimes, when i can tal

rannosaurus at the museum. was it 5027?"
"yes," tim said. "how'd you know?"
grant smiled. "they've been talking about fixing it for years. but now it may never happen."
"why is that?"
"because of what is taking place here," grant said, "on your grandfather's island."
tim shook his head. he didn't understand what grant was talking about. "my mom said it was
just a resort, you know, with swimming and tennis."
"not exactly," grant said. "i'll explain as we walk along."
now i'm a damned babysitter, ed regis thought unhappily, tapping his foot as he waited in the
visitor center. that was what the old man had told him him: you watch my kids like a hawk,
they're your responsibility for the weekend.
ed regis didn't like it at all. he felt degraded. he wasn't a damn babysitter. and, for that
matter, he wasn't a damned tour guide, even for vips. he was the head of public relations for
jurassic park, and he had much to prepare between now and the opening, a year away. just to

unhappy. creative people needed nurturing. they needed encouragement to do their best work.
he couldn't waste his time taking scientists on tours.
but that was the trouble with a career in public relations-nobody saw you as a professional.
regis had been down here on the island off and on for the past seven months, and they were still
pushing odd jobs on him. like that episode back in january. harding should have handled that.
harding, or owens, the general contractor. instead, it had fallen to ed regis. what did he know
about taking care of some sick workman? and now he was a damn tour guide and babysitter. he
turned back and counted the heads. still one short.
then, in the back, he saw dr. sattler emerge from the bathroom. "all right, folks, let's begin our
tour on the second floor."
tim went with the others, following mr. regis up the black suspended staircase to the second
floor of the building. they passed a sign that read:

halfway down the corridor they came to a glass partition marked with another sign:
underneath were more signs:
caution
teratogenic substances
pregnant women avoid exposure
to this area
danger
radioactive isotopes in use
carcinogenic potential
tim grew more excited all the time. teratogenic substances! things that made monsters! it
gave him a thrill, and he was disappointed to hear ed regis say, "never mind the signs, they're
just up for legal reasons. i can assure you everything is perfectly safe." he led them through the
door. there was a guard on the other side. ed regis turned to the group.
"you may have noticed that we have a minimum of personnel on the island. we can run this
resort with a total of twenty people. of course, we'll have more when we have guests here, but at
the moment there's only twenty. here's our control room. the entire park is controlled from here."

e were just two people inside, standing and talking.
"the man on the left is our chief engineer, john arnold"-regis pointed to a thin man in a
button-down short-sleeve shirt and tie, smoking a cigarette-"and next to him, our park warden,
mr. robert muldoon, the famous white bunter from nairobi." muldoon was a burly man in khaki,
sunglasses dangling from his shirt pockct. he glanced out at the group, gave a brief nod, and
turned back to the computer screens. "i'm sure you want to see this room," ed regis said, "but
first, let's see how we obtain dinosaur dna."
the sign on the door said extractions and, like all the doors in the laboratory building, it
opened with a security card. ed regis slipped the card in the slot; the light blinked; and the door
opened.
inside, tim saw a small room bathed in green light. four technicians in lab coats were peering
into double-barreled stereo microscopes, or looking at images on high resolution video screens.
the room was filled with yellow stones. the stones

look at its profile, and it screamed shrilly.
"she doesn't like that," regis said. "doesn't like to be held away from body contact. . . ."
the raptor was still screaming, but grant paid no attention. now he was squeezing the tail,
feeling the bones. regis said, "dr. grant. if you please."
"i'm not hurting her."
"dr. grant. these creatures are not of our world. they come from a time when there were no
human beings around to prod and poke them."
"i'm not prodding and-"
"dr. grant. put her down, " ed regis said.
"but-"
"now. " regis was starting to get annoyed.
grant handed the animal back to tim. it stopped squealing. tim could feel its little heart
beating rapidly against his chest.
"i'm sorry, dr. grant," regis said. "but these animals are delicate in infancy. we have lost
several from a postnatal stress syndrome, which we believe is adrenocortically mediated.
sometimes they die within five minutes."
tim petted the little raptor. "it's okay, kid," he said. "everything's fine now." the heart wa

beating rapidly.
"we feel it is important that the animals here be treated in the most humane manner," regis
said. "i promise you that you will have every opportunity to examine them later."
but grant couldn't stay away. he again moved toward the animal in tim's arms, peering at it.
the little velociraptor opened her jaws and hissed at grant, in a posture of sudden intense
fury.
"fascinating," grant said.
"can i stay and play with her?" tim said.
"not right now," ed regis said, glancing at his watch. "it's three o'clock, and it's a good time for
a tour of the park itself, so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for
them."
tim released the velociraptor, which scampered across the room, grabbed a cloth rag, put it in
her mouth, and tugged at the end with her tiny claws.

walking back toward the control room, malcolm said, "i have one more question, dr. wu. how
many different species have you made so far?"

u said. "i believe the number at the moment is fifteen. fifteen species.
do you know, ed?"
"yes, it's fifteen," ed regis said, nodding.
"you don't know for sure?" malcolm said, affecting astonishment.
wu smiled. "i stopped counting," he said, "after the first dozen. and you have to realize that
sometimes we think we have an animal correctly made-from the standpoint of the dna, which is
our basic work-and the animal grows for six months and then something untoward happens. and
we realize there is some error. a releaser gene isn't operating. a hormone not being released. or

ulty enzyme in protein metabolism. as a result, the animals cannot manufacture the amino acid
lysine. they must ingest it from the outside. unless they get a rich dietary source of exogenous
lysine-supplied by us, in tablet form-they'll go into a coma within twelve hours and expire. these
animals are genetically engineered to be unable to survive in the real world. they can only live
here in jurassic park. they are not free at all. they are essentially our prisoners."
"here's the control room," ed regis said. "now that you know how the animals are made, you'll
want to see the control room for the park itself, before we go out on the-"
he stopped. through the thick glass window, the room was dark. the monitors were off,
except for three that displayed spinning numbers and the image of a large boat.
"what's going on?" ed regis said. "oh hell, they're docking."
"docking?"
"every two weeks, the supply boat comes in from the mainland. one of the things this island
doesn't have is a good harbor, or

wu smiled. "i have often thought about that. i suppose it is a bit of a paradox. eventually, i
hope, paleontologists such as yourself will compare our animals with the fossil record to verify the
developmental sequence."
ellie said, "but the animal we just saw, the velociraptor-you said it was a mongoliensis?"
"from the location of the amber," wu said. "it it is from china."
"interesting," grant said. "i was just digging up an infant antirrhopus. are there any full-grown
raptors here?"
"yes," ed regis said without hesitation. "eight adult females. the females are the real hunters.
they're pack hunters, you know."
"will we see them on the tour?"
"no," wu said, looking suddenly uncomfortable. and there was an awkward pause. wu looked
at regis.
"not for a while," regis said cheerfully. "the velociraptors haven't been integrated into the park
setting just yet. we keep them in a holding pen,"
"can i see them there?" grant said.
"why, yes, of course. in fact, while we're waiting"-he glanced at his

 watch-"you might want to
go around and have a look at them."
"i certainly would," grant said. 
"absolutely," ellie said.
"i want to go, too," tim said eagerly.
"just go around the back of this building, past the support facility, and you'll see the pen. but
don't get too close to the fence. do you want to go, too?" he said to the girl.
"no," lex said. she looked appraisingly at regis. "you want to play a little pickle? throw a
few?"
"well, sure," ed regis said. "why don't you and i go downstairs and we'll do that, while we wait
for the control room to open up?"
grant walked with ellie and malcolm around the back of the main building, with the kid tagging
along. grant liked kids-it was impossible not to like any group so openly enthusiastic about
dinosaurs. grant used to watch kids in museums as they stared open-mouthed at the big
skeletons rising above them. he wondered what their fascination really represented. he finally
decided that children

sure the tour will make everything clear," malcolm said.

a line of toyota land cruisers came out of an underground garage beneath the visitor center.
each car pulled up, driverless and silent. two black men in safari uniforms were opening the
doors for passengers.
"two to four passengers to a car, please, two to four passengers to a car," a recorded voice
was saying. "children under ten must be accompanied by an adult

tim watched as grant, sattler, and malcolm got into the first land cruiser with the lawyer,
gennaro. tim looked over at lex, who was standing pounding her fist into her glove.
tim pointed to the first car and said, "can i go with them?"
"i'm afraid they have things to discuss," ed regis said. "technical things."
"i'm interested in technical things," tim said. "i'd rather go with them."
"well, you'll be able to hear what they're saying," regis said. "we'll have a radio open between
the cars."
the second car came. tim and lex got in, and ed regis followed. "these are electric cars,"
regis said. "guided by a cable in the roadway."
tim was glad he was sitting in the front seat, because mounted in the dashboard were two
computer screens and a box that looked to him like a cd-rom; t

controlled by a computer. there was also a portable walkie-talkie and some kind of a radio
transmitter. there were two antennas on the roof, and some odd goggles in the map pocket.
the black men shut the doors of the land cruiser. the car started off with an electric hum. up
ahead, the three scientists and gennaro were talking and pointing, clearly excited. ed regis said,
"let's hear what they are saying." an intercom clicked.
"i don't know what the hell you think you're doing here," gennaro said, over the intercom. he
sounded very angry.
"i know quite well why i'm here," malcolm said.
"you're here to advise me, not play goddamned mind games. i've got five percent of this
company and a responsibility to make sure that hammond has done his job responsibly. now
you goddamn come here-"
ed regis pressed the intercom button and said, "in keeping with the nonpol

osaka. eventually we hope to drive among the animals-just as they do in african game parks- but,
for now, sit back and enjoy the self-guided tour." he paused. "and, by the way, we can hear
you back here."
"oh christ," gennaro said. "i have to be able to speak freely. i didn't ask for these damned kids
to come-"
ed regis smiled blandly and pushed a button. "we'll just begin the show, shall we?" they
heard a fanfare of trumpets, and the interior screens flashed welcome to jurassic park. a
sonorous voice said, "welcome to jurassic park. you are now entering the lost world of the
prehistoric past, a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth, which you are
privileged to see for the first time." 
"that's richard kiley," ed regis said. "we spared no expense."
the land cruiser passed through a gro

 like an owl.
"they're pretty," lex said.
"dilophosaurus, " the tape said, "is one of the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs. scientists
thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill prey, and imagined they were primarily
scavengers. but now we know they are poisonous."
"hey." tim grinned. "all right."
again the distinctive booting call of the dilophosaur drifted across the afternoon air toward
them.
lex shifted uneasily in her seat. "are they really poisonous, mr. regis?"
"don't worry about it," ed regis said.
"but are they?"
"well, yes, lex."
"along with such living reptiles as gila monsters and rattlesnakes, dilophosaurus secretes a
hematotoxin from glands in its mouth. unconsciousness follows within minutes of a bite. the
dinosaur will then finish the victim off at its leisure-making dilophosaurus a beautiful but deadly
addition to the animals you see here at jurassic park."
the land cruiser turned a corner, leaving the river behind. tim looked back, hoping for a last
glimpse of the dilophos

aur. this was amazing! poisonous dinosaurs! he wished he could stop
the car, but everything was automatic. he bet dr. grant wanted to stop the car, too.
"if you look on the bluff to the right, you'll see les gigantes, the site of our superb three-star
dining room. chef alain richard hails from the world-famous le beaumanišre in france. make
your reservations by dialing four from your hotel rooms."
tim looked up on the bluff, and saw nothing.
"not for a while, though," ed regis said. "the restaurant won't even start construction until
november."
"continuing on our prehistoric safari, we come next to the herbivores of the ornithischian
group. if you look to your right, you can probably see them now."
tim saw two animals, standing motionless in the shade of a large tree. triceratops: the size
and gray color of an elephant, with the truculent stance of a rhino. the horns above each eye
curved five feet into the air, looking almost like inverted elephant tusks. a third, r

"triceratops have a fan-shaped crest behind their heads. it's made of solid bone, and it's very
strong. these animals weigh about seven tons each. despite their appearance, they are actually
quite docile. they know their handlers, and they'll allow themselves to be petted. they
particularly like to be scratched in the hindquarters."
"why don't they move?" lex said. she rolled down her window. "hey! stupid dinosaur! move!"
"don't bother the animals, lex," ed regis said.
"why? it's stupid. they just sit there like a picture in a book," lex said.
the voice was saying, "-easygoing monsters from a bygone world stand in sharp contrast to
what we will see next. the most famous predator in the history of the world: the mighty tyrant
lizard, known as tyrannosaurus rex."
"good, tyrannosaurus rex, " tim said.
"i hope he's better than these bozos," lex said, turning away from the triceratops.

 jurassic park was bathed in soft light, with lengthening shadows. the
surface of the lagoon rippled in pink crescents. farther south, they saw the graceful necks of the
camarasaurs, standing at the water's edge, their bodies mirrored in the moving surface. it was
quiet, except for the soft drone of cicadas. as they stared out at that landscape, it was possible to
believe that they had really been transported millions of years back in time to a vanished world.
"it works, doesn't it?" they heard ed regis say, over the intercom. "i like to come here
sometimes, in the evening. and just sit."
grant was unimpressed. "where is t-rex?"
"good question. you often see the little one down in the lagoon. the lagoon's stocked, so we
have fish in there. the little one has learned to catch the fish. interesting how he does it. he
doesn't use his hands, but he ducks his whole head under the water. like a bird."
"the little one?"
"the little t-rex. he's a juvenile, two years old, and about a third grown now. s

muldoon moved past the jeep, toward the back. the steel door to the armaments room was
unmarked. he unlocked it with his key, and swung the heavy door wide. gun racks lined the
interior. he pulled out a randler shoulder launcher and a case of canisters. he tucked two gray
rockets under his other arm.
after locking the door behind him, he put the gun into the back seat of the jeep. as he left the
garage, he heard the distant rumble of thunder. 
"looks like rain," ed regis said, glancing up at the sky.
the land cruisers had stopped again, near the sauropod swamp. a large herd of apatosaurs
was grazing at the edge of the lagoon, eating the leaves of the upper branches of the palm trees.
in the same area were several duckbilled hadrosaurs, which in comparison looked much smaller.
of course, tim knew the hadrosaurs weren't really small. it was only that the apatosaurs were
so much larger. their tiny heads reached fifty feet into the air, extending out on their long

necks.
"the big animals you see are commonly called brontosaurus, " the recording said, "but they
are actually apatosaurus. they weigh more than thirty tons. that means a single animal is as big
as a whole herd of modern elephants. and you may notice that their preferred area, alongside the
lagoon, is not swampy. despite what the books say, brontosaurs avoid swamps. they prefer dry
land."
"brontosaurus is the biggest dinosaur, lex," ed regis said. tim didn't bother to contradict him.
actually, brachiosaurus was three times as large. and some people thought ultrasaurus and
seismosaurus were even larger than brachiosaurus. seismosaurus might have weighed a
hundred tons!
alongside the apatosaurs, the smaller hadrosaurs stood on their hind legs to get at foliage.
they moved gracefully for such large creatures. several infant hadrosaurs scampered around the
adults, eating the leaves that dropped from the mouths of the larger animals.

he dinosaurs of jurassic park don't breed," the recording said. "the young animals you see
were introduced a few months ago, already hatched. but the adults nurture them anyway."
there was the rolling growl of thunder. the sky was darker, lower, and menacing.
"yeah, looks like rain, all right," ed regis said.
the car started forward, and tim looked back at the hadrosaurs. suddenly, off to one side, he
saw a pale yellow animal moving quickly. there were brownish stripes on its back. he recognized
it instantly. "hey!" he shouted. "stop the car!"
:'what is it?" ed regis said.
'quick! stop the car!"
"we move on now to see the last of our great prehistoric animals, the stegosaurs," the
recorded voice said.
"what's the matter, tim?"
"i saw one! i saw one in the field out there!"
"saw what?"
"a rapto

r! in that field!"
"the stegosaurs are a mid-jurassic animal, evolving about a hundred and seventy million
years ago," the recording said. "several of these remarkable herbivores live here at jurassic
park-"
"oh, i don't think so, tim," ed regis said. "not a raptor."
"i did! stop the car!"
there was a babble on the intercom, as the news was relayed to grant and malcolm. "tim
says he saw a raptor."
"where?"
"back at the field."
"let's go back and look."
"we can't go back," ed regis said. "we can only go forward. the cars are programmed."
"we can't go back?" grant said.
"no," regis said. "sorry, you see, it's kind of a ride-"
"tim, this is professor malcolm," said a voice cutting in on the intercom. "i have just one
question for you about this raptor. how old would you say it was?"
"older than the baby we saw today," tim said. "and younger than the big adults in the pen.
the adults were six feet tall. this one was about half that size."
"that's fine," malcolm said.
"i only

 saw it for a second," tim said.
"i'm sure it wasn't a raptor," ed regis said. "it couldn't possibly be a raptor. must have been
one of the othys. they're always jumping their fences. we have a hell of a time with them."
"i know i saw a raptor," tim said.
"i'm hungry," lex said. she was starting to whine. 
in the control room, arnold turned to wu. "what do you think the kid saw?"
"i think it must have been an otby."
arnold nodded. "we have trouble tracking otbys, because they spend so much time in the
trees." the otbys were an exception to the usual minute-to-minute

ls are killed, or dead from natural
causes, or whether they have left the island."
"no," grant said, "but it's a start. and i think we can get more information from an intensive
look at the population graphs."
"how are we going to find these nests?"
"actually," grant said, "i think the computer will be able to help us with that."
"can we go back now?" lex said. "i'm hungry."
"yes, let's go," grant said, smiling at her. "you've been very patient."
"you'll be able to eat in about twenty minutes," ed regis said, starting toward the two land
cruisers.
"i'll stay for a while," ellie said, "and get photos of the stego with dr. harding's camera. those
vesicles in the mouth will have cleared up by tomorrow."
"i want to get back," grant said. "i'll go with the kids." "i
will, too," malcolm said.
"i think i'll stay," gennaro said, "and go back with harding in his jeep, with dr. sattler."
"fine, let's go."
they started walking. malcolm said, "why exactly is our lawyer staying?"
grant shrugged. "i think i

t might have something to do with dr. sattler."
"really? the shorts, you think?"
"it's happened before," grant said.
when they came to the land cruisers, tim said, "i want to ride in the front one this time, with
dr. grant."
malcolm said, "unfortunately, dr. grant and i need to talk." "i'll
just sit and listen. i won't say anything," tim said. "it's a private
conversation," malcolm said. 
"tell you what, tim," ed regis said. "let them sit in the rear car by themselves. we'll sit in the
front car, and you can use the night-vision goggles. have you ever used night-vision goggles,
tim? they're goggles with very sensitive ccds that allow you to see in the dark."
"neat," he said, and moved toward the first car.
"hey!" lex said. "i want to use it, too." "no,"
tim said.
"no fair! no fair! you get to do everything, timmy!"
ed regis watched them go and said to grant, "i can see what the ride back is going to be like."

grant and malcolm climbed into the second car. a few raindrops spattered the windshield.
"let's get going," ed regis said. "i'm about ready for dinner. and i could do with a nice banana
daiquiri. what do you say, folks? daiquiri sound good?" he pounded the metal panel of the car.
"see you back at camp" he said, and he started running toward the first car, and climbed aboard.
a red light on the dashboard blinked. with a soft electric whirr, the land cruisers started off.
driving back in the fading light, malcolm seemed oddly subdued. grant said, "you must feel
vindicated. about your theory."
"as a matter of fa

it were not true."
at that moment, the cars jolted to a stop, "what's happened?" grant said.
up ahead, they saw the kids in the car, pointing toward the ocean. offshore, beneath lowering
clouds, grant saw the dark outline of the supply boat making its way back toward puntarenas.
"why have we stopped?" malcolm said.
grant turned on the radio and heard the girl saying excitedly, "look there, timmy! you see it,
it's there!"
malcolm squinted at the boat. "they talking about the boat?"
"apparently."
ed regis climbed out of the front car and came running back to their window. "i'm sorry," he
said, "but the kids are all worked up. do you have binoculars here?"
"for what?"
"the little girl says she sees something on the boat. some kind of animal," regis said.
grant grabbed the binoculars and rested his elbows on the window ledge of the land cruiser. he
scanned the long shape of the supply ship. it was so dark it was almost a silhouette; as he
watched, the ship's running lights came on, brilliant in th

e forgot we ever had."
he swung the binoculars toward the stern, moving them slowly, and suddenly he saw the
animals. they were playing, darting among the silhouetted stern structures. he could see them
only briefly, but even in the fading light he could tell that they were upright animals, about two feet
tall, standing with stiff balancing tails.
"you see them now?" lex said. "i see
them," he said.
"what are they?"
"they're raptors," grant said, "at least two. maybe more. juveniles."
"jesus, " ed regis said. "that boat's going to the mainland."
malcolm shrugged. "don't get excited. just call the control room and tell them to recall the
boat."
ed regis reached in and grabbed the radio from the dashboard. they heard hissing static, and
clicks as he rapidly changed channels. "there's something wrong with this one," he said. "it's not
working."
he ran off to the first land cruiser. they saw him duck into it. then he looked back at them.
"there's something wrong with both the radios," he said. "i

about fifteen minutes." he yawned. "looks like a long weekend for me. i guess i'll go get that
coke now." he picked up his shoulder bag and headed for the door. "don't touch my console,
okay?"
the door closed.
"what a slob," hammond said.
"yeah," arnold said. "but i guess he knows what he's doing."
along the side of the road, clouds of volcanic steam misted rainbows in the bright quartz lights.
grant said into the radio, "how long does it take the ship to reach the mainland?"
"eighteen hours," ed regis said. "more or less. it's pretty reliable." he glanced at his watch. "it
should arrive around eleven tomorrow morning."
grant frowned. "you still can't talk to the control room?"
"not so far."
"how about harding? can you reach him?"
"no, i've tried. he may have his radio turned off."
malcolm was shaking his head. "so we're the only ones who know about the animals on the
ship."
"i'm trying to raise somebody," ed regis said. "i mean, christ, we don't want those animals on
the mainland."
"how long

 until we get back to the base?"
"from here, another sixteen, seventeen minutes," ed regis said.
at night, the whole road was illuminated by big floodlights. it felt to grant as if they were driving
through a bright green tunnel of leaves. large raindrops spattered the windshield.
grant felt the land cruiser slow, then stop. "now what?"
lex said, "i don't want to stop. why did we stop?"
and then, suddenly, all the floodlights went out. the road was plunged into darkness, lex said,
"hey!"
"probably just a power outage or something," ed regis said. "i'm sure the lights'll be on in a

pressing
heavily on his forehead. he reached for the knob near his ear and adjusted the intensity. there
was a brief phosphorescent flare, and then, in shades of electronic green and black, he could see
the land cruiser behind, with dr. grant and dr. malcolm inside. neat!
dr. grant was staring out the front windshield toward him. tim saw him pick up the radio from
the dash. there was a burst of static, and then he heard dr. grant's voice: "can you see us back
here?"
tim picked up the radio from ed regis. "i see you."
"everything all right?"
"we're fine, dr. grant."
"stay in the car."
"we will. don't worry." he clicked the radio off.
ed regis snorted. "it's pouring down rain. of course we'll stay in the car," he muttered.
tim turned to look at the foliage at the side of the road. through the goggles, the foliage was a
bright electronic green, and beyond he could see sections of the green grid pattern of the fence.
the land cruisers were stopped on the downslope of a hill, which must mean they w

hands.
dr. grant said, "what was that? we didn't quite read that."
"just my sister talking."
"oh."
tim again scanned the foliage, but saw nothing. certainly nothing as big as a tyrannosaur. he
began to wonder if the tyrannosaurs came out at night. were they nocturnal animals? tim wasn't
sure if he had ever read that. he had the feeling that tyrannosaurs were all-weather, day or night
animals. the time of day didn't matter to a tyrannosaur.
the rain continued to pour.
"hell of a rain," ed regis said. "it's really coming down."
lex said, "i'm hungry."
"i know that, lex," regis said, "but we're stuck here, sweetie. the cars run on electricity in
buried cables in the road."
"stuck for how long?"
"until they fix the electricity."
listening to the sound of the rain, tim felt himself growing sleepy. he yawned, and turned to
look at the palm trees on the left side of the road, and was startled by a sudden tbump as the
ground shook. he swung back just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark shap

e as it swiftly crossed
the road between the two cars.
"jesus! "
"what was it?"
"it was huge, it was big as the car-"
"tim! are you there?"
he picked up the radio. "yes, i'm here."
"did you see it, tim?"
"no," tim said. "i missed it."
"what the hell was it?" malcolm said. 
"are you wearing the night-vision goggles, tim?"
"yes. i'll watch," tim said.
"was it the tyrannosaur?" ed regis asked.
"i don't think so. it was in the road."
"but you didn't see it?" ed regis said.
"no. "
tim felt had that he had missed seeing the animal whatever it was.
there was a sudden white crack of lightning, and his night goggles flared bright green. he
blinked his eyes and started counting. "one one thousand . . . two one thousand . . ."
the thunder crashed, deafeningly loud and very close. lex began to cry. "oh, no . . ."
"take it easy, honey," ed regis said. "it's just lightning."
tim scanned the side of the road. the rain was coming down bard now, shaking the leaves

"okay."
lex continued to cry, snuffling.
there was another pause. tim watched the tyrannosaur. the head was huge! the animal
looked from one vehicle to another. then back again. it seemed to stare right at tim.
in the goggles, the eyes glowed bright green.
tim felt a chill, but then, as he looked down the animal's body, moving down from the massive
head and jaws, he saw the smaller, muscular forelimb. it waved in the air and then it gripped the
fence.
"jesus christ," ed regis said, staring out the window.
the greatest preditor the world has ever known. the most fearsome attack in human history.
somewhere in the back of his publicist's brain, ed regis was still writing copy. but he could feel
his knees begin to shake uncontrollably, his trousers flapping like flags, jesus, he was frightened.
he didn't want to be here. alone among all the people in the two cars, ed regis knew what a
dinosaur attack was like. he knew what happened to people. he had seen the mangled bod

that resulted from a raptor attack. he could picture it in his mind. and this was a rex! much, much
bigger! the greatest meat-eater that ever walked the earth!
jesus.
when the tyrannosaur roared it was terrifying, a scream from some other world. ed regis felt
the spreading warmth in his trousers. he'd peed in his pants. he was simultaneously
embarrassed and terrified. but he knew he had to do something. he couldn't just stay here. he
had to do something. something. his hands were shaking, trembling against the dash.
"jesus christ," he said again. 
"bad language," lex said, wagging her finger at him.
tim heard the sound of a door opening, and he swung his head away from the tyrannosaur-the
night-vision goggles streaked laterally-in time to see e

d regis stepping out through the open
door, ducking his head in the rain.
"hey," lex said, "where are you going?"
ed regis just turned and ran in the opposite direction from the tyrannosaur, disappearing into
the woods. the door to the land cruiser hung open; the paneling was getting wet.
"he left!" lex said. "where did he go? he left us alone!"
"shut the door," tim said, but she had started to scream, "he left us! he left us!"
"tim, what's going on?" it was dr. grant, on the radio. "tim?"
tim leaned forward and tried to shut the door. from the back seat, he couldn't reach the
handle. he looked back at the tyrannos

osaur roared. in the glare of lightning, they saw it pull
free of the fence and take a bounding step forward.
now it was standing between the two cars. tim couldn't see dr. grant's car any more, because
the huge body blocked his view. the rain ran in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the muscular
hind legs. he couldn't see the animal's head, which was high above the roofline. 
the tyrannosaur moved around the side of their car. it went to the very spot where tim had
gotten out of the car. where ed regis had gotten out of the car. the animal paused there. the
big head ducked down, toward the mud.
tim looked back at dr. grant and dr. malcolm in the rear car. their faces were tense as they
stared forward through the windshield.
the huge head raised back up, jaws open, and then stopped by the side windows. in the glare
of lightning, they saw the beady, expressionless reptile eye moving in the socket.
it was looking in the car.
his sister's breath came in ragged, frightened gasps. he reached out an

n to shout: "hellooo.
hell-oooo! dr. grant? dr. grant!"
tim was uneasy at the noise she was making-it might bring back the tyrannosaur-but a
moment later he heard an answering shout. it was coming from the right, over toward the land
cruiser that tim had left a few minutes before. with his goggles, tim saw with relief that dr.
grant was walking toward them, he had a big tear in his shirt at the shoulder, but otherwise he
looked okay.
"thank god," he said. "i've been looking for you."
shivering, ed regis got to his feet, and wiped the cold mud off his face and hands. he had spent a
very had half hour, wedged among big boulders on the slope of a hill below the road. he knew it
wasn't much of a hiding place, but he was panicked and he wasn't thinking clearly. he had lain in
this muddy cold place and he had tried to get hold of himself, but he kept seeing that dinosaur in
his mind. that dinosaur coming toward him. toward the car.
ed regis didn't remember exactly what had happened after that. he re

e had just saved himself. he
knew he should go back up to the road, he should try to rescue them, because he had always
imagined himself as brave and cool under pressure, but whenever he tried to get control of
himself, to make himself go back up there-somehow he just couldn't. he started to feel panicky,
and he had trouble breathing, and he didn't move.
he told himself it was hopeless, anyway. if the kids were still up there on the road they could
never survive, and certainly there was nothing ed regis could do for them, and he might as well 
stay where he was. no one was going to know what had happened except him. and there was
nothing he could do. nothing he could have done. and so regis had remained among the
boulders for half an hour, fighting off panic, carefully not thinking about whether the kids had died,
or about what hammond would have to say when he found out.
what finally made him move was the peculiar sensation he noticed in his mouth. the side of
his mouth felt funny, kind of nu

streak behind. jesus, he was probably covered with them. that fall down the hillside. these
jungle hills were full of leeches. so were the dark rocky crevices. what did the workmen say?

"hellooo!"
he stopped. it was a voice, carried by the wind.
"helloo! dr. grant!"
jesus, that was the little girl.
ed regis listened to the tone of her voice. she didn't sound frightened, or in pain. she was just
calling in her insistent way. and it slowly dawned on him that something else must have
happened, that the tyrannosaur must have gone away-or at least hadn't attacked-and that the
other people might still be alive. grant and malcolm. everybody might be alive. an the realization
made him pull himself together in an instant, the way you got sober in an instant when the cops
pulled you over, and he felt better

the top.
he started walking up the hill, back toward the land cruisers. it was very quiet. his feet
splashed in the muddy puddles. he couldn't bear the little girl any more. why had she stopped
calling? as he walked, he began to think that maybe something had happened to her. in that
case, he shouldn't walk back there. maybe the tyrannosaur was still hanging around. here he
was, already at the bottom of the hill. that much closer to home.
and it was so quiet. spooky, it was so quiet.
ed regis turned around, and started walking back toward the camp.
alan grant ran his hands over her limbs, squeezing the arms and legs briefly. she didn't seem to
have any pain. it was amazing: aside from a cut on her head, she was fine. "i told you i was," she
said.
"well, i had to check."
the boy was not quite so fortunate. tim's nose was swollen and painful; grant suspected it
was broken. his right shoulder was badly bruised and swollen. but his legs seemed to be all
right. both kids could walk. that

don't want to stay here," lex said.
then, from the bottom of the hill, they heard the sound of a man coughing.
"stay here," grant said. he ran forward, to look down the hill. "stay here," tim
said, and he ran forward after him.
lex followed her brother. "don't leave me, don't leave me here, you guys-"
grant clapped his band over her mouth. she struggled to protest. he shook his head, and
pointed over the hill, for her to look.
at the bottom of the hill, grant saw ed regis, standing rigid, unmoving. the forest around them
had become deadly silent. the steady background drone of cicadas and frogs had ceased
abruptly. there was only the faint rustle of leaves, and the whine of the wind,
lex started to speak, but grant pulled her against the trunk of the nearest tree, ducking down
among the heavy gnarled roots at the base. tim came in right after them. grant put his hands to
his lips, signaling them to be quiet, and then he slowly looked around the tree.

low was dark, and as the branches of the big trees moved in the wind, the
moonlight filtering through made a dappled, shifting pattern. ed regis was gone. it took grant a
moment to locate him. the publicist was pressed up against the trunk of a big tree, hugging it.
regis wasn't moving at all.
the forest remained silent.
lex tugged impatiently at grant's shirt; she wanted to know what was happening. then, from
somewhere very near, they heard a soft snorting exhalation, hardly louder than the wind. lex
heard it, too, because she stopped struggling.
the sound floated toward them again, soft as a sigh. grant thought it was almost like the

"hey!" regis shouted as he fell, but the juvenile did not pursue him, allowing him to get to his
feet. he jumped to his feet, and continued backing away. "you stupid-back! back! you heard meback!"
he shouted like a lion tamer.
the juvenile roared, but it did not attack, and regis now edged toward the trees and high
foliage to the right. in another few steps he would be in hiding. "back! you! back!" regis shouted,
and then, at the last moment the juvenile pounced, and knocked regis flat on his back. "cut that
out", regis yelled, and the juvenile ducked his head, and regis began to scream. no words, just a
high-pitched scream.
the scream cut off abruptly, and when the juvenile lifted his head, grant saw ragged flesh in
his jaws.
"oh no," lex said, softly. beside her, tim had turned away, suddenly nauseated. his nightvision
goggles slipped from his forehead and landed on the ground with a metallic clink.
the juvenile's head snapped up, and it looked toward the top of the hi

even from six feet away, he could see clearly what it was. he walked forward more slowly.
muldoon leaned out of the car and said, "what is it?" "it's
a leg," gennaro said.
the flesh of the leg was pale blue-wbite, terminating in a ragged bloody stump where the knee
had been. below the calf he saw a white sock, and a brown slip-on shoe. it was the kind of sboe
ed regis had been wearing.
by then muldoon was out of the car, running past him to crouch over the leg. "jesus." he lifted
the leg out of the foliage, raising it into the light of the headlamps, and blood from the stump
gushed down over his band. gennaro was still three feet away. he quickly bent over, put his
hands on his knees, squeezed his eyes shut, and breathed deeply, trying not to be sick.
"gennaro." muldoon's voice was sharp.
"what?"
"move. you're blocking the light."
gennaro took a breath, and

in truth, neither wu nor arnold had had the most important characteristic, hammond decided.
the characteristic of vision. that great sweeping act of imagination which evoked a marvelous
park, where children pressed against the fences, wondering at the extraordinary creatures, come
alive from their storybooks. real vision. the ability to see the future. the ability to marshal
resources to make that future vision a reality.
no, neither wu nor arnold was suited to that task.
and, for that matter, ed regis had been a poor choice, too. harding was at best an indifferent
choice. muldoon was a drunk.. . .
hammond shook his head. he would do better next time.
lost in his thoughts, he headed toward his bungalow, following the little path that ran north
from the visitor center. he passed one of the workmen, who nodded curtly. hammond did not
return the nod. he found the tican workmen to be uniformly insolent. to tell the truth, the choice
of this island off costa rica had also been unwise. he would not
