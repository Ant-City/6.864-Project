bootlesse are plaints, and curelesse are my wounds:
no way to flye, no strength to hold out flight:
the foe is mercilesse, and will not pitty:
for at their hands i haue deseru'd no pitty.
the ayre hath got into my deadly wounds,
and much effuse of blood, doth make me faint:
come yorke, and richard, warwicke, and the rest,
i stab'd your fathers bosomes; split my brest.

alarum & retreat. enter edward, warwicke, richard, and
soldiers, montague,
& clarence.

  ed. now breath we lords, good fortune bids vs pause,
and smooth the frownes of war, with peacefull lookes:
some troopes pursue the bloody-minded queene,
that led calme henry, though he were a king,
as doth a saile, fill'd with a fretting gust
command an argosie to stemme the waues.
but thinke you (lords) that clifford fled with them?

  king. once more we sit in englands royall throne,
re-purchac'd with the blood of enemies:
what valiant foe-men, like to autumnes corne,
haue we mow'd downe in tops of all their pride?
three dukes of somerset, threefold renowne,
for hardy and vndoubted champions:
two cliffords, as the father and the sonne,
and two northumberlands: two brauer men,
ne're spurr'd their coursers at the trumpets sound.
with them, the two braue beares, warwick & montague,
that in their chaines fetter'd the kingly lyon,
and made the forrest tremble when they roar'd.
thus haue we swept suspition from our seate,
and made our footstoole of security.
come hither besse, and let me kisse my boy:
yong ned, for thee, thine vnckles, and my selfe,
haue in our armors watcht the winters night,
went all afoote in summers scalding heate,
that thou might'st repossesse the crowne in peace,
and of our labours thou shalt reape the gaine
