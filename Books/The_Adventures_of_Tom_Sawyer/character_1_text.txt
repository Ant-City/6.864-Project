ok at your hands. and look at your mouth. what _is_ that
truck?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t know, aunt.ï¿½

ï¿½well, i know. itï¿½s jam--thatï¿½s what it is. forty times iï¿½ve said if you
didnï¿½t let that jam alone iï¿½d skin you. hand me that switch.ï¿½

the switch hovered in the air--the peril was desperate--

ï¿½my! look behind you, aunt!ï¿½

the old lady whirled round, and snatched her skirts out of danger.
the lad fled on the instant, scrambled up the high board-fence, and
disappeared over it.

his aunt polly stood surprised a moment, and then broke into a gentle
laugh.

ï¿½hang the boy, canï¿½t i never learn anything? ainï¿½t he played me tricks
enough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time? but old
fools is the biggest fools there is. canï¿½t learn an old dog new tricks,
as the saying is. but my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days,
and how is a body to know whatï¿½s coming? he ï¿½pears to know just how long
he can torment me before i get my dander up, and he knows if he

ime. he got back home
barely in season to help jim, the small colored boy, saw next-dayï¿½s wood
and split the kindlings before supper--at least he was there in time
to tell his adventures to jim while jim did three-fourths of the work.
tomï¿½s younger brother (or rather half-brother) sid was already through
with his part of the work (picking up chips), for he was a quiet boy,
and had no adventurous, trouble-some ways.

while tom was eating his supper, and stealing sugar as opportunity
offered, aunt polly asked him questions that were full of guile, and
very deep--for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. like
many other simple-hearted souls, it was her pet vanity to believe she
was endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy, and she
loved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of low
cunning. said she:

ï¿½tom, it was middling warm in school, warnï¿½t it?ï¿½

ï¿½yesï¿½m.ï¿½

ï¿½powerful warm, warnï¿½t it?ï¿½

ï¿½yesï¿½m.ï¿½

a bit of a scare shot through tom--a touch of uncomfortable suspicion. he
searched aunt pollyï¿½s face, but it told him nothing. so he said:

ï¿½noï¿½m--well, not very much.ï¿½

the old lady reached out her hand and felt tomï¿½s shirt, and said:

ï¿½but you ainï¿½t too warm now, though.ï¿½ and it flattered her to reflect
that she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowing
that that was what she had in her mind. but in spite of her, tom knew
where the wind lay, now. so he forestalled what might be the next move:

ï¿½some of us pumped on our heads--mineï¿½s damp yet. se

e?ï¿½

aunt polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit of
circumstantial evidence, and missed a trick. then she had a new
inspiration:

ï¿½tom, you didnï¿½t have to undo your shirt collar where i sewed it, to
pump on your head, did you? unbutton your jacket!ï¿½

the trouble vanished out of tomï¿½s face. he opened his jacket. his shirt
collar was securely sewed.

ï¿½bother! well, go ï¿½long with you. iï¿½d made sure youï¿½d played hookey
and been a-swimming. but i forgive ye, tom. i reckon youï¿½re a ki

ï¿½my! datï¿½s a mighty gay marvel, i tell you! but mars tom iï¿½s powerful

ï¿½and besides, if you will iï¿½ll show you my sore toe.ï¿½

jim was only human--this attraction was too much for him. he put down
his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing
interest while the bandage was being unwound. in another moment he
was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, tom was
whitewashing with vigor, and aunt polly was retiring from the field with
a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.

but tomï¿½s energy did not last. he began to think of the fun he had
planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. soon the free boys
would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and
they would make a world of fun of him for having to work--the very
thought of it burnt him like fire. he got out his worldly wealth and
examined it--bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange

that put the thing in a new light. ben stopped nibbling his apple.
tom swept his brush daintily back and forth--stepped back to note the
effect--added a touch here and there--criticised the effect again--ben
watching every move and getting more and more interested, more and more
absorbed. presently he said:

ï¿½say, tom, let _me_ whitewash a little.ï¿½

tom considered, was about to consent; but he altered his mind:

ï¿½no--no--i reckon it wouldnï¿½t hardly do, ben. you see, aunt pollyï¿½s awful
particular about this fence--right here on the street, you know--but if it
was the back fence i wouldnï¿½t mind and _she_ wouldnï¿½t. yes, sheï¿½s awful
particular about this fence; itï¿½s got to be done very careful; i reckon
there ainï¿½t one boy in a thousand, maybe two thousand, that can do it
the way itï¿½s got to be done.ï¿½

ï¿½no--is that so? oh come, now--lemme just try. only just a little--iï¿½d let

ly amusement. there are wealthy gentlemen in england
who drive four-horse passenger-coaches twenty or thirty miles on a
daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable
money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn
it into work and then they would resign.

the boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken place
in his worldly circumstances, and then wended toward headquarters to
report.




chapter iii

tom presented himself before aunt polly, who was sitting by an
open window in a pleasant rearward apartment, which was bedroom,
breakfast-room, dining-room, and library, combined. the balmy summer
air, the restful quiet, the odor of the flowers, and the drowsing
murmur of the bees had had their effect, and she was nodding over her
knitting--for she had no company but the cat, and it was asleep in her
lap. her spectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. she had
thought that of course tom had deserted long ago, and she wond

seeing him place himself in her power again in this intrepid way. he
said: ï¿½maynï¿½t i go and play now, aunt?ï¿½

ï¿½what, aï¿½ready? how much have you done?ï¿½

ï¿½itï¿½s all done, aunt.ï¿½

ï¿½tom, donï¿½t lie to me--i canï¿½t bear it.ï¿½

ï¿½i ainï¿½t, aunt; it _is_ all done.ï¿½

aunt polly placed small trust in such evidence. she went out to see for
herself; and she would have been content to find twenty per cent. of
tomï¿½s statement true. when she found the entire fence white-washed, and
not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated, and even a
streak added to the ground, her astonishment was almost unspeakable. she
said:

ï¿½well, i never! thereï¿½s no getting round it, you can work when youï¿½re a
mind to, tom.ï¿½ and then she diluted the compliment by adding, ï¿½b

ected a choice apple and delivered it to him,
along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor a treat
took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.
and while she closed with a happy scriptural flourish, he ï¿½hookedï¿½ a
doughnut.

then he skipped out, and saw sid just starting up the outside stairway
that led to the back rooms on the second floor. clods were handy and
the air was full of them in a twinkling. they raged around sid like a
hail-storm; and before aunt polly could collect her surprised faculties
and sally to the rescue, six or seven clods had taken personal effect,
and tom was over the fence and gone. there was a gate, but as a general
thing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. his soul was at
peace, now that he had settled with sid for calling attention to his
black thread and getting him into trouble.

tom skirted the block, and came round into a muddy alley that led by the
back of his auntï¿½s cow-stable. he presently got safely beyond

 and there would be
nothing so good in the world as to see that pet model ï¿½catch it.ï¿½ he was
so brimful of exultation that he could hardly hold himself when the old
lady came back and stood above the wreck discharging lightnings of wrath
from over her spectacles. he said to himself, ï¿½now itï¿½s coming!ï¿½ and the
next instant he was sprawling on the floor! the potent palm was uplifted
to strike again when tom cried out:

ï¿½hold on, now, what ï¿½er you belting _me_ for?--sid broke it!ï¿½

aunt polly paused, perplexed, and tom looked for healing pity. but when
she got her tongue again, she only said:

ï¿½umf! well, you didnï¿½t get a lick amiss, i reckon. you been into some
other audacious mischief when i wasnï¿½t around, like enough.ï¿½

then her conscience reproached her, and she yearned to say something
kind and loving; but she judged that this would be construed into a
confession that she had been in the wrong, and discipline forbade that.
so she kept silence, and went about her affairs

ong after, as tom, all undressed for bed, was surveying his
drenched garments by the light of a tallow dip, sid woke up; but if he
had any dim idea of making any ï¿½references to allusions,ï¿½ he thought
better of it and held his peace, for there was danger in tomï¿½s eye.

tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers, and sid made mental
note of the omission.




chapter iv

the sun rose upon a tranquil world, and beamed down upon the peaceful
village like a benediction. breakfast over, aunt polly had family
worship: it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solid
courses of scriptural quotations, welded together with a thin mortar of
originality; and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapter of
the mosaic law, as from sinai.

then tom girded up his loins, so to speak, and went to work to ï¿½get
his verses.ï¿½ sid had learned his lesson days before. tom bent all his
energies to the memorizing of five verses, and he chose part of the
sermon on the mount, because he cou

me. when iï¿½m gone--ï¿½

ï¿½oh, tom, you ainï¿½t dying, are you? donï¿½t, tom--oh, donï¿½t. maybe--ï¿½

ï¿½i forgive everybody, sid. [groan.] tell ï¿½em so, sid. and sid, you give
my window-sash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thatï¿½s come to
town, and tell her--ï¿½

but sid had snatched his clothes and gone. tom was suffering in reality,
now, so handsomely was his imagination working, and so his groans had
gathered quite a genuine tone.

sid flew downstairs and said:

ï¿½oh, aunt polly, come! tomï¿½s dying!ï¿½

ï¿½dying!ï¿½

ï¿½yesï¿½m. donï¿½t wait--come quick!ï¿½

ï¿½rubbage! i donï¿½t believe it!ï¿½

but she fled upstairs, nevertheless, with sid and mary at her heels.
and her face grew white, too, and her lip trembled. when she reached the
bedside she gasped out:

ï¿½you, tom! tom, whatï¿½s the matter with you?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, auntie, iï¿½m--ï¿½

ï¿½whatï¿½s the matter with you--what is the matter with you, child?ï¿½

ï¿½oh, auntie, my sore toeï¿½s mortified!ï¿½

ank down into a chair and laughed a little, then cried a
little, then did both together. this restored her and she said:

ï¿½tom, what a turn you did give me. now you shut up that nonsense and
climb out of this.ï¿½

the groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. the boy felt a
little foolish, and he said:

ï¿½aunt polly, it _seemed_ mortified, and it hurt so i never minded my
tooth at all.ï¿½

ï¿½your tooth, indeed! whatï¿½s the matter with your tooth?ï¿½

ï¿½one of themï¿½s loose, and it aches perfectly awful.ï¿½

ï¿½there, there, now, donï¿½t begin that groaning again. open your mouth.
well--your tooth _is_ loose, but youï¿½re not going to die about that.
mary, get me a silk thread, and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.ï¿½

tom said:

ï¿½oh, please, auntie, donï¿½t pull it out. it donï¿½t hurt any more. i

 strike ten! this was despair. he
would have tossed and fidgeted, as his nerves demanded, but he was
afraid he might wake sid. so he lay still, and stared up into the dark.
everything was dismally still. by and by, out of the stillness, little,
scarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. the ticking
of the clock began to bring itself into notice. old beams began to crack
mysteriously. the stairs creaked faintly. evidently spirits were abroad.
a measured, muffled snore issued from aunt pollyï¿½s chamber. and now the
tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity could locate,
began. next the ghastly ticking of a death-watch in the wall at the
bedï¿½s head made tom shudder--it meant that somebodyï¿½s days were numbered.
then the howl of a far-off dog rose on the night air, and was answered
by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. tom was in an agony. at last
he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternity begun; he began to
doze, in spite of himself; the clock chimed el

circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction; but they were
disappointed, for more than one villager remarked:

ï¿½it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it.ï¿½

tomï¿½s fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this; and at breakfast one morning sid said:

ï¿½tom, you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time.ï¿½

tom blanched and dropped his eyes.

ï¿½itï¿½s a bad sign,ï¿½ said aunt polly, gravely. ï¿½what you got on your mind,
tom?ï¿½

ï¿½nothing. nothing ï¿½t i know of.ï¿½ but the boyï¿½s hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee.

ï¿½and you do talk such stuff,ï¿½ sid said. ï¿½last night you said, ï¿½itï¿½s
blood, itï¿½s blood, thatï¿½s what it is!ï¿½ you said that over and over.
and you said, ï¿½donï¿½t torment me so--iï¿½ll tell!ï¿½ tell _what_? what is it
youï¿½ll tell?ï¿½

everything was swimming before tom. there is no telling what might have
happened, now, but luckily th

and she came to tomï¿½s relief without knowing it. she said:

ï¿½sho! itï¿½s that dreadful murder. i dream about it most every night
myself. sometimes i dream itï¿½s me that done it.ï¿½

mary said she had been affected much the same way. sid seemed satisfied.
tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after
that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every
night. he never knew that sid lay nightly watching, and frequently
slipped the bandage fr

so tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the pain-killer. peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then
delivered a war-whoop and set off round and round the room, banging
against furniture, upsetting flower-pots, and making general havoc. next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment,
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable happiness. then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path. aunt polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah,
and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower-pots
with him. the old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over
her glasses; tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.

ï¿½tom, what on earth ails that cat?ï¿½

ï¿½i donï¿½t know, aunt,ï¿½ gasped the boy.

ï¿½why, i never see anything like it. what did make him act so?ï¿½

ï¿½deed i donï¿½t know, aunt polly; cats always act so

when theyï¿½re having a
good time.ï¿½

ï¿½they do, do they?ï¿½ there was something in the tone that made tom
apprehensive.

ï¿½yesï¿½m. that is, i believe they do.ï¿½

ï¿½you _do_?ï¿½

ï¿½yesï¿½m.ï¿½

the old lady was bending down, tom watching, with interest emphasized
by anxiety. too late he divined her ï¿½drift.ï¿½ the handle of the telltale
tea-spoon was visible under the bed-valance. aunt polly took it, held it
up. tom winced, and dropped his eyes. aunt polly raised him by the usual
handle--his ear--and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.

ï¿½now, sir, what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so, for?ï¿½

ï¿½i done it out of pity for him--because he hadnï¿½t any aunt.ï¿½

ï¿½hadnï¿½t any aunt!--you numskull. what has that got to do with it?ï¿½

ï¿½heaps. because if heï¿½d had one sheï¿½d a burnt him out herself! sheï¿½d a
roasted his bowels out of him ï¿½thout any more feeling than if he was a
human!ï¿½

aunt polly felt a sudden pang o

un. tom felt happy in
his success, for he knew it was the boatï¿½s last trip for the night. at
the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and
tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards
downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.

he flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his
auntï¿½s back fence. he climbed over, approached the ï¿½ell,ï¿½ and looked
in at the sitting-room window, for a light was burning there. there
sat aunt polly, sid, mary, and joe harperï¿½s mother, grouped together,
talking. they were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the
door. tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then
he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing
cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might
squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began,
warily.

ï¿½what makes the candle blow so?ï¿½ said aunt polly. tom hurried up. ï¿½why,
that doorï¿

½s open, i believe. why, of course it is. no end of strange
things now. go ï¿½long and shut it, sid.ï¿½

tom disappeared under the bed just in time. he lay and ï¿½breathedï¿½
 himself for a time, and then crept to where he could almost touch his
auntï¿½s foot.

ï¿½but as i was saying,ï¿½ said aunt polly, ï¿½he warnï¿½t _bad_, so to say--only
misch_ee_vous. only just giddy, and harum-scarum, you know. he warnï¿½t
any more responsible than a colt. _he_ never meant any harm, and he was
the best-hearted boy that ever wasï¿½--and she began to cry.

ï¿½it was just so with my joe--always full of his devilment, and up to
every kind of mischief, but he was just as unselfish and kind as he
could be--and laws bless me, to think i went and whipped him for taking
that cream, never once recollecting that i

ly because the drowning must
have occurred in mid-channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would
otherwise have escaped to shore. this was wednesday night. if the bodies
continued missing until sunday, all hope would be given over, and the
funerals would be preached on that morning. tom shuddered.

mrs. harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. then with a
mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each otherï¿½s
arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. aunt polly was
tender far beyond her wont, in her goodnight to sid and mary. sid
snuffled a bit and mary went off crying with all her heart.

aunt polly knelt down and prayed for tom so touchingly, so appealingly,
and with such measureless love in her words and her old trembling voice,
that he was weltering in tears again, long before she was through.

he had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making
broken-hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and
turning over.

promise for lack of effort. no, they practised cautiously, after supper,
with right fair success, and so they spent a jubilant evening. they were
prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they would have been
in the scalping and skinning of the six nations. we will leave them to
smoke and chatter and brag, since we have no further use for them at
present.




chapter xvii

but there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquil saturday
afternoon. the harpers, and aunt pollyï¿½s family, were being put into
mourning, with great grief and many tears. an unusual quiet possessed
the village, although it was ordinarily quiet enough, in all conscience.
the villagers conducted their concerns with an absent air, and talked
little; but they sighed often. the saturday holiday seemed a burden to
the children. they had no heart in their sports, and gradually gave them
up.

in the afternoon becky thatcher found herself moping about the deserted
schoolhouse yard, and feeling ver

sabbath, and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hush
that lay upon nature. the villagers began to gather, loitering a moment
in the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. but there
was no whispering in the house; only the funereal rustling of dresses
as the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. none
could remember when the little church had been so full before. there
was finally a waiting pause, an expectant dumbness, and then aunt polly
entered, followed by sid and mary, and they by the harper family, all in
deep black, and the whole congregation, the old minister as well, rose
reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the front pew.
there was another communing silence, broken at intervals by muffled
sobs, and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed. a moving
hymn was sung, and the text followed: ï¿½i am the resurrection and the
life.ï¿½

as the service proceeded, the clergyman drew such pictures of t

the church door creaked; the minister raised his streaming eyes above
his handkerchief, and stood transfixed! first one and then another pair
of eyes followed the ministerï¿½s, and then almost with one impulse the
congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys came marching up
the aisle, tom in the lead, joe next, and huck, a ruin of drooping rags,
sneaking sheepishly in the rear! they had been hid in the unused gallery
listening to their own funeral sermon!

aunt polly, mary, and the harpers threw themselves upon their restored
ones, smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings, while
poor huck stood abashed and uncomfortable, not knowing exactly what
to do or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. he wavered, and
started to slink away, but tom seized him and said:

ï¿½aunt polly, it ainï¿½t fair. somebodyï¿½s got to be glad to see huck.ï¿½

ï¿½and so they shall. iï¿½m glad to see him, poor motherless thing!ï¿½ and

and they did. old hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst, and
while it shook the rafters tom sawyer the pirate looked around upon the
envying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this was the
proudest moment of his life.

as the ï¿½soldï¿½ congregation trooped out they said they would almost be
willing to be made ridiculous again to hear old hundred sung like that
once more.

tom got more cuffs and kisses that day--according to aunt pollyï¿½s varying
moods--than he had earned before in a year; and he hardly knew which
expressed the most gratefulness to god and affection for himself.




chapter xviii

that was tomï¿½s great secret--the scheme to return home with his brother
pirates and attend their own funerals. they had paddled over to the
missouri shore on a log, at dusk on saturday, landing five or six miles
below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town
till nearly daylight, and had then crept through

 back lanes and alleys
and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of
invalided benches.

at breakfast, monday morning, aunt polly and mary were very loving to
tom, and very attentive to his wants. there was an unusual amount of
talk. in the course of it aunt polly said:

ï¿½well, i donï¿½t say it wasnï¿½t a fine joke, tom, to keep everybody
suffering ï¿½most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you
could be so hard-hearted as to let me suffer so. if you could come over
on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a
hint some way that you warnï¿½t dead, but only run off.ï¿½

ï¿½yes, you could have done that, tom,ï¿½ said mary; ï¿½and i believe you
would if you had thought of it.ï¿½

ï¿½would you, tom?ï¿½ said aunt p

ï¿½i--well, i donï¿½t know. ï¿½twould ï¿½aï¿½ spoiled everything.ï¿½

ï¿½tom, i hoped you loved me that much,ï¿½ said aunt polly, with a grieved
tone that discomforted the boy. ï¿½it would have been something if youï¿½d
cared enough to _think_ of it, even if you didnï¿½t _do_ it.ï¿½

ï¿½now, auntie, that ainï¿½t any harm,ï¿½ pleaded mary; ï¿½itï¿½s only tomï¿½s giddy
way--he is always in such a rush that he never thinks of anything.ï¿½

ï¿½moreï¿½s the pity. sid would have thought. and sid would have come and
_done_ it, too. tom, youï¿½ll look back, some day, when itï¿½s too late,
and wish youï¿½d cared a little more for

 away, and stood by musing a minute. twice she put out
her hand to take the garment again, and twice she refrained. once more
she ventured, and this time she fortified herself with the thought:
ï¿½itï¿½s a good lie--itï¿½s a good lie--i wonï¿½t let it grieve me.ï¿½ so she
sought the jacket pocket. a moment later she was reading tomï¿½s piece of
bark through flowing tears and saying: ï¿½i could forgive the boy, now, if
heï¿½d committed a million sins!ï¿½




chapter xx

there was something about aunt pollyï¿½s manner, when she kissed tom, that
swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happy again. he
started to school and had the luck of coming upon becky thatcher at the
head of meadow lane. his mood always determined his manner. without a
momentï¿½s hesitation he ran to her and said:

ï¿½i acted mighty mean today, becky, and iï¿½m so sorry. i wonï¿½t ever, ever
do that way again, as long as ever i live--please make up, wonï¿½t you?ï¿½

the girl stopped and looked him scornfully in

ing event was well canvassed. news came
that not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. when the
sermon was finished, judge thatcherï¿½s wife dropped alongside of mrs.
harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and said:

ï¿½is my becky going to sleep all day? i just expected she would be tired
to death.ï¿½

ï¿½your becky?ï¿½

ï¿½yes,ï¿½ with a startled look--ï¿½didnï¿½t she stay with you last night?ï¿½

ï¿½why, no.ï¿½

mrs. thatcher turned pale, and sank into a pew, just as aunt polly,
talking briskly with a friend, passed by. aunt polly said:

ï¿½goodmorning, mrs. thatcher. goodmorning, mrs. harper. iï¿½ve got a boy
thatï¿½s turned up missing. i reckon my tom stayed at your house last
night--one of you. and now heï¿½s afraid to come to church. iï¿½ve got to
settle with him.ï¿½

mrs. thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.

ï¿½he didnï¿½t stay with us,ï¿½ said mrs. harper, beginning to look uneasy. a
marked anxiety came into aunt pollyï¿½s face.

mber, but was not sure he could say. the people had
stopped moving out of church. whispers passed along, and a boding
uneasiness took possession of every countenance. children were anxiously
questioned, and young teachers. they all said they had not noticed
whether tom and becky were on board the ferryboat on the homeward trip;
it was dark; no one thought of inquiring if any one was missing. one
young man finally blurted out his fear that they were still in the cave!
mrs. thatcher swooned away. aunt polly fell to crying and wringing her
hands.

the alarm swept from lip to lip, from group to group, from street to
street, and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and
the whole town was up! the cardiff hill episode sank into instant
insignificance, the burglars were forgotten, horses were saddled, skiffs
were manned, the ferryboat ordered out, and before the horror was half
an hour old, two hundred men were pouring down highroad and river toward
the cave.

all the long afternoon the vi

llage seemed empty and dead. many women
visited aunt polly and mrs. thatcher and tried to comfort them. they
cried with them, too, and that was still better than words. all the
tedious night the town waited for news; but when the morning dawned at
last, all the word that came was, ï¿½send more candles--and send food.ï¿½
 mrs. thatcher was almost crazed; and aunt polly, also. judge thatcher
sent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave, but they conveyed
no real cheer.

the old welshman came home toward daylight, spattered with
candle-grease, smeared with clay, and almost worn out. he found huck
still in the bed that had been provided for him, and delirious with
fever. the physicians were all at the cave, so the widow douglas came
and took charge of the patient. she said she would do her best by him,
because, whether he was good, bad, or indifferent,

 and many a private prayer
that had the petitionerï¿½s whole heart in it; but still no good news came
from the cave. the majority of the searchers had given up the quest
and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the
children could never be found. mrs. thatcher was very ill, and a great
part of the time delirious. people said it was heartbreaking to hear her
call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time,
then lay it wearily down again with a moan. aunt polly had drooped into
a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. the
village went to its rest on tuesday night, sad and forlorn.

away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village
bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half-clad
people, who shouted, ï¿½turn out! turn out! theyï¿½re found! theyï¿½re found!ï¿½
 tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself
and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an ope

y shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward
march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after
huzzah!

the village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the
greatest night the little town had ever seen. during the first half-hour
a procession of villagers filed through judge thatcherï¿½s house, seized
the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed mrs. thatcherï¿½s hand, tried to
speak but couldnï¿½t--and drifted out raining tears all over the place.

aunt pollyï¿½s happiness was complete, and mrs. thatcherï¿½s nearly so. it
would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the
great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. tom lay upon
a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the
wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it
withal; and closed with a description of how he left becky and went
on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his
kite-line would

and the widow good friends?ï¿½

ï¿½yes. well, sheï¿½s ben good friends to me, anyway.ï¿½

ï¿½all right, then. what do you want to be afraid for?ï¿½

this question was not entirely answered in huckï¿½s slow mind before he
found himself pushed, along with tom, into mrs. douglasï¿½ drawing-room.
mr. jones left the wagon near the door and followed.

the place was grandly lighted, and everybody that was of any consequence
in the village was there. the thatchers were there, the harpers, the
rogerses, aunt polly, sid, mary, the minister, the editor, and a great
many more, and all dressed in their best. the widow received the boys
as heartily as any one could well receive two such looking beings. they
were covered with clay and candle-grease. aunt polly blushed crimson
with humiliation, and frowned and shook her head at tom. nobody suffered
half as much as the two boys did, however. mr. jones said:

ï¿½tom wasnï¿½t at home, yet, so i gave him up; but i stumbled on him and
huck right at my door, and so i

 but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company kept
back the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. but
the silence was a little awkward. tom broke it:

ï¿½huckï¿½s got money. maybe you donï¿½t believe it, but heï¿½s got lots of it.
oh, you neednï¿½t smile--i reckon i can show you. you just wait a minute.ï¿½

tom ran out of doors. the company looked at each other with a perplexed
interest--and inquiringly at huck, who was tongue-tied.

ï¿½sid, what ails tom?ï¿½ said aunt polly. ï¿½he--well, there ainï¿½t ever any
making of that boy out. i never--ï¿½

tom entered, struggling with the weight of his sacks, and aunt polly
did not finish her sentence. tom poured the mass of yellow coin upon the
table and said:

ï¿½there--what did i tell you? half of itï¿½s huckï¿½s and half of itï¿½s mine!ï¿½

the spectacle took the general breath away. all gazed, nobody spoke for
a moment. then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. tom said
he could furnish it, and he did. the t

ir remarks had
possessed weight before; but now their sayings were treasured and
repeated; everything they did seemed somehow to be regarded as
remarkable; they had evidently lost the power of doing and saying
commonplace things; moreover, their past history was raked up and
discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. the village paper
published biographical sketches of the boys.

the widow douglas put huckï¿½s money out at six per cent., and judge
thatcher did the same with tomï¿½s at aunt pollyï¿½s request. each lad had
an income, now, that was simply prodigious--a dollar for every weekday in
the year and half of the sundays. it was just what the minister got--no,
it was what he was promised--he generally couldnï¿½t collect it. a dollar
and a quarter a week would board, lodge, and school a boy in those old
simple days--and clothe him and wash him, too, for that matter.

judge thatcher had conceived a great opinion of tom. he said that no
commonplace boy would ever have got his daughte
