 of ours, because they've got no tree roots to make a wide
roof. we had to wait outside while they were talking about all sorts of other
things. we were just one piece of daily council business: 'strangers
apprehended.' there was another rabbit waiting and he was under special guard
-- owslafa, they call them: the council police. i've never been near anyone so
frightened in my life -- i thought he'd go mad with fear. i asked one of these
owslafa what was the matter and he said that this rabbit, blackavar, had been
caught trying to run away from the warren. well, they took him inside and first of
all we heard the poor fellow trying to explain himself, and then he was crying and
begging for mercy: and when he came out they'd ripped both his ears to shreds,
worse than this one of mine. we were all sniffing at him, absolutely horror-
stricken; but one of the owslafa said, 'you needn't make such a fuss. he's lucky to
be alive.' so while we were chewing on that, someone came out and said the

. one eyelid was misshapen and closed askew. despite the cool, exciting air
of the july evening, he seemed apathetic and torpid. he kept his gaze fixed on the
ground and blinked continually. after a time he lowered his head and rubbed his
nose on his forepaws in a listless manner. then he scratched his neck and settled
down in his former drooping position.

     bigwig, his warm, impulsive nature stirred by curiosity and pity, went across
the run.
     "who are you?" he asked.
     "my name is blackavar, sir," replied the rabbit. he did not look up and spoke
without expression, as though he had answered this question many times before.
     "are you going to silflay?" said bigwig. no doubt, he thought, this was some
hero of the warren, wounded in a great fight and now infirm, whose past services
merited an honorable escort when he went out.
     "no, sir," answered the rabbit.
     "why ever not?" said bigwig. "it's a lovely evening."
     "i don't silflay at this time, sir."
     "then why ar

 "mating?" said chervil. "well, if you want a doe, you have one -- any doe in the
mark, that is. we're not officers for nothing, are we? the does are under orders
and none of the bucks can stop you. that just leaves you and me and avens; and
we shall hardly quarrel. there are plenty of does, after all."
     "i see," said bigwig. "well, i'll silflay now. unless you've got any other ideas,
i'll go and talk to some of the mark and then go round the sentries and get the lie
of the land. what about blackavar?"
     "leave him," said chervil. "he's none of our business. the owslafa will keep
him here until the mark come back and after that they'll take him away."
     bigwig made his way into the field, conscious of the wary glances of the rabbits
he passed. he felt perplexed and apprehensive. how was he to begin his
dangerous task? begin he must, in one way or another, for kehaar had made it
clear that he was not ready to wait. there was nothing for it but to take a chance
and trust somebody. but w

hom? a warren like this must be full of spies. probably
only general woundwort knew who the spies were. was there a spy watching him
now?
     "i shall just have to trust my feelings," he thought. "i'll go round the place a bit
and see if i can make any friends. but i know one thing -- if i do succeed in
getting any does out of here, i'll take that poor wretched blackavar with me as
well. frith on a bridge! it makes me angry just to think of him being forced to sit
there like that. general woundwort indeed! a gun's too good for him."
     nibbling and pondering, he moved slowly over the open meadow in the
evening sun. after a while he found that he was approaching a small hollow,
much like the one on watership down where he and silver had found kehaar. in
this hollow there were four does, with their backs to him. he recognized them as
the little group who had go

neighbor in a matter of moments; and the appropriate stamping signal -- for they
had more than one -- would bring out the officers and the reserves. if necessary,
the owslafa could be alerted in almost no time at all and so could captain
campion, or whatever officer might be patrolling the outskirts of the warren.
since only one mark fed at a time, there could hardly be any confusion about
where to go if an alarm were given. one of the sentries, marjoram, told him about
the attempted escape by blackavar.
     "he pretended to feed his way out as far as he could," said marjoram, "and
then he made a dash. he actually managed to knock down two sentries who tried
to stop him; and i doubt whether anyone on his own has ever done as much as
that. he ran like mad, but campion had got the alarm, you see, and he simply
moved round and intercepted him further down the fields. of course, if he hadn't
smashed up the sentries, the council might have let him off more lightly."
     "do you like the warren li

and listened to the talk. he gathered that campion had been
out as far as the iron road but had found nothing unusual.
     "don't you ever go beyond the iron road?" he asked.
     "not very often," answered campion. "it's wet, you know -- bad rabbit country.
i have been there, but on these ordinary circuit patrols i'm really looking nearer
home. my job is partly to notice anything new that the council ought to know
about, and partly to make sure we pick up anyone who bolts. like that miserable
blackavar -- and he gave me a bite i shan't forget, before i got him down. on a
fine evening like this, i generally go down as far as the bank of the iron road and
then work along this side of it. or sometimes i go out in the other direction, as far
as the barn. it all depends what's wanted. by the way, i saw the general earlier
this evening and i rather think he means to take you on patrol in two or three
days' time, as soon as you've settled down and your mark have come off the dawn
and evening silflay
 
 ___________________________
 
     "why wait for that?" said bigwig with all the enthusiasm he could assume.
"why not sooner?"
     "well, a mark generally keeps a full owsla when it's on dawn and evening
silflay. the rabbits are more lively at those times, you see, and need more
supervision. but a mark that's on ni-frith and fu-inlé silflay can generally spare
owsla for a wide patrol. now i'll leave you here. i've got to take my lot to the
crixa and report to the general."
     as soon as the mark had gone underground and blackavar had been taken
away by his escort, bigwig excused himself to chervil and avens and went to his
own burrow. although the rank and file were cramped underground, the sentries
had two large, roomy burrows to themselves, while each officer had a private
burrow. by himself at last, bigwig settled down to think over his problem.
     the difficulties were bewildering. he was fairly certain that with kehaar's help
he himself could escape from efrafa whenever he wished. but how in the world
was he to b
 
 ___________________________
 
ring a bunch of does out -- supposing that any were ready to try it? if
he took it upon himself to call the sentries in during a silflay, chervil would see in
a matter of moments what he had done. the only possibility, then, was to make
the break-out during the day: to wait until chervil was asleep and then order a
sentry to leave his post at the mouth of one of the holes. bigwig considered. he
could see no flaw in this idea. then the thought came to him, "and what about

blackavar?" blackavar presumably spent the day under guard in some special
burrow. probably hardly anyone knew where -- no one knew anything in efrafa --
and certainly no one would tell. so he would have to leave blackavar: no realistic
plan could include him.
     "i'll be jiggered if i leave him," muttered bigwig to himself. "i know blackberry
would say i was a fool. still, he's not here and i'm doing this myself. but suppose i
wreck the whole thing because of blackavar? oh, frith in a barn! what a
business!"

     after another silence, hyzenthlay said, "my courage -- my spirit: it's so much
less than it was. i'm afraid to let you rely on me."
     "i can tell that. what is it that's worn you down? weren't you the leader of the
does who went to the council?"
     "there was myself and thethuthinnang. i don't know what's happened to the
other does who were with us. we were all in the right fore mark then, you know.

i've still got the right fore mark, but i've been marked again since. blackavar --
you saw him?"
     "yes, of course."
     "he was in that mark. he was our friend and encouraged us. only a night or
two after the does went up to speak to the council, he tried to run away, but he
was caught. you've seen what they did to him. that was the same evening that
your friends came: and the next night they escaped. after that, the council sent
for us does once more. the general said that no one else would have the chance
to run away. we were to be split up among the marks, no more

     "if you were wrong, those who died quickly would be the lucky ones."
     "no one's going to die. my friends have prepared a trick that el-ahrairah
himself would be proud of."
     "if it is to be at sunset," she said, "it must be tomorrow or the next night. in
two days the mark loses the evening silflay. you know that?"
     "yes, i'd heard. tomorrow, then. why wait longer? but there is one other
thing. we're going to take blackavar."
     "blackavar? how? he is guarded by council police."
     "i know. it adds very much to the risk, but i've decided that i can't leave him
behind. what i mean to do is this. tomorrow evening, when the mark silflay, you
and thethuthinnang must keep the does near you -- as many as you've got
together -- ready to run. i shall meet the bird a little way out in the meadow and

anything of the sort. i'll have him out in a moment and join you. there'll be
complete confusion and in that confusion we'll run. the bird will attack anyone
who tries to follow us. remember, we go straight down to the great arch in the
iron road. my friends will be waiting there. you've only to follow me -- i'll lead the
way."
     "captain campion may be on patrol."
     "oh, i do hope he is," said bigwig. "i really do."
     "blackavar may not run at once. he will be as startled as the guards."
     "is it possible to warn him?"
     "no. his guards never leave him and they take him out to silflay alone."
     "for how long will he have to live like that?"
     "when he has been to every mark in turn, the council will kill him. we all feel
sure of that."
     "then that settles it. i won't go without him."
     "thlayli, you are very brave. are you cunning, too? all our lives will depend on
you tomorrow."
     "well, can you

     when she had gone, bigwig felt desperately tired and lonely. he tried to hold
in his mind that his friends were not far off and that he would see them again in
less than a day. but he knew that all efrafa lay between himself and hazel. his
thoughts broke up into the dismal fancies of anxiety. he fell into a half-dream, in
which captain campion turned into a seagull and flew screaming over the river,
until he woke in panic: and dozed again, to see captain chervil driving blackavar
before him toward a shining wire in the grass. and over all, as big as a horse in a
field, aware of all that passed from one end of the world to the other, brooded the
gigantic figure of general woundwort. at last, worn out with his apprehensions,
he passed into a deep sleep where even his fear could not follow, and lay without
sound or movement in the solitary burrow.

smell of a heavy cloud mass, still far off. he perceived it uneasily. almost all
animals are disturbed by the approach of thunder, which oppresses them with its
mounting tension and breaks the natural rhythm by which they live. bigwig's
inclination was to go back to his burrow, but he had little doubt that no mere
trifle like a thundery morning would be allowed to interfere with the timetable of
an efrafan mark.
     he was right. chervil was already at the entrance, squatting opposite blackavar
and his escort. he looked round as his officers came up the run.
     "come on, thlayli," he said. "sentries are out already. does the thunder worry
you?"
     "it does rather," replied bigwig.
     "it won't break today," said chervil. "it's a long way off yet. i'd give it until
tomorrow evening. anyway, don't let the mark see it affects you. nothing's to be
altered unless the general says so."
     "couldn't wake him up," said avens, with a touch of malice. "there was a doe

marli tharn,"* said chervil. "funny, i didn't think she was ready."
     "she wasn't," said bigwig. "i made a mistake. but if you remember, you asked
me to do what i could to get to know the awkward squad and bring them a bit
more under control, so i kept her talking for a time, just the same."
     "get anywhere?"
     "hard to say, really," said bigwig, "but i'll keep at it."
     he spent the time while the mark went out in deciding upon the best and
quickest way to enter the hole and attack blackavar's escort. he would have to put
one of them out of action in no time at all and then go straight for the other, who
would be that much less unprepared. if he had to fight him, it would be better to
avoid doing it between blackavar and the mouth of the hole, for blackavar would
be as bewildered as the rest and might bolt back down the run. if he was going to
bolt anywhere he must bolt outward. of course, with any luck, the second guard
might make off underground without fighting at all, but one c

her in the hollow with thethuthinnang. most of the mark did not appear to be
unduly affected by the thunder, which was still distant, as chervil had said. the
two does, however, were subdued and nervous. bigwig told them what he had
arranged with kehaar.
     "but will this bird really attack the sentries?" asked thethuthinnang. "i've
never heard of anything like that."

     "it will, i promise you. get the does together as soon as silflay begins this
evening. when i come out with blackavar, the sentries will be running for cover."
     "and which way do we run?" asked thethuthinnang.
     bigwig took them well out into the field, so that they could see the distant arch
in the embankment about four hundred yards away.
     "we're bound to meet campion," said thethuthinnang. "you know that?"
     "i believe he had some trouble stopping blackavar," replied bigwig. "so i'm
sure he won't be good enough for me and the bird. look, there's avens bringing
in the sentries -- we'll have to

go. now, don't worry. chew your pellets and get
some sleep. if you can't sleep, sharpen up your claws: you may need them."
     the mark went underground and blackavar was taken away by the escort.
bigwig returned to his burrow and tried to put the coming evening out of his
mind. after some time he gave up the idea of spending the day alone. he made a
round of the lower burrows, joined a game of bob-stones, heard two stories and
told one himself, passed hraka in the ditch and then, on an impulse, went to
chervil and obtained his consent to visit another mark. he wandered across the
crixa, found himself in the middle of the ni-frith silflay with the left flank

 mark
and went underground with them. their officers shared a single large burrow and
here he met some experienced veterans and listened with interest to their stories
of wide patrols and other exploits. in the mid-afternoon he came back to the
near hind relaxed and confident, and slept until one of the sentries woke him for
silflay.
     he went up the run. blackavar was already slumped in his alcove. squatting
beside chervil, bigwig watched the mark go out. hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang
passed him without a glance. they looked tense but steady. chervil followed the
last rabbit.
     bigwig waited until he was sure that chervil had had time to get well away
from the hole. then, with a last, quick look to where blackavar was sitting, he
went out himself. the bright sunset dazzled him and he sat up on his hind legs,
blinking and combing the fur along one side

back to your mark now."
     bigwig made his way into the field. the silflay was almost over, the sun had set
and it was growing dark. heavy clouds dimmed the afterlight. kehaar was
nowhere to be seen. the sentries came in and the mark began to go underground.
sitting alone in the grass, he waited until the last rabbit had disappeared. there
was still no sign of kehaar. he hopped slowly to the hole. entering, he knocked
into one of the police escort, who was blocking the mouth to make sure that
blackavar did not try to bolt as he was taken down.
     "get out of my way, you dirty little tale-bearing bloodsucker," said bigwig.
"now go and report that," he added over his shoulder, as he went down to his
burrow.

          -<*>-

     as the light faded from the thick sky, hazel slipped once more across the hard,
bare earth under the railway arch, came out on the north side and sat up to listen.
a few moments later fiver joined him and they crept a little way into the field,
toward efrafa. the air

     woundwort had every advantage. he sat secure at the junction of all paths,
seeing clearly down each, while he, bigwig, ludicrous in his efforts to measure up
to him as an enemy, clambered clumsily and ignorantly through the
undergrowth, betraying himself with every movement. he did not know how to

get in touch with kehaar again. even if he managed to do so, would hazel be able
to bring the rabbits a second time? perhaps they had already been spotted by
campion on patrol? to speak to blackavar would be suspect. to go near kehaar
would be suspect. through more holes than he could possibly stop, his secret was
leaking -- pouring -- out.
     there was worse to come.
     "thlayli," whispered hyzenthlay, "do you think you and i and thethuthinnang
could get away tonight? if we fought the sentry at the mouth of the run, we might
be able to get clear before a patrol could start after us."
     "why?" asked bigwig. "what makes you ask that?"
     "i'm frightened. we told the other does, you

go to sleep here for a little while and then go back and help thethuthinnang. keep
thinking of those high downs and all that i told you. we'll get there -- our
troubles won't last much longer."
     as she fell asleep beside him, bigwig wondered how on earth he was going to
fulfill this promise and whether they would be woken by the council police. "if we
are," he thought, "i'll fight until they tear me to bits. they'll make no blackavar
out of me."

          -<*>-

     when he woke, he found that he was alone in the burrow. for a moment he
wondered whether hyzenthlay had been arrested. then he felt sure that the
owslafa could not have removed her while he slept. she must have woken and
slipped back to thethuthinnang without disturbing him.
     it was a little before dawn, but the oppression in the air had not lessened. he
slipped up the run to the entrance. moneywort, the sentry on duty, was peering
uneasily out of the mout

 and down the fields and copses must be muted, pressed down
as though under a great, soft paw. nothing would be moving, for the day was
unpropitious and instincts were blurred and not to be trusted. it was a time to
crouch and be silent. but a fugitive would be safe. indeed, he could not hope for a
better chance.
     "o lord with the starlight ears, send me a sign!" said bigwig.
     he heard movement in the run behind him. it was the owslafa bringing up the
prisoner. in the thundery twilight, blackavar looked more sick and dejected than
ever. his nose was dry and the whites of his eyes showed. bigwig went out into
the field, pulled a mouthful of clover and brought it back.
     "cheer up," he said to blackavar. "have some clover."
     "that's not allowed, sir," said one of the escort.
     "oh, let him have it, bartsia," said the other. "there's no one to see. it's hard
enough for everyone on a day like this, let alone the prisoner."
     blackavar ate the clover and bigwig took up his usual

away anyway. but you must admit it's gone."
     "probably all that prancing about as we came up to it," said chervil sourly. "we
must have looked completely mad. what on earth will the mark think? anyway,
now we're out here, we may as well go round the sentries."
     "i'll stop and feed, if you don't mind," said bigwig. "i didn't get much last
night, you know."

          -<*>-

     bigwig's luck was not altogether out. later that morning, quite unexpectedly,
he came upon a chance to talk to blackavar alone. he had been through the
sweltering burrows, finding everywhere quick breathing and feverish pulses; and

he was just wondering whether he could not plausibly go and press chervil to ask
the council's permission for the mark to spend part of the day in the bushes
above ground -- for that might very well bring some sort of opportunity with it --
when he began to feel the need to pass hraka. no rabbit passes hraka
underground: and, like schoolchildren who know that they cannot very well be

approached the hole that led into the ditch, he found two or three young bucks
loitering in the run and, as usual, set himself to act his part as convincingly as he
could.
     "why are you hanging about here?" he asked.
     "the prisoner's escort are up at the hole and they turned us back, sir,"
answered one. "they're not letting anyone out for the moment."
     "not to pass hraka?" said bigwig.
     "no, sir."
     indignant, bigwig made his way to the mouth of the hole. here he found
blackavar's escort talking to the sentry on duty.
     "i'm afraid you can't go out for the moment, sir," said bartsia. "the prisoner's
in the ditch, but he won't be long."
     "neither shall i," said bigwig. "just get out of the way, will you?" he pushed
bartsia to one side and hopped into the ditch.
     the day had become even more lowering and overcast. blackavar was
squatting a little way off, under an overhanging plume of cow parsley. the flies
were walking on his shreds of ears, but he seemed not

 to notice them. bigwig
went along the ditch and squatted beside him.
     "blackavar, listen," he said quickly. "this is the truth, by frith and the black
rabbit. i am a secret enemy of efrafa. no one knows this but you and a few of the
mark does. i'm going to escape with them tonight and i'm going to take you as
well. don't do anything yet. when the time comes i'll be there to tell you. just
brace up and get yourself ready."
     without waiting for an answer, he moved away as though to find a better spot.
even so, he was back at the hole before blackavar, who evidently meant

orders, don't you?"
     "have you told avens?"
     "i haven't time to go looking for avens; he's not in his burrow. go and alert the
sentries yourself. send someone to find avens and someone else to tell bartsia
that blackavar won't be wanted this evening. then sit on those holes -- and the
hraka holes, too -- with every sentry you've got. for all i know, there may be some
plot to make a break-out. we arrested nelthilta as quietly as we could, but the
mark are bound to realize what's happened. if necessary you're to get rough, do
you see? now i'm off."
     "right," said bigwig. "i'll get busy at once."
     he followed chervil to the top of the run. the sentry at the hole was marjoram.

rvil pass, bigwig came up behind him and looked out
into the overcast.
     "did chervil tell you?" he said. "silflay's early tonight, on account of the
weather. the orders are that we're to get on with it at once."
     he waited for marjoram's reply. if chervil had already told him that no one
was to go out, it would be necessary to fight him. but after a moment marjoram
said, "have you heard any thunder yet?"
     "get on with it at once, i said," answered bigwig. "go down and get blackavar
and the escort up, and be quick, too. we'll need to get the mark out immediately
if they're to feed before the storm breaks."
     marjoram went and bigwig hurried back to his own burrow. hyzenthlay had
lost no time. three or four does were crammed into the burrow itself and nearby,
in a side run, thethuthinnang was crouching with several more. all were silent
and frightened and one or two were close to the stupefaction of terror.
     "this is no time to go tharn," said bigwig. "your lives dep

listen, now. blackavar and the police guards will be up directly. marjoram will
probably come up behind them and you must find some excuse to keep him
talking. soon after, you'll hear fighting, because i'm going to attack the police
guards. when you hear that, come up as fast as you can and follow me out into
the field. don't stop for anything."
     as he finished speaking, he heard the unmistakable sound of blackavar and the
guards approaching. blackavar's weary, dragging gait was like that of no other
rabbit. without waiting for the does to reply, bigwig returned to the mouth of the
run. the three rabbits came up in single file, bartsia leading.
     "i'm afraid i've brought you up here for nothing," said bigwig. "i've just been
told that silflay's canceled for this evening. have a look outside and you'll see
why."
     as bartsia went to look out of the hole, bigwig slipped quickly between him
and blackavar.
     "well, it looks very stormy,

certainly," said bartsia, "but i shouldn't have
thought--"
     "now, blackavar!" cried bigwig, and leaped on bartsia from behind.
     bartsia fell forward out of the hole with bigwig on top of him. he was not a
member of the owslafa for nothing and was reckoned a good fighter. as they
rolled over on the ground, he turned his head and sank his teeth in bigwig's
shoulder. he had been trained to get a grip at once and to hold it at all costs.
more than once in the past this had served him well. but in fighting a rabbit of
bigwig's strength and courage it proved a mistake. h

en, ignoring the pain in his shoulder, forced himself upward. he felt
bartsia's closed teeth come tearing out through his flesh and then he was
standing above him as he fell back on the ground, kicking helplessly. bigwig
leaped clear. it was plain that bartsia's haunch was injured. he struggled, but
could not get up.
     "think yourself lucky," said bigwig, bleeding and cursing, "that i don't kill
you."

     without waiting to see what bartsia would do, he jumped back into the hole.
he found blackavar grappling with the other guard. just beyond them,
hyzenthlay was coming up the run with thethuthinnang behind her. bigwig gave
the guard a tremendous cuff on the side of the head, which knocked him clear
across the run and into the prisoner's alcove. he picked himself up, panting, and
stared at bigwig without a word.
     "don't move," said bigwig. "there'll be worse to come if you do. blackavar, are
you all right?"
     "yes, sir," said blackavar, "but what do we do now?"
     "follow me," sai

 if there was a patrol between him and the iron road they
would not get past it without loss unless they came closer together. he would
have to collect them, despite the delay. then another thought came to him. if they
could get out of sight, their pursuers might be puzzled, for the rain and the failing
light would make tracking difficult.
     the rain was falling faster now and the wind was rising. over on the evening
side, a hedge ran down the length of the field toward the iron road. he saw
blackavar nearby and ran across to him.
     "i want everyone the other side of that hedge," he said. "can you get hold of
some of them and bring them that way?"
     bigwig remembered that blackavar knew nothing except that they were on the
run. there was no time to explain about hazel and the river.
     "go straight to that ash tree in the hedge," he said, "and take all the does you
can pick up on the way. get through to the other side and i'll be there as soon as
you are."

     "what do you know about a bird?" said woundwort, turning to chervil.
     "i reported it, sir," replied chervil. "you'll not forget, sir, that i reported the
bird--"
     there was a scuffling outside the crowded council burrow and avens came
pushing his way in.
     "the new officer, sir!" he cried. "he's gone! taken a crowd of the mark does

to kill him if necessary. but now that he actually saw him at his side, disregarding
the storm and the mud, self-possessed as he led his patrol, no more than four
strong, into the thick of a pack of desperate runaways, he could feel only what a
pity it was that the two of them should be enemies and how much he would have
liked to have taken campion with him out of efrafa.
     "go away," he said. "don't try to stop us, campion. i don't want to hurt you."
     he glanced to his other side. "blackavar, get the does to close up. if there are
any stragglers the patrol will jump on them."
     "you'd do better to give in now," said campion, still running beside him. "i
shan't let you out of my sight, wherever you go. there's an escape patrol on the
way -- i heard the signal. when they get here you won't stand a chance. you're
bleeding badly now."

toward them by himself, snarling with fury. behind him came the patrol. in one
quick glance bigwig recognized chervil, avens and groundsel. with them were
several more, including a heavy, savage-looking rabbit whom he guessed to be
vervain, the head of the council police. it crossed his mind that if he were to run,
immediately and alone, they would probably let him go as he had come, and feel
glad to be so easily rid of him. certainly the alternative was to be killed. at this
moment blackavar spoke.
     "never mind, sir," he said. "you did your very best and it nearly came off. we
may even be able to kill one or two of them before it's finished. some of these
does can fight well when they're put to it."
     bigwig rubbed his nose quickly against blackavar's mutilated ear and sat back
on his haunches as woundwort came up to them.
     "you dirty little beast," said woundwort. "i hear you've attacked one of the
council police and broken his leg. we'll settle with you here. there's n

o pieces close above, which deepened and
turned to enormous blows of dissolution. then the rain fell like a waterfall. in a
few seconds the ground was covered with water and over it, to a height of inches,
rose a haze formed of a myriad minute splashes. stupefied with the shock, unable
even to move, the sodden rabbits crouched inert, almost pinned to the earth by
the rain.
     a small voice spoke in bigwig's mind.
     "your storm, thlayli-rah. use it."
     gasping, he struggled up and pushed blackavar with his foot.
     "come on," he said, "get hold of hyzenthlay. we're going."
     he shook his head, trying to blink the rain out of his eyes. then it was no
longer blackavar who was crouching in front of him but woundwort, drenched in
mud and rain, glaring and scrabbling in the silt with his great claws.
     "i'll kill you myself," said woundwort.
     his long front teeth were bared like the fangs of a rat. afraid, bigwig watched
him closely. he knew that woundwort, with all the advantage

in the rain.
     "meester pigvig, ees rabbits come!"
     sights and feelings swirled through bigwig as though in a dream. the things
that were happening no longer seemed connected by anything except his own
dazed senses. he heard kehaar screaming as he dived again to attack vervain. he
felt the rain pouring cold into the open gash in his shoulder. through the curtain
of rain he glimpsed woundwort dodging among his officers and urging them back
into the ditch on the edge of the field. he saw blackavar striking at campion and
campion turning to run. then someone beside him was saying, "hullo, bigwig.
bigwig! bigwig! what do you want us to do?" it was silver.
     "where's hazel?" he said.
     "waiting at the boat. i say, you're wounded! what--"
     "then get these does down there," said bigwig.
     all was confusion. in ones and twos the does, utterly bemused and scarcely
able to move or to understand what was said to them, were urged into getting up
and stumbling their way down the field.

e hazel saw what
kehaar meant. if the punt did pass under the bridge without sticking, it would do

so by no more than a claw's breadth. any creature above the level of the sides
would be struck and perhaps knocked into the river. he scuttered through the
warm bilgewater to the other end and pushed his way up among the wet, crowded
rabbits.
     "get down in the bottom! get down in the bottom!" he said. "silver, hawkbit --
all of you. never mind the water. you, and you -- what's your name? oh,
blackavar, is it? -- get everyone into the bottom. be quick."
     like bigwig, he found that the efrafan rabbits obeyed him at once. he saw
kehaar fly up from his perch and disappear over the wooden rails. the concrete
abutments projected from each bank, so that the narrowed river ran slightly
faster under the bridge. the punt had been drifting broadside on, but now one
end swung forward, so that hazel lost his bearings and found that he was no
longer looking at the bridge but at the bank. as he hesitat

closed.
     "good old kehaar!" said hazel, gazing with satisfaction round the fetid
solitude. "i should have trusted him."
     as he spoke, a third rabbit came swimming out from under the bridge. the
sight of him, struggling in the current like a fly in a spider's web, filled them both

with fear. to watch another in danger can be almost as bad as sharing it. the
rabbit fetched up against the grating, drifted a little way along it, found the
bottom and crawled out of the turbid water. it was blackavar. he lay on his side
and seemed unaware of hazel and pipkin when they came up to him. after a little
while, however, he began to cough, vomited some water and sat up.
     "are you all right?" asked hazel.
     "more or less," said blackavar. "but have we got to do much more tonight, sir?
i'm very tired."
     "no, you can rest here," said hazel. "but why did you risk it on your own? we
might already have gone under, for all you knew."
     "i thought you gave an order," replied blackavar.

"i see," said hazel. "well, at that rate you're going to find us a sloppy lot, i'm
afraid. was there anyone else who looked like coming when you jumped in?"
     "i think they're a bit nervous," answered blackavar. "you can't blame them."
     "no, but the trouble is that anything can happen," said hazel, fretting. "they
may all go tharn, sitting there. the men may come back. if only we could tell
them it's all right--"
     "i think we can, sir," said blackavar. "unless i'm wrong, it's only a matter of
slipping up the bank there and down the other side. shall i go?"
     hazel was disconcerted. from what he had gathered, this was a disgraced
prisoner from efrafa -- not even a member of the owsla, apparently -- and he had
just said that he felt exhausted. he was going to take some living up to.
     "we'll both go," he said. "hlao-roo, can you stay here and keep a lookout? with
any luck, they'll start coming through to you. help them if you can."

hazel and blackavar slipped through the dripping undergrowth. the grass
track which crossed the bridge ran above them, at the top of a steep bank. they
climbed the bank and looked out cautiously from the long grass at the verge. the
track was empty and there was nothing to be heard or smelled. they crossed it
and reached the end of the bridge on the upstream side. here the bank dropped
almost sheer to the river, some six feet below. blackavar scrambled down without
hesitation, but hazel followed more slowly. just above the bridge, between it and
a thorn bush upstream, was a ledge of turf which overhung the water. out in the
river, a few feet away, the punt lay against the weedy piers.
     "silver!" said hazel. "fiver! come on, get them into the water. it's all right
below the bridge. get the does in first, if you can. there's no time to lose. the
men may come back."
     it was no easy matter to rouse the torpid, bewildered does an

speedwell followed, but as fiver was about to go silver stopped him.
     "if all our bucks go, hazel," he said, "the does will be left alone and i don't
think they'll manage it."
     "they'll obey thlayli, sir," said blackavar, before hazel could reply. "i think
he's the one to get them started."
     bigwig was still lying in the bilgewater, in the place he had taken up when they
came to the first bridge. he seemed to be asleep, but when silver nuzzled him he
raised his head and looked about in a dazed manner.

     "oh, hello, silver," he said. "i'm afraid this shoulder of mine's going to be a
bother. i feel awfully cold, too. where's hazel?"
     silver explained. bigwig got up with difficulty and they saw that h

bleeding. he limped to the thwart and climbed on it.
     "hyzenthlay," he said, "your friends can't be any wetter, so we'll get them to
jump in now. one by one, don't you think? then there'll be no risk of them
scratching or hurting each other as they swim."
     in spite of what blackavar had said, it was a long time before everyone had left
the boat. there were in fact ten does altogether -- though none of the rabbits
knew the number -- and although one or two responded to bigwig's patient
urging, several were so much exhausted that they remained huddled where they
were, or looked stupidly at the water until others were brought to take their place.
from time to time bigwig would ask one of the bucks to give a lead and in this

thrayonlosa, was clearly in a bad way and blackberry and thethuthinnang swam
through together, one in front of her and one behind.
     as darkness closed in, the rain stopped. hazel and blackavar went back to the
bank of the pool below the bridge. the sky cleared and the oppression lifted as
the thunder moved away eastward. but it was fu inlé before bigwig himself came
through the bridge with silver and fiver. it was as much as ever he could do to
keep afloat, and when he reached the grating he rolled over in the water, belly
uppermost, like a dying fish. he drifted into the shallows and, with silver's help,
pulled himself out. hazel and several of the others were waiting for him, but

cut them short with a flash of his old bullying manner. "come on, get out of the
way," he said. "i'm going to sleep now, hazel, and frith help you if you say i'm
not."
     "that's how we go on, you see," said hazel to the staring blackavar. "you'll get
used to it after a bit, now, let's look for somewhere dry that no one else has found
and then perhaps we can sleep, too."
     every dry spot among the undergrowth seemed to be crowded with exhausted,
sleeping rabbits. after searching for a time they found a fallen tree trunk, from
the underside of which the bark had pulled away. they crept beneath the twigs
and leaves, settled themselves in the smooth, curved trough -- which soon took on
some of the warmth of their bodies -- and s

     shortly afterward the rabbits set out across the park to the north. bigwig soon
found that he was not up to a long journey. his wound was painful and the
shoulder muscle would not stand hard use. hazel was still lame and the does,
though willing and obedient, showed that they knew little about the life of hlessil.
it was a trying time.
     in the days that followed -- days of clear sky and fine weather -- blackavar
proved his worth again and again, until hazel came to rely on him as much as on
any of his veterans. there was a great deal more to him than anyone could have
guessed. when bigwig had determined not to come out of efrafa without
blackavar, he had been moved entirely by pity for a miserable, helpless victim of
woundwort's ruthlessness. it turned out, however, that blackavar, when not
crushed by humiliation and ill-treatment, was a good cut above the ordinary. his
story was an unusual one. his mo

he had been killed on wide patrol. blackavar, proud of his father, had grown up
with the resolve to become an officer in the owsla. but together with this -- and
paradoxically -- there had come to him from his mother a certain resentment
against efrafa and a feeling that they should have no more of him than he cared
to give them. captain mallow, to whose mark -- the right fore -- he had been
sent on trial, had praised his courage and endurance but had not failed to notice
the proud detachment of his nature. when the right flank needed a j

unior officer
to help captain chervil, it was avens and not blackavar who had been selected by

the council. blackavar, who knew his own worth, felt convinced that his mother's
blood had prejudiced the council against him. while still full of his wrongs he
had met hyzenthlay and made himself a secret friend and adviser of the
discontented does in the right fore. he had begun by urging them to try to get
the council's consent to their leaving efrafa. if they had succeeded they would
have asked for him to be allowed to go with them. but when the does' deputation
to the council failed, blackavar turned to the idea

hazard and have another shot. now, free among these easy-going strangers, he
saw himself as a trained efrafan using his skill to help them in their need.
although he did all that he was told, he did not hesitate to make suggestions as
well, particularly when it came to reconnoitering and looking for signs of danger.
hazel, who was ready to accept advice from anybody when he thought it was
good, listened to most of what he said and was content to leave it to bigwig -- for
whom, naturally, blackavar entertained a tremendous respect -- to see that he did
not overreach himself in his warm-hearted, rather candid zeal.
     after two or three days of slow, careful journeying, with many halts in cover,
they found themselves, late one afternoon, once more in sight of caesar's belt,
but further west than before, close to a little copse at the top of some rising
ground. everyone was tired and when they had fed -- "evening silflay every day,
just as you promised," said hyzenthlay to bigwig -- blueb

 are 'ready for mudder,' as kehaar would say, and
that's the real reason why bluebell and the rest are prepared to be at the trouble
of digging scrapes. surely it'll be all right at that rate, won't it? you know what
they say -- 'rabbit underground, rabbit safe and sound.'"
     "well, you may be right," said fiver. "that vilthuril's a beautiful doe. i'd like a
chance to get to know her better. after all, it's not natural to rabbits, is it? -- on
and on day after day."
     later, however, when blackavar returned with dandelion from a patrol they
had undertaken on their own initiative, he came out more strongly against the
idea.
     "this is no place to stop, hazel-rah," he said. "no wide patrol would bivouac
here. it's fox country. we ought to try to get further before dark."
     bigwig's shoulder had been hurting him a good deal during the afternoon and
he felt low and surly. it seemed to him that blackavar was being clever at other

people's expense. if he got his way they would have to g

o on, tired as they were,
until they came to somewhere which was suitable by efrafan standards. there
they would be as safe -- no more and no less -- than they would have been if they
had stayed at this copse; but blackavar would be the clever fellow who had saved
them from a fox that had never existed outside his own fancy. his efrafan
scoutcraft act was getting to be a bore. it was time someone called his bluff.
     "there are likely to be foxes anywhere about the downs," said bigwig sharply.
"why is this fox country more than anywhere else?"
     tact was a quality which blackavar valued about as much as bigwig did; and
now he made the worst possible reply.
     "i can't exactly tell you why," he said. "i've f

ormed a strong impression, but it's
hard to explain quite what it's based on."
     "oh, an impression, eh?" sneered bigwig. "did you see any hraka? pick up any
scent? or was it just a message from little green mice singing under a toadstool?"
     blackavar felt hurt. bigwig was the last rabbit he wanted to quarrel with.
     "ye think i'm a fool, then," he answered, his efrafan accent becoming more
marked. "no, there was neether hraka ner scent, but i still think that this is a
place where a fox comes. on these patrols we used to do, ye know, we--"
     "did you see or smell anything?" said bigwig to dandelion.
     "er -- well, i'm not really quite sure," said dandelion. "i mean, blackavar
seems to know an awful lot about patrolling and he asked

 me whether i didn't feel
a sort of--"
     "well, we can go on like this all night," said bigwig. "blackavar, do you know
that earlier this summer, before we had the benefit of your experience, we went
for days across every kind of country -- fields, heather, woods, downs -- and never
lost one rabbit?"
     "it's the idea of scrapes, that's all," said blackavar apologetically, "new scrapes
get noticed; and digging can be heard a surprisingly long way, ye know."
     "let him alone," said hazel, before bigwig could speak again. "you didn't get
him out of efrafa to bully him. look, blackavar, i suppose i've got to decide this. i
think you're probably right and there is a certain amount of risk. but we're at risk
all the time until we get back to our warren and everyone's so tired that i think we
might just as well stop here for a day or two. we shall be

those two, right away under the bank there. they feel they can -- oh, great frith!"
     as he spoke a tawny shape, dog-like, sprang out of the overhanging nut bushes
as silently as light from behind a cloud. it landed between the two does, grabbed
one by the neck and dragged her up the bank in a flash. the wind veered and the
reek of fox came over the grass. with stamping and flashing of tails every rabbit
on the slope dashed for cover.
     hazel and bluebell found themselves crouched with blackavar. the efrafan
was matter-of-fact and detached.
     "poor little beast," he said. "you see, their instincts are weakened by life in the
mark. fancy feeding under bushes on the windward side of a wood! never mind,
hazel-rah, these things happen. but look, i tell you what. unless there are two
hombil, which would be very bad luck, we've got till ni-frith at least to get away.
that homba won't be hunting any more for some time. i suggest we all move on
as soon as we can."
     with a word of agreem

ent, hazel went out to call the rabbits together. they
made a scattered but swift run to the northeast, along the edge of a field of
ripening wheat. no one spoke of the doe. they had covered more than three
quarters of a mile before bigwig and hazel halted to rest and to make sure that no
one had fallen behind. blackavar came up with hyzenthlay, bigwig said,
     "you told us how it would be, didn't you? and i was the one who wouldn't
listen."
     "told you?" said blackavar. "i don't understand."
     "that there was likely to be a fox."
     "i don't remember, i'm afraid. but i don't see that any of us could possibly
have known. anyway, what's a doe more or less?"
     bigwig looked at him in astonishment, but blackavar, apparently unconcerned
either to stress what he had said or to break off the talk, simply began to nibble
the grass. bigwig, puzzled moved away and himself began to feed a little distance
off, with hyzenthlay and hazel.
     "what's he getting at
 
 ___________________________
 
?" he asked after a while. "you were all there when he
warned us, two nights ago, that there was likely to be a fox. i treated him badly."
     "in efrafa," said hyzenthlay, "if a rabbit gave advice and the advice wasn't
accepted, he immediately forgot it and so did everyone else. blackavar thought
what hazel decided; and whether it turned out later to be right or wrong was all
the same. his own advice had never been given."
     "i can believe that," said bigwig. "efrafa! ants led by a dog! but we're not in
efrafa now. has he really forgotten that he warned us?"
     "probably he really has. but whether or not, you'd never get him to admit that
he warned you or to listen while you told him he'd been right. he could no more
do that than pass hraka underground."
     "but you're an

t about the homba now, bigwig -- it
can't be altered -- and try to -- hello, who's this?"
     they were coming to a thicket of juniper and dog roses, tangled at ground level
with nettles and trails of bryony on which the berries were now beginning to
ripen and turn red. as they stopped to pick a line into the undergrowth, four big
rabbits appeared out of the long grass and sat looking down at them. one of the
does, coming up the slope a little way behind, stamped and turned to bolt. they
heard blackavar check her sharply.
     "well, why don't you answer his question, thlayli?" said one of the rabbits.
"who am i?"
     there was a pause. then hazel spoke.
     "i can see they're efrafans because they're marked," he said. "is that
woundwort?"
     "no," said blackavar, at his shoulder. "that's captain campion."
     "i see," said hazel. "well, i've heard of you, campion. i don't know whether
you mean us any harm, but the best thing you can do is to let well alone. as far as
we're concerned, our

i've sent for the white bird, hazel," he said quietly.
     as a piece of bluff it was effective. they saw campion look upward nervously
and another of the patrol glanced back to the cover of the bushes.
     "what you're saying is stupid," said hazel to campion. "there are a lot of us
here and unless you've got more rabbits than i can see, we're too many for you."
     campion hesitated. the truth was that for once in his life he had acted rashly.
he had seen hazel and bigwig approaching, with blackavar and one doe behind
them. in his eagerness to have something really worthwhile to show on his return
to the council, he had jumped to the conclusion that they were alone. the
efrafans usually kept fairly close together in the open and it had not occurred to

campion that other rabbits might straggle more widely. he had seen a golden
opportunity to attack -- perhaps kill -- the detestable thlayli and blackavar,
together with their one companion -- who seemed to be lame -- and bring the doe

otherwise we shall kill you."
     "very well," said hazel. "bring your whole patrol into the open and we'll do as
you say."
     by this time a considerable number of rabbits was coming up the slope.
campion and his patrol looked at them in silence but made no move.
     "you'd better stay where you are," said hazel at length. "if you try to interfere
with us it will be the worse for you. silver and blackberry, take the does and go
on. the rest of us will join you."
     "hazel-rah," whispered blackavar, "the patrol must be killed -- all of them.
they mustn't report back to the general."
     this had also occurred to hazel. but as he thought of the dreadful fight and the
four efrafans actually torn to pieces -- for that was what it would mean -- he
could not find it in his heart to do it. like bigwig, he felt a reluctant liking for
campion. besides, it would take some doing. quite probably some of his own
rabbits would be killed -- certainly wounded. they would not reach the
honeycomb that ni

ght and they would leave a fresh blood trail wherever they
went. apart from his dislike of the whole idea, there were disadvantages that
might be fatal.
     "no, we'll let them alone," he replied firmly.
     blackavar was silent and they sat watching campion as the last of the does
disappeared through the bushes.
     "now," said hazel, "take your patrol and go the same way that you saw us
come. don't speak -- go."
     campion and the patrol made off downhill and hazel, relieved to be rid of
them so easily, hurried after silver, with the others close behind.
     once through the belt, they made excellent progress. after the rest of a day
and a half the does were in good shape. the promise of an end to the

journey that
night and the thought that they had escaped both the fox and the patrol made
them eager and responsive. the only cause of delay was blackavar, who seemed
uneasy and kept hanging about in the rear. at last, in the late afternoon, hazel
sent for him and told him to go ahead, on the line of the path they were following,
and look out for the long strip of the beech hanger in the dip on the morning side.
blackavar had not been gone very long before he came racing back.
     "hazel-rah, i've been quite close to that wood you spoke of," he said, "and
there are two rabbits playing about on a patch of short grass just outside it."
     "i'll come and see," said hazel. "dandelion, you come, too, will you?"
     as they ran down the hill to the right of the track, hazel fairly skipped to
recognize the beech hanger. he noticed one or two yellow leaves and a faint touch
of bronze here and there in the green boug

others? did you get any does? is everyone all right?"
     "they'll be here very soon," said hazel. "yes, we've got a lot of does and
everyone who went has come back. this is blackavar, who's come out of efrafa."
     "good for him," said strawberry. "oh, hazel-rah, we've watched at the end of
the wood every evening since you went. holly and boxwood are all right -- they're
back at the warren: and what do you think? clover's going to kindle. that's fine,
isn't it?"
     "splendid," said hazel. "she'll be the first. my goodness, we've had a time, i
can tell you. and so i will -- what a story! -- but it must wait a bit. come on -- let's
go and bring the others in."

rhythm of feeding, digging and sleeping. several fresh runs and burrows were
made. the does, who had never dug in their lives before, enjoyed the work. both
hyzenthlay and thethuthinnang told hazel that they had had no idea how much
of their frustration and unhappiness in efrafa had been due simply to not being
allowed to dig. even clover and haystack found that they could manage pretty
well and boasted that they would bear the warren's first litters in burrows that
they had dug themselves. blackavar and holly became close friends. they talked a
great deal about their different ideas of scouting and tracking, and made some
patrols together, more for their own satisfaction than because there was any real
need. one early morning they persuaded silver to come with them and traveled

over a mile to the outskirts of kingsclere, returning with a tale of mischief and
feasting in a cottage garden. blackavar's hearing had weakened since the
mutilation of his ears; but holly found that his power of

with blackavar, was lolloping and nibbling close by. "he doesn't eat it."

anything and change it five times a day. ask him again fu inlé -- he'll tell you
something else."
     "if you're right, then i'm wrong and we can all forget it," said hazel. "but i'm
going to get to the bottom of this. someone must go and see. i'd go myself, but
i've got no speed with this leg."
     "well, leave it for tonight, anyway," said bigwig. "we can--"

     "someone must go and see," repeated hazel firmly. "a good patroller, too.
blackavar, go and get holly for me, will you?"
     "i'm here, as it happens," said holly, who had come along the top of the bank
while hazel was speaking. "what's the trouble, hazel-rah?"
     "there's a rumor of strangers on the down, on the morning side," replied
hazel, "and i wish i knew more. can you and blackavar run over that way -- say,
as far as the top of the combe -- and find out what's going on?"
     "yes, of course, hazel-rah," said holly. "if there really are some other rabbits
there, we'd

more."
     "it depends who they are," said hazel. "that's what i want to find out. go at
once, holly, will you? somehow it worries me not to know."
     holly and blackavar had hardly set off when speedwell appeared above
ground. he had an excited, triumphant look which attracted everyone's attention
immediately. he squatted in front of hazel and looked round him in silence, to
make sure of his effect.
     "you've finished the hole?" asked hazel.
     "never mind the hole," answered speedwell. "i didn't come up to say that.

young fellows across to the farm and chase the cats out of the barn to get an
appetite. well, it'll come. i say, this grass is as dry as horsehair on barbed wire,
isn't it? what about a run down the hill to the fields -- just you and i and fiver?
corn's been cut, you know, and there should be good pickings. i expect they're
going to burn off the field, but they haven't done it yet."
     "no, we must wait a bit," said hazel. "i want to hear what holly and blackavar
have to say when they come in."
     "that needn't keep you long," replied bigwig. "here they come already, unless
i'm much mistaken. straight down the open track, too! not bothered about
keeping hidden, are they? what a rate they're going!"

     "there's something wrong," said hazel, staring at the approaching rabbits.
     holly and blackavar reached the long shadow of the wood at top speed, as
though they were being pursued. the watchers expected them to slow down as
they came to the bank,

 but they kept straight on and appeared actually to be
going to run underground. at the last moment holly stopped, looked about him
and stamped twice. blackavar disappeared down the nearest hole. at the
stamping, all the rabbits above ground ran for cover.
     "here, wait a minute," said hazel, pushing past pipkin and hawkbit as they
came across the grass. "holly, what's the alarm? tell us something, instead of
stamping the place to pieces. what's happened?"
     "get the holes filled in!" gasped holly. "get everyone underground! there's not
a moment to lose." his eyes rolled white and he panted foam over his chin.
     "is it men, or what? there's no

thing to be seen, heard or smelled. come on, tell
us something and stop gibbering, there's a good chap."
     "it'll have to be quick, then," said holly. "that combe -- it's full of rabbits from
efrafa."
     "from efrafa? fugitives, do you mean?"
     "no," said holly, "not fugitives. campion's there. we ran right into him and
three or four more that blackavar recognized. i believe woundwort's there
himself. they've come for us -- don't make any mistake about that."
     "you're sure it's more than a patrol?"
     "i'm certain," answered holly. "we could smell them; and we heard them, too
-- below us in the combe. we wondered what so many rabbits could be doing
there and we were going down to see when we suddenly came face to face with
campion. we looked at him and he looked at us and then i realized what it must
mean and we turned and ran. he didn't

 follow us -- probably because he'd had no
orders. but how long will it take them to get here?"
     blackavar had returned from underground, bringing silver and blackberry.
     "we ought to leave at once, sir," he said to hazel. "we might be able to get
quite a long way before they come."
     hazel looked about him. "anyone who wants to go can go," he said. "i shan't.
we made this warren ourselves and frith only knows what we've been through on
account of it. i'm not going to leave it now."
     "neither am i," said bigwig. "if i'm for the black rabbit, there's one or two

e."
     there was a short silence.
     "holly's right to want to stop the holes," went on hazel. "it's the best thing to
do. we fill the holes in, good and thorough. then they have to dig us out. the
warren's deep. it's under a bank, with tree roots all through it and over the top.
how long can all those rabbits stay on the down without attracting elil? they'll
have to give it up."
     "you don't know these efrafans," said blackavar. "my mother used to tell me
what happened at nutley copse. it would be better to go now."
     "well, go on, then," answered hazel. "i'm not stopping you. and i'm not
leaving this warren. it's my home." he looked at hyzenthlay, heavy with young,
who was sitting in the mouth of the nearest hole and listening to the talk. "how
far do you think she'll get? and clover -- do we leave her or what?"

adversity, he had nearly succeeded in hurting the gull when he leaped at him out
of the close cover by the plank bridge. then, when he had his quarry cornered in a
place where kehaar could not have done a great deal to help them, they had
suddenly shown their own cunning greater than his, and left him bewildered on
the bank. he had overheard the very word -- tharn -- spoken by one of his officers
to another as they returned to efrafa through the rain. thlayli, blackavar and the
does of the near hind had vanished. he had tried to stop them and he had
conspicuously failed.
     for a great part of that night woundwort remained awake, considering what
was best to be done. the following day he called a council meeting. he pointed
out that it would be no good taking an expedition down the river to look for
thlayli unless it were strong enough to defeat him if it found him. that would
mean taking several officers and a number of the owsla. there would be the risk
of

oo distant to be attacked, especially since no time
would have to be spent in searching for it. it did not appear to be very large and
could probably be surprised.
     the news put an end to all opposition and brought both council and owsla
back under woundwort's undisputed control. several of the officers were for
starting at once, but woundwort, now that he was sure of his followers and his
enemy, took his time. having learned from campion that he had actually come
face to face with thlayli, blackavar and the rest, he decided to wait some little
while, in case they might be on their guard. besides, he wanted time both to
reconnoiter the way to watership and to organize the expedition. his idea was
that, if possible, they should make the journey in one day. this would forestall
any possible rumors of their approach. to satisfy himself that they could do this
and still be fit to fight when they arrived, he took campion and two others, and
himself covered the three and a half miles to the down

down. many were tired and, in spite of their tremendous respect for woundwort,
there was a certain feeling that they had come a long way from home. they were
ordered to take cover, feed, rest and wait for sunset.
     the place was deserted, except for yellowhammers and a few mice pattering
about in the sun. some of the rabbits went to sleep in the long grass. the slope
was already in shadow when campion came running down with the news that he
had come face to face with blackavar and holly in the upper part of the combe.
     woundwort was annoyed. "what made them come traipsing over here, i
wonder?" he said. "couldn't you have killed them? now we've lost surprise."
     "i'm sorry, sir," said campion. "i wasn't really alert at the time and i'm afraid
they were a bit too quick for me. i didn't pursue them because i wasn't sure
whether you'd want me to."
     "well, it may not make much difference," said woundwort. "i don't see what
they can do. but they'll try to do som

you want."
     "were you on the riverbank in the rain?" said woundwort.
     "yes, i was."
     "what was left unfinished there will be finished now," said woundwort. "we
are going to destroy you."
     "you won't find it easy," replied the other. "you'll take fewer rabbits home than
you brought. we should both do better to come to terms."
     "very well," said woundwort. "these are the terms. you will give back all the
does who ran from efrafa and you will hand over the deserters thlayli and
blackavar to my owsla."
     "no, we can't agree to that. i've come to suggest something altogether different
and better for us both. a rabbit has two ears; a rabbit has two eyes, two nostrils.
our two warrens ought to be like that. they ought to be together -- not fighting.
we ought to make other warrens between us -- start one between here and efrafa,
with rabbits from both sides. you wouldn't lose by that, you'd gain. we both
would. a lot of your rabbits are unhappy now and it's all you can do to cont

     "i haven't time to sit here talking nonsense," said woundwort. "you're in no
position to bargain with us. there's nothing more to be said. thistle, go back and
tell captain vervain i want everyone up here at once."
     "and this rabbit, sir," asked campion. "shall i kill him?"
     "no," replied woundwort. "since they've sent him to ask our terms, he'd better
take them back. -- go and tell thlayli that if the does aren't waiting outside your
warren, with him and blackavar, by the time i get down there, i'll tear the throat
out of every buck in the place by ni-frith tomorrow."
     the lame rabbit seemed about to reply, but woundwort had already turned
away and was explaining to campion what he was to do. neither of them
bothered to watch the lame rabbit as he limped back by the way he had come.

cuffed and mauled and barely got out with their lives. the sight of them did
nothing to encourage vervain's party, who were reluctant to dig and made little
headway during the darkness before moonrise.
     groundsel, who felt that he ought to set an example, himself dug his way into
the loose, fallen soil of one of the bank runs. plowing over the soft earth like a fly
on summer butter and holding his head clear, he suddenly found himself face to
face with blackavar, who sank his front teeth into his throat. groundsel, with no
freedom to use his weight, screamed and kicked out as best he could. blackavar
hung on and groundsel -- a heavy rabbit, like all the efrafan officers -- dragged
him forward a short distance before he could rid himself of his grip. blackavar
spat out a mouthful of fur and jumped clear, clawing with his front paws. but
groundsel had already gone. he was lucky not to have been more severely
wounded.
