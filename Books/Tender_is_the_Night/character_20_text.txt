amblers diced on ‘tapestry’ mats.
the air was full of politics, and the slap of cards.
tommy was at a table laughing his martial laugh: ‘umbuh—ha-ha!
um-buh—ha-ha!’ as a rule, he drank little;
courage was his game and his companions were always a
little afraid of him. recently an eighth of the area of his
skull had been removed by a warsaw surgeon and was knitting
under his hair, and the weakest person in the café could
have killed him with a flip of a knotted napkin.
‘—this is prince chillicheff—‘ a battered, powder-gray
russian of fifty, ‘—and mr. mckibben—and mr. hannan—‘
the latter was a lively ball of black eyes and hair, a clown;
and he said immediately to dick:
‘the first thing before we shake hands—what do you
mean by fooling around with my aunt?’
‘why, i—‘
‘you heard me. what are you doing here in munich anyhow?’
‘um-bah—ha-ha!’ laughed tommy.
‘haven’t you got aunts of your own? why don’t you fool
with them?’
dick laughed, whereupon t

he looked at dick, played chords, from time to time muttering,
‘your aunts,’ and, in a dying cadence, ‘i didn’t say aunts
anyhow. i said pants.’
‘well, how’re you?’ repeated tommy. ‘you don’t look
so—‘ he fought for a word, ‘—so jaunty as you used to, so
spruce, you know what i mean.’
the remark sounded too much like one of those irritating
accusations of waning vitality and dick was about to
retort by commenting on the extraordinary suits worn by
tommy and prince chillicheff, suits of a cut and pattern
fantastic enough to have sauntered down beale street on a
sunday—when an explanation was forthcoming.

‘i see you are regarding our clothes,’ said the prince. ‘we
have just come out of russia.’
‘these were made in poland by the court tailor,’ said
tommy. ‘that’s a fact—pilsudski’s own tailor.’
‘you’ve been touring?’ dick asked.
they laughed, the prince inordinately meanwhile clapping
tommy on the back.

dick waited for an explanation. it came from mr. mckibben
in two words.
‘they escaped.’
‘have you been prisoners in russia?’
‘it was i,’ explained prince chillicheff, his dead yellow
eyes staring at dick. ‘not a prisoner but in hiding.’
‘did you have much trouble getting out?’
‘some trouble. we left three red guards dead at the
border. tommy left two—‘ he held up two fingers like a
frenchman—‘i left one.’
‘that’s the part i don’t understand,’ said mr. mckibben.
‘why they should have objected to your leaving.’
hannan turned from the piano and said, winking at the
others: ‘mac thinks a marxian is somebody who went to st.

you sure he’s dead?’
hannan turned around to mckibben: ‘it wasn’t the racquet
club he crawled to—it was the harvard club. i’m sure
he didn’t belong to the racquet.’
‘the paper said so,’ mckibben insisted.
‘it must have been a mistake. i’m quite sure.’
‘beaten to death in a speakeasy.’
‘but i happen to know most of the members of the racquet
club,’ said hannan. ‘it must have been the harvard

club.’
dick got up, tommy too. prince chillicheff started out
of a wan study of nothing, perhaps of his chances of ever
getting out of russia, a study that had occupied him so long
that it was doubtful if he could give it up immediately, and
joined them in leaving.
‘abe north beaten to death.’
on the way to the hotel, a journey of which dick was
scarcely aware, tommy said:
‘we’re waiting for a tailor to finish some suits so we can
get to paris. i’m going into stock-broking and they wouldn’t
take me if i showed up like this. everybo
