  king john. now, say, chatillon, what would france with us?
  chatillon. thus, after greeting, speaks the king of france
    in my behaviour to the majesty,
    the borrowed majesty, of england here.
  elinor. a strange beginning- 'borrowed majesty'!
  king john. silence, good mother; hear the embassy.

  king john. bear mine to him, and so depart in peace;
    be thou as lightning in the eyes of france;
    for ere thou canst report i will be there,
    the thunder of my cannon shall be heard.
    so hence! be thou the trumpet of our wrath
    and sullen presage of your own decay.
    an honourable conduct let him have-

    how that ambitious constance would not cease
    till she had kindled france and all the world
    upon the right and party of her son?
    this might have been prevented and made whole
    with very easy arguments of love,
    which now the manage of two kingdoms must
    with fearful bloody issue arbitrate.

    to parley or to fight, therefore prepare.
  king philip. how much unlook'd for is this expedition!
  austria. by how much unexpected, by so much
    we must awake endeavour for defence,
    for courage mounteth with occasion.
    let them be welcome then; we are prepar'd.

  king john. peace be to france, if france in peace permit
    our just and lineal entrance to our own!
    if not, bleed france, and peace ascend to heaven,
    whiles we, god's wrathful agent, do correct
    their proud contempt that beats his peace to heaven!
  king philip. peace be to england, if that war return

    england we love, and for that england's sake
    with burden of our armour here we sweat.

england. king john's palace

enter king john, pembroke, salisbury, and other lords

  king john. here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
    and look'd upon, i hope, with cheerful eyes.
  pembroke. this once again, but that your highness pleas'd,
    was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
    and that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
    the faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
    fresh expectation troubled not the land
    with any long'd-for change or better state.
  salisbury. therefore, to be possess'd with double

pomp,
    to guard a title that was rich before,
    to gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
    to throw a perfume on the violet,
    to smooth the ice, or add another hue
    unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
    to seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
    is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
  pembroke. but that your royal pleasure must be done,
    this act is as an ancient tale new told
    and, in the last repeating, troublesome,
    being urged at a time unseasonable.
  salisbury. in this the antique and well-noted face
    of plain old form is much disfigured;
    and like a shifted wind unto a sail
    it makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
    startles and frights consideration,
    makes sound opinion sick, and truth suspected,
    for putting on so new a fashion'd

  pembroke. when workmen strive to do better than well,
    they do confound their skill in covetousness;
    and oftentimes excusing of a fault
    doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse,
    as patches set upon a little breach
    discredit more in hiding of the fault
    than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
  salisbury. to this effect, before you were new-crown'd,
    we breath'd our counsel; but it pleas'd your highness
    to overbear it; and we are all well pleas'd,
    since

  king john. some reasons of this double coronation
    i have possess'd you with, and think them strong;
    and more, more strong, when lesser is my fear,
    i shall indue you with. meantime but ask
    what you would have reform'd that is not well,
    and well shall you perceive how willingly
    i will both hear and grant you your requests.
  pembroke. then i, as one that am the tongue of these,
    to sound the purposes of all their hearts,
    both for myself and them- but, chief of all,
    your safety, for the which myself and them
    bend their best studies, heartily request
    th' enfranchisement of arthur, whose restraint
    doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
    to break into this dangerous argument:

  pembroke. this is the man should do the bloody deed:
    he show'd his warrant to a friend of mine;
    the image of a wicked heinous fault
    lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
    doth show the mood of a much troubled breast,
    and i do fearfully believe 'tis done
    what we so fear'd he had a charge to do.

    between his purpose and his conscience,
    like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set.

  pembroke. and when it breaks, i fear will issue thence
    the foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
  king john. we cannot hold mortality's strong hand.
    good lords, although my will to give is living,
    the suit which you demand is gone and dead:
    he tells us arthur is deceas'd to-night.
  salisbury. indeed, we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
  pembroke. indeed, we heard how near his death he was,
    before the child himself felt he was sick.
    this must be answer'd either here or hence.
  king john. why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
    think you i bear the shears of destiny?
    have i commandment on the pulse of life?
  salisbury. it is apparent foul-play; and 'tis shame
    that greatness should so grossly offer it.
    so thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
  pembroke. stay yet, lord salisbury, i'll go with thee
