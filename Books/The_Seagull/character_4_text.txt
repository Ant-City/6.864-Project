the sea-gull



the scene is laid in the park on sorin’s estate. a broad avenue of trees leads away from the audience toward a lake which lies lost in the depths of the park. the avenue is obstructed by a rough stage, temporarily erected for the performance of amateur theatricals, and which screens the lake from view. there is a dense growth of bushes to the left and right of the stage. a few chairs and a little table are placed in front of the stage. the sun has just set. jacob and some other workmen are heard hammering and coughing on the stage

masha. it is not that. [she takes snuff] i am touched by your affection, but i cannot return it, that is all. [she offers him the snuff-box] will you take some?

medviedenko. no, thank you. [a pause.]

masha. the air is sultry; a storm is brewing for to-night. you do nothing but moralise or else talk about money. to you, poverty is the greatest misfortune that can befall a man, but i think it is a thousand times easier to go begging in rags than to—you wouldn’t understand that, though.

sorin leaning on a cane, and treplieff come in.

sorin. for some reason, my boy, country life doesn’t suit me, and i am sure i shall never get used to it. last night i went to bed at ten and woke at nine this morning, feeling as if, from oversleep, my brain had stuck to my skull. [laughing] and yet i accidentally dropped off to sleep again after dinner, and feel utterly done up at this moment. it is like a nightmare.

treplieff. there is no doubt that you should live in town. [he catches sight of m

asha and medviedenko] you shall be called when the play begins, my friends, but you must not stay here now. go away, please.

sorin. miss masha, will you kindly ask your father to leave the dog unchained? it howled so last night that my sister was unable to sleep.

masha. you must speak to my father yourself. please excuse me; i can’t do so. [to medviedenko] come, let us go.

medviedenko. you will let us know when the play begins?

masha and medviedenko go out.

sorin. i foresee that that dog is going to howl all night again. it is always this way in the country; i have never been able to live as i like here. i come down for a month’s holiday, to rest and all, and am plagued so by their nonsense that i long to escape after the first day. [laughing] i have always been glad to get away from this place, but i have been retired now, and this was the only place i had to come to. willy-nilly, one must live somewhere.

jacob. [to treplieff] we are going to take a

treplieff. very well, but you must be back in ten minutes.

jacob. we will, sir.

treplieff. [looking at the stage] just like a real theatre! see, there we have the curtain, the foreground, the background, and all. no artificial scenery is needed. the eye travels direct to the lake, and rests on the horizon. the curtain will be raised as the moon rises at half-past eight.

sorin. splendid!

treplieff. of course the whole effect will be ruined if nina is late. she should be here by now, but her father and stepmother watch her so closely that it is like stealing her from a prison to get her away from home. [he straightens sorin’s collar] your hair and beard are all on end. oughtn’t you to have them trimmed?

sorin. [smoothing his beard] they are the tragedy of my existence. even when i was young i always looked as if i were drunk, and all. women have never liked me.

[sitting down] why is my sister out of temper?

treplieff. why? because she is jealous and bored. [sitting down beside sorin] she is not acting this evening, but nina is, and so she has set herself against me, and against the performance of the play, and against the play itself, which she hates without ever having read it.

sorin. [laughing] does she, really?

treplieff. yes, she is furious because nina is going to have a success on this little stage. [looking at his watch] my mother is a psychological curiosity. without doubt brilliant and talented, capable of sobbing over a novel, of reciting all nekrasoff’s poetry by heart, and of nursing the sick like an angel of heaven, you should see what happens if any one begins praising duse to her! she alone must be praised and written about, raved over, her marvellous actin

sorin. you have taken it into your head that your mother dislikes your play, and the thought of it has excited you, and all. keep calm; your mother adores you.

treplieff. [pulling a flower to pieces] she loves me, loves me not; loves—loves me not; loves—loves me not! [laughing] you see, she doesn’t love me, and why should she? she likes life and love and gay clothes, and i am already twenty-five years old; a sufficient reminder to her that she is no longer young. when i am away she is only thi

sorin. but we can’t do without a theatre.

treplieff. no, but we must have it under a new form. if we can’t do that, let us rather not have it at all. [looking at his watch] i love my mother, i love her devotedly, but i think she leads a stupid life. she always has this man of letters of hers on her mind, and the newspapers are always frightening her to death, and i am tired of it. plain, human egoism sometimes speaks in my heart, and i regret that my mother is a famous actress. if she were an or

sorin. tell me, by the way, what is trigorin like? i can’t understand him, he is always so silent.

treplieff. trigorin is clever, simple, well-mannered, and a little, i might say, melancholic in disposition. though still under forty, he is surfeited with praise. as for his stories, they are—how shall i put it?—pleasing, full of talent, but if you have read tolstoi or zola you somehow don’t enjoy trigorin.

nina. i have been in a fever all day, i was so afraid my father would prevent my coming, but he and my stepmother have just gone driving. the sky is clear, the moon is rising. how i hurried to get here! how i urged my horse to go faster and faster! [laughing] i am so glad to see you! [she shakes hands with sorin.]

sorin. oho! your eyes look as if you had been crying. you mustn’t do that.

nina. it is nothing, nothing. do let us hurry. i must go in half an hour. no, no, for heaven’s sake do not urge me to stay. my father doesn’t know i am here.

treplieff. as a matter of fact, it is time to begin now. i must call the audience.

dorn. [shrugging his shoulders] i can’t say. there has been a great deal that was admirable in my relations with women. in me they liked, above all, the superior doctor. ten years ago, you remember, i was the only decent doctor they had in this part of the country—and then, i have always acted like a man of honour.

paulina. [seizes his hand] dearest!

dorn. be quiet! here they come.

arkadina comes in on sorin’s arm; also trigorin, shamraeff, medviedenko, and masha.

shamraeff. she acted most beautifully at the poltava fair in 1873; she was really magnificent. but tell me, too, where tchadin the comedian is now? he was inimitable as rasplueff, better than sadofski. where is he now?

arkadina. don’t ask me where all those antediluvians are! i know nothing about them. [she sits down.]

sorin. there won’t be anything in twice ten thousand years.

treplieff. then let them now show us that nothingness.

arkadina. yes, let them—we are asleep.

he would like to say more, but waves his hand instead, and goes out to the left.

arkadina. what is the matter with him?

sorin. you should not handle youthful egoism so roughly, sister.

arkadina. what did i say to him?

sorin. you hurt his feelings.

arkadina. but he told me himself that this was all in fun, so i treated his play as if it were a comedy.

sorin. nevertheless—-

arkadina. now it appears that he has produced a masterpiece, if you please! i suppose it was not meant to amuse us at all, but that he arranged the performance and fumigated us with sulphur to demonstrate to us how plays should be written, and

sorin. he had hoped to give you pleasure.

arkadina. is that so? i notice, though, that he did not choose an ordinary play, but forced his decadent trash on us. i am willing to listen to any raving, so long as it is not meant seriously, but in showing us this, he pretended to be introducing us to a new form of art, and inaugurating a new era. in my opinion, there was nothing new about it, it was simply an exhibition of bad temper.

arkadina. bravo! bravo! we were quite charmed by your acting. with your looks and such a lovely voice it is a crime for you to hide yourself in the country. you must be very talented. it is your duty to go on the stage, do you hear me?

nina. my father is waiting for me.

arkadina. how cruel he is, really. [they kiss each other] then i suppose we can’t keep you, but it is very hard indeed to let you go.

nina. if you only knew how hard it is for me to leave you all.

arkadina. somebody must see you home, my pet.

shamraeff. no, i really can’t, sir. the granary is full of millet, and i am afraid thieves might break in if the dog were not there. [walking beside medviedenko] yes, a whole octave lower: “bravo, silva!” and he wasn’t a singer either, just a simple church cantor.

sorin comes in leaning on a cane, with nina beside him. medviedenko follows, pushing an arm-chair.

nina. [shrugging her shoulders] shall i? is it so interesting?

masha. [with suppressed rapture] when he recites, his eyes shine and his face grows pale. his voice is beautiful and sad, and he has the ways of a poet.

sorin begins to snore.

dorn. pleasant dreams!

arkadina. peter!

sorin. eh?

arkadina. are you asleep?

sorin. not a bit of it. [a pause.]

arkadina. you don’t do a thing for your health, brother, but you really ought to.

dorn. the idea of doing anything for one’s health at sixty-five!

sorin. one still wants to live at sixty-five.

dorn. [crossly] ho! take some camomile tea.

arkadina. i think a journey to some watering-place would be good for him.

dorn. why, yes; he might go as well as not.

arkadina. you don’t understand.

dorn. there is nothing to understand in this case; it is quite clear.

medviedenko. he ought to give up smoking.

sorin. what nonsense! [a pause.]

dorn. no, that is not nonsense. wine and tobacco destroy the individuality. after a cigar or a glass of vodka you are no longer peter sorin, but peter sorin plus somebody else. your ego breaks in two: you begin to think of yourself in the third person.

sorin. it is easy for you to condemn smoking and drinking; you have known what life is, but what about me? i have served in the department of justice for twenty-eight years, but i have never lived, i have never had any experiences. you are satiated with life, and that is why you have an inclination for philosophy, but i want to live, and that is why i drink my wine for dinner and smoke cigars, and all.

dorn. that is a trifle, your honour.

sorin. you judge her like a man who has obtained all he wants in life.

arkadina. oh, what could be duller than this dear tedium of the country? the air is hot and still, nobody does anything but sit and philosophise about life. it is pleasant, my friends, to sit and listen to you here, but i had rather a thousand times sit alone in the room of a hotel learning a role by heart.

nina. [with enthusiasm] you are quite right. i understand how you feel.

sorin. of course it is pleasanter to live in town.

arkadina. yes, that is what i had planned to do.

shamraeff. hm—that is splendid, but how do you intend to get there, madam? we are hauling rye to-day, and all the men are busy. what horses would you take?

arkadina. what horses? how do i know what horses we shall have?

sorin. why, we have the carriage horses.

shamraeff. the carriage horses! and where am i to find the harness for them? this is astonishing! my dear madam, i have the greatest respect for your talents, and would gladly sacrifice ten years of my life for you, but i cannot let you have any horses to-day.

arkadina. but if i must go to town? what an extraordinary state of affairs!

she goes out to the left, in the direction of the wharf. in a few minutes she is seen entering the house, followed by trigorin, who carries a bucket and fishing-rod.

sorin. [losing his temper] what the deuce did he mean by his impudence? i want all the horses brought here at once!

nina. [to paulina] how could he refuse anything to madame arkadina, the famous actress? is not every wish, every caprice even, of hers, more important than any farm work? this is incredible.

dorn. how tiresome people are! your husband deserves to be thrown out of here neck and crop, but it will all end by this old granny sorin and his sister asking the man’s pardon. see if it doesn’t.

dorn. no, it is all right.

paulina. i am tortured by jealousy. of course you are a doctor and cannot escape from women. i understand.

dorn. [to nina, who comes toward him] how are things in there?

nina. madame arkadina is crying, and sorin is having an attack of asthma.

dorn. let us go and give them both some camomile tea.

nina. [lost in thought] yes, the sea-gull. [a pause] i beg you to let me see you alone for two minutes before you go.

she goes out to the left. at the same moment arkadina comes in from the right, followed by sorin in a long coat, with his orders on his breast, and by jacob, who is busy packing.

arkadina. stay here at home, you poor old man. how could you pay visits with that rheumatism of yours? [to trigorin] who left the room just now, was it nina?

sorin. you are going away, and i shall be lonely without you.

arkadina. what would you do in town?

sorin. oh, nothing in particular, but somehow—[he laughs] they are soon to lay the corner-stone of the new court-house here. how i should like to leap out of this minnow-pond, if but for an hour or two! i am tired of lying here like an old cigarette stump. i have ordered the carriage for one o’clock. we can go away together.

[a pause] i am going away, and so shall never find out why constantine shot himself, but i think the chief reason was jealousy, and the sooner i take trigorin away, the better.

sorin. there were—how shall i explain it to you?—other reasons besides jealousy for his act. here is a clever young chap living in the depths of the country, without money or position, with no future ahead of him, and with nothing to do. he is ashamed and afraid of being so idle. i am devoted to him and he is fond of me, but nevertheless he feels that he is useless here, that he is little more than a dependent in this house. it is the pride in him.

arkadina. he is a misery to me! [thoughtfully]

[laughing] and it wouldn’t hurt the youngster to sow a few wild oats; let him go abroad, say, for a time. it wouldn’t cost much.

arkadina. yes, but—ho

sorin laughs.

arkadina. i haven’t indeed.

sorin. [whistles] very well. forgive me, darling; don’t be angry. you are a noble, generous woman!

arkadina. [weeping] i really haven’t the money.

sorin. if i had any money of course i should let him have some myself, but i haven’t even a penny. the farm manager takes my pension from me and puts it all into the farm or into cattle or bees, and in that way it is always lost for ever. the bees die, the cows die, they never let me have a horse.

arkadina. of course i have some money, but i am an actress and my expenses for dress alone are enough to bankrupt me.

sorin. i am all right. [he smiles and drinks some water] it is all over now.

treplieff. [to his mother] don’t be frightened, mother, these attacks are not dangerous; my uncle often has them now. [to his uncle] you must go and lie down, uncle.

sorin. yes, i think i shall, for a few minutes. i am going to moscow all the same, but i shall lie down a bit before i start. [he goes out leaning on his cane.]

medviedenko. [giving him his arm] do you know this riddle? on four legs in the morning; on two l

egs at noon; and on three legs in the evening?

sorin. [laughing] yes, exactly, and on one’s back at night. thank you, i can walk alone.

medviedenko. dear me, what formality! [he and sorin go out.]

arkadina. he gave me a dreadful fright.

treplieff. it is not good for him to live in the country. mother, if you would only untie your purse-strings for once, and lend him a thousand roubles! he could then spend a whole year in town.

arkadina. i have no money. i am an actress and not a banker. [a pause.]

treplieff. please change my bandage for me, mother, you do it so gently.

arkadina goes to the cupboard and takes out a box of bandages and a bottle of iodoform.

arkadina. the doc

ngly through the door on the right, and finally comes into the room. paulina comes in. medviedenko comes in.

paulina. [presenting arkadina with a little basket] here are some plums for the journey. they are very sweet ones. you may want to nibble something good on the way.

arkadina. you are very kind, paulina.

paulina. good-bye, my dearie. if things have not been quite as you could have wished, please forgive us. [she weeps.]

arkadina. it has been delightful, delightful. you mustn’t cry.

sorin comes in through the door on the left, dressed in a long coat with a cape, and carrying his hat and cane. he crosses the room.

sorin. come, sister, it is time to start, unless you want to miss the train. i am going to get into the carriage. [he goes out.]

medviedenko. i shall walk quickly to the station and see you off there. [he goes out.]

arkadina. good-bye, all! we shall meet again next summer if we live. [the maid servant, jacob, and the cook kiss her hand] don’t forget me. [she gives

ski house in moltchanofka street. i must go now. [a pause.]

nina. just one more minute!

trigorin. [in a low voice] you are so beautiful! what bliss to think that i shall see you again so soon! [she sinks on his breast] i shall see those glorious eyes again, that wonderful, ineffably tender smile, those gentle features with their expression of angelic purity! my darling! [a prolonged kiss.]

the curtain falls.

two years elapse between the third and fourth acts.






act iv

a sitting-room in sorin’s house, which has been converted into a writing-room for treplieff. to the right and left are doors leading into inner rooms, and in the centre is a glass door opening onto a terrace. besides the usual furniture of a sitting-room there is a writing-desk in the right-hand corner of the room. there is a turkish divan near the door on the left, and shelves full of books stand against the walls. books are lying scattered about on the windowsills and chairs. it is evening. the room is dimly light

come home, masha.

masha. you can go home if you want to.

medviedenko. your father won’t give me a horse.

masha. yes, he will; ask him.

medviedenko. i think i shall. are you coming home to-morrow?

masha. yes, yes, to-morrow.

she takes snuff. treplieff and paulina come in. treplieff is carrying some pillows and a blanket, and paulina is carrying sheets and pillow cases. they lay them on the divan, and treplieff goes and sits down at his desk.

masha. who is that for, mother?

paulina. mr. sorin asked to sleep in constantine’s room to-night.

masha. let me make the bed.

she makes the bed. paulina goes up to the desk and looks at the manuscripts lying on it. [a pause.]

medviedenko. well, i am going. good-bye, masha. [he kisses his wife’s hand] good-bye, mother. [he tries to kiss his mother-in-law’s hand.]

paulina. [crossly] be off, in god’s name!

treplieff shakes hands with him in silence, and medviedenko goes out.

paulina. [looking at the manuscripts] no one ever dreamed,

we have once left this place i shall forget it all. i shall tear my passion out by the roots. [the notes of a melancholy waltz are heard in the distance.]

paulina. constantine is playing. that means he is sad.

masha silently waltzes a few turns to the music.

masha. the great thing, mother, is not to have him continually in sight. if my simon could only get his remove i should forget it all in a month or two. it is a trifle.

dorn and medviedenko come in through the door on the left, wheeling sorin in an arm-chair.

medviedenko. i have six mouths to feed now, and flour is at seventy kopecks.

dorn. a hard riddle to solve!

medviedenko. it is easy for you to make light of it. you are rich enough to scatter money to your chickens, if you wanted to.

dorn. you think i am rich? my friend, after practising for thirty years, during which i could not call my soul my own for one minute of the night or day, i succeeded at last in scraping together one thousand roubles, all of which went, not long

ago, in a trip which i took abroad. i haven’t a penny.

masha. [to her husband] so you didn’t go home after all?

medviedenko. [apologetically] how can i go home when they won’t give me a horse?

masha. [under her breath, with bitter anger] would i might never see your face again!

sorin in his chair is wheeled to the left-hand side of the room. paulina, masha, and dorn sit down beside him. medviedenko stands sadly aside.

dorn. what a lot of changes you have made here! you have turned this sitting-room into a library.

masha. constantine likes to work in this room, because from it he can step out into the garden to meditate whenever he feels like it. [the watchman’s rattle is heard.]

sorin. where is my sister?

dorn. she has gone to the station to meet trigorin. she will so

on be back.

sorin. i must be dangerously ill if you had to send for my sister. [he falls silent for a moment] a nice business this is! here i am dangerously ill, and you won’t even give me any medicine.

dorn. what shall i prescribe for you? camomile tea? soda? quinine?

sorin. don’t inflict any of your discussions on me again. [he nods toward the sofa] is that bed for me?

paulina. yes, for you, sir.

sorin. thank you.

dorn. [sings] “the moon swims in the sky to-night.”

sorin. i am going to give constantine an idea for a story. it shall be called “the man who wished—l’homme qui a voulu.” when i was young, i wished to become an author; i failed. i wished to be an orator; i speak abominably, [exciting himself] with my eternal “and all, and all,” dragging each sentence on and on until i sometimes break out into a sweat all over. i wished to marry, and i didn’t; i wished to live in the city, and here i am ending my days in the country, and all.

dorn. you

wished to become state councillor, and—you are one!

sorin. [laughing] i didn’t try for that, it came of its own accord.

dorn. come, you must admit that it is petty to cavil at life at sixty-two years of age.

sorin. you are pig-headed! can’t you see i want to live?

dorn. that is futile. nature has commanded that every life shall come to an end.

sorin. you speak like a man who is satiated with life. your thirst for it is quenched, and so you are calm and indifferent, but even you dread death.

dorn. the fear of death is an animal passion which must be overcome. only those who believe in a future life and tremble for sins committed, can logically fear death; but you, for one thing, don’t believe in a future life, and for another, you haven’t committed any sins. you have served as a councillor for twenty-five years, that is all.

sorin. [l

aughing] twenty-eight years!

treplieff comes in and sits down on a stool at sorin’s feet. masha fixes her eyes on his face and never once tears them away.

dorn. we are keeping constantine from his work.

treplieff. no matter. [a pause.]

medviedenko. of all the cities you visited when you were abroad, doctor, which one did you like the best?

dorn. genoa.

treplieff. why genoa?

dorn. because there is such a splendid crowd in its streets. when you leave the hotel in the evening, and throw yourself into the heart of that throng, and move with it without aim or object, swep

ing in the fields a mile from here yesterday evening.

medviedenko. yes, i saw her. she was walking away from here in the direction of the village. i asked her why she had not been to see us. she said she would come.

treplieff. but she won’t. [a pause] her father and stepmother have disowned her. they have even put watchmen all around their estate to keep her away. [he goes with the doctor toward the desk] how easy it is, doctor, to be a philosopher on paper, and how difficult in real life!

sorin. she was a beautiful girl. even the state councillor himself was in love with her for a time.

dorn. you old lovelace, you!

shamraeff’s laugh is heard.

paulina. they are coming back from the station.

treplieff. yes, i hear my mother’s voice.

arkadina and trigorin come in, followed by shamraeff.

shamraeff. we all grow old and wither, my lady, while you alone, with your light dress, your gay spirits, and your grace, keep the secret of eternal youth.

arkadina. you are still trying to tur

trigorin. [to sorin] how do you do, peter? what, still ill? how silly of you! [with evident pleasure, as he catches sight of masha] how are you, miss masha?

masha. so you recognised me? [she shakes hands with him.]

trigorin. did you marry him?

masha. long ago.

trigorin. you are happy now? [he bows to dorn and medviedenko, and then goes hesitatingly toward treplieff] your mother says you have forgotten the past and are no longer angry with me.

treplieff gives him his hand.

arkadina. [to her son] here is a mag

masha. ninety-eight.

trigorin. see, my card is full.

arkadina. [gaily] bravo! bravo!

shamraeff. bravo!

arkadina. wherever he goes and whatever he does, that man always has good luck. [she gets up] and now, come to supper. our renowned guest did not have any dinner to-day. we can continue our game later. [to her son] come, constantine, leave your writing and come to supper.

treplieff. i don’t want anything to eat, mother; i am not hungry.

arkadina. as you please. [she wakes sorin] come to supper, peter. [she takes shamraeff’s arm] let me tell you about my reception in kharkoff.

paulina blows out the candles on the table, then she and dorn roll sorin’s chair out of the room, and all go out through the door on the left, except treplieff, who is left alone. treplieff prepares to write. he runs his eye over what he has already written.

treplieff. i have talked a great deal about new forms of art, but i feel myself gradually slipping into the beaten track. [he reads]
