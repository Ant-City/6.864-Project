female sex.

apart from the doctor's young wife, they were reduced almost exclusively
that season (for all that mme. verdurin herself was a thoroughly 'good'
woman, and came of a respectable middle-class family, excessively rich
and wholly undistinguished, with which she had gradually and of her own
accord severed all connection) to a young woman almost of a 'certain
class,' a mme. de crécy, whom mme. verdurin called by her christian
name, odette, and pronounced a 'love,' and to the pianist's aunt, who
looked as though she had, at one period, 'answered the bell': ladies
quite ignorant of the world, who in their social simplicity were so
easily led to believe that the princesse de sagan and the duchesse
de guermantes were obliged to pay large sums of money to other poor
wretches, in order to have anyone at their dinner-parties, that if
somebody had offered to procure them an invitation to the house of
either of those great dames, the old

until she had formed hers, his special duty being to carry out her
wishes and those of the 'faithful' generally, which he did with
boundless ingenuity.

"my dear, mme. de crécy has something to say to you. she would like to
bring one of her friends here, a m. swann. what do you say?"

"why, as if anybody could refuse anything to a little piece of
perfection like that. be quiet; no one asked your opinion. i tell you
that you are a piece of perfection."

"just as you like," replied odette, in an affected tone, and then went
on: "you know i'm not fishing for compliments."

"very well; bring your friend, if he's nice."

now there was no connection whatsoever between the 'little nucleus' and
the society which swann frequented, and a purely worldly man would
have thought it hardly worth his while, when occupying so exceptional
a position in the world, to seek an introduction to the verdurins. but
swann was so ardent a lover that, once he had got to know almost all the

tance, pervaded and warmly coloured by the
flickering light which he had slipped into its midst, seemed to him
beautiful and rare, now that he had incorporated in it a fresh love.

but while each of these attachments, each of these flirtations had been
the realisation, more or less complete, of a dream born of the sight of
a face or a form which swann had spontaneously, and without effort on
his part, found charming, it was quite another matter when, one day at
the theatre, he was introduced to odette de crécy by an old friend of
his own, who had spoken of her to him as a ravishing creature with whom
he might very possibly come to an understanding; but had made her out
to be harder of conquest than she actually was, so as to appear to be
conferring a special favour by the introduction. she had struck swann
not, certainly, as being devoid of beauty, but as endowed with a style
of beauty which left him indifferent, which aroused in him no desire,
which gave him, indeed, a sort of physical rep

recall and recreate the rest. since we possess its hymn, engraved on
our hearts in its entirety, there is no need of any woman to repeat the
opening lines, potent with the admiration which her beauty inspires, for
us to remember all that follows. and if she begin in the middle, where
it sings of our existing, henceforward, for one another only, we are
well enough attuned to that music to be able to take it up and follow
our partner, without hesitation, at the first pause in her voice.

odette de crécy came again to see swann; her visits grew more frequent,
and doubtless each visit revived the sense of disappointment which he
felt at the sight of a face whose details he had somewhat forgotten in
the interval, not remembering it as either so expressive or, in spite
of her youth, so faded; he used to regret, while she was talking to
him, that her really considerable beauty was not of the kind which he
spontaneously admired. it must be remarked that odette's face appeared

fancy of their designer or the rigidity of their material, the line
which led them to the knots of ribbon, falls of lace, fringes of
vertically hanging jet, or carried them along the bust, but nowhere
attached themselves to the living creature, who, according as the
architecture of their fripperies drew them towards or away from her
own, found herself either strait-laced to suffocation or else completely
buried.

but, after odette had left him, swann would think with a smile of her
telling him how the time would drag until he allowed her to come again;
he remembered the anxious, timid way in which she had once begged him
that it might not be very long, and the way in which she had looked at
him then, fixing upon him her fearful and imploring gaze, which gave her
a touching air beneath the bunches of artificial pansies fastened in
the front of her round bonnet of white straw, tied with strings of black
velvet. "and won't

you had gone."

no doubt, in thus remembering their conversations, in thinking about her
thus when he was alone, he did no more than call her image into being
among those of countless other women in his romantic dreams; but if,
thanks to some accidental circumstance (or even perhaps without that
assistance, for the circumstance which presents itself at the moment
when a mental state, hitherto latent, makes itself felt, may well have
had no influence whatsoever upon that state), the image of odette de
crécy came to absorb the whole of his dreams, if from those dreams
the memory of her could no longer be eliminated, then her bodily
imperfections would no longer be of the least importance, nor would the
conformity of her body, more or less than any other, to the requirements
of swann's taste; since, having become the body of her whom he loved, it
must henceforth be the only one capable of causing him joy or anguish.

it so happened that my grandfather had known--which was more than could

touch with the verdurins. "on guard! on guard!" he exclaimed
as he read it, "i am not at all surprised; swann was bound to finish up
like this. a nice lot of people! i cannot do what he asks, because, in
the first place, i no longer know the gentleman in question. besides,
there must be a woman in it somewhere, and i don't mix myself up in such
matters. ah, well, we shall see some fun if swann begins running after
the little verdurins."

and on my grandfather's refusal to act as sponsor, it was odette herself
who had taken swann to the house.

the verdurins had had dining with them, on the day when swann made his
first appearance, dr. and mme. cottard, the young pianist and his aunt,
and the painter then in favour, while these were joined, in the course
of the evening, by several more of the 'faithful.'

dr. cottard was never quite certain of the tone in which he ought to
reply to any observation, or whether the speaker was jesting or
in earnest. and so in any event he would embellish all hi

thing almost impossible to match.

when mme. verdurin had announced that they were to see m. swann that
evening; "swann!" the doctor had exclaimed in a tone rendered brutal
by his astonishment, for the smallest piece of news would always take
utterly unawares this man who imagined himself to be perpetually in
readiness for anything. and seeing that no one answered him, "swann! who
on earth is swann?" he shouted, in a frenzy of anxiety which subsided
as soon as mme. verdurin had explained, "why, odette's friend, whom she
told us about."

"ah, good, good; that's all right, then," answered the doctor, at once
mollified. as for the painter, he was overjoyed at the prospect of
swann's appearing at the verdurins', because he supposed him to be in
love with odette, and was always ready to assist at lovers' meetings.
"nothing amuses me more than match-making," he confided to cottard; "i
have been tremendously successful, even with women!"

in telling the verdurins that swann was extremely 'smart,' o

ugh for a moment only,
on meeting dr. cottard; for seeing him close one eye with an ambiguous
smile, before they had yet spoken to one another (a grimace which
cottard styled "letting 'em all come"), swann supposed that the doctor
recognised him from having met him already somewhere, probably in some
house of 'ill-fame,' though these he himself very rarely visited,
never having made a habit of indulging in the mercenary sort of love.
regarding such an allusion as in bad taste, especially before odette,
whose opinion of himself it might easily alter for the worse, swann
assumed his most icy manner. but when he learned that the lady next to
the doctor was mme. cottard, he decided that so young a husband would
not deliberately, in his wife's hearing, have made any allusion to
amusements of that order, and so ceased to interpret the doctor's
expression in the sense which he had at first suspected. the painter at
once invited swann to visit his studio with odette, and swann found him

that they place themselves in the hands of a higher authority which,
without putting them to the least inconvenience, can and will, by
uttering a word or by administering a tabloid, set them once again upon
their feet.

odette had gone to sit on a tapestry-covered sofa near the piano, saying
to mme. verdurin, "i have my own little corner, haven't i?"

and mme. verdurin, seeing swann by himself upon a chair, made him get
up. "you're not at all comfortable there; go along and sit by odette;
you can make room for m. swann there, can't you, odette?"

"what charming beauvais!" said swann, stopping to admire the sofa before
he sat down on it, and wishing to be polite.

"i am glad you appreciate my sofa," replied mme. verdu

it except the piano! i'm caught out every time i hear it; i think

the young pianist bent over her as he answered, smiling and underlining
each of his words as though he were making an epigram: "you are most
generous to me."

and while mme. verdurin was saying to her husband, "run and fetch him a
glass of orangeade; it's well earned!" swann began to tell odette how he
had fallen in love with that little phrase. when their hostess, who was
a little way off, called out, "well! it looks to me as though some one
was saying nice things to you, odette!" she replied, "yes, very
nice," and he found her simplicity delightful. then he asked for some
information about this vinteuil; what else he had done, and at what
period in his life he had composed the sonata;--what meaning the little
phrase could have had for him, that was what swann wanted most to know.

seeing that you were pulling my leg."

as for m. verdurin, finding it rather a strain to start laughing again
over so small a matter, he was content with puffing out a cloud of smoke
from his pipe, while he reflected sadly that he could never again hope
to keep pace with his wife in her atalanta-flights across the field of
mirth.

"d'you know; we like your friend so very much," said mme. verdurin,
later, when odette was bidding her good night. "he is so unaffected,
quite charming. if they're all like that, the friends you want to bring
here, by all means bring them."

m. verdurin remarked that swann had failed, all the same, to appreciate
the pianist's aunt.

"i dare say he felt a little strange, poor man," suggested mme.
verdurin. "you can't expect him to catch the tone of the house the first
time he comes; like cottard, who has been one of our little 'clan' now
for years. the first time doesn't count; it

"oh, very well; just as you like. provided he doesn't fail us at the
last moment."

greatly to mme. verdurin's surprise, he never failed them. he would go
to meet them, no matter where, at restaurants outside paris (not that
they went there much at first, for the season had not yet begun), and
more frequently at the play, in which mme. verdurin delig

s of mine went there once, who hadn't been told, and there
was the devil to pay."

as for m. verdurin, he did not fail to observe the distressing effect
upon his wife of the discovery that swann had influential friends of
whom he had never spoken.

if no arrangement had been made to 'go anywhere,' it was at the
verdurins' that swann would find the 'little nucleus' assembled, but
he never appeared there except in the evenings, and would hardly ever
accept their invitations to dinner, in spite of odette's entreaties.

"i could dine with you alone somewhere, if you'd rather," she suggested.

"but what about mme. verdurin?"

"oh, that's quite simple. i need only say that my dress wasn't ready, or
that my cab came late. there is always some excuse."

"how charming of you."

but swann said to himself that, if he could make odette feel (by
consenting to meet her only after dinner) that there were other
pleasures which he preferred to that of her company, then the desire
that she felt for his would

be all the longer in reaching the point of
satiety. besides, as he infinitely preferred to odette's style of beauty
that of a little working girl, as fresh and plump as a rose, with whom
he happened to be simultaneously in love, he preferred to spend the
first part of the evening with her, knowing that he was sure to see
odette later on. for the same reason, he would never allow odette to
call for him at his house, to take him on to the verdurins'. the little
girl used to wait, not far from his door, at a street corner; rémi, his
coachman, knew where to stop; she would jump in beside him, and hold him
in her arms until the carriage drew up at the verdurins'. he would enter
the drawing-room; and there, while mme. verdurin, pointing to the roses
which he had sent her that morning, said: "i am furious with you!" and
sent him to the place kept for him, by the side of odette, the

that he could now
discern in it some disenchantment. it seemed to be aware how vain, how
hollow was the happiness to which it shewed the way. in its airy grace
there was, indeed, something definitely achieved, and complete in
itself, like the mood of philosophic detachment which follows an
outburst of vain regret. but little did that matter to him; he looked
upon the sonata less in its own light--as what it might express, had,
in fact, expressed to a certain musician, ignorant that any swann or
odette, anywhere in the world, existed, when he composed it, and
would express to all those who should hear it played in centuries
to come--than as a pledge, a token of his love, which made even the
verdurins and their little pianist think of odette and, at the same
time, of himself--which bound her to him by a lasting tie; and at that
point he had (whimsically entreated by odette) abandoned the idea of
getting some 'professional' to play over to him the whole sonata, of
which he still knew no more th

it would happen, as often as not, that he had stayed so long outside,
with his little girl, before going to the verdurins' that, as soon as
the little phrase had been rendered by the pianist, swann would discover
that it was almost time for odette to go home. he used to take her back
as far as the door of her little house in the rue la pérouse, behind the
arc de triomphe. and it was perhaps on this account, and so as not to
demand the monopoly of her favours, that he sacrificed the pleasure (not
so essential to his well-being) of seeing her earlier in the evening,
of arriving with her at the verdurins', to the exercise of this other
privilege, for which she was grateful, of their leaving together; a

garden-beds or clung to the branches of the trees, the careless disarray
of the season, the assertion, in this man-made city, of a state of
nature, had all combined to add an element of mystery to the warmth, the
flowers, the luxury which he had found inside.

passing by (on his left-hand side, and on what, although raised some way
above the street, was the ground floor of the house) odette's bedroom,
which looked out to the back over another little street running parallel
with her own, he had climbed a staircase that went straight up between
dark painted walls, from which hung oriental draperies, strings of
turkish beads, and a huge japanese lantern, suspended by a silken cord
from the ceiling (which last, however, so that her visitors should not
have to complain of the want of any of the latest comforts of
western civilisation, was lighted by a gas-jet inside), to the two

uncommon, though by no means so large as the mammoth blossoms which
horticulturists have since succeeded in making grow. swann was
irritated, as a rule, by the sight of these flowers, which had then been
'the rage' in paris for about a year, but it had pleased him, on this
occasion, to see the gloom of the little lobby shot with rays of pink
and gold and white by the fragrant petals of these ephemeral stars,
which kindle their cold fires in the murky atmosphere of winter
afternoons. odette had received him in a tea-gown of pink silk, which
left her neck and arms bare. she had made him sit down beside her in one
of the many mysterious little retreats which had been contrived in the
various recesses of the room, sheltered by enormous palmtrees growing
out of pots of chinese porcelain, or by screens upon which were fastened
photographs and fans and bows of ribbon. she had said at once, "you're
not comfortable there; wait a minute, i'll arrange things for you," and

y eyes, which kept company, upon her mantelpiece, with a toad carved
in jade, she would pretend now to be shrinking from the ferocity of the
monsters or laughing at their absurdity, now blushing at the indecency
of the flowers, now carried away by an irresistible desire to run across
and kiss the toad and dromedary, calling them 'darlings.' and these
affectations were in sharp contrast to the sincerity of some of her
attitudes, notably her devotion to our lady of the laghetto who had
once, when odette was living at nice, cured her of a mortal illness, and
whose medal, in gold, she always carried on her person, attributing
to it unlimited powers. she poured out swann's tea, inquired "lemon
or cream?" and, on his answering "cream, please," went on, smiling, "a
cloud!" and as he pronounced it excellent, "you see, i know just how you
like it." this tea had indeed seemed to swann, just as it seemed to
her, something precious, and love is so far obliged to find some

cease with its passing, that when he left her, at seven o'clock, to go
and dress for the evening, all the way home, sitting bolt upright in
his brougham, unable to repress the happiness with which the afternoon's
adventure had filled him, he kept on repeating to himself: "what fun
it would be to have a little woman like that in a place where one could
always be certain of finding, what one never can be certain of finding,
a really good cup of tea." an hour or so later he received a note from
odette, and at once recognised that florid handwriting, in which an
affectation of british stiffness imposed an apparent discipline upon its
shapeless characters, significant, perhaps, to less intimate eyes
than his, of an untidiness of mind, a fragmentary education, a want of
sincerity and decision. swann had left his cigarette-case at her house.
"why," she wrote, "did you not forget your heart also? i should never
have let you have that back."

more important, perhaps, was a second visit which he pa

y between an historic portrait and a modern
original, whom it was not intended to represent. however that might be,
and perhaps because the abundance of impressions which he, for some time
past, had been receiving--though, indeed, they had come to him rather
through the channel of his appreciation of music--had enriched his
appetite for painting as well, it was with an unusual intensity
of pleasure, a pleasure destined to have a lasting effect upon his
character and conduct, that swann remarked odette's resemblance to the
zipporah of that alessandro de mariano, to whom one shrinks from giving
his more popular surname, now that 'botticelli' suggests not so much the
actual work of the master as that false and banal conception of it which
has of late obtained common currency. he no longer based his estimate
of the merit of odette's face on the more or less good quality of her
cheeks, and the softness and sweetness--as of carnation-petals--which,
he supposed, would greet his lips there, should h

threads, which his gazing eyes collected and wound together, following
the curving line from the skein to the ball, where he mingled the
cadence of her neck with the spring of her hair and the droop of her
eyelids, as though from a portrait of herself, in which her type was
made clearly intelligible.

he stood gazing at her; traces of the old fresco were apparent in
her face and limbs, and these he tried incessantly, afterwards, to
recapture, both when he was with odette, and when he was only thinking
of her in her absence; and, albeit his admiration for the florentine
masterpiece was probably based upon his discovery that it had been
reproduced in her, the similarity enhanced her beauty also, and rendered
her more precious in his sight. swann reproached himself with his
failure, hitherto, to estimate at her true worth a creature whom the
great sandro would have adored, and counted himself fortunate that his
pleasure in the contemplation of odette found a justi

system of aesthetic. he told himself that, in choosing the thought of
odette as the inspiration of his dreams of ideal happiness, he was not,
as he had until then supposed, falling back, merely, upon an expedient
of doubtful and certainly inadequate value, since she contained in
herself what satisfied the utmost refinement of his taste in art. he
failed to observe that this quality would not naturally avail to bring
odette into the category of women whom he found desirable, simply
because his desires had always run counter to his aesthetic taste. the
words 'florentine painting' were invaluable to swann. they enabled him
(gave him, as it were, a legal title) to introduce the image of odette
into a world of dreams and fancies which, until then, she had been
debarred from entering, and where she assumed a new and nobler form. and
whereas the mere sight of her in the flesh, by perpetually reviving his

her on the sure foundations of his aesthetic principles; while the kiss,
the bodily surrender which would have seemed natural and but moderately
attractive, had they been granted him by a creature of somewhat withered
flesh and sluggish blood, coming, as now they came, to crown his
adoration of a masterpiece in a gallery, must, it seemed, prove as
exquisite as they would be supernatural.

and when he was tempted to regret that, for months past, he had done
nothing but visit odette, he would assure himself that he was
not unreasonable in giving up much of his time to the study of an
inestimably precious work of art, cast for once in a new, a different,
an especially charming metal, in an unmatched exemplar which he would
contemplate at one moment with the humble, spiritual, disinterested mind
of an artist, at another with the pride, the selfishness, the sensual
thrill of a collector.

ks; and, adapting what he had already felt
to be beautiful, on aesthetic grounds, to the idea of a living woman,
he converted it into a series of physical merits which he congratulated
himself on finding assembled in the person of one whom he might,
ultimately, possess. the vague feeling of sympathy which attracts a
spectator to a work of art, now that he knew the type, in warm flesh
and blood, of jethro's daughter, became a desire which more than
compensated, thenceforward, for that with which odette's physical charms
had at first failed to inspire him. when he had sat for a long time
gazing at the botticelli, he would think of his own living botticelli,
who seemed all the lovelier in contrast, and as he drew towards him
the photograph of zipporah he would imagine that he was holding odette
against his heart.

it was not only odette's indifference, however, that he must take pains
to circumvent; it was also, not infrequently, his own; feeling that,

to have very much to say to him when they did meet, he was afraid
lest the manner--at once trivial, monotonous, and seemingly
unalterable--which she now adopted when they were together should
ultimately destroy in him that romantic hope, that a day might come when
she would make avowal of her passion, by which hope alone he had become
and would remain her lover. and so to alter, to give a fresh moral
aspect to that odette, of whose unchanging mood he was afraid of growing
weary, he wrote, suddenly, a letter full of hinted discoveries and
feigned indignation, which he sent off so that it should reach her
before dinner-time. he knew that she would be frightened, and that she
would reply, and he hoped that, when the fear of losing him clutched at
her heart, it would force from her words such as he had never yet heard
her utter: and he was right--by repeating this device he had won from
her the most affectionate let

never closed, he would begin to melt at the thought of the charming
creature whom he would see, as he entered the room, basking in that
golden light. here and there the figures of the guests stood out, sharp
and black, between lamp and window, shutting off the light, like those
little pictures which one sees sometimes pasted here and there upon a
glass screen, whose other panes are mere transparencies. he would try
to make out odette. and then, when he was once inside, without thinking,
his eyes sparkled suddenly with such radiant happiness that m. verdurin
said to the painter: "h'm. seems to be getting warm." indeed, her
presence gave the house what none other of the houses that he visited
seemed to possess: a sort of tactual sense, a nervous system which
ramified into each of its rooms and sent a constant stimulus to his
heart.

and so the simple and regular manifestations of a social organism,

daily encounters with odette, and enabled him to feign indifference to
the prospect of seeing her, or even a desire not to see her; in doing
which he incurred no very great risk since, even although he had written
to her during the day, he would of necessity see her in the evening and
accompany her home.

but one evening, when, irritated by the thought of that inevitable dark
drive together, he had taken his other 'little girl' all the way to the

verdurins', he was so late in reaching them that odette, supposing
that he did not intend to come, had already left. seeing the room bare
of her, swann felt his heart wrung by sudden anguish; he shook with the
sense that he was being deprived of a pleasure whose intensity he began
then for the first time to estimate, having always, hitherto, had that
certainty of finding it whenever he would, which (as in the case of
all our pleasures) reduced, if it did not altogether blind him to its
dimensions.

"did you notice the face he pulled when he saw that

verdurin asked his wife. "i think we may say that he's hooked."

"the face he pulled?" exploded dr. cottard who, having left the house
for a moment to visit a patient, had just returned to fetch his wife and
did not know whom they were discussing.

"d'you mean to say you didn't meet him on the doorstep--the loveliest of
swanns?"

"no. m. swann has been here?"

"just for a moment. we had a glimpse of a swann tremendously agitated.
in a state of nerves. you see, odette had left."

"you mean to say that she has gone the 'whole hog' with him; that she
has 'burned her boats'?" inquired the doctor cautiously, testing the
meaning of his phrases.

"why, of course not; there's absolutely nothing in it; in fact, between
you and me, i think she's making a great mistake, and behaving like a
silly little fool, which she is, incidentally."

"come, come, come!" said m. verdurin, "how on earth do you know that
there's 'nothing in it'? we haven't been there to see, have we

 not to have caught the sound of that unutterable
word which seemed to imply that it was possible for people to 'pose'
in her house, and, therefore, that there were people in the world who
'mattered more' than herself.

"anyhow, if there is nothing in it, i don't suppose it's because our
friend believes in her virtue. and yet, you never know; he seems to
believe in her intelligence. i don't know whether you heard the way he
lectured her the other evening about vinteuil's sonata. i am devoted
to odette, but really--to expound theories of aesthetic to her--the man
must be a prize idiot."

"look here, i won't have you saying nasty things about odette," broke in
mme. verdurin in her 'spoiled child' manner. "she is charming."

"there's no reason why she shouldn't be charming; we are not saying
anything nasty about her, only that she is not the embodiment of either
virtue or intellect. after all," he turned to the painter, "does it
matter so very much whether she is virtuous or not? you can't tell

might be a great deal less charming if she were."

somewhere else a moment earlier, when he arrived, and who had been asked
by odette to tell swann (but that was at least an hour ago) that she
would probably stop to drink a cup of chocolate at prévost's on her
way home. swann set off at once for prévost's, but every few yards
his carriage was held up by others, or by people crossing the street,
loathsome obstacles each of which he would gladly have crushed beneath
his wheels, were it not that a policeman fumbling with a note-book would
delay him even longer than the actual passage of the pedestrian. he
counted the minutes f

whatever chance there might actually be of his
arriving at prévost's in time, and of finding her still there. and then,
in a moment of illumination, like a man in a fever who awakes from sleep
and is conscious of the absurdity of the dream-shapes among which his
mind has been wandering without any clear distinction between himself
and them, swann suddenly perceived how foreign to his nature were the
thoughts which he had been revolving in his mind ever since he had heard
at the verdurins' that odette had left, how novel the heartache from
which he was suffering, but of which he was only now conscious, as
though he had just woken up. what! all this disturbance simply because
he would not see odette, now, till to-morrow, exactly what he had been
hoping, not an hour before, as he drove toward mme. verdurin's. he was
obliged to admit also that now, as he sat in the same carriage and
drove to prévost's, he was no longer the same man, was no longer alone
even--but that a new personality was ther

it was in vain that he assured himself that this possible meeting at
prévost's (the tension of waiting for which so ravished, stripped so
bare the intervening moments that he could find nothing, not one idea,
not one memory in his mind beneath which his troubled spirit might take
shelter and repose) would probably, after all, should it take place, be
much the same as all their meetings, of no great importance. as on every
other evening, once he was in odette's company, once he had begun to
cast furtive glances at her changing countenance, and instantly to
withdraw his eyes lest she should read in them the first symbols of
desire and believe no more in his indifference, he would cease to
be able even to think of her, so busy would he be in the search for
pretexts which would enable him not to leave her immediately, and to
assure himself, without betraying his concern, that he would find her
again, next evening, at the verdurins'; pretexts, that is t

nd himself waiting
at the spot where the carriage was to meet him. it did not appear, and
swann tantalised himself with alternate pictures of the approaching
moment, as one in which rémi would say to him: "sir, the lady is there,"
or as one in which rémi would say to him: "sir, the lady was not in
any of the cafés." and so he saw himself faced by the close of his
evening--a thing uniform, and yet bifurcated by the intervening accident
which would either put an end to his agony by discovering odette, or
would oblige him to abandon any hope of finding her that night, to
accept the necessity of returning home without having seen her.

the coachman returned; but, as he drew up opposite him, swann asked,
not "did you find the lady?" but "remind me, to-morrow, to order in
some more firewood. i am sure we must be running short." perhaps he had
persuaded himself that, if rémi had at last found odette in some café,
where she was waiting for him still, then his night of misery was
already obliter

to satisfy and difficult to assuage--the
insensate, agonising desire to possess her.

swann made rémi drive him to such restaurants as were still open; it was
the sole hypothesis, now, of that happiness which he had contemplated
so calmly; he no longer concealed his agitation, the price he set upon
their meeting, and promised, in case of success, to reward his coachman,
as though, by inspiring in him a will to triumph which would reinforce
his own, he could bring it to pass, by a miracle, that odette--assuming
that she had long since gone home to bed,--might yet be found seated in
some restaurant on the boulevards. he pursued the quest as far as the
maison dorée, burst twice into tortoni's and, still without catching
sight of her, was emerging from the café anglais, striding with haggard
gaze towards his carriage, which was waiting for him at the corner of
the boulevard des italiens, when he collided with a person coming in the
opposite direction; it was odette; she explained, later, that

still smiling, she shrugged her shoulders ever so slightly, as who
should say, "you're quite mad; you know very well that i like it."

he slipped his other hand upwards along odette's cheek; she fixed her
eyes on him with that languishing and solemn air which marks the women
of the old florentine's paintings, in whose faces he had found the type
of hers; swimming at the brink of her fringed lids, her brilliant eyes,
large and finely drawn as theirs, seemed on the verge of breaking from
her face and rolling down her cheeks like two great tears. she bent her
neck, as all their necks may be seen to bend, in the pagan scenes as
well as in the scriptural. and although her attit

allowed her face, as though despite her efforts, to fall upon his lips,
held it back for a moment longer, at a little distance between his
hands. he had intended to leave time for her mind to overtake her body's
movements, to recognise the dream which she had so long cherished and to
assist at its realisation, like a mother invited as a spectator when
a prize is given to the child whom she has reared and loves. perhaps,
moreover, swann himself was fixing upon these features of an odette not
yet possessed, not even kissed by him, on whom he was looking now for
the last time, that comprehensive gaze with which, on the day of his
departure, a traveller strives to bear away with him in memory the view
of a country to which he may never return.

but he was so shy in approaching her that, after this evening which
had begun by his arranging her cattleyas and had ended in her complete
surrender, whether from fear of chilling her, or from reluctance to

the possession of even the most divergent types as an invariable
and monotonous experience, every detail of which is known and can be
described in advance, it still becomes a fresh and stimulating pleasure
if the women concerned be--or be thought to be--so difficult as to
oblige us to base our attack upon some unrehearsed incident in our
relations with them, as was originally for swann the arrangement of the
cattleyas. he trembled as he hoped, that evening, (but odette, he told
himself, if she were deceived by his stratagem, could not guess his
intention) that it was the possession of this woman that would emerge
for him from their large and richly coloured petals; and the pleasure
which he already felt, and which odette tolerated, he thought, perhaps
only because she was not yet aware of it herself, seemed to him for that
reason--as it might have seemed to the first man when he enjoyed it amid
the flowers of the earthly paradise--a pleasure which had never b

the ice once broken, every evening, when he had taken her home, he must
follow her into the house; and often she would come out again in her
dressing-gown, and escort him to his carriage, and would kiss him before
the eyes of his coachman, saying: "what on earth does it matter what
people see?" and on evenings when he did not go to the verdurins' (which
happened occasionally, now that he had opportunities of meeting odette
elsewhere), when--more and more rarely--he went into society, she would
beg him to come to her on his way home, however late he might be. the
season was spring, the nights clear and frosty. he would come away from
an evening party, jump into his victoria, spread a rug over his knees,
tell the friends who were leaving at the same time, and who insisted on
his going home with them, that he could not, that he was not going
in their direction; then the coachman would start off at a fast trot

riends would have recognised him, that manner which had seemed
permanently and unalterably his own. to such an extent does passion
manifest itself in us as a temporary and distinct character, which not
only takes the place of our normal character but actually obliterates
the signs by which that character has hitherto been discernible. on the
other hand, there was one thing that was, now, invariable, namely that
wherever swann might be spending the evening, he never failed to go on
afterwards to odette. the interval of space separating her from him
was one which he must as inevitably traverse as he must descend, by an
irresistible gravitation, the steep slope of life itself. to be frank,
as often as not, when he had stayed late at a party, he would have
preferred to return home at once, without going so far out of his way,
and to postpone their meeting until the morrow; but the very fact of his

visit her, while he guessed t

love-affair, and in whom the perpetual
sacrifice which they are making of their comfort and of their practical
interests has engendered a spiritual charm. then, though he may not
consciously have taken this into consideration, the certainty that she
was waiting for him, that she was not anywhere or with anyone else, that
he would see her before he went home, drew the sting from that anguish,
forgotten, it is true, but latent and ever ready to be reawakened, which
he had felt on the evening when odette had left the verdurins' before
his arrival, an anguish the actual cessation of which was so agreeable
that it might even be called a state of happiness. perhaps it was to
that hour of anguish that there must be attributed the importance which
odette had since assumed in his life. other people are, as a rule, so
immaterial to us that, when we have entrusted to any one of them the

could not without anxiety ask himself what odette would mean to him
in the years that were to come. sometimes, as he looked up from his
victoria on those fine and frosty nights of early spring, and saw the
dazzling moonbeams fall between his eyes and the deserted streets, he
would think of that other face, gleaming and faintly roseate like the
moon's, which had, one day, risen on the horizon of his mind and since
then had shed upon the world that mysterious light in which he saw it
bathed. if he arrived after the hour at which odette sent her

he would rap upon the pane, and she would hear the signal, and answer,
before running to meet him at the gate. he would find, lying open on the
piano, some of her favourite music, the _valse des roses_, the _pauvre
fou_ of tagliafico (which, according to the instructions embodied in her
will, was to be played at her funeral); but he would ask her, instead,
to give him the little phrase from vinteuil's sonata. it was true that
odette played vilely, but often the fairest impression that remains in
our minds of a favourite air is one which has arisen out of a jumble
of wrong notes struck by unskilful fingers upon a tuneless piano. the
little phrase was associated still, in swann's mind, with his love for
odette. he felt clearly that this love was something to which there were
no corresponding external signs, whose meaning could not be proved by
any but himself; he realised, too, that odette's qualities were not such
as to jus

g so high a value on the hours he spent in
her company. and often, when the cold government of reason stood
unchallenged, he would readily have ceased to sacrifice so many of his
intellectual and social interests to this imaginary pleasure. but the
little phrase, as soon as it struck his ear, had the power to liberate
in him the room that was needed to contain it; the proportions of
swann's soul were altered; a margin was left for a form of enjoyment
which corresponded no more than his love for odette to any external
object, and yet was not, like his enjoyment of that love, purely
individual, but assumed for him an objective reality superior to that
of other concrete things. this thirst for an untasted charm, the little
phrase would stimulate it anew in him, but without bringing him any
definite gratification to assuage it. with the result that those parts
of swann's soul in which the little phrase had obliterated all care
for material interests, those human considerations which affect all m

alike, were left bare by it, blank pages on which he was at liberty to
inscribe the name of odette. moreover, where odette's affection might
seem ever so little abrupt and disappointing, the little phrase would
come to supplement it, to amalgamate with it its own mysterious essence.
watching swann's face while he listened to the phrase, one would have
said that he was inhaling an anaesthetic which allowed him to breathe
more deeply. and the pleasure which the music gave him, which was
shortly to create in him a real longing, was in fact closely akin,
at such moments, to the pleasure which he would have derived from

sound. he began to reckon up how much that was painful, perhaps even how
much secret and unappeased sorrow underlay the sweetness of the phrase;
and yet to him it brought no suffering. what matter though the phrase
repeated that love is frail and fleeting, when his love was so strong!
he played with the melancholy which the phrase diffused, he felt it
stealing over him, but like a caress which only deepened and sweetened
his sense of his own happiness. he would make odette play him the phrase
again, ten, twenty times on end, insisting that, while she played, she
must never cease to kiss him. every kiss provokes another. ah, in those
earliest days of love how naturally the kisses spring into life. how
closely, in their abundance, are they pressed one against another; until
lovers would find it as hard to count the kisses exchanged in an hour,
as to count the flowers in a meadow in may. then she would pretend to
stop, saying: "how do you expect me to play when you

annoyed, and she would burst out with a laugh which, was transformed, as
it left her lips, and descended upon him in a shower of kisses. or else
she would look at him sulkily, and he would see once again a face worthy
to figure in botticelli's 'life of moses,' he would place it there,
giving to odette's neck the necessary inclination; and when he had
finished her portrait in distemper, in the fifteenth century, on the
wall of the sixtine, the idea that she was, none the less, in the room
with him still, by the piano, at that very moment, ready to be kissed
and won, the idea of her material existence, of her being alive, would
sweep over him with so violent an intoxication that, with eyes starting
from his head and jaws that parted as though to devour her, he would

and then, as soon as he had left the house, not without returning to
kiss her once again, because he had forgotten to take away with him, in
memory, some detail of her fragrance or of her features, while he drove
home in his victoria, blessing the name of odette who allowed him to pay
her these daily visits, which, although they could not, he felt, bring
any great happiness to her, still, by keeping him immune from the fever
of jealousy--by removing from him every possibility of a fresh outbreak
of the heart-sickness which had manifested itself in him that evening,
when he had failed to find her at the verdurins'--might help him to

this period, upon which he had entered, was to last much longer, whether
presently his mind's eye would cease to behold that dear countenance,
save as occupying a distant and diminished position, and on the verge of
ceasing to shed on him the radiance of its charm. for swann was finding
in things once more, since he had fallen in love, the charm that he had
found when, in his adolescence, he had fancied himself an artist; with
this difference, that what charm lay in them now was conferred by odette
alone. he could feel reawakening in himself the inspirations of his
boyhood, which had been dissipated among the frivolities of his later
life, but they all bore, now, the reflection, the stamp of a particular
being; and during the long hours which he now found a subtle pleasure
in spending at home, alone with his convalescent spirit, he became
gradually himself again, but himself in thraldom to another.

indeed, that he had not even the tiny, initial clue which, by allowing

and so he never asked himself what she might be doing, or what her life
had been. only he smiled sometimes at the thought of how, some years
earlier, when he still did not know her, some one had spoken to him of a
woman who, if he remembered rightly, must certainly have been odette,
as of a 'tart,' a 'kept' woman, one of those women to whom he still
attributed (having lived but little in their company) the entire set of
characteristics, fundamentally perverse, with which they had been, for
many years, endowed by the imagination of certain novelists. he would
say to himself that one has, as often as not, only to take the exact
counterpart of the reputation created by the world in order to judge a
person fairly, when with such a character he contrasted that of odette,

she multiplied the fictitious details of an imaginary illness,
seeming to ask pardon, by her suppliant look and her stricken accents,
for the obvious falsehood of her words.

on certain days, however, though these came seldom, she would call upon
him in the afternoon, to interrupt his musings or the essay on vermeer
to which he had latterly returned. his servant would come in to say that
mme. de crécy was in the small drawing-room. he would go in search of
her, and, when he opened the door, on odette's blushing countenance, as
soon as she caught sight of swann, would appear--changing the curve
of her lips, the look in her eyes, the moulding of her cheeks--an
all-absorbing smile. once he was left alone he would see again that
smile, and her smile of the day before, another with which she had
greeted him sometime else, the smile which had been her answer, in the
carriage that night, when he had asked her whether she objected to his
rearranging her cattleyas; and the life of odette at all othe

traced in three colours upon the buff paper, innumerable smiles. but,
once in a while, illuminating a chink of that existence which swann
still saw as a complete blank, even if his mind assured him that it was
not so, because he was unable to imagine anything that might occupy it,
some friend who knew them both, and suspecting that they were in love,
had not dared to tell him anything about her that was of the least
importance, would describe odette's figure, as he had seen her, that
very morning, going on foot up the rue abbattucci, in a cape trimmed
with skunks, wearing a rembrandt hat, and a bunch of violets in her
bosom. this simple outline reduced swann to utter confusion by enabling
him suddenly to perceive that odette had an existence which was not
wholly subordinated to his own; he burned to know whom she had been
seeking to fascinate by this costume in which he had never seen her; he
registered a vow to insist upon her telling him

ryone alike, at the delicacy of his mind. and indeed it happens,
often enough, to a greater man than swann ever was, to a scientist or
artist, when he is not wholly misunderstood by the people among whom
he lives, that the feeling in them which proves that they have been
convinced of the superiority of his intellect is created not by any
admiration for his ideas--for those are entirely beyond them--but by
their respect for what they term his good qualities. there was also the
respect with which odette was inspired by the thought of swann's social
position, although she had no desire that he should attempt to secure
invitations for herself. perhaps she felt that such attempts would be
bound to fail; perhaps, indeed, she feared lest, merely by speaking of
her to his friends, he should provoke disclosures of an unwelcome kind.
the fact remains that she had consistently held him to his promise never
to mention her name. her reason for not wishing to go into society was,
she had told him, a quarr

girl, who had avenged herself by saying nasty things about her. "but,"
swann objected, "surely, people don't all know your friend." "yes,
don't you see, it's like a spot of oil; people are so horrid." swann was
unable, frankly, to appreciate this point; on the other hand, he knew
that such generalisations as "people are so horrid," and "a word of
scandal spreads like a spot of oil," were generally accepted as true;
there must, therefore, be cases to which they were literally applicable.
could odette's case be one of these? he teased himself with the
question, though not for long, for he too was subject to that mental
oppression which had so weighed upon his father, whenever he was faced
by a difficult problem. in any event, that world of society which
concealed such terrors for odette inspired her, probably, with no very
great longing to enter it, since it was too far removed from the world
which she already knew for her to be able to form any clear conception
of it. at the same time, whil

heart, they are gifted in such matters with an erudition from which they
have extracted a sort of taste, of tact, so automatic in its operation
that swann, for example, without needing to draw upon his knowledge of
the world, if he read in a newspaper the names of the people who had
been guests at a dinner, could tell at once how fashionable the dinner
had been, just as a man of letters, merely by reading a phrase, can
estimate exactly the literary merit of its author. but odette was one
of those persons (an extremely numerous class, whatever the fashionable
world may think, and to be found in every section of society) who do
not share this knowledge, but imagine fashion to be something of quite
another kind, which assumes different aspects according to the circle to
which they themselves belong, but has the special characteristic--common
alike to the fashion of which odette used to dream and to that before
which mme. cottard bowed--of being directly accessible to all.

the other
kind, the fashion of 'fashionable people,' is, it must be admitted,
accessible also; but there are inevitable delays. odette would say of
some one: "he never goes to any place that isn't really smart."

and if swann were to ask her what she meant by that, she would answer,
with a touch of contempt, "smart places! why, good heavens, just fancy,
at your age, having to be told what the smart places are in paris! what
do you expect me to say? well, on sunday mornings there's the avenue de
l'impératrice, and round the lake at five o'clock, and on thursdays
the eden-théâtre, and the hippodrome on fridays; then there are

 the rue royale tea-rooms, where she believed that regular
attendance was indispensable, and set the seal upon a woman's
certificate of 'smartness,' swann, enraptured, as all of us are, at
times, by the natural behaviour of a child, or by the likeness of a
portrait, which appears to be on the point of speaking, would feel so
distinctly the soul of his mistress rising to fill the outlines of her
face that he could not refrain from going across and welcoming it
with his lips. "oh, then, so little odette wants us to take her to the
flower-show, does she? she wants to be admired, does she? very well, we
will take her there, we can but obey her wishes." as swann's sight was
beginning to fail, he had to resign himself to a pair of spectacles,
which he wore at home, when working, while to face the world he adopted
a single eyeglass, as being less disfiguring. the first time that she
saw it in his eye, she could not contain herself for joy: "i really do

dously smart! how nice you
look with it! every inch a gentleman. all you want now is a title!" she
concluded, with a tinge of regret in her voice. he liked odette to say
these things, just as, if he had been in love with a breton girl, he
would have enjoyed seeing her in her coif and hearing her say that she
believed in ghosts. always until then, as is common among men whose
taste for the fine arts develops independently of their sensuality, a
grotesque disparity had existed between the satisfactions which he would
accord to either taste simultaneously; yielding to the seduction of
works of art which grew more and more subtle as the women in whose
compan

y he enjoyed them grew more illiterate and common, he would take a
little servant-girl to a screened box in a theatre where there was some
decadent piece which he had wished to see performed, or to an exhibition
of impressionist painting, with the conviction, moreover, that an
educated, 'society' woman would have understood them no better, but
would not have managed to keep quiet about them so prettily. but, now
that he was in love with odette, all this was changed; to share her
sympathies, to strive to be one with her in spirit was a task so
attractive that he tried to find satisfaction in the things that she
liked, and did find a pleasure, not only in copying her habits but in
adopting her opinions, which was all the deeper because, as those habits
and opinions sprang from no roots in her intelligence, they suggested
to him nothing except that love, for the sake of which he had preferred
them to his own. if he went again to _serge

panine_, if he looked out
for opportunities of going to watch olivier métra conducting, it was for
the pleasure of being initiated into every one of the ideas in odette's
mind, of feeling that he had an equal share in all her tastes. this
charm of drawing him closer to her, which her favourite plays and
pictures and places possessed, struck him as being more mysterious than
the intrinsic charm of more beautiful things and places, which appealed
to him by their beauty, but without recalling her. besides, having

res, he held (or at least he had held for so long that he had
fallen into the habit of saying) that the objects which we admire have
no absolute value in themselves, that the whole thing is a matter of
dates and castes, and consists in a series of fashions, the most vulgar
of which are worth just as much as those which are regarded as the most
refined. and as he had decided that the importance which odette attached
to receiving cards tot a private view was not in itself any more
ridiculous than the pleasure which he himself had at one time felt in
going to luncheon with the prince of wales, so he did not think that the
admiration which she professed for monte-carlo or for the righi was any
more unreasonable than his own liking for holland (which she imagined
as ugly) and for versailles (which bored her to tears). and so he denied
himself the pleasure of visiting those places, consoling himself wi

like everything else that formed part of odette's environment, and was
no more, in a sense, than the means whereby he might see and talk to her
more often, he enjoyed the society of the verdurins. with them, since,
at the heart of all their entertainments, dinners, musical evenings,
games, suppers in fancy dress, excursions to the country, theatre
parties, even the infrequent 'big evenings' when they entertained
'bores,' there were the presence of odette, the sight of odette,
conversation with odette, an inestimable boon which the verdurins,
 
 ___________________________
 
 by
inviting him to their house, bestowed on swann, he was happier in the
little 'nucleus' than anywhere else, and tried to find some genuine
merit in each of its members, imagining that his tastes would lead him
to frequent their society for the rest of his life. never daring to
whisper to himself, lest he should doubt the truth of the suggestion,
that he would always be in love with odette, at least when he tried to
suppose that he would always go to the verdurins' (a proposition
which, a priori, raised fewer fundamental objections on the part of his
intelligence), he saw himself for the future continuing to meet odette
every evening; that did not, perhaps, come quite to the same thing as
his being permanently in love with her, but for the moment while he was
in love with her, to feel that he would not, one day, cease to see her
was all that he could ask. "what a charming atmosph

does what one likes without constraint or fuss. what a flow of humour
there is every day in that drawing-room! certainly, with a few rare
exceptions, i never want to go anywhere else again. it will become more
and more of a habit, and i shall spend the rest of my life among them."

and as the qualities which he supposed to be an intrinsic part of
the verdurin character were no more, really, than their superficial
reflection of the pleasure which had been enjoyed in their society by
his love for odette, those qualities became more serious, more profound,
more vital, as that pleasure increased. since mme. verdurin gave swann,
now and then, what alone could constitute his happiness; since, on an
evening when he felt anxious because odette had talked rather more to
one of the party than to another, and, in a spasm of irritation, would
not take the initiative by asking her whether she was coming home, mme.
verdurin brought peace and joy to his troubled spirit by the spontaneous
exclamation: "odet

te! you'll see m. swann home, won't you?"; since,
when the summer holidays came, and after he had asked himself uneasily
whether odette might not leave paris without him, whether he would still
be able to see her every day, mme. verdurin was going to invite them
both to spend the summer with her in the country; swann, unconsciously
allowing gratitude and self-interest to filter into his intelligence and
to influence his ideas, went so far as to proclaim that mme. verdurin
was "a great and noble soul." should any of his old fellow-pupils in the
louvre school of painting speak to him of some rare or eminent artist,

he might have reminded himself, all the same, that there were various
old friends of his family who were just as simple as the verdurins,
companions of his early days who were just as fond of art, that he knew
other 'great-hearted creatures,' and that, nevertheless, since he had
cast his vote in favour of simplicity, the arts, and magnanimity, he had
entirely ceased to see them. but these people did not know odette, and,
if they had known her, would never have thought of introducing her to
him.

and so there was probably not, in the whole of the verdurin circle, a
single one of the 'faithful' who loved them, or believed that he loved
them, as dearly as did swann. and yet, when m. verdurin said that he was
not satisfied with swann, he had not only expressed his own sentiments,
he had unwittingly discovered his wife's. doubtless swann had too
particular an affection for odette, as to which he had failed to

o their faith, the like of which they had never
come across in anyone before. they would have forgiven his going to the
houses of 'bores' (to whom, as it happened, in his heart of hearts he
infinitely preferred the verdurins and all their little 'nucleus') had
he consented to set a good example by openly renouncing those 'bores'
in the presence of the 'faithful.' but that was an abjuration which, as
they well knew, they were powerless to extort.

what a difference was there in a 'newcomer' whom odette had asked them
to invite, although she herself had met him only a few times, and on
whom they were building great hopes--the comte de forcheville! (it
turned out that he was nothing more nor less than the brother-in-law of
saniette, a discovery which filled all the 'faithful' with amazement:
the manners of the old palaeographer were so humble that they had always
supposed him to be of a class inferior, socially, to their own, and
had never expected to learn that he came of a rich and relatively

intelligence, namely, conversation, that swann could not see anything
in brichot's pleasantries; to him they were merely pedantic, vulgar,
and disgustingly coarse. he was shocked, too, being accustomed to
good manners, by the rude, almost barrack-room tone which this
student-in-arms adopted, no matter to whom he was speaking. finally,
perhaps, he had lost all patience that evening as he watched mme.
verdurin welcoming, with such unnecessary warmth, this forcheville
fellow, whom it had been odette's unaccountable idea to bring to the
house. feeling a little awkward, with swann there also, she had asked
him on her arrival: "what do you think of my guest?"

and he, suddenly realising for the first time that forcheville, whom
he had known for years, could actually attract a woman, and was quite a
good specimen of a man, had retorted: "beastly!" he had, certainly,
no idea of being jealous of odette, but did not feel quite so happy as
usual, and when brichot, having begun to tell them the sto

n and spoke but seldom, was not lacking,
for all that, in self-assurance when a happy inspiration put the right
word in her mouth. she felt that it would be well received; the thought
gave her confidence, and what she was doing was done with the object not
so much of shining herself, as of helping her husband on in his career.
and so she did not allow the word 'salad,' which mme. verdurin had just
uttered, to pass unchallenged.

"it's not a japanese salad, is it?" she whispered, turning towards
odette.

and then, in her joy and confusion at the combination of neatness
and daring which there had been in making so discreet and yet so
unmistakable an allusion to the new and brilliantly successful play by
dumas, she broke down in a charming, girlish laugh, not very loud, but
so irresistible that it was some time before she could control it.

"who is that lady? she seems devilish clever," said forcheville.

"no, it is not. but we will have one for you if you will all come to
dinner on friday."

sorry; but something a little bigger, like the battle of waterloo, or
anything of that sort, he'd tell you things you simply wouldn't believe.
why, swann was in the regiment then; he must have known him."

"do you see much of m. swann?" asked mme. verdurin.

"oh dear, no!" he answered, and then, thinking that if he made himself
pleasant to swann he might find favour with odette, he decided to
take this opportunity of flattering him by speaking of his fashionable
friends, but speaking as a man of the world himself, in a tone of
good-natured criticism, and not as though he were congratulating swann
upon some undeserved good fortune: "isn't that so, swann? i never see
anything of you, do i?--but then, where on earth is one to see him? the
creature spends all his time shut up with the la trémoïlles, with the
laumes and all that lot!" the imputation would have been false

attaining to complete unanimity, and was unable to restrain herself, in
her fury at the obstinacy of this wretch who could not see what anguish
his words were causing her, but cried aloud, from the depths of her
tortured heart, "you may think so if you wish, but at least you need not
say so to us."

"it all depends upon what you call intelligence." forcheville felt that
it was his turn to be brilliant. "come now, swann, tell us what you mean
by intelligence."

"there," cried odette, "that's one of the big things i beg him to tell
me about, and he never will."

"oh, but..." protested swann.

"oh, but nonsense!" said odette.

"a water-butt?" asked the doctor.

"to you," pursued forcheville, "does intelligence mean what they call
clever talk; you know, the sort of people who worm their way into
society?"

"finish your sweet, so that they can take your plate away!" said mme.
verdurin sourly to saniette, who was lost in thought and had stopped
eating. and then, perhaps a littl

"he's going to give us fénelon's definition of intelligence. that's
interesting. it's not often you get a chance of hearing that!"

but brichot was keeping fénelon's definition until swann should
have given his own. swann remained silent, and, by this fresh act of
recreancy, spoiled the brilliant tournament of dialectic which mme.
verdurin was rejoicing at being able to offer to forcheville.

"you see, it's just the same as with me!" odette was peevish. "i'm not
at all sorry to see that i'm not the only one he doesn't find quite up
to his level."

"these de la trémouailles whom mme. verdurin has exhibited to us as so
little to be desired," inquired brichot, articulating vigorously, "are
they, by any chance, descended from the couple whom that worthy old
snob, sévigné, said she was delighted to know, because it was so good
for her peasants? true, the marquise had another reason, which in her
case probably came first, for she was

"now, then, take your pipe out of your mouth; can't you see, you'll
choke if you try to bottle up your laughter like that," counselled mme.
verdurin, as she came round with a tray of liqueurs.

"what a delightful man your husband is; he has the wit of a dozen!"
declared forcheville to mme. cottard. "thank you, thank you, an old
soldier like me can never say 'no' to a drink."

"m. de forcheville thinks odette charming," m. verdurin told his wife.

"why, do you know, she wants so much to meet you again some day at
luncheon. we must arrange it, but don't on any account let swann hear
about it. he spoils everything, don't you know. i don't mean to say that
you're not to come to dinner too, of course; we hope to see you very
often. now that the warm weather's coming, we're going to have dinner

above it--and as in a mountainous country, against the seeming
immobility of a vertically falling torrent, one may distinguish, two
hundred feet below, the tiny form of a woman walking in the valley--the
little phrase had just appeared, distant but graceful, protected by
the long, gradual unfurling of its transparent, incessant and sonorous
curtain. and swann, in his heart of hearts, turned to it, spoke to it as
to a confidant in the secret of his love, as to a friend of odette who
would assure him that he need pay no attention to this forcheville.

"ah! you've come too late!" mme. verdurin greeted one of the 'faithful,'
whose invitation had been only 'to look in after dinner,' "we've been
having a simply incomparable brichot! you never heard such eloquence!
but he's gone. isn't that so, m. swann? i believe it's the first time
you've met him," she went on, to emphasize the fact that it was to her
that swann owed the introduction. "isn't that so; wasn't he delicious,

too peremptory, a little too jovial for my taste. i should like to see
him a little less confident at times, a little more tolerant, but one
feels that he knows a great deal, and on the whole he seems a very sound
fellow."

the party broke up very late. cottard's first words to his wife were: "i
have rarely seen mme. verdurin in such form as she was to-night."

"what exactly is your mme. verdurin? a bit of a bad hat, eh?" said
forcheville to the painter, to whom he had offered a 'lift.' odette
watched his departure with regret; she dared not refuse to let swann
take her home, but she was moody and irritable in the carriage, and,
when he asked whether he might come in, replied, "i suppose so," with an
impatient shrug of her shoulders. when they had all gone, mme. verdurin
said to her husband: "did you notice the way swann laughed, such an
idiotic laugh, when we spoke about mme. la trémoïlle?"

she had remarked, more than once, how swann and forcheville suppressed
the particle 'de' b

"i don't mind saying that i thought him extremely stupid."

m. verdurin took it up. "he's not sincere. he's a crafty customer,
always hovering between one side and the other. he's always trying to
run with the hare and hunt with the hounds. what a difference between
him and forcheville. there, at least, you have a man who tells you
straight out what he thinks. either you agree with him or you don't.
not like the other fellow, who's never definitely fish or fowl. did you
notice, by the way, that odette seemed all out for forcheville, and i
don't blame her, either. and then, after all, if swann tries to come
the man of fashion over us, the champion of distressed duchesses, at any
rate the other man has got a title; he's always comte de forcheville!"
he let the words slip delicately from his lips, as though, familiar with
every page of the history of that dignity, he were making a scrupulously
exact estimate of its value, in relation to others of the sort.

 public taste, and serving up to it the commonplace
expressions to which it is used; it was by the same process that swann
infuriated m. verdurin. in his case as in theirs it was the novelty
of his language which led his audience to suspect the blackness of his
designs.

swann was still unconscious of the disgrace that threatened him at the
verdurins', and continued to regard all their absurdities in the most
rosy light, through the admiring eyes of love.

as a rule he made no appointments with odette except for the evenings;
he was afraid of her growing tired of him if he visited her during the
day as well; at the same time he was reluctant to forfeit, even for
an hour, the place that he held in her thoughts, and so was constantly
looking out for an opportunity of claiming her attention, in any way
that would not be displeasing to her. if, in a florist's or a jeweller's
window, a plant or an ornament caught his eye, he would at once think
of sending them to odette, imagining that the pleasu

come on a little extraordinary visit of thanks. as in an earlier phase,
when he had experimented with the reflex action of anger and contempt
upon her character, he sought now by that of gratification to elicit
from her fresh particles of her intimate feelings, which she had never
yet revealed.

often she was embarrassed by lack of money, and under pressure from
a creditor would come to him for assistance. he enjoyed this, as he
enjoyed everything which could impress odette with his love for herself,
or merely with his influence, with the extent of the use that she might
make of him. probably if anyone had said to him, at the beginning, "it's
your position that attracts her," or at this stage, "it's your money
that she's really in love with," he would not have believed the
suggestion, nor would he have been greatly distressed by the thought
that people supposed her to be attached to him, that people felt them,
to be united by any ties so binding as those of snobbi

shness or wealth.
but even if he had accepted the possibility, it might not have caused
him any suffering to discover that odette's love for him was based on a
foundation more lasting than mere affection, or any attractive qualities
which she might have found in him; on a sound, commercial interest; an
interest which would postpone for ever the fatal day on which she might
be tempted to bring their relations to an end. for the moment, while
he lavished presents upon her, and performed all manner of services,
he could rely on advantages not contained in his person, or in his
intellect, could forego the endless, killing eff

ed its value in his eyes--as one sees people who are
doubtful whether the sight of the sea and the sound of its waves are
really enjoyable, become convinced that they are, as also of the rare
quality and absolute detachment of their own taste, when they have
agreed to pay several pounds a day for a room in an hotel, from which
that sight and that sound may be enjoyed.

one day, when reflections of this order had brought him once again to
the memory of the time when some one had spoken to him of odette as of
a 'kept' woman, and when, once again, he had amused himself with
contrasting that strange personification, the 'kept' woman--an
iridescent mixture of unknown and demoniacal qualities, embroidered,
as in some fantasy of gustave moreau, with poison-dripping flowers,
interwoven with precious jewels--with that odette upon whose face he
had watched the passage of the same expressions of pity for a sufferer,
resentment of an act of injustice, gratitude for an act of kindness,
which he had seen,

 in earlier days, on his own mother's face, and on
the faces of friends; that odette, whose conversation had so frequently
turned on the things that he himself knew better than anyone, his
collections, his room, his old servant, his banker, who kept all his
title-deeds and bonds;--the thought of the banker reminded him that he
must call on him shortly, to draw some money. and indeed, if, during the
current month, he were to come less liberally to the aid of odette in
her financial difficulties than in the month before, when he had given
her five thousand francs, if he refrained from offering her a diamond
necklace for which she longed, he would be allowing her admiration for
his generosity to decline, that gratitude which had made him so happy,
and would even be running the risk of her imagining that his love
for her (as she saw its visible manifestations grow fewer) had itself
diminished. and then, suddenly, he asked himself whether that was not
precise

ly what was implied by 'keeping' a woman (as if, in fact, that
idea of 'keeping' could be derived from elements not at all mysterious
nor perverse, but belonging to the intimate routine of his daily life,
such as that thousand-franc note, a familiar and domestic object, torn
in places and mended with gummed paper, which his valet, after paying
the household accounts and the rent, had locked up in a drawer in
the old writing-desk whence he had extracted it to send it, with four
others, to odette) and whether it was not possible to apply to odette,
since he had known her (for he never imagined for a moment that she
could ever have taken a penny from anyone else, before), that title,
which he had believed so wholly inapplicable to her, of 'kept' woman. he
could not explore the idea further, for a sudden access of that mental
lethargy which was, with him, congenital, intermittent and providential,
happened, at that moment, to extinguish every particle of light in his
brain, as instantaneo

usly as, at a later period, when electric lighting
had been everywhere installed, it became possible, merely by fingering
a switch, to cut off all the supply of light from a house. his mind
fumbled, for a moment, in the darkness, he took off his spectacles,
wiped the glasses, passed his hands over his eyes, but saw no light
until he found himself face to face with a wholly different idea, the
realisation that he must endeavour, in the coming month, to send odette
six or seven thousand-franc notes instead of five, simply as a surprise
for her and to give her pleasure.

in the evening, when he did not stay at home until it was time to meet
odette at the verdurins', or rather at one of the open-air restaurants
which they liked to frequent in the bois and especially at saint-cloud,
he would go to dine in one of those fashionable houses in which, at one
time, he had been a constant guest. he did not wish to lose touch with
people who, for all that he knew, m

and thanks to whom he was often, in the meantime, able to procure for
her some privilege or pleasure. besides, he had been used for so long to
the refinement and comfort of good society that, side by side with his
contempt, there had grown up also a desperate need for it, with the
result that, when he had reached the point after which the humblest
lodgings appeared to him as precisely on a par with the most princely
mansions, his senses were so thoroughly accustomed to the latter that he

e the spectacle of
wash-hand-stands covered over with towels, and of beds converted into
cloak-rooms, with a mass of hats and great-coats sprawling over their
counterpanes, gave him the same stifling sensation that, nowadays,
people who have been used for half a lifetime to electric light derive
from a smoking lamp or a candle that needs to be snuffed. if he were
dining out, he would order his carriage for half-past seven; while he
changed his clothes, he would be wondering, all the time, about odette,
and in this way was never alone, for the constant thought of odette
gave to the moments in which he was separated from her the same peculiar
charm as to those in which she was at his side. he would get into his
carriage and drive off, but he knew that this thought had jumped in
after him and had settled down upon his knee, like a pet animal which
he might take everywhere, and would keep with him at the dinner-table,
unobserved by his fellow-guests. he would stroke and fondle it, warm

ith it, and, as a feeling of languor swept over him, would
give way to a slight shuddering movement which contracted his throat
and nostrils--a new experience, this,--as he fastened the bunch of
columbines in his buttonhole. he had for some time been feeling neither
well nor happy, especially since odette had brought forcheville to the
verdurins', and he would have liked to go away for a while to rest in
the country. but he could never summon up courage to leave paris, even
for a day, while odette was there. the weather was warm; it was the
finest part of the spring. and for all that he was driving through a
city of stone to immure himself in a house without grass or garden, what
was incessantly before his eyes was a park which he owned, near combray,
where, at four in the afternoon, before coming to the asparagus-bed,
thanks to the breeze that was wafted across the fields from méséglise,
he could enjoy the fragrant coolness of the air as well beneath an
arbour of hornbeams in the gard

 (at whose house dinner had been so late that swann had left
before the coffee came in, to join the verdurins on the island in the
bois) observed:

"really, if swann were thirty years older, and had diabetes, there might
be some excuse for his running away like that. he seems to look upon us
all as a joke."

he persuaded himself that the spring-time charm, which he could not go
down to combray to enjoy, he would find at least on the he des cygnes
or at saint-cloud. but as he could think only of odette, he would
return home not knowing even if he had tasted the fragrance of the young
leaves, or if the moon had been shining. he would be welcomed by the
little phrase from the sonata, played in the garden on the restaurant
piano. if there was none in the garden, the verdurins would have taken
immense pains to have a piano brought out either from a private room
or from the restaurant itself; not because swann was now restored to
favour; far from it. but the idea of arranging an ingenious form of

 
 ___________________________
 
entertainment for some one, even for some one whom they disliked, would
stimulate them, during the time spent in its preparation, to a momentary
sense of cordiality and affection. now and then he would remind himself
that another fine spring evening was drawing to a close, and would force
himself to notice the trees and the sky. but the state of excitement
into which odette's presence never failed to throw him, added to a
feverish ailment which, for some time now, had scarcely left him,
robbed him of that sense of quiet and comfort which is an indispensable
background to the impressions that we derive from nature.

one evening, when swann had consented to dine with the verdurins, and
had mentioned during dinner that he had to attend, next day, the annual
banquet of an old comrades' association, odette had at once exclaimed
across the table, in front of everyone, i

n front of forcheville, who was
now one of the 'faithful,' in front of the painter, in front of cottard:

"yes, i know, you have your banquet to-morrow; i sha'n't see you, then,
till i get home; don't be too late."

and although swann had never yet taken offence, at all seriously,
at odette's demonstrations of friendship for one or other of the
'faithful,' he felt an exquisite pleasure on hearing her thus avow,
before them all, with that calm immodesty, the fact that they saw each
other regularly every evening, his privileged position in her house, and
her own preference for him which it implied. it was true that swann had
often reflected that odette was in no way a remarkable woman; and in
the supremacy which he wielded over a creature so distinctly inferior to
himself there was 
 
 ___________________________
 
nothing that especially flattered him when he heard
it proclaimed to all the 'faithful'; but since he had observed that,
to several other men than himself, odette seemed a fascinating and
desirable woman, the attraction which her body held for him had aroused
a painful longing to secure the absolute mastery of even the tiniest
particles of her heart. and he had begun to attach an incalculable value
to those moments passed in her house in the evenings, when he held her
upon his knee, made her tell him what she thought about this or that,
and counted over that treasure to which, alone of all his earthly
possessions, he still clung. and so, after this dinne

care to thank her effusively, seeking to indicate to
her by the extent of his gratitude the corresponding intensity of
the pleasures which it was in her power to bestow on him, the supreme
pleasure being to guarantee him immunity, for as long as his love should
last and he remain vulnerable, from the assaults of jealousy.

when he came away from his banquet, the next evening, it was pouring
rain, and he had nothing but his victoria. a friend offered to take
him home in a closed carriage, and as odette, by the fact of her having
invited him to come, had given him an assurance that she was expecting
no one else, he could, with a quiet mind and an untroubled heart, rather
than set off thus in the rain, have gone home and to bed. but perhaps,
if she saw that he seemed not to adhere to his resolution to end every
evening, without exception, in her company, she might grow careless, and
fail to keep free for him just the one evening on which he particularly
desired it.

it was after eleven when he

ter she felt
tired and wished to sleep.

"no cattleya, then, to-night?" he asked, "and i've been looking forward
so to a nice little cattleya."

but she was irresponsive; saying nervously: "no, dear, no cattleya
tonight. can't you see, i'm not well?"

"it might have done you good, but i won't bother you."

she begged him to put out the light before he went; he drew the curtains
close round her bed and left her. but, when he was in his own house
again, the idea suddenly struck him that, perhaps, odette was expecting
some one else that evening, that she had merely pretended to be tired,
that she had asked him to put the light out only so that he should
suppose that she was going to sleep, that the moment he had left
the house she had lighted it again, and had reopened her door to the
stranger who was to be her guest for the night. he looked at his watch.
it was about an hour and a half since he had left her; he went out, took
a cab, and stopped it close to her house, in a little street running

along by the wall until he reached the window, but between the slanting
bars of the shutters he could see nothing; he could hear, only, in the
silence of the night, the murmur of conversation. what agony he suffered
as he watched that light, in whose golden atmosphere were moving, behind
the closed sash, the unseen and detested pair, as he listened to that
murmur which revealed the presence of the man who had crept in after his
own departure, the perfidy of odette, and the pleasures which she was at
that moment tasting with the stranger.

and yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced
him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its
uncertainty, now that odette's other life, of which he had had, at that
first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost
within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light,
caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into whic

when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or
rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had
come there very late, and by that signal odette would at least learn
that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while
he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him,
as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been
tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in
their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they
believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a
plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in

tap upon the shutter. and, perhaps, what he felt (almost an agreeable
feeling) at that moment was something more than relief at the solution
of a doubt, at the soothing of a pain; was an intellectual pleasure.
if, since he had fallen in love, things had recovered a little of the
delicate attraction that they had had for him long ago--though only when
a light was shed upon them by a thought, a memory of odette--now it was
another of the faculties, prominent in the studious days of his youth,
that odette had quickened with new life, the passion for truth, but for
a truth which, too, was interposed between himself and his mistress,
receiving its light from her alone, a private and personal truth the
sole object of which (an infinitely precious object, and one almost
impersonal in its absolute beauty) was odette--odette in her activities,
her environment, her projects, and her past. at every other perio

at doors, seemed to him, now, to be precisely on a level with the
deciphering of manuscripts, the weighing of evidence, the interpretation
of old monuments, that was to say, so many different methods of
scientific investigation, each one having a definite intellectual value
and being legitimately employable in the search for truth.

as his hand stole out towards the shutters he felt a pang of shame at
the thought that odette would now know that he had suspected her, that
he had returned, that he had posted himself outside her window. she
had often told him what a horror she had of jealous men, of lovers who
spied. what he was going to do would be extremely awkward, and she would
detest him for ever after, whereas now, for the moment, for so long as
he refrained from knocking, perhaps even in the act of infidelity, she
loved him still. how often is not the prospect of future happiness

brief, fleeting, precious transcript, on that translucent page, so warm,
so beautiful. and besides, the advantage which he felt--which he so
desperately wanted to feel--that he had over them, lay perhaps not so
much in knowing as in being able to shew them that he knew. he drew
himself up on tiptoe. he knocked. they had not heard; he knocked again;
louder; their conversation ceased. a man's voice--he strained his ears
to distinguish whose, among such of odette's friends as he knew, the

he could not be certain of the voice. he knocked once again. the window

retire, and since she must know all, so as not to seem too contemptible,
too jealous and inquisitive, he called out in a careless, hearty,
welcoming tone:

"please don't bother; i just happened to be passing, and saw the light.
i wanted to know if you were feeling better."

of them with a lamp in his hand; and beyond them he could see into
the room, a room that he had never seen before. having fallen into the
habit, when he came late to odette, of identifying her window by
the fact that it was the only one still lighted in a row of windows
otherwise all alike, he had been misled, this time, by the light, and
had knocked at the window beyond hers, in the adjoining house. he made
what apology he could and hurried home, overjoyed that the satisfaction
of his curiosity had preserved their love intact, and that, having
feigned for so long, when in odette's company, a sort of indifference,
he had not now, by a demonstration of jealousy, gi

the mind, the
mind can dwell upon it, can note that it has diminished, that it has
momentarily ceased. but with this mental pain, the mind, merely by
recalling it, created it afresh. to determine not to think of it was but
to think of it still, to suffer from it still. and when, in conversation
with his friends, he forgot his sufferings, suddenly a word casually
uttered would make him change countenance as a wounded man does when a
clumsy hand has touched his aching limb. when he came away from odette,
he was happy, he felt calm, he recalled the smile with which, in gentle
mockery, she had spoken to him of this man or of that, a smile which was
all tenderness for himself; he recalled the gravity of her head which
she seemed to have lifted from its axis to let it droop and fall, as
though against her will, upon his lips, as she had done on that first
evening in the carriage; her languishing gaze at him while she lay
nestling in his arms, her bended head seeming to recede between her
shoulders

th the result that he came to regret every pleasure that he
tasted in her company, every new caress that he invented (and had been
so imprudent as to point out to her how delightful it was), every fresh
charm that he found in her, for he knew that, a moment later, they
would go to enrich the collection of instruments in his secret
torture-chamber.

a fresh turn was given to the screw when swann recalled a sudden
expression which he had intercepted, a few days earlier, and for the
first time, in odette's eyes. it was after dinner at the verdurins'.
whether it was because forcheville, aware that saniette, his
brother-in-law, was not in favour with them, had decided to make a butt
of him, and to shine at his expense, or because he had been annoyed
by some awkward remark which saniette had made to him, although it had
passed unnoticed by the rest of the party who knew nothing of whatever
tactless allusion it might conceal, or possibly because he had been for
some time looking out for an opportun

e knew to be so nice-minded that he himself could not help feeling
embarrassed at times merely by his presence in the room, forcheville
replied to saniette's tactless utterance with such a volley of abuse,
going out of his way to insult him, emboldened, the louder he shouted,
by the fear, the pain, the entreaties of his victim, that the poor
creature, after asking mme. verdurin whether he should stay and
receiving no answer, had left the house in stammering confusion and with
tears in his eyes. odette had looked on, impassive, at this scene; but
when the door had closed behind saniette, she had forced the normal
expression of her face down, as the saying is, by several pegs, so as to
bring herself on to the same level of vulgarity as forcheville; her eyes
had sparkled with a malicious smile of congratulation upon his audacity,
of ironical pity for the poor wretch who had been its victim; she
had darted at him a look of complicity in the crime, which so clearly
implied: "that's finished him o

e what a fool he looked? he was actually crying," that forcheville,
when his eyes met hers, sobered in a moment from the anger, or pretended
anger with which he was still flushed, smiled as he explained: "he need
only have made himself pleasant and he'd have been here still; a good
scolding does a man no harm, at any time."

one day when swann had gone out early in the afternoon to pay a call,
and had failed to find the person at home whom he wished to see, it
occurred to him to go, instead, to odette, at an hour when, although he
never went to her house then as a rule, he knew that she was always at
home, resting or writing letters until tea-time, and would enjoy seeing
her for a moment, if it did not disturb her. the porter told him that he
believed odette to be in; swann rang the bell, thought that he heard a
sound, that he heard footsteps, but no one came to the door. anxious and
annoyed, he went round to the other little street, at the back of her
house, and stood beneath her bedroom wi

akened her; she had guessed that it must be swann, and had run out
to meet him, but he had already gone. she had, of course, heard him
knocking at the window. swann could at once detect in this story one of
those fragments of literal truth which liars, when taken by surprise,
console themselves by introducing into the composition of the falsehood
which they have to invent, thinking that it can be safely incorporated,
and will lend the whole story an air of verisimilitude. it was true
that, when odette had just done something which she did not wish to
disclose, she would take pains to conceal it in a secret place in her
heart. but as soon as she found herself face to face with the man to
whom she was obliged to lie, she became uneasy, all her ideas melted
like wax before a flame, her inventive and her reasoning faculties
were paralysed, she might ransack her brain but would find only a void;
still, she must say something, and there lay within her reach precisely
the fact which she had wished

 fictitious details in which she
might embed it, would continue to shew, by their overlapping angles and
by the gaps which she had forgotten to fill, that its proper place was
elsewhere.

"she admits that she heard me ring, and then knock, that she knew it was
myself, that she wanted to see me," swann thought to himself. "but that
doesn't correspond with the fact that she did not let me in."

he did not, however, draw her attention to this inconsistency, for he
thought that, if left to herself, odette might perhaps produce some
falsehood which would give him a faint indication of the truth; she
spoke; he did not interrupt her, he gathered up, with an eager and
sorrowful piety, the words that fell from her lips, feeling (and rightly
feeling, since she was hiding the truth behind them as she spoke) that,
like the veil of a sanctuary, they kept a vague imprint, traced a
faint outline of that infinitely precious and, alas, undiscoverable
truth;--what she had been doing, that afternoon, at three

o'clock, when
he had called,--a truth of which he would never possess any more than
these falsifications, illegible and divine traces, a truth which would
exist henceforward only in the secretive memory of this creature, who
would contemplate it in utter ignorance of its value, but would never
yield it up to him. it was true that he had, now and then, a strong
suspicion that odette's daily activities were not in themselves
passionately interesting, and that such relations as she might have with
other men did not exhale, naturally, in a universal sense, or for every
rational being, a spirit of morbid gloom capable of infecting with
fever or of inciting to suicide. he realised, at such moments, that that
interest, that gloom, existed in him only as a malady might exist, and
that, once he was cured of the malady, the actions of odette, the kisses

already spent a definite residue of habits and passions which they
can regard as characteristic and permanent, and with which they will
deliberately arrange, before anything else, that the kind of existence
which they choose to adopt shall not prove inharmonious. swann deemed
it wise to make allowance in his life for the suffering which he derived
from not knowing what odette had done, just as he made allowance for the
impetus which a damp climate always gave to his eczema; to anticipate
in his budget the expenditure of a considerable sum on procuring, with
regard to the daily occupations of odette, information the lack of
which would make him unhappy, just as he reserved a margin for the
gratification of other tastes from which he knew that pleasure was to be
expected (at least, before he had fallen in love) such as his taste for
collecting things, or for good cook

when he proposed to take leave of odette, and to return home, she begged
him to stay a little longer, and even detained him forcibly, seizing him
by the arm as he was opening the door to go. but he gave no thought to
that, for, among the crowd of gestures and speeches and other little
incidents which go to make up a conversation, it is inevitable that we
should pass (without noticing anything that arouses our interest) by

expression, which seems ready to succumb beneath the burden of a grief
too heavy to be borne, when they are merely allowing the infant jesus to
play with a pomegranate, or watching moses pour water into a trough. he
had seen the same sorrow once before on her face, but when, he could
no longer say. then, suddenly, he remembered it; it was when odette had
lied, in apologising to mme. verdurin on the evening after the dinner
from which she had stayed away on a pretext of illness, but really so
that she might be alone with swann. surely, even had she been the most
scrupulous of women, she could hardly have felt remorse for so innocent
a lie. but the lies which odette ordinarily told were less innocent, and
served to prevent discoveries which might have involved her in the most
terrible difficulties with one or another of her friends. and so, w

ed expression, that plaintive voice, which seemed to falter
beneath the effort that she was forcing herself to make, and to plead
for pardon? he had an idea that it was not merely the truth about what
had occurred that afternoon that she was endeavouring to hide from him,
but something more immediate, something, possibly, which had not yet
happened, but might happen now at any time, and, when it did, would
throw a light upon that earlier event. at that moment, he heard the
front-door bell ring. odette never stopped speaking, but her words
dwindled into an inarticulate moan. her regret at not having seen swann
that afternoon, at not having opened the door to him, had melted into a
universal despair.

he could hear the gate being closed, and the sound of a carriage, as
though some one were going away--probably the person whom swann must on
no account meet--after being told that odette was not at home. and then,
when he reflected that, merely by coming at an hour when he was not in
the habit of

 coming, he had managed to disturb so many arrangements of
which she did not wish him to know, he had a feeling of discouragement
that amounted, almost, to distress. but since he was in love with
odette, since he was in the habit of turning all his thoughts towards
her, the pity with which he might have been inspired for himself he felt
for her only, and murmured: "poor darling!" when finally he left her,
she took up several letters which were lying on the table, and asked him
if he would be so good as to post them for her. he walked along to the
post-office, took the letters from his pocket, and, before dropping each
of them into the box, scanned its address. they were all to tradesmen,

t the last, which was to forcheville. he kept it in his hand. "if
i saw what was in this," he argued, "i should know what she calls him,
what she says to him, whether there really is anything between them.
perhaps, if i don't look inside, i shall be lacking in delicacy towards
odette, since in this way alone i can rid myself of a suspicion which
is, perhaps, a calumny on her, which must, in any case, cause her
suffering, and which can never possibly be set at rest, once the letter
is posted."

he left the post-office and went home, but he had kept the last letter
in his pocket. he lighted a candle, and held up close to its flame the
envelope which he had not dared to open. at first he could distinguish
nothing, but the envelope was thin, and by pressing it down on to the

 fro, the
envelope being too large for it and then, by moving it with his finger
and thumb, brought one line after another beneath the part of the
envelope where the paper was not doubled, through which alone it was
possible to read.

in spite of all these manoeuvres he could not make it out clearly. not
that it mattered, for he had seen enough to assure himself that the
letter was about some trifling incident of no importance, and had
nothing at all to do with love; it was something to do with odette's
uncle. swann had read quite plainly at the beginning of the line "i
was right," but did not understand what odette had been right in doing,
until suddenly a word which he had not been able, at first, to decipher,
came to light and made the whole sentence intelligible: "i was right to
open the door; it was my uncle." to open the door! then forcheville had
been there when swann rang the bell, and she had sent him away; hence
the sound that swann had heard.

after that he read the whole letter;

rcheville with so little ceremony, and reminded him
that he had left his cigarette-case at her house, precisely what she
had written to swann after one of his first visits. but to swann she had
added: "why did you not forget your heart also? i should never have let
you have that back." to forcheville nothing of that sort; no allusion
that could suggest any intrigue between them. and, really, he was
obliged to admit that in all this business forcheville had been worse
treated than himself, since odette was writing to him to make him
believe that her visitor had been an uncle. from which it followed that
he, swann, was the man to whom she attached importance, and for whose
sake she had sent the other away. and yet, if there had been nothing
between odette and forcheville, why not have opened the door at once,
why have said, "i was right to open the door; it was my uncle." right?
if she was doing nothing wrong at that moment how could forcheville
possibly have accounted for her not opening the

door? for a time swann
stood still there, heartbroken, bewildered, and yet happy; gazing at
this envelope which odette had handed to him without a scruple, so
absolute was her trust in his honour; through its transparent window
there had been disclosed to him, with the secret history of an incident
which he had despaired of ever being able to learn, a fragment of the
life of odette, seen as through a narrow, luminous incision, cut into
its surface without her knowledge. then his jealousy rejoiced at the
discovery, as though that jealousy had had an independent existence,
fiercely egotistical, gluttonous of every thing that would feed its
vitality, even at the expense of swann himself. now it had food in
store, and swann could begin to grow uneasy afresh every evening, over
the visits that odette had received about five o'clock, and could
seek to discover where forcheville

 had been at that hour. for swann's
affection for odette still preserved the form which had been imposed on
it, from the beginning, by his ignorance of the occupations in which she
passed her days, as well as by the mental lethargy which prevented him
from supplementing that ignorance by imagination. he was not jealous, at
first, of the whole of odette's life, but of those moments only in which
an incident, which he had perhaps misinterpreted, had led him to suppose
that odette might have played him false. his jealousy, like an octopus
which throws out a first, then a second, and finally a third tentacle,
fastened itself irremovably first to that moment, five o'clock in
the afternoon, then to another, then to another again. but swann was
incapable of inventing his sufferings. they were only the memory, the
perpetuation of a suffering that had come to him from without.

from without, however, everything brought him fresh suffering. he
decided to separate odette from fo

rcheville, by taking her away for a
few days to the south. but he imagined that she was coveted by every
male person in the hotel, and that she coveted them in return. and so
he, who, in old days, when he travelled, used always to seek out new
people and crowded places, might now be seen fleeing savagely from human
society as if it had cruelly injured him. and how could he not have
turned misanthrope, when in every man he saw a potential lover for
odette? thus his jealousy did even more than the happy, passionate
desire which he had originally felt for odette had done to alter swann's
character, completely changing, in the eyes of the world, even the
outward signs by which that character had been intelligible.

a month after the evening on which he had intercepted and read odette's
letter to forcheville, swann went to a dinner which the verdurins were
giving in the bois. as the party was breaking up he noticed a series of
whispered discussions

 which the two-fold desire to make the speaker be quiet and
to preserve, oneself, an appearance of guilelessness in the eyes of the
listener, is neutralised in an intense vacuity; in which the unflinching
signs of intelligent complicity are overlaid by the smiles of innocence,
an expression invariably adopted by anyone who has noticed a blunder,
the enormity of which is thereby at once revealed if not to those who
have made it, at any rate to him in whose hearing it ought not to have
been made. odette seemed suddenly to be in despair, as though she had
decided not to struggle any longer against the crushing difficulties of
life, and swann was anxiously counting the minutes that still separated
him from the point at which, after leaving the restaurant, while he
drove her home, he would be able to ask for an explanation, to make her
promise, either that she would not go to chatou next day, or that she
would procure an invitation for him also, and to lull to rest in her
arms the anguish that st

rmented him. at last the carriages were
ordered. mme. verdurin said to swann:

"good-bye, then. we shall see you soon, i hope," trying, by the
friendliness of her manner and the constraint of her smile, to prevent
him from noticing that she was not saying, as she would always have
until then:

"to-morrow, then, at chatou, and at my house the day after." m. and mme.
verdurin made forcheville get into their carriage; swann's was drawn up
behind it, and he waited for theirs to start before helping odette into
his own.

"odette, we'll take you," said mme. verdurin, "we've kept a little
corner specially for you, beside m. de forcheville."

"yes, mme. verdurin," said odette meekly.

"what! i thought i was to take you home," cried swann, flinging
discretion to the winds, for the carriage-door hung open, time was
precious, and he could not, in his present state, go home without her.

"but mme. verdurin has asked me..."

"that's all right, you can quite well go home alone; we've left you like

"but i had something important to tell mme. de crécy."

"very well, you can write it to her instead."

"good-bye," said odette, holding out her hand.

he tried hard to smile, but could only succeed in looking utterly
dejected.

"what do you think of the airs that swann is pleased to put on with
us?" mme. verdurin asked her husband when they had reached home. "i was
afraid he was going to eat me, simply because we offered to take odette
back. it really is too bad, that sort of thing. why doesn't he say,
straight out, that we keep a disorderly house? i can't conceive how
odette can stand such manners. he positively seems to be saying, all the
time, 'you belong to me!' i shall tell odette exactly what i think about
it all, and i hope she will have the sense to understand me." a moment
later she added, inarticulate with rage: "no, but, don't you see, the
filthy creature..." using unconsciously, and perhaps in satisfaction of
the

arriage had moved
on, and swann's took its place, his coachman, catching sight of his
face, asked whether he was unwell, or had heard bad news.

swann sent him away; he preferred to walk, and it was on foot, through
the bois, that he came home. he talked to himself, aloud, and in
the same slightly affected tone which he had been used to adopt
when describing the charms of the 'little nucleus' and extolling the
magnanimity of the verdurins. but just as the conversation, the smiles,
the kisses of odette became as odious to him as he had once found
them charming, if they were diverted to others than himself, so the
verdurins' drawing-room, which, not an hour before, had still seemed
to him amusing, inspired with a genuine feeling for art and even with
a sort of moral aristocracy, now that it was another than himself whom
odette was going to meet there, to love there without restraint, laid
bare to him all its absurdities, its stupidity, its shame.

the cottards would be there; possibly brichot. "could anything be more
grotesque than the lives of these little creatures, hanging on to one
another like that. they'd imagine they were utterly lost, upon my soul
they would, if they didn't all meet again to-morrow at _chatou_!"
alas! there would be the painter there also, the painter who enjoyed
match-making, who would invite forcheville to come with odette to his
studio. he could see odette, in a dress far too smart for the country,
"for she is so vulgar in that way, and, poor little thing, she is such a
fool!"

he could hear the jokes that mme. verdurin would make after dinner,
jokes which, whoever the 'bore' might be at whom they were aimed,
had always amused him because he could watch odette laughing at them,
laughing with him, her laughter almost a part of his. now he felt that
it was possibly at him that they would make odette laugh. "what a

sprawl and crawl and bawl their cheap obscenities, that i cannot
possibly be spattered by the witticisms of a verdurin!" he cried,
tossing up his head and arrogantly straightening his body. "god knows
that i have honestly attempted to pull odette out of that sewer, and to
teach her to breathe a nobler and a purer air. but human patience has
its limits, and mine is at an end," he concluded, as though this sacred
mission to tear odette away from an atmosphere of sarcasms dated from
longer than a few minutes ago, as though he had not undertaken it only
since it had occurred to him that those sarcasms might, perchance, be
directed at himself, and might have the effect of detaching odette from
him.

he could see the pianist sitting down to p

lay the moonlight sonata, and
the grimaces of mme. verdurin, in terrified anticipation of the wrecking
of her nerves by beethoven's music. "idiot, liar!" he shouted, "and a
creature like that imagines that she's fond of _art_!" she would say to
odette, after deftly insinuating a few words of praise for forcheville,
as she had so often done for himself: "you can make room for m. de
forcheville there, can't you, odette?"... '"in the dark!' codfish!
pander!"... 'pander' was the name he applied also to the music which
would invite them to sit in silence, to dream together, to gaze in each
other's eyes, to feel for each other's hands. he felt that there was
much to be said, after all, for a sternly censorous attitude towards
the arts, such as plato adopted, and bossuet, and the old school of
education in france.

in a word, the life which they led at the verdurins', which he had so
often described as 'genuine,'

with such infamy, such dung."

but, just as the virtues which he had still attributed, an hour or so
earlier, to the verdurins, would not have sufficed, even although the
verdurins had actually possessed them, if they had not also favoured
and protected his love, to excite swann to that state of intoxication
in which he waxed tender over their magnanimity, an intoxication which,
even when disseminated through the medium of other persons, could
have come to him from odette alone;--so the immorality (had it really
existed) which he now found in the verdurins would have been powerless,
if they had not invited odette with forcheville and without him, to
unstop the vials of his wrath and to make him scarify their 'infamy.'
doubtless swann's voice shewed a finer perspicacity than his own when it
refused to utter those words full of disgust at the verdurins and their
circle, and of joy at his having shaken himself free of it, save in an
artificial and rhetorical tone,

ce of a scientific truth
which contradicted everything that he had previously believed, but was
supported by an irresistible weight of evidence; with timorous
emotion he bowed his head over his plate, and merely replied:
"oh--oh--oh--oh--oh!" traversing, in an orderly retirement of his
forces, into the depths of his being, along a descending scale, the
whole compass of his voice. after which there was no more talk of swann
at the verdurins'.

and so that drawing-room which had brought swann and odette together
became an obstacle in the way of their meeting. she no longer said to
him, as she had said in the early days of their love: "we shall meet,
anyhow, to-morrow evening; there's a supper-party at the verdurins',"
but "we sha'n't be able to meet to-morrow evening; there's a
supper-party at the verdurins'." or else the verdurins were taking her
to the opéra-comique, to see _une nuit de cléopâtre_, and swann could
read in her eyes that terror lest he should ask her not to go, which,
but a

ot arrived at the
stage of understanding that there are evenings on which anyone with
the least shade of refinement of feeling should be willing to forego
an amusement when she is asked to do so. she ought to have the sense to
say: 'i shall not go,' if it were only from policy, since it is by what
she answers now that the quality of her soul will be determined once and
for all." and having persuaded himself that it was solely, after all,
in order that he might arrive at a favourable estimate of odette's
spiritual worth that he wished her to stay at home with him that evening
instead of going to the opéra-comique, he adopted the same line of
reasoning with her, with the same degree of insincerity as he had
used with himself, or even with a degree more, for in her case he was
yielding also to the desire to capture her by her own self-esteem.

"i swear to you," he told her, shortly before she was to leave for the
theatre, "that, in asking you not to go, i should hope, were i a
selfish man, for

d and have not the intelligence to raise yourself

though it had been a matter of little or no importance, to give up your
_nuit de cléopâtre_ (since you compel me to sully my lips with so abject
a name), in the hope that you would go to it none the less. but, since
i had resolved to weigh you in the balance, to make so grave an issue
depend upon your answer, i considered it more honourable to give you due
warning."

meanwhile, odette had shewn signs of increasing emotion and uncertainty.
although the meaning of his tirade was beyond her, she grasped that it
was to be included among the scenes of reproach or supplication, scenes
which her familiarity with the ways of men enabled her, without paying
any heed to the words that were uttered, to conclude that men would not
make unless they were in love; that, from the moment when they were in
love, it was superfluous to obey them, since they would only be more in
love later on.

er, would be her
refusal to abandon the habit of lying. "even from the point of view of
coquetry, pure and simple," he had told her, "can't you see how much
of your attraction you throw away when you stoop to lying? by a frank
admission--how many faults you might redeem! really, you are far less
intelligent than i supposed!" in vain, however, did swann expound to
her thus all the reasons that she had for not lying; they might have
succeeded in overthrowing any universal system of mendacity, but odette
had no such system; she contented herself, merely, whenever she wished
swann to remain in ignorance of anything that she had done, with not
telling him of it. so that a lie was, to her, something to be used only
as a special expedient; and the one thing that could make her decide
whether she should avail herself of a lie or not was a reason which,
too, was of a special and contingent order, namely the risk of swann's
discovering that she had not told him the truth.

physically, she was passing

; she was
growing stouter, and the expressive, sorrowful charm, the surprised,
wistful expressions which she had formerly had, seemed to have vanished
with her first youth, with the result that she became most precious to
swann at the very moment when he found her distinctly less good-looking.
he would gaze at her for hours on end, trying to recapture the charm
which he had once seen in her and could not find again. and yet the
knowledge that, within this new and strange chrysalis, it was still
odette that lurked, still the same volatile temperament, artful and
evasive, was enough to keep swann seeking, with as much passion as ever,
to captivate her. then he would look at photographs of her, taken two
years before, and would remember how exquisite she had been. and that
would console him, a little, for all the sufferings that he voluntarily

whose aunt had remained in paris: "she will be only too glad to be rid
of you for a day. how on earth could she be anxious, when she knows
you're with us? anyhow, i'll take you all under my wing; she can put the
blame on me."

if this attempt failed, m. verdurin would set off across country until
he came to a telegraph office or some other kind of messenger, after
first finding out which of the 'faithful' had anyone whom they must
warn. but odette would thank him, and assure him that she had no message
for anyone, for she had told swann, once and for all, that she could
not possibly send messages to him, before all those people, without
compromising herself. sometimes she would be absent for several days
on end, when the verdurins took her to see the tombs at dreux, or to
compiègne, on the painter's advice, to watch the sun setting through the
forest--after which they went on to the château of pierrefonds.

afternoon, in the evening, even in the morning. the ways? more than
that, the authority, the right to join her. for, after all, the
time-table, and the trains themselves, were not meant for dogs. if the
public were carefully informed, by means of printed advertisements, that
at eight o'clock in the morning a train started for pierrefonds which
arrived there at ten, that could only be because going to pierrefonds
was a lawful act, for which permission from odette would be superfluous;
an act, moreover, which might be performed from a motive altogether
different from the desire to see odette, since persons who had never
even heard of her performed it daily, and in such numbers as justified
the labour and expense of stoking the engines.

so it came to this; that she could not prevent him from going to
pierrefonds if he chose to do so. now that was precisely what he found
that he did choose to do, and would at that moment be doing were he,

time past he had wanted to form a more definite impression of
viollet-le-duc's work as a restorer. and the weather being what it was,
he felt an overwhelming desire to spend the day roaming in the forest of
compiègne.

it was, indeed, a piece of bad luck that she had forbidden him access
to the one spot that tempted him to-day. to-day! why, if he went down
there, in defiance of her prohibition, he would be able to see her that
very day! but then, whereas, if she had met, at pierref

would complain that she was being followed, would love him less in
consequence, might even turn away in anger when she caught sight of him.
"so, then, i am not to be allowed to go away for a day anywhere!" she
would reproach him on her return, whereas in fact it was he himself who
was not allowed to go.

he had had the sudden idea, so as to contrive to visit compiègne and
pierrefonds without letting it be supposed that his object was to meet
odette, of securing an invitation from one of his friends, the marquis
de forestelle, who had a country house in that neighbourhood. this
friend, to whom swann suggested the plan without disclosing its
ulterior purpose, was beside himself with joy; he did not conceal his
astonishment at swann's consenting at last, after fifteen years, to come
down and visit his property, and since he did not (he told him) wish
to stay there, promised to spend some days, at least, in taking him for
walks and excursions

already with m. de forestelle. even before he saw odette, even if he did
not succeed in seeing her there, what a joy it would be to set foot on
that soil where, not knowing the exact spot in which, at any moment, she
was to be found, he would feel all around him the thrilling possibility
of her suddenly appearing: in the courtyard of the château, now
beautiful in his eyes since it was on her account that he had gone to
visit it; in all the streets of the town, which struck him as romantic;
down every ride of the forest, roseate with the deep and ten

sunset;--innumerable and alternative hiding-places, to which would fly
simultaneously for refuge, in the uncertain ubiquity of his hopes, his
happy, vagabond and divided heart. "we mustn't, on any account," he
would warn m. de forestelle, "run across odette and the verdurins. i
have just heard that they are at pierrefonds, of all places, to-day. one
has plenty of time to see them in paris; it would hardly be worth while
coming down here if one couldn't go a yard without meeting them." and
his host would fail to understand why, once they had reached the place,
swann would change his plans twenty times in an hour, inspect the
dining-rooms of all the hotels in compiègne without being able to make
up his mind to settle down in any of them, although h

e had found no
trace anywhere of the verdurins, seeming to be in search of what he had
claimed to be most anxious to avoid, and would in fact avoid, the moment
he found it, for if he had come upon the little 'group,' he would have
hastened away at once with studied indifference, satisfied that he had
seen odette and she him, especially that she had seen him when he was
not, apparently, thinking about her. but no; she would guess at
once that it was for her sake that he had come there. and when m. de
forestelle came to fetch him, and it was time to start, he excused
himself: "no, i'm afraid not; i can't go to pierrefonds to-day. you see,
odette is there." and swann was happy in spite of everything in feeling
that if he, alone among mortals, had not the right to go to pierrefonds
that day, it was because

 he was in fact, for odette, some one who
differed from all other mortals, her lover; and because that restriction
which for him alone was set upon the universal right to travel freely
where one would, was but one of the many forms of that slavery, that
love which was so dear to him. decidedly, it was better not to risk a
quarrel with her, to be patient, to wait for her return. he spent his
days in poring over a map of the forest of compiègne, as though it
had been that of the 'pays du tendre'; he surrounded himself with

postponed her departure, what trains were still left for her to take. he
did not leave the house, for fear of missing a telegram, he did not go
to bed, in case, having come by the last train, she decided to surprise
him with a midnight visit. yes! the front-door bell rang. there seemed
some delay in opening the door, he wanted to awaken the porter, he
leaned out of the window to shout to odette, if it was odette, for
in spite of the orders which he had gone downstairs a dozen times to
deliver in person, they were quite capable of telling her that he was
not at home. it was only a servant coming in. he noticed the incessant
rumble of passing carriages, to which he had never before paid any
attention. he could hear them, one after another, a long way off, coming
nearer, passing his door without stopping, and bearing away into the
distance a message which was not for him. he waited all n

been in paris since midday; it had not occurred to her to tell him; not
knowing what to do with herself she had spent the evening alone at a
theatre, had long since gone home to bed, and was peacefully asleep.

as a matter of fact, she had never given him a thought. and such moments
as these, in which she forgot swann's very existence, were of more value
to odette, did more to attach him to her, than all her infidelities. for
in this way swann was kept in that state of painful agitation which had
once before been effective in making his interest blossom into love, on
the night when he had failed to find odette at the verdurins' and had
hunted for her all evening. and he did not have (as i had, afterwards,
at combray in my childhood) happy days in which to forget the sufferings
that would return with the night. for his days, swann must pass them

staying at home, he would go for luncheon to a restaurant not far off,
to which he had been attracted, some time before, by the excellence of
its cookery, but to which he now went only for one of those reasons,
at once mystical and absurd, which people call 'romantic'; because this
restaurant (which, by the way, still exists) bore the same name as the
street in which odette lived: the lapérouse. sometimes, when she had
been away on a short visit somewhere, several days would elapse before
she thought of letting him know that she had returned to paris. and
then she would say quite simply, without taking (as she would once have
taken) the precaution of covering herself, at all costs, with a little
fragment borrowed from the truth, that she had just, at that very
moment, arrived by the morning train. what she said was a falsehood;

evented from forming a mental picture of
what she was saying, while she said it, by the contradictory picture, in
her mind, of whatever quite different thing she had indeed been doing at
the moment when she pretended to have been alighting from the train. in
swann's mind, however, these words, meeting no opposition, settled
and hardened until they assumed the indestructibility of a truth so
indubitable that, if some friend happened to tell him that he had
come by the same train and had not seen odette, swann would have been
convinced that it was his friend who had made a mistake as to the day or
hour, since his version did not agree with the words uttered by odette.
these words had never appeared to him false except when, before hearing
them, he had suspected that they were going to be. for him to believe
that she was lying, an anticipatory suspicion was indispensable. it was
also, however, sufficient. given that, everything that odette might say
appeared to him suspect. did she mention a na

of one of her lovers; once this supposition had taken shape, he would
spend weeks in tormenting himself; on one occasion he even approached a
firm of 'inquiry agents' to find out the address and the occupation of
the unknown rival who would give him no peace until he could be proved
to have gone abroad, and who (he ultimately learned) was an uncle of
odette, and had been dead for twenty years.

although she would not allow him, as a rule, to meet her at public
gatherings, saying that people would talk, it happened occasionally
that, at an evening party to which he and she had each been invited--at
forcheville's, at the painter's, or at a charity ball given in one of
the ministries--he found himself in the same room with her. he could
see her, but dared not remain for fear of annoying her by seeming to be
spying upon the pleasures which she tasted

the
evenings when he came to dine with us at combray--seemed illimitable to
him since he had not been able to see their end. and, once or twice,
he derived from such evenings that kind of happiness which one would be
inclined (did it not originate in so violent a reaction from an anxiety
abruptly terminated) to call peaceful, since it consists in a pacifying
of the mind: he had looked in for a moment at a revel in the painter's
studio, and was getting ready to go home; he was leaving behind him
odette, transformed into a brilliant stranger, surrounded by men to whom
her glances and her gaiety, which were not for him, seemed to hint at
some voluptuous pleasure to be enjoyed there or elsewhere (possibly at
the bal des incohérents, to which he trembled to think that she might be
going on afterwards) which made swann more jealous than the thought of
their actual physical union, since it was more difficult to imagine; he
was opening the door to go, when he heard himself called back in these

s (which, by cutting off from the party that possible ending which
had so appalled him, made the party itself seem innocent in retrospect,
made odette's return home a thing no longer inconceivable and terrible,
but tender and familiar, a thing that kept close to his side, like
a part of his own daily life, in his carriage; a thing that stripped
odette herself of the excess of brilliance and gaiety in her appearance,
shewed that it was only a disguise which she had assumed for a moment,
for his sake and not in view of any mysterious pleasures, a disguise of
which she had already wearied)--in these words, which odette flung out
after him as he was crossing the threshold: "can't you wait a minute for
me? i'm just going; we'll drive back together and you can drop me." it
was true that on one occasion forcheville had asked to be driven home at

allowed to come in too, she had replied, with a finger pointed at swann:
"ah! that depends on this gentleman. you must ask him. very well, you
may come in, just for a minute, if you insist, but you mustn't stay
long, for, i warn you, he likes to sit and talk quietly with me, and
he's not at all pleased if i have visitors when he's here. oh, if you
only knew the creature as i know him; isn't that so, my love, there's no
one that really knows you, is there, except me?"

he spectacle of her
addressing him thus, in front of forcheville, not only in these tender
words of predilection, but also with certain criticisms, such as: "i
feel sure you haven't written yet to your friends, about dining with
them on sunday. you needn't go if you don't want to, but you might at
least be polite," or "now, have you left your essay on vermeer here, so
that you can do a little more to it to-morrow? what a lazy-bones! i'm
going to make you work, i can tell you," which proved that odette kept
herself in touch with his social engagements and his literary work, that
they had indeed a life in common. and as she spoke she bestowed on him a
smile which he interpreted as meaning that she was entirely his.

and then, while she was making them some orangeade, suddenly, just as
when the reflector of a lamp that is badly fitted begins by casting
all round an object, on the wall beyond it, huge and fantastic shadows
which, in time, contract and are lost in the shadow of the object
itself,

 all the terrible and disturbing ideas which he had formed of
odette melted away and vanished in the charming creature who stood there
before his eyes. he had the sudden suspicion that this hour spent in
odette's house, in the lamp-light, was, perhaps, after all, not an
artificial hour, invented for his special use (with the object of
concealing that frightening and delicious thing which was incessantly
in his thoughts without his ever being able to form a satisfactory
impression of it, an hour of odette's real life, of her life when he was
not there, looking on) with theatrical properties and pasteboard fruits,
but was perhaps a genuine hour of odette's life; that, if he himself
had not been there, s

he would have pulled forward the same armchair for
forcheville, would have poured out for him, not any unknown brew, but
precisely that orangeade which she was now offering to them both; that
the world inhabited by odette was not that other world, fearful and
supernatural, in which he spent his time in placing her--and which
existed, perhaps, only in his imagination, but the real universe,
exhaling no special atmosphere of gloom, comprising that table at which
he might sit down, presently, and write, and this drink which he was
being permitted, now, to taste; all the objects which he contemplated
with as much curiosity and admiration as gratitude, for if, in absorbing
his dreams, they had delivered him from an o

bsession, they themselves
were, in turn, enriched by the absorption; they shewed him the palpable
realisation of his fancies, and they interested his mind; they took
shape and grew solid before-his eyes, and at the same time they soothed
his troubled heart. ah! had fate but allowed him to share a single
dwelling with odette, so that in her house he should be in his own; if,
when asking his servant what there would be for luncheon, it had been
odette's bill of fare that he had learned from the reply; if, when
odette wished to go for a walk, in the morning, along the avenue du
bois-de-boulogne, his duty as a good husband had obliged him, though he
had no desire to go out, to accompany her, carrying her cloak when she
was too warm; and in the evening, after dinner, if she wished to stay at
home, and not to dress, if he had been forced to stay beside her, to
do what she asked; then how completely would all the trivial details

which seemed to him now so gloomy, simply because they
would, at the same time, have formed part of the life of odette, have
taken on--like that lamp, that orangeade, that armchair, which had
absorbed so much of his dreams, which materialised so much of his
longing,--a sort of superabundant sweetness and a mysterious solidity.

and yet he was inclined to suspect that the state for which he so much
longed was a calm, a peace, which would not have created an atmosphere
favourable to his love. when odette ceased to be for him a creature
always absent, regretted, imagined; when the feeling that he had for her

o longer the same mysterious disturbance that was wrought in him by
the phrase from the sonata, but constant affection and gratitude, when
those normal relations were established between them which would put an
end to his melancholy madness; then, no doubt, the actions of odette's
daily life would appear to him as being of but little intrinsic
interest--as he had several times, already, felt that they might be,
on the day, for instance, when he had read, through its envelope, her
letter to forcheville. examining his complaint with as much scientific
detachment as if he had inoculated himself with it in order to study
its effects, he told himself that, when he was cured of it, what odette
might or might not do would be indifferent to him. but in his morbid
state, to tel

l the truth, he feared death itself no more than such a
recovery, which would, in fact, amount to the death of all that he then
was.

after these quiet evenings, swann's suspicions would be temporarily
lulled; he would bless the name of odette, and next day, in the morning,
would order the most attractive jewels to be sent to her, because her
kindnesses to him overnight had excited either his gratitude, or the
desire to see them repeated, or a paroxysm of love for her which had
need of some such outlet.

but at other times, grief would again take hold of him; he would imagine
that odette was forcheville's mistress, and that, when they had both sat
watching him from the depths of the verdurins' landau, in the bois, on

she didn't seem particularly keen; she hasn't said yes or no yet. let's
hope that she'll refuse. good god! think of listening to wagner for a
fortnight on end with her, who takes about as much interest in music as
a fish does in little apples; it will be fun!" and his hatred, like
his love, needing to manifest itself in action, he amused himself with
urging his evil imaginings further and further, because, thanks to the
perfidies with which he charged odette, he detested her still more, and
would be able, if it turned out--as he tried to convince himself--that
she was indeed guilty of them, to take the opportunity of punishing her,
emptying upon her the overflowing vials of his wrath. in this way, he
went so far as to suppose that he was going to receive a letter from
her, in which she would ask him for money to take the house at bayreuth,
but with the warning that he was not to come there himself, as she had
promised forcheville and the verdurins

ng into the arms of
forcheville. at any rate, this loathsome expedition, it would not be
swann who had to pay for it. ah! if he could only manage to prevent
it, if she could sprain her ankle before starting, if the driver of the
carriage which was to take her to the station would consent (no matter
how great the bribe) to smuggle her to some place where she could be
kept for a time in seclusion, that perfidious woman, her eyes tinselled
with a smile of complicity for forcheville, which was what odette had
become for swann in the last forty-eight hours.

but she was never that for very long; after a few days the shining,
crafty eyes lost their brightness and their duplicity, that picture of
an execrable odette saying to forcheville: "look at him storming!" began
to grow pale and to dissolve. then gradually reappeared and rose before
him, softly radiant, the face of the other odette, of that odette who
also turned with a smile to forcheville, but with a smile in which there
was nothing but aff

ection for swann, when she said: "you mustn't stay
long, for this gentleman doesn't much like my having visitors when he's
here. oh! if you only knew the creature as i know him!" that same smile
with which she used to thank swann for some instance of his courtesy
which she prized so highly, for some advice for which she had asked him
in one of those grave crises in her life, when she could turn to him
alone.

then, to this other odette, he would ask himself what could have induced
him to write that outrageous letter, of which, probably, until then,
she had never supposed him capable, a letter which must have lowered him
from the high, from the supreme place which, by his generosity, by his
loyalty, he had won for himself in her esteem. he would become less dear
to her, since it was for those qualities, which she found neither in
forcheville nor in any other, that she loved him. it was for them that
odette so often shewed him

kindness, which counted for less
than nothing in his moments of jealousy, because it was not a sign of
reciprocal desire, was indeed a proof rather of affection than of love,
but the importance of which he began once more to feel in proportion as
the spontaneous relaxation of his suspicions, often accelerated by the
distraction brought to him by reading about art or by the conversation
of a friend, rendered his passion less exacting of reciprocities.

now that, after this swing of the pendulum, odette had naturally
returned to the place from which swann's jealousy had for the moment
driven her, in the angle in which he found her charming, he pictured her
to himself as full of tenderness, with a look of consent in her eyes,
and so beautiful that he could not refrain from moving his lips towards
her, as though she had actually been in the room for him to kiss; and
he preserved a sense of gratitude to her for that bewitching, kindly
glance, as strong as though she had really looked thus at him,

distress he must have caused her! certainly he found adequate
reasons for his resentment, but they would not have been sufficient to
make him feel that resentment, if he had not so passionately loved her.
had he not nourished grievances, just as serious, against other women,
to whom he would, none the less, render willing service to-day, feeling
no anger towards them because he no longer loved them? if the day ever
came when he would find himself in the same state of indifference with
regard to odette, he would then understand that it was his jealousy
alone which had led him to find something atrocious, unpardonable, in
this desire (after all, so natural a desire, springing from a childlike
ingenuousness and also from a certain delicacy in her nature) to be
able, in her turn, when an occasion offered, to repay the verdurins for
their hospitality, and to play the hostess in a house of her own.

he returned to the other point of view--opposite to that of his love
and of his jealousy, to which 
 
 ___________________________
 
he resorted at times by a sort of mental
equity, and in order to make allowance for different eventualities--from
which he tried to form a fresh judgment of odette, based on the
supposition that he had never been in love with her, that she was to him
just a woman like other women, that her life had not been (whenever he
himself was not present) different, a texture woven in secret apart from
him, and warped against him.

wherefore believe that she would enjoy down there with forcheville or
with other men intoxicating pleasures which she had never known with
him, and which his jealousy alone had fabricated in all their elements?

f it should happen that forcheville thought
of him at all, it would only be as of some one who counted for a great
deal in the life of odette, some one for whom he was obliged to make
way, when they met in her house. if forcheville and she scored a
triumph by being down there together in spite of him, it was he who had
engineered that triumph by striving in vain to prevent her from going
there, whereas if he had approved of her plan, which for that matter was
quite defensible, she would have had the appearance of being there by
his counsel, she would have felt herself sent there, housed there by
him, and for the pleasure which she de

happy, grateful, and he would have the joy--the sight of her face--which
he had not known for nearly a week, a joy which none other could
replace. for the moment that swann was able to form a picture of her
without revulsion, that he could see once again the friendliness in
her smile, and that the desire to tear her away from every rival was
no longer imposed by his jealousy upon his love, that love once again
became, more than anything, a taste for the sensations which odette's
person gave him, for the pleasure which he found in admiring, as one
might a spectacle, or in questioning, as one might a phenomenon, the
birth of one of her glances, the formation of one of her smiles, the
utterance of an intonation of her voice. and this pleasure, different
from every other, had in the end created in him a need of her, which
she alone, by her presence or by her letters, could assuage, almost as
disinterested, almost as artistic, as perverse as another need which

unlooked-for enrichment of his life, any more than a person in delicate
health who from a certain moment grows stronger, puts on flesh, and
seems for a time to be on the road to a complete recovery:--this
other need, which, too, developed in him independently of the visible,
material world, was the need to listen to music and to learn to know it.

and so, by the chemical process of his malady, after he had created
jealousy out of his love, he began again to generate tenderness, pity
for odette. she had become once more the old odette, charming and kind.
he was full of remorse for having treated her harshly. he wished her to
come to him, and, before she came, he wished to have already procured
for her some pleasure, so as to watch her gratitude taking shape in her
face and moulding her smile.

so, too, odette, certain of seeing him come to her in a few days,
as tender and submissive as before, and plead with her for a
reconciliation, became inured, was no longer afraid of displeasing

or even of making him angry, and refused him, whenever it suited her,
the favours by which he set most store.

perhaps she did not realise how sincere he had been with her during
their quarrel, when he had told her that he would not send her any
money, but would do what he could to hurt her. perhaps she did not
realise, either, how sincere he still was, if not with her, at any rate
with himself, on other occasions when, for the sake of their future
relations, to shew odette that he was capable of doing without her, that
a rupture was still possible between them, he decided to wait some time
before going to see her again.

sometimes several days had elapsed, during which she had caused him no
fresh anxiety; and as, from the next few visits which he would pay her,
he knew that he was likely to derive not any great pleasure, but, more
probably, some annoyance which would put an end to the state of calm in
which he found himself, he wrote to her that he was very busy,

hy; his suspicions, his grief,
again took hold of him. he could no longer abide, in the new state of
agitation into which he found himself plunged, by the arrangements which
he had made in his preceding state of comparative calm; he would run
to find her, and would insist upon seeing her on each of the following
days. and even if she had not written first, if she merely acknowledged
his letter, it was enough to make him unable to rest without seeing
her. for, upsetting all swann's calculations, odette's acceptance had
entirely changed his attitude. like everyone who possesses something
precious, so as to know what would happen if he ceased for a moment to
possess it, he had detached the precious object from his mind, leaving,
as he thought, everything else in the same state as when it was there.
but the absence of one part from a whole is not only that, it is not
simply a partial omission, it is a disturbance of all the other parts, a
new state which it was impossible to foresee from the old

but at other times--when odette was on the point of going away for a
holiday--it was after some trifling quarrel for which he had chosen the
pretext, that he decided not to write to her and not to see her until
her return, giving the appearance (and expecting the reward) of
a serious rupture, which she would perhaps regard as final, to a
separation, the greater part of which was inevitable, since she was
going away, which, in fact, he was merely allowing to start a little
sooner than it must. at once he could imagine odette,

puzzled, anxious,
distressed at having received neither visit nor letter from him and this
picture of her, by calming his jealousy, made it easy for him to break
himself of the habit of seeing her. at odd moments, no doubt, in the
furthest recesses of his brain, where his determination had thrust
it away, and thanks to the length of the interval, the three weeks'
separation to which he had agreed, it was with pleasure that he would
consider the idea that he would see odette again on her return; but it
was also with so little impatience that he began to ask himself whether
he would not readily consent to the doubling of the period of so easy an
abstinence. it had lasted, so far, but three days, a much shorter time
than he had often, before, passed without seeing odette, and without
having, as on this occasion he had, premeditated a separation. and
yet, there and then, some tiny trace of contrariety in his mind, or
of weakness in his body,--by inciting him to regard

 the present as an
exceptional moment, one not to be governed by the rules, one in which
prudence itself would allow him to take advantage of the soothing
effects of a pleasure and to give his will (until the time should come
when its efforts might serve any purpose) a holiday--suspended the
action of his will, which ceased to exert its inhibitive control; or,
without that even, the thought of some information for which he had
forgotten to ask odette, such as if she had decided in what colour she
would have her carriage repainted, or, with regard to some investment,
whether they were 'ordinary' or 'preference' shares that she wished him
to buy (for it was all very well to shew her that he could live without
seeing her, but if, after that, the carriage had to be painted over
again, if the shares produced no dividend, a fine lot of good he would
have done),--and suddenly, like a stretched piece of elastic which is

matic machine which is ripped open, the idea
of seeing her again, from the remote point in time to which it had been
attached, sprang back into the field of the present and of immediate
possibilities.

it sprang back thus without meeting any further resistance, so
irresistible, in fact, that swann had been far less unhappy in watching
the end gradually approaching, day by day, of the fortnight which he
must spend apart from odette, than he was when kept waiting ten minutes
while his coachman brought round the carriage which was to take him to
her, minutes which he passed in transports of impatience and joy, in
which he recaptured a thousand times over, to lavish on it all the
wealth of his affection, that idea of his meeting with odette, which, by
so abrupt a repercussion, at a moment when he supposed it so remote, was
once more present and on the very surface of his consciousness. the fact
was that this idea no longer f

long habit had enfeebled, but which had acquired new vigour
during this privation, not of three days but of a fortnight (for a
period of abstinence may be calculated, by anticipation, as having
lasted already until the final date assigned to it), and had converted
what had been, until then, a pleasure in store, which could easily be
sacrificed, into an unlooked-for happiness which he was powerless to
resist. finally, the idea returned to him with its beauty enhanced by
his own ignorance of what odette might have thought, might, perhaps,
have done on finding that he shewed no sign of life, with the result
that he was going now to meet with the entrancing revelation of an
odette almost unknown.

but she, just as she had supposed that his refusal to send her money was
only a feint, saw nothing but a pretext in the question which he came,
now, to ask her, about the repainting of her carriage, or the purchase
of stock. for she could not reconstruct the several phases of these
crises through which

 he passed, and in the general idea which she formed
of them she made no attempt to understand their mechanism, looking only
to what she knew beforehand, their necessary, never-failing and always
identical termination. an imperfect idea (though possibly all the more
profound in consequence), if one were to judge it from the point of
view of swann, who would doubtless have considered that odette failed
to understand him, just as a morphinomaniac or a consumptive, each
persuaded that he has been thrown back, one by some outside event,
at the moment when he was just going to shake himself free from his
inveterate habit, the other by an accidental indisposition at the
moment when he was just going to be finally cured, feels himself to be
misunderstood by the doctor who does not attach the same importance
to these pretended contingencies, mere disguises, according to him,

certain affections) the boldest of surgeons ask themselves whether
to deprive a patient of his vice or to rid him of his malady is still
reasonable, or indeed possible.

certainly, of the extent of this love swann had no direct knowledge.
when he sought to measure it, it happened sometimes that he found it
diminished, shrunken almost to nothing; for instance, the very moderate
liking, amounting almost to dislike, which, in the days before he was
in love with odette, he had felt for her expressive features, her faded
complexion, returned on certain days. "really, i am making distinct
headway," he would tell himself on the morrow, "when i come to think it
over carefully, i find out that i got hardly any pleasure, last night,
out of being in bed with her; it's an odd thing, but i actually thought
her ugly." and certainly he was sincere, but his love extended a long
way beyond the province of physical desire. odette's person, indeed,
no longer held any great

photograph of odette on his table, or when she came to see him, he
had difficulty in identifying her face, either in the flesh or on the
pasteboard, with the painful and continuous anxiety which dwelt in his
mind. he would say to himself, almost with astonishment, "it is she!" as
when suddenly some one shews us in a detached, externalised form one
of our own maladies, and we find in it no resemblance to what we are
suffering. "she?"--he tried to ask himself what that meant; for it

tirely one with him that it would have been impossible to wrest it
away without almost entirely destroying him; as surgeons say, his case
was past operation.

by this love swann had been so far detached from all other interests
that when by chance he reappeared in the world of fashion, reminding
himself that his social relations, like a beautifully wrought setting
(although she would not have been able to form any very exact estimate
of its worth), might, still, add a little to his own value in odette's
eyes (as indeed they might have done had they not been cheapened by his
love itself, which for odette depreciated everything that it touched by
seeming to denounce such things as less precious than itself), he would
feel there, simultaneously with his distress at being in places and
among people that she did not know, the same detached sense of pleasure
as he would have derived from a novel or a painting in which were
depicted the amusements of a leisured class; just as, at home, he used
to e

ew pleasure which
swann was tasting was that he could emigrate for a moment into those few
and distant parts of himself which had remained almost foreign to his
love and to his pain. in this respect the personality, with which my
great-aunt endowed him, of 'young swann,' as distinct from the more
individual personality of charles swann, was that in which he now most
delighted. once when, because it was the birthday of the princesse de
parme (and because she could often be of use, indirectly, to odette,
by letting her have seats for galas and jubilees and all that sort of
thing), he had decided to send her a basket of fruit, and was not quite
sure where or how to order it, he had entrusted the task to a cousin of
his mother who, delighted to be doing a commission for him, had written
to him, laying stress on the fact that she had not chosen all the fruit
at the same place, but the grapes from crapote, whose speciality they
were, the straw berries from jauret, the pears from chevet, who always

in her own fine clothes, marked with her name, not darned at all (or so
exquisitely darned that it merely enhanced one's idea of the skill and
patience of the seamstress), a shroud from the constant image of which
in her mind's eye she drew a certain satisfactory sense, if not actually
of wealth and prosperity, at any rate of self-esteem. but most of
all,--since in every one of his actions and thoughts which had reference
to odette, swann was constantly subdued and swayed by the unconfessed
feeling that he was, perhaps not less dear, but at least less welcome
to her than anyone, even the most wearisome of the verdurins'
'faithful,'--when he betook himself to a world in which he was the
paramount example of taste, a man whom no pains were spared to attract,
whom people were genuinely sorry not to see, he began once again to
believe in the existence of a happier life, almost to feel an appetite

if he was obliged to make excuses to his fashionable friends for not
paying them visits, it was precisely for the visits that he did pay her
that he sought to excuse himself to odette. he still paid them (asking
himself at the end of each month whether, seeing that he had perhaps
exhausted her patience, and had certainly gone rather often to see her,
it would be enough if he sent her four thousand francs), and for each
visit he found a pretext, a present that he had to bring her, some

expostulate that he wished to advertise their relations in public, that
he was treating her like a woman off the streets. things came to such a
pitch that, in an effort to save himself from being altogether forbidden
to meet her anywhere, swann, remembering that she knew and was deeply
attached to my great-uncle adolphe, whose friend he himself also
had been, went one day to see him in his little flat in the rue
de bellechasse, to ask him to use his influence with odette. as it
happened, she invariably adopted, when she spoke to swann about my
uncle, a poetical tone, saying: "ah, he! he is not in the least
like you; it is an exquisite thing, a great, a beautiful thing, his
friendship for me. he's not the sort of man who would have so little
consideration for me as to let himself be seen with me everywhere in
public." this was embarrassing for swann, who did not know quite to what
rhetorical pitch he should screw himself up in speaking of odette to my
uncle. he

began by alluding to her excellence, _a priori_, the axiom
of her seraphic super-humanity, the revelation of her inexpressible
virtues, no conception of which could possibly be formed. "i should
like to speak to you about her," he went on, "you, who know what a woman
supreme above all women, what an adorable being, what an angel odette
is. but you know, also, what life is in paris. everyone doesn't see
odette in the light in which you and i have been privileged to see her.
and so there are people who think that i am behaving rather foolishly;
she won't even allow me to meet her out of doors, at the theatre. now
you, in whom she has such enormous confidence, couldn't you say a few
words for me to her, just to assure her that she exaggerate the harm
which my bowing to her in the street might do her?"

my uncle advised swann not to see odette for some days, after which she
would love him all the more;

everywhere, and as often as he pleased. a few days later odette told
swann that she had just had a rude awakening; she had discovered that
my uncle was the same as other men; he had tried to take her by assault.
she calmed swann, who, at first, was for rushing out to challenge my
uncle to a duel, but he refused to shake hands with him when they met
again. he regretted this rupture all the more because he had hoped, if
he had met my uncle adolphe again sometimes and had contrived to talk

led, in the old days, at nice. for my uncle adolphe used to spend the
winter there, and swann thought that it might indeed have been there,
perhaps, that he had first known odette. the few words which some one
had let fall, in his hearing, about a man who, it appeared, had been
odette's lover, had left swann dumbfounded. but the very things which he
would, before knowing them, have regarded as the most terrible to
learn and the most impossible to believe, were, once he knew them,
incorporated for all time in the general mass of his sorrow; he admitted
them, he could no longer have understood their not existing. only,
each one of them in its passage traced an indelible line, altering the
picture that he had formed of his mistress. at one time indeed he felt
that he could unde

never have suspected odette, was perfectly well known, and that at baden
or nice, when she had gone, in the past, to spend several months in
one or the other place, she had enjoyed a sort of amorous notoriety.
he attempted, in order to question them, to get into touch again with
certain men of that stamp; but these were aware that he knew odette,
and, besides, he was afraid of putting the thought of her into their
heads, of setting them once more upon her track. but he, to whom,
up till then, nothing could have seemed so tedious as was all that
pertained to the cosmopolitan life of baden or of nice, now that
he learned that odette had, perhaps, led a 'gay' life once in those
pleasure-cities, although he could never find out whether it had been
solely to satisfy a want of money which, thanks to himself, she no

splendid profundity, such as a poet might have lent to them; and he
would have devoted to the reconstruction of all the insignificant
details that made up the daily round on the côte d'azur in those days,
if it could have helped him to understand something that still baffled
him in the smile or in the eyes of odette, more enthusiasm than does
the aesthete who ransacks the extant documents of fifteenth-century
florence, so as to try to penetrate further into the soul of the
primavera, the fair vanna or the venus of botticelli. he would sit,
often, without saying a word to her, only gazing at her and dreaming;

from the idea that she was an excellent creature, comparable to the best
women that he had known, he had passed to that of her bein

yet already, by an inverse process, he had returned from the odette de
crécy, perhaps too well known to the holiday-makers, to the 'ladies'
men' of nice and baden, to this face, the expression on which was so
often gentle, to this nature so eminently human. he would ask himself:
"what does it mean, after all, to say that everyone at nice knows who
odette de crécy is? reputations of that sort, even when they're true,
are always based upon other people's ideas"; he would reflect that this
legend--even if it were authentic--was something external to odette,
was not inherent in her like a mischievous and ineradicable personality;
that the creature who might have been led astray was a woman with frank
eyes, a heart full of pity for the sufferings of others, a docile body
which he had pressed tightly in his arms and explored with his fingers,

ad, her whole face would
seem to grow larger; then, suddenly, some ordinary human thought, some
worthy sentiment such as is to be found in all creatures when, in a
moment of rest or meditation, they are free to express themselves, would
flash out from her eyes like a ray of gold. and immediately the whole of
her face would light up like a grey landscape, swathed in clouds which,
suddenly, are swept away and the dull scene transfigured, at the moment
of the sun's setting. the life which occupied odette at such times, even
the future which she seemed to be dreamily regarding, swann could have
shared with her. no evil disturbance seemed to have left any effect on
them. rare as they became, those moments did not occur in vain. by the
process of memory, swann joined the fragments together, abolished the
intervals between them, cast, as in molten gold, the image of an odette
compact of kindness and tranquillity, for whom he was to make, later on
(as we shall see in the second part of this story) s

acrifices which the
other odette would never have won from him. but how rare those moments
were, and how seldom he now saw her! even in regard to their evening
meetings, she would never tell him until the last minute whether she
would be able to see him, for, reckoning on his being always free, she
wished first to be certain that no one else would offer to come to her.
she would plead that she was obliged to wait for an answer which was of
the very greatest importance, and if, even after she had made swann

to which there was no answer and transferring to some one else the
strain of interrogation. it is true that swann was little the wiser for
such information as he did receive. to know a thing does not enable us,
always, to prevent its happening, but after all the things that we know
we do hold, if not in our hands, at any rate in our minds, where we can
dispose of them as we choose, which gives us the illusion of a sort of
power to control them. he was quite happy whenever m. de charlus was
with odette. he knew that between m. de charlus and her nothing untoward
could ever happen, that when m. de charlus went anywhere with her, it
was out of friendship for himself, and that he would make no difficulty
about telling him everything that she had done. sometimes she had
declared so emphatically to swann that it was impossible for him to see
her on a particular evening, she seemed to be looking forward so keenly
to some outing, that swann attached a very real importance to the fact
that m. de char

lus was free to accompany her. next day, without daring
to put many questions to m. de charlus, he would force him, by appearing
not quite to understand his first answers, to give him more, after each
of which he would feel himself increasingly relieved, for he very
soon learned that odette had spent her evening in the most innocent of
dissipations.

"but what do you mean, my dear mémé, i don't quite understand.... you
didn't go straight from her house to the musée grévin? surely you went
somewhere else first? no? that is very odd! you don't know how amusing
you are, my dear mémé. but what an odd idea of hers to go on to the chat

"i saw mme. de crécy yesterday; she was with a man i didn't know."),
sentences which dropped into his heart and passed at once into a solid
state, grew hard as stalagmites, and seared and tore him as they lay
there irremovable,--how charming, by way of contrast, were the words:
"she didn't know a soul; she never spoke to a soul." how freely they
coursed through him, how fluid they were, how vaporous, how easy to
breathe! and yet, a moment later, he was telling himself that odette
must find him very dull if those were the pleasures that she preferred
to his company. and their very insignificance, though it reassured him,
pained him as if her enjoyment of them had been an act of treachery.

even when he could not discover where she had gone, it would have
sufficed to alleviate the anguish that he then felt, for which odette's
presence, the charm of her company, was the sole specific (a specific
which in the long run served, like many other remedies, to aggravate the

would have sufficed, had odette only permitted him to remain in her
house while she was out, to wait there until that hour of her return,
into whose stillness and peace would flow, to be mingled and lost there,
all memory of those intervening hours which some sorcery, some cursed
spell had made him imagine as, somehow, different from the rest. but she
would not; he must return home; he forced himself, on the way, to form
various plans, ceased to think of odette; he even reached the stage,
while he undressed, of turning over a

bed and turned out the light; but no sooner had he made himself ready
to sleep, relaxing a self-control of which he was not even conscious,
so habitual had it become, than an icy shudder convulsed his body and he
burst into sobs. he did not wish to know why, but dried his eyes, saying
with a smile: "this is delightful; i'm becoming neurasthenic." after
which he could not save himself from utter exhaustion at the thought
that, next day, he must begin afresh his attempt to find out what odette
had been doing, must use all his influence to contrive to see her. this
compulsion to an activity without respite, without variety, without
result, was so cruel a scourge that one day, noticing a swelling over
his stomach, he felt an actual joy in the idea that he had, perhaps, a
tumour which would prove fatal, that he need not concern himself with
anything further, that it was his malady which was going to govern his
life, to make a plaything of him, until the not-distant end. if indeed,

ents of a continuous state of ill-health which seem for a little
time to have delivered us from their predecessors. there were even
days when he was not tormented by any suspicion. he fancied that he was
cured. but next morning, when he awoke, he felt in the same place
the same pain, a sensation which, the day before, he had, as it were,
diluted in the torrent of different impressions. but it had not stirred
from its place. indeed, it was the sharpness of this pain that had
awakened him.

since odette never gave him any information as to those vastly important
matters which took up so much of her time every day (albeit he had lived
long enough in the world to know that such matters are never anything
else than pleasures) he could not sustain for any length of time the
effort to imagine them; his brain would become a void; then he would
pass a finger over his tired eyelids, in the same way as he might have
wiped his eyeglass, and would cease altogether to think. there

his unexplored tract, certain occupations which
reappeared from time to time, vaguely connected by odette with some
obligation towards distant relatives or old friends who, inasmuch as
they were the only people whom she was in the habit of mentioning
as preventing her from seeing him, seemed to swann to compose the
necessary, unalterable setting of her life. because of the tone in which
she referred, from time to time, to "the day when i go with my friend
to the hippodrome," if, when he felt unwell and had thought, "perhaps
odette would be kind and come to see me," he remembered, suddenly, that

was one of those very days, he would correct himself with an "oh,
no! it's not worth while asking her to come; i should have thought of it
before, this is the day when she goes with her friend to the hippodrome.
we must confine ourselves to what is possible; no use wasting our time
in proposing things that can't be accepted and are declined in
advance." and this duty that was incumbent upon odette, of going to the
hippodrome, to which swann thus gave way, seemed to him to be not merely
ineluctable in itself; but the mark of necessity which stamped it seemed
to make plausible and legitimate everything that was even remotely
connected with it. if, when odette, in the street, had acknowledged the
salute of a passer-by, which had aroused swann's jealousy, she replied
to his questions by associating the stranger with any of the two or
three paramount duties of which she had often spoken to hi

m; if, for
instance, she said: "that's a gentleman who was in my friend's box the
other day; the one i go to the hippodrome with," that explanation would
set swann's suspicions at rest; it was, after all, inevitable that
this friend should have other guests than odette in her box at the
hippodrome, but he had never sought to form or succeeded in forming any
coherent impression of them. oh! how he would have loved to know her,
that friend who went to the hippodrome, how he would have loved her to
invite him there with odette. how readily he would have sacrificed
all his acquaintance for no matter what person who was in the habit of
seeing odette, were she but a manicurist or a girl out of a shop. he
would have taken more trouble, incurred more expense for them

 than for
queens. would they not have supplied him, out of what was contained in
their knowledge of the life of odette, with the one potent anodyne for
his pain? with what joy would he have hastened to spend his days with
one or other of those humble folk with whom odette kept up friendly
relations, either with some ulterior motive or from genuine simplicity
of nature. how willingly would he have fixed his abode for ever in the
attics of some sordid but enviable house, where odette went but never
took him, and where, if he had lived with the little retired dressmaker,
whose lover he would readily have pretended to be, he would have been
visited by odette almost daily. in those regions, that were almost
slums, what a modest existence, abject, if you please, but delightful,
nourished by tranquillity and happiness, he would have consented to lead
indefinitely.

the days when, in spite of all that she had to do, and of her dread
of what people would think, she did actually manage to see swann, the
predominant quality in her attitude, now, was self-assurance; a striking
contrast, perhaps an unconscious revenge for, perhaps a natural reaction
from the timorous emotion which, in the early days of their friendship,

lover from a cuckold's), and would say:

"oh, i do wish i could change you; put some sense into that head of
yours."

always ready to believe in the truth of what he hoped, if it was only
odette's way of behaving to him that left room for doubt, he would fling
himself greedily upon her words: "you can if you like," he would tell
her.

and he tried to explain to her that to comfort him, to control him, to
make him work would be a noble task, to which numbers of other women
asked for nothing better than to be allowed to devote themselves, though
it is only fair to add that in those other women's hands the noble
task would have seemed to swann nothing more than an indiscreet and

which she would have liked to see. she felt that he wanted to hear her
say: "don't have him again when you come to me," just as he might have
wanted her to kiss him. so, being in a good temper, she said it; and he
was deeply moved. that evening, when talking to m. de charlus, with whom
he had the satisfaction of being able to speak of her openly (for the
most trivial remarks that he uttered now, even to people who had never
heard of her, had always some sort of reference to odette), he said to
him:

"i believe, all the same, that she loves me; she is so nice to me now,
and she certainly takes an interest in what i do."

and if, when he was starting off for her house, getting into his
carriage with a friend whom he was to drop somewhere on the way,
his friend said: "hullo! that isn't loredan on the box?" with what
melancholy joy would swann answer him:

"oh! good heavens, no! i can tell you, i daren't take loredan when i
go to the rue la pérouse; odette doesn't like me t

thinks he doesn't suit me. what on earth is one to do? women, you know,

these new manners, indifferent, listless, irritable, which odette now
adopted with swann, undoubtedly made him suffer; but he did not realise
how much he suffered; since it had been with a regular progression, day
after day, that odette had chilled towards him, it was only by directly
contrasting what she was to-day with what she had been at first that he
could have measured the extent of the change that had taken place. now
this change was his deep, his secret wound, which pained him day and
night, and whenever he felt that his thoughts were straying too near it,
he would quickly turn them into another channel for fear of being made
to suffer too keenly. he might say to himself in a vague way: "there

little less unhappy. but swann had thanked him with:

greatest pleasure that you can give me will be if you will go instead

soothed by the thought that m. de charlus would be spending the evening
in the rue la pérouse, but in a state of melancholy indifference to
everything that did not involve odette, and in particular to the details
of fashionable life, a state which invested them with the charm that is
to be found in anything which, being no longer an object of our desire,
appears to us in its own guise. on alighting from his carriage, in the
foreground of that fictitious summary of their domestic existence which
hostesses are pleased to offer to their guests on ceremonial occasions,
and in which they shew a great regard for accuracy of costume and
setting, swann was amused to discover th

hyacinths and a serpent's writhing back. others again, no less colossal,
were disposed upon the steps of a monumental staircase which, by their
decorative presence and marmorean immobility, was made worthy to be
named, like that god-crowned ascent in the palace of the doges, the
'staircase of the giants,' and on which swann now set foot, saddened by
the thought that odette had never climbed it. ah, with what joy would
he, on the other hand, have raced up the dark, evil-smelling, breakneck
flights to the little dressmaker's, in whose attic he would so gladly
have paid the price of a weekly stage-box at the opera for the right to
spend the evening there when odette came, and other days too, for the
privilege of talking about her, of living among people whom she was in
the habit of seeing when he was not there, and who, on that account,
seemed to keep secret among t

ith--an allegory of alarums,
incarnation of alertness, commemoration of a riot--to be looking out,
angel or sentinel, from the tower of dungeon or cathedral, for the
approach of the enemy or for the hour of judgment. swann had now only to
enter the concert-room, the doors of which were thrown open to him by an
usher loaded with chains, who bowed low before him as though tendering
to him the keys of a conquered city. but he thought of the house
in which at that very moment he might have been, if odette had but
permitted, and the remembered glimpse of an empty milk-can upon a
door-mat wrung his heart.

he speedily recovered his sense of the general ugliness of the human
male when, on the other side of the tapestry curtain, the spectacle of
the servants gave place to that of the guests. but even this ugliness of
faces, which of course were mostly familiar to him, seemed something new
and uncanny, now that their features,--instead of being to him symbols

"did you notice how dreadfully ill he's looking?" asked the general.

"my precious charles? ah, he's coming at last; i was beginning to think
he didn't want to see me!"

swann was extremely fond of the princesse des laumes, and the sight of
her recalled to him guermantes, a property close to combray, and all
that country which he so dearly loved and had ceased to visit, so as not
to be separated from odette. slipping into the manner, half-artistic,
half-amorous--with which he could always manage to amuse the princess--a
manner which came to him quite naturally whenever he dipped for a moment
into the old social atmosphere, and wishing also to express in words,
for his own satisfaction, the longing that he felt for the country:

"ah!" he exclaimed, or rather intoned, in such a way as to be audible at
once to mme. de saint-euverte, to whom he spoke, and to mme. des laumes,
for whom he was speaking,

same phrases, the same inflexions, that they
had the 'tone' of the guermantes set. on important matters, swann and
the princess had not an idea in common. but since swann had become so
melancholy, and was always in that trembling condition which precedes
a flood of tears, he had the same need to speak about his grief that
a murderer has to tell some one about his crime. and when he heard
the princess say that life was a dreadful business, he felt as much
comforted as if she had spoken to him of odette.

"yes, life is a dreadful business! we must meet more often, my dear
friend. what is so nice about you is that you are not cheerful. we could
spend a most pleasant evening together."

"i'm sure we could; why not come down to guermantes? my mother-in-law
would be wild with joy. it's supposed to be very ugly down there, but
i must say, i find the neighborhood not at all unattractive; i have a
horror of 'picturesque spots'."

"i know it well, it's delightful!" replied swann. "it's almost too

her.

"i say, swann, i'd rather be married to that little woman than killed by
savages, what do you say?"

the words 'killed by savages' pierced swann's aching heart; and at once
he felt the need of continuing the conversation. "ah!" he began, "some
fine lives have been lost in that way... there was, you remember, that
explorer whose remains dumont d'urville brought back, la pérouse..."
(and he was at once happy again, as though he had named odette). "he was
a fine character, and interests me very much, does la pérouse," he ended
sadly.

"oh, yes, of course, la pérouse," said the general. "it's quite a
well-known name. there's a street called that."

"do you know anyone in the rue la pérouse?" asked swann excitedly.

"only mme. de chanlivault, the sister of that good fellow chaussepierre.

since, being ignorant of his love, incapable,
had they known of it, of taking any interest, or of doing more than
smile at it as at some childish joke, or deplore it as an act of
insanity, they made it appear to him in the aspect of a subjective
state which existed for himself alone, whose reality there was nothing
external to confirm; he suffered overwhelmingly, to the point at which
even the sound of the instruments made him want to cry, from having to
prolong his exile in this place to which odette would never come, in
which no one, nothing was aware of her existence, from which she was
entirely absent.

but suddenly it was as though she had entered, and this apparition tore
him with such anguish that his hand rose impulsively to his heart. what
had happened was that the violin had risen to a series of high notes,
on which it rested as though expecting something, an expectancy which
it prolonged without ceasing to hold on to the notes, in the exaltation
with which it already saw the expec

desperate effort to continue until its arrival, to welcome it before
itself expired, to keep the way open for a moment longer, with all its
remaining strength, that the stranger might enter in, as one holds a
door open that would otherwise automatically close. and before swann had
had time to understand what was happening, to think: "it is the little
phrase from vinteuil's sonata. i mustn't listen!", all his memories of
the days when odette had been in love with him, which he had succeeded,
up till that evening, in keeping invisible in the depths of his being,
deceived by this sudden reflection of a season of love, whose sun, they
supposed, had dawned again, had awakened from their slumber, had taken
wing and risen to sing maddeningly in his ears, without pity for his
present desolation, the forgotten strains of happiness.

the network of mental habits, of seasonable impressions, of sensory
reactions, which had extended over a series of weeks its uniform meshes,
by which his body now found itself inextricably held. at that time he
had been satisfying a sensual curiosity to know what were the pleasures
of those people who lived for love alone. he had supposed that he could
stop there, that he would not be obliged to learn their sorrows also;
how small a thing the actual charm of odette was now in comparison with
that formidable terror which extended it like a cloudy halo all around
her, that enormous anguish of not knowing at every hour of the day and
night what she had been doing, of not possessing her wholly, at all
times and in all places! alas, he recalled the accents in which she had
exclaimed: "but i can see you at any time; i am always free!"--she, who
was never free now; the interest, the curiosity that she had shewn in
his life, her passionate desire that he should d

speak to him, had disguised herself in this sweeping cloak of sound. and
as she passed him, light, soothing, as softly murmured as the perfume
of a flower, telling him what she had to say, every word of which
he closely scanned, sorry to see them fly away so fast, he made
involuntarily with his lips the motion of kissing, as it went by him,
the harmonious, fleeting form.

he felt that he was no longer in exile and alone since she, who
addressed herself to him, spoke to him in a whisper of odette. for he
had no longer, as of old, the impression that odette and he were not
known to the little phrase. had it not often been the witness of their
joys? true that, as often, it had warned him of their frailty. and
indeed, whereas, in that distant time, he had divined an element of
suffering in its smile, in its limpid and disillusioned intonation,
to-night he found there rather the charm of a resignation that was
almost gay. of those sorrows, of which the little phrase had spoken

 he could not refrain from
smiling, and perhaps also found an underlying sense, which she was
incapable of perceiving, in the words that she used. dazzled by the
virtuosity of the performers, the comtesse exclaimed to swann: "it's
astonishing! i have never seen anything to beat it..." but a scrupulous
regard for accuracy making her correct her first assertion, she added
the reservation: "anything to beat it... since the table-turning!"

from that evening, swann understood that the feeling which odette had
once had for him would never revive, that his hopes of happiness would
not be realised now. and the days on which, by a lucky chance, she had
once more shewn herself kind and loving to him, or if she had paid him
any attention, he recorded those apparent and misleading signs of
a slight movement on her part towards him with the same tender and
sceptical solicitude, the desperate joy that people reveal who, when
they are nursing a friend in the last days of an incurable malady,

through his accounts himself, and actually corrected a mistake that we
had made in adding them up; he ate an egg to-day and seemed quite to
enjoy it, if he digests it properly we shall try him with a cutlet
to-morrow,"--although they themselves know that these things are
meaningless on the eve of an inevitable death. no doubt swann was
assured that if he had now been living at a distance from odette he
would gradually have lost all interest in her, so that he would have
been glad to learn that she was leaving paris for ever; he would have
had the courage to remain there; but he had not the courage to go.

he had often thought of going. now that he was once again at work upon
his essay on vermeer, he wanted to return, for a few days at least, to
the hague, to dresden, to brunswick. he was certain that a 'toilet of
diana' which had been acquired by the mauritshuis at the goldschmidt
sale as

a nicholas maes was in reality a vermeer. and he would have
liked to be able to examine the picture on the spot, so as to strengthen
his conviction. but to leave paris while odette was there, and even when
she was not there--for in strange places where our sensations have not
been numbed by habit, we refresh, we revive an old pain--was for him so
cruel a project that he felt himself to be capable of entertaining it
incessantly in his mind only because he knew himself to be resolute in
his determination never to put it into effect. but it would happen
that, while he was asleep, the intention to travel would reawaken in him
(without his remembering that this particular tour

 was impossible) and
would be realised. one night he dreamed that he was going away for a
year; leaning from the window of the train towards a young man on the
platform who wept as he bade him farewell, he was seeking to persuade
this young man to come away also. the train began to move; he awoke
in alarm, and remembered that he was not going away, that he would see
odette that evening, and next day and almost every day. and then, being
still deeply moved by his dream, he would thank heaven for those special
circumstances which made him independent, thanks to which he could
remain in odette's vicinity, and could even succeed in making her allow
him to see her sometimes; and, counting over the list of his advantages:
his social position--his fortune, from which she stood too often in
need of assistance not to shrink from the prospect of a definite rupture
(having

even, so people said, an ulterior plan of getting him to marry
her)--his friendship with m. de charlus, which, it must be confessed,
had never won him any very great favour from odette, but which gave him
the pleasant feeling that she was always hearing complimentary things
said about him by this common friend for whom she had so great an
esteem--and even his own intelligence, the whole of which he employed in
weaving, every day, a fresh plot which would make his presence, if not
agreeable, at any rate necessary to odette--he thought of what might
have happened to him if all these advantages had been lacking, he
thought that, if he had been, like so many other men, poor and h

without resources, forced to undertake any task that might be offered to
him, or tied down by parents or by a wife, he might have been obliged
to part from odette, that that dream, the terror of which was still so
recent, might well have been true; and he said to himself: "people don't
know when they are happy. they're never so unhappy as they think they
are." but he reflected that this existence had lasted already for
several years, that all that he could now hope for was that it should
last for ever, that he would sacrifice his work, his pleasures, his
friends, in fact the whole of his life to the daily expectation of a
meeting which, when it occurred,

 impunity, to its
career of mendacity, to the pursuit of pleasure. and swann felt a very
cordial sympathy with that mahomet ii whose portrait by bellini he
admired, who, on finding that he had fallen madly in love with one of
his wives, stabbed her, in order, as his venetian biographer artlessly
relates, to recover his spiritual freedom. then he would be ashamed
of thinking thus only of himself, and his own sufferings would seem to
deserve no pity now that he himself was disposing so cheaply of odette's
very life.

since he was unable to separate himself from her without a subsequent
return, if at least he had seen her continuously and without separations
his grief would ultimately have been assuaged, and his love would,
perhaps, have died. and from the moment when she did not wish to leave
paris for ever he had hoped that she would never go. as he knew that her
one prolonged absence, every year, was in august and september, he had
abundant opportunity, several months in advance, to dissocia

te from it
the grim picture of her absence throughout eternity which was lodged in
him by anticipation, and which, consisting of days closely akin to the
days through which he was then passing, floated in a cold transparency
in his mind, which it saddened and depressed, though without causing him
any intolerable pain. but that conception of the future, that flowing
stream, colourless and unconfined, a single word from odette sufficed
to penetrate through all swann's defences, and like a block of ice
immobilised it, congealed its fluidity, made it freeze altogether; and
swann felt himself suddenly filled with an enormous and unbreakable mass
which pressed on the inner walls of his consciousness until he was fain
to burst asunder; for odette had said casually, watching him with a
malicious smile: "forcheville is going for a fine trip at whitsuntide.
he's going to egypt!" and swann had at once understood that this mea

n began: "about that trip that you told me you
were going to take with forcheville," she would answer carelessly: "yes,
my dear boy, we're starting on the 19th; we'll send you a 'view' of the
pyramids." then he was determined to know whether she was forcheville's
mistress, to ask her point-blank, to insist upon her telling him. he
knew that there were some perjuries which, being so superstitious, she
would not commit, and besides, the fear, which had hitherto restrained
his curiosity, of making odette angry if he questioned her, of making
himself odious, had ceased to exist now that he had lost all hope of
ever being loved by her.

one day he received an anonymous letter which told him that odette had
been the mistress of countless men (several of whom it named, among
them forcheville, m. de bréauté and the painter) and women, and that she
frequented houses of ill-fame. he was tormented by the discovery that
there was to be numbered among his friends a creature capable of

he may have acted dishonourably once again." then he suspected rémi,
who, it was true, could only have inspired the letter, but he now felt
himself, for a moment, to be on the right track. to begin with, loredan
had his own reasons for wishing harm to odette. and then, how were we
not to suppose that our servants, living in a situation inferior to our
own, adding to our fortunes and to our frailties imaginary riches and
vices for which they at once envied and despised us, should not find
themselves led by fate to act in a manner abhorrent to people of our own
class? he also suspected my grandfather. on every occasion when swann
had asked him to do him any service, had he not invariably declined?

ble of shameful actions, at least that it was a necessity in human
life, to which everyone must submit, to frequent the society of people
who were, perhaps, not incapable of such actions. and he continued to
shake hands with all the friends whom he had suspected, with the purely
formal reservation that each one of them had, possibly, been seeking to
drive him to despair. as for the actual contents of the letter, they
did not disturb him; for in not one of the charges which it formulated
against odette could he see the least vestige of fact. like many other
men, swann had a naturally lazy mind, and was slow in invention. he knew
quite well as a general truth, that human life is full of contrasts, but
in the case of any one human being he imagined all that part of his or
her life with which he was not familiar as being identical with the
part with which he was. he imagined what was kept secret from him in the
light of what was revealed. at such times as he spent with odette,

ave been distressed, for such a portrait would have
struck him as lifelike. but to suppose that she went to bad houses,
that she abandoned herself to orgies with other women, that she led
the crapulous existence of the most abject, the most contemptible of
mortals--would be an insane wandering of the mind, for the realisation
of which, thank heaven, the chrysanthemums that he could imagine, the
daily cups of tea, the virtuous indignation left neither time nor
place. only, now and again, he gave odette to understand that people
maliciously kept him informed of everything that she did; and making
opportune use of some detail--insignificant but true--which he had
accidentally learned, as though it were the sole fragment which he would
allow, in spite of himself, to pass his lips, out of the numberless
other fragments of that complete reconstruction of her daily life which
he carried secretly in his mind, he led her to suppose that he was
perfectly informed upon matters, which, in reality, he ne

ither knew nor
suspected, for if he often adjured odette never to swerve from or make
alteration of the truth, that was only, whether he realised it or no, in
order that odette should tell him everything that she did. no doubt, as
he used to assure odette, he loved sincerity, but only as he might
love a pander who could keep him in touch with the daily life of his
mistress. moreover, his love of sincerity, not being disinterested, had
not improved his character. the truth which he cherished was that which
odette would tell him; but he himself, in order to extract that truth
from her, was not afraid to have recourse to falsehood, that very
falsehood which he never ceased to depict to odette as leading every
human creature down to utter degradatio

as did odette, because, while more unhappy than she, he was no less
egotistical. and she, when she heard him repeating thus to her the
things that she had done, would stare at him with a look of distrust
and, at all hazards, of indignation, so as not to appear to be
humiliated, and to be blushing for her actions. one day, after the
longest period of calm through which he had yet been able to exist
without being overtaken by an attack of jealousy, he had accepted an

t what was being
played, the sight of the title--_les filles de marbre_, by théodore
barrière,--struck him so cruel a blow that he recoiled instinctively
from it and turned his head away. illuminated, as though by a row of
footlights, in the new surroundings in which it now appeared, that word
'marble,' which he had lost the power to distinguish, so often had it
passed, in print, beneath his eyes, had suddenly become visible once
again, and had at once brought back to his mind the story which odette
had told him, long ago, of a visit which she had paid to the salon at
the palais d'industrie with mme. verdurin, who had said to her, "take
care, now! i know how to melt you, all right. you're not made of
marble." odette had assured him that it was only a joke, and he had
not attached any importance to it at the time. but he had had more
confidence in her then than he had now. and the anonymous letter
referred explicitly to relations of that sort. without daring to lift
his eyes to the newspape

e had been a storm in the channel,
and damage was reported from dieppe, cabourg, beuzeval.... suddenly he
recoiled again in horror.

the name of beuzeval had suggested to him that of another place in the
same district, beuzeville, which carried also, bound to it by a hyphen,
a second name, to wit bréauté, which he had often seen on maps, but
without ever previously remarking that it was the same name as that
borne by his friend m. de bréauté, whom the anonymous letter accused of
having been odette's lover. after all, when it came to m. de bréauté,
there was nothing improbable in the charge; but so far as mme. verdurin
was concerned, it was a sheer impossibility. from the fact that odette
did occasionally tell a lie, it was not fair to conclude that she never,
by any chance, told the truth, and in these bantering conversations
with mme. verdurin which she herself had repeated to swann, he could
recognize those meaningless and dangerous pleasantries which, in their
inexperience of life a

nd ignorance of vice, women often utter (thereby
certifying their own innocence), who--as, for instance, odette,--would
be the last people in the world to feel any undue affection for one

had scattered the suspicions which she had unintentionally brought into
being, for a moment, in his mind by her story, fitted in with everything
that he knew of the tastes, the temperament of his mistress. but at
that moment, by an inspiration of jealousy, analogous to the inspiration

an odd pair of rhymes or a detached observation, the idea or the natural
law which will give power, mastery to his work, swann recalled for the
first time a remark which odette had made to him, at least two years
before: "oh, mme. verdurin, she won't hear of anything just now but me.
i'm a 'love,' if you please, and she kisses me, and wants me to go with
her everywhere, and call her by her christian name." so far from seeing
in these expressions any connection with the absurd insinuations,
intended to create an atmosphere of vice, which odette had since
repeated to him, he had welcomed them as a proof of mme. verdurin's
warm-hearted and generous friendship. but now th

is old memory of her
affection for odette had coalesced suddenly with his more recent memory
of her unseemly conversation. he could no longer separate them in his
mind, and he saw them blended in reality, the affection imparting a
certain seriousness and importance to the pleasantries which, in return,
spoiled the affection of its innocence. he went to see odette. he sat
down, keeping at a distance from her. he did not dare to embrace her,
not knowing whether in her, in himself, it would be affection or anger
that a kiss would provoke. he sat there silent, watching their love
expire. suddenly he made up his mind.

"odette, my darling," he began, "i know, i am being simply odious, but i
must ask you a few questions. you remember what i once thought about you
and mme. verdurin? tell me, was it true? have you, with her or anyone
else, ever?"

ng, because it would
bore them to go, when some one has asked, "are you coming to watch the
procession go by?", or "will you be at the review?". but this shake of
the head, which is thus commonly used to decline participation in
an event that has yet to come, imparts for that reason an element of
uncertainty to the denial of participation in an event that is past.
furthermore, it suggests reasons of personal convenience, rather than
any definite repudiation, any moral impossibility. when he saw odette
thus make him a sign that the insinuation was false, he realised that it
was quite possibly true.

"i have told you, i never did; you know quite well," she added, seeming
angry and uncomfortable.

"yes, i know all that; but are you quite sure? don't say to me, 'you
know quite well'; say, 'i have never done anything of that sort with any
woman.'"

she repeated his words like a lesson learned by rote, and as though she
hoped, thereby, to be rid of him: "i have never done anything of that
sort wit

"can you swear it to me on your laghetto medal?"

swann knew that odette would never perjure herself on that.

"oh, you do make me so miserable," she cried, with a jerk of her body
as though to shake herself free of the constraint of his question. "have
you nearly done? what is the matter with you to-day? you seem to have
made up your mind that i am to be forced to hate you, to curse you!
look, i was anxious to be friends with you again, for us to have a nice
time together, like the old days; and this is all the thanks i get!"

for a spasm to subside that has interrupted his operation but need not

"you are quite wrong in supposing that i bear you the least ill-will in

"i never speak to you except of what i already know, and i always know a
great deal more than i say. but you alone can mollify by your confession
what makes me hate you so long as it has been reported to me only by
other people. my anger with you is never due to your actions--i can
and do forgive you everything because i love you--but to your
untruthfulness, the ridiculous untruthfulness which makes you persist in

shall be free of it for ever. tell me, upon your medal, yes or no,
whether you have ever done those things."

"how on earth can i tell?" she was furious. "perhaps i have, ever so
long ago, when i didn't know what i was doing, perhaps two or three
times."

swann had prepared himself for all possibilities. reality must,
therefore, be something which bears no relation to possibilities,

horror which had escaped with the words "perhaps two or three times,"

that he had known as a new malady by which one is attacked for the first
time. and yet this odette, from whom all this evil sprang, was no less
dear to him, was, on the contrary, more precious, as if, in proportion
as his sufferings increased, there increased at the same time the price
of the sedative, of the antidote which this woman alone possessed. he
wished to pay her more attention, as one attends to a disease which
one discovers, suddenly, to have grown more serious. he wished that
the horrible thing which, she had told him, she had done "two or three

does! but, swann asked himself, how could he manage to protect her? he
might perhaps be able to preserve her from the contamination of any
one woman, but there were hundreds of other women; and he realised how
insane had been his ambition when he had begun (on the evening when

was not satisfied that he had yet suffered enough, and sought to expose
his bosom to an even deeper wound. like an evil deity, his jealousy was
inspiring swann, was thrusting him on towards destruction. it was not
his fault, but odette's alone, if at first his punishment was not more
severe.

"my darling," he began again, "it's all over now; was it with anyone i
know?"

"no, i swear it wasn't; besides, i think i exaggerated, i never really
went as far as that."

he smiled, and resumed with: "just as you like. it doesn't really
matter, but it's unfortunate that you can't give me any name. if i were
able to form an idea of the person that would prevent my ever thinking
of her again. i say it for your own sake, because then i sh

 it a thought. anyone would say that you were
positively trying to put those ideas into my head again. and then you'd
be a lot better off!" she concluded, with unconscious stupidity but with
intentional malice.

"i only wished to know whether it had been since i knew you. it's only
natural. did it happen here, ever? you can't give me any particular
evening, so that i can remind myself what i was doing at the time? you
understand, surely, that it's not possible that you don't remember with
whom, odette, my love."

"but i don't know; really, i don't. i think it was in the bois, one
evening when you came to meet us on the island. you had been dining with
the princesse des laumes," she added, happy to be able to furnish him
with an exact detail, which testified to her veracity. "at the next
table there was a woman whom i hadn't seen for ever so long. she said to
me, 'come along round behind the rock, there, and look at the moonlight
on the water!' at first i just yawned, and said, 'no, i'm too t

ired,
and i'm quite happy where i am, thank you.' she swore there'd never been
anything like it in the way of moonlight. 'i've heard that tale before,'
i said to her; you see, i knew quite well what she was after." odette
narrated this episode almost as if it were a joke, either because it
appeared to her to be quite natural, or because she thought that she was
thereby minimising its importance, or else so as not to appear ashamed.
but, catching sight of swann's face, she changed her tone, and:

"you are a fiend!" she flung at him, "you enjoy tormenting me, making me
tell you lies, just so that you'll leave me in peace."

this second blow struck at swann was even more excruciating than the
first. never had he su

pposed it to have been so recent an affair, hidden
from his eyes that had been too innocent to discern it, not in a past
which he had never known, but in evenings which he so well remembered,
which he had lived through with odette, of which he had supposed himself
to have such an intimate, such an exhaustive knowledge, and which now
assumed, retrospectively, an aspect of cunning and deceit and cruelty.
in the midst of them parted, suddenly, a gaping chasm, that moment on
the island in the bois de boulogne. without being intelligent, odette
had the charm of being natural. she had recounted, she had acted the
little scene with so much simplicity that swann, as he gasped for
breath, could vividly see it: odette yawning, the

ng, every minute, to make the
movement that, he knows, will hurt him, he kept on murmuring to himself:
"i'm quite happy where i am, thank you," "i've heard that tale before,"
but the pain was so intense that he was obliged to stop. he was amazed
to find that actions which he had always, hitherto, judged so lightly,
had dismissed, indeed, with a laugh, should have become as serious to
him as a disease which might easily prove fatal. he knew any number
of women whom he could ask to keep an eye on odette, but how was he to
expect them to adjust themselves to his new point of view, and not to
remain at that which for so long had been his own, which had always
guided him in his voluptuous existence; not to say to him with a smile:
"you jealous monster, wanting to rob other people of their pleasure!"
by what trap-door, suddenly lowered, had he (who had never found, in the
old days, in his love for odette, any but the most refined of pleasures)
been precipitated into this new circle of hell from wh

ich he could not
see how he was ever to escape. poor odette! he wished her no harm. she
was but half to blame. had he not been told that it was her own mother
who had sold her, when she was still little more than a child, at nice,
to a wealthy englishman? but what an agonising truth was now contained
for him in those lines of alfred de vigny's _journal d'un poète_ which
he had previously read without emotion: "when one feels oneself smitten
by love for a woman, one ought to say to oneself, 'what are 'her
surroundings? what has been her life?' all one's
 
 ___________________________
 
 future happiness lies
in the answer." swann was astonished that such simple phrases, spelt
over in his mind as, "i've heard that tale before," or "i knew quite
well what she was after," could cause him so much pain. but he realised
that what he had mistaken for simple phrases were indeed parts of the
panoply which held and could inflict on him the anguish that he had felt
while odette was telling her story. for it was the same anguish that he
now was feeling afresh. it was no good, his knowing now,--indeed, it
was no good, as time went on, his having partly forgotten and altogether
forgiven the offence--whenever he repeated her words his old anguish
refashioned him as he had been before odette began to speak: ignorant,
trustful; his merciless jealousy placed him once again, so that he might
be effectively wounded by odette's admission, in the position of a man
who does not y

et know the truth; and after several months this old story
would still dumbfounder him, like a sudden revelation. he marvelled
at the terrible recreative power of his memory. it was only by the
weakening of that generative force, whose fecundity diminishes as age
creeps over one, that he could hope for a relaxation of his torments.
but, as soon as the power that any one of odette's sentences had to make
swann suffer seemed to be nearly exhausted, lo and behold another, one
of those to which he had hitherto paid least attention, almost a
new sentence, came to relieve the first, and to strike at him with
undiminished force. the memory of the evening on which he had dined with
the princesse des laumes was painful to him, but it was no more than
the centre, the core of his pain. that radiated vaguely round about it,
overflowing into all the preceding and following days. and
 
 ___________________________
 
 on whatever
point in it he might intend his memory to rest, it was the whole of that
season, during which the verdurins had so often gone to dine upon the
island in the bois, that sprang back to hurt him. so violently, that by
slow degrees the curiosity which his jealousy was ever exciting in him
was neutralised by his fear of the fresh tortures which he would be
inflicting upon himself were he to satisfy it. he recognised that all
the period of odette's life which had elapsed before she first met him,
a period of which he had never sought to form any picture in his mind,
was not the featureless abstraction which he could vaguely see, but had
consisted of so many definite, dated years, each crowded with concrete
incidents. but were he to learn more of them, he feared lest her past,
now colourless, fluid and supportable, might assume a tangible, an
obscene form, with individual and diabolical features. and he continued
to refrain from seeking 
 
 ___________________________
 
a conception of it, not any longer now from
laziness of mind, but from fear of suffering. he hoped that, some day,
he might be able to hear the island in the bois, or the princesse des
laumes mentioned without feeling any twinge of that old rending pain;
meanwhile he thought it imprudent to provoke odette into furnishing him
with fresh sentences, with the names of more places and people and of
different events, which, when his malady was still scarcely healed,
would make it break out again in another form.

but, often enough, the things that he did not know, that he dreaded,
now, to learn, it was odette herself who, spontaneously and without
thought of what she did, revealed them to him; for the gap which her
vices made between her actual life and the comparatively innocent life
which swann had 
 
 ___________________________
 
believed, and often still believed his mistress to lead,
was far wider than she knew. a vicious person, always affecting the same
air of virtue before people whom he is anxious to keep from having any
suspicion of his vices, has no register, no gauge at hand from which
he may ascertain how far those vices (their continuous growth being
imperceptible by himself) have gradually segregated him from the normal
ways of life. in the course of their cohabitation, in odette's mind,
with the memory of those of her actions which she concealed from swann,
her other, her innocuous actions were gradually coloured, infected
by these, without her being able to detect anything strange in them,
without their causing any explosion in the particular region of herself
in which she made them live, but when she related them to swann, he was
overwhelmed by the revelation of the duplicity to which they pointed.
one day, he was trying--without hurting odette--to discover from her

whether she had ever had any dealings with procuresses. he was, as a
matter of fact, convinced that she had not; the anonymous letter had
put the idea into his mind, but in a purely mechanical way; it had been
received there with no credulity, but it had, for all that, remained
there, and swann, wishing to be rid of the burden--a dead weight, but
none the less disturbing--of this suspicion, hoped that odette would now
extirpate it for ever.

"oh dear, no! not that they don't simply persecute me to go to them,"
her smile revealed a gratified vanity which she no longer saw that it
was impossible should appear legitimate to swann. "there was one of them
waited more than two hours for me yesterday, said she would give me any
money i asked. it seems, there's an ambassador who said to her, 'i'll
kill myself if you don't bring her to me'--meaning me! they told her i'd
gone out, but she waited and waited,

that i don't want to! the idea of such a thing, i don't like it at all!

has orders not to let her in again; he will tell her that i am out of

while i was talking to her. i know, you'd have been pleased, my dear.
there's some good in your little odette, you see, after all, though
people do say such dreadful things about her."

besides, her very admissions--when she made any--of faults which she
supposed him to have discovered, rather served swann as a starting-point
for fresh doubts than they put an end to the old. for her admissions
never exactly coincided with his doubts. in vain might odette expurgate
her confession of all its essential part, there would remain in the
accessories something which swann had never yet imagined, which crushed

lf too, probably, many times when she had glibly
uttered such words as explain a delay or justify an alteration of the
hour fixed for a meeting, those moments must have hidden, without his
having the least inkling of it at the time, an engagement that she had
had with some other man, some man to whom she had said: "i need only
tell swann that my dress wasn't ready, or that my cab came late. there
is always some excuse." and beneath all his most pleasant memories,
beneath the simplest words that odette had ever spoken to him in those
old days, words which he had believed as though they were the words of
a gospel, beneath her daily actions which she had recounted to him,
beneath the most ordinary places, her dressmaker's flat, the avenue du
bois, the hippodrome, he could feel (dissembled there, by virtue of that
temporal superfluity which, after the most detailed account of how a day
has been spent, always leaves something over, that may serve as a hiding
place for certain unconfessed actions)

, he could feel the insinuation of
a possible undercurrent of falsehood which debased for him all that
had remained most precious, his happiest evenings, the rue la pérouse
itself, which odette must constantly have been leaving at other hours
than those of which she told him; extending the power of the dark horror
that had gripped him when he had heard her admission with regard to
the maison dorée, and, like the obscene creatures in the 'desolation of
nineveh,' shattering, stone by stone, the whole edifice of his past....
if, now, he turned aside whenever his memory repeated the cruel name of
the maison dorée it was because that name recalled to him, no longer,

for what we suppose to be our love, our jealousy are, neither of them,
single, continuous and individual passions. they are composed of an
infinity of successive loves, of different jealousies, each of which is
ephemeral, although by their uninterrupted multitude they give us the
impression of continuity, the illusion of unity. the life of swann's
love, the fidelity of his jealousy, were formed out of death, of
infidelity, of innumerable desires, innumerable doubts, all of which
had odette for their object. if he had remained for any length of time
without seeing her, those that died would not have been replaced by
others. but the presence of odette continued to sow in swann's heart
alternate seeds of love and suspicion.

on certain evenings she would suddenly resume towards him a kindness of
which she would warn him sternly that he must take immediate advantage,
under penalty of not seeing it repeated for years to come; he must
instantly accompany her home, to "do a cattleya," a

rose, searched everywhere and found nobody, but he had not the courage
to return to his place by her side; whereupon she, in a towering
rage, broke a vase, with "i never can do anything right with you,
you impossible person!" and he was left uncertain whether she had not
actually had some man concealed in the room, whose jealousy she had
wished to wound, or else to inflame his senses.

sometimes he repaired to 'gay' houses, hoping to learn something about
odette, although he dared not mention her name. "i have a little thing
here, you're sure to like," the 'manageress' would greet him, and he
would stay for an hour or so, talking dolefully to some poor girl who
sat there astonished that he went no further. one of them, who was still
quite young and attractive, said to him once, "of course, what i should
like would be to find a real friend, then he might be quite certain,
i should never go with any other men again." "indeed, do you think it

that, nowadays, all the society ladies are like that; a perfect scandal,
i call it. but i'll leave you in peace now, i know when i'm not wanted,"
she ended discreetly, and left swann with the girl who had the blue
eyes. but presently he rose and said good-bye to her. she had ceased to
interest him. she did not know odette.

the painter having been ill, dr. cottard recommended a sea-voyage;
several of the 'faithful' spoke of accompanying him; the verdurins could
not face the prospect of being left alone in paris, so first of all
hired, and finally purchased a yacht; thus odette was constantly going
on a cruise. whenever she had been away for any length of time, swann
would feel that he was beginning to detach himself from her, but, as
though this moral distance were proportionate to the physical distance

them, whenever he heard that odette had returned to paris, he
could not rest without seeing her. once, when they had gone away, as
everyone thought, for a month only, either they succumbed to a series
of temptations, or else m. verdurin had cunningly arranged everything
beforehand, to please his wife, and disclosed his plans to the
'faithful' only as time went on; anyhow, from algiers they flitted to

rue bonaparte, where the conductor was to set her down, listened to the
promptings of her heart, which counselled other words than these.

"your ears must have been burning," she ventured, "while we were on the
yacht with mme. verdurin. we were talking about you all the time."

swann was genuinely astonished, for he supposed that his name was never
uttered in the verdurins' presence.

"you see," mme. cottard went on, "mme. de crécy was there; need i say
more? when odette is anywhere it's never long before she begins talking
about you. and you know quite well, it isn't nasty things she says.
what! you don't believe me!" she went on, noticing that svrann looked
sceptical. and, carried away by the sincerity of her conviction, without
putting any evil meaning into the word, which she used purely in the
sense in which one employs it to speak of the affection that unites a
pair of friends: "why, she _adores_ you! no, indeed; i'm sure it would

he be doing just now? i do hope, he's doing a little work! it's too
dreadful that a fellow with such gifts as he has should be so lazy.'
(forgive me, won't you.) 'i can see him this very moment; he's thinking
of us, he's wondering where we are.' indeed, she used an expression
which i thought very pretty at the time. m. verdurin asked her, 'how in
the world can you see what he's doing, when he's a thousand miles away?'
and odette answered, 'nothing is impossible to the eye of a friend.'

"no, i assure you, i'm not saying it just to flatter you; you have a
true friend in her, such as one doesn't often find. i can tell you,
besides, in case you don't know it, that you're the only one. mme.
verdurin told me as much herself on our last day with them (one talks
more freely, don't you know, before a parting), 'i don't say that odette
isn't fond of us, but anything that we may say to her counts for very

and mme. cottard withdrew from her muff, to offer it to swann, a
white-gloved hand from which there floated, with a transier-ticket, an
atmosphere of fashionable life that pervaded the omnibus, blended with
the harsher fragrance of newly cleaned kid. and swann felt himself
overflowing with gratitude to her, as well as to mme. verdurin (and
almost to odette, for the feeling that he now entertained for her was
no longer tinged with pain, was scarcely even to be described, now,
as love), while from the platform of the omnibus he followed her with
loving eyes, as she gallantly threaded her way along the rue bonaparte,
her plume erect, her skirt held up in one hand, while in the other she
clasped her umbrella and her card-case, so that its monogram could be
seen, her muff dancing in the air before her as she went.

the moribund feelings that swann had
for odette, mme. cottard, a wiser physician, in this case, than ever
her husband would have been, had grafted among them others more normal,
feelings of gratitude, of friendship, which in swann's mind were to make
odette seem again more human (more like other women, since other women
could inspire the same feelings in him), were to hasten her final
transformation back into that odette, loved with an undisturbed
affection, who had taken him home one evening after a revel at the
painter's, to drink orangeade with forcheville, that odette with whom
swann had calculated that he might live in happiness.

in former times, having often thought with terror that a day must come
when he would cease to be in love with odette, he had determined to
keep a sharp look-out, and as soon as he felt that love was beginning to
escape him, to cling tightly to it and to hold it back. but now, to

self which he has ceased to be. occasionally the name, if it caught
his eye in a newspaper, of one of the men whom he supposed to have been
odette's lovers, reawakened his jealousy. but it was very slight, and,
inasmuch as it proved to him that he had not completely emerged from
that period in which he had so keenly suffered--though in it he had also
known a way of feeling so intensely happy--and that the accidents of his
course might still enable him to catch an occasional glimpse, stealthily
and at a distance, of its beauties, this jealousy gave him, if anything,

away from him without looking out to bid it a last farewell. indeed,
like the same traveller, if he does not awake until he has crossed the
frontier and is again in france, when swann happened to alight, close
at hand, upon something which proved that forcheville had been odette's
lover, he discovered that it caused him no pain, that love was now
utterly remote, and he regretted that he had had no warning of the
moment in which he had emerged from it for ever. and just as, before
kissing odette for the first time, he had sought to imprint upon his
memory the face that for so long had been familiar, before it was
altered by the additional memory of their kiss, so he could have

jealousy, to that odette who had caused him so to suffer, and whom now
he would never see again. he was mistaken. he was destined to see
her once again, a few weeks later. it was while he was asleep, in the
twilight of a dream. he was walking with mme. verdurin, dr. cottard,
a young man in a fez whom he failed to identify, the painter, odette,
napoleon iii and my grandfather, along a path which followed the line
of the coast, and overhung the sea, now at a great height, now by a few
feet only, so that they were continually going up and down; those of the
party who had reached the downward slope were no longer visible to those
who were still climbing; what little daylight yet remained was failing,
and it seemed as though a black night was immediately to fall on them.
now and then the waves dashed against the cliff, and swann could fe

his cheek a shower of freezing spray. odette told him to wipe this off,
but he could not, and felt confused and helpless in her company, as well
as because he was in his nightshirt. he hoped that, in the darkness,
this might pass unnoticed; mme. verdurin, however, fixed her astonished
gaze upon him for an endless moment, in which he saw her face change
its shape, her nose grow longer, while beneath it there sprouted a heavy
moustache. he turned away to examine odette; her cheeks were pale, with
little fiery spots, her features drawn and ringed with shadows; but she
looked back at him with eyes welling with affection, ready to detach
themselves like tears and to fall upon his face, and he felt that he
loved her so much that he would have liked to carry her off with him
at once. suddenly odette turned her wrist, glanced at a tiny watch,
and said: "i must go." she took leave of everyone, in the same formal
manner, without taking swann aside, without telling hi

to meet that evening, or next day. he dared not ask, he would have liked
to follow her, he was obliged, without turning back in her direction,
to answer with a smile some question by mme. verdurin; but his heart was
frantically beating, he felt that he now hated odette, he would gladly
have crushed those eyes which, a moment ago, he had loved so dearly,
have torn the blood into those lifeless cheeks. he continued to climb
with mme. verdurin, that is to say that each step took him farther from
odette, who was going downhill, and in the other direction. a second
passed and it was many hours since she had left him. the painter
remarked to swann that napoleon iii had eclipsed himself immediately
after odette. "they had obviously arranged it between them," he adde

startle him awake. in an instant night grew black about him; an alarum
rang, the inhabitants ran past him, escaping from their blazing houses;
he could hear the thunder of the surging waves, and also of his own
heart, which, with equal violence, was anxiously beating in his breast.
suddenly the speed of these palpitations redoubled, he felt a pain, a
nausea that were inexplicable; a peasant, dreadfully burned, flung at
him as he passed: "come and ask charlus where odette spent the night
with her friend. he used to go about with her, and she tells him
everything. it was they that started the fire." it was his valet, come
to awaken him, and saying:--

"sir, it is eight o'clock, and the barber is here. i have told him to
call again in an hour."

but these words, as they dived down through the waves of sleep in which
swann was submerged, did not reach his consciousness without undergoing
that refraction which turns a ray of light, at the bottom of a bowl of

an indication, a warning, a presage. it was in this fashion that swann
had often carried back his mind to the image of odette, encountered in
the theatre, on that first evening when he had no thought of ever
seeing her again--and that he now recalled the party at mme. de

mme. de cambremer. so manifold are our interests in life that it is

but while, an hour after his awakening, he was giving instructions
to the barber, so that his stiffly brushed hair should not become
disarranged on the journey, he thought once again of his dream; he
saw once again, as he had felt them close beside him, odette's pallid
complexion, her too thin cheeks, her drawn features, her tired eyes, all
the things which--in the course of those successive bursts of affection
which had made of his enduring love for odette a long oblivion of the
first impression that he had formed of her--he had ceased to observe
after the first few days of their intimacy, days to which, doubtless,
while he slept, his memory had returned to seek the exact sensation of
those things. and with that old, intermittent fatuity, which reap
