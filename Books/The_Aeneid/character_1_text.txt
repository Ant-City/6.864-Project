  full in the center of the town there stood,
  thick set with trees, a venerable wood.
  the tyrians, landing near this holy ground,
  and digging here, a prosp'rous omen found:
  from under earth a courser's head they drew,
  their growth and future fortune to foreshew.
  this fated sign their foundress juno gave,
  of a soil fruitful, and a people brave.
  sidonian dido here with solemn state
  did juno's temple build, and consecrate,
  enrich'd with gifts, and with a golden shrine;
  but more the goddess made the place divine.
  on brazen steps the marble threshold rose,
  and brazen plates the cedar beams inclose:
  the rafters are with brazen cov'rings crown'd;
  the lofty doors on brazen hinges sound.
  what first aeneas this place beheld,
  reviv'd his courage, and his fear expell'd.

  penthisilea there, with haughty grace,
  leads to the wars an amazonian race:
  in their right hands a pointed dart they wield;
  the left, for ward, sustains the lunar shield.
  athwart her breast a golden belt she throws,
  amidst the press alone provokes a thousand foes,
  and dares her maiden arms to manly force oppose.

  thus while the trojan prince employs his eyes,
  fix'd on the walls with wonder and surprise,
  the beauteous dido, with a num'rous train
  and pomp of guards, ascends the sacred fane.
  such on eurotas' banks, or cynthus' height,
  diana seems; and so she charms the sight,
  when in the dance the graceful goddess leads
  the choir of nymphs, and overtops their heads:
  known by her quiver, and her lofty mien,
  she walks majestic, and she looks their queen;
  latona sees her shine above the rest,
  and feeds with secret joy her silent breast.

  these thoughts by night her golden slumbers broke,
  and thus alarm'd, to winged love she spoke:
  "my son, my strength, whose mighty pow'r alone
  controls the thund'rer on his awful throne,
  to thee thy much-afflicted mother flies,
  and on thy succor and thy faith relies.
  thou know'st, my son, how jove's revengeful wife,
  by force and fraud, attempts thy brother's life;
  and often hast thou mourn'd with me his pains.
  him dido now with blandishment detains;
  but i suspect the town where juno reigns.
  for this 't is needful to prevent her art,
  and fire with love the proud phoenician's heart:
  a love so violent, so strong, so sure,
  as neither age can change, nor art can cure.
  how this may be perform'd, now take my mind:
  ascanius by his father is design'd
  to come, with presents laden, from the port,
  to gratify the queen, and gain the court.
  i mean to plunge the boy in pleasing sleep,
  and, ravish'd, in

  nor pass unprais'd the vest and veil divine,
  which wand'ring foliage and rich flow'rs entwine.
  but, far above the rest, the royal dame,
  (already doom'd to love's disastrous flame,)
  with eyes insatiate, and tumultuous joy,
  beholds the presents, and admires the boy.
  the guileful god about the hero long,
  with children's play, and false embraces, hung;
  then sought the queen: she took him to her arms
  with greedy pleasure, and devour'd his charms.
  unhappy dido little thought what guest,
  how dire a god, she drew so near her breast;
  but he, not mindless of his mother's pray'r,
  works in the pliant bosom of the fair,
  and molds her heart anew, and blots her former care.
  the dead is to the living love resign'd;
  and all aeneas enters in her mind.

  now, when the rage of hunger was appeas'd,
  the meat remov'd, and ev'ry guest was pleas'd,
  the golden bowls with sparkling wine are crown'd,
  and thro' the palace cheerful cries resound.

  and pours the ruddy wine betwixt her horns;
  and, while the priests with pray'r the gods invoke,
  she feeds their altars with sabaean smoke,
  with hourly care the sacrifice renews,
  and anxiously the panting entrails views.
  what priestly rites, alas! what pious art,
  what vows avail to cure a bleeding heart!
  a gentle fire she feeds within her veins,
  where the soft god secure in silence reigns.

  sick with desire, and seeking him she loves,
  from street to street the raving dido roves.
  so when the watchful shepherd, from the blind,
  wounds with a random shaft the careless hind,
  distracted with her pain she flies the woods,
  bounds o'er the lawn, and seeks the silent floods,
  with fruitless care; for still the fatal dart
  sticks in her side, and rankles in her heart.
  and now she leads the trojan chief along
  the lofty walls, amidst the busy throng;
  displays her tyrian wealth, and rising town,
  which love, without his labor, makes his own.
  this pomp she s

 her absent hero sees and hears;
  or in her bosom young ascanius bears,
  and seeks the father's image in the child,
  if love by likeness might be so beguil'd.

  meantime the rising tow'rs are at a stand;
  no labors exercise the youthful band,
  nor use of arts, nor toils of arms they know;
  the mole is left unfinish'd to the foe;
  the mounds, the works, the walls, neglected lie,
  short of their promis'd heighth, that seem'd to threat the sky,

  but when imperial juno, from above,
  saw dido fetter'd in the chains of love,
  hot with the venom which her veins inflam'd,
  and by no sense of shame to be reclaim'd,
  with soothing words to venus she begun:
  "high praises, endless honors, you have won,
  and mighty trophies, with your worthy son!
  two gods a silly woman have undone!
  nor am i ignorant, you both suspect

  but shall celestial discord never cease?

  then venus, who her hidden fraud descried,
  which would the scepter of the world misguide
  to libyan shores, thus artfully replied:
  "who, but a fool, would wars with juno choose,

  if fortune with our joint desires comply?

  she fills the peaceful universe with cries;
  no slumbers ever close her wakeful eyes;
  by day, from lofty tow'rs her head she shews,
  and spreads thro' trembling crowds disastrous news;
  with court informers haunts, and royal spies;
  things done relates, not done she feigns, and mingles truth with lies.

  talk is her business, and her chief delight
  to tell of prodigies and cause affright.
  she fills the people's ears with dido's name,
  who, lost to honor and the sense of shame,
  admits into her throne and nuptial bed
  a wand'ring guest, who from his country fled:
  whole days with him she passes in delights,
  and wastes in luxury long winter nights,
  forgetful of her fame and royal trust,
  dissolv'd in ease, abandon'd to her lust.

  the goddess widely spreads the loud report,
  and flies at length to king hyarba's court.

  like these, the steerage of his wings he plies,
  and near the surface of the water flies,
  till, having pass'd the seas, and cross'd the sands,
  he clos'd his wings, and stoop'd on libyan lands:
  where shepherds once were hous'd in homely sheds,
  now tow'rs within the clouds advance their heads.
  arriving there, he found the trojan prince
  new ramparts raising for the town's defense.
  a purple scarf, with gold embroider'd o'er,

  a sword, with glitt'ring gems diversified,

  then thus, with winged words, the god began,
  resuming his own shape: "degenerate man,
  thou woman's property, what mak'st thou here,
  these foreign walls and tyrian tow'rs to rear,
  forgetful of thy own? all-pow'rful jove,

  scarce bear the weighty burthen on their backs:
  some set their shoulders to the pond'rous grain;
  some guard the spoil; some lash the lagging train;
  all ply their sev'ral tasks, and equal toil sustain.

  what pangs the tender breast of dido tore,
  when, from the tow'r, she saw the cover'd shore,
  and heard the shouts of sailors from afar,
  mix'd with the murmurs of the wat'ry war!

  despair, and rage, and love divide her heart;
  despair and rage had some, but love the greater part.

  then thus she said within her secret mind:
  "what shall i do? what succor can i find?

  with livid spots distinguish'd was her face;
  red were her rolling eyes, and discompos'd her pace;
  ghastly she gaz'd, with pain she drew her breath,
  and nature shiver'd at approaching death.

  then swiftly to the fatal place she pass'd,
  and mounts the fun'ral pile with furious haste;
  unsheathes the sword the trojan left behind
  (not for so dire an enterprise design'd).

  this said, she mounts the pile with eager haste,
  and in her arms the gasping queen embrac'd;
  her temples chaf'd; and her own garments tore,
  to stanch the streaming blood, and cleanse the gore.
  thrice dido tried to raise her drooping head,
  and, fainting thrice, fell grov'ling on the bed;
  thrice op'd her heavy eyes, and sought the light,
  but, having found it, sicken'd at the sight,
  and clos'd her lids at last in endless night.

  then juno, grieving that she should sustain
  a death so ling'ring, and so full of pain,
