                	the
unnamed [CHARACTER] works as the surveyor of the salem custom-house
some two hundred years after the novel's events take place. he discovers
an old manuscript in the building's attic that tells the story of hester
prynne; when he loses his job, he decides to write a fictional treatment
of the narrative. the [CHARACTER] is a rather high-strung man, whose
puritan ancestry makes him feel guilty about his writing career. he
writes because he is interested in american history and because
he believes that america needs to better understand its religious
and moral heritage.
