d walked slowly towards her. the hair raised on his neck, but then
he walked to where she stood and let her touch him.
the girl looked at me and made a motion with her hands which i took to mean that rontu was hers.
'no,' i cried and shook my head.
i picked up my spear.
she started to nun and i thought that she was going to flee back through the brush. she made another motion which i took to
mean that rontu was now mine. i did not believe her. i held the spear over my shoulder, ready to throw.
'tutok,' she said, pointing to herself.
i did not say my name. i called rontu and he came back.
the girl looked at him and then at me and smiled.
she was older than i, but not so tall. she had a broad face and small eyes that were very black.
when she smiled, i saw that her teeth were worn down from chewing seal sinew, but they were very white.
i was still holding the cormorant skirt and the girl pointed to it and said something. there was one word - wintscha - which
sounded like a word that means pre

wo loops around my neck, but i did not leave the ledge.
i stayed there all the morning. the sun was high when rontu barked and i heard steps below me. the girl came out of the
brush singing. she walked to the cave, but when she saw the necklace lying on the rock she grew quiet. she picked up the
necklace and put it down again and peered into the mouth of the cave. two of my baskets were still there. then she went and
drank from the spring and started off through the brush.
i jumped to my feet. 'tutok,' i cried, running down the ravine. 'tutok.'
she came out of the brush so quickly that she must have been waiting near by to see if i would return.
i ran to the rock and put on the necklace and turned around for her to admire it. the beads made not two loops but three. they
were long and oval instead of round, which is a very hard shape to make and takes much skill.
'wintscha,' she said. 
' wintscha,' i said, after her, the word strange on my tongue. then i said the word that meant pretty in ou

r language.
'win-tai,' she said and laughed, because this was strange to her.
she touched the necklace, giving the word for it, and j gave mine. we pointed out other things - the spring, the cave, a gull
dying, the sun and the sky, rontu asleep - trading the names for them and laughing because they were so different. we sat
there on the rock until the sun was in the west and played this game. then tutok rose and made a gesture of farewell.
mah-nay,' she said and waited to hear my name. 'won-a-pa-lei,' i answered, which as i have said, means the girl with the
long black hair. i did not tell her my secret name.
'mah-nay, won-a-pa-lei,' she said.
'pah-say-no, tutok,' i replied.
i watched her go through the brush. i stood for a long time listening to her footsteps, until i could hear them no more, and
then i went to the headland and brought the baskets back to the cave.
tutok came again the next d

in the back.
â€˜wintscha,' she said and hugged me. she was so pleased that i forgot how sore my fingers were from boring the holes in the
hard shells.
many times she came to the cave, and then one morning she did not come. i waited for her all that day and at dusk j left the
cave and went to the ledge where i could watch the ravine, fearing that the men had learned that i lived here and would find
me. that night i slept on the ledge. the night was cold with the first wind of winter.
tutok did not return the nest day and i remembered that it was near the time when the aleut hunters would leave. perhaps
they had already gone. that afternoon i went to the headland. i climbed the rock and crawled across it until i could look over
the rim. my heart beat loud.
the aleut ship was still there, but men were working on the deck and canoes were going back and forth. the wind blew hard
and few bales of otter skins lay on the shore so probably the ship would leave at dawn.
it was dark when i

 got back to the ravine. since the wind was very cold and i was no longer afraid that the aleuts would find
me, i made a fire in the cave and cooked a supper of shellfish and roots. i cooked enough for rontu and me and for tutok. i
knew tutok would not come, yet i put her food beside the fire and waited.
once rontu barked and i thought i heard the sound of footsteps and went to the opening and listened. i waited a long while
and did not eat. clouds moved from the north, covering the cold sky. the wind grew louder and made wild noises in the
ravine. at last i closed the mouth of the cave with stones.
at dawn i went to the headland. the wind had died. fog lay over the sea, washing against the island in grey waves. i waited a
long time

 for a glimpse of coral cove, but finally the sun burned away the fog. the little harbour was deserted. the aleut 
ship with its red-beaked prow and red sails had gone. at first, knowing that i could now leave the cave and move back into
my house on the headland, i was happy. but as i stood there on the high rock looking down at the deserted harbour and the
empty sea, i began to think of tutok. i thought of all the times we had sat in the sun together. i could hear her voice and see
her black eyes squinting closed when she laughed.
below me, rontu was running along the cliff, barking at the screaming gulls. pelicans were chattering as they fished the blue
water. far off i could hear the bellow of a sea elephant. but suddenly, as i thought of tutok, the island seemed very quiet.

the hunters left many wounded otter behind them. some floated in and died on the shore and others i kill

en i could not. through
the first part of the winter, before mon-a- nee swam away, this was sometimes hard to do. afterwards it was not so hard and
rontu and i always had enough to eat.
while the aleuts were on the island, i had no chance to catch little smelts and dry them, so the nights that winter were dark
and i went to bed early and worked only during the day. but still i made another string for my fishing spear, many hooks of 
abalone shell, and last of all ear-rings to match the necklace tutok had given me.
these took a long time, for i searched the beach many mornings when the tide was out before i found two pebbles of the
same colour as the stones in the necklace and soft enough to cut. the holes in the ear-rings took even more time, for the
stones were hard to hold, but when i was done and had rubbed them bright in fine sand and water, and fastened them with
bone hooks to fit my ears, they were very pretty.
on sunny days i would wear them with my cormorant dress and the necklace,

and walk along the cliff with rontu. i often
thought of tutok, but on these days especially i would look off into the north and wish that she were here to see me, i could
hear her talking in her strange language and i would make up things to say to her and things for her to say to me.

spring again was a time of flowers and water ran in the ravines and flowed down to the sea. many birds came back to the
island.
tainor and lurai built a nest in the tree where they were born. they built it of dry seaweed and leaves and also with hairs off
rontu's back. wh

d why it did not fall. they seldom did.
this one, which was white with a yellow beak, was not badly hurt, but he had a broken leg. i took him back to the house and
bound the bones together with two small sticks and sinew. for a while he did not try to walk. then, because he was not old
enough to fly, he began to hobble around the yard.
with the young birds and the old ones, the white gull and rontu, who was always trotting at my heels, the yard seemed a
happy place. if only i had not remembered tutok. if only i had not wondered about my sister ulape, where she was, and if 
the marks she had drawn upon her cheeks had proved magical. if they had, she was now married to kimki and was the
mother of many children. she would have smiled to see all of mine, which were so different from the ones i always wished to
have.
early that spring i started to gather abalones and i gathered many, taking them to the headland to dry. i wanted to have a good
supply ready if the aleuts came again.

over to myself. at last, because he looked so much like his father, i called him rontu-aru, which means son of rontu.
in a short time he made friends with me. he was not so large as rontu, but he had his father's thick coat and the same yellow
eyes. often when i watched him chasing gulls on the sandpits or on the reef barking at the otter, i forgot that he was not
rontu.
we had many happy times that summer, fishing and going to tall rock in our canoe, but more and more now i thought of
tutok and my sister ulape. sometimes i would hear their voices in the wind and often, when i was on the sea, in the waves
that lapped softly against the canoe.

after the fierce storms of winter came many days when the wind did not blow. the air was so heavy that it was hard to
breathe and the sun so hot that the sea was like a sun itself, too bright to look at.
the last day of this weather i took the canoe from the cave and paddled around the reef to the sandpits. i did not take rontuaru
