[CHARACTER] - 
                an
influential clan leader in umuofia. since early childhood, [CHARACTER]'s
embarrassment about his lazy, squandering, and effeminate father,
unoka, has driven him to succeed. [CHARACTER]'s hard work and prowess
in war have earned him a position of high status in his clan, and
he attains wealth sufficient to support three wives and their children.
[CHARACTER]'s tragic flaw is that he is terrified of looking weak like
his father. as a result, he behaves rashly, bringing a great deal
of trouble and sorrow upon himself and his family.
