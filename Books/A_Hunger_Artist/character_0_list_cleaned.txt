the [CHARACTER] - 
                the miserable protagonist of the story. dressed in black tights, the [CHARACTER] is emaciated. everything about his demeanor cries of desperation and tragedy. he sequesters himself in a cage, preferring to sit on the straw-lined floor rather than on a chair. although he craves public attention and is delighted to display himself to wide-eyed spectators, he is often frustrated with the interactions he has with others. while in his cage, the [CHARACTER] withdraws into himself, seemingly in a trance. he thinks of little more than the art of fasting and his desire to be the greatest faster of all time.
