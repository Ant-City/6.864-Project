The Nurse - 
                Juliet's
nurse, the woman who breast-fed Juliet when she was a baby and has
cared for Juliet her entire life. A vulgar, long-winded, and sentimental
character, the Nurse provides comic relief with her frequently inappropriate
remarks and speeches. But, until a disagreement near the play's
end, the Nurse is Juliet's faithful confidante and loyal intermediary
in Juliet's affair with Romeo. She provides a contrast with Juliet, given
that her view of love is earthy and sexual, whereas Juliet is idealistic
and intense. The Nurse believes in love and wants Juliet to have
a nice-looking husband, but the idea that Juliet would want to sacrifice
herself for love is incomprehensible to her.
