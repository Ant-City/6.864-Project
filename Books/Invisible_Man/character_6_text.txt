all
passed now with his disgrace, and what on the part of the school officials
had been an attitude of contempt blunted by tolerance, had now become a
contempt sharpened by hate. i didn't understand in those pre-invisible days
that their hate, and mine too, was charged with fear. how all of us at the
college hated the black-belt people, the "peasants," during those days! we
were trying to lift them up and they, like trueblood, did everything it seemed
to pull us down.
"it appears quite old," mr. norton said, looking across the bare, hard
stretch of yard where two women dressed in new blue-and-white checked
ginghams were washing clothes in an iron pot. the pot was soot-black and
the feeble flames that licked its sides showed pale pink and bordered with
black, like flames in mourning. both women moved with the weary,
full-fronted motions of far-gone pregnancy.
"it is, sir," i said. "that one and the other two like it were built
during slavery times."
"you don't say! i would never have believed

upon the new blue overalls as the man appeared
around the cabin. his shoes were tan and new and he moved easily over the
hot earth. he was a small man and he covered the yard with a familiarity
that would have allowed him to walk in the blackest darkness with the same
certainty. he came and said something to the women as he fanned himself
with a blue bandanna handkerchief. but they appeared to regard him sullenly,
barely speaking, and hardly looking in his direction.
"would that be the man?" mr. norton asked.
"yes, sir. i think so."
"get out!" he cried. "i must talk with him."
i was unable to move. i felt surprise and a dread and resentment of
what he might say to trueblood and his women, the questions he might ask.
why couldn't he leave them alone!
"hurry!"
i climbed from the car and opened the rear door. he clambered out
and almost ran across the road to the yard, as though compelled by some
pressing urgency which i could not understand. then suddenly i saw the two
women turn and run franti

 they became silent, their faces clouding over, their features
becoming soft and negative, their eyes bland and deceptive. they were
crouching behind their eyes waiting for him to speak -- just as i recognized
that i was trembling behind my own. up close i saw what i had not seen
from the car: the man had a scar on his right cheek, as though he had been
hit in the face with a sledge. the wound was raw and moist and from time
to time he lifted his handkerchief to fan away the gnats.
"i, i --" mr. norton stammered, "i must talk with you!"
"all right, suh," jim trueblood said without surprise and waited.
"is it true . . . i mean did you?"
"suh?" trueblood asked, as i looked away.
"you have survived," he blurted. "but is it true . . .?"
"suh?" the farmer said, his brow wrinkling with bewilderment.
"i'm sorry, sir," i said, "but i don't think he understands you."
he ignored me, staring into trueblood's face as though reading a
message there which i could not perceive.
"you did and are unharmed!" h

oda and it goes away."
"no, no, no! let us go where there is shade," he said, looking about
excitedly and going swiftly to where the porch cast a swath of shade. we
followed him. the farmer placed his hand on my shoulder, but i shook it off,
knowing that i could explain nothing. we sat on the porch in a semicircle in
camp chairs, me between the sharecropper and the millionaire. the earth
around the porch was hard and white from where wash water had long been
thrown.
"how are you faring now?" mr. norton asked. "perhaps i could
help."
"we ain't doing so bad, suh. 'fore they heard 'bout what happen to
us out here i couldn't git no help from nobody. now lotta folks is curious
and goes outta they way to help. even the biggity school folks up on the hill,
only there was a catch to it! they offered to send us clean outta the county,
pay our way and everything and give me a hundred dollars to git settled
with. but we likes it here so i told 'em no. then they sent a fellow out here,
a big fellow too,

doggone boy. i moved her arm and it was soft, but it didn't wake her, so i
called her, but that didn't wake her neither. then i turned my back and tried
to move away, though there wasn't much room and i could still feel her
touchin' me, movin' close to me. then i musta dropped into the dream. i
have to tell you 'bout that dream."
i looked at mr. norton and stood up, thinking that now was a good
time to leave; but he was listening to trueblood so intensely he didn't see
me, and i sat down again, cursing the farmer silently. to hell with his
dream!
"i don't quite remember it all, but i remember that i was lookin' for
some fat meat. i went to the white folks downtown and they said go see mr.

world. th

so like that fellow, i stayed, i had to
fight it on out to the end. he mighta died, but i suspects now that he got a
heapa satisfaction before he went. i know there ain't nothin' like what i went
through, i caint tell how it was. it's like when a real drinkin' man gits drunk,
or when a real sanctified religious woman gits so worked up she jumps outta
her clothes, or when a real gamblin' man keeps on gamblin' when he's losin'.
you got holt to it and you caint let go even though you want to."
"mr. norton, sir," i said in a choked voice, "it's time we were getting
back to the campus. you'll miss your appointments . . ."
he didn't even look at me. "please," he said, waving his hand in
annoyance.
trueblood seemed to smile at me behind his eyes as he looked from
the white man to me and continued.
"i couldn't even let go when i heard kate scream. it was a scream to
make your blood run cold. it sounds like a woman who was watchin' a team
of wild horses run down her baby chile and she caint move. kate

from the sharpenin' i'd give it a few days before, and man, way back in
myself, behind that windbreak, i says,
" 'naaw! kate -- lawd, kate, naw!!!' "
suddenly his voice was so strident that i looked up startled.
trueblood seemed to look straight through mr. norton, his eyes glassy. the
children paused guiltily at their play, looking toward their father.
"i might as well been pleadin' with a switch engine," he went on. "i
sees it comin' down. i sees the light catchin' on it, i sees kate's face all

he was some farmer. as i listened i had been so torn between
humiliation and fascination that to lessen my sense of shame i had kept my
attention riveted upon his intense face. that way i did not have to look at
mr. norton. but now as the voice ended i sat looking down at mr. norton's
feet. out in the yard a woman's hoarse contralto intoned a hymn. children's
voices were raised in playful chatter. i sat bent over, smelling the sharp dry
odor of wood burning in the hot sunlight. i stared at the two pairs of shoes
before me. mr. norton's were white, trimmed with black. they were custom
made and there beside the cheap tan brogues of the farmer they had the
elegantly slender well-bred appearance of fine gloves. final

his throat and i looked up to see mr. norton staring silently into jim
trueblood's eyes. i was startled. his face had drained of color. with his
bright eyes burning into trueblood's black face, he looked ghostly. trueblood
looked at me questioningly.
"lissen to the younguns," he said in embarrassment. "playin' 'london
bridge's fallin' down.' "
something was going on which i didn't get. i had to get mr. norton
away.
"are you all right, sir?" i asked.
he looked at me with unseeing eyes. "all right?" he said.
"yes, sir. i mean that i think it's time for the afternoon session," i
hurried on.
he stared at me blankly.
i went to him. "are you sure you're all right, sir?"
"maybe it's the heat," trueblood said. "you got to be born down here
to stand this kind of heat."
"perhaps," mr. norton said, "it is the heat. we'd better go."
he stood shakily, still staring intently at trueblood. then i saw him
removing

a red moroccan-leather wallet from his coat pocket. the
platinum-framed miniature came with it, but he did not look at it this time.
"here," he said, extending a banknote. "please take this and buy the
children some toys for me."
trueblood's mouth fell agape, his eyes widened and filled with
moisture as he took the bill between trembling fingers. it was a
hundred-dollar bill.
"i'm ready, young man," mr. norton said, his voice a whisper.
i went before him to the car and opened the door. he stumbled a
bit climbing in and i gave him my arm. his face was still chalk white.
"drive me away from here," he said in a sudden frenzy. "away!"
"yes, sir."
i saw jim trueblood wave as i threw the car into gear. "you
bastard," i said under my breath. "you no-good bastard! you get a
hundred-dollar bill!"
when i had turned the car and started back i saw him still standing
in the same place.
suddenly mr. norton touched

i saw them as we approached the short stretch that lay between the
railroad tracks and the golden day. at first i failed to recognize them. they
straggled down the highway in a loose body, blocking the way from the white
line to the frazzled weeds that bordered the sun-heated concrete slab. i
cursed them silently. they were blocking the road and mr. norton was
gasping for breath. ahead of the radiator's gleaming curve they looked like a
chain gang on its way to make a road. but a chain gang marches single file
and i saw no guards on horseback. as i drew nearer i recognized the loose
gray shirts and pants worn by the veterans. damn! they were heading for the
golden day.
"a little stimulant," i heard behind me.
"in a few minutes, sir."
up ahead i saw the one who thought he was a drum major strutting
in front, giving orders as he moved energetically

always too big for your britches. countersign me!"
"this is general pershing's car, sir," i said, remembering hearing that
he responded to the name of his wartime commander-in-chief. suddenly the
wild look changed in his eyes and he stepped back and saluted with stiff
precision. then looking suspiciously into the back seat, he barked,
"where's the general?"
"there," i said, turning and seeing mr. norton raising himself, weak
and white-faced, from the seat.
"what is it? why have we stopped?"
"the sergeant stopped us, sir . . ."
"sergeant? what sergeant?" he sat up.
"is that you, general?" the vet said, saluting. "i didn't know you were
inspecting the front lines today. i'm very sorry, sir."
"what . . . ?" mr. norton said.
"the general's in a hurry," i said quickly.
"sure is," the vet said. "he's got a lot to see. discipline is bad.
artillery's shot to hell." then he called to the men walking up

 the road, "get
the hell out of the general's road. general pershing's coming through. make
way for general pershing!"
he stepped aside and i shot the car across the line to avoid the men
and stayed there on the wrong side as i headed for the golden day.
"who was that man?" mr. norton gasped from the back seat.
"a former soldier, sir. a vet. they're all vets, a little shellshocked."
"but where is the attendant?"
"i don't see one, sir. they're harmless though."
"nevertheless, they should have an attendant."
i had to get him there and away before they arrived. this was their
day to visit the girls, and the golden day would be pretty rowdy. i wondered
where the rest of them were. there should have been about fifty. well, i
would rush in and get the whiskey and leave. what was w

"well, who's sick?"
"he is."
"he too good to come in? tell him we don't jimcrow nobody."
"but he's sick."
"he can die!"
"he's important, halley, a trustee. he's rich and sick and if anything
happens to him, they'll have me packed and on my way home."
"can't help it, school-boy. bring him inside and he can buy enough
to swim in. he can drink outta my own private bottle."
he sliced the white heads off a couple of beers with an ivory paddle
and passed them up the bar. i felt sick inside. mr. norton wouldn't want to
come in here. he was too sick. and besides i didn't want him to see the
patients and the girls. things were getting wilder as i made my way out.
supercargo, the white-uniformed attendant who usually kept the men quiet
was nowhere to be seen. i didn't like it, for when he was upstairs they had
absolutely no inhibitions. i made my way out to the car. what could i tell
mr. norton? he was lying very still when i opened the door.
"mr. norton, sir. they refuse to sell me whiskey to b

he lay very still.
"mr. norton."
he lay like a figure of chalk. i shook him gently, feeling dread within
me. he barely breathed. i shook him violently, seeing his head wobble
grotesquely. his lips parted, bluish, revealing a row of long, slender,
amazingly animal-like teeth.
"sir!"
in a panic i ran back into the golden day, bursting through the
noise as through an invisible wall.
"halley! help me, he's dying!"
i tried to get through but no one seemed to have heard me. i was
blocked on both sides. they were jammed together.

to pay my bills."
"please, they'll put me in jail."
"you going to college, figure it out," he said.
"you'd better bring the gentleman inside," the one called sylvester
said. "come, let us assist you."
we fought our way out of the crowd. he was just as i left him.
"look, sylvester, it's thomas jefferson!"
"i was just about to say, i've long wanted to discourse with him."
i looked at them speechlessly; they were both crazy. or were they
joking?
"give me a hand," i said.
"gladly."
i shook him. "mr. norton!"
"we'd better hurry if he's to enjoy his drink," one of them said
thoughtfully.
we picked him up. he swung between us like a sack of old clothes.
"hurry!"
as we carried him toward the golden day one of the men stopped
suddenly and mr. norton's head hung down, his white hair dragging in the
dust.
"gentlemen, this man is my grandfather!"
"but he's white, his name's norton."
"i should know my own grandfather! he's thomas jefferson and i'm
his grandson -- on the 'field-nigger' side," the tall man

said.
"sylvester, i do believe that you're right. i certainly do," he said,
staring at mr. norton. "look at those features. exactly like yours -- from the
identical mold. are you sure he didn't spit you upon the earth, fully clothed?"
"no, no, that was my father," the man said earnestly.
and he began to curse his father violently as we moved for the door.
halley was there waiting. somehow he'd gotten the crowd to quiet down and
a space was cleared in the center of the room. the men came close to look
at mr. norton.
"somebody bring a chair."
"yeah, let mister eddy sit down."
"that ain't no m

"here's a chair for the messiah."
"stand back y'all," halley ordered. "give him some room."
burnside, who had been a doctor, rushed forward and felt for mr.
norton's pulse.
"it's solid! this man has a solid pulse! instead of beating, it vibrates.
that's very unusual. very."
someone pulled him away. halley reappeared with a bottle and a
glass. "here, some of y'all tilt his head back."
and before i could move, a short, pock-marked man appeared and
took mr. norton's head between his hands, tilting it at arm's length and then,
pinching the chin gently like a barber about to apply a razor, gave a sharp,
swift movement.
"pow!"
mr. norton's head jerked like a jabbed punching bag. five pale red
lines bloomed on the white cheek, glowing like fire beneath translucent stone.
i could not believe my eyes. i wanted to run. a woman tittered. i saw several
men rush for the door.
"cut it out, you damn fool!"
"a case of hysteria," the pock-marked man said quietly.
"git

"a mere mild case of hysteria," the pock-marked man said as they
pushed him away.
"hurry with the drink, halley!"
"heah, school-boy, you hold the glass. this here's brandy i been
saving for myself."
someone whispered tonelessly into my ear, "you see, i told you that
it would occur at 5:30. already the creator has come." it was the stolid-faced
man.
i saw halley tilt the bottle and the oily amber of brandy sloshing
into the glass. then tilting mr. norton's head back, i put the glass to his lips
and poured. a fine brown stream ran from the corner of his mouth, down his
delicate chin. the room was suddenly quiet. i felt a slight movement against
my hand, like a child's breast when it whimpers at the end of a spell of
crying. the fine-veined eyelids flickered. he coughed. i saw a slow red flush
creep, then spurt, up his neck, spreading over his face.
"hold it under his nose, school-boy. let 'im smell it."
i waved the glass beneath mr. norton's nos

said.
"i couldn't buy a drink to take out, sir, so i had to bring you

he looked about him. i followed his eyes and was amazed to see the
varied expressions on the patients' faces as they silently returned his gaze.
some were hostile, some cringing, some horrified; some, who when among
themselves were most violent, now appeared as submissive as children. and
some seemed strangely amused.
"are all of you patients?" mr. norton asked.
"me, i just runs the joint," halley said. "these here other fellows . .
."
"we're patients sent here as therapy," a short, fat, very
intelligent-looking man said. "but," he smiled, "they send along an attendant,
a kind of censor, to see that the therapy fails."
"you're nuts. i'm a dynamo of energy. i come to charge my
batteries," one of the vets insisted.
"i'm a student of history, sir," another interrupted with dramatic
gestures. "the world moves in a circle like a roulette wheel. in th

beginning to leap up and down in an explosion of glassy-eyed fury.
mr. norton blinked his eyes and straightened up.
"i'm a physician, may i take your pulse?" burnside said, seizing mr.
norton's wrist.
"don't pay him no mind, mister. he ain't been no doctor in ten
years. they caught him trying to change some blood into money."
"i did too!" the man screamed. "i discovered it and john d.

attendant set himself and kick, catching the little man just as he reached the
top, hard in the chest, sending him backwards in a curving dive into the
midst of the men behind him. supercargo got set to swing his leg again. it
was a narrow stair and only one man could get up at a time. as fast as they
rushed up, the giant kicked them back. he swung his leg, kicking them down
like a fungo-hitter batting out flies. watching him, i forgot mr. norton. the
golden day was in an uproar. half-dressed women appeared from the rooms
off the balcony. men hooted and yelled as at a football game.
"i want order!" the giant shouted as he sent a man flying down
the flight of stairs.
"they throwing bottles of liquor!" a woman screamed.
"real liquor!"
"that's a order he don't want," someone said.
a shower of bottles and glasses splashing whiskey crashed against the
balcony. i saw supercargo snap suddenly erect and grab his forehead, his face
bathed in whi

halley yelled near my ear. i saw the man being dragged toward the center of
the room.
"give the bastard some order!"
"here i'm forty-five and he's been acting like he's my old man!"
"so you like to kick, huh?" a tall man said, aiming a shoe at the
attendant's head. the flesh above his right eye jumped out as though it had
been inflated.
then i heard mr. norton beside me shouting, "no, no! not when
he's down!"
"lissen at the white folks," someone said. "he's the white folks'
man!"
men were jumping upon supercargo with both feet now and i felt
such an excitement that i wanted to join them. even the girls were yelling,
"give it to him good!" "he never pays me!" "kill him!"
"please, y'all, not here! not in my place!"
"you can't speak your mind when he's on duty!"
"hell, no!"
somehow i got pushed away from mr. norton and found myself

who was never seen without his shining phi beta kappa key.
"the men have lost control," he said through the uproar. "i think
you'd better leave."
"i'm trying to," i said, "as soon as i can get over to mr. norton."
mr. norton was gone from where i had left him. i rushed here and
there through the noisy men, calling his name.
when i found him he was under the stairs. somehow he had been
pushed there by the scuffling, reeling men and he lay sprawled in the chair
like an aged doll. in the dim light his features were sharp and white and his
closed eyes well-defined lines in a well-tooled face. i shouted his name above
the roar of the men, and got no answer. he was out again. i shook him,

which had now revealed itself in the madness of the golden day.
"stop screaming!" a voice commanded, and i felt myself pulled away.
it was the short fat man.
i clamped my mouth shut, aware for the first time that the shrill
sound was coming from my own throat. i saw the man's face relax as he
gave me a wry smile.
"that's better," he shouted into my ear. "he's only a man. remember
that. he's only a man!"
i wanted to tell him that mr. norton was much more than that, that
he was a rich white man and in my charge; but the very idea that i was
responsible for him was too much for me to put into words.
"let us take him to the balcony," the man said, pushing me toward
mr. norton's feet. i moved automatically, grasping the thin ankles as he
raised the white man by the armpits and backed from beneath the stairs. mr.
norton's head lolled upon his chest as though he were drunk or dead.

at a time. i had begun to worry about him, whether he was drunk like the
rest, when i saw three of the girls who had been leaning over the balustrade
watching the brawl come down to help us carry mr. norton up.
"looks like pops couldn't take it," one of them shouted.
"he's high as a georgia pine."
"yeah, i tell you this stuff halley got out here is too strong for white
folks to drink."
"not drunk, ill!" the fat man said. "go find a bed that's not being
used so he can stretch out awhile."
"sho, daddy. is there any other little favors i can do for you?"
"that'll be enough," he said.
one of the girls ran up ahead. "mine's just been changed. bring him

faintly breathing. i watched the fat man bend over him very professionally
and feel for his pulse.
"you a doctor?" a girl asked.
"not now, i'm a patient. but i have a certain knowledge."
another one, i thought, pushing him quickly aside. "he'll be all right.
let him come to so i can get him out of here."
"you needn't worry, i'm not like those down there, young fellow," he
said. "i really was a doctor. i won't hurt him. he's had a mild shock of some
kind."
we watched him bend over mr. norton again, feeling his pulse,
pulling back his eyelid.
"it's a mild shock," he repeated.
"this here golden day is enough to shock anybody," a girl said,
smoothing her apron over the smooth sensuous roll of her stomach.
another brushed mr. norton's white hair away from his forehead and
stroked it, smiling vacantly. "he's kinda cute," she said. "just like a little
white baby."
"what kinda ole baby?" the small skinny girl asked.
"that's the kind, an ole baby."

i went out on the balcony, seeing the tops of their heads. they were
still milling around, the juke box baying, the piano thumping, and over at the
end of the room, drenched with beer, supercargo lay like a spent horse upon
the bar.
starting down, i noticed a large piece of ice glinting in the remains
of an abandoned drink and seized its coldness in my hot hand and hurried
back to the room.
the vet sat staring at mr. norton, who now breathed with a slightly
irregular sound.
"you were quick," the man said, as he stood and reached for the ice.
"swift with the speed of anxiety," he added, as if to himself. "hand me that
clean towel -- there, from beside the basin."
i handed him one, seeing him fold the ice inside it and apply it to
mr. norton's face.
"is he all right?" i said.
"he will be in a few minutes. what happened to him?"
"i took him for a drive," i said.
"did you have an accident or something?"
"no," i said.

eyes. "a trustee of consciousness."
"what was that?" i asked.
"nothing . . . there now, he's coming out of it."
i had an impulse to run out of the room. i feared what mr. norton
would say to me, the expression that might come into his eyes. and yet, i
was afraid to leave. my eyes could not leave the face with its flickering lids.
the head moved from side to side in the pale glow of the light bulb, as
though denying some insistent voice which i could not hear. then the lids
opened, revealing pale pools of blue vagueness that finally solidified into

and i stepped hurriedly forward.
"he's a real doctor, sir," i said.
"i'll explain," the vet said. "get a glass of water."
i hesitated. he looked at me firmly. "get the water," he said, turning
to help mr. norton to sit up.
outside i asked edna for a glass of water and she led me down the
hall to a small kitchen, drawing it for me from a green old-fashioned cooler.
"i got some good liquor, baby, if you want to give him a drink," she
said.
"this will do," i said. my hands trembled so that the water spilled.
when i returned, mr. norton was sitting up unaided, carrying on a
conversation with the vet.
"here's some water, sir," i said, extending the glass.
he took it. "thank you," he said.
"not too much," th

e vet cautioned.
"your diagnosis is exactly that of my specialist," mr. norton said,
"and i went to several fine physicians before one could diagnose it. how did
you know?"
"i too was a specialist," the vet said.
"but how? only a few men in the whole country possess the
knowledge --"
"then one of them is an inmate of a semi-madhouse," the vet said.
"but there's nothing mysterious about it. i escaped for a while -- i went to
france with the army medical corps and remained there after the armistice
to study and practice."
"oh yes, and how long were you in france?" mr. norto

n asked.
"long enough," he said. "long enough to forget some fundamentals
which i should never have forgotten."
"what fundamentals?" mr. norton said. "what do you mean?"
the vet smiled and cocked his head. "things about life. such things
as most peasants and folk peoples almost always know through experience,
though seldom through conscious thought . . ."
"pardon me, sir," i said to mr. norton, "but now that you feel better,
shouldn't we go?"
"not just yet," he said. then to the doctor, "i'm very interested.
what happened to you?" a drop of water caught in one of his eyebrows
glittered like a chip of active diamond. i went over and sat on a chair. damn
this vet to hell!
"are you sure you would like to hear?" the vet asked.
"why, of course."
"then perhaps the young fellow should go downstairs and wait . . ."
the sound of shouting and destruction welled up from below as i

"no, perhaps you should stay," the fat man said. "perhaps had i
overheard some of what i'm about to tell you when i was a student up there
on the hill, i wouldn't be the casualty that i am."
"sit down, young man," mr. norton ordered. "so you were a student
at the college," he said to the vet.
i sat down again, worrying about dr. bledsoe as the fat man told
mr. norton of his attending college, then becoming a physician and going to
france during the world war.
"were you a successful physician?" mr. norton said.
"fairly so. i performed a few brain surgeries that won me some
small attention."
"then why did you return?"
"nostalgia," the vet said.
"then what on earth are you doing here in this . . . ?" mr. norton
said, "with your ability . . ."
"ulcers," the fat man said.
"that's terribly unfortunate, but why should ulcers stop your career?"
"not really, but i l

earned along with the ulcers that my work could
bring me no dignity," the vet said.
"now you sound bitter," mr. norton said, just as the door flew open.
a brown-skinned woman with red hair looked in. "how's white-folks
making out?" she said, staggering inside. "white-folks, baby, you done come
to. you want a drink?"
"not now, hester," the vet said. "he's still a little weak."
"he sho looks it. that's how come he needs a drink. put some iron
in his blood."
"now, now, hester."
"okay, okay . . . but what y'all doing looking like you at a funeral?

scared to death. and white-folks here is acting like y'all two strange poodles.
be happy y'all! i'm going down and get halley to send you up some drinks."
she patted mr. norton's cheek as she went past and i saw him turn a
glowing red. "be happy, white-folks."
"ah hah!" the vet laughed, "you're blushing, which means that you're
better. don't be embarrassed. hester is a great humanitarian, a therapist of
generous nature and great skill, and the possessor of a healing touch. her
catharsis is absolutely tremendous -- ha, ha!"
"you do look better, sir," i said, anxious to get out of the place. i
could understand the vet's words but not what they conveyed, and mr.

ooked as uncomfortable as i felt. the one thing which i did know
was that the vet was acting toward the white man with a freedom which
could only bring on trouble. i wanted to tell mr. norton that the man was
crazy and yet i received a fearful satisfaction from hearing him talk as he
had to a white man. with the girl it was different. a woman usually got
away with things a man never could.
i was wet with anxiety, but the vet talked on, ignoring the
interruption.
"rest, rest," he said, fixing mr. norton with his eyes. "the clocks are
all set back and the forces of destruction are rampant down below. they
might suddenly realize that you are what you are, and then your life wouldn't
be worth a piece of bankrupt stock. you would be canceled, perforated,
voided, become the recognized magnet attracting loose screws. then what
would you do? such men are beyond money, and with supercargo down, out
like a felled ox, they know nothing of value. to some, you are the great

"what are you talking about?" i said, thinking: lyncher? he was
getting wilder than the men downstairs. i didn't dare look at mr. norton,
who made a sound of protest.
the vet frowned. "it is an issue which i can confront only by
evading it. an utterly stupid proposition, and these hands so lovingly trained
to master a scalpel yearn to caress a trigger. i returned to save life and i
was refused," he said. "ten men in masks drove me out from the city at
midnight and beat me with whips for saving a human life. and i was forced
to the utmost degradation because i possessed skilled hands and the belief
that my knowledge could bring m

then suddenly he fixed me with his eyes. "and now, do you
understand?"
"what?" i said.
"what you've heard!"
"i don't know."
"why?"
i said, "i really think it's time we left."
"you see," he said turning to mr. norton, "he has eyes and ears and
a good distended african nose, but he fails to understand the simple facts of
life. understand. understand? it's worse than that. he registers with his
senses but short-circuits his brain. nothing has meaning. he takes it in but
he doesn't digest it. already he is -- well, bless my soul! behold! a walking
zombie! already he's learned to repress not only his emotions but his
humanity. he's invisible, a walking personification of the negative, the most

nt of your dreams, sir! the mechanical man!"
mr. norton looked amazed.
"tell me," the vet said, suddenly calm. "why have you been
interested in the school, mr. norton?"
"out of a sense of my destined role," mr. norton said shakily. "i felt,
and i still feel, that your people are in some important manner tied to my
destiny."
"what do you mean, destiny?" the vet said.
"why, the success of my work, of course."
"i see. and would you recognize it if you saw it?"
"why, of course i would," mr. norton said indignantly. "i've watched
it grow each year i've returned to the campus."
"campus? why the campus?"
"it is there that my destiny is being made."
the vet exploded with laughter. "the campus, what a destiny!" he
stood and walked around the narrow room, laughing. then he stopped as
suddenly as he had begun.
"you will hardly recognize it, but it is very fitting that you came to
the golden day with the young fellow," he said.
"i came out of illness -- or rather, he brought me," mr. norton said

.
"of course, but you came, and it was fitting."
"what do you mean?" mr. norton said with irritation.
"a little child shall lead them," the vet said with a smile. "but
seriously, because you both fail to understand what is happening to you. you
cannot see or hear or smell the truth of what you see -- and you, looking for
destiny! it's classic! and the boy, this automaton, he was made of the very
mud of the region and he sees far less than you. poor stumblers, neither of
you can see the other. to you he is a mark on the score-card of your
achievement, a thing and not a man;

 a child, or even less -- a black
amorphous thing. and you, for all your power, are not a man to him, but a
god, a force --"
mr. norton stood abruptly. "let us go, young man," he said angrily.
"no, listen. he believes in you as he believes in the beat of his
heart. he believes in that great false wisdom taught slaves and pragmatists
alike, that white is right. i can tell you his destiny. he'll do your bidding,
and for that his blindness is his chief asset. he's your man, friend. your man
and your destiny. now the two of you descend the stairs into chaos and get
the hell out of here. i'm sick of both of you pitiful obscenities!

i do you both the favor of bashing in your heads!"
i saw his motion toward the big white pitcher on the washstand and
stepped between him and mr. norton, guiding mr. norton swiftly through the
doorway. looking back, i saw him leaning against the wall making a sound
that was a blending of laughter and tears.
"hurry, the man is as insane as the rest," mr. norton said.
"yes, sir," i said, noticing a new note in his voice.
the balcony was now as noisy as the floor below. the girls and
drunken vets were stumbling about with drinks in their hands. just as we
went past an open door edna saw us and grabbed my arm.
"where you taking white-folks?" she demanded.
"back to school," i said, shaking her off.
"you don't want to go up there, white-folks, baby," she said. i tried
to push past her. "i ain't lying," she said. "i'm the best little home-maker in

ess."
"okay, but please let us alone," i pleaded. "you'll get me into
trouble."
we were going down the stairs into the milling men now and she
started to scream, "pay me then! if he's too good for me, let him pay!"
and before i could stop her she had pushed mr. norton, and both of
us were stumbling swiftly down the stairs. i landed against a man who
looked up with the anonymous familiarity of a drunk and shoved me hard
away. i saw mr. norton spin past as i sank farther into the crowd.
somewhere i could hear the girl screaming and halley's voice yelling, "hey!
hey! hey, now!" then i was aware of fresh air and saw that i was near the
door and pushed my way free and stood panting and preparing to plunge
back for mr. norton -- when i heard halley calling, "make way y'all!" and
saw him piloting mr. norton to the door.
"whew!" he said, releasing the white man and shaking his huge head.
"thanks, halley --" i said and got no further.
i saw

 mr. norton, his face pale again, his white suit rumpled, topple
and fall, his head scraping against the screen of the door.
"hey!"
i opened the door and raised him up.
"goddamit, out agin," halley said. "how come you bring this white
man here, school-boy?"
"is he dead?"
"dead!" he said, stepping back indignantly. "he caint die!"
"what'll i do, halley?"
"not in my place, he caint die," he said, kneeling.
mr. norton looked up. "no one is dead or dying," he said acidly.
"remove your hands!"
halley fell away, surprised. "i sho am glad. you sho you all right? i
thought sho you was dead this time."
"for god's sake, be quiet!" i exploded nervously. "you should be glad
that he's all right."
mr. norton was visibly angry now, a raw place showing on his
forehead, and i hurried ahead of him to the car. he climbed in unaided, and
i got under the wheel, smelling the heated odor of mints and cigar smoke.
he was silent

the wheel felt like an alien thing in my hands as i followed the
white line of the highway. heat rays from the late afternoon sun arose from
the gray concrete, shimmering like the weary tones of a distant bugle blown
upon still midnight air. in the mirror i could see mr. norton staring out
vacantly upon the empty fields, his mouth stern, his white forehead livid
where it had scraped the screen. and seeing him i felt the fear balled coldly
within me unfold. what would happen now? what would the school officials
say? in my mind i visualized dr. bledsoe's face when he saw mr. norton. i
thought of the glee certain folks at home would feel if i were expelled.
tatlock's grinning face danced through my mind. what would the white folks
think who'd sent me to college? was mr.

norton angry at me? in the golden
day he had seemed more curious than anything else -- until the vet had
started talking wild. damn trueblood. it was his fault. if we hadn't sat in the
sun so long mr. norton would not have needed whiskey and i wouldn't have
gone to the golden day. and why would the vets act that way with a white
man in the house?
i headed the car through the red-brick campus gateposts with a sense
of cold apprehension. now even the rows of neat dormitories seemed to
threaten me, the rolling lawns appearing as hostile as the gray highway with
its white dividing line. as of its own compulsion, the car slowed as we passed
the chapel with its low, sweeping eaves. the sun shone coolly t

sta washed by the sun. in the brief
interval i heard a cheer arise. my predicament struck me like a stab. i had a
sense of losing control of the car and slammed on the brakes in the middle
of the road, then apologized and drove on. here within this quiet greenness i
possessed the only identity i had ever known, and i was losing it. in this
brief moment of passage i became aware of the connection between these
lawns and buildings and my hopes and dreams. i wanted to stop the car and
talk with mr. norton, to beg his pardon for what he had seen; to plead and
show him tears, unashamed tears like those of a child before his parent; to
denounce all we'd seen and heard; to assure him that far from being like any
of the people we had seen, i hated them, that i believed in the principles of
the founder with all my heart and soul, and that i believed in his own
goodness and kindness in extending the hand of his benevolence to helping
us poor, ignorant people out of the mire and darkness. i would do his

tears filled my eyes, and the walks and buildings flowed and froze
for a moment in mist, glittering as in winter when rain froze on the grass
and foliage and turned the campus into a world of whiteness, weighting and
bending both trees and bushes with fruit of crystal. then in the twinkling of
my eyes, it was gone, and the here and now of heat and greenness returned.
if only i could make mr. norton understand what the school meant to me.
"shall i stop at your rooms, sir?" i said. "or shall i take you to the
administration building? dr. bledsoe might be worried."
"to my rooms, then bring dr. bledsoe to me," he answered tersely.
"yes, sir."
in the mirror i saw him dabbing gingerly at his forehead with a
crinkled handkerchief. "you'd better send the school physician to me also," he
said.
i stopped the car in front of a small building with white pillars like
those of an old plantation manor h

"mr. norton, please, sir . . . i'm sorry . . . i --"
he looked at me sternly, his eyes narrowed, saying nothing.
"i didn't know . . . please . . ."
"send dr. bledsoe to me," he said, turning away and swinging up the
graveled path to the building.
i got back into the car and drove slowly to the administration
building. a girl waved gaily as i passed, a bunch of violets in her hand. two
teachers in dark suits talked decorously beside a broken fountain.
the building was quiet. going upstairs i visualized dr.

fun at, he had achieved power and authority; had, while black and
wrinkle-headed, made himself of more importance in the world than most
southern white men. they could laugh at him but they couldn't ignore him.
"he's been looking all over for you," the girl at the desk said.
when i walked in he looked up from the telephone and said, "never
mind, he's here now," and hung up. "where's mr. norton?" he demanded
excitedly. "is he all right?"
"yes, sir. i left him at his rooms and came to drive you down. he
wishes to see you."
"is anything wrong?" he said, getting up hurriedly and coming around
the desk. i hesitated.
"well, is there!"
the panicky beating of my heart seemed to blur my vision.
"not now, sir."
"now? what do you mean?"
"well, sir, he had some kind of fainting spell."
"aw, my god! i knew something was wrong. why didn't you get in

sparkle of his eyes to betray the
emotion that i had seen only a moment before. he looked steadily at himself
for a moment; then we moved quietly down the silent hall and up the stairs.
a co-ed sat at a graceful table stacked with magazines. before a great
window stood a large aquarium containing colored stones and a small replica
of a feudal castle surrounded by goldfish that seemed to remain motionless
despite the fluttering of their lacy fins, a momentary motionful suspension of
time.
"is mr. norton in his room?" he said to the girl.
"yessir, dr. bledsoe, sir," she said. "he said to tell you to come in
when you got here."
pausing at the door i heard him clear his throat, then rap softly
upon the panel with his fist.
"mr. norton?" he said, his lips already a smile. and at the answer i
followed him inside.
it was a large light room. mr. norton sat in a huge wing chair with
his jacket off. a change of clothing lay on the cool bedspread. above a
spacious fireplace an oil portrait of the founde

benign, sad, and in that hot instant, profoundly disillusioned. then a veil
seemed to fall.
"i've been worried about you, sir," dr. bledsoe said. "we expected

now it's beginning, i thought. now --
and suddenly he rushed forward. "mr. norton, your head!" he cried,
a strange grandmotherly concern in his voice. "what happened, sir?"
"it's nothing." mr. norton's face was immobile. "a mere scratch."
dr. bledsoe whirled around, his face outraged. "get the doctor over
here," he said. "why didn't you tell me that mr. norton had been injured?"
"i've already taken care of that, sir," i said softly, seeing him whirl
back.
"mr. norton, mister norton! i'm so sorry," he crooned. "i thought i
had sent you a boy who was careful, a sensible young man! why we've never
had an accident before. never, not in seventy-five years. i assure you, sir,

"but there was no automobile accident," mr. norton said kindly, "nor

my eyes suddenly filled. i felt a wave of gratitude at his words.
"don't be kind, sir," dr. bledsoe said. "you can't be soft with these
people. we mustn't pamper them. an accident to a guest of this college while
he is in the charge of a student is without question the student's fault. that's
one of our strictest rules!" then to me: "return to your dormitory and

"i'll explain, young man," mr. norton said with a half-smile.

"thank you, sir," i said, seeing dr. bledsoe looking at me with no
change of expression.
"on second thought," he said, "i want you to be in chapel this
evening, understand me, sir?"
"yes, sir."
i opened the door with a cold hand, bumping into the girl who had
been at the table when we went inside.

hadn't he always taught us to live content in our place in a thousand
unambiguous words? he had and i had believed him. i had believed without
question his illustrations of the good which came of following the founder's
path. it was my affirmation of life and they couldn't send me away for
something i didn't do. they simply couldn't. but that vet! he was so crazy
that he corrupted sane men. he had tried to turn the world inside out,
goddamn him! he had made mr. norton angry. he had no right to talk to a
white man as he had, not with me to take the punishment . . .
someone shook me and i recoiled, my legs moist and trembling. it
was my roommate.
"what the hell, roomy," he said. "let's go to chow."
i looked at his confident mug; he was going to be a farmer.
"i don't have an appetite," i said with a sigh.
"okay now," he said, "you can try to kid me but don't say i didn't

"no," i said.

 footsteps
from the hall: supper time. the sound of departing voices. something of my
life seemed to retreat with them into a gray distance, moiling. then a knock
sounded at the door and i sprang up, my heart tense.
a small student wearing a freshman's cap stuck his head in the door,
shouting, "dr. bledsoe said he wants to see you down at rabb hall." and
then he was gone before i could question him, his footsteps thundering down
the hall as he raced to dinner before the last bell sounded.
at mr. norton's door i stopped with my hand on the knob,
mumbling a prayer.
"come in, young man," he said to my knock. he was dressed in
fresh linen, the light falling upon his white hair as upon silk floss. a small
piece of gauze was plastered to his forehead. he was alone.
"i'm sorry, sir," i apologized, "but i was told that dr. bledsoe wanted
to see me here . . ."
"that's correct," he said, "but dr. bledsoe had to leave. you'll find
him in his office after chapel."
"thank you, sir," i said and turned to g

od, hesitating in the door, aware suddenly of the old heavy
furnishings, the relics from the times of the founder, the framed portrait
photographs and relief plaques of presidents and industrialists, men of
power-fixed like trophies or heraldic emblems upon the walls.
"come in," he said from the half-shadow; then i saw him move and
his head coming forward, his eyes burning.
he began mildly, as if quietly joking, throwing me off balance.
"boy," he said, "i understand that you not only carried mr. norton
out to the quarters but that you wound up at that sinkhole, that golden
day."
it was a statement, not a question. i said nothing and he looked at
me with the same mild gaze. had barbee helped mr. norton soften him?
"no," he said, "it wasn't enough to take him to the quarters, you
had to make the complete tour, to give him the full treatment. was that it?"
"no, sir . . . i mean that he was ill, sir," i said. "he had to have
some whiskey . . ."
"and that was the only place you knew to go," he sai

"he talked like a white man," i said, "except that his voice sounded
southern, like one of ours . . ."
"i'll have to investigate him," he said. "a negro like that should be
under lock and key."
across the campus a clock struck the quarter hour and something
inside me seemed to muffle its sound. i turned to him desperately. "dr.
bledsoe, i'm awfully sorry. i had no intention of going there but things just
got out of hand. mr. norton understands how it happened . . ."
"listen to me, boy," he said loudly. "norton is one man and i'm
another, and while he might think he's satisfied, i know that he isn't! your
poor judgment has caused this school incalculable damage. instead of uplifting
the race, you've torn it down."
he looked at me as though i had committed the worst crime
imaginable. "don't you know we can't tolerate such a thing? i gave you an
opportunity to serve one of our best white friends, a man who could make

rtune. but in return you dragged the entire race into the slime!"
suddenly he reached for something beneath a pile of papers, an old leg
shackle from slavery which he proudly called a "symbol of our progress."
"you've got to be disciplined, boy," he said. "there's no ifs and ands
about it."
"but you gave mr. norton your word . . ."
"don't stand there and tell me what i already know. regardless of
what i said, as the leader of this institution i can't possibly let this pass. boy,
i'm getting rid of you!" it must have happened when the metal struck the
desk, for suddenly i was leaning toward him, shouting with outrage.
"i'll tell him," i said. "i'll go to mr. norton and tell him. you've lied
to both of us . . ."
"what!" he said. "you have the nerve to threaten me . . . in my own
office?"
"i'll tell him," i

he paused to let it sink in and i waited, feeling a numb, violent
outrage.
"and i'll tell you something your sociology teachers are afraid to tell
you," he said. "if there weren't men like me running schools like this, there'd
be no south. nor north, either. no, and there'd be no country -- not as it is
today. you think about that, son." he laughed. "with all your speechmaking
and studying i thought you understood something. but you . . . all right, go
ahead. see norton. you'll find that he wants you disciplined; he might not
know it, but he does. because he knows that i know what is best for his
interests. you're a black educated fool, son. these white folk have newspapers,
magazines, radios, spokesmen to get their ideas across. if they want to tell
the world a lie, they can tell it so well that it becomes the truth; and if i tell

the truth. because it's the kind of lie they want

d thankful that it
was night with no one to witness my condition. my stomach felt raw. from
somewhere across the quiet of the campus the sound of an old guitar-blues
plucked from an out-of-tune piano drifted toward me like a lazy, shimmering
wave, like the echoed whistle of a lonely train, and my head went over again,
against a tree this time, and i could hear it splattering the flowering vines.
when i could move, my head started to whirl in a circle. the day's
events flowed past. trueblood, mr. norton, dr. bledsoe and the golden day
swept around my mind in a mad surreal whirl. i stood in the path holding
my eye and trying to push back the day, but each time i floundered upon
dr. bledsoe's decision. it still echoed in my mind and it was real and it was
final. whatever my responsibility was for what had occurred, i knew that i
would pay for it, knew that i would be expelled, and the very idea stabbed
my insides again. i stood there on the moonlit walk, trying to think ahead to
its effects, ima

"no, sir, it might make them feel too bad if i told them i was

"i see. perhaps that is best."
"well, good-bye, sir," i said, extending my hand.
"good-bye," he said. his hand was large and strangely limp.
he pressed a buzzer as i turned to leave. his secretary brushed past
me as i went through the door.
the letters were waiting when i returned, seven of them, addressed
to men with impressive names. i looked for mr. norton's but his was not
among them. placing them carefully in my inside pocket, i grabbed my bags
and hurried for the bus.

in a gray uniform was pushing a broom. i bought my ticket and climbed into
the bus. there were only two passengers seated at the rear of the red and
nickel interior, and i suddenly felt that i was dreaming. it was the vet, who
gave me a smile of recognition; an attendant sat beside him.
"welcome, young m

an," he called. "imagine, mr. crenshaw," he said
to the attendant, "we have a traveling companion!"
"morning," i said reluctantly. i looked around for a seat away from
them, but although the bus was almost empty, only the rear was reserved for
us and there was nothing to do but move back with them. i didn't like it;
the vet was too much a part of an experience which i was already trying to
blot out of my consciousness. his way of talking to mr. norton had been a
foreshadowing of my misfortune -- just as i had sensed that it would be.
now having accepted my punishment, i wanted to remember nothing
connected with trueblood or the golden day.
crenshaw, a much smaller man than supercargo, said nothing. he
was not the type usually sent out to accompany violent cases and i was glad
until i remembered that the only violent thing about the vet was his tongue.
his mouth had already gotten me into trouble and now i hoped he wouldn't
turn it upon the w

hite driver -- that was apt to get us killed. what was he
doing on the bus anyway? god, how had dr. bledsoe worked that fast? i
stared at the fat man.
"how did your friend mr. norton make out?" he asked.
"he's okay," i said.
"no more fainting spells?"
"no."
"did he bawl you out for what happened?"
"he didn't blame me," i said.
"good. i think i shocked him more than anything else he saw at the
golden day. i hoped i hadn't caused you trouble. school isn't out so soon, is
it?"
"not quite," i said lightly. "i'm leaving early in order to take a job."
"wonderful! at home?"
"no, i thought i might make more money in new york."
"new york!" he said. "that's not a place, it's a dream.

too busy working to enjoy the rest of the time. he'll see."
i tried to change the subject. "where are you going?" i asked.
"to washington, d. c.," he said.
"then you're cured?"
"cured? there is no cure --"
"he's being transferred," said crenshaw.
"yes, i'm headed for st. elizabeth's," the vet said. "the ways of
authority are indeed mysterious. for a year i've tried to get transferred, then
this morning i'm suddenly told to pack. i can't but wonder if our little
conversation with your friend mr. norton had something to do with it."
"how could he have anything to do with it?" i said, remembering dr.
bledsoe's threat.
"how could he have anything to do with your being on this bus?" he
said.
he winked. his eyes twinkled. "all right, forget what i've said. but
for god's sake, learn to look beneath the surface," he said. "come out of the
fog, young man. and remember you don't have to be a complete fool in
order to succeed. play the game, but don't believe in it -- that much you owe
yourself. even i

he unknown.
the vet and crenshaw prepared to change busses at the next stop,
and upon leaving, the vet placed his hand upon my shoulder and looked at
me with kindness, and, as always, he smiled.
"now is the time for offering fatherly advice," he said, "but i'll have
to spare you that -- since i guess i'm nobody's father except my own.
perhaps that's the advice to give you: be your own father, young man. and
remember, the world is possibility if only you'll discover it. last of all, leave
the mr. nortons alone, and if you don't know what i mean, think about it.
farewell."
i watched him following crenshaw through the group of passengers
waiting to get on, a short, comical figure turning to wave, then disappearing
through the door of the red brick terminal. i sat back with a sigh of relief,
yet once the passengers were aboard and the bus under way again, i felt sad
and utterly alone.
not until we were sailing through the jersey countryside did my
spirits begin to rise. then my old confidence and

fears were groundless, there was nothing to it. this was new york.
i succeeded in reaching several trustees' secretaries during the days
that followed, and all were friendly and encouraging. some looked at me
strangely, but i dismissed it since it didn't appear to be antagonism. perhaps
they're surprised to see someone like me with introductions to such important
men, i thought. well, there were unseen lines that ran from north to south,
and mr. norton had called me his destiny . . . i swung my brief case with
confidence.
with things going so well i distributed my letters in the mornings,
and saw the city during the afternoons. walking about the streets, sitting on
subways beside whites, eating with them in the same cafeterias (although i
avoided their tables) gave me the eerie, out-of-focus sensation of a dream. my
clothes felt ill-fitting; and for all my letters to men of power, i was unsure of
how i should act. for the first time, as i swu

had been lying about the job.
finally i tried to reach the important men by telephone, only to
receive polite refusals by their secretaries. but fortunately i still had the letter
to mr. emerson. i decided to use it, but instead of handing it over to a
secretary, i wrote a letter explaining that i had a message from dr. bledsoe
and requesting an appointment. maybe i've been wrong about the secretaries,
i thought; maybe they destroyed the letters. i should have been more careful.
i thought of mr. norton. if only the last letter had been addressed to
him. if only he lived in new york so that i could make a personal appeal!
somehow i felt closer to mr. norton, and felt that if he should see me, he
would remember that it was i whom he connected so closely to his fate. now
it seemed ages ago and in a different season and a distant land. actually, it
was less than a month. i became energetic and wrote him a letter, expressing
my belief that my future would be immeasurably different if only i could

ghting and struggles against flood, storm and forest fire,
with the out-numbered settlers winning each engagement; an epic of wagon
trains rolling ever westward. i forgot myself (although there was no one like
me taking part in the adventures) and left the dark room in a lighter mood.
but that night i dreamed of my grandfather and awoke depressed. i walked
out of the building with a queer feeling that i was playing a part in some
scheme which i did not understand. somehow i felt that bledsoe and norton
were behind it, and all day i was inhibited in both speech and conduct, for
fear that i might say or do something scandalous. but this was all fantastic, i
told myself. i was being too impatient. i could wait for the trustees to make
a move. perhaps i was being subjected to a test of some kind. they hadn't
told me the rules, i knew, but the feeling persisted. perhaps my exile would
end suddenly and i would be given a scholarship to return to the campus.
but when? how long?

 of weathered wood. and
i remembered how the splinters in some of the boards were raised from the
grain by the wind, the sun and the rain until the clapboards shone with a
satiny, silvery, silver-fish sheen. like trueblood's cabin, or the golden day . .
. the golden day had once been painted white; now its paint was flaking
away with the years, the scratch of a finger being enough to send it
showering down. damn that golden day! but it was strange how life
connected up; because i had carried mr. norton to the old rundown building
with rotting paint, i was here. if, i thought, one could slow down his
heartbeats and memory to the tempo of the black drops falling so slowly into
the bucket yet reacting so swiftly, it would seem like a sequence in a feverish
dream . . . i was so deep in reverie that i failed to hear kimbro approach.
"how's it coming?" he said, standing with hands on hips.
"all right, sir."
"let's see," he said, selecting a sample and running his thumb across
the board. "that's it,

 "yours was a difficult case, and a number of specialists had to be called
in. but, after all, any new occupation has its hazards. they are part of
growing up, of becoming adjusted, as it were. one takes a chance and while
some are prepared, others are not."
i looked at his lined face. was he doctor, factory official, or both? i
couldn't get it; and now he seemed to move back and forth across my field
of vision, although he sat perfectly calm in his chair.
it came out of itself: "do you know mr. norton, sir?" i said.
"norton?" his brows knitted. "what norton is this?"
then it was as though i hadn't asked him; the name sounded
strange. i ran my hand over my eyes.
"i'm sorry," i said. "it occurred to me that you might. he was just a
man i used to know."
"i see. well" -- he picked up some papers -- "so that's the way it is,
my boy. a little later perhaps we'll be able to do something. you may take
the papers along if you wish. just mail them to us. your check will be sent
upon their return. mean

while, take as much time as you like. you'll find that
we are perfectly fair."
i took the folded papers and looked at him for what seemed to be
too long a time. he seemed to waver. then i heard myself say, "do you
know him?" my voice rising.
"who?"
"mr. norton," i said. "mr. norton!"
"oh, why, no."
"no," i said, "no one knows anybody and it was too long a time
ago."
he frowned and i laughed. "they picked poor robin clean," i said.
"do you happen to know bled?"
he looked at me, his head to one side. "are these people friends of
yours?"
"friends? oh, yes," i said, "we're all good friends. buddies from way
back. but i don't suppose we get around in the same circles."
his eyes widened. "no," he said, "i don't suppose we do. however,
good friends are valuable to have."
i felt

 blood and skin do not think!"
but no, it wasn't woodridge. "more human" . . . did i mean that i
had become less of what i was, less a negro, or that i was less a being
apart; less an exile from down home, the south? . . . but all this is negative.
to become less -- in order to become more? perhaps that was it, but in what
way more human? even woodridge hadn't spoken of such things. it was a
mystery once more, as at the eviction i had uttered words that had possessed
me.
i thought of bledsoe and norton and what they had done. by kicking
me into the dark they'd made me see the possibility of achieving something
greater and more important than i'd ever dreamed. here was a way that
didn't lead through the back door, a way not limited by black and white, but
a way which, if one lived long enough and worked hard enough, could lead
to the highest possible rewards. here was a way to have a part in making
the big decisions, of seeing through the mystery of how the country, the
world, really operated.

and because they were blind they would destroy themselves and i'd
help them. i laughed. here i had thought they accepted me because they felt
that color made no difference, when in reality it made no difference because
they didn't see either color or men . . . for all they were concerned, we were
so many names scribbled on fake ballots, to be used at their convenience and
when not needed to be filed away. it was a joke, an absurd joke. and now i
looked around a corner of my mind and saw jack and norton and emerson
merge into one single white figure. they were very much the same, each
attempting to force his picture of reality upon me and neither giving a hoot
in hell for how things looked to me. i was simply a material, a natural
resource to be used. i had switched from the arrogant absurdity of norton
and emerson to that of jack and the brotherhood, and it all came out the
same -- except i now recognized my invisibility.
so i'd accept it, i'd explore it, rine and heart. i'd plunge into it wi

s now, just now, a leader, though leading
them, running ahead of them, only in the stripping away of my illusionment.
i looked at ras on his horse and at their handful of guns and
recognized the absurdity of the whole night and of the simple yet
confoundingly complex arrangement of hope and desire, fear and hate, that
had brought me here still running, and knowing now who i was and where i
was and knowing too that i had no longer to run for or from the jacks and
the emersons and the bledsoes and nortons, but only from their confusion,
impatience, and refusal to recognize the beautiful absurdity of their american
identity and mine. i stood there, knowing that by dying, that by being hanged
by ras on this street in this destructive night i would perhaps move them
one fraction of a bloody step closer to a definition of who they were and of
what i was and had been. but the definition would have been too narrow; i
was invisible, and hanging would not bring me to visibility, even to their
eyes, sin

you've run enough, you're through with them at last," and i collapsed, face
forward and lay there beyond the point of exhaustion, too tired to close my
eyes. it was a state neither of dreaming nor of waking, but somewhere in
between, in which i was caught like trueblood's jaybird that yellow jackets
had paralyzed in every part but his eyes.
but somehow the floor had now turned to sand and the darkness to
light, and i lay the prisoner of a group consisting of jack and old emerson
and bledsoe and norton and ras and the school superintendent and a
number of others whom i failed to recognize, but all of whom had run me,
who now pressed around me as i lay beside a river of black water, near
where an armored bridge arched sharply away to where i could not see. and
i was protesting their holding me and they were demanding that i return to
them and were annoyed with my refusal.
"no," i said. "i'm through with all your illusions and lies, i'm
through running."
"not quite," jack said above the others'

 because they had exhausted
in us, some -- not much, but some -- of the human greed and smallness, yes,
and the fear and superstition that had kept them running. (oh, yes, they're
running too, running all over themselves.) or was it, did he mean that we
should affirm the principle because we, through no fault of our own, were
linked to all the others in the loud, clamoring semi-visible world, that world
seen only as a fertile field for exploitation by jack and his kind, and with
condescension by norton and his, who were tired of being the mere pawns in
the futile game of "making history"? had he seen that for these too we had
to say "yes" to the principle, lest they turn upon us to destroy both it and
us?
"agree 'em to death and destruction," grandfather had advised. hell,
weren't they their own death and their own destruction except as the
principle lived in them and in us? and here's the cream of the joke: weren't
we part of them as well as apart from them and subject to die when they
died?

til he sees me, then he'll ask his direction. maybe there's an
embarrassment in it if he admits he's lost to a strange white man. perhaps to
lose a sense of where you are implies the danger of losing a sense of who
you are. that must be it, i thought -- to lose your direction is to lose your
face. so here he comes to ask his direction from the lost, the invisible. very
well, i've learned to live without direction. let him ask.
but then he was only a few feet away and i recognized him; it was
mr. norton. the old gentleman was thinner and wrinkled now but as dapper
as ever. and seeing him made all the old life live in me for an instant, and i
smiled with tear-stinging eyes. then it was over, dead, and when he asked
me how to get to centre street, i regarded him with mixed feelings.
"don't you know me?" i said.
"should i?" he said.
"you see me?" i said, watching him tensely.
"why, of course -- sir, do you know the way to centre street?"
"so. last time it was the golden day, now it's centre stree

t. you've
retrenched, sir. but don't you know who i am?"
"young man, i'm in a hurry," he said, cupping a hand to his ear.
"why should i know you?"
"because i'm your destiny."
"my destiny, did you say?" he gave me a puzzled stare, backing
away. "young man, are you well? which train did you say i should take?"
"i didn't say," i said, shaking my head. "now, aren't you ashamed?"
"ashamed? ashamed!" he said indignantly.
i laughed, suddenly taken by the idea. "because, mr. norton, if you
don't know where you are, you probably don't know who you are. so you
came to me out of shame. you are ashamed, now aren't you?"
"young man, i've lived too long in this world to be ashamed of
anything. are you light-headed from hunger? how do you know my name?"
"but i'm your destiny, i made you. why shouldn't i know you?" i
said, walking closer and seeing him back against a pillar. he looked around
like a cornered animal. he thought i was mad.
"don't be afraid, mr. norton," i said. "the
