mrs.[CHARACTER] - 
      mrs. ranevksy is a middle-aged russian woman, the owner of the estate and the cherry orchard around which the story revolves. she has faced tragedy many times in her life, or rather has tried to escape from it. her first name, "lyuba," means "love" in russian, and she seems to exemplify love with her generosity, kindness and physical beauty, and sexual nature; she is the only character in the play with a lover. but her feelings of love often cloud her judgment, and she is also unable to control her spending, a sign of her disconnection from her present status as an impoverished aristocrat.
