Reverend John Hale - 
A young minister reputed to be an expert on witchcraft.
Reverend Hale is called in to Salem to examine Parris's daughter
Betty. Hale is a committed Christian and hater of witchcraft. His
critical mind and intelligence save him from falling into blind
fervor. His arrival sets the hysteria in motion, although he later regrets
his actions and attempts to save the lives of those accused.
