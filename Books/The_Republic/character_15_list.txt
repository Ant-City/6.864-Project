Knowledge - 
                According
to Plato, knowledge can only pertain to eternal, unchanging truths.
I can know, for instance that two plus two equals four, because
this will also be the case. I cannot know, however, that Meno is beautiful.
For this reason, only the intelligible realm, the realm of the Forms
can be the object of knowledge. See also Opinion.
