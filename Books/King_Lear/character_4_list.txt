Gloucester - 
                 A
nobleman loyal to King Lear whose rank, earl, is below that of duke.
The first thing we learn about Gloucester is that he is an adulterer,
having fathered a bastard son, Edmund. His fate is in many ways
parallel to that of Lear: he misjudges which of his children to trust.
He appears weak and ineffectual in the early acts, when he is unable
to prevent Lear from being turned out of his own house, but he later
demonstrates that he is also capable of great bravery.
