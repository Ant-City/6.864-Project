was during the war and she had on shiny orange rayon stockings, heâ€™d never seen
them before, my mother didnâ€™t wear them. a different year there we ran through the
snow across the sidewalk in our bare feet because we had no shoes, theyâ€™d worn out
during the summer. in the car that time we sat with our feet wrapped in blankets,
pretending we were wounded. my brother said the germans shot our feet off.
now though iâ€™m in another car, davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s; itâ€™s sharp-finned and striped
with chrome, a lumbering monster left over from ten years ago, he has to reach
under the instrument panel to turn on the lights. david says they canâ€™t afford a newer
one, which probably isnâ€™t true. heâ€™s a good driver, i realize that, i keep my outside
hand on the door in spite of it. to brace myself and so i can get out quickly if i have
to. iâ€™ve driven in the same car with them before but on this road it doesnâ€™t seem

iâ€™m in the back seat with the packsacks; this one, joe, is sitting beside me chewing
gum and holding my hand, they both pass the time. i examine the hand: the palm is
broad, the short fingers tighten and relax, fiddling with my gold ring, turning it, itâ€™s
a reflex of his. he has peasant hands, i have peasant feet, anna told us that. everyone
now can do a little magic, she reads hands at parties, she says itâ€™s a substitute for
conversation. when she did mine she said â€œdo you have a twin?â€ i said no. â€œare
you positive,â€ she said, â€œbecause some of your lines are double.â€ her index finger
traced me: â€œyou had a good childhood but then thereâ€™s this funny break.â€ she
puckered her forehead and i said i just wanted to know how long i was going to live,
she could skip the rest. after that she told u

ft, maybe that was a ruse, they could easily
still be living in there, the generals in concrete bunkers and the ordinary soldiers in
underground apartment buildings where the lights burn all the time. thereâ€™s no way
of checking because we arenâ€™t allowed in. the city invited them to stay, they were
good for business, they drank a lot.
â€œthatâ€™s where the rockets are,â€ i say. were. i donâ€™t correct it.
david says â€œbloody fascist pig yanks,â€ as though heâ€™s commenting on the
weather.
anna says nothing. her head rests on the back of the seat, the ends of her light
hair whipping in the draft from the side window that wonâ€™t close properly. earlier
she was singing, house of the rising sun and lili marlene, both of them several
times, trying to make her voice go throaty and deep; but it came out like a hoarse
childâ€™s. david turned on the radio, he couldnâ€™t get anything, we were between
stations. when she was in the middle of st. louis blues he began to whistle and she
stopped.

em, and
that will be the name of the movie too: random samples. when theyâ€™ve used up their
supply of film (which was all they could afford; and the camera is rented) theyâ€™re
going to look at what theyâ€™ve collected and rearrange it.
â€œhow can you tell what to put in if you donâ€™t already know what itâ€™s about?â€ i
asked david when he was describing it. he gave me one of his initiate-to-novice
stares. â€œif you close your mind in advance like that you wreck it. what you need is
flow.â€ anna, over by the stove measuring out the coffee, said everyone she knew
was making a movie, and david said that was no fucking reason why he shouldnâ€™t.
she said â€œyouâ€™re right, sorryâ€; but she laughs about it behind his back, she calls it
random pimples.
the bottle house is built of pop bottles cemented together with the bottoms facing
out, green ones and brown ones in zig-zag patterns like the ones they taught us in
school to draw on teepees; thereâ€™s a wall around it made of bottles too,

â€œneat,â€ david says, and they get out of the car with the camera. anna and i climb
out after them; we stretch our arms, and anna has a cigarette. sheâ€™s wearing a
purple tunic and white bellbottoms, they have a smear on them already, grease from
the car. i told her she should wear jeans or something but she said she looks fat in
them.
â€œwho made it, christ, think of the work,â€ she says, but i donâ€™t know anything
about it except that itâ€™s been there forever, the tangled black spruce swamp around it
making it even more unlikely, a preposterous monument to some quirkish person
exiled or perhaps a voluntary recluse l

was the only place where he could fulfil his lifelong dream of living in a house of
bottles. inside the wall is an attempted lawn and a border with orange mattress-tuft
marigolds.
â€œgreat,â€ says david, â€œreally neat,â€ and he puts his arm around anna and hugs her
briefly to show heâ€™s pleased, as though she is somehow responsible for the bottle
villa herself. we get back in the car.
i watch the side windows as though itâ€™s a t.v. screen. thereâ€™s nothing i can
remember till we reach the border, marked by the sign that says bienvenu e on one side
and welcome on the other. the sign has bullet holes in it, rusting red around the edges. it

logs are corralled in a boom on the river, a ring of logs chained together with the
free ones nudging each other inside it; they travel to the saws in a clanking overhead
chute, that hasnâ€™t been changed. the car goes under it and weâ€™re curving up into the
tiny company town, neatly planned with public flowerbeds and an eighteenth century
fountain in the middle, stone dolphins and a cherub with part of the face missing. it
looks like an imitation but it may be real.
anna says â€œoh wow, what a great fountain.â€
â€œthe company built the whole thing,â€ i say, and david says â€œrotten capitalist
bastardsâ€ and begins to whistle again.
i tell him to turn right and he does. the road ought to be here, but instead thereâ€™s a
battered chequerboard, the way is blocked.

we didnâ€™t bring a map because i knew we wouldnâ€™t need one. â€œiâ€™ll have to ask,â€ i
say, so he backs the car out and we drive along the main street till we come to a

starts the car. we go through a part thatâ€™s spread out from the town since i was here,
freshly built square bungalows like city ones except for the pink and baby blue trim,
and a few oblong shacks further along, tar-paper and bare boards. a clutch of
children playing in the wet mud that substitutes for lawns; most of them are dressed
in clothes too big for them, which makes them seem stunted.
â€œthey must fuck a lot here,â€ anna says, â€œi guess itâ€™s the church.â€ then she says
â€œarenâ€™t i awful.â€
david says â€œthe true north strong and free.â€
beyond the houses, two older children, darkfaced, hold out tin cans toward the
car. raspberries perhaps.
we come to the gas station where the woman said to turn left and david groans
with joy, â€œoh god look at that,â€ and they pile out as though it will escape if they
arenâ€™t quick enough. what theyâ€™re after is the three stuffed moose on a platform
near the pumps: t

hind legs, a father moose with a trench-coat and a pipe in his mouth, a mother
moose in a print dress and flowered hat and a little boy moose in short pants, a
striped jersey and a baseball cap, waving an american flag.
anna and i follow. i go up behind david and say â€œdonâ€™t you need some gas,â€ he
shouldnâ€™t use the moose without paying, like the washrooms theyâ€™re here to attract
customers.
â€œoh look,â€ anna says, hand going to her mouth, â€œthereâ€™s another one on the
roof,â€ and there is, a little girl moose in a frilly skirt and a pigtailed blonde wig,
holding a red parasol in one hoof. they get her too. the owner of the gas station is
standing behind his plate-glass show-window in his undershirt, scowling at us
through the film of dust.

â€œyou go in and have a beer or something, iâ€™ll be back in about half an hour.â€
â€œright,â€ david says. he knows what to avoid.
â€œwant me to come?â€ joe offers, but when i say no relief gleams through his
beard. the three of them disappear through the screen door of the bar and i walk the
rest of the way down the hill.
i like them, i trust them, i canâ€™t think of anyone else i like better, but right now i
wish they werenâ€™t here. though theyâ€™re necessary: davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s car was the
only way i could make it, thereâ€™s no bus and no train and i never hitch. theyâ€™re
doing me a favour, which they disguised by saying it would be fun, they like to
travel. but my reason for being here embarrasses them, they donâ€™t understand it.
they all disowned their parents long ago, the way you are supposed to: joe never
mentions his mother and father, anna says hers were nothing people and david calls
his the pigs.
there was a covered bridge here once, but it was too far

howling of wolves, muffled by forest and mist, it meant they had taken the right
direction. then there was the pouring noise of the rapids and they saw where they
were, just as the current caught them. they were going backwards, the howling was
the village dogs. if the canoe had tipped over we would have been killed, but they
were calm, they didnâ€™t act like danger; what stayed in my head was only the mist
whiteness, the hush of moving water and the rocking motion, total safety.
anna was right, i had a good childhood; it was in the middle of the war, flecked
grey newsreels i never saw, bombs and concentration camps, the leaders roaring at
the crowds from inside their uniforms, pain and useless death, flags rippling in time
to the anthems. but i didnâ€™t know about that till later, when my brother found out and
told me. at the time it felt like peace.

of himself, the way he says he talked back in the fifties when he wanted to be a
minister and was selling bibles door-to-door to put himself through theological
seminary: â€œhey lady, wanna buy a dirty book?â€ now though it seems to be

adult vegetation; he got the job because he was once a radio announcer.

suitable for framing. leaving my child, that was the unpardonable sin; it was no use
trying to explain to them why it wasnâ€™t really mine. but i admit i was stupid,
stupidity is the same as evil if you judge by the results, and i didnâ€™t have any
excuses, i was never good at them. my brother was, he used to make them up in
advance of the transgressions; thatâ€™s the logical way.
â€œoh god,â€ anna says, â€œdavid thinks heâ€™s a great white hunter.â€ sheâ€™s teasing him,
she does that a lot; but he doesnâ€™t hear, heâ€™s getting up, claude is hustling him off to
make him out a licence, it seems claude is in charge of the licences. when david
comes back i want to ask how much he paid, but heâ€™s too pleased, i donâ€™t want to
spoil it. claude is pleased also.
we find out from claude we can hire evans, who owns the blue moon cabins, to
run us down the lake. paul would take us for nothing,

shoulder as i always did and there is the village, suddenly distanced and clear, the
houses receding and grouping, the white church startling against the dark of the
trees. the feeling i expected before but failed to have comes now, homesickness, for
a place where i never lived, iâ€™m far enough away; then the village shrinks, optical
illusion, and weâ€™re around a point of land, itâ€™s behind us.
the three of us are together on the back seat, anna beside me. â€œthis is good,â€ she
says to me, voice shrilling over the engine roar, â€œitâ€™s good for us to get away from
the cityâ€; but when i turn to answer there are tears on her cheek and i wonder why,
sheâ€™s always so cheerful. then i realize they arenâ€™t tears, itâ€™s started to drizzle. the
raincoats are in our packsacks; i didnâ€™t notice it had clouded over. we wonâ€™t be very
wet though, with this boat it will only take half an hour; before, with the heavier
boats and primitive

foreverâ€ and i thought then, why not? why didnâ€™t you?
i hope the door will be open but itâ€™s padlocked, as paul said he left it. i dig the
keys he gave me out of my bag and approach warily: whatever i find inside will be a
clue. what if he returned after paul locked it and couldnâ€™t get in? but there are other
ways of getting in, he could have broken a window.
joe and david are here now with the other packsacks and the beer. anna is behind
them with my case and the paper bag; sheâ€™s singing again, mockingbird hill.
i open the wooden door and the screen door inside it and scan the room
cautiously, then step inside. table covered with blue oilcloth, bench, another bench
which is a wooden box built against the wall, sofa with metal frame and thin
mattress, it folds out into a bed. that was where our mother used to be: all day she
would lie unmoving, covered with a brown plaid blanket, her face bloodless and
shrunken. we w

nothing is out of place. water drops fall on the roof, down from the trees.
they follow me inside. â€œis this where you lived?â€ joe asks. itâ€™s unusual for him to
ask me anything about myself: i canâ€™t tell whether heâ€™s pleased or discouraged. he
goes over to the snowshoes on the wall and lifts one down, taking refuge in his
hands.
anna puts the groceries on the counter and wraps her arms around herself. â€œit
must have been weird,â€ she says. â€œcut off from everything like that.â€
â€œno,â€ i say. to me it felt normal.
â€œdepends what youâ€™re used to,â€ david says. â€œi think itâ€™s neat.â€ but heâ€™s not certain.
there are two other rooms and i open the doors quickly. a bed in each, shelves,

when i was twelve or thirteen; the fact that iâ€™d forgotten about them is the only thing
that makes me uneasy.
i go back to the livingroom. david has dropped his packsack on the floor and
unfolded himself along the sofa. â€œchrist, am i wiped,â€ he says. â€œsomebody break
me out a beer.â€ anna brings him one and he pats her on the rear and says â€œthatâ€™s
what i like, service.â€ she takes out cans for herself and us and we sit on the benches
and drink it. now that weâ€™re no longer moving the cabin is chilly.
the right smell, cedar and wood stove and tar from the oakum stuffed between
the logs to keep out the mice. i look up at the ceiling, the shelves: thereâ€™s a stack of
papers beside the lamp, perhaps he was working on them just before whatever it was

would do with the power once i got it; if iâ€™d turned out like the others with power i
would have been evil.
i go to the carrot row and pull up a carrot but they havenâ€™t been thinned properly,
itâ€™s forked and stubby. i cut off the onion leaves and the carrot top and throw them
on the compost heap, then put the things in the bowl and start back towards the gate,
adding up the time, growing time, in my head. in the middle of june he was here
surely, it canâ€™t be longer than that.
anna is outside the fence, sheâ€™s come to look for me. â€œwhereâ€™s the can?â€ she
says. â€œiâ€™m about to burst.â€
i take her to the beginning of the trail and point her along it.
â€œare you okay?â€ she says.
â€œsure,â€ i say; the question surprises me.
â€œiâ€™m sorry he wasnâ€™t here,â€ she says mournfully, gazing at me out of her round
green eyes as though itâ€™s her grief, her catastrophe.

yellow. it was my brother who made up these moral distinctions, at some point he
became obsessed with them, he must have picked them up from the war. there had
to be a good kind and a bad kind of everything.
i cook the hamburgers and we eat and i wash the dishes in the chipped dishpan,
anna drying; then itâ€™s almost dark. i lift the bedding out from the wall bench and
make up our bed, anna can do theirs. he must have been sleeping in the main room,
on the sofa.
they arenâ€™t used to going to bed as soon as itâ€™s dark though, and neither am i any
more. iâ€™m afraid theyâ€™ll be bored because thereâ€™s no t.v. or anything, i search for

blankets. there are a lot of paperbacks on the shelves in the bedro

â€œwe could play bridge,â€ i say, but no one wants to.
after a while david says â€œwell children, time to break out the grass.â€ he opens
his packsack and gropes around inside, and anna says â€œwhat a dumb place to put
them, itâ€™s the first place theyâ€™d look.â€
â€œup your ass,â€ david says, smiling at her, â€œthatâ€™s where theyâ€™d look first, they

â€œsometimes i wonder,â€ anna says.

country what the black man is to the united states. not only that, in new york itâ€™s

through the semi-darkness.

stroking his forehead, i can see her hand moving back and forth. theyâ€™ve been
married nine years, anna told me, they must have got married about the same time i
did; but sheâ€™s older than i am. they must have some special method, formula, some
knowledge i missed out on; or maybe he was the wrong person. i thought it would
happen without my doing anything about it, iâ€™d turn into part of a couple, two people

something more to me. the fact that he doesnâ€™t makes me sad: no one has since my
husband. a divorce is like an amputation, you survive but thereâ€™s less of you.
i lie for a while with my eyes open. this used to be my room; anna and david are
in the one with the map, this one has the pictures. ladies in exotic costumes, sausage
rolls of hair across their foreheads, with puffed red mouths and eyelashes like
toothbrush bristles: when i was ten i believed in glamour, it was a kind of religion
and these were my icons. their arms and legs are constrained in fashion-model
poses, one gloved hand on the hip, one foot stuck out in front. theyâ€™re wearing

about the dream itself; i used to have dreams but i donâ€™t any longer.
â€œthatâ€™s pretty boring,â€ he says. â€œwas that all?â€
i throw back the covers and lower my feet to the floor, a minor ordeal: even in
midsummer here the nights are cold. i get dressed as fast as possible and go out to
start the fire. anna is there, still in her sleeveless nylon nightgown and bare feet,
standing in front of the wavery yellowish mirror. thereâ€™s a zippered case on the
counter in front of her, sheâ€™s putting on makeup. i realize iâ€™ve never seen her
without it before; shorn of the pink cheeks and heightened eyes her face is curiously
battered, a worn dollâ€™s, her artificial face is the natural one. the backs of her arms
have goose pimples.

anna says in a low voice, â€œhe doesnâ€™t like to see me without it,â€ and then,
contradicting herself, â€œhe doesnâ€™t know i wear it.â€ i glimpse the subterfuge this
must involve, or is it devotion: does she have to sneak out of the bed before heâ€™s
awake every morning and into it at night with the lights out? maybe david is telling
generous lies; but she blends and mutes herself so well he may not notice.

the wall bench, face still fuzzy with sleep, david examining his chin in the mirror.
â€œi can make you hot water if you want to shave,â€ i suggest, but his reflection grins
and he shakes his head.
â€œnaaa,â€ he says, â€œiâ€™m gonna grow me a little old beard.â€
â€œdonâ€™t you dare,â€ anna says. â€œi donâ€™t like him kissing me when he has a beard, it
reminds me of a cunt.â€ her hand goes over her mouth as though she is shocked.
â€œisnâ€™t that awful?â€
â€œfilthy talk, woman,â€ david says, â€œsheâ€™s uncultured and vulgar.â€
â€œoh i know, iâ€™ve always been like that.â€
itâ€™s a quick skit, joe and i are the audience, but joe is still off in the place inside
himself where he spends most of his time and iâ€™m at the stove turning the bacon, i

coin profile; that was when everything he did was perfect. on his hand is a leather
glove. he said he loved me, the magic word, it was supposed to make everything
light up, iâ€™ll never trust that word again.
my bitterness about him surprises me: i was whatâ€™s known as the offending party,
the one who left, he didnâ€™t do anything to me. he wanted a child, thatâ€™s normal, he
wanted us to be married.
in the morning while we were doing the dishes i decided to ask anna. she was
wiping a plate, humming snatches of the big rock candy mountain under her
breath. â€œhow do you manage it?â€ i said.
she stopped humming. â€œmanage what?â€
â€œbeing married. how do you keep it together?â€
she glanced at me quickly as though she was suspicious. â€œwe tell a lot of jokes.â€
â€œno but really,â€ i said. if there was a secret trick i wanted to learn it.
she talked to me then, or not to me exactly but to an invisible microphone
suspended above her head: peopleâ€™s voice

failed, because i didnâ€™t know what i had to let go of. for me it hadnâ€™t been like
skiing, it was more like jumping off a cliff. that was the feeling i had all the time i
was married; in the air, going down, waiting for the smash at the bottom.
â€œhow come it didnâ€™t work out, with you?â€ anna said.
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ i said, â€œi guess i was too young.â€
she nodded sympathetically. â€œyouâ€™re lucky you didnâ€™t have kids though.â€

bullrushes, blueflags, ooze. i go slowly, looking for footprints. thereâ€™s nothing but
a deer track, no sign of anyone: apparently paul and the searchers didnâ€™t make it this
far. the mosquitoes have scented us and swarm around our heads; joe swears
gently, david loudly, at the end of the line i hear anna slapping.
we swing away from the shore and here itâ€™s a jungle, branches growing in across
the path, hazel and moose maple, pithy junk trees. sight is blocked two feet in,
trunks and leaves a solid interlocking fence, green, green-grey, greybrown. none of

or there are too many signs, since iâ€™m anxious every opening between two trees
looks like a path.
david prods at the dead trunk with the machete, poking holes in the bark. joe sits
down on the ground: heâ€™s breathing hard, too much city, and the flies are getting to
him, he scratches his neck and the backs of his hands. â€œi guess thatâ€™s it,â€ i say
because i have to be the one to confess defeat, and anna says â€œthank god, theyâ€™re
eating me alive.â€
we start back. he could still be in there somewhere but i see now the impossibility
of searching the island for him, itâ€™s two miles long. it would take twenty or thirty
men at least, strung out at intervals and walking straight through the forest, and even
then they could miss him, dead or alive, accident or suicide or murder. or if for
some unfathomable reason heâ€™s chosen this absence and is hiding, theyâ€™d never find
him: there would be no

the others are trying to amuse themselves. joe and david are out in one of the
canoes; i should have made them take life-jackets, neither of them can steer, theyâ€™re
shifting their paddles from side to side. i can see them from the front window and
from the side window i can see anna, partly hidden by trees. sheâ€™s lying on her
belly in bikini and sunglasses, reading a murder mystery, though she must be cold:
the sky has cleared a little, but when the clouds move in front of the sun the heat
shuts off.
except for the bikini and the colour of her hair she could be me at sixteen,
sulking on the dock, resentful at being away from the city and the boyfriend iâ€™d
proved my normality by obtaining; i wore his ring, too big for any of my fingers,
around my neck on a chain, like a

purity.
i crumple up my third princess, dump the paint water into the slop pail and clean
the brushes. i survey from the windows: david and joe are still out on the lake but
they seem to be heading back now. anna is halfway up the hillside stairs, towel over
her arm. i see her for a moment faceted by the screen door and then sheâ€™s inside.
â€œhi,â€ she says, â€œget anything done?â€
â€œnot much,â€ i say.
she comes over to the table and smooths out my botched princesses. â€œthatâ€™s
good,â€ she says without conviction.
â€œthose are mistakes,â€ i say.
â€œoh.â€ she turns the sheets over, face down. â€œdid you believe that stuff when you

these unintelligible drawings. i sit at the table, my heart speeded up as if iâ€™ve opened
what i thought was an empty closet and found myself face to face with a thing that
isnâ€™t supposed to be there, like a claw or a bone. this is the forgotten possibility: he
might have gone insane. crazy, loony. bushed, the trappers call it when you stay in
the forest by yourself too long. and if insane, perhaps not dead: none of the rules
would be the same.
anna walks out of the bedroom, dressed in jeans and shirt again. she combs her
hair in front of the mirror, light ends, dark roots, humming to herself, you are my
sunshine; smoke twines up from her cigarette. help, i think at her silently, talk. and
she does.
â€œwhatâ€™s for dinner?â€ she says; then, waving, â€œhere they come.â€

keeping it on with a rubber band. my mother was a saver: rubber bands, string,
safety pins, jam jars, for her the depression never ended.
david is fitting the sections of his borrowed fishing rod together; itâ€™s fibreglass, i
have no faith in it. i take the steel trolling rod from its hooks on the wall. â€œcome
on,â€ i tell david, â€œyou can use that one for still-fishing.â€
â€œshow me how to light the lamp,â€ anna says, â€œiâ€™ll stay here and read.â€
i donâ€™t want to leave her alone. what iâ€™m afraid of is my father, hidden on the
island somewhere and attracted by the light perhaps, looming up at the window like
a huge ragged moth; or, if heâ€™s still at all lucid, asking her who she is and ordering
her out of his house. as long as there are four of us heâ€™ll keep away, he never liked
groups.

legs tangled in amongst annaâ€™s. before i push off i clip a silver and gold spinner
with glass ruby eyes to davidâ€™s line and hook a worm on, looping its body
seductively. both ends twirl.

second and then give it a sharp tug, okay?â€
â€œright,â€ he says.
my arms are tired. behind me i can hear the tick tock of the frog hopping up and
hitting its muzzle against the jar lid.
when weâ€™re getting near the sheer cliff i tell him to reel in, weâ€™ll still-fish and he
can use his own rod.
â€œlie down, anna,â€ he says, â€œiâ€™m gonna use my own rod.â€
anna says â€œoh christ, you have to do that about everything, donâ€™t you?â€
he chuckles at her and reels and the line comes in, the water slipping off it; the
pale gleam of the spoon wavers up out of the lake. when it skips over the surface
towards us i can see the worm is gone. on one hook is a shred of worm skin; i used
to wonder how the lures with their crude african-idol eyes could deceive the fish,
but perhaps theyâ€™ve learned.

put a lead sinker and a different spoon and a fresh worm on davidâ€™s line and toss it
over; the worm drops, pink, pink-brown, till it disappears in the shadow of the cliff.
the dark torpedo shapes of the fish are seeing it, sniffing at it, prodding it with their
noses. i believe in them the way other people believe in god: i canâ€™t see them but i
know they are there.

light fading, silence; back in the forest, liquid spiral thrush voice, they call at
sunset. davidâ€™s arm moves up and down.
when nothing happens i tell him to reel in; the worm is gone again. i take out the
little frog, the ultimate solution, and hook it on securely while it squeaks. other
people always did that for me.
â€œgod youâ€™re cold-blooded,â€ anna says. the frog goes down through the water,
kicking like a man swimming.

hangs in the air like a framed photo over a bar only moving. it dives and pulls, the
line slackens, itâ€™s doubling back trying to shake loose; but when it jumps again

a dumb move, he couldâ€™ve lost it, on top of a

canoe ribs, flippering and snapping.
â€œhere,â€ i say, â€œhit it back of the eyes.â€ i reach him the sheathed knife, iâ€™d rather
not kill it myself.
david swipes at it, misses; anna cover her eyes and says â€œugh. ugh.â€ it flops
towards me and i step down on it with my foot and grab the knife and whack it
quickly with the knife handle, crushing the skull, and it trembles stiffly all over,
thatâ€™s done it.
â€œwhat is it?â€ david asks, amazed by what heâ€™s caught but proud too. they are all
laughing, joyful with victory and relief, like the newsreels of parades at the end of
the war, and that makes me glad. their voices bounce off the cliff.

plates. that was before the house was built, we were living outside in tents. our
father said they went in cycles.

anna, â€œitâ€™s slimy, iâ€™m not going to eat any of it.â€ joe grunts, i wonder if heâ€™s
jealous.
david wants to try for another; itâ€™s like gambling, you only stop if you lose. i
donâ€™t remind him i have no more magic frogs; i get out a worm for him and let him
hook it on himself.
he fishes for a while but heâ€™s having no luck. just as annaâ€™s beginning to fidget

thatâ€™s what he explores, for one of the big international companies, a prospector; but
i canâ€™t believe in that, nothing heâ€™s done since we grew up is real to me.

week, itâ€™d be great.â€
â€œdonâ€™t you have that seminar?â€ anna says dubiously. â€œman and his electricity

â€œelectrifying. thatâ€™s not till august.â€
â€œi donâ€™t think we should,â€ anna says.
â€œhow come you never want us to do anything i want to do?â€ david says, and
thereâ€™s a pause. then he says â€œwhat dâ€™you think?â€ and joe says â€œokay by me.â€

know i have it with me. i could leave by myself with evans but iâ€™d only get as far as
the village: itâ€™s davidâ€™s car, iâ€™d have to steal the keys, and also, i remind myself, i
never learned to drive.
anna makes a last feeble attempt. â€œiâ€™ll run out of cigarettes.â€
â€œdo you good,â€ david says cheerfully, â€œfilthy habit. get you back into shape.â€
heâ€™s older than we are, heâ€™s over thirty, heâ€™s beginning to worry about that; every
now and then he hits himself in the stomach and says â€œflab.â€
â€œiâ€™ll get crabby,â€ anna says, but david only laughs and says â€œtry it.â€

afraid they might chop their feet; though that would be a way out, i thought, weâ€™d
have to go back. but i didnâ€™t need to warn them, about him, they had weapons. he
would see that and run away.
when theyâ€™d disappeared along the trail into the forest i said i was going down to
weed the garden, another job that had to be done. i wanted to keep busy, preserve at
least the signs of order, conceal my fear, both from others and from him. fear has a
smell, as love does.
anna could tell she was expected to help; she abandoned her murder mystery and
stubbed out her cigarette, only half-smoked, she was rationing them. we tied scarves
around our heads and i went to the toolshed for the rake.
the garden was full in sunlight and steaming hot, moist as a greenhouse. we knelt
down and began to pull at the weeds; they resisted, holding on or taking clumps of
soil out with them or breaking their stems, leaving their roots in the earth to
regenerate; i dug for the feet in the

that was the picture i kept, my mother seen from the back, arms upraised as
though she was flying, and the bear terrified. when she told the story later she said
sheâ€™d been scared to death but i couldnâ€™t believe that, she had been so positive,
assured, as if she knew a foolproof magic formula: gesture and word. she was
wearing her leather jacket.
â€œyou on the pill?â€ anna asked suddenly.
i looked at her, startled. it took me a minute, why did she want to know? that was
what they used to call a personal question.
â€œnot any more,â€ i said.
â€œme neither,â€ she said glumly. â€œi donâ€™t know anyone who still is any more. i got a
blood clot in my leg, what did you get?â€ she had a smear of mud across her cheek,
her pink face layer was softening in the heat, like tar.

to take a taxi.
from the forest behind us came the sound of sporadic chopping: a few blows, the
echoes, a pause, a few more blows, one of them laughing, echo of the laughter. it
was my brother who cut the trail, the year before he left, the axe hacking and the
machete slashing through the undergrowth marking his progress as he worked his
way around the shore.
â€œhavenâ€™t we done enough?â€ anna asked. â€œi bet iâ€™m getting sunstroke.â€ she sat
back on her heels and took out the un-smoked half of her cigarette. i think she
wanted us to exchange more confidences, she wanted to talk about her other
diseases, but i kept on weeding. potatoes, onions; the strawberry patch was a
hopeless jungle, we wouldnâ€™t do that; in any case the season was over.
david and joe appeared in the long grass outside the fence, one at either end of a
thinnish log. they were proud, theyâ€™d caught something. 
 
 ___________________________
 
the log was notched in
many places as though theyâ€™d attacked it.
â€œhi,â€ david called. â€œhowâ€™s the olâ€™ plantation workers?â€
anna stood up. â€œfuck off,â€ she said, squinting at them against the sun.
â€œyouâ€™ve hardly done anything,â€ david said, unquenchable, â€œyou call that a
garden?â€
i measured their axework with my fatherâ€™s summarizing eye. in the city he would
shake hands with them, estimating them shrewdly: could they handle an axe, what
did they know about manure? they would stand there embarrassed in their washed
suburban skins and highschool clothes, uncertain what was expected of them.
â€œthatâ€™s great,

element of chance, like a painter throwing paint
at a canvas, it would be organic. but joe said what if we wrecked the camera, who
would pay for it. in the end they stuck the axe in the log, after several tries, and took
turns shooting each other standing beside it, arms folded and one foot on it as if it
was a lion or a rhinoceros.
in the evening we played bridge, with the set of slightly greasy cards that had
always been there, blue seahorses on one deck, red seahorses on the other. david
and anna played against us. they won easily: joe didnâ€™t know how, exactly, and i
hadnâ€™t played for years. i was never any good; the only part i liked was picking up
the cards and arranging them.
afterwards i waited for anna to walk up to the outhouse with me; usually i went
first, alone. we took both flashlights; they made protective circles of weak yellow
light, moving with our feet as they walked. rustlings, toads in the dry leaves; once
the quick warning thump of a rabbit. the sounds would be saf

what they were.
â€œi wish i had a warmer sweater,â€ anna said, â€œi didnâ€™t know it got so cold.â€
â€œthereâ€™s some raincoats,â€ i said, â€œyou could try those.â€
when we got back to the cabin the other two were in bed; they didnâ€™t bother going
as far as the outhouse after dark, they peed on the ground. i brushed my teeth; anna
started taking off her makeup by the light of a candle and her flashlight propped on
end, theyâ€™d blown out the lamp.
i went into my room and got undressed. joe mumbled, he was half asleep; i curled
my arm over him.
outside was the wind, trees moving in it, nothing else. the yellow target from
annaâ€™s flashlight was on the ceiling; it shifted, she was going into their room and i
could hear them, anna breathing, a fast panic sound as though she was running; then
her voice began, not like her r

them from knowledge. they might start to explore, cut other trails;
already they were beginning to be restless: fire and food, the only two necessities,
were taken care of and there was nothing left to be done. sun rising, drifting across
the sky, shadows changing without help, uninterrupted air, absence of defining
borders, the only break an occasional distant plane, vapour streak, for them it must
have been like living in a hammock.
in the morning david fished from the dock, catching nothing; anna read, she was
on her fourth or fifth paperback. i swept the floor, the broom webbing itself with
long threads, dark and light, from where anna and i brushed our hair in front of the
mirror; then i tried to work. joe stayed on the wall bench, arms wrapped around his
knees in lawn-dwarf position, watching me. every time i glanced up his eyes would
be there, blue as ball point pens or superman; even with my head turned away i
could feel his x-ray vision prying under my skin, a slight prickling sen

after lunch they all sat around expectantly, as though waiting for me to dole out
the crayons and plasticine or regiment the sing-song, tell them what to play. i
searched through the past: what did we do when it was sunny and there was no
work?
â€œhow would you like,â€ i said, â€œto pick some blueberries?â€ offering it as a
surprise; work disguised in some other form, it had to be a game.
they seized on it, glad of the novelty. â€œa groove,â€ david said. anna and i made
peanut butter sandwiches for a mid-afternoon snack; then we basted our noses and
the lobes of our ears with annaâ€™s suntan lotion and started out.
david and anna went in the green canoe, we took the heavier one. they still
couldnâ€™t paddle very well but there wasnâ€™t much wind. i had to use a lot of energy
just to keep us pointed straight, because joe didnâ€™t know how to steer; also he
wouldnâ€™t admit it, which made it harder.
we wavered around the stone point where the trail go

â€œbut it wouldnâ€™t make any difference,â€ i said. â€œeverything would be the same.â€
â€œthen why not do it?â€ he had moved closer, he was being logical, he was
threatening me with something. i swivelled, scouting for help, but they were at the
far end of the island, annaâ€™s pink shirt tiny and blazing like a gas station banner.
â€œno,â€ i said, the only answer to logic. it was because i didnâ€™t want to, thatâ€™s why it
would gratify him, it would be a sacrifice, of my reluctance, my distaste.

his back half-turned to us, scraping together a large mound of sand. heâ€™d finished
his pie, the rest of us were still eating. it was too hot to eat in the house, we had to
keep the stove going for two hours. they had purple mouths and blue teeth which
showed when they talked or laughed.
â€œthatâ€™s the best pie i ever ate,â€ david said. â€œjust like mother used to make.â€ he
smacked his lips and posed, pretending to be a t.v. ad.

davidâ€™s purple mouth grinned. â€œaw,â€ he said, â€œthat was a compliment.â€

david sighed and leaned back against his tree, rolling his eyes to joe for
sympathy. but he got none and so he gazed up at the sky instead. â€œthis is the life,â€ he
said after a while. â€œwe ought to start a colony, i mean a community up here, get it

of his foot thoughtfully.
â€œi think it would be a copout,â€ anna said abruptly.
â€œwhat would?â€ david said, overly tolerant, as though sheâ€™d interrupted him in
mid-sentence. â€œkicking out the pigs?â€
â€œoh shit,â€ anna said, â€œyou just wonâ€™t.â€
â€œwhat the hell are you talking about?â€ he said, feigning hurt. but she sat hugging
her knees, smoke breathing through her nostrils. i got up and started to collect the

them all so i went into davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s room with a candle to look for more.
i had to climb up on the bed to reach the shelf. there was a high pile of books; i
lifted it down to where the candle was. on top was a layer of paperbacks, the
average kind, but underneath them were some things that were out of place: the

the wall and thought of maxims: two can play that game, marry in haste, repent at
leisure, least said soonest mended, traditional wisdom which was never any help.
at breakfast he ignored me and the others too, hunching over his plate, mumbling
replies.
â€œwhatâ€™s with him?â€ david said. his new beard was sprouting, a brown smudge on
his chin.
â€œshut up,â€ anna said; but she glanced at me, inquisitive, holding me responsible
for it whatever it was.
joe wiped his sweat shirt sleeve across his mouth and went out of the house,
letting the screen door slam behind him.
â€œmaybe heâ€™s constipated,â€ david said, â€œit makes them grouchy. you sure heâ€™s
been getting enough exercise?â€ then he went â€œarf, arfâ€ like popeye, wiggling his
ears.
â€œstupid,â€ anna said fondly; she rumpled his hair.
â€œhey, donâ€™t do that,â€ he said, â€œitâ€™ll all fall ou

â€œbullshit,â€ david said, â€œhe was a front man for the c.i.a.â€
i laughed. â€œno,â€ i said; i showed him the teenie town card.
but david was serious. â€œyou havenâ€™t seen them in operation the way i have,â€ he
said darkly, invoking his new york past.
â€œwhat would they want up here?â€ i said.
â€œa snooping base,â€ he said, â€œbird-watchers, binoculars, it all fits. they know this
is the kind of place that will be strategically important during the war.â€
â€œwhat war?â€ i asked, and anna said â€œhere we go.â€
â€œitâ€™s obvious. theyâ€™re running out of water, clean water, theyâ€™re dirtying up all of
theirs, right? which is what we have a lot of, this country is almost all water if you
look at a map. so in a while, i give it ten years, theyâ€™ll be up against the wall. theyâ€™ll
try to swing a deal with the government, get us to give them the water cheap or for
nothing in exchange for more soapflakes or something, and the government will
give in, theyâ€™ll be a bunch of puppet

drew ornaments, plants with scrolled branches, hearts and stars instead of flowers. i
got so i could draw invisibly, my fingers scarcely moving.
the generals and the historic moments looked better framed. if you put your eye
down close to the photograph they disintegrated into grey dots.
anna was squeezed in beside david on the bench, playing with one of his hands
while he talked. â€œdid i ever tell you that you have murdererâ€™s thumb?â€ she said.
â€œdonâ€™t interrupt,â€ he said, but when she made a whimpering face he said â€œyep,
you did, almost every day,â€ and patted her arm.
â€œitâ€™s spread flat at the end,â€ she said, explaining to us.

one of the schmuckiest people i know.â€
i looked around at her: her voice was like fingernails, iâ€™d never heard her talk that
way about david.
â€œwhy?â€ i said. â€œwhatâ€™s wrong?â€ he hadnâ€™t said anything at lunch that could have
upset her.
â€œi guess you think heâ€™s hot for you.â€ her mouth stretched down tight with the lips
inside, a toadâ€™s.
â€œno,â€ i said, bewildered, â€œwhy would i think that?â€
â€œthose things he says, you know, like about

â€œi thought he was teasing.â€ i had thought that too, it was just a habit like picking

â€œteasing, shit. he was doing it to me. he always does stuff like that to other
women in front of me, heâ€™d screw them with me in the room if he could. instead he
screws them somewhere else and tells me about it afterwards.â€
â€œoh,â€ i said. i hadnâ€™t deduced that. â€œwhy? i mean, why does he tell you?â€
anna brooded, her dishtowel slack. â€œhe says itâ€™s being honest. what a turd. when
i get mad he says iâ€™m jealous and possessive and i shouldnâ€™t get uptight, he says
jealousy is bourgeois, itâ€™s a leftover from the property ethic, he thinks we should all
be swingers and share it around. but i say there are these basic emotions, if you feel
something you should let it out, right?â€ it was an article of faith, she glared at me,

the slop pail was full; i carried it to the garden to pour the dirty water into the
trench. joe was lying by himself on the dock, face down; when i came to rinse the
pail he didnâ€™t move. anna passed me on the steps, wearing her orange bikini, oiled
for her sun ritual.
in the cabin i set the pail under the counter. david was pondering his chin bristles
in the mirror; he slid his arm half around me and said in a guttural voice, â€œcome

â€œnot right now,â€ i said, â€œi have to do some work.â€

pointed out, they stay under.
the numbers were a system, a game; i would play it with him, it would make him
seem less dead. i lined up the pages and compared the notes, carefully as a jeweller.
on one of the drawings, another antlered figure, i finally spotted the key: a name i
recognized, white birch lake where we went bass fishing, it was connected to the
main lake by a portage. i went into davidâ€™s and annaâ€™s room where the map of the
district was tacked to the wall. marked on a point of land was a tiny red x and a
number, identical with the number on the drawing. the printed name was different,
lac des verges blanches, the government had been translating all the english names
into french ones, though the indian names remained the same. scattered here and
there were other xs, like a treasure map.
i wanted to go there and verify, match the drawing with reality; that way iâ€™d be
sure iâ€™d follow

ed the rules and done it right. i could disguise it as a fishing trip,
david hadnâ€™t caught anything since his first attempt, though heâ€™d been trying. weâ€™d
have time to go there and get back with two days to spare.
i heard annaâ€™s voice approaching, singing, the words trailing off as her breath
gave out climbing the steps. i went back to the main room.
â€œhi,â€ she said, â€œdo i look burnt?â€
she was pink now, parboiled, white showing around the orange edges of her suit,
neck dividing body colour from applied face colour. â€œa little,â€ i said.
â€œlisten,â€ she said, her voice shifting into concern, â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with joe? i was
down on the dock with him and he didnâ€™t say one word.â€
â€œhe doesnâ€™t talk m

 a sense of touch; but if that was true i wouldnâ€™t have noticed the absence. at
some point my neck must have closed over, pond freezing or a wound, shutting me
into my head; since then everything had been glancing off me, it was like being in a
vase, or the village where i could see them but not hear them because i couldnâ€™t
understand what was being said. bottles distort for the observer too: frogs in the jam
jar stretched wide, to them watching i must have appeared grotesque.
â€œthanks,â€ anna said, â€œi hope i wonâ€™t peel. i think you should go talk to him, or
something.â€
â€œi have,â€ i said; but her eyes were accusing, i hadnâ€™t done enough, conciliation,
expiation. i went obediently towards the door.
â€œmaybe you can work it out,â€ she called after me.
joe was still on the dock but he was sitting on the edge now with his feet in the
water, i crouched down beside him. his toes had dark hairs on the tops, spaced like
the needles on a balsam twig.
â€œwhat is it?â€ i said. â€œa

â€œiâ€™m trying to tell the truth,â€ i said. the voice wasnâ€™t mine, it came from someone
dressed as me, imitating me.
â€œthe truth is,â€ he said bitterly, â€œyou think my work is crap, you think iâ€™m a loser
and iâ€™m not worth it.â€ his face contorted, it was pain: i envied him.
â€œno,â€ i said, but i couldnâ€™t say it right and he needed more than that.
â€œcome up to the cabin,â€ i said; anna was there, she would help. â€œiâ€™ll make some
tea.â€ i got up but he wouldnâ€™t follow.
while the stove was heating i took the leather album from the shelf in their room
and opened it on the table, where anna was reading. it was no longer his death but
my own that concerned me; perhaps i would be able to tell when the change
occurred by the differences in my former faces, alive up to a year, a day, then
frozen. the duchess at the french court before the revolution, who stopped

turning the other way. further on, glossy colour prints, forgotten boys with pimples
and carnations, myself in the stiff dresses, crinolines and tulle, layered like store
birthday cakes; i was civilized at last, the finished product. she would say â€œyou look
very nice, dear,â€ as though she believed it; but i wasnâ€™t convinced, i knew by then
she was no judge of the normal.
â€œis that you?â€ anna said, putting down the mystery at sturbridge. â€œchrist, how
could we ever wear that stuff?â€
the last pages of the album were blank, with some loose prints stuck in between
the black leaves as though my mother hadnâ€™t wanted to finish. after the formal
dresses i disappeared; no wedding pictures, but of course we hadnâ€™t taken any. i

already, on the shore ledge of bare granite; trash was strewn around it, orange
peelings and tin cans and a rancid bulge of greasy paper, the tracks of humans. it
was like dogs pissing on a fence, as if the endlessness, anonymous water and
unclaimed land, compelled them to leave their signature, stake their territory, and
garbage was the only thing they had to do it with. i picked up the pieces of clutter
and piled them to one side, i would burn them afterwards.
â€œthatâ€™s disgusting,â€ anna said. â€œhow can you touch it?â€
â€œitâ€™s the sign of a free country,â€ david said. â€œgermany under hitler was very
tidy.â€
we didnâ€™t need to use the axe, the island was covered with dry sticks, branches
discarded from trees. i boiled the water and made tea and we had chicken noodle
soup, out of a package, and sardines and tinned applesauce.
we sat in the shade, white smoke and the smell of scorching orange peels
wrapping over us when the wind swerved. i hooked the billy tin off the fire

thought we were yanks insulting their queen. but i said she was our queen too so
we had the right, and they ended up buying us a drink.â€
â€œi think it would be more fair,â€ anna said, â€œif you did it, â€˜ladies and gentlemen,
up the queen and the duke.â€™ â€œ
â€œnone of that womenâ€™s lib,â€ david said, his eyes lidding, â€œor youâ€™ll be out on

get off on that, theyâ€™re roving the streets in savage bands armed with garden

superior.â€ but when joe only grunted he said â€œyou should wire him for sound. or
fix him up with a plug and a shade, heâ€™d make a great end-table lamp. iâ€™m having
him give a guest lecture in adult vegetation next year, â€˜how pots communicate,â€™
heâ€™ll walk in and say nothing for two hours, thatâ€™ll freak them.â€ joe smiled at last

with tiny wounds, like an addictâ€™s. they slipped the needle into the vein and i was
falling down, it was like diving, sinking from one layer of darkness to a deeper,
deepest; when i rose up through the anaesthetic, pale green and then daylight, i could
remember nothing.
â€œdonâ€™t bother him,â€ anna said.
â€œor maybe iâ€™ll make it a short course this time,â€ david said. â€œfor the
businessmen how to open the playboy centrefold with the left hand only, keeping the
right free for action, for the housewives how to switch on the t.v. and switch off
their heads, thatâ€™s all they need to know, then we can go home.â€

and women, the skins bald as inner tubes. in a way it was a relief, to be exempt from
feeling.
â€œthe trouble with you is you hate women,â€ anna said savagely; she threw the rest
of her tea and the tealeaves out of her tin cup into the lake, they hit with a splat.
david grinned. â€œthatâ€™s what they call a delayed reaction,â€ he said. â€œgoose anna

going past on their way to the village, their boat sloshing up and down in the waves,
spray pluming, flags cocked fore and aft. they couldnâ€™t hear him because of the
wind and the motor, they thought he was greeting, they waved and smiled.

the landing place at the portage was clogged with driftwood, sodden and mossgrown.
we pushed in among the slippery logs as far as we could, then clambered
out and waded, dragging the canoes up over, soaking our shoes. it was bad for the
canoes, it scraped the keels. there were other paint marks, recent.
we unloaded the canoes and i knotted the paddles into position across the thwarts.
they said they would take the tents and the canoes and anna and i could take the
packs and the leftovers, the fishing rods and the tackle box with the jar of frogs iâ€™d
caught that morning, the movie equipment. david had insisted on it, though i warned
him we might tip.
â€œwe have to use up the film,â€ he said, â€œweâ€™ve only got it rented for another
week.â€
anna said â€œbut there wonâ€™t be anything you want,â€ and david said â€œhow do you

new anomaly for their collection.
â€œwow,â€ david said, â€œis there? neat,â€ and anna said â€œfor godâ€™s sake donâ€™t
encourage him.â€
neither of them had portaged before; we had to help them lift and balance the
canoes. i said maybe they should double up, both of them under one canoe, but
david insisted they could do it the real way. i said they should be careful; if the
canoe slipped sideways and you didnâ€™t get out in time it would break your neck.

the packs were heavy, food for three days in case the weather turned bad and
marooned us; the straps cut into my shoulders, i leaned forward against the weight,
feet squishing in the wet shoes as i walked.
the portage was up over a steep ridge of rock, watershed, then down through
ferns and saplings to an oblong pond, a shallow mud-hole weâ€™d have to paddle
across to reach the second portage. anna and i got there first and set down the
packs; anna had time to smoke half a cigarette before david and joe came
staggering down the trail, bumping into the sides like blinkered horses. we held the
canoes and they crouched out from under, they were pink and breathless.
â€œbetter be fish in there,â€ david said, sleeving off his forehead.
â€œthe next oneâ€™s shorter,â€ i told them.

colour of the tree. i got out and stood holding the canoe steady while joe climbed
forward.
it was behind me, i smelled it before i saw it; then i heard the flies. the smell was
like decaying fish. i turned around and it was hanging upside down by a thin blue
nylon rope tied round its feet and looped over a tree branch, its wings fallen open. it
looked at me with its mashed eye.

â€œheavy,â€ david said. â€œwhat is it?â€
â€œa dead bird,â€ anna said. she held her nose with two fingers.
i said â€œitâ€™s a heron. you canâ€™t eat them.â€ i couldnâ€™t tell how it had been done,
bullet, smashed with a stone, hit with a stick. this would be a good place for herons,
they would come to fish in the shallow water, standing on one leg and striking with
the long spear bill. they must have got it before it had time to rise.
â€œwe need that,â€ david said, â€œwe can put it next to the fish guts.â€

waited, sitting on the packs.
i saw a beetle on it, blueblack and oval; when the camera whirred it burrowed in
under the feathers. carrion beetle, death beetle. why had they strung it up like a
lynch victim, why didnâ€™t they just throw it away like the trash? to prove they could
do it, they had the power to kill. otherwise it was valueless: beautiful from a
distance but it couldnâ€™t be tamed or cooked or trained to talk, the only relation they
could have to a thing like that was to dest

that time i was afraid there was a machine that could make people vanish like that
too, go nowhere, like a camera that could steal not only your soul but your body
also. levers and buttons, triggers, the machines sent them up as roots sent up
flowers; tiny circles and oblongs, logic become visible, you couldnâ€™t tell in advance
what would happen if you pressed them.
i showed the three of them where i had dug the hole. â€œwhere do you sit?â€ anna
asked, squeamish.
â€œon the ground,â€ david said, â€œgood for you, toughen you up. you could use an
ass job.â€ anna poked him on the belt buckle and said â€œflab,â€ imitating him.
i opened more tins and heated them, baked beans and peas, and we ate them with
smokey tea. from the rock where i washed the dishes i could see part of a tent, in
among the cedars at the distant end of the lake: their bunker. binoculars trained on
me, i could feel the eye rays, cross of the rifle sight on my forehea

david was impatient, he wanted his moneyâ€™s worth, what heâ€™d come for. anna
said sheâ€™d stay at the campsite: fishing didnâ€™t interest her. we left her the insect spray
and the three of us got into the green canoe with the fishing rods. i put the frog jar in
the stern where i could reach it. david was facing me this time; joe sat in the bow, he
was going to fish too, though he didnâ€™t have a licence.
the wind had dwindled, the lake was pink and orange. we went along the shore,
birches cool, overhanging us, ice pillars. i was dizzy, too much water and sun glare,

senseless killing, it was a game; after the war theyâ€™d been bored.
the sunset was fading, at the other side of the sky the black was coming up. we
took the fish back, four of them by now, and i cut a y-shaped sapling stringer to go
through the gills.
â€œpoo,â€ anna said to us, â€œyou smell like a fish market.â€
david said â€œwish we had some beer. maybe we could get some off the yanks,
theyâ€™re the type.â€
i went down to the lake with the bar of soap to wash the fish blood off my hands.
anna followed me.
â€œgod,â€ she said, â€œwhatâ€™m i going to do? i forgot my makeup, heâ€™ll kill me.â€
i studied her: in the twilight her face was grey. â€œmaybe he wonâ€™t notice,â€ i said.

â€œmaybe you should leave,â€ i said, offering my solution, â€œor get a divorce.â€

started to really love him and he canâ€™t stand that, he canâ€™t stand having me love him.

brought it because she didnâ€™t have a heavy sweater. with annaâ€™s head attached to it it
was incongruous, diminished. i tried to think about my mother but she was blanked
out; the only thing that remained was a story she once told about how, when she was
little, she and her sister had made wings for themselves out of an old umbrella;
theyâ€™d jumped off the barn roof, attempting to fly, and she broke both her ankles.
she would laugh about it but the story seemed to me then chilly and sad, the failure
unbearable.
â€œsometimes i think heâ€™d like me to die,

we walked back and i built up the fire and mixed some cocoa, using powdered

coals underneath pulsing red when the night breeze hit them. we sat on the
groundsheets, david with his arm around anna, joe and i a foot apart.
â€œthis reminds me of girl guides,â€ anna said in the cheerful voice i once thought
was hers. she began to sing, the notes hesitant, quavering:
thereâ€™ll be bluebirds over
the white cliffs of dover
tomorrow, when the worldis free. â€¦
the words went out towards the shadows, smoke-thin, evaporating. across the lake
a barred owl was calling, quick and soft like a wing beating against the eardrum,
cutting across the pattern of her voice, negating her. she glanced behind her: she felt
it.

david said â€œwell, goodnight children,â€ and he and anna went into their tent. the
tent lit up from inside for a moment, flashlight, then went out.

â€œin a minute.â€ i wanted to give him time to go to sleep.
i sat in the dark, the stroking sound of the night lake surrounding me. in the
distance the americansâ€™ campfire glowed, a dull red cyclops eye: the enemy lines. i
wished evil towards them: let them suffer, i prayed, tip their canoe, burn them, rip
them open. owl: answer, no answer.
i crawled into the tent through the mo

went down to the lake and dipped my face into it. this water was not
clear like the water in the main lake: it was brownish, complicated by more kinds of
life crowded more closely together, and it was colder. the rock ledge dropped
straight down, lake of the edge. i woke the others.
after iâ€™d cleaned the fish i dipped them in flour and fried them and boiled coffee.
the fish flesh was white, blue-veined; it tasted like underwater and reeds. they ate,
not talking much; they hadnâ€™t slept well.
annaâ€™s face in the daylight was dried and slightly shrivelled without its cream
underfilm and pink highlights; her nose was sunburned and she had prune crinkles
under her eyes. she kept turned away from david, but he didnâ€™t seem to notice, he
didnâ€™t say anything, except when she knocked her foot against his cup and tipped
some of his coffee out onto the ground. then all he said was â€œwatch it anna, youâ€™re
getting sloppy.â€

withdrew his hand.
â€œoh that,â€ he said with a shrug. â€œiâ€™m a mets fan, have been for years, i always
root for the underdog. bought that when i was down there for the game, the year
they won the pennant.â€ i looked more closely at the sticker: it wasnâ€™t a flag at all, it
was a blue and white oblong with red printing, go mets.
david and anna had caught up with us. â€œyou a mets fan?â€ david said. â€œout of
sight.â€ he slid his canoe in beside theirs and they shook hands.
but theyâ€™d killed the heron anyway. it doesnâ€™t matter what country theyâ€™re from, my
head said, theyâ€™re still americans, theyâ€™re whatâ€™s in store for us, what we are turning
into. they spread themselves like a virus, they get into the brain and take over the

not i could try the next x, near the heron island, and then the next one.
i had my bathing suit on already; weâ€™d been washing the clothes down on the
dock, rubbing them on the ribbed washboard with the worn-down bar of yellow
soap, standing in the lake to rinse them. they were pegged out to dry now on the
line behind the cabin, shirts, jeans, socks, annaâ€™s coloured lingerie, our cast skins.
anna had seemed more relaxed, she hummed from behind her fresh facade of
makeup. she had stayed down by the lake to shampoo the smoke out of her hair. i
pulled on a sweat shirt in case there were americans. before leaving i searched
once more for his camera, the one he must have used to take the photographs, but it
wasnâ€™t there; he must have had it with him. at the time, the last time.
i had started down the steps before i saw them. the three of them wer

e on the
dock, split into parts by the treetrunk bars. anna was kneeling in her orange bikini,
with a towel draped over her head like a nun; david was standing over her, hands on
hips. joe was further back with the movie camera, sitting on the dock with his legs
dangling, head averted as if waiting politely for them to be through. when i heard
what they were saying i stood still. the canoes were there and i needed one of them
but it was too dangerous. it was a calm day, the sound carried.
â€œcome on, take it off,â€ david said; his light-humour voice.

â€œit wonâ€™t hurt you, we need a naked lady.â€
â€œwhat the hell for?â€ anna was peevish now, her veiled head upturned; her eyes
would be squinting.
â€œrandom samples,â€ david said patiently, and i thought, theyâ€™ve used up
everything, thereâ€™s nothing left here now for them to take pictures of except each
other, next it will be me. â€œyouâ€™ll go in beside the dead bird, itâ€™s your chance for
stardom, youâ€™ve always wanted fame. youâ€™ll get to be on educational t.v.â€ he added
as though it was a special bribe.
â€œoh for christâ€™s sake,â€ anna said. she picked

up her murder mystery again and
pretended to read.
â€œcome on, we need a naked lady with big tits and a big ass,â€ david said in the
same tender voice; i recognized that menacing gentleness, at school it always went
before the trick, the punchline.
â€œlook, will you leave me alone?â€ anna said. â€œiâ€™m minding my own business,
mind yours why donâ€™t you.â€ she stood up, her towel sliding off, and tried to get past
him to the land, but he sidestepped in front of her.
â€œi wonâ€™t take her if she doesnâ€™t want to,â€ joe said.
â€œitâ€™s token resistance,â€ david said, â€œshe wants to, sheâ€™s an exhibitionist at heart.
she likes her lush bod, donâ€™t you? even if she is getting too fat.â€
â€œdonâ€™t think i donâ€™t know what youâ€™re trying to do,â€ anna said, as though sheâ

guessed a riddle. â€œyouâ€™re trying to humiliate me.â€
â€œwhatâ€™s humiliating about your body, darling?â€ david said caressingly. â€œwe all
love it, you ashamed of it? thatâ€™s pretty stingy of you, you should share the wealth;
not that you donâ€™t.â€
anna was furious now, goaded, her voice rose. â€œfuck off, you want bloody
everything donâ€™t you, you canâ€™t use that stuff on me.â€
â€œwhy not,â€ david said evenly, â€œit works. now just take it off like a good girl or
iâ€™ll have to take it off for you.â€
â€œleave her alone,â€ joe said, swinging his legs, bored or excited, it was
impossible to tell.
i wanted to run down to the dock and stop them, fighting was wrong, we werenâ€™t
allowed to, if we did both sides got punished as in a real war.

 so we battled in secret,
undeclared, and after a while i no longer fought back because i never won. the only
defence was flight, invisibility. i sat down on the top step.
â€œshut up, sheâ€™s my wife,â€ david said. his hand clamped down above her elbow.
she jerked away, then i saw his arms go around her as if to kiss her and she was in
the air, upside down over his shoulder, hair hanging in damp ropes. â€œokay
twatface,â€ he said, â€œis it off or into the lake?â€
annaâ€™s fists grabbed bunches of his shirt. â€œif i go in, you go in too.â€ the words
spurted from behind her fallen hair, she was kicking, i couldnâ€™t see whether she was
laughing or crying.
â€œshoot,â€ david said to joe, and to anna, â€œiâ€™ll count to ten.â€
joe swivelled the camera and trained it on them like a bazooka or a strange
instrument of torture and pressed the button, lever, sinister whirr.
â€œall right,â€ anna said under its coercion, â€œyou shmuck bastard, god damn you.â€

like a beetleâ€™s on its back and the top dropped away: i saw her cut in half, one breast
on either side of a thin tree.
â€œbottoms too,â€ david said as though to a recalcitrant child. anna glanced at him,
contemptuous, and bent. â€œlook sexy now, move it; give us a little dance.â€
anna stood for a moment, brown-red with yellow fur and white markings like
underwear, glaring at them. then she stuck her middle finger in the air at them and
ran to the end of the dock and jumped into the lake. it was a bellyflop, the water
splattered out like a dropped egg. she came up with her hair in streaks over her
forehead and started to swim around towards the sand point, clumsy, arms flailing.
â€œget that?â€ david said mildly over his shoulder.
â€œsome of it,â€ joe said. â€œmaybe you coul

was being sarcastic but i wasnâ€™t sure. he began to unscrew the camera from the
tripod.
i could hear anna splashing and then stumbling below on the sand point; she was
really crying now, her indrawn breaths rasping. the bushes rustled, she swore; then
she appeared over the top of the hill, she must have climbed up by holding on to the
leaning trees. her pink face was dissolving, her skin was covered with sand and pine
needles like a burned leech. she went into the cabin without looking at me or saying
anything.
i stood up. joe was gone but david was still on the dock, sitting now crosslegged.

t a time they were safer; i went down for the canoe.
â€œhi,â€ he said, â€œhow goes it?â€ he didnâ€™t know iâ€™d been watching. he had his shoes
off and was picking at a toenail as though nothing had happened.
david is like me, i thought, we are the ones that donâ€™t know how to love, there is
something essential missing in us, we were born that way, madame at the store with
one hand, atrophy of the heart. joe and anna are lucky, they do it badly and suffer
because of it: but itâ€™s better to see than to be blind, even though that way you had to
let in the crimes and atrocities too. or perhaps we are normal and the ones who can
love are freaks, they have an extra organ, like the vestigial eye in the foreheads of
amphibians theyâ€™ve never found the use for.
annaâ€™s bikini lay on the dock, crumpled, a shed chrysalis. he picked up the top
and began pleating and unpleating the strap. i hadnâ€™t meant to say any

thing about it,
it wasnâ€™t my concern, but i found myself asking him anyway. â€œwhy did you do
that?â€ my voice was neutral and i realized it wasnâ€™t for anna i was asking, i wasnâ€™t
defending her; it was for myself, i needed to understand.
for a moment he acted. â€œwhat?â€ he said, grinning and innocent.
â€œwhat you just did to her.â€
he looked hard at me to see if i was accusing him but i was untying the canoe, i
was impersonal as a wall, a confessional, and that reassured him. â€œyou donâ€™t know
what she does to me,â€ he said with a slight whine. â€œshe asks for it, she makes me do
it.â€ his voice turned crafty. â€œshe goes with other men, s

with it, but sheâ€™s too dumb, every time i find out; i can smell it on her. not that iâ€™d
mind if sheâ€™d do it openly and be honest about it, god knows, itâ€™s not that iâ€™m
jealous.â€ he smiled broadmindedly. â€œbut sheâ€™s devious, i canâ€™t stand that.â€
anna hadnâ€™t told me, she had left something out; or else he was lying. â€œbut she
loves you,â€ i said.
â€œbullshit,â€ he said, â€œsheâ€™s trying to cut my balls off.â€ his eyes were sad rather
than hostile, as though he had once believed better of her.
â€œshe loves you,â€ i repeated, petals off a daisy; it was the magic word but it
couldnâ€™t work because i had no faith. my husband, saying it over and over like a
dial the weather recording, trying to engrave it on me; and with the same

his moustache and gave a woody woodpecker laugh, his eyes baffled.
â€œi think you could work it out,â€ i said. i braced the paddle across the gunwales and
clambered into the canoe. i remembered what anna had said about emotional
commitments: theyâ€™ve made one, i thought, they hate each other; that must be almost
as absorbing as love. the barometer couple in their wooden house, enshrined in
their niche on paulâ€™s front porch, my ideal; except they were glued there,
condemned to oscillate back and forth, sun and rain, without escape. when he saw
her next there would be no recantations, no elaborate reconciliation or forgiveness,
they were beyond that. neither of them would mention it, they had

talisman, my father had left me the guides, the man-animals and the maze of
numbers.
it would be right for my mother to have left something for me also, a legacy. his
was complicated, tangled, but hers would be simple as a hand, it would be final. i
was not completed yet; there had to be a gift from each of them.
i wanted to search for it but david was jogging down the path from the outhouse.
â€œhi,â€ he called, â€œyou seen anna?â€
â€œno,â€ i said. if i went back to the house or into the garden he would follow me
and talk. i stood up and walked down the rest of the steps and ducked into the trail

enough to protect me, it gave only knowledge and there were more gods than his,
his were the gods of the head, antlers rooted in the brain. not only how to see but
how to act.
i thought he would stay there, at least till i was out of range, but he followed
along behind me. â€œsorry i blew my cool,â€ he said. his voice had changed again,
now it was deferential. â€œitâ€™s between us, okay? no need to mention it to anna,
right?â€ if heâ€™d succeeded he would have told her as soon as he could. â€œi respect you
for it, i really do.â€
â€œthatâ€™s all right,â€ i said; i knew he was lying.
they sat around the table in the regular places and i served dinner. there hadnâ€™t
been any lunch but no one mentioned that.
â€œwhat time is evans coming tomorrow?â€ i said.
â€œten, ten-thirty,â€ david said. â€œhave a nice afternoon?â€ he said to anna. joe stuck
a new potato with his fork and put it into his mouth.

â€œgreat,â€ david said, his voice buoyant, inflated. he bent his arm onto the table,
his hand brushing mine casually, as though by accident, for her to see. i flinched
away, he was lying about me, the animals donâ€™t lie.
anna smiled mournfully at him. i watched him, he wasnâ€™t laughing, he was
staring at her, the lines in his face deepening and sagging. they know everything
about each other, i thought, thatâ€™s why theyâ€™re so sad; but anna was more than sad,
she was desperate, her body her only weapon and she was fighting for her life, he
was her life, her life was the fight: she was fighting him because if she ever
surrendered the balance of power would be broken and he would go elsewhere. to
continue the war.

i wouldnâ€™t.â€ i wanted to tell her i hadnâ€™t acted against her.
her eyes flicked from him to me. â€œthat was pure of you,â€ she said. iâ€™d made a
mistake, she resented me because i hadnâ€™t given in, it commented on her.
â€œsheâ€™s pure all right,â€ david said, â€œsheâ€™s a little purist.â€
â€œjoe told me she wonâ€™t put out for him any more,â€ anna said, still looking at me.
joe didnâ€™t say anything; he was eating another potato.
â€œshe hates men,â€ david said lightly. â€œeither that or she wants to be one. right?â€
a ring of eyes, tribunal; in a minute they would join hands and dance around me,
and after that the rope and the pyre, cure for heresy.
maybe it was true, i leafed through all the men i had known to see whether or not
i hated them. but then i realized it wasnâ€™t the men i hated, it was the americans, the
human beings, men

and women both. theyâ€™d had their chance but they had turned
against the gods, and it was time for me to choose sides. i wanted there to be a
machine that could make them vanish, a button i could press that would evaporate
them without disturbing anything else, that way there would be more room for the
animals, they would be rescued.
â€œarenâ€™t you going to answer?â€ anna said, taunting.
â€œno,â€ i said.
anna said, â€œgod, she really is inhuman,â€ and they both laughed a little,
sorrowfully.
chapter nineteen
i cleared the table and scraped the canned ham fat scraps from the plates into the
fire, food for the dead. if you fed them enough they would come back; or was it the
reverse, if you fed them enough they would stay away, it was in one of the books but
iâ€™d forgotten.
anna said she would wash the dishes. it was an apology perhaps, reparation for
the fact that sheâ€™d found it easier to fight on
 
 ___________________________
 
i searched the toolshed, while i was
getting the shovel, and the garden when i dug up the potatoes; but it wasnâ€™t there, i
would have recognized it. it had to be something out of place, something that wasnâ€™t
here when i left, apple in the row of oranges like the old arithmetic workbooks. she
would have brought it here especially for me and hidden it where i would discover
it when i was ready; like my fatherâ€™s puzzle it would mediate, we cannot approach
them directly. i dried the dishes as anna washed, inspecting each one to make sure it
was familiar. but nothing had been added since iâ€™d been here, the gift was not a dish.
it wasnâ€™t anywhere in the main room. when weâ€™d finished i went into davidâ€™s and
annaâ€™s room: her leather jacket was there, hanging up, it hadnâ€™t been put back since
the trip. i examined the pockets; there was nothing in them but an empty metal
aspirin container and an ancient kleenex, and the husks from sunflower seeds; and a
charred filter from one of a

 my hands and running along my arms, i was close to it. i scanned the walls
and shelves, it wasnâ€™t there; my painted ladies watched me with their bristling eyes.
then i was certain: it was in the scrapbooks, iâ€™d shoved them under the mattress
without reading through all of them. they were the last possibility and they werenâ€™t
supposed to be here, they belonged in the city, in the trunk.
i heard a motor droning from down the lake, a different pitch, deeper than a
powerboat.
â€œhey look,â€ anna called from the main room, â€œa big boat!â€ we went out on the
point: it was a police launch like the ones driven by the game wardens, they were
checking us the way they used to, to see if we had any dead fish and a licence to go
with them; it was routine.
the launch slowed and drew into the dock. david was down there anyway, i
would let him meet it, he was the one with the papers. i re-entered the house and
stood by the window. anna, inquisitive, sauntered down to join them.
there were two me

probably game wardens, they were wearing
ordinary clothes; and a third man, blond, claude from the village probably, and a
fourth one, older, the size of paul. it was odd that paul was on the launch: if he were
coming for a visit he would bring his own boat. david shook hands with them and
they clustered on the dock, talking in low voices. david dug into his pocket, for the
licence; then he scratched his neck as if worried. joe appeared from the outhouse
path and the talking started over again; annaâ€™s head turned up towards me.
then i saw david hurrying, taking the hill steps two at a time. the screen door
banged shut behind him. â€œthey found your father,â€ he said, breathing hard from the
climb. he squinted his face, as if to show sympathy.
the door slammed again, it was anna; he put his arm around her and they both
studied me with the intent pouncing look theyâ€™d had at supper.
â€œoh,â€ i said. â€œwhere?â€
â€œsome american guys found him in the lake. they were fishing, they hooked

magician, producing my father out of nowhere like a stuffed rabbit out of a hat.
â€œwhere?â€ i said again.
â€œitâ€™s awful,â€ anna said, â€œiâ€™m really sorry.â€
â€œthey donâ€™t know where it happened,â€ david said, â€œhe mustâ€™ve drifted; he had a
camera around his neck, big one, they think the weight kept him down or he
wouldâ€™ve been found sooner.â€ his eyes gloating.
it was clever of him to have guessed the missing camera, since iâ€™d told them
nothing. he must have thought quickly in order to make it all up in such a short
time: i knew it was a lie, he was doing it to get back at me. â€œdid they ask to see your

also, iâ€™d read enough murder mysteries. the detectives, eccentric hermits, orchidraisers,
sharp blue-haired old ladies, girls with jackknives and flashlights, for them
everything fitted. but not in real life, i wanted to tell him, youâ€™ve outsmarted
yourself.
he and anna glanced at each other: theyâ€™d planned on hurting me. â€œokay,â€ he
said.
anna said, â€œwouldnâ€™t you rather â€¦â€ and then stopped. they walked back down
the steps, disappointed both of them, their trap had failed.
i went into the other room and took the scrapbooks out from under the mattress.
there was still enough light to see by but i closed my eyes, touching the covers with
my hands, fingertips. one of them was heavier and warmer; i lifted it, let it fall
open. my motherâ€™s gift was t

they gained or lost. joe sat in the corner on the bench, i could hear him scuffling
against the wall.
for him truth might still be possible, what will preserve him is the absence of
words; but the others are already turning to metal, skins galvanizing, heads

criminal, an idiot or a saint. how to act.
their voices murmur, they canâ€™t discuss me, they know iâ€™m listening. theyâ€™re
avoiding me, they find me inappropriate; they think i should be filled with death, i
should be in mourning. but nothing has died, everything is alive, everything is

the door and stands hesitating, darkening the light he holds, after the morning and
the afternoon he isnâ€™t sure how to approach me. i feign sleep and he feels his way
into the room, stealthy as moss, and unzips his human skin.
he thinks iâ€™m in pain, he wants to evade it, he bends himself away from me; but i
stroke him, move my hand over his body, heâ€™s startled because iâ€™m awake. after a
minute he turns to me, stiffening, arms going around me and over me and i smell
anna on him, suntan lotion and pink face grease and smoke, but that doesnâ€™t matter;
what matters is the other smell, smells, the sheets, wool and soap, chemically treated
hides, i canâ€™t here. i sit up, swing my legs out of the bed.

i tug at his hands. â€œnot here.â€

the side.

doorknobs.
â€œyou slept in,â€ he says. he begins to shift himself over onto me but i look at the
sun, itâ€™s late, eight-thirty almost. in the main room i can hear metal on metal, theyâ€™re
up.
â€œthereâ€™s no hurry,â€ he says, but i push him away and get dressed.
anna is making food, scraping a spoon in the frying pan. she has her purple tunic
on and her white bellbottoms, urban costume, and her makeup is slabbed down over
her face like a visor.
â€œi thought iâ€™d do it,â€ she says, â€œso you two could sleep in.â€ she must have heard
the door opening and closing in the night; she produces a smile, warm,
conspiratorial, and i know what circuits are closing in her head: by screwing joe
sheâ€™s brought us back together. saving the world, everyone wants to; me

anna helps him, co-operative community life; she taps him on the knuckles with
her fork and says â€œoh you.â€ then she remembers and adjusts to her tragedy mask:
â€œhow long will it take you, in the village i mean?â€
â€œi donâ€™t know,â€ i say. â€œnot very long.â€
we pack and i help them carry the baggage down, my own also, caseful of alien

camera out, theyâ€™re discussing the movie; the zipper bag of equipment is beside
them, the tripod, the reels of film in their canisters.
â€œi figure we can start cutting it in two or three weeks,â€ david says, his version of
a pro. â€œweâ€™ll take it into the lab first thing.â€
â€œthereâ€™s part of a reel left,â€ anna says. â€œyou should get her, you got me but you
never got her.â€ she looks at me, fumes ascending from her nose and mouth.
â€œnow thatâ€™s an idea,â€ david says. â€œthe rest of us are in it, sheâ€™s the only one who
isnâ€™t.â€ he assesses me. â€œwhere would we fit her in though? we donâ€™t have anyone

anna sits, darkness in her eye sockets, skull with a candle. she clicks the compact

when iâ€™ve unravelled the reels i open the back of the camera. the film coils onto
the sand under the water, weighted down by its containers; the invisible captured

me unaltered from the enamel face. â€œtheyâ€™ll get you,â€ she says, doleful as a
prophet. â€œyou shouldnâ€™t have done it.â€
theyâ€™re at the top of the hill now, coming back for the other canoe. i run quickly
towards it, flip it over right side up, throw a paddle inside and drag it along the
dock.
â€œhey!â€ david calls. â€œwhatâ€™re you doing?â€ theyâ€™re almost here, anna watches
me, biting a knuckle, she canâ€™t decide whether or not to tell: if she keeps quiet theyâ€™ll
treat her as an accomplice.
i slide the canoe stern first into the water, squat, step in, shove.
â€œshe dumped out your film,â€ anna says behind me.
i push the blade into the water, i donâ€™t turn, i can hear them peering down into the
lake.
â€œshit,â€ david says, â€œshit, shit, oh shit, why the shit didnâ€™t you stop her?â€
when iâ€™m as far as the sand point i look back. anna stands, arms

vent some reason, accident, say why iâ€™m not with them.
they will be plotting, a strategy for recapture; or will they really go off and discard
me, vanish into the catacombs of the city, giving me up for lost, stashing me away in
their heads with all the obsolete costumes and phrases? for them iâ€™ll soon be ancient
as crew cuts and world war songs, a half-remembered face in a highschool
yearbook, a captured enemy medal: memorabilia, or possibly not even that.
joe comes up the steps, shouting; anna shouts too, shrill, like a train whistle
before departure, my name. itâ€™s too late, i no longer have a name. i tried for all
those years to be civilized but iâ€™m not and iâ€™m through pretending.
joe goes around to the front of the cabin, concealed from me. after a minute he
reappears, stumping back down the hill to them, shoulders sloped in defeat. perhaps
by now he understands.
they clamber into the boat. anna pauses for a moment, turned directly towards
me, face in the sunlight puzzled, od

hanging on the nail, i should have put them in my pocket. but it was stupid of
them to think they could keep me out. soon they will reach the village, the car, the
city; what are they saying about me now? that i was running away; but to go with
them would have been running away, the truth is here.
i stand on the front step and lean sideways, clutching the window-ledge, looking
in. the canvas packsack with my clothes has been moved, itâ€™s back inside now, on
the table with my case; beside it is annaâ€™s detective novel, her last one, cold comfort
but comfort, death is logical, thereâ€™s always a motive. perhaps thatâ€™s why she read
them, for the theology.
sun gone, sky darkening, it may rain later. clouds building over the hills, anvils,
ominous hammerheads, it will be a storm; it might miss though, sometimes they
eddy for days, approaching but never striking. iâ€™ll have to get inside. breaking into
my own house, go in and out the window they used to sing, holding their arms up
like brid

the window each time, but the other windows have screens and iâ€™ve
nothing to cut them with. i could try the knife: if i had to leave in a hurry it would be
better to use one of the back windows, theyâ€™re nearer the ground.
iâ€™ve succeeded; i donâ€™t know what to do now. i pause in the middle of the room,
listening: no wind, stillness, held breath of the lake, the trees.
to be busy i unpack my clothes again and hang them on the nails in my room. my
motherâ€™s jacket is back, i last saw it in annaâ€™s room, itâ€™s been shifted. my footsteps
are the only sounds, reverberation of shoes on wood.
there must be something that comes next but the power has drained away, my
fingers are empty as gloves, eyes ordinary, nothing guides me.
i sit down at the table and leaf through an old magazine, shepherds knitting their
own socks, weather gnarling their faces, women in laced bodices and red lipstick
balancing washing baskets on their heads, smiling to show their teeth and happiness;

e brush there is a surge of fear in my hand, the power is
there again in a different form, it must have seeped up through the ground during
the lightning. i know that the brush is forbidden, i must stop being in the mirror. i
look for the last time at my distorted glass face: eyes lightblue in dark red skin, hair
standing tangled out from my head, reflection intruding between my eyes and
vision. not to see myself but to see. i reverse the mirror so itâ€™s toward the wall, it no
longer traps me, annaâ€™s soul closed in the gold compact, that and not the camera is
what i should have broken.
i unfasten the window and go out; at once the fear leaves me like a hand lifting
from my throat. there must be rules: places iâ€™m permitted to be, other places iâ€™m
not. iâ€™ll have to listen carefully, if i trust them they will tell me what is allowed. i
ought to have let them in, it may have been the only chance they will give me.
the enclosure with the swing and the sandpile is forbidden, i know that

the only one left alive on the island.
they were here though, i trust that. i saw them and they spoke to me, in the other
language.
iâ€™m not hungry any more but i trudge back to the cabin and climb through the
window again and open a tin of yellow beans. to prefer life, i owe them that. i sit
crosslegged on the wall bench and eat the beans out of the can with my fingers, a
few at a time, too much at first is bad. junk on the floor, things broken, did i do that?
david and anna were here, they slept in the far bedroom; i remember them, but
indistinctly and with nostalgia, as i remember people i once knew. they live in the
city now, in a different time. i can remember him, fake husband, more clearly
though, and now i feel nothing for him but sorrow. he was neither of the things i
believed, he was only a normal man, middle-aged, second-rate, selfish and kind in
the average proportions; but i was not prepared for the average, its needless
cruelties and lies. my brother s

nd retreat behind the trees, white birches clumped
beside the path, not hurrying, not running away but cautious.
the motor cuts, the nose of the boat bumps the dock. paul stands up with an oar,
pulling in; joe gets out and ropes the boat and takes several steps towards the land.
he calls my name, then pauses, â€œare you here?â€ echo: here, here?
he must have been waiting in the village, the searchers must have told him theyâ€™d
seen me, perhaps he was with them. he stayed behind when david and anna went
away in their car, or he drove to the city with them and then hitched back, walked
back, whatâ€™s important is that heâ€™s here, a mediator, an ambassador, offering me
something: captivity in any of its forms, a new freedom?
i watch him, my love for him useless as a third eye or a possibility. if i go with
him we will have to talk, wooden houses are obsolete, we can no longer live in
spurious peace by avoiding each other, the way it was before, we will have to begin.
for us itâ€™s necessar
