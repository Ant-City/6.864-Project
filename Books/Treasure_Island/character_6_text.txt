 i was standing on the dock, when, by the
     merest accident, i fell in talk with him.  i found
     he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew
     all the seafaring men in bristol, had lost his
     health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to
     get to sea again.  he had hobbled down there that
     morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.

     i was monstrously touched--so would you have
     been--and, out of pure pity, i engaged him on the
     spot to be ship's cook.  long john silver, he is
     called, and has lost a leg; but that i regarded as
     a recommendation, since he lost it in his
     country's service, under the immortal hawke.  he
     has no pension, livesey.  imagine the abominable
     age we live in!

     well, sir, i thought i had only found a cook,
     but it was a crew i had discovered.  between
     silver and myself we got together in a few days a
     company of the toughest old salts imaginable--not
     pretty to look at, but fellows, by their fa

livesey, come
     post; do not lose an hour, if you respect me.

     let young hawkins go at once to see his
     mother, with redruth for a guard; and then both
     come full speed to bristol.

     postscript--i did not tell you that blandly,
     who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if
     we don't turn up by the end of august, had found
     an admirable fellow for sailing master--a stiff
     man, which i regret, but in all other respects a
     treasure.  long john silver unearthed a very
     competent man for a mate, a man named arrow.  i
     have a boatswain who pipes, livesey; so things
     shall go man-o'-war fashion on board the good ship
     hispaniola.

     i forgot to tell you that silver is a man of
     substance; i know of my own knowledge that he has
     a banker's account, which has never been
     overdrawn.  he leaves his wife to manage the inn;
     and as she is a woman of colour, a pair of old
     bachelors like you and i may be excused

, slapping tables with his hand, and giving
such a show of excitement as would have convinced an old bailey judge
or a bow street runner. my suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on
finding black dog at the spy-glass, and i watched the cook narrowly. but
he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time
the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost
the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, i would have gone
bail for the innocence of long john silver.

"see here, now, hawkins," said he, "here's a blessed hard thing on a
man like me, now, ain't it? there's cap'n trelawney--what's he to think?
here i have this confounded son of a dutchman sitting in my own house
drinking of my own rum! here you comes and tells me of it plain; and
here i let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! now,
hawkins, you do me justice with the cap'n. you're a lad, you are, but
you're as smart as paint. i see that when you first come in. now, here

 there we were, without a mate; and it was necessary, of course, to
advance one of the men. the boatswain, job anderson, was the likeliest
man aboard, and though he kept his old title, he served in a way as
mate. mr. trelawney had followed the sea, and his knowledge made him
very useful, for he often took a watch himself in easy weather. and the
coxswain, israel hands, was a careful, wily, old, experienced seaman who
could be trusted at a pinch with almost anything.

he was a great confidant of long john silver, and so the mention of
his name leads me on to speak of our ship's cook, barbecue, as the men
called him.

aboard ship he carried his crutch by a lanyard round his neck, to have
both hands as free as possible. it was something to see him wedge the
foot of the crutch against a bulkhead, and propped against it, yielding
to every movement of the ship, get on with his cooking like someone safe
ashore. still more strange was it to see him in the heaviest of weather
cross the deck. he had a line or t

as i could manage, under the
favourable ambush of the crouching trees.

i could tell the direction of the speakers pretty exactly, not only by
the sound of their voices but by the behaviour of the few birds that
still hung in alarm above the heads of the intruders.

crawling on all fours, i made steadily but slowly towards them, till at
last, raising my head to an aperture among the leaves, i could see clear
down into a little green dell beside the marsh, and closely set about
with trees, where long john silver and another of the crew stood face to
face in conversation.

the sun beat full upon them. silver had thrown his hat beside him on the
ground, and his great, smooth, blond face, all shining with heat, was
lifted to the other man's in a kind of appeal.

"mate," he was saying, "it's because i thinks gold dust of you--gold
dust, and you may lay to that! if i hadn't took to you like pitch, do
you think i'd have been here a-warning of you? all's up--you can't make
