years devoted himself to this and nothing
else? no tools will make a man a skilled workman, or master of defence,
nor be of any use to him who has not learned how to handle them, and has
never bestowed any attention upon them. how then will he who takes up
a shield or other implement of war become a good fighter all in a day,
whether with heavy-armed or any other kind of troops?

yes, he said, the tools which would teach men their own use would be
beyond price.

and the higher the duties of the guardian, i said, the more time, and
skill, and art, and application will be needed by him?

no doubt, he replied.

will he not also require natural aptitude for his calling?

certainly.

then it will be our duty to select, if we can, natures which are fitted
for the task of guarding the city?

it will.

and the selection will be no easy matter, i said; but we must be brave
and do our best.

we must.

is not the noble youth very like a well-bred dog in respect of guarding
and watching?

what do you mean

?

i mean that both of them ought to be quick to see, and swift to overtake
the enemy when they see him; and strong too if, when they have caught
him, they have to fight with him.

all these qualities, he replied, will certainly be required by them.

well, and your guardian must be brave if he is to fight well?

certainly.

and is he likely to be brave who has no spirit, whether horse or dog
or any other animal? have you never observed how invincible and
unconquerable is spirit and how the presence of it makes the soul of any
creature to be absolutely fearless and indomitable?

i have.

then now we have a clear notion of the bodily qualities which are
required in the guardian.

true.

and also of the mental ones; his soul is to be full of spirit?

yes.

but are no
 
 ___________________________
 
ted natures apt to be savage with one another,
and with everybody else?

a difficulty by no means easy to overcome, he replied.

whereas, i said, they ought to be dangerous to their enemies, and gentle
to their friends; if not, they will destroy themselves without waiting
for their enemies to destroy them.

true, he said.

what is to be done then? i said; how shall we find a gentle nature which
has also a great spirit, for the one is the contradiction of the other?

true.

he will not be a good guardian who is wanting in either of these two
qualities; and yet the combination of them appears to be impossible; and
hence we must infer that to be a good guardian is impossible.

i am afraid that what you say is true, he replied.

here feeling perplexed i began to think over what had preceded.--my
friend, i said, no wonder that we are in a perplexity; for we have lost
sight of the image which we had before us.

what do you mean? he said.

i mean to say that there do exist natures gifted with those o
 
 ___________________________
 
pposite
qualities.

and where do you find them?

many animals, i replied, furnish examples of them; our friend the dog
is a very good one: you know that well-bred dogs are perfectly gentle to
their familiars and acquaintances, and the reverse to strangers.

yes, i know.

then there is nothing impossible or out of the order of nature in our
finding a guardian who has a similar combination of qualities?

certainly not.

would not he who is fitted to be a guardian, besides the spirited
nature, need to have the qualities of a philosopher?

i do not apprehend your meaning.

the trait of which i am speaking, i replied, may be also seen in the
dog, and is remarkable in the animal.

what trait?

why, a dog, whenever he sees a stranger, is angry; when an acquaintance,
he welcomes him, although the one has never done him any harm, nor the
other any good. did this never strike you as curious?

the matter never struck me before; but i quite recognise the truth of
 
 ___________________________
 
 knowing. and must not an animal be a
lover of learning who determines what he likes and dislikes by the test
of knowledge and ignorance?

most assuredly.

and is not the love of learning the love of wisdom, which is philosophy?

they are the same, he replied.

and may we not say confidently of man also, that he who is likely to be
gentle to his friends and acquaintances, must by nature be a lover of
wisdom and knowledge?

that we may safely affirm.

then he who is to be a really good and noble guardian of the state will
require to unite in himself philosophy and spirit and swiftness and
strength?

undoubtedly.

then we have found the desired natures; and now that we have found them,
how are they to be reared and educated? is not this an enquiry which
may be expected to throw light on the greater enquiry which is our final
end--how do justice and injustice grow up in states? for we do not want
either to omit what is to the point or to draw out the argument to an
inconvenient length.

re extremely objectionable.

yes, adeimantus, they are stories not to be repeated in our state; the
young man should not be told that in committing the worst of crimes he
is far from doing anything outrageous; and that even if he chastises his
father when he does wrong, in whatever manner, he will only be following
the example of the first and greatest among the gods.

i entirely agree with you, he said; in my opinion those stories are
quite unfit to be repeated.

neither, if we mean our future guardians to regard the habit of
quarrelling among themselves as of all things the basest, should
any word be said to them of the wars in heaven, and of the plots and
fightings of the gods against one another, for they are not true. no,
we shall never mention the battles of the giants, or let them be
embroidered on garments; and we shall be silent about the innumerable
other quarrels of gods and heroes with their friends and relatives.
if they would only believe us we would tell them that quarrelling

these are the kind of sentiments about the gods which will arouse our
anger; and he who utters them shall be refused a chorus; neither shall
we allow teachers to make use of them in the instruction of the young,
meaning, as we do, that our guardians, as far as men can be, should be
true worshippers of the gods and like them.

i entirely agree, he said, in these principles, and promise to make them
my laws.

such then, i said, are our principles of theology--some tales are to be
told, and others are not to be told to our disciples from their youth
upwards, if we mean them to honour the gods and their parents, and to
value friendship with one another.

yes; and i think that our principles are right, he said.

undoubtedly.

also we shall have to reject all the terrible and appalling names which
describe the world below--cocytus and styx, ghosts under the earth, and
sapless shades, and any similar words of which the very mention causes a
shudder to pass through the inmost soul of him who hears them. i do not
say that these horrible stories may not have a use of some kind; but
there is a danger that the nerves of our guardians may be rendered too
excitable and effeminate by them.

there is a real danger, he said.

then we must have no more of them.

true.

clearly.

and shall we proceed to get rid of the weepings and wailings of famous
men?

they will go with the rest.

but shall we be right in getting rid of them? reflect: our principle is
that the good man will not consider death terrible to any other good man
who is his comrade.

which may arise in his mind to say and do the like. and instead
of having any shame or self-control, he will be always whining and

yes, he said, that is most true.

yes, i replied; but that surely is what ought not to be, as the argument
has just proved to us; and by that proof we must abide until it is
disproved by a better.

it ought not to be.

neither ought our guardians to be given to laughter. for a fit of
laughter which has been indulged to excess almost always produces a
violent reaction.

so i believe.

then persons of worth, even if only mortal men, must not be represented
as overcome by laughter, and still less must such a representation of
the gods be allowed.

still less of the gods, as you say, he replied.

then we shall not suffer such an expression to be used about the gods as
that of homer when he describes how

their stories, are to be allowed by us to imitate, and if so, whether

into our state?

yes, i said; but there may be more than this in question: i really do
not know as yet, but whither the argument may blow, thither we go.

and go we will, he said.

then, adeimantus, let me ask you whether our guardians ought to be
imitators; or rather, has not this question been decided by the rule
already laid down that one man can only do one thing well, and not many;
and that if he attempt many, he will altogether fail of gaining much
reputation in any?

certainly.

and this is equally true of imitation; no one man can imitate many
things as well as he would imitate a single one?

he cannot.

then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life,
and at the same time to be an imitator an

true.

neither are comic and tragic actors the same; yet all these things are
but imitations.

they are so.

and human nature, adeimantus, appears to have been coined into yet
smaller pieces, and to be as incapable of imitating many things well, as
of performing well the actions of which the imitations are copies.

quite true, he replied.

if then we adhere to our original notion and bear in mind that
our guardians, setting aside every other business, are to dedicate
themselves wholly to the maintenance of freedom in the state, making
this their craft, and engaging in no work which does not bear on this
end, they ought not to practise or imitate anything else; if they
imitate at all, they should imitate from youth upward only those
characters which are suitable to their profession--the courageous,
temperate, holy, free, and the like; but they should not depict or be
skilful at imitating any kind of illib

the harmonies which you mean are the mixed or tenor lydian, and the

these then, i said, must be banished; even to women who have a character

certainly.

in the next place, drunkenness and softness and indolence are utterly
unbecoming the character of our guardians.

utterly unbecoming.

the ionian, he replied, and the lydian; they are termed 'relaxed.'

well, and are these of any military use?

quite the reverse, he replied; and if so the dorian and the phrygian are
the only ones which you have left.

or, as we recognise the reflection of letters in the water, or in a

even so, as i maintain, neither we nor our guardians, whom we have to

forms of temperance, courage, liberality, magnificence, and their
kindred, as well as the contrary forms, in all their combinations,
and can recognise them and their images wherever they are found, not

to be within the sphere of one art and study.

over the more particular care of the body; and in order to avoid
prolixity we will now only give the general outlines of the subject.

that they must abstain from intoxication has been already remarked by
us; for of all persons a guardian should be the last to get drunk and
not know where in the world he is.

yes, he said; that a guardian should require another guardian to take
care of him is ridiculous indeed.

but next, what shall we say of their food; for the men are in training
for the great contest of all--are they not?

yes, he said.

and will the habit of body of our ordinary athletes be suited to them?

why not?

i am afraid, i said, that a habit of body such as they have is but a
sleepy sort of thing, and rather perilou

is good for him.

yet surely, i said, this ferocity only comes from spirit, which, if
rightly educated, would give courage, but, if too much intensified, is
liable to become hard and brutal.

that i quite think.

on the other hand the philosopher will have the quality of gentleness.
and this also, when too much indulged, will turn to softness, but, if
educated rightly, will be gentle and moderate.

true.

and in our opinion the guardians ought to have both these qualities?

assuredly.

and both should be in harmony?

beyond question.

and the harmonious soul is both temperate and courageous?

yes.

and the inharmonious is cowardly and boorish?

very true.

and, when a man allows music to play upon him and to pour into his soul
through the funnel of his ears those sweet and soft and melancholy airs
of which we were just now speaking, and his whole life is passed in

that, we shall have no difficulty in discovering them.

i dare say that there will be no difficulty.

very good, i said; then what is the next question? must we not ask who
are to be rulers and who subjects?

certainly.

there can be no doubt that the elder must rule the younger.

clearly.

and that the best of these must rule.

that is also clear.

now, are not the best husbandmen those who are most devoted to
husbandry?

yes.

and as we are to have the best of guardians for our city, must they not
be those who have most the character of guardians?

yes.

and to this end they ought to be wise and efficient, and to have a
special care of the state?

true.

and a man will be most likely to care about that which he loves?

to be sure.

and he will be most likely to love that which he regards as having the
same interests with himself, and that of which the good or evil fortune
is supposed by him at any time most to affect his own?

very true, he replied.

then the

who in their whole life show the greatest eagerness to do what is for
the good of their country, and the greatest repugnance to do what is

those are the right men.

and they will have to be watched at every age, in order that we may see
whether they preserve their resolution, and never, under the influence
either of force or enchantment, forget or cast off their sense of duty
to the state.

how cast off? he said.

i will explain to you, i replied. a resolution may

those again who are forced, are those whom the violence of some pain or
grief compels to change their opinion.

i understand, he said, and you are quite right.

and you would also acknowledge that the enchanted are those who change
their minds either under the softer influence of pleasure, or the
sterner influence of fear?

yes, he said; everything that deceives may be said to enchant.

therefore, as i was just now saying, we must enquire who are the best
guardians of their own conviction that what they think the interest
of the state is to be the rule of their lives. we must watch them from
their youth upwards, and make them perform actions in which they are
most likely to forget or to be deceived, and he who remembers and is
not deceived is to be selected, and he who fails in the trial is to be
rejected. that will be the way?

yes.

and there should also be toils and pains and conflicts prescribed for
them, in which they will be made to give further pr

very right, he replied.

and then, i said, we must try them with enchantments--that is the third
sort of test--and see what will be their behaviour: like those who take
colts amid noise and tumult to see if they are of a timid nature, so
must we take our youth amid terrors of some kind, and again pass them
into pleasures, and prove them more thoroughly than gold is proved in
the furnace, that we may discover whether they are armed against
all enchantments, and of a noble bearing always, good guardians of
themselves and of the music which they have learned, and retaining under
all circumstances a rhythmical and harmonious nature, such as will be
most serviceable to the individual and to the state. and he who at every
age, as boy and youth and in mature life, has come out of the trial
victorious and pure, shall be appointed a ruler and guardian of the
state; he shall be honoured in life and death, and shall receive
sepulture and other memorials of honour, the greatest that we have to

this is the sort of way in which our rulers and guardians should be
chosen and appointed. i speak generally, and not with any pretension to
exactness.

and, speaking generally, i agree with you, he said.

and perhaps the word 'guardian' in the fullest sense ought to be applied
to this higher class only who preserve us against foreign enemies and
maintain peace among our citizens at home, that the one may not have the
will, or the others the power, to harm us. the young men whom we
before called guardians may be more properly designated auxiliaries and
supporters of the principles of the rulers.

i agree with you, he said.

how then may we devise one of those needful falsehoods of which we
lately spoke--just one royal lie whic

parent will sometimes have a silver son, or a silver parent a golden
son. and god proclaims as a first principle to the rulers, and above all
else, that there is nothing which they should so anxiously guard, or of
which they are to be such good guardians, as of the purity of the race.
they should observe what elements mingle in their offspring; for if the
son of a golden or silver parent has an admixture of brass and iron,
then nature orders a transposition of ranks, and the eye of the ruler
must not be pitiful towards the child because he has to descend in the
scale and become a husbandman or artisan, just as there may be sons of
artisans who having an admixture of gold or silver in them are raised

but they are well-educated already, he replied.

i cannot be so confident, my dear glaucon, i said; i am much more
certain that they ought to be, and that true education, whatever that
may be, will have the greatest tendency to civilize and humanize them
in their relations to one another, and to those who are under their
protection.

very true, he replied.

and not only their education, but their habitations, and all that
belongs to them, should be such as will neither impair their virtue as
guardians, nor tempt them to prey upon the other citizens. any man of
sense must acknowledge that.

he must.

then now let us consider what will be their way of life, if they are to
realize our idea of them. in the first place, none of them should have
any property of his own beyond what is absolutely necessary; neither
should they have a private house or store closed against any one who has
a mind to enter; their provisions should be only such as are required
by trained warriors, who are men of tempera

 not
to pollute the divine by any such earthly admixture; for that commoner
metal has been the source of many unholy deeds, but their own is
undefiled. and they alone of all the citizens may not touch or handle
silver or gold, or be under the same roof with them, or wear them, or
drink from them. and this will be their salvation, and they will be the
saviours of the state. but should they ever acquire homes or lands
or moneys of their own, they will become housekeepers and husbandmen
instead of guardians, enemies and tyrants instead of allies of the other
citizens; hating and being hated, plotting and being plotted against,
they will pass their whole life in much greater terror of internal than
of external enemies, and the hour of ruin, both to themselves and to the
rest of the state, will be at hand. for all which reasons may we not
say that thus shall our state be ordered, and that these shall be the
regulations appointed by us for guardians concerning their houses and
all other matters?

they would, take a journey of pleasure; they have no money to spend on
a mistress or any other luxurious fancy, which, as the world goes, is
thought to be happiness; and many other accusations of the same nature
might be added.

but, said he, let us suppose all this to be included in the charge.

you mean to ask, i said, what will be our answer?

yes.

if we proceed along the old path, my belief, i said, is that we shall
find the answer. and our answer will be that, even as they are, our
guardians may very likely be the happiest of men; but that our aim in
founding the state was not the disproportionate happiness of any one
class, but the greatest happiness of the whole; we thought that in a
state which is ordered with a view to the good of the whole we should
be most likely to find justice, and in the ill-ordered state injustice:
and, having found them, we might then decide which of the two is the
happier. at present, i take it, we are fashioning the happy state,
not piecemeal, or with

and said, why do you not put the most beautiful colours on the most
beautiful parts of the body--the eyes ought to be purple, but you have
made them black--to him we might fairly answer, sir, you would not
surely have us beautify the eyes to such a degree that they are no
longer eyes; consider rather whether, by giving this and the other
features their due proportion, we make the whole beautiful. and so i say
to you, do not compel us to assign to the guardians a sort of happiness
which will make them anything but guardians; for we too can clothe our
husbandmen in royal apparel, and set crowns of gold on their heads, and
bid them till the ground as much as they like, and no more. our potters
also might be allowed to repose on couches, and feast by the fireside,
passing round the winecup, while their wheel is conveniently at hand,
and working at pottery only as much as they like; in this way we might
make every class happy--and then, as you imagine, t

he whole state would
be happy. but do not put this idea into our heads; for, if we listen
to you, the husbandman will be no longer a husbandman, the potter will
cease to be a potter, and no one will have the character of any distinct
class in the state. now this is not of much consequence where the
corruption of society, and pretension to be what you are not, is
confined to cobblers; but when the guardians of the laws and of the
government are only seeming and not real guardians, then see how they
turn the state upside down; and on the other hand they alone have the
power of giving order and happiness to the state. we mean our guardians
to be true saviours and not the destroyers of the state, whereas our
opponent is thinking of peasants at a festival, who are enjoying a life
of revelry, not of citizens who are doing their duty to the state. but,
if so, we mean different things, and he is speaking of something which
is not a state. and therefore we must consider whethe
 
 ___________________________
 
r in appointing
our guardians we would look to their greatest happiness individually, or
whether this principle of happiness does not rather reside in the state
as a whole. but if the latter be the truth, then the guardians and
auxiliaries, and all others equally with them, must be compelled or
induced to do their own work in the best way. and thus the whole state
will grow up in a noble order, and the several classes will receive the
proportion of happiness which nature assigns to them.

i think that you are quite right.

i wonder whether you will agree with another remark which occurs to me.

what may that be?

there seem to be two causes of the deterioration of the arts.

what are they?

wealth, i said, and po
 
 ___________________________
 
e result will be that he becomes a worse potter?

yes; he greatly deteriorates.

but, on the other hand, if he has no money, and cannot provide himself
with tools or instruments, he will not work equally well himself, nor
will he teach his sons or apprentices to work equally well.

certainly not.

then, under the influence either of poverty or of wealth, workmen and
their work are equally liable to degenerate?

that is evident.

here, then, is a discovery of new evils, i said, against which
the guardians will have to watch, or they will creep into the city
unobserved.

what evils?

wealth, i said, and poverty; the one is the parent of luxury and
indolence, and the other of meanness and viciousness, and both of
discontent.

that is very true, he replied; but still i should like to know,
socrates, how our city will be able to go to war, especially against an
enemy who is rich and powerful, if deprived of the sinews of war.

there would certainly be a difficulty, i replied, in going to war with
o

as great and many times
greater.

that is most true, he said.

and what, i said, will be the best limit for our rulers to fix when they
are considering the size of the state and the amount of territory which
they are to include, and beyond which they will not go?

what limit would you propose?

i would allow the state to increase so far as is consistent with unity;
that, i think, is the proper limit.

very good, he said.

here then, i said, is another order which will have to be conveyed to
our guardians: let our city be accounted neither large nor small, but
one and self-sufficing.

and surely, said he, this is not a very severe order which we impose
upon them.

and the other, said i, of which we were speaking before is lighter
still,--i mean the duty of degrading the offspring of the guardians when
inferior, and of elevating into the rank of guardians the offspring of
the lower classes, when naturally superior. the intention was, that, in
the case of the citizens generally, each individual s

yes, said adeimantus; and you may add my suffrage to damon's and your

harmless.

why, yes, he said, and there is no harm; were it not that little by

into manners and customs; whence, issuing with greater force, it invades
contracts between man and man, and from contracts goes on to laws and

nor yet by reason of a knowledge which cultivates the earth; that would
give the city the name of agricultural?

yes.

well, i said, and is there any knowledge in our recently-founded state
among any of the citizens which advises, not about any particular thing
in the state, but about the whole, and considers how a state can best
deal with itself and with other states?

there certainly is.

and what is this knowledge, and among whom is it found? i asked.

it is the knowledge of the guardians, he replied, and is found among
those whom we were just now describing as perfect guardians.

and what is the name which the city derives from the possession of this
sort of knowledge?

the name of good in counsel and truly wise.

and will there be in our city more of these true guardians or more

the smiths, he replied, will be far more numerous.

will not the guardians be the smallest of all the classes who receive a
name from the profession of some kind of knowledge?

carpenter; and suppose them to exchange their implements or their
duties, or the same person to be doing the work of both, or whatever be
the change; do you think that any great harm would result to the state?

not much.

but when the cobbler or any other man whom nature designed to be a
trader, having his heart lifted up by wealth or strength or the number
of his followers, or any like advantage, attempts to force his way
into the class of warriors, or a warrior into that of legislators and
guardians, for which he is unfitted, and either to take the implements
or the duties of the other; or when one man is trader, legislator, and
warrior all in one, then i think you will agree with me in saying that
this interchange and this meddling of one with another is the ruin of
the state.

most true.

seeing then, i said, that there are three distinct classes, any meddling
of one with another, or the change of one into another, is the greatest
harm to the state, and may be most justly termed evil-do

precisely.

and the greatest degree of evil-doing to one's own city would be termed
by you injustice?

certainly.

this then is injustice; and on the other hand when the trader, the
auxiliary, and the guardian each do their own business, that is justice,
and will make the city just.

i agree with you.

we will not, i said, be over-positive as yet; but if, on trial, this
conception of justice be verified in the individual as well as in
the state, there will be no longer any room for doubt; if it be not
verified, we must have a fresh enquiry. first let us complete the old
investigation, which we began, as you remember, under the impression
that, if we could previously examine justice on the larger scal

trouble, and avoided it.

for what purpose do you conceive that we have come here, said
thrasymachus,--to look for gold, or to hear discourse?

yes, but discourse should have a limit.

yes, socrates, said glaucon, and the whole of life is the only limit
which wise men assign to the hearing of such discourses. but never mind
about us; take heart yourself and answer the question in your own way:
what sort of community of women and children is this which is to prevail
among our guardians? and how shall we manage the period between birth
and education, which seems to require the greatest care? tell us how
these things will be.

yes, my simple friend, but the answer is the reverse of easy; many more
doubts arise about this than about our previous conclusions. for the
practicability of what is said may be doubted; and looked at in another
point of view, whether the scheme, if ever so practicable, would be for
the best, is also doubtful. hence i feel a reluctance to approach the

and say what i
perhaps ought to have said before in the proper place. the part of the
men has been played out, and now properly enough comes the turn of the
women. of them i will proceed to speak, and the more readily since i am
invited by you.

for men born and educated like our citizens, the only way, in my
opinion, of arriving at a right conclusion about the possession and
use of women and children is to follow the path on which we originally
started, when we said that the men were to be the guardians and
watchdogs of the herd.

true.

let us further suppose the birth and education of our women to be
subject to similar or nearly similar regulations; then we shall see
whether the result accords with our design.

what do you mean?

what i mean may be put into the form of a question, i said: are dogs
divided into hes and shes, or do they both share equally in hunting and
in keeping watch and in the other duties of dogs? or do we entrust to
the males the entire and exclusive care of the flocks,

ian and the carpenter have different natures?

certainly.

and if, i said, the male and female sex appear to differ in their
fitness for any art or pursuit, we should say that such pursuit or art
ought to be assigned to one or the other of them; but if the difference
consists only in women bearing and men begetting children, this does not
amount to a proof that a woman differs from a man in respect of the
sort of education she should receive; and we shall therefore continue
to maintain that our guardians and their wives ought to have the same
pursuits.

very true, he said.

next, we shall ask our opponent how, in reference to any of the pursuits
or arts of civic life, the nature of a woman differs from that of a man?

that will be quite fair.

and perhaps he, like yourself, will reply that to give a sufficient
answer on the instant is not easy; but after a little reflection there
is no difficulty.

yes, perhaps.

suppose then that we invite him to accompany us in the argument, and
then we may

ose all our enactments on men and none of them on
women?

that will never do.

one woman has a gift of healing, another not; one is a musician, and
another has no music in her nature?

very true.

and one woman has a turn for gymnastic and military exercises, and
another is unwarlike and hates gymnastics?

certainly.

and one woman is a philosopher, and another is an enemy of philosophy;
one has spirit, and another is without spirit?

that is also true.

then one woman will have the temper of a guardian, and another not. was
not the selection of the male guardians determined by differences of
this sort?

yes.

men and women alike possess the qualities which make a guardian; they
differ only in their comparative strength or weakness.

obviously.

and those women who have such qualities are to be selected as the
companions and colleagues of men who have similar qualities and whom
they resemble in capacity and in character?

very true.

and ought not the same natures to have the same pursuits?

t

hey ought.

then, as we were saying before, there is nothing unnatural in assigning
music and gymnastic to the wives of the guardians--to that point we come
round again.

certainly not.

the law which we then enacted was agreeable to nature, and therefore not
an impossibility or mere aspiration; and the contrary practice, which
prevails at present, is in reality a violation of nature.

that appears to be true.

we had to consider, first, whether our proposals were possible, and
secondly whether they were the most beneficial?

yes.

and the possibility has been acknowledged?

yes.

the very great benefit has next to be establ

ished?

quite so.

you will admit that the same education which makes a man a good guardian
will make a woman a good guardian; for their original nature is the
same?

yes.

i should like to ask you a question.

what is it?

would you say that all men are equal in excellence, or is one man better
than another?

the latter.

and in the commonwealth which we were founding do you conceive the
guardians who have been brought up on our model system to be more
perfect men, or the cobblers whose education has been cobbling?

what a ridiculous question!

you have answered me, i replied: well, and may we not further say that
our guardians are the best of our citizens?

by far the best.

and will not their wives be the best women?

yes, by far the best.

and can there be anything better for the interests of the state than
that the men and women of a state should be as good as possible?

there can b
 
 ___________________________
 
e nothing better.

and this is what the arts of music and gymnastic, when present in such
manner as we have described, will accomplish?

certainly.

then we have made an enactment not only possible but in the highest
degree beneficial to the state?

true.

then let the wives of our guardians strip, for their virtue will be
their robe, and let them share in the toils of war and the defence of
their country; only in the distribution of labours the lighter are to be
assigned to the women, who are the weaker natures, but in other respects
their duties are to be the same. and as for the man who laughs at naked
women exercising their bodies from the best of motives, in his laughter
he is plucking

'a fruit of unripe wisdom,'

and he himself is ignorant of what he is laughing at, or what

 he is
about;--for that is, and ever will be, the best of sayings, that the
useful is the noble and the hurtful is the base.

very true.

here, then, is one difficulty in our law about women, which we may say
that we have now escaped; the wave has not swallowed us up alive for
enacting that the guardians of either sex should have all their
pursuits in common; to the utility and also to the possibility of this
arrangement the consistency of the argument with itself bears witness.

yes, that was a mighty wave which you have escaped.

yes, i said, but a greater is coming; you will not think much of this
when you see the next.

go on; let me see.

the law, i said, which is the sequel of this and of all that has
preceded, is to the following effect,--'that the wives of our guardians
are to be commo

their wish has come true--that is a way which
they have of not doing much good to a capacity which was never good for
much. now i myself am beginning to lose heart, and i should like, with
your permission, to pass over the question of possibility at present.
assuming therefore the possibility of the proposal, i shall now proceed
to enquire how the rulers will carry out these arrangements, and i shall
demonstrate that our plan, if executed, will be of the greatest benefit
to the state and to the guardians. first of all, then, if you have no
objection, i will endeavour with your help to consider the advantages of
the measure; and hereafter the question of possibility.

i have no objection; proceed.

first, i think that if our rulers and their auxiliaries are to be worthy
of the name which they bear, there must be willingness to obey in the
one and the power of command in the other; the guardians must themselves
obey the laws, and they must also imitate the spirit of them in any
details which are

regulations of marriages and births.

how so?

why, i said, the principle has been already laid down that the best of
either sex should be united with the best as often, and the inferior
with the inferior, as seldom as possible; and that they should rear the
offspring of the one sort of union, but not of the other, if the flock
is to be maintained in first-rate condition. now these goings on must be
a secret which the rulers only know, or there will be a further
danger of our herd, as the guardians may be termed, breaking out into
rebellion.

very true.

had we not better appoint certain festivals at which we will bring
together the brides and bridegrooms, and sacrifices will be offered and
suitable hymeneal songs composed by our poets: the number of weddings is
a matter which must be left to the discretion of the rulers, whose aim
will be to preserve the average of population? there are many other
things which they will have to consider, such as the effects of wars and
diseases and any

and the proper officers, whether male or female or both, for offices are
to be held by women as well as by men--

yes--

the proper officers will take the offspring of the good parents to the
pen or fold, and there they will deposit them with certain nurses who
dwell in a separate quarter; but the offspring of the inferior, or of
the better when they chance to be deformed, will be put away in some
mysterious, unknown place, as they should be.

yes, he said, that must be done if the breed of the guardians is to be
kept pure.

they will provide for their nurture, and will bring the mothers to the
fold when they are full of milk, taking the greatest possible care that
no mother recognises her own child; and other wet-nurses may be engaged
if more are required. care will also be taken that the process of
suckling shall not be protracted too long; and the mothers will have no
getting up at night or other trouble, but will hand over all this sort
of thing to the nurses and attendants.

you suppose t

he wives of our guardians to have a fine easy time of it
when they are having children.

why, said i, and so they ought. let us, however, proceed with our
scheme. we were saying that the parents should be in the prime of life?

very true.

and what is the prime of life? may it not be defined as a period of
about twenty years in a woman's life, and thirty in a man's?

which years do you mean to include?

a woman, i said, at twenty years of age may begin to bear children to
the state, and continue to bear them until fort

dfathers and grandmothers. all who were
begotten at the time when their fathers and mothers came together will
be called their brothers and sisters, and these, as i was saying, will
be forbidden to inter-marry. this, however, is not to be understood as
an absolute prohibition of the marriage of brothers and sisters; if the
lot favours them, and they receive the sanction of the pythian oracle,
the law will allow them.

quite right, he replied.

such is the scheme, glaucon, according to which the guardians of our
state are to have their wives and families in common. and now you would
have the argument show that this community is consistent with the rest
of our polity, and also that nothing can be better--would you not?

yes, certainly.

shall we try to find a common basis by asking of ourselves what ought
to be the chief aim of the legislator in making laws and in the
organization of a state,--what is the greatest good, and what is the
greatest evil, and then consider whether our previous descri

states?

generally they call them masters, but in democratic states they simply
call them rulers.

and in our state what other name besides that of citizens do the people
give the rulers?

they are called saviours and helpers, he replied.

and what do the rulers call the people?

their maintainers and foster-fathers.

and what do they call them in other states?

slaves.

and what do the rulers call one another in other states?

fellow-rulers.

and what in ours?

fellow-guardians.

did you ever know an example in any other state of a ruler who would
speak of one of his colleagues as his friend and of another as not being
his friend?

yes, very often.

and the friend he regards and describes as one in whom he has an
interest, and the other as a stranger in whom he has no interest?

exactly.

but would any of your guardians think or speak of any other guardian as
a stranger?

certainly he would not; for every one whom they meet will be regarded
by them either as a brothe

l' or 'it is
ill.'

most true.

and agreeably to this mode of thinking and speaking, were we not saying
that they will have their pleasures and pains in common?

yes, and so they will.

and they will have a common interest in the same thing which they will
alike call 'my own,' and having this common interest they will have a
common feeling of pleasure and pain?

yes, far more so than in other states.

and the reason of this, over and above the general constitution of the
state, will be that the guardians will have a community of women and
children?

that will be the chief reason.

and this unity of feeling we admitted to be the greatest good, as was
implied in our own comparison of a well-ordered state to the relation of
the body and the members, when affected by pleasure or pain?

that we acknowledged, and very rightly.

then the community of wives and children among our citizens is clearly
the source of the greatest good to the state?

certainly.

and this agrees with the other principle whi
 
 ___________________________
 
ch we were affirming,--that
the guardians were not to have houses or lands or any other property;
their pay was to be their food, which they were to receive from the
other citizens, and they were to have no private expenses; for we
intended them to preserve their true character of guardians.

right, he replied.

both the community of property and the community of families, as i am
saying, tend to make them more truly guardians; they will not tear
the city in pieces by differing about 'mine' and 'not mine;' each man
dragging any acquisition which he has made into a separate house of his
own, where he has a separate wife and children and private pleasures and
pains; but all will be affected as far as may be by the same pleasures
and pains because they are all of one opinion about what is near and
dear to them, and therefore they all tend towards a common end.

certainly, he replied.

and as they have nothing but their

yes; and there is a further good in the law; viz. that if a man has a
quarrel with another he will satisfy his resentment then and there, and
not proceed to more dangerous lengths.

certainly.

to the elder shall be assigned the duty of ruling and chastising the
younger.

clearly.

nor can there be a doubt that the younger will not strike or do any
other violence to an elder, unless the magistrates command him; nor will
he slight him in any way. for there are two guardians, shame and fear,
mighty to prevent him: shame, which makes men refrain from laying hands
on those who are to them in the relation of parents; fear, that the
injured one will be succoured by the others who are his brothers, sons,
fathers.

that is true, he replied.

then in every way the laws will help the citizens to keep the peace with
one another?

yes, there will be no want of peace.

and as the guardians will never quarrel among themselves there will be
no danger of the rest of the city be

re complete maintenance at the public
cost. for the victory which they have won is the salvation of the whole
state; and the crown with which they and their children are crowned is
the fulness of all that life needs; they receive rewards from the
hands of their country while living, and after death have an honourable
burial.

yes, he said, and glorious rewards they are.

do you remember, i said, how in the course of the previous discussion
some one who shall be nameless accused us of making our guardians
unhappy--they had nothing and might have possessed all things--to whom
we replied that, if an occasion offered, we might perhaps hereafter
consider this question, but that, as at present advised, we would make
our guardians truly guardians, and that we were fashioning the state
with a view to the greatest happiness, not of any particular class, but
of the whole?

yes, i remember.

and what do you say, now that the life of our protectors is made out to
be far better and nobler than that of olym

pic victors--is the life of
shoemakers, or any other artisans, or of husbandmen, to be compared with
it?

certainly not.

at the same time i ought here to repeat what i have said elsewhere, that
if any of our guardians shall try to be happy in such a manner that
he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content with this safe and
harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but
infatuated by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his
head shall seek to appropriate the whole state to himself, then he will
have to learn how wisely hesiod spoke, when he said, 'half is more than
the whole.'

if he were to consult me, i should say to him: stay where you are, when
you have the offer of such a life.

you agree then, i said, that men and women are to ha

of the artisan's child, they may look on at the work which they will
have to do when they are grown up; and besides looking on they will
have to help and be of use in war, and to wait upon their fathers and
mothers. did you never observe in the arts how the potters' boys look on
and help, long before they touch the wheel?

yes, i have.

and shall potters be more careful in educating their children and in
giving them the opportunity of seeing and practising their duties than
our guardians will be?

the idea is ridiculous, he said.

there is also the effect on the parents, with whom, as with other
animals, the presence of their young ones will be the greatest incentive
to valour.

that is quite true, socrates; and yet if they are defeated, which may
often happen in war, how great the danger is! the children will be lost
as well as their parents, and the state will never recover.

true, i said; but would you never allow them to run any risk?

i am far from saying that.

well, but

other distinctions which we were mentioning; also with

'seats of precedence, and meats and full cups;'

and in honouring them, we shall be at the same time training them.

that, he replied, is excellent.

yes, i said; and when a man dies gloriously in war shall we not say, in
the first place, that he is of the golden race?

to be sure.

nay, have we not the authority of hesiod for affirming that when they
are dead

'they are holy angels upon the earth, authors of good, averters of evil,
the guardians of speech-gifted men'?

yes; and we accept his authority.

we must learn of the god how we are to order the sepulture of divine and
heroic personages, and what is to be their special distinction; and we
must do as he bids?

by all means.

and in ages to come we will reverence them and kneel before their
sepulchres as at the graves of heroes. and not only they but any who are
deemed pre-eminently good, whether they die from age, or in any other
way, shall be admitted to the same honours.

that the guilt of war is always confined to a few persons and that the
many are their friends. and for all these reasons they will be unwilling
to waste their lands and rase their houses; their enmity to them will
only last until the many innocent sufferers have compelled the guilty
few to give satisfaction?

i agree, he said, that our citizens should thus deal with their hellenic
enemies; and with barbarians as the hellenes now deal with one another.

then let us enact this law also for our guardians:--that they are
neither to devastate the lands of hellenes nor to burn their houses.

agreed; and we may agree also in thinking that these, like all our
previous enactments, are very good.

but still i must say, socrates, that if you are allowed to go on in
this way you will entirely forget the other question which at the
commencement of this discussion you thrust aside:--is such an order of
things possible, and how, if at all? for i am quite ready to acknowledge
that the plan which you propos
 
 ___________________________
 
unjust must consider.

and what is the next question? he asked.

surely, i said, the one which follows next in order. inasmuch as
philosophers only are able to grasp the eternal and unchangeable,
and those who wander in the region of the many and variable are not
philosophers, i must ask you which of the two classes should be the
rulers of our state?

and how can we rightly answer that question?

whichever of the two are best able to guard the laws and institutions of
our state--let them be our guardians.

very good.

neither, i said, can there be any question that the guardian who is to
keep anything should have eyes rather than no eyes?

there can be no question of that.

and are not those who are verily and indeed wanting in the knowledge
of the true being of each thing, and who have in their souls no clear
pattern, and are unable as with a painter's eye to look at the absolute
truth and to that original to repair, and having perfect vision of the
other world to order the laws about beauty,
 
 ___________________________
 
 goodness, justice in this,
if not already ordered, and to guard and preserve the order of them--are
not such persons, i ask, simply blind?

truly, he replied, they are much in that condition.

and shall they be our guardians when there are others who, besides being
their equals in experience and falling short of them in no particular of
virtue, also know the very truth of each thing?

there can be no reason, he said, for rejecting those who have this
greatest of all great qualities; they must always have the first place
unless they fail in some other respect.

suppose then, i said, that we determine how far they can unite this and
the other excellences.

by all means.

in the first place, as we began by observing,

to be rejected who failed, but he who always came forth pure, like gold
tried in the refiner's fire, was to be made a ruler, and to receive
honours and rewards in life and after death. this was the sort of thing
which was being said, and then the argument turned aside and veiled her
face; not liking to stir the question which has now arisen.

i perfectly remember, he said.

yes, my friend, i said, and i then shrank from hazarding the bold
word; but now let me dare to say--that the perfect guardian must be a
philosopher.

yes, he said, let that be affirmed.

and do not suppose that there will be many of them; for the gifts which
were deemed by us to be essential rarely grow together; they are mostly
found in shreds and patches.

what do you mean? he said.

you are aware, i replied, that quick intelligence, memory, sagacity,
cleverness, and similar qualities, do not often grow together, and that
persons who possess them and are at the same time high-spirited and
magnanimous are not so cons

 were satisfied or not, it is for you to say.

yes, he said, i thought and the others thought that you gave us a fair
measure of truth.

but, my friend, i said, a measure of such things which in any degree
falls short of the whole truth is not fair measure; for nothing
imperfect is the measure of anything, although persons are too apt to be
contented and think that they need search no further.

not an uncommon case when people are indolent.

yes, i said; and there cannot be any worse fault in a guardian of the
state and of the laws.

true.

the guardian then, i said, must be required to take the longer circuit,
and toil at learning as well as at gymnastics, or he will never reach
the highest knowledge of all which, as we were just now saying, is his
proper calling.

what, he said, is there a knowledge still higher than this--higher than
justice and the other virtues?

yes, i said, there is. and of the virtues too we must behold not the
outline merely, as at present--nothing short of the most f

 a presentiment that there is such an end, and
yet hesitating because neither knowing the nature nor having the same
assurance of this as of other things, and therefore losing whatever
good there is in other things,--of a principle such and so great as this
ought the best men in our state, to whom everything is entrusted, to be
in the darkness of ignorance?

certainly not, he said.

i am sure, i said, that he who does not know how the beautiful and
the just are likewise good will be but a sorry guardian of them; and
i suspect that no one who is ignorant of the good will have a true
knowledge of them.

that, he said, is a shrewd suspicion of yours.

and if we only have a guardian who has this knowledge our state will be
perfectly ordered?

of course, he replied; but i wish that you would tell me whether you
conceive this supreme principle of the good to be knowledge or pleasure,
or different from either?

aye, i said, i knew all along that a fastidious gentleman like you would

ves; then he
will gaze upon the light of the moon and the stars and the spangled
heaven; and he will see the sky and the stars by night better than the
sun or the light of the sun by day?

certainly.

last of all he will be able to see the sun, and not mere reflections of
him in the water, but he will see him in his own proper place, and not
in another; and he will contemplate him as he is.

certainly.

he will then proceed to argue that this is he who gives the season and
the years, and is the guardian of all that is in the visible world, and
in a certain way the cause of all things which he and his fellows have
been accustomed to behold?

clearly, he said, he would first see the sun and then reason about him.

and when he remembered his old habitation, and the wisdom of the den
and his fellow-prisoners, do you not suppose that he would felicitate
himself on the change, and pity them?

certainly, he would.

and if they were in the habit of conferring honours among themselves
on those who were

ting about office, and the civil and domestic broils which thus
arise will be the ruin of the rulers themselves and of the whole state.

most true, he replied.

and the only life which looks down upon the life of political ambition
is that of true philosophy. do you know of any other?

indeed, i do not, he said.

and those who govern ought not to be lovers of the task? for, if they
are, there will be rival lovers, and they will fight.

no question.

who then are those whom we shall compel to be guardians? surely they
will be the men who are wisest about affairs of state, and by whom the
state is best administered, and who at the same time have other honours
and another and a better life than that of politics?

they are the men, and i will choose them, he replied.

and now shall we consider in what way such guardians will be produced,
and how they are to be brought from darkness to light,--as some are said
to have ascended from the world below to the gods?

by all means, he replied.

there were two parts in our former scheme of education, were there not?

just so.

there was gymnastic which presided over the growth and decay of the
body, and may therefore be regarded as having to do with generation and
corruption?

true.

then that is not the knowledge which we are seeking to discover?

no.

but what do you say of music, which also entered to a certain extent
into our former scheme?

music, he said, as you will remember, was the counterpart of gymnastic,
and trained the guardians by the influences of habit, by harmony making
them harmonious, by rhythm rhythmical, but not giving them science; and
the words, whether fabulous or possibly true, had kindred elements of
rhythm and harmony in them. but in music there was nothing which tended
to that good which you are now seeking.

you are most accurate, i said, in your recollection; in music there
certainly was nothing of the kind. but what branch of knowledge is
there, my dear glaucon, which is of the desired nature; since

 calculation have to do with number?

yes.

and they appear to lead the mind towards truth?

yes, in a very remarkable manner.

then this is knowledge of the kind for which we are seeking, having a
double use, military and philosophical; for the man of war must learn
the art of number or he will not know how to array his troops, and the
philosopher also, because he has to rise out of the sea of change and
lay hold of true being, and therefore he must be an arithmetician.

that is true.

and our guardian is both warrior and philosopher?

certainly.

then this is a kind of knowledge which legislation may fitly prescribe;
and we must endeavour to persuade those who are to be the principal men
of our state to go and learn arithmetic, not as amateurs, but they must
carry on the study until they see the nature of numbers with the mind
only; nor again, like merchants or retail-traders, with a view to buying
or selling, but for the sake of their military use, and of the soul
herself; and because this

that, replied glaucon, has been acknowledged.

yes, i said; and we have further acknowledged that the governors, when
appointed themselves, will take their soldiers and place them in houses
such as we were describing, which are common to all, and contain nothing
private, or individual; and about their property, you remember what we
agreed?

yes, i remember that no one was to have any of the ordinary possessions
of mankind; they were to be warrior athletes and guardians, receiving
from the other citizens, in lieu of annual payment, only their
maintenance, and they were to take care of themselves and of the whole
state.

true, i said; and now that this division of our task is concluded, let
us find the point at which we digressed, that we may return into the old
path.

there is no difficulty in returning; you implied, then as now, that you
had finished the description of the state: you said that such a state
was good, and that the man was good who answered to

etc. = 100. for other explanations of the passage see introduction.) two
perfect squares of irrational diameters (of a square the side of which
is five = 50 + 50 = 100); and a hundred cubes of three (27 x 100 = 2700
+ 4900 + 400 = 8000). now this number represents a geometrical figure
which has control over the good and evil of births. for when your
guardians are ignorant of the law of births, and unite bride and
bridegroom out of season, the children will not be goodly or
fortunate. and though only the best of them will be appointed by their
predecessors, still they will be unworthy to hold their fathers' places,
and when they come into power as guardians, they will soon be found
to fail in taking care of us, the muses, first by under-valuing music;
which neglect will soon extend to gymnastic; and hence the young men of

will be appointed who have lost the guardian power of testing the metal
of your different races, which, like hesiod's, are of gold and silver
and brass and iron. and so iron will be mingled with silver, and brass
with gold, and hence there will arise dissimilarity and inequality and
irregularity, which always and in all places are causes of hatred
and war. this the muses affirm to be the stock from which discord has
sprung, wherever arising; and this is their answer to us.

yes, and we may assume that they answer truly.

why, yes, i said,

g to be a ruler, not because he is eloquent, or on any
ground of that sort, but because he is a soldier and has performed feats
of arms; he is also a lover of gymnastic exercises and of the chase.

yes, that is the type of character which answers to timocracy.

such an one will despise riches only when he is young; but as he gets
older he will be more and more attracted to them, because he has a
piece of the avaricious nature in him, and is not single-minded towards
virtue, having lost his best guardian.

who was that? said adeimantus.

philosophy, i said, tempered with music, who comes and takes up her
abode in a man, and is the only saviour of his virtue throughout life.

good, he said.

such, i said, is the timocratical youth, and he is like the timocratical
state.

exactly.

his origin is as follows:--he is often the young son of a brave father,
who dwells in an ill-governed city, of which he declines the honours
and offices, and will not go to law, or exert himself in any way, but is

excellent! i said. yet consider: must we not further admit that owing to
this want of cultivation there will be found in him dronelike desires as
of pauper and rogue, which are forcibly kept down by his general habit
of life?

true.

do you know where you will have to look if you want to discover his
rogueries?

where must i look?

you should see him where he has some great opportunity of acting
dishonestly, as in the guardianship of an orphan.

aye.

it will be clear enough then that in his ordinary dealings which give
him a reputation for honesty he coerces his bad passions by an enforced
virtue; not making them see that they are wrong, or taming them by
reason, but by necessity and fear constraining them, and because he
trembles for his possessions.

yes, indeed, my dear friend, but you will find that the natural desires
of the drone commonly exist in him all the same whenever he has to spend

they draw him to his old associates, and holding secret intercourse with
them, breed and multiply in him.

very true.

at length they seize upon the citadel of the young man's soul, which
they perceive to be void of all accomplishments and fair pursuits and
true words, which make their abode in the minds of men who are dear to
the gods, and are their best guardians and sentinels.

none better.

false and boastful conceits and phrases mount upwards and take their
place.

they are certain to do so.

and so the young man returns into the country of the lotus-eaters, and
takes up his dwelling there in the face of all men; and if any help be
sent by his friends to the oligarchical part of him, the aforesaid vain
conceits shut the gate of the king's fastness; and they will neither
allow the embassy itself to enter, nor if private advisers offer the

son and his undesirable associates.

by heaven, he said, then the parent will discover what a monster he has
been fostering in his bosom; and, when he wants to drive him out, he
will find that he is weak and his son strong.

beat his father if he opposes him?

yes, he will, having first disarmed him.

then he is a parricide, and a cruel guardian of an aged parent; and this
is real tyranny, about which there can be no longer a mistake: as the
saying is, the people who would escape the smoke which is the slavery of
freemen, has fallen into the fire which is the tyranny of slaves. thus
liberty, getting out of all order and reason, passes into the harshest
and bitterest form of slavery.

true, he said.

very well; and may we not rightly say that we have sufficiently
discussed the nature of tyranny, and the manner of the transition from

authority, in order that we may be all, as far as possible, under the
same government, friends and equals.

true, he said.

and this is clearly seen to be the intention of the law, which is the
ally of the whole city; and is seen also in the authority which we
exercise over children, and the refusal to let them be free until we
have established in them a principle analogous to the constitution of
a state, and by cultivation of this higher element have set up in their
hearts a guardian and ruler like our own, and when this is done they may
go their ways.

yes, he said, the purpose of the law is manifest.

from what point of view, then, and on what ground can we say that a man
is profited by injustice or intemperance or other baseness, which will
make him a worse man, even though he acquire money or power by his
wickedness?

from no point of view at all.

what shall he profit, if his injustice be undetected and unpunished?
he who is undetected only gets worse, whereas he who i

all the souls had now chosen their lives, and they went in the order of
their choice to lachesis, who sent with them the genius whom they had
severally chosen, to be the guardian of their lives and the fulfiller
of the choice: this genius led the souls first to clotho, and drew
them within the revolution of the spindle impelled by her hand, thus
ratifying the destiny of each; and then, when they were fastened to
this, carried them to atropos, who spun the threads and made them
irreversible, whence without turning round they passed beneath the
throne of necessity; and when they had all passed, they marched on in a
scorching heat to the plain of forgetfulness, which was a
