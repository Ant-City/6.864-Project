        the king of england. john is the third son of henry ii. his older brother, richard the lionhearted, was king before him. legally, his dead brother geoffrey's son arthur should have become the next king, but john takes the throne because richard appointed him. the legitimacy of his rule is therefore in doubt--but john is happy to go to war to defend himself. however, his indifference to the decrees of the pope and his willingness to steal from the monasteries threaten his rule as much as the question of his legitimacy. but finally, it is his order to have arthur killed that destroys the support of his lords. his robbery of the monasteries leads to his death at the hands of a monk.
