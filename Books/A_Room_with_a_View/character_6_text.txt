â€œeat your dinner, dear. this pension is a failure. to-morrow we will
make a change.â€

hardly had she announced this fell decision when she reversed it. the
curtains at the end of the room parted, and revealed a clergyman, stout
but attractive, who hurried forward to take his place at the table,
cheerfully apologizing for his lateness. lucy, who had not yet acquired
decency, at once rose to her feet, exclaiming: â€œoh, oh! why, itâ€™s
mr. beebe! oh, how perfectly lovely! oh, charlotte, we must stop now,
however bad the rooms are. oh!â€

miss bartlett said, with more restraint:

â€œhow do you do, mr. beebe? i expect that you have forgotten us: miss
bartlett and miss honeychurch, who were at tunbridge wells when you
helped the vicar of st. peterâ€™s that very cold easter.â€

the clergyman, who had the air of one on a holiday, did not remember
the ladies quite as clearly as they remembered him. but he came forward
pleasantly

â€œmiss honeychurch lives in the parish of summer street,â€ said miss
bartlett, filling up the gap, â€œand she happened to tell me in the course
of conversation that you have just accepted the living--â€

â€œyes, i heard from mother so last week. she didnâ€™t know that i knew you
at tunbridge wells; but i wrote back at once, and i said: â€˜mr. beebe

neighbourhood.â€

bowed.

whether she knew florence well, and was informed at some length that she
had never been there before. it is delightful to advise a newcomer, and
he was first in the field. â€œdonâ€™t neglect the country round,â€ his advice
concluded. â€œthe first fine afternoon drive up to fiesole, and round by
settignano, or something of that sort.â€

â€œno!â€ cried a voice from the top of the table. â€œmr. beebe, you are
wrong. the first fine afternoon your ladies must go to prato.â€

â€œthat lady looks so clever,â€ whispered miss bartlett to her cousin. â€œwe
are in luck.â€

and, indeed, a perfect torrent of information burst on them. people told
them what to see, when to see it, how to stop the electric trams, how to
get rid of the beggars, how much to give for a vellum blotter, how
much the place would grow upon them. the pension bertolini had decided,
almost enthusiastically, that they

he first came here he not unnaturally put peopleâ€™s backs up. he has no
tact and no manners--i donâ€™t mean by that that he has bad manners--and
he will not keep his opinions to himself. we nearly complained about
him to our depressing signora, but i am glad to say we thought better of
it.â€

â€œam i to conclude,â€ said miss bartlett, â€œthat he is a socialist?â€

mr. beebe accepted the convenient word, not without a slight twitching
of the lips.

â€œand presumably he has brought up his son to be a socialist, too?â€

â€œi hardly know george, for he hasnâ€™t learnt to talk yet. he seems a nice
creature, and i think he has brains. of course, he has all his fatherâ€™s
mannerisms, and it is quite possible that he, too, may be a socialist.â€

have accepted their offer? you feel i have

didnâ€™t you talk, lucy? he prefers young people, iâ€™m sure. i do hope i
havenâ€™t monopolized him. i hoped you would have him all the evening, as
well as all dinner-time.â€

â€œhe is nice,â€ exclaimed lucy. â€œjust what i remember. he seems to see
good in everyone. no one would take him for a clergyman.â€

â€œmy dear lucia--â€

â€œwell, you know what i mean. and you know how clergymen generally laugh;
mr. beebe laughs just like an ordinary man.â€

â€œfunny girl! how you do remind me of your mother. i wonder if she will
approve of mr. beebe.â€

â€œiâ€™m sure she will; and so will freddy.â€

â€œi think everyone at windy corner will approve; it is the fashionable
world. i am used to tunbridge wells, where we are all hopelessly behind
the times.â€

â€œyes,â€ said lucy despondently.

there was a haze of disapproval in the air, but whether the disapproval
was of herself, or of mr. beebe,

ermine. she tried to locate it, but as usual she blundered. miss
bartlett sedulously denied disapproving of any one, and added â€œi am
afraid you are finding me a very depressing companion.â€

and the girl again thought: â€œi must have been selfish or unkind; i must
be more careful. it is so dreadful for charlotte, being poor.â€

fortunately one of the little old ladies, who for some time had been
smiling very benignly, now approached and asked if she might be allowed
to sit where mr. beebe had sat. permission granted, she began to chatter
gently about italy, the plunge it had been to come there, the gratifying
success of the plunge, the improvement in her sisterâ€™s health, the
necessity of closing the bed-room windows at night, and of thoroughly
emptying the water-bottles in the morning. she handled her subjects
agreeably, and they were, perhaps, more worthy of attention than
the high discourse upon guelfs and ghibellines which was proceeding
tempestuously at the other en

â€œah, then you look into the court.â€ she sighed. â€œif only mr. emerson was
more tactful! we were so sorry for you at dinner.â€

â€œi think he was meaning to be kind.â€

â€œundoubtedly he was,â€ said miss bartlett.

â€œmr. beebe has just been scolding me for my suspicious nature. of
course, i was holding back on my cousinâ€™s account.â€

â€œof course,â€ said the little old lady; and they murmured that one could
not be too careful with a young girl.

lucy tried to look demure, but could not help feeling a great fool. no
one was careful with her at home; or, at all events, she had not noticed
it.

â€œabout old mr. emerson--i hardly know. no, he is not tactful; yet, have
you ever noticed that there are people

indelicate, and yet at the same time--beautiful?â€

â€œbeautiful?â€ said miss bartlett, puzzled at the word. â€œare not beauty
and delicacy the same?â€

â€œso one would have thought,â€ said the other helplessly. â€œbut things are
so difficult, i sometimes think.â€

she proceeded no further into things, for mr. beebe reappeared, looking
extremely pleasant.

â€œmiss bartlett,â€ he cried, â€œitâ€™s all right about the rooms. iâ€™m so glad.
mr. emerson was talking about it in the smoking-room, and knowing what
i did, i encouraged him to make the offer again. he has let me come and
ask you. he would be so pleased.â€

â€œoh, charlotte,â€ cried lucy to her cousin, â€œwe must have the rooms now.
the old man is just as nice and kind as he can be.â€

miss bartlett was silent.

â€œi fear,â€ said mr.

 beebe, after a pause, â€œthat i have been officious. i
must apologize for my interference.â€

gravely displeased, he turned to go. not till then did miss bartlett
reply: â€œmy own wishes, dearest lucy, are unimportant in comparison with
yours. it would be hard indeed if i stopped you doing as you liked at
florence, when i am only here through your kindness. if you wish me to
turn these gentlemen out of their rooms, i will do it. would you then,
mr. beebe, kindly tell mr. emerson that i accept his kind offer, and
then conduct him to me, in order that i may thank him personally?â€

she raised her voice as she spoke; it was heard all over the
drawing-room, and silenced the guelfs and the ghibellines. the
clergyman, inwardly cursing the female sex, bowed, and departed with her
message.

â€œremember, lucy, i alone am implicated in this. i do not wish the
acceptance to come from you. grant me that, at all events.â€

mr. beebe was back, s

mr. emerson is engaged, but here is his son instead.â€

the young man gazed down on the three ladies, who felt seated on the
floor, so low were their chairs.

â€œmy father,â€ he said, â€œis in his bath, so you cannot thank him
personally. but any message given by you to me will be given by me to
him as soon as he comes out.â€

miss bartlett was unequal to the bath. all her barbed civilities came
forth wrong end first. young mr. emerson scored a notable triumph to the
delight of mr. beebe and to the secret delight of lucy.

â€œpoor young man!â€ said miss bartlett, as soon as he had gone.

â€œhow angry he is with his father about the rooms! it is all he can do to
keep polite.â€

â€œin half an hour or so your rooms will be ready,â€ said mr. beebe. then
looking rather thoughtfully at the two cousins, he retired to his own
rooms, to write up his philosophic diary.

â€œoh, dear!â€ breathed the little old lady, and shuddered as if all the
winds of heaven had entered th

â€œi want to explain,â€ said miss bartlett, â€œwhy it is that i have taken
the largest room. naturally, of course, i should have given it to you;
but i happen to know that it belongs to the young man, and i was sure
your mother would not like it.â€

lucy was bewildered.

â€œif you are to accept a favour it is more suitable you should be under
an obligation to his father than to him. i am a woman of the world, in
my small way, and i know where things lead to. however, mr. beebe is a
guarantee of a sort that they will not presume on this.â€

â€œmother wouldnâ€™t mind iâ€™m sure,â€ said lucy, but again had the sense of
larger and unsuspected issues.

miss bartlett only sighed, and enveloped her in a protecting embrace as
she wished her good-night. it gave lucy the sensation of a fog, and when
she reached her own room she opened the window and breathed the clean
night air, thinking of the kind old man who had enabled her to see the
lights dancing in the arno

ano. a few
people lingered round and praised her playing, but finding that she
made no reply, dispersed to their rooms to write up their diaries or
to sleep. she took no notice of mr. emerson looking for his son, nor of
miss bartlett looking for miss lavish, nor of miss lavish looking for
her cigarette-case. like every true performer, she was intoxicated by
the mere feel of the notes: they were fingers caressing her own; and by
touch, not by sound alone, did she come to her desire.

mr. beebe, sitting unnoticed in the window, pondered this illogical
element in miss honeychurch, and recalled the occasion at tunbridge
wells when he had discovered it. it was at one of those entertainments
where the upper classes entertain the lower. the seats were filled with
a respectful audience, and the ladies and gentlemen of the parish, under
the auspices of their vicar, sang, or recited, or imitated the drawing
of a champagne cork. among the promised items was â€œmiss honeychurch.

what the performer intends. with the roar of the opening theme he knew
that things were going extraordinarily; in the chords that herald the
conclusion he heard the hammer strokes of victory. he was glad that she

it was all that one could do.

â€œwho is she?â€ he asked the vicar afterwards.

â€œcousin of one of my parishioners. i do not consider her choice of a
piece happy. beethoven is so usually simple and direct in his appeal
that it is sheer perversity to choose a thing like that, which, if
anything, disturbs.â€

complete it, and looked out absently upon italy in the wet. the whole
life of the south was disorganized, and the most graceful nation in
europe had turned into formless lumps of clothes.

the street and the river were dirty yellow, the bridge was dirty grey,
and the hills were dirty purple. somewhere in their folds were concealed
miss lavish and miss bartlett, who had chosen this afternoon to visit
the torre del gallo.

â€œwhat about music?â€ said mr. beebe.

â€œpoor charlotte will be sopped,â€ was lucyâ€™s reply.

the expedition was typical of miss bartlett, who would return cold,
tired, hungry, and angelic, with a ruined skirt, a pulpy baedeker, and
a tickling cough in her throat. on another day, when the whole world was
singing and the air ran into the mouth, like wine, she would refuse to
stir from the drawing-room, saying that she was an old thing, and no fit
companion for a hearty girl.

â€œmiss lavish has led your cousin astray.

â€œmiss lavish is so original,â€ murmured lucy. this was a stock remark,
the supreme achievement of the pension bertolini in the way of
definition. miss lavish was so original. mr. beebe had his doubts, but
they would have been put down to clerical narrowness. for that, and for
other reasons, he held his peace.

â€œis it true,â€ continued lucy in awe-struck tone, â€œthat miss lavish is
writing a book?â€

â€œthey do say so.â€

â€œwhat is it about?â€

â€œit will be a novel,â€ replied mr. beebe, â€œdealing with modern italy.

herself more admirably than any one i know.â€

n each
otherâ€™s company, with lucy a slighted third. miss lavish he believed
he understood, but miss bartlett might reveal unknown depths of
strangeness, though not perhaps, of meaning. was italy deflecting
her from the path of prim chaperon, which he had assigned to her at
tunbridge wells? all his life he had loved to study maiden ladies;
they were his specialty, and his profession had provided him with ample
opportunities for the work. girls like lucy were charming to look at,
but mr. beebe was, from rather profound reasons, somewhat chilly in his
attitude towards the other sex, and preferred to be interested rather
than enthralled.

lucy, for the third time, said that poor charlotte would be sopped. the
arno was rising in flood, washing away the traces of the little carts
upon the foreshore. but in the south-west there had appeared a dull haze
of yellow, which might mean better weather if it did not mean worse. she
opened the window to inspect, and a cold blast entered th

a plaintive cry from miss catharine alan, who entered at the same moment
by the door.

â€œoh, dear miss honeychurch, you will catch a chill! and mr. beebe here
besides. who would suppose this is italy? there is my sister actually
nursing the hot-water can; no comforts or proper provisions.â€

she sidled towards them and sat down, self-conscious as she always was
on entering a room which contained one man, or a man and one woman.

â€œi could hear your beautiful playing, miss honeychurch, though i was in
my room with the door shut. doors shut; indeed, most necessary. no one
has the least idea of privacy in this country. and one person cat

lucy answered suitably. mr. beebe was not able to tell the ladies of
his adventure at modena, where the chambermaid burst in upon him in his
bath, exclaiming cheerfully, â€œfa niente, sono vecchia.â€ he contented
himself with saying: â€œi quite agree with you, miss alan. the italians
are a most unpleasant people. they pry everywhere, they see everything,
and they know what we want before we know it ourselves. we are at their
mercy. they read our thoughts, they foretell our desires. from the
cab-driver down to--to giotto

, they turn us inside out, and i resent
it. yet in their heart of hearts they are--how superficial! they have no
conception of the intellectual life. how right is signora bertolini, who
exclaimed to me the other day: â€˜ho, mr. beebe, if you knew what i suffer
over the childrenâ€™s edjucaishion. hi wonâ€™t â€˜ave my little victorier
taught by a hignorant italian what canâ€™t explain nothink!â€™â€

miss alan did not follow, but gathered that she was being mocked in an
agreeable way. her sister was a little disappointed in mr. beebe, having
expected better things from a clergyman whose head was bald and who
wore a pair of russet whiskers. indeed, who would have supposed that
tolerance, sympathy, and a sense of humour

 would inhabit that militant
form?

in the midst of her satisfaction she continued to sidle, and at last
the cause was disclosed. from the chair beneath her she extracted
a gun-metal cigarette-case, on which were powdered in turquoise the
initials â€œe. l.â€

â€œthat belongs to lavish.â€ said the clergyman. â€œa good fellow, lavish,
but i wish sheâ€™d start a pipe.â€

â€œoh, mr. beebe,â€ said miss alan, divided between awe and mirth. â€œindeed,
though it is dreadful for her to smoke, it is not quite as dreadful as
you suppose. she took to it, practically in despair, after her
lifeâ€™s work was carried away in a landslip. surely that makes it more
excusable.â€

â€œwhat was that?â€ asked lucy.

mr. beebe sat back complacently, and miss alan began as follows: â€œit was
a novel--and i am afraid, from what i can gather, not a very nice novel.
it is so sad when people

of them.â€

miss alan was always thus being charitable against her better judgement.
a delicate pathos perfumed her disconnected remarks, giving them
unexpected beauty, just as in the decaying autumn woods there sometimes
rise odours reminiscent of spring. she felt she had made almost too many
allowances, and apologized hurriedly for her toleration.

â€œall the same, she is a little too--i hardly like to say unwomanly, but
she behaved most strangely when the emersons arrived.â€

mr. beebe smiled as miss alan plunged into an anecdote which he knew she
would be unable to finish in the presence of a gentleman.

â€œi donâ€™t know, miss honeychurch, if you have noticed that miss pole, the
lady who has so much yellow hair, takes lemonade. that old mr. emerson,
who puts things very strangely--â€

her jaw dropped. she was silent. mr. beebe, whose social resources were
endless, went out to order some tea, and she continued to lucy in a
hasty whisper:

and said: â€˜miss alan, i am going into the smoking-room to talk to those
two nice men. come, too.â€™ needless to say, i refused such an unsuitable
invitation, and she had the impertinence to tell me that it would
broaden my ideas, and said that she had four brothers, all university
men, except one who was in the army, who always made a point of talking
to commercial travellers.â€

â€œlet me finish the story,â€ said mr. beebe, who had returned.

â€œmiss lavish tried miss pole, myself, everyone, and finally said:
â€˜i shall go alone.â€™ she went. at the end of five minutes she returned
unobtrusively with a green baize board, and began playing patience.â€

â€œwhatever happened?â€ cried lucy.

â€œno one knows. no one will ever know. miss lavish will never dare to
tell, and mr. emerson does not think it worth telling.â€

â€œmr. beebe--old mr. emerson, is he nice or not nice? i do so want to

â€œno; but it is so difficult. sometimes he is so silly, and then i do not
mind him. miss alan, what do you think? is he nice?â€

the little old lady shook her head, and sighed disapprovingly. mr.
beebe, whom the conversation amused, stirred her up by saying:

â€œi consider that you are bound to class him as nice, miss alan, after
that business of the violets.â€

like the emersons. they are not nice.â€

mr. beebe smiled nonchalantly. he had made a gentle effort to introduce
the emersons into bertolini society, and the effort had failed. he was
almost the only person who remained friendly to them. miss lavish, who
represented intellect, was avowedly hostile, and now the miss alans,
who stood for good breeding, were following her. miss bartlett, smarting
under an obligation, would scarcely be civil. the case of lucy was
different. she had given him a hazy account of her adventures in santa

lucy, with one eye upon the weather, finally said that she thought the
emersons were nice; not that she saw anything of them now. even their
seats at dinner had been moved.

â€œbut arenâ€™t they always waylaying you to go out with them, dear?â€ said
the little lady inquisitively.

â€œonly once. charlotte didnâ€™t like it, and said something--quite
politely, of course.â€

â€œmost right of her. they donâ€™t understand our ways. they must find their
level.â€

mr. beebe rather felt that they had gone under. they had given up their
attempt--if it was one--to conquer society, and now the father was
almost as silent as the son. he wondered whether he would not plan a
pleasant day for these folk before they left--some expedition, perhaps,
with lucy well chaperoned to be nice to them. it was one of mr. beebeâ€™s
chief pleasures to provide people with happy memories.

bluish-green among the clouds, a few patches of watery light upon the
earth, and then the dripping facade of san miniato shone brilliantly in
the declining sun.

â€œtoo late to go out,â€ said miss alan in a voice of relief. â€œall the
galleries are shut.â€

â€œi think i shall go out,â€ said lucy. â€œi want to go round the town in the
circular tram--on the platform by the driver.â€

her two companions looked grave. mr. beebe, who felt responsible for her
in the absence of miss bartlett, ventured to say:

â€œi wish we could. unluckily i have letters. if you do want to go out
alone, wonâ€™t you be better on your feet?â€

â€œitalians, dear, you know,â€ said miss alan.

â€œperhaps i shall meet someone who reads me through and through!â€

but they still looked disapproval, and she so far conceded to mr. beebe
as to say that she would only go for a little walk, and keep to the
street frequented by tourists

the wind-swept platform of an electric tram. this she might not attempt.

over the incident that had made her faint five minutes before. being
strong physically, she soon overcame the horror of blood. she rose
without his assistance, and though wings seemed to flutter inside her,
she walked firmly enough towards the arno. there a cabman signalled to
them; they refused him.

â€œand the murderer tried to kiss him, you say--how very odd italians

o the courtesy of mr. george emerson. she and miss
lavish had had an adventure also. they had been stopped at the dazio
coming back, and the young officials there, who seemed impudent and
desoeuvre, had tried to search their reticules for provisions. it might
have been most unpleasant. fortunately miss lavish was a match for any
one.

for good or for evil, lucy was left to face her problem alone. none
of her friends had seen her, either in the piazza or, later on, by
the embankment. mr. beebe, indeed, noticing her startled eyes at
dinner-time, had again passed to himself the remark of â€œtoo much
beethoven.â€ but he only supposed that she was ready for an adventure,
not that she had encountered it. this solitude oppressed her; she was
accustomed to have her thoughts confirmed by others or, at all events,
contradicted; it was too dreadful not to know whether she was thinking
right or wrong.

at breakfast next morning she took decisive action. there were two plans
between wh

herself; she had been there in the rain the previous afternoon. but
she thought it an admirable idea for lucy, who hated shopping, changing
money, fetching letters, and other irksome duties--all of which miss
bartlett must accomplish this morning and could easily accomplish alone.

mr. beebe, but i am certainly coming with you. i had much rather.â€

â€œvery well, dear,â€ said miss bartlett, with a faint flush of pleasure
that called forth a deep flush of shame on the cheeks of lucy. how
abominably she behaved to charlotte, now as always! but now she should
alter. all morning she would be really nice to her.

she slipped her arm into her cousinâ€™s, and they started off along the

a few days ago and lucy would have felt the same. but the joys of life
were grouping themselves anew. a drive in the hills with mr. eager and
miss bartlett--even if culminating in a residential tea-party--was
no longer the greatest of them. she echoed the raptures of charlotte
somewhat faintly. only when she heard that mr. beebe was also coming did
her thanks become more sincere.

â€œso we shall be a partie carree,â€ said the chaplain. â€œin these days of
toil and tumult one has great needs of the country and its message of
purity. andate via! andate presto, presto! ah, the town! beautiful as it

â€œi must be going,â€ said he, shutting his eyes and taking out his watch.

miss bartlett thanked him for his kindness, and spoke with enthusiasm of
the approaching drive.

â€œdrive? oh, is our drive to come off?â€

lucy was recalled to her manners, and after a little exertion the
complacency of mr. eager was restored.

â€œbother the drive!â€ exclaimed the girl, as soon as he had departed. â€œit
is just the drive we had arranged with mr. beebe without any fuss at
all. why should he invite us in that absurd manner? we might as well
invite him. we are each paying for ourselves.â€

miss bartlett, who had intended to lament over the emersons, was
launched by this remark into unexpected thoughts.

â€œif that is so, dear--if the drive we and mr. beebe are going with mr.
eager is really the same as the one we are going with mr. beebe, then i
foresee a sad kettle of fish.â€

admirable delicacy â€œwhere things might lead to,â€ but apparently lost
sight of the goal as she approached it. now she was crouching in the
corner trying to extract a circular note from a kind of linen nose-bag
which hung in chaste concealment round her neck. she had been told that
this was the only safe way to carry money in italy; it must only
be broached within the walls of the english bank. as she groped she
murmured: â€œwhether it is mr. beebe who forgot to tell mr. eager, or mr.
eager who forgot when he told us, or whether they have decided to leave
eleanor out altogether--which they could scarcely do--but in any case
we must be prepared. it is you they really want; i am only asked for
appearances. you shall go with the two gentlemen, and i and eleanor will
follow behind. a one-horse carriage would do for us. yet how difficult
it is!â€

earth! do! do!â€

miss bartlett, with equal vivacity, replied:

â€œoh, you droll person! pray, what would become of your drive in the
hills?â€

they passed together through the gaunt beauty of the square, laughing
over the unpractical suggestion.

mr. emerson, mr. george emerson, miss eleanor lavish, miss charlotte
bartlett, and miss lucy honeychurch drive out in carriages to see a
view; italians drive them.

it was phaethon who drove them to fiesole that memorable day, a youth
all irresponsibility and fire, recklessly urging his masterâ€™s horses up
the stony hill. mr. beebe recognized him at once. neither the ages of
faith nor the age of doubt had touched him; he was phaethon in tuscany
driving a

phaethon at once slipped the left rein over her head, thus enabling
himself to drive with his arm round her waist. she did not mind.
mr. eager, who sat with his back to the horses, saw nothing of the
indecorous proceeding, and continued his conversation with lucy. the
other two occupants of the carriage were old mr. emerson and miss
lavish. for a dreadful thing had happened: mr. beebe, without consulting
mr. eager, had doubled the size of the party. and though miss bartlett
and miss lavish had planned all the morning how the people were to sit,
at the critical moment when the carriages came round they lost their
heads, and miss lavish got in with lucy, while miss bartlett, with
george emerson and mr. beebe, followed on behind.

lucy, elegantly dressed in white, sat erect and nervous amid these
explosive ingredients, attentive to mr. eager, repressive towards miss

to a heavy lunch and the drowsy atmosphere of spring. she looked on the

â€œwe must not submit,â€ said mr. eager. â€œi knew he was trying it on. he is
treating us as if we were a party of cookâ€™s tourists.â€

â€œsurely no!â€ said miss lavish, her ardour visibly decreasing.

the other carriage had drawn up behind, and sensible mr. beebe
called out that after this warning the couple would be sure to behave
themselves properly.

â€œleave them alone,â€ mr. emerson begged the chaplain, of whom he stood
in no awe. â€œdo we find happiness so often that we should turn it off the
box when it happens to sit there? to be driven by lovers--a king might
envy us, and if we part them itâ€™s more like sacrilege than anything i

here the voice of miss bartlett was heard saying that a crowd had begun
to collect.

the two elder ladies soon threw off the mask. in the audible whisper
that was now so familiar to lucy they began to discuss, not alessio
baldovinetti, but the drive. miss bartlett had asked mr. george emerson
what his profession was, and he had answered â€œthe railway.â€ she was very
sorry that she had asked him. she had no idea that it would be such a
dreadful answer, or she would not have asked him. mr. beebe had turned
the conversation so cleverly, and she hoped that the young man was not
very much hurt at her asking him.

â€œthe railway!â€ gasped miss lavish. â€œoh, but i shall die! of course it
was the railway!â€ she could not control her mirth. â€œhe is the image of a
porter--on, on the south-eastern.â€

her throat. â€œnow donâ€™t be alarmed; this isnâ€™t a cold. itâ€™s the tiniest
cough, and i have had it three days. itâ€™s nothing to do with sitting
here at all.â€

there was only one way of treating the situation. at the end of five
minutes lucy departed in search of mr. beebe and mr. eager, vanquished
by the mackintosh square.

she addressed herself to the drivers, who were sprawling in the
carriages, perfuming the cushions with cigars. the miscreant, a bony
young man scorched black by the sun, rose to greet her with the courtesy
of a host and the assurance of a relative.

â€œdove?â€ said lucy, after much anxious thought.

his face lit up. of course he knew where. not so far either. his arm
swept three-fourths of the horizon. he should just think he did

where. he pressed his finger-tips to his forehead and then pushed them
towards her, as if oozing with visible extract of knowledge.

more seemed necessary. what was the italian for â€œclergymanâ€?

â€œdove buoni uomini?â€ said she at last.

good? scarcely the adjective for those noble beings! he showed her his
cigar.

â€œuno--piu--piccolo,â€ was her next remark, implying â€œhas the cigar been
given to you by mr. beebe, the smaller of the two good men?â€

she was correct as usual. he tied the horse to a tree, kicked it to make
it stay quiet, dusted the carriage, arranged his hair, remoulded his
hat, encouraged his moustache, and in rather less than a quarter of a
minute was ready to conduct her. italians are born knowing the way. it
would seem that the whole earth lay before them, not as a map, but as a
chess-board, whereon they continually behold the changing pieces as well

chapter vii: they return

some complicated game had been playing up and down the hillside all the
afternoon. what it was and exactly how the players had sided, lucy
was slow to discover. mr. eager had met them with a questioning eye.
charlotte had repulsed him with much small talk. mr. emerson, seeking
his son, was told whereabouts to find him. mr. beebe, who wore the
heated aspect of a neutral, was bidden to collect the factions for the
return home. there was a general sense of groping and bewilderment. pan
had been amongst them--not the great god pan, who has been buried these
two thousand years, but the little god pan, who presides over social
contretemps and unsuccessful picnics. mr. beebe had lost everyone, and
had consumed in solitude the tea-basket which he had brought up as a
pleasant surprise. miss lavish had lost miss bartlett.
 
 ___________________________
 
 lucy had lost mr.
eager. mr. emerson had lost george. miss bartlett had lost a mackintosh
square. phaethon had lost the game.

that last fact was undeniable. he climbed on to the box shivering, with
his collar up, prophesying the swift approach of bad weather. â€œlet us go
immediately,â€ he told them. â€œthe signorino will walk.â€

â€œall the way? he will be hours,â€ said mr. beebe.

â€œapparently. i told him it was unwise.â€ he would look no one in the
face; perhaps defeat was particularly mortifying for him. he alone had
played skilfully, using the whole of his instinct, while the others
had used scraps of their intelligence. he alone had divined what things
were, and what he wished them to be. he alone had interpreted the
message that lucy had received five days before from the lips of a
dying man. persephone, who spends half her life in the grave--she could

under the rug, lucy felt the kindly pressure of her cousinâ€™s hand. at
times our need for a sympathetic gesture is so great that we care
not what exactly it signifies or how much we may have to pay for it
afterwards. miss bartlett, by this timely exercise of her muscles,
gained more than she would have got in hours of preaching or cross
examination.

she renewed it when the two carriages stopped, half into florence.

â€œmr. eager!â€ called mr. beebe. â€œwe want your assistance. will you
interpret for us?â€

â€œgeorge!â€ cried mr. emerson. â€œask your driver which way george went. the
boy may lose his way. he may be killed.â€

â€œgo, mr. eager,â€ said miss bartlett, â€œdonâ€™t ask our driver; our driver is
no help. go and support poor mr. beebe--, he is nearly demented.â€

â€œhe may be killed!â€ cried the old man. â€œhe may be killed!â€

to her. all the way back lucyâ€™s body was shaken by deep sighs, which
nothing could repress.

â€œi want to be truthful,â€ she whispered. â€œit is so hard to be absolutely
truthful.â€

â€œdonâ€™t be troubled, dearest. wait till you are calmer. we will talk it
over before bed-time in my room.â€

so they re-entered the city with hands clasped. it was a shock to the
girl to find how far emotion had ebbed in others. the storm had ceased,
and mr. emerson was easier about his son. mr. beebe had regained good
humour, and mr. eager was already snubbing miss lavish. charlotte alone
she was sure of--charlotte, whose exterior concealed so much insight and
love.

the luxury of self-exposure kept her almost happy through the long
evening. she thought not so much of what had happened as of how she
should describe it. all her sensations, her spasms of courage, her
moments of unreasonable joy, her mysterious discontent, should be
carefully laid before her cousin. and together in di

lucy obeyed. she was in her cousinâ€™s power. she could not modulate out
the key of self-abasement in which she had started. neither of them
referred again to her suggestion that she should speak to george and
settle the matter, whatever it was, with him.

miss bartlett became plaintive.

â€œoh, for a real man! we are only two women, you and i. mr. beebe is
hopeless. there is mr. eager, but you do not trust him. oh, for your
brother! he is young, but i know that his sisterâ€™s insult would rouse
in him a very lion. thank god, chivalry is not yet dead. there are still
left some men who can reverence woman.â€

as she spoke, she pulled off her rings, of which she wore several, and
ranged them upon the pin cushion. then she blew into her gloves and
said:

â€œit will be a push to catch the morning train, but we must try.â€

remained dissatisfied. she added: â€œand he has beautiful manners.â€

â€œi liked him till just now. i suppose itâ€™s having him spoiling lucyâ€™s
first week at home; and itâ€™s also something that mr. beebe said, not

â€œmr. beebe?â€ said his mother, trying to conceal her interest. â€œi donâ€™t

was tilted a little higher than the usual level of vision, he resembled
those fastidious saints who guard the portals of a french cathedral.
well educated, well endowed, and not deficient physically, he
remained in the grip of a certain devil whom the modern world knows
as self-consciousness, and whom the medieval, with dimmer vision,
worshipped as asceticism. a gothic statue implies celibacy, just as
a greek statue implies fruition, and perhaps this was what mr. beebe
meant. and freddy, who ignored history and art, perhaps meant the same
when he failed to imagine cecil wearing another fellowâ€™s cap.

mrs. honeychurch left her letter on the writing table and moved towards
her young acquaintance.

permission. mrs. honeychurch had been civil, but obtuse in essentials,
while as for freddy--â€œhe is only a boy,â€ he reflected. â€œi represent all
that he despises. why should he want me for a brother-in-law?â€

the honeychurches were a worthy family, but he began to realize
that lucy was of another clay; and perhaps--he did not put it very
definitely--he ought to introduce her into more congenial circles as
soon as possible.

â€œmr. beebe!â€ said the maid, and the new rector of summer street was
shown in; he had at once started on friendly relations, owing to lucyâ€™s
praise of him in her letters from florence.

cecil greeted him rather critically.

â€œiâ€™ve come for tea, mr. vyse. do you suppose that i shall get it?â€

â€œi should say so. food is the thing one does get here--donâ€™t sit in that
chair; young honeychurch has left a bone in it.â€

am first in the field. he has bought cissie and albert from mr. flack!â€

â€œhas he indeed?â€ said cecil, trying to recover himself. into what a
grotesque mistake had he fallen! was it likely that a clergyman and a
gentleman would refer to his engagement in a manner so flippant? but his
stiffness remained, and, though he asked who cissie and albert m

determined to shift the subject.

â€œlet me see, mr. vyse--i forget--what is your profession?â€

â€œi have no profession,â€ said cecil. â€œit is another example of my
decadence. my attitude--quite an indefensible one--is that so long as i

enlightened attitude towards philosophy and science.

â€œwhere are the others?â€ said mr. beebe at last, â€œi insist on extracting

â€œi suppose anne never told them you were here. in this house one is so

occasionally he could be quite crude.

â€œi am sorry i have given you a shock,â€ he said dryly. â€œi fear that

â€œnot that. but you ought to have stopped me. i know miss honeychurch

â€œyou are conscious of having said something indiscreet?â€

mr. beebe pulled himself together. really, mr. vyse had the art of
placing one in the most tiresome positions. he was driven to use the
prerogatives of his profession.

â€œno, i have said nothing indiscreet. i foresaw at florence that her
quiet, uneventful childhood must end, and it has ended. i realized dimly
enough that she might take some momentous step. she has taken it. she

also sincere; â€œlet it be your care that her knowledge is profitable to
her.â€

â€œgrazie tante!â€ said cecil, who did not like parsons.

â€œhave you heard?â€ shouted mrs. honeychurch as she toiled up the sloping
garden. â€œoh, mr. beebe, have you heard the news?â€

freddy, now full of geniality, whistled the wedding march. youth seldom
criticizes the accomplished fact.

â€œindeed i have!â€ he cried. he looked at lucy. in her presence he could
not act the parson any longer--at all events not without apology.
â€œmrs. honeychurch, iâ€™m going to do what i am always supposed to do, but
generally iâ€™m too shy. i want to invoke every kind of blessing on

he took his tone from her. there was no more heavy beneficence, no more
attempts to dignify the situation with poetry or the scriptures. none of
them dared or was able to be serious any more.

an engagement is so potent a thing that sooner or later it reduces all
who speak of it to this state of cheerful awe. away from it, in the
solitude of their rooms, mr. beebe, and even freddy, might again be
critical. but in its presence and in the presence of each other they
were sincerely hilarious. it has a strange power, for it compels not
only the lips, but the very heart. the chief parallel to compare one
great thing with another--is the power over us of a temple of some alien
creed. standing outside, we deride or oppose it, or at the most feel
sentimental. inside, though the saints and gods are not ours, we become

so it was that after the gropings and the misgivings of the afternoon
they pulled themselves together and settled down to a very pleasant
tea-party. if they were hypocrites they did not know it, and their
hypocrisy had every chance of setting and of becoming true. anne,
putting down each plate as if it were a wedding present, stimulated them
greatly. they could not lag behind that smile of hers which she gave
them ere she kicked the drawing-room door. mr. beebe chirruped. freddy
was at his wittiest, referring to cecil as the â€œfiascoâ€--family honoured

a mother-in-law. as for lucy and cecil, for whom the temple had been
built, they also joined in the merry ritual, but waited, as earnest
worshippers should, for the disclosure of some holier shrine of joy.



chapter ix: lucy as a work of art

a few days after the engagement was announced mrs. honeychurch made lucy

â€œmy dear cecil, look here.â€ she spread out her knees and perched her
card-case on her lap. â€œthis is me. thatâ€™s windy corner. the rest of the
pattern is the other people. motives are all very well, but the fence
comes here.â€

â€œwe werenâ€™t talking of real fences,â€ said lucy, laughing.

â€œoh, i see, dear--poetry.â€

she leant placidly back. cecil wondered why lucy had been amused.

â€œi tell you who has no â€˜fences,â€™ as you call them,â€ she said, â€œand
thatâ€™s mr. beebe.â€

â€œa parson fenceless would mean a parson defenceless.â€

lucy was slow to follow what people said, but quick enough to detect
what they meant. she missed cecilâ€™s epigram, but grasped the feeling
that prompted it.

â€œdonâ€™t you like mr. beebe?â€ she asked thoughtfully.

â€œi never said so!â€ he cried. â€œi consider him far above the average. i
only denied--â€ and he swept off on the subject of fences again, and was
brilliant.

â€œnow, a clergyman that i do hate,â€ sa

in height (the shepherd sang). in height and in the splendour of the
hills?â€™ let us take mrs. honeychurchâ€™s advice and hate clergymen no
more. whatâ€™s this place?â€

â€œsummer street, of course,â€ said lucy, and roused herself.

the woods had opened to leave space for a sloping triangular meadow.
pretty cottages lined it on two sides, and the upper and third side was
occupied by a new stone church, expensively simple, a charming shingled
spire. mr. beebeâ€™s house was near the church. in height it scarcely
exceeded the cottages. some great mansions were at hand, but they were
hidden in the trees. the scene suggested a swiss alp rather than the
shrine and centre of a leisured world, and was marred only by two ugly
little villas--the villas that had competed with cecilâ€™s engagement,
having been acquired by sir harry otway the very afternoon that lucy had
been acquired by cecil.

neighbour, and roused herself to stop him.

â€œsir harry!â€ she exclaimed, â€œi have an idea. how would you like
spinsters?â€

â€œmy dear lucy, it would be splendid. do you know any such?â€

â€œyes; i met them abroad.â€

â€œgentlewomen?â€ he asked tentatively.

â€œyes, indeed, and at the present moment homeless. i heard from them last
week--miss teresa and miss catharine alan. iâ€™m really not joking. they
are quite the right people. mr. beebe knows them, too. may i tell them
to write to you?â€

â€œindeed you may!â€ he cried. â€œhere we are with the difficulty solved
already. how delightful it is! extra facilities--please tell them they
shall have extra facilities, for i shall have no agentsâ€™ fees. oh,
the agents! the appalling people they have sent me! one woman, when
i wrote--a tactful letter, you know--asking her to explain her social
position to me, replied that she would pay the rent in advance. as
if one cares abou

 quite true,â€ said lucy, though she felt
discouraged. â€œi wonder whether--whether it matters so very much.â€

â€œit matters supremely. sir harry is the essence of that garden-party.
oh, goodness, how cross i feel! how i do hope heâ€™ll get some vulgar
tenant in that villa--some woman so really vulgar that heâ€™ll notice
it. gentlefolks! ugh! with his bald head and retreating chin! but letâ€™s
forget him.â€

this lucy was glad enough to do. if cecil disliked sir harry otway and
mr. beebe, what guarantee was there that the people who really mattered
to her would escape? for instance, freddy. freddy was neither clever,
nor subtle, nor beautiful, and what prevented cecil from saying, any
minute, â€œit would be wrong not to loathe freddyâ€? and what would she
reply? further than freddy she did not go, but he gave her anxiety
enough. she could only assure herself that cecil had known freddy some
time, and that they had always got on pleasantly, except, perhaps,
during the la

r heart refused to despise it entirely. nor did he realize
a more important point--that if she was too great for this society, she
was too great for all society, and had reached the stage where personal
intercourse would alone satisfy her. a rebel she was, but not of the
kind he understood--a rebel who desired, not a wider dwelling-room, but
equality beside the man she loved. for italy was offering her the most
priceless of all possessions--her own soul.

playing bumble-puppy with minnie beebe, niece to the rector, and
aged thirteen--an ancient and most honourable game, which consists in
striking tennis-balls high into the air, so that they fall over the net
and immoderately bounce; some hit mrs. honeychurch; others are lost. the
sentence is confused, but the better illustrates lucyâ€™s state of mind,
for she was trying to talk to mr. beebe at the same time.

â€œoh, it has been such a nuisance--first he, then they--no one knowing
what they wanted, and everyone so tiresome.â€

â€œbut they really are coming now,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œi wrote to miss
teresa a few days ago--she was wondering how often the butcher called,
and my reply of once a month must have impressed her favourably. they
are coming. i heard from them this morning.

â€œi shall hate those miss alans!â€ mrs. honeychurch cried. â€œjust because
theyâ€™re old and silly oneâ€™s expected to say â€˜how sweet!â€™ i hate
their â€˜ifâ€™-ing and â€˜butâ€™-ing and â€˜andâ€™-ing. and poor lucy--serve her

â€œno, he doesnâ€™t.â€

â€œwell; he bounces better than the beautiful white devil.â€

â€œhush, dear,â€ said mrs. honeychurch.

â€œbut look at lucy--complaining of saturn, and all the timeâ€™s got the
beautiful white devil in her hand, ready to plug it in. thatâ€™s right,
minnie, go for her--get her over the shins with the racquet--get her
over the shins!â€

lucy fell, the beautiful white devil rolled from her hand.

mr. beebe picked it up, and said: â€œthe name of this ball is vittoria
corombona, please.â€ but his correction passed unheeded.

freddy possessed to a high degree the power of lashing little girls
to fury, and in half a minute he had transformed minnie from a
well-mannered child into a howling wilderness. up in the house cecil
heard them, and, though he was full of entertaining news, he did not
come down to impart it, in case he got hurt. he was not a coward and
bore necessary pain as well as an

violence of the young. how right it was! sure enough it ended in a cry.

â€œi wish the miss alans could see this,â€ observed mr. beebe, just as
lucy, who was nursing the injured minnie, was in turn lifted off her
feet by her brother.

â€œwho are the miss alans?â€ freddy panted.

â€œthey have taken cissie villa.â€

â€œthat wasnâ€™t the name--â€

here his foot slipped, and they all fell most agreeably on to the grass.
an interval elapses.

â€œwasnâ€™t what name?â€ asked lucy, with her brotherâ€™s head in her lap.

â€œalan wasnâ€™t the name of the people sir harryâ€™s let to.â€

â€œnonsense, freddy! you know

™m always right. iâ€™m quite uneasy at
being always right so often.â€

â€œitâ€™s only another muddle of freddyâ€™s. freddy doesnâ€™t even know the name
of the people he pretends have taken it instead.â€

â€œyes, i do. iâ€™ve got it. emerson.â€

â€œwhat name?â€

â€œemerson. iâ€™ll bet you anything you like.â€

â€œwhat a weathercock sir harry is,â€ said lucy quietly. â€œi wish i had
never bothered over it at all.â€

then she lay on her back and gazed at the cloudless sky. mr. beebe,
whose opinion of her rose daily, whispered to his niece that that was
the proper way to behave if any little thing went wrong.

meanwhile the name of the new tenants had diverted mrs. honeychurch from
the contemplation of her own abilities.

â€œemerson, freddy? do you know what emersons they are?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know whether theyâ€™re any emersons,â€ retorted freddy, who was
democratic. like his sister and like most young people, he was naturally
attracted by the idea of equality,

itâ€™s a new bad habit youâ€™re getting into.â€

â€œbut has cecil--â€

â€œfriends of cecilâ€™s,â€ he repeated, â€œâ€˜and so really dee-sire-rebel. ahem!
honeychurch, i have just telegraphed to them.â€™â€

she got up from the grass.

it was hard on lucy. mr. beebe sympathized with her very much. while she
believed that her snub about the miss alans came from sir harry otway,
she had borne it like a good girl. she might well â€œscreechâ€ when
she heard that it came partly from her lover. mr. vyse was a
tease--something worse than a tease: he took a malicious pleasure
in thwarting people. the clergyman, knowing this, looked at miss
honeychurch with more than his usual kindness.

when she exclaimed, â€œbut cecilâ€™s emersons--they canâ€™t possibly

blue--vases and jugs--and the story ends with â€˜so ungentlemanly and yet
so beautiful.â€™ it is all very difficult. yes, i always connect those
florentine emersons with violets.â€

â€œfiascoâ€™s done you this time,â€ remarked freddy, not seeing that his
sisterâ€™s face was very red. she could not recover herself. mr. beebe saw
it, and continued to divert the conversation.

â€œthese particular emersons consisted of a father and a son--the son
a goodly, if not a good young man; not a fool, i fancy, but very
immature--pessimism, et cetera. our special joy was the father--such a
sentimental darling, and people declared he had murdered his wife.â€

in his normal state mr. beebe would never have repeated such gossip,
but he was trying to shelter lucy in her little trouble. he repeated any
rubbish that came i

on playing bumble-puppy. really, the pension bertolini must have been
the oddest place. thatâ€™s the second murderer iâ€™ve heard of as being
there. whatever was charlotte doing to stop? by-the-by, we really must
ask charlotte here some time.â€

mr. beebe could recall no second murderer. he suggested that his hostess
was mistaken. at the hint of opposition she warmed. she was perfectly
sure that there had been a second tourist of whom the same story had
been told. the name escaped her. what was the name? oh, what was the
name? she clasped her knees for the name. something in thackeray. she
struck her matronly forehead.

lucy asked her brother whether cecil was in.

â€œoh, donâ€™t go!â€ he cried, and tried to catch her by the ankles.

the comic muse, though able to look after her own interests, did not
disdain the assistance of mr. vyse. his idea of bringing the emersons to
windy corner struck her as decidedly good, and she carried through the
negotiations without a hitch. sir harry otway signed the agreement,
met mr. emerson, who was duly disillusioned. the miss alans were
duly offended, and wrote a dignified letter to lucy, whom they held
responsible for the failure. mr. beebe planned pleasant moments for the
new-comers, and told mrs. honeychurch that freddy must call on them as
soon as they arrived. indeed, so ample was the museâ€™s equipment that she
permitted mr. harris, never a very robust criminal, to droop his head,
to be forgotten, and to die.

because there are hills--lucy was at first plunged into despair, but
settled after a little thought that it did not matter the very least.

chapter xii: twelfth chapter

it was a saturday afternoon, gay and brilliant after abundant rains, and
the spirit of youth dwelt in it, though the season was now autumn. all
that was gracious triumphed. as the motorcars passed through summer
street they raised only a little dust, and their stench was soon
dispersed by the wind and replaced by the scent of the wet birches or
of the pines. mr. beebe, at leisure for lifeâ€™s amenities, leant over his
rectory gate. freddy leant by him, smoking a pendant pipe.

â€œsuppose we go and hinder those new people opposite for a little.â€

â€œmâ€™m.â€

â€œthey might amuse you.â€

freddy, whom his fellow-creatures never amused, suggested that the new
people might be feeling a bit busy, and so on, since they had only just
moved in.

â€œi suggested we should hinder them,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œthey are worth
it.â€ unlatching the gate, he

which much squalor was visible.

a grave voice replied, â€œhullo!â€

â€œiâ€™ve brought someone to see you.â€

â€œiâ€™ll be down in a minute.â€

the passage was blocked by a wardrobe, which the removal men had failed
to carry up the stairs. mr. beebe edged round it with difficulty. the
sitting-room itself was blocked with books.

â€œare these people great readers?â€ freddy whispered. â€œare they that
sort?â€

â€œi fancy they know how to read--a rare accomplishment. what have they
got? byron. exactly. a shropshire lad. never heard of it. the way of
all flesh. never heard of it. gibbon. hullo! dear george reads german.

â€œi know. isnâ€™t it jolly? i like that. iâ€™m certain thatâ€™s the old manâ€™s

â€œhow very odd of him!â€

mr. beebe ignored the remark.

now, mother thinks. she will read all kinds of books.â€

â€œso will you.â€

george ran down-stairs and pushed them into the room without speaking.

â€œlet me introduce mr. honeychurch, a neighbour.â€

then freddy hurled one of the thunderbolts of youth. perhaps he was shy,
perhaps he was friendly, or perhaps he thought that georgeâ€™s face wanted
washing. at all events he greeted him with, â€œhow dâ€™ye do? come and have
a bathe.â€

â€œoh, all right,â€ said george, impassive.

mr. beebe was highly entertained.

â€œâ€˜how dâ€™ye do? how dâ€™ye do? come and have a bathe,â€™â€ he chuckled.
â€œthatâ€™s the best conversational opening iâ€™ve ever heard. but iâ€™m afraid
it will only act between men. can you picture a lady who has been
introduced to another lady by a third lady opening civilities with â€˜how
do you do? come and have a batheâ€™? and yet you will tell me that the
sexes are equal.â€

â€œi tell you that they shall be,â€ said mr. emerson, who had been slowly

â€œwe are to raise ladies to our level?â€ the clergyman inquired.

â€œthe garden of eden,â€ pursued mr. emerson, still descending, â€œwhich you
place in the past, is really yet to come. we shall enter it when we no
longer despise our bodies.â€

mr. beebe disclaimed placing the garden of eden anywhere.

â€œin this--not in other things--we men are ahead. we despise the body
less than women do. but not until we are comrades shall we enter the
garden.â€

â€œi say, what about this bathe?â€ murmured freddy, appalled at the mass of
philosophy that was approaching him.

â€œi believed in a return to nature once. but how can we return to
nature when we have never been with her? to-day, i believe that we must

â€œnot a bit!â€ mumbled freddy. â€œi must--that is to say, i have to--have
the pleasure of calling on you later on, my mother says, i hope.â€

â€œcall, my lad? who taught us that drawing-room twaddle? call on your
grandmother! listen to the wind among the pines! yours is a glorious
country.â€

mr. beebe came to the rescue.

â€œmr. emerson, he will call, i shall call; you or your son will return
our calls before ten days have elapsed. i trust that you have realized
about the ten daysâ€™ interval. it does not count that i helped you with
the stair-eyes yesterday. it does not count that they are going to bathe
this afternoon.â€

george bowed his head, dusty and sombre, exhaling the peculiar smell of
one who has handled furniture.

â€œdo you really want this bathe?â€ freddy asked him. â€œit is only a pond,
donâ€™t you know. i dare say you are used to something better.â€

â€œyes--i have said â€˜yesâ€™ already.â€

mr. beebe felt bound to assist his young friend, and led the way out
of the house and into the pine-woods. how glorious it was! for a little
time the voice of old mr. emerson pursued them dispensing good wishes
and philosophy. it ceased, and they only heard the fair wind blowing the
bracken and the trees. mr. beebe, who could be silent, but who could not
bear silence, was compelled to chatter, since the expedition looked like
a failure, and neither of his companions would utter a word. he spoke of

friends. this narrows the field immeasurably we meet again in it.â€

â€œit is fate that i am here,â€ persisted george. â€œbut you can call it
italy if it makes you less unhappy.â€

mr. beebe slid away from such heavy treatment of the subject. but he was
infinitely tolerant of the young, and had no desire to snub george.

â€œand so for this and for other reasons my â€˜history of coincidenceâ€™ is
still to write.â€

wishing to round off the episode, he added; â€œwe are all so glad that you

they climbed down a slippery bank of pine-needles. there lay the pond,
set in its little alp of green--only a pond, but large enough to contain
the human body, and pure enough to reflect the sky. on account of the
rains, the waters had flooded the surrounding grass, which showed like a
beautiful emerald path, tempting these feet towards the central pool.

â€œitâ€™s distinctly successful, as ponds go,â€ said mr. beebe. â€œno apologies
are necessary for the pond.â€

george sat down where the ground was dry, and drearily unlaced his
boots.

â€œmr. beebe, arenâ€™t you bathing?â€ called freddy, as he stripped himself.

mr. beebe thought he was not.

â€œwaterâ€™s wonderful!â€ cried freddy, prancing in.

â€œwaterâ€™s water,â€ murmured george. wetting his hair first--a sure sign of
apathy--he followed freddy into the divine, as indifferent as if he were
a statue and the pond a pail of soapsuds. it was necessary to use his
muscles. it was necessary to keep clean. mr. beebe watched them, and
watched the seeds of the willow-herb dance chorically above their heads.

â€œapooshoo, apooshoo, apooshoo,â€ went freddy, swimming for two strokes in
either direction, and then becoming involved in reeds or mud.

â€œis it worth it?â€ asked the other, michelangelesque on the flooded
margin.

the bank broke away, and he fell into the pool before he had weighed the
question properly.

â€œhee-poof--iâ€™ve swallowed a pollywog, mr. beebe, waterâ€™s wonderful,

â€œapooshoo, kouf.â€

mr. beebe, who was hot, and who always acquiesced where possible, looked
around him. he could detect no parishioners except the pine-trees,
rising up steeply on all sides, and gesturing to each other against
the blue. how glorious it was! the world of motor-cars and rural deans
receded inimitably. water, sky, evergreens, a wind--these things not
even the seasons can touch, and surely they lie beyond the intrusion of
man?

â€œi may as well wash tooâ€; and soon his garments made a third little pil

there very much of it, and, as freddy
said, it reminded one of swimming in a salad. the three gentlemen
rotated in the pool breast high, after the fashion of the nymphs in
gotterdammerung. but either because the rains had given a freshness or
because the sun was shedding a most glorious heat, or because two of the
gentlemen were young in years and the third young in spirit--for some
reason or other a change came over them, and they forgot italy and
botany and fate. they began to play. mr. beebe and freddy splashed each
other. a little deferentially, they splashed george. he was quiet: they
feared they had offended him. then all the forces of youth burst out. he
smiled, flung himself at them, splashed them, ducked them, kicked them,
muddied them, and drove them out of the pool.

â€œrace you round it, then,â€ cried freddy, and they raced in the sunshine,
and george took a short cut and dirtied his shins, and had to bathe a
second time. then mr. beebe consented to run--a memorab

freddy with a clerical waistcoat under his arm, george with a wide-awake
hat on his dripping hair.

â€œthatâ€™ll do!â€ shouted mr. beebe, remembering that after all he was in
his own parish. then his voice changed as if every pine-tree was a rural
dean. â€œhi! steady on! i see people coming you fellow

yells, and widening circles over the dappled earth.

â€œhi! hi! ladies!â€

neither george nor freddy was truly refined. still, they did not hear
mr. beebeâ€™s last warning or they would have avoided mrs. honeychurch,
cecil, and lucy, who were walking down to call on old mrs. butterworth.
freddy dropped the waistcoat at their feet, and dashed into some
bracken. george whooped in their faces, turned and scudded away down the
path to the pond, still clad in mr. beebeâ€™s hat.

â€œgracious alive!â€ cried mrs. honeychurch. â€œwhoever were those
unfortunate people? oh, dears, look away! and poor mr. beebe, too!
whatever has happened?â€

â€œcome this way immediately,â€ commanded cecil, who always felt that he
must lead women, though he knew not whither, and protect them, though he
knew not against what. he led them now towards the bracken where freddy
sat concealed.

â€œoh, poor mr. beebe! was that his waistcoat we left in the path? cecil,

â€œno business of ours,â€ said cecil, glancing at lucy, who was all parasol
and evidently â€˜minded.â€™

â€œi fancy mr. beebe jumped back into the pond.â€

â€œthis way, please, mrs. honeychurch, this way.â€

they followed him up the bank attempting the tense yet nonchalant
expression that is suitable for ladies on such occasions.

â€œwell, i canâ€™t help it,â€ said a voice close ahead, and freddy reared a
freckled face and a pair of snowy shoulders out of the fronds. â€œi canâ€™t
be trodden on, can i?â€

â€œgood gracious me, dear; so itâ€™s you! what miserable management! why not

beebe! how unfortunate again--â€

for mr. beebe was just crawling out of the pond, on whose surface
garments of an intimate nature did float; while george, the world-weary
george, shouted to freddy that he had hooked a fish.

â€œand me, iâ€™ve swallowed one,â€ answered he of the bracken. â€œiâ€™ve
swallowed a pollywog. it wriggleth in my tummy. i shall die--emerson you
beast, youâ€™ve got on my bags.â€

shocked. â€œand do be sure you dry yourselves thoroug

reddy played at â€œthis year, next year, now, never,â€ with his
plum-stones, and lucy artfully fed the flames of her motherâ€™s wrath. but
soon the conflagration died down, and the ghosts began to gather in the
darkness. there were too many ghosts about. the original ghost--that
touch of lips on her cheek--had surely been laid long ago; it could be
nothing to her that a man had kissed her on a mountain once. but it
had begotten a spectral family--mr. harris, miss bartlettâ€™s letter,
mr. beebeâ€™s memories of violets--and one or other of these was bound to
haunt her before cecilâ€™s very eyes. it was miss bartlett who returned
now, and with appalling vividness.

â€œi have been thinking, lucy, of that letter of charlotteâ€™s. how is she?â€

â€œi tore the thing up.â€

â€œdidnâ€™t she say how she was? how does she sound? cheerful?â€

â€œmother, no!â€ she pleaded. â€œitâ€™s impossible. we canâ€™t have charlotte on
the top of the other things; weâ€™re squeezed to death as it is. freddyâ€™s

cecil; george made her nervous; will the reader explain to her that the

the meeting at the rectory had passed off well enough. standing between
mr. beebe and cecil, she had made a few temperate allusions to italy,
and george had replied. she was anxious to show that she was not shy,
and was glad that he did not seem shy either.

â€œa nice fellow,â€ said mr. beebe afterwards â€œhe will work off his
crudities in time. i rather mistrust young men who slip into life

clearest directions, miss bartlett contrived to bungle her arrival.
she was due at the south-eastern station at dorking, whither mrs.
honeychurch drove to meet her. she arrived at the london and brighton
station, and had to hire a cab up. no one was at home except freddy
and his friend, who had to stop their tennis and to entertain her for
a solid hour. cecil and lucy turned up at four oâ€™clock, and these, with
little minnie beebe, made a somewhat lugubrious sextette upon the upper
lawn for tea.

â€œi shall never forgive myself,â€ said miss bartlett, who kept on rising
from her seat, and had to be begged by the united company to remain.
â€œi have upset everything. bursting in on young people! but i insist on
paying for my cab up. grant that, at any rate.â€

â€œour visitors never do such dreadful things,â€ said lucy, while her
brother, in whose memory the boiled egg had already grown unsubstantial,
exclaimed

miss bartlett, who was poor at figures, became bewildered and rendered
up the sovereign, amidst the suppressed gurgles of the other youths. for
a moment cecil was happy. he was playing at nonsense among his peers.
then he glanced at lucy, in whose face petty anxieties had marred the
smiles. in january he would rescue his leonardo from this stupefying
twaddle.

â€œbut i donâ€™t see that!â€ exclaimed minnie beebe who had narrowly watched
the iniquitous transaction. â€œi donâ€™t see why mr. vyse is to have the
quid.â€

â€œbecause of the fifteen shillings and the five,â€ they said solemnly.
â€œfifteen shillings and five shillings make one pound, you see.â€

â€œbut i donâ€™t see--â€

they tried to stifle her with cake.

â€œno, thank you. iâ€™m done. i donâ€™t see why--freddy, donâ€™t poke me. miss

the sun rose higher on its journey, guided, not by phaethon, but by
apollo, competent, unswerving, divine. its rays fell on the ladies
whenever they advanced towards the bedroom windows; on mr. beebe down
at summer street as he smiled over a letter from miss catharine alan; on
george emerson cleaning his fatherâ€™s boots; and lastly, to complete the
catalogue of memorable things, on the red book mentioned previously. the
ladies move, mr. beebe moves, george moves, and movement may engender
shadow. but this book lies motionless, to be caressed all the morning
by the sun and to raise its covers slightly, as though acknowledging the
caress.

and son smoking in the garden.

â€œintroduce me,â€ said her mother. â€œunless the young man considers that he
knows me already.â€

he probably did; but lucy ignored the sacred lake and introduced them
formally. old mr. emerson claimed her with much warmth, and said how
glad he was that she was going to be married. she said yes, she was glad
too; and then, as miss bartlett and minnie were lingering behind with
mr. beebe, she turned the conversation to a less disturbing topic, and
asked him how he liked his new house.

â€œvery much,â€ he replied, but there was a note of offence in his voice;
she had never known him offended before. he added: â€œwe find, though,
that the miss alans were coming, and that we have turned them out. women
mind such a thing. i am very much upset about it.â€

â€œi believe that there was some misunderstanding,â€ said mrs. honeychurch
uneasily.

pleased.â€

he thanked her, but the walk sounded rather far; he could only potter
about in these days.

she turned to george: â€œand then he wants to give up his house to the
miss alans.â€

â€œi know,â€ said george, and put his arm round his fatherâ€™s neck. the
kindness that mr. beebe and lucy had always known to exist in him came
out suddenly, like sunlight touching a vast landscape--a touch of the
morning sun? she remembered that in all his perversities he had never
spoken against affection.

miss bartlett approached.

â€œyou know our cousin, miss bartlett,â€ said mrs. honeychurch pleasantly.
â€œyou met her with my daughter in florence.â€

â€œyes, indeed!â€ said the old man, and made as if he would come out of the
garden to meet the lady. miss bartlett prompt

me. i shall never forget your insight; and, dear, i only blame you for
this: you might have warned me in the early stages, before you felt
you wouldnâ€™t marry me, and so have given me a chance to improve. i have

windy corner lay, not on the summit of the ridge, but a few hundred feet
down the southern slope, at the springing of one of the great buttresses
that supported the hill. on either side of it was a shallow ravine,
filled with ferns and pine-trees, and down the ravine on the left ran
the highway into the weald.

dispositions of the earth, and, poised in the middle of them,

house â€œdid,â€ for it was the home of people who loved their surroundings
honestly. other houses in the neighborhood had been built by expensive
architects, over others their inmates had fidgeted sedulously, yet all
these suggested the accidental, the temporary; while windy corner seemed
as inevitable as an ugliness of natureâ€™s own creation. one might laugh
at the house, but one never shuddered. mr. beebe was bicycling over
this monday afternoon with a piece of gossip. he had heard from the miss
alans. these admirable ladies, since they could not go to cissie villa,
had changed their plans. they were going to greece instead.

â€œsince florence did my poor sister so much good,â€ wrote miss catharine,
â€œwe do not see why we should not try athens this winter. of course,
athens is a plunge, and the doctor has ordered her special digestive
bread; but, after all, we can take that with us, an

further than athens, but if you knew of a really comfortable pension at
constantinople, we should be so grateful.â€

lucy would enjoy this letter, and the smile with which mr. beebe greeted
windy corner was partly for her. she would see the fun of it, and some
of its beauty, for she must see some beauty. though she was hopeless
about pictures, and though she dressed so unevenly--oh, that cerise
frock yesterday at church!--she must see some beauty in life, or she
could not play the piano as she did. he had a theory that musicians are
incredibly complex, and know far less than other artists what they want
and what they are; that they puzzle themselves as well as their

miss honeychurch saw anything beautiful in the desire of two old ladies
to visit athens.

a carriage was drawn up outside windy corner, and just as he caught
sight of the house it started, bowled up the drive, and stopped abruptly
when it reached the main road. therefore it must be the horse, who
always expected people to walk up the hill in case they tired him. the
door opened obediently, and two men emerged, whom mr. beebe recognized
as cecil and freddy. they were an odd couple to go driving; but he saw
a trunk beside the coachmanâ€™s legs. cecil, who wore a bowler, must be
going away, while freddy (a cap)--was seeing him to the station. they
walked rapidly, taking the short cuts, and reached the summit while the
carriage was still pursuing the windings of the road.

they shook hands with the clergyman, but did not speak.

â€œso youâ€™re off for a minute, mr. vyse?â€ he asked.

cecil said, â€œyes,â€

do nothing but play lawn tennis, and say that romance is dead, while the
miss alans are struggling with all the weapons of propriety against the
terrible thing. â€˜a really comfortable pension at constantinople!â€™ so
they call it out of decency, but in their hearts they want a pension
with magic windows opening on the foam of perilous seas in fairyland
forlorn! no ordinary view will content the miss alans. they want the
pension keats.â€

â€œiâ€™m awfully sorry to interrupt, mr. beebe,â€ said freddy, â€œbut have you
any matches?â€

â€œi have,â€ said cecil, and it did not escape mr. beebeâ€™s notice that he
spoke to the boy more kindly.

â€œnever.â€

â€œperhaps they wonâ€™t want me down there.â€

â€œno--go on. good-bye.â€

â€œthank goodness!â€ exclaimed mr. beebe to himself, and struck the saddle
of his bicycle approvingly, â€œit was the one foolish thing she ever
did. oh, what a glorious riddance!â€ and, after a little thought, he
negotiated the slope into windy corner, light of heart. the house was

while miss bartlett, unsuitably dressed, impeded her with offers of
assistance. at a little distance stood minnie and the â€œgarden-child,â€ a
minute importation, each holding either end of a long piece of bass.

â€œoh, how do you do, mr. beebe? gracious what a mess everything is! look
at my scarlet pompoms, and the wind blowing your skirts about, and the
ground so hard that not a prop will stick in, and then the carriage

conveying that more than dahlias had been broken off by the autumn

mr. beebe, who was an adept at relieving situations, invited miss
bartlett to accompany them to this mild festivity.

â€œyes, charlotte, i donâ€™t want you--do go; thereâ€™s nothing to stop about
for, either in the house or out of it.â€

miss bartlett said that her duty lay in the dahlia bed, but when she had

exasperated minnie by an acceptance. as they walked up the garden, the

of his heart, he thought them silly little things.

lucy passed into schumann.

thought that she would like him to be told.

â€œi am very sorry for that,â€ said mr. beebe with feeling.

mrs. honeychurch, who hated all changes, did mind, but not nearly as
much as her daughter pretended, and only for the minute. it was really
a ruse of lucyâ€™s to justify her despondency--a ruse of which she was not
herself conscious, for she was marching in the armies of darkness.

â€œoh, not italy, but constantinople. i have always longed to go to
constantinople. constantinople is practically asia, isnâ€™t it?â€

mr. beebe reminded her that constantinople was still unlikely, and that
the miss alans only aimed at athens, â€œwith delphi, perhaps, if the roads
are safe.â€ but this made no difference to her enthusiasm. she had always
longed to go to greece even more, it seemed. he saw, to his surprise,
that she was apparently serious.

â€œi didnâ€™t realize that you and the miss alans were still such friends,
after cissie villa.â€

â€œdonâ€™t you see that i have to go away? i didnâ€™t realize at the time--and
of course i want to see constantinople so particularly.â€

â€œyou mean that since you have broken off your engagement you feel--â€

â€œyes, yes. i knew youâ€™d understand.â€

mr. beebe did not quite understand. why could not miss honeychurch
repose in the bosom of her family? cecil had evidently taken up the
dignified line, and was not going to annoy her. then it struck him that
her family itself might be annoying. he hinted this to her, and she
accepted the hint eagerly.

â€œyes, of course; to go to constantinople until they are used to the idea
and everything has calmed down.â€

tinkling of a mozart sonata.

â€œit is of the highest importance that there should be no gossip in
summer street. it would be death to gossip about mr. vyseâ€™s dismissal at
the present moment.â€

mr. beebe raised his eyebrows. death is a strong word--surely too
strong. there was no question of tragedy. he said: â€œof course, miss
honeychurch will make the fact public in her own way, and when she
chooses. freddy only told me because he knew she would not mind.â€

â€œi know,â€ said miss bartlett civilly. â€œyet freddy ought not to have told

importance that they attach to words. a rector lives in a web of petty
secrets, and confidences and warnings, and the wiser he is the less he
will regard them. he will change the subject, as did mr. beebe, saying
cheerfully: â€œhave you heard from any bertolini people lately? i believe
you keep up with miss lavish. it is odd how we of that pension,
who seemed such a fortuitous collection, have been working into one
anotherâ€™s lives. two, three, four, six of us--no, eight; i had forgotten
the emersons--have kept more or less in touch. we must really give the
signora a testimonial.â€

and, miss bartlett not favouring the scheme, they walked up the hill in
a silence which was only broken

e in surrey.
grey clouds were charging across tissues of white, which stretched and
shredded and tore slowly, until through their final layers there gleamed
a hint of the disappearing blue. summer was retreating. the wind roared,
the trees groaned, yet the noise seemed insufficient for those vast
operations in heaven. the weather was breaking up, breaking, broken,
and it is a sense of the fit rather than of the supernatural that equips
such crises with the salvos of angelic artillery. mr. beebeâ€™s eyes
rested on windy corner, where lucy sat, practising mozart. no smile came
to his lips, and, changing the subject again, he said: â€œwe shanâ€™t have
rain, but we shall have darkness, so let us hurry on. the darkness last
night was appalling.â€

they reached the beehive tavern at about five oâ€™clock. that amiable
hostelry possesses a verandah, in which the young and the unwise do
dearly love to sit, while guests of more mature years seek a pleasant
sanded room, and have tea at

 a table comfortably. mr. beebe saw that
miss bartlett would be cold if she sat out, and that minnie would be
dull if she sat in, so he proposed a division of forces. they would hand
the child her food through the window. thus he was incidentally enabled
to discuss the fortunes of lucy.

â€œi have been thinking, miss bartlett,â€ he said, â€œand, unless you
very much object, i would like to reopen that discussion.â€ she bowed.
â€œnothing about the past. i know little and care less about that; i am
absolutely certain

read it again.

â€œi canâ€™t see the point of it myself.â€

to his astonishment, she replied: â€œthere i cannot agree with you. in it
i spy lucyâ€™s salvation.â€

â€œreally. now, why?â€

â€œshe wanted to leave windy corner.â€

â€œi know--but it seems so odd, so unlike her, so--i was going to
say--selfish.â€

â€œit is natural, surely--after such painful scenes--that she should
desire a change.â€

here, apparently, was one of those points that the male intellect
misses. mr. beebe exclaimed: â€œso she says herself, and since another
lady agrees with her, i must own that i am partially convinced. perhaps
she must have a change. i have no sisters or--and i donâ€™t understand
these things. but why need she go as far as greece?â€

â€œyou may well ask that,â€ replied miss bartlett, who was evidently
interested, and had almost dropped her evasive manner. â€œwhy greece?
(what is it, minnie dear--jam?) why not tunbridge wells? oh, mr. beebe!
i had a long and most unsat

morning. i cannot help her. i will say no more. perhaps i have already

me at tunbridge wells, and she refused.â€

mr. beebe poked at a crumb with his knife.

â€œbut my feelings are of no importance. i know too well that i get on
lucyâ€™s nerves. our tour was a failure. she wanted to leave florence, and
when we got to rome she did not want to be in rome, and all the time i
felt that i was spending her motherâ€™s money--.â€

â€œlet us keep to the future, though,â€ interrupted mr. beebe. â€œi want your
advice.â€

â€œvery well,â€ said charlotte, with a choky abruptness that was new to
him, though familiar

 to lucy. â€œi for one will help her to go to greece.

mr. beebe considered.

â€œit is absolutely necessary,â€ she continued, lowering her veil and
whispering through it with a passion, an intensity, that surprised him.
â€œi know--i know.â€ the darkness was coming on, and he felt that this odd
woman really did know. â€œshe must not stop here a moment, and we must
keep quiet till she goes. i trust that the servants know nothing.
afterwards--but i may have said too much already. only, lucy and i are

â€œotherwise--?â€

â€œotherwise,â€ she repeated as if the word held finality.

â€œyes, i will help her,â€ said the clergyman, setting his jaw firm. â€œcome,
let us go back now, and settle the whole thing up.â€

miss bartlett burst into florid gratitude. the tavern sign--a beehive
trimmed evenly with bees--creaked in the wind outside as she thanked
him. mr. beebe did not quite understand the situation; but then, he did
not desire to understand it, nor to jump to the conclusion of â€œanother
manâ€ that would have attracted a grosser mind. he only felt that miss
bartlett knew of some vague influence from which the girl desired to be
delivered, and which might well be clothed in the fleshly form. its very
vagueness spurred him into knight-errantry. his belief in celibacy, so
reticent, so carefully concealed beneath his tolerance and culture, now

in the garden, mrs.
honeychurch, now helped by freddy, still wrestled with the lives of her
flowers.

â€œit gets too dark,â€ she said hopelessly. â€œthis comes of putting off. we
might have known the weather would break up soon; and now lucy wants to
go to greece. i donâ€™t know what the worldâ€™s coming to.â€

â€œmrs. honeychurch,â€ he said, â€œgo to greece she must. come up to the
house and letâ€™s talk it over. do you, in the first place, mind her
breaking with vyse?â€

â€œmr. beebe, iâ€™m thankful--simply thankful.â€

â€œso am i,â€ said freddy.

â€œgood. now come up to the house.â€

they conferred in the dining-room for half an hour.

lucy would never have carried the greek scheme alone. it was expensive
and dramatic--both qualities that her mother loathed. nor would
charlotte have succeeded. the honours of the day rested with mr. beebe.
by his tact and common sense, and by his influence as a clergyman--for
a clergyman who was not a fool influenced mrs. hon

said; â€œbut as you do, i suppose it is all right. it must be something i
canâ€™t understand. lucy! letâ€™s tell her. lucy!â€

â€œshe is playing the piano,â€ mr. beebe said. he opened the door, and
heard the words of a song:

     â€œlook not thou on beautyâ€™s charming.â€

â€œi didnâ€™t know that miss honeychurch sang, too.â€

  â€œsit thou still when kings are arming,
   taste not when the wine-cup glistens--â€

â€œitâ€™s a song that cecil gave her. how odd girls are!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ called lucy, stopping short.

â€œall right, dear,â€ said mrs. honeychurch kindly. she went into the
drawing-room, and mr. beebe heard her kiss lucy

and say: â€œi am sorry i
was so cross about greece, but it came on the top of the dahlias.â€

rather a hard voice said: â€œthank you, mother; that doesnâ€™t matter a
bit.â€

â€œand you are right, too--greece will be all right; you can go if the
miss alans will have you.â€

â€œoh, splendid! oh, thank you!â€

mr. beebe followed. lucy still sat at the piano with her hands over the
keys. she was glad, but he had expected greater gladness. her mother
bent over her. freddy, to whom she had been singing, reclined on the
floor with his head against her, and an unlit pipe between his lips.
oddly enough, the group was beautiful. mr. beebe, who loved the art of
the past, was reminded of a favourite theme, the santa conversazione,
in which people who care for one another are painted chatting together
about noble

therefore ignored by the art of to-day. why should lucy want either to
marry or to travel when she had such friends at home?

  â€œtaste not when the wine-cup glistens,
   speak not when the people listens,â€

she continued.

â€œhereâ€™s mr. beebe.â€

â€œmr. beebe knows my rude ways.â€

â€œitâ€™s a beautiful song and a wise one,â€ said he. â€œgo on.â€

â€œit isnâ€™t very good,â€ she said listlessly. â€œi forget why--harmony or
something.â€

â€œi suspected it was unscholarly. itâ€™s so beautiful.â€

â€œthe tuneâ€™s right enough,â€ said freddy, â€œbut the words are rotten. why
throw up the sponge?â€

â€œhow stupidly you talk!â€ said his sister. the santa conversazione was
broken up. after all, there was no reason that lucy should talk

 about

freddy lit his bicycle lamp for him in the porch, and with his usual
felicity of phrase, said: â€œthis has been a day and a half.â€

    â€œstop thine ear against the singer--â€

â€œwait a minute; she is finishing.â€

   â€œfrom the red gold keep thy finger;

â€œi love weather like this,â€ said freddy.

mr. beebe passed into it.

the two main facts were clear. she had behaved splendidly, and he had
helped her. he could not expect to master the details of so big a change
in a girlâ€™s life. if here and there he was dissatisfied or puzzled, he
must acquiesce; she was choosing the better part.

   â€œvacant heart and hand and eye--â€

perhaps the song stated â€œthe better partâ€ rather too strongly. he half
fancied that the soaring accompaniment--which he did not lose in the
shout of the gale-

â€œbecause i settled with cecil not to announce it until i left england. i

here.â€

â€œhereâ€ was the british museum. mrs. honeychurch refused. if they must
take shelter, let it be in a shop. lucy felt contemptuous, for she was
on the tack of caring for greek sculpture, and had already borrowed a
mythical dictionary from mr. beebe to get up the names of the goddesses
and gods.

â€œoh, well, let it be shop, then. letâ€™s go to mudieâ€™s. iâ€™ll buy a
guide-book.â€

â€œyou know, lucy, you and charlotte and mr. beebe all tell me iâ€™m

nes showers of
water fell from the over-hanging beech-trees and rattled on the hood.
lucy complained that the hood was stuffy. leaning forward, she looked
out into the steaming dusk, and watched the carriage-lamp pass like a
search-light over mud and leaves, and reveal nothing beautiful. â€œthe
crush when charlotte gets in will be abominable,â€ she remarked. for
they were to pick up miss bartlett at summer street, where she had been
dropped as the carriage went down, to pay a call on mr. beebeâ€™s old
mother. â€œwe shall have to sit three a side, because the trees drop, and
yet it isnâ€™t raining. oh, for a little air!â€ then she listened to the
horseâ€™s hoofs--â€œhe has not told--he has not told.â€ that melody was
blurred by the soft road. â€œcanâ€™t we have the hood down?â€ she demanded,
and her mother, with sudden tenderness, said: â€œvery well, old lady, stop
the horse.â€ and the horse was stopped, and lucy and powell wrestled with
the hood, and squirted water down mr

 the emersons had gone, and all this bother about
greece had been unnecessary. waste! that word seemed to sum up the whole
of life. wasted plans, wasted money, wasted love, and she had wounded
her mother. was it possible that she had muddled things away? quite
possible. other people had. when the maid opened the door, she was
unable to speak, and stared stupidly into the hall.

miss bartlett at once came forward, and after a long preamble asked
a great favour: might she go to church? mr. beebe and his mother had
already gone, but she had refused to start until she obtained her
hostessâ€™s full sanction, for it would mean keeping the horse waiting a
good ten minutes more.

â€œcertainly,â€ said the hostess wearily. â€œi forgot it was friday. letâ€™s
all go. powell can go round to the stables.â€

 was a stained
window, through which some feeble light was shining, and when the door
opened lucy heard mr. beebeâ€™s voice running through the litany to a
minute congregation. even their church, built upon the slope of the hill
so artfully, with its beautiful raised transept and its spire of silvery
shingle--even their church had lost its charm; and the thing one never
talked about--religion--was fading like all the other things.

faced again, but she had forgotten how to treat his father.

â€œmiss honeychurch, dear, we are so sorry! george is so sorry! he thought
he had a right to try. i cannot blame my boy, and yet i wish he had told
me first. he ought not to have tried. i knew nothing about it at all.â€

if only she could remember how to behave!

he held up his hand. â€œbut you must not scold him.â€

lucy turned her back, and began to look at mr. beebeâ€™s books.

â€œi taught him,â€ he quavered, â€œto trust in love. i said: â€˜when love
comes, that is reality.â€™ i said: â€˜passion does not blind. no. passion
is sanity, and the woman you love, she is the only person you will ever
really understand.â€™â€ he sighed: â€œtrue, everlastingly true, though my day
is over, and though there is the result. poor boy! he is so sorry!
he said he knew it was madness when you brought your cousin in; that
whatever you felt you did not mean. yetâ€-

 at all; i
had to hear so much, and he minded telling me; he finds me too old. ah,
well, one must have failures. george comes down to-morrow, and takes me
up to his london rooms. he canâ€™t bear to be about here, and i must be
where he is.â€

â€œmr. emerson,â€ cried the girl, â€œdonâ€™t leave at least, not on my account.
i am going to greece. donâ€™t leave your comfortable house.â€

it was the first time her voice had been kind and he smiled. â€œhow good
everyone is! and look at mr. beebe housing me--came over this morning
and heard i was going! here i am so comfortable with a fire.â€

â€œyes, but you wonâ€™t go back to london. itâ€™s absurd.â€

â€œi must be with george; i must make him care to live, and down here he
canâ€™t. he says the thought of seeing you and of hearing about you--i am
not justifying him: i am only saying what has happened.â€

â€œoh, mr. emersonâ€--she took hold of his hand--â€œyou mustnâ€™t. iâ€™ve been
bother enough to the world by now. i can

â€œi shouldnâ€™t want--â€

â€œi suppose mr. vyse is very angry with george? no, it was wrong of
george to try. we have pushed our beliefs too far. i fancy that we
deserve sorrow.â€

she looked at the books again--black, brown, and that acrid theological
blue. they surrounded the visitors on every side; they were piled on the
tables, they pressed against the very ceiling. to lucy who could not see
that mr. emerson was profoundly religious, and differed from mr. beebe
chiefly by his acknowledgment of passion--it seemed dreadful that the
old man should crawl into such a sanctum, when he was unhappy, and be
dependent on the bounty of a clergyman.

more certain than ever that she was tired, he offered her his chair.

â€œno, please sit still. i think i will sit in the carriage.â€

â€œmiss honeychurch, you do sound tired.â€

â€œnot a bit,â€ said lucy, with trembling lips.

â€œbut you are, and thereâ€™s a look of george about you. and what were you

â€œgreeceâ€--and she saw that he was thinking the word over--â€œgreece; but
you were to be married this year, i thought.â€

â€œnot till january, it wasnâ€™t,â€ said lucy, clasping her hands. would she
tell an actual lie when it came to the point?

â€œi suppose that mr. vyse is going with you. i hope--it isnâ€™t because
george spoke that you are both going?â€

â€œno.â€

â€œi hope that you will enjoy greece with mr. vyse.â€

â€œthank you.â€

at that moment mr. beebe came back from church. his cassock was covered
with rain. â€œthatâ€™s all right,â€ he said kindly. â€œi counted on you two
keeping each other company. itâ€™s pouring again. the entire congregation,
which consists of your cousin, your mother, and my mother, stands
waiting in the church, till the carriage fetches it. did powell go
round?â€

â€œi think so; iâ€™ll see.â€

â€œno--of course, iâ€™ll see. how are the miss alans?â€

of sex, but the true chivalry that all the young may show to all the
old--awoke in her, and, at whatever risk, she told him that cecil was
not her companion to greece. and she spoke so seriously that the risk
became a certainty, and he, lifting his eyes, said: â€œyou are leaving
him? you are leaving the man you love?â€

â€œi--i had to.â€

â€œwhy, miss honeychurch, why?â€

terror came over her, and she lied again. she made the long, convincing
speech that she had made to mr. beebe, and intended to make to the world
when she announced that her engagement was no more. he heard her in
silence, and then said: â€œmy dear, i am worried about you. it seems to
meâ€--dreamily; she was not alarmed--â€œthat you are in a muddle.â€

she shook her head.

â€œtake an old manâ€™s word; thereâ€™s nothing worse than a muddle in all the
world. it is easy to face death and fate, and the things that sound
so dreadful. it is on my muddles that i look back with horror--on the

world was made.â€

she could not understand him; the words were indeed remote. yet as he
spoke the darkness was withdrawn, veil after veil, and she saw to the
bottom of her soul.

â€œthen, lucy--â€

â€œyouâ€™ve frightened me,â€ she moaned. â€œcecil--mr. beebe--the ticketâ€™s

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ said mr. beebe sharply.

â€œi was saying, why should you trust her when she deceived you?â€

â€œone minute, mother.â€ he came in and shut the door.

â€œi donâ€™t follow you, mr. emerson. to whom do you refer? trust whom?â€

â€œi mean she has pretended to you that she did not love george. they have

face, with its ruddy whiskers, seemed suddenly inhuman. a long black

â€œoh, rubbish, miss honeychurch!â€

â€œit is not rubbish!â€ said the old man hotly. â€œitâ€™s the part of people
that you donâ€™t understand.â€

mr. beebe laid his hand on the old manâ€™s shoulder pleasantly.

â€œlucy! lucy!â€ called voices from the carriage.

â€œmr. beebe, could you help me?â€

he looked amazed at the request, and said in a low, stern voice: â€œi

lamentable--incredible.â€

â€œwhatâ€™s wrong with the boy?â€ fired up the other again.

so.â€

â€œoh, no, she didnâ€™t see him. she was upstairs with old mrs. beebe, donâ€™t
you remember, and then went straight to the church. she said so.â€

george was obstinate again. â€œmy father,â€ said he, â€œsaw her, and i prefer
