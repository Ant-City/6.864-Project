[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] wears a cold, haughty mask because she has
a secret to hide: a great passion that led to an illegitimate child
and heartbreak. until we discover this secret, [CHARACTER] seems
to be little more than an unpleasant member of high society, bored
with absolutely everything and unwilling to be bothered by anyone,
including her husband, sir leicester. [CHARACTER] seems not to
care about or have any interest in the world around her. when we
discover her secret, however, we know all this to be false. far
from being disengaged from the world because of snobbery, [CHARACTER]
keeps the world at arm's length out of fear and pain: fear that
her secret will be revealed and bring the whole dedlock family tumbling
down, and pain from events from her past. regal, stone-cold lady
dedlock, watched and talked about by the public as though she is
greater than life, has a very human, very messy past that throbs
beneath her unshakeable exterior.
when [CHARACTER] finds that her past is catching up with
her, she begins acting in a way that seems shockingly inappropriate
for a woman of the dedlock name. for example, she disguises herself
and asks jo, a street urchin, to show her the burial ground of the
dead lodger, who we eventually learn was her former lover. when
esther is sick, [CHARACTER] disguises herself again and tries to
find out information about her by going to the brickmaker's cottage.
and when she fears her secret is about to come out, she leaves her
jewels and money behind and flees, eventually dying on the street.
[CHARACTER], who seems at first to have no passion, ultimately
shows herself to be so passionate that she will die to protect those
she loves.
