uil and rauros far away. pippin had to climb on the bench to look out over the deep stone sill.
‘are you angry with me, gandalf?’ he said, as their guide went out and closed the door. ‘i did the best i could.’
‘you did indeed!’ said gandalf, laughing suddenly; and he came and stood beside pippin, putting his arm about the hobbit’s shoulders and gazing out of the window. pippin glanced in some wonder at the face now close beside his own, for the sound of that laugh had been gay and merry. yet in the wizard’s face he saw at first only lines of care and sorrow; though as he looked more intently he perceived that under all there was a great joy: a fountain of mirth enough to set a kingdom laughing, were it to gush forth.
‘indeed you did your best,’ said the wizard; ‘and i hope that it may be long before you find yourself in such a tight corner again between two such terrible old men. still the lord of gondor learned more from you than you may have guessed, pippin. you coul

 they thanked him for coming among them, and hung on his words and stories of the outlands, and gave him as much food and ale as he could wish. indeed his only trouble was to be ‘wary’ according to the counsel of gandalf, and not to let his tongue wag freely after the manner of a hobbit among friends.
at length beregond rose. ‘farewell for this time!’ he said. ‘i have duty now till sundown, as have all the others here, i think. but if you are lonely, as you say, maybe you would like a merry guide about the city. my son would go with you gladly. a good lad, i may say. if that pleases you, go down to the lowest circle and ask for the old guesthouse in the rath celerdain, the lampwrights’ street. you will find him there with other lads that are remaining in the city. there may be things worth seeing down at the great gate ere the closing.’
he went out, and soon after all the others followed. the day was still fine, though it was growing hazy, and it was hot for march, even so far

bergil clapped his hands, and laughed with relief. ‘all is well,’ he cried. ‘come then! we were soon going to the gate to look on. we will go now.’
‘what is happening there?’
‘the captains of the outlands are expected up the south road ere sundown. come with us and you will see.’
bergil proved a good comrade, the best company pippin had had since he parted from merry, and soon they were laughing and talking gaily as they went about the streets, heedless of the many glances that men gave them. before long they found themselves in a throng going towards the great gate. there pippin went up much in the esteem of bergil, for when he spoke his name and the pass-word the guard saluted him and let him pass through; and what was more, he allowed him to take his companion with him.
‘that is good!’ said bergil. ‘we boys are no longer allowed to pass the gate wi

t back into the city, the last to pass the gate before it was shut; and as they reached the lampwrights’ street all the bells in the towers tolled solemnly. lights sprang in many windows, and from the houses and wards of the men at arms along the walls there came the sound of song.
‘farewell for this time,’ said bergil. ‘take my greetings to my :father, and thank him for the company that he sent. come again soon, i beg. almost i wish now that there was no war, for we might have had some merry times. we might have journeyed to lossarnach, to my grandsire’s house; it is good to be there in spring, the woods and fields are full of flowers. but maybe we will go thither together yet. they will never overcome our lord, and my father is very valiant. farewell and return!’
they parted and pippin hurried back towards the citadel. it seemed a long way, and he grew hot and very hungry; and night closed down swift and dark. not a star pricked the sky. he was late for the daymeal in the mess

am glad to see you back. it has been a long day.’
‘but the night will be too short,’ said gandalf. ‘i have come back here, for i must have a little peace, alone. you should sleep, in a bed while you still may. at the sunrise i shall take you to the lord denethor again. no, when the summons comes, not at sunrise. the darkness has begun. there will be no dawn.’

chapter 2

the passing of the grey company

gandalf was gone, and the thudding hoofs of shadowfax were lost in the night, when merry came back to aragorn. he had only a light bundle, for he had lost his pack at parth galen, and all he had was a few useful things he had picked up among the wreckage of isengard. hasufel was already saddled. legolas and gimli with their horse stood close by.
‘so four of the company still remain,’ said aragorn. ‘we will ride on together. but we shall not go alone, as i thought. the king is now determined to set out at once. since the coming of the winged shadow, he desires to return to the

to the muster that he commanded at edoras, four nights from now. and there, i think, he will hear tidings of war, and the riders of rohan will go down to minas tirith. but for myself, and any that will go with me . . .’
‘i for one!’ cried legolas. ‘and gimli with him!’ said the dwarf.
‘well, for myself,’ said aragorn, ‘it is dark before me. i must go down also to minas tirith, but i do not yet see the road. an hour long prepared approaches.’
‘don’t leave me behind!’ said merry. ‘i have not been of much use yet; but i don’t want to be laid aside, like baggage to be called for when all is over. i don’t think the riders will want to be bothered with me now. though, of course, the king did say that i was to sit by him when he came to his house and tell him all about the shire.’
‘yes,’ said aragorn, ‘and your road lies with him, i think, merry. but do not look for mirth at the ending. it will be long, i fear, ere théoden sits at ease again in meduseld. many

 hopes will wither in this bitter spring.’
soon all were ready to depart: twenty-four horses, with gimli behind legolas, and merry in front of aragorn. presently they were riding swiftly through the night. they had not long passed the mounds at the fords of isen, when a rider galloped up from the rear of their line.
‘my lord,’ he said to the king, ‘there are horsemen behind us. as we crossed the fords i thought that i heard them. now we are sure. they are overtaking us, riding hard.’
théoden at once called a halt. the riders turned about and seized their spears. aragorn dismounted and set merry on the ground, and

drawing his sword he stood by the king’s stirrup. éomer and his esquire rode back to the rear. merry felt more like unneeded baggage than ever, and he wondered, if there was a fight, what he should do. supposing the king’s small escort was trapped and overcome, but he escaped into the darkness - alone in the wild fields of rohan with no idea of where he was in all the endless miles? ‘no good!’ he thought. he drew his sword and tightened his belt.
the sinking moon was obscured by a great sailing cloud, but suddenly it rode out clear again. then they all heard the sound of hoofs, and at th

id you say? that is a glad word. we seek that land in haste from long afar.’
‘you have found it,’ said éomer. ‘when you crossed the fords yonder you entered it. but it is the realm of théoden the king. none ride here save by his leave. who are you? and what is your haste?’
‘halbarad dúnadan, ranger of the north i am,’ cried the man. ‘we seek one aragorn son of arathorn, and we heard that he was in rohan.’
‘and you have found him also!’ cried aragorn. giving his reins to merry, he ran forward and embraced the newcomer. ‘halbarad!’ he said. ‘of all joys this is the least expected!’
merry breathed a sigh of relief. he had thought that this was some last trick of saruman’s, to waylay the king while he had only a few men about him; but it seemed that there would be no need to die in théoden’s defence, not yet at any rate. he sheathed his sword.
‘all is well,’ said aragorn, turning back. ‘here are some of my own kin from the far land where i dwelt. but

eth, or all hopes end. therefore i send thee what i have made for thee. fare well, elfstone!’
and aragorn said: ‘now i know what you bear. bear it still for me a while!’ and he turned and looked away to the north under the great stars, and then he fell silent and spoke no more while the night’s journey lasted.
the night was old and the east grey when they rode up at last from deeping-coomb and came back to the hornburg. there they were to lie and rest for a brief while and take counsel.
merry slept until he was roused by legolas and gimli. ‘the sun is high,’ said legolas. ‘all others are up and doing. come, master sluggard, and look at this place while you may!’
‘there was a battle here three nights ago,’ said gimli, ‘and here legolas and i played a game that i won only by a single orc. come and see how it was! and there are caves, merry, caves of wonder! shall we visit them, legolas, do you think?’
‘nay! there is no time,’ said the elf. ‘do not spoil the wonde

r with haste! i have given you my word to return hither with you, if a day of peace and freedom comes again. but it is now near to noon, and at that hour we eat, and then set out again, i hear.’
merry got up and yawned. his few hours’ sleep had not been nearly enough; he was tired and rather dismal. he missed pippin, and felt that he was only a burden, while everybody was making plans for speed in a business that he did not fully understand. ‘where is aragorn?’ he asked.
‘in a high chamber of the burg,’ said legolas. ‘he has neither rested nor slept, i think. he went thither some hours ago, saying that he must take thought, and only his kinsman, halbarad, went with him; but some

ys beside them; for they are grim men of face, worn like weathered rocks for the most part, even as aragorn himself; and they are silent.’
‘but even as aragorn they are courteous, if they break their silence.’ said legolas. ‘and have you marked the brethren elladan and elrohir? less sombre is their gear than the others’, and they are fair and gallant as elven-lords; and that is not to be wondered at in the sons of elrond of rivendell.’
‘why have they come? have you heard?’ asked merry. he had now dressed, and he flung his grey cloak about his shoulders; and the three passed out together towards the ruined gate of the burg.
‘they answered a summons, as you heard,’ said gimli. ‘word came to rivendell, they say: aragorn has need of his kindred. let the dúnedain ride to him in rohan! but whence this message came they are now in doubt. gandalf sent it, i would guess.’
‘nay, galadriel,’ said legolas. ‘did she not speak through gandalf of the ride of the grey company

eath down already stood there, black and tall and stony, and the great trampling and scoring of the grass by the huorns could be plainly seen. the dunlendings and many men of the garrison of the burg were at work on the dike or in the fields and about the battered walls behind; yet all seemed strangely quiet: a weary valley resting after a great storm. soon they turned back and went to the midday meal in the hall of the burg.
the king was already there, and as soon as they entered he called for merry and had a seat set for him at his side. ‘it is not as i would have it,’ said théoden; ‘for this is little like my fair house in edoras. and your friend is gone, who should also be here. but it may be long ere we sit, you and i, at the high table in meduseld; there will be no time for feasting when i return thither. but come now! eat and drink, and let us speak together while we may. and then you shall ride with me.’
‘may i?’ said merry, surprised and delighted. ‘that would be spl

‘there are no great weapon-hoards here, lord.’ answered éomer. ‘maybe a light helm might be found to fit him; but we have no mail or sword for one of his stature.’
‘i have a sword,’ said merry, climbing from his seat, and drawing from its black sheath his small bright blade. filled suddenly with love for this old man, he knelt on one knee, and took his hand and kissed it. ‘may i lay the sword of meriadoc of the shire on your lap théoden king?’ he cried. ‘receive my service, if you will!’
‘gladly will i take it,’ said the king; and laying his long old hands upon the brown hair of the hobbit; he blessed him. ‘rise now, meriadoc, esquire of rohan of the household of medus

‘as a father you shall be to me,’ said merry.
‘for a little while,’ said théoden.
they talked then together as they ate, until presently éomer spoke. ‘it is near the hour that we set for our going, lord,’ he said. ‘shall i bid men sound the horns? but where is aragorn? his place is empty and he has not eaten.’
‘we will make ready to ride,’ said théoden; ‘but let word be sent to the lord aragorn that the hour is nigh.’
the king with his guard and merry at his side passed down from the gate of the burg to where the ri

ere cast now over helm and head. their horses were strong and of proud bearing, but rough-haired; and one stood there without a rider, aragorn’s own horse that they had brought from the north; roheryn was his name. there was no gleam of stone or gold, nor any fair thing in all their gear and harness: nor did their riders bear any badge or token, save only that each cloak was pinned upon the left shoulder by a brooch of silver shaped like a rayed star.
the king mounted his horse, snowmane, and merry sat beside him on his pony: stybba was his name. presently éomer came out from the gate, and with him was aragorn, and halbarad bearing the great staff close-furled in black, and two tall men, neither young nor old so much alike were they, the sons of elrond, that few could tell them apart: dark-haired, grey-eyed, and their faces elven-fair, clad alike in bright mail beneath cloaks of silver-grey. behind them walked legolas and gimli. but merry had eyes only for aragorn, so startling was the c

‘the paths of the dead!’ said théoden, and trembled. ‘why do you speak of them?’ éomer turned and gazed at aragorn, and it seemed to merry that the faces of the riders that sat within hearing turned pale at the words. ‘if there be in truth such paths,’ said théoden, ‘their gate is in dunharrow; but no living man may pass it.’
‘alas! aragorn my friend!’ said éomer. ‘i had hoped that we should ride to war together; but if you seek the paths of the dead, then our parting is come, and it is little likely that we shall ever meet again under the sun.’
‘that road i will take, nonetheless,’ said aragorn. ‘but i say

 to you, éomer, that in battle we may yet meet again, though all the hosts of mordor should stand between.’
‘you will do as you will, my lord aragorn,’ said théoden. ‘it is your doom, maybe, to tread strange paths that others dare not. this parting grieves me, and my strength is lessened by it; but now i must take the mountain-roads and delay no longer. farewell!’
‘farewell, lord!’ said aragorn. ‘ride unto great renown! farewell, merry! i leave you in good hands, better than we hoped when we hunted the orcs to fangorn. legolas and gimli will still hunt with me, i hope; but we shall not forget you.’
‘good-bye!’ said merry. he could find no more to say. he felt very small, and he was puzzled and depressed by all these gloomy words. more than ever he missed the unquenchable cheerfulness of pippin. the riders were ready, and their horses were fidgeting; he wished they would start arid get it over.

and suddenly harrowdale lay before them, loud with the noise of waters in the evening. there the white snowbourn, joined by the lesser stream, went rushing, fuming on the stones, down to edoras and the green hills and the plains. away to the right at the head of the great dale the mighty starkhorn loomed up above its vast buttresses swathed in cloud; but its jagged peak, clothed in everlasting snow, gleamed far above the world, blue-shadowed upon the east, red-stained by the sunset in the west.
merry looked out in wonder upon this strange country, of which he had heard many tales upon their long road. it was a skyless world, in which his eye; through dim gulfs of shadowy air, saw only ever-mounting slopes, great walls of stone behind great walls, and frowning precipices wreathed with mist. he sat for a moment half dreaming, listening to the noise of water, the whisper of dark trees, the crack of stone, and the vast waiting silence that brooded behind all sound. he loved mountains, or he had

sses, and through long dales, and across many streams. sometimes where the way was broader he had ridden at the king’s side, not noticing that many of the riders smiled to see the two together: the hobbit on his little shaggy grey pony, and the lord of rohan on his great white horse. then he had talked to théoden, telling him about his home and the doings of the shire-folk, or listening in turn to tales of the mark and its mighty men of old. but most of the time, especially on this last day, merry had ridden by himself just behind the king, saying nothing, and trying to understand the slow sonorous speech of rohan that he heard the men behind him using. it was a language in which there seemed to be many words that he knew, though spoken more richly and strongly than in the shire, yet he could not piece the words together. at times some rider would lift up his clear voice in stirring song, and merry felt his heart leap, though he did not know what it was about.
all the same he had been lo

at it is as you would wish. naught has been seen in harrowdale of these evil things.’
‘it is well,’ said théoden. ‘i will ride now to the hold, and there before i go to rest i will meet the marshals and captains. let them come to me as soon as may be!’
the road now led eastward straight across the valley, which was at that point little more than half a mile in width. flats and meads of rough grass, grey now in the falling night, lay all about, but in front on the far side of the dale merry saw a frowning wall, a last outlier of the great roots of the starkhorn, cloven by the river in ages past.
on all the level spaces there was great concourse of men. some thronged to the roadside, hailing the king and the riders from the west with glad cries; but stretching away into the distance behind there were ordered rows of tents and booths, and lines of picketed horses, and great store of arms, and piled spears bristling like thickets of new-planted trees. now all the great assembly was f

alling into shadow, and yet, though the night-chill blew cold from the heights no lanterns glowed, no fires were lit. watchmen heavily cloaked paced to and fro.
merry wondered how many riders there were. he could not guess their number in the gathering gloom, but it looked to him like a great army, many thousands strong. while he was peering from side to side the king’s party came up under the looming cliff on the eastern side of the valley; and there suddenly the path began to climb, and merry looked up in amazement. he was on a road the like of which he had never seen before, a great work of men’s hands in years beyond the reach of song. upwards it wound, coiling like a snake, boring its way across the sheer slope of rock. steep as a stair, it looped backwards and forwards as it climbed. up it horses could walk, and wains could be slowly hauled; but no enemy could come that way, except out of the air, if it was defended from above. at each turn of the road there were great standin

g stones that had been carved in the likeness of men, huge and clumsy-limbed, squatting cross-legged with their stumpy arms folded on fat bellies. some in the wearing of the years had lost all features save the dark holes of their eyes that still stared sadly at the passers-by. the riders hardly glanced at them. the púkel-men they called them, and heeded them little: no power or terror was left in them; but merry gazed at them with wonder and a feeling almost of pity, as they loomed up mournfully in the dusk.
after a while he looked back and found that he had already climbed some hundreds of feet above the valley, but still far below he could dimly see a winding line of riders crossing the ford and filing along the road towards the camp prepared for them. only the king and his guard were going up into the hold.
at last the king’s company came to a sharp brink, and the climbing road passed into a cutti

such was the dark dunharrow, the work of long-forgotten men. their name was lost and no song or legend remembered it. for what purpose they had made this place, as a town or secret temple or a tomb of kings, none could say. here they laboured in the dark years, before ever a ship came to the western shores, or gondor of the dúnedain was built; and now they had vanished, and only the old púkel-men were left, still sitting at the turnings of the road.
merry stared at the lines of marching stones: they were worn and black; some were leaning, some were fallen, some cracked or broken; they looked like rows of old and hungry teeth. he wondered what they could be, and he hoped that the king was not going to follow them into the darkness beyond. then he saw that there were clusters of tents and booths on either side of the stony way; but these were not set near the trees, and seemed rather to huddle away from them towards the brink of the cliff. the gre

ater number were on the right, where the firienfeld was wider; and on the left there was a smaller camp, in the midst of which stood a tall pavilion. from this side a rider now came out to meet them, and they turned from the road.
as they drew near merry saw that the rider was a woman with long braided hair gleaming in the twilight, yet she wore a helm and was clad to the waist like a warrior and girded with a sword.
‘hail, lord of the mark!’ she cried. ‘my heart is glad at your returning.’
‘and you, éowyn,’ said théoden, ‘is all well with you?’
‘all is well,’ she answered; yet it seemed to merry that her voice belied her, and he would have thought that she had been weeping, if that could be believed of one so stern of fac

‘yes, lord,’ said éowyn. ‘and he has passed into the shadows from which none have returned. i could not dissuade him. he is gone.’
‘then our paths are sundered,’ said éomer. ‘he is lost. we must ride without him, and our hope dwindles.’
slowly they passed through the short heath and upland grass, speaking no more, until they came to the king’s pavilion. there merry found that everything was made ready, and that he himself was not forgotten. a little tent had been pitched for him beside the king’s lodging; and there he sat alone, while men passed to and fro, going in to the king and taking counsel with him. night came on, and the half-seen heads of the mountains westward were crowned with stars, but the east was dark and blank. the marching stones faded slowly from sight, but still beyond them, blacker than the gloom, brooded the vast crouching shadow of

he midst of these gloomy thoughts he suddenly remembered that he was very hungry, and he got up to go and see if anyone else in this strange camp felt the same. but at that very moment a trumpet sounded, and a man came summoning him, the king’s esquire, to wait at the king’s board.
in the inner part of the pavilion was a small space, curtained off with broidered hangings, and strewn with skins: and there at a small table sat théoden with éomer and éowyn, and dúnhere, lord of harrowdale. merry stood beside the king’s stool and waited on him till presently the old man, coming out of deep thought, turned to him and smiled.
‘come, master meriadoc!’ he said. ‘you shall not stand. you shall sit beside me, as long as i remain in my own lands, and lighten my heart with tales.’
room was made for the hobbit at the king’s left hand, but no one called for any tale. there was indeed little speech, and they ate and drank for the most part in silence, until at last, plucking up courage

, merry asked the question that was tormenting him.
‘twice now, lord, i have heard of the paths of the dead,’ he said. ‘what are they? and where has strider, i mean the lord aragorn where has he gone?’
the king sighed, but no one answered, until at last éomer spoke. ‘we do not know, and our hearts are heavy,’ he said. ‘but as for the paths of the dead, you have yourself walked on their first steps. nay. i speak no words of ill omen! the road that we have climbed is the approach to the do

people of harrowdale shut fast their doors and shroud their windows and are afraid. but the dead come seldom forth and only at times of great unquiet and coming death.’
‘yet it is said in harrowdale,’ said éowyn in a low voice. ‘that in the moonless nights but little while ago a great host in strange array passed by. whence they came none knew, but they went up the stony road and vanished into the hill, as if they went to keep a tryst.’
‘then why has aragorn gone that way?’ asked merry. ‘don’t you know anything that would explain it?’
‘unless he has spoken words to you as his friend that we have not heard,’ said éomer, ‘none now in the land of the living can tell his purpose.’
‘greatly changed he seemed to me since i saw him first in the king’s house,’ said éowyn: ‘grimmer, older. fey i thought him, and like one whom the dead call.’
‘maybe he was called,’ said théoden; ‘and my heart tells me that i shall not see him again. yet he is a kingly m

man so greathearted in this hour of need! are there not evil things enough abroad without seeking them under the earth? war is at hand.’
he paused, for at that moment there was a noise outside, a man’s voice crying the name of théoden, and the challenge of the guard.
presently the captain of the guard thrust aside the curtain. ‘a man is here, lord,’ he said, ‘an errand-rider of gondor. he wishes to come before you at once.’
‘let him come!’ said théoden.
a tall man entered, and merry choked back a cry; for a moment it seemed to him that boromir was alive again and had returned. then he saw that it was not so; the man was a stranger, though as like to boromir as if he were one of his kin, tall and grey-eyed and proud. he was clad as a rider with a cloak of dark green over a coat of fine mail; on the front of his helm was wrought a small silver star. in his hand he bore a single arrow, black-feathered and barbed with steel, but the point was painted red.

with that the king stood up, and they all rose. ‘go now each to your rest.’ he said, ‘and sleep well. and you, master meriadoc, i need no more tonight. but be ready to my call as soon as the sun is risen.’
‘i will be ready,’ said merry, ‘even if you bid me ride with you on the paths of the dead.’
‘speak not words of omen!’ said the king. ‘for there may be more roads than one that could bear that name. but i did not say that i would bid you ride with me on any road. good night!’
‘i won’t be left behind, to be called for on return!’ said merry. ‘i won’t be left, i won’t.’ and repeating this over and over again to himself he fell asleep at last in his tent.
he was wakened by a man shaking him. ‘wake u

p, wake up. master holbytla!’ he cried; and at length merry came out of deep dreams and sat up with a start. it still seemed very dark, he thought.
‘what is the matter?’ he asked.
‘the king calls for you.’
‘but the sun has not risen, yet,’ said merry.
‘no, and will not rise today, master holbytla. nor ever again, one would think under this cloud. but time does not stand still, though the sun be lost. make haste!’
flinging on some clothes, merry looked outside. the world was darkling. the very air seemed brown, and all things about were black and grey and shadowless; there was a great stillness. no shape of cloud could be seen, unless it were far away westward, where the furthest groping fingers of the great gloom still crawled onwards and a little light leaked through them. overhead there hung a heavy roof, sombre and featureless, and light seemed rather to be failing than growing.
merry saw many folk standing, looking up and mutterin

‘it comes from mordor, lord,’ he said. ‘it began last night at sunset. from the hills in the eastfold of your realm i saw it rise and creep across the sky, and all night as i rode it came behind eating up the stars. now the great cloud hangs over all the land between here and the mountains of shadow; and it is deepening. war has already begun.’
for a while the king sat silent. at last he spoke. ‘so we come to it in the end,’ he said: ‘the great

‘we have very great store long prepared,’ answered hirgon. ride now as light and as swift as you may!’
‘then call the heralds, éomer,’ said théoden. ‘let the riders be marshalled!’
éomer went out, and presently the trumpets rang in the hold and were answered by many others from below; but their voices no longer sounded clear and brave as they had seemed to merry the night before. dull they seemed and harsh in the heavy air, braying ominously.
the king turned to merry. ‘i am going to war, master meriadoc,’ he said. ‘in a little while i shall take the road. i release you from my service, but not from my friendship. you shall abide here, and if you will, you shall serve the lady éowyn, who will govern the folk in my stead.’
‘but, but, lord,’ merry stammered, ‘i offered you my sword. i do not want to be parted from you like this, théoden ki

‘but we ride on horses tall and swift,’ said théoden; ‘and great though your heart be, you cannot ride on such beasts.’
‘then tie me on to the back of one, or let me hang on a stirrup, or something,’ said merry. ‘it is a long way to run; but run i shall, if i cannot ride, even if i wear my feet off and arrive weeks too late.’
théoden smiled. ‘rather than that i would bear you with me on snowmane,’ he said. ‘but at the least you shall ride with me to edoras and look on meduseld; for that way i shall go. so far stybba can bear you: the great race will not begin till we reach the plains.’
then éowyn rose up. ‘come now, meriadoc!’ she said. ‘i will show you the gear that i have prepare

d fur you.’ they went out together. ‘this request only did aragorn make to me,’ said éowyn, as they passed among the tents, ‘that you should be armed for battle. i have granted it, as i could. for my heart tells me that you will need such gear ere the end.’
now she led merry to a booth among the lodges of the king’s guard and there an armourer brought out to her a small helm, and a round shield, and other gear.
‘no mail have we to fit you,’ said éowyn, ‘nor any time for the forging of such a hauberk; but here is also a stout jerkin of leather, a belt, and a knife. a sword you have.’
merry bowed, and the lady showed him the shield, which was like the shield that had been given to gimli, and it bore on it the device of the white horse. ‘take all these th

anies well nigh five and fifty hundreds of riders fully armed, and many hundreds of other men with spare horses lightly burdened. a single trumpet sounded. the king raised his hand, and then silently the host of the mark began to move. foremost went twelve of the king’s household-men, riders of renown. then the king followed with éomer on his right. he had said farewell to éowyn above in the hold, and the memory was grievous; but now he turned his mind to the road that lay ahead. behind him merry rode on stybba with the errand riders of gondor, and behind them again twelve more of the king’s household. they passed down the long ranks of waiting men with stern and unmoved faces. but when they had come almost to the end of the line one looked up glancing keenly at the hobbit. a young man, merry thought as he returned the glance, less in height and girth than most. he caught the glint of clear grey eyes; and then he shivered, for it came suddenly to him that it was the face of one withou

it was indeed in deepening gloom that the king came to edoras, although it was then but noon by the hour. there he halted only a short while and strengthened his host by some three score of riders that came late to the weapontake. now having eaten he made ready to set out again, and he wished his esquire a kindly farewell. but merry begged for the last time not to be parted from him.
‘this is no journey for such steeds as stybba, as i have told you ‘ said théoden. ‘and in such a battle as we think to make on the fields of gondor what would you do, master meriadoc, sword-thain though you be, and greater of heart than of stature?’
‘as for that, who can tell?’ answered merry. ‘but why, lord, did you receive me as sword-thain, if not to stay by your side? and i would not have it said of me in song only that i wa

s always left behind!’
‘i received you for your safe-keeping,’ answered théoden; ‘and also to do as i might bid. none of my riders can bear you as burden. if the battle were before my gates, maybe your deeds would be remembered by the minstrels; but it is a hundred leagues and two to mundburg where denethor is lord. i will say no more.’
merry bowed and went away unhappily, and stared at the lines of horsemen. already the companies were preparing to start: men were tightening girths, looking to saddles, caressing their horses; some gazed uneasily at the lowering sky. unnoticed a rider came up and spoke softly in the hobbit’s ear.
‘where will wants not, a way opens, so we say,’ he whispered; ‘and so i have found myself.’ merry looked up and saw that it was the young rider whom he had noticed in the morning. ‘you wish to go

 whither the lord of the mark goes: i see it in your face.’
‘i do,’ said merry.
‘then you shall go with me,’ said the rider. ‘i will bear you before me, under my cloak until we are far afield, and this darkness is yet darker. such good will should not be denied. say no more to any man, but come!’
‘thank you indeed!’ said merry. ‘thank you, sir, though i do not know your name.’
‘do you not?’ said the rider softly. ‘then call me dernhelm.’
thus it came to pass that when the king set out, before dernhelm sat meriadoc the hobbit, and the great grey steed windfola made little of the burden; for dernhelm was less in weight than many men, though lithe and well-knit in frame.

and as if in answer there came from far away another note. horns, horns, horns. in dark mindolluin’s sides they dimly echoed. great horns of the north wildly blowing. rohan had come at last.

chapter 5

the ride of the rohirrim

it was dark and merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled in a blanket; yet though the night was airless and windless, all about him hidden trees were sighing softly. he lifted his head. then he heard it again: a sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain-steps. the throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point, now nearer, now further off. he wondered if the watchmen had heard it.
he could not see them, but he knew that all round him were the companies of the ro

hirrim. he could smell the horses in the dark, and could hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground. the host was bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about eilenach beacon, a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the drúadan forest that lay beside the great road in east anórien.
tired as he was merry could not sleep. he had ridden now for four days on end, and the ever-deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart. he began to wonder why he had been so eager to come, when he had been given every excuse, even his lord’s command, to stay behind. he wondered, too, if the old king knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry. perhaps not. there seemed to be some understanding between dernhelm and elfhelm, the marshal who commanded the éored in which they were riding. he and all his men

ignored merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke. he might have been just another bag that dernhelm was carrying. dernhelm was no comfort: he never spoke to anyone. merry felt small, unwanted, and lonely. now the time was anxious, and the host was in peril. they were less than a day’s ride from the out-walls of minas tirith that encircled the townlands. scouts had been sent ahead. some had not returned. others hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them. a host of the enemy was encamped upon it, three miles west of amon dîn, and some strength of men was already thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues away. orcs

 were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside. the king and éomer held council in the watches of the night.
merry wanted somebody to talk to, and he thought of pippin. but that only increased his restlessness. poor pippin, shut up in the great city of stone, lonely and afraid. merry wished he was a tall rider like éomer and could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue. he sat up, listening to the drums that were beating again, now nearer at hand. presently he heard voices speaking low, and he saw dim half-shrouded lanterns passing through the trees. men nearby began to move uncertainly in the dark.
a tall figure loomed up and stumbled over him, cursing the tree-roots. he recognized the voice of the marshal, elfhelm.
‘i am not a tree-root, sir,’ he sai

‘anything that can keep so in this devil’s mirk,’ answered elfhelm. ‘but my lord sends word that we must set ourselves in readiness: orders may come for a sudden move.’
‘is the enemy coming then?’ asked merry anxiously. ‘are those their drums? i began to think i was imagining them, as no one else seemed to take any notice of them.’
‘nay, nay,’ said elfhelm, ‘the enemy is on the road not in the hills. you hear the woses, the wild men of the woods: thus they talk together from afar. they still haunt drúadan forest, it is said. remnants of an older time they be, living few and secretly, wild and wary as the beasts. they go not to war with gondor or the mark; but now they are troubled by the

coming of the orcs: they fear lest the dark years be returning, as seems likely enough. let us be thankful that they are not hunting us: for they use poisoned arrows, it is said, and they are woodcrafty beyond compare. but they have offered their services to théoden. even now one of their headmen is being taken to the king. yonder go the lights. so much i have heard but no more. and now i must busy myself with my lord’s commands. pack yourself up, master bag!’ he vanished into the shadows.
merry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts, but quite apart from that a great weight of dread was on him. waiting was unbearable. he longed to know what was going to happen. he got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees.
presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up for the king under a great tree. a large lantern, covered above, was hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below. there s

at théoden and éomer, and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man, gnarled as an old stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss. he was short-legged and fat-armed, thick and stumpy, and clad only with grass about his waist. merry felt that he had seen him before somewhere, and suddenly he remembered the púkel-men of dunharrow. here was one of those old images brought to life, or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago.
there was a silence as merry crept nearer, and then the wild man began to speak, in answer to some question, it seemed. his voice was deep and guttural, yet to merry’s surprise he spoke the common speech, though in a halting

ost is all strung out, it will be long ere it can be set in order when we issue from the hills. what is the hour now?’
‘who knows?’ said théoden. ‘all is night now.’
‘it is all dark, but it is not all night.’ said ghân. ‘when sun comes we feel her, even when she is hidden. already she climbs over east-mountains. it is the opening of day in the sky-fields.’
‘then we must set out as soon as may be,’ said éomer. ‘even so we cannot hope to come to gondor’s aid today.’
merry waited to hear no more, but slipped away to get ready for the summons to the march. this was the last stage before the battle. it did not seem likely to him that many of them would survive it. but he thought of pippin and the flames in minas tirith and thrust down his own dread.
all went well that day, and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them. the wild men had put out a screen of wary hunters, so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. the

e behind filed up out of the trough of the stonewain valley they spread out and passed to camping-places under the grey trees. the king summoned the captains to council. éomer sent out scouts to spy upon the road; but old ghân shook his head.
‘no good to send horse-men,’ he said. ‘wild men have already seen all that can be seen in the bad air. they will come soon and speak to me here.’
the captains came; and then out of the trees crept warily other púkel-shapes so like old ghân that merry could hardly tell them apart. they spoke to ghân in a strange throaty language.
presently ghân turned to the king. ‘wild men say many things ‘ he said. ‘first, be wary! still many men in camp beyond dîn, an hour’s walk yonder,’ he waved his arm west towards the black beacon. ‘but none to see between here and stone-folk’s new walls. many busy there. walls stand up no longer: gorgûn knock them down with earth-thunder and with clubs of black iron. they are unwary and do not look

with mouth.’
it was night. on either side of the road the host of rohan was moving silently. now the road passing about the skirts of mindolluin turned southward. far away and almost straight ahead there was a red glow under the black sky and the sides of the great mountain loomed dark against it. they were drawing near the rammas of the pelennor; but the day was not yet come.
the king rode in the midst of the leading company, his household-men about him. elfhelm’s éored came next; and now merry noticed that dernhelm had left his place and in the darkness was moving steadily forward, until at last he was riding just in rear of the king’s guard. there came a check. merry heard voices in front speaking softly. out-riders had come back who had ventured forward almost to the wall. they came to the king.
‘there are great fires, lord,’ said one. ‘the city is all set about with flame, and the field is full of foes. but all seem drawn off to the assault. as well as we could guess, ther

the leading company rode off as swiftly as they could, for it was still deep dark, whatever change wídfara might forebode. merry was riding behind dernhelm, clutching with the left hand while with the other he tried to loosen his sword in its sheath. he felt now bitterly the truth of the old king’s words: in such a battle what would you do meriadoc? just this,’ he thought: ‘encumber a rider, and hope at best to stay in my seat and not be pounded to death by galloping hoofs!’
it was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood. they soon reached them; too soon for merry. wild cries broke out, and there w

as some clash of arms, but it was brief. the orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed, and they were quickly slain or driven off. before the ruin of the north-gate in the rammas the king halted again. the first éored drew up behind him and about him on either side. dernhelm kept close to the king, though elfhelm’s company was away on the right. grimbold’s men turned aside and passed round to a great gap in the wall further eastward.
merry peered from behind dernhelm’s back. far away, maybe ten miles or more, there was a great burning, but between it and the riders lines of fire blazed in a vast crescent, at the nearest point less than a league distant. he could make out little more on the dark plain, and as yet he neither saw any hope of morning, nor felt any wind, changed or unchanged.
now silently the host of rohan moved forward into the field of gondor, pouring in slowly but steadily, like the rising tide through breaches i

.
after a while the king led his men away somewhat eastward, to come between the fires of the siege and the outer fields. still they were unchallenged, and still théoden gave no signal. at last he halted once again. the city was now nearer. a smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. the horses were uneasy. but the king sat upon snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of minas tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. he seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. his heart beat slowly. time seemed poised in uncertainty. they were too late! too late was worse than never! perhaps théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.
then suddenly merry felt it at last, beyond doubt: a change. wind was in his face! light was glimmering. far, far away, in the south the clouds could be dimly seen as remote grey shapes, rolling up, drifting: morning lay beyond t

zgûl. to the air he had returned, summoning his steed ere the darkness failed, and now he was come again, bringing ruin, turning hope to despair, and victory to death. a great black mace he wielded.
but théoden was not utterly forsaken. the knights of his house lay slain about him, or else mastered by the madness of their steeds were borne far away. yet one stood there still: dernhelm the young, faithful beyond fear; and he wept, for he had loved his lord as a father. right through the charge merry had been borne unharmed behind him, until the shadow came; and then windfola had thrown them in his terror, and now ran wild upon the plain. merry crawled on all fours like a dazed beast, and such a horror was on him that he was blind and sick.
‘king’s man! king’s man!’ his heart cried within him. ‘you must stay by him. as a father you shall be to me, you said.’ but his will made no answer, and his body shook. he dared not open his eyes or look up.
then out of the blackness in his m

‘begone, foul dwimmerlaik, lord of carrion! leave the dead in peace!’
a cold voice answered: ‘come not between the nazgûl and his prey! or he will not slay thee in thy turn. he will bear thee away to the houses of lamentation, beyond all darkness, where thy flesh shall be devoured, and thy shrivelled mind be left naked to the lidless eye.’
a sword rang as it was drawn. ‘do what you will; but i will hinder it, if i may.’
‘hinder me? thou fool. no living man may hinder me!’
then merry heard of all sounds in that hour the strangest. it seemed that dernhelm laughed, and the clear voice was like the ring of steel. ‘but no living man am i! you look upon a woman. éowyn i am, éomund’s daughter. you stand between me and my lord and kin. begone, if you be not deathless! for living or dark undead, i will smite you, if you touch him.’
the winged creature screamed at her, but the ringwraith made no answer, and was silent, as if in sudden doubt. very amazement for a moment conqu

ered merry’s fear. he opened his eyes and the blackness was lifted from them. there some paces from him sat the great beast, and all seemed dark about it, and above it loomed the nazgûl lord like a shadow of despair. a little to the left facing them stood she whom he had called dernhelm. but the helm of her secrecy, had fallen from her, and her bright hair, released from its bonds, gleamed with pale gold upon her shoulders. her eyes grey as the sea were hard and fell, and yet tears were on her cheek. a

 sword was in her hand, and she raised her shield against the horror of her enemy’s eyes.
éowyn it was, and dernhelm also. for into merry’s mind flashed the memory of the face that he saw at the riding from dunharrow: the face of one that goes seeking death, having no hope. pity filled his heart and great wonder, and suddenly the slow-kindled courage of his race awoke. he clenched his hand. she should not die, so fair, so desperate at least she should not die alone, unaided.
the face of their enemy was not turned towards him, but still he hardly dared to move, dreading lest the deadly eyes should fall on him. slowly, slowly he

fell about her, and her hair shone in the sunrise.
out of the wreck rose the black rider, tall and threatening, towering above her. with a cry of hatred that stung the very ears like venom he let fall his mace. her shield was shivered in many pieces, and her arm was broken; she stumbled to her knees. he bent over her like a cloud, and his eyes glittered; he raised his mace to kill.
but suddenly he too stumbled forward with a cry of bitter pain, and his stroke went wide, driving into the ground. merry’s sword had stabbed him from behind, shearing through the black mantle, and passing up beneath the hauberk had pierced the sinew behind his mighty knee.
‘éowyn! éowyn!’ cried merry. then tottering, struggling up, with her last strength she drove her sword between crown and mantle, as the great shoulders bowed before her. the sword broke sparkling into many shards. the crown rolled away with a clang. éowyn fell forward upon her fallen foe. but lo! the mantle and hauberk were empty. shap

the wind, a voice bodiless and thin that died, and was swallowed up, and was never heard again in that age of this world.
and there stood meriadoc the hobbit in the midst of the slain, blinking like an owl in the daylight, for tears blinded him; and through a mist he looked on éowyn’s fair head, as she lay and did not move; and he looked on the face of the king, fallen in the midst of his glory, for snowmane in his agony had rolled away from him again; yet he was the bane of his master.
then merry stooped and lifted his hand to kiss it, and lo! théoden opened his eyes, and they were clear, and he spoke in a quiet voice though laboured.
‘farewell, master holbytla!’ he said. ‘my body is broken. i go to my fathers. and even in their mighty company i shall not now be ashamed. i felled the black serpent. a grim morn, and a glad day, and a golden sunset!’
merry could not speak, but wept anew. ‘forgive me, lord,’ he said at last, ‘if i broke your command, and yet have done no mor

e in your service than to weep at our parting.’
the old king smiled. ‘grieve not! it is forgiven. great heart will not be denied. live now in blessedness; and when you sit in peace with your pipe, think of me! for never now shall i sit with you in meduseld, as i promised, or listen to your herb-lore.’ he closed his eyes, and merry bowed beside him. presently he spoke again. ‘where is éomer? for my eyes darken, and i would see him ere i go. he must be king after me. and i would send word to éowyn. she, she would not have me leave her, and now i shall not see her again, dearer than daughter.’
‘lord, lord,’ began merry brokenly, ‘she is-‘; but at that moment there was a great clamour, and all about them horns and trumpets were blowing. merry looked round: he had forgotten the war, and all the world beside, and

ame the legions of morgul; and from the southward fields came footmen of harad with horsemen before them, and behind them rose the huge backs of the mûmakil with war-towers upon them. but northward the white crest of éomer led the great front of the rohirrim which he had again gathered and marshalled; and out of the city came all the strength of men that was in it, and the silver swan of dol amroth was borne in the van, driving the enemy from the gate.
for a moment the thought flitted through merry’s mind: ‘where is gandalf? is he not here? could he not have saved the king and éowyn?’ but thereupon éomer rode up in haste, and with him came the knights of the household that still lived and had now mastered their horses. they looked in wonder at the carcase of the fell beast that lay there: and their steeds would not go near. but éomer leaped from the saddle, and grief and dismay fell upon him as he came to the king’s side and stood there in silence.
then one of the knights took

apart from their foes and the fell beast and set spears about them. and afterwards when all was over men returned and made a fire there and burned the carcase of the beast; but for snowmane they dug a grave and set up a stone upon which was carved in the tongues of gondor and the mark:
faithful servant yet master’s bane
lightfoot’s foal, swift snowmane.
green and long grew the grass on snowmane’s howe, but ever black and bare was the ground where the beast was burned.
now slowly and sadly merry walked beside the bearers, and he gave no more heed to the battle. he was weary and full of pain, and his limbs trembled as with a chill. a great rain came out of the sea, and it seemed that all things wept for théoden and éowyn, quenching the fires in the city with grey tears. it was through a mist that presently he saw the van of the men of gondor approaching. imrahil, prince of dol amroth, rode up and drew rein before them.
‘what burden do you bear, men of rohan?’ he cried.
‘théoden

with that he turned away and went with pippin down towards the lower city. and even as they hastened on their way the wind brought a grey rain, and all the fires sank, and there arose a great smoke before them.

chapter 8

the houses of healing

a mist was in merry’s eyes of tears and weariness when they drew near the ruined gate of minas tirith. he gave little heed to the wreck and slaughter that lay about all. fire and smoke and stench was in the air; for many engines had been burned or cast into the fire-pits, and many of the slain also, while here and there lay many carcases of the great southron monsters, half-burned, or broken by stone-cast, or shot through the eyes by the valiant archers of morthond. the flying rain had ceased for a time, and the

ugh the jetsam of battle; and now out from the gate came some bearing litters. gently they laid éowyn upon soft pillows; but the king’s body they covered with a great cloth of gold, and they bore torches about him, and their flames, pale in the sunlight, were fluttered by the wind.
so théoden and éowyn came to the city of gondor, and all who saw them bared their heads and bowed; and they passed through the ash and fume of the burned circle, and went on and up along the streets of stone. to merry the ascent seemed agelong, a meaningless journey in a hateful dream, going on and on to some dim ending that memory cannot seize.
slowly the lights of the torches in front of him flickered and went out, and he was walking in a darkness; and he thought: ‘this is a tunnel leading to a tomb; there we shall stay forever.’ but suddenly into his dream there fell a living voice.
‘well, merry! thank goodness i have found you!’
he looked up and the mist before his eyes cleared a little. there wa

s pippin! they were face to face in a narrow lane, and but for themselves it was empty. he rubbed his eyes.
‘where is the king?’ he said. ‘and éowyn?’ then he stumbled and sat down on a doorstep and began to weep again.
‘they have gone up into the citadel,’ said pippin. ‘i think you must have fallen asleep on your feet and taken the wrong turning. when we found that you were not with them, gandalf sent me to look for you. poor old merry! how glad i am to see you again! but you are worn out, and i won’t bother you with any talk. but tell me, are you hurt, or wounded?’
‘no,’ said merry. ‘well, no, i don’t think so. but i can’t use my right arm, pippin, not since i stabbed him. and my sword burned all away like a piece of wood.’
pippin’s face was anxious. ‘well, you had better come with me as quick as you can,’ he said. ‘i wish i could carry you. you aren’t fit to walk any further. they shouldn’t have

let you walk at all; but you must forgive them. so many dreadful things have happened in the city, merry, that one poor hobbit coming in from the battle is easily overlooked.’
‘it’s not always a misfortune being overlooked,’ said merry. ‘i was overlooked just now by - no, no, i can’t speak of it. help me, pippin! it’s all going dark again, and my arm is so cold.’
‘lean on me, merry lad!’ said pippin. ‘come now! foot by foot. it’s not far.’
‘are you going to bury me?’ said merry.
‘no, indeed!’ said pippin, trying to sound cheerful, though his heart was wrung with fear and pity. ‘no, we are going to the houses of healing.’
they turned out of the lane that ran between tall houses and the outer wall of the fourth circle, and they regained the main street climbing up to the citadel. step by step they went, while merry swayed and murmured as one in sleep.

zed bergil beregond’s son.
‘hullo, bergil!’ he called. ‘where are you going? glad to see you again, and still alive!’
‘i am running errands for the healers,’ said bergil. ‘i cannot stay.’
‘don’t!’ said pippin. ‘but tell them up there that i have a sick hobbit, a perian mind you, come from the battle-field. i don’t think he can walk so far. if mithrandir is there, he will be glad of the message.’ bergil ran on.
‘i’d better wait here,’ thought pippin. so he let merry sink gently down on to the pavement in a patch of sunlight, and then he sat down beside him, laying merry’s head in his lap. he felt his body and limbs gently, and took his friend’s hands in his own. the right hand felt icy to the touch.
it was not long before gandalf himself came in search of them. he stooped over merry and caressed his brow; then he lifted him carefully. ‘he should have been borne in honour into this city,’ he said. ‘he has well repaid my trust; for if elrond had no

will not sound so ill, and telcontar i will be and all the heirs of my body.’
and with that they passed into the house; and as they went towards the rooms where the sick were tended gandalf told of the deeds of éowyn and meriadoc. ‘for,’ he said, ‘long have i stood by them and at first they spoke much in their dreaming, before they sank into the deadly darkness. also it is given to me to see many things far off.’
aragorn went first to faramir, and then to the lady éowyn, and last to merry. when he had looked on the faces of the sick and seen their hurts he sighed. ‘here i must put forth all such power and skill as is given to me,’ he said. ‘would that elrond were here, for he is the eldest of all our race, and has the greater power.’
and éomer seeing that he was sorrowful and weary said: ‘first you must rest, surely, and at the least eat a little?’
but aragorn answered: ‘nay, for these three, and most soon for faramir, time is running out. all speed is needed.’

rk, for he is valiant!’
‘he lies nearby in this house, and i will go to him,’ said gandalf. ‘éomer shall stay here for a while. but do not speak yet of war or woe, until you are made whole again. great gladness it is to see you wake again to health and hope, so valiant a lady!’
‘to health?’ said éowyn. ‘it may be so. at least while there is an empty saddle of some fallen rider that i can fill, and there are deeds to do. but to hope? i do not know.’
gandalf and pippin came to merry’s room, and there they found aragorn standing by the bed. ‘poor old merry!’ cried pippin, and he ran to the bedside, for it seemed to him that his friend looked worse, and a greyness was in his face, as if a weight of years of sorrow lay on him; and suddenly a fear seized pippin that merry would die.

then aragorn laid his hand on merry’s head, and passing his hand gently through the brown curls, he touched the eyelids, and called him by name. and when the fragrance of athelas stole through the room, like the scent of orchards, and of heather in the sunshine full of bees, suddenly merry awoke, and he said:
‘i am hungry. what is the time?’
‘past supper-time now,’ said pippin; ‘though i daresay i could bring you something, if they will let me.’
‘they will indeed,’ said gandalf. ‘and anything else that this rider of rohan may desire, if it can be found in minas tirith, where his name is in honour.’
‘good!’ said merry. ‘then i would like supper first, and after that a pipe.’ at that his face clouded. ‘no, not a pipe. i don’t think i’ll smoke again

.’
‘why not?’ said pippin.
‘well,’ answered merry slowly. ‘he is dead. it has brought it all back to me. he said he was sorry he had never had a chance of talking herb-lore with me. almost the last thing he ever said. i shan’t ever be able to smoke again without thinking of him, and that day, pippin, when he rode up to isengard and was so polite.’
‘smoke then, and think of him!’ said aragorn. ‘for he was a gentle heart and a great king and kept his oaths; and he rose out of the shadows to a last fair morning. though your service to

 him was brief, it should be a memory glad and honourable to the end of your days.’
merry smiled. ‘well then,’ he said, ‘if strider will provide what is needed, i will smoke and think. i had some of saruman’s best in my pack, but what became of it in the battle, i am sure i don’t know.’
‘master meriadoc,’ said aragorn, ‘if you think that i have passed through the mountains and the realm of gondor with fire and sword to bring herbs to a careless soldier who throws away his gear, you are mistaken. if your pack has not been found, then you must send for the herb-maste

merry seized his hand and kissed it. ‘i am frightfully sorry,’ he said. ‘go at once! ever since that night at bree we have been a nuisance to you. but it is the way of my people to use light words at such times and say less than they mean. we fear to say too much. it robs us of the right words when a jest is out of place.’

‘no,’ said merry. ‘i can’t. not yet, at any rate. but at least, pippin, we can now see them, and honour them. it is best to love first what you are fitted to love, i suppose: you must start somewhere and have some roots, and the soil of the shire is deep. still there are things deeper and higher; and not a gaffer could tend his garden in what he calls peace but for them, whether he knows about them or not. i am glad that i know about them, a little. but i don’t know why i am talking like this. where is th

chapter 9

the last debate

the morning came after the day of battle, and it was fair with light clouds and the wind turning westward. legolas and gimli were early abroad, and they begged leave to go up into the city; for they were eager to see merry and pippin.
‘it is good to learn that they are still alive,’ said gimli; ‘for they cost us great pains in our march over rohan, and i would not have such pains all wasted.’
together the elf and the dwarf entered minas tirith, and folk that saw them pass marvelled to see such companions; for legolas was fair of face beyond the measure of men, and he sang an elven-song in a clear voice as he walked in the morning; but gimli stalked beside him, stroking his beard and staring about him.
‘

‘yet seldom do they fail of their seed,’ said legolas. ‘and that will lie in the dust and rot to spring up again in times and places unlooked-for. the deeds of men will outlast us, gimli.’
‘and yet come to naught in the end but might-have-beens, i guess,’ said the dwarf.
‘to that the elves know not the answer,’ said legolas.
with that the servant of the prince came and led them to the houses of healing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting was a merry one. for a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief space in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of the city. then when merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the houses of healing behind them; and away southward before them was the anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of the sight even of legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of lebennin and south ithilien.
and now legolas fell silent, while the othe

 voices spoke to me of the sea. the sea! alas! i have not yet beheld it. but deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. alas! for the gulls. no peace shall i have again under beech or under elm.’
‘say not so!’ said gimli. ‘there are countless things still to see in middle-earth, and great works to do. but if all the fair folk take to the havens, it will be a duller world for those who are doomed to stay.’
‘dull and dreary indeed!’ said merry: ‘you must not go to the havens, legolas. there will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise dwarves like gimli, who need you. at least i hope so. though i feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come. how i wish it was all over, and well over!’
‘don’t be so gloomy!’ cried pippin. ‘the sun is shining, and here we are together for a day or two at least. i want to hear more about you all. come, gimli! you and legolas have mentioned your strange journey with

ll us some more?’
‘not willingly,’ said gimli. ‘for upon that road i was put to shame: gimli glóin’s son, who had deemed himself more tough than men, and hardier under earth than any elf. but neither did i prove; and i was held to the road only by the will of aragorn.’
‘and by the love of him also,’ said legolas. ‘for all those who come to know him come to love him after his own fashion, even the cold maiden of the rohirrim. it was at early morn of the day ere you came there, merry, that we left dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the lady éowyn, who lies now hurt in the house below. there was grief at that parting, and i was grieved to behold it.’
‘alas! i had heart only for myself,’ said gimli. ‘nay! i will not speak of that journey.’
he fell silent; but pippin and merry were so eager for news that at last legolas said: ‘i will tell you enough for your peace; for i felt not the horror, and i feared not the

ndard in battle. it was a great day and a great hour, whatever may come after.’
‘follow what may, great deeds are not lessened in worth,’ said legolas. ‘great deed was the riding of the paths of the dead, and great it shall remain, though none be left in gondor to sing of it in the days that are to come.’
‘and that may well befall,’ said gimli. ‘for the faces of aragorn and gandalf are grave. much i wonder what counsels they are taking in the tents there below. for my part, like merry, i wish that with our victory the war was now over. yet whatever is still to do, i hope to have a part in it, for the honour of the folk of the lonely mountain.’
‘and i for the folk of the great wood,’ said legolas, ‘and for the love of the lord of the white tree.’
then the companions fell silent, but a while they sat there in the high place, each busy with his own thoughts, while the captains debated.
when the prince imrahil had parted from legolas and gimli, at once he sent for éom

ered by the rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting towards cair andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out of the south the city was as well manned as might be. scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the cross-roads of the fallen king. all now was ready for the last throw.
legolas and gimli were to ride again together in the company of aragorn and gandalf, who went in the van with the dúnedain and the sons of elrond. but merry to his shame was not to go with them.
‘you are not fit for such a journey,’ said aragorn. ‘but do not be ashamed. if you do no more in this war, you have already earned great honour. peregrin shall go and represent the shirefolk; and do not grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match your deed. but in truth all now are in like danger. though it may be our part to find bitter end before the gate of mordor, if we do so, then

 you will come also to a last stand, either here or wherever the black tide overtakes you. farewell!’
and so despondently merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army. bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to march leading a company of the men of the city: he could not rejoin the guard until his case was judged. in that same company pippin was also to go, as a soldier of gondor. merry could see him not far off, a small but upright figure among the tall men of minas tirith.
at last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. troop by troop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. and long after they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the causeway, merry stood there. the last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling friendless and alone. everyone that

ybe of all the world of light. and out of the gathering mirk the nazgûl came with. their cold voices crying words of death; and then all hope was quenched.
pippin had bowed crushed with horror when he heard gandalf reject the terms and doom frodo to the torment of the tower; but he had mastered himself, and now he stood beside beregond in the front rank of gondor with imrahil’s men. for it seemed best to him to die soon and leave the bitter story of his life, since all was in ruin.
‘i wish merry was here,’ he heard himself saying, and quick thoughts raced through his mind, even as he watched the enemy come charging to the assault. ‘well, well, now at any rate i understand poor denethor a little better. we might die together, merry and i, and since die we must, why not? well, as he is not here, i hope he’ll find an easier end. but now i must do my best.’
he drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red and gold; and the flowing characters of númenor glinte

d like fire upon the blade. ‘this was made for just such an hour,’ he thought. ‘if only i could smite that foul messenger with it, then almost i should draw level with old merry. well, i’ll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. i wish i could see cool sunlight and green grass again!’
then even as he thought these things the first assault crashed into them. the orcs hindered by the mires that lay before the hills halted and poured their arrows into the defending ranks. but through them there came striding up, roaring like beasts, a great company of hill-trolls out of gorgoroth. taller and broader than men they were, and they were clad only in close-fittin

 days of the world seemed forgotten, and where all who entered were forgotten too.
‘i wonder if they think of us at all,’ he said, ‘and what is happening to them all away there.’ he waved his hand vaguely in the air before him; but he was in fact now facing southwards, as he came back to shelob’s tunnel, not west. out westward in the world it was drawing to noon upon the fourteenth day of march in the shire-reckoning. and even now aragorn was leading the black fleet from pelargir, and merry was riding with the rohirrim down the stonewain valley, while in minas tirith flames were rising and pippin watched the madness growing in the eyes of denethor. yet amid all their cares and fear the thoughts of their friends turned constantly to frodo and sam. they were not forgotten. but they were far beyond aid, and no thought could yet bring any help to samwise hamfast’s son; he was utterly alone.
he came back at last to the stone door of the orc-passage, and still unable to discover the c

orlorn and weary hobbit that no listening orc could possibly mistake for the clear song of an elven-lord. he murmured old childish tunes out of the shire, and snatches of mr. bilbo’s rhymes that came into his mind like fleeting glimpses of the country of his home. and then suddenly new strength rose in him, and his voice rang out, while words of his own came unbidden to fit the simple tune.
in western lands beneath the sun
the flowers may rise in spring,
the trees may bud, the waters run,

and swaying beeches bear

though here at journey’s end i lie
in darkness buried deep,
beyond all towers strong and high,
beyond all mountains steep,
above all shadows rides the sun
and stars for ever dwell:
i will not say the day is done,
nor bid the stars farewell.
`beyond all towers strong and high,’ he began again, and then he stopped short. he thought that he had heard a faint v

ch of the west, until their hearts, wounded with sweet words, overflowed, and their joy was like swords, and they passed in thought out to regions where pain and delight flow together and tears are the very wine of blessedness.
and at the last, as the sun fell from the noon and the shadows of the trees lengthened, he ended. ‘praise them with great praise!’ he said and knelt. and then aragorn stood up, and all the host arose, and they passed to pavilions made ready, to eat and drink and make merry while the day lasted.
frodo and sam were led apart and brought to a tent, and there their old raiment was taken off, but folded and set aside with honour; and clean linen was given to them. then gandalf came and in his arms, to the wonder of frodo, he bore the sword and the elven-cloak and the mithril-coat that had been taken from him in mordor. for sam he brought a coat of gilded mail, and his elven-cloak all healed of the soils and hurts that it had suffered; and then he laid before them two

but when, after the standing silence, wine was brought there came in two esquires to serve the kings; or so they seemed to be: one was clad in the silver and sable of the guards of minas tirith, and the other in white and green. but sam wondered what such young boys were doing in an army of mighty men. then suddenly as they drew near and he could see them plainly, he exclaimed:
‘why, look mr. frodo! look here! well, if it isn’t pippin. mr. peregrin took i should say, and mr. merry! how they have grown! bless me! but i can see there’s more tales to tell than ours.’
‘there are indeed,’ said pippin turning towards him. ‘and we’ll begin telling them, as soon as this feast is ended. in the meantime you can try gandalf. he’s not so close as he used to be, though he laughs now more than he talks. for the present merry and i are busy. we are knights of the city and of the mark, as i hope you observe.’
at last the glad day ended; and when the sun was gone and the

round moon rode slowly above the mists of anduin and flickered through the fluttering leaves, frodo and sam sat under the whispering trees amid the fragrance of fair ithilien; and they talked deep into the night with merry and pippin and gandalf, and after a while legolas and gimli joined them. there frodo and sam learned much of all that had happened to the company after their fellowship was broken on the evil day at parth galen by rauros falls; and still there was always more to ask and more to tell.

‘that you certainly are not,’ said gimli. ‘but what did i say? mortals cannot go drinking ent-draughts and expect no more to come of them than of a pot of beer.’
‘ent-draughts?’ said sam. ‘there you go about ents again; but what they are beats me.

and she did him a courtesy and walked back to the house. but faramir for a long while walked alone in the garden, and his glance now strayed rather to the house than to the eastward walls.
when he returned to his chamber he called for the warden, and heard all that he could tell of the lady of rohan.
‘but i doubt not, lord,’ said the warden, ‘that you would learn more from the halfling that is with us; for he was in the riding of the king, and with the lady at the end, they say.’
and so merry was sent to faramir, and while that day lasted they talked long together, and faramir learned much, more even than merry put into words; and he thought that he understood now something of the grief and unrest of éowyn of rohan. and in the fair evening faramir and merry walked in the garden, but she did not come.
but in the morning, as faramir came from the houses, he saw her, as she stood upon the walls; and she was clad all in white, and gleamed in the sun. and he called to her, and she came

the days that followed were golden, and spring and summer joined and made revel together in the fields of gondor. and tidings now came by swift riders from cair andros of all that was done, and the city made ready for the coming of the king. merry was summoned and rode away with the wains that took store of goods to osgiliath and thence by ship to cair andros; but faramir did not go, for now being healed he took upon him his authority and the stewardship, although it was only for a little while, and his duty was to prepare for one who should replace him.
and éowyn did not go, though her brother sent word begging her to come to the field of cormallen. and faramir wondered at this, but he saw her seldom, being busy with many matters; and

at last the day of departure came, and a great and fair company made ready to ride north from the city. then the kings of gondor and rohan went to the hallows and they came to the tombs in rath dínen, and they bore away king théoden upon a golden bier, and passed through the city in silence. then they laid the bier upon a great wain with riders of rohan all about it and his banner borne before; and merry being théoden’s esquire rode upon the wain and kept the arms of the king.
for the other companions steeds were furnished according to their stature; and frodo and samwise rode at aragorn’s side, and gandalf rode upon shadowfax, and pippin rode with the knights of gondor; and legolas and gimli as ever rode together upon arod.
in that riding went also queen arwen, and celeborn and galadriel with their folk, and elrond and his sons; and the princes of dol amroth and of ithilien, and many capt

 and the tale of the kings rolled on, and the horn of helm was loud in the mountains, until the darkness came and king théoden arose and rode through the shadow to the fire, and died in splendour, even as the sun, returning beyond hope, gleamed upon mindolluin in the morning.

hope he rekindled, and in hope ended;
over death, over dread, over doom lifted

but merry stood at the foot of the green mound, and he wept, and when the song was ended he arose and cried:
‘théoden king, théoden king! farewell! as a father you were to me. for a little while. farewell!’
when the burial was over and the weeping of women was stilled, and théoden was left at last alone in his barrow, then folk gathered to the golden hall for the great feast and put away sorrow; for théoden had lived to full years and ended in honour no less than the greatest of his sires. and wh

 were to go took leave of king éomer. aragorn and his knights, and the people of lórien and of rivendell, made ready to ride; but faramir and imrahil remained at edoras; and arwen evenstar remained also, and she said farewell to her brethren. none saw her last meeting with elrond her father, for they went up into the hills and there spoke long together, and bitter was their parting that should endure beyond the ends of the world.
at the last before the guests set oat éomer and éowyn came to merry, and they said: ‘farewell now, meriadoc of the shire and holdwine of the mark! ride to good fortune, and ride back soon to our welcome!’
and éomer said: ‘kings of old would have laden you with gifts that a wain could not bear for your deeds upon the fields of mundburg; and yet you will take naught, you say, but the arms that were given to you. this i suffer, for indeed i have no gift that is worthy; but my sister begs you to receive this small thing, as a memorial of dernhelm and of the

horns of the mark at the coming of the morning.’
then éowyn gave to merry an ancient horn, small but cunningly wrought all of fair silver with a baldric of green; and wrights had engraven upon it swift horsemen riding in a line that wound about it from the tip to the mouth; and there were set runes of great virtue.
‘this is an heirloom of our house,’ said éowyn. ‘it was made by the dwarves, and came from the hoard of scatha the worm. eorl the young brought it from the north. he that blows it at need shall set fear in the hearts of his enemies and joy in the he

then merry took the horn, for it could not be refused, and he kissed éowyn’s hand; and they embraced him, and so they parted for that time.
now the guests were ready, and they drank the stirrup-cup, and with great praise and friendship they departed, and came at length to helm’s deep, and there they rested two days. then legolas repaid his promise to gimli and went with him to the glittering caves; and when they returned he was silent, and would say only that gimli alone could find fit words to speak

‘the new age begins,’ said gandalf, ‘and in this age it may well prove that the kingdoms of men shall outlast you, fangorn my friend. but now come tell me: what of the task that i set you? how is saruman? is he not weary of orthanc yet? for i do not suppose that he will think you have improved the view from his windows.’
treebeard gave gandalf a long look, a most cunning look, merry thought. ‘ah!’ he said. ‘i thought you would come to that. weary of orthanc? very weary at last; but not so weary of his tower as he was weary of my voice. hoom! i gave him some long tales, or at least what might be thought long in your speech.’
‘then why did he stay to listen? did you go into orthanc?’ asked gandalf.
‘hoom, no, not into orthanc!’ said treebeard. ‘but he came to his window and listened, because he could not get news in any other way, and though he hated the ne

and celeborn said: ‘i do not know, eldest.’ but galadriel said: ‘not in middle-earth, nor until the lands that lie under the wave are lifted up again. then in the willow-meads of tasarinan we may meet in the spring. farewell!’
last of all merry and pippin said good-bye to the old ent, and he grew gayer as he looked at them. ‘well, my merry folk,’ he said, ‘will you drink another draught with me before you go?’
‘indeed we will,’ they said, and he took them aside into the shade of one of the trees, and there they saw that a great stone jar had been set. and treebeard filled three bowls, and they drank; and they saw his strange eyes looking at them over the rim of his bowl. ‘take care take care!’ he said. ‘for you have

‘so you have come to gloat too, have you, my urchins?’ he said. ‘you don’t care what a beggar lacks, do you? for you have all you want, food and fine clothes, and the best weed for your pipes. oh yes, i know! i know where it comes from. you would not give a pipeful to a beggar, would you?’
‘i would, if i had any,’ said frodo.
‘you can have what i have got left,’ said merry, ‘if you will wait a moment.’ he got down and searched in the bag at his saddle. then he handed to saruman a leather pouch. ‘take what there is,’ he said. ‘you are welcome to it; it came from the flotsam of isengard.’
‘mine, mine, yes and dearly bought!’ cried saruman, clutching at the pouch. ‘this is only a repayment in token; for you took more, i’ll be bound. still, a beggar must be grateful, if a thief returns him even a morsel of his own. well, it will serve you right wh

‘thank you!’ said merry. ‘in that case i will have my pouch back, which is not yours and has journeyed far with me. wrap the weed in a rag of your own.’
‘one thief deserves another,’ said saruman, and turned his back on merry, and kicked wormtongue, and went away towards the wood.
‘well, i like that!’ said pippin. ‘thief indeed! what of our claim for waylaying, wounding, and orc-dragging us through rohan?’
‘ah!’ said sam. ‘and bought he said. how, i wonder? and i didn’t like the sound of what he said about the southfarthing. it’s time we got back.’
‘i’m sure it is,’ said frodo. ‘but we can’t go any quicker, if we are to see bilbo. i am going to rivendell first, whatever happens.’

en he gave frodo his mithril-coat and sting, forgetting that he had already done so; and he gave him also three books of lore that he had made at various times, written in his spidery hand, and labelled on their red backs: translations from the elvish, by b.b.
to sam he gave a little bag of gold. ‘almost the last drop of the smaug vintage,’ he said. ‘may come in useful, if you think of getting married, sam.’ sam blushed.
‘i have nothing much to give to you young fellows,’ he said to merry and pippin, ‘except good advice.’ and when he had given them a fair sample of this, he added a last item in shire-fashion: ‘don’t let your heads get too big for your hats! but if you don’t finish growing up soon, you are going to find hats and clothes expensive.’
‘but if you want to beat the old took,’ said pippin, ‘i don’t see why we shouldn’t try and beat the bullroarer.’

‘alas! there are some wounds that cannot be wholly cured,’ said gandalf.

gandalf did not answer.
by the end of the next day the pain and unease had passed, and frodo was merry again, as merry as if he did not remember the blackness of the day before. after that the journey went well, and the days went quickly by; for they rode at leisure, and often they lingered in the fair woodlands where the leaves were red and yellow in the autumn sun. at length they came to weathertop; and it was then drawing towards evening and the shadow of the hill lay dark on the road. then frodo begged them to hasten, and he would not look towards the hill, but rode through its shadow with h

passed through the west-gate and on towards the shire. bill the pony was with them, and as before he had a good deal of baggage, but he trotted along beside sam and seemed well content.
‘i wonder what old barliman was hinting at,’ said frodo.
‘i can guess some of it,’ said sam gloomily. ‘what i saw in the mirror: trees cut down and all, and my old gaffer turned out of the row. i ought to have hurried back quicker.’
‘and something’s wrong with the southfarthing evidently,’ said merry. ‘there’s a general shortage of pipe-weed.’
‘whatever it is,’ said pippin, ‘lotho will be at the bottom of it: you can be sure of that.’
‘deep in, but not at the bottom,’ said gandalf. ‘you have forgotten saruman. he began to take an interest in the shire before mordor did.’
‘well, we’ve got you with us,’ said merry, ‘so things will soon be cleared up.’
‘i am with you at present,’ said gandalf, ‘but soon i shall not be. i am not coming to the shire. you mus

ike to see the old fellow again,’ he said. ‘i wonder how he is getting on?’
‘as well as ever, you may be sure,’ said gandalf. ‘quite untroubled and i should guess, not much interested in anything that we have done or seen, unless perhaps in our visits to the ents. there may be a time later for you to go and see him. but if i were you, i should press on now for home, or you will not come to the brandywine bridge before the gates are locked.’
‘but there aren’t any gates,’ said merry, ‘not on the road; you know that quite well. there’s the buckland gate, of course; but they’ll let me through that at any time.’
‘there weren’t any gates, you mean,’ said gandalf. ‘i think you will find some now. and you might have more trouble even at the buckland gate than you think. but you’ll! manage all right. good-bye dear friends! not for the last time, not yet. good-bye!’
he turned shadowfax off the road, and the great horse leaped the green dike that here ran beside

 it; and then at a cry from gandalf he was gone, racing towards the barrow-downs like a wind from the north.
‘well here we are, just the four of us that started out together,’ said merry. ‘we have left all the rest behind, one after another. it seems almost like a dream that has slowly faded.’
‘not to me,’ said frodo. ‘to me it feels more like falling asleep again.’

chapter 8

the scouring of the shire

it was after nightfall when, wet and tired, the travellers came at last to the brandywine, and they found the way barred. at either end of the bridge there was a great spiked gate; and on the further side of the river they could see that some new houses had been bui

the notice: no admittance between sundown and sunrise?’
‘of course we can’t read the notice in the dark.’ sam shouted back. ‘and if hobbits of the shire are to be kept out in the wet on a night like this, i’ll tear down your notice when i find it.’
at that a window slammed, and a crowd of hobbits with lanterns poured out of the house on the left. they opened the further gate, and some came over the bridge. when they saw the travellers they seemed frightened.
‘come along!’ said merry, recognizing one of the hobbits. ‘if you don’t know me, hob hayward, you ought to. i am merry brandybuck, and i should like to know what all this is about, and what a bucklander like you is doing here. you used to be on the hay gate.’
‘bless me! it’s master merry, to be sure, and all dressed up for fighting!’ said old hob. ‘why, they said you was dead! lost in the old forest by all accounts. i’m pleased to see you alive after all!’
‘then stop gaping at me through the bars, a

nd open the gate!’ said merry.
‘i’m sorry, master merry, but we have orders.’
‘whose orders?’
‘the chief’s up at bag end.’
‘chief? chief? do you mean mr. lotho?’ said frodo.
‘i suppose so, mr. baggins; but we have to say just “the chief” nowadays.’
‘do you indeed!’ said frodo. ‘well, i am glad he has dropped the baggins at any rate. but it is evidently high time that the family dealt with him and put him in his place.’
a hush fell on the hobbits beyond the gate. ‘it won’t do no good talking that way,’ said one.

‘he’ll get to hear of it. and if you make so much noise, you’ll wake the chief’s big man.’
‘we shall wake him up in a way that will surprise him,’ said merry. ‘if you mean that your precious chief has been hiring ruffians out of the wild, then we’ve not come back too soon.’ he sprang from his pony, and seeing the notice in the light of the lanterns, he tore it down and threw it over the gate. the hobbits backed away and made no move to open it. ‘come on, pippin!’ said merry. ‘two is enough.’
merry and pippin climbed the gate, and the hobbits fled. another horn sounded. out of the bigger house on the right a large heavy figure appeared against a light in the doorway.
‘what’s all this,’ he snarled as he came forward. ‘gate-breaking? you clear out, or i’ll break your filthy little necks!’ then he stopped, for he had caught the gleam of swords.
‘bill ferny,’ said merry, ‘if you don’t open that gate in ten seconds, you’ll regret it. i shall se

t steel to you, if you don’t obey. and when you have opened the gates you will go through them and never return. you are a ruffian and a highway-robber.’
bill ferny flinched and shuffled to the gate and unlocked it. ‘give me the key!’ said merry. but the ruffian flung it at his head and then darted out into the darkness. as he passed the ponies one of them let fly with his heels and just caught him as he ran. he went off with a yelp into the night and was never heard of again.
‘neat work, bill,’ said sam, meaning the pony.
‘so much for your big man,’ said merry. ‘we’ll see the chief later. in the meantime we want a lodging for the night, and as you seem to have pulled down the bridge inn and built this dismal place instead,

 you’ll have to put us up.’
‘i am sorry, mr. merry,’ said hob, ‘but it isn’t allowed.’
‘what isn’t allowed?’
taking in folk off-hand like and eating extra food, and all that, said hob.
‘what’s the matter with the place?’ said merry. ‘has it been a bad year, or what? i thought it had been a fine summer and harvest.’
‘well no, the year’s been good enough,’ said hob. ‘we grows a lot of food, but we don’t rightly know what becomes of it. it’s all these “gatherers” and “sharers”, i reckon, going round counting and measuring and taking off to storage. they do more gathering than sharing, and we never see most of the stuff again.’
‘oh come!’ said pippin yawning. ‘this is all too tiresome for me to

to bywater, and they set off at ten o’clock in the morning. they would have started earlier, only the delay so plainly annoyed the shirriff-leader. the west wind had shifted northward and it was turning colder, but the rain was gone.
it was rather a comic cavalcade that left the village, though the few folk that came out to stare at the ‘get-up’ of the travellers did not seem quite sure whether laughing was allowed. a dozen shirriffs had been told off as escort to the ‘prisoners’; but merry made them march in front, while frodo and his friends rode behind. merry, pippin, and sam sat at their ease laughing and talking and singing, while the shirriffs stumped along trying to look stern and important. frodo, however, was silent and looked rather sad and thoughtful.
the last person they passed was a sturdy old gaffer clipping a hedge. ‘hullo, hullo!’ he jeered. ‘now who’s arrested who?’
two of the shirriffs immediately left the party and went towards him. ‘leader!’ said

merry. ‘order your fellows back to their places at once, if you don’t want me to deal with them!’
the two hobbits at a sharp word from the leader came back sulkily. ‘now get on!’ said merry, and after that the travellers saw to it that their ponies’ pace was quick enough to push the shirriffs along as fast as they could go. the sun came out, and in spite of the chilly wind they were soon puffing and sweating.
at the three-farthing stone they gave it up. they had done nearly fourteen miles with only one rest at noon. it was now three o’clock. they were hungry and very footsore and they could not stand the pace.
‘well, come along in your own time!’ said merry. ‘we are goin

the ugly new houses all along pool side, where the hobbiton road ran close to the bank. an avenue of trees had stood there. they were all gone. and looking with dismay up the road towards bag end they saw a tall chimney of brick in the distance. it was pouring out black smoke into the evening air.
sam was beside himself. ‘i’m going right on, mr. frodo!’ he cried. ‘i’m going to see what’s up. i want to find my gaffer.’
‘we ought to find out first what we’re in for, sam,’ said merry. ‘i guess that the “chief” will have a gang of ruffians handy. we had better find someone who will tell us how things are round here.’
but in the village of bywater all the houses and holes were shut, and no one greeted them. they wondered at this, but they soon discovered the reason of it. when they reached the green dragon, the last house on the hobbiton side, now lifeless and with broken windows, they were disturbed to see half a dozen large ill-favoured men lounging against the inn-

wall; they were squint-eyed and sallow-faced.
‘like that friend of bill ferny’s at bree,’ said sam.
‘like many that i saw at isengard,’ muttered merry.
the ruffians had clubs in their hands and horns by their belts, but they had no other weapons, as far as could be seen. as the travellers rode up they left the wall and walked into the road, blocking the way.
‘where d’you think you’re going?’ said one, the largest and most evil-looking of the crew. ‘there’s no road for you any further. and where are those precious shirriffs?’
‘coming along nicely,’ said merry. ‘a little footsore, perhaps. we promised to wait for them here.

‘garn, what did i say?’ said the ruffian to his mates. ‘i told sharkey it was no good trusting those little fools. some of our chaps ought to have been sent.’
‘and what difference would that have made, pray?’ said merry. ‘we are not used to footpads in this country, but we know how to deal with them.’
‘footpads, eh?’ said the man: ‘so that’s your tone, is it? change it, or we’ll change it for you. you little folk are getting too uppish. don’t you trust too much in the boss’s kind heart. sharkey’s come now and he’ll do what sharkey says.’
‘and what may that be?’ said frodo quietly.
‘this country wants waking up and setting to rights,’ said the ruffian, ‘and sharkey’s going to

 a squint-eyed rascal calling the ring-bearer ‘little cock-a-whoop’. he cast back his cloak, flashed out his sword, and the silver and sable of gondor gleamed on him as he rode forward.

the sword glinted in the westering sun. merry and sam drew their swords also and rode up to support pippin; but frodo did not move. the ruffians gave back. scaring breeland peasants, and bullying bewildered hobbits, had been their work. fearless hobbits with bright swords and grim faces were a great surprise. and there was a note in the voices of these newcomers that they had not heard before. it chilled them with fear.
‘go!’ said merry. ‘if you trouble this village again, you will regret it.’ the three hobbits came on, and then th

e ruffians turned and fled running away up the hobbiton road; but they blew their horns as they ran.
‘well, we’ve come back none too soon,’ said merry.
‘not a day too soon. perhaps too late, at any rate to save lotho,’ said frodo. ‘miserable fool, but i am sorry for him.’
‘save lotho? whatever do you mean?’ said pippin. ‘destroy him i should say.’
‘i don’t think you quite understand things, pippin,’ said frodo. ‘lotho never meant things to come to this pass. he has been a wicked fool, but he’s caught now. the ruffians are on top, gathering, robbing and bullying, and running or ruining things as they like, in his name

 ‘well, i suppose it may come to that. but remember: there is to be no slaying of hobbits, not even if they have gone over to the other side. really gone over, i mean; not just obeying ruffians’ orders because they are frightened. no hobbit has ever killed another on purpose in the shire, and it is not to begin now. and nobody is to be killed at all, if it can be helped. keep your tempers and hold your hands to the last possible moment!’
‘but if there are many of these ruffians,’ said merry, ‘it will certainly mean fighting. you won’t rescue lotho, or the shire, just by being shocked and sad, my dear frodo.’
‘no,’ said pippin. ‘it won’t be so easy scaring them a second time. they were taken by surprise. you heard that horn-blowing? evidently there are other ruffians near at hand. they’ll be much bolder when there’s more of them together. we ought to think of taking cover somewhere for the night. after all we’re only four, even if we are armed.’
‘i’ve an i

dea,’ said sam. ‘let’s go to old tom cotton’s down south lane! he always was a stout fellow. and he has a lot of lads that were all friends of mine.’
‘no!’ said merry. ‘it’s no good “getting under cover”. that is just what people have been doing, and just what these ruffians like. they will simply come down on us in force, corner us, and then drive us out, or burn us in. no, we have got to do something at once.’
‘do what?’ said pippin.
‘raise the shire!’ said merry. ‘now! wake all our people! they hate all this, you can see: all of them except perhaps one or two rascals, and a few fools that want to be important, but don’t at all understand what is really going on. but shire-folk have been so comfortable so long they don’t know what to do. they just want a match, though, and they’ll go up in fire. the chief’s men must know that. they’ll try to stamp on us and put us out quick. we’ve only got a very short time.
‘sam, you can make a dash for

 and give them all some music they have never heard before.’
they rode back to the middle of the village. there sam turned aside and galloped off down the lane that led south to cotton’s. he had not gone far when he heard a sudden clear horn-call go up ringing into the sky. far over hill and field it echoed; and so compelling was that call that sam himself almost turned and dashed back. his pony reared and neighed.
‘on, lad! on!’ he cried. ‘we’ll be going back soon.’
then he heard merry change the note, and up went the horn-cry of buckland, shaking the air.
awake! awake! fear, fire, foes! awake!
fire, foes! awake!
behind him sam heard a hubbub of voices and a great din and slamming of doors. in front of him lights sprang out in the gloaming; dogs barked; feet came running. before he got to the lane’s end there was farmer cotton with three of his lads, young tom, jolly, and nick, hurrying towards him. they had axes in their hands, and barred the way.
‘nay! it’s not one of

s you have settled the ruffians!’
when sam got back he found the whole village roused. already, apart from many younger lads, more than a hundred sturdy hobbits were assembled with axes, and heavy hammers, and long knives, and stout staves: and a few had hunting-bows. more were still coming in from outlying farms.
some of the village-folk had lit a large fire, just to enliven things, and also because it was one of the things forbidden by the chief. it burned bright as night came on. others at merry’s orders were setting up barriers across the road at each end of the village. when the shirriffs came up to the lower one they were dumbfounded; but as soon as they saw how things were, most of them took off their feathers and joined in the revolt. the others slunk away.
sam found frodo and his friends by the fire talking to old tom cotton, while an admiring crowd of bywater folk stood round and stared.
‘well, what’s the next move?’ said farmer cotton.
‘i can’t say,’ said frodo,

said cotton. ‘there’s a good few down south in longbottom and by sarn ford, i hear; and some more lurking in the woody end; and they’ve sheds at waymeet. and then there’s the lockholes, as they call ‘em: the old storage-tunnels at michel delving that they’ve made into prisons for those as stand up to them. still i reckon there’s not above three hundred of them in the shire all told, and maybe less. we can master them, if we stick together.’
‘have they got any weapons?’ asked merry.
‘whips, knives, and clubs, enough for their dirty work: that’s all they’ve showed so far,’ said cotton. ‘but i dare say they’ve got other gear, if it comes to fighting. some have bows, anyway. they’ve shot one or two of our folk.’
‘there you are, frodo!’ said merry. ‘i knew we should have to fight. well, they started the killing.’
‘not exactly,’ said cotton. ‘leastways not the shooting. tooks started that. you see our dad mr. peregrin, he’s never had no truck wi

 three for prowling and robbing. after that the ruffians turned nastier. and they keep a pretty close watch on tookland. no one gets in nor out of it now.’
‘good for the tooks!’ cried pippin. ‘but someone is going to get in again, now. i am off to the smials. anyone coming with me to tuckborough?’
pippin rode off with half a dozen lads on ponies. ‘see you soon!’ he cried. ‘it’s only fourteen miles or so over the fields. i’ll bring you back an army of tooks in the morning.’ merry blew a horn-call after them as they rode off into the gathering night. the people cheered.
‘all the same,’ said frodo to all those who stood near, ‘i wish for no killing; not even of the ruffians, unless it must be done, to prevent them from hurting hobbits.’
‘all right!’ said merry. ‘but we shall be having a visit from the hobbiton gang any time now, i think. they won’t come just to talk things over. we’ll try to deal with them neatly, but we must be prepared for the worst. n

ow i’ve got a plan.’
‘very good,’ said frodo. ‘you make the arrangements.’
just then some hobbits, who had been sent out towards hobbiton, came running in. ‘they’re coming!’ they said. ‘a score or more. but two have gone off west across country.’
‘to waymeet, that’ll be,’ said cotton, ‘to fetch more of the gang. well, it’s fifteen mile each way. we needn’t trouble about them just yet.’
merry hurried off to give orders. farmer cotton cleared the street, sending everyone indoors, except the older hobbits who had weapons of some sort. they had not long to wait. soon they could hear loud voices, and then the tramping of heavy feet. presently a whole squad of the ruffians came down the road. they saw the barrier and laughed. they did not imagine that there was anything in this little land that would stand up to twenty of their kind together.
the hobbits opened the barrier and stood asid

‘well, you’re wanted anyhow,’ said the leader. ‘we want you. take him lads! lockholes for him, and give him something to keep him quiet!’
the men took one step forward and stopped short. there rose a roar of voices all round them, and suddenly they were aware that farmer cotton was not all alone. they were surrounded. in the dark on the edge of the firelight stood a ring of hobbits that had crept up out of the shadows. there was nearly two hundred of them, all holding some weapon.
merry stepped forward. ‘we have met before,’ he said to the leader, ‘and i warned you not to come back here. i warn you again: you are standing in the light and you are covered by archers. if you lay a finger on this farmer, or on anyone else, you will be shot at once. lay down any weapons that you have!’
the leader looked round. he was trapped. but he was not scared, not now with a score of his fellows to back him. he knew too little of hobbits to understand his peril. foolishly he decided t

o fight. it would be easy to break out.
‘at ‘em lads!’ he cried. ‘let ‘em have it!’
with a long knife in his left hand and a club in the other he made a rush at the ring, trying to burst out back towards hobbiton. he aimed a savage blow at merry who stood in his way. he fell dead with four arrows in him:
that was enough for the others. they gave in. their weapons were taken from them, and they were roped together, and marched off to an empty hut that they had built themselves, and there they were tied hand and foot, and locked up under guard. the dead leader was dragged off and buried.
‘seems almost too easy after all, don’t it?’ said cotton. ‘i said we could master them. but we needed a call. you came back in the nick o’ tim

‘there’s more to be done still,’ said merry. ‘if you’re right in your reckoning, we haven’t dealt with a tithe of them yet. but it’s dark now. i think the next stroke must wait until morning. then we must call on the chief.’
‘why not now?’ said sam. ‘it’s not much more than six o’clock. and i want to see my gaffer. d’you know what’s come of him, mr. cotton?’
‘he’s not too well, and not too bad, sam,’ said the farmer. ‘they dug up bagshot row, and that was a sad blow to him. he’s in one of them new hous

ainst the rules, of course. i’d have had him with me, but that wasn’t allowed.’
‘thank’ee indeed, mr. cotton, and i’ll never forget it,’ said sam. ‘but i want to see him. that boss and that sharkey, as they spoke of, they might do a mischief up there before the morning.’
‘all right, sam,’ said cotton. ‘choose a lad or two, and go and fetch him to my house. you’ll not have need to go near the old hobbiton village over water. my jolly here will show you.’
sam went off. merry arranged for look-outs round the village and guards at the barriers during the night. then he and frodo went off with farmer cotton. they sat with the family in the warm kitchen, and the cottons asked a few polite questions about their travels, but hardly listened to the answers: they were far more concerned with events in the shire.
‘it all began with pimple, as we call him,’ said farmer cotton; ‘and it began as soon as you’d gone off, mr. frodo. he’d funny ideas had pimple. seems he

‘who is this sharkey?’ said merry. ‘i heard one of the ruffians speak of him.’
‘the biggest ruffian o’ the lot, seemingly,’ answered cotton. ‘it was about last harvest, end o’ september maybe, that we first heard of him. we’ve never seen him, but he’s up at bag end; and he’s the real chief now, i guess. all the ruffians do what he says; and what he says is mostly hack, burn, and ruin; and now it s come to killing. there s no longer even any bad sense in it. they cut down trees and let ‘em lie, they burn ho

 ‘but the gang from waymeet will be along any time now.’
after breakfast a messenger from the tookland rode in. he was in high spirits. ‘the thain has raised all our country,’ he said, ‘and the news is going like fire all ways. the ruffians that were watching our land have fled off south, those that escaped alive. the thain has gone after them, to hold off the big gang down that way; but he’s sent mr peregrin back with all the other folk he can spare.’
the next news was less good. merry, who had been out all night, came riding in about ten o’clock. ‘there’s a big band about four miles away,’ he said. ‘they’re coming along the road from waymeet, but a good many stray ruffians have joined up with them. there must be close on a hundred of them; and they’re fire-raising as they come. curse them!’
‘ah! this lot won’t stay to talk, they’ll kill, if they can,’ said farmer cotton. ‘if tooks don’t come sooner, we’d best get behind cover and shoot without a

the tooks did come sooner. before long they marched in, a hundred strong, from tuckborough and the green hills with pippin at their head. merry now had enough sturdy hobbitry to deal with the ruffians. scouts reported that they were keeping close together. they knew that the countryside had risen against them, and plainly meant to deal with the rebellion ruthlessly, at its centre in bywater. but however grim they, might be, they seemed to have no leader among them who understood warfare. they came on without any precautions. merry laid his plans quickly.
the ruffians came tramping along the east road, and without halting turned up the

ay sloping up between high banks with low hedges on top. round a bend, about a furlong from the main road, they met a stout barrier of old farm-carts upturned. that halted them. at the same moment they became aware that the hedges on both sides, just above their heads, were all lined with hobbits. behind them other hobbits now pushed out some more waggons that had been hidden in a field, and so blocked the way back. a voice spoke to them from above.
‘well, you have walked into a trap,’ said merry. ‘your fellows from hobbiton did the same, and one is dead and the rest are prisoners. lay down your weapons! then go back twenty paces and sit down. any who try to break out will be shot.’
but the ruffians could not now be cowed so easily. a few of them obeyed, but were immediately set on by their fellows. a score or more broke back and charged the waggons. six were shot, but the remainder burst out, killing two hobbits, and then scattering across country in the direction of the woody end.

 two more fell as they ran. merry blew a loud horn-call, and there were answering calls from a distance.
‘they won’t get far,’ said pippin. ‘all that country is alive with our hunters now.’
behind, the trapped men in the lane, still about four score, tried to climb the barrier and the banks, and the hobbits were obliged to shoot many of them or hew them with axes. but many of the strongest and most desperate got out on the west side, and attacked their enemies fiercely, being now more bent on killing than escaping. se

veral hobbits fell, and the rest were wavering, when merry and pippin, who were on the east side, came across and charged the ruffians. merry himself slew the leader, a great squint-eyed brute like a huge orc. then he drew his forces off, encircling the last remnant of the men in a wide ring of archers.
at last all was over. nearly seventy of the ruffians lay dead on the field, and a dozen were prisoners. nineteen hobbits were killed, and some thirty were wounded. the dead ruffians were laden on waggons and hauled off to an old sand-pit nearby and there buried: in the battle pit, as it was afterwards called. the fallen hobbits were l

frodo had been in the battle, but he had not drawn sword, and his chief part had been to prevent the hobbits in their wrath at their losses, from slaying those of their enemies who threw down their weapons. when the fighting was over, and the later labours were ordered, merry, pippin, and sam joined him, and they rode back with the cottons. they ate a late midday meal, and then frodo said with a sigh: ‘well, i suppose it is time now that we dealt with the “chief”.’
‘yes indeed; the sooner the better,’ said merry. ‘and don’t be too gentle! he’s responsible for bringing in these ruffians, and for all the evil they have done.’
farmer cotton collected an escort of some two dozen sturdy hobbits. ‘for it’s only a guess that there is no ruffians lef

it was one of the saddest hours in their lives. the great chimney rose up before them; and as they drew near the old village across the water, through rows of new mean houses along each side of the road, they saw the new mill in all its frowning and dirty ugliness: a great brick building straddling the stream, which it fouled with a steaming and stinking overflow. all along the bywater road every tree had been felled.

‘don’t waste any more words on the fool, sam!’ said frodo. ‘i hope there are not many more hobbits that have become like this. it would be a worse trouble than all the damage the men have done.’
‘you are dirty and insolent, sandyman,’ said merry. ‘and also very much out of your reckoning. we are just going up the hill to remove your precious boss. we have dealt with his men.’
ted gaped, for at that moment he first caught sight of the escort that at a sign from merry now marched over the bridge. dashing back into the mill he ran out with a horn and blew it loudly.
‘save your breath!’ laughed merry. ‘i’ve a better.’ then lifting up his silver horn he winded it, and its clear call rang over the hill; and out of the holes and

 the once beloved place. the garden was full of huts and sheds, some so near the old westward windows that they cut off all their light. there were piles of refuse everywhere. the door was scarred; the bell-chain was dangling loose, and the bell would not ring. knocking brought no answer. at length they pushed and the door yielded. they went in. the place stank and was full of filth and disorder: it did not appear to have been used for some time.
‘where is that miserable lotho hiding?’ said merry. they had searched every room and found no living thing save rats and mice. ‘shall we turn on the others to search the sheds?’
‘this is worse than mordor!’ said sam. ‘much worse in a way. it comes home to you, as they say; because it is home, and you remember it before it was all ruined.’
‘yes, this is mordor,’ said frodo. ‘just one of its works. saruman was doing its work all the time, even when he thought he was working for himself. and the same with those that saruman trick

ed, like lotho.’
merry looked round in dismay and disgust. ‘let’s get out!’ he said. ‘if i had known all the mischief he had caused, i should have stuffed my pouch down saruman’s throat.’
‘no doubt, no doubt! but you did not, and so i am able to welcome you home.’ there standing at the door was saruman himself, looking well-fed and well-pleased; his eyes gleamed with malice and amusement.
a sudden light broke on frodo. ‘sharkey!’ he cried.
saruman laughed. ‘so you have heard the name, have you?

frodo looked down at the body with pity and horror, for as he looked it seemed that long years of death were suddenly revealed in it, and it shrank, and the shrivelled face became rags of skin upon a hideous skull. lifting up the skirt of the dirty cloak that sprawled beside it, he covered it over, and turned away.
‘and that’s the end of that,’ said sam. ‘a nasty end, and i wish i needn’t have seen it; but it’s a good riddance.’
‘and the very last end of the war, i hope,’ said merry.
‘i hope so,’ said frodo and sighed. ‘the very last stroke. but to think that it should fall here, at the very door of bag end! among all my hopes and fears at least i never expected that.’
‘i shan’t call it the end, till we’ve cleared up the mess,’ said sam gloomily. ‘and that’ll take a lot of time and work.’

the grey havens

the clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time than sam had feared. the day after the battle frodo rode to michel

old will whitfoot had been in the lockholes longer than any, and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he needed a lot of feeding up before he could look the part of mayor; so frodo agreed to act as his deputy, until mr. whitfoot was in shape again. the only thing that he did as deputy mayor was to reduce the shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers. the task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to merry and pippin, and it was soon done. the southern gangs, after hearing the news of the battle of bywater, fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the thain. before the year’s end the few survivors were rounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the borders.
meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and sam was kept very busy. hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them. now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages, from th

llers (for so they were now called by everyone), and asked their advice.
‘i wondered when you would think of it,’ said frodo. ‘open it!’
inside it was filled with a grey dust, soft and fine, in the middle of which was a seed, like a small nut with a silver shale. ‘what can i do with this?’ said sam.
‘throw it in the air on a breezy day and let it do its work!’ said pippin.
‘on what?’ said sam.
‘choose one spot as a nursery, and see what happens to the plants there,’ said merry.
‘but i’m sure the lady would not like me to keep it all for my own garden, now so many folk have suffered,’ said sam.
‘use all the wits and knowledge you have of your own, sam,’ said frodo, ‘and then use the gift to help your work and better it. and use it sparingly. there is not much here, and i expect every grain has a value.’
so sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the s

ork. so he was not at home in early march and did not know that frodo had been ill. on the thirteenth of that month farmer cotton found frodo lying on his bed; he was clutching a white gem that hung on a chain about his neck and he seemed half in a dream.
‘it is gone for ever,’ he said, ‘and now all is dark and empty.’
but the fit passed, and when sam got back on the twenty-fifth, frodo had recovered, and he said nothing about himself. in the meanwhile bag end had been set in order, and merry and pippin came over from crickhollow bringing back all the old furniture and gear, so that the old hole soon looked very much as it always had done.
when all was at last ready frodo said: ‘when are you going to move in and join me, sam?’
sam looked a bit awkward.
‘there is no need to come yet, if you don’t want to,’ said frodo. ‘but you know the gaffer is close at hand, and he will be very well looked after by widow rumble.’

or its weddings), and they came and lived at bag end. and if sam thought himself lucky, frodo knew that he was more lucky himself; for there was not a hobbit in the shire that was looked after with such care. when the labours of repair had all been planned and set going he took to a quiet life, writing a great deal and going through all his notes. he resigned the office of deputy mayor at the free fair that mid-summer, and dear old will whitfoot had another seven years of presiding at banquets.
merry and pippin lived together for some time at crickhollow, and there was much coming and going between buckland and bag end. the two young travellers cut a great dash in the shire with their songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful parties. ‘lordly’ folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and

ght you were going to enjoy the shire, too. for years and years, after all you have done.’
‘so i thought too, once. but i have been too deeply hurt, sam. i tried to save the shire, and it has been saved, but not for me. it must often be so, sam, when things are in danger: some one has to give them up, lose them, so that others may keep them. but you are my heir: all that i had and might have had i leave to you. and also you have rose, and elanor; and frodo-lad will come, and rosie-lass, and merry, and goldilocks, and pippin; and perhaps more that i cannot see. your hands and your wits will be needed everywhere. you will be the mayor, of course, as long as you want to be, and the most famous gardener in history; and you will read things out of the red book, and keep alive the memory of the age that is gone. so that people will remember the great danger and so love their beloved land all the more. and that will keep you as busy and as happy as anyone can be, as long as your part of the st

 came towards them frodo saw that gandalf now wore openly upon his hand the third ring, narya the great, and the stone upon it was red as fire. then those who were to go were glad, for they knew that gandalf also would take ship with them.
but sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home alone. but even as they stood there, and the elves were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode merry and pippin in great haste. and amid his tears pippin laughed.
‘you tried to give us the slip once before and failed, frodo.’ he said. ‘this time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. it was not sam, though, that gave you away this time, but gandalf himself!’
‘yes,’ said gandalf; ‘for it will be better to ride back three together ‘than one alone. well, here at last, dear friends, on the shores of the sea comes the end of our fellowship in middle-earth. go in peace

! i will not say: do not weep; for not all tears are an evil.’
then frodo kissed merry and pippin, and last of all sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of galadriel that frodo bore glimmered and was lost. and the ship went out into the high sea and passed on into the west, until at last on a night of rain frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. and then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house

rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.
but to sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the haven; and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost in the west. there still he stood far into the night, hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of middle-earth, and the sound of them sank deep into his heart. beside him stood merry and pippin, and they were silent.
at last the three companions turned away, and never again looking back they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they came back to the shire. but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road.
at last they rode over the downs and took the east road, and then merry and pippin rode on to buckland; and already they were singing again as they went. but sam turned to bywater, and so came back up the hill, as day was ending
