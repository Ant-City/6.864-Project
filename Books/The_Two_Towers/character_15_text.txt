but the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. he turned from the north back again to north, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth.
even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of the river. he stiffened. there were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of orcs. then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.
'the horn of boromir!' he cried. 'he is in need!' he sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. 'alas! an ill fate is on me this day, and all that i do goes amiss. where is sam?'
as he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. fierce and shrill rose the yells of the

orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. drawing his bright sword and crying elendil! elendil! he crashed through the trees.
a mile, maybe, from parth galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found boromir. he was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. but aragorn

saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. many orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.
aragorn knelt beside him. boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. at last slow words came. 'i tried to take the ring from frodo ' he said. 'i am sorry. i have paid.' his glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. 'they have gone: the halflings: the orcs have taken them. i think they are not dead. orcs bound them.' he paused and his eyes closed wearily. after a moment he spoke again.
'farewell, aragorn! go to minas tirith and save my people! i have failed.'
'no!' said aragorn, taking his hand and kissing his brow. 'you have conquered. few have gained such a victory. be at peace! minas tirith shall not fall!'
boromir smiled.
'which way did they go? was frodo there?' said aragorn.
but boromir did not speak again.
'alas!' said aragorn. 'thus passe

l clasping boromir's hand. so it was that legolas and gimli found him. they came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. gimli had his axe in hand, and legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. when they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.
'alas!' said legolas, coming to aragorn's side. 'we have hunted and slain many orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. we came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. i fear you have taken deadly hurt.'
'boromir is dead,' said aragorn. 'i am unscathed, for i was not here with him. he fell defending the hobbits, while i was away upon the hill.'
'the hobbits!' cried gimli 'where are they then? where is frodo?'
'i do not know,' answered aragorn wearily. 'before he died boromir told me that the orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead.

i sent him to follow merry and pippin; but i did not ask him if frodo or sam were with him: not until it was too late. all that i have done today has gone amiss. what is to be done now?'
'first we must tend the fallen,' said legolas. 'we cannot leave him lying like carrion among these foul orcs.'
'but we must be swift,' said gimli. 'he would not wish us to linger. we must follow the orcs, if there is hope that any of our company are living prisoners.'
'but we do not know whether the ring-bearer is with them or not ' said aragorn. 'are we to abandon him? must we not seek him first? an evil choice is now before us!'
'then let us do first what we must do,' said legolas. 'we have not the time or the tools to bury our comrade fitly, or to raise a mound over him. a cairn we might build.'
'the labour would be hard and long: there are no stones that we could use nearer than the water-s

ide,' said gimli.
'then let us lay him in a boat with his weapons, and the weapons of his vanquished foes,' said aragorn. 'we will send him to the falls of rauros and give him to anduin. the river of gondor will take care at least that no evil creature dishonours his bones.'
quickly they searched the bodies of the orcs, gathering their swords and cloven helms and shields into a heap. 'see!' cried aragorn. 'here we find tokens!' he picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf-bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. 'no orc-tools these!' he said. 'they were borne by the hobbits. doubtless the orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of westernesse, wound about with spells for t

he bane of mordor. well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. i will take these things, hoping against hope, to give them back.'
'and i,' said legolas, 'will take all the arrows that i can find, for my quiver is empty.' he searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the orcs were accustomed to use. he looked at them closely.
and aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: 'here lie many that are not folk of mordor. some are from the north, from the misty mountains, if i know anything of orcs and their kinds. and here are others strange to me. their gear is not after the manner of orcs at all!'
there were four goblin-soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. they were armed with short broad-bladed swords, not with the curved scim

itars usual with orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of men. upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an s-rune, wrought of some white metal.
'i have not seen these tokens before,' said aragorn. 'what do they mean?'
's is for sauron,' said gimli. 'that is easy to read.'
'nay!' said legolas. 'sauron does not use the elf-runes.'
'neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt o

's is for saruman, i guess,' he said at length. 'there is evil afoot in isengard, and the west is no longer safe. it is as gandalf feared: by some means the traitor saruman has had news of our journey. it is likely too that he knows of gandalf's fall. pursuers from moria may have escaped the vigilance of lórien, or they may have avoided that land and come to isengard by other paths. orcs travel fast. b

s they chose to send forth with him. it was only a short way, yet they found it no easy task, for boromir was a man both tall and strong.
at the water-side aragorn remained, watching the bier. while legolas and gimli hastened back on foot to parth galen. it was a mile or more, and it was some time before they came back, paddling two boats swiftly along the shore.
'there is a strange tale to tell!' said legolas. 'there are only two boats upon the bank. we could find no trace of the other.'
'have orcs been there?' asked aragorn.
'we saw no signs of them,' answered gimli. 'and orcs would have taken or destroyed all the boats, and the baggage as well.'
'i will look at the ground when we come there,' said aragorn.
now they laid boromir in the middle of the boat that was to bear him away. the grey hood and elven-cloak they folded and placed beneath his head. they combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. the golden belt of lórien gleamed about his waist. his helm they set bes

so they ended. then they turned their boat and drove it with all the speed they could against the stream back to parth galen.
'you left the east wind to me,' said gimli, 'but i will say naught of it.'
'that is as it should be,' said aragorn. 'in minas tirith they endure the east wind, but they do not ask it for tidings. but now boromir has taken his road. and we must make haste to choose our own.'
he surveyed the green lawn, quickly but thoroughly, stooping often to the earth. 'the orcs have been on this ground,' he said. 'otherwise nothing can be made out for certain. all our footprints are here, crossing and re-crossing. i cannot tell whether any of the hobbits have come back since the search for frodo began.' he returned to the bank, close to where the rill from the spring trickled out into the river. 'there are some clear prints here,' he said. 'a hobbit waded out into the water and back; but i cannot say how long ago.'
'how then do you read this riddle?' asked gimli.

low me; but plainly he did not do so. he guessed his master s mind and came back here before frodo had gone. he did not find it easy to leave sam behind!'
'but why should he leave us behind, and without a word?' said gimli. 'that was a strange deed!'
'and a brave deed,' said aragorn. 'sam was right, i think. frodo did not wish to lead any friend to death with him in mordor. but he knew that he must go himself. something happened after he left us that overcame his fear and doubt.'
'maybe hunting orcs came on him and he fled,' said legolas.
'he fled, certainly,' said aragorn, 'but not, i think, from orcs.' what he thought was the cause of frodo's sudden resolve and flight aragorn did not say. the last words of boromir he long kept secret.
'well, so much at least is now clear,' said legolas: 'frodo is no longer on this side of the river: only he can have taken the boat. and sam is with him; only he would have taken his pack.'
'our choice then,' said gimli, 'is either to take the remaining boa

t and follow frodo, or else to follow the orcs on foot. there is little hope either way. we have already lost precious hours.'
'let me think!' said aragorn. 'and now may i make a right choice and change the evil fate of this unhappy day!' he stood silent for a moment. 'i will follow the orcs,' he said at last. 'i would have guided frodo to mordor and gone with him to the end; but if i seek him now in the wilderness, i must abandon the captives to torment and death. my heart speaks clearly at last: the fate of the bearer is in my hands no longer. the company has played its part. yet we that remain cannot forsake our companions while we have strength left. come! we will go now. leave all that can be spared behind! we will press on by day and dark!'

ied it to the trees. they laid beneath it such of their goods as they did not need and could not carry away. then they left parth galen. the afternoon was fading as they came back to the glade where boromir had fallen. there they picked up the trail of the orcs. it needed little skill to find.
'no other folk make such a trampling,' said legolas. 'it seems their delight to slash and beat down growing things that are not even in their way.'
'but they go with a great speed for all that,' said aragorn, 'and they do not tire. and later we may have to search for our path in hard bare lands.'
'well, after them!' said gimli. 'dwarves too can go swiftly, and they do not tire sooner than orcs. but it will be a long chase: they have a long start.'

 and shadowy in the late night. they went on for a mile or more northwards. aragorn was searching. bent towards the ground, among the folds and gullies leading up into the western ridge. legolas was some way ahead. suddenly the elf gave a cry and the others came running towards him.
'we have already overtaken some of those that we are hunting,' he said. 'look!' he pointed, and they saw that what they had at first taken to be boulders lying at the foot of the slope were huddled bodies. five dead orcs lay there. they had been hewn with many cruel strokes, and two had been beheaded. the ground was wet with their dark blood.
'here is another riddle!' said gimli. 'but it needs the light of day and for that we cannot wait.'
'yet however you read it, it seems not unhopeful,' said legolas. 'enemies of the orcs are likely to be our friends. do any folk dwell in these hills?'
'no,' said aragorn. 'the rohirrim seldom come here, and it is far from minas tirith. it might be that some company of men wer

e hunting here for reasons that we do not know. yet i think not.'
'what do you think?' said gimli.
'i think that the enemy brought his own enemy with him,' answered aragorn. 'these are northern orcs from far away. among the slain are none of the great orcs with the strange badges. there was a quarrel, i guess: it is no uncommon thing with these foul folk. maybe there was some dispute about the road.'
'or about the captives,' said gimli. 'let us hope that they, too, did not meet their end here.'
aragorn searched the ground in a wide circle, but no other traces of the fight could be found. they went on. already the eastward sky was turning pale; the stars were fading, and a grey light was slowly growing. a little further north they came to a fold i

n which a tiny stream, falling and winding, had cut a stony path down into the valley. in it some bushes grew, and there were patches of grass upon its sides.
'at last!' said aragorn. 'here are the tracks that we seek! up this water-channel: this is the way that the orcs went after their debate.'
swiftly now the pursuers turned and followed the new path. as if fresh from a night's rest they sprang from stone to stone. at last they reached the crest of the grey hill, and a sudden breeze blew in their hair and stirred their cloaks: the chill wind of dawn.
turning back they saw across the river the far hills kindled. day leaped into the sky. the red rim of the sun rose over the shoulders of the dark land. before them in the west the world lay still, formless and g

 and more urgent; there is something moving over the plain!'
'many things,' said legolas. 'it is a great company on foot; but i cannot say more, nor see what kind of folk they may be. they are many leagues away: twelve, i guess; but the flatness of the plain is hard to measure.'
'i think, nonetheless, that we no longer need any trail to tell us which way to go,' said gimli. 'let us find a path down to the fields as quick as may be.'
'i doubt if you will find a path quicker than the one that the orcs chose,' said aragorn.
they followed their enemies now by the clear light of day. it seemed that the orcs had pressed on with all possible speed. every now and again the pursuers found things that had been dropped or cast away: food-bags, the rinds and crusts of hard grey bread. a torn black cloak, a heavy iron-nailed shoe broken on the stones. the trail led them north along the top of the escarpment, and at length they came to a deep cleft carved in the rock by a stream that splashed noisily do

 the fens of entwash vale far away. they seemed to have left winter clinging to the hills behind. here the air was softer and warmer, and faintly scented, as if spring was already stirring and the sap was flowing again in herb and leaf. legolas took a deep breath, like one that drinks a great draught after long thirst in barren places.
'ah! the green smell!' he said. 'it is better than much sleep. let us run!'
'light feet may run swiftly here,' said aragorn. 'more swiftly, maybe, than iron-shod orcs. now we have a chance to lessen their lead!'
they went in single file, running like hounds on a strong scent, and an eager light was in their eyes. nearly due west the broad swath of the marching orcs tramped its ugly slot; the sweet grass of rohan had been bruised and blackened as they passed. presently aragorn gave a cry and turned aside. 'stay!' he shouted. 'do not follow me yet!' he ran quickly to the right, away from the main trail; for he had seen footprints that went that way, branching

 pursue in vain.'
'let us hope that he did not pay too dearly for his boldness,' said legolas. 'come! let us go on! the thought of those merry young folk driven like cattle burns my heart.'
the sun climbed to the noon and then rode slowly down the sky. light clouds came up out of the sea in the distant south and were blown away upon the breeze. the sun sank. shadows rose behind and reached out long arms from the east. still the hunters held on. one day now had passed since boromir fell, and the orcs were yet far ahead. no longer could any sight of them be seen in the level plains.
as nightshade was closing about them aragorn halted. only twice in the day's march had they rested for a brief while, and twelve leagues now lay between them and the eastern wall where they had stood at dawn.
'we have come at last to a hard choice,' he said. 'shall we rest by night, or shall we go on while our will and strength hold?'
'unless our enemies rest also, they will leave us far behind, if we stay to sle

'but if we walk by night, we cannot follow their trail,' said gimli.
'the trail is straight, and turns neither right nor left, as far as my eyes can see,' said legolas.
'maybe, i could lead you at guess in the darkness and hold to the line,' said aragorn; 'but if we strayed, or they turned aside, then when light came there might be long delay before the trail was found again.'
'and

 there is this also,' said gimli: 'only by day can we see if any tracks lead away. if a prisoner should escape, or if one should be carried off, eastward, say, to the great river, towards mordor, we might pass the signs and never know it.'
'that is true,' said aragorn. 'but if i read the signs back yonder rightly, the orcs of the white hand prevailed, and the whole company is now bound for isengard. their present course bears me out.'
'yet it would be rash to be sure of their counsels,' said gimli. 'and what of escape? in the dark we should have passed the signs that led you to the brooch.'
'the orcs will be doubly on their guard since then, and the prisoners even wearier,' said legolas. 'there will be no escape again, if we do not contrive it. how that is to be done cannot be guessed, but first we must overtake

wandered much, living in camp and tent, even in winter-time. but now all the land was empty, and there was silence that did not seem to be the quiet of peace.
at dusk they halted again. now twice twelve leagues they had passed over the plains of rohan and the wall of the emyn muil was lost in the shadows of the east. the young moon was glimmering in a misty sky, but it gave small light, and the stars were veiled.
'now do i most grudge a time of rest or any halt in our chase ' said legolas. 'the orcs have run before us, as if the very whips of sauron were behind them. i fear they have already reached the forest and the dark hills, and even now are passing into the shadows of the trees.'
gimli ground his teeth. 'this is a bitter end to our hope and to all our toil!' he said.
'to hope, maybe, but not to toil,' said aragorn. 'we shall not turn back here. yet i am weary.' he gazed back along the way that they had come towards the night gathering in the east. 'there is something strange at work

and the river wandering deep in dim thickets of reed and rush. just to the west of the southernmost slope there was a great ring, where the turf had been torn and beaten by many trampling feet. from it the orc-trail ran out again, turning north along the dry skirts of the hills. aragorn halted and examined the tracks closely.
'they rested here a while,' he said, 'but even the outward trail is already old. i fear that your heart spoke truly, legolas: it is thrice twelve hours, i guess, since the orcs stood where we now stand. if they held to their pace, then at sundown yesterday they would reach the borders of fangorn.'
'i can see nothing away north or west but grass dwindling into mist,' said gimli. 'could we see the forest, if we climbed the hills?'
'it is still far away,' said aragorn. 'if i remember rightly, these downs run eight leagues or more to the north, and then north-west to the issuing of the entwash there lies still a wide land. another fifteen leagues it may be.'

 happened here of late, nor in what mind the rohirrim may now be between the traitor saruman and the threat of sauron. they have long been the friends of the people of gondor, though they are not akin to them. it was in forgotten years long ago that eorl the young brought them out of the north, and their kinship is rather with the bardings of dale, and with the beornings of the wood, among whom may still be seen many men tall and fair, as are the riders of rohan. at least they will not love the orcs.'
'but gandalf spoke of a rumour that they pay tribute to mordor ' said gimli.
'i believe it no more than did boromir,' answered aragorn.
'you will soon learn the truth,' said legolas. 'already they approach.'
at length even gimli could hear the distant beat of galloping hoofs. the horsemen, following the trail, had turned from the river, and were drawing near the downs. they were riding like the wind.
now the cries of clear strong voices came ringing over the fields. suddenly they swept up wit

 were already fitted to the string. then one rode forward, a tall man, taller than all the rest; from his helm as a crest a white horsetail flowed. he advanced until the point of his spear was within a foot of aragorn's breast. aragorn did not stir.
'who are you, and what are you doing in this land?' said the rider, using the common speech of the west, in manner and tone like to the speech of boromir, man of gondor.
'i am called strider,' answered aragorn. 'i came out of the north. i am hunting orcs.'
the rider leaped from his horse. giving his spear to another who rode up and dismounted at his side, he drew his sword and stood face to face with aragorn, surveying him keenly, and not without wonder. at length he spoke again.
'at first i thought that you yourselves were orcs,' he said; 'but now i see that it is not so. indeed you know little of orcs, if you go hunting them in this fashion. they were swift and well-armed, and they were many. you would have changed from hunters to prey, if ev

'i serve no man,' said aragorn; 'but the servants of sauron i pursue into whatever land they may go. there are few among mortal men who know more of orcs; and i do not hunt them in this fashion out of choice. the orcs whom we pursued took captive two of my friends. in such need a man that has no horse will go on foot, and he will not ask for leave to follow the trail. nor will he count the heads of the enemy save with a sword. i am not weaponless.'

'that you need not pursue them further,' said éomer. 'the orcs are destroyed.'
'and our friends?'
'we found none but orcs.'
'but that is strange indeed,' said aragorn. 'did you search the slain? were there no bodies other than those of orc-kind? they would be small. only children to your eyes, unshod but clad in grey.'
'there were no dwarves nor children,' said éomer. 'we counted all the slain and despoiled them, and then we piled the carcases and burned them, as is our custom. the ashes are smoking still.'

'it is tidings more grievous than any in this land can understand, though it may touch them sorely ere the year is much older,' said aragorn. 'but when the great fall, the less must lead. my part it has been to guide our company on the long road from moria. through lórien we came - of which it were well that you should learn the truth ere you speak of it again - and thence down the leagues of the great river to the falls of rauros. there boromir was slain by the same orcs whom you destroyed.'
'your news is all of woe!' cried éomer in dismay. 'great harm is this death to minas tirith, and to us all. that was a worthy man! all spoke his praise. he came seldom to the mark, for he was ever in the wars on the east-borders; but i have seen him. more like to the swift sons of eorl than to the grave men of gondor he seemed to me, and likely to prove a great captain of his people when his time came. but we have had no word of this grief out of gondor. when did he fall?'

'then you do not pay tribute to sauron?' said gimli.
'we do not and we never have.' said éomer with a flash of his eyes; 'though it comes to my ears that that lie has been told. some years ago the lord of the black land wished to purchase horses of us at great price, but we refused him. for he puts beasts to evil use. then he sent plundering orcs, and they carry off what they can, choosing always the black horses: few of these are now left. for that reason our feud with the orcs is bitter.
'but at this time our chief concern is with saruman. he has claimed lordship over all this land, and there has been war between us for many months. he has taken orcs into his service, and wolf-riders, and evil men, and he has closed the gap against us, so that we are likely to be beset both east and west.

'indeed in this riding north i went without the king's leave, for in my absence his house is left with little guard. but scouts warned me of the orc-host coming down out of the east wall three nights ago, and among them they reported that some bore the white badges of saruman. so suspecting what i most fear, a league between orthanc and the dark tower, i led forth my éored, men of my own household; and we overtook the orcs at nightfall two days ago, near to the borders of the entwood. there we surrounded them, and gave battle yesterday at dawn. fifteen of my men i lost, and twelve horses alas! for the orcs were greater in number than we counted on. others joined them. coming out of the east across the great river: their trail is plain to see a little north of this spot. and others, too, came out of the forest. great orcs, who also bore the white hand of isengard: that kind is stronger and more fell than all other

'hope does not remain,' said éomer. 'you will not find your friends on the north-borders.'
'yet my friends are not behind. we found a clear token not far from the east wall that one at least of them was still alive there. but between the wall and the downs we have found no other trace of them, and no trail has turned aside, this way or that, unless my skill has wholly left me.'
'then what do you think has become of them?'
'i do not know. they may have been slain and burned among the orcs; but that you will say cannot be, and i do not fear it. i can only think that they were carried off into the forest before the battle, even before you encircled your foes, maybe. can you swear that none escaped your net in such a way?'
'i would swear that no orc escaped after we sighted them,' said éomer. 'we reached the forest-eaves before them, and if after that any living thing broke through our ring, then it was no orc and had some elvish power.'

en he again dismounted and examined the ground, going backwards and forwards on foot.
'there is little to discover,' he said when he returned. 'the main trail is all confused with the passage of the horsemen as they came back; their outward course must have lain nearer the river. but this eastward trail is fresh and clear. there is no sign there of any feet going the other way, back towards anduin. now we must ride slower, and make sure that no trace or footstep branches off on either side. the orcs must have been aware from this point that they were pursued; they may have made some attempt to get their captives away before they were overtaken.'
as they rode forward the day was overcast. low grey clouds came over the wold. a mist shrouded the sun. ever nearer the tree-clad slopes of fangorn loomed, slowly darkling as the sun went west. they saw no sign of any trail to right or left, but here and there they passed single orcs, fallen in their tracks as they ran, with grey-feathered arrows s

aragorn and his companions searched far and wide about the field of battle, but the light faded, and evening soon drew down, dim and misty. by nightfall they had discovered no trace of merry and pippin.
'we can do no more,' said gimli sadly. 'we have been set many riddles since we came to tol brandir, but this is the hardest to unravel. i would guess that the burned bones of the hobbits are now mingled with the orcs'. it will be hard news for frodo, if he lives to hear it; and hard too for the old hobbit who waits in rivendell. elrond was against their coming.'

'but gandalf chose to come himself, and he was the first to be lost ' answered gimli. 'his foresight failed him.'

a little way beyond the battle-field they made their camp under a spreading tree: it looked like a chestnut, and yet it still bore many broad brown leaves of a former year, like dry hands with long splayed fingers; they rattled mournfully in the night-breeze.
gimli shivered. they had brought only one blanket apiece. 'let us light a fire,' he said. 'i care no longer for the danger. let the orcs come as thick as summer-moths round a candle!'
'if those unhappy hobbits are astray in the woods, it might draw them hither,' said legolas.
'and it might draw other things, neither orc nor hobbit,' said aragorn. 'we are near to the mountain-marches of the traitor saruman. also we are on the very edge of fangorn, and it is perilous to touch the trees of that wood, it is said.'
'but the rohirrim made a great burning here yesterday,' said gimli, 'and they felled trees for the fire, as can be seen.

o hundreds of hideous orc-faces grinned at him out of the shadows, hundreds of hideous arms grasped at him from every side. where was merry?
he woke. cold air blew on his face. he was lying on his back. evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. he turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. his wrists, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. beside him merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. all about them sat or stood a great company of orcs.
slowly in pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream-shadows. of course: he and merry had run off into the woods. what had come over them? why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old strider? they had run a long way shouting--he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see merry and pippin until they were almost in their a

rms. then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. merry and he had drawn their swords, but the orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried only to lay hold of them, even when merry had cut off several of their arms and hands. good old merry!
then boromir had come leaping through the trees. he had made them fight. he slew many of them and the rest fled. but they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked again. by a hundred orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at boromir. boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fierce than ever. pippin did not remember much more. his last memo was of boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.
'i suppose i was knocked on the head,' he said to himself. 'i wonder if poor m

he could not answer the questions. he felt cold and sick. 'i wish gandalf had never persuaded elrond to let us come,' he thought. 'what good have i been? just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. and now i have been stolen and i am just a piece of luggage for the orcs. i hope strider or someone will come and claim us! but ought i to hope for it? won't that throw out all the plans? i wish i could get free!'
he struggled a little, quite uselessly. one of the orcs sitting near laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. 'rest while you can, little fool!' he said then to pippin, in the common speech, which he made almost as hideous as his own language. 'rest while you can! we'll find a use for your legs before long. you'll wish you had

terrified pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles was growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. to take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. there were many voices round about, and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.
to pippin's surprise he found that much of the talk was intelligible many of the orcs were using ordinary language. apparently the members of two or three quite different tribes were present, and they could not understand one another's orc-speech. there was an angry debate concerning what they were to do now: which way they were to take and what should be done with the prisoners.
'there's no time to kill them properly,' said one. 'no time for play on this trip.'
'that can't be helped,' said another. 'but why not kill them quick, kill them now? they're a cursed nuisance, and we'r

ng drawn. cautiously pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. his guards had gone to join in the fray. in the twilight he saw a large black orc, probably uglúk, standing facing grishnákh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the ground. round them were many smaller goblins. pippin supposed that these were the ones from the north. they had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack uglúk.
uglúk shouted, and a number of other orcs of nearly his own size ran up. then suddenly, without warning, uglúk sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. grishnákh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. the others gave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over merry's prostrate form with a curse. yet that probably saved his life, for uglúk's followers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. it was the yellow-fanged guard. his body fell right on top of p

'now,' thought pippin, 'if only it takes that ugly fellow a little while to get his troop under control, i've got a chance.' a gleam of hope had come to him. the edge of the black knife had snicked his arm, and then slid down to his wrist. he felt the blood trickling on to his hand, but he also felt the cold touch of steel against his skin.
the orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the northerners were still unwilling, and the isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed. there was much cursing and confusion. for the moment pippin was unwatched. his legs were securely bound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands were in front of him. he could move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. he pushed the dead orc to one side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wri

a shadow bent over pippin. it was uglúk. 'sit up!' said the orc. 'my lads are tired of lugging you about. we have got to climb down and you must use your legs. be helpful now. no crying out, no trying to escape. we have ways of paying for tricks that you won't like, though they won't spoil your usefulness for the master.'
he cut the thongs round pippin's legs and ankles, picked him up by his hair and stood him on his feet. pippin fell down, and uglúk dragged him up by his hair again. several orcs laughed. uglúk thrust a flask between his teeth and poured some burning liquid down his throat: he felt a hot fierce glow flow through him. the pain in his legs and ankles vanished. he could stand.
'now for the other!' said uglúk. pippin saw him go to merry, who was lying close by, and kick him. merry groaned. seizing him roughly uglúk pulled him into a sitting position, and tore the bandage off his head. then he smeared the wound with some dark stuff out of a small wooden box. merry cried o

the orcs clapped and hooted. 'can't take his medicine,' they jeered. 'doesn't know what's good for him. ai! we shall have some fun later.'
but at the moment uglúk was not engaged in sport. he needed speed and had to humour unwilling followers. he was healing merry in orc-fashion; and his treatment worked swiftly. when he had forced a drink from his flask down the hobbit's throat, cut his leg-bonds, and dragged him to his feet, merry stood up, looking pale but grim and defiant, and very much alive. the

brown scar to the end of his days.
'hullo, pippin!' he said. 'so you've come on this little expedition, too? where do we get bed and breakfast?'
'now then!' said uglúk. 'none of that! hold your tongues. no talk to one another. any trouble will be reported at the other end, and he'll know how to pay you. you'll get bed and breakfast all right: more than you can stomach.'
the orc-band began to descend a narrow ravine leading down into the misty plain below. merry and pippin, separated by a dozen orcs or more, climbed down with them. at the bottom they stepped on to grass, and the hearts of the hobbits rose.
'now straight on!' shouted uglúk. 'west and a little north. follow lugdush.'
'but what are we going to do at sunrise?' said some of the northerners.
'go on running,' said uglúk. 'what do you think? sit on the grass and wait for the whiteskins to join the picnic?'
'but we can't run in the sunlight.'
'you'll run with me behind you,' said uglúk. 'run! or you'll never see your beloved hol

es again. by the white hand! what's the use of sending out mountain-maggots on a trip, only half trained. run, curse you! run while night lasts!'
then the whole company began to run with the long loping strides of orcs. they kept no order, thrusting, jostling, and cursing; yet their speed was very great. each hobbit had a guard of three. pippin was far back in the line. he wondered how long he would be able to go on at this pace: he had had no food since the morning. one of his guards had a whip. but at present the orc-liquor was still hot in him. his wits, too, were wide-awake.
every now and again there came into his mind unbidden a vision of the keen face of strider bending over a dark trail, and running, r

unning behind. but what could even a ranger see except a confused trail of orc-feet? his own little prints and merry's were overwhelmed by the trampling of the iron-shod shoes before them and behind them and about them.
they had gone only a mile or so from the cliff when the land sloped down into a wide shallow depression, where the ground was soft and wet. mist lay there, pale-glimmering in the last rays of the sickle moon. the dark shapes of the orcs in front grew dim, and then were swallowed up.
'ai! steady now!' shouted uglúk from the rear.
a sudden thought leaped into pippin's mind, and he acted on it at once. he swerved aside to the right, and dived out of the reach of his clutching guard, headfirst into the mist; he landed sprawling on the grass.
'halt!' yelled uglúk.
there was for a moment turmoil and confusion. pippin sprang up and ran. but the orcs were after him. some suddenly loomed up right in front of him.
'no hope of escape!'

e stifled a cry.
'enough!' shouted uglúk running up. 'he's still got to run a long way yet. make 'em both run! just use the whip as a reminder.'
'but that's not all,' he snarled, turning to pippin. 'i shan't forget. payment is only put off. leg it!'
neither pippin nor merry remembered much of the later part of the journey. evil dreams and evil waking were blended into a long tunnel of misery, with hope growing ever fainter behind. they ran, and they ran, striving to keep up the pace set by the orcs, licked every now and again with a cruel thong cunningly handled. if they halted or stumbled, they were seized and dragged for some distance.
the warmth of the orc-draught had gone. pippin felt cold and sick again. suddenly he fell face downward on the turf. hard hands with rending nails gripped and lifted him. he was carried like a sack once more, and darkness grew about him: whether the darkness of another night, or a blindness of his eyes, he could not tell.
dimly he became aware of voices c

lamouring: it seemed that many of the orcs were demanding a halt. uglúk was shouting. he felt himself flung to the ground, and he lay as he fell, till black dreams took him. but he did not long escape from pain; soon the iron grip of merciless hands was on him again. for a long time he was tossed and shaken, and then slowly the darkness gave way, and he came back to the waking world and found that it was morning. orders were shouted and he was thrown roughly on the grass.
there he lay for a while, fighting with despair. his head swam,

 and a strip of raw dried flesh. he ate the stale grey bread hungrily, but not the meat. he was famished but not yet so famished as to eat flesh flung to him by an orc, the flesh of he dared not guess what creature.
he sat up and looked about. merry was not far away. they were by the banks of a swift narrow river. ahead mountains loomed: a tall peak was catching the first rays of the sun. a dark smudge of forest lay on the lower slopes before them.
there was much shouting and debating among the orcs; a quarrel seemed on the point of breaking out again between the northerners and the isengarders. some were pointing back away south, and some were pointing eastward.
'very well,' said uglúk. 'leave them to me then! no killing, as i've told you before; but if you want to throw away what we've come all the way to get, throw it away! i'll look after it. let the fighting uruk-hai do the work, as usual. if you're afraid of the whiteskins, run! run! there's the forest,' he shouted, pointing ahead.

'get to it! it's your best hope. off you go! and quick, before i knock a few more heads off, to put some sense into the others.'
there was some cursing and scuffling, and then most of the northerners broke away and dashed off, over a hundred of them, running wildly along the river towards the mountains. the hobbits were left with the isengarders: a grim dark band, four score at least of large, swart, slant-eyed orcs with great bows and short broad-bladed swords. a few of the larger and bolder northerners remained with them.
'now we'll deal with grishnákh,' said uglúk; but some even of his own followers were looking uneasily southwards.
'i know,' growled uglúk. 'the cursed horse-boys have got wind of us. but that's all your fault, snaga. you and the other scouts ought to have your ears cut off. but we are the fighters. we'll feast on horseflesh yet, or something better.'
at that moment pippin saw why som

e of the troop had been pointing eastward. from that direction there now came hoarse cries, and there was grishnákh again, and at his back a couple of score of others like him: long-armed crook-legged orcs. they had a red eye painted on their shields. uglúk stepped forward to meet them. 'so you've come back?' he said. 'thought better of it, eh?'
'i've returned to see that orders are carried out and the prisoners safe,' answered grishnákh.
'indeed!' said uglúk. 'waste of effort. i'll see that orders are carried out in my command. and what else did you come back for? you went in a hurry. did you leave anything behind?'
'i left a fool,' snarled grishnákh. 'but there were some stout fellows with

ther! the other swine are legging it to the forest. you'd better follow. you wouldn't get back to the great river alive. right off the mark! now! i'll be on your heels.'
the isengarders seized merry and pippin again and slung them on their backs. then the troop started off. hour after hour they ran, pausing now and again only to sling the hobbits to fresh carriers. either because they were quicker and hardier, or because of some plan of grishnákh's, the isengarders gradually passed through the orcs of mordor, and grishnákh's folk closed in behind. soon they were gaining also on the northerners ahead. the forest began to draw nearer.
pippin was bruised and torn, his aching head was grated by the filthy jowl and hairy ear of the orc that held him. immediately in front were bowed backs, and tough thick legs going up and down, up and down, unresting, as if they were made of wire and horn, beating out the nightmare seconds of an endless time.
in the afternoon uglúk's troop overtook the north

erners. they were flagging in the rays of the bright sun, winter sun shining in a pale cool sky though it was; their heads were down and their tongues lolling out.
'maggots!' jeered the isengarders. 'you're cooked. the whiteskins will catch you and eat you. they're coming!'
a cry from grishnákh showed that this was not mere jest. horsemen, riding very swiftly, had indeed been sighted: still far behind, but gaining on the orcs, gaining on them like a tide over the flats on folk straying in a quicksand.
the isengarders began to run with a redoubled pace that astonished pippin, a terrific spurt it seemed for the end of a race. then he saw that the sun was sinking, falling behind the misty mountains; shadows reached over the land. the soldiers of mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. the forest was dark and close. already they had passed a few outlying trees. the land was beginning to slope upwards.

ever more steeply; but the orcs did not halt. both uglúk and grishnákh shouted, spurring them on to a last effort.
'they will make it yet. they will escape,' thought pippin. and then he managed to twist his neck. so as to glance back with one eye over his shoulder. he saw that riders away eastward were already level with the orcs, galloping over the plain. the sunset gilded their spears and helmets, and glinted in their pale flowing hair. they were hemming the orcs in, preventing them from scattering, and driving them along the line of the river.
he wondered very much what kind of folk they were. he wished now that he had learned more in rivendell, and looked more at maps and things; but in those days the plans for the journey seemed to be in more competent hands, and he had never reckoned with being cut off from gandalf, or from strider, and even from frodo. all that he could remember about rohan was that gandalf's horse, shadowfax, had come from that la

nd. that sounded hopeful, as far as it went.
'but how will they know that we are not orcs?' he thought. 'i don't suppose they've ever heard of hobbits down here. i suppose i ought to be glad that the beastly orcs look like being destroyed, but i would rather be saved myself.' the chances were that he and merry would be killed together with their captors, before ever the men of rohan were aware of them.
a few of the riders appeared to be bowmen, skilled at shooting from a running horse. riding swiftly into range they shot arrows at the orcs that straggled behind, and several of them fell; then the riders wheeled away out of the range of the answering bows of their enemies, who shot wildly, not daring to

halt. this happened many times, and on one occasion arrows fell among the isengarders. one of them, just in front of pippin, stumbled and did not get up again.
night came down without the riders closing in for battle. many orcs had fallen, but fully two hundred remained. in the early darkness the orcs came to a hillock. the eaves of the forest were very near, probably no more than three furlongs away, but they could go no further. the horsemen had encircled them. a small band disobeyed uglúk's command, and ran on towards the forest: only three returned.
'well, here we are,' sneered grishnákh. 'fine leadership! i hope the great uglúk will lead us out again.'
'put those halflings down!' ordered uglúk, taking no notice of grishnákh. 'you, lugdush, get two others and stand guard over them!

they're not to be killed, unless the filthy whiteskins break through. understand? as long as i'm alive, i want 'em. but they're not to cry out, and they're not to be rescued. bind their legs!'
the last part of the order was carried out mercilessly. but pippin found that for the first time he was close to merry. the orcs were making a great deal of noise, shouting and clashing their weapons, and the hobbits managed to whisper together for a while.
'i don't think much of this,' said merry. 'i feel nearly done in. don't think i could crawl away far, even if i was free.'
'lembas!' whispered pippin. 'lembas: i've got some. have you? i don't think they've taken anything but our swords.'
'yes, i had a packet in my pocket,' answered merry, 'but it must be battered to crumbs. anyway i can't put my mouth in my pocket!'

 
 ___________________________
 
'you won't have to. i've-'; but just then a savage kick warned pippin that the noise had died down, and the guards were watchful.
the night was cold and still. all round the knoll on which the orcs were gathered little watch-fires sprang up, golden-red in the darkness, a complete ring of them. they were within a long bowshot. but the riders did not show themselves against the light, and the orcs wasted many arrows shooting at the fires, until uglúk stopped them. the riders made no sound. later in the night when the moon came out of the mist, then occasionally they could be seen, shadowy shapes that glinted now and again in the white light, as they moved in ceaseless patrol.
'they'll wait for the sun, curse them!' growled one of the guards. 'why don't we get together and charge through? what's old uglúk think he's doing, i should like to know?'
'i daresay you would,' snarled uglúk st

horse-boys to mop up our lot on the flat.
'there's only one thing those maggots can do: they can see like gimlets in the dark. but these whiteskins have better night-eyes than most men, from all i've heard; and don't forget their horses! they can see the night-breeze, or so it's said. still there's one thing the fine fellows don't know: mauhúr and his lads are in the forest, and they should turn up any time now.'
uglúk's words were enough, apparently, to satisfy the isengarders; but the other orcs were both dispirited and rebellious. they posted a few watchers, but most of them lay on the ground, resting in the pleasant darkness. it did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward into thick cloud, and pippin could not see anything a few feet away. the fires brought no light to the hillock. the riders were not, however, content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. a sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. it seemed th

at some of the men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several orcs, and then had faded away again. uglúk dashed off to stop a stampede.
pippin and merry sat up. their guards, isengarders, had gone with uglúk. but if the hobbits had any thought of escape, it was soon dashed. a long hairy arm took each of them by the neck and drew them close together. dimly they were aware of grishnákh's great head and hideous face between them; his foul breath was on their cheeks. he began to paw them and feel them. pippin shuddered as hard cold fingers groped down his back.

ad left them. another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's aid. whether because of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to move.
at last merry stirred and whispered softly: 'so far so good: but how are we to avoid being spitted?'
the answer came almost immediately. the cries of grishnákh had roused the orcs. from the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered: uglúk was probably knocking off a few more heads. then suddenly the answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. mauhúr had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers. there was the sound of galloping horses. the riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, riski

ling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. then they looked back.
the sounds had died away. evidently mauhúr and his 'lads' had been killed or driven off. the riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil. it would not last very much longer. already the night was old. in the east, which had remained unclouded, the sky was beginning to grow pale.
'we must get under cover,' said pippin, 'or we shall be seen. it will not be any comfort to us, if these riders discover that we are not orcs after we are dead.' he got up and stamped his feet. 'those cords have cut me like wires; but my feet are getting warm again. i could stagger on now. what about you, merry?'
merry got up. 'yes,' he said, 'i can manage it. lembas does put heart into you! a more wholesome sort of feeling, too, than the heat of that orc-draught. i wonder what it was made of. better not to know, i expect. let's get a drink of water to wash away the thought of it!'
'not here, the banks are too steep,' said pippin. 'f

er the great river, and the brown lands, leagues upon grey leagues away, the dawn came, red as flame. loud rang the hunting-horns to greet it. the riders of rohan sprang suddenly to life. horn answered horn again.
merry and pippin heard, clear in the cold air, the neighing of war-horses, and the sudden singing of many men. the sun's limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. then with a great cry the riders charged from the east; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. the orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. the hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged again. most of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. but one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest. straight up the slope they charged towards the watchers. now they were drawing near, and it seemed ce

wn down three riders that barred their way.
'we have watched too long,' said merry. 'there's uglúk! i don't want to meet him again.' the hobbits turned and fled deep into the shadows of the wood.
so it was that they did not sec the last stand, when uglúk was overtaken and brought to bay at the very edge of fangorn. there he was slain at last by éomer, the third marshal of the mark, who dismounted and fought him sword to sword. and over the wide fields the keen-eyed riders hunted down the few orcs that had escaped and still had strength to fly.
then when they had laid their fallen comrades in a mound and had sung their praises, the riders made a great fire and scattered the ashes of their enemies. so ended the raid, and no news of it came ever back either to mordor or to isengard; but the smoke of the burning rose high to heaven and was seen by many watchful eyes.

 of the running stream, westward and up towards the slopes of the mountains, deeper and deeper into fangorn. slowly their fear of the orcs died away, and their pace slackened. a queer stifling feeling came over them, as if the air were too thin or too scanty for breathing.
at last merry halted. 'we can't go on like this,' he panted. 'i want some air.'
'let's have a drink at any rate,' said pippin. 'i'm parched.' he clambered on to a great tree-root that wound down into the stream, and stooping drew up some water in his cupped hands. it was clear and cold, and he took many draughts. merry followed him. the water refreshed them and

'hrum, hoom,' murmured the voice, a deep voice like a very deep woodwind instrument. 'very odd indeed! do not be hasty, that is my motto. but if i had seen you, before i heard your voices - i liked them: nice little voices; they reminded me of something i cannot remember - if i had seen you before i heard you, i should have just trodden on you, taking you for little orcs, and found out my mistake afterwards. very odd you are, indeed. root and twig, very odd!'
pippin, though still amazed, no longer felt afraid. under those eyes he felt a curious suspense, but not fear. 'please.' he said, 'who are you? and what are you?'
a queer look came into the old eyes, a kind of wariness; the deep wells were covered over. 'hrum, now,' answered the voice; 'well, i am an ent, or that's what they call me. yes, ent is the word. the ent, i am, you might say, in your manner of spe

'there is quite a lot going on,' said merry: 'and even if we tried to be quick, it would take a long time to tell. but you told us not to be hasty. ought we to tell you anything so soon? would you think it rude, if we asked what you are going to do with us, and which side you are on? and did you know gandalf?'

treebeard was however especially interested in everything that concerned gandalf; and most interested of all in saruman's doings. the hobbits regretted very much that they knew so little about them: only a rather vague report by sam of what gandalf had told the council. but they were clear at any rate that uglúk and his troop came from isengard, and spoke of saruman as their master.
'hm, hoom!' said treebeard, when at last their story had wound and wandered down to the battle of the orcs and the riders of rohan. 'well, well! that is a bundle of news and no mistake. you have not told me all, no indeed, not by a long way. but i do not doubt that you are doing as gandalf would wish. there is something very big going on, that i can see, and what it is maybe i shall learn in good time, or in bad time. by root and twig, but it is a strange business: up sprout a little folk that are not in the old lists, and behold the nine forgotten riders reappear to hunt them, and gandalf takes the

treebeard was immediately aware of him. 'hm, ha, hey, my pippin!' he said, and the other ents all stopped their chant. 'you are a hasty folk, i was forgetting; and anyway it is wearisome listening to a speech you do not understand. you may get down now. i have told your names to the entmoot, and they have seen you, and they have agreed that you are not orcs, and that a new line shall be put in the old lists. we have got no further yet, but that is quick work for an entmoot. you and merry can stroll about in the dingle, if you like. there is a well of good water, if you need refreshing, away yonder in the north bank. there are still some words to speak before the moot really begins. i will come and see you again, and tell you how things are going.'

'there were rowan-trees in my home,' said bregalad, softly and sadly, 'rowan-trees that took root when i was an enting, many many years ago in the quiet of the world. the oldest were planted by the ents to try and please the entwives; but they looked at them and smiled and said that they knew where whiter blossom and richer fruit were growing. yet there are no trees of all that race, the people of the rose, that are so beautiful to me. and these trees grew and grew, till the shadow of each was

'ho, hm, well, we could, you know! you do not know, perhaps, how strong we are. maybe you have heard of trolls? they are mighty strong. but trolls are only counterfeits, made by the enemy in the great darkness, in mockery of ents, as orcs were of elves. we are stronger than trolls. we are made of the bones of the earth. we can split stone like the roots of trees, only quicker, far quicker, if our minds are roused! if we are not hewn down, or destroyed by fire or blast of sorcery, we could split isengard into splinters and crack its walls into rubble.'

'it was an orc-weapon,' he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.
'well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!' exclaimed legolas. 'a bound prisoner escapes both from the orcs and from the surrounding horsemen. he then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his bonds with an orc-knife. but how and why? for if his legs were tied, how did he walk? and if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? and if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! that at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. after that, i suppose, he turned his arms into wings an

'and how do you suppose that either of our friends came to have a hand free?' asked gimli.

'nor do i know why an orc was carrying them away. not to help them to escape, we may be sure. nay, rather i think that i now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when boromir had fallen were the orcs content with the capture of merry and pippin? they did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards isengard. did they suppose they had captured the ring-bearer and his faithful comrade? i think not. their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to orcs, even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of the ring: they are not trusty servants. but i think the orcs had been commanded to capture hobbits, alive, a

there in the hornburg at helm's gate erkenbrand, master of westfold on the borders of the mark, now dwelt. as the days darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong.
the riders were still in the low valley before the mouth of the coomb, when cries and hornblasts were heard from their scouts that went in front. out of the darkness arrows whistled. swiftly a scout rode back and reported that wolf-riders were abroad in the valley, and that a host of orcs and wild men were hurrying southward from the fords of isen and seemed to be making for helm's deep.
'we have found many of our folk lying slain as they fled thither,' said the scout. 'and we have met scattered companies, going this way and that, leaderless. what has become of erkenbrand none seem to know. it is likely that he will be overtaken ere he can reach helm's gate, if he has not already perished.'
'has aught been seen of gandalf?' asked théoden.

'it will go ill with wormtongue, if gandalf comes upon him said théoden. 'nonetheless i miss now both my counsellors, the old and the new. but in this need we have no better choice than to go on, as gandalf said, to helm's gate, whether erkenbrand be there or no. is it known how great is the host that comes from the north?'
'it is very great,' said the scout. 'he that flies counts every foeman twice, yet i have spoken to stouthearted men, and i do not doubt that the main strength of the enem

and secret ways lead thence up on to the hills.
'trust not to secret ways,' said the king. 'saruman has long spied out this land. still in that place our defence may last long. let us go!'
aragorn and legolas went now with éomer in the van. on through the dark night they rode, ever slower as the darkness deepened and their way climbed southward, higher and higher into the dim folds about the mountains' feet. they found few of the enemy before them. here and there they came upon roving bands of orcs; but they fled ere the riders could take or slay them.
'it will not be long i fear,' said éomer, 'ere the coming of the king's host will be known to the leader of our enemies, saruman or whatever captain he has sent forth.'
the rumour of war grew behind them. now they could hear, borne over the dark, the sound of harsh singing. they had climbed far up into the deeping-coomb when they looked back. then they saw torches countless points of fiery light upon the black fields behind, scattered like

now. their torches could be seen winding up the coomb in many lines.
suddenly from the dike yells and screams, and the fierce battle-cries of men broke out. flaming brands appeared over the brink and clustered thickly at the breach. then they scattered and vanished. men came galloping back over the field and up the ramp to the gate of the hornburg. the rearguard of the westfolders had been driven in.
'the enemy is at hand!' they said. 'we loosed every arrow that we had, and filled the dike with orcs. but it will not halt them long. already they are scaling the bank at many points, thick as marching ants. but we have taught them not to carry torches.'
it was now past midnight. the sky was utterly dark, and the stillness of the heavy air foreboded storm. suddenly the clouds were seared by a blinding flash. branched lightning smote down upon the eastward hills. for a staring moment the watchers on the walls saw all the space between them and the dike lit with white light: it was boiling and c

arrows thick as the rain came whistling over the battlements, and fell clinking and glancing on the stones. some found a mark. the assault on helm's deep had begun, but no sound or challenge was heard within; no answering arrows came.
the assailing hosts halted, foiled by the silent menace of rock and wall. ever and again the lightning tore aside the darkness. then the orcs screamed, waving spear and sword, and shooting a cloud of arrows at any that stood revealed upon the battlements; and the men of the mark amazed looked out, as it seemed to them, upon a great field of dark corn, tossed by a tempest of war, and every ear glinted with barbed light.
brazen trumpets sounded. the enemy surged forward, some against the deeping wall, other towards the causeway and the ramp that led up to the hornburg-gates. there the hugest orcs were mustered, and the wild men of the

outh. a keen wind was blowing from the north again. the clouds were torn and drifting, and stars peeped out; and above the hills of the coomb-side the westering moon rode, glimmering yellow in the storm-wrack.
'we did not come too soon,' said aragorn, looking at the gates. their great hinges and iron bars were wrenched and bent; many of their timbers were cracked.
'yet we cannot stay here beyond the walls to defend them,' said éomer. 'look!' he pointed to the causeway. already a great press of orcs and men were gathering again beyond the stream. arrows whined, and skipped on the stones about them. 'come! we must get back and see what we can do to pile stone and beam across the gates within. come now!'
they turned and ran. at that moment some dozen orcs that had lain motionless among the slain leaped to their feet, and came silently and swiftly behind. two flung themselves to the ground at éomer's heels, tripped him, and in a moment they were on top of him. but a small dark figure that no

ne had observed sprang out of the shadows and gave a hoarse shout: baruk khazâd! khazâd ai-mênu! an axe swung and swept back. two orcs fell headless. the rest fled.
éomer struggled to his feet, even as aragorn ran back to his aid.
the postern was closed again, the iron door was barred and piled inside with stones. when all were safe within, éomer turned: 'i thank you, gimli son of glóin!' he said. 'i did not know that you were with us in the sortie. but oft the unbidden guest proves the best company. how came you there?'
'i followed you to shake off sleep,' said gimli; 'but i looked on the hillmen and they seemed over large

the sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. but the light brought little hope to the riders of the mark. the enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. the sortie upon the rock gained only a brief respite. the assault on the gates was redoubled. against the deeping wall the hosts of isengard roared like a sea. orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end. ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them back. hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and orcs sprang up them like apes in the dark forests of the south. before the wall's foot the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on.
the men of rohan grew weary.

 all their arrows were spent, and every shaft was shot; their swords were notched, and their shields were riven. three times aragorn and éomer rallied them, and three times andúril flamed in a desperate charge that drove the enemy from the wall.
then a clamour arose in the deep behind. orcs had crept like rats through the culvert through which the stream flowed out. there they had gathered in the shadow of the cliffs, until the assault above was hottest and nearly all the men of the defence had rushed to the wall's top. then they sprang out. already some had passed into the jaws of the deep and were among the horses, fighting with the guards.
down from the wall leapt gimli with a fierce cry that echoed in the cliffs. 'khazâd! khazâd!' he soon had work enough.
'ai-oi!' he shouted

their onset was fierce and sudden, and the orcs gave way before them. ere long they were hemmed in in the narrows of the gorge, and all were slain or driven shrieking into the chasm of the deep to fall before the guardians of the hidden caves.
'twenty-one!' cried gimli. he hewed a two-handed stroke and laid the last orc before his feet. 'now my count passes master legolas again.'

aragorn looked at the pale stars, and at the moon, now sloping behind the western hills that enclosed the valley. 'this is a night as long as years,' he said. 'how long will the day tarry?'
'dawn is not far off,' said gamling, who had now climbed up beside him. 'but dawn will not help us, i fear.'
'yet dawn is ever the hope of men,' said aragorn.
'but these creatures of isengard, these half-orcs and goblin-men that the foul craft of saruman has bred, they will not quail at the sun,' said gamling. 'and neither will the wild men of the hills. do you not hear their voices?'
'i hear them,' said éomer; 'but they are only the scream of birds and the bellowing of beasts to my ears.'
'yet there are many that cry in the dunland tongue,' said gamling. 'i know that tongue. it is an ancient speech of men, and once was spoken in many western valleys of the mark. hark! they hate us, and they are gl

 while held back the enemy, as one by one all who could gain the stair passed up towards the gate. behind on the upper steps knelt legolas. his bow was bent, but one gleaned arrow was all that he had left, and he peered out now, ready to shoot the first orc that should dare to approach the stair.
'all who can have now got safe within, aragorn,' he called. 'come back!'
aragorn turned and sped up the stair; but as he ran he stumbled in his weariness. at once his enemies leapt forward. up came the orcs, yelling, with their long arms stretched out to seize him. the foremost fell with legolas' last arrow in his throat. but the rest sprang over him. then a great boulder, cast from the outer wall above, crashed down upon the stair, and hurled them back into the deep. aragorn gained the door, and swiftly it clanged to behind him.
'things go ill, my friends,' he said, wiping the sweat from his brow with his arm.
'ill enough,' said legolas, 'but not yet hopeless, while we have you with us. where is

'is éomer here?'
'no, lord. but many of your men retreated into the deep; and some say that éomer was amongst them. in the narrows they may hold back the enemy and come within the caves. what hope they may have then i do not know.'
'more than we. good provision, it is said. and the air is wholesome there because of the outlets through fissures in the rock far above. none can force an entrance against determined men. they may hold out long.'
'but the orcs have brought a devilry from orthanc,' said aragorn. 'they have a blasting fire, and with it they took the wall. if they cannot come in the caves, they may seal up those that are inside. but now we must turn all our thoughts to our own defence.'
'i fret in this prison,' said théoden. 'if i could have set a spear in rest, riding before my men upon the field, maybe i could have felt again the joy of battle, and so ended. but i serve little purpose here.'

'i will ride with you,' said aragorn.
taking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. legolas went with him. blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones. grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. again and again the orcs gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them down.
at last aragorn stood above the great gates, heedless of the darts of the enemy. as he looked forth he saw the eastern sky grow pale. then he raised his empty hand, palm outward in token of parley.
the orcs yelled and jeered. 'come down! come down!' they cried. 'if you wish to speak to us, come down! bring out your king! we are the fighting uruk-hai. we will fetch him from his hole, if he does not come. bring out your

'i have still this to say,' answered aragorn. 'no enemy has yet taken the hornburg. depart, or not one of you will be spared. not one will be left alive to take back tidings to the north. you do not know your peril.'
so great a power and royalty was revealed in aragorn, as he stood there alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and some looked up doubtfully at the sky. but the orcs laughed with loud voices; and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as aragorn leaped down.
there was a roar and a blast of fire. the archway of the gate above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust. the barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. aragorn ran to the king's tower.
but even as the gate fell, and the orcs about it yelled, preparing to charge, a murmur arose behind them. like a wind in the distance, and it grew to a clamour of man

y voices crying strange news in the dawn. the orcs upon the rock, hearing the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. and then, sudden and terrible, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of helm rang out.
all that heard that sound trembled. many of the orcs cast themselves on their faces and covered their ears with their claws. back from the deep the echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood. but on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes did not die. ever the horn-blasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free.
'helm! helm!' the riders shouted. 'helm is arisen and comes back to war. helm for théoden king!'

the hosts of isengard roared, swaying this way and that, turning from fear to fear. again the horn sounded from the tower. down through the breach of the dike charged the king's company. down from the hills leaped erkenbrand, lord of westfold. down leaped shadowfax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. the white rider was upon them, and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness. the wild men fell on their faces before him. the orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever came again.

chapter 8

the road to isengard

so it was that in the light of a fair morning king théoden and gandalf the white rider met again upon the green grass beside the deeping-stream. there was also aragorn son of arathorn, and legolas the elf, and erkenbrand of westfold, and the lords o

 stay behind.
'it was only a feeble blow and the cap turned it;' he said. 'it would take more than such an orc-scratch to keep me back.'
'i will tend it, while you rest,' said aragorn.
the king now returned to the hornburg, and slept, such a sleep of quiet as he had not known for many years, and the remainder of his chosen company rested also. but the others, all that were not hurt or wounded, began a great labour; for many had fallen in the battle and lay dead upon the field or in the deep.
no orcs remained alive; their bodies were uncounted. but a great many of the hillmen had given themselves up; and they were afraid, and cried for mercy.
the men of the mark took their weapons from them, and set them to work.
'help now to repair the evil in which you have joined,' said erkenbrand; 'and afterwards you shall take an oath never again to pass the fords of isen in arms, nor to march with the enemies of men; and then you shall go free back to your land. for you have been deluded by saruman. m

 would your wages have been.'
the men of dunland were amazed, for saruman had told them that the men of rohan were cruel and burned their captives alive.
in the midst of the field before the hornburg two mounds were raised, and beneath them were laid all the riders of the mark who fell in the defence, those of the east dales upon one side, and those of westfold upon the other. in a_ grave alone under the shadow of the hornburg lay háma, captain of the king's guard. he fell before the gate.
the orcs were piled in great heaps, away from the mounds of men, not far from the eaves of the forest. and the people were troubled in their minds; for the heaps of carrion were too great for burial or for burning. they had little wood for firing, and none would have dared to take an axe to the strange trees, even if gandalf had not warned them to hurt neither bark nor bough at their great peril.
'let the orcs lie,' said gandalf. 'the morning may bring new counsel.'

mpenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. no orc or other living creature could be seen.
legolas and gimli were now riding together upon one horse; and they kept close beside gandalf, for gimli was afraid of the wood.
'it is hot in here,' said legolas to gandalf. 'i feel a great wrath about me. do you not feel the air throb in your ears?'
'yes,' said gandalf.
'what has become of the miserable orcs?' said legolas.
'that, i think, no one will ever know,' said gandalf.
they rode in silence for a while; but legolas was ever glancing from side to side, and would often have halted to listen to the sounds of the wood, if gimli had allowed it.
'these are the strangest trees that ever i saw,' he said; 'and i have seen many an oak grow from acorn to ruinous age. i wish that there were leisure now to walk among them: they have voices, and in time i might come to understand their thought.'
'no, no!'

 said gimli. 'let us leave them! i guess their thought already: hatred of all that go on two legs; and their speech is of crushing and strangling.'
'not of all that go on two legs,' said legolas. 'there i think you are wrong. it is orcs that they hate. for they do not belong here and know little of elves and men. far away are the valleys where they sprang. from the deep dales of fangorn, gimli, that is whence they come, i guess.'
'then that is the most perilous wood in middle-earth,' said gimli. 'i should be grateful for the part they have played, but i do not love them. you may think them wonderful, but i have seen a greater wonder in this land, more beautiful than any grove or glade that ever grew: my heart is still full of

'this is become a dreary place,' said éomer. 'what sickness has befallen the river? many fair things saruman has destroyed: has he devoured the springs of isen too?' 'so it would seem,' said gandalf.
'alas!' said théoden. 'must we pass this way, where the carrion-beasts devour so many good riders of the mark?'
'this is our way,' said gandalf. 'grievous is the fall of your men; but you shall see that at least the wolves of the mountains do not devour them. it is with their friends, the orcs, that they hold their feast: such indeed is the friendship of their kind. come!'
they rode down to the river, and as they came the wolves ceased their howling and slunk away. fear fell on them seeing gandalf in the moon, and shadowfax his horse shining like silver. the riders passed over to the islet, and glittering eyes watched them wanly from the shadows of the banks.
'look!' said gandalf. 'friends have laboured here.'
and they saw that in the midst of the eyot a mound was piled, ringed with

of shadow. voices they heard, whisperings and groanings and an endless rustling sigh; the earth shook under them. long it seemed to them that they sat and were afraid; but at last the darkness and the rumour passed, and vanished between the mountain's arms.
away south upon the hornburg, in the middle night men heard a great noise, as a wind in the valley, and the ground trembled; and all were afraid and no one ventured to go forth. but in the morning they went out and were amazed; for the slain orcs were gone, and the trees also. far down into the valley of the deep the grass was crushed and trampled brown, as if giant herdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there; but a mile below the dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled into a hill. men believed that the orcs whom they had slain were buried there; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none could say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. the death down it was afterward

s called, and no grass would grow there. but the strange trees were never seen in deeping-coomb again; they had returned at night, and had gone far away to the dark dales of fangorn. thus they were revenged upon the orcs.
the king and his company slept no more that night; but they saw and heard no other strange thing, save one: the voice of the river beside them suddenly awoke. there was a rush of water hurrying down among the stones; and when it had passed, the isen flowed and bubbled in its bed again, as it had ever done.
at dawn they made ready to go on. the light came grey and pale, and they did not see the rising of the sun. the air above was heavy with fog, and a reek lay on the land about them. they went

'then you shall have it,' said pippin. 'will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of saruman's guard-house--over there under the arch? we had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road.'
'less than an eye!' said gimli. 'but i will not go into any orc-house nor touch orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled.'
'we wouldn't ask you to,' said merry. 'we have had enough of orcs ourselves to last a life-time. but there were many other folk in isengard. saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his orcs. he had men to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, i suppose. anyway they were favoured and got good provisions.'
'and pipe-weed?' asked gimli.
'no, i don't think so,' merry laughed. 'but that is another story, which can wait until after lunch.'

'indeed yes,' said gimli. 'the score is much reduced.'
the three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, unabashed, set to a second time. 'we must keep our guests company,' they said.
'you are full of courtesy this morning,' laughed legolas. 'but maybe. if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again.'
'maybe; and why not?' said pippin. 'we had foul fare with the orcs, and little enough for days before that. it seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content.'
'it does not seem to have done you any harm,' said aragorn. 'indeed you look in the bloom of health.'
'aye, you do indeed,' said gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. 'why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and i would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. this treebeard at any rate has not starved you.'

'here are some treasures that you let fall,' said aragorn. 'you will be glad to have them back.' he loosened his belt from under his cloak and took from it the two sheathed knives.
'well!' said merry. 'i never expected to see those again! i marked a few orcs with mine; but uglúk took them from us. how he glared! at first i thought he was going to stab me, but he threw the things away as if they burned him.'
'and here also is your brooch, pippin,' said aragorn. 'i have kept it safe, for it is a very precious thing.'
'i know,' said pippin. 'it was a wrench to let it go; but what else could i do?'
'nothing else,' answered aragorn. 'one who cannot cast away a treasure at need is in fetters. you did rightly.'

'and set us a pretty riddle,' said legolas. 'i wondered if you had grown wings!'
'unfortunately not,' said pippin. 'but you did not know about grishnákh.' he shuddered and said no more, leaving merry to tell of those last horrible moments: the pawing hands, the hot breath, and the dreadful strength of grishnákh's hairy arms.
'all this about the orcs of barad-dûr, lugbúrz as they call it, makes me uneasy,' said aragorn. 'the dark lord already knew too much and his servants also; and grishnákh evidently sent some message across the river after the quarrel. the red eye will be looking towards isengard. but saruman at any rate is in a cleft stick of his own cutting.'
'yes, whichever side wins, his outlook is poor,' said merry. 'things began to go all wrong for him from the moment his orcs set foot in rohan.'

'then all at once there was a tremendous stir. trumpets blared and the walls of isengard echoed. we thought that we had been discovered, and that battle was going to begin. but nothing of the sort. all saruman's people were marching away. i don't know much about this war, or about the horsemen of rohan, but saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one final blow. he emptied isengard. i saw the enemy go: endless lines of marching orcs; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. and there were battalions of men, too. many of them carried torches, and in the flare i could see their faces. most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil-looking. but there were some others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed. do you know, they reminded me at once of that southerner at bree: only he was not so obviously orc-like as most of these were.'

'i thought of him too,' said aragorn. 'we had many of these half-orcs to deal with at helm's deep. it seems plain now that that southerner was a spy of saruman's; but whether he was working with the black riders, or for saruman alone, i do not know. it is difficult with these evil folk to know when they are in league, and when they are cheating one another.'

'but, though i could not see what was happening in the dark, i believe that huorns began to move south, as soon as the gates were shut again. their business was with orcs i think. they were far down the valley in the morning; or any rate there was a shadow there that one couldn't see through.
'as soon as saruman had sent off all his army, our turn came. treebeard put us down, and went up to the gates, and began hammering on the doors, and calling for saruman. there was no answer, except arrows and stones from the walls. but arrows are no use against ents. they hurt them, of course, and infuriate them: like stinging flies. but an ent can be stuck as full of orc-a

'"hoom! gandalf!" said treebeard. "i am glad you have come. wood and water, stock and stone, i can master; but there is a wizard to manage here."
'"treebeard," said gandalf. "i need your help. you have done much, but i need more. i have about ten thousand orcs to manage."
'then those two went off and had a council together in some corner. it must have seemed very hasty to treebeard, for gandalf was in a tremendous hurry, and was already talking at a great pace, before they passed out of hearing. they were only away a matter of minutes, perhaps a quarter of an hour. then gandalf came back to us, and he seemed relieved, almost merry. he did say he was glad to see us, then.

'not he!' said pippin. 'he was probably choking and not laughing any more. by the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. we took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had rather a fright. the lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. we thought we were going to get caught like orcs in a hole; but we found a winding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of the arch. it was a squeeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top. there we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of isengard. the ents kept on pouring in more water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. the fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it must have been a mile h

'oh yes, i forgot about him,' said pippin. 'he did not get here till this morning. we had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when treebeard appeared again. we heard him hooming and calling our names outside.
'"i have just come round to see how you are faring, my lads,' he said; 'and to give you some news. huorns have come back. all's well; aye very well indeed!" he laughed, and slapped his thighs. "no more orcs in isengard, no more axes! and there will be folk coming up from the south before the day is old; some that you may be glad to see."
'he had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road. we rushed out before the gates, and i stood and stared, half expecting to see strider and gandalf come riding up at the head of an army. but out of the mist there rode a man on an old tired horse; and he looked a queer twisted sort of creature himself. there was no one else. when he came. out

'"no one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul orcs," he said, "so i was sent. and i have had a perilous journey, and i am hungry and weary. i fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves."
'i caught the sidelong looks he gave to treebeard, and i said to myself "liar". treebeard looked at him in his long slow way for several minutes, till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. then at last he said: "ha, hm, i was expecting you, master wormtongue." the man started at that name.

'so you heard that?' said gandalf. 'don't let it rankle! be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. he had his eyes on you. if it is any comfort to your pride, i should say that, at the moment, you and pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the orcs perished - it is with those little riddles that the great mind of saruman is troubled. a sneer from him, meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern.'
'thank you!' said merry. 'but it is a greater honour to dangle at your tail, gandalf. for one thing, in that position one has a chance of putting a question a second time. are we riding far tonight?'

`ach! sss!

`so you have been there? ' frodo insisted. `and you're being drawn back there, aren't you?'
`yess. yess. no!

 then he collapsed again. 'gollum, gollum,' he whimpered with his face to the ground. 'don't look at us! go away! go to sleep!'
`he will not go away or go to sleep at your command, sméagol,' said frodo. `but if you really wish to be free of him again. then you must help me. and that i fear means finding us a path towards him. but you need not go all the way, not beyond the gates of his land.'
gollum sat up again and looked at him under his eyelids. 'he's over there,' he cackled. `always there. orcs will take you all the way. easy to find orcs east of the river. don't ask sméagol. poor, poor sméagol, he went away long ago. they took his precious, and he's lost now.'
`perhaps we'll find him again, if you come with us,' said frodo.
'no, no, never! he's lost his precious,' said gollum.

'well, gollum, or whatever it is we're to call you,' he said. 'now for it! the moon's gone. and the night's going. we'd better start.'
'yes, yes,' agreed gollum, skipping about. 'off we go! there's only one way across between the north-end and the south-end. i found it, i did. orcs don't use it, orcs don't know it. orcs don't cross the marshes, they go round for miles and miles. very lucky you came this way. very lucky you found sméagol, yes. follow sméagol!'
he took a few steps away and looked back inquiringly, like a dog inviting them for a walk. 'wait a bit, gollum!' cried sam. `not too far ahead now! i'm going to be at your tail, and i've got the rope handy.'

`here it is!' he cried. 'there is a way down inside, yes. now we follows it - out, out away over there.' he pointed south and east towards the marshes. the reek of them came to their nostrils, heavy and foul even in the cool night air. .
gollum cast up and down along the brink, and at length he called to them. `here! we can get down here. sméagol went this way once: i went this way, hiding from orcs.'
he led the way, and following him the hobbits climbed down into the gloom. it was not difficult, for the rift was at this point only some fifteen feet deep and about a dozen across. there was running water at the bottom: it was in fact the bed of one of the many small rivers that trickled down from the hills to feed the stagnant pools and mires beyond. gollum turned to the right, southward more or less, and splashed along with his feet in the shallow stony stream. he seemed greatly delighted

`day is near,' he whispered, as if day was something that might overhear him and spring on him. `sméagol will stay here: i will stay here, and the yellow face won't see me.'
`we should be glad to see the sun;' said frodo, `but we will stay here: we are too tired to go any further at present.'
`you are not wise to be glad of the yellow face,' said gollum. `it shows you up. nice sensible hobbits stay with sméagol. orcs and nasty things are about. they can see a long way. stay and hide with me! '
the three of them settled down to rest at the foot of the rocky wall of the gully. it was not much more than a tall man's height now, and at its base there were wide flat shelves of dry stone; the water ran in a channel on the other side. frodo and sam sat on one of the flats, resting their backs. gollum paddled and scrabbled in the stream.

'how do we shape our course now, sméagol? ' asked frodo. 'must we cross these evil-smelling fens? '

'but i have seen them too. in the pools when the candles were lit. they lie in all the pools, pale faces, deep deep under the dark water. i saw them: grim faces and evil, and noble faces and sad. many faces proud and fair, and weeds in their silver hair. but all foul, all rotting, all dead. a fell light is in them.' frodo hid his eyes in his hands.

across the mouth of the pass, from cliff to cliff, the dark lord had built a rampart of stone. in it there was a single gate of iron, and upon its battlement sentinels paced unceasingly. beneath the hills on either side the rock was bored into a hundred caves and maggot-holes: there a host of orcs lurked, ready at a signal to issue forth like black ants going to war. none could pass the teeth of mordor and not feel their bite, unless they were summoned by sauron, or knew the secret passwords that would open the morannon, the black gate of his land.

`so that's your advice is it,' said sam, 'that we should go another long march south, to find ourselves in the same fix or a worse one, when we get there, if we ever do? '

'you seem to know a lot about what he's doing and thinking,' said sam. `have you been talking to him lately? or just hobnobbing with orcs? '

'sméagol has talked to orcs, yes of course, before he met master, and to many peoples: he has walked very far. and what he says now many peoples are saying. it's here in the north that the big danger is for him, and for us. he will come out of the black gate one day, one day soon. that is the only way big armies can come. but away down west he is not afraid, and there are the silent watchers.'

here they washed themselves and drank their fill at the in-falling freshet. then they sought for a resting-place, and a hiding-place: for this land, fair-seeming still, was nonetheless now territory of the enemy. they had not come very far from the road, and yet even in so short a space they had seen scars of the old wars, and the newer wounds made by the orcs and other foul servants of the dark lord: a pit of uncovered filth and refuse; trees hewn down wantonly and left to die, with evil runes or the fell sign of the eye cut in rude strokes on their bark.

`let's find a place to lie up in,' he said. 'not lower down. higher up for me.'
a little way back above the lake they found a deep brown bed of last year's fern. beyond it was a thicket of dark-leaved bay-trees climbing up a steep bank that was crowned with old cedars. here they decided to rest and pass the day, which already promised to be bright and warm. a good day for strolling on their way along the groves and glades of ithilien; but though orcs may shun the sunlight. there were too many places here where they could lie hid and watch; and other evil eyes were abroad: sauron had many servants. gollum, in any case, would not move under the yellow. face. soon it would look over the dark ridges of the ephel dúath, and he would faint and cower in the light and heat.

een-feathered arrows. all had swords at their sides, and were clad in green and brown of varied hues, as if the better to walk unseen in the glades of ithilien. green gauntlets covered their hands, and their faces were hooded and masked with green, except for their eyes, which were very keen and bright. at once frodo thought of boromir, for these men were like him in stature and bearing, and in their manner of speech.
`we have not found what we sought,' said one. `but what have we found? '
'not orcs,' said another, releasing the hilt of his sword, which he had seized when he saw the glitter of sting in frodo's hand.
`elves? ' said a third, doubtfully.
`nay! not elves,' said the fourth, the tallest, and as it appeared the chief among them. `elves do not walk in ithilien in these days. and elves are wondrous fair to look upon, or so 'tis said.'
'meaning we're not, i take you,' said sam. `thank you kindly. and when you've finished discussing us, perhaps you'll say who you are, and why you can

 he knew then that they must be dúnedain of the south, men of the line of the lords of westernesse.
after a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in answering. they named themselves mablung and damrod, soldiers of gondor, and they were rangers of ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived in ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers, who crossed the anduin secretly (how or where, they would not say) to harry the orcs and other enemies that roamed between the ephel dúath and the river.
`it is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of anduin,' said mablung, 'and we seldom come so far afield. but we have a new errand on this journey: we come to ambush the men of harad. curse them! '
'aye, curse the southrons! ' said damrod. ` 'tis said that there were dealings of old between gondor and the kingdoms of the harad in the far south; though there was never friendship. in those days our bounds were away south

 his hands on his hips, and a look on his face as if he was addressing a young hobbit who had offered him what he called `sauce' when questioned about visits to the orchard. there was some murmuring, but also some grins on the faces of the men looking on: the sight of their captain sitting on the ground and eye to eye with a young hobbit, legs well apart, bristling with wrath, was one beyond their experience. `see here! ' he said. `what are you driving at? let's come to the point before all the orcs of mordor come down on us! if you think my master murdered this boromir and then ran away, you've got no sense; but say it, and have done! and then let us know what you mean to do about it. but it's a pity that folk as talk about fighting the enemy can't let others do their bit in their own way without interfering. he'd be mighty pleased, if he could see you now. think he'd got a new friend, he would.'

'go back, faramir, valiant captain of gondor, and defend your city while you may, and let me go where my doom takes me.'
`for me there is no comfort in our speech together,' said faramir; `but you surely draw from it more dread than need be. unless the people of lórien themselves came to him, who arrayed boromir as for a funeral? not orcs or servants of the nameless. some of your company, i guess, live still.
`but whatever befell on the north march, you, frodo, i doubt no longer. if hard days have made me any judge of men's words and faces, then i may make a guess at halflings! though,' and now he smiled, `there is something strange about you, frodo, an elvish air, maybe. but more lies upon our words together than i thought at first. i should now take you back to minas tirith to answer there to denethor, and my life will justly

o the shadows of the rocks and trees. soon only mablung and damrod remained.
'now you, frodo and samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said faramir. `you cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. it will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. and you cannot, i think, go far today in any case, for you are weary. and so are we. we are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet, and if they did, we could hold it long even against many. there we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. in the morning i will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.'
there was nothing for frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever.
they set out at once: mablung and damrod

he was at first content to listen, only occasionally venturing to make an exclamation of agreement.
frodo told many tales, yet always he steered the matter away from the quest of the company and from the ring, enlarging rather on the valiant part boromir had played in all their adventures. with the wolves of the wild, in the snows under caradhras, and in the mines of moria where gandalf fell. faramir was most moved by the story of the fight on the bridge.
`it must have irked boromir to run from orcs,' he said, `or even from the fell thing you name, the balrog - even though he was the last to leave.'
`he was the last,' said frodo, 'but aragorn was forced to lead us. he alone knew the way after gandalf's fall. but had there not been us lesser folk to care for, i do not think that either he or boromir would have fled.'
`maybe, it would have been better had boromir fallen there with mithrandir,' said faramir, `and not gone on to the fate that waited above the falls of rauros.'
'maybe. but tell

 to slay him for that reason, and for others. he forbade the elves to do so. i do not know clearly why, and of what i guess i cannot speak openly out here. but this creature is in some way bound up with my errand. until you found us and took us, he was my guide.'
`your guide! ' said faramir. `the matter becomes ever stranger. i would do much for you, frodo, but this i cannot grant: to let this sly wanderer go free at his own will from here, to join you later if it please him, or to be caught by orcs and tell all he knows under threat of pain. he must be slain or taken. slain, if he be not taken very swiftly. but how can this slippery thing of many guises be caught, save by a feathered shaft? '
`let me go down quietly to him,' said frodo. `you may keep your bows bent, and shoot me at least, if i fail. i shall not run away.'
`go then and be swift! ' said faramir. `if he comes off alive, he should be your faithful servant for the rest of his unhappy days. lead frodo down to the bank, anborn,

nd gollum crouched upon the ground near the opening. there the hobbits took what they expected would be their last meal before they went down into the nameless land, maybe the last meal they would ever eat together. some of the food of gondor they ate, and wafers of the waybread of the elves. and they drank a little. but of their water they were sparing and took only enough to moisten their dry mouths.
`i wonder when we'll find water again? ' said sam. 'but i suppose even over there they drink? orcs drink, don't they? '
'yes, they drink,' said frodo. 'but do not let us speak of that. such drink is not for us.'
`then all the more need to fill our bottles,' said sam. `but there isn't any water up here: not a sound or a trickle have i heard. and anyway faramir said we were not to drink any water in morgul.'
'no water flowing out of imlad morgul, were his words,' said frodo. `we are not in that valley now, and if we came on a spring it would be flowing into it and not out of it.'

`it's no good worrying about him now,' said frodo. `we couldn't have got so far, not even within sight of the pass, without him, and so we'll have to put up with his ways. if he's false, he's false.'
'all the same, i'd rather have him under my eye,' said sam. 'all the more so, if he's false. do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or no? and now we see a tower there - and it may be deserted, and it may not. do you think he's gone to fetch them, orcs or whatever they are?'
`no, i don't think so,' answered frodo. 'even if he's up to some wickedness, and i suppose that's not unlikely, i don't think it's that: not to fetch orcs, or any servants of the enemy. why wait till now, and go through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? he could probably have betrayed us to orcs many times since we met him. no, if it's anything, it will be some little private trick of his own-that he thinks is quite secret.'
`well, i suppose

 you're right, mr. frodo,' said sam. 'not that it comforts me mightily. i don't make no mistake: i don't doubt he'd hand me over to orcs as gladly as kiss his hand. but i was forgetting - his precious. no, i suppose the whole time it's been the precious for poor sméagol. that's the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. but how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than i can guess.'
'very likely he can't guess himself,' said frodo. `and i don't think he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. i think he really is in part trying to save the precious from the enemy. as long as he can. for that wo

'yes, yes,' he answered. 'yes, we must go this way now.'
'd'you mean to say you've been through this hole?' said sam. `phew! but perhaps you don't mind bad smells.'
gollum's eyes glinted. `he doesn't know what we minds, does he precious? no, he doesn't. but sméagol can bear things. yes. he's been through. o yes, right through. it's the only way.'
`and what makes the smell, i wonder,' said sam. `it's like - well, i wouldn't like to say. some beastly hole of the orcs, i'll warrant, with a hundred years of their filth in it.'
'well,' said frodo, 'orcs or no, if it's the only way, we must take it.'
drawing a deep breath they passed inside. in a few steps they were in utter and impenetrable dark. not since the lightless passages of moria had frodo or sam known such darkness, and if possible here it was deeper and denser. there, there were airs moving, and echoes, and a sense of space. here the air was still, stagnant, heavy, and sound fell dead. they walked as

 for towers, or rings, or anything devised by mind or hand, who only desired death for all others, mind and body, and for herself a glut of life. alone, swollen till the mountains could no longer hold her up and the darkness could not contain her.
but that desire was yet far away, and long now had she been hungry, lurking in her den, while the power of sauron grew, and light and living things forsook his borders; and the city in the valley was dead, and no elf or man came near, only the unhappy orcs. poor food and wary. but she must eat, and however busily they delved new winding passages from the pass and from their tower, ever she found some way to snare them. but she lusted for sweeter meat. and gollum had brought it to her.
`we'll see, we'll see,' he said often to himself, when the evil mood was on him, as he walked the dangerous road from emyn muil to morgul vale, 'we'll see. it may well be, o yes, it may well be that when she throws away the bones and the empty garments, we shall fin

so he thought in an inner chamber of his cunning, which he still hoped to hide from her, even when he had come to her again and had bowed low before her while his companions slept.
and as for sauron: he knew where she lurked. it pleased him that she should dwell there hungry but unabated in malice, a more sure watch upon that ancient path into his land than any other that his skill could have devised. and orcs, they were useful slaves, but he had them in plenty. if now and again shelob caught them to stay her appetite, she was welcome: he could spare them. and sometimes as a man may cast a dainty to his cat (his cat he calls her, but she owns him not) sauron would send her prisoners that he had no better uses for: he would have them driven to her hole, and report brought back to him of the play she made.
so they both lived, delighting in their own devices, and feared no assault, nor wrath, nor any en

dread was round him, and enemies before him in the pass, and his master was in a fey mood running heedlessly to meet them. turning his eyes away from the shadow behind and the deep gloom beneath the cliff upon his left, he looked ahead, and he saw two things that increased his dismay. he saw that the sword which frodo still held unsheathed was glittering with blue flame; and he saw that though the sky behind was now dark. still the window in the tower was glowing red.
`orcs! ' he muttered. `we'll never rush it like this. there's orcs about, and worse than orcs.' then returning quickly to his long habit of secrecy, he closed his hand about the precious phial which he still bore. red with his own living blood his hand shone for a moment, and then he thrust the revealing light deep into a pocket near his breast and drew his elven-cloak about him. now he tried to quicken his pace. his master was gaining on him; already he was some twenty strides ahead, flitting on lik

 had fallen in ruin.
'if only i could have my wish, my one wish,' he sighed, `to go back and find him! ' then at last he turned to the road in front and took a few steps: the heaviest and the most reluctant he had ever taken.
only a few steps; and now only a few more and he would be going down and would never see that high place again. and then suddenly he heard cries and voices. he stood still as stone. orc-voices. they were behind him and before him. a noise of tramping feet and harsh shouts: orcs were coming up to the cleft from the far side, from some entry to the tower, perhaps. tramping feet and shouts behind. he wheeled round. he saw small red lights, torches, winking away below there as they issued from the tunnel. at last the hunt was up. the red eye of the tower had not been blind. he was caught.
now the flicker of approaching torches and the clink of steel ahead was very near. in a minute they would reach the top and be on him. he had taken too long in making up his mind, and no

 there in a grey hazy world, alone, like a small black solid rock and the ring, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold. he did not feel invisible at all, but horribly and uniquely visible; and he knew that somewhere an eye was searching for him.
he heard the crack of stone, and the murmur of water far off in morgul vale; and down away under the rock the bubbling misery of shelob, groping, lost in some blind passage; and voices in the dungeons of the tower; and the cries of the orcs as they came out of the tunnel; and deafening, roaring in his ears, the crash of the feet and the rending clamour of the orcs before him. he shrank against the cliff. but they marched up like a phantom company, grey distorted figures in a mist, only dreams of fear with pale flames in their hands. and they passed him by. he cowered, trying to creep away into some cranny and to hide.
he listened. the orcs from the tunnel and the others marching down had sighted one another, and both parties were

 of lying low till all was quiet again; and he listened anxiously. he could not tell how near the voices were, the words seemed almost in his ears.
'hola! gorbag! what are you doing up here? had enough of war already? '
'orders, you lubber. and what are you doing, shagrat? tired of lurking up there? thinking of coming down to fight? '
'orders to you. i'm in command of this pass. so speak civil. what's your report? '
'nothing.'
`hai! hai! yoi!' a yell broke into the exchanges of the leaders. the orcs lower down had suddenly seen something. they began to run. so did the others.
`hai! hola! here's something! lying right in the road. a spy, a spy! ' there was a hoot of snarling horns and a babel of baying voices.
with a dreadful stroke sam was wakened from his cowering mood. they had seen his master. what would they do? he had heard tales of the orcs to make the blood run cold. it could not be borne. he sprang up. he flung the quest and all his decisions away, and fear and doubt with them. he

oon as i draw it, and they'll get me sooner or later. i wonder if any song will ever mention it: how samwise fell in the high pass and made a wall of bodies round his master. no, no song. of course not, for the ring'll be found, and there'll be no more songs. i can't help it. my place is by mr. frodo. they must understand that - elrond and the council, and the great lords and ladies with all their wisdom. their plans have gone wrong. i can't be their ring-bearer. not without mr. frodo.'
but the orcs were out of his dim sight now. he had had no time to consider himself, but now he realized that he was weary, weary almost to exhaustion: his legs would not carry him as he wished. he was too slow. the path seemed miles long. where had they all got to in the mist?
there they were again! a good way ahead still. a cluster of figures round something lying on the ground; a few seemed to be darting this way and that, bent like dogs on a trail. he tried to make a spurt.
'come on, sam! ' he said, `or

in a minute he would draw it, and then-
there was a wild clamour, hooting and laughing, as something was lifted from the ground. 'ya hoi! ya harri hoi! up! up! '
then a voice shouted: `now off! the quick way. back to the undergate! she'll not trouble us tonight by all the signs.' the whole band of orc-figures began to move. four in the middle were carrying a body high on their shoulders. `ya hoi! '
they had taken frodo's body. they were off. he could not catch them up. still he laboured on. the orcs reached the tunnel and were passing in. those with the burden went first, and behind them there was a good deal of struggling and jostling. sam came on. he drew the sword, a flicker of blue in his wavering hand, but they did not see it. even as he came panting up, the last of them vanished into the black hole.
for a moment he stood, gasping, clutching his breast. then he drew his sleeve across his face, wiping away the grime, and sweat, and tears. 'curse the filth! ' he said, and sprang after t

hem into the darkness.
it no longer seemed very dark to him in the tunnel, rather it was as if he had stepped out of a thin mist into a heavier fog. his weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more. he thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch them up. orcs go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well.; for in spite of shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the dead city over the mountains. in what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made, where shelob had taken up her abode in ages past. they did not know: but many byways they had themselves delved about in on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. tonight they did not intend to g

`nearly, you say! ' said gorbag.
`all right,' said shagrat, `but we'll talk of that later: wait till we get to the under-way. there's a place there where we can talk a bit, while the lads go on.'
shortly afterwards sam saw the torches disappear. then there was a rumbling noise, and just as he hurried up, a bump. as far as he could guess the orcs had turned and gone into the very opening which frodo and he had tried and found blocked. it was still blocked.
there seemed to be a great stone in the way, but the orcs had got through somehow, for he could hear their voices on the other side. they were still running along, deeper and deeper into the mountain, back towards the tower. sam felt desperate. they were carrying off his master's body for some foul purpose and he could not follow. he thrust and pushed at the block, and he threw himsel

st the intrusion of shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. with his remaining strength sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel.
the news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of weariness. he could not see anything ahead. for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the two orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again. now they seemed quite close.
`that's what i'm going to do,' said shagrat in angry tones. 'put him right up in the top chamber.'
`what for? ' growled gorbag. `haven't you any lock-ups down below? '
`he's going out of harm's way, i tell you,' answered shagrat. 'see? he's precious. i don't trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you neither, when you're mad for fun. he's going where i want him, and where you won't come, if you don't keep civil. up to t

 great big elvish warrior that's loose!' and with that he raced round the last corner, only to find that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the ring gave him, he had misjudged the distance.
the two orc-figures were still some way ahead. he could see them now, black and squat against a red glare. the passage ran straight at last, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. already the orcs with their burden had passed inside. gorbag and shagrat were drawing near the gate.
sam heard a burst of hoarse singing, blaring of horns and banging of gongs, a hideous clamour. gorbag and shagrat were already on the threshold.
sam yelled and brandished sting, but his little voice was drowned in the tumult. no one heeded him.
the great doors slammed to. boom. the bars of iron fell into place inside. clang. the gate was shut. sam hurled himself against the bolted brazen plates and fell senseles
