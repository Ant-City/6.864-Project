Roderigo	 - 
                A
jealous suitor of Desdemona. Young, rich, and foolish, Roderigo
is convinced that if he gives Iago all of his money, Iago will help
him win Desdemona's hand. Repeatedly frustrated as Othello marries Desdemona
and then takes her to Cyprus, Roderigo is ultimately desperate enough
to agree to help Iago kill Cassio after Iago points out that Cassio
is another potential rival for Desdemona.
