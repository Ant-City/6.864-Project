dr.[CHARACTER] 
dr.[CHARACTER] first appears to be an ideal authority figure
for the young jim. jim entrusts the treasure map to[CHARACTER] because
livesey is a respected, knowledgeable man. as the adventure unfolds,
livesey shows that jim's respect is merited, proving himself competent, clever,
fair, and loyal.[CHARACTER] devises the brilliant plan of stalling
the pirate brigade by sending ben gunn to give spooky imitations
of their dead leader, flint. he also comes up with the ruse of sending the
pirates on the wild-goose chase to find the treasure.[CHARACTER] is not
afraid of action and bravely fires on the pirates at the treasure site.
he is noble in his willingness to provide medical attention to the wounded
pirates, his enemies. he speaks tenderly to them and seems genuinely
to care for their health. more so than the gruff captain smollett
or the naive squire trelawney,[CHARACTER] represents the best of the
civilized world of men.
	despite his credentials and valuable achievements in
the tale, however,[CHARACTER] is simply not charismatic. he does what
is reasonable, practical, and ethical, but never acts impetuously
or spontaneously, as the pirates and jim do.[CHARACTER] thinks up ingenious
plans, but only puts them into practice if they are safe and efficient.
he gives the pirates the treasure map only when he knows it is useless. on
the whole,[CHARACTER] never risks anything, and therefore jim, as we do,
sees him as good but not grand, decent but not inspirational. it is
significant that while jim gives a sentimental farewell to the memory
of silver at the end of his narrative, he omits mention of[CHARACTER], despite
livesey's importance in the adventure. jim does not have an emotional
connection to[CHARACTER], and, by extension, does not have an emotional
connection to the decent, civilized world[CHARACTER] represents. jim
does not fit completely into silver's world, but he does not fit
completely into[CHARACTER]'s steady, practical world either.
