 i have still got to explain things again to those that live a long way off, far from isengard, and those that i could not get round to before the moot, and after that we shall have to decide what to do. however, deciding what to do does not take ents so long as going over all the facts and events that they have to make up their minds about. still, it is no use denying, we shall be here a long time yet: a couple of days very likely. so i have brought you a companion. he has an ent-house nearby. bregalad is his elvish name. he says he has already made up his mind and does not need to remain at the moot. hm, hm, he is the nearest thing among us to a hasty ent. you ought to get on together. good-bye!' treebeard turned and left them.
bregalad stood for some time surveying the hobbits solemnly; and they looked at him, wondering when he would show any signs of 'hastiness'. he was tall, and seemed to be one of the younger ents; he had smooth shining skin on his arms and legs; his lips were ruddy, and

 his hair was grey-green. he could bend and sway like a slender tree in the wind. at last he spoke, and his voice though resonant was higher and clearer than treebeard's.
'ha, hmm, my friends, let us go for a walk!' he said. 'i am bregalad, that is quickbeam in your language. but it is only a nickname, of course. they have called me that ever since i said yes to an elder ent before he had finished his question. also i drink quickly, and go out while some are still wetting their beards. come with me!'
he reached down two shapely arms and gave a long-fingered hand to each of the hobbits. all that day they walked about in the woods with him, singing, and laughing; for quickbeam often laughed. he laughed if the sun came out from behi

-house: nothing more than a mossy stone set upon turves under a green bank. rowan-trees grew in a circle about it, and there was water (as in all ent-houses), a spring bubbling out from the bank. they talked for a while as darkness fell on the forest. not far away the voices of the entmoot could be heard still going on; but now they seemed deeper and less leisurely, and every now and again one great voice would rise in a high and quickening music, while all the others died away. but beside them bregalad spoke gently in their own tongue, almost whispering; and they learned that he belonged to skinbark's people, and the country where they had lived had been ravaged. that seemed to the hobbits quite enough to explain his 'hastiness', at least in the matter of orcs.
'there were rowan-trees in my home,' said bregalad, softly and sadly, 'rowan-trees that took root when i was an enting, many many years ago in the quiet of the world. the oldest were planted by the ents to try and please the entwives;

dead.
o orofarnë, lassemista, carnimírië!
o rowan fair, upon your hair how white the blossom lay!
o rowan mine, i saw you shine upon a summer's day,
your rind so bright, your leaves so light, your voice so cool and soft:
upon your head how golden-red the crown you bore aloft!
o rowan dead, upon your head your hair is dry and grey;
your crown is spilled, your voice is stilled for ever and a day.
o orofarnë, lassemista, carnimírië!
the hobbits fell asleep to the sound of the soft singing of bregalad, that seemed to lament in many tongues the fall of trees that he had loved.
the next day they spent also in his company, but they did not go far from his 'house'. most of the time they sat silent under the shelter of the bank; for the wind was colder, and the clouds closer and greyer; there was little sunshine, and in the distance the voices of the ents at the moot still rose and fell, sometimes loud and strong, sometimes low and sad, sometimes quickening, sometimes slow and solemn as a dirge.

a second night came and still the ents held conclave under hurrying clouds and fitful stars.
the third day broke, bleak and windy. at sunrise the ents' voices rose to a great clamour and then died down again. as the morning wore on the wind fell and the air grew heavy with expectancy. the hobbits could see that bregalad was now listening intently, although to them, down in the dell of his ent-house, the sound of the moot was faint.
the afternoon came, and the sun, going west towards the mountains, sent out long yellow beams between the cracks and fissures of the clouds. suddenly they were aware that everything was very quiet; the whole forest stood in listening silence. of course, the ent-voices had stopped. what did that mean? bregalad was standing up erect and tense, looking back northwards towards derndingl

e.
then with a crash came a great ringing shout: ra-hoom-rah! the trees quivered and bent as if a gust had struck them. there was another pause, and then a marching music began like solemn drums, and above the rolling beats and booms there welled voices singing high and strong.
we come, we come with roll of drum: ta-runda runda runda rom!
the ents were coming: ever nearer and louder rose their song:
we come, we come with horn and drum: ta-rûna rûna rûna rom!
bregalad picked up the hobbits and strode from his house.
before long they saw the marching line approaching: the ents were swinging along with great strides down the slope towards them. treebeard was at their head, and some fifty followers were behind him, two abreast, keeping step with their feet and beating time with their hands upon their flanks. as they drew near the flash and flicker of their eyes could be seen.
'hoom, hom! here we come with a boom, here we come at last!' called treebeard when he

caught sight of bregalad and the hobbits. 'come, join the moot! we are off. we are off to isengard!'
'to isengard!' the ents cried in many voices.
'to isengard!'
to isengard! though isengard be ringed and barred with doors of stone;
though isengard be strong and hard, as cold as stone and bare as bone,
we go, we go, we go to war, to hew the stone and break the door;
for bole and bough are burning now, the furnace roars - we go to war!
to land of gloom with tramp of doom, with roll of drum, we come, we come;
to isengard

 with doom we come!
with doom we come, with doom we come!
so they sang as they marched southwards.
bregalad, his eyes shining, swung into the line beside treebeard. the old ent now took the hobbits back, and set them on his shoulders again, and so they rode proudly at the head of the singing company with beating hearts and heads held high. though they had expected something to happen eventually, they were amazed at the change that had come over the ents. it seemed now as sudden as the bursting of a flood that had long been held back by a dike.
'the ents made up their minds rather quickly, after all,
