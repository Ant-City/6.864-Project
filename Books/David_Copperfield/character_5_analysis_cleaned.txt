[CHARACTER]
uriah serves a foil to david and contrasts david's qualities
of innocence and compassion with his own corruption. though uriah
is raised in a cruel environment similar to david's, uriah's upbringing causes
him to become bitter and vengeful rather than honest and hopeful.
dickens's physical description of uriah marks uriah as a demonic
character. he refers to uriah's movements as snakelike and gives
uriah red hair and red eyes. uriah and david not only have opposing
characteristics but also operate at cross-purposes. for example,
whereas uriah wishes to marry agnes only in order to hurt david,
david's marriages are both motivated by love. the frequent contrast
between uriah's and david's sentiments emphasizes david's kindness
and moral integrity.
while david's character development is a process of increased self-understanding,
uriah grows in his desire to exercise control over himself and other
characters. as uriah gains more power over mr. wickfield, his sense
of entitlement grows and he becomes more and more power-hungry.
the final scenes of the novel, in which uriah praises his jail cell
because it helps him know what he should do, show uriah's need to
exert control even when he is a helpless prisoner. but imprisonment
does not redeem his evil--if anything, it compounds his flaws. to
the end, uriah plots strategies to increase his control. because
he deploys his strategies to selfish purposes that bring harm to
others, he stands out as the novel's greatest villain.
