excuse wisely, you were best.

clown.
wit, and 't be thy will, put me into good fooling! those wits
that think they have thee do very oft prove fools; and i, that am
sure i lack thee, may pass for a wise man: for what says
quinapalus? 'better a witty fool than a foolish wit.'

[enter lady olivia with malvolio.]

god bless thee, lady!

olivia.
take the fool away.

clown.
do you not hear, fellows? take away the lady.

olivia.
go to, you're a dry fool; i'll no more of you: besides, you grow
dishonest.

clown.
two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel will amend; for,
give the dry fool drink, then is the fool not dry: bid the
dishonest man mend himself; if he mend, he is no longer
dishonest; if he cannot, let the botcher mend him. any thing
that's mended is but patch'd; virtue

i must catechize you for it, madonna; good my mouse of virtue,
answer me.

olivia.
well, sir, for want of other idleness, i'll bide your proof.

clown.
good madonna, why mourn'st thou?

olivia.
good fool, for my brother's death.

clown.
i think his soul is in hell, madonna.

olivia.
i know his soul is in heaven, fool.

clown.
the more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's soul being in
heaven. take away the fool, gentlemen.

olivia.
what think you of this fool, malvolio? doth he not mend?

malvolio.
yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him. infirmity,
that decays the wise, doth ever make the better fool.

clown.
god send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the better increasing
your folly! sir toby will be sworn that i am no fox; but he will
not pass his word for twopence that you are no fool.

olivia.
how say you to that, malvolio?

malvolio.
i marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascal; i
saw him put down the other da

his guard already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to him,
he is gagg'd. i protest, i take these wise men, that crow so at
these set kind of fools, no better than the fools' zanies.

olivia.
o, you are sick of self-love, malvolio, and taste with a
distemper'd appetite. to be generous, guiltless, and of free
disposition, is to take those things for bird-bolts that you deem
cannon bullets. there is no slander in an allow'd fool, though he
do nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet man,
though he do nothing but reprove.

clown.
now mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well of
fools!

maria.
sir toby, madam, your kinsman.

olivia.
fetch him off, i pray you; he speaks nothing but madman: fie on

count, i am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
[exit malvolio.] now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old,
and people dislike it.

olivia.
what's a drunken man like, fool?

clown.
like a drown'd man, a fool, and a madman: one draught above heat
makes him a fool; the second mads him; and a third drowns him.

olivia.
go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my coz; for he's
in the third degree of drink, he's drown'd: go look after him.

clown.
he is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look to the
madman.

[re-enter malvolio.]

malvolio.
madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with you. i told
him you were sick; he takes on him to understand so much,  and
therefore comes to speak with you. i told him you were asleep; he
seems to have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore comes to
speak with you. what is to be said to him, lady? he's fortified
against any denial.

olivia.
tell him he shall not speak with me.

malvolio.
has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your door like a

with you.

olivia.
what kind o' man is he?

malvolio.
why, of mankind.

olivia.
what manner of man?

malvolio.
of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.

olivia.
of what personage and years is he?

malvolio.
not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for a boy; as a
squash is before 't is a peascod, or a codling when 't is almost
an apple: 't is with him in standing water, between boy and man.
he is very well-favour'd, and he speaks very shrewishly; one
would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.

olivia.
let him approach. call in my gentlewoman.

malvolio.
gentlewoman, my lady calls.

unless the master were the man. how now!
even so quickly may one catch the plague?
methinks i feel this youth's perfections
with an invisible and subtle stealth
to creep in at mine eyes. well, let it be.

desire him not to flatter with his lord,
nor hold him up with hopes; i am not for him.
if that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
i'll give him reasons for't. hie thee, malvolio.

malvolio.
were you not ev'n now with the countess olivia?

viola.
even now, sir; on a moderate pace i have since arriv'd but
hither.

malvolio.
she returns this ring to you, sir; you might have sav'd me my
pains, to have taken it away yourself. she adds, moreover, that
you should put your lord into a desperate assurance she will none
of him; and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to come
again in his affairs, unless it be to report your lord's taking
of this.

 receive it so.

viola.
she took the ring of me; i'll none of it.

malvolio.
come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her will is it
should be so return'd. if it be worth stooping for, there it lies
in your eye; if not, be it his that finds it.
[exit.]

viola.
i left no ring with her; what means this lady?
fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
she made good view of me; indeed, so much
that, methought, her eyes had lost her tongue,
for she did speak in starts distractedly.
she loves me, sure: the cunning of her passion
invites me in this chur

sir toby.
welcome, ass. now let's have a catch.

sir andrew.
by my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. i had rather than
forty shillings i had such a leg, and so sweet a breath to sing,
as the fool has. in sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling
last night, when thou spokest of pigrogromitus, of the vapians
passing the equinoctial of queubus; 't was very good, i' faith. i
sent thee sixpence for thy leman; hadst it?

clown.
i did impeticos thy gratillity; for malvolio's nose is no
whipstock; my lady has a white hand, and the myrmidons are no
bottle-ale houses.

sir andrew.
excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all is done. now,
a song.

sir toby.
come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.

o, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than sir toby to

to that in the letter. 'cast thy humble slough,' says she; 'be
