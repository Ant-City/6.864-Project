ouse, and crowed to his wife, "heard you were trying
to get me, myra. say, you got to hand it to little georgie, this time!
better talk careful! you are now addressing the vice-president of the
boosters' club!"

"oh, georgie--"

"pretty nice, huh? willis ijams is the new president, but when
he's away, little ole georgie takes the gavel and whoops 'em up
and introduces the speakers--no matter if they're the governor
himself--and--"

"george! listen!"

"--it puts him in solid with big men like doc dilling and--"

"george! paul riesling--"

"yes, sure, i'll 'phone paul and let him know about it right away."

"georgie! listen! paul's in jail. he shot his wife, he shot zilla, this
noon. she may not live."

he drove to the city prison, not blindly, but with unusual fussy care at
corners, the fussiness of an old woman potting plants. it kept him from
facing the obscenity of fate.

the attendant said, "naw, you can't see any of the prisoners till

misconceptions of america and some spirited words on the necessity of
keeping ignorant foreigners out of america.

"say, that was a mighty informative talk. real he-stuff," said sidney
finkelstein.

but the disaffected babbitt grumbled, "four-flusher! bunch of hot
air! and what's the matter with the immigrants? gosh, they aren't
all ignorant, and i got a hunch we're all descended from immigrants
ourselves."

"oh, you make me tired!" said mr. finkelstein.

babbitt was aware that dr. a. i. dilling was sternly listening from
across the table. dr. dilling was one of the most important men in the
boosters'. he was not a physician but a surgeon, a more romantic and
sounding occupation. he was an intense large man with a boiling of black
hair and a thick black mustache. the newspapers often chronicled his
operations; he was professor of surgery in the state university; he went
to dinner at the very best houses on royal ridge; and he was said to be
worth several hundred thousand dollars. it wa

have such a person glower at him. he hastily praised the congressman's
wit, to sidney finkelstein, but for dr. dilling's benefit.

that afternoon three men shouldered into babbitt's office with the air
of a vigilante committee in frontier days. they were large, resolute,
big-jawed men, and they were all high lords in the land of zenith--dr.
dilling the surgeon, charles mckelvey the contractor, and, most
dismaying of all, the white-bearded colonel rutherford snow, owner of
the advocate-times. in their whelming presence babbitt felt small and
insignificant.

"well, well, great pleasure, have chairs, what c'

ionately certain that he did not wish to join, and at the
thought of their forcing him he felt a stirring of anger against even
these princes of commerce.

"sorry, colonel, have to think it over a little," he mumbled.

mckelvey snarled, "that means you're not going to join, george?"

something black and unfamiliar and ferocious spoke from babbitt: "now,
you look here, charley! i'm damned if i'm going to be bullied into
joining anything, not even by you plutes!"

"we're not bullying anybody," dr. dilling began, but colonel snow thrust
him aside with, "certainly we are! we don't mind a little bullying, if
it's necessary. babbitt, the g.c.l. has been talking about you a good
deal. you're supposed to be a sensible, clean, responsible man; you
always have been; but here lately, for god knows what reason, i hear
from all sorts of sources that you're running around with a loose
crowd, and what's a whole lot worse, you've actually been advocating and
supporting some of the most dangerous elements in t

s face was as grimly creased as the mask of tragedy.

his wife greeted him with surprise. "why did you come back, dear? i
think i feel a little better. i told verona to skip off to her office.
was it wicked of me to go and get sick?"

he knew that she wanted petting, and she got it, joyously. they were
curiously happy when he heard dr. patten's car in front. he looked out
of the window. he was frightened. with patten was an impatient man
with turbulent black hair and a hussar mustache--dr. a. i. dilling,
the surgeon. babbitt sputtered with anxiety, tried to conceal it, and
hurried down to the door.

dr. patten was profusely casual: "don't want to worry you, old man, but
i thought it might be a good stunt to have dr. dilling examine her." he
gestured toward dilling as toward a master.

dilling nodded in his curtest manner and strode up-stairs babbitt
tramped the living-room in agony. except for his wife's confinements
there had never been a major operation in the family, and to him surgery
was

at once a miracle and an abomination of fear. but when dilling and
patten came down again he knew that everything was all right, and he
wanted to laugh, for the two doctors were exactly like the bearded
physicians in a musical comedy, both of them rubbing their hands and
looking foolishly sagacious.

dr. dilling spoke:

"i'm sorry, old man, but it's acute appendicitis. we ought to operate.
of course you must decide, but there's no question as to what has to be
done."

babbitt did not get all the force of it. he mumbled, "well i suppose we
could get her ready in a couple o' days. probably ted ought to come down
from the university, just in case anything happened."

dr. dilling growled, "nope. if you don't want peritonitis to set in,
we'll have to operate right away. i must advise it strongly. if you say

go ahead, i'll 'phone for the st. mary's ambulance at once, and we'll
have her on the table in three-quarters of an hour."

"i--i of course, i suppose you know what--but great god, man, i can't
get her clothes ready and everything in two seconds, you know! and in
her state, so wrought-up and weak--"

"just throw her hair-brush and comb and tooth-brush in a bag; that's
all she'll need for a day or two," said dr. dilling, and went to the
telephone.

babbitt galloped desperately up-stairs. he sent the frightened tinka out
of the room. he said gaily to his wife, "well, old thing, the doc thinks
maybe we better have a little operation and get it over. just take a few
minutes--not half as serious as a confinement--and you'll be all right
in a jiffy."

she gripped his hand till the fingers ached. she said patiently, like a
cowed child, "i'm afraid--to go into the dark, all alone!" maturity was
wiped from her eyes; t

or looked at anybody else. in the laboratory he was conscious only of a
decayed object preserved in a bottle of yellowing alcohol. it made him
very sick, but he could not take his eyes from it. he was more aware of
it than of waiting. his mind floated in abeyance, coming back always
to that horrible bottle. to escape it he opened the door to the right,
hoping to find a sane and business-like office. he realized that he was
looking into the operating-room; in one glance he took in dr. dilling,
strange in white gown and bandaged head, bending over the steel table
with its screws and wheels, then nurses holding basins and cotton
sponges, and a swathed thing, just a lifeless chin and a mound of white
in the midst of which was a square of sallow flesh with a gash a little
bloody at the edges, protruding from the gash a cluster of forceps like
clinging parasites.

he shut the door with haste. it may be that his frightened repentance of
the night and morning had not eaten in, but this deh
