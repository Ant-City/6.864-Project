me wary not of personal failure and defeat but of something more general, something large in scope and
content.

she  came  in  with  wilder  and  seated  him  on  the  kitchen  counter.  denise  and  steffie  came
downstairs  and  we  talked  about  the  school  supplies  they  would  need.  soon  it  was  time  for  lunch.  we
entered a period of chaos and noise. we milled about, bickered a little, dropped utensils. finally we were
all satisfied with what we'd been able to snatch from the cupboards and refrigerator or swipe from each
other and we began quietly plastering mustard or mayonnaise on our brightly colored food. the mood was

elbowed each other twice, although neither spoke. wilder was still seated on the counter surrounded by
open cartons, crumpled tinfoil, shiny bags of potato chips, bowls of pasty substances covered with plastic
wrap, flip-top rings and twist ties, individually wrapped slices of orange cheese. heinrich came in, studied
the scene carefully, my only son, then walked out the back door and disappeared.

denise was eleven, a hard-nosed kid.  she led a  more or less daily protest against those of her
mother's habits that struck her as wasteful or dangerous. i defended babette. i told her i was the one who
needed  to  show  discipline  in  matters  of  diet.  i  reminded  her  how  much  i  liked  the  way  she  looked.  i
suggested there was an honesty inherent in bulkiness if it is just the right amount. people trust a certain
amount of bulk in others.

we walked home under a marigold moon. our house looked old and wan at the end of the street,
the porch light shining on a molded plastic tricycle, a stack of three-hour colored-flame sawdust and wax
logs.  denise  was  doing  her  homework  in  the  kitchen,  keeping  an  eye  on  wilder,  who  had  wandered
downstairs  to  sit  on  the  floor  and  stare  through  the  oven  window.  silence  in  the  halls,  shadows  on  the
sloping lawn. we closed the door and disrobed. the bed was a mess. magazines, curtain rods, a child's
sooty  sock.  babette  hummed  something  from  a  broadway  show,  putting  the  rods  in  a  corner.  we

"it's obvious," he said.

he  asked  me  why  i'd  chosen  this  year  in  particular  to  learn  german,  after  so  many  years  of

slipping past the radar. i told him there was a hitler conference scheduled for next spring at the college-
on-the-hill. three days of lectures, workshops and panels. hitler scholars from seventeen states and nine
foreign countries. actual germans would be in attendance.


at  home  denise  placed  a  moist  bag  of  garbage  in  the  kitchen  compactor.  she  started  up  the
machine.  the  ram  stroked  downward  with  a  dreadful  wrenching  sound,  full  of  eerie  feeling.  children
walked in and out of the kitchen, water dripped in the sink, the washing machine heaved in the entrance

babette  came  in  from  running,  her  outfit  soaked  through.  murray  walked  across  the  kitchen  to

shake  her  hand.  she  fell  into  a  chair,  scanned  the  room  for  wilder.  i  watched  denise  make  a  mental
comparison  between  her  mother's  running  clothes  and  the  wet  bag  she'd  dumped  in  the  compactor.  i
could see it in her eyes, a sardonic connection. it was these secondary levels of life, these extrasensory
flashes  and  floating  nuances  of  being,  these  pockets  of  rapport  forming  unexpectedly,  that  made  me
believe we were a magic act, adults and children together, sharing unaccountable things.

denise  and  steffie  stayed  home  that  week  as  men  in  mylex  suits  and  respirator  masks  made
systematic  sweeps  of  the  building  with  infrared  detecting  and  measuring  equipment.  because  mylex  is
itself  a  suspect  material,  the  results  tended  to  be  ambiguous  and  a  second  round  of  more  rigorous

the  toneless  systems,  the  jangle  and  skid  of  carts,  the  loudspeaker  and  coffee-making  machines,  the
cries of children. and over it all, or under it all, a dull and unlocatable roar, as of some form of swarming
life just outside the range of human apprehension.
"did you tell denise you were sorry?"

"maybe later," steffie said. "remind me."

"she's a sweet girl and she wants to be your older sister and your friend if you'll let her."

"i don't know about friend. she's a little bossy, don't you think?"

"aside from telling her you're sorry, be sure to give her back her physicians' desk reference."

"she reads that thing all the time. don't you think that's weird?"

"at least she reads something."

"ask baba," she said.


murray came out of an aisle and walked alongside babette, just ahead of us. he took a twin roll of
paper towels out of her cart and smelled it. denise had found some friends and they went up front to look
at  the  paperback  books  in  spindly  racks,  the  books  with  shiny  metallic  print,  raised  letters,  vivid
illustrations of cult violence and windswept romance. denise was wearing a green visor. i heard babette
tell murray she'd been wearing it fourteen hours a day for three weeks now. she would not go out without
it, would not even leave her room. she wore it in school, when there was school, wore it to the toilet, the

i scooped wilder off a chair and gave him a noisy kiss on the ear and he shrank away in delight.

there were little holes in the cuffs of his thermal undershirt. we were standing in the middle of the
room. i waited for him to go on. it was the time of year, the time of day, for a small insistent sadness to

when i got home, bob pardee was in the kitchen practicing his golf swing. bob is denise's father.
he said he was driving through town on his way to glassboro to make a presentation and thought he'd
take us all to dinner.

he  swung  his  locked  hands  in  slow  motion  over  his  left  shoulder,  following  through  smoothly.
denise eyed him from a stool by the window. he wore a half shaggy cardigan with sleeves that draped
over the cuffs.

later i sat up in bed in my bathrobe studying german. i muttered words to myself and wondered
whether i'd be able to restrict my german-speaking at the spring conference to brief opening remarks or
whether the other participants would expect the language to be used throughout, in lectures, at meals, in
small talk, as a mark of our seriousness, our uniqueness in world scholarship.
the tv said: "and other trends that could dramatically impact your portfolio."


denise  came  in  and  sprawled  across  the  foot  of  the  bed,  her  head  resting  on  her  folded  arms,
facing  away  from  me.  how  many  codes,  countercodes,  social  histories  were  contained  in  this  simple
posture? a full minute passed.

steffie came in wearing denise's green visor. i didn't know what this meant. she climbed up on
the  bed  and  all  three  of  us  went  through  my  german-english  dictionary,  looking  for  words  that  sound
about the same in both languages, like orgy and shoe.

again.

at  the  house  no  one  spoke.  they  all  moved  quietly  from  room  to  room,  watching  him  distantly,
with sneaky and respectful looks. when he asked for some milk, denise ran softly to the kitchen, barefoot,
in  her  pajamas,  sensing  that  by  economy  of  movement  and  lightness  of  step  she  might  keep  from
disturbing the grave and dramatic air he had brought with him into the house. he drank the milk down in a
single powerful swallow, still fully dressed, a mitten pinned to his sleeve.

they watched him with something like awe. nearly seven straight hours of serious crying. it was

"there'll be one more soon."

the next day denise decided to confront her mother directly about the medication she was or was

not  taking,  hoping  to  trick  babette  into  a  confession,  an  admission  or  some  minimal  kind  of  flustered
response. this was not a tactic the girl and i had discussed but i couldn't help admiring the boldness of

nagging us to higher conscience, then bee was a silent witness, calling the very meaning of our lives into

stairs to denise's room, where the tv set was currently located. the volume was kept way down, the girls
engaged in a rapt dialogue with their guest. murray looked happy to be there. he sat in the middle of the
floor taking notes, his toggle coat and touring cap next to him on the rug. the room around him was rich in
codes and messages, an archaeology of childhood, things denise had carried with her since the age of

only wilder remained calm. he watched his mother, spoke to her in half-words, sensible-sounding
fragments that were mainly fabricated. as the camera pulled back to allow babette to demonstrate some
fine point of standing or walking, wilder approached the set and touched her body, leaving a handprint on
the dusty surface of the screen.

then denise crawled up to the set and turned the volume dial. nothing happened. there was no
sound, no voice, nothing. she turned to look at me, a moment of renewed confusion. heinrich advanced,
fiddled with the dial, stuck his hand behind the set to adjust the recessed knobs. when he tried another
channel, the sound boomed out, raw and fuzzy. back at the cable station, he couldn't raise a buzz and as

elsewhere  in  the  house.  at  dinner  denise  kept  getting  up  and  walking  in  small  stiff  rapid  strides  to  the
toilet off the hall, a hand clapped to her mouth. we paused in odd moments of chewing or salt-sprinkling

denise looked at steffie.

"is it because we want to get it out of the way?" she said.

"why do we want to get it out of the way?"

"in case something happens," steffie said.

"what could happen?" babette said.


the girls looked at each other again, a solemn and lingering exchange that indicated some dark
suspicion  was  being  confirmed.  air-raid  sirens  sounded  again,  this  time  so  close  to  us  that  we  were

steffie read a coupon for baby lux, crying softly. this brought denise to life. she went upstairs to
pack some things for all of us. heinrich raced two steps at a time to the attic for his binoculars, highway
map and radio. babette went to the pantry and began gathering tins and jars with familiar life enhancing
labels.
steffie helped me clear the table.


twenty minutes later we were in the car. the voice on the radio said that people in the west end
of town were to head for the abandoned boy scout camp, where red cross volunteers would dispense

"because it only affects humans and rats."

"i don't believe you."

"ask jack."

"ask heinrich," i said.


"it could be true," he said, clearly lying. "they use rats to test for things that humans can catch, so
it means we get the same diseases, rats and humans. besides, they wouldn't use dogs if they thought it
could hurt them."
"why not?"

"a dog is a mammal."

"so's a rat," denise said.

"a rat is a vermin," babette said.

"mostly what a rat is," heinrich said, "is a rodent."

"it's also a vermin."

"a cockroach is a vermin," steffie said.

"a cockroach is an insect. you count the legs is how you know."

"it's also a vermin."

"does a cockroach get cancer? no," denise said. "that  must mean a rat is  more  like a human

kitchen  radio,  where  she  and  denise  had  probably  learned  about  sweaty  palms  and  vomiting  before
developing these symptoms themselves. i didn't think steffie knew what déjà vu meant, but it was possible
babette had told her. déjà vu, however, was no longer a working symptom of nyodene contamination. it
had been preempted by coma, convulsions, and miscarriage. if steffie had learned about déjà vu on the
radio but then missed the subsequent upgrading to more deadly conditions, it could mean she was in a

"nothing surprises me anymore," babette said.

"isn't that the truth."

"or if there were little bitty surprises. that would be a surprise. instead of things like this."

"god jehovah's got a bigger surprise in store than this," the woman said.

steffie and wilder were asleep in one of  the cots. denise sat at the other end engrossed in the
physicians' desk reference. several air mattresses were stacked against the wall. there was a long line
at the emergency telephone, people calling relatives or trying to reach the switchboard at one or another
radio call-in show.  the radios here were tuned  mainly to just such shows. babette sat in  a camp chair,

was an empty air mattress on the floor but i wanted to share babette's and eased myself next to her body,

remained.  i  fell  at  once  into  marine  oblivion,  a  deep-dwelling  crablike  consciousness,  silent  and

sure  babette  was  still  there,  ironing  blouses  and  listening  to  a  call-in  show  on  the  radio,  a  form  of
entertainment she'd recently become addicted to. i went down to the kitchen, found the doctor's name in
the phone book and dialed his home number.
the  doctor's  name  was  hookstratten.  it  sounded  sort  of  german.  i'd  met  him  once--a  stooped

man with a bird-wattled face and deep voice. denise had said to trick him but the only way to do that was
within  a  context  of  honesty  and  truthfulness.  if  i  pretended  to  be  a  stranger  seeking  information  about
dylar, he would either hang up or tell me to come into the office.
he  answered  on  the  fourth  or  fifth  ring.  i  told  him  who  i  was  and  said  i  was  concerned  about

babette. concerned enough to call him at home--an admittedly rash act but one i hoped he'd be able to

this  sounded  like  a  malpractice  disclaimer.  maybe  he  was  reading  it  from  a  printed  card  like  a
detective informing a suspect of his constitutional rights. i thanked him, hung up, called my own doctor at
home. he answered on the seventh ring, said he thought dylar was an island in the persian gulf, one of
those oil terminals crucial to the survival of the west. a woman did the weather in the background.

i  went  upstairs  and  told  denise  not  to  worry.  i  would  take  a  tablet  from  the  bottle  and  have  it
analyzed by someone in the chemistry department at the college. i waited for her to tell me she'd already
done  that.  but  she  just  nodded  grimly  and  i  headed  down  the  hall,  stopping  in  heinrich's  room  to  say
goodnight. he was doing chinning exercises in the closet, using a bar clamped to the doorway.

was absent from her cubicle whenever i looked in.

at  home  denise  made  it  a  point  not  to  bring  up  the  subject  of  dylar.  she  did  not  want  to  put
pressure on me and even avoided eye contact, as if an exchange of significant looks was more than our

sound, full of terrible desperate effort. she took my head in her hands, gently and yet fiercely, and rocked

be.

later, after she'd fallen off my body and into a restless sleep, i kept on staring into the dark. the
radio came on. i threw off the covers and went into the bathroom. denise's scenic paperweights sat on a
dusty shelf by the door. i ran water over my hands and wrists. i splashed cold water on my face. the only

out to the car and distributed paper napkins. we settled in to eat. we ate fully dressed, in hats and heavy
