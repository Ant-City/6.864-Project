tick's end!" said the doctor. "no more wounded than
you or i. the man has had a stroke, as i warned him. now, mrs. hawkins,
just you run upstairs to your husband and tell him, if possible, nothing
about it. for my part, i must do my best to save this fellow's trebly
worthless life; jim, you get me a basin."

when i got back with the basin, the doctor had already ripped up the
captain's sleeve and exposed his great sinewy arm. it was tattooed
in several places. "here's luck," "a fair wind," and "billy bones his
fancy," were very neatly and clearly executed on the forearm; and up
near the shoulder there was a sketch of a gallows and a man hanging from
it--done, as i thought, with great spirit.

"prophetic," said the doctor, touching this picture with his finger.
"and now, master billy bones, if that be your name, we'll have a look at
the colour of your blood. jim," he said, "are you afraid of blood?"

"no, sir," said i.

"well, then," said he, "you hold the basin"; and with that he took his

edical scissors. it
contained two things--a book and a sealed paper.

"first of all we'll try the book," observed the doctor.

the squire and i were both peering over his shoulder as he opened
it, for dr. livesey had kindly motioned me to come round from the
side-table, where i had been eating, to enjoy the sport of the search.
on the first page there were only some scraps of writing, such as a man
with a pen in his hand might make for idleness or practice. one was the
same as the tattoo mark, "billy bones his fancy"; then there was "mr. w.
bones, mate," "no more rum," "off palm key he got itt," and some other
snatches, mostly single words and unintelligible. i could not help
wondering who it was that had "got itt," and what "itt" was that he got.
a knife in his back as like as not.

"not much instruction there," said dr. livesey as he passed on.

the next ten or twelve pages were filled with a curious series of
entries. there was a date at one end of the line and at the other a
sum of money, as

here are they now? pew was that sort,
and he died a beggar-man. flint was, and he died of rum at savannah. ah,
they was a sweet crew, they was! on'y, where are they?"

"but," asked dick, "when we do lay 'em athwart, what are we to do with
'em, anyhow?"

"there's the man for me!" cried the cook admiringly. "that's what i call
business. well, what would you think? put 'em ashore like maroons? that
would have been england's way. or cut 'em down like that much pork? that
would have been flint's, or billy bones's."

"billy was the man for that," said israel. "'dead men don't bite,' says
he. well, he's dead now hisself; he knows the long and short on it now;
and if ever a rough hand come to port, it was billy."

"right you are," said silver; "rough and ready. but mark you here,
i'm an easy man--i'm quite the gentleman, says you; but this time it's
serious. dooty is dooty, mates. i give my vote--death. when i'm in
parlyment and riding in my coach, i don't want none of these sea-lawyers

fore, main, and mizzen, sir. but the
main--that's the big un, with the cloud on it--they usually calls
the spy-glass, by reason of a lookout they kept when they was in the
anchorage cleaning, for it's there they cleaned their ships, sir, asking
your pardon."

"i have a chart here," says captain smollett. "see if that's the place."

long john's eyes burned in his head as he took the chart, but by the
fresh look of the paper i knew he was doomed to disappointment. this
was not the map we found in billy bones's chest, but an accurate copy,
complete in all things--names and heights and soundings--with the single
exception of the red crosses and the written notes. sharp as must have
been his annoyance, silver had the strength of mind to hide it.

"yes, sir," said he, "this is the spot, to be sure, and very prettily
drawed out. who might have done that, i wonder? the pirates were too
ignorant, i reckon. aye, here it is: 'capt. kidd's anchorage'--just
the name my shipmate called it. there's a strong cur

mind," said silver with an accent so curious that i
could not, for the life of me, decide whether he were laughing at my
request or had been favourably affected by my courage.

"i'll put one to that," cried the old mahogany-faced seaman--morgan
by name--whom i had seen in long john's public-house upon the quays of
bristol. "it was him that knowed black dog."

"well, and see here," added the sea-cook. "i'll put another again to
that, by thunder! for it was this same boy that faked the chart from
billy bones. first and last, we've split upon jim hawkins!"

"then here goes!" said morgan with an oath.

and he sprang up, drawing his knife as if he had been twenty.

"avast, there!" cried silver. "who are you, tom morgan? maybe you
thought you was cap'n here, perhaps. by the powers, but i'll teach you
better! cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before you,
first and last, these thirty year back--some to the yard-arm, shiver
my timbers, and some by the board, and all to feed the fishes.

nd we thought,
besides, they had had more than enough of fighting.

therefore the work was pushed on briskly. gray and ben gunn came and
went with the boat, while the rest during their absences piled treasure
on the beach. two of the bars, slung in a rope's end, made a good load
for a grown man--one that he was glad to walk slowly with. for my part,
as i was not much use at carrying, i was kept busy all day in the cave
packing the minted money into bread-bags.

it was a strange collection, like billy bones's hoard for the diversity
of coinage, but so much larger and so much more varied that i think i
never had more pleasure than in sorting them. english, french, spanish,
portuguese, georges, and louises, doubloons and double guineas and
moidores and sequins, the pictures of all the kings of europe for the
last hundred years, strange oriental pieces stamped with what looked
like wisps of string or bits of spider's web, round pieces and square
pieces, and pieces bored through the middle, as if to w
