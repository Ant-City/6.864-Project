Becky Thatcher - 
                Judge
Thatcher's pretty, yellow-haired daughter. From almost the minute
she moves to town, Becky is the "Adored Unknown" who stirs Tom's
lively romantic sensibility. Naive at first, Becky soon matches Tom
as a romantic strategist, and the two go to great lengths to make
each other jealous.
