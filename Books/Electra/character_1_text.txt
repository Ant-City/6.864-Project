near the threshold.)

elektra.

(with wild determination!) 
well then, alone! 

(she begins to dig by the wall of the house, at the side of the 
threshold, eagerly, without a sound, like an animal. elektra pauses 
in her digging, looks round, and continues. she looks round again 
and listens. elektra digs again. orestes stands by the gate of 
the courtyard, in black relief against the last rays of sun. elektra 
looks up at him: he turns slowly, so that his eyes rest on her. 
elektra starts up violently.) 

elektra.

orestes. 

i and another, 

who is with me, have come with weighty tidings, 
to the queen. 

elektra 

(is silent}. 

orestes. 

we have been sent to her 
because we can give witness that her son 
orestes is dead indeed. we saw him perish, 
for he was dragged to death by his own horses. 
i was as old as he and his companion 
by day and night. 

elektra. 

must i still 

see thee? dost drag thy footsteps 
to this, my haunt of desolation? 
misfortune's herald! trumpet forth thy tidings, 
unto others, there where they rejoice!

( the old gloomy attendant rushes in silently from the courtyard, 

followed by three other attendants, prostrates himself before orestes 

and kisses his feet. the others kiss his hands and the hem of his 

garment?)

grim hate, hate hollow-eyed, my spouse to be. 
thus was i made a prophetess always of terror, 
and nothing e'er came forth from me, but curses 
without end, and fierce despair and frenzy. 
why are thine eyes thus full of fear? speak to me! 
speak then! lo! ev'ry limb of thee doth quake. 

orestes. 

let be! let these limbs quake. they know 
the path that they must travel. 

elektra.

orestes.

i have come,

by the door of the house. a servant appears with a torch and the

orestes and the tutor go within. the servant fastens the torch 
to an iron ring in the doorpost. orestes closes his eyes a moment, 
as though giddy, the tutor is close behind him. they exchange 
rapid glances, the door closes behind them. elektra alone in hor- 
rible excitement, runs to and fro in front of the door, with bowed 
head, like a captive beast in a cage.)

woe unto me? the axe i could not give him! 
they have departed and he hath not taken
