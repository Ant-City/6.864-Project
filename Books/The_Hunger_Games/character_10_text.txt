n. volunteering 
to wash haymitch but then challenging him this morning 
when apparently the nice-guy approach had failed. and now 
the waving at the window, already trying to win the crowd. 
all of the pieces are still fitting together, but i sense he has 
a plan forming. he hasn’t accepted his death. he is already 
fighting hard to stay alive. which also means that kind peeta 
mellark, the boy who gave me the bread, is fighting hard to kill 
me.

r-i-i-i-p! i grit my teeth as venia, a woman with aqua hair 
and gold tattoos above her eyebrows, yanks a strip of fabric 
from my leg tearing out the hair beneath it. “sorry!” she pipes 
in her silly capitol accent. “you’re just so hairy!” 
why do these people speak in such a high pitch? why do 
their jaws barely open when they talk? why do the ends of 
their sentences go up as if they’re asking a question? odd vo-
wels, clipped words, and always a hiss on the letter  s  .  .  . no 
wonder it’s impossible not to mi

mic them. 
venia makes what’s supposed to be a sympathetic face. 
“good news, though. this is the last one. ready?” i get a grip 
on the edges of the table i’m seated on and nod. the final 
swathe of my leg hair is uprooted in a painful jerk. 
i’ve been in the remake center for more than three hours 
and i still haven’t met my stylist. apparently he has no interest 
in seeing me until venia and the other members of my prep 
team have addressed some obvious problems. this has in-
cluded scrubbing down my body with a gritty loam that has 
removed not only dirt but at least three layers of skin, turning 
my nails into uniform shapes, and primarily, ridding my body 
of hair. my legs, arms, torso, underarms, and parts of my eye-
brows have been stripped of the muff, leaving me like a

ntensely vulnerable. but i have kept my 
side of the bargain with haymitch, and no objection has 
crossed my lips. 
“you’re doing very well,” says some guy named flavius. he 
gives his orange corkscrew locks a shake and applies a fresh 
coat of purple lipstick to his mouth. “if there’s one thing we 
can’t stand, it’s a whiner. grease her down!” 
venia and octavia, a plump woman whose entire body has 
been dyed a pale shade of pea green, rub me down with a lo-
tion that first stings but then soothes my raw skin. then they 
pull me from the table, removing the thin robe i’ve been al-
lowed to wear off and on. i stand there, completely naked, as 
the three circle me, wielding tweezers to remove any last bits 
of hair. i know i should be embarrassed, but they’re so unlike 
people that i’m no more self-conscious than if a trio of oddly

the three step back and admire their work. “excellent! you 
almost look like a human being now!” says flavius, and they 
all laugh. 
i force my lips up into a smile to show how grateful i am. 
“thank you,” i say sweetly. “we don’t have much cause to look 
nice in district twelve.” 
this wins them over completely. “of course, you don’t, you 
poor darling!” says octavia clasping her hands together in dis-
tress for me. 
“but don’t worry,” says venia. “by the time cinna is through 
with you, you’re going to be absolutely gorgeous!”

“we promise! you know, now that we’ve gotten rid of all 
the hair and filth, you’re not horrible at all!” says flavius en-
couragingly. “let’s call cinna!” 
they dart out of the room. it’s hard to hate my prep team. 
they’re such total idiots. and yet, in an odd way, i know 
they’re sincerely trying to help me.

in the morning, it’s not the girl but my prep team who are 
hanging over me. my lessons with effie and haymitch are 
over. this day belongs to cinna. he’s my last hope. maybe he 
can make me look so wonderful, no one will care what comes 
out of my mouth. 
the team works on me until late afternoon, turning my skin 
to glowing satin, stenciling patterns on my arms, painting 
flame designs on my twenty perfect nails. then venia goes to 
work on my hair, weaving strands of red into a pattern that 
begins at my left ear, wraps around my head, and then falls in 
one braid down my right shoulder. they erase my face with a 
layer of pale makeup and draw my features back out. huge 
dark eyes, full red lips, lashes that throw off bits of light when 
i blink. finally, they cover my entire body in a powder that 
makes me shimmer in gold dust. 
then cinna enters with what i assume is my dress, but i 
can’t really see it becau

 the hospital then is far underground, 
even beneath the gym where the tributes practiced tying 
knots and throwing spears. the windows of the lobby are 
darkened, and a handful of guards stand on duty. no one else 
is there to see us cross to the tribute elevator. our footsteps 
echo in the emptiness. and when we ride up to the twelfth 
floor, the faces of all the tributes who will never return flash 
across my mind and there’s a heavy, tight place in my chest. 
when the elevator doors open, venia, flavius, and octavia 
engulf me, talking so quickly and ecstatically i can’t make out 
their words. the sentiment is clear though. they are truly 
thrilled to see me and i’m happy to see them, too, although not

to see an affectionate trio of pets at the end of a particularly 
difficult day.

 ‘girl on fire’ thing?” i ask. 
“you tell me,” he says, and slips it over my head. i imme-
diately notice the padding over my breasts, adding curves that 
hunger has stolen from my body. my hands go to my chest and 
i frown. 
“i know,” says cinna before i can object. “but the game-
makers wanted to alter you surgically. haymitch had a huge 
fight with them over it. this was the compromise.” he stops 
me before i can look at my reflection. “wait, don’t forget the 
shoes.” venia helps me into a pair of flat leather sandals and i 
turn to the mirror. 
i am still the “girl on fire.” the sheer fabric softly glows. 
even the slight movement in the air sends a ripple up my 
body. by comparison, the chariot costume seems garish, the 
interview dress too contrived. in this dress, i give the illusion 
of wearing candlelight. 
“what do you think?” asks cinna. 
“i think it’s the best yet,” i say. when i manage to pull my 
eyes away from the flickering fabric, i’m

  the anthem booms in my ears, and then i hear caesar 
flickerman greeting the audience. does he know how crucial 
it is to get every word right from now on? he must. he will 
want to help us. the crowd breaks into applause as the prep 
teams are presented. i imagine flavius, venia, and octavia 
bouncing around and taking ridiculous, bobbing bows. it’s a 
safe bet they’re clueless. then effie’s introduced. how long 
she’s waited for this moment. i hope she’s able to enjoy it be-
cause as misguided as effie can be, she has a very keen in-
stinct about certain things and must at least suspect we’re in 
trouble. portia and cinna receive huge cheers, of course, 
they’ve been brilliant, had a dazzling debut. i now understand 
cinna’s choice of dress for me for
