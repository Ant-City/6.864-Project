 to make them up in
advance of the transgressions; that’s the logical way.
“oh god,” anna says, “david thinks he’s a great white hunter.” she’s teasing him,
she does that a lot; but he doesn’t hear, he’s getting up, claude is hustling him off to
make him out a licence, it seems claude is in charge of the licences. when david
comes back i want to ask how much he paid, but he’s too pleased, i don’t want to
spoil it. claude is pleased also.
we find out from claude we can hire evans, who owns the blue moon cabins, to
run us down the lake. paul would take us for nothing, he offered, but i wouldn’t feel
right about it; also i’m sure he would misinterpret joe’s amorphous beard and
david’s moustache and three musketeers hair. they’re just a style now, like crew
cuts, but paul might feel they are dangerous, they mean riots.
david eases the car down the turnoff, two ruts and a rock hump in the centre that
scrapes the car’s belly. we brake in front of the cabin marked

 office; evans is there, a
bulky laconic american in checked shirt and peaked cap and a thick knitted jacket
with an eagle on the back. he knows where my father’s place is, all the older guides
know every house on the lake. he moves his cigarette butt to the corner of his
mouth and says he’ll take us there, ten miles, for five dollars; for another five he’ll
pick us up two days from now, in the morning. that will give us the rest of the day
to drive back to the city. he’s heard of the disappearance, o

dying something; it was during the sixties, i’m not sure when.
my friends’ pasts are vague to me and to each other also, any one of us could have
amnesia for years and the others wouldn’t notice.
when david has backed the car down to the blue moon dock we unload our stuff,
the packsacks of clothes, the camera equipment, the samsonite case with my career
in it, the half dozen red caps they got at the motel and the paper bag of food. we
scramble into the boat, a battered wood-hulled launch; evans starts the motor and
we churn out slowly. summer cottages beginning to sprout here, they spread like
measles, it must be the paved road.
david sits in front beside evans. “gettin’ many fish?” he asks, folksy, chummy,
crafty. “here and there, here and there,” evans says, giving no free handouts; then
he switches the motor into high gear and i can’t hear any more.
i wait until we’re into the middle of the lake. at the right moment i look over my
shoulder as i always did and there is

e drown
every year, boats loaded topheavy or drunken fishermen running at high speed into
deadheads, old pieces of tree waterlogged and partly decayed, floating under the
surface, there are a lot of them left over from the logging and the time they raised
the lake level. because of the convolutions it’s easy to lose the way if you haven’t
memorized the landmarks and i watch for them now, dome-shaped hill, point with
dead pine, stubble of cut trunks poking up from a shallows, i don’t trust evans.
but he’s taken the right turns so far, we’re coming into my territory, two short
bends and through a passage between granite shores and out into a wider bay. the
peninsula is where i left it, pushing out from the island shore with the house not
even showing through the trees, though i know where it is; camouflage was one of
my father’s policies.
evans arches the boat around the point and slows for the dock. the dock slants,
the ice takes something away from it every winter and the water

wn by the water. she ran to the dock, he wasn’t there, she went out to the end of it
and looked down. my brother was under the water, face upturned, eyes open and
unconscious, sinking gently; air was coming out of his mouth.
it was before i was born but i can remember it as clearly as if i saw it, and perhaps
i did see it: i believe that an unborn baby has its eyes open and can look out through
the walls of the mother’s stomach, like a frog in a jar.
chapter four
we unload our baggage while evans idles the motor. when david has paid him he
gives us an uninterested nod and backs the boat out, then turns it and swings around
the point, the sound dwindling to a whine and fading as land and distance move
between us. the lake jiggles against the shore, the waves subside, nothing remains
but a faint iridescent film of gasoline, purple and pink and green. the space is quiet,
the wind has gone down and the lake is flat, silver-white, it’s the first time all day

endless;
even when we knew which tree he had gone behind there was the fear that what
would come out when you called would be someone else.
chapter six
no one can expect anything else from me. i checked everything, i tried; now i’m
absolved from knowing. i should be telling someone official, filling in forms,
getting help as you’re supposed to in an emergency. but it’s like searching for a
ring lost on a beach or in the snow: futile. there’s no act i can perform except
waiting; tomorrow evans will ship us to the village, and after that we’ll travel to the
city and the present tense. i’ve finished what i came for and i don’t want to stay here,
i want to go back to where there is electricity and distraction. i’m used to it now,
filling the time without it is an effort.
the others are trying to amuse themselves. joe and david are out in one of the
canoes; i should have made them take life-jackets, neither of them can steer, they’re
shifting their paddles from side to side. i

think?” and joe says “okay by me.”
“great,” says david, “we’ll do some more fishing.”
i sit down on the bed. they might have asked me first, it’s my house. though
maybe they’re waiting till i come out, they’ll ask then. if i say i don’t want to they
can’t very well stay; but what reason can i give? i can’t tell them about my father,
betray him; anyway they might think i was making it up. there’s my work, but they
know i have it with me. i could leave by myself with evans but i’d only get as far as
the village: it’s david’s car, i’d have to steal the keys, and also, i remind myself, i
never learned to drive.
anna makes a last feeble attempt. “i’ll run out of cigarettes.”
“do you good,” david says cheerfully, “filthy habit. get you back into shape.”
he’s older than we are, he’s over thirty, he’s beginning to worry about that; every
now and then he hits himself in the stomach and says “flab.”
“i’ll get crabby,” anna says, but

david only laughs and says “try it.”
i could tell them there isn’t enough food. but they’d spot that as a lie, there’s the
garden and the rows of cans on the shelves, corned beef, spam, baked beans,
chicken, powdered milk, everything.
i go to the room door, open it. “you’ll have to pay evans the five anyway,” i say.
for a moment they’re startled, they realize i’ve overheard. then david says “no
sweat.” he gives me a quick look, triumphant and appraising, as though he’s just
won something: not a war but a lottery.
when evans turns up at the appointed time david and joe go down to the dock to
arrange things with him. i warned them not to say anything about the fish: if they do,
this part of the lake will be swarming with americans, they have an uncanny way of
passing the

word, like ants about sugar, or lobsters. after a few minutes i hear the
boat starting again and accelerating and diminishing, he’s gone.
i’ve avoided evans and the explanation and negotiations by going up to the
outhouse and latching myself in. that was where i went when there was something i
didn’t want to do, like weeding the garden. it’s the new outhouse, the old one got
used up. this one is built of logs; my brother and i made the hole for it, he dug with
the shovel and i hauled the sand up in a pail. once a porcupine fell in, they like to
chew axe handles and toilet seats.
in the city i never hid in bathrooms; i didn’t like them, they w

 the examples, with
black oblongs across their eyes like condemned criminals: the only pictures of
naked bodies it was judged proper for us to see. the rest were diagrams,
transparencies with labels and arrows, the ovaries purple sea creatures, the womb a
pear.
the voices of the others and the riffle and slap of cards reach me through the
closed door. canned laughter, they carry it with them, the midget reels of tape and
the on switch concealed somewhere in their chests, instant playback.
after evans left that day i was uneasy: the island wasn’t safe, we were trapped on
it. they didn’t realize it but i did, i was responsible for them. the sense of watching
eyes, his presence lurking just behind the green leafscreen, ready to pounce or take
flight, he wasn’t predictable, i was trying to think of ways to keep them out of
danger; they would be all right as long as they didn’t go anywhere alone. he might
be harmless but i couldn’t be sure.

ke and re-loaded the canoes and shoved them out over the
snarl of logs. in the bay the felled trees and numbered posts showed where the
surveyors had been, power company. my country, sold or drowned, a reservoir; the
people were sold along with the land and the animals, a bargain, sale, solde. les
soldes they called them, sellouts, the flood would depend on who got elected, not
here but somewhere else.
chapter sixteen
it was the sixth day, i had to find out; it would be my last chance, tomorrow evans
was coming to take us back. my brain was rushing, covering over the bad things and
filling the empty spaces with an embroidery of calculations and numbers, i needed
to finish, i had never finished anything. to be exact, to condense myself to a
pinpoint, impaling a fact, a certainty.
as soon as i could i re-checked the map. the x was where it should have been, i
hadn’t made a mistake. there was only one theory i could retreat to: some of the
crosses might be places he thought suitable for pain

ange, but he followed
along behind me. “sorry i blew my cool,” he said. his voice had changed again,
now it was deferential. “it’s between us, okay? no need to mention it to anna,
right?” if he’d succeeded he would have told her as soon as he could. “i respect you
for it, i really do.”
“that’s all right,” i said; i knew he was lying.
they sat around the table in the regular places and i served dinner. there hadn’t
been any lunch but no one mentioned that.
“what time is evans coming tomorrow?” i said.
“ten, ten-thirty,” david said. “have a nice afternoon?” he said to anna. joe stuck
a new potato with his fork and put it into his mouth.
“fantastic,” anna said. “i got some sun and finished my book, then i had a long
talk with joe and went for a stroll.” joe chewed, his closed mouth moving, silent
refutation. “and you?”
“great,” david said, his voice buoyant, inflated. he bent his arm onto the table,
his hand brushing mine casually, as though

ds and failed pictures, canvas bundle of clothes, nothing i need. they sit on the
dock talking; anna is smoking, she’s reduced to the last one.
“christ,” she says, “i’ll be glad to hit the city. stock up again.”
i go up the steps once more to make sure they haven’t left anything. the jays are
there, flowing from tree to tree, voices semaphoring, tribal; they retreat to the upper
branches, they still haven’t decided whether i can be trusted. the cabin is the way we
found it; when evans arrives i’ll snap the lock.
“you should take the canoes up before he comes,” i say when i’m back down.
“they go in the toolshed.”
“right,” david says. he consults his watch, but they don’t get up. they have the
camera out, they’re discussing the movie; the zipper bag of equipment is beside
them, the tripod, the reels of film in their canisters.
“i figure we can start cutting it in two or three weeks,” david says, his version of
a pro. “we’ll take it into the lab firs

noe and wait. the still water gathers the heat;
birds, off in the forest a woodpecker, somewhere a thrush. through the trees the sun
glances; the swamp around me smoulders, energy of decay turning to growth, green
fire. i remember the heron; by now it will be insects, frogs, fish, other herons. my
body also changes, the creature in me, plant-animal, sends out filaments in me; i
ferry it secure between death and life, i multiply.
the motor approaching wakes me: it’s out on the lake, it will be evans. i beach the
canoe, knot the rope to a tree. they won’t be expecting me, not from this direction; i
have to make sure they leave with him as they should, it would be their way to
pretend but stay behind to catch me when i come back.
it’s less than a quarter of a mile through the trees, swerving to avoid branches,
careful where i step, along the vestiges of the coded trail to where the laboratory
shelves were, if i didn’t know the trail was there i could never find it. as evans’ boat

i can see them through the screen of plant stems.
they stoop, they’re loading the things into the boat. i wonder if they’re taking
mine as well, my clothes, fragments of pictures.
they stand talking with evans, their voices low, inaudible; but they’ll be
explaining, they’ll have to invent some reason, accident, say why i’m not with them.
they will be plotting, a strategy for recapture; or will they really go off and discard
me, vanish into the catacombs of the city, giving me up for lost, stashing me away in
their heads with all the obsolete costumes and phrases? for them i’ll soon be ancient
as crew cuts and world war songs, a half-remembered face in a highschool
yearbook, a captured enemy m

m me. after a minute he
reappears, stumping back down the hill to them, shoulders sloped in defeat. perhaps
by now he understands.
they clamber into the boat. anna pauses for a moment, turned directly towards
me, face in the sunlight puzzled, oddly forlorn: does she see me, is she going to
wave goodbye? then the others reach out hands to her and lift her in, a gesture that
looks from a distance almost like love.
the boat chugs backwards into the bay, then swings into forward and roars.
bullhead evans at the wheel, checkshirted and stolid, american, they are all
americans now. but they are really going, really gone, a ringing in my ears and
then a silence. i get to my feet slowly, my body is cramped from not moving; on the
bare flesh of my legs are the imprints of leaves and twigs.
i walk to the hill and scan the shoreline, finding the place, opening, where they
disappeared: checking, reassuring. it’s true, i am by myself; this is what i wanted, to
stay here alone. from any rational point

and turn blue, and with the lamp on i can’t see what’s happening outside. i blow it
out and sit in darkness, listening to the gush of the wind, but it doesn’t rain.
after a while i decide to go to bed. i’m not tired, i slept in the afternoon, but
there’s nothing else to do. in my room i stand for a long time wondering why i’m
afraid to take off my clothes: am i worried that they’ll come back for me, if they do
i’ll have to get out quickly; but they wouldn’t try it in a storm, evans knows better
than that, the open lake is the worst place because of the electricity, flesh and water
both conduct.
i tie back the curtain so there will be more light. my mother’s jacket is hanging
on a nail beside the window, there’s nobody in it; i press my forehead against it.
leather smell, the smell of loss; irrecoverable. but i can’t think about that. i lie
down on the bed in my clothes and in a moment the first rain hits the roof. it patters,

p. what i heard was a powerboat,
attacking. it’s almost too late, they were pulling around into the bay and slowing and
nearly to the dock when i woke up. i scramble on hands and knees out of my den,
blanket over me, brown plaid camouflage, and run stooping further back among the
trees and flatten, worming into a thicket, hazel bushes, where i can see.
they may have been sent to hunt for me, perhaps the others asked them to, they
may be the police; or they may be sightseers, curious tourists. evans will have told
at the store, the whole village will know. or the war may have started, the invasion,
they are americans.
they can’t be trusted. they’ll mistake me for a human being, a naked woman
wrapped in a blanket: possibly that’s what they’ve come here for, if it’s running
around loose, ownerless, why not take it. they won’t be able to tell what i really am.
but if they guess my true form, identity, they will shoot me or bludgeon in my skull
and hang me up by the feet from a tre

ter, they chitter and sizzle like a speeded-up tape, the forks and
spoons on the ends of their arms waving excitedly. perhaps they think i drowned
myself, that would be the kind of blunder they would make.
keep quiet i say, i bite into my arm but i can’t hold it back, the laughter extrudes.
it startles me, i stop at once but it’s too late, they’ve heard me. rubber feet stomping
off the dock and bulletproof heads moving towards me, who could they be, david
and joe, claude from the village, evans, malmstrom the spy, the americans, the
humans, they’re here because i wouldn’t sell. i don’t own it, nobody owns it i tell
them, you don’t have to kill me. rabbit’s choices: freeze, take the chance they won’t
see you; then bolt.
i have a good start on them and no shoes. i run silently, dodging branches,
heading for the path to the swamp, the canoe is there, i can easily reach it first. on
the open lake they could cut me off with the motorboat but if i go into the swamp,

untravelled paths. no god and perhaps not real, even that is uncertain; i can’t know
yet, it’s too early. but i assume it: if i die it dies, if i starve it starves with me. it
might be the first one, the first true human; it must be born, allowed.
i’m outside in the garden when the boat comes. it isn’t evans; it’s paul’s boat,
thick and slow and painted white, he built it himself. paul is at the back, beside the
antique motor; in the front is joe.
i go out through the gate and retreat behind the trees, white birches clumped
beside the path, not hurrying, not running away but cautious.
the motor cuts, the nose of the boat bumps the dock. paul stands up with an oar,
pulling in; joe gets out and ropes the boat and takes several steps towards the land.
he calls my name, then pauses, “are you here
