... at some point something must have come from nothing ...
sophie amundsen was on her way home from school. she had walked the first part of
the way with joanna. they had been discussing robots. joanna thought the human
brain was like an advanced computer. sophie was not certain she agreed. surely a
person was more than a piece of hardware?
when they got to the supermarket they went their separate ways. sophie lived on the
outskirts of a sprawling suburb and had almost twice as far to school as joanna. there
were no other houses beyond her garden, which made it seem a

tart her homework.
from time to time there would be a few letters from the bank for her father, but then
he was not a normal father. sophie's father was the captain of a big oil tanker, and was
away for most of the year. during the few weeks at a time when he was at home, he
would shuffle around the house making it nice and cozy for sophie and her mother.
but when he was at sea he could seem very distant.
there was only one letter in the mailbox--and it was for sophie. the white envelope
read: "sophie amundsen, 3 clover close." that was all; it did not say who it was
from. there was no stamp on it either.
as soon as sophie had closed the gate behind her she opened the envelope. it
contained only a slip of paper no bigger than the envelope. it read: who are you?
nothing else, only the three words, written by hand, and followed by a large question
mark.
she looked at the envelope again. the letter was definitely for her. who could have
dropped it in the mailbox?
sophie let herself quickly into the red

he got two budgerigars called smitt and smule,
then govinda the tortoise, and finally the marmalade cat sherekan. they had all been 
given to her to make up for the fact that her mother never got home from work until
late in the afternoon and her father was away so much, sailing all over the world.
sophie slung her schoolbag on the floor and put a bowl of cat food out for sherekan.
then she sat down on a kitchen stool with the mysterious letter in her hand.
who are you?
she had no idea. she was sophie amundsen, of course, but who was that? she had
not really figured that out--yet.
what if she had been given a different name? anne knutsen, for instance. would she
then have been someone else?
she suddenly remembered that dad had originally wanted her to be called lillemor.
sophie tried to imagine herself shaking hands and introducing herself as lillemor
amundsen, but it seemed all wrong. it was someone else who kept introducing
herself.
she jumped up and went into the bathroom with the strange letter i

n her hand. she
stood in front of the mirror and stared into her own eyes.
"i am sophie amundsen," she said.
the girl in the mirror did not react with as much as a twitch. whatever sophie did,
she did exactly the same. sophie tried to beat her reflection to it with a lightning
movement but the other girl was just as fast.
"who are you?" sophie asked.
she received no response to this either, but felt a momentary confusion as to whether
it was she or her reflection who had asked the question.
sophie pressed her index finger to the nose in the mirror and said, "you are me."
as she got no answ

er to this, she turned the sentence around and said, "i am you."
sophie amundsen was often dissatisfied with her appearance. she was frequently told 
that she had beautiful almond-shaped eyes, but that was probably just something
people said because her nose was too small and her mouth was a bit too big. and her
ears were much too close to her eyes. worst of all was her straight hair, which it was
impossible to do anything with. sometimes her father would stroke her hair and call
her "the girl with the flaxen hair," after a piece of music by claude debussy. it was all
right

x. the mailman had just delivered the
day's mail. sophie fished out a bulky pile of junk mail, periodicals, and a couple of
letters for her mother. there was also a postcard of a tropical beach. she turned the
card over. it had a nor-wegian stamp on it and was postmarked "un battalion."
could it be from dad? but wasn't he in a completely different place? it wasn't his
handwriting either.
sophie felt her pulse quicken a little as she saw who the postcard was addressed to:
"hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover close ..." the rest of the address
was correct. the card read:
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday! as i'm sure you'll understand, i want to give you a
present that will help you grow. forgive me for sending the card c/o sophie. it was the
easiest way. love from dad.
sophie raced back to the house and into the kitchen. her mind was in a turmoil. who
was this "hilde," whose fifteenth birthday was just a month before her own?
sophie got out the telephone book. there were a lot of people cal

could she be sure of that?

... the "fortune-teller" is trying to foresee something that is really quite
unforeseeable ...
sophie had been keeping her eye on the mailbox while she read about democritus.
but just in case, she decided nevertheless to take a stroll down to the garden gate.
when she opened the front door she saw a small envelope on the front step. and sure
enough--it was addressed to sophie amundsen.
so he had tricked her! today of all days, when she had kept such careful watch on the
mailbox, the mystery man had sneaked up to the house from a different angle and just
laid the letter on the step before making off into the woods again. drat!
how did he know that sophie was watching the mailbox today? had he seen her at
the window? anyway, she was glad to find the letter before her mother arrived.
sophie went back to her room and opened the letter. the white envelope was a bit wet

at the bottom of the page she wrote rsvp.
sophie felt that the letter had turned out much too formal. but it was hard to know
which words to choose when writing to a person without a face. she put the letter in a
pink envelope and addressed it "to the philosopher."
the problem was where to put it so her mother didn't find it. she would have to wait
for her to get home before putting it in the mailbox. and she would also have to
remember to look in the mailbox early the next morning be

 in the world.
when we discern things, we classify them in various groups or categories. i see a
horse, then i see another horse, and another. the horses are not exactly alike, but they
have something in common, and this common something is the horse's "form."
whatever might be distinctive, or individual, belongs to the horse's "substance."
so we go around pigeonholing everything. we put cows in cowsheds, horses in
stables, pigs in pigsties, and chickens in chicken coops. the same happens when 
sophie amundsen tidies up her room. she puts her books on the bookshelf, her
schoolbooks in her schoolbag, and her magazines in the drawer. then she folds her
clothes neatly and puts them in the closet--underwear on one shelf, sweaters on
another, and socks in a drawer on their own. notice that we do the same thing in our
minds. we distinguish between things made of stone, things made of wool, and things
made of rubber. we distinguish between things that are alive or dead, and we
distinguish between vegetable,

eacher had begun sending his letters directly to the old
hedge, sophie nevertheless looked in the mailbox on monday morning, more out of
habit than anything else.
it was empty, not surprisingly. she began to walk down clover close.
suddenly she noticed a photograph lying on the sidewalk. it was a picture of a white
jeep and a blue flag with the letters un on it. wasn't that the united nations flag?
sophie turned the picture over and saw that it was a regular postcard. to "hilde
moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen ..." it had a norwegian stamp and was
postmarked "un battalion" friday june 15, 1990.
june 15! that was sofie's birthday!
the card read:
dear hilde, i assume you are still celebrating your 15th birthday. or is this the
morning after? anyway, it makes no difference to your present. in a sense, that will
last a lifetime. but i'd like to wish you a happy birthday one more time. perhaps you
understand now why i send the cards to sophie. i am sure she will pass them on to
you.

now you might feel that it cannot be particularly pleasant to "lose oneself." i know
what you mean. but the point is that what you lose is so very much less than what you
gain. you lose yourself only in the form you have at the moment, but at the same time
you realize that you are something much bigger. you are the universe. in fact, you are
the cosmic spirit itself, sophie. it is you who are god. if you have to lose yourself as
sophie amundsen, you can take comfort in the knowledge that this "everyday i" is
something you will lose one day anyway. your real "i"-- which you can only
experience if you are able to lose yourself--is, according to the mystics, like a
mysterious fire that goes on burning to all eternity.
but a mystical experience like this does not always come of itself. the mystic may
have to seek the path of "purification and enlightenment" to his meeting with god.
this path consists of the simple life and various meditat

had just
admitted she had been here before. it couldn't do any harm if she let her friend in on
the mysterious things she had experienced during the last few days.
"i didn't want to tell you before we were here."
joanna began to read the cards.
"they are all addressed to someone called hilde moller knag."
sophie had not touched the cards yet.
"what address?"
joanna read: "hilde moller knag, c/o alberto knox, lillesand, norway."
sophie breathed a sigh of relief. she was afraid they would say c/o sophie amundsen.
she began to inspect them more closely.
"april 28 ... may 4 ... may 6 ... may 9 ... they were stamped a few days ago."
"but there's something else. all the postmarks are norwegian! look at that... un
battalion ... the stamps are norwegian too!"
"i think that's the way they do it. they have to be sort of neutral, so they have their
own norwegian post office down there."
"but how do they get the mail home?"
"the air force, probably."
sophie put the candlestick on the floor, and the two friends b

as soon as she had set the casserole on the stove again, the telephone rang.
suppose it was dad! she wished desperately that he would come home so she could
tell him everything that had happened in these last weeks. but it was probably only
joanna or mom. sophie snatched up the phone.
"sophie amundsen," she said.
 "it's me," said a voice.
sophie was sure of three things: it was not her father. but it was a man's voice, and a
voice she knew she had heard before. 
"who is this?"
"it's alberto."
"ohhh!"
sophie was at a loss for words. it was the voice from the acropolis video that she had
recognized.
"are you all right?"
"sure."
"from now on there will be no more letters."
"but i didn't send you a frog!"
"we must meet in person. it's beginning to be urgent, you see."
"why?"

alberto switched the computer on and soon the screen showed c: at the top. he wrote
"laila," explaining that this was an advanced conversation program.
a text soon appeared at the top of the screen:
"hi, my name is laila. are you sitting comfortably?"
sophie entered three letters:
"yes," she wrote although she had not yet sat down. alberto brought up a chair for
her. 
"what is your name?" appeared on the screen.
"sophie amundsen," wrote sophie, and the computer answered:
"3 clover close. nice to meet you, sophie. are you looking forward to your fifteenth
birthday?"
sophie was startled. alberto laid a hand on her shoulder and said: "i have only given
her your name, your address, and your date of birth. it's like when you are going to be
introduced to a new friend. it's nice to know a little about them beforehand."
"not bad," wrote sophie.
"oh dear, i hope you are not feeling bad, sophie. you must try to talk in whole

mood the next. spinoza maintained that all material things and things that happen
around us are an expression of god or nature. so it follows that all thoughts that we
think are also god's or nature's thoughts. for everything is one. there is only one
god, one nature, or one substance."
"but listen, when i think something, i'm the one who's doing the thinking. when i
move, i'm doing the moving. why do you have to mix god into it?"
"i like your involvement. but who are you? you are sophie amundsen, but you are
also the expression of something infinitely bigger. you can, if you wish, say that you
are thinking or that you are moving, but could you not also say that it is nature that is
thinking your thoughts, or that it is nature that is moving through you? it's really just a
question of which lenses you choose to look through."
"are you saying i cannot decide for myself?"

"i guess not."
"when does the child get its free will, then? at the age of two, she runs around and
points at everything in sight. at the age of three she nags her mother, and at the age of
four she suddenly gets afraid of the dark. where's the freedom, sophie?" 
"i don't know."
"when she is fifteen, she sits in front of a mirror experimenting with makeup. is this
the moment when she makes her own personal decisions and does what she likes?"
"i see what you're getting at."
"she is sophie amundsen, certainly. but she also lives according to the laws of nature.
the point is that she doesn't realize it because there are so many complex reasons for
everything she does."
"i don't think i want to hear any more."
"but you must just answer a last question. two equally old trees are growing in a
large garden. one of the trees grows in a sunny spot and has plenty of good soil and
water. the other tree grows in poor soil in a dark spot. which of the trees do you think

to lebanon.
had he written a whole book for her?
on the first page, in large handwritten letters, was the title, sophie's world. 
farther down the page there were two typewritten lines of poetry:
true enlightenment is to man like sunlight to the soil
--n.f.s. grundtvig
hilde turned to the next page, to the beginning of the first chapter. it was entitled "the
garden of eden." she got into bed, sat up comfortably, resting the ring binder against
her knees, and began to read.
sophie amundsen was on her way home from school. she had walked the first part of
the way with joanna. they had been discussing robots. joanna thought the human
brain was like an advanced computer. sophie was not certain she agreed. surely a
person was more than a piece of hardware?
hilde read on, oblivious of all else, even forgetting that it was her birthday. from time
to time a brief thought crept in between the lines as she read: had dad written a book?
had he finally begun on the significant novel and com

sophie's father was far from home, too. she was probably the girl hilde would be
getting to know ...
only by conjuring up an intense feeling of one day being dead could she appreciate
how terribly good life was... . where does the world come from? ... at some point
something must have come from nothing. but was that possible? wasn't that just as
impossible as the idea that the world had always existed?
hilde read on and on. with surprise, she read about sophie amundsen receiving a
postcard from lebanon: "hilde moller knag, c/o sophie amundsen, 3 clover
close..."
dear hilde, happy 15th birthday. as i'm sure you'll understand, i want to give you a
present that will help you grow. forgive me for sending the card c/o sophie. it was the
easiest way. love from dad.
the joker! hilde knew her father had always been a sly one, but today he had really
taken her by surprise! instead of tying the card on the package, he had written it into 
the book.

"what about you? you said: what's happening to us, little one?"
"i was thinking of you running around town to meet some mysterious person ...
maybe it's my fault." "it's not anybody's 'fault' that i'm taking a course in philosophy
in my leisure time. just go to work. school doesn't start till ten, and we're only getting
our grades and sitting around."
"do you know what you're going to get?" "more than i got last semester at any rate."
not long after her mother had gone the telephone rang.
"sophie amundsen."
"this is alberto."
"ah."
"the major didn't spare any ammunition last night."
"what do you mean."
"the thunderstorm, sophie."
"i don't know what to think."
"that is the finest virtue a genuine philosopher can have. i am proud of how much
you have learned in such a short time."

new consciousness."

 was her birthday. her
classmates were already keyed up by thoughts of summer vacation, and grades, and
the sodas on the last day of school. the minute the teacher dismissed the class with
her best wishes for the vacation, sophie ran home. joanna tried to slow her down but
sophie called over her shoulder that there was something she just had to do.
in the mailbox she found two cards from lebanon. they were both birthday cards:
happy birthday--15 years. one of them was to "hilde m0ller knag, c/o
sophie amundsen . . ." but the other one was to sophie herself. both cards were
stamped "un battalion--june 15."
sophie read her own card first:
dear sophie amundsen, today you are getting a card as well. happy birthday, sophie,
and many thanks for everything you have done for hilde. best regards, major albert
knag.
sophie was not sure how to react, now that hilde's father had finally written to her too.
hilde's card read:
dear hilde, i have no idea what day or time it is in lillesand. but, as i said, it doesn

the two girls went downstairs to their parents, who were now talking somewhat more
freely. sophie handed the draft invitation, written with a calligraphic pen, to her 
mother.
"could you make eighteen copies, please." it was not the first time she had asked her
mother to make photocopies for her at work.
her mother read the invitation and then handed it to joanna's father.
"you see what i mean? she is going a little crazy."
"but it looks really exciting," said joanna's father, handing

oo,
sophie?"
"let's say twenty copies, then," said sophie, taking them at their word.
"you must be nuts!" said joanna.
before sophie went to bed that night she stood for a long time gazing out of the
window. she remembered how she had once seen the outline of alberto's figure in the
darkness. it was more than a month ago. now it was again late at night, but this was a
white summer night.
sophie heard nothing from alberto until tuesday morning. he called just after her
mother had left for work.
"sophie amundsen."
"and alberto knox."
"i thought so."
"i'm sorry i didn't call before, but i've been working hard on our plan. i can only be
alone and work undisturbed when the major is concentrating wholly and com-pletely
on you."
 "that's weird." 
"then i seize the opportunity to conceal myself, you see. the best surveillance system
in the world has its limitations when it is only controlled by one single person ... i got

"dare you risk it?"

maybe the major is also a shadow in a book about him and hilde, which is also about
us, since we are a part of their lives."
"that would be even worse. that makes us only shadows of shadows."
"but it is possible that a completely different author is somewhere writing a book
about a un major albert knag, who is writing a book for his daughter hilde. this
book is about a certain alberto knox who suddenly begins to send humble
philosophical lectures to sophie amundsen, 3 clover close."
"do you believe that?"
"i'm just saying it's possible. to us, that author would be a 'hidden god.' although
everything we are and everything we say and do proceeds from him, because we are
him we will never be able to know anything about him. we are in the innermost box."
alberto and sophie now sat for a long time without saying anything. it was sophie
who finally broke the silence: "but if there really is an author who is writing a story
about hilde's father in lebanon, just

but
each tiny ant moved its legs in its own particular manner.
the most curious of all was the sight that met her eyes when she stood up again and
looked at alberto, still standing on the front step of the cabin. in alberto she now saw
a wondrous person--he was like a being from another planet, or an enchanted figure
out of a fairy tale. at the same time she experienced herself in a completely new way
as a unique individual. she was more than just a human being, a fifteen-year-old girl.
she was sophie amundsen, and only she was that.
"what do you see?" asked alberto.
"i see that you're a strange bird."
"you think so?"
"i don't think i'll ever get to understand what it's like being another person. no two
people in the whole world are alike."
"and the woods?"
"they don't seem the same any more. they're like a whole universe of wondrous
tales."

kierkegaard's reaction to the idealism of the romantics. but it also encompas
