    let dying mortimer here rest himself.
    even like a man new haled from the rack,
    so fare my limbs with long imprisonment;
    and these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
    nestor-like aged in an age of care,
    argue the end of edmund mortimer.
    these eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
    wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
    weak shoulders, overborne with burdening

    that droops his sapless branches to the ground.
    yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
    unable to support this lump of clay,
    swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
    as witting i no other comfort have.
    but tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?

    poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
    since henry monmouth first began to reign,
    before whose glory i was great in arms,
    this loathsome sequestration have i had;
    and even since then hath richard been obscur'd,
    depriv'd of honour and inheritance.

    and now declare, sweet stem from york's great stock,
    why didst thou say of late thou wert despis'd?
  plantagenet. first, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
    and, in that ease, i'll tell thee my disease.

    and did upbraid me with my father's death;
    which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
    else with the like i had requited him.
    therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
    in honour of a true plantagenet,
    and for alliance sake, declare the cause
    my father, earl of cambridge, lost his head.
  mortimer. that cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me
    and hath detain'd me all my flow'ring youth
    within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
    was cursed instrument of his decease.
  plantagenet. discover more at large what cause that was,

rightful heir,
    i lost my liberty, and they their lives.
    long after this, when henry the fifth,
    succeeding his father bolingbroke, did reign,
    thy father, earl of cambridge, then deriv'd
    from famous edmund langley, duke of york,
    marrying my sister, that thy mother was,
    again, in pity of my hard distress,
    levied an army, weening to redeem
    and have install'd me in the diadem;
    but, as the rest, so fell that noble earl,
    and was beheaded. thus the mortimers,
    in whom the title rested, were suppress'd.
  plantagenet. of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
  mortimer. true; and thou seest that i no issue have,
    and that my fainting words do warrant death.
    thou art my heir; the rest i wish thee gather;
    but yet be wary in thy studious care.
  plantagenet. thy grave admonishments prevail with me.
    but yet methinks my father's execution
    was nothing less than bloody tyranny.

    as princes do their courts when they are cloy'd
    with long continuance in a settled place.
  plantagenet. o uncle, would some part of my young years
    might but redeem the passage of your age!
  mortimer. thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer
    doth
    which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
    mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
    only give order for my funeral.
    and so, farewell; and fair be all thy hopes,
    and prosperous be thy life in peace and war!          [dies]
