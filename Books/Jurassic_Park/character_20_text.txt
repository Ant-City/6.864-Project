ind. guitierrez himself would write the preliminary report, but
the remains would have to be sent back to the united states for final positive identification, of
course. to whom should he send it? the acknowledged expert was edward h. simpson,
emeritus professor of zoology at columbia university, in new york. an elegant older man with
swept-back white hair, simpson was the world's leading authority on lizard taxonomy. probably,
marty thought, he would send his lizard to dr. simpson.

dr. richard stone, head of the tropical diseases laboratory of columbia university medical
center, often remarked that the name conjured up a grander place than it actually was. in the
early twentieth century, when the laboratory occupied the entire fourth floor of the biomedical
research building, crews of technicians worked to eliminate the scourges of yellow fever,
malaria, and cholera. but medical successes-and research laboratories in nairobi and sao
paulo-had left the tdl a much less important place than i

's a question of communicable disease with this lizard, she asked our lab to take a
took at it. let's see what we've got."
the white plastic cylinder was the size of a half-gallon milk container, it had locking metal
latches and a screw top. it was labeled "international biological specimen container" and
plastered with stickers and warnings in four languages. the warnings were intended to keep the
cylinder from being opened by suspicious customs officials.
apparently the warnings had worked; as richard stone swung the big light over, he could see
the seals were still intact. stone turned on the air handlers and pulled on plastic gloves and a
face mask. after all, the lab had recently identified specimens contaminated with venezuelan
equine fever, japanese b encephalitis, kyasanur forest virus, langat virus, and mayaro. then
he unscrewed the top.
there was the hiss of escaping gas, and white smoke boiled out. the cylinder turned frosty
cold. inside he found a plastic zip-lock sandwich bag, containin

the lizard fragment rested in the freezer at columbia university, awaiting the return of dr.
simpson, who was not expected for at least a month. and so things might have remained, had
not a technician named alice levin walked into the tropical diseases laboratory, seen tina
bowman's picture, and said, "oh, whose kid drew the dinosaur?"
"what?" richard stone said, turning slowly toward her.
"the dinosaur. isn't that what it is? my kid draws them all the time."
"this is a lizard," stone said. "from costa rica. some girl down there drew a picture of it."
"no," alice levin said, shaking her head. "look at it. it's very clear. big head, long neck, stands
on its hind legs, thick tail. it's a dinosaur."
"it can't be. it was only a foot tall."
"so? there were little dinosaurs back then," alice said. "believe me, i know. i have two boys,
i'm an expert. the

"you don't understand," richard stone said. "this is a picture of a contemporary animal. they
sent us a fragment of the animal. it's in the freezer now." stone went and got it, and shook it out of
the baggie.
alice levin looked at the frozen piece of leg and tail, and shrugged. she didn't touch it. "i don't
know," she said. "but that looks like a dinosaur to me."
stone shook his head. "impossible."
"why?" alice levin said. "it could be a leftover or a remnant or whatever they call them."
stone continued to shake his head. alice was

remembered the time when she thought she was being followed by one of the surgical orderlies. . ..
"you know," alice levin said, "if this is a dinosaur, richard, it could be a big deal."
"it's not a dinosaur."
"has anybody checked it. "no,"
stone said.
"well, take it to the museum of natural history or something," alice levin said. "you really
should."
"i'd be embarrassed."
"you want me to do it for you?" she said.
"no," richard stone said. "i don't."
"you're not going to do anything?"
"nothing at all." he put the baggie back in the freezer and slammed the door. "it's not a
dinosaur, it's a lizard. and whatever it is, it can wait until dr. simpson gets back from borneo to
identify it. that's final, alice. this lizard's not going anywhere."
