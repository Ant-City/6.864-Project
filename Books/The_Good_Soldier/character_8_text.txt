ut she drove with efficiency and precision; she smiled at the gimmers
and ffoulkes and the hedley seatons. she threw with exactitude pennies
to the boys who opened gates for her; she sat upright on the seat of the
high dog-cart; she waved her hands to edward and nancy as they rode off
with the hounds, and every one could hear her clear, high voice, in the
chilly weather, saying: "have a good time!"

poor forlorn woman!...

there was, however, one spark of consolation. it came from the fact that
rodney bayham, of bayham, followed her always with his eyes. it had been
three years since she had tried her abortive love-affair with him. yet
still, on the winter mornings he would ride up to her shafts and just
say: "good day," and look at her with eyes that were not imploring,
but seemed to say: "you see, i am still, as the germans say, a. d.--at
disposition."

it was a great consolation, not because she proposed ever to take him
up again, but because it showed her that there was in the world one

l soul in riding-breeches. and it showed her that she was not
losing her looks.

and, indeed, she was not losing her looks. she was forty, but she was as
clean run as on the day she had left the convent--as clear in outline,
as clear coloured in the hair, as dark blue in the eyes. she thought
that her looking-glass told her this; but there are always the
doubts.... rodney bayham's eyes took them away.

it is very singular that leonora should not have aged at all. i suppose
that there are some types of beauty and even of youth made for the
embellishments that come with enduring sorrow. that is too elaborately
put. i mean that leonora, if everything had prospered, might have
become too hard and, maybe, overbearing. as it was she was tuned down
to appearing efficient--and yet sympathetic. that is the rarest of all
blends. and yet i swear that leonora, in her restrained wa

asingly, my mind going round and round in a weary, baffled
space of pain--what should these people have done? what, in the name of
god, should they have done?

the end was perfectly plain to each of them--it was perfectly manifest
at this stage that, if the girl did not, in leonora's phrase, "belong to
edward," edward must die, the girl must lose her reason because edward
died--and, that after a time, leonora, who was the coldest and the
strongest of the three, would console herself by marrying rodney bayham
and have a quiet, comfortable, good time. that end, on that night,
whilst leonora sat in the girl's bedroom and edward telephoned down
below--that end was plainly manifest. the girl, plainly, was half-mad
already; edward was half dead; only leonora, active, persistent,
instinct with her cold passion of energy, was "doing things". what then,
should they have done? worked out in the extinction of two very splendid
personalities--for edward and the girl were splendid personalities, in
order that a

g the words "until
my arrival", which i see end that paragraph, i have seen again for a
glimpse, from a swift train, beaucaire with the beautiful white tower,
tarascon with the square castle, the great rhone, the immense stretches
of the crau. i have rushed through all provence--and all provence no
longer matters. it is no longer in the olive hills that i shall find my
heaven; because there is only hell... .

edward is dead; the girl is gone--oh, utterly gone; leonora is having
a good time with rodney bayham, and i sit alone in branshaw teleragh. i
have been through provence; i have seen africa; i have visited asia to
see, in ceylon, in a darkened room, my poor girl, sitting motionless,
with her wonderful hair about her, looking at me with eyes that did
not see me, and saying distinctly: "credo in unum deum omnipotentem....
credo in unum deum omnipotentem." those are the only reasonable words
she uttered; those are the only words, it appears, that she ever
will utter. i suppose that they are reason

were ever sufficiently restored to let her appreciate the meaning of the
anglican marriage service. but it is probable that her reason will
never be sufficiently restored to let her appreciate the meaning of the
anglican marriage service. therefore i cannot marry her, according to
the law of the land.

so here i am very much where i started thirteen years ago. i am the
attendant, not the husband, of a beautiful girl, who pays no attention
to me. i am estranged from leonora, who married rodney bayham in my
absence and went to live at bayham. leonora rather dislikes me, because
she has got it into her head that i disapprove of her marriage with
rodney bayham. well, i disapprove of her marriage. possibly i am
jealous. yes, no doubt i am jealous. in my fainter sort of way i seem to
perceive myself following the lines of edward ashburnham. i suppose that
i should really like to be a polygamist; with nancy, and with leonora,
and with maisie maidan and possibly even with florence. i am no doubt

ike every other man; only, probably because of my american origin i am
fainter. at the same time i am able to assure you that i am a strictly
respectable person. i have never done anything that the most anxious
mother of a daughter or the most careful dean of a cathedral would
object to. i have only followed, faintly, and in my unconscious desires,
edward ashburnham. well, it is all over. not one of us has got what he
really wanted. leonora wanted edward, and she has got rodney bayham, a
pleasant enough sort of sheep. florence wanted branshaw, and it is i
who have bought it from leonora. i didn't really want it; what i
wanted mostly was to cease being a nurse-attendant. well, i am a
nurse-attendant. edward wanted nancy rufford, and i have got her. only
she is mad. it is a queer and fantastic world. why can't people have
what they want? the things were all there to content everybody; yet
everybody has the wrong thing. perhaps you can make head or tail of it;
it is beyond me.

type; for the extinction of
proud, resolute and unusual individuals.

edward was the normal man, but there was too much of the sentimentalist
about him; and society does not need too many sentimentalists. nancy was
a splendid creature, but she had about her a touch of madness. society
does not need individuals with touches of madness about them. so edward
and nancy found themselves steamrolled out and leonora survives, the
perfectly normal type, married to a man who is rather like a rabbit.
for rodney bayham is rather like a rabbit, and i hear that leonora is
expected to have a baby in three months' time.

so those splendid and tumultuous creatures with their magnetism and
their passions--those two that i really loved--have gone from this
earth. it is no doubt best for them. what would nancy have made of
edward if she had succeeded in living with him; what would edward have
made of her? for there was about nancy a touch of cruelty--a touch of
definite actual cruelty that made her desire to see peop

obviously edward and the girl were villains--have been punished by
suicide and madness. the heroine--the perfectly normal, virtuous and
slightly deceitful heroine--has become the happy wife of a perfectly
normal, virtuous and slightly deceitful husband. she will shortly become
a mother of a perfectly normal, virtuous slightly deceitful son or
daughter. a happy ending, that is what it works out at.

i cannot conceal from myself the fact that i now dislike leonora.
without doubt i am jealous of rodney bayham. but i don't know whether
it is merely a jealousy arising from the fact that i desired myself to
possess leonora or whether it is because to her were sacrificed the only
two persons that i have ever really loved--edward ashburnham and nancy
rufford. in order to set her up in a modern mansion, replete with
every convenience and dominated by a quite respectable and eminently
economical master of the house, it was necessary that edward and nancy
rufford should become, for me at least, no more than
