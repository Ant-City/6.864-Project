   pain. i am glad y'are well

   poet. i haue not seene you long, how goes
the world?
  pain. it weares sir, as it growes

   poet. i that's well knowne:
but what particular rarity? what strange,
which manifold record not matches: see
magicke of bounty, all these spirits thy power
hath coniur'd to attend.
i know the merchant

   tim. thou art proud apemantus?
  ape. of nothing so much, as that i am not like timon
  tim. whether art going?

   ape. right, if doing nothing be death by th' law

   tim. how lik'st thou this picture apemantus?
  ape. the best, for the innocence

   tim. wrought he not well that painted it

   ape. he wrought better that made the painter, and
yet he's but a filthy peece of worke

   pain. y'are a dogge

   ape. thy mothers of my generation: what's she, if i
be a dogge?
  tim. wilt dine with me apemantus?
  ape. no: i eate not lords

   tim. and thou should'st, thoud'st anger ladies

   ape. o they eate lords;
so they come by great bellies

   tim. that's a lasciuious apprehension

   ape. so, thou apprehend'st it,
take it for thy labour

   tim. how dost thou like this iewell, apemantus?

 were iurors on thy
life. all thy safety were remotion, and thy defence absence.
what beast could'st thou bee, that were not subiect
to a beast: and what a beast art thou already, that
seest not thy losse in transformation

   ape. if thou could'st please me
with speaking to me, thou might'st
haue hit vpon it heere.
the commonwealth of athens, is become
a forrest of beasts

   tim. how ha's the asse broke the wall, that thou art
out of the citie

   ape. yonder comes a poet and a painter:
the plague of company light vpon thee:
i will feare to catch it, and giue way.
when i know not what else to do,
ile see thee againe

   tim. when there is nothing liuing but thee,
thou shalt be welcome.
i had rather be a beggers dogge,
then apemantus

   ape. thou art the cap
of all the fooles aliue

   tim. would thou wert cleane enough
to spit vpon

   ape. a plague on thee,
thou art too bad to curse

   tim. all villaines
that do stand by thee, are pure

y to none,
but let the famisht flesh slide from the bone,
ere thou releeue the begger. giue to dogges
what thou denyest to men. let prisons swallow 'em,
debts wither 'em to nothing, be men like blasted woods
and may diseases licke vp their false bloods,
and so farewell, and thriue

   stew. o let me stay, and comfort you, my master

   tim. if thou hat'st curses
stay not: flye, whil'st thou art blest and free:
ne're see thou man, and let me ne're see thee.

  pain. as i tooke note of the place, it cannot be farre
where he abides

   poet. what's to be thought of him?
does the rumor hold for true,
that hee's so full of gold?
  painter. certaine.
alcibiades reports it: phrinica and timandylo
had gold of him. he likewise enrich'd
poore stragling souldiers, with great quantity.
'tis saide, he gaue vnto his steward
a mighty summe

   poet. then this breaking of his,
ha's beene but a try for his friends?
  painter. nothing else:

shall see him a palme in athens againe,
and flourish with the highest:
therefore, 'tis not amisse, we tender our loues
to him, in this suppos'd distresse of his:
it will shew honestly in vs,
and is very likely, to loade our purposes
with what they trauaile for,
if it be a iust and true report, that goes
of his hauing

   poet. what haue you now
to present vnto him?
  painter. nothing at this time
but my visitation: onely i will promise him
an excellent peece

   poet. i must serue him so too;
tell him of an intent that's comming toward him

   painter. good as the best.
promising, is the verie ayre o'th' time;
it opens the eyes of expectation.
performance, is euer the duller for his acte,
and but in the plainer and simpler kinde of people,
the deede of saying is quite out of vse.
to promise, is most courtly and fashionable;
performance, is a kinde of

 i am thinking
what i shall say i haue prouided for him:
it must be a personating of himselfe:
a satyre against the softnesse of prosperity,
with a discouerie of the infinite flatteries
that follow youth and opulencie

   timon. must thou needes
stand for a villaine in thine owne worke?
wilt thou whip thine owne faults in other men?
do so, i haue gold for thee

   poet. nay let's seeke him.
then do we sinne against our owne estate,
when we may profit meete, and come too late

   painter. true:
when the day serues before blacke-corner'd night;
finde what thou want'st, by free and offer'd light.
come

   tim. ile meete you at the turne:
what a gods gold, that he is worshipt
in a baser temple, then where swine feede?
'tis thou that rigg'st the barke, and plow'st the fome,
setlest admired reuerence in a slaue,
to thee be worshipt, and thy saints for aye:
be crown'd with plagues, that thee alone obay.
fit i meet them
