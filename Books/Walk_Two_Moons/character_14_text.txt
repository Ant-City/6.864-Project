 - or at least i did not think i was ready -
to talk about her.

   gramps said, 'well, then, what about your friends? you got any tales to
tell about them?'

   instantly, phoebe winterbottom came to mind. there was certainly a hog's
bellyful of things to tell about her. 'i could tell you an extensively strange
story,' i warned.

   'oh, good!' gram said. 'delicious!' and that is how i happened to suspend
my tree prayers and tell them about phoebe winterbottom, her disappearing
mother, and the lunatic. it is also how i discovered that beneath phoebe's
story was another story.


3. bravery


   because i first saw phoebe on the day my father and i moved to euclid, i
began my story of phoebe with the visit to the red-headed margaret
cadaver's where i also met mrs.. partridge, her elderly mother. margaret
nearly fell over herself being nice to me. 'what lovely hair,' she said, and

'aren't you sweet!' i was not sweet that day. i was being particularly ornery.
i wouldn't sit down and i wouldn't

smooshed them just because they happened to stray into someone else's
room.

   i suppose that just because i was not afraid of these little creatures, people
thought i was brave. i suppose they didn't know how i felt about cars,
cancer, nuclear war and all those other things. what i have since realized is
that if people expect you to be brave, sometimes you pretend that you are,
even when you are frightened down to your very bones. but this was later,
during the whole thing with phoebe's lunatic, that i realized this.


   at this point in my story, gram interrupted me to say, 'why, salamanca, of
course you're brave. all the hiddles are brave. it's a family trait. look at
your daddy - your momma-'

   'my momma is not a real hiddle,' i said.

   'she practically is,' gram said. 'you can't be married to a hiddle that long
and not become a hiddle.' that is not what my mother used to say. she
would tell my father, 'you hiddles are a mystery to me. i'll never be a true
hiddle.' she did no

she does for a living - what her job is?'

   'yes.` i was pleased to say. i was pleased to know something. 'she's a
nurse.

   'exactly.' phoebe said. 'would you want a nurse whose name meant dead
body? and that hair. don't you think all that sticking-out red hair is spooky?
and that voice. it reminds me of dead leaves all blowing around on the
ground.'

   this was phoebe's power. in her world, no one was ordinary. people were
either perfect - like her father - or, more often, they were weird lunatics or
axe murderers she could convince me of just about any- thing - especially
about margaret cadaver. from that day on, margaret cadaver's hair did look
spooky and her voice did sound exactly like dead leaves. somehow it was
easier to deal with margaret if there were reasons not to like her, and i
definitely did not want to like her.


   'do you want to know an absolute secret?' phoebe said. (i did.) 'promise
not to tell.' (i promised.) 'maybe i shouldn't,' she said. 'your father goes over

intend to stop too much until we reached south dakota.

   he was really looking forward to south dakota. 'we're gonna see the
badlands,' he said. 'we're gonna see the black hills.'

   i didn't like the sound of either of those places, but i knew why we were
going there. my mother had been there. the bus that she took out to
lewiston stopped in all the tourist spots. now we were following along in
her footsteps.


8. the lunatic


   once we were well on the road out of ill-ah-no-way, gram said, 'go on
with peeby. what happened next?'

   'do you want to hear about the lunatic?'


   'goodness!' gram said. 'as long as it's not too bloody. that peeby is just
like gloria. i swear. a "lunatic". imagine.'

   gramps said, 'did gloria really have a hankering for me?'

   'maybe she did, and maybe she didn't,' gram said.

   'well, gol-dang, i was only asking--'

young man was wearing a black t-shirt and blue jeans, and his hands were
stuffed into his pockets. he seemed nervous

   'my mother hates it when strangers come to the door,' phoebe said. 'she is
convinced that any day one of them will burst into the house and start
waving a gun around and turn out to be an escaped lunatic.'


   'oh, honestly, phoebe,' i said. 'do you want me to answer the door?'

   phoebe took a deep breath. 'we'll do it together. she opened the door and
said hello in a cool voice to indicate, i think, that she wasn't someone who
could be fooled easily by strangers.

   'is this 49 grey street?' the young man said.

   since phoebe's street had four signs indicating that this was grey street,
and since phoebe's house had rather large and prominent black numbers (49)

s kept falling over.

   phoebe said to me, 'i wonder if mary lou is embarrassed because of the
way her parents are acting.'

   i didn't think it was embarrassing. i thought it was nice, but i didn't say so
to phoebe. i think that deep down phoebe thought it was nice too, and she
wished her own parents would act more like the finneys. she couldn't admit
this though and, in a way, i liked this about phoebe - that she tried to defend
her family.

   on the day that phoebe and i met the potential lunatic and then went over
to mary lou's, a couple of other peculiar things happened. we were sitting
on the floor of mary lou's room, sorting through a huge pile of old shoes
and crumpled belts. phoebe was telling mary lou about the mysterious
potential lunatic. mary lou's brothers, dennis, doug and tommy, kept
dashing in and out of the room, jumping over the pile of shoes and belts and
leaping on the bed and squirting us with squirt guns.

   mary lou's cousin ben was lying on her bed, staring at me

 i said. i was thinking of something my father once said to
my mother: 'we'll fill the house up with children! we'll fill it right up to the
brim!' but they hadn't filled it up. it was just me and them, and then it was
just me and my father.

   when we got back to phoebe's house, her mother was lying on the couch,
dabbing at her eyes with a tissue.

   'is something wrong?' phoebe asked.

   'oh, no,' mrs. winterbottom said. 'nothing's wrong.

   then phoebe told her mother about the potential lunatic who had come to
the house earlier. this news upset mrs. winterbottom. she wanted to know
exactly what he said and what phoebe said and what he looked like and how
he acted and how phoebe acted, on and on. at last, mrs. winterbottom said,
'i think we had better not mention this to your father.' she reached forward
as if to hug phoebe, but phoebe pulled away.

   later, phoebe said, 'that's odd. usually my mother tells my father
absolutely everything, and i mean every- thing, including what the m

   'but, how do you know that?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   'i just know it,' prudence said.

   'phoebe?' mrs. winterbottom asked. 'is it for you?'

   'for me?' phoebe said, 'i don't think so,

   'well. who is it for?' mrs. winterbottom said.

   prudence looked at her father who looked phoebe, who looked at me and i

   'we honestly can't say' phoebe said.

   mrs. winterbottom looked extensively worried. i believe she thought it
came from the potential lunatic looked at mrs.


10. huzza, huzza


   i had just finished telling gram and gramps about the mysterious message
when gramps pulled off the freeway. he said he was tired of chewing up the
road and besides, the little white lines down the middle of the highway were
starting to wiggle. as he drove into madison, wisconsin, gram said, 'i feel a
little sorry for mrs. winterbottom. she doesn't sound very happy.

   'they all sound a little screwy, if you ask me, gramps said.

s that i was not going to fall. i could smell that funny grapefruit
smell again and feel his face pressed up against my hair.

   'let go,' i said, but he didn't let go. i had an odd sensation, as if a little
creature was crawling up my spine. it wasn't a horrible sensation, more light

and tickly. i thought maybe he dropped something down my shirt. 'let go!' i
said, and finally he did.

   it was at the drug store that i got a little scared. i suppose i had been
listening to phoebe's tales of lunatics and axe murderers too much. phoebe
and i were looking at the magazines, when i felt as if someone was watching
us. i looked over to where ben was standing, but he and mary lou were
busy rummaging around in the chocolate bars. the feeling did not go away. i
turned the other way around, and there on the far side of the store was the
nervous young man who had come to phoebe's house. he was at the cash
register, paying for something, but he was staring at us while he was handing
his money to the c

   'oh, no,' she said, 'the lunatic.'

   she hustled over to ben and mary lou. 'look, quick,' phoebe said. 'it's the
lunatic.

   'where?'

   'at the cash register.'

   ''there's nobody there,' mary lou said.

   'honest, he was there,' phoebe said. 'i swear he was. ask sal.

   'he was there,' i said.

   all the way back to mary lou's house, we kept turning around and
glancing over our shoulders, but there was no sign of the lunatic. we stayed
at mary lou's for a little longer before we started back to phoebe's house.
we were only about a block away when we heard someone running up
behind us

   phoebe thought we were doomed. 'if we get our heads bashed in and he
leaves us here on the sidewalk--' she said.

   i felt a hand on my shoulder and i opened my mouth to scream, but
nothing came out. my brain was saying, 'scream! scream!' but my voice was
completely shut off.


   it was ben. he said, 'did i scare you?'

 wasn't very funny,' phoebe said.

   'i'll walk home with you,' he said. 'just in case there are any - any - lunatics
around.' he had difficulty saying the word 'lunatic'.

   on the way to phoebe's house ben said some odd things. first, he said.
'maybe you shouldn't call him a lunatic.

   'and why not?' phoebe said.

   'because a lunatic is - it means - it sounds like oh, never mind.' he would
not explain, and he seemed embarrassed to have mentioned this in the first
place. then he said to me. 'don't people touch each other at your house?'

   'what's that supposed to mean?'

   'i just wondered.' he said. 'do people go around touching you?'

   'no. of course not.' i didn't understand what he was getting at.

   he was staring at me with those round black eyes. 'i thought so. you flinch
every time someone touches you.'

   gramps opened his mouth and pointed to a gap in his teeth. 'see that? he
knocked my tooth right out.

   and when i told gram and gramps about flinching when ben touched me
and about how i went home and found dad in the garage, gram unbuckled
her seat belt, turned all the way around and leaned over the back of her seat.
she took my hand and kissed it.

   gramps said, 'give her one for me, too,' and so gram kissed my hand
again.

   several times, when i described phoebe's world of lunatics and axe
murderers, gram said, 'just like gloria, i swear to goodness. just exactly like
gloria.' once, after she said this, gramps got a dreamy look on his face and
gram said, 'quit that mooning over gloria. i know what you're thinking.'

   gramps said, 'hear that, chickabiddy? this here gooseberry knows
everything that runs through my head. isn't she something?'

   just before we reached the south dakota border, gramps took a detour
north because he had seen a sign advertising the pipestone

most did not go,
because she did not want to leave phoebe and me alone, but phoebe
promised to keep all the doors locked and not open the door for anyone. if
we heard any noises at all, we were supposed to call the police immediately.
'after you call the police,' mrs. winterbottom said, 'call mrs. cadaver. i
think she's home today. i'm sure she would come right over.

   'oh, sure,' phoebe whispered to me. 'that's about the last person i would
call.'

   phoebe imagined that every noise was the lunatic sneaking in or the
message-leaver creeping up to drop off another anonymous note. she was so
jumpy that i began to feel uneasy too.

   after her mother left, phoebe said, 'mrs. cadaver works odd hours, doesn't
she? sometimes she works every night for a week, straggling home when
most people are waking up, but sometimes she works during the day.

   'she's a nurse, so i guess she works different shifts,' i said.


   that day mrs. cadaver was home, puttering around her garden. we saw
her from

's mother was worried and miserable, but phoebe couldn't see it -
or if she could, she was ignoring it. maybe she didn't want to notice. maybe
it was too frightening a thing. i started wondering if this was how it had been
with my mother. were there things i didn't notice?

   phoebe sat quite straight in her chair and said, 'sal. i can assure you that
my mother would not be afraid to say if something is bothering her. what on
earth would she have to be afraid of? we are not exactly a family of lunatics,
you know.'

   later that afternoon, when phoebe and i went downstairs, mrs.
winterbottom was talking with prudence. 'do you think i lead a tiny life?'
she was asking.


   'how do you mean?' prudence asked, as she filed her nails. 'do we have
any nail polish remover?'

   phoebe's mother retrieved a bottle of nail polish remover from the
bathroom. 'what i was wondering,' phoebe's mother said, 'was if you think--'
she stopped talking when she saw me and phoebe.

   'oh!' prudence said to her

   the boy came out of nowhere. gramps saw him first and whispered, 'get
behind me, chickabiddy. you too, he said to gram. the boy was about
fifteen or sixteen, with shaggy dark hair. he wore blue jeans and no shirt,
and his chest was brown and muscular. in his hand he held a long bowie
knife, its sheath fastened to his belt. he was standing next to gramps' pants
on the bank.

   i thought of phoebe and knew that if she were here, she would be warning
us that the boy was a lunatic who would hack us all to pieces. i was wishing
we had never stopped at the river, and that my grandparents would be more
cautious, maybe even a little more like phoebe who saw danger everywhere.

   as the boy stared at us, gramps said. 'howdy.

   the boy said, 'this here's private property.'


   gramps looked all around. 'is it? i didn't see any signs.'

   'it's private property.' 'why, heck,' gramps said, 'this here's a river. i never
heard of no river being private property.

 - don't worry about it too
much. just write whatever comes to mind.'

   phoebe and i walked home with mary lou and ben. my brain was a mess,
what with trying not to flinch whenever ben brushed against me. when we
left ben and mary lou and turned the corner into phoebe's street, i wasn't
paying much attention. i suppose i was aware that someone was coming
along the sidewalk in our direction, but it wasn't until the person was about
three feet away that i really took notice.

   it was phoebe's lunatic, coming toward us, staring right at us. he stopped
directly in front of us, blocking our way.

   'phoebe winterbottom, right?' he said to phoebe. her voice was a little
squeak. the only sound that came out was a tiny 'erp...

   'what's the matter, phoebe winterbottom?' he said. he slid one hand into
his pocket.


   phoebe pushed him, yanked my arm, and started running. 'oh - my - god!'
she said. 'oh - my - god!'

   i was grateful that we were nearly at phoebe's house, so if he stabbed us i

broad daylight, maybe one of her neighbors would discover our bodies and
take us to the hospital before we bled entirely to death. i was actually
beginning to believe he was a lunatic.

   phoebe tugged at her doorknob, but the door was locked. phoebe beat on
the door, and her mother suddenly pulled it open. 'whatever is the matter?'
mrs. winterbottom said. she looked rather pale and shaken herself.

   'it was locked!' phoebe said. 'why was the door locked?'

   'oh, sweetie,' mrs. winterbottom said. 'it's just that - i thought that--' she
peered around us and looked up and down the street. 'did you see someone,
did someone frighten you--?'

   'it was the lunatic,' phoebe

said. 'we saw him just now.' she could hardly
catch her breath. 'maybe we should call the police. or tell dad.'

   i took a good long look at phoebe's mother. she did not seem capable of
phoning the police or mr. winterbottom. i think she was more scared than
we were. she went around locking all the doors.

   nothing more happened that evening and, by the time i went home, the
lunatic did not seem quite so threatening. no one called the police, and, to
my knowledge, mrs. winterbottom had not yet told mr. winterbottom.
right before i left phoebe's house, phoebe said to me, 'if i see the lunatic
once more, i will phone the police myself'

away where? why can't she explain? why didn't she tell you? did she
mention this? a few days? where did she go?'

   'maybe we should call the police,' phoebe said.

   'the police? what for?' mr. winterbottom said.

   'i think she was kidnapped or something.

   'oh, phoebe.'

   'i'm serious,' she said. 'maybe a lunatic came in the house and dragged her
off-

   'i'm not being funny. i mean it. it could happen.' prudence was still asking
questions. 'where did she go? why didn't she mention this? didn't she tell
you? where did she go?'


   'prudence, i honestly cannot say,' her father said.

   'i think we should call the police,' phoebe said again.

   'phoebe, if she was kidnapped, would the lunatic - as you say - allow he; to

22. evidence


   i spent the next night at phoebe's house, but i could hardly sleep. phoebe
kept saying, 'hear that noise?' and she would jump up to peer out the
window in case it was the lunatic returning for the rest of us once, she saw
mrs. cadaver in her garden with a torch.

   i must have fallen asleep after that, because i awoke to the sound of
phoebe crying in her sleep. when i woke her, she denied it. 'i was not
crying. i most certainly was not.' in the morning, phoebe refused to get up.
her father rushed into the room with two ties slung around his neck and his
shoes in his hand. 'phoebe, you're late.'

   'i'm sick,' she said. 'i have a fever and a stomach ache.'

the kerb, and mary lou gave me a peculiar look. i kept hoping that phoebe's
mother would be home. even though the door was locked, i kept hoping.
'are you sure you want me to come in?' i said. 'maybe you want to be alone.'

   phoebe said, 'i don 't want to be alone. call your dad and see if you can
stay for dinner again.

   inside, phoebe called, 'mom?' she walked through the house, looking in
each room. 'that's it,' phoebe said.' i'm going to search for clues, for
evidence that the lunatic has been here and dragged my mother off.' she was
really getting carried away. i wanted to tell her that she was just fishing in
the air and that probably her mother had not been kidnapped, but i could see
that phoebe didn't want to hear it.

   when my mother did not return, i imagined all sorts of things maybe she
had cancer and didn't want to tell us and was hiding in idaho. maybe she got
knocked on the head and had amnesia and was wandering around lewiston,
not knowing who she really was, o

 all about. 'i made cheerleading!' when phoebe
reminded her that their mother had been kidnapped. prudence said,  'oh,
phoebe.  mom wasn't kidnapped.'  she stopped jumping and looked around
the kitchen. 'so, what are we supposed to have for dinner?'

   phoebe rummaged around in the cupboards. prudence opened the freezer
compartment and said, 'look at this.' for a terrible moment, i thought

perhaps she had found some chopped-up body parts in there. maybe, just
maybe. phoebe was right. maybe a lunatic had done away with her mother. i
couldn't look. i could hear prudence moving things about in the freezer. at
least she wasn't screaming.

   there were no body parts in the freezer. instead, stacked neatly, were
plastic containers each with a little note attached. 'broc-len gas, 350, 1 hr,'
prudence read, and 'veg spa& 325, 30 min.' and 'mac che, 325, 45 min,' on
and on and on.

   'blood?' prudence said. she stopped eating.

   phoebe pulled out the envelope and emptied the hair strands on the table
.'strange hairs' phoebe explained.

   prudence said. 'uck.'


   mr. winterbottom tapped his fork against his knife. then he stood up, took
phoebe's arm, and said, 'follow me.' he went to the refrigerator, opened the
freezer compartment, and indicated the plastic containers 'if your mother had
been kidnapped by a lunatic, would she have had time to prepare all these
meals? would she have been able to say, "excuse me, mr. lunatic, while i
prepare ten or twenty meals for my family to eat while i am kidnapped"?'

   'you don't care,' phoebe said. 'nobody cares. everyone has his own idiot
agenda.'

   i left shortly after dinner. mr. winterbottom was in his study, phoning his
wife's friends to see if they had any idea of where she might have gone.

   margaret didn't say anything. she just stood there as my father retrieved
his jacket and joined me. dad and i walked home together. i knew it was
mean, but i felt as if i had won a little victory over margaret cadaver. on
the way home, dad asked if phoebe's mother had come back yet.

   'no.' i said. 'phoebe thinks a lunatic has carried her off.'

   'a lunatic? isn't that a bit far-fetched?'


   'that's what i thought at first, but you never know, do you? i mean it could
happen. 'there could actually be a lunatic who--'

   'sal.'

   i was going to explain about the nervous young man and the mysterious
messages, but my father would call me a goose. instead, i said, 'how do you
know that someone - not exactly a lunatic, but just someone - didn't make
mom go to idaho? maybe it was black- mail--'

and did peeby get any more of those messages? '

   'i hope everything turned out all right.' gram said. 'i'm a little worried
about peeby.'

   on the day after phoebe showed her father the suspicious spots and the
unidentifiable hair strands, another message appeared:

   you can 't keep the birds of sadness from flying over your head, but you
can keep them from nesting in your hair. phoebe brought the message to
school to show me. 'the lunatic again,' she said.

   'if he has already kidnapped your mother, why would he still be leaving
messages?'

   'they're clues,' she said.

   at school, people kept asking phoebe about her mother's business trip to
london. she tried to ignore them, but it wasn't always possible. she had to
answer some of the time.

   mary lou brought in a book about england, which proved that she was
right about covent garden. 'see?' she said. 'it's covent, not convent.'

   'about what?' phoebe said.

would put a good thing such as hope in a box with sickness and kidnapping
and murder. it was fortunate that it was there, though. if not, people would

war and the greenhouse effect and bombs and stabbings and lunatics.

   there must have been another box with all the good things in it, like
sunshine and love and trees and all that. who had the good fortune to open
that one, and was there one bad thing down there in the bottom of the 'good'

   phoebe's family had not seemed fine, even before the arrival of the lunatic
and the messages, and the disappearance of mrs. winterbottom. i knew that
phoebe was convinced that her mother was kidnapped because it was
impossible for phoebe to imagine that her mother could leave for any other
reason. i wanted to call phoebe and suggest that maybe her mother had gone
looking for something, maybe her mother was unhappy, maybe there was
nothing phoebe could do about it.

   when the bell rang, i raced out of the room. phoebe grabbed me. 'come
on,' she said. from her locker, she took the evidence, which she had brought,
from home. and we both ran the six blocks to the police station. i am not
exactly sure why i went along with phoebe. maybe it was because of that
poem about the traveller, or maybe it was because i had begun to believe in
the lunatic, or maybe it was because phoebe was taking some action, and i
admired her for it. i wished i had taken some action when my mother left. i
was not sure what i could have done, but i wished i had done something.

   phoebe and i stood for five minutes outside the police station, trying to
make our hearts slow down, and then we went inside and stood at the
counter. on the other side of it, a thin man with thumpingly large ears was
writing in a black book.

   'excuse me,' phoebe said.

hair was bright red and his face was covered in freckles he did not smile
when we entered. after the woman repeated what we had told her, he stared
at us for a long time.


   he said his name was sergeant bickle, and phoebe told him her name.
then, she told him everything. she explained about her mother's
disappearing and about the note from mrs. cadaver, and then about mrs.
cadaver's missing husband and the rhododendron bush, and finally about the
lunatic and the mysterious messages. at this point, sergeant pickle said,
'what sort of messages?'

   phoebe was prepared. she pulled them out of her book-bag and laid them
on the desk in the order in which they had arrived. he read each one aloud:

moons in his moccasins.

soon. tell him i would phone him now if i could, but i can't.'

   'that's all?' phoebe asked.

   'your mother also asked mrs. cadaver how you and prudence were. mrs.
cadaver told her that, as far as she knew, you and prudence were fine.'

   'well, i am not fine,' phoebe said, 'and what does mrs. cadaver know
anyway, and besides, mrs. cadaver is making the whole thing up. you
should let the police talk to her. you should ask her about the rhododendron
bush. you should find out who this lunatic is mrs. cadaver probably hired
him. you should--'

   'phoebe, your imagination is running away with you.' ·

   'it is not.'

   'phoebe--'

   'mom loves me,' she said, 'and she would not leave me without any
explanation.

   then, her father began to cry.

their way around peeby's family.'

s dark.

   'it's urgent, sal.'

   phoebe was waiting in front of mrs. cadaver's house. there were no lights
on there. phoebe said, 'come on,' and she started up the walk.

   i admit that i was reluctant. 'phoebe---

   'shh, i just want to take a quick look.' she crept up onto the porch and
stood by the door. she listened and then tapped twice.

   'phoebe--'

   'shh.'  she  turned  the  doorknob.  the door was unlocked. 'apparently,
neither mrs. cadaver nor mrs. partridge are worried about lunatics' phoebe
whispered. 'doesn't that tell you something?'

   i don't think phoebe intended to go inside, but she did, and i followed. we
stood in the dark hallway. in the room to the right, a shaft of light from the
street lamp came in through the window. we went into that room. we both
nearly leaped through the window when someone said, 'sal?' i started
backing toward the door.

   'it's a ghost,' phoebe said.

   'come here,' the voice said.

 of the office.


   sergeant bickle glanced at me and followed her. i waited, thinking he
would bring phoebe back and calm her down. i looked at the photographs on
his desk, the ones i had not been able to see the day before. in one was
sergeant bickle and a friendly looking woman - his wife, i supposed. the
second picture was of a shiny black car. the third picture was of sergeant
bickle, the woman, and a young man - their son, i figured. i looked closer.

   i recognized the son. it was the lunatic.


33. chicken and blackberry kisses


   gramps barrelled through wyoming like a house on fire. we snaked
through winding roads where the trees leaned close, rustling, rush, rush,
rush. the road curved alongside rivers that rolled and gabbled, hurry, hurry,
hurry.

   it was late when we arrived at yellowstone. all we got to see that evening
was a hot spring. 'we walked on boardwalks placed across the bubbling
mud. 'huzza, huzza!' gram said. we stayed at the old faithful inn in a

   to me, gram said, 'your grandfather nearly killed the egg man over that
letter.

   'hell's bells,' gramps said. 'he wasn't worth killing.'

   'maybe not,' gram said, 'but gloria was'

   'oh, yes' gramps said, placing his hand on his heart and pretending to
swoon, 'gloria!'

   'cut that out,' gram said. she rolled over on her side and said to me, 'tell
me about peeby. tell me that story, but don't make it too awfully sad.' she
folded her hands on her chest. 'tell me what happened with the lunatic.'

   when i saw the picture of the lunatic on sergeant bickle's desk, i tore out
of that office faster than lightning. i ran past sergeant bickle standing in the
parking lot. there was no sign of phoebe. i ran all the way to her house. as i
was passing mrs. cadaver's house, mrs. partridge called to me from her
porch.

   i stopped. 'you look all dressed up,' i said. 'are you going somewhere?'

   'oh, yes' she said. 'i'm redible.

   'you mean "ready"?'

   after mr. birkway left, phoebe and i sat on the front porch. phoebe said,
'if mrs. cadaver didn't kidnap or murder my mother, then where is she?
what can i do? where should i look?'

   'phoebe,' i said. 'there's something i've got to tell you.'

   'look, sal, if you're going to tell me she's not coming back, i don't want to
hear it. you might as well go home now. you might as well--'


   'no, phoebe, that isn't it. i know who the lunatic is. it's sergeant bickle's
son.

   and so we devised a plan.

   at home that night, all i could think about was mrs. cadaver. i could see
her in her white uniform, working in the emergency room. i could see an
ambulance pulling up with its blue lights flashing, and i could see her
walking briskly to the swinging doors, with her wild hair all around her face.
i could see the stretchers being wheeled in through the doorway and i could
see mrs. cadaver looking down at them.

   i could feel her

nery, and as i imagined
us in a thousand accidents and as i prayed underneath it all to any tree
whizzing by, i talked about peeby. i wanted to tell it all today. i wanted to
finish it.

   on the day after mr. birkway appeared at phoebe's house and told us
about mr. cadaver, phoebe and i were going to put our plan in motion. we
were going to track down sergeant bickle's son and, according to phoebe,
discover the whereabouts of phoebe's mother. i wasn't positive that sergeant
bickle's son was a lunatic, and i wasn't convinced he would lead us to
phoebe's mother, but enough of phoebe's tales had been transplanted into my
brain so that i was caught up in the plan. like phoebe, i was ready to take
some action.

   we could hardly sit still all day at school. phoebe, especially, was fired up.
she was worried, too. she was afraid we might not discover her mother
alive, and i was beginning to share that fear. at school, everyone was still
buzzing about the journal readings everyone wanted to know w

m hoping to find it,' i said.

   'i see,' he said. 'just a minute.' there was a muffled pause as he put his
hand over the receiver and called, 'honey, where's mike's address?'

   mike! brilliant! a name! i felt like the chief inspector! i felt like i had
just discovered the most important clue in the criminal investigation of the
century. to top it off, sergeant bickle gave me mike's address i was sorely
tempted to end the conversation by informing sergeant bickle that his son
was a potential lunatic, but i refrained. i thanked him and immediately
phoned phoebe.

   'you're brilliant!' she said. 'tomorrow we'll nail mike the lunatic.'


37. the visit


   the next day, saturday, when phoebe and i reached the bus stop, ben was
standing there. 'oh, crud,' phoebe muttered. 'are you waiting for this bus?
are you going to chanting falls?'

   'yup,' he said.


   'to the university?'

   'no.' ben pushed his hair from his eyes and looked up and down the street.
'there's a hospital there. i'm go

t of here.' at the end of the
hall, we slipped out the exit. 'i mean, what if we knocked on his door and he
opened it and pulled us inside and slit our throats?' phoebe said.

   students were milling around on the lawn. i looked for an empty bench on
which we might sit. on the far side of the lawn i saw the backs of two
people, a young man and an older woman. they were holding hands. she
turned to him and kissed his cheek.

   'phoebe-' on the bench was phoebe's mother, and she was kissing the
lunatic.


38. a kiss


   phoebe was stunned and angry, but she was braver than i was. she could
watch, but i could not. i started running. i assumed that phoebe would flee
too, but i didn't look back. i tore down the street, trying to remember where
the bus stop was i did not realize i had passed it until i saw the hospital. i
ducked inside, and it was only then that i realized that phoebe was not
behind me.

   what i did next was an impulse. a hunch. i asked the receptionist if i
could see mrs. fin

 yes, yes, yes!' she said.
'i've been waiting for that kiss for days i do like a story with some good

   'she's such a gooseberry,' gramps said.

   we were churning through montana. i didn't dare check our progress on
the map. i didn't want to discover that we couldn't make it in time. i thought
that if i kept talking, and praying underneath, and if we kept moving along
those mountainous roads, we had a chance.

   gram said, 'but, what about peeby? what about her mother kissing the
lunatic? i didn't like that kiss very much. it was the other one i liked - the
one with ben.

   when i left the hospital, i debated retracing my steps and returning to the
university in search of phoebe. i decided to find the bus stop first and then
see if i was feeling brave enough to go on, but when i did reach the bus stop,
there was phoebe, sitting on the bench.

   'well?' i said. 'what happened?'

   'where were you?'

   i did not tell her about seeing ben or his mother. i wanted to, but i

ay there.


   'and i thought you were the brave one,' she said. 'oh, well, it doesn't
matter. nothing matters. i'm sick of it.'

   'what happened?'

   'nothing. they sat there on the bench having a gay old time. if i could toss
rocks like you can toss rocks, i'd have plonked them both in the back of the
head. did you notice her hair? she's cut it. it's short. and do you know what
my mother did? in the middle of talking, she leaned over and spit on the
grass. spit! it was disgusting. and the lunatic, do you know what he did
when she spit? he laughed. then he leaned over and he spit.'

   'why would they do that?'

   'who knows? i'm sick of it. my mother can stay there for all i care. she
doesn't need me. she doesn't need any of us.'

   phoebe was like that all the way home on the bus. she was in an
extensively black mood. i did not tell her about ben. we got back to
phoebe's house just as her father pulled in the driveway. prudence rushed
out of the house saying, 'she called, she called,

nish.


   i had to wait until she went home to tell my father about phoebe's mother,
and when i did tell him, all he said was, 'so, mrs. winterbottom is coming
home. that's good. then he went over to the window and stared out of it for
the longest time, and i knew he was thinking about my mother.

   all that night i thought about phoebe and prudence and mr. winterbottom.
it seemed like their whole world was going to fall apart the next day when
mrs. winterbottom walked in all cuddly with the lunatic.


40. homecoming


   the next morning, phoebe phoned, begging me to come over. 'i can't stand
it,' she said. 'i want a witness'

   'for what?'

   'i just want a witness'

   'did you tell your father? about your mother and--' 'are you kidding?'
phoebe said. 'you should see him. he and prudence spent all last night and
this morning cleaning the house. 'they've scrubbed floors and bathrooms,
they dusted like fiends, they did ever so much laundry and ironing, and they
vacuumed. 'then, they too

ooked different. her hair was not only short but also quite stylish. she was

wearing lipstick, mascara and a little blush on her cheeks, and her clothes
were altogether unlike anything i had ever seen her in: a white t-shirt, blue
jeans, and flat black shoes dangling from her ears were thin silver hoop
earrings she looked magnificent, but she did not look like phoebe's mother.

   the second reason that i think phoebe nearly fainted dead away was that
there was mike bickle, phoebe's potential lunatic, in her own living room. it
was one thing to think he was coming, and another thing to actually see him
standing there.

   i didn't know what to think. for a second, i thought maybe mike had
kidnapped mrs. winterbottom and was bringing her back for some ransom
money or maybe he was now going to do away with the rest of us but i kept
thinking of seeing them together the day before, and besides, mrs.
winterbottom looked too terrific to have been held captive. mrs.
winterbottom did look a little

frightened, but not of mike. she seemed
afraid of her husband.

   'dad,' phoebe whispered, 'that's the lunatic.'

   'oh, phoebe,' her mother said, pressing her fingers to her cheek, and when
she made that familiar gesture, phoebe looked as if her heart was splitting
into a thou- sand pieces. mrs. winterbottom hugged phoebe, but phoebe did
not hug her back.

   mr. winterbotttom said, 'norma, i hope you are going to explain exactly
what is going on here.' he was trying to make his voice firm, but it trembled.

   prudence stood there, staring at mike. she seemed to find him quite
handsome and was flirti

ving me a chance to walk in my mother's moccasins - to see
what she had seen and feel what she might have felt on her last trip.

   and, another afternoon, after we had been talking about prometheus
stealing fire from the sun to give to man, and about pandora opening up the
forbidden box with all the evils of the world in it, gramps said that those
myths evolved because people needed a way to explain where fire came
from and why there was evil in the world. that made me think of phoebe
and the lunatic, and i said, 'if i was walking in phoebe's moccasins, i would
want to believe in a lunatic and an axe- wielding mrs. cadaver to explain my
mother's disappearance.'

   phoebe and her family helped me, i think. they helped me to think about
and understand my own mother. phoebe's tales were like my fishing in the

air: for a while i needed to believe that my mother was not dead and that she
would come back.

   i still fish in the air sometimes.

   it seems to me that we can't explain all the t
