m mr. whitaker! this photographer with the popeyes she said she trusted. came home from one of those towns up in illinois and to our complete surprise brought this child of two.
   mama said she like to made her drop dead for a second. "here you had this marvelous blonde child and never so much as wrote your mother a word about it," says mama. "i'm thoroughly ashamed of you." but of course she wasn't.
   stella-rondo just calmly takes off this hat, i wish you could see it. she says, "why, mama, shirley-t.'s adopted, i can prove it."
   "how?" says mama, but all i says was, "h'm!" there i was over the hot stove, trying to stretch two chickens over five people and a completely unexpected child into the bargain, without one moment's notice.
   "what do you mean  -  'h'm!'?" says stella-rondo, and mama says, "i heard that, sister."
   i said that oh, i didn't mean a thing, only that whoever shirley-t. was, she was the spit-image of papa-daddy if he'd cut off his beard, which of course he'd never do

 and sulks.
   stella-rondo got furious! she said, "sister, i don't need to tell you you got a lot of nerve and always did have and i'll thank you to make no future reference to my adopted child whatsoever."
   "very well," i said. "very well, very well. of course i noticed at once she looks like mr. whitaker's side too. that frown. she looks like a cross between mr. whitaker and papa-daddy."
   "well, all i can say is she isn't."
   "she looks exactly like shirley temple to me," says mama, but shirley-t. just ran away from her.
   so the first thing stella-rondo did at the table was turn papa-daddy against me.
   "papa-daddy," she says. he was trying to cut up his meat. "papa-daddy!" i was taken completely by surprise. papa-daddy is about a million years old and's got this long-long beard. "papa-daddy, sister says she fails to understand why you don't cut off your beard."
   so papa-daddy l-a-y-s down his knife and fork! he's real rich. mama says he is, he says he isn't. so he says, "have i hea

sy by my own grandfather."
   but stella-rondo says, "yes, you did say it too. anybody in the world could of heard you, that had ears."
   "stop right there," says mama, looking at me.
   so i pulled my napkin straight back through the napkin ring and left the table.
   as soon as i was out of the room mama says, "call her back, or she'll starve to death," but papa-daddy says, "this is the beard i started growing on the coast when i was fifteen years old.'' he would of gone on till nightfall if shirley-t. hadn't lost the milky way she ate in cairo.
   so papa-daddy says, "i am going out and lie in the hammock, and you can all sit here and remember my words: i'll never cut off my beard as long as i live, even one inch, and i don't appreciate it in you at all." passed right by me in the hall and went straight out and got in the hammock.
   it would be a holiday. it wasn't five minutes before uncle rondo suddenly appeared in the hall in one of stella-rondo's flesh-colored kimonos, all cut on the bi

y slammed the door behind me and went down and made some green-tomato pickle. somebody had to do it. of course mama had turned both the negroes loose; she always said no earthly power could hold one anyway on the fourth of july, so she wouldn't even try. it turned out that jaypan fell in the lake and came within a very narrow limit of drowning.
   so mama trots in. lifts up the lid and says, "h'm! not very good for your uncle rondo in his precarious condition, i must say. or poor little adopted shirley-t. shame on you!"
   that made me tired. i says, "well, stella-rondo had better thank her lucky stars it was her instead of me came trotting in with that very peculiar-looking child. now if it had been me that trotted in from illinois and brought a peculiar-looking child of two, i shudder to think of the reception i'd of got, much less controlled the diet of an entire family."
   "but you must remember, sister, that you were never married to mr. whitaker in the first place and didn't go up to illi

r ma-a-an!" and then somebody jumps up and down in the upstairs hall. in another second the house would of fallen down.
   "not only talks, she can tap-dance!" calls stella-rondo. "which is more than some people i won't name can do."
   "why, the little precious darling thing!" mama says, so surprised. "just as smart as she can be!" starts talking baby talk right there. then she turns on me. "sister, you ought to be thoroughly ashamed! run upstairs this instant and apologize to stella-rondo and shirley-t."
   "apologize for what?" i says. "i merely wondered if the child was normal, that's all. now that she's proved she is, why, i have nothing further to say."
   but mama just turned on her heel and flew out, furious. she ran right upstairs and hugged the baby. she believed it was adopted. stella-rondo hadn't done a thing but turn her against me from upstairs while i stood there helpless over the hot stove. so that made mama, papa-daddy and the baby all on stella-rondo's side.
   next, uncle rond

back!''
   "i didn't say any such of a thing, uncle rondo," i says, "and i'm not saying who did, either. why, i think you look all right. just try to take care of yourself and not talk and eat at the same time," i says. "i think you better go lie down."
   "lie down my foot," says uncle rondo. i ought to of known by that he was fixing to do something perfectly horrible.
   so he didn't do anything that night in the precarious state he was in  -  just played casino with mama and stella-rondo and shirley-t. and gave shirley-t. a nickel with a head on both sides. it tickled her nearly to death, and she called him "papa." but at 6:30 a.m. the next morning, he threw a whole five-cent package of some unsold one-inch firecrackers from the store as hard as he could into my bedroom and they every one went off. not one bad one in the string. anybody else, there'd be one that wouldn't go off.
   well, i'm just terribly susceptible to noise of any kind, the doctor has always told me i was the most sensitive

nd you got him  -  unfairly  -  is he going to sit down and write you a lengthy correspondence after you come home giving no rhyme nor reason whatsoever for your separation and no explanation for the presence of that child? i may not have your brilliant mind, but i fail to see it."
   so mama says, "sister, i've told you a thousand times that stella-rondo simply got homesick, and this child is far too big to be hers," and she says, "now, why don't you all just sit down and play casino?"
   then shirley-t. sticks out her tongue at me in this perfectly horrible way. she has no more manners than the man in the moon. i told her she was going to cross her eyes like that some day and they'd stick.
   "it's too late to stop me now," i says. "you should have tried that yesterday. i'm going to the p.o. and the only way you can possibly see me is to visit me there."
   so papa-daddy says, "you'll never catch me setting foot in that post office, even if i should take a notion into my head to write a letter
