pericles.
i thank thee.  mariner, say what coast is this?

second sailor.
we are near tarsus.

pericles.
thither, gentle mariner,
alter thy course for tyre.  when, canst thou reach it?

second sailor.
by break of day, if the wind cease.

pericles.
o, make for tarsus!
there will i visit cleon, for the babe
cannot hold out to tyrus there i'll leave it
at careful nursing. go thy ways, good mariner:
i'll bring the body presently.

i have been in many; but such a night as this,
till now, i ne'er endured.

cerimon.
your master will be dead ere you return;
there's nothing can be minister'd to nature
that can recover him.

first gentleman.
good morrow.

second gentleman.
good morrow to your lordship.

cerimon.
gentlemen,
why do you stir so early?

first gentleman.
sir,
our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
shook as the earth did quake;
the very principals did seem to rend,
and all-to topple: pure surprise and fear
made me to quit the house.

second gentleman.
that is the cause we trouble you so early;
'tis not our husbandry.

cerimon.
o, you say well.

first gentleman.
but i much marvel that your lordship, having
rich tire about you, should at these early hours
shake off t

'tis most strange,
nature should be so conversant with pain.
being thereto not compell'd.

cerimon.
i hold it ever,
virtue and cunning were endowments greater
than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
may the two latter darken and expend;
but immortality attends the former,
making a man a god. 'tis known, i ever
have studied physic, through which secret art,
by turning o'er authorities, i have,
together with my practice, made familiar
to me and to my aid the blest infusions
that dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
and i can speak of the disturbances
that nature works, and of

a more content in course of true delight
than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
to please the fool and death.

second gentleman.
your  honour has through ephesus pour'd forth
your charity, and hundreds call themselves
your creatures, who by you have been restored:
and not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
your purse, still open, hath built lord cerimon
such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.

[enter two or three servants with a chest.]

first servant.
so; lift there.

cerimon.
what is that?

first servant.
sir, even now
did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:
'tis of some wreck.

cerimon.
set 't down, let's look upon 't.

second gentleman.
'tis like a coffin, sir.

cerimon.
whate'er it be,
'tis  wondrous  heavy.  wrench it open straight:
if the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
'tis a good constraint

second gentleman.
'tis so, my lord.

cerimon.
how close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
did the sea cast it up?

first servant.
i never saw so huge a billow, sir,
as toss'd it upon shore.

cerimon.
wrench it open;
soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.

second gentleman.

cerimon.

     'here i give to understand,
     if e'er this coffin drive a-land,
     i, king pericles, have lost
     this queen, worth all our mundane cost.
     who her, give her burying;
     she was the daughter of a king:
     besides this treasure for a fee,
     the gods requite his charity!'

and yet the fire of life kindle again

at your command.  know you the character?

thaisa.
it is my lord's.
that i was shipp'd at sea, i well remember,
even on my eaning time; but whether there

i cannot rightly say.  but since king pericles,
my wedded lord, i ne'er shall see again,
a vestal livery will i take me to,
and never more have joy.

scene iii. the temple of diana at ephesus; thaisa standing near
the altar, as high priestess; a number of virgins on each side;
cerimon and other inhabitants of ephesus attending.

[enter pericles, with his train; lysimachus, helicanus, marina,
and a lady.]

pericles.
hail, dian! to perform thy just command,
i here confess myself the king of tyre;
who, frighted from my country, did wed
at pentapolis the fair thaisa.
at sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
a maid-child call'd marina; who, o goddess,
wears yet thy silver livery. she at tarsus
was nursed with cleon; who at fourteen years
he sought to murder: b

you are, you are -- o royal pericles!

pericles.
what means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!

cerimon.
noble sir,
if you have told diana's altar true,
this is your wife.

pericles.
reverend appearer, no;
i threw her overboard with these very arms.

cerimon.
upon this coast, i warrant you.

pericles.
'tis most certain.

cerimon.
look to the lady; o, she's but o'er-joy'd.
early in blustering morn this lady was
thrown upon this shore. i oped the coffin,
found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
here in diana's temple.

pericles.
may we see them?

helicanus.
hail, madam, and my queen!

thaisa.
i know you not.

pericles.
you have heard me say, when did fly from tyre,
i left behind an ancient substitute:
can you remember what i call'd the man
i have named him oft.

thaisa.
'twas helicanus then.

pericles.
still confirmation:
embrace him, dear thaisa; this is he.
now do i long to hear how you were found:
how possibly preserved; and who to thank,
besides the gods, for this great miracle.

thaisa.
lord cerimon, my lord; this man,
through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
from first to last resolve you.

pericles.
reverend sir,
the gods can have no mortal officer
more like a god than you. will you deliver
how this dead queen re-lives?

cerimon.
i will, my lord
beseech you, first go with me to my house,
where shall be shown you all was found with her;
how she came placed here in the temple;
no needful thing omitted.

pericles.
pure dian, bless thee for thy vision! i

and what this fourteen years no razor touch'd
to grace thy marriage-day, i'll beautify.

thaisa.
lord cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,

pericles.
heavens make a star of him! yet there, my queen,
we'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
will in that kingdom spend our following days:
our son and daughter shall in tyrus reign.
lord cerimon, we do our longing stay
to hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.

daughter, seen,
although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
in helicanus may you well descry
a figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
in reverend cerimon there well appears
the worth that learned charity aye wears:
for wicked cleon and his wife, when fame
had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
of pericles, to rage the city turn,
that him and his they in his palace burn;
the gods for murder seemed so content
to punish them although not done but meant.
so, on your patence evermore attending,
new joy wait on you! here our play has ending.
