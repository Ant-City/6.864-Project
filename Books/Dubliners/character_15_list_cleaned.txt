[CHARACTER] - 
the
burly and aggressive copy clerk and protagonist in "counterparts."
with his wine-red face and fuming temper, [CHARACTER] moves through
dublin as a time bomb of rage. [CHARACTER]'s job dooms him to unthinkingly
repeat his actions, and he transfers his frustrations from one experience
to the next without discernment. his outlets in life are drinking
and fighting, a physical engagement with the world that typifies
his lack of care and thought. [CHARACTER]'s son is one victim of
his rage.
