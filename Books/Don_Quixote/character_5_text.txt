 oh, fairest dulcinea, could it be!

 and london's town to that which shelters thee!
 oh, could mine but acquire that livery

 oh, could i be released from amadis

there was, so the story goes, in a village near his own a very
good-looking farm-girl with whom he had been at one time in love, though,
so far as is known, she never knew it nor gave a thought to the matter.
her name was aldonza lorenzo, and upon her he thought fit to confer the
title of lady of his thoughts; and after some search for a name which
should not be out of harmony with her own, and should suggest and
indicate that of a princess and great lady, he decided upon calling her
dulcinea del toboso--she being of el toboso--a name, to his mind,
musical, uncommon, and significant, like all those he had already
bestowed upon himself and the things belonging to him.

listen to such a lot of nonsense; from which, however, he came to the
conclusion that his neighbour was mad, and so made all haste to reach the
village to escape the wearisomeness of this harangue of don quixote's;
who, at the end of it, said, "senor don rodrigo de narvaez, your worship
must know that this fair xarifa i have mentioned is now the lovely
dulcinea del toboso, for whom i have done, am doing, and will do the most
famous deeds of chivalry that in this world have been seen, are to be

to this the peasant answered, "senor--sinner that i am!--cannot your
worship see that i am not don rodrigo de narvaez nor the marquis of
mantua, but pedro alonso your neighbour, and that your worship is neither
baldwin nor abindarraez, but the worthy gentleman senor quixada?"

don quixote was, as has been said, speaking to the lady in the coach:
"your beauty, lady mine," said he, "may now dispose of your person as may
be most in accordance with your pleasure, for the pride of your ravishers
lies prostrate on the ground through this strong arm of mine; and lest
you should be pining to know the name of your deliverer, know that i am
called don quixote of la mancha, knight-errant and adventurer, and
captive to the peerless and beautiful lady dulcinea del toboso: and in
return for the service you have received of me i ask no more than that
you should return to el toboso, and on my behalf present yourself before
that lady and tell her what i have done to set you free."

one of the squires in attendance upon the coach, a biscayan, was
listening to all don quixote was saying, and, perceiving that he would
not allow the coach to go on, but was saying it must return at once to el
toboso, he made at him, and seizing his lance addressed him in bad

sought one for an older and better language i should have found him. in
short, chance provided me with one, who when i told him what i wanted and
put the book into his hands, opened it in the middle and after reading a
little in it began to laugh. i asked him what he was laughing at, and he
replied that it was at something the book had written in the margin by
way of a note. i bade him tell it to me; and he still laughing said, "in
the margin, as i told you, this is written: 'this dulcinea del toboso so
often mentioned in this history, had, they say, the best hand of any
woman in all la mancha for salting pigs.'"

when i heard dulcinea del toboso named, i was struck with surprise and
amazement, for it occurred to me at once that these pamphlets contained
the history of don quixote. with this idea i pressed him to read the
beginning, and doing so, turning the arabic offhand into castilian, he
told me it meant, "history of don quixote of la mancha, written by cide

from a table-cloth, nor embrace his wife, and other points which, though
i cannot now call them to mind, i here grant as expressed) until i take
complete vengeance upon him who has committed such an offence against
me."

hearing this, sancho said to him, "your worship should bear in mind,
senor don quixote, that if the knight has done what was commanded him in
going to present himself before my lady dulcinea del toboso, he will have
done all that he was bound to do, and does not deserve further punishment
unless he commits some new offence."

"thou hast said well and hit the point," answered don quixote; and so i
recall the oath in so far as relates to taking fresh vengeance on him,
but i make and confirm it anew to lead the life i have said until such
time as i take by force from some knight another helmet such as this and
as good; and think not, sancho, that i am raising smoke with straw in

"what!" said don quixote, "has that never reached them?"

the rest of the party went along listening with great attention to the
conversation of the pair, and even the very goatherds and shepherds
perceived how exceedingly out of his wits our don quixote was. sancho
panza alone thought that what his master said was the truth, knowing who
he was and having known him from his birth; and all that he felt any
difficulty in believing was that about the fair dulcinea del toboso,
because neither any such name nor any such princess had ever come to his
knowledge though he lived so close to el toboso. they were going along
conversing in this way, when they saw descending a gap between two high
mountains some twenty shepherds, all clad in sheepskins of black wool,
and crowned with garlands which, as afterwards appeared, were, some of
them of yew, some of cypress. six of the number were carrying a bier
covered with a great variety of flowers and branches, on seeing

daughter of the innkeeper was daughter of the lord of the castle, and
that she, won by his high-bred bearing, had fallen in love with him, and
had promised to come to his bed for a while that night without the
knowledge of her parents; and holding all this fantasy that he had
constructed as solid fact, he began to feel uneasy and to consider the
perilous risk which his virtue was about to encounter, and he resolved in
his heart to commit no treason to his lady dulcinea del toboso, even
though the queen guinevere herself and the dame quintanona should present
themselves before him.

while he was taken up with these vagaries, then, the time and the
hour--an unlucky one for him--arrived for the asturian to come, who in
her smock, with bare feet and her hair gathered into a fustian coif, with
noiseless and cautious steps entered the chamber where the three were
quartered, in quest of the carrier; but scarcely had she gained the door

engaged in the sweetest and most amorous discourse with her, there came,

the remaining spoils of the battle, they went each one his own way, more
solicitous about keeping clear of the holy brotherhood they dreaded, than
about burdening themselves with the chain, or going to present themselves
before the lady dulcinea del toboso. the ass and rocinante, sancho and
don quixote, were all that were left upon the spot; the ass with drooping
head, serious, shaking his ears from time to time as if he thought the
storm of stones that assailed them was not yet over; rocinante stretched
beside his master, for he too had been brought to the ground by a stone;
sancho stripped, and trembling with fear of the holy brotherhood; and don

had done so much.

must be a tolerable poet, or i know little of the craft."

"then your worship understands rhyming too?"

"and better than thou thinkest," replied don quixote, "as thou shalt see

lady dulcinea del toboso, for i would have thee know, sancho, that all or
most of the knights-errant in days of yore were great troubadours and
great musicians, for both of these accomplishments, or more properly
speaking gifts, are the peculiar property of lovers-errant: true it is
that the verses of the knights of old have more spirit than neatness in
them."

will enlighten us."

had provocation and cause for those follies and penances; but what cause
has your worship for going mad? what lady has rejected you, or what
evidence have you found to prove that the lady dulcinea del toboso has
been trifling with moor or christian?"

"there is the point," replied don quixote, "and that is the beauty of
this business of mine; no thanks to a knight-errant for going mad when he

r don quixote; until now i have been under a great mistake,
for i believed truly and honestly that the lady dulcinea must be some
princess your worship was in love with, or some person great enough to
deserve the rich presents you have sent her, such as the biscayan and the
galley slaves, and many more no doubt, for your worship must have won
many victories in the time when i was not yet your squire. but all things
considered, what good can it do the lady aldonza lorenzo, i mean the lady
dulcinea del toboso, to have the vanquished your worship sends or will
send coming to her and going down on their knees before her? because may
be when they came she'd be hackling flax or threshing on the threshing

present."

"there is no need of threats with me," said sancho, "for i am not a man

the midst of these mountains;" and then, offhand and without stopping, he
told them how he had left him, what adventures had befallen him, and how
he was carrying a letter to the lady dulcinea del toboso, the daughter of
lorenzo corchuelo, with whom he was over head and ears in love. they were
both amazed at what sancho panza told them; for though they were aware of
don quixote's madness and the nature of it, each time they heard of it
they were filled with fresh wonder. they then asked sancho panza to show

repeat the letter a couple of times more, so that they too might get it
by heart to write it out by-and-by. sancho repeated it three times, and
as he did, uttered three thousand more absurdities; then he told them
more about his master but he never said a word about the blanketing that
had befallen himself in that inn, into which he refused to enter. he told
them, moreover, how his lord, if he brought him a favourable answer from
the lady dulcinea del toboso, was to put himself in the way of
endeavouring to become an emperor, or at least a monarch; for it had been
so settled between them, and with his personal worth and the might of his
arm it was an easy matter to come to be one: and how on becoming one his
lord was to make a marriage for him (for he would be a widower by that
time, as a matter of course) and was to give him as a wife one of the
damsels of the empress, the heiress of some rich and grand state on the

fortune; then he magnified the loss the world would sustain by his
absence while he remained there enchanted, for that he believed he was
beyond all doubt; then he once more took to thinking of his beloved
dulcinea del toboso; then he called to his worthy squire sancho panza,
who, buried in sleep and stretched upon the pack-saddle of his ass, was
oblivious, at that moment, of the mother that bore him; then he called
upon the sages lirgandeo and alquife to come to his aid; then he invoked
his good friend urganda to succour him; and then, at last, morning found

that he should see himself united in holy and lawful matrimony with his
beloved dulcinea del toboso, from whose blessed womb should proceed the

he told me that your worship's history is already abroad in books, with
the title of the ingenious gentleman don quixote of la mancha; and he
says they mention me in it by my own name of sancho panza, and the lady
dulcinea del toboso too, and divers things that happened to us when we
were alone; so that i crossed myself in my wonder how the historian who
wrote them down could have known them."

will be some sage enchanter; for to such nothing that they choose to
write about is hidden."

uncomfortable to think that the author was a moor, judging by the title
of "cide;" and that no truth was to be looked for from moors, as they are
all impostors, cheats, and schemers. he was afraid he might have dealt
with his love affairs in some indecorous fashion, that might tend to the
discredit and prejudice of the purity of his lady dulcinea del toboso; he
would have had him set forth the fidelity and respect he had always
observed towards her, spurning queens, empresses, and damsels of all
sorts, and keeping in check the impetuosity of his natural impulses.
absorbed and wrapped up in these and divers other cogitations, he was
found by sancho and carrasco, whom don quixote received with great

to show ingratitude to anyone?"

"god grant it," said don quixote; "we shall see when the government
comes; and i seem to see it already."

he then begged the bachelor, if he were a poet, to do him the favour of
composing some verses for him conveying the farewell he meant to take of
his lady dulcinea del toboso, and to see that a letter of her name was
placed at the beginning of each line, so that, at the end of the verses,
"dulcinea del toboso" might be read by putting together the first
letters. the bachelor replied that although he was not one of the famous
poets of spain, who were, they said, only three and a half, he would not
fail to compose the required verses; though he saw a great difficulty in
the task, as the letters which made up the name were seventeen; so, if he
made four ballad s

tanzas of four lines each, there would be a letter
over, and if he made them of five, what they called decimas or
redondillas, there were three letters short; nevertheless he would try to
drop a letter as well as he could, so that the name "dulcinea del toboso"
might be got into four ballad stanzas.

"it must be, by some means or other," said don quixote, "for unless the
name stands there plain and manifest, no woman would believe the verses
were made for her."

they agreed upon this, and that the departure should take place in three
days from that time. don quixote charged the bachelor to keep it a
secret, especially from the curate and master nicholas, and from his
niece and the housekeeper, lest they should prevent the execution of his

evil fortunes, so that he might rejoice over the former or condole with
him over the latter, as the laws of friendship required. don quixote
promised him he would do so, and samson returned to the village, and the
other two took the road for the great city of el toboso.

"at all events, let us go there, sancho," said don quixote; "for, so that
i see her, it is the same to me whether it be over a wall, or at a
window, or through the chink of a door, or the grate of a garden; for any
beam of the sun of her beauty that reaches my eyes will give light to my
reason and strength to my heart, so that i shall be unmatched and
unequalled in wisdom and valour."

"well, to tell the truth, senor," said sancho, "when i saw that sun of
the lady dulcinea del toboso, it was not bright enough to throw out beams
at all; it must have been, that as her grace was sifting that wheat i
told you of, the thick dust she raised came before her face like a cloud
and dimmed it."

"what! dost thou still persist, sancho," said don quixote, "in saying,
thinking, believing, and maintaining that my lady dulcinea was sifting
wheat, that being an occupation and task entirely at variance with what
is and should be the employment of persons of distinction, who are

"i do," said sancho, "but what has roncesvalles chase to do with what we
have in hand? he might just as well be singing the ballad of calainos,
for any good or ill that can come to us in our business."

by this time the labourer had come up, and don quixote asked him, "can
you tell me, worthy friend, and god speed you, whereabouts here is the
palace of the peerless princess dona dulcinea del toboso?"

"senor," replied the lad, "i am a stranger, and i have been only a few
days in the town, doing farm work for a rich farmer. in that house
opposite there live the curate of the village and the sacristan, and both
or either of them will be able to give your worship some account of this
lady princess, for they have a list of all the people of el toboso;

"your worship," replied sancho, "had better mark it with ruddle, like the
inscriptions on the walls of class rooms, that those who see it may see
it plain."

"then thou bringest good news," said don quixote.

"so good," replied sancho, "that your worship has only to spur rocinante
and get out into the open field to see the lady dulcinea del toboso, who,
with two others, damsels of hers, is coming to see your worship."

"holy god! what art thou saying, sancho, my friend?" exclaimed don
quixote. "take care thou art not deceiving me, or seeking by false joy to
cheer my real sadness."

"what could i get by deceiving your worship," returned sancho,
"especially when it will so soon be shown whether i tell the truth or
not? come, senor, push on, and you will see the princess our mistress
coming, robed and adorned--in fact, like what s

man of tall stature, gaunt features, long, lank limbs, with hair turning

moustaches; he does battle under the name of 'the countenance,' and he
has for squire a peasant called sancho panza; he presses the loins and
rules the reins of a famous steed called rocinante; and lastly, he has
for the mistress of his will a certain dulcinea del toboso, once upon a

because her name is casilda and she is of andalusia. if all these tokens
are not enough to vindicate the truth of what i say, here is my sword,
that will compel incredulity itself to give credence to it."

achievements as a knight have earned and acquired for him throughout the
known world. and in confirmation of this, i must tell you, too, that it
is but ten hours since these said enchanters his enemies transformed the
shape and person of the fair dulcinea del toboso into a foul and mean
village lass, and in the same way they must have transformed don quixote;
and if all this does not suffice to convince you of the truth of what i
say, here is don quixote himself, who will maintain it by arms, on foot
or on horseback or in any way you please."

and so saying he stood up and laid his hand on his sword, waiting to see
what the knight of the grove would do, who in an equally calm voice said

beyond all dispute, it is the rash and ill-advised bachelor samson
carrasco, our fellow townsman."

at this moment he of the mirrors came to himself, and don quixote
perceiving it, held the naked point of his sword over his face, and said
to him, "you are a dead man, knight, unless you confess that the peerless
dulcinea del toboso excels your casildea de vandalia in beauty; and in
addition to this you must promise, if you should survive this encounter
and fall, to go to the city of el toboso and present yourself before her
on my behalf, that she deal with you according to her good pleasure; and
if she leaves you free to do yours, you are in like manner to return and
seek me out (for the trail of my mighty deeds will serve you as a guide

of casildea; and i promise to go and to return from her presence to
yours, and to give you a full and particular account of all you demand of
me."

"you must also confess and believe," added don quixote, "that the knight

sancho held his tongue, and gave him a cloth, and gave thanks to god at
the same time that his master had not found out what was the matter. don
quixote then wiped himself, and took off his helmet to see what it was
that made his head feel so cool, and seeing all that white mash inside
his helmet he put it to his nose, and as soon as he had smelt it he
exclaimed:

to which, with great composure and pretended innocence, sancho replied,

let the devil eat them, for it must have been he who put them there. i

dress, mounted on twelve beautiful mares with rich handsome field
trappings and a number of little bells attached to their petrals, who,
marshalled in regular order, ran not one but several courses over the
meadow, with jubilant shouts and cries of "long live camacho and
quiteria! he as rich as she is fair; and she the fairest on earth!"

hearing this, don quixote said to himself, "it is easy to see these folk
have never seen my dulcinea del toboso; for if they had they would be
more moderate in their praises of this quiteria of theirs."

shortly after this, several bands of dancers of various sorts began to
enter the arcade at different points, and among them one of sword-dancers
composed of some four-and-twenty lads of gallant and high-spirited mien,
clad in the finest and whitest of linen, and with handkerchiefs
embroidered in various colours with fine silk; and one of those on the
mares asked an active youth who led them if an

wouldn't you say she was like a walking palm tree loaded with clusters of
dates? for the trinkets she has hanging from her hair and neck look just
like them. i swear in my heart she is a brave lass, and fit 'to pass over
the banks of flanders.'"

don quixote laughed at sancho's boorish eulogies and thought that, saving
his lady dulcinea del toboso, he had never seen a more beautiful woman.
the fair quiteria appeared somewhat pale, which was, no doubt, because of
the bad night brides always pass dressing themselves out for their
wedding on the morrow. they advanced towards a theatre that stood on one
side of the meadow decked with carpets and boughs, where they were to
plight their troth, and from which they were to behold the dances and
plays; but at the moment of their arrival at the spot they heard a loud

voice offered up a prayer to heaven, imploring god to aid him and grant
him success in this to all appearance perilous and untried adventure, and
then exclaimed aloud, "o mistress of my actions and movements,
illustrious and peerless dulcinea del toboso, if so be the prayers and

incomparable beauty i entreat thee to listen to them, for they but ask
thee not to refuse me thy favour and protection now that i stand in such
need of them. i am about to precipitate, to sink, to plunge myself into

thou dost favour me there is no impossibility i will not attempt and

round her eyes, and her sickly complexion; 'her sallowness, and the rings
round her eyes,' said he, 'are not caused by the periodical ailment usual
with women, for it is many months and even years since she has had any,
but by the grief her own heart suffers because of that which she holds in
her hand perpetually, and which recalls and brings back to her memory the
sad fate of her lost lover; were it not for this, hardly would the great
dulcinea del toboso, so celebrated in all these parts, and even in the
world, come up to her for beauty, grace, and gaiety.'

"'hold hard!' said i at this, 'tell your story as you ought, senor don
montesinos, for you know very well that all comparisons are odious, and
there is no occasion to compare one person with another; the peerless
dulcinea del toboso is what she is, and the lady dona belerma is what she
is and has been, and that's enough.' to which he made answer, 'forgive

of our journey, for they would not be all in place here), he showed me
three country girls who went skipping and capering like goats over the
pleasant fields there, and the instant i beheld them i knew one to be the
peerless dulcinea del toboso, and the other two those same country girls
that were with her and that we spoke to on the road from el toboso! i
asked montesinos if he knew them, and he told me he did not, but he
thought they must be some enchanted ladies of distinction, for it was
only a few days before that they had made their appearance in those
meadows; but i was not to be surprised at that, because there were a
great many other ladies there of times past and present, enchanted in
various strange shapes, and among

me to quit the cavern. he told me, moreover, that in course of time he
would let me know how he and belerma, and durandarte, and all who were
there, were to be disenchanted. but of all i saw and observed down there,
what gave me most pain was, that while montesinos was speaking to me, one
of the two companions of the hapless dulcinea approached me on one
without my having seen her coming, and with tears in her eyes said to me,
in a low, agitated voice, 'my lady dulcinea del toboso kisses your
worship's hands, and entreats you to do her the favour of letting her
know how you are; and, being in great need, she also entreats your
worship as earnestly as she can to be so good as to lend her half a dozen
reals, or as much as you may have about you, on this new dimity petticoat
that i have here; and she promises to repay them very speedily.' i was
amazed and taken aback by such a message, and turning to senor montesinos
i asked him, 'is it possible, senor montesinos, th

sends to beg those six reals, and the pledge is to all appearance a good
one, there is nothing for it but to give them to her, for no doubt she
must be in some great strait.' 'i will take no pledge of her,' i replied,
'nor yet can i give her what she asks, for all i have is four reals;

about having heard of his master, the knight of the rueful countenance;
for if she did not call him knight of the lions it was no doubt because
he had so lately taken the name. "tell me, brother squire," asked the
duchess (whose title, however, is not known), "this master of yours, is
he not one of whom there is a history extant in print, called 'the
ingenious gentleman, don quixote of la mancha,' who has for the lady of
his heart a certain dulcinea del toboso?"

"he is the same, senora," replied sancho; "and that squire of his who
figures, or ought to figure, in the said history under the name of sancho
panza, is myself, unless they have changed me in the cradle, i mean in
the press."

"i am rejoiced at all this," said the duchess; "go, brother panza, and

happen to me that could give me greater pleasure."

your service and that of my lady the duchess, your worthy consort, worthy
queen of beauty and paramount princess of courtesy."

"gently, senor don quixote of la mancha," said the duke; "where my lady
dona dulcinea del toboso is, it is not right that other beauties should
be praised."

sancho, by this time released from his entanglement, was standing by, and
before his master could answer he said, "there is no denying, and it must
be maintained, that my lady dulcinea del toboso is very beautiful; but
the hare jumps up where one least expects it; and i have heard say that

don quixote turned to the duchess and said, "your highness may conceive
that never had knight-errant in this world a more talkative or a droller
squire than i have, and he will prove the truth of what i say, if your
highness is pleased to accept of my services for a few days."

to which the duchess made answer, "that worthy sancho is droll i consider
a very good thing, because it is a sign that he is shrewd; for drollery
and sprightliness, senor don quixote, as you very well know, d

the seneschal replied that senor sancho should be obeyed in everything;
and with that he went away to dinner and took sancho along with him,
while the duke and duchess and don quixote remained at table discussing a
great variety of things, but all bearing on the calling of arms and
knight-errantry.

the duchess begged don quixote, as he seemed to have a retentive memory,
to describe and portray to her the beauty and features of the lady
dulcinea del toboso, for, judging by what fame trumpeted abroad of her
beauty, she felt sure she must be the fairest creature in the world, nay,
in all la mancha.

don quixote sighed on hearing the duchess's request, and said, "if i
could pluck out my heart, and lay it on a plate on this table here before
your highness's eyes, it would spare my tongue the pain of telling what
can hardly be thought of, for in it your excellence would see her

peasant, from fair to foul, from an angel into a devil, from fragrant to
pestiferous, from refined to clownish, from a dignified lady into a
jumping tomboy, and, in a word, from dulcinea del toboso into a coarse
sayago wench."

"god bless me!" said the duke aloud at this, "who can have done the world
such an injury? who can have robbed it of the beauty that gladdened it,
of the grace and gaiety that charmed it, of the modesty that shed a
lustre upon it?"

"who?" replied don quixote; "who could it be but some malignant enchanter

duennas gathered round him, waiting in profound silence to hear what he
would say. it was the duchess, however, who spoke first, saying:

"now that we are alone, and that there is nobody here to overhear us, i
should be glad if the senor governor would relieve me of certain doubts i
have, rising out of the history of the great don quixote that is now in
print. one is: inasmuch as worthy sancho never saw dulcinea, i mean the
lady dulcinea del toboso, nor took don quixote's letter to her, for it
was left in the memorandum book in the sierra morena, how did he dare to
invent the answer and all that about finding her sifting wheat, the whole
story being a deception and falsehood, and so much to the prejudice of
the peerless dulcinea's good name, a thing that is not at all becoming
the character and fidelity of a good squire?"

at these words, sancho, without uttering one in reply, got up from his
chair, and with noiseless steps, with

sing just now, the enchantment of the
lady dulcinea, i look upon it as certain, and something more than
evident, that sancho's idea of practising a deception upon his master,
making him believe that the peasant girl was dulcinea and that if he did
not recognise her it must be because she was enchanted, was all a device
of one of the enchanters that persecute don quixote. for in truth and
earnest, i know from good authority that the coarse country wench who
jumped up on the ass was and is dulcinea del toboso, and that worthy
sancho, though he fancies himself the deceiver, is the one that is
deceived; and that there is no more reason to doubt the truth of this,
than of anything else we never saw. senor sancho panza must know that we
too have enchanters here that are well disposed to us, and tell us what
goes on in the world, plainly and distinctly, without subterfuge or
deception; and believe me, sancho, that agile country lass was and is

"all that's very possible," said sancho panza; "and now i'm willing to
believe what my master says about what he saw in the cave of montesinos,
where he says he saw the lady dulcinea del toboso in the very same dress
and apparel that i said i had seen her in when i enchanted her all to
please myself. it must be all exactly the other way, as your ladyship
says; because it is impossible to suppose that out of my poor wit such a
cunning trick could be concocted in a moment, nor do i think my master is

my soul abideth now, there came to me
the sorrow-laden plaint of her, the fair,
the peerless dulcinea del toboso.
i knew of her enchantment and her fate,
from high-born dame to peasant wench transformed
and touched with pity, first i turned the leaves
of countless volumes of my devilish craft,
and then, in this grim grisly skeleton
myself encasing, hither have i come
to show where lies the fitting remedy
to give relief in such a piteous case.
  o thou, the pride and pink of all that  i wear

the adamantine steel! o shining light,
o beacon, polestar, path and guide of all
who, scorning slumber

"by all that's good," exclaimed sancho at this, "i'll just as soon give
myself three stabs with a dagger as three, not to say three thousand,

found out some other way of disenchanting the lady dulcinea del toboso,
she may go to her grave enchanted."

"but i'll take you, don clown stuffed with garlic," said don quixote,
"and tie you to a tree as naked as when your mother brought you forth,
and give you, not to say three thousand three hundred, but six thousand
six hundred lashes, and so well laid on that they won't be got rid of if
you try three thousand three hundred times; don't answer me a word or
i'll tear your soul out."

"i say, senora," returned sancho, "what i said before; as for the lashes,
abernuncio!"

"abrenuncio, you should say, sancho, and not as you do," said the duke.

"let me alone, your highness," said sancho. "i'm not in a humour now to
look into niceties or a letter more or less, for these lashes that are to
be given me, or i'm to give myself, have so upset me, that i don't know
what i'm saying or doing. but i'd like to know of this lady, my lady
dulcinea del toboso, where she learned this way she has of asking
favours. she comes to ask me to score my flesh with lashes, and she calls
me soul of a pitcher, and great untamed brute, and a string of foul names
that the devil is welcome to. is my flesh brass? or is it anything to me
whether she is enchanted or not? does she bring with her a basket of fair
linen, shirts, kerchiefs, socks-not that wear any--to coax me? no,
nothing but one piece of abuse after another, though she knows the

fear to milksops, for 'a stout heart breaks bad luck,' as you very well
know."

to this sancho replied with an irrelevant remark, which, addressing
merlin, he made to him, "will your worship tell me, senor merlin--when
that courier devil came up he gave my master a message from senor
montesinos, charging him to wait for him here, as he was coming to
arrange how the lady dona dulcinea del toboso was to be disenchanted; but
up to the present we have not seen montesinos, nor anything like him."

to which merlin made answer, "the devil, sancho, is a blockhead and a
great scoundrel; i sent him to look for your master, but not with a
message from montesinos but from myself; for montesinos is in his cave
expecting, or more properly speaking, waiting for his disenchantment; for
there's the tail to be skinned yet for him; if he owes you anything, or
you have any business to transact wi

and it will do you no harm to draw a little blood."

"there are a great many doctors in the world; even the enchanters are
doctors," said sancho; "however, as everybody tells me the same
thing--though i can't see it myself--i say i am willing to give myself
the three thousand three hundred lashes, provided i am to lay them on
whenever i like, without any fixing of days or times; and i'll try and
get out of debt as quickly as i can, that the world may enjoy the beauty
of the lady dulcinea del toboso; as it seems, contrary to what i thought,
that she is beautiful after all. it must be a condition, too, that i am
not to be bound to draw blood with the scourge, and that if any of the
lashes happen to be fly-flappers they are to count. item, that, in case i
should make any mistake in the reckoning, senor merlin, as he knows
everything, is to keep count, and let me know how many are still wanting
or over the number."

"there will be no need to let you know of any over," said merlin,

i am not the one to undermine the propriety of
senor don quixote, for it strikes me that among his many virtues the one
that is pre-eminent is that of modesty. your worship may undress and
dress in private and in your own way, as you please and when you please,
for there will be no one to hinder you; and in your chamber you will find
all the utensils requisite to supply the wants of one who sleeps with his
door locked, to the end that no natural needs compel you to open it. may
the great dulcinea del toboso live a thousand years, and may her fame
extend all over the surface of the globe, for she deserves to be loved by
a knight so valiant and so virtuous; and may kind heaven infuse zeal into
the heart of our governor sancho panza to finish off his discipline
speedily, so that the world may once more enjoy the beauty of so grand a
lady."

to which don quixote replied, "your highness has spoken like what you
are; from the mouth of a noble lady nothing bad can come; and dulcinea
will be more

don quixote had got so far with his song, to which the duke, the duchess,
altisidora, and nearly the whole household of the castle were listening,
when all of a sudden from a gallery above that was exactly over his
window they let down a cord with more than a hundr

six days he remained without appearing in public, and one night as he lay
awake thinking of his misfortunes and of altisidora's pursuit of him, he
perceived that some one was opening the door of his room with a key, and
he at once made up his mind that the enamoured damsel was coming to make
an assault upon his chastity and put him in danger of failing in the
fidelity he owed to his lady dulcinea del toboso. "no," said he, firmly
persuaded of the truth of his idea (and he said it loud enough to be
heard), "the greatest beauty upon earth shall not avail to make me
renounce my adoration of her whom i bear stamped and graved in the core
of my heart and the secret depths of my bowels; be thou, lady mine,

grievances your worship is wont to redress."

"tell me, senora dona rodriguez," said don quixote, "do you perchance
come to transact any go-between business? because i must tell you i am
not available for anybody's purpose, thanks to the peerless beauty of my
lady dulcinea del toboso. in short, senora dona rodriguez, if you will
leave out and put aside all love messages, you may go and light your

satisfaction. the master of the ceremonies apportioned the sun to them,
and stationed them, each on the spot where he was to stand. the drums
beat, the sound of the trumpets filled the air, the earth trembled under
foot, the hearts of the gazing crowd were full of anxiety, some hoping
for a happy issue, some apprehensive of an untoward ending to the affair,
and lastly, don quixote, commending himself with all his heart to god our
lord and to the lady dulcinea del toboso, stood waiting for them to give
the necessary signal for the onset. our lacquey, however, was thinking of
something very different; he only thought of what i am now going to
mention.

it seems that as he stood contemplating his enemy she struck him as the
most beautiful woman he had ever seen all his life; and the little blind
boy whom in our streets they commonly call love had no mind to let slip
the chance of triumphing over a lacquey heart, and adding it to the list
of his trophies;

is of so little advantage to them to practise these deceptions and

"oh, senor," said sancho, "those scoundrels are well used to changing
whatever concerns my master from one thing into another. a knight that he
overcame some time back, called the knight of the mirrors, they turned
into the shape of the bachelor samson carrasco of our town and a great
friend of ours; and my lady dulcinea del toboso they have turned into a
common country wench; so i suspect this lacquey will have to live and die
a lacquey all the days of his life."

here the rodriguez's daughter exclaimed, "let him be who he may, this man
that claims me for a wife; i am thankful to him for the same, for i had
rather be the lawful wife of a lacquey than the cheated mistress of a
gentleman; though he who played me false is nothing of the kind."

nd said to those who had brought them, "i take it as a happy omen,
brothers, to have seen what i have; for these saints and knights were of
the same profession as myself, which is the calling of arms; only there
is this difference between them and me, that they were saints, and fought
with divine weapons, and i am a sinner and fight with human ones. they
won heaven by force of arms, for heaven suffereth violence; and i, so
far, know not what i have won by dint of my sufferings; but if my
dulcinea del toboso were to be released from hers, perhaps with mended
fortunes and a mind restored to itself i might direct my steps in a
better path than i am following at present."

"may god hear and sin be deaf," said sancho to this.

the men were filled with wonder, as well at the figure as at the words of
don quixote, though they did not understand one half of what he meant by
them. they finished their dinner, took their images on their backs, and
bidding farewell to don quixote resumed their journe

 i therefore, grateful for the favour
that has been extended to me here, and unable to make a return in the
same measure, restricted as i am by the narrow limits of my power, offer
what i can and what i have to offer in my own way; and so i declare that
for two full days i will maintain in the middle of this highway leading
to saragossa, that these ladies disguised as shepherdesses, who are here
present, are the fairest and most courteous maidens in the world,
excepting only the peerless dulcinea del toboso, sole mistress of my
thoughts, be it said without offence to those who hear me, ladies and
gentlemen."

on hearing this sancho, who had been listening with great attention,
cried out in a loud voice, "is it possible there is anyone in the world
who will dare to say and swear that this master of mine is a madman? say,
gentlemen shepherds, is there a village priest, be he ever so wise or
learned, who could say what my master has said; or is there

has been said, planted himself in the
middle of the road, made the welkin ring with words to this effect: "ho
ye travellers and wayfarers, knights, squires, folk on foot or on
horseback, who pass this way or shall pass in the course of the next two
days! know that don quixote of la mancha, knight-errant, is posted here
to maintain by arms that the beauty and courtesy enshrined in the nymphs
that dwell in these meadows and groves surpass all upon earth, putting
aside the lady of my heart, dulcinea del toboso. wherefore, let him who
is of the opposite opinion come on, for here i await him."

twice he repeated the same words, and twice they fell unheard by any
adventurer; but fate, that was guiding affairs for him from better to
better, so ordered it that shortly afterwards there appeared on the road
a crowd of men on horseback, many of them with lances in their hands, all
riding in a compact body and in great haste. no sooner had those who were
with don quixote seen them than they turned abo

 who had been addressed say in reply, "why would you have us
read that absurd stuff, don juan, when it is impossible for anyone who
has read the first part of the history of 'don quixote of la mancha' to
take any pleasure in reading this second part?"

"for all that," said he who was addressed as don juan, "we shall do well
to read it, for there is no book so bad but it has something good in it.
what displeases me most in it is that it represents don quixote as now
cured of his love for dulcinea del toboso."

on hearing this don quixote, full of wrath and indignation, lifted up his
voice and said, "whoever he may be who says that don quixote of la mancha
has forgotten or can forget dulcinea del toboso, i will teach him with
equal arms that what he says is very far from the truth; for neither can
the peerless dulcinea del toboso be forgotten, nor can forgetfulness have
a place in don quixote; his motto is constancy, and his profession to
maintain the same with his life and never wrong it."

supper with them, as they knew very well there was nothing in that inn
fit for one of his sort. don quixote, who was always polite, yielded to
their request and supped with them. sancho stayed behind with the stew.
and invested with plenary delegated authority seated himself at the head
of the table, and the landlord sat down with him, for he was no less fond
of cow-heel and calves' feet than sancho was.

while at supper don juan asked don quixote what news he had of the lady
dulcinea del toboso, was she married, had she been brought to bed, or was
she with child, or did she in maidenhood, still preserving her modesty
and delicacy, cherish the remembrance of the tender passion of senor don
quixote?

to this he replied, "dulcinea is a maiden still, and my passion more
firmly rooted than ever, our intercourse unsatisfactory as before, and
her beauty transformed into that of a foul country wench;" and then he
proceeded to give them a full and particular account of the enchantment

 spirit. it was a sight to see the
figure don quixote made, long, lank, lean, and yellow, his garments
clinging tight to him, ungainly, and above all anything but agile.

the gay ladies made secret love to him, and he on his part secretly
repelled them, but finding himself hard pressed by their blandishments he
lifted up his voice and exclaimed, "fugite, partes adversae! leave me in
peace, unwelcome overtures; avaunt, with your desires, ladies, for she
who is queen of mine, the peerless dulcinea del toboso, suffers none but
hers to lead me captive and subdue me;" and so saying he sat down on the
floor in the middle of the room, tired out and broken down by all this
exertion in the dance.

don antonio directed him to be taken up bodily and carried to bed, and
the first that laid hold of him was sancho, saying as he did so, "in an
evil hour you took to dancing, master mine; do you fancy all mighty men
of valour are dancers, and all knights-errant given to capering? if you
do, i can tell yo

be good, faithful, and true, it will have ages of life; but if it should

altisidora was about to proceed with her complaint against don quixote,
when he said to her, "i have several times told you, senora that it
grieves me you should have set your affections upon me, as from mine they
can only receive gratitude, but no return. i was born to belong to
dulcinea del toboso, and the fates, if there are any, dedicated me to
her; and to suppose that any other beauty can take the place she occupies
in my heart is to suppose an impossibility. this frank declaration should
suffice to make you retire within the bounds of your modesty, for no one
can bind himself to do impossibilities."

hearing this, altisidora, with a show of anger and agitation, exclaimed,

the killer of damsels, he who has for his sole mistress the peerless

"by god i believe it," said don alvaro; "for you have uttered more
drolleries, my friend, in the few words you have spoken than the other
sancho panza in all i ever heard from him, and they were not a few. he

to find two don quixotes and two sancho panzas at once, as much alike in
name as they differ in demeanour; and again i say and declare that what i
saw i cannot have seen, and that what happened me cannot have happened."

"no doubt your worship is enchanted, like my lady dulcinea del toboso,"
said sancho; "and would to heaven your disenchantment rested on my giving
myself another three thousand and odd lashes like what i'm giving myself
for her, for i'd lay them on without looking for anything."

"i don't understand that about the lashes," said don alvaro. sancho
replied that it was a long story to tell, but he would tell him if they

the name of the shepherdess he means to glorify in his verses, and that
we should not leave a tree, be it ever so hard, without writing up and
carving her name on it, as is the habit and custom of love-smitten
shepherds."

"that's the very thing," said don quixote; "though i am relieved from
looking for the name of an imaginary shepherdess, for there's the
peerless dulcinea del toboso, the glory of these brooksides, the ornament
of these meadows, the mainstay of beauty, the cream of all the graces,
and, in a word, the being to whom all praise is appropriate, be it ever
so hyperbolical."

accommodating shepherdesses that will answer our purpose one way or
another."

names of the ones in print that the world is filled with, fili
