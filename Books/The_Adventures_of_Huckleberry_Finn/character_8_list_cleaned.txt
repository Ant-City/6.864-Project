the [CHARACTER]  - 
at one point during their travels, the duke and the
dauphin encounter a man who tells them of the death of a local named
peter wilks, who has left behind a rich estate. the man inadvertently
gives the con men enough information to allow them to pretend to
be wilks's two brothers from england, who are the recipients of
much of the inheritance. the duke and the dauphin's subsequent conning
of the good-hearted and vulnerable wilks sisters is the first step
in the con men's increasingly cruel series of scams, which culminate
in the sale of jim.
