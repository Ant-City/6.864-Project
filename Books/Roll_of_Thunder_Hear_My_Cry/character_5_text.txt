g to keep the rusty mississippi dust from swelling with each step and drifting
back upon his shiny black shoes and the cuffs of his corduroy pants by lifting each foot high before setting it gently down
again. always meticulously neat, six-year old little man never allowed dirt or tears or stains to mar anything he owned.
today was no exception.
'you keep it up and make us late for school, mama's gonna wear you out.' i threatened, pulling with exasperation at the high
collar of the sunday dress mama had made me wear for the first day of school - as if that event were something special. it
seemed to me that showing up at school at all on a bright august-like october morning made for running the cool forest trails
and wading barefoot in the forest pond was concession enough; sunday clothing was asking too much. christopher-john and
stacey were not too pleased about the clothing or school either. only little man, just beginning his school career, found the
prospects of both intriguing.

d without even looking up from his studied steps, 'me, i'm gonna stay
clean.'
‘i betcha mama's gonna "clean" you, you keep it up.' i grumbled.
‘ah, cassie, leave him be,' stacey admonished, frowning and kicking testily at the road. 
‘i ain't said nothing but..’
stacey cut me a wicked look and i grew silent. his disposition had been irritatingly sour lately. if i hadn't known the cause of
it. i could have forgotten very easily that he was at twelve, bigger than i, and that i had promised mama to arrive at school
looking clean and ladylike. 'shoot,' i mumbled finally, unable to restrain myself from further comment, 'it ain't my fault you
gotta be in mama's class this year.'
stacey's frown deepened and he jammed his fists into his pockets, but said nothing.
christopher-john, walking between stacey and me, glanced uneasily at both of us but did not interfere. a short, round boy of
seven, he took little interest in troublesome things, preferring to remain on good terms with everyone, yet

o. that's important. you may not understand that now, but one day you will. then
you'll see.
i looked at papa strangely when he said that, for i knew that all the land did not belong to me. some of it belonged to stacey,
christopher-john, and little man, not to mention the part that belonged to big ma. mama, and uncle hammer, papa's older
brother who lived in chicago. but papa never divided the land in his mind: it was simply logan land. for it he would work
the long, hot summer pounding steel: mama would teach and run the farm; big ma, in her sixties, would work like a woman
of twenty in the fields and keep the house; and the boys and i would wear threadbare clothing washed to dishwater color: but
always, the taxes and the mortgage would be paid. papa said that one day i would understand.
i wondered.
when the fields ended and the granger forest fanned both sides of the road with long overhanging branches, a tall,
emaciated-looking boy popped suddenly from a forest trail and swung a thin ar

east again.
finally t.j. said, 'okay. see, them berrys' burnin' wasn't no accident. some white men took a match to 'em,'
'y-you mean just lit 'em up like a piece of wood!' stammered christopher-john, his eyes growing big with disbelief. 'but
why!' asked stacey,
t.j. shrugged. 'don't know why. jus' know they done it, that's all.'
'how you know !' i questioned suspiciously.
he smiled smugly. ''cause your mama come down on her way to school and talked to my mama 'bout it.'
'she did !'
'yeah, and you should've seen the way she look when she come outa that house.'
'how'd she look!' inquired little man, interested enough to glance up from the road for the first time.
t.j. looked around grimly and whispered. 'like... death.' he waited a moment for his words to be appropriately shocking, but
the effect was spoiled by little man, who asked lightly, 'what does death look like !' 
t.j. turned in annoyance. 'd

 tell ya. stacey, man,' said t.j. morosely, shaking his head. 'sometimes i jus' don't know 'bout that family of yours.
stacey pulled back, considering whether or not t.j.'s words were offensive. but t.]. immediately erased the question by
continuing amiably. 'don't get me wrong, stacey. they some real swell kids, but that cassie 'bout got me whipped this
mornin'.
'good !' i said.
'now how'd she do that !' stacey laughed.
'you wouldn't be laughin' if it'd've happened to you. she up and told your mama 'bout me goin' up to that wallace store
dancin' room and miz logan told mama.' he eyed me disdainfully then went on. 'but don't worry, i got out of it though.
when mama asked me 'bout it, i jus' said ole claude was always sneakin' up there to get some of that free candy mr. kaleb
give out sometimes and i had to go and get him 'cause i knowed good and well she didn't want us up there. boy, did he get

a small potbellied stove. although being
eyeball to eyeball with miss crocker was nothing to look forward to, the prospect of being warm once the cold weather set in
was nothing to be sneezed at either, so i resolved to make the best of my rather dubious position.
now miss crocker made a startling announcement: 'this year we would all have books.
everyone gasped, for most of the students had never handled a book at all besides the family bible. i admit that even i was
somewhat excited. although mama had several books. i had never had one of my very own.
'now we're very fortunate to get these readers,' miss crocker explained while we eagerly awaited the unveiling. the county
superintendent of schools himself brought these books down here for our use and we must take extra-good care of them.' she
moved toward her desk. 'so let's all promise that we'll take the best care possible of these new books.' she stared down,
expecting our response. 'all right, all together, let's repeat, "we promise t

 the tense air. i turned back around. 'miz crocker,' i said, 'i
don't want my book neither.
the switch landed hard upon little man's upturned bottom. miss crocker looked questioningly at me as i reached up to her
desk and placed the book upon it. then she swung the switch five more times and, discovering that little man had no
intention of crying, ordered him up.
'all right, cassie,' she sighed, turning to me, 'come on and get yours.'
by the end of the school day i had decided that i would tell mama everything before miss crocker had a chance to do so.
from nine years of trial and error, i had learned that punishment was always less severe when i poured out the whole truth to
mama on my own before she had heard anything from anyone else. i knew that miss crocker had not spoken to mama during
the lunch period, for she had spent the whole hour in the classroom preparing for the afternoon session.
as soon as class was dismissed i sped from the room, weaving a path through throngs of students h

rkness of the hallway,
mama's classroom was in the back, i crept silently along the quiet hall and peeped cautiously into the open doorway, mama,
pushing a strand of her long, crinkly hair back into the chignon at the base of her slender neck, was seated at her desk
watching miss crocker thrust a book before her, 'just look at that. mary,' miss crocker said, thumping the book twice with
her forefinger. 'a perfectly good book ruined. look at that broken binding and those foot marks all over it.'
mama did not speak as she studied the book. 'and here's the one cassie wouldn't take.' she said, placing a second book on
mama's desk with an outraged slam. 'at least she didn't have a tantrum and stomp all over hers. i tell you, mary. i just don't 
know what got into those children today. i always knew cassie was rather high-strung, but little man! he's always such a
perfect little gentle- man.'
mama glanced at the book i had rejected and opened the front cover so that the offensive pages of both bo

oks faced her. 'you
say cassie said it was because of this front page that she and little man didn't want the books !' mama asked quietly.
'yes, ain't that something!' miss crocker said, forgetting her teacher-training-school diction in her indignation. 'the very
idea! that's on all the books, and why they got so upset about it i'll never know.'
'you punish them!' asked mama, glancing up at miss crocker.
'well, i certainly did ! whipped both of them good with my hickory stick. wouldn't you have!' when mama did not reply,
she added defensively, 'i had a perfect right to.'
'of course you did. daisy.' mama said, turning

 back to the books again. 'they disobeyed you.' but her tone was so quiet and
noncommittal that i knew miss crocker was not satisfied with her reaction.
'well, i thought you would've wanted to know, mary, in case you wanted to give them a piece of your mind also.'
mama smiled up at miss crocker and said rather absently, ‘yes, of course, daisy. thank you.' then she opened her desk
drawer and pulled out some paper, a pair of scissors. and a small brown bottle.
miss crocker, dismayed by mama's seeming unconcern for the seriousness of the matter, thrust her shoulders back and began
moving away from the desk. ‘you understand that if they don't have those books to study from, i’ll have to fail them in both
reading and composition, since i plan to base all my l

essons around -' she stopped abruptly and stared in amazement at
mama. ‘mary, what in the world are you doing!'
mama did not answer. she had trimmed the paper to the size of the books and was now dipping a gray-looking glue from the
brown bottle onto the inside cover of one of the books. then she took the paper and placed it over the glue.
'mary logan, do you know what you're doing! that book belongs to the county. if somebody from the superintendent's office
ever comes down here and sees that book, you'll be in real trouble.'
mama laughed and picked up the other book. 'in the first place no one cares enough to come down here, and in the second
