                	o'brien's
daughter and a symbol of the naive outsider. although o'brien alludes
to having multiple children, [CHARACTER] is the only one we meet. her
youth and innocence force o'brien to try to explain the meaning of
the war. frustrated that he cannot tell her the whole truth, he
is inspired by her presence since it forces him to gain new perspective
on his war experience.
