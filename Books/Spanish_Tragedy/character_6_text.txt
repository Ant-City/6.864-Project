[prologue]

                enter the ghost of andrea, and with him revenge.

  ghost.  when this eternal substance of my soul
    did live imprison'd in my wanton flesh,
    each in their function serving others' need,
    i was a courtier in the spanish court:
    my name was don andrea; my descent,
    though not ignoble, yet inferior far
    to gracious fortunes of my tender youth,
    for there, in prime and pride of all my years,
    by duteous service and deserving love,
    in secret i possess'd a worthy dame,
    which hight sweet bel-imperia by name.
    but

g lead,
    and all foul sins with torments overwhelm'd;
    'twixt these two ways i trod the middle path,
    which brought me to the fair elysian green,
    in midst whereof there stands a stately tower,
    the walls of brass, the gates of adamant.
    here finding pluto with his proserpine,
    i show'd my passport, humbled on my knee.
    whereat fair proserpine began to smile,
    and begg'd that only she might give me doom.
    pluto was pleas'd, and seal'd it with a kiss.
    forthwith, revenge, she rounded thee in th' ear,
    and bad thee lead me though the gates of horn,
    where dreams have passage in the silent night.
    no sooner had she spoke but we were here,
    i wot not how, in the twinkling of an eye.

  revenge.  then know, andrea, that thou arriv'd
    where thou shalt see the author of thy death,
    don balthazar, the prince of portingal,
    depriv'd of life by bel-imperia:
    here sit we down to see the mystery,
    and serve for chorus in this tragedy.

nly son!
    o, wherefore went i not to war myself?
    the cause was mine; i might have died for both.
    my years were mellow, but his young and green:
    my death were natural, but his was forc'd.

  alex.  no doubt, my liege, but still the prince survives.

  vice.  survives!  ay, where?

  alex.  in spain, a prisoner by mischance of war.

  vice.  then they have slain him for his father's fault.

  alex.  that were a breach to common law of arms.

  vice.  they reck no laws that meditate revenge.

  alex.  his ransom's worth will stay from foul revenge.

  vice.  no; if he liv'd, the news would soon be here.

  villup.  my sovereign, pardon the author of ill news,
    and i'll bewray the fortune of thy son.

  vice.  speak on; i'll guerdon thee, whate'er it be.
    mine ear is ready to receive ill news,
    my heart grown hard 'gainst mischief's battery;
    stand up, i say, and tell thy tale at large.

  villup.  then hear that truth which these mine eyes have seen:
    when both the

 but now, if your good liking stand thereto,
    i'll crave your pardon to go seek the prince;
    for so the duke, your father, gave me charge.

                exit.

  bel.  aye, go, horatio; leave me here alone,
    for solitude best fits my cheerless mood.--
    yet what avails to wail andreas death,
    from whence horatio proves my second love?
    had he not lov'd andrea as he did,
    he could not sit in bel-imperia's thoughts.
    but how can love find harbour in my breast,
    till i revenge the death of my belov'd?
    yes, second love shall further my revenge:
    i'll love horatio, my andrea's friend,
    the more to spite the prince that wrought his end;
    and, where don balthazar, that slew my love,
    himself now pleads for favor at my hands,
    he shall, in rigour of my just disdain,
    reap long repentance for his murderous deed,--
    for what was't else but murderous cowardice,
    so many to oppress one valiant knight,
    without respect of honour in the fight?

 horatio.

    my lord, i fear we sit but over-long,
    unless our dainties were more delicate,--
    but welcome are you to the best we have.
    now let us in, that you may be dispatch'd;
    i think our council is already set.

                exeunt omnes.

                [chorus.]

  andrea.  come we for this from depth of under ground,--
    to see him feast that gave me my death's wound?
    these pleasant sights are sorrow to my soul:
    nothing but league and love and banqueting!

  revenge.  be still, andrea;  ere we go from hence,
    i'll turn their friendship into fell despite,
    their love to mortal hate, their day to night,
    their hope into despair, their peace to war,
    their joys to pain, their bliss to misery.

                exit pedringano.

    why, so, tam armis quam ingenio:
    where words prevail not, violence prevails.
    but gold doth more than either of them both.
    how likes prince balthazar this stratagem?

  bal.  both well and ill; it makes me glad and sad:
    glad, that i know the hind'rer of my love;
    sad, that i fear she hates me whom i love;
    glad, that i know on whom to be reveng'd;
    sad, that she'll fly me if i take revenge.
    yet must i take revenge or die myself;
    for love resisted grows impatient.
    i think horatio be my destin'd plague:
    first, in his hand he brandished a sword,
    and with that sword he fiercely waged war,
    and in that war he gave me dangerous wounds,
    and by those wounds he forced me to yield,
    and by my yielding i became his slave;
    now, in his mouth he carries pleasing words,
    which pleasing words do harbour sweet conceits,
    which sweet conceits are lim'd with

sly deceits,
    which sly deceits smooth bel-imperia's ears,
    and through her ears dive down into her heart,
    and in her heart set him, where i should stand.
    thus hath he ta'en my body by his force,
    and now by sleight would captivate my soul;
    but in his fall i'll tempt the destinies,
    and either lose my life or win my love.

  lor. let's go, my lord;  our staying stays revenge.
    do but follow me, and gain your love;
    her favour must be won by his remove.

                exeunt.

[the duke's castle]

                enter horatio and bel-imperia.

  hor.  now, madame, since by favour of your love
    our hidden smoke is turn'd to open flame,
    and that with looks and words we feed our thought,--
    two chief contents where more cannot be had,--
    thus in the midst of love's fair blandishments
    why show you sign of inward languish

    how could thou strangle virtue and desert?
    ay me, most wretched!  that have lost my joy

  isa.  my husband's absence makes my heart to throb.
    hieronimo!

  hiero.  here, isabella.  help me to lament;
    for sighs are stopp'd, and all my tears are spent.

  isa.  what world of grief--my son horatio!
    o where's the author of this endless woe?

  hiero.  to know the author were some ease of grief,
    for in revenge my heart would find relief.

  isa.  then is he gone?  and is my son gone too?
    o, gush out, tears!  fountains and floods of tears!
    blow, sighs, and raise an everlasting storm;
    for outrage fits our cursed wretchedness.

  hiero.  sweet lovely rose, ill pluck'd before thy time!
    fair, worthy son, not conquer'd, but betray'd!
    i'll kiss thee now, for words with tears are stay'd.

  isa.  and i'll close up the glasses of his sight;
    for once these eyes were only my delight.

hiero.  see'st thou this handkerchief besmear'd with blood?
    it shall not from me till i take revenge;
    see'st thou those wounds that yet are bleeding fresh?
    i'll not entomb them till i have reveng'd:
    then will i joy amidst my discontent,
    till then, my sorrow never shall be spent.

  isa.  the heav'ns are just, murder cannot be hid;
    time is the author of both truth and right,
    and time will bring this treachery to light.

  hiero.  meanwhile, good isabella, cease thy plaints,
    or, at the least, dissemble them awhile;
    so shall we sooner find the practise out,
    and

                [chorus.]

  andrea.  brought'st thou me hither to increase my pain?
    i look'd that balthazar should have been slain;
    but 'tis my friend horatio that is slain,
    and they abuse fair bel-imperia,
    on whom i doted more then all the world,
    because she lov'd me more then all the world.

  revenge.  thou talk'st of harvest, when the corn is green;
    the end is crown of every work well done;
    the sickle comes not till the corn be ripe.
    be still, and, ere i lead thee from this place,
    i'll show thee balthazar in heavy case.

  bazulto.  alas, my lord, whence springs this troubled speech?

  hiero.  but let me look on my horatio:
    sweet boy, how art thou chang'd in death's black shade!
    had proserpine no pity on thy youth,
    but suffer'd thy fair crimson-colour'd spring
    with wither'd winter to be blasted thus?
    horatio, thou are older than thy father:
    ah, ruthless father, that favour thus transforms.

    for here i swear in sight of heav'n and earth,
    shouldst thou neglect the love thou shouldst retain
    and give it over and devise no more,
    myself should send their hateful souls to hell
    that wrought his downfall with extremest death!

  hie.  but may it be that bel-imperia
    vows such revenge as she hath deign'd to say?
    why then, i see that heav'n applies our drift,
    and all the saints do sit soliciting
    for vengeance on those cursed murtherers.
    madame, 'tis true, and now i find it so.
    i found a letter, written in your name,
    and in that letter, how horatio died.
    pardon, o pardon, bel-imperia,
    my fear and care in not believing it!
    nor think i thoughtless think upon a mean
    to let his death be unreveng'd at full.

    it as propitious, see, i have reserv'd,
    and never hath it left my bloody heart,
    soliciting remembrance of my vow

    that i might kill him more conveniently.
    so, viceroy, was this balthazar thy son--
    that suleiman which bel-imperia

  vice.  why hast thou murdered my balthazar?

  cas.  why hast thou butcher'd both my children thus?

  hiero.  o good words!  as dear to me was horatio
    as yours, or yours, my lord, to you.
    my guiltless son was by lorenzo slain;
    and by lorenzo and that balthazar
    am i at last revenged thoroughly,--
    upon whose souls may heav'n be yet aveng'd

    for by her hand my balthazar was slain,--
    i saw her stab him.

    than harmless silence?  then afford it me!

    but never shalt thou force me to reveal

    and therefore, in despite of all thy threats,
    pleas'd with their deaths, and eas'd with their revenge,
    first take my tongue, and afterwards my heart!
