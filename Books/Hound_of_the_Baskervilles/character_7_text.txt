nything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.
for both these reasons i thought that i was justified in telling rather
less than i knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with
you there is no reason why i should not be perfectly frank.

â€œthe moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each other
are thrown very much together. for this reason i saw a good deal of
sir charles baskerville. with the exception of mr. frankland, of lafter
hall, and mr. stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men of
education within many miles. sir charles was a retiring man, but the
chance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests
in science kept us so. he had brought back much scientific information
from south africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together
discussing the comparative anatomy of the bushman and the hottentot.

â€œwithin the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that
sir charlesâ€™s nervous system was

ortance in view of the tragedy which followed, but i was
convinced at the time that the matter was entirely trivial and that his
excitement had no justification.

â€œit was at my advice that sir charles was about to go to london. his
heart was, i knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived,
however chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a
serious effect upon his health. i thought that a few months among the
distractions of town would send him back a new man. mr. stapleton, a
mutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the
same opinion. at the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.

â€œon the night of sir charlesâ€™s death barrymore the butler, who made
the discovery, sent perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as i was
sitting up late i was able to reach baskerville hall within an hour of
the event. i checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned
at the inquest. i followed the footsteps down the yew alley, i saw the

â€œby no means. you could not make a greater mistake. if they are innocent
it would be a cruel injustice, and if they are guilty we should be
giving up all chance of bringing it home to them. no, no, we will
preserve them upon our list of suspects. then there is a groom at the
hall, if i remember right. there are two moorland farmers. there is our
friend dr. mortimer, whom i believe to be entirely honest, and there is
his wife, of whom we know nothing. there is this naturalist, stapleton,
and there is his sister, who is said to be a young lady of attractions.
there is mr. frankland, of lafter hall, who is also an unknown factor,
and there are one or two other neighbours. these are the folk who must
be your very special study.â€

â€œi will do my best.â€

â€œyou have arms, i suppose?â€

â€œyes, i thought it as well to take them.â€

â€œmost certainly. keep your revolver near you night and day, and never
relax your precautions.â€

our friends had already secured a first-class

e. and then
suddenly, in the very dead of the night, there came a sound to my
ears, clear, resonant, and unmistakable. it was the sob of a woman, the
muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn by an uncontrollable sorrow.
i sat up in bed and listened intently. the noise could not have been
far away and was certainly in the house. for half an hour i waited with
every nerve on the alert, but there came no other sound save the chiming
clock and the rustle of the ivy on the wall.




chapter 7. the stapletons of merripit house



the fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from
our minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of
us by our first experience of baskerville hall. as sir henry and i sat
at breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,
throwing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered
them. the dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it
was hard to realize that this was indeed the cha

n, flaxen-haired
and leanjawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray
suit and wearing a straw hat. a tin box for botanical specimens hung
over his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his
hands.

â€œyou will, i am sure, excuse my presumption, dr. watson,â€ said he as he
came panting up to where i stood. â€œhere on the moor we are homely folk
and do not wait for formal introductions. you may possibly have heard
my name from our mutual friend, mortimer. i am stapleton, of merripit
house.â€

â€œyour net and box would have told me as much,â€ said i, â€œfor i knew that
mr. stapleton was a naturalist. but how did you know me?â€

â€œi have been calling on mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from
the window of his surgery as you passed. as our road lay the same way i
thought that i would overtake you and introduce myself. i trust that sir
henry is none the worse for his journey?â€

â€œhe is very well, thank you.â€

â€œwe were all rather afraid that after t

€œwhat a pity! he might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.
but as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which i
can be of service to you i trust that you will command me. if i had
any indication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to
investigate the case, i might perhaps even now give you some aid or
advice.â€

â€œi assure you that i am simply here upon a visit to my friend, sir
henry, and that i need no help of any kind.â€

â€œexcellent!â€ said stapleton. â€œyou are perfectly right to be wary and
discreet. i am justly reproved for what i feel was an unjustifiable
intrusion, and i promise you that i will not mention the matter again.â€

we had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the
road and wound away across the moor. a steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay
upon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.
the face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and
brambles growing in its n

gray plume of smoke.

â€œa moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to merripit house,â€
 said he. â€œperhaps you will spare an hour that i may have the pleasure of
introducing you to my sister.â€

my first thought was that i should be by sir henryâ€™s side. but then i
remembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was
littered. it was certain that i could not help with those. and holmes
had expressly said that i should study the neighbours upon the moor. i
accepted stapletonâ€™s invitation, and we turned together down the path.

â€œit is a wonderful place, the moor,â€ said he, looking round over the
undulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite
foaming up into fantastic surges. â€œyou never tire of the moor. you
cannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. it is so vast, and
so barren, and so mysterious.â€

â€œyou know it well, then?â€

â€œi have only been here two years. the residents would call me a
newcomer. we came shortly afte

you that there would not be the least chance of your coming back alive.
it is only by remembering certain complex landmarks that i am able to do
it.â€

â€œhalloa!â€ i cried. â€œwhat is that?â€

a long, low moan, indescribably sad, swept over the moor. it filled the
whole air, and yet it was impossible to say whence it came. from a
dull murmur it swelled into a deep roar, and then sank back into a
melancholy, throbbing murmur once again. stapleton looked at me with a
curious expression in his face.

â€œqueer place, the moor!â€ said he.

â€œbut what is it?â€

â€œthe peasants say it is the hound of the baskervilles calling for its
prey. iâ€™ve heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.â€

i looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling
plain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. nothing stirred over
the vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor
behind us.

ade him not unlike some huge moth himself.
i was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of admiration for his
extraordinary activity and fear lest he should lose his footing in the
treacherous mire, when i heard the sound of steps and, turning round,
found a woman near me upon the path. she had come from the direction in
which the plume of smoke indicated the position of merripit house, but
the dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.

i could not doubt that this was the miss stapleton of whom i had
been told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and i
remembered that i had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. the
woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.
there could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,
for stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while
she was darker than any brunette whom i have seen in england--slim,
elegant, and tall. she had a proud, finely cut face, so reg

. as i
looked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor
rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon i could not but marvel at what
could have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to
live in such a place.

â€œqueer spot to choose, is it not?â€ said he as if in answer to my
thought. â€œand yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,
beryl?â€

â€œquite happy,â€ said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her
words.

â€œi had a school,â€ said stapleton. â€œit was in the north country. the work
to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but the
privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young minds,
and of impressing them with oneâ€™s own character and ideals was very dear
to me. however, the fates were against us. a serious epidemic broke out
in the school and three of the boys died. it never recovered from the
blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably swallowed up. and yet,
if it were not for the loss of

era? i think it is the most
complete one in the south-west of england. by the time that you have
looked through them lunch will be almost ready.â€

but i was eager to get back to my charge. the melancholy of the moor,
the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
associated with the grim legend of the baskervilles, all these things
tinged my thoughts with sadness. then on the top of these more or less
vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of
miss stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that i could
not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. i resisted
all pressure to stay for lunch, and i set off at once upon my return
journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.

it seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
who knew it, for before i had reached the road i was astounded to see
miss stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. her face
was beautifully flushed with her exert

ions and she held her hand to her
side.

â€œi have run all the way in order to cut you off, dr. watson,â€ said she.
â€œi had not even time to put on my hat. i must not stop, or my brother
may miss me. i wanted to say to you how sorry i am about the stupid
mistake i made in thinking that you were sir henry. please forget the
words i said, which have no application whatever to you.â€

â€œbut i canâ€™t forget them, miss stapleton,â€ said i. â€œi am sir henryâ€™s
friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. tell me why it
was that you were so eager that sir henry should return to london.â€

â€œa womanâ€™s whim, dr. watson. when you know me better you will understand
that i cannot always give reasons for what i say or do.â€

â€œno, no. i remember the thrill in your voice. i remember the look in
your eyes. please, please, be frank with me, miss stapleton, for ever

 do. if you have any influence with sir henry, take him away from
a place which has always been fatal to his family. the world is wide.
why should he wish to live at the place of danger?â€

â€œbecause it is the place of danger. that is sir henryâ€™s nature. i fear
that unless you can give me some more definite information than this it
would be impossible to get him to move.â€

â€œi cannot say anything definite, for i do not know anything definite.â€

â€œi would ask you one more question, miss stapleton. if you meant no
more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your
brother to overhear what you said? there is nothing to which he, or
anyone else, could object.â€

â€œmy brother is very anxious to have the hall inhabited, for he thinks it
is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. he would be very angry
if he knew that i have said anything which might induce sir henry to
go away. but i have done my duty now and i will say no more. i must go
back, or he will miss me

all that time. of course, so far as his concealment goes there is
no difficulty at all. any one of these stone huts would give him a
hiding-place. but there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and
slaughter one of the moor sheep. we think, therefore, that he has gone,
and the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.

we are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take
good care of ourselves, but i confess that i have had uneasy moments
when i have thought of the stapletons. they live miles from any help.
there are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the
latter not a very strong man. they would be helpless in the hands of a
desperate fellow like this notting hill criminal if he could once effect
an entrance. both sir henry and i were concerned at their situation, and
it was suggested that perkins the groom should go over to sleep there,
but stapleton would not hear of it.

the fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a

in. it was an excursion of
some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal that it might
have suggested the story. we found a short valley between rugged tors
which led to an open, grassy space flecked over with the white cotton
grass. in the middle of it rose two great stones, worn and sharpened at
the upper end until they looked like the huge corroding fangs of some
monstrous beast. in every way it corresponded with the scene of the old
tragedy. sir henry was much interested and asked stapleton more
than once whether he did really believe in the possibility of the
interference of the supernatural in the affairs of men. he spoke
lightly, but it was evident that he was very much in earnest. stapleton
was guarded in his replies, but it was easy to see that he said less
than he might, and that he would not express his whole opinion out of
consideration for the feelings of the baronet. he told us of similar
cases, where families had suffered from some evil influence, and he left
us with th

e impression that he shared the popular view upon the matter.

on our way back we stayed for lunch at merripit house, and it was there
that sir henry made the acquaintance of miss stapleton. from the first
moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted by her, and
i am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. he referred to her
again and again on our walk home, and since then hardly a day has passed
that we have not seen something of the brother and sister. they dine
here tonight, and there is some talk of our going to them next week. one
would imagine that such a match would be very welcome to stapleton, and
yet i have more than once caught a look of the stronges

te. by the way, your instructions to me never to allow
sir henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a love
affair were to be added to our other difficulties. my popularity would
soon suffer if i were to carry out your orders to the letter.

the other day--thursday, to be more exact--dr. mortimer lunched with us.
he has been excavating a barrow at long down and has got a prehistoric
skull which fills him with great joy. never was there such a
single-minded enthusiast as he! the stapletons came in afterwards, and
the good doctor took us all to the yew alley at sir henryâ€™s request to
show us exactly how everything occurred upon that fatal night. it is
a long, dismal walk, the yew alley, between two high walls of clipped
hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either side. at the far end is
an old tumble-down summer-house. halfway down is the moor-gate, where
the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. it is a white wooden gate with
a latch. beyond it lies the wide moor. i remembered

oon. there have been decorators
and furnishers up from plymouth, and it is evident that our friend
has large ideas and means to spare no pains or expense to restore the
grandeur of his family. when the house is renovated and refurnished, all
that he will need will be a wife to make it complete. between ourselves
there are pretty clear signs that this will not be wanting if the lady
is willing, for i have seldom seen a man more infatuated with a woman
than he is with our beautiful neighbour, miss stapleton. and yet the
course of true love does not run quite as smoothly as one would under
the circumstances expect. today, for example, its surface was broken
by a very unexpected ripple, which has caused our friend considerable
perplexity and annoyance.

after the conversation which i have quoted about barrymore, sir henry
put on his hat and prepared to go out. as a matter of course i did the
same.

â€œwhat, are you coming, watson?â€ he asked, looking at me in a curious
way.

â€œthat depends on whet

 off at once in
the direction of merripit house.

i hurried along the road at the top of my speed without seeing anything
of sir henry, until i came to the point where the moor path branches
off. there, fearing that perhaps i had come in the wrong direction after
all, i mounted a hill from which i could command a view--the same hill
which is cut into the dark quarry. thence i saw him at once. he was on
the moor path about a quarter of a mile off, and a lady was by his side
who could only be miss stapleton. it was clear that there was already
an understanding between them and that they had met by appointment. they
were walking slowly along in deep conversation, and i saw her making
quick little movements of her hands as if she were very earnest in what
she was saying, while he listened intently, and once or twice shook his
head in strong dissent. i stood among the rocks watching them, very much
puzzled as to what i should do next. to follow them and break into their
intimate conversation seemed t

use, and yet i am sure that
you will agree with me that the position was very difficult, and that
there was nothing more which i could do.

our friend, sir henry, and the lady had halted on the path and were
standing deeply absorbed in their conversation, when i was suddenly
aware that i was not the only witness of their interview. a wisp of
green floating in the air caught my eye, and another glance showed me
that it was carried on a stick by a man who was moving among the broken
ground. it was stapleton with his butterfly-net. he was very much closer
to the pair than i was, and he appeared to be moving in their direction.
at this instant sir henry suddenly drew miss stapleton to his side. his
arm was round her, but it seemed to me that she was straining away from
him with her face averted. he stooped his head to hers, and she raised
one hand as if in protest. next moment i saw them spring apart and turn
hurriedly round. stapleton was the cause of the interruption. he was
running wildly towards

 them, his absurd net dangling behind him. he
gesticulated and almost danced with excitement in front of the lovers.
what the scene meant i could not imagine, but it seemed to me that
stapleton was abusing sir henry, who offered explanations, which became
more angry as the other refused to accept them. the lady stood by in
haughty silence. finally stapleton turned upon his heel and beckoned in
a peremptory way to his sister, who, after an irresolute glance at sir
henry, walked off by the side of her brother. the naturalistâ€™s angry
gestures showed that the lady was included in his displeasure. the
baronet stood for a minute looking after them, and then he walked slowly
back the way that he had come, his head hanging, the very picture of
dejection.

what all this meant i could not imagine, but i was deeply ashamed to
have witnessed so intimate a s

a blow to him and it would take him
some time before he could prepare himself to meet it. he would withdraw
all opposition upon his part if i would promise for three months to let
the matter rest and to be content with cultivating the ladyâ€™s friendship
during that time without claiming her love. this i promised, and so the
matter rests.â€

so there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. it is something to
have touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering.
we know now why stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sisterâ€™s
suitor--even when that suitor was so eligible a one as sir henry. and
now i pass on to another thread which i have extricated out of the
tangled skein, the mystery of the sobs in the night, of the tear-stained
face of mrs. barrymore, of the secret journey of the butler to the
western lattice window. congratulate me, my dear holmes, and tell me
that i have not disappointed you as an agent--that you do not regret
the confidence which you showed in me when

th of the last occupant of the hall,
fulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there
are the repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange
creature upon the moor. twice i have with my own ears heard the sound
which resembled the distant baying of a hound. it is incredible,
impossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of
nature. a spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the
air with its howling is surely not to be thought of. stapleton may
fall in with such a superstition, and mortimer also, but if i have one
quality upon earth it is common sense, and nothing will persuade me to
believe in such a thing. to do so would be to descend to the level of
these poor peasants, who are not content with a mere fiend dog but must
needs describe him with hell-fire shooting from his mouth and eyes.
holmes would not listen to such fancies, and i am his agent. but facts
are facts, and i have twice heard this crying upon the moor. suppose

least was real, but it might have been the work of a protecting friend
as easily as of an enemy. where is that friend or enemy now? has he
remained in london, or has he followed us down here? could he--could he
be the stranger whom i saw upon the tor?

it is true that i have had only the one glance at him, and yet there are
some things to which i am ready to swear. he is no one whom i have seen
down here, and i have now met all the neighbours. the figure was far
taller than that of stapleton, far thinner than that of frankland.
barrymore it might possibly have been, but we had left him behind us,
and i am certain that he could not have followed us. a stranger then is
still dogging us, just as a stranger dogged us in london. we have never
shaken him off. if i could lay my hands upon that man, then at last we
might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. to this one
purpose i must now devote all my energies.

my first impulse was to tell sir henry all my plans. my second a

â€œi didnâ€™t think you would have taken advantage of it, sir henry--indeed
i didnâ€™t.â€

â€œthe man is a public danger. there are lonely houses scattered over the
moor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. you only want to
get a glimpse of his face to see that. look at mr. stapletonâ€™s house,
for example, with no one but himself to defend it. thereâ€™s no safety for
anyone until he is under lock and key.â€

â€œheâ€™ll break into no house, sir. i give you my solemn word upon that.
but he will never trouble anyone in this country again. i assure you,
sir henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have
been made and he will be on his way to south america. for godâ€™s sake,
sir, i beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the
moor. they ha

had married without his consent
and perhaps for one or two other reasons as well. so, between the old
sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.â€

â€œhow does she live?â€

â€œi fancy old frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,
for his own affairs are considerably involved. whatever she may have
deserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. her story
got about, and several of the people here did something to enable her
to earn an honest living. stapleton did for one, and sir charles for
another. i gave a trifle myself. it was to set her up in a typewriting
business.â€

he wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but i managed to satisfy
his curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why
we should take anyone into our confidence. tomorrow morning i shall
find my way to coombe tracey, and if i can see this mrs. laura lyons, of
equivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing

â€œno.â€

â€œhave you ever met him?â€

â€œyes, once or twice, when he came into coombe tracey. he was a very
retiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.â€

â€œbut if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know
enough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has
done?â€

she met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.

â€œthere were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to
help me. one was mr. stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of sir
charlesâ€™s. he was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that sir
charles learned about my affairs.â€

i knew already that sir charles baskerville had made stapleton his
almoner upon several occasions, so the ladyâ€™s statement bore the impress
of truth upon it.

â€œdid you ever write to sir charles asking him to meet you?â€ i continued.

mrs. lyons flushed with anger again. â€œreally, sir, this is a very
extraordinary question.â€

of my task all struck a chill into my heart. the boy was
nowhere to be seen. but down beneath me in a cleft of the hills there
was a circle of the old stone huts, and in the middle of them there
was one which retained sufficient roof to act as a screen against the
weather. my heart leaped within me as i saw it. this must be the burrow
where the stranger lurked. at last my foot was on the threshold of his
hiding place--his secret was within my grasp.

as i approached the hut, walking as warily as stapleton would do when
with poised net he drew near the settled butterfly, i satisfied myself
that the place had indeed been used as a habitation. a vague pathway
among the boulders led to the dilapidated opening which served as a
door. all was silent within. the unknown might be lurking there, or
he might be prowling on the moor. my nerves tingled with the sense of
adventure. throwing aside my cigarette, i closed my hand upon the butt
of my revolver and, walking swiftly up to the door, i looked in. the

inhospitable abode. was he our malignant enemy, or was he by
chance our guardian angel? i swore that i would not leave the hut until
i knew.

outside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet
and gold. its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant
pools which lay amid the great grimpen mire. there were the two towers
of baskerville hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the
village of grimpen. between the two, behind the hill, was the house
of the stapletons. all was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden
evening light, and yet as i looked at them my soul shared none of the
peace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that
interview which every instant was bringing nearer. with tingling nerves
but a fixed purpose, i sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with
sombre patience for the coming of its tenant.

and then at last i heard him. far away came the sharp clink of a boot
striking upon a stone. then another and yet

 dusk was settling over the moor. the air had turned
chill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. there, sitting together
in the twilight, i told holmes of my conversation with the lady. so
interested was he that i had to repeat some of it twice before he was
satisfied.

â€œthis is most important,â€ said he when i had concluded. â€œit fills up a
gap which i had been unable to bridge in this most complex affair. you
are aware, perhaps, that a close intimacy exists between this lady and
the man stapleton?â€

â€œi did not know of a close intimacy.â€

â€œthere can be no doubt about the matter. they meet, they write, there
is a complete understanding between them. now, this puts a very powerful
weapon into our hands. if i could only use it to detach his wife--â€

â€œhis wife?â€

â€œi am giving you some information now, in return for all that you have
given me. the lady who has passed here as miss stapleton is in reality
his wife.â€

the darkness was rising, but much was still hidden by the shadows.

â€œthat is one of the points upon which your own researches have shed a
light. your interview with the lady has cleared the situation very
much. i did not know about a projected divorce between herself and her
husband. in that case, regarding stapleton as an unmarried man, she
counted no doubt upon becoming his wife.â€

â€œand when she is undeceived?â€

â€œwhy, then we may find the lady of service. it must be our first duty
to see her--both of us--tomorrow. donâ€™t you think, watson, that you are
away from your charge rather long? your place should be at baskerville
hall.â€

the last red streaks had faded away in the west and night had settled
upon the moor. a few faint stars were gleaming in a violet sky.

â€œone last question, holmes,â€

 in order to have my case well
rounded and complete, i have thrown away the life of my client. it is
the greatest blow which has befallen me in my career. but how could i
know--how could i know--that he would risk his life alone upon the moor
in the face of all my warnings?â€

â€œthat we should have heard his screams--my god, those screams!--and yet
have been unable to save him! where is this brute of a hound which drove
him to his death? it may be lurking among these rocks at this instant.
and stapleton, where is he? he shall answer for this deed.â€

â€œhe shall. i will see to that. uncle and nephew have been murdered--the
one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast which he thought
to be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his wild flight to
escape from it. but now we have to prove the connection between the
man and the beast. save from what we heard, we cannot even swear to the
existence of the latter, since sir henry has evidently died from the
fall. but, by heavens, cunn

od with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,
overwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought
all our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. then as the moon
rose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had
fallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half
silver and half gloom. far away, miles off, in the direction of grimpen,
a single steady yellow light was shining. it could only come from the
lonely abode of the stapletons. with a bitter curse i shook my fist at
it as i gazed.

â€œwhy should we not seize him at once?â€

â€œour case is not complete. the fellow is wary and cunning to the last
degree. it is not what we know, but what we can prove. if we make one
false move the villain may escape us yet.â€

â€œwhat can we do?â€

â€œthere will be plenty for us to do tomorrow. tonight we can only perform
the last offices to our poor friend.â€

together we made our way down the precipitous slope and approached the

convict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture
by screaming wildly for help. by his cries he must have run a long way
after he knew the animal was on his track. how did he know?â€

â€œa greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our
conjectures are correct--â€

â€œi presume nothing.â€

â€œwell, then, why this hound should be loose tonight. i suppose that it
does not always run loose upon the moor. stapleton would not let it go
unless he had reason to think that sir henry would be there.â€

â€œmy difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for i think that we
shall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain
forever a mystery. the question now is, what shall we do with this poor
wretchâ€™s body? we cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.â€

â€œi suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate
with the police.â€

â€œexactly. i have no doubt that

wondering if there were any evidence of such a sound tonight.â€

â€œwe heard nothing of the kind,â€ said i.

â€œand what is your theory of this poor fellowâ€™s death?â€

â€œi have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his head.
he has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually fallen over
here and broken his neck.â€

â€œthat seems the most reasonable theory,â€ said stapleton, and he gave a
sigh which i took to indicate his relief. â€œwhat do you think about it,
mr. sherlock holmes?â€

my friend bowed his compliments. â€œyou are quick at identification,â€ said
he.

â€œwe have been expecting you in these parts since dr. watson came down.
you are in time to see a tragedy.â€

â€œyes, indeed. i have no doubt that my friendâ€™s explanation will cover
the facts. i will take an unpleasant remembrance back to london with me
tomorrow.â€

â€œoh, you return tomorrow?â€

â

€œthat is my intention.â€

â€œi hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which have
puzzled us?â€

holmes shrugged his shoulders.

â€œone cannot always have the success for which one hopes. an investigator
needs facts and not legends or rumours. it has not been a satisfactory
case.â€

my friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. stapleton
still looked hard at him. then he turned to me.

â€œi would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would
give my sister such a fright that i do not feel justified in doing it.
i think that if we put something over his face he will be safe until
morning.â€

and so it was arranged. resisting stapletonâ€™s offer of hospitality,
holmes and i set off to baskerville hall, leaving the naturalist to
return alone. looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the
broad moor, and

well. sufficient for tomorrow is the evil thereof; but i hope before the
day is past to have the upper hand at last.â€

i could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,
as far as the baskerville gates.

â€œare you coming up?â€

â€œyes; i see no reason for further concealment. but one last word,
watson. say nothing of the hound to sir henry. let him think that
seldenâ€™s death was as stapleton would have us believe. he will have a
better nerve for the ordeal which he will have to undergo tomorrow,
when he is engaged, if i remember your report aright, to dine with these
people.â€

â€œand so am i.â€

â€œthen you must excuse yourself and he must go alone. that will be easily
arranged. and now, if we are too late for dinner, i think that we are
both ready for our suppers.â€

sir henry was more pleased than surprised to see sherlock holmes, for he
had for some days been expecting that

â€œiâ€™ve been moping in the house all day since watson went off in the
morning,â€ said the baronet. â€œi guess i should have some credit, for i
have kept my promise. if i hadnâ€™t sworn not to go about alone i might
have had a more lively evening, for i had a message from stapleton
asking me over there.â€

â€œi have no doubt that you would have had a more lively evening,â€ said
holmes drily. â€œby the way, i donâ€™t suppose you appreciate that we have
been mourning over you as having broken your neck?â€

sir henry opened his eyes. â€œhow was that?â€

â€œthis poor wretch was dressed in your clothes. i fear your servant who
gave them to him may get into trouble with the police.â€

â€œthat is unlikely. there was no mark on any of them, as far as i know.â€

â€œthere is something of sir henry about the jaw.â€

â€œjust a suggestion, perhaps. but wait an instant!â€ he stood upon a
chair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right
arm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.

â€œgood heavens!â€ i cried in amazement.

the face of stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.

â€œha, you see it now. my eyes have been trained to examine faces and not
their trimmings. it is the first quality of a criminal investigator that
he should see through a disguise.â€

â€œbut this is marvellous. it might be his portrait.â€

â€œgood-morning, holmes,â€ said the baronet. â€œyou look like a general who
is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.â€

â€œthat is the exact situation. watson was asking for orders.â€

â€œand so do i.â€

â€œvery good. you are engaged, as i understand, to dine with our friends
the stapletons tonight.â€

â€œi hope that you will come also. they are very hospitable people, and i
am sure that they would be very glad to see you.â€

â€œi fear that watson and i must go to london.â€

â€œto london?â€

â€œyes, i think that we should be more useful there at the present
juncture.â€

the baronetâ€™s face perceptibly lengthened.

â€œi hoped that you were going to see me through this business. the hall
and the moor are not very pleasant places when one is alone.â€

â€œmy dear fellow, you m

 town. we
hope very soon to return to devonshire. will you remember to give them
that message?â€

â€œif you insist upon it.â€

â€œthere is no alternative, i assure you.â€

i saw by the baronetâ€™s clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he
regarded as our desertion.

â€œwhen do you desire to go?â€ he asked coldly.

â€œimmediately after breakfast. we will drive in to coombe tracey, but
watson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.
watson, you will send a note to stapleton to tell him that you regret
that you cannot come.â€

â€œi have a good mind to go to london with you,â€ said the baronet. â€œwhy
should i stay here alone?â€

â€œbecause it is your post of duty. because you gave me your word that you
would do as you were told, and i tell you to stay.â€

â€œall right, then, iâ€™ll stay.â€

â€œone more direction! i wish you to drive to merripit house. send back
your trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.â€

â€œto walk across the moor?â

t is essential that
you should do it.â€

â€œthen i will do it.â€

â€œand as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction
save along the straight path which leads from merripit house to the
grimpen road, and is your natural way home.â€

â€œi will do just what you say.â€

â€œvery good. i should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as
possible, so as to reach london in the afternoon.â€

i was much astounded by this programme, though i remembered that holmes
had said to stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate
next day. it had not crossed my mind however, that he would wish me to
go with him, nor could i understand how we could both be absent at a
moment which he himself declared to be critical. there was nothing for
it, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful
friend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of
coombe tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. a
small boy was waiting upon the

the boy returned with a telegram, which holmes handed to me. it ran:

lestrade.

â€œthat is in answer to mine of this morning. he is the best of the
professionals, i think, and we may need his assistance. now, watson, i
think that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your
acquaintance, mrs. laura lyons.â€

his plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. he would use the
baronet in order to convince the stapletons that we were really gone,
while we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to
be needed. that telegram from london, if mentioned by sir henry to the
stapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. already i
seemed to see our nets drawing closer around that leanjawed pike.

mrs. laura lyons was in her office, and sherlock holmes opened his
interview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.

â€œi am investigating the circumstances which atten

which shines so brightly?â€

â€œthat is certainly the dining-room.â€

â€œthe blinds are up. you know the lie of the land best. creep forward
quietly and see what they are doing--but for heavenâ€™s sake donâ€™t let
them know that they are watched!â€

i tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded
the stunted orchard. creeping in its shadow i reached a point whence i
could look straight through the uncurtained window.

there were only two men in the room, sir henry and stapleton. they sat
with their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. both
of them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.
stapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and
distrait. perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened
moor was weighing heavily upon his mind.

as i watched them stapleton rose and left the room, while sir henry
filled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his
cigar. i heard the creak o

ber which spanned the roof. to this post a
figure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been
used to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it
was that of a man or a woman. one towel passed round the throat and was
secured at the back of the pillar. another covered the lower part of
the face, and over it two dark eyes--eyes full of grief and shame and a
dreadful questioning--stared back at us. in a minute we had torn off
the gag, unswathed the bonds, and mrs. stapleton sank upon the floor in
front of us. as her beautiful head fell upon her chest i saw the clear
red weal of a whiplash across her neck.

â€œthe brute!â€ cried holmes. â€œhere, lestrade, your brandy-bottle! put her
in the chair! she has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.â€

she opened her eyes again.

â€œis he safe?â€ she asked. â€œhas he escaped?â€

â€œhe cannot escape us, madam.â€

â€œno, no, i did not mean my husband. sir henry? is he safe?â€

â€œyes.â€

â€œand the hound?â€

â€œhe may find his way in, but never out,â€ she cried. â€œhow can he see the
guiding wands tonight? we planted them together, he and i, to mark the
pathway through the mire. oh, if i could only have plucked them out
today. then indeed you would have had him at your mercy!â€

it was evident to us that all pursuit was in vain until the fog had
lifted. meanwhile we left lestrade in possession of the house while
holmes and i went back with the baronet to baskerville hall. the story
of the stapletons could no longer be withheld from him, but he took
the blow bravely when he learned the truth about the woman whom he had
loved. but the shock of the nightâ€™s adventures had shattered his nerves,
and before morning he lay delirious in a high fever under the care of
dr. mortimer. the two of them were destined to travel together round the
world before sir henry had become once more the hale, hearty man that he
had been before he became master of that ill-omened estate.

and now i come rapidly to

 the conclusion of this singular narrative, in
which i have tried to make the reader share those dark fears and vague
surmises which clouded our lives so long and ended in so tragic a
manner. on the morning after the death of the hound the fog had lifted
and we were guided by mrs. stapleton to the point where they had found
a pathway through the bog. it helped us to realize the horror of this
womanâ€™s life when we saw the eagerness and joy with which she laid us
on her husbandâ€™s track. we left her standing upon the thin peninsula of
firm, peaty soil which tapered out into the widespread bog. from the
end of it a small wand planted here and there showed where the path
zigzagged from tuft to tuft of rushes among those green-scummed pits
and foul quagmires which barred the way to

ed that perilous way before us. from amid a tuft of cotton grass
which bore it up out of the slime some dark thing was projecting. holmes
sank to his waist as he stepped from the path to seize it, and had we
not been there to drag him out he could never have set his foot
upon firm land again. he held an old black boot in the air. â€œmeyers,
toronto,â€ was printed on the leather inside.

â€œit is worth a mud bath,â€ said he. â€œit is our friend sir henryâ€™s missing
boot.â€

â€œthrown there by stapleton in his flight.â€

â€œexactly. he retained it in his hand after using it to set the hound
upon the track. he fled when he knew the game was up, still clutching
it. and he hurled it away at this point of his flight. we know at least
that he came so far in safety.â€

but more than that we were never destined to know, though there was much
which we might surmise. there was no chance of finding footsteps in the
mire, for the rising mud oozed swiftly in upon them, but as we at last
reached firmer g

but no slightest sign of them ever met our eyes. if the earth told a
true story, then stapleton never reached that island of refuge towards
which he struggled through the fog upon that last night. somewhere in
the heart of the great grimpen mire, down in the foul slime of the
huge morass which had sucked him in, this cold and cruel-hearted man is
forever buried.

many traces we found of him in the bog-girt island where he had hid his
savage ally. a huge driving-wheel and a shaft half-filled with rubbish
showed the position of an abandoned mine. beside it were the crumbling
remains of the

 overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would not
be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past. sir
henry and dr. mortimer were, however, in london, on their way to that
long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his
shattered nerves. they had called upon us that very afternoon, so that
it was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.

â€œthe whole course of events,â€ said holmes, â€œfrom the point of view of
the man who called himself stapleton was simple and direct, although
to us, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of
his actions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared
exceedingly complex. i have had the advantage of two conversations with
mrs. stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that i
am not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.
you will find a few notes upon the matter under the heading b in my
indexed list of cases.â€

 money, he changed his name to vandeleur and
fled to england, where he established a school in the east of yorkshire.
his reason for attempting this special line of business was that he had
struck up an acquaintance with a consumptive tutor upon the voyage
home, and that he had used this manâ€™s ability to make the undertaking a
success. fraser, the tutor, died however, and the school which had begun
well sank from disrepute into infamy. the vandeleurs found it convenient
to change their name to stapleton, and he brought the remains of his
fortune, his schemes for the future, and his taste for entomology to
the south of england. i learned at the british museum that he was a
recognized authority upon the subject, and that the name of vandeleur
has been permanently attached to a certain moth which he had, in his
yorkshire days, been the first to describe.

â€œwe now come to that portion of his life which has proved to be of such
intense interest to us. the fellow had evidently made inquiry and fou

as clearly already in his mind, though he may not
have been certain how the details of his plot were to be arranged. he
meant in the end to have the estate, and he was ready to use any tool
or run any risk for that end. his first act was to establish himself as
near to his ancestral home as he could, and his second was to cultivate
a friendship with sir charles baskerville and with the neighbours.

â€œthe baronet himself told him about the family hound, and so prepared
the way for his own death. stapleton, as i will continue to call him,
knew that the old manâ€™s heart was weak and that a shock would kill him.
so much he had learned from dr. mortimer. he had heard also that sir
charles was superstitious and had taken this grim legend very seriously.
his ingenious mind instantly suggested a way by which the baronet could
be done to death, and yet it would be hardly possible to bring home the
guilt to the real murderer.

was the strongest and most savage in their possession. he brought it
down by the north devon line and walked a great distance over the moor
so as to get it home without exciting any remarks. he had already on his
insect hunts learned to penetrate the grimpen mire, and so had found a
safe hiding-place for the creature. here he kennelled it and waited his
chance.

â€œbut it was some time coming. the old gentleman could not be decoyed
outside of his grounds at night. several times stapleton lurked about
with his hound, but without avail. it was during these fruitless quests
that he, or rather his ally, was seen by peasants, and that the legend
of the demon dog received a new confirmation. he had hoped that his wife
might lure sir charles to his ruin, but here she proved unexpectedly
independent. she would not endeavour to entangle the old gentleman in
a sentimental attachment which might deliver him over to his enemy.
threats and even, i am sorry to say, blows refused to move her.

would have nothing to do with it, and for a time stapleton was at a
deadlock.

â€œhe found a way out of his difficulties through the chance that sir
charles, who had conceived a friendship for him, made him the minister
of his charity in the case of this unfortunate woman, mrs. laura lyons.
by representing himself as a single man he acquired complete influence
over her, and he gave her to understand that in the event of her
obtaining a divorce from her husband he would marry her. his plans were
suddenly brought to a head by his knowledge that sir charl

the authorities, alarmed the countryside, and finally brought the case
within the scope of our observation.

â€œso much for the death of sir charles baskerville. you perceive the
devilish cunning of it, for really it would be almost impossible to make
a case against the real murderer. his only accomplice was one who could
never give him away, and the grotesque, inconceivable nature of
the device only served to make it more effective. both of the women
concerned in the case, mrs. stapleton and mrs. laura lyons, were left
with a strong suspicion against stapleton. mrs. stapleton knew that he
had designs upon the old man, and also of the existence of the hound.
mrs. lyons knew neither of these things, but had been impressed by the
death occurring at the time of an uncancelled appointment which was only
known to him. however, both of them were under his influence, and he had
nothing to fear from them. the first half of his task was successfully
accomplished but the more difficult st

ill remained.

â€œit is possible that stapleton did not know of the existence of an heir
in canada. in any case he would very soon learn it from his friend dr.
mortimer, and he was told by the latter all details about the arrival of
henry baskerville. stapletonâ€™s first idea was that this young stranger
from canada might possibly be done to death in london without coming
down to devonshire at all. he distrusted his wife ever since she had
refused to help him in laying a trap for the old man, and he dared not
leave her long out of his sight for fear he should lose his influence
over her. it was for this reason that he took her to london with him.
they lodged, i find, at the mexborough private hotel, in craven street,
which was actually one of those ca

f his plans; but she had such a fear of her husband--a
fear founded upon brutal ill-treatment--that she dare not write to warn
the man whom she knew to be in danger. if the letter should fall into
stapletonâ€™s hands her own life would not be safe. eventually, as we
know, she adopted the expedient of cutting out the words which would
form the message, and addressing the letter in a disguised hand. it
reached the baronet, and gave him the first warning of his danger.

â€œit was very essential for stapleton to get some article of sir henryâ€™s
attire so that, in case he was driven to use the dog, he might always
have the means of setting him upon his track. with characteristic
promptness and audacity he set about this at once, and we cannot doubt
that the boots or chamber-maid of the hotel was well bribed to help him
in his design. by chance, however, the first boot which was procured for
him was a new one and, therefore, useless for his purpose. he then had
it returned and obtained another--a mos

proved conclusively to my mind that we were dealing with a real hound,
as no other supposition could explain this anxiety to obtain an old
boot and this indifference to a new one. the more outre and grotesque an
incident is the more carefully it deserves to be examined, and the very
point which appears to complicate a case is, when duly considered and
scientifically handled, the one which is most likely to elucidate it.

â€œthen we had the visit from our friends next morning, shadowed always
by stapleton in the cab. from his knowledge of our rooms and of my
appearance, as well as from his general conduct, i am inclined to think
that stapletonâ€™s career of crime has been by no means limited to this
single baskerville affair. it is suggestive that during the last three
years there have been four considerable burglaries in the west country,
for none of which was any criminal ever arrested. the last of these, at
folkestone court, in may, was remarkable for the cold-blooded pistolling
of the page,

who surprised the masked and solitary burglar. i cannot
doubt that stapleton recruited his waning resources in this fashion, and
that for years he has been a desperate and dangerous man.

â€œwe had an example of his readiness of resource that morning when he got
away from us so successfully, and also of his audacity in sending back
my own name to me through the cabman. from that moment he understood
that i had taken over the case in london, and that therefore there was
no chance for him there. he returned to dartmoor and awaited the arrival
of the baronet.â€

â€œone mo

ment!â€ said i. â€œyou have, no doubt, described the sequence
of events correctly, but there is one point which you have left
unexplained. what became of the hound when its master was in london?â€

â€œi have given some attention to this matter and it is undoubtedly of
importance. there can be no question that stapleton had a confidant,
though it is unlikely that he ever placed himself in his power by
sharing all his plans with him. there was an old manservant at merripit
house, whose name was anthony. his connection with the stapletons can
be traced for several years, as far back as the school-mastering days,
so that he must have been aware that his master and mistress were really
husband and wife. this man has disappeared and has escaped from the
country. it is suggestive that anthony is not a common name in
 
 ___________________________
 
 england,
while antonio is so in all spanish or spanish-american countries. the
man, like mrs. stapleton herself, spoke good english, but with a curious
lisping accent. i have myself seen this old man cross the grimpen
mire by the path which stapleton had marked out. it is very probable,
therefore, that in the absence of his master it was he who cared for the
hound, though he may never have known the purpose for which the beast
was used.

â€œthe stapletons then went down to devonshire, whither they were soon
followed by sir henry and you. one word now as to how i stood myself at
that time. it may possibly recur to your memory that when i examined
the paper upon which the printed words were fastened i made a close
inspection for the water-mark. in doing so i held it within a few inches
of my eyes, and was conscious of a faint smell of the scent known as
white jessamine. there are seventy-five perfumes, which it is very
necessary that a criminal e
 
 ___________________________
 
xpert should be able to distinguish from each
other, and cases have more than once within my own experience depended
upon their prompt recognition. the scent suggested the presence of a
lady, and already my thoughts began to turn towards the stapletons. thus
i had made certain of the hound, and had guessed at the criminal before
ever we went to the west country.

â€œit was my game to watch stapleton. it was evident, however, that i
could not do this if i were with you, since he would be keenly on his
guard. i deceived everybody, therefore, yourself included, and i came
down secretly when i was supposed to be in london. my hardships were
not so great as you imagined, though such trifling details must never
interfere with the investigation of a case. i stayed for the most
part at coombe tracey, and only used the hut upon the moor when it was
necessary to be near the scene of action. cartwrig

me, and in his disguise as a country boy he was of great assistance
to me. i was dependent upon him for food and clean linen. when i was
watching stapleton, cartwright was frequently watching you, so that i
was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.

â€œi have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being
forwarded instantly from baker street to coombe tracey. they were of
great service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece
of biography of stapletonâ€™s. i was able to establish the identity of
the man and the woman and knew at last exactly how i stood. the case
had been considerably complicated through the i

convict and the relations between him and the barrymores. this also you
cleared up in a very effective way, though i had already come to the
same conclusions from my own observations.

â€œby the time that you discovered me upon the moor i had a complete
knowledge of the whole business, but i had not a case which could go to
a jury. even stapletonâ€™s attempt upon sir henry that night which ended
in the death of the unfortunate convict did not help us much in proving
murder against our man. there seemed to be no alternative but to
catch him red-handed, and to do so we had to use sir henry, alone and
apparently unprotected, as a bait. we did so, and at the cost of a
severe shock to our client we succeeded in completing our case and
driving stapleton to his destruction. that sir henry should have been
exposed to this is, i must confess, a

t such short notice. we succeeded in our
object at a cost which both the specialist and dr. mortimer assure me
will be a temporary one. a long journey may enable our friend to recover
not only from his shattered nerves but also from his wounded feelings.
his love for the lady was deep and sincere, and to him the saddest part
of all this black business was that he should have been deceived by her.

â€œit only remains to indicate the part which she had played throughout.
there can be no doubt that stapleton exercised an influence over her
which may have been love or may have been fear, or very possibly both,
since they are by no means incompatible emotions. it was, at least,
absolutely effective. at his command she consented to pass as his
sister, though he found the limits of his power over her when he
endeavoured to make her the direct accessory to murder. she was ready to
warn sir henry so far as she could without implicating her husband, and
again and again she tried to do so. stapleton himsel

ar watson, without
referring to my notes, i cannot give you a more detailed account of
this curious case. i do not know that anything essential has been left
unexplained.â€

â€œhe could not hope to frighten sir henry to death as he had done the old
uncle with his bogie hound.â€

â€œthe beast was savage and half-starved. if its appearance did not
frighten its victim to death, at least it would paralyze the resistance
which might be offered.â€

â€œno doubt. there only remains one difficulty. if stapleton came into the
succession, how could he explain the fact that he, the heir, had been
living unannounced under another name so close to the property? how
could he claim it without causing suspicion and inquiry?â€

â€œit is a formidable difficulty, and i fear that you ask too much when
you expect me to solve it. the past and the present are within the field
of my inquiry, but what a man may do in the future is a hard question
to answer. mrs. stapleton has heard her husband discuss the problem on
