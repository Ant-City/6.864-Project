say it?" inquired joseph poorgrass.
"terrible trying," said oak. "i've been wet through
twice a-day, either in snow or rain, this last fortnight.
cainy and i haven't tined our eyes to-night."
"a good few twins, too, i hear?"
"too many by half. yes; 'tis a very queer lambing
this year. we shan't have done by lady day."
"and last year 'twer all over by sexajessamine
sunday." joseph remarked.
"bring on the rest cain." said gabriel, " and then run
back to the ewes. i'll follow you soon."
cainy ball -- a cheery-faced young lad, with a small
circular orifice by way of mouth, advanced and deposited
two others, and retired as he was bidden. oak lowered
the lambs from their unnatural elevation, wrapped them
in hay, and placed them round the fire.
"we've no lambing-hut here, as i used to have at
norcombe." said gabriel, " and 'tis such a plague to bring
the weakly ones to a house. if 'twasn't for your place
here, malter, i don't know what i should do! this keen
weather. and how is it w

ming all went on
well. unfortunately for her boy, his best friends died;
and he got then a situation as second clerk at a lawyer's
in casterbridge. he stayed there for some time, and
might have worked himself into a dignified position of
some sort had he not indulged in the wild freak of
enlisting. i have much doubt if ever little fanny will
surprise us in the way she mentions -- very much doubt
a silly girl! -- silly girl!"
the door was hurriedly burst open again, and in
came running cainy ball out of breath, his mouth red
and open, like the bell of a penny trumpet, from which
he coughed with noisy vigour and great distension of face.
"now, cain ball." said oak, sternly, "why will you
run so fast and lose your breath so? i'm always telling
you of it."
"oh -- i -- a puff of mee breath -- went -- the -- wrong
way, please, mister oak, and made me cough -- hok --
hok!"
"well --  what have you come for?"
"i've run to tell ye." said the junior shepherd,

and trackless plantations, where- everything seems -help-

boldwood, looking into the distant meadows, saw
there three figures. they were those of miss everdene,
shepherd oak, and cainy ball.
when bathsheba's figure shone upon the farmer's
eyes it lighted him up as the moon lights up a great
tower. a man's body is as the shell; or the tablet, of
his soul, as he is reserved or ingenuous, overflowing or
self-contained. there was a  change in boldwood's
exterior from its former impassibleness; and his face
showed that he was now living outside his defences
for the first time, and with a fearful sense of exposure.
it is the usual experience of strong natures when they
love.

lling about upon the green. the meek sheep
were pushed into the pool by coggan and matthew
moon, who stood by the lower hatch, immersed to their
waists; then gabriel, who stood on the brink, thrust
them under as they swam along, with an instrument
like a crutch, formed for the purpose, and also for
assisting the exhausted animals when the wool became
saturated and they began to sink. they were let out
against the stream, and through the upper opening, all
impurities flowing away below. cainy ball and joseph,
who performed this latter operation, were if possible
wetter than the rest; they resembled dolphins under a
fountain, every protuberance and angle of their clothes
dribbling forth a small rill.
boldwood came close and bade her good-morning, with
such constraint that she could not but think he had
stepped across to the washing for its own sake, hoping
not to find her there; more, she fancied his brow severe
and his eye slighting. bathsheba immediately contrived
to withdraw,

gabriel oak at the bottom of her garden, grinding his
shears for the sheep-shearing. all the surrounding
cottages were more or less scenes of the same operation;
the scurr of whetting spread into the sky from all parts
of the village as from an armury previous to a campaign.
peace and war kiss each other at their hours of prepara-
tion -- sickles, scythes, shears, and pruning-hooks, ranking
with swords, bayonets, and lances, in their common
necessity for point and edge.
cainy ball turned the handle of gabriel's grindstone,
his head performing a melancholy see-saw up and down
with each turn of the wheel. oak stood somewhat as
eros is represented when in the act of sharpening his
arrows: his figure slightly bent, the weight of his body
thrown over on the shears, and his head balanced side-
ways, with a critical compression of the lips and contrac-
tion of the eyelids to crown the attitude.
his mistress came up and looked upon them in
silence for a minute or two; t

 remark; but to oak, who "knew bathsheba to be
well aware that she herself was the cause of the poor
ewe's wound, because she had wounded the ewe's shearer
in a -- still more vital part, it had a sting which the abiding
sense of his inferiority to both herself and boldwood was
not calculated to heal. but a manly resolve to recognize
boldly that he had no longer a lover's interest in her,
helped him occasionally to conceal a feeling.
"bottle!" he shouted, in an unmoved voice of routine.
cainy ball ran up, the wound was anointed, and the
shearing continued.
boldwood gently tossed bathsheba into the saddle,
and before they turned away she again spoke out to oak
with the same dominative and tantalizing graciousness.
"i am going now to see mr. boldwood's leicesters.
take my place in the barn, gabriel, and keep the men
carefully to their work."
the horses' heads were put about, and they trotted
away.
boldwood's deep attachment was a matter of great
interest among all around him; bu

ucated comrades, that day
would see boldwood the accepted husband of miss
everdene. gabriel at this time of his life had out-
grown the instinctive dislike which every christian
boy has for reading the bible, perusing it now quite
frequently, and he inwardly said, "i find more bitter
than death the woman whose heart is snares and
nets!" this was mere exclamation -- the froth of the
storm. he adored bathsheba just the same.
"we workfolk shall have some lordly- junketing
to-night." said cainy ball, casting forth his thoughts in
a new direction. "this morning i see'em making the
great puddens in the milking-pails -- lumps of fat as big
as yer thumb, mister oak! i've never seed such
splendid large knobs of fat before in the days of my
life -- they never used to be bigger then a horse-bean.
and there was a great black crock upon the brandish
with his legs a-sticking out, but i don't know what was
in within."
"and there's two bushels of biffins for apple-pies,"
said maryann.
"well

 see our mis'ess
and a soldier -- a-ha-a-wk!"
"damn the boy!" said gabriel.
"'tis only my manner, mister oak, if ye'll excuse it,"
said cain ball, looking reproachfully at oak, with eyes
drenched in their own dew.
!here's some cider for him -- that'll cure his throat,"
said jan coggan, lifting a flagon of cider, pulling out
the cork, and applying the hole to cainy's mouth;
joseph poorgrass in the meantime beginning to think
apprehensively of the serious consequences that would
follow cainy ball's strangulation in his cough, and the
history of his bath adventures dying with him.
"for my poor self, i always say "please god" afore
i do anything." said joseph, in an unboastful voice; "and
so should you, cain ball. "'tis a great safeguard, and
might perhaps save you from being choked to death
some day."
mr. coggan poured the liquor with unstinted liber-
ality at the suffering cain's circular mouth; half of it
running down the side of the flagon, and half of what
reached his mouth
