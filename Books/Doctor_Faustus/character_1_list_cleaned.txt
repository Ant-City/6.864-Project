[CHARACTER]  - 
a devil whom faustus summons with his initial magical
experiments. [CHARACTER]'s motivations are ambiguous: on the
one hand, his oft-expressed goal is to catch faustus's soul and
carry it off to hell; on the other hand, he actively attempts to
dissuade faustus from making a deal with lucifer by warning him
about the horrors of hell. [CHARACTER] is ultimately as tragic
a figure as faustus, with his moving, regretful accounts of what
the devils have lost in their eternal separation from god and his
repeated reflections on the pain that comes with damnation.
