and each night as we sat around out fires we wondered if the next sun would bring him home.
but the spring came and left and the sea was empty. kimki did not return!
there were few storms that winter and rain was light and ended early. this meant that we would need to be careful of water.
in the old days the springs sometimes ran low and no one worried, but now everything seemed to cause alarm. many were
afraid that we would die of thirst.
'there are other things more important to ponder,' said matasaip who had taken kimki's place.
matasaip meant the aleuts, for it was now the time of year when they had come before. watchers on the cliff began to look
for the red sails and a meeting was held to plan what to do if the aleuts came. we lacked the men to keep them from landing
or to save our lives if they attacked us, which we were certain they would. plans were therefore made to flee as soon as their
ship was sighted.
food and water were stored in canoes and these were hidden on the rocks at the

a catalina.
although the entrance to coral cove was too narrow for a ship to pass through safely at night, men were sent there to watch
the cove from dusk to dawn, besides those who watched during the day.
shortly afterwards, on a night of fine moon, one of the men came running back to the village. everyone was asleep, but his
cries quickly awakened us.
'the aleuts !' he shouted. 'the aleuts!'
it was news we expected. we were prepared for it, yet there was much fear in the village of ghalas-at. matasaip strode from
hut to hut telling everyone to be calm and not to lose time packing things that would not be needed. i took my skirt of yucca
fibre, however, for i had spent many days making it and it was very pretty, and also my otter cape.
quietly we filed out of the village along the trail that led towards the place where our canoes were hidden. the moon was
growing pale and there was a faint light in the east, but a strong wind began to blow. 
we had gone no farther than half a league when we w

ere overtaken by the man who had given the warning. he spoke to
matasaip, but we all gathered around to listen to him.
'i went back to the cove after i gave the alarm, he said. ‘when i got there i could see the ship clearly. it is beyond the rocks
that guard the harbour. it is a smaller ship than the one which belonged to the aleuts. the sails are white instead of red.'
'could you see anyone?' matasaip asked.
‘no.’
'it is not the same ship which was here last spring ?'
'no.’
matasaip was silent, pondering the news. then he told us to go on to where the canoes were and wait for him, for he was
going back. it was light now and we went quickly over the dunes to the edge of the cliff and stood there while the sun rose.
the wind grew cold, but fearing that those on the ship would see the smoke we did not start a fire, though we had meal to
cook for breakfast. instead we ate a small quantity of dried abalone, and afterwards my brother ramo climbed over the cliff.
no one had been

down to the rocks since the canoes were hidden so we did not know whether they were still safe or not.
while he was gone we saw a man running across the dunes. it was nanko, carrying a message from matasaip. he was
swearing in spite, of the cold and he stood trying to catch his breath. we all waited, urging him to talk, but his face was happy
and we knew that he brought good news.
'speak!' everyone said in a chorus.
'i have been running for more than a league,' he said. ‘i cannot talk.'
'you are talking,' someone said.
'speak, nanko, speak,' cried many voices.
nanko was having fun with us. he threw out his chest and took a deep breath. he looked around at the circle of faces as if he 
did not un

for it.
the ship was anchored outside the cove and nanko said that it could not come closer to the shore because of the high waves.
they were beating against the rocks with the sound of thunder. the shore as far as i could see was rimmed with foam.
two boats were pulled up on the beach. beside them stood four white men and as we came down the trail, one of the men
beckoned us to walk faster. he spoke to us in a language which we could not understand.
the men of our tribe, except nanko and chief matasaip, were already on the ship. my brother ramo was there too, nanko
said. he had run on ahead after i had told him that he could not go back to the village for his spear. nanko said that he had
jumped into the first boat that left the cove. 
matasaip divided the women into two groups. then the boats were pushed into the water, and while they bobbed about we
scrambled into them as best we could.
the cove was partly sheltered from the wind, but as soon as we went through the passage between the rocks

repeated what he had told me on the beach, but as he spoke ulape who stood beside him pointed towards the island. i
looked out across the deck and the sea. there, running along the cliff, the fishing spear held over his head, was ramo.
the sails had filled and the ship was now moving slowly away. everyone was looking towards the cliff, even the white men. i
ran to one of them and pointed, but he shook his head and turned from me. the ship began to move faster. against my will, i
screamed.
chief matasaip grasped my arm.
'we cannot wait for ramo,' he said. 'if we' do, the ship will be driven on the rocks.'
'we must!' i shouted. 'we must!'
'the ship will come back for him on another day, matasaip said. 'he will be safe. there is food for him to eat and water to 
drink and places to sleep.
'no,' i cried.
matasaip's face was like stone. he was not listening. i cried out once more, but my voice was lost in the howling wind.
people gathered around me, saying again what matasaip had said, yet i was no

ramo could put the canoe in the water and get through
the tides that raced around the sandpits, he would reach the harbour when the sun was tall in the sky. i would be waiting on
the beach, for what was the fun of a voyage if no one were there to greet him !
i put ramo out of my mind as i searched the rocks for mussels. i thought of the food we would need to gather and how best
to protect it from the wild dogs when we were not in the village. i thought also of the ship. i tried to remember what matasaip
had said to me. for the first time i began to wonder if the ship would ever return. i wondered about this as i pried the shells
off the rocks, and i would stop and look fearfully at the empty sea that stretched away farther than my eyes could reach.
the sun moved higher. there was no sign of ramo. i began to feel uneasy. the basket was filled and i carried it up to the 
mesa.
from here i looked down on the harbour and farther on along the coast to the spit that thrust out like a fishhook into t

was a whale spouting. during those summer days i saw nothing else.
the first storm of winter ended my hopes. if the white men's ship were coming for me it would have come during the time of
good weather. now i would have to wait until winter was gone, maybe longer.
the thought of being alone on the island while so many suns rose from the sea and went slowly back into the sea filled my
heart with loneliness. i had not felt so lonely before because i was sure that the ship would return as matasaip had said it
would. now my hopes were dead. now i was really alone. i could not eat much, nor could i sleep without dreaming terrible
dreams.
the storm blew out of the north, sending big waves against the island and winds so strong that i was unable to stay on the
rock. i moved my bed to the foot of the rock and for protection kept a fire going throughout the night. i slept there five times.
the first night the dogs came and stood outside the ring made by the fire. i killed three of them with ar
