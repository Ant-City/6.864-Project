 swords, and that one knight turned on them
   knightly again and defended him. truly, said
   sir launcelot, yonder one knight shall i help,
   for it were shame for me to see three knights
   on one, and if he be slain i am partner of his
   death.  and therewith he took his harness and
   went out at a window by a sheet down to the four
   knights, and then sir launcelot said on high,
   turn you knights unto me, and leave your
   fighting with that knight. and then they all
   three left sir kay, and turned unto sir launcelot,
   and there began great battle, for they alight
   all three, and strake many strokes at sir
   launcelot, and assailed him on every side. then
   sir kay dressed him for to have holpen sir
   launcelot.  nay, sir, said he, i will none of
   your help, therefore as ye will have my help
   let me alone with them.  sir kay for the pleasure
   of the knight suffered him for to do his will,
   and so stood aside. and then anon within six
   strokes sir launcelot had

 stricken them to the earth.

   and then they all three cried, sir knight, we
   yield us unto you as man of might matchless.  as
   to that, said sir launcelot, i will not take
   your yielding unto me, but so that ye yield
   you unto sir kay the seneschal, on that covenant
   i will save your lives and else not.  fair knight,
   said they, that were we loath to do; for as for
   sir kay we chased him hither, and had overcome
   him had ye not been; therefore, to yield us unto
   him it were no reason.  well, as to that, said
   sir launcelot, advise you well, for ye may
   choose whether ye will die or live, for an ye be
   yielden, it shall be unto sir kay.  fair knight,
   then they said, in saving our lives we will do
   as thou commandest us.  then shall ye, said sir
   launcelot, on whitsunday next coming go unto the
   court of king arthur, and there shall ye yield

u unto queen guenever, and put you all three
   in her grace and mercy, and say that sir kay
   sent you thither to be her prisoners.  on the morn
   sir launcelot arose early, and left sir kay
   sleeping; and sir launcelot took sir kay’s armor
   and his shield and armed him, and so he went to
   the stable and took his horse, and took his leave
   of his host, and so he departed.  then soon after
   arose sir kay and missed sir launcelot; and
   then he espied that he had his armor and his
   horse. now by my faith i know well that he will
   grieve some of the court of king arthur; for on
   him knights will be bold, and deem that it is i,
   and that will beguile them; and because of his
   armor and shield i am sure i shall ride in peace.
   and then soon after departed sir kay, and
   thanked his host.

stranger came in.  i gave him a pi

ee months; for i judged i would
have the start of the best-educated man in the kingdom by a matter
of thirteen hundred years and upward.  i’m not a man to waste
time after my mind’s made up and there’s work on hand; so i said
to the page:

“now, clarence, my boy--if that might happen to be your name
--i’ll get you to post me up a little if you don’t mind.  what is
the name of that apparition that brought me here?”

“my master and thine?  that is the good knight and great lord
sir kay the seneschal, foster brother to our liege the king.”

“very good; go on, tell me everything.”

he made a long story of it; but the part that had immediate interest
for me was this: he said i was sir kay’s prisoner, and that
in the due course of custom i would be flung into a dungeon and
left there on scant commons until my friends ransomed me--unless
i chanced to rot, first.  i saw that the last chance had the best
show, but i didn’t waste any bother about that; time was too
precious

.  the page said, further, that dinner was about ended
in the great hall by this time, and that as soon as the sociability
and the heavy drinking should begin, sir kay would have me in and
exhibit me before king arthur and his illustrious knights seated at
the table round, and would brag about his exploit in capturing
me, and would probably exaggerate the facts a little, but it
wouldn’t be good form for me to correct him, and not over safe,
either; and when i was done being exhibited, then ho for the
dungeon; but he, clarence, would find a way to come and see me every
now and then, and cheer me up, and help me get word to my friends.

in a body and knelt on the floor and lifted up their hands toward
the ladies’ gallery and begged the grace of a word with the queen.
the most conspicuously situated lady in that massed flower-bed
of feminine show and finery inclined her head by way of assent,
and then the spokesman of the prisoners delivered himself and his
fellows into her hands for free pardon, ransom, captivity, or death,
as she in her good pleasure might elect; and this, as he said, he
was doing by command of sir kay the seneschal, whose prisoners
they were, he having vanquished them by his single might and
prowess in sturdy conflict in the field.

surprise and astonishment flashed from face to face all over
the house; the queen’s gratified smile faded out at the name of
sir kay, and she looked disappointed; and the page whispered in
my ear with an accent and manner expressive of extravagant derision--

“sir _kay_, forsooth!  oh, call me pet names, dearest, call me
a marine!  in twice a thousand years s

every eye was fastened with severe inquiry upon sir kay. but he
was equal to the occasion.  he got up and played his hand like
a major--and took every trick.  he said he would state the case
exactly according to the facts; he would tell the simple
straightforward tale, without comment of his own; “and then,”
 said he, “if ye find glory and honor due, ye will give it unto him
who is the mightiest man of his hands that ever bare shield or
strake with sword in the ranks of christian battle--even him that
sitteth there!” and he pointed to sir la

them; it was a rattling good stroke.  then he went on and told
how sir launcelot, seeking adventures, some brief time gone by,
killed seven giants at one sweep of his sword, and set a hundred
and forty-two captive maidens free; and then went further, still
seeking adventures, and found him (sir kay) fighting a desperate
fight against nine foreign knights, and straightway took the battle
solely into his own hands, and conquered the nine; and that night
sir launcelot rose quietly, and dressed him in sir kay’s armor and
took sir kay’s horse and gat him away into distant lands, and
vanquished sixteen knights in one pitched battle and thirty-four
in another; and all these and the former nine he made to swear
that about whitsuntide they would ride to arthur’s court and yield

and the rest would be along as soon as they might be healed of
their desperate wounds.

well, it was touching to see the queen blush and smile, and look
embarrassed and happy, and fling furtive glances at sir launcelot
that would have got him shot in arkansas, to a dead certainty.

everybody praised the valor and magnanimity of sir launcelot; and
as for me, i was perfectly amazed, that one man, all by himself,

of practiced fighters.  i said as much to clarence; but this mocking
featherhead only said:

“an sir kay had had time to get another skin of sour wine into him,
ye had seen the accompt doubled.”

i looked at the boy in sorrow; and as i looked i saw the cloud of
a deep despondency settle upon his countenance.  i followed the
direction of his eye, and saw that a very old and white-bearded
man, clothed in a flowing black gown, had risen and was standing
at the table upon unsteady legs, and feebly swaying his ancient
head and surveying the company with his watery and wandering eye.

jokes were rotten and the rest were
petrified.  i said “petrified” was good; as i believed, myself,
that the only right way to classify the majestic ages of some of
those jokes was by geologic periods.  but that neat idea hit
the boy in a blank place, for geology hadn’t been invented yet.
however, i made a note of the remark, and calculated to educate
the commonwealth up to it if i pulled through.  it is no use
to throw a good thing away merely because the market isn’t ripe yet.

now sir kay arose and began to fire up on his history-mill with me
for fuel.  it was time for me to feel serious, and i did.  sir kay
told how he had encountered me in a far land of barbarians, who
all wore the same ridiculous garb that i did--a garb that was a work
of enchantment, and intended to make the wearer secure from hurt
by human hands.  however he had nullified the force of the
enchantment by prayer, and had killed my thirteen knights in
a three hours’ battle, and taken me prisoner, sparing my

you to get word to the king that i am a magician myself--and the
supreme grand high-yu-muck-amuck and head of the tribe, at that;
and i want him to be made to understand that i am just quietly
arranging a little calamity here that will make the fur fly in these
realms if sir kay’s project is carried out and any harm comes
to me.  will you get that to the king for me?”

the poor boy was in such a state that he could hardly answer me.
it was pitiful to see a creature so terrified, so unnerved, so
demoralized.  but he promised everything; and on my side he made
me promise over and over again that i would remain his friend, and
never turn against him or cast any enchantments upon him. then
he worked his way out, staying himself with his hand along the
