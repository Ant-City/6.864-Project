re enough, there was a boarder, a young 
newspaperman named forrester, just finishing a row. 

"morning, mr. spaulding!" 

"give 'em hell, bill!" cried grandpa heartily, and soon downstairs eating grandma's 
breakfast, with the window open so the rattling buzz of the lawn mower lolled about his 
eating. 

"it gives you confidence," grandpa said. "that lawn mower. listen to it!" 

"won't be using the lawn mower much longer." grandma set down a stack of wheat 
cakes. "they got a new kind of grass bill forrester's putting in this morning, never needs 
cutting. don't know what they call it, but it just grows so long and no longer." 

grandpa stared at the woman. "you're finding a poor! way to joke with me." 

"go look for yourself. land's sake," said grandma, "it was bill forrester's idea. the 
new grass is waiting in little flats by the side of the house. you just dig small holes here 
and there and put the new grass in spots. by the end of the year the new grass kills off 
the old, and you sell your l

grandpa was up from his chair, through the hall, and out the front door in ten

bill forrester left his machine and came over, smiling, squinting in the sun. "that's 
right," he said. "bought the grass yesterday. thought, while i'm on vacation i'd just plant 
it for you." 

"why wasn't i consulted about this? it's my lawn!" cried grandfather. 
"thought you'd appreciate it, mr. spaulding." 

"well, i don't think i do appreciate it. let's see this confounded grass of yours." 

they stood by the little square pads of new grass. grandpa toed at it with one end of 
his shoe suspiciously. "loo

right now such things are bothersome to you, and i wonder if it isn't because you've 
never learned to use them. if you had your way you'd pass a law to abolish all the little 
jobs, the little things. but then you'd leave yourselves nothing to do between the big jobs 
and you'd have a devil of a time thinking up things to do so you wouldn't go crazy. 
instead of that, why not let nature show you a few things? cutting grass and pulling 
weeds can be a way of life, son." 

bill forrester was smiling quietly at him. 

"i know," said grandpa, "i talk too much." 

"there's no one i'd rather hear." 

"lecture continued, then. lilacs on a bush are better than orchids. and dandelions and 
devil grass are better! why? because they bend you over and turn you away from all the

ired after lunch, read a little whittier, 
and slept well on through the day. when he awoke at three the sun was streaming 
through the windows, bright and fresh. he lay in bed and was startled to hear the old, 
the familiar, the memorable sound. 

"why," he said, "someone's using the lawn mower! but the lawn was just cut this 
morning!" 

he listened again. and yes, there it was, the endless droning chatter up and down, up 
and down. 

â–¡ 

he leaned out the window and gaped. "why, it's bill. bill forrester, you there! has the 
sun got you? you're cutting the lawn again!" 

bill looked up, smiled a white smile, and waved. "i know! i think i missed a few 
spots!" 

and while grandpa lay in bed for the next five minutes, smiling and at ease, bill 
forrester cut the lawn north, then west, then south, and finally, in a great green spraying 
fountain, toward the east.

and out there in the middle of the first day of august just getting into his car, was bill 
forrester, who shouted he ir was going downtown for some extraordinary ice cream or 
other and would anyone join him? so, not five minutes later, jiggled and steamed into a 
better mood, douglas found himself stepping in off the fiery pavements and moving 
through the grotto of soda-scented air, of vanilla freshness at the drugstore, to sit at the 
snow-marble fountain with bill forrester. they then asked for a recital of the most 
unusual ices and when the fountain man said, "old fashioned lime-vanilla ice . . ." 

"that's it!" said bill forrester. 

"yes, sir!" said douglas. 

and, while waiting, they turned slowly on their rotating stools. the silver spigots, the 
gleaming mirrors, the hushed whirl-around ceiling fans, the green shades over the small 
windows, the harp-wire chairs, passed under their moving gaze. they stopped turning. 
their eyes had touched upon the face and

"young man," she said to bill forrester, "you are a person of taste and imagination. 
also, you have the will power of ten men; otherwise you would not dare veer away from 
the common flavors listed on the menu and order, straight out, without quibble or 
reservation, such an unheard-of thing as lime-vanilla ice." 

he bowed his head solemnly to her. 

"come sit with me, both of you," she said. "we'll talk of strange ice creams and such 
things as we seem to have a bent for. don't be afraid; j'll foot the bill."

smiling, they carried their dishes to her table and sat. 

"you look like a spaulding," she said to the boy. "you've got your grandfather's head. 
and you, you're william forrester. you write for the chronicle, a good enough column. 
i've heard more about you than i'd care to tell." 

"i know you," said bill forrester. "you're helen loomis." he hesitated, then continued. 
"t was in love with you once," he said. 

"now that's the way i like a conversation to open." she dug quietly at her ice cream. 
"that's grounds for another meeting. no-don't tell me where or when or how you were in 
love with me. we'll save that for next time. you've taken away my appetite with your 
talk. look there now! well, i must get home anyway. since you're a reporter, come for

own, since it was a trading post, for you. and, so we'll both have something for our 
curiosity to chew on, mr. forrester, you remind me of a gentleman i went with seventy, 
yes, seventy years ago. 

she sat across from them and it was like talking with a gray and lost quivering moth. 
the voice came from far away inside the grayness and the oldness, wrapped in the 
powders of pressed flowers and ancient butterflies. 

"well." she arose. "will you come tomorrow?" 

"i most certainly will," said bill forrester. 

and she went off into the town on business, leaving the young boy and the young man 
there, looking after her, slowly finishing their ice cream. 



william forrester spent the next morning checking local news items for the paper, had 
time after lunch for some local news items for the paper, had time after lunch for some 
fishing in the river outside town, caught only some small fish which he threw back 
happily, and, without thinking about it, or at least not noticing that he had thought a
