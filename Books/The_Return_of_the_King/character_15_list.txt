Denethor	 - 
                    The
Steward of Gondor and the father of Boromir and Faramir. Denethor
undergoes a painful descent into madness that Tolkien uses to explore
the complexity of human evil. Proud and wise, Denethor fails not
because he is inherently evil, but because he allows the evil lies of
the palantir to convince him that he is incapable
of saving Minas Tirith from Mordor's power.
