oft voices, at first using the common speech, but after the manner of older days, and then changing to another language of their own. to his amazement, as he listened frodo became aware that it was the elven-tongue that they spoke, or one but little different; and he looked at them with wonder, for he knew then that they must be dúnedain of the south, men of the line of the lords of westernesse.
after a while he spoke to them; but they were slow and cautious in answering. they named themselves mablung and damrod, soldiers of gondor, and they were rangers of ithilien; for they were descended from folk who lived in ithilien at one time, before it was overrun. from such men the lord denethor chose his forayers, who crossed the anduin secretly (how or where, they would not say) to harry the orcs and other enemies that roamed between the ephel dúath and the river.
`it is close on ten leagues hence to the east-shore of anduin,' said mablung, 'and we seldom come so far afield. but we have a new errand on thi

than i thought at first. i should now take you back to minas tirith to answer there to denethor, and my life will justly be forfeit, if i now choose a course that proves ill for my city. so i will not decide in haste what is to be done. yet we must move hence without more delay.'
he sprang to his feet and issued some orders. at once the men who were gathered round him broke up into small groups, and went off this way and that, vanishing quickly into the shadows of the rocks and trees. soon only mablung and damrod remained.
'now you, frodo and samwise, will come with me and my guards,' said faramir. `you cannot go along the road southwards, if that was your purpose. it will be unsafe for some days, and always more closely watched after this affray than it has been yet. and you cannot, i think, go far today in any case, for you are weary. and so are we. we are going now to a secret place we have, somewhat less than ten miles from here. the orcs and spies of the enemy have not found it yet, and if they did

, we could hold it long even against many. there we may lie up and rest for a while, and you with us. in the morning i will decide what is best for me to do, and for you.'
there was nothing for frodo to do but to fall in with this request, or order. it seemed in any case a wise course for the moment, since this foray of the men of gondor had made a journey in ithilien more dangerous than ever.
they set out at once: mablung and damrod a little ahead, and faramir with frodo and sam behind. skirting the hither side of the pool where the hobbits had bathed, they crossed the stream, climbed a long bank, and passed into green-shadowed woodlands that marched ever downwards and westwards. while they walked, as swiftly as the hobbits could go, they talked in hushed voices.
'i broke off our speech together,' said faramir, 'not only because time pressed, as master samwise had reminded me, but also because we were drawing near to matte

u. but it is a command that no stranger, not even one of rohan that fights with us, shall see the path we now go with open eyes. i must blindfold you.'
`as you will,' said frodo. 'even the elves do likewise at need, and blindfolded we crossed the borders of fair lothlórien. gimli the dwarf took it ill, but the hobbits endured it.'
`it is to no place so fair that i shall lead you,' said faramir. 'but i am glad that you will take this willingly and not by force.'
he called softly and immediately mablung and damrod stepped out of the trees and came back to him. 'blindfold these guests,' said faramir. `securely, but not so as to discomfort them. do not tie their hands. they will give their word not to try and see. i could trust them to shut their eyes of their own accord, but eyes will blink, if the feet stumble. lead them so that they do not falter.'
with green scarves the two guards now bound up the hobbits' eyes and drew their hoods down almost to their mouths; then quickly they took each one by the han

ng in the dark. after a little they found that they were on a path descending steeply; soon it grew so narrow that they went in single file, brushing a stony wall on either side; their guards steered them from behind with hands laid firmly on their shoulders. now and again they came to rough places and were lifted from their feet for a while, and then set down again. always the noise of the running water was on their right hand, and it grew nearer and louder. at length they were halted. quickly mablung and damrod turned them about, several times, and they lost all sense of direction. they climbed upwards a little: it seemed cold and the noise of the stream had become faint. then they were picked up and carried down, down many steps, and round a corner. suddenly they heard the water again, loud now, rushing and splashing. all round them it seemed, and they felt a fine rain on their hands and cheeks. at last they were set on their feet once more. for a moment they stood so, half fearful, blindfold, not kn
