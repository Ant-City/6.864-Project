ew that he was one in a thousand--“one in ten t’ousand,” he
commented mentally.

buck saw money pass between them, and was not surprised when curly, a
good-natured newfoundland, and he were led away by the little weazened
man. that was the last he saw of the man in the red sweater, and as
curly and he looked at receding seattle from the deck of the narwhal, it
was the last he saw of the warm southland. curly and he were taken below
by perrault and turned over to a black-faced giant called francois.
perrault was a french-canadian, and swarthy; but francois was a
french-canadian half-breed, and twice as swarthy. they were a new kind
of men to buck (of which he was destined to see many more), and while
he developed no affection for them, he none the less grew honestly to
respect them. he speedily learned that perrault and francois were fair
men, calm and impartial in administering justice, and too wise in the
way of dogs to be fooled by dogs.

in the ‘tween-decks of the narwhal, buck and

curly joined two other
dogs. one of them was a big, snow-white fellow from spitzbergen who had
been brought away by a whaling captain, and who had later accompanied
a geological survey into the barrens. he was friendly, in a treacherous
sort of way, smiling into one’s face the while he meditated some
underhand trick, as, for instance, when he stole from buck’s food at the
first meal. as buck sprang to punish him, the lash of francois’s whip
sang through the air, reaching the culprit first; and nothing remained
to buck but to recover the bone. that was fair of francois, he decided,
and the half-breed began his rise in buck’s estimation.

the other dog made no advances, nor received any; also, he did not
attempt to steal from the newcomers. he was a gloomy, morose fellow, and
he showed curly plainly that all he desired was to be left alone, and
further, that there would be trouble if he were not left alone. “dave”

day and night the ship throbbed to the tireless pulse of the propeller,
and though one day was very like another, it was apparent to buck that
the weather was steadily growing colder. at last, one morning, the
propeller was quiet, and the narwhal was pervaded with an atmosphere of
excitement. he felt it, as did the other dogs, and knew that a change
was at hand. francois leashed them and brought them on deck. at the
first step upon the cold surface, buck’s feet sank into a white mushy
something very like mud. he sprang back with a snort. more of this white
stuff was falling through the air. he shook himself, but more of it fell
upon him. he sniffed it curiously, then licked some up on his tongue. it
bit like fire, and the next instant was gone. this puzzled him. he tried
it again, with the same result. the onlookers laughed uproariously, and
he felt ashamed,

ly rushed her antagonist, who struck again
and leaped aside. he met her next rush with his chest, in a peculiar
fashion that tumbled her off her feet. she never regained them, this
was what the onlooking huskies had waited for. they closed in upon her,
snarling and yelping, and she was buried, screaming with agony, beneath
the bristling mass of bodies.

so sudden was it, and so unexpected, that buck was taken aback. he saw
spitz run out his scarlet tongue in a way he had of laughing; and he saw
francois, swinging an axe, spring into the mess of dogs. three men
with clubs were helping him to scatter them. it did not take long. two
minutes from the time curly went down, the last of her assailants were
clubbed off. but she lay there limp and lifeless in the bloody, trampled
snow, almost literally torn to pieces, the swart half-breed standing
over her and cursing horribly. the scene often came back to buck to
trouble him in his sleep. so that was the way. no fair play. once down,

of you. well, he would see to it that he never went
down. spitz ran out his tongue and laughed again, and from that moment
buck hated him with a bitter and deathless hatred.

before he had recovered from the shock caused by the tragic passing
of curly, he received another shock. francois fastened upon him an
arrangement of straps and buckles. it was a harness, such as he had seen
the grooms put on the horses at home. and as he had seen horses work,
so he was set to work, hauling francois on a sled to the forest that
fringed the valley, and returning with a load of firewood. though his
dignity was sorely hurt by thus being made a draught animal, he was too
wise to rebel. he buckled down with a will and did his best, though
it was all new and strange. francois was stern, demanding instant
obedience, and by virtue of his whip receiving instant obedience;
while dave, who was an experienced wheeler, nipped buck’s hind quarters
whenever he was in error. spitz was the leader, likewi

se experienced,
and while he could not always get at buck, he growled sharp reproof now
and again, or cunningly threw his weight in the traces to jerk buck
into the way he should go. buck learned easily, and under the combined
tuition of his two mates and francois made remarkable progress. ere they
returned to camp he knew enough to stop at “ho,” to go ahead at “mush,”
 to swing wide on the bends, and to keep clear of the wheeler when the
loaded sled shot downhill at their heels.

“t’ree vair’ good dogs,” francois told perrault. “dat buck, heem pool
lak hell. i tich heem queek as anyt’ing.”

by afternoon, perrault, who was in a hurry to be on the trail with his
despatches, returned with two more dogs. “billee” and “joe” he c

buck avoided his blind side, and to the last of their comradeship had
no more trouble. his only apparent ambition, like dave’s, was to be left
alone; though, as buck was afterward to learn, each of them possessed
one other and even more vital ambition.

that night buck faced the great problem of sleeping. the tent, illumined
by a candle, glowed warmly in the midst of the white plain; and when he,
as a matter of course, entered it, both perrault and francois bombarded
him with curses and cooking utensils, till he recovered from his
consternation and fled ignominiously into the outer cold. a chill wind
was blowing that nipped him sharply and bit with especial venom into his
wounded shoulder. he lay down on the snow and attempted to sleep,
but the frost soon drove him shivering to his feet. miserable and
disconsolate, he wandered about among the many tents, only to find that
one place was as cold as another. here and there savage dogs rushed

mself fear it. the muscles of his whole body contracted
spasmodically and instinctively, the hair on his neck and shoulders
stood on end, and with a ferocious snarl he bounded straight up into
the blinding day, the snow flying about him in a flashing cloud. ere he
landed on his feet, he saw the white camp spread out before him and knew
where he was and remembered all that had passed from the time he went
for a stroll with manuel to the hole he had dug for himself the night
before.

a shout from francois hailed his appearance. “wot i say?” the dog-driver
cried to perrault. “dat buck for sure learn queek as anyt’ing.”

perrault nodded gravely. as courier for the canadian government, bearing
important despatches, he was anxious to secure the best dogs, and he was
particularly gladdened by the possession of buck.

three more huskies were added to the team inside an hour, making a total
of nine, and before another quarter of an hour had passed they were in
harness and swinging up the trai

came sol-leks; the rest of the team was strung out ahead, single file,
to the leader, which position was filled by spitz.

buck had been purposely placed between dave and sol-leks so that he
might receive instruction. apt scholar that he was, they were equally
apt teachers, never allowing him to linger long in error, and enforcing
their teaching with their sharp teeth. dave was fair and very wise. he
never nipped buck without cause, and he never failed to nip him when he
stood in need of it. as francois’s whip backed him up, buck found it
to be cheaper to mend his ways than to retaliate. once, during a brief
halt, when he got tangled in the traces and delayed the start, both
dave and solleks flew at him and administered a sound trouncing. the
resulting tangle was even worse, but buck took good care to keep the
traces clear thereafter; and ere the day was done, so well had he
mastered his work, his mates about ceased nagging him. francois’s whip
snapped less frequently, and perrault even ho

s against the break-up of the ice in the spring. buck made
his hole in the snow and slept the sleep of the exhausted just, but all
too early was routed out in the cold darkness and harnessed with his
mates to the sled.

that day they made forty miles, the trail being packed; but the next
day, and for many days to follow, they broke their own trail, worked
harder, and made poorer time. as a rule, perrault travelled ahead of
the team, packing the snow with webbed shoes to make it easier for them.
francois, guiding the sled at the gee-pole, sometimes exchanged places
with him, but not often. perrault was in a hurry, and he prided himself
on his knowledge of ice, which knowledge was indispensable, for the fall
ice was very thin, and where there was swift water, there was no ice at
all.

day after day, for days unending, buck toiled in the traces. always,
they broke camp in the dark, and the first gray of dawn found them
hitting the trail with fresh miles reeled off behind them. and always

ully buck, striving constantly to start the
fight which could end only in the death of one or the other. early in
the trip this might have taken place had it not been for an unwonted
accident. at the end of this day they made a bleak and miserable camp
on the shore of lake le barge. driving snow, a wind that cut like a
white-hot knife, and darkness had forced them to grope for a camping
place. they could hardly have fared worse. at their backs rose a
perpendicular wall of rock, and perrault and francois were compelled to
make their fire and spread their sleeping robes on the ice of the lake
itself. the tent they had discarded at dyea in order to travel light.
a few sticks of driftwood furnished them with a fire that thawed down
through the ice and left them to eat supper in the dark.

close in under the sheltering rock buck made his nest. so snug and warm
was it, that he was loath to leave it when francois distributed the
fish which he had first thawed over the fire. but when buck finished his

ration and returned, he found his nest occupied. a warning snarl told
him that the trespasser was spitz. till now buck had avoided trouble
with his enemy, but this was too much. the beast in him roared. he
sprang upon spitz with a fury which surprised them both, and spitz
particularly, for his whole experience with buck had gone to teach him
that his rival was an unusually timid dog, who managed to hold his own
only because of his great weight and size.

francois was surprised, too, when they shot out in a tangle from the
disrupted nest and he divined the cause of the trouble. “a-a-ah!”
 he cried to buck. “gif it to heem, by gar! gif it to heem, the dirty
t’eef!”

spitz was equally willing. he was crying with sheer rage and eagerness
as he circled back and forth for a chance to spring in. buck was no less
eager, and no less cautious, as he likewise circled back and forth for
the advantage. but it was then that the unexpected happened, the thin

a husky, and he crunched down through the bone. pike, the malingerer,
leaped upon the crippled animal, breaking its neck with a quick flash of
teeth and a jerk, buck got a frothing adversary by the throat, and was
sprayed with blood when his teeth sank through the jugular. the warm
taste of it in his mouth goaded him to greater fierceness. he flung
himself upon another, and at the same time felt teeth sink into his own
throat. it was spitz, treacherously attacking from the side.

perrault and francois, having cleaned out their part of the camp,
hurried to save their sled-dogs. the wild wave of famished beasts rolled
back before them, and buck shook himself free. but it was only for a
moment. the two men were compelled to run back to save the grub, upon
which the huskies returned to the attack on the team. billee, terrified
into bravery, sprang through the savage circle and fled away over the
ice. pike and dub followed on his heels, with the rest of the team
behind. as buck drew himself toget

back to camp, to find the marauders gone and the two men in bad tempers.
fully half their grub supply was gone. the huskies had chewed through
the sled lashings and canvas coverings. in fact, nothing, no matter how
remotely eatable, had escaped them. they had eaten a pair of perrault’s
moose-hide moccasins, chunks out of the leather traces, and even two
feet of lash from the end of francois’s whip. he broke from a mournful
contemplation of it to look over his wounded dogs.

“ah, my frien’s,” he said softly, “mebbe it mek you mad dog, dose many
bites. mebbe all mad dog, sacredam! wot you t’ink, eh, perrault?”

the courier shook his head dubiously. with four hundred miles of trail
still between him and dawson, he could ill afford to have madness break
out among his dogs. two hours of cursing and exertion got the harnesses
into shape, and the wound-stiffened team was un

ragged out. the usual fire was
necessary to save them. they were coated solidly with ice, and the two
men kept them on the run around the fire, sweating and thawing, so close
that they were singed by the flames.

at another time spitz went through, dragging the whole team after him up
to buck, who strained backward with all his strength, his fore paws on
the slippery edge and the ice quivering and snapping all around. but
behind him was dave, likewise straining backward, and behind the sled
was francois, pulling till his tendons cracked.

again, the rim ice broke away before and behind, and there was no escape
except up the cliff. perrault scaled it by a miracle, while francois
prayed for just that miracle; and with every thong and sled lashing and
the last bit of harness rove into a long rope, the dogs were hoisted,
one by one, to the cliff crest. francois came up last, after the sled
and load. then came the search for a place to descend, which descent was

his had softened during the many generations since the day his last
wild ancestor was tamed by a cave-dweller or river man. all day long he
limped in agony, and camp once made, lay down like a dead dog. hungry as
he was, he would not move to receive his ration of fish, which francois
had to bring to him. also, the dog-driver rubbed buck’s feet for half
an hour each night after supper, and sacrificed the tops of his own
moccasins to make four moccasins for buck. this was a great relief, and
buck caused even the weazened face of perrault to twist itself into a
grin one morning, when francois forgot the moccasins and buck lay on his
back, his four feet waving appealingly in the air, and refused to budge
without them. later his feet grew hard to the trail, and the worn-out

raced, with dolly, panting and frothing, one leap behind; nor could she
gain on him, so great was his terror, nor could he leave her, so great
was her madness. he plunged through the wooded breast of the island,
flew down to the lower end, crossed a back channel filled with rough ice
to another island, gained a third island, curved back to the main river,
and in desperation started to cross it. and all the time, though he
did not look, he could hear her snarling just one leap behind. francois
called to him a quarter of a mile away and he doubled back, still one
leap ahead, gasping painfully for air and putting all his faith in that
francois would save him. the dog-driver held the axe poised in his hand,
and as buck shot past him the axe crashed down upon mad dolly’s head.

helpless. this was spitz’s opportunity. he sprang upon buck, and twice

of watching spitz receive the worst whipping as yet administered to any
of the teams.

“one devil, dat spitz,” remarked perrault. “some dam day heem keel dat
buck.”

“dat buck two devils,” was francois’s rejoinder. “all de tam i watch dat
buck i know for sure. lissen: some dam fine day heem get mad lak hell
an’ den heem chew dat spitz all up an’ spit heem out on de snow. sure. i
know.”

from then on it was war between them. spitz, as lead-dog and
acknowledged master of the team, felt his supremacy threatened by this
strange southland dog. and strange buck was to him, for of the many
southland dogs he had known, not one had shown up worthily in camp and
on trail. they were all too so

likewise it was this pride that made him fear buck as a possible
lead-dog. and this was buck’s pride, too.

he openly threatened the other’s leadership. he came between him and the
shirks he should have punished. and he did it deliberately. one night
there was a heavy snowfall, and in the morning pike, the malingerer,
did not appear. he was securely hidden in his nest under a foot of snow.
francois called him and sought him in vain. spitz was wild with wrath.
he raged through the camp, smelling and digging in every likely
place, snarling so frightfully that pike heard and shivered in his
hiding-place.

but when he was at last unearthed, and spitz flew at him to punish him,
buck flew, with equal rage, in between. so unexpected was it, and so
shrewdly managed, that spitz was hurled backward and off his feet. pike,
who had been trembling abjectly, took heart at this open mutiny,

pon his overthrown leader. buck, to whom fair play was a
forgotten code, likewise sprang upon spitz. but francois, chuckling at
the incident while unswerving in the administration of justice, brought
his lash down upon buck with all his might. this failed to drive buck
from his prostrate rival, and the butt of the whip was brought into
play. half-stunned by the blow, buck was knocked backward and the lash
laid upon him again and again, while spitz soundly punished the many
times offending pike.

in the days that followed, as dawson grew closer and closer, buck still
continued to interfere between spitz and

things no longer went right. there was continual bickering and jangling.
trouble was always afoot, and at the bottom of it was buck. he kept
francois busy, for the dog-driver was in constant apprehension of the
life-and-death struggle between the two which he knew must take place
sooner or later; and on more than one night the sounds of quarrelling
and strife among the other dogs turned him out of his sleeping robe,
fearful that buck and spitz were at it.

but the opportunity did not present itself, and they pulled into dawson
one dreary afternoon with the great fight still to come. here were many
men, and countless dogs, and buck found them

st had recuperated the dogs and put
them in thorough trim. the trail they had broken into the country was
packed hard by later journeyers. and further, the police had arranged
in two or three places deposits of grub for dog and man, and he was
travelling light.

they made sixty mile, which is a fifty-mile run, on the first day; and
the second day saw them booming up the yukon well on their way to pelly.
but such splendid running was achieved not without great trouble and
vexation on the part of francois. the insidious revolt led by buck
had destroyed the solidarity of the team. it no longer was as one dog
leaping in the traces. the encouragement buck gave the rebels led them
into all kinds of petty misdemeanors. no more was spitz a leader greatly
to be feared. the old awe departed, and they grew equal to challenging
his authority. pike robbed him of half a fish one night, and gulped
it down under the protection of buck. another night dub and joe fought

days. buck never came near spitz without
snarling and bristling menacingly. in fact, his conduct approached that
of a bully, and he was given to swaggering up and down before spitz’s
very nose.

the breaking down of discipline likewise affected the dogs in their
relations with one another. they quarrelled and bickered more than ever
among themselves, till at times the camp was a howling bedlam. dave and
sol-leks alone were unaltered, though they were made irritable by the
unending squabbling. francois swore strange barbarous oaths, and stamped
the snow in futile rage, and tore his hair. his lash was always singing
among the dogs, but it was of small avail. directly his back was turned
they were at it again. he backed up spitz with his whip, while buck
backed up the remainder of the team. francois knew he was behind all the
trouble, and buck knew he knew; but buck was too clever ever again to be
caught red-handed. he worked faithfully in the harness, for the toil
had become a delight to him;

horrible menace, as though to frighten off impending death. then buck
sprang in and out; but while he was in, shoulder had at last squarely
met shoulder. the dark circle became a dot on the moon-flooded snow as
spitz disappeared from view. buck stood and looked on, the successful
champion, the dominant primordial beast who had made his kill and found
it good.




chapter iv. who has won to mastership


“eh? wot i say? i spik true w’en i say dat buck two devils.” this was
francois’s speech next morning when he discovered spitz missing and buck
covered with wounds. he drew him to the fire and by its light pointed
them out.

“dat spitz fight lak hell,” said perrault, as he surveyed the gaping
rips and cuts.

“an’ dat buck fight lak two hells,” was francois’s answer. “an’ now we
make good time. no more spitz, no more trouble, sure.”

while perrault packed the camp outfit and loaded the sled, the
dog-driver proceeded to harness the dogs. buck trotted up t

o the place
spitz would have occupied as leader; but francois, not noticing him,
brought sol-leks to the coveted position. in his judgment, sol-leks was
the best lead-dog left. buck sprang upon sol-leks in a fury, driving him
back and standing in his place.

“eh? eh?” francois cried, slapping his thighs gleefully. “look at dat
buck. heem keel dat spitz, heem t’ink to take de job.”

“go ‘way, chook!” he cried, but buck refused to budge.

he took buck by the scruff of the neck, and though the dog growled
threateningly, dragged him to one side and replaced sol-leks. the old
dog did not like it, and showed plainly that he was afraid of buck.
francois was obdurate, but when he turned his back buck again displaced
sol-leks, who was not at all unwilling to go.

francois was angry. “now, by gar, i feex you!” he cried, coming back
with a heavy club in his hand.

buck remembered the man in the red sweater, and retreated slowly; nor
did he attempt to charge in when sol-leks was once more brought
forward. but he circled just beyond the range of the club, snarling with
bitterness and rage; and while he circled he watched the club so as to
dodge it if thrown by francois, for he was become wise in the way of
clubs. the driver went about his work, and he called to buck when he was
ready to put him in his old place in front of dave. buck retreated two
or three steps. francois followed him up, whereupon he again retreated.
after some time of this, francois threw down the club, thinking that
buck feared a thrashing. but buck was in open revolt. he wanted, not to
escape a clubbing, but to have the leadership. it was his by right. he
had earned it, and he would not b

part of an hour. they threw clubs at him. he dodged. they cursed him,
and his fathers and mothers before him, and all his seed to come after
him down to the remotest generation, and every hair on his body and drop
of blood in his veins; and he answered curse with snarl and kept out of
their reach. he did not try to run away, but retreated around and around
the camp, advertising plainly that when his desire was met, he would
come in and be good.

francois sat down and scratched his head. perrault looked at his watch
and swore. time was flying, and they should have been on the trail an
hour gone. francois scratched his head again. he shook it and grinned
sheepishly at the courier, who shrugged his shoulders in sign that they
were beaten. then francois went up to where sol-leks stood and called
to buck. buck laughed, as dogs laugh, yet kept his distance. francois
unfastened sol-leks’s traces and put him back in his old place. the team

there was no place for buck save at the front. once more francois
called, and once more buck laughed and kept away.

“t’row down de club,” perrault commanded.

francois complied, whereupon buck trotted in, laughing triumphantly,
and swung around into position at the head of the team. his traces were
fastened, the sled broken out, and with both men running they dashed out
on to the river trail.

highly as the dog-driver had forevalued buck, with his two devils, he
found, while the day was yet young, that he had undervalued. at a bound
buck took up the duties of leadership; and where judgment was required,
and quick thinking and quick acting, he showed himself t

it was none of their business. their business was to toil, and toil
mightily, in the traces. so long as that were not interfered with, they
did not care what happened. billee, the good-natured, could lead for all
they cared, so long as he kept order. the rest of the team, however, had
grown unruly during the last days of spitz, a

succeeded in doing. buck simply smothered him by virtue of superior
weight, and cut him up till he ceased snapping and began to whine for
mercy.

the general tone of the team picked up immediately. it recovered its
old-time solidarity, and once more the dogs leaped as one dog in the
traces. at the rink rapids two native huskies, teek and koona, were
added; and the celerity with which buck broke them in took away
francois’s breath.

“nevaire such a dog as dat buck!” he cried. “no, nevaire! heem worth one
t’ousan’ dollair, by gar! eh? wot you say, perrault?”

and perrault nodded. he was ahead of the record then, and gaining day
by day. the trail was in excellent condition, well packed and hard, and
there was no new-fallen snow with which to contend. it was not too cold.

the white horse rapids. across marsh, tagish, and bennett (seventy miles
of lakes), they flew so fast that the man whose turn it was to run
towed behind the sled at the end of a rope. and on the last night of the
second week they topped white pass and dropped down the sea slope with
the lights of skaguay and of the shipping at their feet.

it was a record run. each day for fourteen days they had averaged forty
miles. for three days perrault and francois threw chests up and down the
main street of skaguay and were deluged with invitations to drink, while
the team was the constant centre of a worshipful crowd of dog-busters
and mushers. then three or four western bad men aspired to clean out
the town, were riddled like pepper-boxes for their pains, and public
interest turned to other idols. next came official orders. francois
called buck to him, threw his arms around him, wept over him. and that

most salient thing about him. it advertised his callowness--a callowness
sheer and unutterable. both men were manifestly out of place, and why
such as they should adventure the north is part of the mystery of things
that passes understanding.

buck heard the chaffering, saw the money pass between the man and the
government agent, and knew that the scotch half-breed and the mail-train
drivers were passing out of his life on the heels of perrault and
francois and the others who had gone before. when driven with his mates
to the new owners’ camp, buck saw a slipshod and slovenly affair, tent
half stretched, dishes unwashed, everything in disorder; also, he saw a
woman. “mercedes” the men called her. she was charles’s wife and hal’s
sister--a nice family party.
