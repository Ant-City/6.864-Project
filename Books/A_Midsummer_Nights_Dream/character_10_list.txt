                the
overconfident weaver chosen to play pyramus in the craftsmen's play
for theseus's marriage celebration. bottom is full of advice and
self-confidence but frequently makes silly mistakes and misuses
language. his simultaneous nonchalance about the beautiful titania's
sudden love for him and unawareness of the fact that puck has transformed
his head into that of an ass mark the pinnacle of his foolish arrogance.
