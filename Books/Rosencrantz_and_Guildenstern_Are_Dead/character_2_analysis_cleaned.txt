the [CHARACTER]
the [CHARACTER] is the most mysterious of the play's characters.
he seems to possess a far greater understanding of the events transpiring
than does either rosencrantz or guildenstern. the [CHARACTER]'s witty speeches
often hint at the possibility that he could reveal the truth if only
rosencrantz and guildenstern knew how to ask the right questions.
upon first meeting the pair, the [CHARACTER] claims to recognize them
as artists like himself, a description that implies an awareness that
they are all merely actors in a drama that rosencrantz and guildenstern
do not understand and can barely acknowledge. similarly, the [CHARACTER]
makes several remarks that reflect on rosencrantz and guildenstern's
plight, although in a way that the pair fails to grasp, such as
when he tells them that life is a terrible gamble or when he says
that the normal experience of existence is one of confusion and doubt.
the [CHARACTER]'s unexplained mastery of rosencrantz and guildenstern's
experiences extends to their final moments, when he seems to have
anticipated their deaths and the complicated mix of feelings they
go through as their mortality descends upon them.
the [CHARACTER]'s air of mysterious control and omniscience
contrasts sharply with his shameful occupation as a pimp for the
men in his acting troupe, whose bodies he will happily sell if the
opportunity arises. guildenstern holds this fact against the [CHARACTER]
and tricks him into an unwinnable bet, partly out of disgust and
a desire to punish the [CHARACTER] for his amoral attitude. although
the [CHARACTER] occasionally seems embarrassed by his profession, he
generally retains a haughty attitude, secure in his knowledge of
rosencrantz and guildenstern's fate and fully aware that his troupe
fills an unacknowledged social need and will therefore always be
in demand. the [CHARACTER]'s confidence is also apparent in his serious
belief in the integrity of theater in general and the tragedians'
performances in particular. this belief infuriates the skeptical
and philosophical guildenstern, but the [CHARACTER] remains entirely
unflappable in the face of guildenstern's rage. the [CHARACTER]'s combination
of a lowly, shameful appearance with dazzling wit, mysterious power,
and defiant confidence make him an unlikely but fascinating ringmaster
for the play's circus of confusion.
