[CHARACTER] - 
                	a
twenty-six-year-old caribbean native and cannibal who converts to
protestantism under crusoe's tutelage. [CHARACTER] becomes crusoe's servant
after crusoe saves his life when [CHARACTER] is about to be eaten by
other cannibals. [CHARACTER] never appears to resist or resent his new
servitude, and he may sincerely view it as appropriate compensation
for having his life saved. but whatever [CHARACTER]'s response may be,
his servitude has become a symbol of imperialist oppression throughout the
modern world. [CHARACTER]'s overall charisma works against the emotional
deadness that many readers find in crusoe.
