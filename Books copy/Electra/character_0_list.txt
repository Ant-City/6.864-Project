Electra - 
      Electra is the eldest daughter of Clytemnestra and Agamemnon. Poorly treated by her mother and her mother's husband, Aegisthus, she spends her days mourning her father's murder and awaiting the return of her brother, Orestes, whom she believes will help her to carry out that which she most longs for: vengeance for her father's death. She is stubbornly devoted to the principles of justice, reverence, and honor, although oftentimes her grasp on these principles seems questionable.
