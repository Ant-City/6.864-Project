n-houses for the night, but
was too drunk to remember to shut the pop-holes. with the ring of light
from his lantern dancing from side to side, he lurched across the yard,
kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer
from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where
mrs. jones was already snoring.

as soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was a stirring and a
fluttering all through the farm buildings. word had gone round during the
day that old major, the prize middle white boar, had had a strange dream
on the previous night and wished to communicate it to the other animals.
it had been agreed that they should all meet in the big barn as soon as
mr. jones was safely out of the way. old major (so he was always called,
though the name under which he had been exhibited was willingdon beauty)
was so highly regarded on the farm that everyone was quite ready to lose
an hour's sleep in order to hear what he had to say.

at one end of the big barn,

 three words. i had known that tune in my infancy, but it had
long since passed out of my mind. last night, however, it came back to me
in my dream. and what is more, the words of the song also came back-words,
i am certain, which were sung by the animals of long ago and have been
lost to memory for generations. i will sing you that song now, comrades.
i am old and my voice is hoarse, but when i have taught you the tune, you
can sing it better for yourselves. it is called 'beasts of england'."

old major cleared his throat and began to sing. as he had said, his voice
was hoarse, but he sang well enough, and it was a stirring tune, something
between 'clementine' and 'la cucaracha'. the words ran:

beasts of england, beasts of ireland,
beasts of every land and clime,
hearken to my joyful tidings
of the golden future time.

soon or late the day is coming,
tyrant man shall be o'erthrown,
and the fruitful fields of england
shall be trod by beasts alone.

rings shall vanish from our noses,

oar awoke mr. jones, who sprang out of bed, making
sure that there was a fox in the yard. he seized the gun which always
stood in a corner of his bedroom, and let fly a charge of number 6 shot
into the darkness. the pellets buried themselves in the wall of the barn
and the meeting broke up hurriedly. everyone fled to his own
sleeping-place. the birds jumped on to their perches, the animals settled
down in the straw, and the whole farm was asleep in a moment.

three nights later old major died peacefully in his sleep. his body was
buried at the foot of the orchard.

this was early in march. during the next three months there was much
secret activity. major's speech had given to the more intelligent animals
on the farm a completely new outlook on life. they did not know when the
rebellion predicted by major would take place, they had no reason for
thinking that it would be within their own lifetime, but they saw clearly
that it was their duty to prepare for it. the work of teachi

sidered to have the same depth of character. all the other male pigs on
the farm were porkers. the best known among them was a small fat pig named
squealer, with very round cheeks, twinkling eyes, nimble movements, and a
shrill voice. he was a brilliant talker, and when he was arguing some
difficult point he had a way of skipping from side to side and whisking
his tail which was somehow very persuasive. the others said of squealer
that he could turn black into white.

these three had elaborated old major's teachings into a complete system of
thought, to which they gave the name of animalism. several nights a week,
after mr. jones was asleep, they held secret meetings in the barn and
expounded the principles of animalism to the others. at the beginning they
met with much stupidity and apathy. some of the animals talked of the duty
of loyalty to mr. jones, whom they referred to as "master," or made
elementary remarks such as "mr. jones feeds us. if he were gone, we should
starve to death." others

poleon says it, it must be right." and from then on he adopted the
maxim, "napoleon is always right," in addition to his private motto of "i
will work harder."

by this time the weather had broken and the spring ploughing had begun.
the shed where snowball had drawn his plans of the windmill had been shut
up and it was assumed that the plans had been rubbed off the floor. every
sunday morning at ten o'clock the animals assembled in the big barn to
receive their orders for the week. the skull of old major, now clean of
flesh, had been disinterred from the orchard and set up on a stump at the
foot of the flagstaff, beside the gun. after the hoisting of the flag, the
animals were required to file past the skull in a reverent manner before
entering the barn. nowadays they did not sit all together as they had done
in the past. napoleon, with squealer and another pig named minimus, who
had a remarkable gift for composing songs and poems, sat on the front of
the raised platform, with the nine young do

ith a kind of surprise they
remembered that it was their own farm, every inch of it their own
property--appeared to the animals so desirable a place. as clover looked
down the hillside her eyes filled with tears. if she could have spoken her
thoughts, it would have been to say that this was not what they had aimed
at when they had set themselves years ago to work for the overthrow of the
human race. these scenes of terror and slaughter were not what they had
looked forward to on that night when old major first stirred them to
rebellion. if she herself had had any picture of the future, it had been
of a society of animals set free from hunger and the whip, all equal, each
working according to his capacity, the strong protecting the weak, as she
had protected the lost brood of ducklings with her foreleg on the night of
major's speech. instead--she did not know why--they had come to a time
when no one dared speak his mind, when fierce, growling dogs roamed
everywhere, and when you had to watch you
