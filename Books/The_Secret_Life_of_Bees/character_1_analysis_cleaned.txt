[CHARACTER]
[CHARACTER] is unique. not only is she a black woman
in the south who runs a successful business, but she is a black
woman who also owns a great deal of property, is educated, has eschewed
the conventions of marriage, and does not flinch or shy away from
the opportunity to take care of a young white runaway girl. a rare
soul and a warm, accepting person, august guides the cowed and browbeaten
lily to a place from which she confidently confronts her confusing,
unfair world. in a way, august functions as the spiritual core of
the book, the wise sage that leads the novel toward its positive conclusion.
without august, there would be no "of age" in lily's "coming-of-age."
although she too is a pawn in the greater events of the world, she
has created a remarkable community in tiburon and infused it with
her own brand of spiritual gusto. august becomes a surrogate mother
for lily, a trusted friend, and guiding light. august's undying
support, trust, and love saves lily--just as this love has softened
june, kept may alive, created and supported the daughters of mary,
and given zach something to hope for in the future.
