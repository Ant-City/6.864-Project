things only become more complicated when we consider the forces of nature. the world around us is
replete  with  means  of  exerting  influence:  balls  can  be  hit  with  bats,  bungee  enthusiasts  can  throw
themselves earthward from high platforms, magnets can keep superfast trains suspended just above
metallic  tracks,  geiger  counters  can  tick  in  response  to  radioactive  material,  nuclear  bombs  can
explode.  we  can  influence  objects  by  vigorously  pushing,  pulling,  or

of substances such as uranium and cobalt.

during the past century, physicists have found two features common to all these forces. first, as
we will discuss in chapter 5, at a microscopic level all the forces have an associated particle that
you can think of as being the smallest packet or bundle of the force. if you fire a laser beam—an
"electromagnetic  ray  gun"—you  are  firing  a  stream  of photons,  the  smallest  bundles  of  the
electromagnetic  force.  similarly,  the  smallest  constituents  of  weak  and  strong  force  fields  are
particles  called weak gauge bosons  and gluons.  (the  name gluon is particularly descriptive: you
can think of gluons as the microscopic ingredient in the strong glue holding atomic nuclei together.)

measured  these  properties,  no  one  has  any  explanation  of why  our  universe  is  composed  of  these
particular particles, with these particular masses and force charges.

the  speed  with  which  the  snow  approaches  you  to  decrease—and  this,  generally,  is  a  good  thing.
again, a stationary individual perceives the speed of the approaching snow to be greater than that
perceived by someone in retreat.

now, let's compare these basic observations about baseballs, grenades, and avalanches to those
about light. to make the comparisons tighter, think about a light beam as composed of tiny "packets"
or "bundles" known as photons (a feature of light we will discuss more fully in chapter 4). when we
turn  on  a  flashlight  or  a  laser  beam  we  are,  in  effect,  shooting  a  stream  of  photons  in  whatever
direction we point the device. as we did for grenades and avalanches, let's consider how the motion
of a photon appears to someone who is moving. imagine that your crazed friend has swapped her

million miles per hour. but what if you run away, as you did when faced with the prospect of playing
catch with a hand grenade? what speed will you now measure for the approaching photons? to make
things more compelling, imagine that you can hitch a ride on the starship enterprise and zip away
from your friend at, say, 100 million miles per hour. following the reasoning based on the traditional
newtonian  worldview,  since  you  are  now  speeding  away,  you  would  expect  to  measure  a slower
speed for the oncoming photons. specifically, you would expect to find them approaching you at (670
million miles per hour -100 million miles per hour =) 570 million miles per hour.

careful analysis and interpretation of maxwell's electromagnetic theory of light, slowly convinced the
scientific community that, in fact, this is not what you will see. even though you are retreating, you
will still measure the speed of the approaching photons as 670 million miles per hour, not a bit
less.  although  at  first  it  sounds  completely  ridiculous,  unlike  what  happens  if  one  runs  from  an
oncoming baseball, grenade, or avalanche, the speed of approaching photons is always 670 million
miles per hour. the same is true if you run toward oncoming photons or chase after them—their speed
of approach or recession is completely unchanged; they still appear to travel at 670 million miles per
hour. regardless of relative motion between

technological  limitations  are  such  that  the  "experiments"  with  light,  as  described,  cannot
actually  be  carried  out.  however,  comparable  experiments  can.  for  instance,  in  1913  the  dutch
physicist willem de sitter suggested that fast-moving binary stars (two stars that orbit one another)
could be used to measure the effect of a moving source on the speed of light. various experiments of

truth and consequences

speed is a measure of how far an object can travel in a given duration of time. if we are in a car
going 65 miles per hour, this means of course that we will travel 65 miles if we persist in this state of
motion for an hour. phrased in this manner, speed is a rather mundane concept, and you may wonder
about the fuss we have made regarding the speed of baseballs, snowballs, and photons. however,
let's note that distance is a notion about space—in particular it is a measure of how much space there
is  between  two  points.  also  note  that duration  is  a  notion  about  time—how  much  time  elapses
between two events. speed, therefore, is intimately connected with our notions of space and time.
when we phrase it this way, we see that any experimental fact that defies our common conception
about  speed,  such  as  the  constancy  of  the  speed  of  light,  has  the  po

without highbrow mathematics or a convoluted chain of logic, this completely unexpected feature of
time follows directly from the constancy of the speed of light, as the scenario illustrates. notice that if
the speed of light were not constant but behaved according to our intuition based on slow-moving
baseballs  and  snowballs,  the  platform  observers  would  agree  with  those  on  the  train. a  platform
observer  would  still  claim  that  the  photons  have  to  travel  farther  to  reach  the  president  of

backwardland than they do to reach the president of forwardland. however, usual intuition implies
that  the  light  approaching  the  president  of  backwardland  would  be  moving  more  quickly,  having
received a "kick" from the forward-moving train. similarly, these observers would see that the light
approaching the president of forwardland would be moving more slowly, being "dragged" back by
the  train's  motion.  when  these  (e

ll not be any shaking or jostling at
all. rather, we are interested in the universal question of how motion affects the passage of time and
therefore how it fundamentally affects the ticking of any and all clocks regardless of their particular
design or construction.

for this purpose we introduce the world's conceptually simplest (yet most impractical) clock. it
is  known  as  a  "light  clock"  and  consists  of  two  small  mirrors  mounted  on  a  bracket  facing  one
another, with a single photon of light bouncing back and forth between them (see figure 2.1). if the
mirrors are about six inches apart, it will take the photon about a billionth of a second to complete
one  round-trip  journey.  "ticks"  on  the  light  clock  may  be  thought  of  as  occurring  every  time  the
photon completes a round-trip—a billion ticks means that one second has elapsed.

we can use the light clock like a stopwatch to measure the time elapsed between events: we
simply  count  how  many  ticks  occur
 
 ___________________________
 
  during  the  period  of  interest  and  multiply  by  the  time
corresponding to one tick. for instance, if we are timing a horse race and count that between the start
and finish the number of round-trip photon journeys is 55 billion, we can conclude that the race took
55 seconds.

the reason we use the light clock in our discussion is that its mechanical simplicity pares away
extraneous  details  and  therefore  provides  us  with  the  clearest  insight  into  how  motion  affects  the
passage of time. to see this, imagine that we are idly watching the passage of time by looking at a
ticking light clock placed on a nearby table. then, all of sudden, a second light clock slides by on the
table, movin

g at constant velocity (see figure 2.2) the question we ask is whether the moving light
clock will tick at the same rate as the stationary light clock?

the clock "ticks" each time the photon completes a round-trip journey.

figure 2.2 a stationary light clock in the foreground while a second light clock slides by at constant
speed.

to  answer  the  question,  let's  consider  the  path,  from  our  perspective,  that  the  photon  in  the
sliding clock must take in order for it to result in a tick. the photon starts at the base of the sliding
clock, as in figure 2.2, and first travels to the upper mirror. since, from our perspective, the clock is

moving, the photon must travel a
 
 ___________________________
 
t an angle, as shown in figure 2.3. if the photon did not travel along
this path, it would miss the upper mirror and fly off into space. as the sliding clock has every right to
claim that it's stationary and everything else is moving, we know that the photon will hit the upper
mirror and hence the path we have drawn is correct. the photon bounces off the upper mirror and
again  travels  a  diagonal  path  to  hit  the  lower  mirror,  and  the  sliding  clock  ticks.  the  simple  but
essential  point  is  that  the  double  diagonal  path  that  we  see  the  photon  traverse  is longer  than  the
straight up-and-down path taken by the photon in the stationary clock; in addition to traversing the up-
and-down distance, the photon in the sliding clock must also travel to the right, from our perspective.
moreover, the constancy o
 
 ___________________________
 
f the speed of light tells us that the sliding clock's photon travels at exactly
the same speed as the stationary clock's photon. but since it must travel farther to achieve one tick it
will  tick less  frequently.  this  simple  argument  establishes  that  the  moving  light  clock,  from  our
perspective,  ticks  more  slowly  than  the  stationary  light  clock. and  since  we  have  agreed  that  the
number  of  ticks  directly  reflects  how  much  time  has  passed,  we  see  that  the  passage  of  time  has
slowed down for the moving clock.

figure 2.3 from our perspective, the photon in the sliding clock travel

and so the
moving  light  clock  and  its  attached  rolex must  still  measure  equal  time  durations;  the  rolex must
slow  down  in  exactly  the  same  way  that  the  light  clock  does.  regardless  of  brand,  type,  or
construction, clocks that are moving relative to one another record the passage of time at different
rates.

the light clock discussion also makes clear that the precise time difference between stationary
and moving clocks depends on how much farther the sliding clock's photon must travel to complete
each round-trip journey. this in turn depends on how quickly the sliding clock is moving—from the
viewpoint of a stationary observer, the faster the clock is sliding, the farther the photon must travel to
the right. we conclude that in comparison to a stationary clock, the rate of ticking of the sliding clock
becomes slower and slower as it moves faster and faster.3

d. for the clock to be able to travel an appreciable distance during the time for one tick it must
therefore be traveling enormously quickly—that is, some significant fraction of the speed of light. if it
is traveling at more commonplace speeds like 10 miles per hour, the distance it can move to the right
before one tick is completed is minuscule—just about 15 billionths of a foot. the extra distance that
the sliding photon must travel is tiny and it has a correspondingly tiny effect on the rate of ticking of
the moving clock. and again, by the principle of relativity, this is true for all clocks—that is, for time
itself. this is why beings such as ourselves who travel relative to one another at such slow speeds
are generally unaware of the distortions in the passage of time. the effects, although present to be
sure, are incredibly small. if, on the other hand, we were able to grab hold of the sliding clock and

 is diverted to light-speed motion through space. but having used up all of its motion
through  time,  this  is  the fastest  speed  through  space  that  the  object—any  object—can  possibly
achieve. this is analogous to our car being test-driven directly in the north-south direction. just as the
car will have no speed left for motion in the east-west dimension, something traveling at light speed
through space will have no speed left for motion through time. thus light does not get old; a photon
that emerged from the big bang is the same age today as it was then. there is no passage of time at
light speed.

what about e=mc2?

although  einstein  did  not  advocate  calling  his  theory  "relativity"  (suggesting  instead  the  name
"invariance" theory to reflect the unchanging character of the speed of light, among other things), the
meaning  of  the  term  is  now  clear.  einstein's  work  showed  that  concepts  such  as  space  and  time,

ter hits the ball, the sound reaches you moments after you see the
ball being hit. a similar thing happens in a thunderstorm. although lightning and thunder are produced
simultaneously, you see the lightning before hearing the thunder. again, this reflects the substantial
speed difference between light and sound. the success of special relativity informs us that the reverse
situation,  in  which  some  signal  reaches  us before  the  light  it  emits,  is  just  not  possible.  nothing
outruns photons.

here's the rub. in newton's theory of gravity, one body exerts a gravitational pull on another
with  a  strength  determined  solely  by  the  mass  of  the  objects  involved  and  the  magnitude  of  their
separation.  the  strength  has  nothing  to  do  with  how  long  the  objects  have  been  in  each  other's
presence. this means that if their mass or their separation should change, the objects will, according
to newton, immediately feel a change in their mutual gravitational attract

t, it causes a change in the
distortion of the spacetime fabric that spreads outward at light speed, precisely in keeping with the
cosmic  speed  limit  of  special  relativity.  thus,  we  on  earth  would  visually  learn  of  the  sun's
destruction  at  the  same  moment  that  we  would  feel  the  gravitational  consequences—about  eight
minutes  after  it  explodes.  einstein's  formulation  thereby  resolves  the  conflict;  gravitational
disturbances keep pace with, but do not outrun, photons.

the warping of time, revisited

illustrations such as those of figures 3.2, 3.4, and 3.6 capture the essence of what "warped space"
means.  a  warp  distorts  the  shape  of  space.  physicists  have  invented  analogous  images  to  try  to
convey the meaning of "warped time," but they are significantly more difficult to decipher, so we will
not introduce them here. instead, let's follow up the example of slim and jim on the tornado ride, and

whelmed by the light emitted by the sun. during a solar
eclipse, however, the moon temporarily blocks the light of the sun and distant stars become visible.
nevertheless, the presence of the sun still has an effect. light from some of the distant stars must pass
close to the sun on the way to earth. einstein's general relativity predicts that the sun will cause the
surrounding  space  and  time  to  warp  and  such  distortion will  influence  the  path  taken  by  the
starlight. after all, the photons of distant origin travel along the fabric of the universe; if the fabric is
warped, the motion of the photons will be affected much as for a material body. the bending of the
path of light is greatest for those light signals that just graze the sun on their way to earth. a solar
eclipse makes it possible to see such sun-grazing starlight without its being completely obscured by
sunlight itself.

the angle through which the light path is bent can be measured in a simple way. the bending of

here  is  what  all  this  has  to  do  with  the  photoelectric  effect.  based  on  the  experimental  data
reviewed above, einstein suggested incorporating planck's lumpy picture of wave energy into a new
description of light. a light beam, according to einstein, should actually be thought of as a stream of
tiny  packets—tiny  particles  of  light—which  were  ultimately  christened photons  by  the  chemist
gilbert lewis (an idea we made use of in our example of the light clock of chapter 2). to get a sense
of  scale,  according  to  this  particle  view  of  light,  a  typical  one-hundred-watt  bulb  emits  about  a
hundred  billion  billion  (1020)  photons  per  second.  einstein  used  this  new  conception  to  suggest  a

microscopic  mechanism  underlying  the  photoelectric  effect: an  electron  is  knocked  off  a  metallic
surface, he proposed, if it gets hit by a s
 
 ___________________________
 
ufficiently energetic photon. and what determines the energy
of  an  individual  photon?  to  explain  the  experimental  data,  einstein  followed  planck's  lead  and
proposed that the energy of each photon is proportional to the frequency of the light wave (with the
proportionality factor being planck's constant).

now, like the children's minimum departure fee, the electrons in a metal must be jostled by a
photon  posessing  a  certain  minimum  energy  in  order  to  be  kicked  off  the  surface.  (as  with  the
children fighting for money, it is extremely unlikely that any one electron gets hit by more than one
photon—most  don't  get  hit  at  all.)  but  if  the  impinging  light  beam's  frequency  is  too  low,  its
individual photons will lack the punch necessary to eject electrons. just as no children can afford to
leave  regardless  of  the  huge  total  number  of  coins  the  adults  showe

r  upon  them,  no  electrons  are
jostled free regardless of the huge total energy embodied in the impinging light beam, if its frequency
(and thus the energy of its individual photons) is too low.

but  just  as  children  are  able  to  leave  the  warehouse  as  soon  as  the  monetary  denomination
showered  upon  them  gets  large  enough,  electrons  will  be  knocked  off  the  surface  as  soon  as  the
frequency of the light shone on them—its energy denomination—gets high enough. moreover, just as
the  dollar-entrusted  adult  increases  the  total  money  thrown  down  by  increasing  the  number  of
individual  bills  tossed,  the  total  intensity  of  a  lig
 
 ___________________________
 
ht  beam  of  a  chosen  frequency  is  increased  by
increasing the number of photons it contains. and just as more dollars result in more children being
able to leave, more photons result in more electrons being hit and knocked clear off the surface. but
notice that the leftover energy that each of these electrons has after ripping free of the surface depends
solely on the energy of the photon that hits it—and this is determined by the frequency of the light
beam, not its total intensity. just as children leave the basement with 15 cents no matter how many
dollar bills are thrown down, each electron leaves the surface with the same energy—and hence the
same speed—regardless of the total intensity of the impinging light. more total money simply means
more  children  can  leave;  more  total  energy  in  the  light  beam  simply  means  more  electrons  are
knocked  free.  if  we
 
 ___________________________
 
  want  children  to  leave  the  basement  with  more  money,  we  must  increase  the
monetary denomination tossed down; if we want electrons to leave the surface with greater speed, we
must  increase  the  frequency  of  the  impinging  light  beam—that  is,  we  must  increase  the  energy
denomination of the photons we shine on the metallic surface.

this  is  precisely  in  accord  with  the  experimental  data.  the  frequency  of  the  light  (its  color)
determines the speed of the ejected electrons; the total intensity of the light determines the number of
ejected  electrons. and  so  einstein  showed  that  planck's  guess  of  lumpy  energy  actually  reflects  a
fundamental feature of electromagnetic waves: they are composed of particles—photons—that are
little bundles, or quanta, of light. th

it might appear.

is it a wave or is it a particle?

everyone  knows  that  water—and  hence  water  waves—are  composed  of  a  huge  number  of  water
molecules. so is it really surprising that light waves are also composed of a huge number of particles,
namely photons? it is. but the surprise is in the details. you see, more than three hundred years ago

newton  proclaimed  that  light  consisted  of  a  stream  of  particles,  so  the  idea  is  not  exactly  new.
however,  some  of  newton's  colleagues,  most  notably  the  dutch  physicist  christian  huygens,
disagreed  with  him  and  argued  that  light  is  a  wave.  the  debate  raged  but  ultimately  experiments
carried  out  by  the  english  physicist  thomas young  in  the  early  1800s  show

r view was defeated (although it took quite
some time before physicists accepted this). the prevailing wave view of light was subsequently put
on a mathematically firm foundation by maxwell.

figure 4.8 if light is a wave, then when both slits are open there will be interference between the
portions of the wave emerging from each slit.

but einstein, the man who brought down newton's revered theory of gravity, seems now to have
resurrected newton's particle model of light by his introduction of photons. of course, we still face
the  same  question:  how  can  a  particle  perspective  account  for  the  interference  pattern  shown  in
figure  4.8?  at  first  blush  you  might  make  the  following  suggestion.  water  is  composed  of  h 2o
molecules—the "particles" of water. nevertheless, when a lot of these molecules stream along with
one another they can produce water waves, with the attendant interference properties illustrated in
figure  4.7. and  so,  it  might  seem  reasonable  t
 
 ___________________________
 
o  guess  that  wave  properties,  such  as  interference
patterns, can arise from a particle picture of light provided a huge number of photons, the particles of
light, are involved.

in  reality,  though,  the  microscopic  world  is  far  more  subtle.  even  if  the  intensity  of  the  light
source in figure 4.8 is turned down and down, finally to the point where individual photons are being
fired one by one at the barrier—say at the rate of one every ten seconds—the resulting photographic
plate will still look like that in figure 4.8: so long as we wait long enough for a huge number of these
separate bundles of light to make it through the slits and to each be recorded by a single dot where
they hit the photographic plate, these dots will build up to form the image of an interference pattern,
the  image  in  figure  4.8.  this  is  astounding.  how  can individual p

hoton particles that sequentially
pass through the screen and separately hit the photographic plate conspire to produce the bright and
dark bands of interfering waves? conventional reasoning tells us that each and every photon passes
through either the left slit or the right slit and we would therefore expect to find the pattern shown in
figure 4.6. but we don't.

if you are not bowled over by this fact of nature, it means that either you have seen it before and
have become blase or the description so far has not been sufficiently vivid. so, in case it's the latter,
let's describe it again, but in a slightly different way. you close off the left slit and fire the photons

again with a new photographic plate, but this time you open both slits. naturally enough, you think that
this  will  only  increase  the  number  of  photons  that  pass  through  the  slits  in  the  barrier  and  hit  the
photographic  plate,  thereby  exposing  the  film  to  more  total  light  than  in  your  first  run  of  the
experiment. but when you later examine the image produced, you find that not only are there places on
the photographic plate that were dark in the first experiment and are now bright, as expected, there
are also places on the photographic plate that were bright in your first experiment but are now dark,
as in figure 4.

8. by increasing the number of individual photons that hit the photographic plate you
ha v e decreased  the  brightness  in  certain  areas.  somehow,  temporally  separated,  individual
particulate  photons  are  able  to  cancel  each  other  out.  think  about  how  crazy  this  is:  photons  that
would have passed through the right slit and hit the film in one of the dark bands in figure 4.8 fail to
do so when the left slit is opened (which is why the band is now dark). but how in the world can a
tiny bundle of light that passes through one slit be at all affected by whether or not the other slit is
open? as feynman noted, it's as strange as if you fire a machine gun at the screen, and when both slits
are open, independent, separately fired bullets somehow cancel one another out,

such  experiments  show  that  einstein's  particles  of  light  are  quite  different  from  newton's.
somehow photons—although they are particles—embody wave-like features of light as well. the fact
that the energy of these particles is determined by a wave-like feature—frequency—is the first clue
that a strange union is occurring. but the photoelectric effect and the double-slit experiment really
bring the lesson home. the photoelectric effect shows that light has particle properties. the double-
slit experiment shows that light manifests the interference properties of waves. together they show
that

mass  should  have  a  wave-like  incarnation  as  well.  after  carefully  working
through this line of thought, he suggested that just as light is a wave phenomenon that quantum theory
shows  to  have  an  equally  valid  particle  description,  an  electron—which  we  normally  think  of  as
being a particle—might have an equally valid description in terms of waves. einstein immediately
took to de broglie's idea, as it was a natural outgrowth of his own contributions of relativity and of
photons. even so, nothing is a substitute for experimental proof. such proof was soon to come from
the work of clinton davisson and lester germer.

in the mid-1920s, davisson and germer, experimental physicists at the bell telephone company,
were studying how a beam of electrons bounces off of a chunk of nickel. the only detail that matters
for  us  is  that  the  nickel  crystals  in  such  an  experiment  act  very  much  like  the  two  slits  in  the
experiment illustrated by the figures of the la

r experiment therefore showed that electrons exhibit interference phenomena, the telltale sign of
waves. at dark spots on the phosphorescent screen, electrons were somehow "canceling each other
out" just like the overlapping peak and trough of water waves. even if the beam of fired electrons
was "thinned" so that, for instance, only one electron was emitted every ten seconds, the individual
electrons  still  built  up  the  bright  and  dark  bands—one  spot  at  a  time.  somehow,  as  with  photons,
individual  electrons  "interfere"  with  themselves  in  the  sense  that  individual  electrons,  over  time,
reconstruct the interference pattern associated with waves. we are inescapably forced to conclude
that each electron embodies a wave-like character in conjunction with its more familiar depiction as

although  we  have  described  this  in  the  case  of  electrons,  similar  experiments  lead  to  the

either goes through the left slit or the right slit. you might think this to be such a basic property of how
things work that challenging it is fatuous. after all, can't you look in the region between the slits and
the phosphorescent screen to determine through which slit each electron passes? you can. but now
you have changed the experiment. to see the electron you must do something to it—for instance, you

electron's position with an "ever gentler" light source in order to have an ever decreasing impact on
its motion? from the standpoint of nineteenth-century physics we can. by using an ever dimmer lamp
(and an ever more sensitive light detector) we can have a vanishingly small impact on the electron's
motion.  but  quantum  mechanics  itself  illuminates  a  flaw  in  this  reasoning.  as  we  turn  down  the
intensity of the light source we now know that we are decreasing the number of photons it emits. once
we  get  down  to  emitting  individual  photons  we  cannot  dim  the  light  any  further  without  actually
turning it off. there is a fundamental quantum-mechanical limit to the "gentleness" of our probe. and
hence,  there  is  always  a  minimal  disruption  that  we  cause  to  the  electron's  velocity  through  our
measurement of its position.

lower  frequency  (larger  and  larger  wavelength)  we  can  therefore  produce  ever  gentler  individual
photons. but here's the catch. when we bounce a wave off of an object, the information we receive is

only  enough  to  determine  the  object's  position  to  within  a margin  of  error  equal  to  the  wave's
wavelength. to get an intuitive feel for this important fact, imagine trying to pinpoint the location of a
large, slightly submerged rock by the way it affects passing ocean waves. as the waves approach the
rock,  they  form  a  nice  orderly  train  of  one  up  and-down  wave  cycle  follow

rock's presence. but like the finest set of tick marks on a ruler, the individual up-and-down wave
cycles are the finest units making up the wave-train, and therefore by examining solely how they are
disrupted we can determine the rock's location only to within a margin of error equal to the length of
the  wave  cycles,  that  is,  the  wave's  wavelength.  in  the  case  of  light,  the  constituent  photons  are,
roughly speaking, the individual wave cycles (with the height of the wave cycles being determined by
the number of photons); a photon, therefore, can be used to pinpoint an object's location only to within
a precision of one wavelength.

and so we are faced with a quantum-mechanical balancing act. if we use high-frequency (short
wavelength) light we can locate an electron with greater precision. but high-frequency photons are

comparatively  low  energy,  but  we  sacrifice  precision  in  determining  the  electron's  position.
heisenberg quantified this competition and found a mathematical relationship between the precision
with  which  one  measures  the  electron's  position  and  the  precision  with  which  one  measures  its

electrons: by shining light of ever higher frequency on electrons, we measure their position with ever
greater precision, but at a cost, since our observations become ever more disruptive. high-frequency
photons have a lot of energy and therefore give the electrons a sharp "kick," significantly changing
their velocities. like the frenzy in a room full of children all of whose momentary positions you know

closer to the truth. even without "direct hits" from an experimenter's disruptive photon, the electron's
velocity severely and unpredictably changes from one moment to the next. but even this example does
not fully reveal the stunning microscopic features of nature entailed by heisenberg's discovery. even
in the most quiescent setting imaginable, such as an empty region of space, the uncertainty principle

you can pretty much invoke the image of a classical field—say, as an ocean of invisible field lines
permeating  space—but  you  should  refine  this  image  in  two  ways.  first,  you  should  envision  a
quantum field as composed of particulate ingredients, such as photons for the electromagnetic field.
second,  you  should  imagine  energy,  in  the  form  of  particles'  masses  and  their  motion,  endlessly
shifting back and forth from one quantum field to another as they continually vibrate through space and

absolutely astonishing agreement between abstract theoretical calculation and the real world. through
quantum electrodynamics, physicists have been able to solidify the role of photons as the "smallest
possible bundles of light" and to reveal their interactions with electrically charged particles such as
electrons, in a mathematically complete, predictive, and convincing framework.

the success of quantum electrodynamics inspired other physicists in the 1960s and 1970s to try
an analogous approach for developing a quantum-mechanical understanding of the weak, the strong,
and  the  gravitational  forces.  for  the  weak  and  the  strong  forces,  this  proved  to  be  an  im

the  three  families  of  matter  particles  the  standard  theory,  or  (more  often)  the standard  model  of
particle physics.

messenger particles

according to the standard model, just as the photon is the smallest constituent of an electromagnetic
field, the strong and the weak force fields have smallest constituents as well. as we discussed briefly
in chapter 1, the smallest bundles of the strong force are known as gluons, and those of the weak
force are known as weak gauge bosons (or more precisely, the w and z bosons). the standard model
instructs us to think of these force particles as having no internal structure—in this framework they

the  photons,  gluons,  and  weak  gauge  bosons  provide  the  microscopic  mechanism  for
transmitting  the  forces  they  constitute.  for  example,  when  one  electrically  charged  particle  repels
another of like electric charge, you can think of it roughly in terms of each particle being surrounded
by  an  electric  field—a  "cloud"  or  "mist"  of  "electric-essence"—and  the  force  each  particle  feels

description of how they repel each other, though, is somewhat different. an electromagnetic field is
composed of a swarm of photons; the interaction between two charged particles actually arises from
their "shooting" photons back and forth between themselves. in rough analogy to the way in which you
can affect a fellow ice-skater's motion and your own by hurling a barrage of bowling balls at him or
her, two electrically charged particles influence each other by exchanging these smallest bundles of
light.

an important failing of the ice-skater analogy is that the exchange of bowling balls is always
"repulsive"—it  always  drives  the  skaters  apart.  on  the  contrary,  two  oppositely  charged  particles
also

 interact  through  the  exchange  of  photons,  although  the  resulting  electromagnetic  force  is
attractive.  it's  as  if  the  photon  is  not  so  much  the  transmitter  of  the  force  per  se,  but  rather  the
transmitter of a message of how the recipient must respond to the force in question. for like-charged
particles,  the  photon  carries  the  message  "move  apart,"  while  for  oppositely  charged  particles  it
carries  the  message  "come  together."  for  this  reason  the  photon  is  sometimes  referred  to  as  the
messenger particle for the electromagnetic force. similarly, the gluons and weak gauge bosons are
the messenger particles for the strong and weak nuclear forces. the strong force, which keeps quarks
locked  up  inside  of  protons  and  neutrons,  arises  from  individual  quarks  exchanging  gluons.

although  the  reasoning  involved  is  somewhat  more  abstract,  physicists  have  found  that  a  similar
alignment exists between other detailed aspects of a string's pattern of vibration and its properties vis
a vis other forces. the electric charge, the weak charge, and the strong charge carried by a particular
string, for instance, are determined by the precise way it vibrates. moreover, exactly the same idea
holds for the messenger particles themselves. particles like photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons
are yet other resonant patterns of string vibration. and of particular importance, among the vibrational
string patterns, one matches perfectly the properties of the graviton, ensuring that gravity is an integral
part of string theory.7

so we see that, according to string theory, the observed properties of each elementary particle
arise because its internal string undergoes a particular resonant vibrational pattern. this perspective

express this by saying that the "natural" or "typical" energy scale (and hence mass scale) of string
theory is the planck scale.

this raises a crucial question directly related to the goal of reproducing the particle properties
in tables 1.1 and 1.2: if the "natural" energy scale of string theory is some ten billion billion times
that of a proton, how can it possibly account for the far-lighter particles—electrons, quarks, photons,
and so on—making up the world around us?

the answer, once again, comes from quantum mechanics. the uncertainty principle ensures that
nothing is ever perfectly at rest. all objects undergo quantum jitter, for if they didn't we would know
where  they  were  and  how  fast  they  were  moving  with  complete  precision,  in  violation  of
heisenberg's dictum. this holds true for the loops in string theory as well; no matter how placid a

means and how it resolves the conflict. we discuss each in turn.

the rough answer

although  it  sounds  unsophisticated,  one  way  that  we  learn  about  the  structure  of  an  object  is  by
hurling other things at it and observing the precise way in which they are deflected. we are able to
see  things,  for  example,  because  our  eyes  collect  and  our  brains  decode  information  carried  by
photons  as  they  bounce  off  of  objects  being  viewed.  particle  accelerators  are  based  on  the  same
principle: they hurl bits of matter such as electrons and protons at each other as well as at other
targets, and elaborate detectors analyze the resulting spray of debris to determine the architecture of
the objects involved.

as a general rule, the size of the probe particle that we use sets a lower limit to the length scale
to which we are sensitive. to get a feel for what this important st

accurate "still life" renditions. the unusual feature of jim's challenge is that neither he nor slim will
be  allowed  to  look  at  the  peach  pits.  instead,  each  is  allowed  to  learn  about  the  size,  shape,  and
features of his peach pit only by shooting things (other than photons!) at the pit and observing how
they are deflected, as illustrated in figure 6.4. unbeknownst to slim, jim fills slim's "shooter" with
marbles (as in figure 6.4(a)) but fills his own shooter with far smaller five-millimeter plastic pellets
(as in figure 6.4(b)). they both turn on their shooters, and the competition begins.

the  most  appropriate  measure  of  a  particle's  probing  sensitivity  is  its  quantum  wavelength,  which
indicates the window of uncertainty in its position. this fact reflects our discussion of heisenberg's
uncertainty principle in chapter 4, in which we found that the margin of error incurred when using a
point  particle  as  a  probe  (we  focused  on  photon  probes  but  the  discussion  applies  to  all  other
particles) is about equal to the probe particle's quantum wave-length. in somewhat looser language,

the details are a little different.

figure 6.5 two particles interact—they "slam together"—and cause the path of each to be deflected.

for  concreteness  and  simplicity,  imagine  that  one  of  the  two  particles  is  an  electron  and  the
other is its antiparticle, the positron. when matter and antimatter collide, they can annihilate in a flash
of pure energy, producing, for example, a photon.9 to distinguish the ensuing trajectory of the photon
from the previous trajectories of the electron and positron, we follow a traditional physics convention
and draw it with a wiggly line. the photon will typically travel for a bit and then release the energy
derived  from  the  initial  electron-positron  pair  by  producing  another  electron-positron  pair  with
trajectories as indicated on the far right of figure 6.6. in the end, two particles are fired at each other,
they interact through

 the electromagnetic force, and finally they emerge on deflected trajectories, a
sequence of events that bears some similarity to our description of colliding billiard balls.

figure  6.6  in  quantum  field  theory,  a  particle  and  its  antiparticle  can  momentarily  annihilate  one
another,  producing  a  photon.  subsequently,  this  photon  can  give  rise  to  another  particle  and
antiparticle traveling along different trajectories.

we are concerned with the details of the interaction—specifically, the point where the initial
electron and positron annihilate and produce the photon. the central fact, as will become apparent, is
that there is an unambiguous, completely identifiable time and place where this happens: it is marked
in figure 6.6.

these loops are vibrating in just the right resonance patterns, they will correspond to an electron and a
positron on collision course, just as in figure 6.6. only when examined at the most minute distance
scales, far smaller than anything our present technology can access, is their true stringlike character
apparent. as in the point-particle case, the two strings collide and again annihilate each other in a
flash. the flash, a photon, is itself a string in a particular vibrational pattern. thus, the two incoming
strings interact by merging together and producing a third string, as shown in figure 6.7. just as in our
point-particle description, this string travels a bit, and then releases the energy derived from the two
initial  strings  by  dissociating  into  two  strings  that  travel  onward.  again,  from  any  but  the  most
microscopic perspective, this will look just like the point-particle interaction of figure 6.6.

if we apply exactly the same reasoning to the interaction of point particles, as summarized in
figure 6.11, we recover the conclusion stated earlier—there is a definite point in space and moment
in time when the point particles interact. point particles cram all of their interaction into a definite
point.  when  the  force  involved  in  an  interaction  is  the  gravitational  force—that  is,  when  the
messenger particle involved in the interaction is the graviton instead of the photon—this complete
packing of the force's punch into a single point leads to disastrous results, such as the infinite answers
we alluded to earlier. strings, by contrast, "smear" out the place where interactions occur. because
different observers perceive that the interaction takes place at various locations along the left part of
the  surface  of  figure  6.10,  in  a  real  sense  this  means  that  the  interaction  location  is  smeared  out
among all of them. this spreads out the force's punc

table 1.1. this is true down to the last detail: all of the matter particles (and their antimatter partners
as well) have spin equal to that of the electron. in the language of the trade, physicists say that matter
particles  all  have  "spin-1/2,"  where  the  value  1/2  is,  roughly  speaking,  a  quantum-mechanical
measure  of  how  quickly  the  particles  rotate.2  moreover,  physicists  have  shown  that  the
nongravitational force carriers—photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—also possess an intrinsic
spinning characteristic that turns out to be twice that of the matter particles. they all have "spin-1."

what  about  gravity?  well,  even  before  string  theory,  physicists  were  able  to  determine  what
spin the hypothesized graviton must have to be the transmitter of the gravitational force. the answer:
twice the spin of photons, weak gauge bosons, and gluons—i.e., "spin-2."

in the context of string theory, spin—just like

partner  of  the  electron;  this  hypothetical  particle  has  been  named  the selectron  (a  contraction  of
supersymmetric-electron).  the  same  should  also  be  true  for  the  other  matter  particles,  with,  for
example, the hypothetical spin-0 superpartners of neutrinos and quarks being called sneutrinos and
squarks. similarly, the force particles should have spin-1/2 superpartners: for photons there should
be photinos, for the gluons there should be gluinos, for the w and z bosons there should be winos and
zinos.

reasoning  might  lead  to  the  conclusion  that  even  unwrapped  strings  have  a  minuscule  yet  nonzero
minimum mass. in a sense this is true, but the quantum-mechanical effects encountered in chapter 6—
remember the price is right, again—are able to exactly cancel this contribution to the mass. this is
how, we recall, unwrapped strings can yield the zero-mass photon, graviton, and the other massless
or near-massless particles, for example. wrapped strings are different in this regard.)

how does the existence of wrapped string configurations affect the geometrical properties of the
dimension  around  which  the  strings  wind?  the  answer,  first  recognized  in  1984  by  the  japanese
physicists keiji kikkawa and masami yamasaki, is bizarre and remarkable.

string vibration arising from the space-tearing conifold transition is the microscopic description of a
massless particle into which the black hole has transmuted.  we  concluded  that  as  a  calabi-yau
shape goes through a space-tearing conifold transition, an initially massive black hole becomes ever
lighter until it is massless and then it transmutes into a massless particle—such as a massless photon
—which in string theory is nothing but a single string executing a particular vibrational pattern. in this
way,  for  the  first  time,  string  theory  explicitly  establishes  a  direct,  concrete,  and  quantitatively
unassailable connection between black holes and elementary particles.

the uncertainty principle ensures that even the vacuum of empty space is a teeming, roiling frenzy of
virtual particles momentarily erupting into existence and subsequently annihilating one another. this
jittery quantum behavior also occurs in the region of space just outside the event horizon of a black
hole. hawking realized, however, that the gravitational might of the black hole can inject energy into
a pair of virtual photons, say, that tears them just far enough apart so that one gets sucked into the
hole. with its partner having disappeared into the abyss of the hole, the other photon of the pair no
longer has a partner with which to annihilate. instead, hawking showed that the remaining photon gets
an energy boost from the gravitational force of the black hole and, as its partner falls inward, it gets
shot outward, away from the black hole. hawking realized that to someone looking at the black hole

the universe, by and large, became transparent. prior to the era of electron capture, the universe was
filled with a dense plasma of electrically charged particles—some with positive charges like nuclei
and  others  with  negative  charges,  like  electrons.  photons,  which  interact  only  with  electrically
charged  objects,  were  bumped  and  jostled  incessantly  by  the  thick  bath  of  charged  particles,
traversing hardly any distance before being deflected or absorbed. the charged-particle barrier to the
free motion of photons would have made the universe appear almost completely opaque, much like
what you may have experienced in a dense morning fog or a blinding, gusty snowstorm. but when

about a billion years later, with the universe having substantially calmed down from its frenetic
beginnings, galaxies, stars, and ultimately planets began to emerge as gravitationally bound clumps of

principles, subjecting substances like freon to repeated cycles of compression and expansion (as well

simple facts of terrestrial physics, it turns out that they have a profound incarnation in the cosmos as a
whole.

we saw above that after electrons and nuclei join together to form atoms, photons are free to
travel  unimpeded  throughout  the  universe.  this  means  that  the  universe  is  filled  with  a  "gas"  of
photons  traveling  this  way  and  that,  uniformly  distributed  throughout  the  cosmos. as  the  universe
expands, this gas of freely streaming photons expands as well since, in essence, the universe is its
container. and  just  as  the  temperature  of  a  more  conventional  gas  (like  the  air  in  a  bicycle  tire)

physicists as far back as george gamow and his students ralph alpher and robert hermann in the
1950s, and robert dicke and jim peebles in the mid-1960s, realized that the present-day universe
should be permeated by an almost uniform bath of these primordial photons, which, through the last
15 billion years of cosmic expansion, have cooled to a mere handful of degrees above absolute zero.1
in 1965, arno penzias and robert wilson of bell laboratories in new jersey accidentally made one
of the most important discoveries of our age when they detected this afterglow of the big bang while
working  on  an  antenna  intended  for  use  with  communication  satellites.  subsequent  research  has
refined both theory and experiment, culminating in measurements take

. with these data, physicists and astronomers have
confirmed  to  high  precision  that  the  universe is filled with microwave radiation (if our eyes were
sensitive to microwaves, we would see a diffuse glow in the world around us) whose temperature is
about 2.7 degrees above absolute zero, exactly in keeping with the expectation of the big bang theory.
in  concrete  terms,  in every cubic meter of the universe—including the one you now occupy—there
are,  on  average,  about  400  million  photons  that  collectively  compose  the  vast  cosmic  sea  of
microwave  radiation,  an  echo  of  creation. a  percentage  of  the  "snow"  you  see  on  your  television
screen  when  you  disconnect  the  cable  feed  and  tune  to  a  station  that  has  ceased  its  scheduled
broadcasts is due to this dim aftermath of the big bang. this match between theory and experiment
confirms the big bang picture of cosmology as far back as the time that photons first moved freely

ns between various locations, or
whether  we  should  view  ourselves  as  truly  being  embedded  in something  when  we  refer  to  our
immersion within the spacetime fabric.

although we are heading into speculative territory, string theory does suggest an answer to this
question. the graviton, the smallest bundle of gravitational force, is one particular pattern of string
vibration. and  just  as  an  electromagnetic  field  such  as  visible  light  is  composed  of  an  enormous
number of photons, a gravitational field is composed of an enormous number of gravitons—that is, an

enormous number of strings executing the graviton vibrational pattern. gravitational fields, in turn,
are encoded in the warping of the spacetime fabric, and hence we are led to identify the fabric of
spacetime itself with a colossal number of strings all undergoing the same, orderly, graviton pattern
of vibration. in the language of the field, such an enormous, organized array of similarly vibrating

same way that a rock dropped from a cliff is dragged to a slower speed when it enters a body of
water.  this  slowing  of  light  relative  to  its  speed  through  a  vacuum  is  of  no  consequence  for  our
discussion of relativity and is justifiably ignored throughout the text.

3.  for  the  mathematically  inclined  reader,  we  note  that  these  observations  can  be  turned  into
quantitative statements. for instance, if the moving light clock has speed v and it takes t seconds for
its photon to complete one round-trip journey (as measured by our stationary light clock), then the
light clock will have traveled a distance vt when its photon has returned to the lower mirror. we can
now use the pythagorean theorem to calculate that the length of each of the diagonal paths in figure
(vt/2)2 + h2, where h is the distance between the two mirrors of a light clock (taken to be six

to be the case, there
is the exciting prospect that many of the remarkable implications of string theory discussed in this and
the following chapters will be verifiable experimentally within the next decade. but even in the more

"conventional" scenario espoused by string theorists, in which strings are typically on the order of 10-
33 centimeters in length, there are indirect ways to search for them experimentally, as we will discuss
in chapter 9.

9. the expert reader will recognize that the photon produced in a collision between an electron
and a positron is a virtual photon and therefore must shortly relinquish its energy by dissociating into
a particle-antiparticle pair.

10. of course, a camera works by collecting photons that bounce off the object of interest and
recording them on a piece of photographic film. our use of a camera in this example is symbolic,
since we are not imagining bouncing photons off of the colliding strings. rather, we simply want to
record in figure 6.7(c) the

15. in fact, the space-tearing conifold transitions discussed in this chapter involve black holes
and hence might seem to be tied up with the question of their singularities. but recall that the conifold
tear  occurs  just  as  the  black  hole  has  shed  all  its  mass,  and  is  therefore  not  directly  related  to
questions concerning black hole singularities.

1.  more  precisely,  the  universe  should  be  filled  with  photons  conforming  to  the  radiation
thermally emitted by a perfectly absorbent body—a "black-body" in the language of thermodynamics
—with  the  stated  temperature  range.  this  is  the  same  radiation  spectrum  emitted  quantum
mechanically by black holes, as explained by hawking, and by a hot oven, as explained by planck.

numerics.  in  particular,  although  special  relativity  declares  that  nothing  can  travel  faster  than  the
speed of light, this does not preclude two photons carried along on the expanding spatial fabric from
receeding from one another at a speed exceeding that of light. for example, at the time the universe
first became transparent, about 300,000 years atb, locations in the heavens that were about 900,000
light-years  apart  would  have  been  able  to  have  influenced  each  other,  even  though  the  distance
between them exceeds 300,000 light-years. the extra factor of three comes from the expansion of the
spatial fabric. this means that as we
