live before them . . .

the manager. oh this is grand! you want to come before the public yourselves then?

the father. as we are . . .

the manager. i can assure you it would be a magnificent spectacle!

leading man. what's the use of us here anyway then?

the manager. you're not going to pretend that you can act? it makes me laugh! [the actors laugh.] there, you see, they are laughing at the notion. but, by the way, i must cast the parts. that won't be difficult. they cast themselves. [to the second lady lead.] you play the mother. [to the father.] we must find her a name.

the father. amalia, sir.

the manager. but that is the real name of your wife. we don't want to call her by her real name.

the father. why ever not, if it is her name? . . . still, perhaps, if that lady must . . . [makes a slight motion of the hand to indicate the second lady lead.] i see this woman here [means the mother.] as amalia. but do as you like.

[the second lady lead and the juvenile lead at this point separate themselves from the group of actors. one watches the mother attentively; the other moves about studying the movements and manner of the son whom he will have to act.]

the son [to manager]. what do you mean by both at the same time? it isn't right. there was no scene between me and her. [indicates the mother.] ask her how it was!

the mother. yes, it's true. i had come into his room . . .

the son. into my room, do you understand? nothing to do

the manager. it doesn't matter. haven't i told you we've got to group the action?

the son [observing the juvenile lead studying him]. what do you want?

the juvenile lead. nothing! i was just looking at you.

the son [turning towards the second lady lead]. ah! she's at it too: to re-act her part! [indicating the mother.]

the manager. exactly! and it seems to me that you ought to be grateful to them for their interest.
