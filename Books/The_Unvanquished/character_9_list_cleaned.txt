mrs. compson and mrs. habersham  - 
      two respectable ladies of jefferson who meddle in drusilla's affairs. mrs. habersham is the more aggressive of the two, offering drusilla unwanted sympathy for her "condition" and gossiping about her relationship with colonel sartoris. with aunt louisa, they represent the hypocritical, vindictive side of southern womanhood, more concerned with appearances than with truth or real kindness.
