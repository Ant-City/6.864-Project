tonished to find that franklin in his early years struggled with the
same everyday passions and difficulties that he himself experiences,
and he loses the sense of discouragement that comes from a
realization of his own shortcomings and inability to attain.

there are other reasons why the _autobiography_ should be an intimate
friend of american young people. here they may establish a close
relationship with one of the foremost americans as well as one of the
wisest men of his age.

the life of benjamin franklin is of importance to every american
primarily because of the part he played in securing the independence
of the united states and in establishing it as a nation. franklin
shares with washington the honors of the revolution, and of the events
leading to the birth of the new nation. while washington was the
animating spirit of the struggle in the colonies, franklin was its
ablest champion abroad. to franklin's cogent reasoning and keen
satire, we owe the clear and forcible presentation of the amer

minister to france. by him it was later sold to mr. e. dwight church
of new york, and passed with the rest of mr. church's library into the
possession of mr. henry e. huntington. the original manuscript of
franklin's _autobiography_ now rests in the vault in mr. huntington's
residence at fifth avenue and fifty-seventh street, new york city.

when mr. bigelow came to examine his purchase, he was astonished to
find that what people had been reading for years as the authentic
_life of benjamin franklin by himself_, was only a garbled and
incomplete version of the real _autobiography_. temple franklin had
taken unwarranted liberties with the original. mr. bigelow says he
found more than twelve hundred changes in the text. in 1868,
therefore, mr. bigelow published the standard edition of franklin's
_autobiography_. it corrected errors in the previous editions and was
the first english edition to contain the short fourth part,
comprising the last few pages of the manuscript, written during the

dear son: i have ever had pleasure in obtaining any little anecdotes
of my ancestors. you may remember the inquiries i made among the
remains of my relations when you were with me in england, and the
journey i undertook for that purpose. imagining it may be equally
agreeable to you to know the circumstances of my life, many of which
you are yet unacquainted with, and expecting the enjoyment of a wee

satyr. my brother's discharge was accompany'd with an order of the
house (a very odd one), that "_james franklin should no longer print
the paper called the new england courant_."

there was a consultation held in our printing-house among his friends,
what he should do in this case. some proposed to evade the order by
changing the name of the paper; but my brother, seeing inconveniences
in that, it was finally concluded on as a better way, to let it be
printed for the future under the name of benjamin franklin; and to
avoid the censure of the assembly, that might fall on him as still
printing it by his apprentice, the contrivance was that my old
indenture should be return'd to me, with a full discharge on the back
of it, to be shown on occasion, but to secure to him the benefit of my
service, i was to sign new indentures for the remainder of the term,
which were to be kept private. a very flimsy scheme it was; however,
it was immediately executed, and the paper went on accordingly, under

 hopes of success. there was much scribbling pro and con upon the
occasion; and finding that, tho' an elegant preacher, he was but a
poor writer, i lent him my pen and wrote for him two or three
pamphlets, and one piece in the gazette of april, 1735. those
pamphlets, as is generally the case with controversial writings, tho'
eagerly read at the time, were soon out of vogue, and i question
whether a single copy of them now exists.[76]

during the contest an unlucky occurrence hurt his cause exceedingly.
one of our adversaries having heard him preach a sermon that was much
admired, thought he had somewhere read the sermon before, or at least
a part of it. on search, he found that part quoted at length, in one
of the british reviews, from a discourse of dr. foster's.[77] this
detection gave many of our party disgust, who accordingly abandoned
his cause, and occasion'd our more

bibliography


the last and most complete edition of franklin's works is that by the
late professor albert h. smyth, published in ten volumes by the
macmillan company, new york, under the title, _the writings of
benjamin franklin_. the other standard edition is the _works of
benjamin franklin_ by john bigelow (new york, 1887). mr. bigelow's
first edition of the _autobiography_ in one volume was published by
the j. b. lippincott company of philadelphia in 1868. the life of
franklin as a writer is well treated by j. b. mcmaster in a volume of
_the american men of letters series_; his life as a statesman and
diplomat, by j. t. morse, _american statesmen series_, one volume;
houghton, mifflin company publish both books. a m

account of the life and times of franklin may be found in james
parton's _life and times of benjamin franklin_ (2 vols., new york,
1864). paul leicester ford's _the many-sided franklin_ is a most
chatty and readable book, replete with anecdotes and excellently and
fully illustrated. an excellent criticism by woodrow wilson introduces
an edition of the _autobiography_ in _the century classics_ (century
co., new york, 1901). interesting magazine articles are those of e. e.
hale, _christian examiner_, lxxi, 447; w. p. trent, _mcclure's
magazine_, viii, 273; john hay, _the century magazine_, lxxi, 447.
