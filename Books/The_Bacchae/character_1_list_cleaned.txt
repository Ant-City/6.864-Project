[CHARACTER] - 
      [CHARACTER] is the king of thebes, son of agaue, grandson of cadmus and the first cousin of dionysus. structurally [CHARACTER] is dionysus's foil, thus he is a preserver of law and order, a military man, a stern patriarch, and ultimately a doomed mortal. [CHARACTER] is not merely a mirror or inverted double of dionysus; he is puritanical and obstinate, but also curious and voyeuristic.
