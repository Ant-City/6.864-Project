the [CHARACTER] - 
                    stout
and brawny, the [CHARACTER] has a wart on his nose and a big mouth, both
literally and figuratively. he threatens the host's notion of propriety
when he drunkenly insists on telling the second tale. indeed, the [CHARACTER]
seems to enjoy overturning all conventions: he ruins the host's
carefully planned storytelling order; he rips doors off hinges;
and he tells a tale that is somewhat blasphemous, ridiculing religious
clerks, scholarly clerks, carpenters, and women.
