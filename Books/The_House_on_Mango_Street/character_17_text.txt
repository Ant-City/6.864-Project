l look again if you want me to. and she looks 

again into the cards, palm, water, and says  uh-huh. 

a home in  the  heart,  i  was  right. 
only  i don't get it. 
a new house, a house made of heart. i'll light a candle 

for you. 

all  this for five  dollars  i give  her. 
thank  you  and  goodbye  and  be  careful  of the  evil 
eye.  come  back  again  on  a  thursday when  the  stars  are 
stronger.  and  may  the  virgin  bless  you.  and  shuts  the 
door.

aspirin.  how does she explain? 

she met him at a dance. geraldo in his shiny shirt and
