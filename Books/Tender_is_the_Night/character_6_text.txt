‘what’s this?’
‘you realize the people in the centre of the floor can’t
hear what i say, but you can?’
‘a waiter told us about it,’ said miss warren. ‘corner to
corner— it’s like wireless.’
it was exciting up on the mountain, like a ship at sea.
presently marmora’s parents joined them. they treated the
warrens with respect—dick gathered that their fortunes
had something to do with a bank in milan that had something
to do with the warren fortunes. but baby warren

wanted to talk to dick, wanted to talk to him with the impetus
that sent her out vagrantly toward all new men, as
though she were on an inelastic tether and considered that
she might as well get to the end of it as soon as possible. she
crossed and recrossed her knees frequently in the manner
of tall restless virgins.

went off, went on again. then the storm came swiftly, first
falling from the heavens, then doubly falling in torrents
from the mountains and washing loud down the roads
and stone ditches; with it came a dark, frightening sky and
savage filaments of lightning and world-splitting thunder,
while ragged, destroying clouds fled along past the hotel.
mountains and lake disappeared—the hotel crouched amid
tumult, chaos and darkness.
by this time dick and nicole had reached the vestibule,
where baby warren and the three marmoras were anxiously
awaiting them. it was exciting coming out of the wet
fog—with the doors banging, to stand and laugh and quiver
with emotion, wind in their ears and rain on their clothes.
now in the ballroom the orchestra was playing a strauss
waltz, high and confusing.
... for doctor diver to marry a mental patient? how did
it happen? where did it begin?
‘won’t you come back after you’ve changed?’ baby warren
asked after a close scrutiny.

sincerely,
beth evan warren.
dick was furious—miss warren had known he had a bicycle
with him; yet she had so phrased her note that it was
impossible to refuse. throw us together! sweet propinquity
and the warren money!
he was wrong; baby warren had no such intentions. she
had looked dick over with worldly eyes, she had measured
him with the warped rule of an anglophile and found him
wanting—in spite of the fact that she found him toothsome.
but for her he was too ‘intellectual’ and she pigeonholed
him with a shabby-snobby crowd she had once known in
london—he put himself out too much to be really of the
correct stuff. she could not see how he could be made into
her idea of an aristocrat.
in addition to that he was stubborn—s

with his cap, dick slapped the snow from his dark blue
ski-suit before going inside. the great hall, its floor pockmarked
by two decades of hobnails, was cleared for the
tea dance, and four-score young americans, domiciled in
schools near gstaad, bounced about to the frolic of ‘don’t
bring lulu,’ or exploded violently with the first percussions
of the charleston. it was a colony of the young, simple, and
expensive—the sturmtruppen of the rich were at st. moritz.
baby warren felt that she had made a gesture of renunciation
in joining the divers here.
dick picked out the two sisters easily across the delicately
haunted, soft-swaying room—they were poster-like,
formidable in their snow costumes, nicole’s of cerulean
blue, baby’s of brick red. the young englishman was talking
to them; but they were paying no attention, lulled to the
staring point by the adolescent dance.
nicole’s snow-warm face lighted up further as she saw
dick. ‘where is he?’

had managed to come all the way to gstaad.
he was forty. upon his healthy maturity reposed a set
of pleasant official manners, but he was most at home in
a somewhat stuffy safety from which he could despise the
broken rich whom he reeducated. his scientific heredity
might have bequeathed him a wider world but he seemed
to have deliberately chosen the standpoint of an humbler
class, a choice typified by his selection of a wife. at the hotel
baby warren made a quick examination of him, and failing
to find any of the hall-marks she respected, the subtler
virtues or courtesies by which the privileged classes recognized
one another, treated him thereafter with her second
manner. nicole was always a little afraid of him. dick liked
him, as he liked his friends, without reservations.
for the evening they were sliding down the hill into the
village, on those little sleds which serve the same purpose
as gondolas do in venice. their destination was a

‘i’m going there to-morrow, too,’ said dick.
‘oh, are you?’ exclaimed mckibben. ‘why not come with
us? it’s a big packard and there’s only my wife and my children
and myself— and the governess—‘
‘i can’t possibly—‘
‘of course she’s not really a governess,’ mckibben concluded,
looking rather pathetically at dick. ‘as a matter of
fact my wife knows your sister-in-law, baby warren.’
but dick was not to be drawn in a blind contract.
‘i’ve promised to travel with two men.’
‘oh,’ mckibben’s face fell. ‘well, i’ll say good-by.’ he unscrewed
two blooded wire-hairs from a nearby table and
departed; dick pictured the jammed packard pounding toward
innsbruck with the mckibbens and their children and
their baggage and yapping dogs— and the governess.

by, but he wanted to dine alone, and pretended an engagement
at the excelsior. he drank a cocktail with collis
and his vague dissatisfaction crystallized as impatience—
he no longer had an excuse for playing truant to the clinic.
this was less an infatuation than a romantic memory. nicole
was his girl—too often he was sick at heart about her,
yet she was his girl. time with rosemary was self-indulgence—
time with collis was nothing plus nothing.
in the doorway of the excelsior he ran into baby warren.
her large beautiful eyes, looking precisely like marbles,
stared at him with surprise and curiosity. ‘i thought you
were in america, dick! is nicole with you?’
‘i came back by way of naples.’
the black band on his arm reminded her to say: ‘i’m so
sorry to hear of your trouble.’
inevitably they dined together.
‘tell me about everything,’ she demanded.
dick gave her a version of the facts, and baby frowned.
she found it necessary to blame some one for the catastrophe

‘of course i like formality—i like things to be just so,
and on the grand scale. i know you probably don’t but you
must admit it’s a sign of solidity in me.’
dick did not even bother to dissent from this.
‘of course i know people say, baby warren is racing
around over europe, chasing one novelty after another, and
missing the best things in life, but i think on the contrary
that i’m one of the few people who really go after the best
things. i’ve known the most interesting people of my time.’
her voice blurred with the tinny drumming of another guitar
number, but she called over it, ‘i’ve made very few big
mistakes—‘
‘—only the very big ones, baby.’

and he made out the human and ghastly face of one of the
taxi-drivers.
‘go to the excelsior hotel,’ he cried faintly. ‘tell miss
warren. two hundred lire! miss warren. due centi lire! oh,
you dirty— you god—‘
still he was dragged along through the bloody haze,
choking and sobbing, over vague irregular surfaces into
some small place where he was dropped upon a stone floor.
the men went out, a door clanged, he was alone.

until one o’clock baby warren lay in bed, reading one
of marion crawford’s curiously inanimate roman stories;
then she went to a window and looked down into the street.
across from the hotel two carabinieri, grotesque in swaddling
capes and harlequin hats, swung voluminously from
this side and that, like mains’ls coming about, and watching
them she thought of the guards’ officer who had stared
at her so intensely at lunch. he had possessed the arrogance
of a tall member of a short race, with no obligation save

hard on dick, whom she admired and of whom she stood
in awe, who had been so appreciative and understanding
of herself. as for franz, once kaethe’s idea had had time to
sink in, he never after believed that dick was a serious person.
and as time went on he convinced himself that he had
never thought so.

dick told nicole an expurgated version of the catastrophe
in rome— in his version he had gone philanthropically
to the rescue of a drunken friend. he could trust baby warren
to hold her tongue, since he had painted the disastrous
effect of the truth upon nicole. all this, however, was a low
hurdle compared to the lingering effect of the episode upon
him.
in reaction he took himself for an intensified beating in
his work, so that franz, trying to break with him, could find
no basis on which to begin a disagreement. no friendship
worth the name was ever destroyed in an hour without some
painful flesh being torn—so franz let himself believe with

dick’s bitterness had surprised rosemary, who had
thought of him as all-forgiving, all-comprehending. suddenly
she recalled what it was she had heard about him. in
conversation with some state department people on the
boat,—europeanized americans who had reached a position
where they could scarcely have been said to belong
to any nation at all, at least not to any great power though
perhaps to a balkan-like state composed of similar citizens—the
name of the ubiquitously renowned baby warren
had occurred and it was remarked that baby’s younger sister
had thrown herself away on a dissipated doctor. ‘he’s not

received anywhere any more,’ the woman said.
the phrase disturbed rosemary, though she could not
place the divers as living in any relation to society where
such a fact, if fact it was, could have any meaning, yet the
hint of a hostile and organized public opinion rang in her
ears. ‘he’s not received anywhere any more.’ she pictured

them, he wanted to lift their beautiful heads off their necks
and hold them close for hours.
he embraced the old gardener who had made the first
garden at villa diana six years ago; he kissed the provençal
girl who helped with the children. she had been with them
for almost a decade and she fell on her knees and cried until
dick jerked her to her feet and gave her three hundred
francs. nicole was sleeping late, as had been agreed upon—
he left a note for her, and one for baby warren who was just
back from sardinia and staying at the house. dick took a big
drink from a bottle of brandy three feet high, holding ten
quarts, that some one had presented them with.

then he decided to leave his bags by the station in cannes
and take a last look at gausse’s beach.
the beach was peopled with only an advance guard of
children when nicole and her sister arrived that morning.

a windless day. waiters
