Lady Gertrude Chiltern  - 
      A woman of grave Greek beauty and twenty-seven years of age, Lady Chiltern embodies the Victorian new woman: upright, virtuous, educated, politically engaged, and active in her husband's career. She is the play's sentimental heroine, a sort of moral absol utist who worships her ideal husband and cannot brook the revelation of his secret past. In terms of Wilde's other plays, Lady Chiltern recalls the puritanical Lady Windermere.
