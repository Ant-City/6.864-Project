[CHARACTER] - 
                the
[CHARACTER]s were teachers-for-hire who educated the wealthy men of
athens in the fifth century b.c. though they
were a diverse group with diverse opinions, they tended to share
a disregard for the notion of objective truth and knowledge. this
disregard extended to the notion of objective moral truth, which
means that they did not believe in such a things as "right" and "wrong."
one of the guiding motivations in all of plato's work was to prove
the [CHARACTER]s wrong: to show that there is such a thing as objective
truth, and that we can have knowledge of this objective truth.
