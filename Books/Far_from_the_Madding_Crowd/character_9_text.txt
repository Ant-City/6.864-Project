 went off with jan coggan, who had offered
him a lodging. a few minutes later, when the remaining
ones were on their legs and about to depart, fray came
back again in a hurry. flourishing his finger ominously
he threw a gaze teeming with tidings just -- where his eye
alighted by accident, which happened to be in joseph
poorgrass's face.
  "o -- what's the matter, what's the matter, henery?"
said joseph, starting back.
  "what's a-brewing, henrey?" asked jacob and mark
clark.
  "baily pennyways -- baily pennyways -- i said so; yes,
i said so!"
  "what, found out stealing anything?"
  "stealing it is. the news is, that after miss
everdene got home she went out again to see all was
safe, as she usually do, and coming in found baily
pennyways creeping down the granary steps with half a
a bushel of barley. she fleed at him  like a cat -- never
such a tomboy as she is -- of course i speak with closed
doors?"
  "you do -- you do, henery."
  "she fleed at him, and, to cut a long s

rried off five sack altogether, upon
her promising not to persecute him. well, he's turned
out neck and crop, and my question is, who's going to
be baily now?"
  the question was such a profound one that henery
was obliged to drink there and then from the large
cup till the bottom was distinctly visible inside. before
he had replaced it on the table, in came the young man,
susan tall's husband, in a still greater hurry.
  "have ye heard the news that's all over parish?"
  "about baily pennyways?"
  "but besides that?"
  "no -- not a morsel of it!" they replied, looking into
the very midst of laban tall as if to meet his words
half-way down his throat.
  "what a night of horrors!" murmured joseph poor-
grass, waving his hands spasmodically. "i've had the
news-bell ringing in my left ear quite bad enough for a
murder, and i've seen a magpie all alone!"

 other carters
and waggoners followed at his heels, with great lanterns
dangling from their hands, which showed that they had
just come from the cart-horse stables, where they had
been busily engaged since four o'clock that morning.
"and how is she getting on without a baily?" the
maltster inquired.
henery shook his head, and smiled one of the bitter
smiles, dragging all the flesh of his forehead into a
corrugated heap in the centre.
"she'll rue it -- surely, surely!" he said " benjy
pennyways were not a true man or an honest baily --
as big a betrayer as judas iscariot himself. but to think
she can carr' on alone!" he allowed his head to swing
laterally three or four times in silence. "never in all my
creeping up -- never!"
this was recognized by all as the conclusion of some
gloomy speech which had been expressed in thought
alone during the shake of the head; henery meanwhile
retained several marks of despair upon his face, to
imply that they would be required for use agai

r his lateness:  his arrival was evidently
by arrangement.
"gabriel." said she, " will you move again, please,
and let mr. boldwood come there?"
oak moved in silence back to his original seat.
the gentleman-farmer was dressed in cheerful style,
in a new coat and white waistcoat, quite contrasting
with his usual sober suits of grey. inwardy, too, he
was blithe, and consequently chatty to an exceptional
degree. so also was bathsheba now that he had come,
though the uninvited presence of pennyways, the bailiff
who had been dismissed for theft, disturbed her equan-
imity for a while.
supper being ended, coggan began on his own
private account, without reference to listeners:  --
l've lost my love and l care not,
i've lost my love, and l care not;
i shall soon have another
that's better than t'other!
i've lost my love, and i care not.
this lyric, when concluded, was received with a
silently appreciative gaze at the table, implying that the
performance, like a work by those esta

g of itself;
and the necessity of being jealous, which lovers are
troubled with, did not lead oak to underestimate these
signs.
bathsheba then wished them good-night, withdrew
from the window, and retired to the back part of the
room, boldwood thereupon closing the sash and the
shutters, and remaining inside with her. oak wandered
away under the quiet and scented trees. recovering
from the softer impressions produced by bathsheba's
voice, the shearers rose to leave, coggan turning to
pennyways as he pushed back the bench to pass out:  --
"i like to give praise where praise is due, and the
man deserves it -- that 'a do so." he remarked, looking at
the worthy thief, as if he were the masterpiece of some
world-renowned artist.
"i'm sure i should never have believed it if we hadn't
proved it, so to allude," hiccupped joseph poorgrass, "that
every cup, every one of the best knives and forks, and
every empty bottle be in their place as perfect now as
at the beginning, and not one

stole at all.
"i'm sure i don't deserve half the praise you give
me." said the virtuous thief, grimly.
"well, i'll say this for pennyways." added coggan,
"that whenever he do really make up his mind to do a
noble thing in the shape of a good action, as i could
see by his face he. did to-night afore sitting down, he's
generally able to carry it out. yes, i'm proud to say.
neighbours, that he's stole nothing at all.
"well." -- 'tis an honest deed, and we thank ye for it,
pennyways." said joseph; to which opinion the remainder
of the company subscribed unanimously.
  at this time of departure, when nothing more was
visible of the inside of the parlour than a thin and still
chink of light between the shutters, a passionate scene
was in course of enactment there."
miss everdene and boldwood were alone. her
cheeks had lost a great deal of their healthful fire from
the very seriousness of her position; but her eye was
bright with the excitement of a triumph -- though

atherbury in the event of his return, based on a
feeling that knowledge of his present occupation would
discredit him still further in his wife's eyes, returned
in full force. moreover, should he resolve not to
return at all, a tale of his being alive and being in
the neighbourhood would be awkward; and he was
anxious to acquire a knowledge of his wife's temporal
affairs before deciding which to do.
in this dilemma troy at once went out to recon-
noitre. it occurred to him that to find pennyways, and
make a friend of him if possible, would be a very wise
act. he had put on a thick beard borrowed from the
establishment, and this he wandered about the fair-
field. it was now almost dark, and respectable people
were getting their carts and gigs ready to go home
the largest refreshment booth in the fair was provided
by an innkeeper from a neighbouring town. this was
considered an unexceptionable place for obtaining the
necessary food and rest: host trencher (as he was

es, and look-
ing as if he had never lived anywhere but under canvas
all his life. in these penetralia were chairs and a table,
which, on candles being lighted, made quite a cozy and
luxurious show, with an urn, plated tea and coffee pots,
china teacups, and plum cakes.
troy stood at the entrance to the booth, where a
gipsy-woman was frying pancakes over a little fire of
sticks and selling them at a penny a-piece, and looked
over the heads of the people within. he could see
nothing of pennyways, but he soon discerned bathsheba
through an opening into the reserved space at the
further end. troy thereupon retreated, went round the
tent into the darkness, and listened. he could hear
bathsheba's voice immediately inside the canvas; she
was conversing with a man. a warmth overspread his
face: surely she was not so unprincipled as to flirt in
a fair! he wondered if, then, she reckoned upon his
death as an absolute certainty. to get at the root of
the matter, troy took a penknife fr

ago, if it had not been for him. i had no idea of
coming in here; but there's nothing so refreshing as a
cup of tea, though i should never have got one if you
hadn't helped me."
troy scrutinized her cheek as lit by the candles,
and watched each varying shade thereon, and the
white shell-like sinuosities of her little ear. she took
out her purse and was insisting to boldwood on paying
for her tea for herself, when at this moment pennyways
entered the tent. troy trembled:  here was his scheme
for respectability endangered at once. he was about
to leave his hole of espial, attempt to follow pennyways,
and find out if the ex-bailiff had recognized him, when
he was arrested by the conversation, and found he was
too late.
"excuse me, ma'am." said pennyways; "i've some
private information for your ear alone."
i cannot hear it now." she said, coldly. that
bathsheba could not endure this man was evident; in
fact, he was conti

nually coming to her with some tale
or other, by which he might creep into favour at the
expense of persons maligned.
"i'll write it down." said pennyways, confidently. he
stooped over the table, pulled a leaf from a warped
pocket-book, and wrote upon the paper, in a round
hand --
"your husband is here. i've seen him. who's the fool
now?"
this he folded small, and handed towards her.
bathsheba would not read it; she would not even put
out her hand to take it. pennyways, then, with a laugh
of derision, tossed it into her lap, and, turning away,
left her.
from the words and action of pennyways, troy,
though he had not been able to see what the ex-bailiff
wrote, had not a moment's doubt that the note referred
to him. nothing that he could think of could be done
to check the exposure. "curse my luck!" he whispered,
and added imprecations which rustled in the gloom like
a pestilent wind. meanwhile boldwood said, taking up
the note from her lap --

 tightly down,
lifted it a little way, keeping his eye to the hole,
snatched the note from her fingers, dropped the canvas,
and ran away in the gloom towards the bank and ditch,
smiling at the scream of astonishment which burst from
her. troy then slid down on the outside of the rampart,
hastened round in the bottom of the entrenchment to
a distance of a hundred yards, ascended again, and
crossed boldly in a slow walk towards the front entrance
of the tent. his object was now to get to pennyways,
and prevent a repetition of the announcement until
such time as he should choose.
troy reached the tent door, and standing among the
groups there gathered, looked anxiously for pennyways,
evidently not wishing to make himself prominent by
inquiring for him. one or two men were speaking of
a daring attempt that had just been made to rob a
young lady by lifting the canvas of the tent beside her.
it was supposed that the rogue had imagined a slip of
paper which she held in her hand to h

e a bank note,
for he had seized it, and made off with it, leaving her
purse behind. his chagrin and disappointment at dis-
covering its worthlessness would be a good joke, it was
said. however, the occurrence seemed to have become
known to few, for it had not interrupted a fiddler, who
had lately begun playing by the door of the tent, nor
the four bowed old men with grim countenances and
walking-sticks in hand, who were dancing "major
malley's reel" to the tune. behind these stood
pennyways. troy glided up to him, beckoned, and
whispered a few words; and with a mutual glance of
concurrence the two men went into the night together.

"deceived? never!" said boldwood, vehemently.
"she never promised me at that first time, and hence
she did not break her promise! if she promises me,
she'll marry me, bathsheba is a woman to her word."

troy was sitting in a corner of the white hart
tavern at casterbridge, smoking and drinking a steaming
mixture from a glass. a knock was given at the door,
and pennyways entered.
"well, have you seen him?" troy inquired, pointing
to a chair.
"boldwood?"
"no -- lawyer long."
"he wadn' at home. i went there first, too."
"that's a nuisance."
"'tis rather, i suppose."

drowned and was not, he should be liable for anything.
i shan't ask any lawyer -- not i."

"ha-ha! well done, pennyways." troy had laughed,
but it was with some anxiety that he said, "now, what
i want to know is this, do you think there's really
anything going on between her and boldwood? upon
my soul, i should never have believed it! how she.
must detest me! have you found out whether she
has encouraged him?"
"i haen't been able to learn. there's a deal of
feeling on his side seemingly, but i don't answer for
her. i didn't know a word about any such thing till
yesterday, and all i heard then was that

she was gwine
to the party at his house to-night. this is the first
time she has ever gone there, they say. and they say
that she've not so much as spoke to him since they were
at greenhill fair: but what can folk believe o't? how-
ever, she's not fond of him -- quite offish and quite care
less, i know."
"i'm not so sure of that.... she's a handsome
woman, pennyways, is she not? own that you never
saw a finer or more splendid creature in your life.
upon my honour, when i set eyes upon her that day
i wondered what i could have been made of to be able
to leave her by herself so long. and then i was
hampered with that bothering show, which i'm free of
at last, thank the stars." he smoked on awhile, and
then added, "how did she look when you passed by
yesterday?"
"oh, she took no great heed of me, ye may well
fancy; but she looked well enough, far's

"i was coming down this moment. those wheels i

"no, sir -- 'tis not she yet."
a reserved and sombre expression had returned to
boldwood's face again, but it poorly cloaked his feel-
ings when he pronounced bathsheba's name; and his
feverish anxiety continued to show its existence by a
galloping motion of his fingers upon the side of his thigh
as he went down the stairs.

"how does this cover me?" said troy to pennyways,
"nobody would recognize me now, i'm sure."
he was buttoning on a heavy grey overcoat of
noachian cut, with cape and high collar, the latter being
erect and rigid, like a girdling wall, and nearly reaching
to the verge of travelling cap which was pulled down
over his ears.
pennyways snuffed the candle, and then looked up
and deliberately inspected troy

said.

and recognized here this very afternoon. i should
have gone back to her the day after the fair, if it hadn't
been for you talking about the law, and rubbish about
getting a separation; and i don't put it off any longer.
what the deuce put it into my head to run away at all,
i can't think! humbugging sentiment -- that's what it
was. but what man on earth was to know that his wife
would be in such a hurry to get rid of his name!"
"i should have known it. she's bad enough for
anything."
"pennyways, mind who you are talking to."
"well, sergeant, all i say is this, that if i were you i'd
go abroad again where i came from -- 'tisn't too late to do
it now. i wouldn't stir up the business and get a bad
name for the sake of living with her -- for all that about
your play-acting is sure to come out, you know, although
you think otherwise. my eyes and limbs, there'll be a
racket if you go back just now -- in the middle of bold-
wood's christmasing!"
"h'm, yes. i expect i shall not be a

laugh. "a sort of alonzo the brave; and when i go in
the guests will sit in silence and fear, and all laughter
and pleasure will be hushed, and the lights in the
chamber burn blue, and the worms -- ugh, horrible! --
ring for some more brandy, pennyways, i felt an
awful shudder just then! well, what is there besides?
a stick-i must have a walking-stick."
pennyways now felt himself to be in something of a
difficulty, for should bathsheba and troy become recon-
ciled it would be necessary to regain her good opinion
if he would secure the patronage of her husband. i
sometimes think she likes you yet, and is a good woman
at bottom." he said, as a saving sentence. "but there's
no telling to a certainty from a body's outside. well,
you'll do as you like about going, of course, sergeant,
and as for me, i'll do as you tell me."
"now, let me see what the
