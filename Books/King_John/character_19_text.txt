ost speechless and broke out
    to acquaint you with this evil, that you might
    the better arm you to the sudden time
    than if you had at leisure known of this.
  bastard. how did he take it; who did taste to him?
  hubert. a monk, i tell you; a resolved villain,
    whose bowels suddenly burst out. the king
    yet speaks, and peradventure may recover.
  bastard. who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
  hubert. why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
    and brought prince henry in their company;
    at whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
    and they are all about his majesty.
  bastard. withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
    and tempt us not to bear above our power!
    i'll tell thee, hubert, half my power this night,
    passing these flats, are taken by the tide-
    these lincoln washes have devoured them;
    myself, well-mounted, hardly have escap'd.
    away, before! conduct me to the king;
    i doubt he will be dead or ere i come.

scene 7.

the orchard at swinstead abbey

enter prince henry, salisbury, and bigot

  prince henry. it is too late; the life of all his blood
    is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain.
    which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
    doth by the idle comments that it makes
    foretell the ending of mortality.

                   enter pembroke

  pembroke. his highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
    that, being brought into the open air,
    it would allay the burning quality
    of that fell poison which assaileth him.
  prince henry. let him be brought in

    doth he still rage?                                    exit
bigot
  pembroke. he is more patient
    than when you left him; even now he sung.
  prince henry. o vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
    in their continuance will not feel themselves.
    death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
    leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
    against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
    with many legions of strange fantasies,
    which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
    confound themselves. 'tis strange that death should sing.
    i am the cygnet to this pale faint swan
    who chants a doleful hymn to his own dea

       re-enter bigot and attendants, who bring in
                king john in a chair

  king john. ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
    it would not out at windows nor at doors.
    there is so hot a summer in my bosom
    that all my bowels crumble up to dust.
    i am a scribbled form drawn with a pen
    upon a parchment, and against this fire
    do i shrink up.
  prince henry. how fares your majesty?
  king john. poison'd-ill-fare! dead, forsook, cast off;
    and none of you will bid the winter come
    to thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
    nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
    through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
    to make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
    and comfort me with cold. i do not ask you much;
    i beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
    and so ingrateful you deny me that.
  prince henry. o that there wer

    and module of confounded royalty.
  bastard. the dauphin is preparing hitherward,
    where god he knows how we shall answer him;
    for in a night the best part of my pow'r,
    as i upon advantage did remove,
    were in the washes all unwarily
    devoured by the unexpected flood.                 [the king

  salisbury. you breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
    my liege! my lord! but now a king-now thus.
  prince henry. even so must i run on, and even so stop.
    what surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
    when this was now a king, and now is clay?
  bastard. art thou gone so? i do but stay behind
    to do the office for thee of revenge,
    and then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
    as it on earth hath been thy servant still.
    now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
    where be your pow'rs? show now your mended faiths,
    and instantly return with me again

ll sinewed to our defence.
  salisbury. nay, 'tis in a manner done already;
    for many carriages he hath dispatch'd
    to the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
    to the disposing of the cardinal;
    with whom yourself, myself, and other lords,
    if you think meet, this afternoon will post
    to consummate this business happily.
  bastard. let it be so. and you, my noble prince,
    with other princes that may best be spar'd,
    shall wait upon your father's funeral.
  prince henry. at worcester must his body be interr'd;
    for so he will'd it.
  bastard. thither shall it, then;
    and happily may your sweet self put on
    the lineal state and glory of the land!
    to whom, with all submission, on my knee
    i do bequeath my faithful services
    and true subjection everlastingly.
  salisbury. and the like tender of our love we make,
    to rest without a spot for evermore.
  prince henry. i have a kind soul that would give you thanks,
