rascally traders, i should have said, â€˜is thy servant a dog, that

perhaps the mildest form of the system of slavery is to be seen in the
state of kentucky. the general prevalence of agricultural pursuits of a
quiet and gradual nature, not requiring those periodic seasons of
hurry and pressure that are called for in the business of more southern
districts, makes the task of the negro a more healthful and reasonable
one; while the master, content with a more gradual style of acquisition,
has not those temptations to hardheartedness which always overcome frail
human nature when the prospect of sudden and rapid gain is weighed in
the balance, with no heavier counterpoi

varieties of hoe-cake, dodgers, muffins, and other species too numerous
to mention, was a sublime mystery to all less practised compounders; and
she would shake her fat sides with honest pride and merriment, as she

had made to attain to her elevation.

the arrival of company at the house, the arranging of dinners and

the little one was shy, for all her busy interest in everything going
on, and it was not easy to tame her. for a while, she would perch like
a canary-bird on some box or package near tom, while busy in the little
arts afore-named, and take from him, with a kind of grave bashfulness,
the little articles he offered. but at last they got on quite
confidential terms.

â€œwhatâ€™s little missyâ€™s name?â€ said tom, at last, when he thought matters
were ripe to push such an inquiry.

â€œevangeline st. clare,â€ said the little one, â€œthough papa and everybody
else call me eva. now, whatâ€™s your name?â€

â€œmy nameâ€™s tom; the little chilâ€™en used to call me uncle tom, way back
thar in kentuck.â€

â€œthen i mean to call you uncle tom, because, you see, i like you,â€ said
eva. â€œso, uncle tom, where are you going?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know, miss eva.â€

â€œdonâ€™t know?â€ said eva.

â€œno, i am going to be sold to somebody. i donâ€™t know who.â€

the boat here stopped at a small landing to take in wood, and eva,
hearing her fatherâ€™s voice, bounded nimbly away. tom rose up, and went
forward to offer his service in wooding, and soon was busy among the
hands.

eva and her father were standing together by the railings to see the
boat start from the landing-place, the wheel had made two or three
revolutions in the water, when, by some sudden movement, the little one
suddenly lost her balance and fell sheer over the side of the boat into
the water. her father, scarce knowing what he did, was plunging in after
her, but was held back by some behind him, who saw that more efficient
aid had followed his child.

tom was standing just under her on the lower deck,

things together, and arranging them, preparatory to going ashore. the
steward and chambermaid, and all, were busily engaged in cleaning,
furbishing, and arranging the splendid boat, preparatory to a grand
entree.

on the lower deck sat our friend tom, with his arms folded, and
anxiously, from time to time, turning his eyes towards a group on the
other side of the boat.

there stood the fair evangeline, a little paler than the day before, but
otherwise exhibiting no traces of the accident which had befallen her.
a graceful, elegantly-formed young man stood by her, carelessly leaning
one elbow on a bale of cotton while a large pocket-book lay open before
him. it was quite evident, at a glance, that the gentleman was evaâ€™s
father. there was the same noble cast of head, the same large blue eyes,
the same golden-brown hair; yet the expression was wholly different. in

if the trader had not been sure, by a certain good-humored twinkle in
the large eye, that all this banter was sure, in the long run, to turn
out a cash concern, he might have been somewhat out of patience; as it
was, he laid down a greasy pocket-book on the cotton-bales, and began
anxiously studying over certain papers in it, the young man standing by,
the while, looking down on him with an air of careless, easy drollery.

â€œpapa, do buy him! itâ€™s no matter what you pay,â€ whispered eva, softly,
getting up on a package, and putting her arm around her fatherâ€™s neck.
â€œyou have money enough, i know. i want him.â€

â€œwhat for, pussy? are you going to use him for a rattle-box, or a
rocking-horse, or what?

â€œi want to make him happy.â€

â€œan original reason, certainly.â€

here the trader handed up a certificate, signed by mr. shelby, which
the young man took with the tips of his long fingers, and glanced over
carelessly.

moments, he handed to the young man.

â€œi wonder, now, if i was divided up and inventoried,â€ said the latter
as he ran over the paper, â€œhow much i might bring. say so much for the
shape of my head, so much for a high forehead, so much for arms, and
hands, and legs, and then so much for education, learning, talent,
honesty, religion! bless me! there would be small charge on that last,
iâ€™m thinking. but come, eva,â€ he said; and taking the hand of his
daughter, he stepped across the boat, and carelessly putting the tip of
his finger under tomâ€™s chin, said, good-humoredly, â€œlook-up, tom, and
see how you like your new master.â€

tom looked up. it was not in nature to look into that gay, young,
handsome face, without a feeling of pleasure; and tom felt the tears
start in his eyes as he said, heartily, â€œgod bless you, masâ€™r!â€

â€œwell, i hope he will. whatâ€™s your name? tom? quite as likely to

special accommodation to all concerned, if you donâ€™t. never mind, my

â€œi sartin do, masâ€™r,â€ said tom.

â€œand you shall have good times,â€ said eva. â€œpapa is very good to

â€œpapa is much obliged to you for his recommendation,â€ said st. clare,
laughing, as he turned on his heel and walked away.

of tomâ€™s new master, and various other matters


since the thread of our humble heroâ€™s life has now become interwoven
with that of higher ones, it is necessary to give some brief
introduction to them.

entions which flowed at first through the habitude of courtship, he
found his sultana no way ready to resign her slave; there were abundance
of tears, poutings, and small tempests, there were discontents, pinings,
upbraidings. st. clare was good-natured and self-indulgent, and sought
to buy off with presents and flatteries; and when marie became mother to
a beautiful daughter, he really felt awakened, for a time, to something
like tenderness.

st. clareâ€™s mother had been a woman of uncommon elevation and purity of
character, and he gave to his child his motherâ€™s name, fondly fancying
that she would prove a reproduction of her image. the thing had been
remarked with petulant jealousy by his wife, and she regarded her
husbandâ€™s absorbing devotion to the child with suspicion and dislike;
all that was given to her seemed so much taken from herself. from the
time of the birth of this child, her health gradually sunk. a life of
constant inaction, bodily and mental,--the friction of ceasel

 the truth, then, miss ophelia loved him. when a boy, it had been
hers to teach him his catechism, mend his clothes, comb his hair, and
bring him up generally in the way he should go; and her heart having
a warm side to it, augustine had, as he usually did with most people,
monopolized a large share of it for himself, and therefore it was that
he succeeded very easily in persuading her that the â€œpath of dutyâ€ lay
in the direction of new orleans, and that she must go with him to take
care of eva, and keep everything from going to wreck and ruin during the
frequent illnesses of his wife. the idea of a house without anybody
to take care of it went to her heart; then she loved the lovely little
girl, as few could help doing; and though she regarded augustine as very
much of a heathen, yet she loved him, laughed at his jokes, and forbore
with his failings, to an extent which those who knew him thought
perfectly incredible. but what more or other is to be known of miss

there she is, sitting now in her state-room, surrounded by a mixed
multitude of little and big carpet-bags, boxes, baskets, each containing
some separate responsibility which she is tying, binding up, packing, or
fastening, with a face of great earnestness.

â€œnow, eva, have you kept count of your things? of course you
havenâ€™t,--children never do: thereâ€™s the spotted carpet-bag and the
little blue band-box with your best bonnet,--thatâ€™s two; then the india
rubber satchel is three; and my tape and needle box is four; and my
band-box, five; and my collar-box; and that little hair trunk, seven.

paper round it, and tie it to my umbrella with my shade;--there, now.â€

â€œto keep it nice, child; people must take care of their things, if they
ever mean to have anything; and now, eva, is your thimble put up?â€

â€œreally, aunty, i donâ€™t know.â€

â€œwell, never mind; iâ€™ll look your box over,--thimble, wax, two spools,
scissors, knife, tape-needle; all right,--put it in here. what did you
ever do, child, when you were coming on with only your papa. i should
have thought youâ€™d a lost everything you had.â€

â€œwell, aunty, i did lose a great many; and then, when we stopped
anywhere, papa would buy some more of whatever it was.â€

â€œmercy on us, child,--what a way!â€
 
 ___________________________
 


â€œit was a very easy way, aunty,â€ said eva.

â€œitâ€™s a dreadful shiftless one,â€ said aunty.

â€œwhy, aunty, whatâ€™ll you do now?â€ said eva; â€œthat trunk is too full to
be shut down.â€

â€œit _must_ shut down,â€ said aunty, with the air of a general, as she
squeezed the things in, and sprung upon the lid;--still a little gap
remained about the mouth of the trunk.

â€œget up here, eva!â€ said miss ophelia, courageously; â€œwhat has been done
can be done again. this trunk has _got to be_ shut and locked--there are
no two ways about it.â€

and the trunk, intimidated, doubtless, by this resolute statement, gave
in. the hasp snapped sharply in its hole, and miss ophelia turned the
key, and pocketed it in triumph.

â€œnow weâ€™re ready. whereâ€™s your papa? i think it time this baggage was
set out. do look out, eva, and see if you see your papa.â€

â€œo, yes, heâ€™s down the o

ther end of the gentlemenâ€™s cabin, eating an

â€œhe canâ€™t know how near we are coming,â€ said aunty; â€œhadnâ€™t you better
run and speak to him?â€

â€œpapa never is in a hurry about anything,â€ said eva, â€œand we havenâ€™t
come to the landing. do step on the guards, aunty. look! thereâ€™s our
house, up that street!â€

the boat now began, with heavy groans, like some vast, tired monster,
to prepare to push up among the multiplied steamers at the levee. eva
joyously pointed out the various spires, domes, and way-marks, by which
she recognized her native city.

â€œyes, yes, dear; very fine,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œbut mercy on us! the
boat has stopped! where is your father?â€

and now ensued the usual turmoil of landing--waiters running twenty ways
at once--men tugging trunks, carpet-bags, boxes--women anxiously calling
to their children, and everybody crowding in a dense mass to the plank
towards the landing.

 rained down upon her unheeded. she sat with grim determination, upright
as a darning-needle stuck in a board, holding on her bundle of umbrella
and parasols, and replying with a determination that was enough to
strike dismay even into a hackman, wondering to eva, in each interval,
â€œwhat upon earth her papa could be thinking of; he couldnâ€™t have fallen
over, now,--but something must have happened;â€--and just as she had
begun to work herself into a real distress, he came up, with his usually
careless motion, and giving eva a quarter of the orange he was eating,
said,

â€œwell, cousin vermont, i suppose you are all ready.â€

â€œiâ€™ve been ready, waiting, nearly an hour,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi began
to be really concerned about you.

â€œthatâ€™

ear miss vermont, positively you mustnâ€™t come the green mountains
over us that way. you must adopt at least a piece of a southern
principle, and not walk out under all that load. theyâ€™ll take you for a
waiting-maid; give them to this fellow; heâ€™ll put them down as if they
were eggs, now.â€

miss ophelia looked despairingly as her cousin took all her treasures
from her, and rejoiced to find herself once more in the carriage with
them, in a state of preservation.

â€œwhereâ€™s tom?â€ said eva.

â€œo, heâ€™s on the outside, pussy. iâ€™m going to take tom up to mother for
a peace-offering, to make up for that drunken fellow that upset the
carriage.â€

â€œo, tom will make a splendid driver, i know,â€ said eva; â€œheâ€™ll never get
drunk.â€

the carriage stopped in front of an ancient mansion, built in that odd
mixture of spanish and french style, of which there are specimens in
some parts of new orleans. it was built in the moorish fashion,--a
square building enclosing a court-yard,

old enchanter, sitting in weird grandeur among the more perishable bloom

the galleries that surrounded the court were festooned with a curtain
of some kind of moorish stuff, and could be drawn down at pleasure, to
exclude the beams of the sun. on the whole, the appearance of the place
was luxurious and romantic.

as the carriage drove in, eva seemed like a bird ready to burst from a
cage, with the wild eagerness of her delight.

â€œo, isnâ€™t it beautiful, lovely! my own dear, darling home!â€ she said to
miss ophelia. â€œisnâ€™t it beautiful?â€

â€œâ€˜t is a pretty place,â€ said miss ophelia, as she alighted; â€œthough it
looks rather old and heathenish to me.â€

tom got down from the carriage, and looked about with an air of calm,
still enjoyment. the negro, it must be remembered, is an exotic of the

â€œhow are you, boy?â€ while adolph poured forth, with great fluency, an
extemporary speech, which he had been preparing, with great care, for a
fortnight before.

negligent drollery, â€œthatâ€™s very well got up, adolph. see that the
baggage is well bestowed. iâ€™ll come to the people in a minute;â€ and,
so saying, he led miss ophelia to a large parlor that opened on the
verandah.

while this had been passing, eva had flown like a bird, through the
porch and parlor, to a little boudoir opening likewise on the verandah.

a tall, dark-eyed, sallow woman, half rose from a couch on which she was
reclining.

â€œmamma!â€ said eva, in a sort of a rapture, throwing herself on her neck,
and embracing her over and over again.

â€œthatâ€™ll do,--take care, child,--donâ€™t, you make my head ache,â€ said the
mother, after she had languidly kissed her.

st. clare came in, embraced his wife in true, orthodox, husband

fashion, and then presented to her his cousin. marie lifted her large
eyes on her cousin with an air of some curiosity, and received her with
languid politeness. a crowd of servants now pressed to the entry
door, and among them a middle-aged mulatto woman, of very respectable
appearance, stood foremost, in a tremor of expectation and joy, at the
door.

â€œo, thereâ€™s mammy!â€ said eva, as she flew across the room; and, throwing
herself into her arms, she kissed her repeatedly.

this woman did not tell her that she made her head ache, but, on the
contrary, she hugged her, and laughed, and cried, till her sanity was a
thing to be doubted of; and when released from her, eva flew from one
to another, shaking hands and kissing, in a way that miss ophelia
afterwards declared fairly turned her stomach.

â€œwell!â€ said miss ophelia, â€œyou southern children can do something that

shaking hands from one to another. â€œlook out

who was crawling upon all fours. â€œif i step upon anybody, let â€˜em

there was an abundance of laughing and blessing masâ€™r, as st. clare
distributed small pieces of change among them.

â€œcome, now, take yourselves off, like good boys and girls,â€ he said; and
the whole assemblage, dark and light, disappeared through a door into a
large verandah, followed by eva, who carried a large satchel, which she
had been filling with apples, nuts, candy, ribbons, laces, and toys of
every description, during her whole homeward journey.

as st. clare turned to go back his eye fell upon tom, who was standing
uneasily, shifting from one foot to the other, while adolph stood
negligently leaning against the banisters, examining tom through an
opera-glass, with an air that would have done credit to any dandy
living.

â€œpuh! you puppy,â€ said his master, striking down

â€œsuch a short, cold letter!â€ said the lady.

â€œdear me! the mail was just going, and it had to be that or nothing.â€

â€œthatâ€™s just the way, always,â€ said the lady; â€œalways something to make
your journeys long, and letters short.â€

â€œsee here, now,â€ he added, drawing an elegant velvet case out of his
pocket, and opening it, â€œhereâ€™s a present i got for you in new york.â€

it was a daguerreotype, clear and soft as an engraving, representing eva
and her father sitting hand in hand.

marie looked at it with a dissatisfied air.

â€œwhat made you sit in such an awkward position?â€ she said.

â€œwell, the position may be a matter of opinion; but what do you think of
the likeness?â€

â€œif you donâ€™t think anything of my opinion in one case, i suppose you
wouldnâ€™t in another,â€ said the lady, shutting the daguerreotype.

â€œhang the woman!â€ said st. clare, mentally; but aloud he added, â€œcome,

pulling the bell as he did so; â€œmeanwhile, cousin, you must be wanting

journey. dolph,â€ he added, â€œtell mammy to come here.â€ the decent mulatto
woman whom eva had caressed so rapturously soon entered; she was dressed
neatly, with a high red and yellow turban on her head, the recent gift
of eva, and which the child had been arranging on her head. â€œmammy,â€
 said st. clare, â€œi put this lady under your care; she is tired,
and wants rest; take her to her chamber, and be sure she is made
comfortable,â€ and miss ophelia disappeared in the rear of mammy.

â€œiâ€™m sure sheâ€™s welcome,â€ said marie, leaning her head languidly on her
hand. â€œi think sheâ€™ll find one thing, if she does, and that is, that
itâ€™s we mistresses that are the slaves, down here.â€

â€œo, certainly, she will discover that, and a world of wholesome truths
besides, no doubt,â€ said st. clare.

â€œtalk about our keeping slaves, as if we did it for our _convenience_,â€
 said marie. â€œiâ€™m sure, if we consulted _that_, we might let them all go
at once.â€

evangeline fixed her large, serious eyes on her motherâ€™s face, with an
earnest and perplexed expression, and said, simply, â€œwhat do you keep
them for, mamma?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know, iâ€™m sure, except for a plague; they are the plague of my
life. i believe that more of my ill health is caused by them than by any
one thing; and ours, i know, are the very worst that ever anybody was
plagued with.â€

â€œselfishness _is_ a dreadful fault,â€ said st. clare, gravely.

â€œwell, now, thereâ€™s mammy,â€ said marie, â€œi think itâ€™s selfish of her to
sleep so sound nights; she knows i need little attentions almost every
hour, when my worst turns are on, and yet sheâ€™s so hard to wake. i

â€œhasnâ€™t she sat up with you a good many nights, lately, mamma?â€ said
eva.

â€œhow should you know that?â€ said marie, sharply; â€œsheâ€™s been
complaining, i suppose.â€

â€œshe didnâ€™t complain; she only told me what bad nights youâ€™d had,--so
many in succession.â€

inconsiderate. so nervous as i am, the least breath disturbs me; and a

pped more than once or twice in her whole life. she has her strong
coffee or her tea every day, with white sugar in it. itâ€™s abominable, to
be sure; but st. clare will have high life below-stairs, and they every
one of them live just as they please. the fact is, our servants are
over-indulged. i suppose it is partly our fault that they are selfish,
and act like spoiled children; but iâ€™ve talked to st. clare till i am
tired.â€

â€œand i, too,â€ said st. clare, taking up the morning paper.

eva, the beautiful eva, had stood listening to her mother, with that
expression of deep and mystic earnestness which was peculiar to her. she
walked softly round to her motherâ€™s chair, and put her arms round her
neck.

â€œwell, eva, what now?â€ said marie.

â€œmamma, couldnâ€™t i take care of you one night--just one? i know i
shouldnâ€™t make you nervous, and i shouldnâ€™t sleep. i often lie awake
nights, thinking--â€

â€œo, nonsense, child--nonsense!â€ said marie; â€œyou are such a strange

isguised amazement at this
peroration, which struck st. clare as so supremely ludicrous, that he
burst into a loud laugh.

â€œst. clare always laughs when i make the least allusion to my ill
health,â€ said marie, with the voice of a suffering martyr. â€œi only
hope the day wonâ€™t come when heâ€™ll remember it!â€ and marie put her
handkerchief to her eyes.

of course, there was rather a foolish silence. finally, st. clare got
up, looked at his watch, and said he had an engagement down street. eva
tripped away after him, and miss ophelia and marie remained at the table
alone.

â€œnow, thatâ€™s just like st. clare!â€ said the latter, withdrawing her
handkerchief with somewhat of a spirited flourish when the criminal to
be affected by it was no longer in sight. â€œhe never realizes, never
can, never will, what i suffer, and have, for years. if i was one of the
complaining sort, or ever made any fuss about my ailments, there would
be some reason for it. men do get tired, naturally, of a co

g cupboards, closets, linen-presses,
store-rooms, and other matters, of which the latter was, by common
understanding, to assume the direction,--giving her so many cautious
directions and charges, that a head less systematic and business-like
than miss opheliaâ€™s would have been utterly dizzied and confounded.

â€œand now,â€ said marie, â€œi believe iâ€™ve told you everything; so that,
when my next sick turn comes on, youâ€™ll be able to go forward entirely,
without consulting me;--only about eva,--she requires watching.â€

â€œshe seems to be a good child, very,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi never saw a
better child.â€

â€œevaâ€™s peculiar,â€ said her mother, â€œvery. there are things about her so
singular; she isnâ€™t like me, now, a particle;â€ and marie sighed, as if
this was a truly melancholy consideration.

miss ophelia in her own heart said, â€œi hope she isnâ€™t,â€ but had prudence
enough to keep it down.

â€œeva always was disposed to be with servants; and i think that well

nough with some children. now, i always played with fatherâ€™s little
negroes--it never did me any harm. but eva somehow always seems to put
herself on an equality with every creature that comes near her. itâ€™s a
strange thing about the child. i never have been able to break her of
it. st. clare, i believe, encourages her in it. the fact is, st. clare
indulges every creature under this roof but his own wife.â€

again miss ophelia sat in blank silence.

â€œnow, thereâ€™s no way with servants,â€ said marie, â€œbut to _put them
down_, and keep them down. it was always natural to me, from a child.
eva is e

_kind_ to servants--i always am; but you must make â€˜em _know their
place_. eva never does; thereâ€™s no getting into the childâ€™s head the
first beginning of an idea what a servantâ€™s place is! you heard her
offering to take care of me nights, to let mammy sleep! thatâ€™s just a
specimen of the way the child would be doing all the time, if she was
left to herself.â€

â€œwhy,â€ said miss ophelia, bluntly, â€œi suppose you think your servants
are human creatures, and ought to have some rest when they are tired.â€

â€œcertainly, of course. iâ€™m very particular in letti

but as to putting them on any sort of equality with us, you know, as if
we could be compared, why, itâ€™s impossible! now, st. clare really has
talked to me as if keeping mammy from her husband was like keeping me
from mine. thereâ€™s no comparing in this way. mammy couldnâ€™t have the
feelings that i should. itâ€™s a different thing altogether,--of course,
it is,--and yet st. clare pretends not to see it. and just as if mammy
could love her little dirty babies as i love eva! yet st. clare once
really and soberly tried to persuade me that it was my duty, with my
weak health, and all i suffer, to let mammy go back, and take somebody
else in her place. that was a little too much even for _me_ to bear. i
donâ€™t often show my feelings, i make it a principle to endure everything
in silence; itâ€™s a wifeâ€™s hard lot, and i bear it. but i did break out,
that time; so that he has never alluded to the subject since. but i know

. clare.

â€œitâ€™s provoking to be talked to in that way.â€

â€œthen, how will you be talked to? iâ€™ll talk to order,--any way youâ€™ll
mention,--only to give satisfaction.â€

a gay laugh from the court rang through the silken curtains of the
verandah. st. clare stepped out, and lifting up the curtain, laughed
too.

â€œwhat is it?â€ said miss ophelia, coming to the railing.

there sat tom, on a little mossy seat in the court, every one of his
button-holes stuck full of cape jessamines, and eva, gayly laughing, was
hanging a wreath of roses round his neck; and then she sat down on his
knee, like a chip-sparrow, still laughing.

â€œo, tom, you look so funny!â€

tom had a sober, benevolent smile, and seemed, in his quiet way, to be
enjoying the fun quite as much as his little mistress. he lifted his
eyes, when he saw his master, with a half-deprecating, apologetic air.

â€œhow can you let her?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œwhy not?â€ said st. clare.

â€œwhy, i donâ€™t know, it seems so dr

â€œwell, cousin,â€ said miss ophelia, thoughtfully, â€œthere may be some
truth in this.â€

â€œwhat would the poor and lowly do, without children?â€ said st. clare,
leaning on the railing, and watching eva, as she tripped off, leading
tom with her. â€œyour little child is your only true democrat. tom, now
is a hero to eva; his stories are wonders in her eyes, his songs and
methodist hymns are better than an opera, and the traps and little bits

division of labor. my forte lies in talking, and yours, cousin, lies in

in tomâ€™s external situation, at this time, there was, as the world
says, nothing to complain of little evaâ€™s fancy for him--the instinctive
gratitude and loveliness of a noble nature--had led her to petition her
father that he might be her especial attendant, whenever she needed the
escort of a servant, in her walks or rides; and tom had general orders
to let everything else go, and attend to miss eva whenever she wanted
him,--orders which our readers may fancy were far from disagreeable to
him. he was kept well dressed, for st. clare was fastidiously particular

it was not that she had not as handsome a silk dress and shawl, and
as fine a pocket-handkerchief; but stiffness and squareness, and
bolt-uprightness, enveloped her with as indefinite yet appreciable
a presence as did grace her elegant neighbor; not the grace of god,
however,--that is quite another thing!

â€œwhereâ€™s eva?â€ said marie.

â€œthe child stopped on the stairs, to say something to mammy.â€

and what was eva saying to mammy on the stairs? listen, reader, and you
will hear, though marie does not.

â€œdear mammy, i know your head is aching dreadfully.â€

â€œlord bless you, miss eva! my head allers aches lately. you donâ€™t need
to worry.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™m glad youâ€™re going out; and here,â€--and the little girl threw
her arms around her,--â€œmammy, you shall take my vinaigrette.â€

now.â€

â€œdo hear the darlin talk!â€ said mammy, as eva thrust it into her bosom,
and kissing her, ran down stairs to her mother.

â€œwhat were you stopping for?â€

â€œi was just stopping to give mammy my vinaigrette, to take to church
with her.â€

â€œevaâ€ said marie, stamping impatiently,--â€œyour gold vinaigrette to
_mammy!_ when will you learn whatâ€™s _proper_? go right and take it back
this moment!â€

eva looked downcast and aggrieved, and turned slowly.

â€œi say, marie, let the child alone; she shall do as she pleases,â€ said
st. clare.

â€œo, papa, donâ€™t,â€ said eva, softly touching his elbow; â€œit troubles

â€œwell, cousin, are you ready to go to meeting?â€ said miss ophelia,
turning square about on st. clare.

â€œiâ€™m not going, thank you.â€

â€œi do wish st. clare ever would go to church,â€ said marie; â€œbut he
hasnâ€™t a particle of religion about him. it really isnâ€™t respectable.â€

â€œthank you, papa; but iâ€™d rather go to church.â€

â€œisnâ€™t it dreadful tiresome?â€ said st. clare.

â€œi think it is tiresome, some,â€ said eva, â€œand i am sleepy, too, but i
try to keep awake.â€

â€œwhat do you go for, then?â€

â€œwhy, you know, papa,â€ she said, in a whisper, â€œcousin told me that god

â€œyou sweet, little obliging soul!â€ said st. clare, kissing her; â€œgo
along, thatâ€™s a good girl, and pray for me.â€

â€œcertainly, i always do,â€ said the child, as she sprang after her mother
into the carriage.

st. clare stood on the steps and kissed his hand to her, as the carriage
drove away; large tears were in his eyes.

â€œo, evangeline! rightly named,â€ he said; â€œhath not god made thee an
evangel to me?â€

so he felt a moment; and then he smoked a cigar, and read the picayune,
and forgot his little gospel. was he much unlike other folks?

â€œyou see, evangeline,â€ said her mother, â€œitâ€™s always right and proper
to be kind to servants, but it isnâ€™t proper to treat them _just_ as we
would our relations, or people in our own class of life. now, if mammy
was sick, you wouldnâ€™t want to put her in your own bed.â€

â€œi should feel just like it, mamma,â€ said eva, â€œbecause the

be handier to take care of her, and because, you know, my bed is better
than hers.â€

marie was in utter despair at the entire want of moral perception
evinced in this reply.

â€œwhat can i do to make this child understand me?â€ she said.

â€œnothing,â€ said miss ophelia, significantly.

eva looked sorry and disconcerted for a moment; but children, luckily,
do not keep to one impression long, and in a few moments she was merrily
laughing at various things which she saw from the coach-windows, as it
rattled along.

dinner-table, â€œand what was the bill of fare at church today?â€

a sermon as you ought to hear; it expressed

church, all at once, and how immediately it would be discovered that

â€œwell, at any rate,â€ said marie, as she reclined herself on a lounge,
â€œiâ€™m thankful iâ€™m born where slavery exists; and i believe itâ€™s
right,--indeed, i feel it must be; and, at any rate, iâ€™m sure i couldnâ€™t
get along without it.â€

â€œi say, what do you think, pussy?â€ said her father to eva, who came in
at this moment, with a flower in her hand.

â€œwhat about, papa?â€

â€œwhy, which do you like the best,--to live as they do at your uncleâ€™s,
up in vermont, or to have a house-full of servants, as we do?â€

â€œo, of course, our way is the pleasantest,â€ said eva.

â€œwhy so?â€ said st. clare, stroking her head.

â€œwhy, it makes so many more round you to love, you know,â€ said eva,
looking up earnestly.

little eva been, all dinner-time?â€

â€œo, iâ€™ve been up in tomâ€™s room, hearing him sing, and aunt dinah gave me
my dinner.â€

â€œhearing tom sing, hey?â€

â€œo, yes! he sings such beautiful things about the new jerusalem, and
bright angels, and the land of canaan.â€

â€œi dare say; itâ€™s better than the opera, isnâ€™t it?â€

â€œyes, and heâ€™s going to teach them to me.â€

improvement in me, and seemed very earnest that i should be converted.â€

there was a gentle bustle at the quaker house, as the afternoon drew to

household stores such needments as could be arranged in the smallest

thoughtfully on the horizon, and his beams shone yellow and calm into

with delight.

miss opheliaâ€™s experiences and opinions continued


â€œtom, you neednâ€™t get me the horses. i donâ€™t want to go,â€ she said.

â€œwhy not, miss eva?â€

â€œthese things sink into my heart, tom,â€ said eva,--â€œthey sink into my
heart,â€ she repeated, earnestly. â€œi donâ€™t want to go;â€ and she turned
from tom, and went into the house.

a few days after, another woman came, in old prueâ€™s place, to bring the
rusks; miss ophelia was in the kitchen.

â€œlor!â€ said dinah, â€œwhatâ€™s got prue?â€

â€œprue isnâ€™t coming any more,â€ said the woman, mysteriously.

â€œwhy not?â€ said dinah, â€œshe anâ€™t dead, is she?â€

â€œwe doesnâ€™t exactly know. sheâ€™s down cellar,â€ said the woman, gl

helia had taken the rusks, dinah followed the woman to the
door.

â€œwhat _has_ got prue, any how?â€ she said.

the woman seemed desirous, yet reluctant, to speak, and answered, in
low, mysterious tone.

â€œwell, you mustnâ€™t tell nobody, prue, she got drunk agin,--and they
had her down cellar,--and thar they left her all day,--and i hearn â€˜em
saying that the _flies had got to her_,--and _sheâ€™s dead_!â€

dinah held up her hands, and, turning, saw close by her side the
spirit-like form of evangeline, her large, mystic eyes dilated with
horror, and every drop of blood driven from her lips and cheeks.

â€œlor bless us! miss evaâ€™s gwine to faint away! what go us all, to let
her har such talk? her paâ€™ll be rail mad.â€

â€œi shanâ€™t faint, dinah,â€ said the child, firmly; â€œand why shouldnâ€™t i

it.â€

â€œ_lor sakes_! it isnâ€™t for sweet, delicate young ladies, like

eva sighed again, and walked up stairs with a slow and melancholy step.

miss ophelia anxiously inquired the womanâ€™s story. dinah gave a very
garrulous version of it, to which tom added the particulars which he had
drawn from her that morning.

â€œan abominable business,--perfectly horrible!â€ she exclaimed, as she
entered the room where st. clare lay reading his paper.

the capitalist and aristocrat of england cannot feel that as we do,
because they do not mingle with the class they degrade as we do. they
are in our homes; they are the associates of our children, and they form

will cling to and assimilate with. if eva, now, was not more angel than

â€œi think thatâ€™s a barbarous thing,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œbut i donâ€™t

â€œwell, now,â€ said marie, â€œi know itâ€™s impossible to get along with some
of these creatures. they are so bad they ought not to live. i donâ€™t feel
a particle of sympathy for such cases. if theyâ€™d only behave themselves,
it would not happen.â€

â€œbut, mamma,â€ said eva, â€œthe poor creature was unhappy; thatâ€™s what made
her drink.â€

â€œo, fiddlestick! as if that were any excuse! iâ€™m unhappy, very often. i
presume,â€ she said, pensively, â€œthat iâ€™ve had greater trials than ever
she had. itâ€™s just because they are so bad. thereâ€™s some of them that
you cannot break in by any kind of severity. i remember father had a

everybody else fled, scipio worked for me like a giant, and actually
brought me back into life again. but, poor fellow! he was taken, right
after, and there was no saving him. i never felt anybodyâ€™s loss more.â€

eva had come gradually nearer and nearer to her father, as he told the
story,--her small lips apart, her eyes wide and earnest with absorbing
interest.

as he finished, she suddenly threw her arms around his neck, burst into
tears, and sobbed convulsively.

â€œeva, dear child! what is the matter?â€ said st. clare, as the childâ€™s
small frame trembled and shook with the violence of her feelings. â€œthis
child,â€ he added, â€œought not to hear any of this kind of thing,--sheâ€™s

â€œi canâ€™t tell you, papa, i think a great many thoughts. perhaps some day
i shall tell you.â€

â€œwell, think away, dear,--only donâ€™t cry and worry your papa,â€ said st.

eva took it and smiled, though there was still a nervous twiching about
the corners of her mouth.

â€œcome, look at the gold-fish,â€ said st. clare, taking her hand and
stepping on to the verandah. a few moments, and merry laughs were heard
through the silken curtains, as eva and st. clare were pelting each
other with roses, and chasing each other among the alleys of the court.

of his affairs. it was a decent room, containing a bed, a chair, and a
small, rough stand, where lay tomâ€™s bible and hymn-book; and where he
sits, at present, with his slate before him, intent on something that
seems to cost him a great deal of anxious thought.

the fact was, that tomâ€™s home-yearnings had become so strong that he had
begged a sheet of writing-paper of eva, and, mustering up all his small
stock of literary attainment acquired by masâ€™r georgeâ€™s instructions, he
conceived the bold idea of writing a letter; and he was busy now, on his
slate, getting out his first draft. tom was in a good deal of trouble,
for the forms of some of the letters he had forgotten entirely; and of
what he did remember, he did not know exactly which to use. and while he
was working, and breathing very hard, in his earnestness, eva alighted,
like a bird, on the round of

his chair behind him, and peeped over his
shoulder.

â€œo, uncle tom! what funny things you _are_ making, there!â€

â€œiâ€™m trying to write to my poor old woman, miss eva, and my little
chilâ€™en,â€ said tom, drawing the back of his hand over his eyes; â€œbut,
some how, iâ€™m feard i shanâ€™t make it out.â€

â€œi wish i could help you, tom! iâ€™ve learnt to write some. last year i
could make all the letters, but iâ€™m afraid iâ€™ve forgotten.â€

so eva put her golden head close to his, and the two commenced a grave
and anxious discussion, each one equally earnest, and about equally
ignorant; and, with a deal of consulting and advising over every word,
the composition began, as they both felt very sanguine, to look quite
like writing.

â€œyes, uncle tom, it really begins to look beautiful,â€ said eva, gazing
delightedly on it. â€œhow pleased your wifeâ€™ll be, and the poor little
children! o, itâ€™s a shame you ever had to go away from them!

â€œmissis said that she would send down money for me, as soon as they
could get it together,â€ said tom. â€œiâ€™m â€˜spectin, she will. young masâ€™r
george, he said heâ€™d come for me; and he gave me this yer dollar as a
sign;â€ and tom drew from under his clothes the precious dollar.

â€œo, heâ€™ll certainly come, then!â€ said eva. â€œiâ€™m so glad!â€

â€œand i wanted to send a letter, you know, to let â€˜em know whar i was,
and tell poor chloe that i was well off,--cause she felt so drefful,
poor soul!â€

â€œi say tom!â€ said st. clareâ€™s voice, coming in the door at this moment.

tom and eva both started.

â€œwhatâ€™s here?â€ said st. clare, coming up and looking at the slate.

â€œo, itâ€™s tomâ€™s letter. iâ€™m helping him to write it,â€ said eva; â€œisnâ€™t it
nice?â€

â€œi wouldnâ€™t discourage either of you,

â€ said st. clare, â€œbut i rather
think, tom, youâ€™d better get me to write your letter for you. iâ€™ll do
it, when i come home from my ride.â€

â€œitâ€™s very important he should write,â€ said eva, â€œbecause his mistress
is going to send down money to redeem him, you know, papa; he told me
they told him so.â€

st. clare thought, in his heart, that this was probably only one
of those things which good-natured owners say to their servants,
to alleviate their horror of being sold, without any intention of
fulfilling the expectation thus excited. but he did not make any audible
comment upon it,--only ordered tom to get the horses out for a ride.

tomâ€™s letter was written in due form for

â€œwere they good to you?â€

miss ophelia rose from this encouraging colloquy; st. clare was leaning
over the back of her chair.

â€œyou find virgin soil there, cousin; put in your own ideas,--you wonâ€™t
find many to pull up.â€

miss opheliaâ€™s ideas of education, like all her other ideas, were
very set and definite; and of the kind that prevailed in new england
a century ago, and which are still preserved in some very retired and
unsophisticated parts, where there are no railroads. as nearly as could
be expressed, they could be comprised in very few words: to teach them
to mind when they were spoken to; to teach them the catechism, sewing,
and reading; and to whip them if they told lies. and though, of course,
in the flood of light that is now poured on education, these are left
far away in the rear, yet it is an undisputed fact tha

ssed to the gloves, but still persisted in denying the
ribbon.

â€œnow, topsy,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œif youâ€™ll confess all about it, i
wonâ€™t whip you this time.â€ thus adjured, topsy confessed to the ribbon
and gloves, with woful protestations of penitence.

â€œwell, now, tell me. i know you must have taken other things since you
have been in the house, for i let you run about all day yesterday. now,
tell me if you took anything, and i shanâ€™t whip you.â€

â€œlaws, missis! i took miss evaâ€™s red thing she wars on her neck.â€

â€œyou did, you naughty child!--well, what else?â€

â€œi took rosaâ€™s yer-rings,--them red ones.â€

â€œgo bring them to me this minute, both of â€˜em.â€

â€œlaws, missis! i canâ€™t,--they â€˜s burnt up!â€

â€œburnt up!--what a story! go get â€˜em, or iâ€™ll whip you.â€

topsy, with loud protestations, and tears, and groans, declared that she
_could_ not. â€œthey â€˜s burnt up,--they was.â€

â€œwhat did you burn â€˜em for?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œ

just at this moment, eva came innocently into the room, with the
identical coral necklace on her neck.

â€œwhy, eva, where did you get your necklace?â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œget it? why, iâ€™ve had it on all day,â€ said eva.

â€œdid you have it on yesterday?â€

â€œyes; and what is funny, aunty, i had it on all night. i forgot to take
it off when i went to bed.â€

miss ophelia looked perfectly bewildered; the more so, as rosa, at that
instant, came into the room, with a basket of newly-ironed linen poised
on her head, and the coral ear-drops shaking in her ears!

â€œiâ€™m sure i canâ€™t tell anything what to do with such a child!â€ she said,
in despair. â€œwhat in the world did you tell me you took those things

â€œbut, of course, i didnâ€™t want you to confess things you didnâ€™t do,â€
 said miss ophelia; â€œthatâ€™s telling a lie, just as much as the other.â€

â€œlaws, now, is it?â€ said topsy, with an air of innocent wonder.

â€œla, there anâ€™t any such thing as truth in that limb,â€ said rosa,
looking indignantly at topsy. â€œif i was masâ€™r st. clare, iâ€™d whip her
till the blood run. i would,--iâ€™d let her catch it!â€

â€œno, no rosa,â€ said eva, with an air of command, which the child could
assume at times; â€œyou mustnâ€™t talk so, rosa. i canâ€™t bear to hear it.â€

â€œla sakes! miss eva, you â€˜s so good, you donâ€™t know nothing how to get
along with niggers. thereâ€™s no way but to cut â€˜em well up, i tell ye.â€

â€œrosa!â€ said eva, â€œhush! donâ€™t you say another word of that sort!â€ and
the eye of the child flashed, and her cheek deepened its color.

rosa was cowed in a moment.

out of the room.

eva stood looking at topsy.

there stood the two children representatives of the two extremes of
society. the fair, high-bred child, with her golden head, her deep eyes,
her spiritual, noble brow, and prince-like movements; and her
black, keen, subtle, cringing, yet acute neighbor. they stood the
representatives of their races. the saxon, born of ages of cultivation,
command, education, physical and moral eminence; the afric, born of ages
of oppression, submission, ignorance, toil and vice!

ing, perhaps, of such thoughts struggled through evaâ€™s mind. but a
childâ€™s thoughts are rather dim, undefined instincts; and in evaâ€™s noble
nature many such were yearning and working, for which she had no power
of utterance. when miss ophelia expatiated on topsyâ€™s naughty, wicked
conduct, the child looked perplexed and sorrowful, but said, sweetly.

â€œpoor topsy, why need you steal? youâ€™re going to be taken good care of
now. iâ€™m sure iâ€™d rather give you anything of mine, than have you steal
it.â€

it was the first word of kindness the child had ever heard in her life;
and the sweet tone and manner struck strange

heart, and a sparkle of something like a tear shone in the keen, round,
glittering eye; but it was followed by the short laugh and habitual
grin. no! the ear that has never heard anything but abuse is strangely
incredulous of anything so heavenly as kindness; and topsy only thought
evaâ€™s speech something funny and inexplicable,--she did not believe it.

but what was to be done with topsy? miss ophelia found the case a
puzzler; her rules for bringing up didnâ€™t seem to apply. she thought she
would take time to think of it; and, by the way of gaining time, and in
hopes of some indefinite moral virtues supposed to be inherent in dark
closets, miss ophelia shut topsy up in one till she had arranged her
ideas further on the subject.

â€œi donâ€™t see,â€ said miss ophelia to st

succession, yet she could not, without a watchfulness which
would leave her no time for anything else, detect her.

topsy was soon a noted character in the establishment. her talent for
every species of drollery, grimace, and mimicry,--for dancing, tumbling,
climbing, singing, whistling, imitating every sound that hit her
fancy,--seemed inexhaustible. in her play-hours, she invariably had
every child in the establishment at her heels, open-mouthed with
admiration and wonder,--not excepting miss eva, who appeared to be
fascinated by her wild diablerie, as a dove is sometimes charmed by
a glittering serpent. miss ophelia was uneasy that eva should fancy
topsyâ€™s society so much, and implored st. clare to forbid it.

â€œpoh! let the child alone,â€ said st. clare. â€œtopsy will do her good.â€

â€œbut so depraved a child,--are you not afraid she will teach her some
mischief?â€

â€œshe canâ€™t teach her mischief; she might teach it to some children, but
evil rolls off evaâ€™s mind like dew

off a cabbage-leaf,--not a drop sinks

â€œdonâ€™t be too sure,â€ said miss ophelia. â€œi know iâ€™d never let a child of
mine play with topsy.â€

â€œwell, your children neednâ€™t,â€ said st. clare, â€œbut mine may; if eva
could have been spoiled, it would have been done years ago.â€

topsy was at first despised and contemned by the upper servants. they
soon found reason to alter their opinion. it was very soon discovered
that whoever cast an indignity on topsy was sure to meet with some
inconvenient accident shortly after;--either a pair of ear-rings or
some cherished trinket would be missing, or an article of dress would
be suddenly found utterly ruined, or the person would stumble
accidently into a pail of ho

the rest of this letter gave a list of georgeâ€™s school studies, each
one headed by a flourishing capital; and also told the names of four new
colts that appeared on the premises since tom left; and stated, in the
same connection, that father and mother were well. the style of the
letter was decidedly concise and terse; but tom thought it the most
wonderful specimen of composition that had appeared in modern times. he
was never tired of looking at it, and even held a council with eva on
the expediency of getting it framed, to hang up in his room. nothing but
the difficulty of arranging it so that both sides of the page would show
at once stood in the way of this undertaking.

the friendship between tom and eva had grown with the childâ€™s growth. it
would be hard to say what place she held in the soft, impressible heart
of her faithful attendant. he loved her as something frail and earthly,
yet almost worshipped her as something heavenly and divine. he gazed on
her as the i

d meet those thousand simple wants which invest childhood like
a many-colored rainbow, was tomâ€™s chief delight. in the market, at
morning, his eyes were always on the flower-stalls for rare bouquets
for her, and the choicest peach or orange was slipped into his pocket to
give to her when he came back; and the sight that pleased him most was
her sunny head looking out the gate for his distant approach, and her
childish questions,--â€œwell, uncle tom, what have you got for me today?â€

nor was eva less zealous in kind offices, in return. though a child, she
was a beautiful reader;--a fine musical ear, a quick poetic fancy, and
an instinctive sympathy with whatâ€™s grand and noble, made her such a
reader of the bible as tom had never before heard. at first, she read to
please her humble friend; but soon her own earnest nature threw out its
tendrils, and wound itself around the majestic book; and eva loved it,
because it woke in her strange yearnings, and strong, dim emotions, such

r lay there, rising and falling in the sunbeams,--a picture
never for an hour the same, yet every hour more beautiful.

it is now one of those intensely golden sunsets which kindles the whole
horizon into one blaze of glory, and makes the water another sky. the
lake lay in rosy or golden streaks, save where white-winged vessels
glided hither and thither, like so many spirits, and little golden
stars twinkled through the glow, and looked down at themselves as they
trembled in the water.

tom and eva were seated on a little mossy seat, in an arbor, at the foot
of the garden. it was sunday evening, and evaâ€™s bible lay open on her
knee. she read,--â€œand i saw a sea of glass, mingled with fire.â€

â€œtom,â€ said eva, suddenly stopping, and pointing to the lake, â€œthere â€˜t
is.â€

â€œwhat, miss eva?â€

â€œdonâ€™t you see,--there?â€ said the child, pointing to the glassy water,
which, as it rose and fell, reflected the golden glow of the sky.
â€œthereâ€™s a â€˜sea of glass, mingled wit

â€œtrue enough, miss eva,â€ said tom; and tom sang--

     â€œo, had i the wings of the morning,
     iâ€™d fly away to canaanâ€™s shore;
     bright angels should convey me home,
     to the new jerusalem.â€

â€œwhere do you suppose new jerusalem is, uncle tom?â€ said eva.

â€œo, up in the clouds, miss eva.â€

â€œthen i think i see it,â€ said eva. â€œlook in those clouds!--they look
like great gates of pearl; and you can see beyond them--far, far
off--itâ€™s all gold. tom, sing about â€˜spirits bright.â€™â€

tom sung the words of a well-known methodist hymn,

     â€œi see a band of spirits bright,
     that taste the glories there;
     they all are robed in spotless white,
     and conquering palms they bear.â€

â€œuncle tom, iâ€™ve seen _them_,â€ said eva.

tom had no doubt of it at all; it did not surprise him in the least.
if ev
 
 ___________________________
 
a had told him she had been to heaven, he would have thought it
entirely probable.

â€œthey come to me sometimes in my sleep, those spirits;â€ and evaâ€™s eyes
grew dreamy, and she hummed, in a low voice,

     â€œthey are all robed in spotless white,
     and conquering palms they bear.â€

â€œuncle tom,â€ said eva, â€œiâ€™m going there.â€

â€œwhere, miss eva?â€

the child rose, and pointed her little hand to the sky; the glow of
evening lit her golden hair and flushed cheek with a kind of unearthly
radiance, and her eyes were bent earnestly on the skies.

â€œiâ€™m going _there_,â€ she said, â€œto the spirits bright, tom; _iâ€™m going,
before long_.â€

the faithful old heart felt a sudden thrust; and tom thought how often
he had noticed, within six months, that evaâ€™s little hands had grown
thinner, and her skin more transparent, and her breath 
 
 ___________________________
 
shorter; and how,
when she ran or played in the garden, as she once could for hours, she
became soon so tired and languid. he had heard miss ophelia speak often
of a cough, that all her medicaments could not cure; and even now that
fervent cheek and little hand were burning with hectic fever; and yet
the thought that evaâ€™s words suggested had never come to him till now.

has there ever been a child like eva? yes, there have been; but their
names are always on grave-stones, and their sweet smiles, their heavenly
eyes, their singular words and ways, are among the buried treasures of
yearning hearts. in how many families do you hear the legend that all
the goodness and graces of the living are nothing to the peculiar charms
of one who _is not_. it is as if heaven had an especial band of angels,
whose office it was to sojourn for a season here, and endear to them the
wayward human heart, that they mig

ht bear it upward with them in
their homeward flight. when you see that deep, spiritual light in the
eye,--when the little soul reveals itself in words sweeter and wiser
than the ordinary words of children,--hope not to retain that child; for
the seal of heaven is on it, and the light of immortality looks out from
its eyes.

even so, beloved eva! fair star of thy dwelling! thou art passing away;
but they that love thee dearest know it not.

the colloquy between tom and eva was interrupted by a hasty call from
miss ophelia.

â€œeva--eva!--why, child, the dew is falling; you mustnâ€™t be out there!â€

eva and tom hastened in.

miss ophelia was old, and skilled in the tactics of nursing. she was
from new england, and knew well the first guileful footsteps of that
soft, insidious disease, which sweeps away so many of the fairest
and loveliest, and, before one fibre of life seems broken, seals them
irrevocably for death.

she had noted the slight, dry cough, the dail

t cough!--it is not anything. she has taken a little
cold, perhaps.â€

â€œwell, that was just the way eliza jane was taken, and ellen and maria
sanders.â€

â€œo! stop these hobgoblinâ€™ nurse legends. you old hands got so wise, that
a child cannot cough, or sneeze, but you see desperation and ruin at
hand. only take care of the child, keep her from the night air, and
donâ€™t let her play too hard, and sheâ€™ll do well enough.â€

so st. clare said; but he grew nervous and restless. he watched eva
feverishly day by day, as might be told by the frequency with which
he repeated over that â€œthe child was quite wellâ€--that there wasnâ€™t
anything in that cough,--it was only some little stomach affection, such
as children often had. but he kept by her more than before, took her
oftener to ride with him, brought home every few days some receipt or
strengthening mixture,--â€œnot,â€ he said, â€œthat the child _needed_ it, but
then it would not do her any harm.â€

if it must be told, the thi

 loved to play with topsy, and the various colored
children; but she now seemed rather a spectator than an actor of their
plays, and she would sit for half an hour at a time, laughing at the odd
tricks of topsy,--and then a shadow would seem to pass across her face,
her eyes grew misty, and her thoughts were afar.

â€œmamma,â€ she said, suddenly, to her mother, one day, â€œwhy donâ€™t we teach
our servants to read?â€

â€œwhat a question child! people never do.â€

â€œwhy donâ€™t they?â€ said eva.

â€œbecause it is no use for them to read. it donâ€™t help them to work any
better, and they are not made for anything else.â€

â€œbut they ought to read the bible, mamma, to learn godâ€™s will.â€

â€œo! they can get that read to them all _they_ need.â€

â€œit seems to me, mamma, the bible is for every one to read themselves.
they need it a great many times when there is nobody to read it.â€

â€œeva, you are an odd child,â€ said her mother.

â€œmiss ophelia has taught topsy to read,â€ co

â€œyes, and you see how much good it does. topsy is the worst creature i
ever saw!â€

â€œhereâ€™s poor mammy!â€ said eva. â€œshe does love the bible so much, and
wishes so she could read! and what will she do when i canâ€™t read to
her?â€

marie was busy, turning over the contents of a drawer, as she answered,

â€œwell, of course, by and by, eva, you will have other things to think
of besides reading the bible round to servants. not but that is very
proper; iâ€™ve done it myself, when i had health. but when you come to
be dressing and going into company, you wonâ€™t have time. see here!â€ she
added, â€œthese jewels iâ€™m going to give you when you come out. i wore
them to my first ball. i can tell you, eva, i made a sensation.â€

eva took the jewel-case, and lifted from it a diamond necklace. her
large, thoughtful eyes rested on them

were elsewhere.

â€œhow sober you look child!â€ said marie.

â€œare these worth a great deal of money, mamma?â€

â€œto be sure, they are. father sent to france for them. they are worth a
small fortune.â€

â€œi wish i had them,â€ said eva, â€œto do what i pleased with!â€

â€œwhat would you do with them?â€

â€œiâ€™d sell them, and buy a place in the free states, and take all our
people there, and hire teachers, to teach them to read and write.â€

eva was cut short by her motherâ€™s laughing.

â€œset up a boarding-school! wouldnâ€™t you teach them to play on the piano,
and paint on velvet?â€

â€œiâ€™d teach them to read their own bible, and write their own letters,
and read letters that are written to them,â€ said eva, steadily. â€œi know,
mamma, it does come very hard on them that they canâ€™t do these things.
tom feels it--mammy does,--a great many of them do. i think itâ€™s wrong.â€

â€œcome, come, eva; you are only a child! you donâ€™

marie always had a headache on hand for any conversation that did not

eva stole away; but after that, she assiduously gave mammy reading
lessons.



chapter xxiii

henrique


about this time, st. clareâ€™s brother alfred, with his eldest son, a boy
of twelve, spent a day or two with the family at the lake.

no sight could be more singular and beautiful than that of these twin
brothers. nature, instead of instituting resemblances between them, had
made them opposites on every point; yet a mysterious tie seemed to unite
them in a closer friendship than ordinary.

they

rmly-knit limbs, and decided bearing. they
were always abusing each otherâ€™s opinions and practices, and yet never
a whit the less absorbed in each otherâ€™s society; in fact, the very
contrariety seemed to unite them, like the attraction between opposite
poles of the magnet.

henrique, the eldest son of alfred, was a noble, dark-eyed, princely
boy, full of vivacity and spirit; and, from the first moment of
introduction, seemed to be perfectly fascinated by the spirituelle
graces of his cousin evangeline.

eva had a little pet pony, of a snowy whiteness. it was easy as a
cradle, and as gentle as its little mistress; and this pony was now
brought up to the back verandah by tom, while a little mulatto boy of
about thirteen led along a small black arabian, which had just been
imported, at a great expense, for henrique.

henrique had a boyâ€™s pride in his new possession; and, as he advanced
and took the reins out of the hands of his little groom, he looked
carefully over him, and his brow d

â€œyoung masâ€™r,â€ said tom, â€œi specs what he was gwine to say was, that the
horse would roll when he was bringing him up from the stable; heâ€™s so
full of spirits,--thatâ€™s the way he got that dirt on him; i looked to
his cleaning.â€

â€œyou hold your tongue till youâ€™re asked to speak!â€ said henrique,
turning on his heel, and walking up the steps to speak to eva, who stood
in her riding-dress.

â€œdear cousin, iâ€™m sorry this stupid fellow has kept you waiting,â€ he
said. â€œletâ€™s sit down here, on this seat till they come. whatâ€™s the
matter, cousin?--you look sober.â€

â€œhow could you be so cruel and wicked to poor dodo?â€ asked eva.

â€œcruel,--wicked!â€ said the boy, with unaffected surprise. â€œwhat do you
mean, dear eva?â€

â€œi donâ€™t want you to call me dear eva, when you do so,â€ said eva.

â€œdear cousin, you donâ€™t know dodo; it

â€™s the only way to manage him,
heâ€™s so full of lies and excuses. the only way is to put him down at

â€œbut uncle tom said it was an accident, and he never tells what isnâ€™t
true.â€

â€œheâ€™s an uncommon old nigger, then!â€ said henrique. â€œdodo will lie as
fast as he can speak.â€

â€œyou frighten him into deceiving, if you treat him so.â€

â€œwhy, eva, youâ€™ve really taken such a fancy to dodo, that i shall be
jealous.â€

â€œbut you beat him,--and he didnâ€™t deserve it.â€

â€œo, well, it may go for some time when he does, and donâ€™t get it. a few
cuts never come amiss with dodo,--heâ€™s a regular spirit, i can tell you;
but i wonâ€™t beat him again before you, if it troubles you.â€

eva was not satisfied, but found it in vain to try to make her handsome
cousin understand her feelings.

dodo soon appeared, with the horses.

â€œwell, dod

with a more gracious air. â€œcome, now, and hold miss evaâ€™s horse while i
put her on to the saddle.â€

dodo came and stood by evaâ€™s pony. his face was troubled; his eyes
looked as if he had been crying.

henrique, who valued himself on his gentlemanly adroitness in all
matters of gallantry, soon had his fair cousin in the saddle, and,
gathering the reins, placed them in her hands.

but eva bent to the other side of the horse, where dodo was standing,
and said, as he relinquished the reins,--â€œthatâ€™s a good boy,
dodo;--thank you!â€

dodo looked up in amazement into the sweet young face; the blood rushed
to his cheeks, and the tears to his eyes.

â€œhere, dodo,â€ said his master, imperiously.

dodo sprang and held the horse, while his master mounted.

â€œthereâ€™s a picayune for you to buy candy with, dodo,â€ said henrique; â€œgo

the two children. one had given him money; and one had given him what he
wanted far more,--a kind word, kindly spoken. dodo had been only a
few months away from his mother. his master had bought him at a slave
warehouse, for his handsome face, to be a match to the handsome pony;
and he was now getting his breaking in, at the hands of his young
master.

the scene of the beating had been witnessed by the two brothers st.
clare, from another part of the garden.

â€œof course, they must be _kept down_, consistently, steadily, as
i _should_,â€ said alfred, setting his foot hard down as if he were
standing on somebody.

â€œit makes a terrible slip when they get up,â€ said augustine,--â€œin st.
domingo, for instance.â€

â€œpoh!â€ said alfred, â€œweâ€™ll take care of that, in this country. we must
set our face against all this educating, elevating talk, that is getting
about now; the lower class must not be educated.â€

â€œthat is past praying for,â€ said augustine; â€œeducated they will be, and
we have only to say how. our system is educating them in barbarism and
brutality. we are breaking all humanizing ties, and making them brute
beasts; and, if they get the upper hand, such we shall find them.â€

â€œthey shall never get the upper hand!â€ said alfred.

the two brothers ran up the verandah steps, and were soon seated at a
light bamboo stand, with the backgammon-board between them. as they were
setting their men, alfred said,

â€œi tell you, augustine, if i thought as you do, i should do something.â€

â€œi dare say you would,--you are one of the doing sort,--but what?â€

â€œwhy, elevate your own servants, for a specimen,â€ said alfred, with a
half-scornful smile.

â€œyou might as well set mount Ã¦tna on them flat, and tell them to
stand up under it, as tell me to elevate my servants under all the
superincumbent mass of society upon them. one man can do nothing,
against the whole action of a community. education, to do anything, must
be a state education; or there must be enough agreed in it to make a
current.â€

she was dressed in a blue riding dress, with a cap of the same
color. exercise had given a brilliant hue to her cheeks, and heightened
the effect of her singularly transparent skin, and golden hair.

â€œgood heavens! what perfectly dazzling beauty!â€ said alfred. â€œi tell
you, auguste, wonâ€™t she make some hearts ache, one of these days?â€

â€œshe will, too truly,--god knows iâ€™m afraid so!â€ said st. clare, in a
tone of sudden bitterness, as he hurried down to take her off her horse.

â€œeva darling! youâ€™re not much tired?â€ he said, as he clasped her in his
arms.

â€œno, papa,â€ said the child; but her short, hard breathing alarmed her
father.

â€œhow could you ride so fast, dear?--you know itâ€™s bad for you.â€

â€œi felt so well, papa, and liked it so much, i forgot.â€

st. clare carried her in his arms into the parlor, and laid her on the
sofa.

â€œhenrique, you must be careful of eva,â€ said he; â€œyou mustnâ€™t ride fast
with her.â€

â€œiâ€™ll take her under my care,â

€ said henrique, seating himself by the
sofa, and taking evaâ€™s hand.

eva soon found herself much better. her father and uncle resumed their
game, and the children were left together.

â€œdo you know, eva, iâ€™m sorry papa is only going to stay two days here,
and then i shanâ€™t see you again for ever so long! if i stay with you,
iâ€™d try to be good, and not be cross to dodo, and so on. i donâ€™t mean
to treat dodo ill; but, you know, iâ€™ve got such a quick temper. iâ€™m not
really bad to him, though. i give him a picayune, now and then; and you
see he dresses well. i think, on the whole, dodo â€˜s pretty well off.â€

â€œwould you think you were well off, if there were not one creature in
the

 world near you to love you?â€

â€œi?--well, of course not.â€

â€œand you have taken dodo away from all the friends he ever had, and now
he has not a creature to love him;--nobody can be good that way.â€

â€œwell, i canâ€™t help it, as i know of. i canâ€™t get his mother and i canâ€™t
love him myself, nor anybody else, as i know of.â€

â€œwhy canâ€™t you?â€ said eva.

â€œ_love_ dodo! why, eva, you wouldnâ€™t have me! i may _like_ him well
enough; but you donâ€™t _love_ your servants.â€

â€œi do, indeed.â€

â€œhow odd!â€

â€œdonâ€™t the bible say we must love everybody?â€

â€œo, the bible! to be sure, it says a great many such things; but, then,
nobody ever thinks of doing them,--you know, eva, nobody does.â€

eva did not speak; her eyes were fixed and thoughtful for a few moments.

â€œat any rate,â€ she said, â€œdear cousin, do love poor dodo, and be kind to
him, for my sake!â

â€œi could love anything, for your sake, dear cousin; for i really think
you are the loveliest creature that i ever saw!â€ and henrique spoke
with an earnestness that flushed his handsome face. eva received it with
perfect simplicity, without even a change of feature; merely saying,
â€œiâ€™m glad you feel so, dear henrique! i hope you will remember.â€

the dinner-bell put an end to the interview.



chapter xxiv

foreshadowings


two days after this, alfred st. clare and augustine parted; and eva, who
had been stimulated, by the society of her young cousin, to exertions
beyond her strength, began to fail rapidly. st. clare was at last
willing to call in medical advice,--a thing from whic
 
 ___________________________
 
h he had always
shrunk, because it was the admission of an unwelcome truth.

but, for a day or two, eva was so unwell as to be confined to the house;
and the doctor was called.

marie st. clare had taken no notice of the childâ€™s gradually decaying
health and strength, because she was completely absorbed in studying out
two or three new forms of disease to which she believed she herself was
a victim. it was the first principle of marieâ€™s belief that nobody ever
was or could be so great a sufferer as _herself_; and, therefore, she
always repelled quite indignantly any suggestion that any one ar
 
 ___________________________
 
ound her
could be sick. she was always sure, in such a case, that it was nothing
but laziness, or want of energy; and that, if they had had the suffering
_she_ had, they would soon know the difference.

miss ophelia had several times tried to awaken her maternal fears about
eva; but to no avail.

â€œi donâ€™t see as anything ails the child,â€ she would say; â€œshe runs
about, and plays.â€

â€œbut she has a cough.â€

â€œcough! you donâ€™t need to tell _me_ about a cough. iâ€™ve always been
subject to a cough, all my days. when i was of evaâ€™s age, they thought
i was in a consumption. night after night, mammy used to sit up with me.
o! evaâ€™s cough is not anything.â€

â€œbut she gets weak, and is short-breathed.â€

â€œlaw! iâ€™ve had that, years and years; itâ€™s
 
 ___________________________
 
 only a nervous affection.â€

â€œbut she sweats so, nights!â€

â€œwell, i have, these ten years. very often, night after night, my
clothes will be wringing wet. there wonâ€™t be a dry thread in my
night-clothes and the sheets will be so that mammy has to hang them up
to dry! eva doesnâ€™t sweat anything like that!â€

miss ophelia shut her mouth for a season. but, now that eva was fairly
and visibly prostrated, and a doctor called, marie, all on a sudden,
took a new turn.

â€œshe knew it,â€ she said; â€œshe always felt it, that she was destined
to be the most miserable of mothers. here she was, with her wretched
health, and her only darling child going down to the grave before her
eyes;â€--and marie routed up mammy nights, and rumpussed and scolded,
with more energy than ever, all day, on the strength of this new misery.

â€œmy dear marie, donâ€™t talk so!â€ said 
 
 ___________________________
 
st. clare. â€œyou ought not to give up
the case so, at once.â€

â€œyou have not a motherâ€™s feelings, st. clare! you never could understand
me!--you donâ€™t now.â€

â€œbut donâ€™t talk so, as if it were a gone case!â€

â€œi canâ€™t take it as indifferently as you can, st. clare. if _you_ donâ€™t
feel when your only child is in this alarming state, i do. itâ€™s a blow
too much for me, with all i was bearing before.â€

â€œitâ€™s true,â€ said st. clare, â€œthat eva is very delicate, _that_ i always
knew; and that she has grown so rapidly as to exhaust her strength; and
that her situation is critical. but just now she is only prostrated by
the heat of the weather, and by the excitement of her cousinâ€™s visit,
and the exertions she made. the physician says there is room for hope.â€

â€œwell, of course, if you can look on the bright side, pray do; itâ€™s a
mercy if people havenâ€™t sensitive feelings, in this world. i am sure i
wish i didnâ€™t feel as i do
 
 ___________________________
 
; it only makes me completely wretched! i wish
i _could_ be as easy as the rest of you!â€

and the â€œrest of themâ€ had good reason to breathe the same prayer, for
marie paraded her new misery as the reason and apology for all sorts
of inflictions on every one about her. every word that was spoken by
anybody, everything that was done or was not done everywhere, was only
a new proof that she was surrounded by hard-hearted, insensible beings,
who were unmindful of her peculiar sorrows. poor eva heard some of these
speeches; and nearly cried her little eyes out, in pity for her mamma,
and in sorrow that she should make her so much distress.

in a week or two, there was a great improvement of symptoms,--one of
those deceitful lulls, by which her inexorable disease so often beguiles
the anxious heart, even on the verge of the grave. evaâ€™s step was again
in the garden,--in the balconies; she played and laughed again,--and
her father, in a transport, declared that they should soon have h

as hearty as anybody. miss ophelia and the physician alone felt no
encouragement from this illusive truce. there was one other heart, too,
that felt the same certainty, and that was the little heart of eva. what
is it that sometimes speaks in the soul so calmly, so clearly, that its
earthly time is short? is it the secret instinct of decaying nature, or
the soulâ€™s impulsive throb, as immortality draws on? be it what it may,
it rested in the heart of eva, a calm, sweet, prophetic certainty
that heaven was near; calm as the light of sunset, sweet as the bright
stillness of autumn, there her little heart reposed, only troubled by
sorrow for those who loved her so dearly.

for the child, though nursed so tenderly, and though life was unfolding
before her with every brightness that love and wealth could give, had no
regret for herself in dying.

in that book which she and her simple old friend had read so much
together, she had seen and taken to he

r young heart the image of one who
loved the little child; and, as she gazed and mused, he had ceased to
be an image and a picture of the distant past, and come to be a living,
all-surrounding reality. his love enfolded her childish heart with more
than mortal tenderness; and it was to him, she said, she was going, and
to his home.

but her heart yearned with sad tenderness for all that she was to leave
behind. her father most,--for eva, though she never distinctly thought
so, had an instinctive perception that she was more in his heart than
any other. she loved her mother because she was so loving a creature,
and all the selfishness that she had seen in her only saddened and
perplexed her; for she had a childâ€™s implicit trust that her mother
could not do wrong. there was something about her that eva never could
make out; and she always smoothed it over with thinking that, after all,
it was mamma, and she loved her very dear

ly indeed.

she felt, too, for those fond, faithful servants, to whom she was as
daylight and sunshine. children do not usually generalize; but eva was
an uncommonly mature child, and the things that she had witnessed of the
evils of the system under which they were living had fallen, one by
one, into the depths of her thoughtful, pondering heart. she had vague
longings to do something for them,--to bless and save not only them,
but all in their condition,--longings that contrasted sadly with the
feebleness of her little frame.

â€œuncle tom,â€ she said, one day, when she was reading to her friend, â€œi
can understand why jesus _wanted_ t

â€œwhy, miss eva?â€

â€œbecause iâ€™ve felt so, too.â€

â€œwhat is it miss eva?--i donâ€™t understand.â€

â€œi canâ€™t tell you; but, when i saw those poor creatures on the boat,
you know, when you came up and i,--some had lost their mothers, and some
their husbands, and some mothers cried for their little children--and
when i heard about poor prue,--oh, wasnâ€™t that dreadful!--and a great
many other times, iâ€™ve felt that i would be glad to die, if my dying
could stop all this misery. _i would_ die for them, tom, if i could,â€
 said the child, earnestly, laying her l

tom looked at the child with awe; and when she, hearing her fatherâ€™s
voice, glided away, he wiped his eyes many times, as he looked after
her.

â€œitâ€™s jest no use tryinâ€™ to keep miss eva here,â€ he said to mammy, whom
he met a moment after. â€œsheâ€™s got the lordâ€™s mark in her forehead.â€

â€œah, yes, yes,â€ said mammy, raising her hands; â€œiâ€™ve allers said so.
she wasnâ€™t never like a child thatâ€™s to live--there was allers something
deep in her eyes. iâ€™ve told missis so, many the time; itâ€™s a cominâ€™

glowing cheeks, her eyes unnaturally bright with the slow fever that
burned in her veins.

st. clare had called her to show a statuette that he had been buying
for her; but her appearance, as she came on, impressed him suddenly and
painfully. there is a kind of beauty so intense, yet so fragile, that we
cannot bear to look at it. her father folded her suddenly in his arms,
and almost forgot what he was going to tell her.

â€œeva, dear, you are better now-a-days,--are you not?â€

â€œpapa,â€ said eva, with sudden firmness â€œiâ€™ve had things i wanted to say
to you, a great while. i want to say them now, before i get weaker.â€

st. clare trembled as eva seated herself in his lap. she laid her head
on his bosom, and said,

â€œitâ€™s all no use, papa, to keep it to myself any longer. the time is
coming that i am going to leave you. i am going, and never to come
back!â€ and eva sobbed.

â€œo, now, my dear little eva!â€

 said st. clare, trembling as he spoke, but
speaking cheerfully, â€œyouâ€™ve got nervous and low-spirited; you mustnâ€™t
indulge such gloomy thoughts. see here, iâ€™ve bought a statuette for
you!â€

â€œno, papa,â€ said eva, putting it gently away, â€œdonâ€™t deceive
yourself!--i am _not_ any better, i know it perfectly well,--and i am
going, before long. i am not nervous,--i am not low-spirited. if it were
not for you, papa, and my friends, i should be perfectly happy. i want
to go,--i long to go!â€

â€œwhy, dear child, what has made your poor little heart so sad? you have
had everything, to make you happy, that could be given you.â€

â€œi had rather be in heaven; though, only for my friendsâ€™ sake, i would

that seem dreadful to me; i had rather be there; but i donâ€™t want to

â€œwhat makes you sad, and seems dreadful, eva?â€

â€œo, things that are done, and done all the time. i feel sad for our poor
people; they love me dearly, and they are all good and kind to me. i
wish, papa, they were all _free_.â€

â€œwhy, eva, child, donâ€™t you think they are well enough off now?â€

â€œo, but, papa, if anything should happen to you, what would become of
them? there are very few men like you, papa. uncle alfred isnâ€™t like
you, and mamma isnâ€™t; and then, think of poor old prueâ€™s owners! what
horrid things people do, and can do!â€ and eva shuddered.

â€œmy dear child, you are too sensitive. iâ€™m sorry i ever let you hear
such stories.â€

â€œo, thatâ€™s what troubles me, papa. you want me to live so happy, an

round and try to persuade people to do right about this? when i am dead,
papa, then you will think of me, and do it for my sake. i would do it,
if i could.â€

â€œwhen you are dead, eva,â€ said st. clare, passionately. â€œo, child, donâ€™t
talk to me so! you are all i have on earth.â€

â€œpoor old prueâ€™s child was all that she had,--and yet she had to hear it

we can think _much_, very much, in a moment. st. clare saw and felt many
things, but spoke nothing; and, as it grew darker, he took his child
to her bed-room; and, when she was prepared for rest; he sent away the
attendants, and rocked her in his arms, and sung to her till she was
asleep.



chapter xxv

the little evangelist

it was sunday afternoon. st. clare was stretched on a bamboo lounge in
the verandah, solacing himself with a cigar. marie lay reclined on a
sofa, opposite the window opening on the verandah, closely secluded,
under an awning of transparent gauze, from the outrages of the
mosquitos, and languidly holding in her hand an elegantly bound
prayer-book. she was holding it because it was sunday, and she imagined
she had been reading it,--though, in fact, she had been only taking a
succession of

 short naps, with it open in her hand.

miss ophelia, who, after some rummaging, had hunted up a small methodist
meeting within riding distance, had gone out, with tom as driver, to
attend it; and eva had accompanied them.

â€œi say, augustine,â€ said marie after dozing a while, â€œi must send to the
city after my old doctor posey; iâ€™m sure iâ€™ve got the complaint of the
heart.â€

â€œwell; why need you send for him? this doctor that attends eva seems
skilful.â€

â€œi would not trust him in a critical case,â€ said marie; â€œand i think
i may say mine is becoming so! iâ€™ve been thinking of it, these two
or three nights past; i have such distressing pains, and such strange
feelings.â€

â€œo, marie, you are blue; i donâ€™t believe itâ€™s heart complaint.â€

â€œi dare say _you_ donâ€™t,â€ said marie; â€œi was prepared to expect _that_.
you can be alarmed enough, if eva coughs, or has the least thing the
matter with her; but you never

 think of me.â€

â€œif itâ€™s particularly agreeable to you to have heart disease, why, iâ€™ll
try and maintain you have it,â€ said st. clare; â€œi didnâ€™t know it was.â€

â€œwell, i only hope you wonâ€™t be sorry for this, when itâ€™s too late!â€
 said marie; â€œbut, believe it or not, my distress about eva, and the
exertions i have made with that dear child, have developed what i have
long suspected.â€

what the _exertions_ were which marie referred to, it would have been
difficult to state. st. clare quietly made this commentary to himself,
and went on smoking, like a hard-hearted wretch of a man as he was,
till a carriage drove up before the verandah, and eva and miss ophelia
alighted.

miss ophelia marched straight to her own chamber, to put away her bonnet
and shawl, as was always her manner

, before she spoke a word on any
subject; while eva came, at st. clareâ€™s call, and was sitting on his
knee, giving him an account of the services they had heard.

they soon heard loud exclamations from miss opheliaâ€™s room, which,
like the one in which they were sitting, opened on to the verandah and
violent reproof addressed to somebody.

â€œwhat new witchcraft has tops been brewing?â€ asked st. clare. â€œthat
commotion is of her raising, iâ€™ll be bound!â€

and, in a moment after, miss ophelia, in high indignation, came dragging
the culpr

s ophelia; â€œi canâ€™t have
that trouble any longer.â€

â€œwell, iâ€™d just like to ask one question,â€ said st. clare.

â€œwhat is it?â€

â€œwhy, if your gospel is not strong enough to save one heathen child,
that you can have at home here, all to yourself, whatâ€™s the use of
sending one or two poor missionaries off with it among thousands of just
such? i suppose this child is about a fair sample of what thousands of
your heathen are.â€

miss ophelia did not make an immediate answer; and eva, who had stood a
silent spectator of the scene thus far, made a silent sign to topsy to
follow her. there was a little glass-room at the corner of the verandah,
which st. clare used as a sort of reading-room; and eva and topsy
disappeared into this place.

â€œwhatâ€™s eva going about, now?â€ said st. clare; â€œi mean to see.â€

and, advancing on tiptoe, he lifted up a curtain that covered the
glass-door, and looked in. in a moment, laying his finger on his lips,
he made a silent gesture to mi

with her usual air of careless drollery and unconcern; but, opposite to
her, eva, her whole face fervent with feeling, and tears in her large
eyes.

â€œwhat does make you so bad, topsy? why wonâ€™t you try and be good? donâ€™t
you love _anybody_, topsy?â€

â€œdonno nothing â€˜bout love; i loves candy and sich, thatâ€™s all,â€ said
topsy.

â€œbut you love your father and mother?â€

â€œnever had none, ye know. i telled ye that, miss eva.â€

â€œo, i know,â€ said eva, sadly; â€œbut hadnâ€™t you any brother, or sister, or
aunt, or--â€

â€œno, none on â€˜em,--never had noth

ing nor nobody.â€

â€œbut, topsy, if youâ€™d only try to be good, you might--â€

â€œcouldnâ€™t never be nothinâ€™ but a nigger, if i was ever so good,â€ said
topsy. â€œif i could be skinned, and come white, iâ€™d try then.â€

â€œbut people can love you, if you are black, topsy. miss ophelia would
love you, if you were good.â€

topsy gave the short, blunt laugh that was her common mode of expressing
incredulity.

â€œdonâ€™t you think so?â€ said eva.

â€œno; she canâ€™t bar me, â€˜cause iâ€™m a nigger!--sheâ€™d â€˜s soon have a
toad touch her! there canâ€™t nobody love niggers, and niggers canâ€™t do
nothinâ€™! _i_ donâ€™t care,â€ said topsy, beginning to whistle.

â€œo, topsy, poor child, _i_ love you!â€ said eva, with a sudden burst of
feeling, and laying her little thin, white hand on topsyâ€™s shoulder;
â€œi love you, because you havenâ€™t had any father, or mother, or
friends;--because youâ€™ve been a poor, abused child! i love you,

all be with you.â€

the round, keen eyes of the black child were overcast with
tears;--large, bright drops rolled heavily down, one by one, and fell on
the little white hand. yes, in that moment, a ray of real belief, a ray
of heavenly love, had penetrated the darkness of her heathen soul! she
laid her head down between her knees, and wept and sobbed,--while the
beautiful child, bending over her, looked like the picture of some
bright angel stooping to reclaim a sinner.

â€œpoor topsy!â€ said eva, â€œdonâ€™t you know that jesus loves all alike? he
is just as willing to love you, as me. he loves you just as i do,--only
more, because he is better. he will help you to be good; and you can go
to heaven at last, and be an angel forever, just as much as if you
were white. only think of it, topsy!--_you_ can be one of those spirits
bright, uncle tom sings about.â€

a child, and all the substantial favors you can do them, will never
excite one emotion of gratitude, while that feeling of repugnance
remains in the heart;--itâ€™s a queer kind of a fact,--but so it is.â€

â€œi donâ€™t know how i can help it,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œthey _are_
disagreeable to me,--this child in particular,--how can i help feeling
so?â€

â€œeva does, it seems.â€

â€œwell, sheâ€™s so loving! after all, though, sheâ€™s no more than
christ-like,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œi wish i were like her. she might
teach me a lesson.â€

â€œit wouldnâ€™t be the first time a little child had been used to instruct
an old disciple, if it _were_ so,â€ said st. clare.

evaâ€™s bed-room was a spacious apartment, which, like all the other
rooms in the house, opened on to the broad verandah. the room
communicated, on one side, with her father and motherâ€™s apartment;
on the other, with that appropriated to miss ophelia. st. clare had
gratified his own eye and taste, in furnishing this room in a style
that had a peculiar keeping with the character of her for whom it was
intended. the windows were hung with curtains of rose-colored and white
muslin, the floor was spr

the graceful bamboo lounges were amply supplied with cushions of
rose-colored damask, while over them, depending from the hands of
sculptured figures, were gauze curtains similar to those of the bed. a
light, fanciful bamboo table stood in the middle of the room, where a
parian vase, wrought in the shape of a white lily, with its buds, stood,
ever filled with flowers. on this table lay evaâ€™s books and little
trinkets, with an elegantly wrought alabaster writing-stand, which her
father had supplied to her when he saw her trying to improve herself
in writing. there was a fireplace in the room, and on the marble mantle
above stood a beautifully wrought statuette of jesus receiving little
children, and on either side marble vases, for which it was tomâ€™s pride
and delight to offer bouquets every morning. two or three exquisite
paintings of children, in various attitudes, embellish

short, the eye could turn nowhere without meeting images of childhood,
of beauty, and of peace. those little eyes never opened, in the morning
light, without falling on something which suggested to the heart
soothing and beautiful thoughts.

the deceitful strength which had buoyed eva up for a little while was
fast passing away; seldom and more seldom her light footstep was heard
in the verandah, and oftener and oftener she was found reclined on a
little lounge by the open window, her large, deep eyes fixed on the
rising and falling waters of the lake.

it was towards the middle of the afternoon, as she was so
reclining,--her bible half open, her little transparent fingers lying
listlessly between the leaves,--suddenly she heard her motherâ€™s voice,
in sharp tones, in the v

â€œwhat now, you baggage!--what new piece of mischief! youâ€™ve been picking
the flowers, hey?â€ and eva heard the sound of a smart slap.

â€œlaw, missis! they â€˜s for miss eva,â€ she heard a voice say, which she
knew belonged to topsy.

â€œmiss eva! a pretty excuse!--you suppose she wants _your_ flowers, you
good-for-nothing nigger! get along off with you!â€

in a moment, eva was off from her lounge, and in the verandah.

â€œo, donâ€™t, mother! i should like the flowers; do give them to me; i want
them!â€

â€œwhy, eva, your room is full now.â€

â€œi canâ€™t have too many,â€ said eva. â€œtopsy, do bring them here.â€

topsy, who had stood sullenly, holding down her head, now came up
and offered her flowers. she did it with a look of hesitation and
bashfulness, quite unlike the eldrich boldness and brightness which was
usual with her.

â€œitâ€™s a beautiful bouquet

!â€ said eva, looking at it.

it was rather a singular one,--a brilliant scarlet geranium, and one
single white japonica, with its glossy leaves. it was tied up with an
evident eye to the contrast of color, and the arrangement of every leaf
had carefully been studied.

topsy looked pleased, as eva said,--â€œtopsy, you arrange flowers very
prettily. here,â€ she said, â€œis this vase i havenâ€™t any flowers for. i
wish youâ€™d arrange something every day for it.â€

â€œwell, thatâ€™s odd!â€ said marie. â€œwhat in the world do you want that
for?â€

â€œnever mind, mamma; youâ€™d as lief as not topsy should do it,--had you
not?â€

â€œof course, anything you please, dear! topsy, you hear your young
mistress;--see that you mind.â€

topsy made a short courtesy, and looked down; and, as she

turned away,
eva saw a tear roll down her dark cheek.

â€œyou see, mamma, i knew poor topsy wanted to do something for me,â€ said
eva to her mother.

â€œo, nonsense! itâ€™s only because she likes to do mischief. she knows she
mustnâ€™t pick flowers,--so she does it; thatâ€™s all there is to it. but,
if you fancy to have her pluck them, so be it.â€

â€œmamma, i think topsy is different from what she used to be; sheâ€™s
trying to be a good girl.â€

â€œsheâ€™ll have to try a good while before _she_ gets to be good,â€ said
marie, with a careless laugh.

â€œwell, you know, mamma, poor topsy! everything has always been against

â€œmamma, you believe, donâ€™t you, that topsy could become an angel, as
well as any of us, if she were a christian?â€

â€œtopsy! what a ridiculous idea! nobody but you would ever think of it. i
suppose she could, though.â€

â€œbut, mamma, isnâ€™t god her father, as much as ours? isnâ€™t jesus her
saviour?â€

â€œwell, that may be. i suppose god made everybody,â€ said marie. â€œwhere is
my smelling-bottle?â€

â€œitâ€™s such a pity,--oh! _such_ a pity!â€ said eva, looking out on the
distant lake, and speaking half to herself.

â€œwhatâ€™s a pity?â€ said marie.

â€œwhy, that any one, who could be a bright angel, and live with angels,
should go all down, down down, and nobody help them!--oh dear!â€

â€œwell, we canâ€™t help it; itâ€™s no use worrying, eva! i donâ€™t know whatâ€™s
to be done; we ought to be thankful for our own advantages.â€

â€œi hardly can be,â€ said eva, â€œiâ€™m so sorry to think of poor folks that

â€œwhat for?â€ said marie.

â€œmamma, i want to give some away to my friends, while i am able to give
it to them myself. wonâ€™t you ask aunty to come and cut it for me?â€

marie raised her voice, and called miss ophelia, from the other room.

the child half rose from her pillow as she came in, and, shaking down
her long golden-brown curls, said, rather playfully, â€œcome aunty, shear
the sheep!â€

â€œwhatâ€™s that?â€ said

â€œpapa, i just want aunty to cut off some of my hair;--thereâ€™s too much

miss ophelia came, with her scissors.

â€œtake care,--donâ€™t spoil the looks of it!â€ said her father; â€œcut
underneath, where it wonâ€™t show. evaâ€™s curls are my pride.â€

â€œo, papa!â€ said eva, sadly.

â€œyes, and i want them kept handsome against the time i take you up to
your uncleâ€™s plantation, to see cousin henrique,â€ said st. clare, in a
gay tone.

â€œi shall never go there, papa;--i am going to a better country. o, do
believe me! donâ€™t you see, papa, that i get weaker, every day?â€

â€œwhy do you insist that i shall believe such a cruel thing, eva?â€ said
her father.

â€œonly because it is _true_, papa: and, if you will believe it now,
perhaps you will get to feel about

â€œitâ€™s just what iâ€™ve been foreboding!â€ said marie; â€œitâ€™s just what has
been preying on my health, from day to day, bringing me downward to the
grave, though nobody regards it. i have seen this, long. st. clare, you
will see, after a while, that i was right.â€

â€œwhich will afford you great consolation, no doubt!â€ said st. clare, in
a dry, bitter tone.

marie lay back on a lounge, and covered her face with her cambric
handkerchief.

evaâ€™s clear blue eye looked earnestly from one to the other. it was the
calm, comprehending gaze of a soul half loosed from its earthly bonds;
it was evident she saw, felt, and appreciated, the difference between
the two.

she beckoned with her hand to her father. he came and sat down by her.

â€œpapa, my strength fades away every day, and i know i must go. there are
some things i want to say and do,--that i ought to do; and you are so
unwilling to have me speak a word on this subject. but it mus

â€œmy child, i _am_ willing!â€ said st. clare, covering his eyes with one
hand, and holding up evaâ€™s hand with the other.

â€œthen, i want to see all our people together. i have some things i
_must_ say to them,â€ said eva.

â€œ_well_,â€ said st. clare, in a tone of dry endurance.

miss ophelia despatched a messenger, and soon the whole of the servants
were convened in the room.

eva lay back on her pillows; her hair hanging loosely about her face,
her crimson cheeks contrasting painfully with the intense whiteness of
her complexion and the thin contour of her limbs and features, and her
large, soul-like eyes fixed earnestly on every one.

the servants were struck with a sudden emotion. the spiritual face, the
long locks of hair cut off and lying by her, her fatherâ€™s averted face,
and marieâ€™s sobs, struck at once upon the feelings of a sensitive and
impressible race; an

all looked sad and apprehensive. many of the women hid their faces in
their aprons.

â€œi sent for you all, my dear friends,â€ said eva, â€œbecause i love you.
i love you all; and i have something to say to you, which i want you
always to remember. . . . i am going to leave you. in a few more weeks
you will see me no more--â€

here the child was interrupted by bursts of groans, sobs, and
lamentations, which broke from all present, and in which her slender
voice was lost entirely. she waited a moment, and then, speaking in a
tone that checked the sobs of all, she said,

â€œif you love me, you must not interrupt me so. listen to

him to help you, and get the bible read to you whenever you can; and i
think i shall see you all in heaven.â€

â€œamen,â€ was the murmured response from the lips of tom and mammy,
and some of the elder ones, who belonged to the methodist church. the
younger and more thoughtless ones, for the time completely overcome,
were sobbing, with their heads bowed upon their knees.

â€œi know,â€ said eva, â€œyou all love me.â€

â€œyes; oh, yes! indeed we do! lord bless her!â€ was the involuntary answer
of all.

â€œyes, i know you do! there isnâ€™t one of you that hasnâ€™t always been very
kind to me; and i want to give you something that, when you look at,
you shall always remember me, iâ€™m going to give all of you a curl of my
hair; and, when you look at it, think that i loved you and am gone to
heaven, and that i want to see you all there.â€

it is impossible to describe the scene, as, wi

to them a last mark of her love. they fell on their knees; they sobbed,
and prayed, and kissed the hem of her garment; and the elder ones poured
forth words of endearment, mingled in prayers and blessings, after the
manner of their susceptible race.

as each one took their gift, miss ophelia, who was apprehensive for the
effect of all this excitement on her little patient, signed to each one
to pass out of the apartment.

at last, all were gone but tom and mammy.

â€œhere, uncle tom,â€ said eva, â€œis a beautiful one for you. o, i am so
happy, uncle tom, to think i shall see you in heaven,--for iâ€™m sure i
shall; and mammy,--dear, good, kind mammy!â€ she said, fondly throwing
her arms round her old nurse,--â€œi know youâ€™ll be there, too.â€

â€œo, miss eva, donâ€™t see how i can live without ye, no how!â€ said the
faithful creature. â€œâ€˜pears like itâ€™s just taking everything off the
place to oncet!â€ and mammy gave way to a passion of grief.

miss ophelia pushed her and tom

gently from the apartment, and thought
they were all gone; but, as she turned, topsy was standing there.

â€œwhere did you start up from?â€ she said, suddenly.

â€œi was here,â€ said topsy, wiping the tears from her eyes. â€œo, miss eva,
iâ€™ve been a bad girl; but wonâ€™t you give _me_ one, too?â€

â€œyes, poor topsy! to be sure, i will. there--every time you look at
that, think that i love you, and wanted you to be a good girl!â€

â€œo, miss eva, i _is_ tryin!â€ said topsy, earnestly; â€œbut, lor, itâ€™s so
hard to be good! â€˜pears like i anâ€™t used to it, no ways!â€

â€œjesus knows it, topsy; he is sorry for you; he will help you.â€

topsy, with her eyes hid in her apron, was silently passed from the
apartment by miss ophelia; but, as she went, she hid the precious curl
in her bosom.

all being gone, miss ophelia shut the door. that worthy lady had wiped
away many tears of her own, during the scene; but concern for the

e of such an excitement to her young charge was uppermost in
her mind.

st. clare had been sitting, during the whole time, with his hand shading
his eyes, in the same attitude.

when they were all gone, he sat so still.

â€œpapa!â€ said eva, gently, laying her hand on his.

he gave a sudden start and shiver; but made no answer.

â€œdear papa!â€ said eva.

â€œ_i cannot_,â€ said st. clare, rising, â€œi _cannot_ have it so! the
almighty hath dealt _very bitterly_ with me!â€ and st. clare pronounced
these words with a bitter emphasis, indeed.

â€œaugustine! has not god a right to do what he will with his own?â€ said
miss ophelia.

â€œperhaps so; but that doesnâ€™t make it any easier to bear,â€ said he, with
a dry, hard, tearless manner, as he turned away.

â€œpapa, you break my heart!â€ said eva, rising and throwing herself into
his arms; â€œ

you must not feel so!â€ and the child sobbed and wept with
a violence which alarmed them all, and turned her fatherâ€™s thoughts at
once to another channel.

â€œthere, eva,--there, dearest! hush! hush! i was wrong; i was wicked. i
will feel any way, do any way,--only donâ€™t distress yourself; donâ€™t sob
so. i will be resigned; i was wicked to speak as i did.â€

eva soon lay like a wearied dove in her fatherâ€™s arms; and he, bending
over her, soothed her by every tender word he could think of.

marie rose and threw herself out of the apartment into her own, when she
fell into violent hysterics.

â€œyou didnâ€™t give me a curl, eva,â€ said her father, smiling sadly.

â€œthey are all yours, papa,â€ said she, smiling--â€œyours and mammaâ€™s; and
you must give dear aunty as many as she wants. i only gave them to our
poor people myself, because you know, pap

a, they might be forgotten when
i am gone, and because i hoped it might help them remember. . . . you

â€œwhy do you ask me?â€

â€œi donâ€™t know. you are so good, i donâ€™t see how you can help it.â€

â€œwhat is being a christian, eva?â€

â€œloving christ most of all,â€ said eva.

â€œdo you, eva?â€

â€œcertainly i do.â€

â€œyou never saw him,â€ said st. clare.

â€œthat makes no difference,â€ said eva. â€œi believe him, and in a few days
i shall _see_ him;â€ and the young face grew fervent, radiant with joy.

st. clare said no more. it was a feeling which he had seen before in his
mother; but no chord within vibrated to it.

eva, after this, declined rapidly; there was no more any doubt of the
event; the fondest hope could not be blinded. her beautiful room was
avowedly a sick room; and miss ophelia day and night performed the
duties of a nurse,--and never did her friends appreciate her val

h could promote neatness
and comfort, and keep out of sight every disagreeable incident of
sickness,--with such a perfect sense of time, such a clear, untroubled
head, such exact accuracy in remembering every prescription and
direction of the doctors,--she was everything to him. they who had
shrugged their shoulders at her little peculiarities and setnesses, so
unlike the careless freedom of southern manners, acknowledged that now
she was the exact person that was wanted.

uncle tom was much in evaâ€™s room. the child suffered much from nervous
restlessness, and it was a relief to her to be carried; and it was tomâ€™s
greatest delight to carry her little frail form in his arms, resting on
a pillow, now up and down her room, now out into the verandah; and when
the fresh sea-breezes blew from the lake,--and the child felt freshest
in the morning,--he would sometimes walk with her under the orange-trees
in the garden, or, sitting down in some of their old seats, sing to her
their favorite ol

d hymns.

her father often did the same thing; but his frame was slighter, and
when he was weary, eva would say to him,

â€œo, papa, let tom take me. poor fellow! it pleases him; and you know
itâ€™s all he can do now, and he wants to do something!â€

â€œso do i, eva!â€ said her father.

â€œwell, papa, you can do everything, and are everything to me. you read
to me,--you sit up nights,--and tom has only this one thing, and his
singing; and i know, too, he does it easier than you can. he carries me
so strong!â€

the desire to do something was not confined to tom. every servant in the
establishment showed the same feeling, and in their way did what they
could.

poor mammyâ€™s heart yearned towards her darling; but she found no
opportunity, night or day, as

marie declared that the state of her mind
was such, it was impossible for her to rest; and, of course, it was
against her principles to let any one else rest. twenty times in a
night, mammy would be roused to rub her feet, to bathe her head, to find
her pocket-handkerchief, to see what the noise was in evaâ€™s room, to let
down a curtain because it was too light, or to put it up because it was
too dark; and, in the daytime, when she longed to have some share in the
nursing of her pet, marie seemed unusually ingenious in keeping her busy
anywhere and everywhere all over the house, or about her own person; so
that stolen interviews and momentary glimpses were all she could obtain.

â€œi feel it my duty to be particularly careful of myself, now,â€ she would
say, â€œfeeble as i am, and with the whol

 clare found
a strange calm coming over him. it was not hope,--that was impossible;
it was not resignation; it was only a calm resting in the present, which
seemed so beautiful that he wished to think of no future. it was like
that hush of spirit which we feel amid the bright, mild woods of autumn,
when the bright hectic flush is on the trees, and the last lingering
flowers by the brook; and we joy in it all the more, because we know
that soon it will all pass away.

the friend who knew most of evaâ€™s own imaginings and foreshadowings was
her faithful bearer, tom. to him she said what she would not disturb her
father by saying. to him she imparted those mysterious intimations which
the soul feels, as the cords begin to unbind, ere it leaves its clay
forever.

tom, at last, would not sleep in his room, but lay all night in the
outer verandah, ready to rouse at every call.

â€œuncle tom, what alive have you taken to sleeping anywhere and
everywhere, like a dog, for?â€ said miss ophelia. â

â€œwhat do you mean, tom?â€

â€œyou know it says in scripture, â€˜at midnight there was a great cry
made. behold, the bridegroom cometh.â€™ thatâ€™s what iâ€™m spectin now, every
night, miss feely,--and i couldnâ€™t sleep out oâ€™ hearin, no ways.â€

soul. i must be thar, miss feely; for when that ar blessed child goes
into the kingdom, theyâ€™ll open the door so wide, weâ€™ll all get a look in

â€œuncle tom, did miss eva say she felt more unwell than usual tonight?â€

â€œno; but she telled me, this morning, she was coming nearer,--tharâ€™s

favorite hymn.

this dialogue passed between miss ophelia and tom, between ten and
eleven, one evening, after her arrangements had all been made for the
night, when, on going to bolt her outer door, she found tom stretched
along by it, in the outer verandah.

she was not nervous or impressible; but the solemn, heart-felt manner
struck her. eva had been unusually bright and cheerful, that afternoon,
and had sat raised in her bed, and looked over all her little trinkets
and precious things, and designated the friends to whom she would
have them given; and her manner was more animated, and her voice more
natural, than they had known it for weeks. her father had been in, in
the evening, and had said that eva appeared more like her former self
than ever she had done since her sickness; and when he kissed her for
the night, he said to miss

e night, had discerned what
experienced nurses significantly call â€œa change.â€ the outer door was
quickly opened, and tom, who was watching outside, was on the alert, in
a moment.

â€œgo for the doctor, tom! lose not a moment,â€ said miss ophelia; and,
stepping across the room, she rapped at st. clareâ€™s door.

â€œcousin,â€ she said, â€œi wish you would come.â€

those words fell on his heart like clods upon a coffin. why did they?
he was up and in the room in an instant, and bending over eva, who still
slept.

what was it he saw that made his heart stand still? why was no word
spoken between the two? thou canst say, who hast seen that same
expression on the face dearest to thee;--that look indescribable,
hopeless, unmistakable, that says to thee that thy beloved is no longer
thine.

on the face of the child, however, there was no ghastly imprint,--only
a high and almost sublime expression,--the overshadowing presence of
spiritual natures, the dawning of immortal life in that childi

â€ she hurriedly began.

â€œhush!â€ said st. clare, hoarsely; _â€œshe is dying!â€_

mammy heard the words, and flew to awaken the servants. the house was
soon roused,--lights were seen, footsteps heard, anxious faces thronged
the verandah, and looked tearfully through the glass doors; but st.
clare heard and said nothing,--he saw only _that look_ on the face of
the little sleeper.

â€œo, if she would only wake, and speak once more!â€ he said; and, stooping
over her, he spoke in her ear,--â€œeva, darling!â€

the large blue eyes unclosed--a smile passed over her face;--she tried
to raise her head, and to speak.

â€œdo you know me, eva?â€

â€œdear papa,â€ said the child, with a last effort, throwing her arms about
his neck. in a moment they dropped again; and, as st. clare raised his
head, he saw a spasm of mortal agony pass over the face,--she struggled
for breath, and threw up her little hands.

â€œo, god, this is dreadful!â€ he said, turning away in agony, and wringing

â€œo, bless the lord! itâ€™s over,--itâ€™s over, dear master!â€ said tom; â€œlook

the child lay panting on her pillows, as one exhausted,--the large clear
eyes rolled up and fixed. ah, what said those eyes, that spoke so
much of heaven! earth was past,--and earthly pain; but so solemn, so
mysterious, was the triumphant brightness of that face, that it
checked even the sobs of sorrow. they pressed around her, in breathless
stillness.

â€œeva,â€ said st. clare, gently.

she did not hear.

â€œo, eva, tell us what you see! what is it?â€ said her father.

a bright, a glorious smile passed over her face, and she said,
brokenly,--â€œo! love,--joy,--peace!â€ gave one sigh and passed from death
unto life!

â€œfarewell, beloved child! the bright, eternal doors have closed after
thee; we shall see thy sweet face no more. o, woe for them who watched

     john quincy adams, uttered february 21, 1848.

the statuettes and pictures in evaâ€™s room were shrouded in white
napkins, and only hushed breathings and muffled footfalls were heard
there, and the light stole in solemnly through windows partially
darkened by closed blinds.

the bed was draped in white; and there, beneath the drooping
angel-figure, lay a little sleeping form,--sleeping never to waken!

there she lay, robed in one of the simple white dresses she had been
wont to wear when living; the rose-colored light through the curtains
cast over the icy coldness of death

a warm glow. the heavy eyelashes
drooped softly on the pure cheek; the head was turned a little to
one side, as if in natural sleep, but there was diffused over every
lineament of the face that high celestial expression, that mingling of
rapture and repose, which showed it was no earthly or temporary sleep,
but the long, sacred rest which â€œhe giveth to his beloved.â€

there is no death to such as thou, dear eva! neither darkness nor shadow
of death; only such a bright fading as when the morning star fades in
the golden dawn. thine is the victory without the battle,--the crown
without the conflict.

so did st. clare think, as, with folded arms, he stood there gazing.
ah! who shall say what he did think? for, from the hour that voices
had said, in the dying chamber, â€œshe is gone,â€ it had been all a dreary
mist, a heavy â€œdimness of anguish.â€ he had heard voices around him; he
had had questions as

as they generally were, they were soft-hearted and full of feeling;
and, while miss ophelia presided over the general details of order and
neatness, it was their hands that added those soft, poetic touches to
the arrangements, that took from the death-room the grim and ghastly air
which too often marks a new england funeral.

there were still flowers on the shelves,--all white, delicate and
fragrant, with graceful, drooping leaves. evaâ€™s little table, covered
with white, bore on it her favorite vase, with a single white moss
rose-bud in it. the folds of the drapery, the fall of the curtains, had
been arranged and rearranged, by adolph and rosa, with that nicety of
eye which characterizes their race. even now, while st. clare stood
there thinking, little rosa tripped softly into the chamber with a
basket of white flowers. she stepped back when she saw st. clare, and
stopped respectfully; but, seeing that he did not observe h

â€œget along!â€ said rosa, more decidedly.

â€œlet her stay!â€ said st. clare, suddenly stamping his foot. â€œshe shall
come.â€

rosa suddenly retreated, and topsy came forward and laid her offering at
the feet of the corpse; then suddenly, with a wild and bitter cry,
she threw herself on the floor alongside the bed, and wept, and moaned
aloud.

miss ophelia hastened into the room, and tried to raise and silence her;
but in vain.

â€œo, miss eva! oh, miss eva! i wish i â€˜s dead, too,--i do!â€

there was a piercing wildness in the cry; the blood flushed into st.
clareâ€™s white, marble-like face, and the first tears he had shed since
eva died stood in his eyes.

â€œget up, child,â€ said miss ophelia, in a softened voice; â€œdonâ€™t cry so.
miss eva is gone to heaven; she is an angel.â€

â€œbut i canâ€™t see her!â€ said topsy. â€œi never shall see her!â€ and she
sobbed again.

they all stood a moment in silence.

â€œ_she_ said she

€ she said, as she led her into her room, â€œdonâ€™t
give up! _i_ can love you, though i am not like that dear little child.
i hope iâ€™ve learnt something of the love of christ from her. i can love
you; i do, and iâ€™ll try to help you to grow up a good christian girl.â€

miss opheliaâ€™s voice was more than her words, and more than that were
the honest tears that fell down her face. from that hour, she acquired
an influence over the mind of the destitute child that she never lost.

â€œo, my eva, whose little hour on earth did so much of good,â€ thought st.
clare, â€œwhat account have i to give for my long years?â€

there were, for a while, soft whisperings and footfalls in the chamber,
as one after another stole in, to look at the dead; and then came the
little coffin; and then there was a funeral, and carriages drove to the
door, and strangers came and were seated; and there were white scarfs
and ribbons, and crape bands, and mourners dressed in black crape; and
there were words re

e others, down to a little place at the
bottom of the garden, and there, by the mossy seat where she and tom
had talked, and sung, and read so often, was the little grave. st. clare
stood beside it,--looked vacantly down; he saw them lower the little
coffin; he heard, dimly, the solemn words, â€œi am the resurrection and
the life; he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he
live;â€ and, as the earth was cast in and filled up the little grave,
he could not realize that it was his eva that they were hiding from his
sight.

nor was it!--not eva, but only the frail seed of that bright, immortal
form with which she shall yet come forth, in the day of the lord jesus!

and then all were gone, and the mourners went back to the place which
should know her no more; and marieâ€™s room was darkened, and she lay on
the bed, sobbing and moaning in uncontrollable grief, and calling every
moment for the attentions of all her servants. of course, they had no
time to cry,--why should they?

sis was the principal sufferer in the
case, especially as marie began to have hysterical spasms, and sent for
the doctor, and at last declared herself dying; and, in the running and
scampering, and bringing up hot bottles, and heating of flannels, and
chafing, and fussing, that ensued, there was quite a diversion.

tom, however, had a feeling at his own heart, that drew him to his
master. he followed him wherever he walked, wistfully and sadly; and
when he saw him sitting, so pale and quiet, in evaâ€™s room, holding
before his eyes her little open bible, though seeing no letter or word
of what was in it, there was more sorrow to tom in that still, fixed,
tearless eye, than in all marieâ€™s moans and lamentations.

in a few days the st. clare family were back again in the city;
augustine, with the restlessness of grief, longing for another scene, to
change the current of his thoughts. so they left the house and garden,
with its little grave, and came back to new orleans; and st. clare

on his hat; for there he was, smiling and talking, and reading the
newspaper, and speculating on politics, and attending to business
matters; and who could see that all this smiling outside was but a
hollowed shell over a heart that was a dark and silent sepulchre?

â€œmr. st. clare is a singular man,â€ said marie to miss ophelia, in a
complaining tone. â€œi used to think, if there was anything in the world
he did love, it was our dear little eva; but he seems to be forgetting
her very easily. i cannot ever get him to talk about her. i really did
think he would show more feeling!â€

â€œstill waters run deepest, they used to tell me,â€ said miss ophelia,
oracularly.

â€œo, i donâ€™t believe in such things; itâ€™s all talk. if people have
feeling, they will show it,--they canâ€™t help it; but, then, itâ€™s a great
misfortune to have feeling. iâ€™d rather have been made like st. clare. my
feelings prey upon me so!â€

wiping her eyes.

â€œwell, at all events, he has no consideration for me,â€ said marie; â€œhe
hasnâ€™t spoken one word of sympathy, and he must know how much more a
mother feels than any man can.â€

â€œthe heart knoweth its own bitterness,â€ said miss ophelia, gravely.

â€œthatâ€™s just what i think. i know just what i feel,--nobody else seems
to. eva used to, but she is gone!â€ and marie lay back on her lounge, a

it; but, once fairly away, there was no end to her valuation of it.

while this conversation was taking place in the parlor another was going
on in st. clareâ€™s library.

tom, who was always uneasily following his master about, had seen him go
to his library, some hours before; and, after vainly waiting for him to
come out, determined, at last, to make an errand in. he entered softly.
st. clare lay on his lounge, at the further end of the room. he was
lying on his face, with evaâ€™s bible open before him, at a little
distance. tom walked up, and stood by the sofa. he hesitated; and, while
he was hesitating, st. clare suddenly raised himself up. the honest
face, so full of grief, and with such an imploring expression of
affection and sympathy, struck his master. he laid his hand on tomâ€™s,
and bowed down his forehead on it.

â€œo, tom, my boy, the whole world is as empty as an egg-shell.â€

â€œi know it, masâ€™r,--i know it,â€ said tom; â€œbut, oh, if masâ€™r could o

â€œah, tom! i do look up; but the trouble is, i donâ€™t see anything, when i
do, i wish i could.â€

tom sighed heavily.

â€œit seems to be given to children, and poor, honest fellows, like you,
to see what we canâ€™t,â€ said st. clare. â€œhow comes it?â€

â€œthou has â€˜hid from the wise and prudent, and revealed unto babes,â€™â€
 murmured tom; â€œâ€˜even so, father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.â€™â€

â€œtom, i donâ€™t believe,--i canâ€™t believe,

â€œdear masâ€™r, pray to the good lord,--â€˜lord, i believe; help thou my
unbelief.â€™â€

â€œwho knows anything about anything?â€ said st. clare, his eyes wandering
dreamily, and speaking to himself. â€œwas all that beautiful love and
faith only one of the ever-shifting phases of human feeling, having
nothing real to rest on, passing away with the little breath? and is
there no more eva,--no heaven,--no christ,--nothing?â€

â€œo, dear masâ€™r, there is! i know it; iâ€™m sure of it,â€ said tom, falling
on his knees. â€œdo, do, dear masâ€™r, believe it!â€

â€œhow do you know thereâ€™s any christ, tom! you never saw the lord.â€

â€œfelt him in my soul, masâ€™r,--feel him now! o, masâ€™r, when i was sold
away from my old woman and the children, i was jest aâ€™most broke up. i
felt as if there warnâ€™t nothinâ€™ left; and then the good lord, he stood

â€œfeels it in my soul. o, masâ€™r! â€˜the love of christ, that passeth
knowledge.â€™â€

â€œsingular!â€ said st. clare, turning away, â€œthat the story of a man that
lived and died eighteen hundred years ago can affect people so yet.
but he was no man,â€ he added, suddenly. â€œno man ever had such long and
living power! o, that i could believe what my mother taught me, and pray
as i did when i was a boy!â€

â€œif masâ€™r pleases,â€ said tom, â€œmiss eva used to read this so
beautifully. i wish masâ€™râ€™d be so good as read it. donâ€™t get no readinâ€™,
hardly, now miss evaâ€™s gone.â€

the chapter was the eleventh of john,--the touching account of the
raising of lazarus, st. clare read it aloud, often pausing to wrestle
down feelings which were roused by the pathos of the story. tom knelt
before him, with clasped hands, and with an absorbed expression of love,
trust, adoration, on his quiet face.

tomâ€™s heart was full; he poured it out in prayer, like waters that have
been long suppressed. one thing was plain enough; tom thought there was
somebody to hear, whether there were or not. in fact, st. clare felt
himself borne, on the tide of his faith and feeling, almost to the gates
of that heaven he seemed so vividly to conceive. it seemed to bring him
nearer to eva.

â€œthank you, my boy,â€ said st. clare, when tom rose. â€œi like to hear you,
tom; but go, now, and leave me alone; some other time, iâ€™ll talk more.â€

tom silently left the room.



chapter xxviii

reunion


week after week glided away in the st. clare mansion, and the waves of
life settled back to their usual flow, where that little bark had
gone down. for how imperiously, how coolly, in disregard of all oneâ€™s
feeling, does the hard, cold, uninteresting course of daily realities
move 
 
 ___________________________
 
on! still must we eat, and drink, and sleep, and wake again,--still
bargain, buy, sell, ask and answer questions,--pursue, in short,
a thousand shadows, though all interest in them be over; the cold
mechanical habit of living remaining, after all vital interest in it has
fled.

all the interests and hopes of st. clareâ€™s life had unconsciously wound
themselves around this child. it was for eva that he had managed his
property; it was for eva that he had planned the disposal of his time;
and, to do this and that for eva,--to buy, improve, alter, and arrange,
or dispose something for her,--had been so long his habit, that now she
was gone, there seemed nothing to be thought of, and nothing to be done.

true, there was another life,--a life which, once believed in, stands as
a solemn, significant figure before the otherwise unmeaning ciphers of
time, changing them to orders of mysterious, untold value. st. clare
knew this well; and of

obligation; and a certain fineness of nature gave him such an
instinctive view of the extent of the requirements of christianity, that
he shrank, by anticipation, from what he felt would be the exactions
of his own conscience, if he once did resolve to assume them. for,
so inconsistent is human nature, especially in the ideal, that not to
undertake a thing at all seems better than to undertake and come short.

still st. clare was, in many respects, another man. he read his
little evaâ€™s bible seriously and honestly; he thought more soberly
and practically of his relations to his servants,--enough to make him
extremely dissatisfied with both his past and present course; and one
thing he did, soon after his return to new orleans, and that was to
commence the legal steps necessary to tomâ€™s emancipation, which was to
be perfected as soon as he could get through the necessary formalities.
meantime, he attached himself to tom more and more, every day. in all
the wide world, th

ere was nothing that seemed to remind him so much
of eva; and he would insist on keeping him constantly about him, and,
fastidious and unapproachable as he was with regard to his deeper
feelings, he almost thought aloud to tom. nor would any one have
wondered at it, who had seen the expression of affection and devotion
with which tom continually followed his young master.

â€œwell, tom,â€ said st. clare, the day after he had commenced the legal
formalities for his enfranchisement, â€œiâ€™m going to make a free man of
you;--so have your trunk packed,

ike me has a work from the lord; and masâ€™r st.
clare, that has larnin, and riches, and friends,--how much he might do
for the lord!â€

â€œtom, you seem to think the lord needs a great deal done for him,â€ said
st. clare, smiling.

â€œwe does for the lord when we does for his critturs,â€ said tom.

â€œgood theology, tom; better than dr. b. preaches, i dare swear,â€ said
st. clare.

the conversation was here interrupted by the announcement of some
visitors.

marie st. clare felt the loss of eva as deeply as she could feel
anything; and, as she was a woman that had a great faculty of making
everybody unhappy when she was, her immediate attendants had still
stronger reason to regret the loss of their young mistress, whose
winning ways and gentle intercessions had so often been a shield to them
from the tyrannical and selfish exactions of her mother. poor old mammy,
in particular, whose heart, severed from all natural domestic ties, had
consoled itself with this one beautiful being, was 
 
 ___________________________
 
 ophelia felt the loss; but, in her good and honest heart, it bore
fruit unto everlasting life. she was more softened, more gentle; and,
though equally assiduous in every duty, it was with a chastened and
quiet air, as one who communed with her own heart not in vain. she was
more diligent in teaching topsy,--taught her mainly from the bible,--did
not any longer shrink from her touch, or manifest an ill-repressed
disgust, because she felt none. she viewed her now through the softened
medium that evaâ€™s hand had first held before her eyes, and saw in her
only an immortal creature, whom god had sent to be led by her to glory
and virtue. topsy did not become at once a saint; but the life and death
of eva did work a marked change in her. the callous indifference was
gone; there was now sensibility, hope, desire, and the striving for
good,--a strife irregular, interrupted, suspended oft, but yet renewed
again.

one day, when topsy had been sent for by miss ophelia, she came, hastily
thrusting

ered her rights. the clamor and confusion of the battle drew
miss ophelia and st. clare both to the spot.

â€œsheâ€™s been stealing!â€ said rosa.

â€œi hanâ€™t, neither!â€ vociferated topsy, sobbing with passion.

â€œgive me that, whatever it is!â€ said miss ophelia, firmly.

topsy hesitated; but, on a second order, pulled out of her bosom a
little parcel done up in the foot of one of her own old stockings.

miss ophelia turned it out. there was a small book, which had been given
to topsy by eva, containing a single verse of scripture, arranged for
every day in the year, and in a paper the curl of hair that she had
given her on that memorable day when she had taken her last farewell.

st. clare was a good deal affected at the sight of it; the little book
had been rolled in a long strip of black crape, torn from the funeral
weeds.

â€œwhat did you wrap _this_ round the book for?â€ said st. clare, holding
up the crape.

â€œcause,--cause,--cause â€˜t was miss eva. o, donâ€™t take â€˜em a

â€œi should say,â€ said miss ophelia, â€œthat he ought to repent, and begin
now.â€

â€œalways practical and to the point!â€ said st. clare, his face breaking
out into a smile. â€œyou never leave me any time for general reflections,
cousin; you always bring me short up against the actual present; you
have a kind of eternal _now_, always in your mind.â€

â€œ_now_ is all the time i have anything to do with,â€ said miss ophelia.

â€œdear little eva,--poor child!â€ said st. clare, â€œshe had set her little
simple soul on a good work for me.â€

it was the first time since evaâ€™s death that he had ever said as many
words as these to her, and he spoke now evidently repressing very strong
feeling.

â€œmy view of christianity is such,â€ he added, â€œthat i think no man can
consistently profess it without throwing the whole weight of his being
against this monstrous system of injustice that lies at the foundation
of all our society; and, if

have to go north, where labor is the fashion,--the universal custom;

northern states, to bear with the process of their education and

ught of his home, and that he should
soon be a free man, and able to return to it at will. he thought how he
should work to buy his wife and boys. he felt the muscles of his
brawny arms with a sort of joy, as he thought they would soon belong
to himself, and how much they could do to work out the freedom of his
family. then he thought of his noble young master, and, ever second to
that, came the habitual prayer that he had always offered for him; and
then his thoughts passed on to the beautiful eva, whom he now thought of
among the angels; and he thought till he almost fancied that that bright
face and golden hair were looking upon him, out of the spray of the
fountain. and, so musing, he fell asleep, and dreamed he saw her
coming bounding towards him, just as she used to come, with a wreath
of jessamine in her hair, her cheeks bright, and her eyes radiant with
delight; but, as he looked, she seemed to rise from the ground; her
cheeks wore a paler hue,--her eyes had a deep, divine radianc

mariner shipwrecked almost in port rises the vision of the church-spire
and loving roofs of his native village, seen over the top of some black
wave only for one last farewell. he drew his arms tightly over his
bosom, and choked back the bitter tears, and tried to pray. the poor old
soul had such a singular, unaccountable prejudice in favor of liberty,
that it was a hard wrench for him; and the more he said, â€œthy will be
done,â€ the worse he felt.

he sought miss ophelia, who, ever since evaâ€™s death, had treated him
with marked and respectful kindness.

â€œmiss feely,â€ he said, â€œmasâ€™r st. clare promised me my freedom. he told
me that he had begun to take it out for me; and now, perhaps, if miss
feely would be good enough to speak bout it to missis, she would feel
like goinâ€™ on with it, was it as masâ€™r st. clareâ€™s wish.â€

â€œiâ€™ll speak for you, tom, and do my best,â€ said miss ophelia; â€œbut, if
it depends on mrs. st. clare, i canâ€™t hope much for you;--neverthe

head.â€

â€œwell,â€ said miss ophelia, energetically, â€œi know it was one of the last
wishes of your husband that tom should have his liberty; it was one of
the promises that he made to dear little eva on her death-bed, and i
should not think you would feel at liberty to disregard it.â€

marie had her face covered with her handkerchief at this appeal, and
began sobbing and using her smelling-bottle, with great vehemence.

â€œeverybody goes against me!â€ she said. â€œeverybody is so inconsiderate! i
shouldnâ€™t have expected that _you_ would bring up all these remembrances
of my troubles to me,--itâ€™s so inconsiderate! but nobody ever does

and gasped for breath, and called mammy to open the window, and to bring
her the camphor-bottle, and to bathe her head, and unhook her dress.
and, in the general confusion that ensued, miss ophelia made her escape
to her apartment.

she saw, at once, that it would do no good to say anything more; for
marie had an indefinite capacity for hysteric fits; and, after this,
whenever her husbandâ€™s or evaâ€™s wishes with regard to the servants were
alluded to, she always found it convenient to set one in operation.
miss ophelia, therefore, did the next best thing she could for tom,--she
wrote a letter to mrs. shelby for him, stating his troubles, and urging
them to send to his relief.

the next day, tom and adolph, and some half a dozen other servants,
were marched down to a slave-warehouse, to await the convenience of the
trader, who was going to make up a lot for auction.

on the lower part of a small, mean boat, on the red river, tom

than chains lay on his heart. all had faded from his sky,--moon and

owners; st. clare home, with all its refinements and splendors; the
golden head of eva, with its saint-like eyes; the proud, gay, handsome,
seemingly careless, yet ever-kind st. clare; hours of ease and indulgent
leisure,--all gone! and in place thereof, _what_ remains?

it is one of the bitterest apportionments of a lot of slavery, that
the negro, sympathetic and assimilative, after acquiring, in a refined
family, the tastes and feelings which form the atmosphere of such a
place, is not the less liable to become the bond-slave of the coarsest
and most brutal,--just as a chair or

such as were common among the slaves, â€œput these on.â€

in tomâ€™s hurried exchange, he had not forgotten to transfer his
cherished bible to his pocket. it was well he did so; for mr. legree,
having refitted tomâ€™s handcuffs, proceeded deliberately to investigate
the contents of his pockets. he drew out a silk handkerchief, and put
it into his own pocket. several little trifles, which tom had treasured,
chiefly because they had amused eva, he looked upon with a contemptuous
grunt, and tossed them over his shoulder into the river.

tomâ€™s methodist hymn-book, which, in his hurry, he had forgotten, he now
held up and turned over.

something within the silent black man answered _no!_ and, as if repeated
by an invisible voice, came the words of an old prophetic scroll, as eva
had often read them to him,--â€œfear not! for i have redeemed thee. i have
called thee by name. thou art mine!â€

but simon legree heard no voice. that voice is one he never shall hear.
he only glared for a moment on the downcast face of tom, and walked off.

tom rose, disconsolate, and stumbled into the cabin that had been
allotted to him. the floor was already strewn with weary sleepers, and
the foul air of the place almost repelled him; but the heavy night-dews
were chill, and his limbs weary, and, wrapping about him a tattered
blanket, which formed his only bed-clothing, he stretched himself in the
straw and fell asleep.

in dreams, a gentle voice came over his ear; he was sitting on the mossy
seat in the garden by lake pontchartrain, and eva, with her serious eyes
bent downward, was reading to him from the bible; and he heard her read.

â€œwhen thou passest through the waters, i will be with thee, and the
rivers they shall not overflow thee; when thou walkest through the fire,
thou shalt not be burned, neither shall the flame kindle upon thee; for
i am the lord thy god, the holy one of israel, thy saviour.â€

gradually the words seemed to melt and fade, as in a divine music; the
child raised her deep eyes, and fixed them lovingly

tried to drink, and revel, and swear away the memory; but often, in
the deep night, whose solemn stillness arraigns the bad soul in forced
communion with herself, he had seen that pale mother rising by his
bedside, and felt the soft twining of that hair around his fingers, till
the cold sweat would roll down his face, and he would spring from his
bed in horror. ye who have wondered to hear, in the same evangel, that
god is love, and that god is a consuming fire, see ye not how, to the
soul resolved in evil, perfect love is the most fearful torture, the
seal and sentence of the direst despair?

it was whisperingly asserted that footsteps, in the dead of night, had
been heard descending the garret stairs, and patrolling the house. in
vain the doors of the upper entry had been locked; the ghost either
carried a duplicate key in its pocket, or availed itself of a ghostâ€™s
immemorial privilege of coming through the keyhole, and promenaded as
before, with a freedom that was alarming.

authorities were somewhat divided, as to the outward form of the spirit,
owing to a custom quite prevalent among negroes,--and, for aught we
know, among whites, too,--of invariably shutting the eyes, and covering
up heads under blankets, petticoats, or whatever else might come in use
for a shelter, on these occasions. of course, as everybody knows,
when the bodily eyes are thus out of the lists, the spiritual eyes
are uncommonly vivacious and perspicuous; and, therefore, there were
abundance of full-length portraits of the ghost, abundantly sworn and
testified to, which, as is often the case wit
