[CHARACTER] - 
                a
capulet, juliet's cousin on her mother's side. vain, fashionable,
supremely aware of courtesy and the lack of it, he becomes aggressive,
violent, and quick to draw his sword when he feels his pride has
been injured. once drawn, his sword is something to be feared. he loathes
montagues.
