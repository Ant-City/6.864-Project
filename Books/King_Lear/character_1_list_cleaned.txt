[CHARACTER] - 
                lear's
youngest daughter, disowned by her father for refusing to flatter
him. [CHARACTER] is held in extremely high regard by all of the good
characters in the play--the king of france marries her for her virtue
alone, overlooking her lack of dowry. she remains loyal to lear
despite his cruelty toward her, forgives him, and displays a mild
and forbearing temperament even toward her evil sisters, goneril
and regan. despite her obvious virtues, [CHARACTER]'s reticence makes
her motivations difficult to read, as in her refusal to declare her
love for her father at the beginning of the play.
