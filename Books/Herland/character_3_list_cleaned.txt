[CHARACTER] - 
one of the three explorers who discover herland, and the novel's
narrator. a sociologist by training, van is the "philosopher" of the group--the
one who understands herland most fully and critically--and the one who is most
convinced that herland has much to teach the outside world. van has some
difficulty adjusting to a society in which women are simply "people" and not a
protected and constrained "weaker sex," but once he makes the shift, van sees
the revolutionary implications of such a change more deeply than do his
friends.
