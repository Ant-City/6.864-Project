--grateful,
deep down in her heart, that the child had not inherited the
great beauty that was hers: that her skin had dusk in it, that
her lashes were substantial but not undignified in their
length, that she had taken the broad flat nose of wiley
(although helene expected to improve it somewhat) and his
generous lips. under helene's hand the girl became
obedient and polite. any enthusiasms that little nel showed
were calmed by the mother until she drove her daughter's
imagination underground. helene wright was an
impressive woman, at least in medallion she was. heavy
hair in a bun, dark eyes arched in a perpetual query about
other people's manners. a woman who won all social
battles with presence and a conviction of the legitimacy of
her authority. since there was no catholic church in
medallion then, she joined the most conservative black
church. and held sway. it was helene who never turned her
head in church when latecomers arrived; helene who
established the practice of seasonal altar flowers

any bodily expression of joy (except when the hand of god
commanded it) tapped their feet. somebody (the groom's
father, everybody said) had poured a whole pint jar of cane
liquor into the punch, so even the men who did not sneak
out the back door to have a shot, as well as the women who
let nothing stronger than black draught enter their blood,
were tipsy. a small boy stood at the victrola turning its
handle and smiling at the sound of bert williams' "save a
little dram for me." even helene wright had mellowed with
the cane, waving away apologies for drinks spilled on her
rug and paying no attention whatever to the chocolate cake
lying on the arm of her red-velvet sofa. the tea roses above
her left breast had slipped from the brooch that fastened
them and were hanging heads down. when her husband
called her attention to the children wrapping themselves
into her curtains, she merely smiled and said, "oh, let them
be." she was not only a little drunk, she was weary and had
been for weeks.

d play in the sunshine--as
though the sunshine would last, as though there really was
hope. the same hope that kept them picking beans for
other farmers; kept them from finally leaving as they talked
of doing; kept them knee-deep in other people's dirt; kept
them excited about other people's wars; kept them
solicitous of white people's children; kept them convinced
that some magic "government" was going to lift them up,
out and away from that dirt, those beans, those wars.
some, of course, like helene wright, would not go. she
watched the ruckus with characteristic scorn. others, who
understood the spirit's touch which made them dance, who
understood whole families bending their backs in a field
while singing as from one throat, who understood the
ecstasy of river baptisms under suns just like this one, did
not understand this curious disorder, this headless display
and so refused also to go. nevertheless, the sun splashed
on a larger and larger crowd that strutted, skipped,
marched, and shuffled d
