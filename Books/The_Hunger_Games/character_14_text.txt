at the sight of this magical wisp of a tribute. caesarâ€™s very 
sweet with her, complimenting her seven in training, an excel-
lent score for one so small. when he asks her what her great-
est strength in the arena will be, she doesnâ€™t hesitate. â€œiâ€™m 
very hard to catch,â€ she says in a tremulous voice. â€œand if they 
canâ€™t catch me, they canâ€™t kill me. so donâ€™t count me out.â€ 
â€œi wouldnâ€™t in a million years,â€ says caesar encouragingly. 
the boy tribute from district 11, thresh, has the same dark 
skin as rue, but the resemblance stops there. heâ€™s one of the 
giants, probably six and a half feet tall and built like an ox, but 
i noticed he rejected the invitations from the career tributes 
to join their crowd. instead heâ€™s been very solitary, speaking 
to no one, showing little interest in training. even so, he 
scored a ten and itâ€™s not hard to imagine he impressed the 
gamemakers. he ignores caesarâ€™s attempts at banter and an-
swers with a yes or no or just

know a bluff when he sees it. besides you didnâ€™t say you loved 
me. so what does it matter?â€ 
the words are sinking in. my anger fading. iâ€™m torn now be-
tween thinking iâ€™ve been used and thinking iâ€™ve been given an 
edge. haymitch is right. i survived my interview, but what was 
i really? a silly girl spinning in a sparkling, dress. giggling. the 
only moment of any substance i hail was when i talked about 
prim. compare that with thresh, his silent, deadly power, and 
iâ€™m forgettable. silly and sparkly and forgettable. no, not en-
tirely forgettable, i have my eleven in training. 
but now peeta has made me an object of love. not just his. 
to hear him tell it i have many admirers. and if the audience 
really thinks weâ€™re in love . . . i remember how strongly they 
responded to his confession. star-crossed lovers. haymitch is 
right, they eat that stuff up in the capitol. suddenly iâ€™m wor-
ried that i didnâ€™t react prope

an edge by professing his love for me in the interview. the an-
ger at his superiority on the roof. the dread that we may come 
face-to-face at any moment in this arena.

who is left. five career tributes. foxface. thresh and rue. rue

feeling glad. that makes ten of us. the other three iâ€™ll figure 
out tomorrow. now when it is dark, and i have traveled far, 
and i am nestled high in this tree, now i must try and rest. 
i havenâ€™t really slept in two days, and then thereâ€™s been the 
long dayâ€™s journey into the arena. slowly, i allow my muscles

non jolts me awake. the skyâ€™s streaked 
with light, the birds already chattering. rue perches in a 
branch across from me, her hands cupping something. we 
wait, listening for more shots, but there arenâ€™t any. 
â€œwho do you think that was?â€ i canâ€™t help thinking of peeta. 
â€œi donâ€™t know. it could have been any of the others,â€ says 
rue. â€œi guess weâ€™ll know tonight.â€ 
â€œwhoâ€™s left again?â€ i ask. 
â€œthe boy from district one. both tributes from two. the 
boy from three. thresh and me. and you and peeta,â€ says rue. 
â€œthatâ€™s eight. wait, and the boy from ten, the one with the bad 
leg. he makes nine.â€ 
thereâ€™s someone else, but neither of us can remember who 
it is. â€œi wonder how that last one died,â€ says rue. 
â€œno telling. but itâ€™s good for us. a death should hold the 
crowd for a bit. maybe weâ€™ll have time to do something before 
the gamemakers decide things have been moving too slowly,â€ 
i say. â€œwhatâ€™s in your hands?â€

â€œyes, he stays at the camp full-time. he got stung, too, when 
they drew the tracker jackers in by the lake,â€ says rue. â€œi 
guess they agreed to let him live if he acted as their guard. but 
heâ€™s not very big.â€ 
â€œwhat weapons does he have?â€ i ask. 
â€œnot much that i could see. a spear. he might be able to 
hold a few of us off with that, but thresh could kill him easily,â€ 
says rue. 
â€œand the foodâ€™s just out in the open?â€ i say. she nods. 
â€œsomethingâ€™s not quite right about that whole setup.â€ 
â€œi know. but i couldnâ€™t tell what exactly,â€ says rue. â€œkatniss,

smoke i spied before i blew up the supplies and this point, she 
ran into trouble. 
i have to remind myself sheâ€™s still alive. or is she? could the 
cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee 
hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken 
to pick it up? will she appear in the sky tonight? no, i refuse to 
believe it. there could be a hundred other explanations. she 
could have lost her way. run into a pack of predators or 
another tribute, like thresh, and had to hide. whatever hap-
pened, iâ€™m almost certain sheâ€™s stuck out there, somewhere 
between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. some-
thing is keeping her up a tree. 
i think iâ€™ll go hunt it down. 
itâ€™s a relief to be doing something after sitting around all af-

conceal me. but nothing seems suspicious. thereâ€™s no sign of

scared of me? they know i have the bow and arrows, of 
course, cato saw me take them from glimmerâ€™s body, but have 
they put two and two together yet? figured out i blew up the 
supplies and killed their fellow career? possibly they think 
thresh did this. wouldnâ€™t he be more likely to revenge rueâ€™s 
death than i would? being from the same district? not that he 
ever took any interest in her. 
and what about foxface? did she hang around to watch me 
blow up the supplies? no. when i caught her laughing in the 
ashes the next morning, it was as if someone had given her a 
lovely surprise.

turns out, has never been a danger to me. 
the thought makes me smile. i drop my hands and hold my 
face up to the moonlight so the cameras can be sure to catch it. 
so, who is there left to be afraid of? foxface? the boy tri-
bute from her district is dead. sheâ€™s operating alone, at night. 
and her strategy has been to evade, not attack. i donâ€™t really 
think that, even if she heard my voice, sheâ€™d do anything but 
hope someone else would kill me. 
then thereâ€™s thresh. all right, heâ€™s a distinct threat. but i 
havenâ€™t seen him, not once, since the games began. i think 
about how foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at 
the site of the explosion. but she didnâ€™t turn to the woods, she 
turned to whatever lies across from it. to that area of the are-
na that drops off into i donâ€™t know what. i feel almost certain 
that the person she ran from was thresh and that is his do-
main. heâ€™d never have heard me from there and, even if he

curve to the left into a part of the woods thatâ€™s new to me.

trapped. it would be no small matter to escape the stream

terrain. in fact, iâ€™ve just about decided iâ€™m on the wrong track 
entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate get-

streak going down the curve of a boulder. itâ€™s long dried now, 
but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone â€” 
who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties â€” 
tried to wipe it away.

â€œi thought cato and clove might have found you. they like

the rocks again, put on the lid, and let the whole thing stew. 
iâ€™ve seen very few signs of game around, but i donâ€™t feel 
comfortable leaving peeta alone while i hunt, so i rig half a 
dozen snares and hope i get lucky. i wonder about the other 
tributes, how theyâ€™re managing now that their main source of 
food has been blown up. at least three of them, cato, clove, 
and foxface, had been relying on it. probably not thresh 
though. iâ€™ve got a feeling he must share some of rueâ€™s know-
ledge on how to feed yourself from the earth. are they fighting 
each other? looking for us? maybe one of them has located us 
and is just waiting for the right moment to attack. the idea 
sends me back to the cave. 
peetaâ€™s stretched out on top of the sleeping bag in the 
shade of the rocks. although he brightens a bit when i come 
in, itâ€™s clear he feels miserable. i put cool cloths on his head,

thereâ€™s nothing else, just his words hanging in the air. i 
jump as peeta grips my shoulder from behind. â€œno,â€ he says. 
â€œyouâ€™re not risking your life for me.â€ 
â€œwho said i was?â€ i say. 
â€œso, youâ€™re not going?â€ he asks. 
â€œof course, iâ€™m not going. give me some credit. do you think 
iâ€™m running straight into some free-for-all against cato and 
clove and thresh? donâ€™t be stupid,â€ i say, helping him back to 
bed. â€œiâ€™ll let them fight it out, weâ€™ll see whoâ€™s in the sky tomor-

i chew a few mint leaves, my stomach isnâ€™t up for much 
more. thank goodness, i have peetaâ€™s jacket as well as my 
own. if not, iâ€™d be forced to move around to stay warm. the 
sky turns a misty morning gray and still thereâ€™s no sign of the 
other tributes. itâ€™s not surprising really. everyone has distin-
guished themselves either by strength or deadliness or cun-
ning. do they suppose, i wonder, that i have peeta with me? i 
doubt foxface and thresh even know he was wounded. all the 
better if they think heâ€™s covering me when i go in for the 
backpack. 
but where is it? the arena has lightened enough for me to 
remove my glasses. i can hear the morning birds singing. isnâ€™t 
it time? for a second, iâ€™m panicked that iâ€™m at the wrong loca-
tion. but no, iâ€™m certain i remember claudius templesmith

whereâ€™s my feast?

taste of my own blood. i stagger backward but still manage to 
send my readied arrow in the general direction of my assai-

slams into me, knocking me flat on my back, pinning my 
shoulders to the ground, with her knees. 
this is it, i think, and hope for primâ€™s sake it will be fast. but 
clove means to savor the moment. even feels she has time. no 
doubt cato is somewhere nearby, guarding her, waiting for 
thresh and possibly peeta. 
â€œwhereâ€™s your boyfriend, district twelve? still hanging 
on?â€ she asks. 
well, as long as weâ€™re talking iâ€™m alive. â€œheâ€™s out there now.

lungs. â€œpeeta!â€

feel the tip open the first cut at my lip, some great form yanks 
clove from my body and then sheâ€™s screaming. iâ€™m too 
stunned at first, too unable to process what has happened. has 
peeta somehow come to my rescue? have the gamemakers 
sent in some wild animal to add to the fun? has a hovercraft 
inexplicably plucked her into the air? 
but when i push myself up on my numb arms, i see itâ€™s 
none of the above. clove is dangling a foot off the ground, im-
prisoned in threshâ€™s arms. i let out a gasp, seeing him like 
that, towering over me, holding clove like a rag doll. i remem-
ber him as big, but he seems more massive, more powerful 
than i even recall. if anything, he seems to have gained weight 
in the arena. he flips clove around and flings her onto the 
ground. when he shouts, i jump, never having heard him speak 
above a mutter. â€œwhatâ€™d you do to that little girl? you kill 
her?â€

her up like you were going to cut up this girl here?â€

â€œclove!â€ i hear catoâ€™s answer, but heâ€™s too far away, i can 
tell that much, to do her any good. what was he doing? trying 
to get foxface or peeta? or had he been lying in wait for 
thresh and just badly misjudged his location? 
thresh brings the rock down hard against cloveâ€™s temple. 
itâ€™s not bleeding, but i can see the dent in her skull and i know 
that sheâ€™s a goner. thereâ€™s still life in her now though, in the

when thresh whirls around on me, the rock raised, i know 
itâ€™s no good to run. and my bow is empty, the last loaded ar-
row having gone in cloveâ€™s direction. iâ€™m trapped in the glare 
of his strange golden brown eyes. â€œwhatâ€™d she mean? about

tears spring in my eyes. the tension, the fight goes out of 
me at the memory. and iâ€™m overwhelmed by rue, and the pain 
in my head, and my fear of thresh, and the moaning of the dy-
ing girl a few feet away. 
â€œto sleep?â€ thresh says gruffly. 
â€œto death. i sang until she died,â€ i say. â€œyour district. . . they 
sent me bread.â€ my hand reaches up but not for an arrow that 
i know iâ€™ll never reach. just to wipe my nose. â€œdo it fast, okay, 
thresh?â€ 
conflicting emotions cross threshâ€™s face. he lowers the 
rock and points at me, almost accusingly. â€œjust this one time, i 
let you go. for the little girl. you and me, weâ€™re even then. no 
more owed. you understand?â€ 
i nod because i do understand. about

owing. about hating 
it. i understand that if thresh wins, heâ€™ll have to go back and 
face a district that has already broken all the rules to thank 
me, and he is breaking the rules to thank me, too. and i under-
stand that, for the moment, thresh is not going to smash in 
my skull. 
â€œclove!â€ catoâ€™s voice is much nearer now. i can tell by the 
pain in it that he sees her on the ground. 
â€œyou better run now, fire girl,â€ says thresh. 
i donâ€™t need to be told twice. i flip over and my feet dip into 
the hard-packed earth as i run away from thresh and clove 
and the sound of catoâ€™s voice. only when i reach the woods do 
i turn back for an instant. thresh and both large backpacks 
are vanishing over the edge of the plain into the area iâ€™ve nev-
er seen. cato kneels beside clove, spear in hand, begging her

to stay with him. in a moment, he will realize itâ€™s futile, she 
canâ€™t be saved. i crash into the

 trees, repeatedly swiping away 
the blood thatâ€™s pouring into my eye, fleeing like the wild, 
wounded creature i am. after a few minutes, i hear the cannon 
and i know that clove has died, that cato will be on one of our 
trails. either threshâ€™s or mine. iâ€™m seized with terror, weak 
from my head wound, shaking. i load an arrow, but cato can 
throw that spear almost as far as i can shoot. 
only one thing calms me down. thresh has catoâ€™s backpack 
containing the thing he needs desperately. if i had to bet, cato 
headed out after thresh, not me. still i donâ€™t slow down when 
i reach the water. i plunge right in, boots still on, and flounder 
downstream. i pull off rueâ€™s socks that iâ€™ve been using for 
gloves and press them into my forehead, trying to staunch the 
flow of blood, but theyâ€™re soaked in minutes. 
somehow i make it back to the cave. i squeeze through the

lightning electrify the sky through an opening in the rocks. 
rain drips through several holes in the ceiling, but peeta has 
built a sort of canopy over my head an upper body by wedging 
the square of plastic into the rock above me. 
â€œi wonder what brought on this storm? i mean, whoâ€™s the 
target?â€ says peeta.

â€œlucky he didnâ€™t catch you, too,â€ says peeta.

my ear and rueâ€™s dying and the boy from district 1 and the

how he was paying off a debt of sorts. 
â€œhe let you go because he didnâ€™t want to owe you any-
thing?â€ asks peeta in disbelief. 
â€œyes. i donâ€™t expect you to understand it. youâ€™ve always had 
enough. but if youâ€™d lived in the seam, i wouldnâ€™t have to ex-

wouldnâ€™t even have been here to do it if you hadnâ€™t helped me 
then,â€ i say. â€œwhy did you, anyway?â€ 
â€œwhy? you know why,â€ peeta says. i give my head a slight, 
painful shake. â€œhaymitch said you would take a lot of convinc-
ing.â€ â€œhaymitch?â€ i ask. â€œwhatâ€™s he got to do with it?â€ 
â€œnothing,â€ peeta says. â€œso, cato and thresh, huh? i guess 
itâ€™s too much to hope that theyâ€™ll simultaneously destroy each 
other?â€ 
but the thought only upsets me. â€œi think we would like 
thresh. i think heâ€™d be our friend back in district twelve,â€ i 
say. â€œthen letâ€™s hope cato kills him, so we donâ€™t have to,â€ says 
peeta grimly. 
i donâ€™t want cato to kill thresh at all. i donâ€™t want anyone 
else to die. but this is absolutely not the kind of thing that vic-
tors go around saying in the arena. despite my best effo

â€œthe bread they sent me from district eleven was still

couple of mint leaves and pop a few in my own mouth. 
itâ€™s hard to even see the projection in the sky, but itâ€™s clear 
enough to know there were no more deaths today. so cato 
and thresh havenâ€™t had it out yet. 
â€œwhere did thresh go? i mean, whatâ€™s on the far side of the 
circle?â€ i ask peeta. 
â€œa field. as far as you can see itâ€™s full of grasses as high as 
my shoulders. i donâ€™t know, maybe some of them are grain. 
there are patches of different colors. but there are no paths,â€ 
says peeta. 
â€œi bet some of them are grain. i bet thresh knows which 
ones, too,â€ i say. â€œdid you go in there?â€ 
â€œno. nobody really wanted to track thresh down in that 
grass.

 it has a sinister feeling to it. every time i look at that 
field, all i can think of are hidden things. snakes, and rabid an-

there.â€

i donâ€™t say so but peetaâ€™s words remind me of the warnings 
they give us about not going beyond the fence in district 12. i 
canâ€™t help, for a moment, comparing him with gale, who 
would see that field as a potential source of food as well as a 
threat. thresh certainly did. itâ€™s not that peetaâ€™s soft exactly, 
and heâ€™s proved heâ€™s not a coward. but there are things you 
donâ€™t question too much, i guess, when your home always 
smells like baking bread, whereas gale questions everything. 
what would peeta think of the irreverent banter that passes 
between us as we break the law each day? would it shock 
him? the things we say about panem? galeâ€™s tirades against 
the capitol? 
â€œmaybe there is a bread bush in that field,â€ i say. â€œmayb

thatâ€™s why thresh looks better fed now than when we started 
the games.â€ 
â€œeither that or heâ€™s got very generous sponsors,â€ says pee-
ta. â€œi wonder what weâ€™d have to do to get haymitch to send us 
some bread.â€ 
i raise my eyebrows before i remember he doesnâ€™t know 
about the message haymitch sent us a couple of nights ago. 
one kiss equals one pot of broth. itâ€™s not the sort of thing i can 
blurt out, either. to say my thoughts aloud would be tipping 
off the audience that the romance has been

of broth to peeta, whereas iâ€™ll see the strings attached to it. 
a thought hits me, and iâ€™m amazed the questionâ€™s taken so 
long to surface. maybe itâ€™s because iâ€™ve only recently begun to 
view haymitch with a degree of curiosity. â€œhow do you think 
he did it?â€ 
â€œwho? did what?â€ peeta asks. 
â€œhaymitch. how do you think he won the games?â€ i say. 
peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. hay-
mitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like cato or 
thresh. heâ€™s not particularly handsome. not in the way that 
causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. and heâ€™s so surly, itâ€™s 
hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. thereâ€™s only 
one way haymitch could have won, and peeta says it just as 
iâ€™m reaching this conclusion myself. 
â€œhe outsmarted the others,â€ says peeta. 
i nod, then let the conversation drop. but secretly iâ€™m won-
dering if haymitch sobered up long enough to help peeta and 
me because he thought we just might have the wi

â€œthere wonâ€™t be anything to see tonight,â€ i say, far more in-
terested in the stew than the sky. â€œnothingâ€™s happened or we 
wouldâ€™ve heard a cannon.â€ 
â€œkatniss,â€ peeta says quietly. 
â€œwhat? should we split another roll, too?â€ i ask. 
â€œkatniss,â€ he repeats, but i find myself wanting to ignore 
him. â€œiâ€™m going to split one. but iâ€™ll save the cheese for tomor-
row,â€ i say. i see peeta staring at me. â€œwhat?â€ 
â€œthresh is dead,â€ says peeta. 
â€œhe canâ€™t be,â€ i say. 
â€œthey must have fired the cannon during the thunder and 
we missed it,â€ says peeta. 
â€œare you sure? i mean, itâ€™s pouring buckets out there. i 
donâ€™t know how you can see anything,â€ i say. i push him away 
from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. for 
about ten seconds, i catch a distorted glimpse of threshâ€™s pic-
ture and then heâ€™s gone. just like that. 
i slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting

i give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my 
hands, hugging them close to my body. i have to bury the real 
pain because whoâ€™s going to bet on a tribute who keeps snive-
ling over the deaths of her opponents. rue was one thing. we 
were allies. she was so young. but no one will understand my 
sorrow at threshâ€™s murder. the word pulls me up sh

der! thankfully, i didnâ€™t say it aloud. thatâ€™s not going to win 
me any points in the arena. what i do say is, â€œitâ€™s just . . . if we 
didnâ€™t win . . . i wanted thresh to. because he let me go. and 
because of rue.â€ 
â€œyeah, i know,â€ says peeta. â€œbut this means weâ€™re one step 
closer to district twelve.â€ he nudges a plate of foot into my 
hands. â€œeat. itâ€™s still warm.â€ 
i take a bite of the stew to show i donâ€™t really care, but itâ€™s 
like glue in my mouth and takes a lot of effort to swallow. â€œit 
also means cato will be back hunting us.â€ 
â€œand heâ€™s got supplies again,â€ says peeta. 
â€œheâ€™ll be wounded, i bet,â€ i say.

â€œbecause thresh would have never gone down without a 
fight. heâ€™s so strong, i mean, he was. and they were in his ter-
ritory,â€ i say. 
â€œgood,â€ says peeta. â€œthe more wounded cato is the better. i 
wonder how foxface is making out.â€ 
â€œoh, sheâ€™s fine,â€ i say peevishly. iâ€™m still angry she thought 
of hiding in the cornucopia and i didnâ€™t. â€œprobably be easier to 
catch cato than her.â€

â€œme, too,â€ i admit. â€œbut not tonight.â€ 
we finish our food in silence and then peeta offers to take 
the first watch. i burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, 
pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras. i 
just need a few moments of privacy where i can let any emo-
tion cross my face without being seen. under the hood, i si-
lently say good-bye to thresh and thank him for my life. i 
promise to remember him and, if i can, do something to help 
his family and rueâ€™s, if i win. then i escape into sleep, com-
forted by a full belly and the steady warmth of peeta beside 
me. when peeta wakes me later, the first thing i register is the 
smell of goat cheese. heâ€™s holding out half a roll spread with 
the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. â€œdonâ€™t be 
mad,â€ he says. â€œi had to eat again. hereâ€™s your half.â€ 
â€œoh, good,â€ i

cato could be right outside our cave.â€ 
he grabs my hand away. â€œwhat do i care? iâ€™ve got you to 
protect me now,â€ says peeta, pulling me to him. 
â€œcome on,â€ i say in exasperation, extricating myself from 
his grasp but not before he gets in another kiss. 
once weâ€™re packed up and standing outside our cave, our 
mood shifts to serious. itâ€™s as though for the last few days, 
sheltered by the rocks and the rain and catoâ€™s preoccupation 
with thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. now,

although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense weâ€™re re-
ally back in the games. i hand peeta my knife, since whatever 
weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his 
belt. my last seven arrows â€” of the twelve i sacrificed three in 
the explosion, two at the feast â€” rattle a bit too loosely in the 
quiver. i canâ€™t afford to lose any more. 
â€œheâ€™ll be hunting us by now,â€ says peeta. â€œcato isnâ€™t on

s of inactivity, the hunt has 
taken its toll. i order him into the sleeping bag and set aside 
the rest of his food for when he wakes. he drops off imme-
diately. i pull the sleeping bag up to his chin and kiss his fore-
head, not for the audience, but for me. because iâ€™m so grateful 
that heâ€™s still here, not dead by the stream as iâ€™d thought. so 
glad that i donâ€™t have to face cato alone. 
brutal, bloody cato who can snap a neck with a twist of his 
arm, who had the power to overcome thresh, who has had it 
out for me since the beginning. he probably has had a special 
hatred for me ever since i outscored him in training. a boy 
like peeta would simply shrug that off. but i have a feeling it 
drove cato to distraction. which is not that hard. i think of his

 iâ€™m shouting, and although i canâ€™t 
quite see whatâ€™s happening, i know he must have stabbed the 
thing because the pull lessens. iâ€™m able to haul him back onto 
the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the 
lesser of two evils awaits. 
cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is 
slowing and i know soon heâ€™ll be recovered enough to come 
for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. i arm my bow, 
but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be 
thresh. who else could jump so high? i feel a momentâ€™s relief 
because we must finally be up above the mutt line and iâ€™m just 
turning back to face cato when peetaâ€™s jerked from my side. 
iâ€™m sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face. 
cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding 
peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. peetaâ€™s 
clawing at catoâ€™s arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether 
itâ€™s more important to breathe or try and stem th
