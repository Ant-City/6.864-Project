[CHARACTER] 
[CHARACTER] is one of the few characters whose complete biography
is described by the biblical narrative, and the early events of
his life characterize him as a product of his circumstances. born
in egypt, [CHARACTER] is raised by pharaoh's daughter, who takes pity
on the abandoned hebrew baby. after an impulsive murder, [CHARACTER] flees
west, where he begins a life as a shepherd and stumbles into god
in the form of a burning bush. he reluctantly agrees to return to
egypt and demand the israelites' release, but agrees to little more.
each event in the journey from egypt to mount sinai, where god delivers
his laws to the israelites, propels [CHARACTER] further into the roles
of prophet, priest, ruler, and savior of israel.
[CHARACTER]' most heroic virtue is his steadfast obedience,
and it might be said that a passive quality permeates each of his
miracles. ten plagues strike egypt because [CHARACTER] simply appears
in pharaoh's court to request the release of the israelites. with
the help of his rod, or divine staff, [CHARACTER] parts the waters of
the red sea merely by outstretching his arms. later, the beleaguered
israelites defeat a mighty army when two men help [CHARACTER] raise his
hands for the duration of the battle. the image of a stationary
man bringing about overwhelming physical feats is striking. [CHARACTER]
himself is far from passive or reticent, yet he represents a prototype
of the biblical hero whose greatness lies not in self-assertion
but in obedience to god.
[CHARACTER] is a compelling figure because he possesses human
faults. he is passionate and impulsive. descending from mount sinai, [CHARACTER]
knows ahead of time that the people are worshipping a golden idol,
because god has warned him of this fact. upon seeing the people,
[CHARACTER] angrily breaks the stone tablets inscribed with god's laws.
god seems to value this passionate quality in [CHARACTER], for [CHARACTER] is
an effective mediator between god and the israelites. he prays with
a sense of urgency, unafraid to ask god to refrain from divine retribution
and willing to accept the blame for the people's actions. his earnest
attention to the present situation and to god's demands earns [CHARACTER]
the opportunity to speak with god face to face. yet his passion
remains his weakness. god commands [CHARACTER] to produce water from a
rock by speaking to it, but, irritated with the people's complaints,
[CHARACTER] hits the rock with his staff. this act of negligence bars
[CHARACTER] from entering the very promised land to which he has guided
the israelites for almost half a century.
